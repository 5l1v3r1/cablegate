¶1.  (U) The Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society (BHRWS) held a 
press conference December 11 to inaugurate its activities and 
launch its website: www.bhrws.org.  Led by Shura Council 
member Faisal Foulad, founding members of the NGO called for 
stronger advocacy of human rights issues and vowed to play a 
role in the kingdom's democratization process.  Members said 
they would organize campaigns to encourage the GOB to sign 
international agreements related to human rights.  They also 
expressed concern for draft laws on the regulation of public 
gatherings and political and non-governmental societies.  The 
BHRWS supports the re-opening of the Bahrain Center for Human 
Rights (BCHR) and the integration of human rights education 
in schools. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Many civil society activists criticize the 
BHRWS for being too close to the government and point out 
that it is not a substitute for the dissolved Bahrain Center 
for Human Rights.  They are correct in that the BHRWS will 
not fill the void once occupied by the Bahrain Center, but 
BHRWS members are genuine in their concern for human rights 
issues and interest in advocacy.  They will likely avoid 
highly sensitive areas and seek to work with the system, but 
they are unafraid of calling for close monitoring and 
evaluation of the GOB's policies.  Representatives of several 
human rights organizations, including some who worked closely 
with the BCHR, attended the launch and gave their support for 
the society.
