SUBJECT: GOF STEPS UP ANTI-COUNTERFEITING PLAN 
 
 
NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION 
 
¶1.  (U)  The French Ministry of Economy, Finance and 
Industry launched an anti-counterfeiting campaign on April 3 
designed to persuade consumers not to buy counterfeit goods 
through public service announcements on television and on 
the Internet, as well as on a special website (www.non- 
merci.com).   A special exhibit on the risks of 
counterfeiting will also tour France.  The first stop of the 
exhibit will be in Cannes, between April 7 and May 7. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Inaugurated by French Industry Minister Francois 
Loos, the 5 million euro campaign, financed by both the 
National Intellectual Property Institute INPI and the 
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry, features five 
positive aspects of combating counterfeiting: protecting 
consumer health and safety, defending jobs, fighting against 
organized crime and terrorism, protecting innovation and 
preserving French competitiveness. 
 
¶3.  (U)  This campaign is part of a wider government plan, 
which will include reinforcing French anti-counterfeiting 
laws and regulations, especially through implementation of 
the April 29 2004 EU Directive on the enforcement of 
intellectual property rights.  A draft bill on transposing 
the directive should be presented to Prime Minister 
Dominique de Villepin later the week of 3 April. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Finally, the government will also organize a 
meeting with enterprises and on-line service providers to 
discuss means to prevent distribution of counterfeit 
products on the web.
