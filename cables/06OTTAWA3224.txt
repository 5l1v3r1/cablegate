SUBJECT: NEW TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ON CANADA'S CRIMINAL 
CODE LIST 
 
¶1. (U) On October 24, the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI) announced that Gulbuddin 
Hekmatyar's Faction of the Hezb-e Islami, the Hezb-e Islami 
Gulbuddin (HIG) has been designated as a terrorist 
organization under Canada's Criminal Code. 
 
¶2. (U) All Canadian financial institutions and foreign branch 
operating in Canada must review their records on a continuing 
basis for the names of persons or organizations covered by 
regulations under the Criminal Code and report their findings 
on a monthly basis to the relevant regulator, which, in the 
case of federally regulated financial institutions, is the 
OSFI.  The designation of individuals or entities under the 
Criminal Code effectively freezes their assets and prohibits 
fundraising on their behalf. 
 
¶3. (U) If institutions discover they hold accounts for or 
contracts with persons or organizations covered by the 
Criminal Code, they must report this immediately to both the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and  the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).  Moreover, institutions 
reporting to the RCMP and CSIS that are also reporting 
entities under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and 
Terrorist Financing Act must submit Terrorist Property 
Reports to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis 
Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). 
 
¶4. (U) A complete listing of the more 500 individuals and 
entities designated under Canada's Criminal Code, the UN 
Regulations on the Suppression of Terrorism, or the UN 
Al-Qaida and Taliban Regulations can be found on the OSFI 
website at http://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/osfi/index e.aspx.
