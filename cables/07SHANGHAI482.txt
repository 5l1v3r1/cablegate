¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Anhui Civil Affairs officials in a meeting 
with Poloff on July 26 described the current flooding as the 
most severe in 50 years.  While the worst was likely over, the 
disaster had impacted 16 million people, displaced over half a 
million, destroyed 90,000 homes, and caused almost 10 billion 
RMB in economic damages.  The central government was deeply 
concerned with the situation, with Premier Wen Jiabao having 
visited the region once and Vice Premier Hui Liangyu paying two 
visits to the flood scene.  While not as severe as the smaller 
but more damaging flood in 2003, the provincial and local 
governments had already spent more than 150 million RMB (USD 20 
million)in relief efforts.  End summary. 
 
----------------- 
Worst Floods since '54 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On July 26 Poloff and FSN Political Assistant met 
with Anhui Civil Affairs Office Disaster Relief Department 
Director Xue Kunming and Anhui Water Resources Office Deputy 
General Engineer Qiu Li to discuss recent flooding in Anhui, 
which they described as the worst flood since 1954.  According 
to Qiu, heavy downpours in Henan Province began on June 29 with 
flooding occurring along the Huai, Chu, and Yan rivers.  As of 
July 25, an area of 58,000 square kilometers had received 30 
centimeters of precipitation, within which, an area of 38,900 
square kilometers had received 40 centimeters of precipitation. 
The floodwaters had reached a peak of 25.59 meters.  The central 
leadership was paying close attention to the floods.  On July 5, 
Vice Premier Hui Liangyu visited Anhui to inspect the flood 
situation.  Hui returned on July 13, accompanied by Premier Wen 
Jiabao, a move automatically triggered by the flood waters 
passing the warning level.  In addition, President Hu Jintao has 
issued written directions on how to deal with the flood.

The Human Tragedy 
------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Xue said that the flood had impacted 16 million people 
altogether, affecting the populations of 12 cities, nine along 
the Huai River and three in southern Anhui, including Chizhou, 
Xuancheng and Huangshan.  Around 30 persons had perished during 
the flood but, Xue insisted, none had drowned.  A tornado 
spawned by the thunderstorms killed seven people in Tianchang 
County near Yangzhou on July 4.  Five or six people had been 
struck by lightning, and a number of people had perished as 
buildings collapsed.  Altogether almost 90,000 homes had 
collapsed. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A larger loss of human life had been prevented 
primarily due to three factors.  First, the government had done 
a good job with water control projects, including reinforcing 
critical dikes.  Second, a flood in 2003, while not as large as 
the current one, had destroyed over 870,000 homes, the vast 
majority of which had been rebuilt with better materials and 
better building techniques, making them better able to withstand 
this year's flood.  Third, the Civil Affairs Office had 
evacuated 600,000 persons in advance of the flood.  Most of the 
evacuees temporarily moved in with friends or relatives.  The 
remainder were evacuated to public buildings on higher land, 
such as schools, or into temporary tent cities.  Over 8,800 
tents had been erected and because the tents often got very hot 
money had been provided to purchase tarps to put up emergency 
shelters without walls. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Xue said people were beginning to return to their 
homes since the situation appeared to have stabilized.  It had 
stopped raining on July 25 and Xue expected the waters would 
recede quickly.  However, according to the Anhui website, rains 
began again in the evening of the 26th, forcing the evacuation 
of an additional 27,000 people along the Huai River as the flood 
crested for a fourth time.  As of July 30, the Anhui government 
announced that, while it was still at the warning level, the 
flood was expected to gradually subside sometime into August.

Economic Costs Massive

¶6.  (SBU) Xue said that in total, 22 million mu of farmland had 
been flooded, with 7 million mu completely washed out.  The 
flood resulted in close to 10 billion RMB in economic losses for 
Anhui Province.  This included 6 billion in agricultural losses 
that would directly impact Anhui's poorer residents.  The other 
four billion was in direct economic losses, such as washed out 
roads and bridges or collapsed homes. 
 
----------------- 
Paying for the Tragedy 
------------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU) According to Xue, the Anhui provincial government had 
allocated 89 million RMB (USD 11.87 million) to provide food, 
potable water, temporary shelter, clothing, and medicine for 
people in the affected areas.  In addition, county and city 
level governments had spent another 28 million RMB (USD 3.73 
million) in emergency relief funds.  County and city level 
governments had also distributed two million kilograms of rice 
and flour.  Thus far, Xue said, the government had been able to 
maintain social stability throughout the disaster and had also 
prevented any large-scale outbreak of communicable diseases. 
Xue declined to answer Poloff's question about how much--if 
any--funding the central government had provided. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Neither contact knew whether or not there was NGO 
involvement in relief efforts at the local level.  Xue said that 
while not actively seeking it, donations and volunteer labor 
were being accepted and utilized.  Anhui had received more than 
40 million RMB (USD 5.33 million) from local charities, 
businesses, private donors, and other city governments.  They 
had also received several million RMB from Hong Kong donors. 
Volunteers were being directed to the Volunteer Association that 
was supervised by the Civil Affairs Office.
