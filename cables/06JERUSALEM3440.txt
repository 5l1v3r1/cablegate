Military Developments 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.    (SBU) The IDF concluded a three-day operation on August 
6 in southern Gaza near Rafah.  Palestinian medical sources 
report that 17 Palestinians were killed during the operation, 
including nine Hamas and one Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) 
member.  Seven others were identified as civilians, while 52 
Palestinians were wounded.  Officials from the Rafah 
governor's office reported significant damage to 
infrastructure. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) Palestinian militants launched three Qassam 
rockets the evening of August 5 from northern Gaza in the 
direction of the Western Negev.  There were no reported 
injuries or damage.  The Popular Resistance Committees and 
PIJ claimed responsibility for the rocket fire.  The IDF on 
August 5 fired at suspected militants attempting to launch 
rockets from northern Gaza, injuring one Palestinian 
civilian, according to Palestinian sources. 
 
¶4.    (SBU) Palestinian gunmen shot and killed Colonel 
Muhammad al-Musa, the director of Military Intelligence for 
northern Gaza, as he traveled in his vehicle on August 6 in 
Gaza City.  Al-Musa's bodyguard and one civilian were also 
injured in the attack.  Fatah, which has announced a 
three-day period of mourning, accused the Hamas military wing 
of orchestrating the killing. 
 
¶5.    (SBU) In the West Bank, the IDF conducted a raid the 
afternoon of August 6 into Silat al-Harithiyah, northwest of 
Jenin, and surrounded the house of wanted PIJ activist Raed 
Najib al-Umari.  During the operation, al-Umari was killed in 
an exchange of gunfire with the IDF.  Palestinian youths also 
clashed with the IDF, resulting in three injuries and five 
arrests.  Palestinian gunmen also fired on IDF troops in 
Yamoun village near Jenin and hurled an explosive device near 
Tulkarm.  There were no reported injuries from these 
incidents. 
 
¶6.    (SBU) The IDF on August 6 arrested Hamas PLC member 
(Ramallah) Shaykh Fadel Saleh.  The arrest follows the August 
5 arrest of PLC Speaker Aziz Dweik.  Since June 25, the IDF 
has detained 29 Hamas PLC members and five PA cabinet 
ministers.  The IDF overnight August 6-7 arrested 14 
Palestinians in Nablus, Jenin, Ramallah, Hebron, and 
Bethlehem. 
 
Humanitarian Update 
------------------- 
 
¶7.    (SBU) The Rafah crossing remains closed August 7.  Both 
the Karni/al-Mintar and Nahal Oz crossings are operational 
August 7, as they were August 6, according to USAID 
Gaza-based staff.  Gaza-based PalTrade official Mohammed 
Skaik reported that 230 truckloads transited the 
Karni/al-Mintar crossing into Gaza August 6, including sugar, 
flour, cooking oil, rice, animal feed, medicines, and frozen 
foods.  For the first time since June 23, Skaik reported that 
eight truckloads were exported out of Gaza August 6, 
specifically ice cream and cookies destined for the West Bank 
market. 
 
¶8.    (SBU) Nine of the ten electricity feeder lines from 
Israel into Gaza are operational on August 7.  The single 
feeder line from Israel into the Rafah area, damaged in an 
August 2 military operation, has not yet been repaired.
