Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
Thank you for your letter regarding a visit by Russian personnel 
to Bagram Air Force Base, Afghanistan, to view an obelisk 
commemorating Soviet airmen. 
 
We welcome a visit to the base by the Russian Ambassador to 
Afghanistan and his in-country staff in order to view the 
 
monument. Reconstruction or removal of the obelisk, 
however. can only take place after an understanding 
is reached with the 
Afghan government. 
 
 
I hope this step will help advance your efforts to ensure the 
appropriate commemoration of Soviet airmen. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Condoleezza Rice
