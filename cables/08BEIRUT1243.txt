IRAQ WILLING TO SELL OIL TO 
LEBANON AT PREFERENTIAL PRICES 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) During his visit to Baghdad on August 20, PM Siniora 
discussed reinforcing bilateral economic ties with Iraq.  Iraq has 
long been one of Lebanon's major export markets, but it has exported 
only a trickle of goods to Lebanon in recent years, and no oil. 
Daily An Nahar reported that during the visit, Iraqi PM Nuri 
al-Maliki told PM Siniora that Iraq is willing to sell oil to 
Lebanon at preferential prices, whether by sea, land or pipeline. 
While the existing pipeline needs only minor repairs, the pumping 
station on the Iraqi-Syrian border was hit by a U.S. airstrike 
during the war and will require at least six months to rebuild, a 
senior Lebanese Energy Ministry source told us. 
 
EGYPT OFFERS TO SELL LEBANON ELECTRICITY 
AND GAS AT HIGH PRICES 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minister of Energy and Water Alain Tabourian failed to 
improve the Egyptian offer to supply Lebanon with electricity and 
gas during his meeting with Egyptian Ministers of Electricity and 
Gas on August 16 in Alexandria, Tabourian's advisor told us.  He 
said Tabourian asked the Egyptians to sell Lebanon electricity at 
the same price as they sell it to Egyptian industries, i.e., with no 
subsidy, while Egypt asked for much higher prices.  Egypt also 
offered Lebanon natural gas at a higher price that what it charges 
neighboring countries.  The Egyptian Minister of Electricity will be 
meeting with Tabourian and his regional counterparts in Jordan on 
August 26-27 to discuss details regarding the supply of Egyptian 
electricity to Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.  Lebanon needs to 
purchase electricity to reduce power cuts, Tabourian's advisor 
remarked. 
 
PUBLIC DEBT OVER $44 
BILLION BY END OF JUNE 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Finance 
(MOF), gross public debt reached $44.4 billion at the end of June 
2008, representing an eight percent increase compared to the end of 
¶2007.  Local currency debt rose by 10.5 percent, to around $23 
billion, while foreign currency debt increased by 5.4 percent to 
$21.4 billion.  Public debt stood at 173 percent of GDP. 
 
CENTRAL BANK GROSS FOREIGN CURRENCY 
ASSETS REACH RECORD HIGH 
----------- 
 
¶4. (U) The Central Bank of Lebanon (CBL) balance sheet for 
mid-August 2008 showed a record high $16.9 billion in gross foreign 
currency assets.  This positive trend is expected to continue as the 
CBL remains the largest buyer of surplus dollars in the market. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Meanwhile, a senior banking source at Audi Bank told us the 
CBL also has recorded a small, positive net foreign currency assets 
position, estimated at approximately $50 million in mid-August 2008, 
for the first time since mid-2006, when CBL interventions in the 
foreign exchange market to maintain currency stability drained its 
foreign currency reserves.  (Note:  Audi Bank's estimate does not 
take into account $1.5 billion in Arab deposits at the CBL, which 
are considered as long term deposits to support CBL foreign currency 
reserves.  End note.) 
 
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS POSTS $83 MILLION 
 
BEIRUT 00001243  002 OF 002 
 
 
SURPLUS IN FIRST HALF OF 2008 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) According to the CBL, Lebanon's balance of payments posted a 
cumulative surplus of $83 million in the first half of 2008, 
compared to a deficit of $207 million in the first half of 2007. The 
cumulative surplus was attributed to a $2.62 billion increase in 
CBL's net foreign assets, combined with a $2.54 billion decrease in 
those of banks and financial institutions. 
 
LEBANON REMAINS TOP HOLDER OF 
GOLD AMONG ARAB COUNTRIES 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Pro-opposition daily Al Akhbar on August 18 quoted the World 
Gold Council as stating that Lebanon remained on top of the list of 
Arab countries in terms of gold reserves.  Lebanon was estimated to 
have around 9.2 million ounces of gold valued at around $7.5 
billion. 
 
INWARD REMITTANCES REACH 
22.3 PERCENT OF GDP IN 2007 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) According to the World Bank's 2008 "Migration and Remittances 
Factbook," Lebanon had the highest share of remittances as a 
percentage of GDP (22.3 percent) in the region.  Remittances are an 
important source of external funding for the Lebanese economy, as 
they constitute a large portion of investments in the country, the 
report said.  The flow of inward remittances to Lebanon reached $5.5 
billion in 2007, up by 6.2 percent in 2006.  The value of Lebanon's 
remittances ranked 16 out of 192 countries worldwide included in the 
survey.  Out of 14 MENA countries, Lebanon ranked third in terms of 
remittances received or 19.3 percent of inward remittances into the 
region. 
 
TRAVEL AND TOURISM BOOST ECONOMY 
AND EMPLOYMENT IN 2008 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) estimated that 
the travel and tourism (T&T) industry would contribute directly 
$1.36 billion to the Lebanese economy in 2008, or 5.7 percent of 
GDP.  As a result, direct industry employment will reach 80,000 or 
5.9 percent of total employment in 2008.  Given that T&T touches all 
economic sectors, its real direct and indirect impact is forecasted 
to generate $4.43 billion or 18.7 percent of overall economic 
activity in Lebanon in 2008, as well as 252,000 jobs, representing 
18.4 percent of total employment in 2008.
