¶1.  (SBU) Acting EconPol Counselor met on June 15 with Silvia 
Maca, Head of the Ministry of Finance's Export Financing and 
Promotion Division to inquire about an Austrian response to 
the U.S. survey on Iran and export credits (reftel).  Maca 
said that the GoA, to her knowledge, had not received the 
survey.  We passed the survey and the U.S. responses to her. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Maca questioned whether the OECD Export Credit 
Group (ECG) was the appropriate forum to discuss export 
credit policies towards Iran.  The ECG had historically not 
served as a policy-influencing body.  Maca stressed that the 
EU was a more suitable venue to discuss export credit 
policies, especially in a political context.  Maca opined 
that EU Member States would discuss the survey at an upcoming 
Council Working Group on Export Controls.
