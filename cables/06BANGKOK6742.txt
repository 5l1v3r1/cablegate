¶1.  Poloff delivered reftel demarches to Charn Jullamon, 
Director of the Peace, Security and Disarmament Division at 
the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Regarding the 
resolution, Mr. Charn indicated that Thailand will vote as it 
did last year, which is "to support but not co-sponsor" the 
resolution proposed by Cuba.  Regarding the Australian 
amendment, Mr. Charn noted that Thailand believes that the 
proposed amendment is "not relevant" to the resolution, and 
therefore they "need to be separated."  Mr. Charn explained 
that due to this technicality, Thailand will abstain from 
supporting the amendment.
