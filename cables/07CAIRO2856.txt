COMMITTEE MEETING, SEPTEMBER 24, NEW YORK 
 
REF: SECSTATE 128326 
 
(U) Poloff passed points in reftel to Egyptian MFA Deputy 
Assistant Minister for North American Affairs Mohammad Abou 
el Dahab on September 20.  The GOE agrees on the need to 
support the Palestinian Authority government, especially at a 
forum such as the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee Meeting (AHLC) 
scheduled for September 24 in New York. Dahab said that the 
GOE has been a regular participant at the AHLC, and per 
previous practice, plans to send MFA Director for Palestinian 
Affairs Badr Abdelatty as delegation head.  Abou Dahab said 
he would immediately convey to Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit 
that the Secretary plans to attend the AHLC morning session 
(per reftel), but was unable to confirm if the GOE would 
raise its level of attendance, given that Aboul Gheit and his 
party are en route to New York.
