SUBJECT: San Jose Distributing Cards to Wilberforce Applicants 
 
REF: 09 STATE 067921 
 
¶1.     Per reftel A, post is providing Wilberforce pamphlets to 
A-3, G-5, H, J, NATO-7, and B-1 visa applicants.  Conoffs are 
confirming that the applicants have received, read and understood 
the contents of the pamphlets as described. 
 
 
 
¶2.     As an additional measure, Post has instituted a new practice 
of giving wallet-sized cards to relevant applicants.  The cards are 
in Spanish, and contain the phone numbers for the Costa Rican 
embassy in Washington, protective tips, and the phone numbers for 
the trafficking emergency hotlines.   Post is printing and 
laminating the cards in-house.  The cards may serve as a lifeline 
in cases when applicants' passports or papers are taken from them.
