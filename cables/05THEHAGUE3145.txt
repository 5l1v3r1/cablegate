SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS/SUDAN: DUTCH MAY SEND UNMIS TROOPS 
 
 
¶1. (U) The Dutch recently moved a step closer to committing 
troops to the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS). 
According to press reports, the Dutch cabinet on November 18 
reached internal agreement to deploy 15 military observers, 
15 police officers, and 5 staff officers to UNMIS for a 
one-year period.  Military observers will operate in the Juba 
sector in teams including representatives of the former 
warring factions, while the police officers will be seconded 
to the UNMIS police mission in the same region. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Despite the positive Cabinet decision, actual 
deployment is contingent on a number of factors, including 
approval by Dutch Parliament.  Hans Docter (Deputy Director, 
Sudan Task Force, MFA) explained to poloff on November 22 
that Parliament's approval will depend on the security 
situation in the Juba region.  Docter intimated that, if the 
situation deteriorates, Parliament's imprimatur may be 
difficult to secure. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Docter hoped Parliament would review the cabinet's 
decision during the November 23 and 24 budget debate.  In the 
event that it does not -- which Docter admitted was a 
distinct possibility -- the Cabinet would call a special 
hearing to solicit Parliamentary review of the UNMIS 
proposal.  Docter was skeptical whether such a hearing could 
be called before the new year.
