Director of political affairs Weiner Jean Baptiste told 
poloff December 8 that the GOH has not determined their 
position on the resolution for Sudan.  Upon hearing the USG 
position, Jean Baptiste said that from a technical 
perspective it seems very reasonable, and in line with 
Haiti's position.  Jean Baptiste said that Haiti, which holds 
an observer status with the African Union, will also seek the 
AU's position.  Without a doubt, we condemn the government of 
Sudan, but we do not wish to isolate the country, which, he 
said, will aggravate the crisis.
