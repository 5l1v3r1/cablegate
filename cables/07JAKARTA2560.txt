¶1. (SBU) Summary. During a key donors meeting in Bali on September 
11-12, Chief Executive of the Indonesian National Committee for 
Avian Influenza and Pandemic Preparedness (KOMNAS) Bayu Krisnamurthi 
stated that Indonesia needs around $300 million per year to fight 
avian influenza (AI).  Donors pledged new funding and greater 
coordination to KOMNAS at the meeting.  Three Ministers attended the 
gathering, indicating increased political commitment to fighting AI 
from the Government of Indonesia (GOI).  Minister of Health Siti 
Fadilah Supari announced final testing and imminent distribution of 
a rapid test to confirm human H5N1 infection.  UN Systems 
Coordinator for AI David Nabarro urged immediate action to reduce 
the prevalence of the AI virus in poultry in Indonesia and to resume 
open sharing of information and biological materials. Nabarro called 
Ambassador Hume on September 13 to share views and concerns about 
the AI problem in animals and humans. End Summary.

AI State Funds Down, But Total GOI Funding Up 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Indoneia hosted a key donors meeting for Avian Influenzain 
Bali on September 11-12.  In a sign of growin GOI concern regarding 
the issue, Coordinating Miister for People's Welfare Aburizal 
Bakrie, Minser of Health( Fadilah Supari, and Minister of 
Ariculture Anton Apriyanto  attended the meeting, making the first 
time three GOI ministers attendedthe same AI meeting.  KOMNAS Chief 
Executive BayuKrisnamurthi reported, on the sidelines of the 
gthering, that Indonesia needs $300 million per yea to control AI. 
 For 20007-2008, the GOI has commtted $52.9 million in state funds 
while internatonal donors are contributing $68.4 million.  Althouh 
the state's budget decreased from last year, ttal GOI spending for 
AI actually increased when aatoring in funding for diisaster 
management and improved i(u ance se rvice..  Bayu stated that the 
GOI is using this year'sf"unding to finance six elements of AI 
control:  uublic communications, restructuring of the poultry 
industry, integrated disease surveillance in animals and humans, 
virus elimination at the source in poultry, health facilities and 
the establishment of pandemic preparedness measures.

Embassy Announces New Funding 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Embassy announced $25 million in new USAID funding to 
fight AI.  USAID will use the new assistance to expand existing AI 
programs.  These programs focus on integrated animal and human 
surveillance, AI control in poultry, and behavior change 
communications.  USAID directs approximately 75% of its funding for 
AI toward the animal health sector.

UN Claims AI Endemic in Poultry, Urges Sample Sharing 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) UN Systems Coordinator David Nabarro asserted that AI among 
poultry is now endemic to Indonesia.  According to the UN Food and 
Agricultural Organization (FAO) reports, Indonesia had over 1,950 AI 
poultry outbreaks during the first two quarters of 2007.  This 
compares to only 454 total outbreaks for all of 2006.  Experts 
attribute the significant increase to both improved surveillance and 
a failure to cull infected birds.  Culling currently occurs in only 
one third of outbreaks.  Experts believe that urgent strengthening 
of AI control in poultry is vital to the prevention of future human 
cases of AI. 
 
¶5. (SBU) UN Systems Coordinator David Nabarro recognized the GOI for 
improved political commitment to the issue but also emphasized the 
critical importance of open sharing of AI information and biological 
materials. In addition, Nabarro urged the GOI to improve behavior 
change communication, and to strengthen the leadership capacity of 
KOMNAS.  We understand that Nabarro, in private conversations with 
Ministers Bakrie and Supari, also directly urged the GOI to resume

fully sample sharing.

Minister Announces Imminent Availability of Rapid Test 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Minister Supari announced the imminent availability of a 
rapid test to confirm AI in humans.  Supari noted that the Ministry 
of Health (MOH) was completing control trials and will distribute 
these tests to all hospitals and possibly local clinics, as early as 
next week.  When queried, Dr. Nyoman Kandun, Head of Indonesian 
Centers for Disease Control indicated that he was unaware of the kit 
distribution program.  Supari did not state whether these kits are 
licensed.  Experts note that the rapid test is likely to be less 
sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation 
currently used by the GOI.  However, if experts validated the rapid 
test and local healthcare providers used the test appropriately, the 
kits could be a useful tool for improving early identification of 
human cases.

Nabarro Checks In With Embassy 
------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) On September 12, Nabarro called Ambassador Hume to discuss 
views from the meeting.  Nabarro noted the seriousness of the AI 
poultry problem, indicating that it may take five years to get this 
problem under control.  Nabarro mentioned that, during a side 
meeting with Supari, she said she had a solution for sample sharing 
(NFI), a human vaccine ready for use, and the rapid diagnostic test. 
 Nabarro said the Indonesian plans were inadequate.  He thanked the 
USG for its efforts to improve the situation.
