SUBJECT: OSCE/FSC:  JULY 22 RUSSIAN "LESSONS LEARNED FROM 
AUGUST 2008"; 1540 BEST PRACTICE GUIDE GOES FORWARD 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  At the final plenary before the summer 
break of the Forum for Security Cooperation (FSC), Russia 
made a lengthy statement outlining the lessons learned from 
the August 2008 war in Georgia.  While Russia made what it 
considered to be a strong case that Georgian President 
Saakashvili bears the brunt of responsibility for what 
happened, the EU and NATO also received criticism.  Russia 
also urged Georgia to sign non-use of force agreements with 
the proxy regimes and plugged its proposal for a new European 
Security Treaty.  In response, Georgia, the EU, Greek CIO, 
and the U.S. commented on Russia's analysis along familiar 
lines.  The EU and the United States again called on Russia 
to respect the August 12 and September 8 agreements, urged 
access to the separatist regions, and reiterated their 
support for Georgia's territorial integrity. 
¶2. (SBU) Meanwhile, the U.S. distributed the UNSCR 1540 Best 
Practice Guide (BPG) on Export Controls and Transshipments 
for final review, and requested the draft decision welcoming 
the guide be placed on the September agenda for action. 
Russia underscored its support for the BPG as distributed by 
the U.S.  Assuming adoption in September as now appears 
likely, this will represent the fruit of two years of effort. 
 The FSC fall session will begin on September 9 under UK 
Chairmanship.  End Summary.

¶3.  (SBU) The July 22 Forum for Security Cooperation (FSC) 
final plenary of the summer session was dominated by the 
planned Russian intervention on "lessons learned from August 
2008." (FSC.DEL/146/09).  The politically sensitive nature of 
the meeting resulted in attendance by both the OSCE Secretary 
General and the Greek Ambassador in her capacity as the 
Chairman in Office of the OSCE. 
¶4.  (SBU) As broadcast to most delegations last week, Russian 
rep (Ulyanov) delivered a lengthy statement outlining the 
lessons learned from August 2008 events in Georgia.  He 
pre-announced the presentation to give all delegations ample 
time to prepare.  He said he was under instruction to raise 
these items on the eve of the one-year anniversary of 
Georgia's attacks on the Russian peacekeepers, rather than 
waiting until September after the fact.  Ulyanov claimed that 
Russia was not trying to upset the FSC Chair (Georgia) during 
its last meeting, but it was just a matter of timing. 
¶5. (SBU) Ulyanov began by asserting the peaceful settlements 
in the Transcaucasus area were trampled by Georgian President 
Saakashvili.  Russia has found evidence dating from 2006 when 
relevant secret planning began to seize the Tskhinvali 
region.  Georgia's actions were pre-meditated and used 
indiscriminant force when firing upon the Russian 
peacekeeping forces.  Georgia alleges that its actions were 
accidental in nature, but they were not.  They were planFt.)Q.b7
