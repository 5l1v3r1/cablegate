POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
SABAH: A written announcement by the American Embassy in Ankara 
expressed that Turkey did not have a better friend than the 
United States in its twenty years of anti-PKK struggle. The 
announcement said any support to the terrorist organization by 
the Unites States was out of question. The announcement read 
"With various intelligence, diplomatic and financial measures we 
are engaged in an active effort to limit PKK's activities." In 
response to interpretations that the visit of U.S. Vice Consul 
Alicia Allison's to Diyarbakir Mayor was evidence of support to 
PKK, the announcement said "There can not be such a thing so far 
from the truth. American officials' visits to elected political 
representatives are among their ordinary diplomatic activities. 
In addition, Allison told her interlocutors to take a clear 
stance against PKK terrorism, and to avoid undertaking actions 
which could be perceived as supportive of PKK." 
RADIKAL, MILLI GAZETE, TERCUMAN, VAKIT: In Hakkari province, a 
remote-controlled mine planted on the road between Yuksekova and 
Esendere border gate with Iran, was detonated by GOT forces. 
Hakkari Governor Erdogan Gurbuz was going to use that route to 
meet his Iranian counterpart. 
EVRENSEL: On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the PKK's 
armed struggle, some youth groups in Yuksekova, Hakkari

supported by local spectators. Similar activities were staged in 
Nusaybin, Mardin province, as well as in Van and Batman 
provinces. 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: A group from the Diyarbakir Free Citizen 
Movement tried to submit to the Diyarbakir Governor's office 
petitions signed by 30,600 persons stating that Abdullah Ocalan 
was the means for solving the Kurdish issue through peaceful 
ways. Police arrested 14 persons who were trying to deliver the 
petitions and attacked the group waiting outside. The crowd 
arrayed banners reading "Long Live President APO". 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: Heze Parastina Gel, (HPG - Peoples Defense 
Forces) announced that two soldiers were killed and three others

attempting to intervene in the incident ran over a five-year old 
child and killed him. HPG added that near Herinke village of 
Yuksekova, Hakkari province, an armored vehicle was destroyed 
and four soldiers in it were killed during the incident on 
August 14. HPG claimed that forty persons were detained 
following the incidents.
