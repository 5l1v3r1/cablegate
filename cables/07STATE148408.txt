MEIRELLES 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Under Secretary Reuben Jeffery met with 
Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) Governor Henrique Meirelles 
October 21 on the margins of the World Bank/IMF Annual 
Meeting.  They discussed the need for and impediments to 
infrastructure investment in Brazil, impact of recent 
financial market turbulence on Brazil, and the prospects for 
a Brazilian sovereign wealth fund (SWFs).  END SUMMARY. 
 
Infrastructure Investment a Struggle 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following up on themes from their meeting in Sao 
Paulo in August, Meirelles told U/S Jeffery that the GoB,s 
efforts to increase foreign investment in Brazil face three 
"bottlenecks8: infrastructure, a lack of skilled workers, 
and an inconsistent regulatory environment.  He said that 
bringing regulatory surety by removing Brazilian law,s 
concept of &Social Justice8 would prove the most difficult 
issue to solve.  Meirelles noted a large amount of capital 
flowing into Brazil (maybe too much, he commented), but a 
shortage of good projects and ideas are available to 
effectively utilize the capital.  He added that the 
successful toll road concession auctions had taken 6 to 7 
years, and a complete change in philosophy, to finally 
overcome internal political and environmental problems. 
 
Recent Credit Crunch Leaves No Lasting Impact 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Meirelles noted that the recent problems in world 
capital markets had an immediate and pronounced impact on 
Brazil, with risk spreads increasing and the Real dropping 
from 1.85 to 2.13 per dollar.  However, as the crisis 
subsided, risk spreads returned to normal and the Real 
rebounded to 1.80 per dollar.  He mentioned that CBB started 
buying dollars again last week and that there were 
significant dollar inflows to Brazil on &Black Friday8 two 
days prior to the meeting.  Meirelles also sees a need to 
refocus on Basel II and ensure that bank capital allocation 
requirements for pledged liquidity lines are put in place. 
U/S Jeffery agreed that the banking system was more leveraged 
than analysts realized and that bank regulators must address 
structured investment vehicle accounting. 
 
Sovereign Wealth Funds ) No Issue in Brazil 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Due to Brazil,s very strict fiscal responsibility 
regulations, CBB cannot invest reserves in SFWs, according to 
Meirelles.  A SFW direct investment would be considered a 
primary expense of the GoB and affect its budget.  CBB can 
only invest in corporate securities or financial instruments 
if there were no prospect of controlling the company.  He 
added that CBB needs to stay very liquid and has 
approximately $160 billion in reserves of which $90 billion 
are invested in US Treasury securities.  (Note: According to 
press reports, Finance Minister Mantega recently said that a 
Brazilian SWF could start with $10 billion in surplus foreign 
exchange reserves.)
