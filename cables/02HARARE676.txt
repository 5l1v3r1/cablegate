   ELECTION VICTORY," THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY 
   NEWS" DEDICATED ITS MARCH 14 EDITORIAL TO PAYING 
   TRIBUTE TO THE MANY ZIMBABWEAN VOTERS WHO COURAGEOUSLY 
   VOTED FOR CHANGE, UNDER HOSTILE CONDITIONS, DURING THE 
   WEEKEND PRESIDENTIAL POLL.  EXCERPTS: 
 
¶2.   "AS HE RIDES OFF INTO THE SUNSET, THE WINNER OF 
   THE 
   MOST CONTROVERSIAL ELECTION IN ZIMBABWE'S HISTORY, 
   PRESIDENT MUGABE, MUST WONDER WHAT HIS VICTORY WILL 
   DO TO THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE OF HIS BELEAGUERED 
   COUNTRY. . .  THE WEST, ACCUSED BY MUGABE OF 
   CAMPAIGNING FOR HIS OUSTER FROM POWER, WILL NOT 
   TOUCH ZIMBABWE WITH A BARGE POLE, NOT AFTER AN 
   ELECTION SO RIDDLED WITH VIOLENCE AND CHICANERY 
   ONLY COUNTRIES WITH HIDDEN AGENDAS WILL ENDORSE IT 
   AS FREE AND FAIR. . .  IN FACT, THERE WERE SO MANY 
   IMPEDIMENTS PLACED IN THE PATH OF THE OPPOSITION IT 
   IS A TRIBUTE TO THEIR COURAGE, PATRIOTISM AND 
   DEDICATION THAT THEY GAVE ZANU PF SUCH A SCARE. 
   MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND HIS TEAM DID NOT FOR ONE 
   MOMENT FALTER IN THEIR CHALLENGE TO THE POLITICAL 
   BEHEMOTH THAT IS ZANU PF.  THE PEOPLE WHO FAILED 
   THEM MAY LIVE TO REGRET THEIR PREFERENCE FOR A 
   PARTY OF VIOLENCE AND LIES."
