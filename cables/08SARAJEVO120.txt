Commanding General 
Multi-National Force- Iraq (MNF-I) 
 
Dear Sir: 
 
It is my pleasure to respond to the letter from MNF-I dated 
30 September 2007. In this letter, MNF-I requested that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina deploy an infantry company or platoon plus 
for fixed-site security duties in Iraq. 
 
I am pleased to inform you that on January 17 the Bosnian 
Presidency has given preliminary approval for this 
deployment. This important decision indicates our strong 
commitment to meet your request and our participation in 
MNF-I. 
 
Before issuing final approval for the deployment, the 
Presidency has requested further information as to the size 
of the unit requested for this deployment and potential 
locations for its deployment in Iraq. 
 
I have been authorized to engage with MNF-I commanders in 
Iraq on these issues during our visit scheduled for January 
28-30. Upon my return, I will brief the Presidency on the 
information provided and seek final approval to undertake 
this deployment. 
 
Again, it is my pleasure to inform you of these developments 
in meeting your request.  I look forward to speaking with you 
or one of your colleagues in Iraq. 
 
Sincerely, 
Selmo Cikotic 
Minister
