¶1.  (U) Per Reftel, Embassy Kabul is providing a summary of 
Post programs and activities to promote human rights in 
Afghanistan. 
This is intended for President Bush's democracy and human 
rights 
roundtable to be held at the UN General Assembly on 
September 25. 
 
¶2.  (U) Begin text: 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Summary of Human Rights Situation in Afghanistan 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
Afghanistan,s human rights record remained poor due to 
several factors, including a continuing deadly insurgency, 
and a weak tradition of human rights reflecting both 
indigenous 
values and three decades of war.  Despite these challenges, 
the country continues to make progress toward 
the protection of human rights. 
This progress has included the establishment of an 
independent human rights commission, a ministry dedicated 
to women's values and human rights offices within several 
other ministries including the Ministry of Interior and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Serious human rights abuses 
continued, however, including acts of terrorism by 
insurgents, restrictions on rights of women, press and 
religious groups, as well as situations in which local 
security forces and police abused their authority.  Child 
labor was widespread, and there was no evidence that labor 
laws were enforced. Trafficking in persons remained a 
problem. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Senior USG Officials' Efforts to Promote Human Rights 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
The Ambassador and other U.S. officials use meetings with 
Afghan officials to underscore the U.S. democracy, 
human rights, and good governance message.  President Bush 
and the First Lady traveled to the country in March 2006 
and stressed the importance of education and political 
participation for women and girls.  Undersecretary for 
Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky visited in July 2007 to 
underscore the need to provide increased opportunities for 
women.  Assistant Secretary for International Organizations 
Kristen Silverberg visited Afghanistan to underscore USG 
support for the Ministry of Women,s Affairs at a critical 
time when it was under review by Parliament. 
 
---------------------------- 
USG Support for Afghan Women 
---------------------------- 
 
The United States has integrated women,s issues into 
virtually all of its programs, aiming to increase women,s 
political participation, education, economic opportunities, 
and their role in civil society. 
In 2007, Post successfully nominated two key contacts for 
Secretary Rice's inagural International Women of Courage 
 
SIPDIS 
awards. 
The Embassy lobbied quietly with Parliament leadership to 
protect the Women's Ministry from possible cuts. 
Embassy officers regularly meet with Afghan women's rights 
activists and female policy makers who face threats due to 
their work in advancing 
women's rights, and they have provided assistance in specific 
cases. 
The U.S. continued to provide support for 
capacity building to the Ministry of Women,s Affairs and 
the provincial departments of women's affairs to facilitate 
the role of the ministry as an effective advocate for 
women. During the year U.S. assistance ensured the 
participation of girls in the World Cup Soccer Delegation 
and arranged for the manager of a successful women,s 
literacy program to address the Global Conference on 
Literacy in New York. 
 
-------------------- 
Freedom of the Press 
-------------------- 
 
During the year the Embassy continued to meet with Afghan 
 
KABUL 00003207  002 OF 003 
 
 
government officials to promote freedom of the press.  This 
included quietly (and successfully) weighing in to discourage 
restrictive amendments being considered by parliament to 
the national Mass Media Law. 
On World Press Freedom Day, the Ambassador released 
a press statement underscoring the U.S. position on 
freedom of the press.  The USG has also 
assisted with the creation of 32 independent 
community-based radio networks and invested in training and 
business plan development to ensure the sustainability of 
independent media organizations.  Afghan Journalists have 
traveled to the United States for International Visitor 
Leadership Programs sponsored by the U.S. Government. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Establishing Rule of Law and Fighting Corruption 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
To date the USG has invested $37.5 million dollars to 
promote rule of law and establish a functioning legal 
system that meets international human rights standards. 
This assistance included training and equipping judges, 
attorneys, and administrators and building that sector,s 
infrastructure.  The United States trained more than 600 
judges, rehabilitated 40 judicial facilities, supported the 
Supreme Court in establishing its own judicial education 
and training committee, and continued training for 
employees in the legislative drafting unit of the Ministry 
of Justice.  The United States educated the public about 
the role of the legal system by distributing approximately 
72,000 sets of comic books on legal rights. The United 
States trained olice on the protection of human rights and 
community-based policing, with an emphasis on women's and 
children,s rights. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Assistance to Afghan NGOs and Civil Society 
------------------------------------------- 
 
The USG has provided $7 million dollars to establish and 
build capacity within the constitutionally-mandated 
Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.  USAID has 
invested $15.5 million into building capacity within the 
NGO sector to empower civil society to have a voice within 
Afghanistan.  Assistance was provided to establish a legal 
and regulatory framework for NGOs in addition to a small 
grants program that provides direct support to NGOs. 
Assistance was also provided to the Ministry of Economy to 
create and maintain a public registry of NGOs, which will 
help the government ensure accountability of the sector 
though robust implementation of the NGO law. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Looking Ahead to the Next Democratic Elections 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
The USG is an active partner with the Afghan government and 
international community in the preparations for upcoming 
Parliamentary, Provincial Council and Presidential 
elections in 2009 and 2010. This includes assistance to 
increase the capacity of the Independent Election 
Commission and working with civil society and other 
stakeholders on voter registration and education.  The U.S. 
provided training and assistance in the field of 
information technology and supported a pilot voter registry 
project. 
 
--------------------------- 
Promoting Religious Freedom 
--------------------------- 
 
U.S. officials have worked with the Afghan government, 
religious leaders and civil society organizations to 
promote religious tolerance. Several influential clerics 
and provincial religious scholars participated in an 
International Visitor Leadership Program examining the role 
of religious leaders in a democracy, which enabled them to 
see first-hand the expression of faith in a 
multi-denominational society, observe the practice of Islam 
in the United States, and participate in interfaith 
dialogues to strengthen mutual understanding. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Building Capacity to Address Trafficking in Persons 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
KABUL 00003207  003 OF 003 
 
 
The United States consistently raised human trafficking 
issues with the government and civil society. The United 
States worked with Afghan officials to develop a national 
anti-trafficking action plan with the government to combat 
human trafficking in both the short- and long-term. Since 
2004, the USG has provided over 800,000 dollars to support 
completion of Afghanistan,s first ever anti-trafficking 
legislation and to train officials in the Ministry of 
Interior, Ministry of Justice, and Attorney General's 
Office to detect trafficking and arrest and prosecute 
offenders. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Humanitarian Assistance to Returning Refugees 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
The United States was the single largest donor to the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees, repatriation program, which 
assisted more than 3.6 million refugees to return to 
Afghanistan since March 2002 -- 139,804 of whom returned in 
¶2006.  The United States also assisted returnees by 
providing NGO grants that facilitated the provision of 
shelter, water and sanitation services, education, health 
care, and livelihood opportunities. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Afghan Government's Human Rights Priorities 
------------------------------------------- 
 
Afghanistan,s human rights priorities include trafficking 
in persons, the return of refugees, and the establishment 
of rule of law.  Interference with Afghan refugees in camps 
in Pakistan continued to be a priority for the host 
government.  The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission 
is enshrined and mandated by the 2004 Constitution, and 
while there is no Human Rights Ministry, there are 
Ministries for Refugees, Social Affairs, and Women,s 
Affairs.
