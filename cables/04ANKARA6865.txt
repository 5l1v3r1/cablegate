SUBJECT: TIP: GOT PUSHING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOLS 
WITH SOURCE COUNTRIES 
 
¶1. (U) During a visit to Ankara led by US Embassy Chisinau in 
November (septel), a Moldovan anti-TIP government delegation 
heard high-handed criticism from Turkish interlocutors about 
Moldova's failure to respond to a GOT-proposed anti-TIP 
protocol (para 3).  The draft protocol, according to MFA DDG 
for Consular Affairs and TIP Task Force Deputy Director 
Haldun Otman, is the first step in establishing direct 
police-to-police and prosecutor-to-prosecutor communication 
in cross-border human trafficking cases. 
 
¶2. (U) COMMENT: Otman has repeatedly asserted to us that the 
MFA first offered through diplomatic channels draft protocols 
to source country Embassies in Ankara (including Azerbaijan, 
Belarus, Bulgaria, Egypt, Georgia, Moldova, Romania, Russia, 
and Ukraine) on November 20, 2003, and again in February 
¶2004.  We have confirmed that the embassies of Belarus, 
Egypt, Georgia, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine have received 
the draft protocol.  According to Otman, only Minsk and Kiev 
have reached official agreements with Ankara on a TIP 
protocol.  Until source countries agree on a formal anti-TIP 
protocol with the GOT, Otman and Security Director Mehmet 
Terzioglu, have repeatedly told us that direct law 
enforcement cooperation is "inappropriate". END COMMENT.
