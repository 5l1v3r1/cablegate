SUBJECT: CHINESE GROWING INVESTMENTS IN SAMOA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Wellington based Econoff recently had a chance to 
serve as acting Charge' in Apia, Samoa, affording the 
opportunity to represent the U.S. and meet with 
representatives of the Samoan Government, the local business 
community and members of the Diplomatic Corps at a reception 
hosted by the Chinese Ambassador, Longzhuang Shi at the 
Chinese Embassy on Sept 28, 2007 to celebrate the 58th 
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The theme of the evening was the very close 
relationship between Samoa and the PRC. The speeches given by 
the Chinese Ambassador and the Samoan Deputy PM Retzlaff 
stressed the largess of the Chinese which Samoan officials 
claim contributed to the success of the 13th South Pacific 
Games hosted in Apia from 25 August to 8 September.  These 
sporting events included 770 athletes from 22 Pacific Island 
nations and territories who competed in some 32 events. There 
were estimates of approx. 4000 visitors from the Pacific 
region attending the games. The stated objective of these 
games is to "create bonds of kindred friendship and 
brotherhood amongst people of the countries of the Pacific 
region through sporting exchange without any distinctions as 
to race, religion, or politics."  The PRC provided low 
interest loans and economic grants for construction of the 
main sporting venues, especially a large swimming complex. In 
April 2007 new development projects valued at $2.6 million 
were concluded and in September 2007, the PRC begun 
construction of two office complexes for the Samoan 
Parliament and Justice Department, with another multi-million 
dollar ministry building in the pipeline. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a frank exchange with the President of the Samoa 
Chamber of Commerce, Papalii Grant Percival, acting Charge' 
learned that the Chinese had since forgiven the loans for the 
construction of the sports complexes and were in the process 
of supplying two new turbo jets to the Samoan national 
airline to increase inter-island flights. The acting Charge' 
also had an opportunity to also meet with Rudolf Keil, the 
owner of Samoa's 5 private radio stations and the island only 
commercial cinema theater owner. We discussed the problems of 
IP protection and the growing number of pirated products 
entering the market especially from China. He asked for 
assistance in supporting cases brought to the attention of 
the Attorney General in the hope of beginning a crack down on 
the growing number of shops selling counterfeit items. Upon 
returning to Wellington, Econoff contacted industry 
representatives in Auckland to apprise them of the situation 
and was told that the Motion Picture Assoc. (MPA) would be in 
touch with Mr. Keil and the Samoan AG to support the 
enforcement of the IP regime against the growing instances of 
piracy.
