"Who Needs A Martyr?" 
 
Columnist Vaguinaldo Marinheiro commented in liberal, largest 
national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (1/6): "For a week, 
since Saddam Hussein's hanging, the world is questioning if violence 
within Iraq and of terrorists against Western targets will increase 
even more. The question is: will Saddam become another martyr for 
those who consider the West - mainly the US and its allies - as the 
enemy to be eliminated?....  Is there a better way to 'deify' 
someone among his followers than a death condemnation decreed by a 
vicious court?  Is there better propaganda for a tyrant like Saddam 
than the images of his hanging in the Internet?  The US and the 
Iraqi government seem to have forgotten that punishment, when 
considered unfair and showy, does not inhibit crimes. On the 
contrary, it increases the desire for revenge."
