¶2.      Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A.        Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent 
Reporting Period 
 
1)          April 6- EXBS Advisor attended a meeting with UFT 
Agreements Department Head Ziya Demirduzen and Docuart Corp 
representative Serdar Yurtseven to discuss the status of the 
Internal Control Program (ICP).  Demirduzen and Yurtseven 
discussed some of the specific customization requests the UFT 
would desire in the program. EXBS Advisor answered questions 
concerning the program in general and ensured that UFT and 
Docuart were approaching the project in a similar manner. 
Docuart believed that by mid-summer they could have a beta 
version of the customized program for review by UFT. At the 
conclusion of the meeting, Demirduzen requested another 
meeting with EXBS Advisor to discuss possible new ideas to 
improve Turkey's Export Control Program.  He expected to 
receive UFT leadership approval for his proposals and to be 
prepared to present them following the EXBS Advisor's trip to 
Washington DC. 
 
2)          April 11-  EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control 
and Disarmament First Secretary Serhan Yigit to conduct 
monthly update meeting on all current projects in progress in 
Turkey, including Internal Control Program (ICP), Commodity 
Identification Training (CIT), Product Identification Tool 
(PIT) and Second Line of Defense (SLD).  EXBS Advisor also 
discussed the status of the NP Cooperation Agreement, which 
was being reviewed by the Foreign Relations Committee of 
Parliament.  Yigit stated that he expected approval soon and 
for the Agreement to be forwarded to the full Grand National 
Assembly soon.  (Note: The Foreign Relations Committee 
approved the Agreement on April 13.  End Note) Finally, EXBS 
Advisor discussed Turkey's upcoming PSI exercise, delivering 
a request for invitations to be extended to members of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council to observe the exercise, thus 
promoting PSI in this region.  Yigit accepted this request 
and stated that the additional countries should be able to be 
included. 
 
3)          April 12-   EXBS Advisor met with the new 
Department Head for Export Controls, Undersecretariat for 
Customs - General Directorate of Customs Mustafa Esen to 
review EXBS program and specifically to discuss the PIT 
project.  Esen stated that he only assumed the position a few 
weeks earlier and he was still trying to gain a level of 
understanding on the many projects in his department.  He is 
aware that there are some discussion between senior Turkish 
Customs officials on the approved course of action for the 
customization of the PIT program.  The two options are: 1) to 
utilize only Turkish Customs resources, or 2) to utilize an 
outside contractor for the general work, with specific 
Customs information added later.  Esen believes that most 
likely a combination of these two options will be adopted; he 
also believes that the Customs information technology 
department will be designated as the lead department for this 
project. Esen expected a decision by the end of April/early 
May concerning the course of action to be taken.
