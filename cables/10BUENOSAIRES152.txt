SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.   Iran's announcement that it is enriching uranium to 20% was 
widely covered in Argentine newspapers, focusing on U.S. and French 
discussions in Paris over new sanctions.  Articles contained quotes 
from top U.S. and French officials denouncing Iran's policies and 
renewing calls for the UN Security Council to approve new 
sanctions, despite continued opposition from China and other UN 
Security Council members.  Additionally, conservative Ambito 
Financiero published an opinion from a former Argentine Deputy 
Foreign Minister stating "why it is urgent to stop Tehran."  End 
summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.   Luisa Corradini, second-largest daily La Nacion's 
correspondent in France, covered Defense Secretary Gates' meeting 
with his French counterpart.  Corradini writes that the U.S. "wants 
to take advantage" of France's presidency of the Security Council 
and pass new sanctions, but faces opposition from "emerging 
countries."  While China's opposition is the "principle obstacle," 
Corradini notes Brazil "favors dialogue with Tehran" while Turkey 
"never hides its hostility towards new sanctions," suggesting it 
may come down to wild cards such as Nigeria, with Western diplomats 
"not knowing its position."

¶3.   Left-leaning, pro-government Pagina 12's correspondent in 
France also wrote an article stating that President Obama and 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy "could not be more in agreement" 
over condemning Iran's announcement.  The article also covered 
Secretary Gates' visit and quoted his declaration that the only way 
to stop Iran is "through pressure."  However, the article also 
notes that while Russia has now "put itself a little more on the 
Western side," China is still opposed to sanctions as it "would 
complicate things more."

¶4.   Conservative financial daily Ambito Financiero printed an 
opinion article from former Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister 
Roberto Moritan on "why it is urgent to stop Tehran."  Moritan 
believes that Iran's announcement to enrich uranium to 20% is not a 
strategy to "improve negotiations" but rather a sign of "clear 
provocation."  Moritan states that the "situation requires urgent 
[diplomatic] action," but notes that China needs to "weigh the risk 
of a larger confrontation with the U.S." if China does not support 
sanctions, and that Brazil and Turkey need to clearly state on 
"which side of the table they are."

¶5.   Largest-circulation daily Clarin, English-daily Buenos Aires 
Herald, and financial dailies Buenos Aires Economico, El Cronista, 
and Ambito Financiero printed newswires from the Associated Press 
(AP) and EFE about the international reaction to Iran's 
announcement.  The newswires state that for the U.S. and France, 
Iran's announcement "marked the failure of negotiations" and the 
demand "to take the road towards economic and diplomatic 
sanctions."  Additionally, a couple of the articles note that 
Iran's "rapid reversal" towards shunning diplomatic talks could be 
a "sign of agitation" in the government over the disputed elections 
last year and the Anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on February
