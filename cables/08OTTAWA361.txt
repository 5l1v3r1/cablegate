¶1.  (U) Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier on March 11 expressed 
Canada's support for Kai Eide as the UN Secretary General's 
new Special Representative for Afghanistan, and will brief 
the media on March 12.  (Full text in para 2.)  The House of 
Commons again debated the future of the Canadian mission in 
Kandahar on March 10, while the Commons' Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs held a separate hearing on the Afghan 
mission on March 11, featuring former Deputy Prime Minister 
and Foreign Minister John Manley and members of his 
Independent Panel.  The Commons likely will vote on the 
government's motion to extend the Canadian Forces' mission in 
Afghanistan until 2011 -- contingent on NATO partners 
providing 1,000 more troops and adequate helicopter and UAV 
support -- on March 13, apparently with the support of the 
Official Opposition Liberal Party. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin text: 
 
The Honourable Maxime Bernier, Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
today (March 11, 2008) issued the following statement 
following the appointment of Kai Eide as the Special 
Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Afghanistan: 
 
"I welcome the appointment of Kai Eide as the Special 
Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Afghanistan. 
During my conversation with Mr. Eide yesterday morning, I 
assured him that Canada stands ready to work with him and his 
office to ensure an enhanced role for the UN in Afghanistan. 
 
Canada has long advocated a strong leadership role for the 
United Nations and the UN Special Representative for 
Afghanistan to bolster international cooperation and to 
advance the important work being undertaken by various UN 
agencies across the country in support of the Afghan 
government. 
 
We look forward to working closely with Mr. Eide on 
implementing the Afghanistan Compact in order to advance 
development, governance and security in that country.  Strong 
coordination between new and existing international partners 
is key to making this happen. 
 
The Canadian government wishes to convey its sincere 
appreciation to outgoing Special Representative Tom Koenigs 
for his tremendous efforts in Afghanistan over the past two 
years."
