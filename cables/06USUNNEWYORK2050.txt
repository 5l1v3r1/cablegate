SUBJECT: UN SYG REQUEST FOR AMIS SUPPORT 
 
¶1. (U) Please find below the text of a letter from UN SYG 
Kofi Annan requesting USG material and financial assistance 
for the AMIS support package.  The UN SYG has approached 
other delegations, including the EU, with similar requests. 
DPKO has promised to convene a meeting before November 3 to 
update interested delegations on the status of support for 
AMIS. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin Text: 
 
Excellency, 
 
As you are aware, on 20 September 2006, the African Union 
Peace and Security Council extended the mandate of the 
African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) until 31 December 2006. 
 In light of the Government of Sudan's continued position 
with respect to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in 
Darfur, the decision to extend the AMIS mandate is a very 
important step in the African Union and wider international 
community's efforts to expeditiously bring peace and 
stability to the region. 
 
In order to assist AMIS in fully and effectively implementing 
its crucial tasks in Darfur, the Security Council recently 
requested the United Nations to provide urgent support to 
AMIS.  To this end, the African Union Chairperson, Mr. Alpha 
Oumar Konare and I have agreed on the contents of an 
immediate support package that the United Nations would 
provide to AMIS, which was conveyed to President Omer Hassan 
Ahmed Al-Bashir in a letter dated 22 September 2006. 
 
The United Nations support could strengthen AMIS ability to 
assist in carrying out the Darfur Peace Agreement and provide 
protection for civilians in the region.  However, these 
steps, if allowed to be implemented by the Government of 
Sudan, will not be sufficient.  AMIS partners and supporters 
are expected to make an immediate and concerted effort in 
supporting the African Union in bringing peace to this long 
suffering region.  I hope that your Government will be in a 
position to consider providing AMIS with urgent additional 
material and financial assistance in order to enable it to 
carry out its mandate in the most effective manner. 
 
I wish to inform you that I have shared the contents of this 
letter with Mr. Konare.  The latter may wish to contact you 
for any practical discussion in this regard. 
 
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Signed 
Kofi A. Annan
