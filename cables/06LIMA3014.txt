SUBJECT: PERUVIANS PRAGMATIC ON CASTRO'S ILLNESS 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Pronouncements by Peru's leaders on the situation in 
Cuba have been guarded and pragmatic. 
 
--After lamenting Castro's deteriorating health, Peruvian 
Prime Minister and long-time advisor to President Alan Garcia 
told Radio Programs of Peru on 8/1 that the international 
community should prepare itself to assist in a political 
transition in Cuba to avoid "a civil war."  Del Castillo 
noted that Cubans are divided into "impassioned groups" and 
that "it is necessary to form a group that can play a role" 
in assuring a peaceful transition in that country. 
 
--In a similar vein, APRA Congressman and former Foreign 
Minster Luis Gonzalez Posada told Radio Programs of Peru on 
8/2 that he did not expect any change in the Cuban Government 
as the immediate result of Castro's illness and that it was 
necessary to wait and see how the Cuban leader's health 
problems would turn out. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: In contrast to many other figures in the 
region -- some of whom lionized Castro -- the comments so far 
by ruling APRA Party leaders and officals have been guarded, 
pragmatic, and oriented toward the need to assure a peaceful 
succession.  President Garcia has yet to offer a public 
opinion on Castro's situation.  End Comment.
