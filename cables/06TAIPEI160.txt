SUBJECT: TAIWAN CONSIDERING U.S. REQUEST ON BURMA 
MEMBERSHIP IN APG 
 
REF: SECSTATE 6134 
 
¶1.  (SBU) AIT delivered reftel talking points to Taiwan 
Ministry of Justice Department of Prosecutorial Affairs 
Director Shawn Tsai (Ching-hsiung) on January 17.  Tsai said 
Taiwan would give full consideration to the U.S. message when 
it came time to vote on Burma's application for membership in 
the APG. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Tsai also mentioned that, in spite of the fact that 
Taiwan was now on the APG Steering Committee and played an 
active role in APG events, it had been excluded from APG 
training in mutual evaluation held in Singapore on December 
5-6 because that training was held at an IMF facility. 
Taiwan is not an IMF member and China objected to its use of 
the facility.  Taiwan agreed to a compromise wherein another 
training session will be arranged solely for its officials in 
June of this year. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In the past year, there have been several attempts 
by China to exclude Taiwan from events which do not require 
statehood and to which Taiwan has been invited.  AIT believes 
that in order to be consistent with the U.S. policy of 
supporting Taiwan's participation in international 
organizations that do not require statehood, when pressure 
from China forces the host of an event to exclude Taiwan, the 
U.S. should support relocating the event to a neutral 
location where all invitees are welcome.
