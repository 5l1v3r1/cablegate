Nations Director Jan Kara and Ministry of Finance Financial 
Analytical Unit Director Karel Korynta. Korynta said at 
present there is no Bank Sepah or Bank Sepah International 
activity in the Czech Republic. He further indicated that the 
GOCR is prepared to implement financial sanctions against 
Bank Sepah or Bank Sepah International pending EU adoption of 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1747, which 
Korynta speculated could happen by the end of this week.
