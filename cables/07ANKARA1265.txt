¶1. (U)  Summary and comment. Turkish leaders, including, 
notably, pro-Kurdish politicians, roundly condemned the May 
22 bombing in downtown Ankara that killed six and injured 
over 90 persons (reftel).  PM Erdogan denounced terrorism and 
called for solidarity, as did main opposition Republican 
People's Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal.  President Sezer 
issued a strong statement condemning the attack and 
terrorism.  Chief of General Staff General Buyukanit, along 
with Erdogan and Baykal, was among the first to arrive at the 
scene after the bombing and spoke to the press about the 
likelihood of terrorism; it was the first time a CHOD had 
surveyed the scene of such a bombing.  Turkey's Human Rights 
Association (HRA) and other NGOs and labor unions have come 
out with forceful condemnations.  The HRA organized a 
commemoration May 23 in Istanbul, noteworthy in that many in 
the state apparatus have long suspected the HRA of sympathy 
for the terrorist PKK.  The tragedy may have the unintended 
consequence of unifying, at least briefly, Turkey's polarized 
society.  End summary and comment. 
 
¶2. (U) During May 23 remarks in Istanbul, a haggard-looking 
Erdogan stressed the tragedy's impact on the entire nation. 
"Terrorism is our common problem," he said, urging Turks to 
respond with unity and togetherness.  Parliament's speaker 
Bulent Arinc echoed the call for unity, "It is time to leave 
aside political strife and fights; the fight against 
terrorism is a common fight..."  Center-right True Path Party 
(DYP) chairman Mehmet Agar called the attack a "hideous 
action aimed at innocent people," and said Turkey should not 
be pulled into domestic strife.  CHOD Buyukanit impliedly 
fingered the PKK, directing questioners to look at the 
institutions behind the terror organization.  Nationalist 
Action Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahceli alone opted for 
partisan politics, warning that the ruling Justice and 
Development Party (AKP) would pay a heavy price for what he 
termed "weakening Turkey's fight against terrorism", and 
pitched his extreme nationalist party as the one that would 
eradicate terrorism and prevent the country's division. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Pro-Kurdish politicians spoke out as well. 
Diyarbakir's mayor Osman Baydemir was quick to deplore the 
bombing and conveyed his condolences to all Turks.  Mass 
killings and blind violence will accomplish nothing, he said, 
adding, "What they wanted to create was chaos, instability 
and terror..."  On May 23, pro-Kurdish Democratic Society 
Party (DTP) leader Ahmet Turk joined with several leftist 
party leaders at a press conference, "protesting" the 
explosion as an "inhumane violent act".  Media present 
characterized the group as having condemned the bombing. 
They also urged the government to ensure the July 22 
elections take place peacefully, despite provocations and 
anti-democratic actions. 
 
¶4. (U) Several labor unions and NGOs strongly condemned the 
bombing.  After visiting the site, HRA president Yusuf Alatas 
said, on behalf of HRA and four other human rights NGOs, 
"...the fight against terrorism should be conducted through 
democracy, supremacy of law, human rights and social peace." 
Methods that increase tension and harm democracy should be 
avoided.  Five labor unions issued separate statements 
labeling the attack as an attempt to destabilize the country 
and calling for unity.  During this election period, "our 
political parties and NGOs should leave aside their own 
interests, expectations, election tactics, individual and 
party views and insistently and courageously challenge 
terrorism...," the Confederation of Turkish employers' Union 
(TISK) declared.
