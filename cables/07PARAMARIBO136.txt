REF: STATE 16120 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, Pol/EconOff raised USG concern over 
illicit cash couriers with GOS Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Americas Division Head, Terence Craig.  Craig agreed that 
cash smuggling is a serious problem, and said his government 
enforces money laundering laws whenever possible.  He 
acknowledged that cash couriers are used by organized crime, 
drug traffickers, tax evaders, terrorist financiers, and 
other criminals.  He said that his government understands 
that cash smuggling undermines stability, economic growth, 
and the rule of law.  Suriname recognizes that legal and 
operational frameworks must be established and implemented to 
interrupt illicit currency transiting at its borders.  He 
added that the GOS is increasing its capacity to enforce 
these principles and expects to expand law enforcement in the 
future. 
 
¶2. (U) In early 2000, then-Surinamese President Wijdenbosch 
established an anti-terrorism commission out of several 
government agencies with responsibility for police, security, 
military and intelligence functions with relation to 
terrorism.  Since that time Suriname has ratified six UN 
anti-terrorism instruments, although not Article 18(reftel 
para 10) related to terrorist financing.  Instead Suriname 
has implemented legislation to comply with obligations under 
anti-terrorism instruments.  Examples include the Money 
Laundering Act, the Report of Unusual Transactions Act, and 
the Seizure and Confiscation Act. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  While Craig's reassurances strike the 
right tone, and we agree that GOS intentions are sincere in 
this matter, follow-through on demarche obligations and 
multilateral commitments tends to be weak.  This is due in 
part to a tendency by the GOS to remain neutral on 
international issues, in part due to a genuine lack of 
capacity, and in part due to uneven political will.  That 
said, Minister of Justice and Police, Chandrikapersad 
Santokhi, is working to apply rule of law and has proved to 
be a valued partner collaborating on issues of mutual 
concern.  Undeniably, illicit cash couriers present a serious 
problem for the United States and Suriname.  We will continue 
to raise these issues with GOS. END COMMENT
