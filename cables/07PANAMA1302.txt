"The U.S. position sounds reasonable, and I think Panama 
should be able to support it," Panamanian MFA UN Security 
Council (UNSC) Senior Advisor Nils Castro told POLCOUNS on 
August 2 in response to reftel demarche regarding 
modification of the UNSC arms embargo in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC).  Castro concurred that it was 
important to support the DRC's democratically elected 
government, including its program of security sector reforms. 
 Castro agreed that an easing of the embargo on GDRC forces 
made sense.  Castro added, however, that USUN should work 
closely with Panama's Mission on this matter and undertook to 
speak with Panamanian UN PermRep Arias as well.
