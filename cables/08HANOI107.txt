Â¶1.  (SBU) The Embassy welcomes the opportunity for enhanced 
engagement in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) with potential Southeast Asian partners, and 
looks forward to further information from the Department on this 
initiative.  Vietnam has the goal of becoming an industrialized 
country by 2020.  Thus, the endorsement of the Meeting of the 
Council at Ministerial level (MCM) to give priority attention to 
Southeast Asia, "with a view to identifying countries for possible 
membership" should fit well with Vietnam's economic goals. 
Moreover, the OECD is currently working with Vietnam on a Policy 
Framework Investment (PFI) assessment, with plans for a presentation 
of the report at the OECD in a couple of months.
