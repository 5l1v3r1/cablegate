SUBJECT: EGYPT'S EXPECTED CHANGES IN EXPORT SUPPORT 
QUESTIONABLE UNDER WTO RULES 
 
¶1.  (U) During a meeting on May 23 with key economic advisors 
and export industry leaders, Minister of Trade and Industry 
Rachid Rachid announced he will consider reorganizing the 
Export Support Fund, according to press accounts. The Export 
Support Fund is designed to increase the quantity and quality 
of Egyptian exports by providing production subsidies and 
other benefits to certain industries that are not in 
Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZ).  The Fund focuses on 
Egyptian textiles and automobile parts. Many factories 
located within non-QIZ industrial zones are receiving this 
support to encourage investment from German, Russian, and 
Chinese companies. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A USAID contractor working for the Ministry said 
that the program has been dormant in recent years and that it 
is unclear how Rachid's reforms will take shape.  In early 
2007, the Ministry announced that Export Support Fund 
production subsidies and reduced rents on land would be 
scaled down over the course of five years, contingent upon 
selected industries achieving export targets.  Subsidies 
begin at 10 percent on the value of the exports and will be 
gradually reduced to 6 percent in the fifth year before they 
are ultimately eliminated.

Dubious WTO Compliance? 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In response to our concerns about the program, the 
contractor was unsure whether the changes would be consistent 
with the GOE's WTO obligations, although Ministry officials 
claim their export support is technically compliant.  We will 
continue to monitor this program and any changes to evaluate 
their compliance with Egypt's WTO obligations.
