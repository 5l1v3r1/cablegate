SUBJECT: RUSSIA STILL UNDECIDED ON HELICOPTERS FOR UNAMID 
 
REF: STATE 02736 
 
We requested information from MFA International Organizations 
Directorate Counsellor Albert Sitnikov on the status of the 
proposals for Russia to provide helicopters to the UN-AU 
Mission in Darfur (reftel).  Sitnikov told us January 11 that 
the MOD was still considering two options:  A "dry lease," to 
provide the helicopters to the UN, with the UN finding pilots 
and logistics support from another source; and a "wet lease," 
in which Russia would also provide the technical maintenance 
teams.  Sitnikov said he expected the MOD would have an 
answer by January 15 or 16, but he could not say whether they 
would agree to provide the helicopters under either scenario. 
 We urged the MFA to weigh in with the MOD to support the 
provision of helicopters to UNAMID.
