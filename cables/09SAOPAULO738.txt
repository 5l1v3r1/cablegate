SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: COPENHAGEN CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT 
 
"Fiasco in Copenhagen" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo  (12-21) states: 
"....The Copenhagen summit was nothing more than loss of 
time.....The fiasco of the Copenhagen summit was greater than 
expected.  The failure was due, in large part, to a problem of 
organization.....the overcrowding disrupted the workings of the 
conference and ended in a confrontation between credentialed people 
blocked at the entrance of the summit and the police....In 
addition, the possibility of a consensus between 192 countries is 
always remote.....Even more importantly, there wasn't a solid 
technical document on which politicians could base their 
decisions.....Copenhagen was a chain of mistakes that needs to be 
avoided in the future.  The environmental threat is too serious to 
be treated by amateurs." 
 
 
 
 
 
"Indefinite Climate" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (12-20) says: "....We did 
not see significant progress [in targets for cutting emissions and 
providing financing and technology for poor countries at the 
Copenhagen summit].....In practice, Copenhagen almost ended in the 
total collapse of the U.N. system for dealing with climate 
change.....It had a few positive developments such as the return of 
the U.S. to negotiations..... Another new development was the 
European Union losing importance in the negotiations and the rise 
of India, Brazil and South Africa...."
