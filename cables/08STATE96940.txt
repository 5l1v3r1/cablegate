SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning provides updated information on 
the security situation in Afghanistan.  The security 
threat to all American citizens in Afghanistan remains 
critical.  This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel 
Warning for Afghanistan issued February 6, 2008. 
 
¶2.  The Department of State continues to strongly warn 
U.S. citizens against travel to Afghanistan.  No part of 
Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and 
the potential exists throughout the country for hostile 
acts, either targeted or random, against American and 
other Western nationals at any time.  Remnants of the 
former Taliban regime and the terrorist al-Qa'ida network, 
and other groups hostile to NATO-led military operations 
remain active.  There is an on-going threat to kidnap and 
assassinate U.S. citizens and Non-Governmental 
Organization (NGO) workers throughout the country.  Afghan 
authorities have a limited ability to maintain order and 
ensure the security of citizens and visitors.  Travel in 
all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe due to military 
operations, landmines, banditry, armed rivalry among 
political and tribal groups, and the possibility of 
terrorist attacks, including attacks using vehicular or 
other improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  The security 
environment remains volatile and unpredictable. 
 
¶3.  Kabul, in particular has seen a rise in militant 
attacks, including rocket attacks, vehicle borne IEDs, and 
suicide bombings.  The number of attacks in the south and 
southwestern areas of the country continues to be high as 
a result of insurgent and drug-related activity, but no 
part of the country is immune from attacks.  Over 100 
attacks were reported in Kabul over the past year, 
although many additional attacks were thwarted by Afghan 
and coalition forces.  An additional 4,400 attacks 
occurred nationwide during the same timeframe. 
 
¶4.  Incidents have occurred with some frequency on the 
Kabul-Jalalabad Road (commonly called Jalalabad Road). 
The road's use is highly restricted for Embassy employees 
and, if the security situation warrants, sometimes is 
curtailed completely. 
 
¶5.  Foreigners throughout the country continue to be 
targeted for violent attacks and kidnappings, whether 
motivated by terrorism or criminal activity.  In January, 
gunmen attacked the Serena Hotel and killed eight people, 
including an American contractor and a Norwegian 
journalist.  In April, an assassination attempt against 
Afghan President Karzai showed the continued desire of the 
insurgency to destabilize the Afghan government.  The July 
2008 bombing of the Indian Embassy in downtown Kabul, near 
many western embassies and Afghan Government institutions, 
demonstrated the ability of the insurgents to undertake 
assaults within Kabul itself.  Rocket fire and rocket 
propelled grenade (RPG) attacks have occurred with 
increasing frequency.  In August, three female western 
non-governmental organization (NGO) employees, along with 
their male Afghan driver, were gunned down as they 
traveled south of Kabul.  An American NGO worker and her 
driver were kidnapped in Kandahar in January.  Other 
Americans were kidnapped in Afghanistan in February and 
August 2008. 
 
¶6.  Riots and incidents of civil disturbance can and do 
occur, often without warning.  American citizens should 
avoid rallies and demonstrations; even demonstrations 
intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and 
escalate into violence. 
 
 
¶7.  Carjackings, robberies, and violent crime remain a 
problem.  American citizens involved in property disputes 
-- a common legal problem -- have reported that their 
adversaries in the disputes have threatened their lives. 
Americans who find themselves in such situations cannot 
assume that either local law enforcement or the U.S. 
Embassy will be able to assist them. 
 
¶8.  From time to time depending on current security 
conditions, the U.S. Embassy places areas frequented by 
foreigners off limits to its personnel.  Potential target 
areas include key national or international government 
establishments, international organizations and other 
locations with expatriate personnel, and public areas 
popular with the expatriate community.  Private U.S. 
citizens are strongly urged to heed these restrictions as 
well and may obtain the latest information by consulting 
the embassy website below. 
 
¶9.  The United States Embassy's ability to provide 
emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in 
Afghanistan is limited, particularly for those persons 
outside the capital.  U.S. citizens who choose to visit or 
remain in Afghanistan despite this Travel Warning are 
encouraged to register with the U.S. Embassy through the 
State Department's travel registration website, 
(https://travelregistration.state.gov) and to obtain 
updated information on travel and security within 
Afghanistan.  Americans without Internet access may 
register directly with the U.S. Embassy.  Registering 
makes it easier for the Embassy to contact Americans in 
case of emergency.  The U.S. Embassy is located at Great 
Masood Road between Radio Afghanistan and the Ministry of 
Public Health (the road is also known as Bebe Mahro 
(Airport Road), Kabul.  The phone number is +93-70-108-001 
or +93-70-108-002; the Consular Section can be reached for 
after-hours emergencies at +93-70-201-908.  The Embassy 
website is http://afghanistan.usembassy.gov. 
 
¶10.  Updated information on travel and security in 
Afghanistan may be obtained from the Department of State 
by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the United States 
and Canada or, for callers outside the United States and 
Canada, a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444.  For 
further information, please consult the Country Specific 
Information for Afghanistan and the current Worldwide 
Caution, which are available on the Bureau of Consular 
Affairs Internet website at http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶11.  Minimize considered.
