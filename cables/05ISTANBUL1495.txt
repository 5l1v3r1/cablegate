¶1.  (U) 30 of the 71 defendants in the November 2003 Istanbul 
bombings were brought before Istanbul's Heavy Penal Court 
(Agir Ceza Mahkemesi) No. 10 for their closing statements on 
August 27.  Their lawyers reiterated that the attacks were 
not targeted at the Turkish Republic but at the US and its 
strategic allies.  The lawyers also said two suspected 
members of the cell, Saadettin Akdas and Burhan Kus, had been 
caught and interrogated in Iraq, and asked that their 
statements be included in the court file.  The court agreed 
to ask for the statements from the Interior Ministry, but 
refused the defendants' request to be allowed to benefit from 
Turkey's recent Repentance Law.  The trial was then postponed 
to October 10.
