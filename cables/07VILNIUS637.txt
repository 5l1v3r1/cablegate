USG'S CONCERNS ABOUT IAEA'S PLAN FOR IRAN 
 
REF: A. STATE 124823

     ¶C. STATE 123352 
 
¶1.  Charge delivered ref A points to Zygimantas Pavilionis, 
Under Secretary in the MFA, on September 10.  We delivered 
ref B and C points at the working level to Rimgaile 
Karciauskaite, Second Secretary in the MFA's Arms Control, 
Non-proliferation and Disarmament Division, on September 6. 
Karciauskaite told us the GOL agrees that meeting UNSC 
requirements and the additional protocol concerns should be 
taken into consideration in the IAEA's plan for Iran.  We 
have discussed the issue of bilateral contact between the GOL 
and the GOI on several occasions with Lina Antanaviciene, 
Director of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Pacific 
Department. 
 
¶2.  Karciauskaite also told us that the Iranian delegation 
that had been scheduled to meet with GOL officials on 
September 7 cancelled its visit.  Karciauskaite said perhaps 
the cancellation was because of the low level officials that 
the GOL offered for meetings.  The GOL did not offer 
requested meetings with the Foreign Minister, the Speaker of 
the Parliament, and the deputy Foreign Minister.  The GOL did 
agree to a requested meeting with the Chairman of the 
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee and offered a meeting 
with one of the MFA's Under Secretaries.
