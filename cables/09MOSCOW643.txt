¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-user, Altonika Ltd., Moscow, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D411660 as the ultimate 
consignee of a 14-BIT 40 MSPS analog to digital converter. This item 
is controlled for national security and nuclear non-proliferation 
reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Analog Devices, Inc., 3 
Technology Way, Norwood, MA 02062. 
 
¶3. On March 2, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of Altonika Ltd., 42 Varshavskoya Shosse, Building 7, 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Anna Shevtsova, 
Head of Purchasing Department. 
 
¶4.  Altonika Ltd was founded in 1987 as a security alarm system 
company.  Altonika Ltd employs more than 700 people and produces 
radio networks for various ministries in Russia.  Their radio 
network systems are in use by the railroads, fire rescue, police, 
and in security alarm systems for buildings and automobiles. 
Altonika Ltd also produces radio frequency medical devices. Altonika 
Ltd does no military contract work and sells their systems only 
within the CIS countries. 
 
¶5.  Anna Shevtsova advised the Export Control Team that the 
commodity in reftel will be used as a part in a base radio channel 
station for the purpose of transmitting fire-security alarms.  The 
transmitting devices will be installed at various structural 
facilities, not vehicles as indicated in reftel.  Signals from these 
devices are transferred to the base station via radio channel.  The 
base station analyzes the signals using the 433.92 MHz frequency 
range for which Altonika Ltd is fully licensed. 
 
¶6. Anna Shevtsova further advised that the base station uses a 
service band of 2X200 kHz.  The analog-to-digital converter usage 
will be in the frequency range of 0 MHz to 32 MHz. Altonika Ltd 
plans to install 3 micro circuits AD6644AST-65 into the main base 
station.  Sales of the base stations are expected to be 
approximately 200 pieces per year. 
 
¶7.  Altonika Ltd has the commercial sophistication for the reftel 
commodity and a legitimate need and end use.  POC Shevtsova was not 
evasive in her answers to the Export Control Team, and she provided 
the team with a tour of the Altonika Ltd facilities. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Altonika Ltd, Moscow, Russia, as 
reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
requested that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application.
