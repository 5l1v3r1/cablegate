Post contacted ROYG Ministry of Trade as well as prominent 
business people in Yemen and informed them of the upcoming 
U.S. Arab economic forum in Houston, Texas and encouraged 
them to send a delegation to the event to represent Yemen. 
They were interested in the event but due to the lack of 
funding assistance available, no official delegation or 
individual business people from Yemen will be able to attend 
the forum. We have heard informally that Yemen Ambassador to 
the United States, Mr. Abdulwahab AlHajjri, plans to attend 
on behalf of the ROYG.  Post requests notification if funding 
assistance becomes available.
