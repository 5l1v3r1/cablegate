SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - APPROACHING THE EU IN ADVANCE 
OF THE MAY 14-15 FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING (GAERC) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 60948 
 
¶1. (U) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Finnish 
Deputy European Correspondent Tanja Jaaskelainen May 10. 
She offered the following comments: 
 
¶2. (SBU) SERBIA: Jaaskelainen predicted extensive 
discussions of how the EU should respond if the Serbs 
miss the May 15 constitutional deadline for the 
formation of a new government.  A general statement of 
the EU's desire to work closely with a pro-Western 
government that embraces a European perspective is 
likely.  However, some member states are pressing for a 
forward-leaning statement on the Stability and 
Association Agreement (SAA), in hopes that it might 
positively influence the government formation process. 
Consensus on such a statement is unlikely because 
several MS believe it will have no impact on the Serbs. 
The Finns also oppose it because, in the absence of a 
Serbian government, the EU has been unable to address 
its ICTY concerns with the Belgrade.  Jaaskelainen also 
opined that the FMs will have to discuss at least 
informally some sort of "Plan B" in response to the 
strong possibility that the Serbs will miss the May 15 
deadline and need to call new elections. 
 
¶3. (SBU) KOSOVO: EU unity behind Ahtisaari's 
recommendations remains a key Finnish national priority. 
German Presidency efforts have led to "some signs of 
improvement" within the Union, she said, and EU unity at 
the UNSC appears to be holding.  Jaaskelainen warmly 
welcomed US "optimism" regarding eventual participation 
in the planned Kosovo ESDP operation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) RUSSIA-EU SUMMIT and ESTONIA: The Bronze Statue 
incident in Estonia will likely be raised.  Finland 
would support a very strong statement from the EU 
indicating that "Russia's intimidation toward Estonia 
does not match the EU's idea of a strategic partnership" 
between Russia and the EU, Jaaskelainen said. 
 
¶5. (SBU) RUSSIA-EU SUMMIT and KOSOVO: Also regarding the 
Summit, Jaaskelainen agreed fully that the Summit must 
be used as an opportunity for urging the Russians to 
allow a UNSCR on Kosovo to go forward.  In Finland's 
view, the EU must also continue to remind Moscow that we 
do not accept the argument that Kosovo sets a precedent 
for the "frozen conflicts."
