REF: STATE 48615 
 
(U) On May 8 poloff delivered reftel demarche to Jonas 
Wendel, Secretary of the Middle East Section at the MFA. 
Wendel said Sweden is aware of the 60-day reporting 
requirement, but any response to UNSCR 1803 would be through 
the EU.  He said Slovenia, the current EU President, must 
first propose a political response, which the EU members 
would discuss.  Wendel believes that there is common ground 
in support of UNSR 1803, but other issues have taken 
precedence, resulting in no time to discuss fully the 
resolution.
