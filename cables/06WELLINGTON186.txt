SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND PREFERS NOT TO HOST MOU SIGNING 
CEREMONY FOR REGIONAL MOVEMENT ALERT LIST SYSTEM (RMAL) ON 
MARCH 20, 2006 
 
REF: SECSTATE 37177 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Pol-Econ Couns discussed the proposed RMAL signing 
ceremony with John Roseveare of New Zealand's Department of 
Labour (DoL).  Roseveare said that although GNZ officials had 
originally proposed the signing ceremony take place during 
A/S Hill's visit, they now believe this would not be ideal. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Firstly, GNZ prefers to de-couple the signing from 
the celebration ceremony/press announcement, so that the MOU 
can be signed as soon as possible.  According to Roseveare, 
this will insure that there is enough time to test the 
system, including with Australia, before the scheduled March 
31 operational date.  Secondly, GNZ would prefer to schedule 
the ceremony for a later date, probably March 27 or later. 
This will enable officials to ensure before they host the 
ceremony that the system will be up and running as scheduled. 
 It will also be more newsworthy for journalists if ceremony 
and start-up date are closer.  Finally, Roseveare says a 
later date will give GNZ more time to organize the event. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Roseveare said GNZ would appreciate receiving the 
MOU as soon as possible so that GNZ officials can sign it. 
Once received, Post will continue to work with GNZ to help 
ensure the MOU is signed, announced, and implemented on 
schedule.
