E.O. 12958: DECL: 2019/11/12 
TAGS: PREL EINV MARR PHUM EAID EC
SUBJECT: National Assembly President Cordero's Meeting with 
Ambassador 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Heather Hodges, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  National Assembly President Cordero indicated he 
shared some of the Ambassador's concern about the GOE's decision to 
terminate the BIT and promised to discuss it with President Correa. 
He disowned the report by the former head of the International 
Relations Commission alleging thousands of deaths caused by the 
FOL, and said that the Assembly would responsibly manage the issue. 
He blamed the executive branch for the delay in approving 14 laws 
the Constitution said must be passed by October 14, and promised a 
response to USAID's assistance proposal.  End Summary. 
 
 
Bilateral Investment Treaty Termination 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) In a November 6 meeting, the Ambassador raised USG concern 
over the GOE decision to cancel the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral 
Investment Treaty (BIT) (Ref A).  National Assembly President 
Fernando Cordero responded that termination of 13 such agreements 
is now being debated by the International Relations Commission 
headed by Fernando Bustamante, based on the constitutional 
requirement.  He argued that the terminations would have no 
immediate effect.  The Ambassador countered that in fact the effect 
on potential new investors would be immediate.  Cordero expressed 
concern about this possibility, calling the GOE's decision 
inappropriate and highlighting the need for renegotiation before 
termination. 
 
¶3.  (C) The Ambassador pointed out that the MFA had told her that 
under a new investment agreement, the U.S. would be expected to 
direct investment to areas targeted under the GOE's National 
Development Plan.  Cordero termed this a strange idea.  He promised 
he would discuss concerns over termination of the BIT with 
President Correa the following week.  Cordero noted that the 
Assembly had ten business days starting on November 9 to consider 
the GOE's intention to terminate the agreements.  He indicated that 
he thought a solution would be possible. 
 
 
FOL Report 
---------- 
 
¶4.  (C) The Ambassador then turned to the allegations by the 
International Relations Commission of the Legislative Commission 
that the U.S. Forward Operating Location (FOL) in Manta had caused 
the sinking of many boats and thousands of deaths (Ref B).  She 
emphasized that there was no basis for such allegations.  (Note: 
The Legislative Commission was the interim legislative body, now 
replaced by the National Assembly.)  Cordero replied that the 
Legislative Commission had not made any pronouncement on this 
issue, that instead the then head of the International Relations 
Commission issued a report on a personal basis.  He said the report 
had been submitted to the Prosecutor General's office and that the 
legislature's role had ended there. 
 
¶5.  (C) The Ambassador noted that there may had been boardings of 
fishing boats based on suspicion of their carrying illicit drugs, 
and that boardings were done in coordination with Ecuadorian 
authorities.  She stressed that the incidents were too complicated 
to treat politically and were best handled by the Prosecutor 
General's office.  She pointed out that International Relations 
Commission president Fernando Bustamante had told her that he 
planned to continue the investigation of the FOL.  Cordero said the 
disadvantage of the International Relations Commission was that it 
handled primarily treaties and had little role in formulating laws 
(the implication being that the Commission had nothing else to do, 
so was attracted to investigating the FOL).  He assured the 
Ambassador that any investigation would be responsibly managed. 
 
 
Timeline for Key Laws; USAID Assistance Proposal 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6.  (C) Seeking to explain the National Assembly's failure to pass 
11 of 14 laws that the Constitution required be approved by October 
14, Cordero placed the blame on the Executive, saying that four of 
the draft laws did not reach the Assembly until a month after it 
convened on July 31, which did not leave the Assembly enough time. 
He said eight of the laws were now already under consideration by 
the plenary, and two of those were now undergoing the second 
plenary debate.  Cordero explained that the Assembly had carefully 
planned to have adequate time to pass all required laws by the new 
deadline it had set of February 2010. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) USAID's Sergio Guzman thanked Cordero for his assistance 
in appointing a point of contact for USAID and explained that his 
office had sent over a proposal for possible areas of assistance. 
USAID is now waiting for the Assembly's comments.  Cordero seemed 
aware of the proposal and promised that the Assembly would get back 
to USAID the following week.
