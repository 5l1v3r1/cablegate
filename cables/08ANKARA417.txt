¶1. (U) Summary:  Civilian and military officials have had to 
respond to criticism from the opposition, reflected both in 
the mainstream and opposition press, that Turkey bowed to 
U.S. pressure to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq. The 
withdrawal occurred the day after Defense Secretary Gates' 
February 28 visit to Ankara.  At the same time, there was 
media speculation that the Turkish General Staff (TGS) did 
not inform President Gul and PM Erdogan of the troop 
withdrawal until it was underway, and indeed after Iraqi 
sources had announced it.  Opposition figures also criticized 
the government for pulling out the troops before all 
objectives were accomplished.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) All media outlets covered the withdrawal of Turkish 
troops from northern Iraq, with much speculation focused on 
the role the US played in the timing of the pullout. 
Mainstream Vatan criticized the government, noting that "the 
withdrawal came in the aftermath of US warnings for an end to 
the operations." In their view, that signalled "speculation 
that Turkey was acting according to US influence." 
Opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal, in a TV interview, also 
suggested the withdrawal was due to US pressure when he asked 
rhetorically, "Has the decision to withdraw been taken 
independent of the US, if so, when?" Mainstream Hurriyet 
noted CHOD Gen Buyukanit's statement that one third of 
Turkish troops had already left before Defense Secretary 
Gates held meetings in Ankara.  In an interview with 
mainstream Milliyet, Buyukanit noted the timing of the visit 
was "out of our control," adding, "We make decisions 
according to military expediency. I mean, we do not factor in 
whether Gates is coming here or not...Our withdrawal was 
perfect, smooth as silk.  Am I going to give away clues about 
the operation?"  Islamist-oriented Zaman quoted CJCS Admiral 
Mullen as saying "The US did not give Turkey any dates for 
withdrawing from Iraq." 
 
¶3. (U) Some commentators reported the government was kept out 
of the loop on the decision to withdraw from northern Iraq. 
Leftist Taraf reported the withdrawal of troops was a 
surprise to PM Erdogan and that the government was notified 
of the withdrawal only after it was completed.  Mainstream 
Aksam added Erdogan had no time to make adjustments to his 
address to the nation on February 29, in which he said 
operations were still continuing in northern Iraq.  The topic 
was brought up to CHOD Gen. Yasar Buyukanit in his interview 
with Milliyet, to which he reportedly replied, "It (the 
government) may not be aware of every minute.  But in general 
terms they knew what was going on."  He added, "Of course he 
(PM Erdogan) knew there would be a withdrawal.  But 
naturally, he would not know what is happening from one 
minute to the next...But in my opinion, what he said in his 
address to the nation about the operation continuing was 
correct in terms of operational security."  Islamist-oriented 
Zaman quoted President Gul who echoed Gen. Buyukanit, saying, 
"Of course I knew about the withdrawal...The operation ended 
the way it was planned.  Talking publicly about military 
plans would have jeopardized our troops in northern Iraq." 
 
¶4. (U) A number of media outlets were critical of the 
decision to withdraw troops and speculated that cross border 
operations have only been stopped temporarily.  Zaman 
columnist Yavuz Baydar wrote, "Some retired commanders openly 
regretted the troop pullout on Friday, calling it premature 
because the strategically important Zap area was not placed 
under the control of the Turkish Army."  Similarly, Vatan 
editor Bungor Mengi said, "The statement released by the 
General Staff shows that the continuation of operations would 
have been useful."  Adding to speculation of operations still 
to come, Vatan reported Justice Minister Sahin as saying that 
Turkish troops would go to northern Iraq again if necessary, 
while Milliyet wrote that activity at the border continues 
despite the withdrawal of troops.  Opposition CHP leader 
Baykal was also critical, telling a TV station, "the results 
are pleasing but targets that would provide a lasting 
solution could not be reached in 8 days."
