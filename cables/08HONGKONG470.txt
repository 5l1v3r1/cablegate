¶1. (U) Summary.  Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health, Dr. 
York Chow, has established an expert working group within the 
Centre for Health Protection (CHP) to study three recent 
fatalities during this current peak influenza season.  In a 
late-night March 12 press conference, Secretary Chow 
announced that all primary, kindergarten and nursery schools 
would be closed for two weeks, beginning March 13.  Both 
measures respond to growing public anxiety resulting from 
recent influenza outbreaks concerning young children, Chow 
said.  There is no indication that the virus has become more 
virulent than in previous years; influenza virus detection 
cases remain lower than in 2007 and 2006.  The Hong Kong 
Government has not yet formally notified the WHO of the 
current situation. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On March 11, the CHP established an expert group to 
investigate three fatal cases involving young children during 
the current peak influenza season (reftel).  The most recent 
fatality, on March 11, was a seven-year-old boy who had been 
admitted to the hospital with neurological and respiratory 
symptoms.  The expert group is chaired by University of Hong 
Kong Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, a top scientist and leading 
researcher during the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) outbreak in 2004.  The panel will draw upon experts in 
microbiology, forensic medicine, pathology and toxicology as 
needed to determine potential linkage between the cases, the 
virulence of the virus, and additional prevention measures 
that can be taken by the HKG.  Currently, there is no 
indication of a significant change in the virus that makes it 
more virulent than in previous years. 
 
¶3. (U) Secretary Chow, in conjunction with the Education 
Bureau, announced March 12 that all primary, kindergarten and 
nursery schools would be closed for two weeks, beginning 
March 13.  This action moves up and extends the previously 
scheduled Easter vacation period.  This closure impacts 
approximately 560,000 students at 1,745 schools, and aims to 
reduce the opportunity for contagion in primary schools, 
allow for cleaning of school facilities and allow for the 
virus incubation period to pass.  CHP predicts that the peak 
influenza season should last for several more weeks. 
 
¶4. (U) On March 13, Secretary Chow asked the the Health 
Department and Hospital Authority to begin compiling data on 
influenza cases in children, and reiterating that the school 
closings were a precautionary measure.  He also noted that 
the HKG has not yet formally notified the WHO of the 
situation in Hong Kong, as this is not an outbreak of 
influenza. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  As Secretary Chow noted in last night's 
press conference, public fear is a key factor driving the 
HKG's increased measures and response.  The deaths of the 
three children are garnering extensive and emotional press 
attention; additional media sensationalism is further fueling 
citizen anxiety.  We see more people on the street wearing 
masks, and the topic is constantly in conversation.  The 
numbers of confirmed influenza cases and outbreaks continue 
to rise, although still lower than in 2006 and 2007.  The 
psychological and economic impact of SARS and Avian Influenza 
on Hong Kong memories inspire extreme caution and vigilance 
on the part of the government.  End comment.
