SUBJECT: YEMEN LNG PLANS SHIPMENTS TO CONUS, WORRIES ABOUT 
BEING BLOCKED FROM U.S. PORTS 
 
REF: SANAA 1064 
 
¶1. (SBU) Yemen LNG, the liquefied natural gas (LNG) company 
operated by majority shareholder French Total Oil, is 
planning to ship LNG cargos from its plant in Belhaf, Yemen 
to Sabine Pass, Texas and Everett, Massachusetts beginning in 
early 2010 (REFTEL).  Under the terms of YLNG's contracts 
with its clients, one third of the production is dedicated to 
GDF Suez and being sent to Everett Terminal near Boston, 
another third is dedicated to Total and destined for Sabine 
Pass, and a final third of production is being sold to KOGAS 
in Korea.  A U.S. Coast Guard port security assessment team 
visited Belhaf December 10-12 to observe YLNG security 
procedures on land and at sea during the loading of an LNG 
tanker.  Their assessment may have an impact on YLNG's 
shipping schedule to CONUS ports, especially to Everett 
Terminal. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Everett-bound LNG is being sold by YLNG on a 
"Free on Board" (FOB) basis, meaning that the LNG buyer, GDF 
Suez, assumes responsibility for the costs and risks of the 
cargo once it is loaded onto the tanker.  The Sabine 
Pass-bound LNG is sold to Total on an "Ex Ship" basis, 
meaning that the seller, YLNG, assumes all costs and risks 
for the cargo until it reaches the port of destination.  All 
three LNG contracts are 20-year contracts with fixed 
destinations, worth approximately USD 10 billion each at 
prices negotiated in early 2009.  If a YLNG cargo were to be 
blocked from entering Everett Terminal, or if lengthy 
conditions of entry were imposed upon Yemen-origin ships, 
Suez GDF would be in breach of its contract with YLNG.  If a 
cargo were to be blocked from Sabine Pass, YLNG alone would 
incur any losses. 
 
¶3. (SBU) YLNG management personnel have been aware of 
possible safety concerns in the U.S. about CONUS-bound 
Yemeni-origin LNG since at least June 2009, but only now have 
become extremely worried about the political and commercial 
fallout of Yemen-origin LNG shipments.  YLNG Commercial and 
Shipping Manager Jean-Pierre Cave (please protect) called the 
possibility of a YLNG cargo being blocked from a U.S. port 
"nothing short of disastrous" for the company's finances in 
the near term and its relations with the ROYG in the long 
term.  YLNG Deputy Head of Sales Olivier Jouny (please 
protect) told EconOff that "it would be nearly impossible to 
renegotiate our contract and divert our U.S. cargos for 2010 
to other destinations.  We'll probably have to write it off 
as a loss."  (Note: According to Post calculations using data 
from the ROYG Ministry of Finance, the ROYG will eventually 
receive approximately USD 470 million per year in direct 
revenue from LNG exports, or roughly USD 134 million for the 
GDF Suez portion of production.  End Note.)  YLNG management 
implored EconOff to have the U.S. Government keep any 
eventual decision to block YLNG cargos from a CONUS port very 
quiet.  Any such decision should be framed as a local, not a 
national decision, and should be ideally announced, if 
necessary, as a cargo diversion for any reason other than 
national security in order to protect YLNG's commercial 
shipping reputation with its other clients, Cave told EconOff. 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Cave (please protect), the schedule for 
the arrival of YLNG shipments to the U.S. for the first 
quarter of 2010 is as follows: 
 
-- January 31, 2010 (Sabine Pass, Texas) 
 
-- February 17, 2010 (Everett Terminal, Massachusetts) 
 
-- March 9, 2010 (Sabine Pass, Texas) 
 
-- March 25, 2010 (Sabine Pass, Texas) 
 
-- April 6, 2010 (Everett Terminal, Massachusetts)
