SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN RESPONSE TO DISTRACTED DRIVING DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 6703 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  ESTHOff delivered Reftel demarche to the 
directors of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport's 
(MPWT) Department of Transport and the Ministry of Interior's 
(MOI) Public Order Department.  Text messaging and cell phone 
use while driving are common in Cambodia but are not viewed 
by the government as high-priority road safety concerns when 
compared to other frequent unsafe practices such as vehicle 
overloading or the failure to use helmets on motorcycles or 
seatbelts in cars. Cambodia's 2007 Land Traffic Law 
officially bans use of telephones while driving unless they 
are part of the vehicle's communications equipment, but 
traffic police rarely enforce this rule. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  DATA ON FATALITIES, INJURIES, OR CRASHES:  The government 
is still compiling final statistics for 2009, but a 2008 
report by the MPWT, MOI, and Ministry of Health (MOH) stated 
that Cambodia has the highest fatality rate per 10,000 
registered vehicles among the ten ASEAN member countries.  In 
that year, there were 25,796 road traffic casualties and 
1,638 fatalities, resulting from 10,015 crashes.  The number 
of road traffic fatalities has almost doubled over the last 
five years.  Motorcycle users accounted for the vast majority 
of casualties and fatalities (77% and 68%, respectively). 
 
¶3.  There is little available data on the number of crashes 
specifically due to text messaging or cell phone use. 
According to the MPWT, in 2008 there were 53 accidents caused 
specifically by cell phone use.  However, road safety studies 
say that 98% of crashes were due to human error, and given 
the prevalence of cell phone use while driving, it is likely 
that more accidents could be linked to phone use.  The top 
three causes for traffic fatalities were speeding, alcohol 
abuse, and failure to wear helmets, followed by vehicle 
overloading, failure to respect right of way and dangerous 
overtaking.  (NOTE:  Most Cambodian roads, including national 
highways, are only two lanes and are traveled by all manner 
of vehicles, pedestrians, and in rural areas by animals.  END 
NOTE.)  Preliminary statistics for 2009 show the same trends. 
 
¶3.  AWARENESS OR EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS:  There is no awareness 
campaign focused on text messaging or cell phone use, as the 
priority areas are helmet use, drunk driving, and speeding, 
although a leaflet produced by Handicap International 
Belgium, which works with the MPWT and MOI on road safety 
issues, includes notes on mobile phone use while driving. In 
2009 the MOI launched a nationwide campaign requiring 
motorcyclists to wear helmets and use rearview mirrors, and 
for car passengers to use seatbelts.  The MOI reported that 
in January 2010 alone, traffic police fined 14,269 motorbike 
drivers for not wearing helmets.  MPWT officials claim a 
70-80% compliance during the daytime with helmet laws since 
the awareness campaigns went into effect, a marked 
improvement from only one year ago. 
 
¶4.  EFFECTIVENESS OF LAWS, LAW ENFORCEMENT:  Traffic police 
rarely enforce rules on cell phone use while driving, and 
while enforcement of helmet and seatbelt rules is improving, 
police are only posted during daytime hours, so nighttime 
accident and fatality rates have remained high.  The public 
also widely considers traffic police to be corrupt; when 
stopped, offenders can typically bribe their way out of a 
ticket. 
 
¶5.  PREVALENCE OF TEXT MESSAGING/CELL USE:  According to the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the 2008 census, 
Cambodia has 5.5 million cell phone subscribers, or one phone 
for every three Cambodians.  There are nine cell phone 
service providers, only four of which operate nationwide. 
Text messaging, or Short Messaging Service (SMS), is popular 
among cell phone users in Cambodia due to their relatively 
low cost compared to making phone calls, even though most 
cell phones do not have a Khmer-script keypad.
