SUBJECT: Media Reaction Sao Paulo: New Chavista Gambit 
 
Title- New Chavista Gambit 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (1-16) states: "Changes in 
[the Venezuelan] policy that can affect the President's popularity 
are expected due to Venezuela's economic degradation....With the 
worsening of the crisis, Chavez has eased attacks against the 
opposition. ...The latest polls indicate that the Venezuelan 
population, for now, does not seem to be inclined to respond 
positively to the new Chavista gambit [infinite reelection of the 
president] of making it possible for his new authoritarian project 
of perpetually staying in power to be feasible.
