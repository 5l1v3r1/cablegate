SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  A COALITION OF 19 EGYPTIAN HUMAN RIGHTS 
NGOS HAS PROTESTED THE GOE'S CANDIDACY FOR MEMBERSHIP 
(REFTELS) IN THE UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL (UNHRC) 
AND EXPRESSED "AMAZEMENT" AT WHAT IT ALLEGED WERE 
"FALSIFICATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT,S TRUE STANCE ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS" INCLUDED IN EGYPT'S APPLICATION. THE GOE HAS NOT 
ISSUED A PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE NGOS STATEMENT.  AN MFA 
OFFICIAL HAS PRIVATELY TOLD US THAT THE GOE IS UNCONCERNED BY 
THE CRITICISM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  IN A MAY 14 PRESS STATEMENT, THE 19 NGOS (LISTED 
IN PARA 7) CALLED ON ALL MEMBER STATES OF THE UN GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY TO UPHOLD THEIR COMMITMENTS EXPRESSED UPON THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL, WHICH REQUIRE THAT 
THEY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD OF THE 
NOMINATED STATES WHEN ELECTING ITS MEMBERS AND ARGUED THAT 
THE CREDIBILITY AND COMPETENCE OF THE UNHRC DEPENDS ON 
ELECTING MEMBERS WITH A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS AND COMMITMENTS. 
ACCORDING TO THE COALITION'S PRESS STATEMENT, "INCORPORATING 
STATES THAT ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR SEVERE HOSTILITY TOWARDS 
HUMAN RIGHTS, THEIR BLATANT FLOUTING OF INTERNATIONAL 
STANDARDS AND NON-COOPERATION WITH THE UNHR TREATY BODIES AND 
ITS SPECIAL RAPPORTEURS WOULD UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF 
THE COUNCIL... (AND) WOULD HAMPER ITS ROLE IN IMPROVING HUMAN 
RIGHTS CONDITIONS, NOT ONLY IN THE ARAB REGION BUT ALSO 
WORLDWIDE."  THE STATEMENT ALSO CRITICIZED THE INFRINGEMENT 
OF "THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ON 
LEGISLATIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AS 
WELL AS THEIR PRACTICES THAT FLY IN THE FACE OF THE MOST 
BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES AND VALUES." 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  THE COALITION STATEMENT FURTHER ARGUED THAT 
REPORTS BY EGYPTIAN NGOS, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANISATIONS, AND UNITED NATIONS COMMITTEES AND UN HUMAN 
RIGHTS RAPPORTEURS, ALL "PLACE EGYPT AMONG THE WORST STATES 
FOR DISREGARDING HUMAN RIGHTS. THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT,S 
RECORD IS FULL OF SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE 
BEEN PRACTICED WIDELY FOR LONG YEARS." 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  THE COALITION STATEMENT LISTS TEN POINTS THAT 
CHALLENGE THE GOE'S STATED COMMITMENT (REF B) TO PROTECTING 
AND EXPANDING HUMAN RIGHTS. 
 
(BEGIN VERBATIM LIST OF TEN POINTS) 
 
FIRST: THE PERSISTENCE OF BRUTAL TORTURE IN THE VARIOUS 
PLACES OF DETENTION, AND THE IMPUNITY OF PERPETRATORS OF 
TORTURE ESPECIALLY IN POLITICAL CASES. BOTH LOCAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS (INCLUDING THE UNITED NATIONS 
CAT) HAVE PREVIOUSLY REAFFIRMED THAT TORTURE IN EGYPT HAS 
BECOME A SYSTEMATIC AND ROUTINE PRACTICE. 
 
SECOND: THE PERSISTENCE OF ARBITRARY DETENTION, GIVEN THE 
CONTINUED STATE OF EMERGENCY SINCE 1981. THE NUMBERS OF 
DETAINEES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE THOUSANDS, SOME OF THEM 
HAVE BEEN DETAINED (WITHOUT BEING CHARGED OR TRIED) FOR MORE 
THAN TEN YEARS. 
 
THIRD: TRYING CIVILIANS BEFORE MILITARY COURTS AND DENYING 
THEM THEIR RIGHT TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE A COMPETENT JUDGE. THIS 
INCLUDED REFERRING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT OF THE OPPOSITION 
TO MILITARY TRIAL AND SENTENCING HIM FOR ONE YEAR IN PRISON 
BECAUSE OF HIS EXPRESSED OPINIONS. 
 
FOURTH: HARASSING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS AND 
RESTRICTING THEIR ACTIVITIES. THE LATEST OF SUCH INSTANCES 
TOOK PLACE A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN THE OFFICES OF THE CENTRE FOR 
TRADE UNION AND WORKER SERVICES WERE SHUT DOWN. PREVIOUSLY, 
THE OFFICE OF THE EL-NADIM CENTRE FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL 
REHABILITATION OF VICTIMS OF TORTURE AND VIOLENCE WERE BROKEN 
INTO AND SEARCHED. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE DAILY AND 
HEAVY-HANDED INTERVENTIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE AFFAIRS 
OF NGOS. SUCH INTERVENTIONS INCLUDE VETOING NOMINEES TO THEIR 
BOARDS OF DIRECTORS, DENYING THEM PERMISSION TO RECEIVE 
FOREIGN GRANTS OR ACCEPT LOCAL DONATIONS, AND REFUSING TO 
REGISTER NEW NGOS. LATELY THE MINISTRY MADE PUBLIC THEIR 
INTENTION TO MAKE YET MORE RESTRICTIVE AMENDMENTS TO THE 
AUTHORITARIAN LAW ON ASSOCIATIONS CURRENTLY IN FORCE. 
 
 
FIFTH: WIDENING THE SCOPE OF CRIMINALISATION IN CASES 
INVOLVING OPINION AND PUBLICATION, AND UPHOLDING THE 
CUSTODIAL PENALTIES IN SUCH CASES. THIS HAS LED LATELY TO 
ISSUING A PRISON SENTENCE AGAINST AN EGYPTIAN PRODUCER AT 
AL-JAZEERA CHANNEL WHO MADE A DOCUMENTARY EXPOSING TORTURE IN 
EGYPT. ALSO, AN EGYPTIAN BLOGGER WAS SENTENCED TO FOUR YEARS 
IN PRISON UNDER THE CHARGE OF DERISION OF RELIGION AND 
INSULTING THE PRESIDENT, IN THE CONTEXT OF A WIDER HARASSMENT 
OF BLOGGERS CARRIED OUT BY THE SECURITY SERVICES. THIS IS IN 
ADDITION TO A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPER EDITORS WHO CURRENTLY STAND 
BEFORE COURT FOR THEIR ALLEGED INSULT OF THE PRESIDENT. 
 
SIXTH: THE CONTINUED RIGGING OF ELECTIONS AND DOCTORING THE 
RETURNS OF REPRESENTATIVE ELECTIONS AND POPULAR REFERENDUMS, 
AS WELL AS PUNISHING JUDGES WHO EXPOSED THE RIGGING. 
MOREOVER, THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS PASSED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT LAST MONTH WILL ENABLE MORE OF THE SAME 
MANIPULATION OF THE WILL OF THE ELECTORATE. 
 
SEVENTH: SUPPRESSING THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AND 
ASSEMBLY, WHICH WAS EPITOMISED IN THE SAVAGE MASSACRE OF THE 
SUDANESE REFUGEES WHO HAD ORGANISED A SIT-IN IN ONE OF THE 
SQUARES OF CAIRO IN DECEMBER 2005. THE ATTACK ON THE REFUGEES 
CLAIMED THE LIVES OF AROUND THIRTY OF THEM. THE UNITED 
NATIONS HAS RECENTLY CALLED FOR AN INQUIRY INTO THIS 
MASSACRE, AND THE GOVERNMENT REFUSED. THERE IS ALSO THE 
EXAMPLE OF THE PHYSICAL ASSAULT AND BLATANT SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
USED AGAINST FEMALE DEMONSTRATORS AND JOURNALISTS WHO WERE 
PROTESTING AGAINST THE AMENDMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN 25 
MAY 2005. THESE EVENTS, DOCUMENTED BY HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS, 
CONSTITUTE THE BASIS OF A CASE THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING 
EXAMINED BY THE AFRICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES, 
RIGHTS. 
 
EIGHTH: AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION LAST MARCH IN A WAY AS TO 
ALLOW THE SECURITY SERVICES TO FREE THEIR HANDS FROM THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES THAT PROTECT THE RIGHTS TO FREEDOM 
AND SECURITY OF PERSON, PROHIBIT BREAKING INTO AND SEARCHING 
HOMES WITHOUT A JUDICIAL WARRANT, PROTECT THE RIGHT TO 
PRIVACY, AND PROHIBIT SURVEILLANCE OF MAIL AND TAPPING PHONE 
CALLS. IN THIS WAY THE NEW AMENDMENTS ENTRENCH THE 
FOUNDATIONS OF THE POLICE STATE. 
 
NINTH: INCREASING PRESSURES ON THE FREEDOM OF BELIEF, AND THE 
RISE IN DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES BASED ON RELIGION THAT ARE 
SOMETIMES BASED ON CONSTITUTIONAL OR LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS 
OR COURT RULINGS. 
 
TENTH: INCREASING PRESSURES ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 
JUDICIARY AND WIDENING THE SCOPE OF EXCEPTIONAL COURTS, 
ESPECIALLY MILITARY COURTS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE 
EXECUTIVE. 
 
(END VERBATIM LIST OF NGO ARGUMENTS AGAINST EGYPT'S CANDIDACY) 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  THE COALITION STATEMENT CONCLUDES BY NOTING THAT 
THE "UNDERSIGNED NGOS REALISE THAT THE CHANCES OF MAKING AN 
OBJECTIVE CHOICE FOR THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS 
COUNCIL FROM AMONG THE ARAB COUNTRIES ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT, 
GIVEN THAT MOST OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THOSE COUNTRIES, 
PERHAPS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MOROCCO, LEBANON AND 
MAURITANIA, ARE CONSIDERED AMONG THE WORST IN TQ WORLD IN 
THEIR DISREGARD OF HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS.  DESPITE THE 
DIFFICULTIES THAT THIS WILL INVOLVE FOR THE UN GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY, WE BELIEVE THAT VOTING FOR THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT 
WOULD IMPLY AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR IT AND SIMILAR GOVERNMENTS 
TO PERSIST IN THEIR PRACTICES AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS." 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  THE GOE HAS NOT ISSUED ANY FORMAL RESPONSE TO THE 
COALITION STATEMENT.  AN MFA OFFICIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND MULTILATER ISSUES TOLD US ON MAY 15 THAT THE GOE 
IS NOT CONCERNED BY THE STATEMENT BY THE NGOS; THAT GROUPS 
SUCH AS THESE ARE ENGAGED IN "SELLING INFORMATION" TO 
BESMIRCH EGYPT'S REPUTATION; THAT THE GOE HAS "EVERY 
QUALIFICATION" TO BE A MEMBER OF THE UNHRC; AND THAT IT 
EXPECTS TO SUCCEED IN ITS EFFORT TO WIN A SEAT.

PAST OR CURRENT RECIPIENTS OF USAID OR MEPI FUNDING FOR THEIR
