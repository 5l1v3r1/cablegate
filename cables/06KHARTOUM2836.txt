¶1.  AMIS contacts report that on the morning of December 10, 
mourners gathered at the burial of 15 people killed during the Sirba 
incident (reftel) assaulted members of an AMIS patrol observing the 
event.  Shortly thereafter, the same mob burned down the El Geneina 
Civilian Police (CIVPOL) station.  AMIS ordered the patrol and all 
other AMIS staff back to the camp in anticipation of further 
unrest. 
 
¶2.  At approximately 10:30 a.m., AMIS activated the camp alarm when 
troops observed men armed with machine guns and RPGs to the west of 
the camp.  A group of about 100 people then approached the base on 
the north side; the Sector Commander approached them to attempt to 
calm the situation down.  They assaulted him and took his Thuraya 
phone.  At 11:40 a.m., the gunmen attacked the AMIS camp with RPGs 
and AK-47 fire; while most shots were fired overhead, some rounds 
impacted inside the camp. 
 
¶3.  According to AMIS contacts, the mob on the north side threw 
rocks at the soldiers and attempted to penetrate the concertina 
wire.  The AMIS protection force troops shot two protesters, killing 
one and injuring one.  A second protestor was killed when he 
attempted to take a weapon from one of the AMIS soldiers and the 
weapon discharged.  The mob dispersed after the three men fell. 
Firing continued until 12:20 p.m., when three truckloads of Sudanese 
Armed Forces troops arrived to disperse the remaining demonstrators. 
 At 1:00 p.m., the AMIS protection force physician arrived and 
administered medical attention to the wounded man, who had been shot 
in the shoulder. 
 
¶4.  At 2:00 p.m., Fursha tribal leaders from the Sirba region and 
other civil authorities visited the camp and expressed their support 
for AMIS.  They could not identify the two dead, but stated that the 
wounded man was from El Fasher.
