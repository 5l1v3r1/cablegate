"2/28" Memorial Activities Promoting Independence? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) spokesman Li Weiyi held 
at the February 28 press conference that the Mainland 
has always viewed the "2/28 incident" of 1947 as a day 
on which Taiwan compatriots resisted the KMT in an act 
of patriotism and democracy, when asked for comment on 
planned memorial activities which some view as 
promoting "Taiwan independence."  Li warned that using 
the day's events to push for "Taiwan independence" 
would bring harm to the people of Taiwan and expressed 
hope that all Taiwan compatriots will continue to work 
toward increasing exchanges and development of cross- 
Strait relations. 
 
TAO Official to Visit Taiwan 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. TAO Economic Director He Shizhong will travel to 
Taiwan to further cross-Strait exchanges, confirmed 
Li, though not specifying Director He's dates of 
travel. 
 
Fervent Opposition to "De Jure Taiwan Independence" 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. Li reiterated the Mainland's fervent opposition to 
Taiwan's "name revisions" and other behavior promoting 
"de jure independence," in response to a question as 
to why the TAO continued to label 2007 a "key year" in 
cross-Strait relations. 
 
Anniversary of Anti-Secession Law 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Asked by a Beijing news reporter if there were any 
activities planned during this year's National 
People's Congress session (which begins on March 5) to 
mark the two-year anniversary of the Anti-Secession 
Law, Li said there were none as far as he knew. 
 
KMT-CCP Exchange 
---------------- 
 
¶6. Asked for a reaction to comments by a KMT 
legislator that April would be an important time for 
cross-Strait relations, Li spoke of the successful 
trade and culture forum resulting from last year's 
KMT-CCP meetings and expressed hope that such 
cooperation will continue this year. 
 
Holiday Charter Flights, Successful, Hope for More 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶7. From January 13-February 26, there were ninety-six 
direct charter flights between the Mainland and 
Taiwan, 97 percent of which were on Xiamen Airlines. 
Many Taiwan friends and business people expressed 
dissatisfaction that there were not more flights and 
cities involved, and the TAO hopes both sides can 
increase efforts in this respect. 
 
¶8. Reporting on the progress of Mainland-Taiwan 
tourism negotiations, Li stated that private 
organizations have held four consultations and made

some progress.  As soon as the two sides reach a 
consensus, Mainlanders will be able to travel to 
Taiwan, said Li. 
 
Olympic Torch Route to be Announced in April 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. Li announced that the route of the Olympic torch, 
specifically whether or not it will pass through 
Taiwan, will be released in April.  Li gave no news 
regarding the attendance of Taiwan businesspeople at 
next month's "two conferences" in Beijing, nor did he 
have information on the effect of China's recent stock 
market plunge on Taiwan's economy.
