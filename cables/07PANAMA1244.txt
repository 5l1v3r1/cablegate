SUBJECT: NAS PANAMA MONTHLY REPORT AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENTS: JUNE 
2007 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable provides a brief overview of NAS/Panama 
activities and major law enforcement and counternarcotics 
developments during June 2007.  In early June our key focus was the 
visit of Codel Meeks. 
 
UPDATE ON TITLE III PROGRAM 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) DEA and NAS arranged a meeting at the Ambassador's 
residence that included three Supreme Court justices and the 
Attorney General (AG) and her senior staff.  The Ambassador noted 
the importance we attach to the Title III (Matador) program, largely 
financed by NAS, which will soon be up and running.  The justices 
expressed their receptivity to the program and reached a clear 
understanding of procedures and responsibilities with the AG. 
 
DEALING WITH NEW SMN LEADERSHIP 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) NAS met with Maritime Service (SMN) head Rodrigo 
Cigarruista to discuss our support for existing programs. 
Cigarruista impressed us with a penchant for advance planning and 
efficient use of resources.  We welcome his commitment to enhancing 
internal controls.  Meanwhile, the investigation into illegal 
enrichment and corruption by former SMN head Ricardo Traad revealed 
on the order of $6 million in "unexplained" wealth.  We have been 
impressed by the dedication of the AG in investigating Traad, who 
remains incarcerated. 
 
COAST GUARD PLAN ON HOLD 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Senior GOP officials, including Minister of Government and 
Justice Olga Golcher, have indicated to us that the GOP plan to 
launch a coast guard (fusing the SMN and the Air Service, SAN) has 
been placed on stand-by.  The officials cite the number of items on 
the upcoming Congressional session agenda as the reason for the 
hold.  However, our day-to-day contacts in the public forces 
indicate a major reason for the hold was the resignation of numerous 
pilots from the SAN "in protest" of the plan's perceived bais 
against the interests of the SAN as an institution.  Further 
evincing this SAN dissention was last month's resignation of SAN 
head Jaime Fabrega. 
 
PTJ - HOPE FOR SURVIVAL? 
------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) We understand from senior GOP officials that the plan to 
eliminate the Technical Judicial Police (PTJ) remains firm. 
Nevertheless, the June appointment of the capable and dedicated Jose 
Ayu Prado (formerly the lead drug prosecutor) to run the PTJ offered 
a glimmer of hope that the institution might remain intact and under 
the direction of the AG.  Ayu said he is working diligently to weed 
out additional corrupt PTJ officers and improve the entity's track 
record on completed investigations.  NAS is working closely with Ayu 
to channel our assistance to the entity in the most effective 
fashion.  We agreed on the desirability of training for proven 
performers within the PTJ.  Even in the event of the transfer of 
most PTJ responsibilities to the National Police (PNP), those proven 
performers are likely to continue to serve law enforcement in some 
capacity. 
 
POLICE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Our law enforcement advisor traveled to San Jose in late 
June to conduct a first session of our Panama-based Police Executive 
Leadership Seminar Series (PELSS) for members of the Costa Rican 
Public Force (Fuerza Publica).  Our police modernization program 
continued to receive excellent press coverage as well as a strong 
public show of support from Government and Justice Minister Olga 
Golcher.
