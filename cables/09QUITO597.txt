SUBJECT: FOUR AH1N1 DEATHS REPORTED IN ECUADOR 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The GOE Ministry of Health (MOH) reported that four 
Ecuadorian citizens have died from AH1N1 influenza in the past week. 
 The cases occurred in Chimborazo, Azuay, Tungurahua, and Pichincha 
provinces of Ecuador.  Two of the cases involved patients who 
received treatment in rural private clinics and were identified as 
suffering from AH1N1 flu too late to receive appropriate treatment. 
Embassy medical personnel have learned that neither of these 
patients was treated with Tamiflu.  The third fatality was a 
74-year-old man who received treatment at a government-run hospital 
in the city of Riobamba.  This patient is reported to have had 
underlying medical conditions that likely aggravated his illness. 
The fourth case was a 48-year-old maternity nurse in Quito who also 
appears initially to have received inadequate treatment in a private 
clinic.  She was eventually diagnosed as suffering from a chronic 
lung condition and was transferred to a government hospital, where 
she died.  In response to these deaths, the MOH has reiterated to 
hospitals the need to refer suspicious cases for testing as early as 
possible. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The MOH reports that there have been 264 confirmed cases 
of AH1N1 flu in Ecuador.  The MOH suspects that an additional 100 
cases were likely AH1N1 flu, but testing was inconclusive.  The 
Embassy believes that many influenza cases go unreported, however, 
so the true number of AH1N1 cases is probably much higher.  The MOH 
believes that roughly half of the reported cases in Ecuador came 
from patients who contracted the illness while traveling abroad. 
The other half are believed to have resulted from person-to-person 
transmission within Ecuador. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ecuadorian Military reports 8 confirmed cases of AH1N1 
flu.  In addition, the Army base "Amazonas de Shell" in the small 
eastern town of Pastaza has been quarantined due to AH1N1 cases. 
Ecuadorian Military officials have told Embassy Defense Attache that 
the military is taking strong measures to contain the outbreak. 
1100 people are reported to work at the base, and the Embassy 
believes that everyone has been quarantined.
