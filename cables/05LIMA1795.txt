¶1. (SBU) On 4/15, D/Polcoun delivered reftel points with U.S. 
views on the April 28-30 Community of Democracies Ministerial 
to Foreign Ministry North American Affairs Director Nestor 
Popolizio, and to Human Rights and Social Affairs Director 
Carlos Roman.  Popolizio told Emboff that he expected Foreign 
Minister Manuel Rodriguez would want to lead the Peruvian 
delegation to Santiago, but that it would take a few days to 
work this out.  He said that given the nature of the pending 
bilateral issues between Peru and the U.S., there was a good 
possibility that FM Rodriguez would be interested in a 
meeting with the Secretary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a separate conversation, Roman told Emboff that 
he was putting together a proposal on the importance of young 
people and their preparation to participate in the labor 
market as a means of fortifying democracy.  He said that a 
draft was being reviewed by the Ministry and by the Peruvian 
Embassy in Santiago, and that he would be able to share this 
document with the Embassy within a week or less.
