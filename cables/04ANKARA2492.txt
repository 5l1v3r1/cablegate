¶1. On May 4, Embassy received a diplomatic note advising us 
of the Turkish participants in the subject conference.  They 
are: 
 
 
Yusuf Guney, Head of Department, Undersecretariat for Customs 
Cagla Tansu, Legal Advisor, Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Mehmet Ridvan Us, Foreign Trade Expert, Undersecretariat for 
Foreign Trade 
Mesut Ozturk, Regional Director (Mersin), Undersecretariat 
for Maritime Affairs 
Secil Tireli, Assistant Customs Expert, Undersecretariat for 
Customs 
 
 
¶2. Because the GOT was invited to send four participants 
(vice the five list above), the diplomatic note states, "Ms. 
Secil Tireli's travel and accommodation expenses will be 
covered by the Turkish government."  Please advise 
immediately if there is a problem with an extra Turkish 
official participating at GOT expense.  Embassy supports 
allowing the fifth participant to attend in order to 
encourage enthusiasm for the topic and GOT interagency 
cooperation. 
 
 
¶3. Embassy will forward travel itineraries for the 
participants separately.
