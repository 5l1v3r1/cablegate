SUBJECT: Ortega Dismisses OAS and Democratic Charter 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: RobertJCallahan, Ambassador, State, Embassy Managua; 
REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a November 28 speech, President Daniel Ortega described the recent Honduran elections as a political process lacking legitimacy, meant only to legitimize the coup d'etat. The elections, he argued, made it clear that the Inter-American Democratic Charter and the Organization of American States (OAS) were meaningless. He then warned the Nicaraguan political opposition not to invoke the Charter in the future. Rather than the Charter, Ortega said that each country should strengthen the will of its own people. End Summary.
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 28, President Ortega gave a speech at the 
signing ceremony for a loan from the Inter-American Development 
Bank (IADB).  While his speech began with comments regarding the 
IADB loan, he ended his remarks by discrediting the November 29 
Honduran elections as a "political process meant to legitimize the 
coup d'etat."  "At the end of the day," Ortega stated, "the coup 
plotters received Washington's blessing" and the Europeans would 
say "they might be coup plotters, but they're our coup plotters." 
Ortega said this was "The same phrase Roosevelt used when he said 
'Somoza was a son of a bitch, but he was our son of a bitch.'" 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ortega claimed that with the Honduran elections the 
Inter-American Democratic Charter was left in "shreds."  He said, 
"There is no longer any Democratic Charter that matters in Latin 
America.  It is more than evident that a declaration from the OAS 
means nothing.  What does this show us?  That we can no longer rely 
on these organizations."  Following this argument, Ortega warned 
the political opposition in Nicaragua not to invoke the Charter for 
Nicaraguan matters.  He said, "With what authority will they [the 
opposition] place a complaint [before the OAS]?  They should not 
invoke the Democratic Charter ... what Charter?  The only option 
left is to strengthen the democratic charter of each country ("cada 
pueblo")."  He continued, "Whatever circumstances Nicaragua finds 
itself in, invoking the Democratic Charter will have no value." 
 
 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment: This is not the first time that Ortega has 
criticized the OAS, nor the first time he has blamed the United 
States for what he views as the organization's failure.  What is 
new, however, is his criticism of the Democratic Charter. 
Recently, the opposition has begun efforts to present a united 
front against Ortega's authoritarian tendencies.  A week prior to 
Ortega's speech, Nicaraguan civil society and opposition parties 
held a protest march to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the 
2008 municipal electoral fraud.  With his November 28 speech, 
Ortega appears to discard the opposition's legitimate protests over 
the election fraud and discredit any international recourse the 
opposition might seek in the future for human rights violations or 
anti-democratic actions.  In short, Ortega is taking another 
oratorical step to eliminate any international obstacles to his 
future political actions.
