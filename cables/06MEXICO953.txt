SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. On the campaign trail the week of February 14, Felipe 
Calderon and Roberto Madrazo spoke on their reform 
priorities while Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) 
announced his "new" agenda, which centers around the idea 
that no "so-called structural reforms" are needed.  Calderon 
continued promoting private investment in energy, fiscal 
reform, Qbor reform, rule of law, and public safety, while 
Madrazo promoted more limited private investment in energy, 
and gave generic promises of improved security, and more 
jobs.  On February 20, Felipe Calderon presented his new 
foreign affairs advisor, Arturo Sarukhan, a well-respected 
career diplomat.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
AMLO SAYS NO TO REFORMS NEEDED 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) The three main presidential candidates continued 
touring the country on their campaigns the week of February 
¶12.  AMLO made the biggest headlines by claiming that "so- 
called structural reforms" to the Mexican economy - reforms 
that nearly every major economist and analyst believe needed 
to spur growth - are unnecessary.   AMLO also instructed 
Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), Workers' Party 
(PT), and Convergencia party lawmakers to vote against 
proposed reforms to the Fiscal Administration System (SAT, 
Mexico's equivalent of the IRS) and other financial 
institutions, as well as any proposed reforms to the Customs 
agency, or to the stagnant energy sector.  AMLO claims the 
proposal to make the SAT an independent body would only help 
tax evaders and protect those who, according to him, have 
been privileged with tax benefits by previous 
administrations.  He alleged that greater autonomy for 
Customs would only help hide corruption inside the 
organization.  For AMLO, fiscal reform merely represents a 
tax increase on the poor by taxing food and medicine, and 
the energy reform means "privatization" of the treasured oil 
and electricity industries.  He warned that that reforms to 
public pension systems  (ISSSTE and IMSS) would not pass 
should he become president. 
 
------------------- 
AMLO'S "NEW" AGENDA 
------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) AMLO called for a new agenda that would "leave 
behind the so-called structural reforms."  He said such 
reforms "are not structural, but rather regressive reforms; 
a recipe dictated by international financial organizations 
to countries."  The new agenda includes vague promises of 
economic growth, job creation, welfare for everybody, a 
fight against corruption, sanctions against white-collar 
executives, and fiscal austerity.  AMLO plans to save 
government money by reducing the salaries of the President, 
Ministers, Senators, Deputies, judges of the Supreme Court 
of Justice, and on the elimination of pensions to former 
presidents (amounts that are trivial in an overall budget 
approaching USD 200 billion). 
 
---------------- 
AMLO'S PROPOSALS 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) At a speech in the state of Coahuila, AMLO 
summarized some of his major campaign proposals.  He 
promised to increase the minimum wage above the inflation 
rate (apparently without considering the effects this might 
have on inflation itself).  He also promised to renegotiate 
NAFTA provisions on beans and corn, apparently ignoring the 
need for agreement by the U.S. and Canada.  He said that 
free trade in basic grains would not be effective in 2008. 
Pandering to his audience, AMLO promised to set guaranteed 
prices for beans and corn, and offered his support to apple 
and meat producers as well.  AMLO's plan to bring financing 
to rural areas involves allowing local cooperatives to 
operate regional banks.  On fiscal reform, AMLO would like 
to simplify the tax system through self-declarations of 
income and by taxing only those who have "sufficient" money 
 
MEXICO 00000953  002 OF 003 
 
 
to pay.  In the industrial state of Nuevo Leon, AMLO told 
businessmen that he was not against them, and that he would 
support them by reducing energy prices to turn Monterrey 
into the industrial capital it "once was." 
 
---------------------------- 
RAMIREZ DE LA O DEFENDS AMLO 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) AMLO's economic advisor, Rogelio Ramirez de la O, 
suggested that the private sector is indulging its 
prejudices in believing negative publicity painting as a 
radical socialist and an irresponsible spender.  Defending 
AMLO, Ramirez explained that AMLO's program to provide 
pensions to certain groups would only represent an 
additional 1% of GDP, while the candidate proposed to cut 
government spending by 2% of GDP.  Ramirez de la O said that 
AMLO's economic plan proposes to re-channel savings derived 
from cutting government operating expenses to public 
investment while at the same time seeking the participation 
of the private sector in such investments. 
 
---------------------------- 
MADRAZO'S THREE MAIN REFORMS 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate 
Roberto Madrazo laid out his priorities for Mexico: energy, 
security, and employment.  Providing a few more details than 
previously, Madrazo said he would revamp the energy sector 
by establishing strategic alliances with private partners, 
but always under the government control; eliminating 
unnecessary positions at Pemex; increasing public resources 
through amendments to tax laws; and by training managers and 
technical workers.  Madrazo said he would propose to 
Congress a new fiscal regime for Pemex and the Federal 
Electricity Commission without reducing transfers to the 
states.  He offered to promote autonomy and corporate 
governance for both state-run companies. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Focusing on rule of law, Madrazo offered to 
increase the capabilities of federal police, create a 
national intelligence system, establish a civil career 
system for police forces, and modernize state and 
municipalities police forces.  Madrazo would put all federal 
police forces would come under a single command.  Madrazo 
proposes to strengthen prosecutors' capabilities with new 
technologies, but he would also make them liable/accountable 
for the correct preparation of cases and the successful 
conclusion of criminal cases.  Madrazo promised to promote 
oral trials, a development with tremendous potential improve 
the judicial system's efficiency. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Madrazo offered to analyze and modify the country's 
labor framework to promote productivity and competitiveness. 
To improve employment opportunities, he proposed the 
creation of a national system that would advise the young 
population on feasible work sources in coordination with 
local government, businesses and other organizations.  To 
stem migration, the PRI candidate offered to create regional 
businesses to strengthen regional economies and proposed the 
creation of productive chains to guarantee the consumption 
of local products.  He would support business incubators for 
students in conjunction with universities and businesses. 
To gain the support of Congress, Madrazo said he would keep 
legislators informed through reports on the current economic 
situation and explain to them the benefits expected from his 
proposed reforms. 
 
------------------------------- 
CALDERON'S COALITION GOVERNMENT 
------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) National Action Party candidate Felipe Calderon 
continued to promote private investment in the energy 
sector, a reduced and flat tax rate, greater interaction 
with the global economy, government transparency, and a 
continuation of Fox's social programs.  Calderon also 
addressed the issue of how he would achieve consensus if he 
faced a divided Congress (as is nearly certain) after the 
July elections.  Citing the example of Germany's Angela 
Merkel, Calderon said that he would create a coalition 
government to gain the congressional support he needs to 
pass his reform agenda.

CALDERON'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS ADVISOR 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) In a press conference, Calderon presented his new 
foreign affairs advisor, Arturo Sarukhan, a career diplomat, 
albeit with only twelve years of service.  Sarukhan holds a 
degree in history from UNAM, an MBA from the Colegio de 
Mexico, and a Master's in international affairs from the 
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies 
(SAIS).  During the current administration, Sarukhan served 
as chief of staff for former Secretary of Foreign Affairs 
Jorge Castaeda and, until recently, as consul in New York. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
¶11. (SBU) Perhaps satisfied that the markets will not react 
negatively should he win, AMLO seems to be turning up the 
populist rhetoric.  His rejection of structural reforms and 
promises of government protections and handouts plays well 
to his target audience.  This could be the "real" AMLO, or 
it could simply be a campaign tactic to solidify his base 
and secure his lead.  Madrazo, meanwhile continues to 
struggle with PRI scandals, a lukewarm (at best) reception 
by voters, and a desire to avoid alienting leftist elements 
of his party who are opposed to needed reforms to the status 
quo.  Calderon offers more of what the Mexican economy needs 
and acknowledges his need for congressional support to pass 
is reforms.  However, he is failing to attract voters beyond 
his base which is currently not sufficient to win him the 
presidency.  End Comment.
