¶1.   THE LEAD STORY IN THE MARCH 16 EDITION OF THE 
    BULAWAYO-BASED GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "CHRONICLE" 
    ASSERTS THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPPORTS A "SECRET" 
    PLAN TO OUST PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE.  THE ARTICLE, 
    HEADLINED "MASS STAYAWAY PLANNED: BRITAIN AND U.S. 
    PLAN TO OUST PRESIDENT MUGABE," ACCUSES THE U.S. AND 
    BRITAIN OF "PLANNING AND DIRECTING" WORK STOPPAGES AS 
    "AN EXCUSE" TO LAUNCH "A MILITARY INTERVENTION AGAINST 
    ZIMBABWE."  EXCERPTS OF ARTICLE, AUTHORED BY "SPECIAL 
    PROJECTS EDITOR" INNOCENT MADONKO, FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   "LACK OF STRUCTURE HAS FORCED THE OPPOSITION 
    MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) PARTY TO ENLIST 
    SERVICES OF THE HEAVILY WESTERN-FUNDED NATIONAL 
    CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY (NCA) AND THE ZIMBABWE 
    CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS (ZCTU) TO MOBILIZE WORKERS 
    FOR MASS ACTION FOLLOWING DEFEAT OF ITS LEADER, MR. 
    MORGAN TSVANGIRAI BY PRESIDENT MUGABE, 'CHRONICLE' 
    LEARNT THIS WEEK.  THE MASS ACTIONS, BEING PLANNED AND 
    DIRECTED BY THE U.S. AND BRITISH GOVERNMENTS WILL BE 
    USED AS 'AN EXCUSE' TO LAUNCH A MILITARY INTERVENTION 
    AGAINST ZIMBABWE.  THE TERMS 'CIVIC SOCIETY' AND 
    'LABOR' ARE BEING BANDIED ABOUT AS THE WEST 
    ACCELERATES PLANS TO OUST THE LEGITIMATELY ELECTED 
    (MR.) MUGABE. . .  MUGABE CREAMED MR. TSVANGIRAI IN 
    THE JUST-ENDED ELECTION ON 9 AND 10 MARCH.  MOST 
    OBSERVERS EXCEPT NORWAY HAVE DECLARED THE POLLS FREE 
    AND FAIR.  THE U.S. HAS CONDEMNED THE POLLS AS 
    'FLAWED' SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE PLANNED MILITARY 
    INTERVENTION.  BUT THE BIGGEST HITCH OF THE PLAN IS 
    THE FACT THAT MDC HAS NO GRASSROOTS STRUCTURES HENCE

PAGE 03        HARARE  00706  181452Z 
    THE DECISION TO USE THE ZCTU AND NCA, BODIES THAT MR. 
    TSVANGIRAI ONCE ADMITTED ARE 'THE SOUL OF MDC. . .' 
    ACCORDING TO. . .SOURCES, WESTERN GOVERNMENTS LED BY 
    THE U. S. AND BRITAIN, WERE PRESSURING THE MDC TO 
    UTILIZE NON POLITICAL STRUCTURES TO AUTHENTICATE THE 
    VIOLENCE AS 'CIVIL UNREST' A MOVE EXPECTED TO FURTHER 
    CRIPPLE THE ECONOMY. . . ."
