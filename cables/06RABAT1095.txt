¶1. (SBU) Further to reftels, MFA Director of Arab and Islamic 
Organizations Hassan Hami contacted Poloff on June 5 to 
report that during the May 27 Morocco-Kuwait Joint High 
Committee meeting held in Kuwait FM Benaissa and his Kuwaiti 
counterpart Sheikh Sabah Al Jaber Al Sabah issued a 
communique supporting the new Iraq government.  According to 
Hami, the joint communique "welcomed the formation of a new 
government in Iraq as a new step towards enabling the Iraqi 
people to achieve their aspirations and calls for peace, 
stability and progress in the region."  There has been no 
mention of the communique on the official Moroccan news 
agency website, Maghreb Arab Press, however.
