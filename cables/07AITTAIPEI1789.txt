¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies August 9 
focused their news coverage on the meeting of Randall Schriver, 
former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and 
Pacific Affairs, and President Shui-bian; on a ruling by the U.S. 
immigration court to release fugitive Taiwan tycoon Wang You-theng 
on bail; on Vice Economics Minister Hou Ho-shong, former Kaohsiung 
mayor Frank Hsieh's deputy, who was detained for corruption; and on 
the results of Taiwan's university entrance examination. 
 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, the pro-unification 
United Daily News said in an editorial that President Chen Shui-bian 
and the ruling DPP's manipulation of a proposed referendum on 
Taiwan's UN bid has turned advocacy for Taiwan independence into an 
anti-America confrontation.  End summary 
 
"'Taiwan Independence' Turned into 'Anti-America[nism]'" 
 
The pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (8/9): 
 
"... Even Frank Hsieh admits that the [DPP] proposed referendum on 
Taiwan's bid for [membership in] the United Nations under the name 
of 'Taiwan' is only a campaign game.  Chen Shui-bian wanted to 
infuriate China.  But thus far China has not yet made any major 
moves.  Chen Shui-bian also wanted to provoke a counterattack from 
Ma Ying-jeou.  But the KMT 'followed suit [with the DPP].'  The 
Chinese Communists were not fooled.  Ma Ying-jeou did not play along 
[with Chen].  All of a sudden, it has turned out that Chen Shui-bian 
and the DPP are directly and acutely confronting the U.S. 
authorities ... 
 
"The Taiwan Strait is able to 'keep its status quo' mainly because 
the United States is holding the ladder.  Although he is well aware 
of this fact, Chen Shui-bian deliberately has been making the ladder 
shake fiercely as he stands on it.  This naturally angers the United 
States, which is holding the ladder from below.  Without U.S. 
support, Taiwan's international security framework would be totally 
de-structured.  Is it self-destruction for Chen Shui-bian and the 
DPP to fight against the United States? ... 
 
"Particularly noteworthy is that the 'proposed U.N. bid referendum' 
issue has not only resulted in a dispute between Chen Shiu-bian 
himself and U.S. authorities.  It has also developed into the whole 
DPP against the U.S. cross-Strait policy and deprived Frank Hsieh of 
taking an independent position toward U.S.-Taiwan relations after 
the wording of the [DPP's] 'Normal Nation Resolution' was leaked 
out.  This can be described as a major destruction of mutual 
confidence between the DPP and the U.S. authorities.  These major 
injuries have harmed Taiwan, the DPP and, in fact, Taiwan 
independence.  The reason is that, no matter what, 'Taiwan 
independence' has been turned into 'anti-America[nism].'  This 
violates all political rationality. ..."
