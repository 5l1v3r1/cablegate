SUBJECT: DECLARED AND LIKELY AFGHAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 
 
REF: KABUL 1440 
 
¶1. (SBU) Provided below, for addressees reference, is an 
update to reftel from June on declared and likely 
presidential candidates, with ethnicity in parentheses. 
Addressees should take care when dealing with those listed 
not to convey the misimpression of USG endorsement of a 
particular candidacy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) This list is not exhaustive and is subject to 
change.  Many rumored candidates have talked up their 
candidacies for self-promotional motives and may not intend 
to run for elective office.  Declared candidates are those 
who have made repeated, public statements regarding their 
intentions.  With no set election date, we do not yet know 
when the official filing period will begin.  Likely 
candidates are those Embassy believes are considering a run 
or who may be asked by political parties and factions to run 
as their candidate.  We list the candidates here recognizing 
some have very little, if any, base of support and would 
receive only a small fraction of the vote if they were to 
run.
