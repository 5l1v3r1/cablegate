SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050169368 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests AIT Taipei's assistance in 
conducting a pre-license check on application 050169368 for 
the export of an Advanced Weapon Boresight System and a 
Compact Field Tester to Taiwan.  AIT Taipei is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Lack of documentation from the Taiwan 
MND and unfamiliar foreign intermediate consignee, EZO 
Corporation.  The company has not appeared previous licenses 
nor have the company's bona fides been verified by a Blue 
Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION AIT TAIPEI:  AIT Taipei is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate authorities to determine if the 
Taiwan MND ordered the articles from unfamiliar foreign 
intermediate consignee, EZO Corporation  and if so, verify 
the amounts that were ordered and that the items will be used 
for the purpose stated on the license.  PM/DTCC also requests 
that post conducts a site visit to EZO Corporation in order 
to provide the Department with an assessment of its business 
operations and on-site security.  Finally, post is asked to 
assess whether the company appears to be a reliable recipient 
of USML items.  If a site visit is not possible, please 
inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does EZO Corporation have supporting documentation for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item?  Will EZO 
Corporation retain positive control over the articles at all 
times? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
 
END ACTION
