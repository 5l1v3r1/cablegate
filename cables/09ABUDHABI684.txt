¶1. (SBU) Summary: In meetings June 28 and 29, Central Bank and 
Ministry of Interior officials told visiting Staffdel Frantz the UAE 
is working with Afghanistan to disrupt illicit financing and drug 
trafficking.  UAE officials stressed the importance of developing 
alternatives for Afghans currently involved in drug production and 
expressed appreciation for President Obama's "new strategy" for 
Afghanistan.  One official urged that Afghan drug assets seized 
internationally be dedicated to funding Afghan development programs. 
 End Summary. 
 
CENTRAL BANK EFFORTS 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) UAE Central Bank Assistant Director and Head of the 
Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Cases Unit (AMLSCU) Abdelrahim 
Al Awadhi told visiting SFRC Chief Investigator Doug Frantz and 
Senior Investigator John Kiriakou that financial flows to terrorist 
groups in Afghanistan must be disrupted.  Al Awadhi outlined the 
Central Bank's efforts to prevent money laundering and terrorist 
financing, including plans to require outbound cash declarations by 
the third quarter of 2009.  Al Awadhi stressed that illicit Afghan 
drug production must be disrupted, as this is the primary revenue 
source for terrorists.  The UAE Central Bank has provided some 
training for Afghan banking officials, including the head of 
Afghanistan's financial intelligence unit.  Al Awadhi noted that 
MENA-FATF has targeted Afghanistan for technical assistance, but 
corruption and lack of capacity and infrastructure limits the 
effectiveness of training. 
 
COUNTER-NARCOTICS EFFORTS 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ministry of Interior (MOI) Director General for Criminal 
Security Khamis Binsuwaif told Staffdel Frantz that the UAE enjoys 
strong counternarcotics cooperation with a number of countries, 
including the United States.  As opium production in Afghanistan 
increases, the UAE has noticed a similar rise in drug-related cases. 
 Binsuwaif highlighted three ways to disrupt the Afghan drug trade: 
1) improve cooperation between countries affected by the drug trade, 
2) dedicate any narcotics assets seized globally to Afghan 
development, and 3) identify economic alternatives for Afghan 
farmers.  Binsuwaif said he offered technical assistance to 
Afghanistan during a positive meeting with Afghan counternarcotics 
czar Mohammed Daoud, but that communication was difficult and the 
UAE often relied on third parties like the United States.  Turning 
to cash couriers, MOI officials said that it is challenging to 
prosecute drug traffickers who follow UAE cash declaration 
requirements.  (Note: UAE law requires the declaration of cash in 
excess of AED 40,000 (USD 10,890). End Note.)  To be successful, the 
UAE relies on evidence from the US and other partners. 
 
DUBAI PERSPECTIVE 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Dubai Police Deputy Chief Khamis Mattar Al Muzainah told 
Staffdel Frantz that the majority of the "large quantity" of drugs 
seized in Dubai is transiting to other destinations, thus 
coordination with foreign law enforcement is essential.  Al Muzainah 
also reported having met with Afghan counterparts to discuss 
enhanced cooperation.  Although Dubai Police have a dedicated 
financial crimes unit, money laundering investigations are 
coordinated with the UAE Central Bank AMLSCU.
