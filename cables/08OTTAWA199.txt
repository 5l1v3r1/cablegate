¶1.  (SBU)  According to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) Policy Advisor on International 
Crime Kim Cowan, Canada shares the U.S. view that the Vienna 
Forum to Fight Human Trafficking is an expert/technical 
conference and should not result in a political declaration. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Helena Guergis (a Conservative Party 
Member of Parliament) will lead a 24-person delegation on the 
first day.  Carole Morency, Acting General Counsel at Justice 
Canada and head of Canada's Interdepartmental Working Group 
on Human Trafficking, will lead the delegation on the second 
and third days.  Other members of the delegation include 
Ambassador to the Permanent Mission of Canada to the 
International Organizations in Vienna Marie 
Gervais-Vidricaire as well as experts from Justice Canada, 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada, Status of Women Canada, Statistics 
Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency, and 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
Canada will also send representatives from the British 
Columbian provincial Ministry of Children and Family 
Development and two Vancouver police officers as observers. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Liberal Party Senator Gerald Phalen will represent 
Canada at the parliamentary forum.
