SUBJECT: UNGA RESOLUTION ON WESTERN SAHARA 
 
REF: A) RABAT 0983 
 
¶1. USUN is instructed to continue to work with all 
interested parties to urge them to reach consensus on the 
Fourth Committee Western Sahara resolution.  Mission 
should support any attempts to postpone voting on the 
resolution until consensus is reached. 
 
¶2. If, despite all efforts to postpone a vote until 
consensus is reached, a vote becomes inevitable, Mission 
is instructed to abstain.  If it must abstain, Mission 
should seek to minimize interest in the vote, downplay its 
significance, and should not issue an EOV.  Our goal is to 
keep the Security Council, not the General Assembly, as 
the focal point for Western Sahara.  If asked by the 
press, Mission should say that our vote reflected the fact 
that the UNGA resolution did not reference all UNSCRs on 
the matter. 
 
¶3. As they become available, Mission should continue to 
send negotiation updates and the latest version of the 
resolution as the text evolves to the Department (with 
info copies of front channel reporting to Embassies 
Algiers and Rabat).
