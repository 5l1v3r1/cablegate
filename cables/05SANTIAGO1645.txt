On August 3, conservative, independent "La Tercera" 
(circ. 31,834) carried an editorial entitled, "The 
Importance of a Stable Saudi Arabia."  Quote: 
 
"Saudi Arabia's stability has repercussions in the Middle 
East and worldwide.  It supplies 25% of the world's oil 
and has the planet's largest reserves. This alone makes 
Saudi Arabia's stability a shared international goal.... 
It is also the home of Islam's two main symbols, the 
cities of Medina and Mecca....  Today, its closeness to 
the U.S. has given rise to terrorist groups...whose goal 
is to overthrow the Saudi government for dealing with 
`infidels'--a source of inspiration for Al Qaeda, headed 
by Saudi Osama bin Laden.  Although Saudi Arabia has been 
formally at war with Israel since 1948, it is not among 
the countries that have promoted terrorism against the 
Jewish nation, which has had a moderating effect.in the 
Muslim world.  Its role was also crucial in containing 
the expansion of Iran's Islamic revolution in the '80s 
and in limiting Saddam Hussein's aggressive policies. 
There are no guarantees that royal family members will 
not engage in a power struggle.  Plus, the country is 
under the pressure of a demographic explosion and poor 
macroeconomic figures...putting it at a historic 
crossroads."  KELLY
