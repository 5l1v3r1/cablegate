SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR DVC WITH GREG NOTESS (First choice) or MARYDEE 
OJALA (second choice) -- REINVENTING OURSELVES AS INTERNET 
LIBRARIANS. 
 
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Post requests a DVC with Greg Notess, Reference 
Librarian and expert searcher from Montana State University, who is 
also a longtime information industry observer and owner of 
SearchEngineShowdown.com. 
 
¶B. PREFERRED DATE AND TIME OF PROGRAM, FISCAL YEAR, QUARTER: 
Request 3rd week of March (6:00pm Washington, DC; Indiana 5:00 and 
Montana 4:00 DST   noon NZ the following day). One hour; second 
quarter; FY2007. 
 
¶C. JUSTIFICATION OF PROGRAM: It is obvious that Internet 
technologies have altered the ways librarians work.  The amount and 
types of information available in digitized form have increased 
exponentially, presenting information professionals with challenges 
in finding, analyzing, managing, customizing, and sharing 
information; and the new realities of electronic research affect 
everything we do.  The new roles that are called for mean that we 
may not call ourselves librarians, and new resources change our 
approach to research.  Just when we thought we knew how the web 
works and what the Internet can provide in the way of credible 
resources, the game changes. We wake up to an Internet world where 
Google tests a new user interface; a student finds a new online 
resource we never knew existed; a corporate client informs us that 
he's subscribed to a database we already have in-house; and work 
colleagues all over the office think they can find it all on Google. 
Post would appreciate the opportunity to hear from Mr. Notess about 
the finer points of searching and reference work today and the 
challenges facing Internet librarians in this volatile world in 
which we find ourselves. We would welcome a discussion on the new 
realities of the Internet and how we must rise to the challenges and 
constantly reinvent ourselves as we cope with the new realities of 
how electronic research affects everything we do. 
We would also like Mr. Notess to discuss what librarians need to 
know to make searching really work; to see how hands-on information 
managers are implementing search software and getting results; to 
find out how to troubleshoot search problems and avoid glitches; 
learn how to upgrade or enhance the search solution that may already 
be in place; and to find out about next-generation search tools and 
developments. 
¶D. MPP THEME AND EXPECTED AUDIENCE: MPP GOAL 07-01 Mutual 
Understanding. Embassy Wellington's library and information 
professions' contacts will include representatives from the 
Parliamentary Library, the National Library of New Zealand, public 
libraries, and the university and special libraries in the capital 
city.
