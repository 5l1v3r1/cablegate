¶1.  (U) Summary:  At least four assailants attacked the U.S. 
Embassy in Damascus at 1010 local time September 12, using 
grenades, gunfire and two apparent car bombs.  One car

back gate escaped.  The Embassy will function at reduced

¶2.  (U) At 1010 local time, at least four armed attackers 
using grenades and gunfire attempted to explode two vehicles 
at the U.S. Embassy in Damascus.  A car bomb exploded near 
the front of the building, while a small van carrying a bomb 
crashed into the back gate but failed to detonate.  There was 
a prolonged exchange of gunfire that lasted approximately 30 
minutes.  Three of the attackers were killed, and one injured 
attacker was arrested by Syrian security officers, who 
responded quickly to the attack.  There are reports that the 
driver of the van at the back gate escaped.  No U.S. Embassy 
personnel were injured and the attackers did not breach the 
security perimeter.  One local guard, who was outside the 
building checking vehicles during the attack, suffered a 
gunshot wound and is in stable condition at a local hospital. 
 Another Embassy guard suffered shock.   Both are being 
visited by the Embassy nurse.  There may have been civilian 
casualties. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Marines reacted effectively.  Embassy staff 
stayed in their offices until it became clear that a 
non-detonated bomb remained in the attacker's vehicle at the 
back gate.  Then, after it had been determined that the 
perimeter was safe, non-essential Embassy personnel were 
evacuated from the Embassy and sent home.  Syrian security 
disarmed and removed the explosive device.  The Damascus 
Community School, which was scheduled to hold a half day 
today, was notified while the attack was still underway, went 
into lock-down, and then sent the students home.  After the 
attack, Embassy security personnel found unexploded grenades, 
as well as body parts. 
 
¶4.  (U) The Embassy will function at reduced staffing for the 
rest of the day.  Post is drafting a warden message, which we 
will clear with the Department as soon as possible.  The 
Embassy initiated the telephone tree and held an EAC, which 
will be reported septel. 
 
¶5.  (U) Charge met with Syrian Interior Minister Maj. Gen. 
Bassam Abdul Majeed in front of the Embassy as the Minister 
coordinated security operations.  Abdul Majeed pledged all 
efforts to secure the location, including the establishment 
of a security cordon around the Embassy.  The attacker who 
was arrested is providing information to Syrian security 
authorities, according to Abdul Majeed.  Separately, Syrian 
Assistant FM Ahmad Arnous called the Charg to pledge full 
security to the Embassy. 
 
¶6.  (U) Embassy Spokesman is issuing the following statement: 
 "The Embassy of the United States of America in Damascus, 
Syria, came under armed attack at approximately 10:10 a.m., 
local time, on September 12, 2006.  All Embassy personnel and 
their family members are safe.  One local Embassy guard was
