¶1. (U) Norway's Senior Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan 
Ambassador Janis Bjorn Kanavin told PolOff January 21 that Norway 
would send MFA Senior Advisor Helene Sand Andresen to the PRT 
Conference in Prague starting January 25.  Andresen told PolOff that 
Kirsten Gislesen and Colonel Roar Laugerud would attend from 
Norway's Ministry of Defense.  She added that no one from the PRT in 
Faryab (PRT Meymaneh) would participate, but that those attending 
had long experience working in Afghanistan and on Afghanistan 
issues.  Andresen herself worked in Afghanistan for several years. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kanavin also took the opportunity to emphasize GON views 
regarding the negative impact of PRTs substituting rather than 
supporting Afghan authorities, and the ineffectiveness of Quick 
Impact Projects (QUIPs) and development assistance, designed for 
short-term effects and outside of national planning and coordination 
efforts.  He referred to Norway's Faryab Province strategy, 
available at www.regjeringen.no, as a good outline of Norway's PRT 
goals.  He concluded by noting that the GON strongly supports 
maintaining a clear distinction between civilian and military 
efforts.  Comment: The MFA has over the past several months been 
mulling over the option of having its PRT civilian representatives 
share office space with the UN in Faryab.  However, security 
concerns have prohibited moving forward with the plan, as it would 
require the civilians to travel daily to and from PRT Meymaneh and 
the UN office in Faryab.  End Comment.
