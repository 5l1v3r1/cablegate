REF: SECSTATE 120288 
 
Â¶1. (SBU)  On November 25, we delivered the points detailed in 
reftel on the U.S. posture towards the Iranian nuclear 
program to Levan Nizharadze of the Americas division in MFA. 
We also noted that this information would likely be the first 
step as we continued to work with our international partners 
on the Iranian nuclear issue, and that we would greatly 
appreciate the support of Georgia now and in the future on 
this issue.  Nizharadze expressed his appreciation for the 
details, stated that he would immediately brief the relevant 
offices on the information provided, and promised to be in 
contact with us should any follow up questions arise as they 
compose their report for senior MFA officials.
