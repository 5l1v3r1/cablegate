SUBJECT:  SPLA/SSDR CLASH IN THE UPPER NILE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Senior UNMIS officials described to CG Juba a 
January 29 incident that occurred in the village of Ye, 
near Malakal, in the Upper Nile.  The local SPLM 
Commissioner, who claimed to be accompanied by 2,000 SPLA 
troops (a figure that UNMIS doubts), embarked on what had 
theretofore had been a successful campaign to disarm 
villages in the area.  After successfully eliciting 
cooperation from two villages, the SPLA force arrived in 
Ye, whose population did not wish to disarm.  A militia 
group known as the White Army opened fire on the SPLA 
force, and elements of the SSDF joined them. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A heavy firefight ensued, with significant 
casualties on both sides.  The UNMIS officials noted that 
the clash was worrisome in that the SSDF soldiers 
fighting alongside the White Army were from the faction 
that had, theoretically at least,  joined the SPLA, in 
effect turning the clash into an internecine affair. 
UNMIS flew General Simon Gatwich (check spelling) to the 
area by helicopter and landed near Ye in spite of the 
risk of taking fire from one side or the other.  Gatwich, 
who has thrown his lot with the SPLA, was a former 
militia commander from Upper Nile known for depredations 
in the Shilluk Kingdom in early 2004.  He still maintains 
considerable influence in the Upper Nile area and was 
instrumental in calming the situation in Ye.  Gatwich 
remains in the area for now as a precaution, and he has 
received high marks from UNMIS for his constructive role. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) We suspect that this will not be the last time 
that GoSS/SPLA DDR attempts spark violence with those 
unwilling to lay down their arms.
