¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada (parliament) passed 
legislative reforms on public procurement, business deregulation, 
and land and property title registration that had long been 
advocated for by the World Bank and USAID.  Analysts note that these 
three laws represent positive progress but that additional 
amendments may be needed to bring the laws into line with 
international norms.  One of the key intents of the new law on the 
procurement system, through which as much as 20% of GDP passes, is 
to reduce corruption.  However, the World Bank is concerned about 
the law's provision for what has been criticized as a 
non-transparent dispute settlement body. End Summary. 
 
PROCUREMENT LAW ADOPTED 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On February 11, the Rada passed a public procurement law, 
essentially restoring rules on procurement that had been in place 
before 2006.  In the new law, the Ministry of Economy is tapped to 
authorized procurements.  According to the law, the Ministry should 
streamline state purchasing by establishing competitive procurement 
methods and publishing requirements for tenders. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The passage of the law is a positive development and should 
help reduce, but not eliminate, corruption in the procurement 
system. In 2008, 20% of GDP passed through the procurement system; 
however, in 2009 the estimate is much lower 5-9% due to problems 
with the law and regulation of the sector.    Critics noted that the 
dispute settlement body, established under the Ministry of Economy, 
would be open to "political compromise."  Consisting of seven 
government members and seven independent experts, the body will be 
overseen by two Rada Committees.  The new law was supported by MP 
Irina Akimova and the Party of Regions.  However, BYuT MP Oleh 
Lyashko criticized the law for giving too much authority to the Rada 
Finance and Banking Committee, controlled by Party of Regions Mykola 
Azarov, and the Economic Policy Committee, controlled by BYuT's 
Serhiy Osyka.  Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has asked President 
Yushchenko to veto the law on the grounds that the dispute 
settlement body was deficient.  Yushchenko has not yet signed the 
law into force, but he is expected to do so. 
 
¶4. (U) The previous public procurement law was repealed by the Rada 
in 2008, after significant amendments in 2006 had made the law 
grossly dysfunctional.  In the meantime, procurement was governed by 
Cabinet of Ministers' resolutions that had unclear legal authority. 
 
 
AMENDMENTS ON PROPERTY RIGHTS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) A decade-long attempt to unify real estate ownership rights 
took a step forward on February 11 when the Rada amended the Land 
Code and the 2004 land registration law.  The law explicitly 
assigned overall authority for registration of ownership rights of 
land and buildings to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). 
 
¶6. (SBU) Having sole control over real estate registries, the MOJ 
could help establish a unified land registry, considered to be an 
essential condition for land to be openly and transparently traded 
in Ukraine.  USAID provided assistance on the development of this 
law, and is already preparing to develop unified registries in 
Crimea.  Once developed, the pilot projects in Crimea could serve as 
models for other registries throughout Ukraine. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Ukraine had maintained the obsolete Soviet-era system of 
separate land and building property registration.  In the absence of 
clear ownership titles, the Ukrainian property market was rife with 
shady deal-making, causing widespread investor frustration.  Turf 
battles between GOU agencies over authority to resolve claims had 
perpetuated the corrupt system. 
 
PERMITS LAW AMENDED 
------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The Rada also adopted legislation to simplify permitting 
for entrepreneurs.  The law introduced a "silent consent" principle 
on permit issuing and established regional permit centers. 
According to experts, however, efficient implementation of these 
provisions requires additional regulatory acts and legislative 
amendments.  Procedural issues over the subordination of the permit 
centers and the process for closing businesses are not clearly 
spelled out in the law. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.(SBU) These newly adopted laws send an important positive signal

to investors, who have long lobbied to reduce corruption and improve 
the business climate.  Nonetheless, the laws have deficiencies and 
inconsistencies, resulting from hasty political compromises made 
just days after the February 7 second round of Ukraine's 
presidential election.  If President Yushchenko indeed signs the 
laws into force, we should take this as a win for the economy and 
start work, including with our business community, to suggest 
implementing mechanisms or amendments where needed.
