"Copenhagen Depends on Two Numbers" 
 
Article in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (12-08) by Herton 
Escobar says: "The difference between success and failure in 
Copenhagen will be defined by two numbers.  The first one is.... 
how much developed countries will commit themselves to reduce their 
emissions by 2020.  The second, in billions of dollars, is how much 
these countries will give to the poorest countries as financial aid 
to promote clean development and adaptation to climate 
change.....The climate convention clearly attributes these 
obligations to rich countries....The pressure is on.  Copenhagen is 
the place.  And the time is now...."
