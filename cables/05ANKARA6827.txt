 ¶1. (C)  Charge re-engaged with Turkish MFA Middle East 
Director General Oguz Celikkol on November 18 and told him 
the USG is definitely not/not interested in a trilateral 
dialogue with Turkey and Syria, as the Turks had conveyed 
upon FM Gul's return from Damascus (refs b and c).  The time 
for talk has passed, she stated; it is time for Syria to take 
concrete actions.
