SUBJECT: CANADA'S VIEW ON PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
 
REF: STATE 80349 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 11, POL M/C discussed U.S. plans to raise 
UNDP accountability issues at the current Executive Board 
meeting in New York.  He spoke with Ferry de Kerckhove, 
Director General for International Organizations at Foreign 
Affairs (DFAIT) and with Roger Erhardt, Director General for 
UN Affairs at the Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA).  Following the points in reftel, he covered the Board 
of Auditors report, focusing on North Korea,s wrongful use 
of UNDP funds, and asked for support for the U.S. 
transparency initiative. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Both de Kerckhove and Erhardt reaffirmed that we 
were preaching to the converted.  Canada was fully in 
agreement with our approach to the UNDP,s accountability 
deficiencies.  Canada had joined the U.S. in criticizing the 
North Korean program at the last Executive Board meeting. 
Their delegation had already departed for New York for the 
current Board meeting and was working with the U.S. and other 
like-minded countries on ways to enhance accountability 
issues.  Erhardt promised to convey the points from our 
demarche to the CIDA representatives, who have leadership of 
the Canadian delegation.  In any case, Canada is on the 
record in favor of transparency. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Patrick Wittman (Director for UN Affairs), who also 
attended the meeting, said some in Foreign Affairs were 
concerned by allegations appearing in the press that the DPRK 
had used UNDP funding to purchase property in Canada. 
DFAIT,s International Organizations Bureau is not aware of 
what was bought and when, and would like some background and 
clarification in case the story gets legs in Canada and lead 
to a query by senior officials.
