REF: MANAGUA 301 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Late on March 18, 2009, the Government of Nicaragua 
(GON) released the official text of Decree 07-2009 that 
changed Nicaragua's visa policy.  Our unofficial English 
translation appears below.  The decree's fundamental change 
to Nicaragua's visa regime is that citizens from countries in 
"Class B" may now apply for a visa upon reaching a Nicaraguan 
Port of Entry (POE), rather than having to do so from abroad 
prior to travel.  While the decree text did not include a 
list of affected countries, a list published on the Foreign 
Ministry (MINREX) website indicated that country groupings 
also have been changed.  Only India newly appears on the 
"Class-B" list.  Four countries -- Ecuador, Iran, Libya and 
the Palestinian Authority -- have moved from "Class-C" 
directly to "Class-A,"  effectively granting them 
visa-waiver.  As previously reported, Iran and Libya were 
changed by decree in December 2007 (REFTEL).  Five others -- 
Haiti, India, Jordan, Pakistan and Thailand -- have been 
moved from "Class-C" to "Class-A" for non-tourist passport 
holders only.  Visas for tourist passport-holders from these 
countries (except India, which moved to "Class-B") would 
still require prior approval from Central Immigration before 
issuance. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT.  When we inquired with MINREX for a list of 
countries affected by the new decree, we were directed to the 
list on the MINREX site.  We presume this is authoritative, 
but did discover several errors and inconsistencies in the 
MINREX list.  Most significantly, Palestine, Libya and Iran 
all newly appear under "Class-A," but are still listed the 
"Class-C" grouping.  The MINREX list does not anywhere show 
the Czech Republic, Iceland, Romania or Saint Kitts, which 
are all "Class-A" countries under the original CA-4 
agreement.   Also, Serbia and Montenegro still appear 
together as one country under "Class-B."  Finally, neither 
South Ossetia nor Abkhazia -- to which Nicaragua has granted 
official recognition -- appear on the visa category lists. 
However, there is a new entry under "Class-C" for "Entities 
or Authorities Recognized as States."  Western Sahara still 
appears separately.  We will continue to seek clarification 
on these discrepancies and information about how the new visa 
will be implemented.  END COMMENT.
