SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #9 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
on February 19, 2010. Please visit the following link for 
additional classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) 18 February Protest Activity - No Olympics-related protests 
occurred yesterday. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) Current Protest Activity - There are no Olympics-related 
protests scheduled for today, February 19. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Anticipated Protest Activity - The next demonstration of 
note - a "Rally for National Housing" - is scheduled for noon on 
Saturday, February 20 on the north (Georgia Street) side of the 
Vancouver Art Gallery. Canadian sources expect it to be non-violent 
and further note some visiting anti-Olympic activists are departing 
Vancouver, which suggests additional protests are unlikely. 
Diplomatic Security will continue to monitor protest activity and 
will provide updates as necessary. 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U//FOUO) Second Possible Security Breach at BC Place - Open 
sources report a person with a valid ticket for Monday's Victory 
Ceremony at BC Place passed through security with a possible 
suspicious item in his/her bag. The person walked away from the 
screening area before the bag could be further inspected. The Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police Integrated Security Unit's Emergency 
Response Team responded, but could not locate the subject. Police 
are unsure what the device in question may have been; however, the 
RCMP did a thorough sweep of the 60,000-seat stadium at the end of 
the evening with negative results. Olympic security staff noted 
safety procedures at BC Place are being reviewed. Law enforcement 
officers supervise security personnel at a 1:4 ratio at Olympic 
venues; pedestrian screening should take between 30-60 seconds per 
person. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (U//FOUO//LES) Suspicious Map of Whistler Athlete's Village 
Discovered - RCMP advised Whistler-based DS Field Liaison Officers 
(FLOs) that a small map depicting locations of Coca-Cola machines 
in the Whistler Athlete's Village was discovered. Canadian 
authorities are investigating. 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
¶7.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Suspicious Call to TSA Operations Center - Update - The 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified and contacted the 
female caller, who expressed concern about passenger N. FAROOQUI. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) identified the subject as 
a passenger aboard U.S Airways flight #508 from Phoenix to 
Vancouver. She was intercepted in the outbound jet way on February 
18, after which she was interviewed and her baggage was examined 
with negative results. FAROOQUI has crossed the U.S.-Canada 
boundary line six times in the last six months and has no prior 
derogatory information. 
 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU) FBI Receives Anonymous Write-in Alleging Unspecified 
Olympics Attack - FBI headquarters received an anonymous write-in 
threat letter contending Nazreen Ali - an  alleged international 
terrorist of Fijian descent currently living in Canada - and her 
sister "are planning to do a big one in the winter Olympics" (NFI). 
The write-in stated the alleged terrorist had returned to Fiji to 
obtain additional training and would attempt to re-enter Canada via 
Los Angeles Airport between January 1 and 30, 2010. The letter 
appears to have been mailed from Canada. The RCMP is aware of and 
investigating the information. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Other than scheduled USOC and team movements, no major 
 
Olympics-related security operations have transpired during this 
reporting period.

Secretary Sebelius, and Ambassador to the USUN Susan Rice will 
visit Vancouver from February 25 to March 1 and attend the closing 
ceremonies.
