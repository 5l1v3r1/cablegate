 Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with and Al-Ayyam front pages 
news on US Special Envoy George Mitchell's July 28 meeting with 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. The reports 
note that Netanyahu proposed a three month halt to settlement 
activity, excluding construction in Jerusalem and natural growth, 
which was rejected by Mitchell. Mitchell and Netanyahu told the 
press after their meeting that some progress was achieved regarding 
the peace process. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports separately on its 
front page that 11 outposts have been established in the West Bank 
in the last two days. 
 
Al-Quds runs separate front page coverage on a message sent by 
President Obama to the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, 
Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates urging them to take 
serious confidence building measures with Israel in order to help 
the US convince Israel to freeze settlement activity. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news citing Wafa News Agency that PA President 
Mahmoud Abbas telephoned King Abdullah of Jordan on July 28 to 
discuss efforts to revive the peace process. Abbas and Abdullah 
reiterated that negotiations should be re-launched based on the Arab 
Peace Initiative and that Israel must stop all settlement activity. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page coverage on Hamas officially informing 
Egypt that it will prohibit Fatah members residing in Gaza from 
participating in the Fatah Party Congress scheduled for August 4 in 
Bethlehem. Senior Fatah official Nabil Sha'ath told Al-Ayyam on July 
28 that the Fatah Central Committee will convene to decide whether 
or not they will hold the conference as scheduled, based on efforts 
by Syria, Turkey and Russia to convince Hamas to allow Fatah members 
out of Gaza. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news citing wires that the PA 
Minister of Civil Affairs Hussein Al-Sheikh announced that Israel 
approved extra opening hours for pedestrians and cargo at the 
Allenby border crossing between the West Bank and Jordan for two 
months beginning August 4. Al-Sheikh noted that the Israeli decision 
was made in response to demands from the PA due to increasing delays 
at the border. 
 
All dailies front page news citing Wafa News Agency that Jerusalem 
Muslim and Christian religious leaders called on Palestinians to be 
present in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on July 30 to forestall any 
potential attacks by Jewish religious groups who are intending to 
carry out a religious ceremony on the compound grounds.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
1) Mohammed Al-Soudi opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "The settlements freeze for normalization" (07/29): "The 
regional and international situation today requires that Arab 
leaders revisit their policies and positions...They should balance 
their interests and their obligations, they should not allow the US 
to satisfy Israel at their expense. The Arab states must take their 
place on the international stage." 
 
2) Rimonda Al-Taweel opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
e 
title "France within an international front criticizing Israel" 
 
JERUSALEM 00001294  002 OF 002 
 
 
(07/29): "The new European rhetoric that has started to publically 
criticize and condemn Israel could not have been so without the 
change in the US administration which views the current Israeli 
positions as undermining the peace process."
