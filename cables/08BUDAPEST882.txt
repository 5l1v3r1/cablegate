¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel, MFA Afghan Desk Officer 
Ferenc Hegyesi told PolOff on September 4 that Hungary 
supports increasing the size of the Afghan National Army 
(ANA).  Highlighting the current and planned Hungarian 
military activity in Afghanistan - their PRT in Baghlan 
province, the upcoming security responsibility for Kabul's 
airport, deployment of two OMLTs in early 2009 and the 
planned Special Forces contingent - Hegyesi stated the 
importance of improving the capabilities of the ANA.  He also 
mentioned that Hungary now has five Hungarian police officers 
and one Croatian police officer, originally assigned to their 
PRT, seconded to the EUPOL mission, with an additional three 
police officers working within their PRT to further develop 
Afghan National Police capabilities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment.  While Hungary supports ANA expansion in 
principle, we anticipate that the GOH will be challenged to 
provide significant contributions to the proposed multi-donor 
trust fund due to its current financial situation. End 
comment.
