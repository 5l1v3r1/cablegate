REF: STATE 89241 
 
Â¶1.  We reviewed ref on May 8 with Bahraini MFA Assistant 
Undersecretary (Assistant Secretary-equivalent) for Bilateral 
Affairs and on May 11 with the Bahraini MFA Minister of 
State.  The Bahraini officials reiterated broad Bahraini 
support for American efforts to stabilize Iraq.  Bahrain does 
not, however, plan to upgrade the status of its Embassy in 
Baghdad.  The Minister of State said there is a full-time 
Bahraini diplomat at the Embassy working with local staff. 
Manama has no plans to add staff in the foreseeable future. 
The MinState said that for the MFA perceives that the 
security situation in Baghdad does not permit Bahrain to 
increase the size of its Embassy there.  He added that he and 
some other MFA officials have urged the Bahraini diplomat in 
Baghdad to come home, but so far the diplomat prefers to stay 
because his children are Iraqis settled in Baghdad.
