COOPERATION ON TIP; YOUTH AND WOMENS' CONTACTS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Israeli FM Livni delayed her departure from the WEF 
at Sharm el-Sheikh on May 21 in order to meet with Egyptian 
First Lady Suzanne Mubarak to discuss increasing 
Egyptian-Israeli cooperation on combating TIP.  The meeting 
came at US suggestion to both sides after Livni had raised 
the TIP issue with Deputy Secretary Zoellick.  The two sides 
invited Ambassador to join their meeting.  The Egyptians 
declined to invite media coverage.  (Livni had met twice 
earlier with President Mubarak -- once with several ministers 
from both sides, and a second time several hours later alone; 
she had met also with Gamal Mubarak.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Wearing the lapel pin exhorting in Arabic "Stop 
Human Trafficking Now" distributed by Mrs. Mubarak's anti-TIP 
public awareness campaign, FM Livni appealed for Egypt's 
support in securing the Israeli-Egyptian border against human 
smuggling.  Mrs. Mubarak admitted that she had only recently 
begun to focus on the global issue, and asked for details of 
the problem regarding Sinai.  FM Livni offered no specifics 
on the dimensions or nature of the problem, beyond mention 
that she thought some Russian women had entered Israeli 
illegally via Sinai.  Israeli Ambassador Shalom Cohen pointed 
to some initial lower-level Israeli-Egyptian contacts to deal 
with the problem.  Mrs. Mubarak pledged to look into the 
GoE's measures to cope with TIP via the Sinai, and to look 
for ways to step up cooperation with the GoI on this issue. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) FM Livni seized the occasion to ask Mrs. Mubarak's 
assistance in including Israeli participation in 
international conferences for women and youth on peace 
issues.  Mrs. Mubarak agreed to support Israeli participation 
in such conferences, and pointed to the WEF youth and peace 
issues panel in which she had just participated, which had 
included Israeli and Palestinian women participants.
