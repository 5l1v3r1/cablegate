Permanent Representative Duale and his deputy re the official 
residence at 250 Elk Avenue in New Rochelle, New York. He 
presented AMB Duale with note verbale HC-67-09 (text in para

to the residence using money held in escrow from the 1995 
sale of the former Ambassador's residence in Washington. Both 
AMB Duale and the DPR offered their sincere gratitude to the 
USG. AMB Duale agreed to send over a note waiving the 
property's inviolability (text in para 3).  AMB Duale 
assigned DPR Mohamed as the Somali Mission's point person for 
the project.

New

 In an effort to facilitate the improvement of the property, 
the 
United States Mission requests that the Permanent Mission 
execute a 
written waiver of the property's inviolability to enable the 
Department of State to take such steps as it deems necessary 
to 
repair the property (including the interior and exterior of 
the 
residence and the grounds) so that it will conform to all 
relevant 
codes and neighborhood standards.  The United States is 
undertaking this to 
preserve the property on behalf of the Republic of Somalia. 
 
 As the Permanent Mission is aware, the United States 
maintains an 
account in escrow for the Republic of Somalia with funds from 
the 
1995 sale of the former residence of the Somalia Ambassador 
to the 
United States.  The United States is prepared to use these 
funds to 
repair the property as expeditiously as possible. 
 
 The United States Mission requests that this waiver be 
presented no 
later than five days from the date of receipt of this note. 
The 
United States Mission will, when possible, consult with a 
designated member 
of the Permanent Mission on the progress of the project. Upon 
its completion, 
the Permanent Mission of the Somali Republic will be informed 
that it  may use 
the property as the Residence of the Permanent 
Representative." Complimentary closing.
