Statement by the United States Representative to the Joint 
Compliance and Inspection Commission for the Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty (START) 
 
      In accordance with Paragraph 2 of Article XVII of the 
Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics on the Reduction and Limitation of 
Strategic Offensive Arms (START), on November 17, 2008, 
Representatives of the United States, Belarus, Kazakhstan, 
the Russian Federation, and Ukraine met in Geneva, 
Switzerland, to consider whether to extend the 1991 Treaty. 
 
      Therefore, the requirement of the Treaty to meet on the 
issue prior to December 5, 2008, is fulfilled.  However, the 
Parties desire to point out that there was no Treaty 
requirement to make a decision to extend the Treaty at this 
meeting. 
 
      The United States, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian 
Federation, and Ukraine will continue to consider the issue 
and note that a decision on this issue can be made up until 
the date of expiration of the Treaty on December 5, 2009.
