¶1. (U) On 17 April, CDA Fernandez met with former Sudanese President 
(1986-89) and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Deputy Ahmed 
Al-Mirghani, brother of DUP leader Mohamed Othman Al-Mirghani who 
remains in self-imposed exile in Cairo.  Ahmed Al-Mirghani stated 
that the DUP (Mirghani faction) is keen to maintain strong relations 
with the West, especially the United States. He emphasized the DUP's 
roots in Sufi Islam (out of the Khatimiyya Order) as promoting a 
tolerant, inclusive, and pro-Western form of Islamic politics. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mirghani, a trained economist, described the ruling 
National Congress Party (NCP) as a colossus that has tremendous 
power but is actually weak. He noted that Khartoum's surface flash 
and growth masks a grimmer reality, the gap between the center and 
the regions, the capital and the countryside. Despite the regime 
being awash in money because of oil revenues, ordinary Sudanese feel 
more and more squeezed by inflation and deteriorating services 
provided by a kleptocratic state. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The former President (who was overthrown in the coup that 
brought Omar al-Bashir to power) noted that Northern opposition 
parties should be able to confront the NCP but are constrained by a 
lack of a financial base to challenge them, after almost 20 years of 
NCP rule. He described the SPLM (who were the DUP's allies in the 
"National Democratic Alliance" before 2005) as having finally "woken 
up" in late 2007, after having ignored Northern opposition parties 
for over two years after the signing of the CPA. He thanked Charge 
Fernandez for pushing the message publicly that to transform Sudan, 
to help in Darfur or South Sudan, the heart of the problem - and the 
solution - is in Khartoum and reaching out to Northern opposition 
parties much more than before. 
 
¶4. (SBU) CDA Fernandez told Al-Mirghani that the USG will encourage 
a level-playing field ahead of the elections.  He urged Al-Mirghani 
to ensure that the DUP keeps distance from the NCP and not fall prey 
to its destructive "divide and conquer" tactics prior to the 
elections.  Responding to recent DUP member defections to NCP which 
received considerable press coverage in the pro-regime media, 
Al-Mirghani said, "these were not important people at all," noting 
that one "leader" was 84 years old and almost unknown, and "it's 
[the amount of press coverage] a bit of a joke." (Reftels)  The CDA 
agreed that because the NCP controls the media, among other 
important resources, it has the ability to publicly play up such 
things to its advantage.  As a way of encouraging democracy in 
Sudan, the CDA offered support to the DUP through continuous 
dialogue.  Al-Mirghani was grateful for this offer of support.  It 
was agreed that DUP would set up an event for the CDA to meet and 
speak with a larger number of DUP members in the coming weeks. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: Divided now into three or four factions, the DUP 
is probably the most fractured of Sudan's traditional parties but 
probably still has adherents, especially in Sudan's East and North. 
Any real electoral strategy for fully democratic polls in Sudan must 
indeed seek to give historically Northern, Arab, Muslim opposition 
parties a real chance to participate fully, speak out and challenge 
the NCP's false claim to represent what is actually a heterogeneous 
Arabic-speaking "Northern Sudan," not at all in NCP lock-step 
against an also illusory, united anti-Arab, Southern Sudan. Africa's 
largest country is much more complex than that. END COMMENT.
