Â¶1. (U) The World Health Organization (WHO) reported to the U.S. 
government that all of the human samples from North Sumatra have 
tested Negative for H5N1 avian influenza (AI). The director of 
Kisaran District Hospital reported that all ten of the patients 
under its care are now healthy. They will discharge the patients 
once the negative AI test results are received.  At Adam Malik 
Hospital, one of the pediatric cases has improved steadily and 
should be released in the coming days.  The other, an 8-month old, 
tested positive for antibodies consistent with dengue hemorrhagic 
fever, which has some of the same clinical symptoms as AI.
