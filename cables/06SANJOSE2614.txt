¶1.  (U) On November 14, PolCouns and Poloff met with Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs officials to discuss pending Third 
Committee country-specific human rights resolutions, the 
upcoming International Law Commission election, and the 
recent Costa Rican UNGA votes concerning Cuba.  In attendance 
were Director of Foreign Policy Amb. Jose Chaverri, Deputy 
Director of Foreign Policy Edwin Arias, Director of 
Multilateral Policy Carlos Cordero, and Viviana Tinoco from 
the United Nations Area office.  The following are the 
GOCR,s responses; most issues are still "under review.8 
 
¶2.  (U) Third Committee Resolutions:  Post sent Ref A talking 
points to Cordero on November 8, requesting a follow-up 
meeting to discuss them in more detail.  November 14, 
PolCouns reiterated the points, focusing especially on 
Belarus (Ref B) and noting that Costa Rica had voted 
consistent with the USG position on all five country-specific 
resolutions and no action votes in 2005.  Amb. Chaverri was 
noncommittal; he said the issue was still under review.  On 
November 15, post followed up by sending points on the 
Belarussian "reprisal motions" (Ref D) to Chaverri, Arias and 
Cordero, again urging GOCR support. 
 
¶3.  (U) International Law Commission election:  Post sent a 
Diplomatic Note urging support for U.S. Candidate Michael 
Matheson to the MFA (Ref C) on October 31. On November 14, 
PolCouns again solcited the GOCR position, as requested in 
Ref D. After conferring with the international candidates 
office at the MFA, Tinoco informed poloffs that he MFA was 
"still studying" Matheson,s candidacy. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Cuban Embargo Resolution:  Given Cost Rica's usual 
support for country-specific humanrights resolutions and 
general opposition to no ction motions, Polcouns expressed 
disappointmentat Costa Rica,s joining the likes of Iran, 
Belaru, the DPRK and Burma in voting for no action on te 
Australia amendment (Ref E).   Chaverri played down the GOCR 
vote. He said the amendment was offered "too late," so Costa 
Rica voted on procedural grounds. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT: The GOCR,s vote on the Australian 
amendment to the Cuban embargo resolution confirms what a 
more senior-level MFA official hinted to us earlier ,  namely 
that one element of Costa Rica's tactical diplomatic approach 
to shoring up its UNSC candidacy for the 2008-2010 term will 
be to lower the country's profile on Cuba-related matters 
(Ref F).  The other inconclusive answers were, unfortunately, 
in keeping with MFA responses to nearly all UN-related issues 
over the past year.  Even seemingly straight-forward topics 
have required lengthy consideration, generating late 
responses, if any at all.  According to media reports (and 
confirmed by MFA sources), Chaverri will soon depart his 
current position.  In addition, the MFA,s multilateral 
section is undergoing a shake-up, reflecting the greater 
importance FonMin Stagno places on UN issues (again in 
preparation for what the GOCR hopes will be its UNSC election 
for the 2008-2010 term).  Hopefully, these changes will 
improve the MFA,s responsiveness to our UN demarches.
