PEACE AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 95225 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, Post has actively engaged African Union 
officials and Partner representatives on the U.S. 
initiatives to support the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA). 
 
¶2. (U) DPA VERIFICATION: 
-- Prior to the June 9 departure of the joint UN-AU 
technical assistance mission (TAM) to Sudan, Charge and DCM 
briefed AU Peace and Security Commissioner Amb. Said 
Djinnit and AU Special Representative Amb. Baba Gana 
Kingibe on the three USG military personnel to support DPA 
verification and monitoring in Darfur.  At that meeting, 
Djninnit and Kingibe briefed AMIS Force Commander Ikehire, 
then recommended that the United States raise this 
initiative through the Partner mechanism. 
-- Poloff and AF-contracted Peace and Security Advisor to 
the AU formally informed Partner representatives (including 
the EU Military Staff, NATO SMLO, Canada, Japan, and 
European allies) of the USG DPA verification team on June 
13-14.  Partners unanimously endorsed the proposal, and 
have raised it in writing with the sole AU Darfur 
Integrated Task Force official remaining in Addis Ababa, 
POLAD Dr. Solomon Gomes.   (NOTE: Peace and Security 
Commissioner Djinnit has been leading the joint UN-AU TAM 
in Sudan and was not expected to return to Addis Ababa 
until the evening of June 16.  The AU DITF?s Military 
Component Head, Chief of Civilian Police, Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, and Head of Administration Control and Management, 
are also participating in the UN-AU technical assistance 
mission, and have therefore been absent from Ethiopia.  AU 
Commission Chairperson Konare and other senior AU 
Commission principals have also been traveling out of the 
country.  END NOTE.) 
-- Post submitted a formal note verbale to the AU 
Chairperson on June 15, reiterating the USG intention to 
deploy such a DPA verification team, and requesting that 
the AU designate a specific official to coordinate with the 
USG on the team?s role, structure, and function, in either 
Addis Ababa or Sudan. 
-- Partner representatives have agreed to jointly raise the 
USG DPA verification team with the AU DITF on June 19, and 
have also requested that AU Commissioner Djinnit attend 
this meeting. 
-- Partner heads of mission are also scheduled to meet with 
AU Commission Chairperson Konare on June 19; Charge will 
use this opportunity to reaffirm AU cooperation with and 
approval of the USG initiative. 
-- Separately, Charge requested a meeting with Deputy 
Commission Chairperson Patrick Mazimhaka, but the AU 
informed Post he was not available due to being on mission. 
(NOTE: On June 19, AU principals will be participating in 
an Addis-based conference on Somalia, with IGAD, the League 
of Arab States, the UN, and the EU.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3. (U) AMIS FJMHQ:  The AU?s formal request for 6 Partner 
experts to fill advisory positions in the AMIS Forward 
Joint Mission Headquarters (FJMHQ) has led to individual 
responses, via formal note verbale, from several key 
partners: 
-- EU Brussels initially responded by offering candidates 
for all positions.  Subsequent consultations among Addis- 
based Partner representatives, with poloff and USG Peace 
and Security Advisor to the AU, resulted in consensus that 
Partners should coordinate efforts, and would inform the AU 
that there is no objection to the USG offer to fill two 
specific positions (J-2 and J-9). 
-- On behalf of AU Partners, EU Military Staff and EC POLAD 
informed AU DITF POLAD of USG offer, and approval by all 
Partners, on June 12. 
-- On June 13, Post formally informed AU Commission 
Chairperson and AU DITF, via note verbale, of USG offer to 
fill the two AMIS FJMHQ positions named above. 
-- On June 16, EU Military Staff and EC POLAD presented a 
new note verbale from the EU summarizing offers from the 
USG (J-2 and J-9), the UN (J-5), the EU, and NATO (i.e, 
offer to provide staff capacity building), and reiterating 
no objection among Partners to USG offer. 
-- Partner representatives have agreed to reiterate the 
coordinated Partner response to the AU request at a meeting 
with AU DITF on June 19.  As noted above, Partners have 
requested that AU Peace and Security Commission Amb. 
Djinnit attend this meeting. 
 
¶4. (U) MILOBS: Post will seek further consultations with AU 
 
ADDIS ABAB 00001655  002 OF 002 
 
 
officials, on increasing the number of USG MILOBs serving 
in AMIS, when the relevant AU DITF officials and AU 
Commission principals return from traveling outside the 
country.
