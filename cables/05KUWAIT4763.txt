¶2. Sunday, November 13, 2005 
 
-- Mohamed Yousef Al-Melaify wrote for moderate Al-Seyassah 
on page 28, under the title "The audacity of the American 
report": "the Kuwaiti proverb that translates into `taking a 
bad situation and making it worse' best describes the 
American report on the alleged violations of religious 
rights in the world.  The report was prepared by a 
suspicious group of so-called "neo-conservatives" and 
included our big sister the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, 
and other nations.  I prefer Dr. Walid Al-Tabtabaei's 
response to this suspicious report where he said that while 
America's house is made of glass it continues to throw rocks 
at others.  What freedom of religion do you (neo- 
conservatives) speak of when our holy Koran is still being 
violated in your prisons established in the East and the 
West?  Of what freedom of religion do you speak when those 
released from your prisons are still telling tales of 
horror?  Of what freedom of religion do you speak when you 
have given your blessings to the murder of the handicapped 
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin?  And, what has he done other than give 
speeches and speak out?  It is puzzling that the American 
report would mention women's rights when their number of 
illegitimate children exceeds those born to legitimate 
parents.  It is puzzling that the American report would 
mention treatment of domestic workers when the exploitation 
of what they call `illegal aliens' is widely known--having 
them work for lower wages and threatening them with 
deportation in case they do not comply.  It was only a few 
years ago that blacks were not allowed into white schools, 
cinemas, or restaurants.  They were even prevented from 
sitting in the front half of the bus.  And, what of the 
Oklahoma City bombing?  It reeks of racism that is worse 
than anything we could have ever done."
