Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) 
continues to assess areas affected by the September 30 earthquake 
off the coast of West Sumatra.  On October 9, the USAID/DART 
conducted aerial assessments of areas northeast of the epicenter of 
the earthquake, as well as areas south of Padang.  While relief 
efforts continue, international media coverage is beginning to wane. 
 On October 9, the U.N. released the West Sumatra Earthquake 
Humanitarian Response Plan, in coordination with the Government of 
Indonesia (GoI), seeking $38 million for programs lasting 90 days. 
The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) continues to provide patient 
treatment through a mobile medical unit and has provided helicopters 
to transport emergency relief commodities and humanitarian personnel 
to areas inaccessible by road.  End summary.

USAID/DART Relief Activities 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On October 8, the USAID/DART met with the U.S. Pacific 
Command-designated Mission Commander to discuss helicopter 
operations in earthquake-affected areas.  The USAID/DART is working 
with the humanitarian clusters in Padang to coordinate air 
operations on DoD helicopters.  DoD has offered helicopters to 
transport both emergency relief supplies and humanitarian personnel 
to earthquake-affected areas that are otherwise inaccessible. 
 
¶3.  On October 8, members of the USAID/DART who traveled to Agam 
District observed that humanitarian needs vary widely within the 
district.  However, virtually every house observed by the USAID/DART 
has sustained at least some damage, and many houses have collapsed 
or are structurally unsound and need to be rebuilt. 
 
¶4.  The USAID/DART also visited the spontaneous displaced person 
camp near Lake Singkarak in Padang Pariaman District on October 8. 
Individuals in the camp were displaced by a landslide or ordered by 
police to evacuate four villages around the lake.  The International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) is providing humanitarian 
assistance to the approximately 2,000 individuals sheltering in the 
camp; however, unmet needs persist, including the need for safe 
drinking water, as some individuals living in the camp are 
collecting water from the nearby lake.  Sanitation facilities at a 
neighboring mosque were insufficient to sustain the population's 
sanitation needs. 
 
¶5.  On October 9, the USAID/DART conducted aerial assessments of 
areas northeast of the epicenter of the earthquake as well as areas 
south of Padang.  South of Padang, the team observed minor secondary 
road blockages resulting from small landslides along the road. 
These road blockages were passable by motorbikes and should be 
relatively easy for communities to clear. 
 
¶6.  In addition, on October 9, the USAID/DART continues to field 
media requests and produce press releases.  International media are 
leaving Padang; the USAID/DART reports that reporters from Agence 
France-Presse (AFP) and the Associated Press (AP) have departed. 
The USAID/DART press officer continues to coordinate with DoD and 
U.S. Embassy counterparts to provide press support to the USG 
humanitarian relief effort. 
 
¶7.  The USAID/DART is working to facilitate the arrival of the 
flight of relief commodities from the USAID/OFDA warehouse in Dubai. 
 The flight is tentatively scheduled to land in Padang on October 9.

Humanitarian Response Plan 
-------------------------- 
 
¶8.  On October 9, the U.N. released the West Sumatra Earthquake 
 
JAKARTA 00001712  002 OF 002 
 
 
Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), in coordination with the GoI. 
Similar to a U.N. flash appeal, the HRP summarizes humanitarian 
needs and requests assistance from the international community to 
support the GoI in the humanitarian response to the earthquake.  As 
many as 115 international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are 
providing humanitarian assistance to affected populations as of 
October 9. 
 
¶9.  According to the HRP, the earthquake affected 1.2 million of the 
total 4.76 million people in West Sumatra Province.  As of October 
9, the quake has killed 739 people, left 296 people missing and 
presumed dead, and injured 2,219 others.  In addition, the 
earthquake has damaged more than 230,000 houses. 
 
¶10.  To address humanitarian needs created by the September 30 
earthquake, the HRP requests $38 million for 90 days, or 
approximately $32 per beneficiary.  (Comment:  The HRP does not 
include the $18.6 million also requested by the International 
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in its October 7 
appeal.  End comment.)  The HRP describes priority needs by cluster. 
 Included in the total request are the following sectors and 
amounts: 
 
-- Agriculture:  $3,250,000 
-- Coordination and Safety:  $470,000 
-- Early Recovery:  $4,300,000 
-- Education:  $4,504,390 
-- Food and Nutrition:  $2,044,903 
-- Health:  $2,618,000 
-- Logistics and Telecommunications:  $1,997,308 
-- Protection:  $2,211,000 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-- Shelter:  $9,625,500 
-- Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene:  $7,010,000

DoD Earthquake Response 
----------------------- 
 
¶11.  On October 8, staff at the DoD Humanitarian Assistance Rapid 
Response Team (HARRT) treated 243 patients.  The U.S.S. Denver and 
the U.S.S. McCampbell arrived in Padang late in the evening on 
October 8.  DoD is providing five helicopters, including three with 
heavy lift capacity, for use by the humanitarian community.  The 
heavy lift helicopters will transport emergency relief commodities 
and humanitarian aid workers to areas that are difficult to access 
or inaccessible by road, and the other helicopters are being used 
for aerial assessments of affected areas and transport of medical 
and teams.  DoD commenced helicopter operations on October 9.  As of 
October 7, DoD had provided assistance worth more than $4 million, 
including the cost of medical supplies to support the HARRT and the 
cost of airlifts.
