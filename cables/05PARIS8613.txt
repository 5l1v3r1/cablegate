On December 20 poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA 
Afghanistan Desk Officer Cyril Gerardon.  In a follow up 
conversation with Gerardon on December 22, Gerardon explained 
that France had anticipated a U.S. adjustment to troop 
strength in response to the expanded presence of NATO ISAF 
troops.  He commented that the growing presence of NATO 
forces was a better justification for the troop reduction 
than the growing capability of Afghan forces, adding that the 
Afghan army presence in the provinces was still minimal.  He 
also said that it was a good idea for U.S. troops to remain 
ready to deploy, as growing instability in Afghanistan was 
always a possibility.
