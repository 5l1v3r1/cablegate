 Post found no evidence of the use of child or forced labor 
in the production of specific goods in Spain.  There have 
been reports of men being trafficked for forced labor in the 
agriculture and construction sectors, but officials from the 
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and workers' rights NGO 
Accem said that these were largely isolated instances and 
that they are quickly corrected.  International Labor 
Organization country director Juan Felipe Hunt agreed that 
Spain has not seen problems of child labor or forced labor 
for the production of specific goods.  Hunt told Econoff that 
while there were occasional reports of child labor, mainly 
working in small family businesses or agriculture, the 
government of Spain rapidly responds and corrects the 
situation.
