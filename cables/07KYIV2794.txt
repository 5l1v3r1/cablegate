¶1. (SBU) The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, on November 8, issued a 
statement expressing its alarm over the Russian Duma decision to 
suspend the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty's provisions. 
 The strong statement continues the Ukrainian MFA's concern and 
engagement over the issue (reftels).  We provide our informal 
translation of the statement, taken from the MFA website, below. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin statement. 
 
Ukraine is alarmed by the decision of Russia to suspend CFE Treaty 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine is alarmed by the actions 
of Russia related to fulfillment of obligations stipulated by the 
CFE Treaty. 
 
Ukraine's MFA is sure that the Russian State Duma's adoption of the 
law "On Suspension of the Application of the Conventional Forces in 
Europe Treaty by the Russian Federation" (on November 7) will result 
in considerable loss of control over the Conventional Forces in 
Europe. 
 
"Ukraine, as one of four countries which ratified the Agreement on 
application of the Treaty, believes that this step puts the future 
of a crucial mechanism of European security in jeopardy and can 
breed mistrust in Europe again.  Ukraine is particularly alarmed by 
the fact that the suspension of the CFE Treaty's application can 
lead to an increase in conventional armed forces directly at its 
borders," reads the statement. 
 
The MFA stresses the crucial role of the CFE Treaty as one of the 
essential pillars of European security and urges all parties to 
continue talks aimed at unblocking enforcement of the Agreement on 
Adaptation of the CFE Treaty. 
 
End statement.
