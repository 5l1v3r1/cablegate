reviewed for Attorney General Mukasey on the margins of the 
Cross Border Crime Forum, Canada's program for border 
security and law enforcement.  In addition to hiring 400 new 
border guards and arming the border service, Canada has put 
new resources into improving the technology and hiring 1,000 
new federal officers.  He stressed the importance of 
relations to the United States for the government under Prime 
Minister Stephen Harper, and expressed the determination to 
keep open communications with us to ensure no "thickening" of 
the border.  In response to a question, the AG confirmed 
that, while there are individuals of concern in both Canada 
and the U.S., there is not a USG perception that terrorists 
are streaming across the border with Canada.  End Summary. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT'S LAW AND ORDER AGENDA 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Attorney General Mukasey met with Canadian Public 
Safety Minister Day on the margins of the Cross Border Crime 
Forum (septel) in Quebec City March 18.  Canadian Ambassador 
to the U.S. Wilson and U.S. Ambassador to Canada Wilkins were 
also in attendance.  Day highlighted that the  government 
under PM Harper came into office in 2006 with a specific 
focus on law and order.  It has pushed through a broad legal 
and technical border agenda, including 400 new border 
officers, the arming of the border service, 1,000 more 
federal law enforcement officers, and significant increases 
in funding for equipment and improved border technology, Day 
explained. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Day underscored that Canada highly values its 
excellent working relationship with U.S. border services and 
law enforcement agencies and is constantly looking for ways 
to further improve cooperation.  The government, he said, was 
pleased with the strength of the U.S.-Canada relationship. 
Day explained that the O'Connor inquiry into the Arar affair 
had revealed that information shared with the U.S. had not 
been subject to as careful controls as it should have been, 
which has made it harder since then for Canada to share 
information with the U.S.  He expressed the belief that our 
two countries work well operationally, but still need to keep 
evaluating and improving our system for sharing information. 
 
 
CONCERN OVER BORDER THICKENING 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Day said that there is a general apprehension in 
Canada about a "thickening" of the border.  He reiterated 
that Canada also wants to keep the border secure, but was 
concerned with "over-regulation" by the U.S. that could hurt 
the Canadian economy, which is very dependent on cross border 
trade.  Canadian Ambassador Wilson pointed out that about 40% 
of the Canadian GDP comes from exports, with 76% of its 
exports going to the U.S.; a large number of items must cross 
the border several times in the course of manufacturing.  Day 
commented positively on his discussions on pre-clearance 
procedures with Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff, noting 
that Canada understands that, for legal reasons, the U.S. 
would have a difficult time doing passenger land 
pre-clearance, but hopes that there will be progress on the 
commercial side.  He welcomed a recent meeting between 
Canadian officials and National Security Advisor Hadley and 
other White House officials to discuss the rollout of the 
Qother White House officials to discuss the rollout of the 
Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), and expressed 
the hope these meetings will continue on a quarterly basis. 
 
NO TERRORISTS STREAMING ACROSS THE BORDER 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Day asked for clarification from the Attorney 
General on how the USG views the terrorist threat emanating 
from Canada.  Periodically, he said, there is a media 
reaction in the United States to something like the Khadr 
case that leads to the image of large numbers of terrorists 
"prancing around" in Canada uncontrolled.  AG Mukasey 
confirmed that there were some individuals of concern in 
Canada, just as there are in the United States, but the USG 
does not believe that terrorists are "streaming across the 
border."  Day stressed the importance of ensuring officials 
and the public in the U.S. have correct information on this. 
Day noted that the "less fuel" that is given to certain media 
outlets in the U.S. on this issue, the better. 
 
¶6. (U) This cable has been cleared by the AG's party.
