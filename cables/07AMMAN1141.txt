SUBJECT: JORDANIANS REQUEST MODIFICATIONS TO JIPTC AMENDMENT 
 
REF: A. A) STATE 21897 
 
     ¶B. B) STATE 22857 
 
¶1.  (U) Action request at paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The head of the Public Security Director's private 
office wrote to the Embassy March 10 requesting four changes 
to the U.S.-proposed text (reftels) of an amendment to the 
JIPTC LOA.  The requests include: 
 
- Replacing the term "International Training Center (ITC)" 
with the term the "Jordan International Police Training 
Center (JIPTC)" throughout the text; 
 
- Setting a minimum percentage of Jordanian trainers and 
employees; 
 
- Guaranteeing a key leadership position to a senior 
Jordanian officer; and 
 
- Including an article stating that the U.S. will request the 
GoJ's approval before JIPTC opens trainer or trainee 
positions to new nationalities. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Poloff and JIPTC Director addressed these requests 
with Brigadier General Tawfiq Al-Halalmeh, Deputy Director of 
Operations and Training, and his staff on March 13.  Halameh 
withdrew the requests for an additional leadership position 
and for a minimum percentage of Jordanian employees.  He 
insists, however, that the Department change the term 
"International Training Center (ITC)" to the "Jordan 
International Training Center (JITC)," and specify in the 
amendment that the U.S. will seek Jordanian agreement on the 
nationality of international trainers and trainees. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action Request: Through this desired change, PSD is 
merely seeking a written version of the U.S. commitment 
previously conveyed orally that the GoJ will retain a veto on 
which nationalities international trainers and trainees are 
drawn from.  PSD also seeks to change the name for the 
U.S.-administered portion of JIPTC.  Post and JIPTC Director 
believe these Jordanian requests are reasonable, and asks the 
Department revise the pending amendment to accommodate.
