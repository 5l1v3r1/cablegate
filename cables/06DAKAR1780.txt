REF: DAKAR 00403 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel, airlines in Dakar continue to see 
genuine Refugee Travel Documents (I-571) issued to 
imposters.  In the past three months, Senegalese 
immigration officials seized five Refugee Travel Documents 
from travelers denied boarding by South African Airways 
(SAA) because they appeared to have never lived in the 
U.S.  A review of USCIS records indicate that the 
travelers, whose photos appear in the genuine Refugee 
Travel Documents, are not the persons granted asylum in 
the U.S.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) South African Airlines (SAA) has sought 
assistance from post regarding screening passengers who 
present Refugee Travel Documents (I-571) to board direct 
flights from Dakar to the U.S.  According to SAA, 
approximately eight passengers per flight (there are 14 
direct flights per week to the U.S.) currently present 
Refugee Travel Documents.  SAA personnel deny boarding and 
refer approximately 50 percent of these passengers to 
Senegalese immigration officials because of suspicions 
that the travelers have never been to the U.S. 
Unfortunately, Senegalese immigration officials rarely 
seize the travelers' documents. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Despite their reluctance to seize documents, 
Senegalese immigration authorities recently provided the 
Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) with five Refugee Travel 
Documents taken from travelers denied boarding by SAA. 
The FPU, with the help of the DHS Forensic Laboratory, 
confirmed that all five Refugee Travel Documents were 
issued in the name of genuine refugees, but with 
photographs of imposters.  Post already sent three of 
these documents to USCIS Accra; the last two will be 
forwarded to the USCIS Office of Fraud Detection. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) As a result of our feedback, SAA implemented a 
more vigorous pre-screening process and are seeing fewer 
travelers with Refugee Travel Documents.  They reported 
that these travelers have started flying Royal Air Maroc 
(RAM), an airline known to have less stringent pre- 
screening requirements because it does not fly directly to 
the U.S. from Dakar. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5.  (SBU) Genuine Refugee Travel Documents issued to 
imposters present difficulties for airline pre-screeners 
since the only way to identify the imposters is through 
extensive interviews of the travelers.  While the FPU can 
confirm identity easily through the DHS Forensic 
Laboratory, flights from Dakar depart in the middle of the 
night when airlines cannot contact the FPU to quickly 
confirm the identity of passengers.  Also, given the 
reluctance of Senegalese immigration authorities to seize 
suspect documents, travelers denied boarding by SAA can 
simply try other airlines until they successfully board.
