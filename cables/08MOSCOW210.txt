¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, RAS Institute of Solid Physics, Chernogolovka, 
Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application D358874 as the ultimate consignee of two 
millimeter source model E8257DS08 and E8257DS12. These 
items are controlled for national security and anti- 
terrorism reasons under ECCN 3A002. The licensee is 
Agilent Technologies, Inc., 1666 K st., N.W. Suite 
420, Washington DC. 20006. 
 
¶3. On January 18, 2008, Export Control Attache Peter 
Liston and LES Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with RAS 
Institute of Solid Physics, Institutsky pr., 15, 
Chernogolovka, Moscow, Russia. The export control team 
met with Vladimir Kulakovsky, Deputy General Director 
and Alexander Levchenko, Deputy Director.  ECO Liston 
discussed the license conditions with Kulakovsky and 
Levchenko, as mention in reftel. 
 
¶4. The Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP) was 
organized in 15 February, 1963 by the USSR Academy of 
Sciences in order to realize an optimal combination 
and interplay of fundamental studies in condensed 
matter physics and materials science.  ISSP is one of 
the leading institutions in the Russian Academy of 
Sciences.  The Institute is the base for a number of 
departments of Moscow State University, the Moscow 
Physical-Technical Institute, and the Moscow Institute 
of Steel and Alloys.  Students from many other Russian 
institutions of higher education obtain practical 
research experience at the Institute. 
 
¶5.  The devices in reftel are used to study a 
microwave response from semiconductor hetro-structures 
with two-dimensional (2D) electron systems in a high 
magnetic field at liquid helium temperatures, all 
within the field of fundamental research of Solid 
State Physics. 
 
¶6.  The ECO Moscow team was shown two (2) millimeter 
source MOD, model no.'s E8257DS08 and E8257DS12, 
located in a secure lab with limited access. 
 
¶7.  ECO Moscow made a previous PSV visit to RAS/ISSP 
on May 11, 2007 (Moscow 02685) for verification of a 
90GHZ to 140GHZ millimeter source module, model no 
S08MS-AG with serial no. 60821-1 and a 60GHZ to 90GHZ 
millimeter source module, model S12MS-AG, serial 
number 61002-1.  The current ECO Moscow team again 
verified both units on January 18, 2008. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends RAS Institute of 
Solid Physics, Chernogolovka, Russia as a reliable 
recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
