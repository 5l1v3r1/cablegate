SUBJECT: POSSIBLE CAMBODIAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION ON 
BURMA 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Opposition parliamentarian Son Chhay, 
soon to be designated as the Chairman of the National 
Assembly's Commission on Foreign Affairs, is prepared to 
promote a resolution on Burma in the National Assembly.  Such 
a resolution would be in keeping with -- but a little more 
forward leaning than -- resolutions passed by legislative 
bodies in other ASEAN countries.  He has requested USG 
assistance in holding an interparliamentary conference on 
Burma this year that would also include China and India. 
End Summary. 
 
Possible National Assembly Resolution on Burma 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  During an April 5 meeting with Sam Rainsy Party 
parliamentarian Son Chhay, the SRP National Assembly Whip 
confirmed that he would be named the new Chair of the 
National Assembly's Commission on Foreign Affairs (and 
international cooperation, information and media), replacing 
FUNCINPEC's Princess Vacheara (who reportedly has departed 
the country for Beijing).  Fellow SRP MP Yim Sovann will take 
over the NA commission on defense, home affairs, and 
anti-corruption.  Approval by the National Assembly is 
expected to take place by the end of the week, according to 
the media.  Son Chhay has a longstanding interest in 
democracy in Burma, as he has participated in ASEAN 
parliamentary delegation visits to Burma, and he recently had 
published a letter to the editor in "The Cambodia Daily" 
regarding his recent trip to Burma. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Pol/Econ Chief requested that Son Chhay consider 
proposing a resolution on Burma to the National Assembly, 
both as a member of the ASEAN interparliamentary body but 
also as the incoming Chair of the Foreign Affairs Commission 
of the National Assembly.  Son Chhay said that he already has 
considered the idea and believes it possible, despite 
Cambodia's National Assembly not having a history of such 
action.  He noted that in addition to Cambodia, legislative 
representatives from five other ASEAN countries (Philippines, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore) participate in the 
interparliamentary group that has visited Burma.  Of the six 
countries, the legislatures of the Philippines, Indonesia, 
and Malaysia have passed resolutions on Burma, so there is no 
reason Cambodia could not do so.  He urged the Embassy to 
discuss the prospect with the other political parties to pave 
the way for the success of a resolution, and he welcomed U.S 
input on the content of a resolution. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)   Son Chhay added that other countries comprising 
the ASEAN interparliamentary grouping on Burma have held 
conferences on the subject; Cambodia has not yet sponsored a 
similar gathering.  Son Chhay would like Cambodia to host a 
conference this year -- preferably in July; he requested USG 
financial assistance in support of such a conference.  In 
addition to inviting legislative representatives from all 
ASEAN countries, Son Chhay envisions including 
representatives from China, India, and the Burmese government 
in exile in Thailand.  Getting the Chinese to do more on 
Burma, noted Son Chhay, would be key to progress on 
democracy.  He believes that ASEAN has been ineffective and 
is unlikely to make progress with Burma's military junta in 
the near term; China could be helpful if the Chinese decided 
to intervene with Rangoon. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  We were noncommittal with Son Chhay on prospects 
for USG funding for his proposed conference, but urge 
Washington consideration of the request.  July may be 
unrealistically too soon, given our experience with Cambodian 
planning capabilities.  We believe we would be able to 
convince the PM to open the conference and deliver a tough 
message on Burma.  We plan to draft a resolution for Son 
Chhay's consideration, and will email proposed text to 
Washington for comment and input.  End Comment.
