SUBJECT: CZECH COMMENTS ABOUT IRAN'S PRESIDENT NOT 
ATTENDING THE AFRICAN UNION SUMMIT 
 
REF: STATE 67887 
 
(SBU) Czech MFA Department of Sub-Saharan Africa officer 
Zdenak Beranek informed emboff that Czech Ambassador Dusan 
Strauch was attending the July 1-3 African Union Summit. 
Beranek noted that the EU had discussed and agreed on how its 
member states would handle the potential participation of 
Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmedi-Nejad at this summit. 
According to Beranek, the EU member state participants 
planned to leave the ceremony if Ahmedi-Nejad spoke to attack 
Western governments or deny the Holocaust.  From the 
perspective of the EU, this is no longer a concern since the 
EU was informed the morning of July 1 that Ahmedi-Nejad would 
not be attending this Summit.
