SUBJECT:  USG-supported Counter-Narcotics Center gains official GOI 
recognition 
 
 
¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  President Yudhoyono has signed legislation 
officially recognizing the Joint Interagency Counter Drug Operations 
Center as part of the Indonesian National Narcotics Board.  While 
USG assistance helped spur the Center's creation, its ultimate 
success will depend largely on continued Indonesian support.  It is 
highly positive, however, that the GOI has taken full ownership of 
the body.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (U) THE LEGISLATION:  President Yudhoyono has signed legislation 
officially recognizing the Joint Interagency Counter Drug Operations 
Center (JIACDOC) as part of the Indonesian National Narcotics Board 
(BNN).  The legislation provides for a JIACDOC staff of up to 107 
personnel consisting of officers from the Indonesian National 
Police, and civilians from Customs, Immigration and other government 
agencies.  Its annual operating budget of $750,000 will be provided 
by the government of Indonesia. 
 
¶4. (U) ABOUT JIACDOC:  Also referred to by the Indonesian acronym 
PUSDALOPS, JIACDOC is an Indonesian inter-agency intelligence and 
operations fusion center focused on counter-narcotics and 
transnational crime intelligence collection and interdiction. 
JIACDOC seeks to maximize resources, expertise and 
information-sharing toward effectively interdicting narcotics and 
transnational criminal activities within Indonesia.  The Center is 
headquartered in Jakarta, with six out-stations located within the 
Jakarta City Police, at Jakarta International Airport, and in Medan, 
Batam, Denpasar and Manado. 
 
¶5. (U) USG SUPPORT:  JIACDOC was established with the support of 
Mission, JIATF West, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA) via its regional office in Singapore.  JIATF West currently 
supports three American TDY positions at JIACDOC and is in the 
process of establishing a DEA NSDD-38 position with office space at 
JIACDOC.  Until the latest legislation, the project was largely 
funded and supported by the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force West 
(JIATF West) of the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM).  JIATF West has 
been present in Indonesia since 2004, and provides assistance to 
partner nations to develop intelligence and operational capabilities 
in the areas of counter-narcotics and transnational crime. 
 
¶6. (SBU) OTHER USG ASSISTANCE:  JIATF West has also provided 
assistance to the BNN in the form of organizational guidance, 
facilities, IT infrastructure, database support, training, and 
training infrastructure.  JIATF West is currently working with U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to provide facilities, 
equipment and technical expertise to the GOI to create a passenger 
analysis unit (PAU) at the Jakarta International Airport. 
 
¶7. (SBU) GOI COMMITMENT:  The ultimate success of JIACDOC will 
depend largely upon the degree to which the GOI institutes the 
necessary policy regulations and organizational changes in key 
agencies so that they coordinate well together.  Moreover, the 
Indonesian government will have to sustain the staffing and funding 
of the Center.  At this point, the GOI agencies involved appear to 
be strongly committed to further developing the Center.
