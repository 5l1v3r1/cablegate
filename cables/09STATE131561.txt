SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050020134 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 050020134 for the 
export of night vision devices (NVDs) to 
New Zealand.  Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
check will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar foreign consignee and 
end-user, Southern Lakes Helicopter. 
The company has appeared on previous licenses but the 
company's bona fides have not been 
verified by a Blue Lantern check.  Moreover, due to the 
sensitivity of the 
equipment and the potential for their diversion or misuse, 
the Department of State and the Department of Defense have 
policies of carefully scrutinizing NVD export licenses and 
taking steps to ensure proper end-use.  Provisos attached 
to these licenses obligate the end-user to secure the NVDs 
from loss, theft, or unauthorized access, and to perform 
routine inventory checks by serial number.  These records 
are to be made available for review upon US Government 
request.  Specific to license 050020134 is a proviso 
stipulating that 
that the NVDs must ONLY be used when performing search and 
rescue (S&R) 
and emergency medical service (EMS) operations for Government 
of New Zealand (GONZ) agencies 
only and must not be used in conjunction with any independent 
commercial operations. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to make inquiries 
to confirm continued possession by Southern Lakes Helicopter 
of 
the NVDs, to determine the serial numbers of the NVDs, and 
to verify that all NVDs are secure and being used only for 
the purpose stated on the license.  Department requests 
that post conduct a site visit, if possible, in order to 
gather and verify this information and establish the bona 
fides of 
unfamiliar foreign end-user, Southern Lakes Helicopters.  If 
a site visit is 
not possible, please obtain official written confirmation 
of receipt and possession and inform PM/DTCC case officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have a current contract with GONZ agencies 
for performing S&R and EMS operations? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
END ACTION
