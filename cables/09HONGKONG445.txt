HEADLINES AND EXCERPTS: 
 
"Moderation needed in Sino-U.S. war of words" 
 
The independent English-language South China Morning Post said in an 
editorial (3/11):  "Rivalry between China and the U.S. has to be 
carefully managed to prevent relations from nosediving.  Incidents 
have too often in the past turned buoyant ties sour.  Such could 
easily be the case with the confrontation between five Chinese ships 
and a U.S. navy vessel off Hainan Island on Sunday.  Accusations and 
demands for an apology are being carelessly hurled about, and cool 
heads are needed to prevent an escalation....  There is no doubting 
the diplomatic war of words that has resulted, though.  A Foreign 
Ministry official said that Chinese and international law had been 
violated.  China's actions were denounced by a Pentagon spokesman as 
'reckless, dangerous and unprofessional'.  Neither side is budging; 
there is a danger that the sound footing to relations established 
during U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit to 
Beijing last month will be torn asunder....  Moderation is urgently 
needed.  China and the U.S. must work together, not against one 
another.  U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged the right 
diplomatic approach.  Promising Sino-U.S. ties cannot be allowed to 
be squandered." 
 
"Relations are not flawless; China and the U.S. will be benefited by 
cooperating with each other." 
 
The center-left Chinese-language Sing Tao Daily News said in an 
editorial (3/11):  "The U.S. surveillance ship 'Impeccable' was 
harassed by Chinese ships in the South China Sea near Hainan Island. 
 The Chinese government put the blame on the U.S. in a high profile 
incident, reminiscent of the Sino-U.S. military plane crash eight 
years ago.  The incident has cast a shadow over Sino-U.S. military 
relations.  However, it will have very limited impact on their 
bilateral political and economic cooperation....  After U.S. 
Secretary of State Clinton assumed office, she chose Asia as the 
destination of her maiden voyage, and China was the focus of her 
Asia trip.  China and the U.S. need cooperation in political and 
economic areas.  The U.S. also needs China to keep on buying U.S. 
bonds amid the financial tsunami, so that the administration can 
inject large amounts of money to save the economy.  Chinese Foreign 
Minister Yang Jiechi is visiting the U.S. to pave the way for the 
meeting between Chinese President Hu Jintao and President Obama at 
the G20 summit.  The two sides may make use of the dispute this time 
to try to ascertain each other's strength.  Despite the fact that 
their relations are not flawless, the basic principle of 
'cooperation benefits both' will not be changed." 
 
"It's correct to safeguard China's sea rights" 
 
The pro-PRC Chinese-language Wen Wei Po had this editorial (3/11): 
"...Innocent passage of other country's naval ships through China's 
exclusive economic zone is allowed.  However, no activity that will 
harm China's sovereignty is allowed.  The U.S. surveillance ship 
'Impeccable' carried out military surveying in China's exclusive 
economic zone.  This is an act infringing upon China's sovereignty 
and violating international law and Chinese law.  This is a military 
provocation.  China is correct to safeguard its sea rights.  The 
U.S. must stop such an activity.  The current financial tsunami is 
raging.  China and the U.S. should enhance cooperation to combat the 
crisis together and not provoke incidents and spur conflict.  In 
this context, it is unwise for the U.S. naval surveillance ship to 
provoke an incident.  Washington should assess the situation 
correctly.  It should also learn from the lesson that U.S. national 
strength and prestige plummeted as a result of the Bush 
Administration's hegemonic behavior.  Adjusting its unilateral 
foreign policies and maintaining stable Sino-U.S. relations are in 
line with the Obama administration's goal to combat economic 
recession. "
