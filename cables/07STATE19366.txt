¶1.    KALAYE ELECTRIC COMPANY (a.k.a. KALA), 33 Fifteenth 
(15th) Street, Seyed-Jamal-Eddin-Assad Abadi Avenue, Tehran, 
Iran 
 
¶2.    KAVOSHYAR COMPANY (a.k.a. KAAVOSH YAAR; a.k.a. 
KAVOSHYAR), Vanaq Square, Corner of Shiraz Across No. 71, 
Molla Sadra Ave, Tehran, Iran 
 
¶3.    PIONEER ENERGY INDUSTRIES COMPANY (a.k.a. PISHGAM 
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT), P.O. Box 81465-361, Isfahan, Iran 
 
In June 2005, President Bush designated the Atomic Energy 
Organization of Iran (AEOI) in the Annex to Executive Order 
13382 ("Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Proliferators and Their Supporters"). 
 
Kalaye Electric Company and Kavoshyar Company are owned or 
controlled by AEOI and act for or on its behalf. Kalaye has 
been linked to Iran,s centrifuge research and development 
efforts.  Kalaye is also listed in the Annex to UN Security 
Council Resolution 1737 because of its involvement in Iran,s 
nuclear program. Kavoshyar,s sole shareholder is AEOI. 
Pioneer Energy Industries Company provides services to AEOI, 
including technological support. 
 
As you know, the unanimous adoption of UNSCR 1737 on December 
23 establishes a legal obligation for countries to take 
action against the financial underpinnings of Iranian 
proliferation and WMD programs by requiring states to freeze 
the assets that are owned or controlled by, or acting for or 
on behalf of entities and individuals named in the Annex of 
the resolution. 
 
The United States urges you to also take action to freeze the 
assets of entities and individuals explicitly listed in the 
Annex of UNSCR 1737, as well as those entities that are owned 
or controlled by or acting on behalf or at the direction of 
them.  In this regard we hope you will consider actions to 
freeze the assets of the Aerospace Industries Organization 
(AIO), Bank Sepah, and other Iran-related entities the U.S. 
has designated under E.O. 13382. (A full list of the entities 
designated under E.O. 13382 can be found at 
http://www.treas.gov/offices/ 
enforcement/ 
ofac/programs/wmd/wmd.pdf.) 
 
We urge your government to investigate financial 
relationships and transactions in which designated Iranian 
proliferation entities have an interest.  Where it is 
suspected that these relationships and transactions may be 
facilitating Iran,s proliferation activities, we urge you to 
cease dealings with the entities in question. 
 
We look forward to working with you on this and other related 
security matters and are prepared to provide additional 
assistance as appropriate.
