ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND CROSS-STRAITS WARMING 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Hong Kong Government (HKG) has decided to move 
forward with airport upgrade and expansion plans despite the 
combined pressures of the economic crisis and the loss of 
Taiwan passenger volume to cross-strait direct flights. 
During a recent meeting with the Consulate, Airport Authority 
of Hong Kong's (AAHK) CEO Stanley Hui reaffirmed the 
government's commitment to additional infrastructure projects 
for Hong Kong's international transportation and logistics 
development. 
 
¶2. (SBU) One of these projects is the expansion of Hong Kong 
International Airport's (HKIA) midfield.  Plans include the 
construction of additional aircraft stands, apron facilities, 
and a new passenger concourse between HKIA's two existing 
runways.  During his annual Policy Address in October 2009, 
Hong Kong's Chief Executive Donald Tsang referenced this 
project as tangible support for the city's logistics sector, 
one of Hong Kong's traditional pillar industries.  A 
preliminary study of the midfield expansion should be 
completed in early 2010, followed by ground breaking later in 
the year.  AAHK will also unveil in 2010 the airport's 
"Master Plan 2030," a 20-year blueprint for HKIA that would 
likely entail additional land reclamation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Another proposed expansion project is the 
installation of a new air traffic management system (ATMS). 
HKG's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) will accept tenders for 
the ATMS' design, supply and installation until February 5, 
¶2010.  According to Hong Kong's Secretary for Transport and 
Housing Eva Cheng, the new system must be capable of doubling 
the existing system's capacity to meet forecast demand 
through 2025.  The new system will be housed at CAD's new 
administrative headquarters building currently under 
construction.  This venue will also house other value-added 
facilities, such as an auditorium, a training and research 
center, dormitories for students and accident investigators, 
and an aviation exhibits public area.  This public area, 
referred to as the "Education Path," could offer export 
opportunities to U.S. airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and 
aviation service firms hoping to reach audiences at one of 
the world's largest transport hubs. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Air cargo throughput at HKIA rose to 344,000 in 
November 2009, or 16% higher than the same period in 2008. 
Passenger volume and aircraft movements for the month, 
however, declined by 0.4% and 5.2% respectively.  On a 
12-month basis, HKIA recorded 46 million passengers, 3.3 tons 
of cargo, and 280,035 flight movements, representing 
decreases of 5.8%, 12.4%, and 7.3% from 2008. 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to a December 10 HKIA press release, a 21% 
year-on-year rise in Hong Kong resident traffic partially 
offset declining international passenger traffic. 
Transfer/transit passengers fell 12% for the period, a side 
effect of warming relations across the Taiwan Strait.  Having 
historically been a hub for those traveling between Taiwan 
and the Mainland, HKIA has lost about three million 
passengers since the two governments eased direct flight 
restrictions, Hui acknowledged.  To offset this passenger 
loss, HKIA has invested in developing and marketing its 
"multi-modal" capabilities (e.g., air-to-surface, 
air-to-rail, and air-to-water) for those visiting cities in 
China's Pearl River Delta (PRD).  For example, over 300 bus 
trips connect passengers between HKIA and 90 PRD cities 
daily.  Thousands of passengers also travel onward by ferry 
from HKIA's "SkyPier", an adjacent seaport facility 
inaugurated in December 2009 that connects passengers with 
Shekou, Fuyong, Nansha, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and 
Macau.
