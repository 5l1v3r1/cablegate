SUBJECT: ARGENTINA REVIEWING CONTRIBUTION TO UN/AU HYBRID 
OPERATION IN DARFUR 
 
REF: SECSTATE 90022 
 
(SBU) On July 3 Ambassador raised possible Argentine troop 
contributions to the Darfur UN/AU Hybrid Operations with 
Foreign Minister Taiana. Taiana noted that the GoA already 
had 11 Gendarmeria in Sudan as Police Observers.  He said the 
GoA was currently reviewing the possibility of additional 
contributions.  Contacts at the Ministry of Defense reported 
that they are reviewing the possibility of sending a handful 
of Military Observers.  In his comments to the Ambassador, 
Taiana stated that one of the reasons Argentina had pulled 
its engineering platoon out of Kosovo was to give it more 
flexibility to respond to PKO requests, particularly under UN 
auspices.  Taiana made no commitments, and he noted 
Argentina's limited resources, but he told the Ambassador 
that Argentina would like to respond positively.  Post will 
stay in contact with the MFA and MOD and keep Department 
apprised of developments.
