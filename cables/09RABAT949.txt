SUBJECT: 2010 NTE ON THE ARAB LEAGUE BOYCOTT AGAINST ISRAEL 
- MOROCCO 
 
REF: STATE 118797 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: (SBU) Morocco does not enforce the Arab League 
Boycott against Israel and purchases some Israeli goods. 
American firms operating in Morocco have not reported any 
obstacles related to the boycott.  End Summary. 
 
Boycott Not Applied 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Moroccan law contains no specific references to the 
Arab League boycott, and post knows of no 
Government of Morocco (GOM) public statements on the issue. 
While the primary boycott is informally recognized by virtue 
of Morocco's membership in the Arab League, there is no GOM 
treaty, convention, or 
legislation mandating conformity with, or participation in, 
the boycott. The Ministry of Foreign Affair's Office of 
Economic Cooperation and Sectorial Studies verbally 
re-confirmed to Econoff on December 3 that Morocco does not 
enforce the boycott. 
 
Trade with Israel 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Available Moroccan trade statistics do not specify 
the volume of trade with Isreal. Although some trade does 
exist, Post believes that it is listed under the general 
"other" category in the data.   Post has no record of U.S. 
firms facing boycott-related obstacles. 
 
Arab Boycott Meetings 
--------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post does not believe Morocco has attended recent 
Arab League Boycott meetings. MFA officials were not aware of 
such meetings.
