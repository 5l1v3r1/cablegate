¶1.  In response to reftel demarche pressing for high level 
participation at the November 18-19 Regional Economic Cooperation 
Conference (RECC) on Afghanistan in New Delhi, MFA Economic 
Department Head Kemal Kaygisiz emphasized that Turkey assigned great 
importance to Afghan reconstruction and was contributing 
significantly to those efforts.  He welcomed the demarche from the 
USG and said that MFA was still giving serious consideration to the 
Turkey delegation.  He said no firm decision had yet been made 
whether the Foreign Minister would lead the delegation. 
 
¶2.  The Indian Embassy DCM thanked us for coordinating our demarche 
with them, although he was unable to join the meeting.  He said that 
he had been told unofficially that FM Gul could not participate and 
the MFA was considering Deputy Undersecretary for Economic Relations 
Ender Arat.  The DCM also said that they were working on generating 
good participation for the business-to-business forum.
