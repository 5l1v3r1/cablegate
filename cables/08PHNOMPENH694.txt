IMPROVING SITUATION AT PREAH VIHEAR AND IMPROVING BILATERAL 
RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.

¶1. (C) SUMMARY. During the Ambassador's farewell call on 
Prime Minister Hun Sen August 20, the Prime Minister thanked 
the U.S. for its encouragement for a peaceful resolution to 
the dispute over Preah Vihear and expressed his appreciation 
for the Ambassador's contribution to improved relations 
between the two countries.  PM Hun Sen confided that although 
the results of the Cambodian-Thai bilateral talks earlier 
this week still need to be put before the Thai cabinet for 
approval, the results "exceeded (his) expectations."  The PM 
indicated that both sides have agreed to resolve the dispute 
through the Joint Border Commission, and in the context of 
broader issues. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Recognizing that historically U.S.-Cambodian 
relations have been fraught with misunderstandings and 
mistrust, PM Hun Sen expressed his appreciation for the 
marked improvements over the past three years.  He 
highlighted the increasingly robust mil-to-mil relationship, 
exemplified by recent U.S. ship visits and cooperation on MIA 
issues, as well as the presence of Peace Corps volunteers 
throughout Cambodia as indicative of the improved level of 
trust between the two countries.  The Ambassador credited Hun 
Sen's leadership and efforts to understand the U.S. as 
contributing to building a better working relationship to the 
benefit of both countries, while cautioning that 50 years of 
difficult relations will require continued attention by both 
governments to ensure a fully normal and multifaceted 
relationship in the future. 
 
¶3. (C) The Ambassador applauded Hun Sen for exercising 
patience and courage in avoiding armed confrontation over 
Preah Vihear.  Hun Sen confided that the dispute, arising so 
close to the national election, posed a great challenge to 
him and he expressed his gratitude for U.S. support for a 
peaceful resolution to the conflict.  He recalled that 
tensions had risen to the point where Thai and Cambodian 
soldiers had guns pointed directly at each other.  However, 
he gave the order for Cambodian troops to stand down, thus 
abating tensions and allowing room for a diplomatic solution. 
 Hun Sen cited the Russian use of force in Georgia to 
illustrate the point that Thailand and Cambodia narrowly 
escaped a similar fate. 
 
¶4. (C) Dismissing local media's criticism of the outcome of 
the August 18-19 bilateral meeting as narrow-minded 
nationalism, Hun Sen stated that FM Hor Namhong briefed him 
on the outcome of the talks and that the results "exceeded" 
his expectations.  He noted that details of what had been 
agreed would not be discussed publicly until approval by the 
Thai cabinet.  Hun Sen emphasized that the border dispute 
would be resolved in the context of other areas of 
cooperation with Thailand, perhaps referring to the Joint 
Border Commission, which local media report will convene in 
October to take up the border issue.  He also stressed that 
FM Hor Namhong's audience with the Thai king sends a positive 
message regarding both sides' commitment to cooperate to 
resolve the problem peacefully. 
 
¶5. (C) The Ambassador explained continued U.S. support for 
resolution of the dispute.  He noted the advantages of a 
bilateral approach, warning that, while still an option, 
resort to the UNSC could damage relations with Thailand in 
the long term.  He also expressed his hope that the 
statesmanship demonstrated by Hun Sen during this crisis will 
be applied as wisely to his dealings with the political 
opposition following CPP's victory at the July polls. 
 
¶6. (C) Reflecting on the progress achieved in U.S.-Cambodian 
relations, Hun Sen mused that during the 1960s he engaged in 
anti-U.S. protests.  The Ambassador replied that ironically 
during this same time, he was briefly expelled from school 
for organizing protests against the U.S. invasion of 
Cambodia.  The Ambassador explained that while Cambodia has 
changed greatly since then, challenges remain in educating 
Washington to modernize perceptions of Cambodia, which are 
currently colored by the events of the 1970s.  He suggested 
that the upcoming Deputy Secretary's visit to Cambodia 
presents an opportunity to enhance U.S. understanding of 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000694  002 OF 002 
 
 
Cambodia in the twenty-first century and to bring the two 
countries even closer together. 
 
¶7. (C) COMMENT:  The Prime Minister has demonstrated 
increasing maturity, reflected in his government's restrained 
responses to a number of challenges over the past months. 
Hun Sen's cool-headedness in the face of armed conflict with 
an important neighbor is but one example.  Another would 
appear to be the entrenchment of some modest democratic gains 
within the country.  While there remains room for significant 
further progress, Hun Sen deserves some credit for these 
positive developments, as well as progress in the bilateral 
relationship.
