CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 9866 
 
(SBU) Following mid-January delivery of reftel demarche on 
participation at the February 5-8 Saudi counterterrorism 
conference, the MFA's office director-equivalent for 
terrorism and security issues, Claudia Delmas-Scherer, told 
us January 25 that the exact composition of the French 
delegation was still not finalized.  Nevertheless, her office 
had heard that UCLAT head Gilles Leclair would probably lead 
the French delegation.  UCLAT is the counterterrorism 
coordination cell within the Ministry of Interior.  Other 
probable members of the delegation would be Philippe Meunier, 
the MFA's DAS-equivalent for terrorism and security, and 
other officials from the MFA and the DST, France's internal 
intelligence service.  Delmas-Scherer said the French 
delegation planned on presenting two papers at the 
conference: the first would be a "lessons learned" paper and 
the second would focus on the repression of terrorist cells.
