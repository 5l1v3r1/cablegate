SUBJECT: PRT/HERAT: IRAN INVITES PROVINCIAL COUNCIL TO 
MASHAD 
 
¶1. (U)  Members of the Herat Provincial Council participated 
in an Iranian version of the USG's International Visitor (IV) 
program when they were invited by the Iranian Government to 
Mashad, the nearest major Iranian city to Afghanistan. 
Officially, they were invited by the Islamic Council of the 
city and were shown economic sites in Mashad.  They returned 
last week, after having learned more about Mashad,s 
municipality and projects under the city's control.  Several 
noteworthy agreements were concluded, such as the Iranian 
commitment to construct a Technical and Vocational Institute 
in Herat for local high school graduates.  The Iranian 
government will provide lab equipment in seven departments at 
the university, including food-quality testing, saffron 
research, and plant research.  Herat University will receive 
five exchange professors from Mashad University for master's 
degree programs.  Mashad University will also provide several 
scholarship opportunities for Afghan students for one to two 
years. 
 
¶2. (U)  There will be a follow-up visit shortly by another 
delegation from Mashad to further explore avenues of 
collaboration, and representatives of Mashad university, as 
well as vocational and technical institutes, will come to 
Herat.  In addition, the Iranians have pledged additional 
assistance for the Herat university library and have already 
donated substantially, including hundreds of high-quality 
English-language textbooks. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment:  The official visits by delegations from 
Herat and Mashad and the promises of support are not unusual. 
 Throughout history, these two cities have enjoyed close 
relations.  Their proximity makes such exchanges relatively 
economical and easy to arrange.  Large numbers of Afghans 
have settled in the Mashad area, including the families of 
prominent Herati residents.  Family visits, as well as travel 
by Afghans seeking work or to purchase goods in this part of 
Iran are routine.
