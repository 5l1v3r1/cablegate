¶1.  Canadian officials have advised Embassy that they are 
nearly ready to request formally admission to the Asia 
Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate.  They 
report that formal letters, signed by Environment Minister 
John Baird and Foreign Minister Peter MacKay, are being 
readied and should be delivered to appropriate ministers in 
APP capitals by ambassadors or high commissioners before the 
end of June.  Officials in Baird's office advise that the 
funding requested to support Canada's participation in APP is 
in hand.  They believe India and other partners will be 
supportive when the time comes to consider Canada's formal 
request. 
 
¶2.  As for timing, the Canadians hope the upcoming meeting in 
Tokyo of the Policy and Implementation Committee will endorse 
Canadian membership and that the PIC endorsement will be 
finalized when ministers meet in New Delhi later this year. 
 
¶3.  Domestically, Canadian officials continue consultations 
with major industry associations in relevant sectors and, in 
some cases, with individual companies to assess the level of 
interest and explore private sector thinking on projects that 
might be proposed and pursued.  In our own conversations, a 
number of industry groups have expressed significant interest 
in APP and in Canada's partnership in the group.
