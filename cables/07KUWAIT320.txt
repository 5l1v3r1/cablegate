End Summary. 
 
Mass Graves Update 
------------------ 
 
¶2. The 51st session of the TSC was held in Kuwait on 
February 20, 2007. The Kuwaitis and the United States 
opened the meeting by informing the attendees that the 
Kuwaiti delegation had responded to the U.S. Department 
of State liaison to the U.S. National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) by narrowing its 
request for satellite imagery research and analysis of 
areas in Naseriya and Kerbala to a six month period from 
August, 1990 to February, 1991.  The U.S. delegation 
noted that the period was still likely to be too broad 
for the NGA to provide assistance.  The Kuwaiti 
delegation inquired whether it would be possible to have 
single images from one day in each of the six months 
during the identified period.  The Kuwait delegation also 
expressed interest in having its technical experts meet 
with the NGA representative either in Kuwait or the U.S. 
The U.S. delegation agreed to inquire on behalf of the 
Kuwaiti delegation. 
 
Witnesses 
--------- 
 
¶3. Iraq informed about contacts with a witness in Syria 
regarding sites in Kuwait and Iraq.  Kuwait expressed 
interest in meeting with the witness.  The ICRC offered 
its office in Damascus as a possible venue for the 
meeting. 
 
¶4. Kuwait and Iraq agreed to pursue further information 
from another witness regarding gravesites containing 
Kuwaitis.  Kuwait confirmed for the Iraqi delegation that 
there are no legal grounds for detaining witnesses 
coming to Kuwait in connection with TSC investigations. 
 
Closed Cases 
------------ 
 
¶5. No cases were closed since the last TSC meeting in 
November, 2006.  Kuwait reported it had conducted no 
exhumation activities.  Kuwait and Iraq noted that they 
foresee closure of three and two cases respectively during 
the next Tripartite Commission meeting.  Saudi Arabia 
proposed a bilateral agreement between Iraq and Saudi 
Arabia for closure of 59 non-First Gulf War files of 
Iraqis buried in Saudi Arabia, for 29 of which the names 
were known but the exact location of the grave was 
unknown.  The TSC took note of the bilateral agreement 
concerning these cases. 
 
Other Activities 
---------------- 
 
¶6. Iraq submitted four cases for whom families have 
requested the repatriation of human remains from Saudi 
Arabia. 
 
¶7.  Iraq presented new information on three individual 
gravesites in Ramadi, Baghdad International Airport and Abu 
Ghraib.  The Baghdad information was judged not reliable. 
The Ramadi site was to be further researched for its 
reliability.  The Abu Ghraib site was assessed most 
promising and Iraq and Kuwait will coordinate on further 
investigation of the site. 
 
¶8. There was no new information on CAPT. Speicher's case. 
His DNA profile remains in the Kuwaiti database and 
 
KUWAIT 00000320  002 OF 002 
 
 
continues to be checked against all newly received 
profiles. 
 
¶9. Kuwait explained that there were no DNA profiles for the 
human remains repatriated to Iraq from Kuwait on October 
15, 2006 at the Safwan-Abdaly border. 
 
Next TSC Meeting 
---------------- 
 
¶10. The next TSC meeting will take place on June 5, 2007 
in Kuwait at the Sheraton Four Points.  Activities to be 
undertaken before the next session are: 
 
- The U.S. will contact the NGA representative about a 
  possible meeting with Kuwaiti technical experts 
  concerning satellite imagery analysis assistance. 
 
- Iraq will contact the Defense and Interior Ministries 
  about possible visits to Kerbala 3, Nasseriya, Samawa 
  and Najaf. 
 
- Kuwait and Iraq will contact the witness in Syria.
