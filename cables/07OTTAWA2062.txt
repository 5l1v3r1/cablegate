(U) Rick Fehr, Acting Manager, Borders Enforcement Division, 
Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), informed econoff that 
there have been no changes to Canada's laws regarding bulk 
cash smuggling since Embassy Ottawa's last report on the 
subject (ref B).  Canada's laws regarding bulk cash smuggling 
are based on Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and 
are viewed by CBSA as successful.  Travelers entering Canada 
must declare any cash or bearer negotiable assets of a value 
greater than 10,000 Canadian Dollars (roughly 11,000 USD).
