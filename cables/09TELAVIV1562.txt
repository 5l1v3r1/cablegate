SUBJECT: PRESIDENT PERES VISITS ASTANA AND BAKU 
 
REF: BAKU 00527 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Israeli President Shimon Peres, along 
with 3 ministers and a 60 person commercial delegation, 
visited Astana and Baku June 29 - July 1.  The stated purpose 
was to advance the Israeli industrial and business agenda in 
these countries not traditionally considered close diplomatic 
or economic allies of Israel.  Peres, real agenda, however, 
was to demonstrate Israel's ability to reach into Iran's back 
yard.   In Astana, the President delivered the keynote 
address to the Congress of World and Traditional Religions. 
While the Iranian representative walked out of the 
presentation, from the point of view of the President's 
office, the action only served to highlight Iran's isolation 
in the world.  The President's advisors consider the trip an 
outstanding economic and diplomatic success.  They found the 
reception they received in both countries "thrilling," and 
considered President Aliyev's refusal to cave to Iranian 
demands (see reftel) a "brave step." 
 
¶2.  (U) While pursuing his stated goals of advancing Israel's 
interests in 5 specific areas --  clean energy, homeland 
security,  education,  stem cell research,  and water and 
agriculture -- President Peres has been making an effort to 
reach out to less traditional trading partners.  This year he 
chose to target Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.  According to one 
of Peres' diplomatic advisers, the invitation to the 
multi-faith conference was received after these trips were 
planned and conveniently coincided with the visit to Astana. 
In this first state visit since the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between Israel and these two Muslim 
states, President Peres was welcomed by Presidents Aliyev and 
Nazabayev with whom he discussed the full panoply of 
bi-lateral and regional issues.  The president was joined by 
almost 60 business men and women as well as the ministers of 
Industry and Trade, Cultural and Sport, and Infrastructure. 
The GOI sponsored conferences in both capitols in an effort 
to increase business to business contacts.  Additionally the 
ministers held bi-lateral meetings with their counterparts 
seeking greater cooperation in their respective fields. 
Finally the president met with representatives of the Jewish 
communities of both countries. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The President's office considers the trip an 
unqualified success on both the diplomatic and business 
fronts.  Although press reports focused on the actions of the 
Iranian delegate who walked out of the multi-faith conference 
during Peres, speech, his staff minimized the importance of 
this event.  From their perspective, it was a sea change in 
Muslim attitudes toward Israel.  There were many Muslim 
participants in the Conference, and the Iranian 
representative was the only one to walk out.  As the 
president said, "Iran has learned that it is all alone." 
¶4. U) The President came back from the trip with several 
concrete deliverables.  Bi-lateral trade and development 
agreements were signed in both countries.  Most notable in 
Astana were a space technology agreement and agriculture, 
communications and construction projects.  As mentioned in 
reftel, Israel and Azerbaijan announced cooperation on road 
construction projects and in the area of defense technology. 
Several MOU's for business cooperation were signed by members 
of the delegations as well.  They also attracted 
ground-breaking Kazakh investment in an  Israeli agricultural 
research center.  They seem most pleased with the President's 
efforts to "push forward" diplomatic relations with 
Azerbaijan, a country with no diplomatic presence in Israel. 
¶5. (U) Our contact in the President's office seemed surprised 
by the relative lack of protest in either country to their 
trip.  They described a &heartfelt8 welcome from both the 
governments and peoples.  Israeli flags flew along their 
motorcade routes.  Every request from the advance team was 
met and often exceeded.  Finally, they expressed deep 
appreciation for the actions of President Aliyev in ignoring 
Iranian demands to cancel the visit, even after the Iranians 
withdrew their ambassador in protest. 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment.  Peres has long been a booster of Israeli 
relations with Turkey.  His engagement with the Turks may 
have contributed to his interest in developing Israel's ties 
with Caspian and Central Asian states.  Israel has real 
expertise to offer Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, but equally 
important in Israeli eyes was Peres, success in showing the 
flag in Iran's back yard.  End comment.
