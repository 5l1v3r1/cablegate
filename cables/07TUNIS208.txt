COOPERATION 
 
REF: TUNIS 105 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: During the Ambassador's February 8 courtesy 
call, Minister of Agriculture Habib Haddad presented a list 
of possible projects for future collaboration with US 
universities.  Haddad stated that liberalization of cereal 
imports is being studied and also asserted that the 
agricultural sector is well-organized to confront avian 
influenza.  Ambassador expressed interest in increasing both 
USG and private sector engagement in the agricultural sector. 
 End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During his courtesy call with the Ambassador, 
Minister of Agriculture Habib Haddad stressed the importance 
of US cooperation and investment.  Haddad noted that many 
Tunisians had benefited from scholarship and exchange 
programs such as the Cochran, Fulbright, and Borlaug 
Fellowships, and hoped that the number of Tunisians able to 
benefit from these fellowships would increase.  In the course 
of the meeting, Professor Abdelaziz Mougou, President of the 
Institute for Research and Higher Education in Agriculture 
(part of the Ministry of Agriculture), presented a list of 
possible projects for cooperative research between US 
universities and Tunisian research institutes in the areas of 
integrated pest management, dairy productivity, saline 
agriculture, and sustainable land management.  Haddad also 
noted his interest in developing organic agriculture in 
Tunisia and mentioned certification of organic products as a 
possible area for USG assistance.  Ambassador raised the 
possibility of a USG economic delegation (reftel) and/or 
trade mission, ideas that were enthusiastically received by 
Minister Haddad.  In response to Ambassador's question about 
liberalization of the cereal sector, Haddad stated that the 
Ministry is "studying" what parts of the sector might be 
liberalized.  (Note: The state-run Office of Cereals 
maintains a monopoly on cereal imports.  End Note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) In discussing GOT preparedness to deal with avian 
influenza (AI), Haddad asserted that the agricultural sector 
is well-organized and noted that there have as yet been no 
cases in Tunisia.  The GOT has established an 
inter-ministerial commission on AI and has drafted a manual 
of procedures that will be followed in the event AI is 
discovered.  The GOT has stopped the sale of live chickens 
and also continues to monitor and test poultry for the virus. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: As we seek to expand the breadth and 
increase the level of economic engagement in Tunisia, the 
agricultural sector presents an area with opportunities for 
cooperation not only with the USG, but also with private 
trade organizations (such as the USDA cooperators), 
companies, and universities.  In conjunction with any USG 
economic delegation or trade mission, Post would encourage 
the inclusion of an agricultural representative.  The recent 
GOT focus on increasing educational exchange and linkages 
highlights an additional area for possible collaboration 
between the GOT and United States.  End Comment.
