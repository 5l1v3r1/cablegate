IN SOUTHERN LEBANON 

Classified By: Ambassador Jeffrey D. Feltman.  Reason: Section 1.4 (d). 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1.  (C)  On March 3, econoff and epartment NEA/ELA Deputy 
Director met with UN Political Officers Imran Riza and 
Georges Nasr of the office of UNSYG's Personal Representative 
to Lebanon Geir Pederson.  Riza said that the GOL's Joint 
Security Force (JSF) had modestly increased its presence in 
southern Lebanon and had been more visible in conducting 
patrols.  Riza welcomed this development, especially in 
conjunction with the Lebanese army's opening of liaison 
offices at the UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura and with the 
Ghanaian and Indian battalions.  Riza hoped for more 
cooperation in the future, noting that Geir Pederson had 
recently met with Defense Minister Elias Murr who assured him 
that he had ordered the army to stop arms shipments to 
Hizballah from Syria.  Hizballah is maintaining calm along 
the Blue Line and has not reacted to the increased JSF 
presence, according to Riza.  He added that Hizballah 
officials told UNIFIL that they consider only the immediate 
area along the Blue Line to be Hizballah's area of 
responsibility, not the whole south.  End summary. 
 
INCREASED GOL SECURITY PRESENCE 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  In a March 3 meeting, UN Political Officers Imran 
Riza and Georges Nasr reported that the Lebanese Joint 
Security Force (JSF) has increased its presence and activity 
in southern Lebanon.  The JSF, a combined Internal Security 
Forces and Lebanese military police task force under Ministry 
of Interior control, is now numbering some 400-500 personnel 
actually deployed in southern Lebanon, according to Riza. 
The number of JSF personnel has increased slightly in recent 
months, but is still below its advertised troop level of 
1,000.  In addition to the modest increase in troop strength, 
the JSF is also conducting more patrols and demonstrating a 
greater visibility.  Riza estimated that there may be as many 
as 100 JSF personnel deployed in Naqoura. 
 
¶3.  (C)  The up-tick in JSF presence is a positive 
development following the establishment of JSF and Lebanese 
army liaison cells co-located with UNIFIL earlier this year. 
Lebanese army liaison officers are now co-located with UNIFIL 
staff at UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura and at the 
headquarters of the Ghanaian battalion and the Indian 
battalion.  A Chinese engineering battalion is due to arrive 
soon to replace the Ukrainian battalion accused of 
malfeasance.  Riza expressed optimism about these 
developments but hoped for more GOL cooperation in the future. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Riza said that UNSYG Personal Representative to 
Lebanon Geir Pederson had met with Defense Minister Elias 
Murr and Lebanese army Chief of Staff Gen. Michel Sleiman 
regarding reports that the Lebanese army allowed arms 
shipments from Syria to reach Hizballah.  According to Riza, 
Murr told Pederson that it appeared to have been an "internal 
transfer."  Murr promised Pederson that he has issued 
instructions that this not happen again.  Sleiman claimed the 
Lebanese military did not observe the arms transfer, but 
confirmed that he issued orders to prevent another such 
incident.  Riza commented that Hizballah does not need any 
more weapons.  Hizballah has plenty of arms and ammunition to 
continue its intermittent, low-intensity attacks on Israeli 
Blue Line positions for a long time.  Besides, Riza added, 
many of Hizballah's attacks in the Sheba'a Farms are more for 
demonstration of capabilities than any significant military 
effect. 
 
HIZBALLAH KEEPING QUIET 
----------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  Riza said that Hizballah officials have told him 
that they have no interest in any fighting along the Blue 
Line at this time.  It was clear that Hizballah had nothing 
to do with the rocket attack on Kiryat Shemona in late 
December, he said.  Riza sensed that Hizballah had appeared 
upset that another group had attacked Israel from its 
territory without seeking permission.  Right now, the only 
Hizballah military activity of note is its ongoing 
psychological warfare to keep Israeli forces in a state of 
perpetual alert.  Hizballah is making military movements that 
the Israelis could interpret as preparations for an attack, 
but then does not carry out the operation, according to Riza. 
 On a side note, Riza added that the water dispute around 
Ghajar has been quiet this winter.  Israeli airspace 
violations are continuing, but at a slightly reduced level, 
according to Riza and Nasr. 
 
¶6.  (C)  Riza and Nasr noted that Hizballah has not reacted 
to the increased JSF presence in southern Lebanon.  Hizballah 
officials told UNIFIL that Hizballah's area of responsibility 
is the immediate border area along the Blue Line, not the 
whole south.  This seemed to imply that Hizballah 
acknowledges the GOL's right to exercise control over most of 
southern Lebanon except for the area of the border with 
Israel and Israeli-occupied territory.  Riza also noted that 
Hizballah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah recently said 
that security in Quthern Lebanon is the responsibility of 
the government.
