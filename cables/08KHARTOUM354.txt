¶1. (U) This is an action request, please see paragraphs 3 and 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Deputy SRSG Amira Haq and World Bank Country Manager Asif 
Faiz asked CDA Fernandez March 9 for U.S. assistance with the agenda 
and venue of the Sudan Consortium, due to take place in Paris May 
6-8.  According to Haq these are the only dates that will work due 
to the planned national census in Sudan at the end of April and the 
SPLM Congress in May. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The most difficult issue is where Darfur should figure on 
the Consortium agenda, with the GOS requesting that Darfur be 
discussed at the end of the Consortium and most donors expressing a 
preference to discuss Darfur first.  The EC and Canada have even 
suggested not holding a Consortium meeting due to the recent GOS 
escalation of attacks in West Darfur.  D/SRSG Haq and CDA Fernandez 
agreed this would be counter-productive and would play into the 
hands of the regime, who have little to gain from the Consortium 
since most of the assistance pledged will be for the South and 
Darfur.  Haq requested U.S. assistance convincing the EC, Canada, 
and other donors to accept a compromise: discuss Darfur up front but 
in a closed-door "constructive" session focused on the way forward. 
Haq believes that the GOS will accept this compromise, based on her 
discussions with MFA U/S Mutriff Siddiq, who does not want the 
Darfur portion of the agenda to turn into a GOS-bashing session. 
(Note: The SPLM, for its part, does not want Darfur included on the 
agenda. End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Haq also requested U.S. assistance with the venue.  Since 
the World Bank venue in Paris is not available during May 6-8 (she 
has not received replies from the OECD and UNESCO) Haq asked whether 
the U.S. would object to the World Bank hosting the Consortium in 
Washington.  CDA Fernandez observed that Paris is reportedly keen to 
host and that Washington may have some objections given the short 
time frame, but that we would communicate her request. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post would appreciate feedback on these proposals so we may 
share them with D/SRSG Haq and her staff.
