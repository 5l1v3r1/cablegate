 ¶1. Econoff delivered reftel demarche December 10 to MFA's 
Juan Luis Munoz de Laborde, explaining the US's position on 
funding the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the 
2009-2010 budget and beyond.  Munoz de Laborde, who is the 
Deputy Director for Multilateral Economic Relations, 
expressed his appreciation for the US position clarification 
prior to the December 16-17 Paris meetings. 
 
¶2. After consulting with representatives of the Ministry of 
Industry and the Spanish Embassy to the OECD, Munoz de 
Laborde offered on December 15 the following GOS position. 
First, the GOS in principle is in favor of "scale of 
contribution" reform.  According to Munoz de Laborde, this 
reform would allow Spain to make adjustments in relation to 
its economic reality, although it likely would not greatly 
affect the level of Spain's contribution since Spain is a 
mid-size OECD participant.  Second, the GOS is in favor of 
supporting zero real growth funding, arguing that since the 
IEA budget has been frozen for about a decade, zero nominal 
growth might be too restrictive.
