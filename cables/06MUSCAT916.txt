SUBJECT: OMANIS GRUMBLE OVER ALLEGED USG REMARK ON STRAIT 
OF HORMUZ 
 
¶1. (SBU) In recent days, popular Omani on-line message board 
al-Sablah has featured animated and overwhelmingly negative 
reactions to a USG official's alleged remark about the Strait 
of Hormuz on the al-Jazeera television network.  Allegedly 
responding to statements from Iran that it could close off 
the Strait of Hormuz in the event of war, the unnamed U.S. 
official reportedly stated, "We will take control of the 
whole Strait even before Iran realizes it." 
 
¶2. (SBU) The statement provoked anger from al-Sablah 
participants who questioned whether the U.S. plans to ignore 
Oman's sovereignty in the Strait.  Participants expressed 
even deeper concern over Oman's underwhelming naval strength 
when compared to those of Iran and GCC neighbors.  Many 
bloggers dismissed the Sultanate's role in controlling the 
Strait of Hormuz as marginal at best and doubted whether Oman 
has the power to face U.S. or Iranian forces in a showdown. 
The topic generated 2,426 hits and 104 responses, mainly 
expressing disappointment toward the Sultanate's inability to 
reign supreme even in its own sovereign territorial waters.
