¶1.  Lawrence Livermore representative Roger Miller and 
Department of Energy representative Richard Nephew briefed 
the MFA's Assistant Minister for American Affairs Ali al 
Hefny and MFA disarmament specialists on Iran's Gas 
Centrifuge Program on January 29.  Al Hefny said Egypt 
appreciated the opportunity to continue engaging with the 
U.S. on the Iran issue and noted that Egypt shared the USG's 
concerns.  He also flagged Egypt's concern about Israel and 
said the GOE's goal is to create a zone in the Middle East 
free of WMD.   Al Hefny urged the U.S. to consider regional 
perspectives on the WMD threat and to take an "even-handed" 
approach. 
 
¶2.   MFA's disarmament experts asked the DOE team: 
 
-- if the U.S. knows exactly what Iran has achieved. 
-- if the U.S. knows how long it would take for Iran to 
complete its pilot program. 
-- if the U.S. knows of any clandestine facilities in Iran 
where enrichment technology is being developed. 
-- if the U.S. endorses the Russian proposal 
-- if the U.S. is worried that Iran will make good on its 
threats to end diplomacy (and possibly pull out of the NPT) 
if the IAEA refers it to the UNSC. 
 
¶3.  Miller replied that we don't know exactly what Iran has 
achieved, but it may not need a significant amount of time to 
complete the pilot program.  Miller also noted that it is 
easier for Iran to conceal a clandestine facility behind a 
declared facility.  On the Russian proposal, Miller said U.S. 
support depends on the ability to ensure that Iran does not 
have access to enrichment technology.  On the risk of 
referral, Miller acknowledged Iran's threats, but cited 
Iran's interest in remaining within the NPT regime.  Iran's 
threats are not, he noted, a reason to ignore the 
requirements of the NPT regime.  Nephew added that unlike the 
case of North Korea before it withdrew from the NPT, Iran has 
more political and economic interests to remain in the 
regime.
