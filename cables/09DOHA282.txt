CEASEFIRES WITH GOS AND JEM 
 
---------------- 
(SBU) KEY POINTS 
---------------- 
 
-- Special Envoy for Sudan Scott Gration encouraged a 
delegation of SLA/Unity members in Doha April 28 to help him 
resolve the big isQ in Sudan by starting first with 
bringing security and ending human suffering in Darfur. 
 
-- The delegation responded by pledging full cooperation, 
noting that two cease-fires are needed:  one between the 
Government of Sudan and the rebels and another between JEM 
and other rebel groups. 
 
-- The delegation said it would take back to its leaders in 
Sudan early May dates for a return to Qatar for more 
mediation but thought the dates too early. 
 
-------------- 
(SBU) COMMENTS 
-------------- 
 
-- SLA/Unity's urgent interest in Doha indicates three 
important new trends: (1) JEM is increasingly hostile to any 
armed group that does not acquiesce to their leadership and 
control; (2) SLA/Unity is reaching out to Darfur Peace 
Agreement signatory, Minni Minawi, and Fur hold-out leader 
Abdelwahid Nur, in an effort to create a counter to JEM's 
grab on other armed groups; and (3) SLA/Unity's hurried 
outreach to the Doha process, AU/UN Chief Mediator, and the 
U.S. Special Envoy indicates concern that they and others 
have in the increasingly likely scenario that Darfur could be 
ruled by JEM (the "Hamas of Darfur" as SLA/Unity called them) 
and the fear in which the lead up to the rainy season and 
JEM's final assault on other non-signatories will bring. 
 
End Key Points and Comments. 
 
¶1. (SBU) In an April 28 meeting with members of SLA/Unity in 
Doha (Uthman Bushra, Mahjoub Hussein, Sayyed Charif Jar 
an-Nabi and Fathi Uthman), Special Envoy for Sudan Gration 
(joined by Ambassador, S/USSES Deputy Tim Shortley and P/E 
Chief Rice) introduced himself as the U.S. envoy "for all of 
Sudan and its needs."  These include water, sanitation, 
health care, and food.  To this end, the Special Envoy (SE) 
noted he was working to bring back NGOs following their 
expulsion by the Government of Sudan (GOS).  He said he had 
succeeded in having the GOS tone down its rhetoric on "spies 
and thieves" in the ranks of the opposition. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Nothing, however, noted SE Gration, would be truly 
fixed before there is security on the ground.  Thus, it is 
imperative to incentivize a cease-fire by providing 
reconstruction and development that increases progressively 
the longer the cease-fire lasts.  Solving the humanitarian 
problems while we work on larger issues is also imperative. 
Finally, SE Gration encouraged the SLA/Unity to finalize a 
cease-fire agreement with the GOS and other opposition groups 
in early May. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The delegation responded by expressing its desire to 
cooperate fully and end the fighting and suffering in Sudan. 
SLA/Unity has conditioned its participation in a cease-fire 
on the return of the NGOs, so the group was pleased to learn 
of the progress in that area.  "We are suffering and very 
much want peace" but ask that the NGOs not be from the Arab 
League, Q the delegation members. 
 
¶4. (SBU) CEASE-FIRE:  SLA/Unity lamented that its membership 
was "fighting in the north" with Khalil Ibrahim.  This was 
"not good, as we should all be working against the GOS." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Asked whose participation in a cease-fire would be 
critical to its success, the interlocutors told SE Gration 
that SLA/Unity, Khalil Ibrahim's JEM, Abdul Wahid's SLM/AW 
and their supporters have the weapons and, thus, must be 
drawn in if the cease-fire will work. 
 
¶6. (SBU) SE Gration said he was committed to raising money 
from private donors to incentivize development in areas where 
armed groups maintain the cease-fire.  Groups like SLA/Unity 
would be able to program reconstruction and development 
investments in areas under their control within broad 
categories such as education, health, and agriculture. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Special Envoy stressed that a cease-fire needs 
to be established quickly and collective monitoring measures 
put in place.  SLA/Unity and other groups opposing the GOS 
need to be part of monitoring the cease-fire.  With a 
 
DOHA 00000282  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
cease-fire established, said SE Gration, we will be able to 
lay the groundwork for economic development and the creation 
of prosperity that is sorely needed in Darfur. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The SLA/Unity delegation responded by underscoring 
the need for two separate cease-fires in Darfur.  One between 
the GOS and the rebels, and another between the rebels and 
JEM.  The delegation added that SLA/Unity accepts to work 
with SE Gration toward a cease-fire and appreciates U.S. 
willingness to do right by Sudan. 
 
¶9. (SBU) SE Gration asked SLA/Unity to take action by 
returning to Doha May 4-5, under an expected Government of 
Qatar invitation, to move forward on power sharing and the 
future status of Darfur.  The delegation said it would 
consider this request but thought the May 4-5 deadline too 
early. 
 
¶10. (SBU) FUTURE OF SUDAN:  SE Gration stressed that he does 
not want to see Sudan break apart.  A cease-fire is sorely 
needed, as well as steps toward lasting security and viable 
economic development.  While it sounds hard, SE Gration 
encouraged SLA/Unity and other opposition groups to take the 
decision to "disarm and then do it fairly."  He said he would 
push this in discussions in Chad and elsewhere in the region. 
 
 
¶11. (SBU)  UNAMID:  Asked what the role of UNAMID should be 
in Sudan, SLA/Unity members noted that UNAMID soldiers do not 
protect "our civilians 100 percent," and are not coordinating 
with us.  European soldiers would be preferable.  The members 
added that "forces need to be in areas where there is no 
government control." 
 
¶12. (U) SE Gration has cleared this message.
