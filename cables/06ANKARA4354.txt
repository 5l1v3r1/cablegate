¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Of the 1,700 evacuees received in Turkey, 
approximately 700 remain on the Incirlik Air Base as of July 28, 
awaiting chartered aircraft.  All three of the flights scheduled to 
depart July 28 were canceled.  These repeated cancellations and 
delays are seriously undermining morale on the ground.  Conoffs at 
Incirlik sent approximately fifty-five humanitarian parole requests 
to DHS for processing and recommended against parole in only four 
cases.  DHS officers (2 from Frankfurt and 2 from Rome) are 
scheduled to arrive July 28 at circa 2100 hours to assist with any 
additional processing at Incirlik.  Incirlik's base commander 
expects all evacuees awaiting DHS processing to be off base by 
August 2.  End Summary. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) All three flights scheduled to depart Incirlik July 28 were 
canceled. Evacuees are growing weary of delays and cancellations, 
and their morale and patience is quickly deteriorating.  Yesterday, 
thirty Amcits marched into our control room demanding to speak to 
"whoever was in charge of the operation" after receiving news of yet 
another flight cancellation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Evacuees to Turkey were typically well funded, and to date 
Conoffs have not had any loan requests.  The one remaining medical 
case, involving evacuation of an Amcit with an oxygen tank, was 
resolved when said Amcit decided to purchase his own ticket with 
cash on a commercial carrier. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Conoffs submitted fifty-five humanitarian parole requests 
to DHS, recommending against parole in only four cases.  Thus far 
Conoffs have received two positive responses from DHS for onward 
travel from humanitarian requests and hope to have all pending cases 
resolved by COB in Washington July 28.  DHS officers (2 from 
Frankfurt and 2 from Rome) are scheduled to arrive tonight at circa 
2100 hours to assist with any additional processing at Incirlik. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Incirlik base commander expects all evacuees awaiting DHS 
processing to be off base by August 2.  We do not currently 
anticipate the need to house any evacuees at Incirlik beyond August 
2ND.
