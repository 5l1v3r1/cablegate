SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (U) On October 25, Anbar Governorate Electoral Office 
(GEO) Director Khalid Rajab met with PRT PolOff and MNF-West 
to discuss coalition formation, candidate nominations, 
election observer preparations, and security preparations for 
2009 Anbar provincial elections.  The Anbar GEO has completed 
the first drafts of the security plan, the logistics plan, 
and the media plan for the elections.  He confirmed that the 
Iraqi Police in conjunction with the Anbar GEO have completed 
security assessments for all 277 polling centers planned for 
Anbar.  He suggested having one coalition force (CF) person 
at the Anbar GEO Operations Center on Election Day in order 
to facilitate a rapid response to problems that may arise. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
ELECTION OBSERVERS AND POLLING STATIONS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Khalid Rajab, the Anbar GEO, stated that trained 
election observers were critical to the success of the 
provincial elections, and that these election observers need 
to be educated people well-trained for this task.  He told of 
one election observer during the voter registration period 
who went to a voter registration center, put his name on the 
observer list and immediately left without observing 
anything.  Due to stories like this, Khalid wants to ensure 
the observers are "good people" who know what their 
responsibilities are.  He also noted that some Anbaris are 
passing incorrect information about the elections and 
election observers.  According to the Anbar GEO, neither the 
election observer registration period the training course for 
observers has been defined.  He plans to conduct one-day 
training courses for all registered observers before election 
day. 
 
¶4. (U) According to Khalid, Civil Society Organizations will 
have to register with the Anbar GEO Media Advisor for 
observer training.  Khalid estimates that there will be at 
least 1,933 observers; 116 of these observers will be 
assigned to polling centers in remote areas of Anbar.  He 
noted that there were 1,227 registered observers for the 
voter registration period, many of whom provided reports to 
the Anbar GEO.  Khalid noted that voter registration was 
successful and uneventful, and believed elections would also 
be uneventful. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The GEO has also verified the location and security 
needs for all of the planned 277 polling centers.  Each of 
the 277 polling centers will have multiple ballot boxes in 
order to service the projected 440,000  voters.  The GEO is 
planning on 400 voters per ballot box, with several ballot 
boxes in each polling center.  The Iraqi Police will vote a 
few days prior to the election in specified voting centers. 
The Anbar GEO also plans to support detainee and hospital 
patient voting.  He suggested having one coalition force (CF) 
person at the Anbar GEO Operations Center on Election Day in 
order to facilitate a rapid response to problems that may 
arise.  Otherwise, the GEO did not want to have CF visible to 
the public at the polling stations or elsewhere. 
 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Anbar GEO, in conjunction with the Iraqi Police, 
has conducted security assessments of all of the 277 polling 
centers.  He noted that there were no "hot spots" in Anbar 
requiring significantly increased security.  Khalid did 
however note that there were two locations which had 
unresolved security issues, one in Gharmah and one in Rutbah, 
and three areas with a potential for violence during the 
election that concerned him: Fallujah/Gharma Area, 
Humayra/Angur in Ramadi, and Hit. 
 
¶7. (U) During last spring and summer, Anbari notable Hamid 
Heiss's unfiltered public comments raised Khalid's concern 
(Heiss said that the Independent High Electoral Commission 
was an IIP organization and that Khalid Rajab was an IIP 
hack).  Since meeting with him in September 2008, Khalid 
Rajab indicates that he and Heiss now have a healthy 
dialogue.  However, as the elections draw near, Khalid Rajab 
is understandably concerned that renewed saber rattling from 
any parties will undermine peaceful elections. 
 
POTENTIAL REASONS FOR LOW VOTER PARTICIPATION 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
BAGHDAD 00003626  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶8. (U) Khalid noted four main reasons why Anbaris might not 
vote in the upcoming provincial elections: 
-- They do not trust the process. 
-- They are illiterate. 
-- They are women. 
-- Some will just stay away. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) GEO Director Khalid Rajab showed PolOff and MNF-West 
the completed Security, Logistics, and Media Plans for the 
Provincial Elections, confirming that that they have been 
coordinated with their appropriate Iraqi counterparts.  He 
agreed to provide a copy of the plans to MNF-W and the PRT to 
support coordination in the coming week.  The Anbar GEO 
continues the high quality performance that made the voter 
registration period successful.  END COMMENT.
