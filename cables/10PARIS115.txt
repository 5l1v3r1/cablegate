SUBJECT: Request for Guidance on USG Bluefin Tuna Policy in CITES 
 
Ref: 09 STATE 125262 
 
¶1. (SBU) Since January 2009 when the USG listed France as a country 
that tolerates Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, 
French public attention to the depletion of Mediterranean and 
Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks has grown.  More importantly, 
Prince Albert of Monaco has asked me  about the USG policy toward 
his proposal to list bluefin tuna under CITES Appendix I.  Embassy 
Paris understands that at the end of this week, the GOF may make a 
decision on supporting either Appendix I or Appendix II status for 
bluefin tuna, and the French press will certainly seek our position 
as well.  I fully expect that this issue will be discussed during my 
forthcoming lunch with forty French Senators. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Department, and OES in particular, appear to be on the 
verge of success in rousing the French to action.  I applaud your 
sustained effort.  To gather the full benefit, I would greatly 
appreciate receiving forward-leaning guidance as soon as possible on 
our bluefin tuna policy that I can use with Prince Albert, with the 
Government of France, and with the French public.
