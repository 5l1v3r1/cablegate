Dear Michael, 
 
Following your query regarding license 50-1001523 and your 
post-shipment check, here are our findings. 
 
Seventeen (17) dynamic/differential units (DMU) were received 
by Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI)/Malat Division. 
 
Fifteen (15) of them were supplied to the Israeli Air Force 
(IAF) for the Heron-1 UAV system.  The other two items were 
kept in IAI/Malat's stock for future use by the IAF Heron-1 
UAV. 
 
Your query also mentioned User Manuals.  We were quite 
puzzled by this part of your query since our records did not 
show any supply of user manuals.  Finally, we checked the 
issue with Crossbow Technology, and they confirmed that the 
User Manuals were listed on any related purchase orders, and 
have never been included with any VG700MB-201 shipments to 
Malat.  (This is the reason for the long delay in our 
response.)  Please find enclosed the letter from Crossbow 
Technology. 
 
With my best and warm regards, 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Rami Yungman

Security Director of IAI/Malat Division:

Attention:  Mr. Ido Shalit, Deputy Corporate Security Director 
 
Reference:  VG700MB-201 Contents of Shipment 
 
Dear Mr. Shalit, 
 
Crossbow Technology, Inc. (Crossbow) has been supplying the 
VG700MB-201 Dynamic Measurement Unit (P/N 8350-0281-01), and 
earlier versions of this product, to Israeli Aerospace 
Industries Malat Division (Malat) for many years. 
 
We understand that there is some confusion with recent 
shipments because the US State Department export license (ref 
number 1001523) includes a line item for the User's Manual of 
this product. 
 
Please note that the User's Manual is not called out on any 
related purchase orders, and has never been included with any 
 
VG700MB-201 shipments to Malat. 
 
Sincerely,
