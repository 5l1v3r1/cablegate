Turkey Continues Cross-Border Operation in N. Iraq 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶1. Turkey carried out air strikes against PKK terrorist positions in 
northern Iraq on January 15.  Turkish General Staff (TGS) announced 
that over 60 targets were hit.  Counter-terrorism operations within 
Southeast Turkey against PKK terrorists continued during month.  TGS 
reported that 36 terrorists were captured and 17 surrendered in the 
operations in Southeast, while no information on the number of 
casualties in the cross-border operation was released. 
 
 
Anti-Terrorism High Council Convenes 
---------------------------------- 
¶2. The Anti-Terrorism High Council convened under Deputy Prime 
Minister Cemil Cicek on January 23.  Cabinet members, high-level 
military and intelligence officials participated in the meeting.  A 
statement released following the meeting noted that the Council 
assessed the ongoing counter-terrorism activities and discussed 
diplomatic, economic, social and other measures to be taken against 
terrorism.  The Council, as reported by the semi-official Anatolian 
News Agency (ANA), reiterated Turkey's determination to combat 
terrorism and assessed that on-going military operations have been 
effective against PKK terrorists based in northern Iraq. 
 
 
Retired General Detained for Weapons, Assassination Plots 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3. Thirty-three persons, including retired BG Veli Kucuk (one of the 
founders of the Turkish Jandarma's intelligence unit JITEM) and ret. 
COL Fikri Karadag, were arrested on the grounds that they are 
members of an illegal organization code-named 'Ergenekon.'  The 
investigation began with the discovery of grenades eight months ago 
in a house in Umraniye district of Istanbul.  Ergenekon has been 
linked by police to a number of attacks, including the January 2007 
murder of Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, February 2006 murder of an 
Italian priest in Trabzon and the May 2006 Council of State killings 
in Ankara.  Turkish dailies reported that all of the revealed 
members of the organization are public servants, many of whom are 
former intelligence officers. Various pro-AKP and centralist dailies 
reported that 'Ergenekon' planned to create a chaos in Turkey 
through bombings in order to prepare the ground for a coup in 2009. 
The investigation is on-going.

officers have been trained at the NATO's Partnership for Peace
