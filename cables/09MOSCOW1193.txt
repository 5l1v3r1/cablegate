¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-users, Delta Component and FSUE RNII KP, 
Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license application 
D414202 as the ultimate consignee of 24 flash modules Q IC and 23 IC 
- amplifiers AD8041SQ. These items are controlled for national 
security and nuclear non-proliferation reasons under ECCN 3A001. The 
licensee is Norcatec LLC., 100 Garden City Plaza, Garden City, NY 
¶11530. 
 
¶3. On April 27, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of FSUE QRussian Institute of Space Device Engineering 
(FSUE QRISDEQ), 53 Aviamotornaya Street, Moscow, Russia. The export 
control team met with Vladimir Gorkovoi, Deputy General Director, 
Delta Component and Chief of Purchasing Department of FSUE QRISDEQ, 
Grigory Stupak, Deputy General Director, FSUE QRISDEQ and Dmitry 
Chernov, Deputy General-Designer Director, FSUE QRISDEQ. 
 
¶4. The FSUE QRISDEQ was established in 1946, and has become one of 
the pioneer enterprises in the Russian Space Industry. The Institute 
is involved in the development, production, operation and 
maintenance of multi-functional space and ground-based systems. 
Delta Components was established as a procurement/trading company 
that sells equipment to the FSUE QRISDEQ.  Delta was founded in 
2006, and purchases from distribution companies in Russia. 
 
¶5. The FSUE QRISDEQ team presented a comprehensive PowerPoint 
presentation to the export control team covering the intended use of 
the reftel commodities. According to the FSUE QRISDEQ presentation, 
the reftel commodities will be used to upgrade the 3rd generation 
Russian GLONASS Global Positioning System.  GLONASS is a 
constellation of satellites which provide a geopositioning 
reference. The reftel commodities, once in use in the GLONASS 
system, will enable GLONASS to operate without interference with 
other geopositioning satellite systems in use, increase its 
reliability and accuracy and offer an interconnect ability to them. 
 
¶6. The Moscow export control team found FSUE QRISDEQ to have the 
technical and commercial sophistication necessary for use of the 
reftel commodities. They have a legitimate need, and a legitimate 
end use. 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post recommends Delta Component and FSUE RNII KP 
(FSUE QRISDEQ), Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities.
