¶1. (SBU) Brazil views Dinah Shelton very favorably but may have to 
vote for another candidate to repay obligations incurred in another 
election.  Counselor Marcia Adorno, head of the Ministry of Exterior 
Relations's Division of Human Rights, told poloff on April 2 that 
she was familiar with Dinah Shelton's curriculum and that it is very 
impressive, but could not now give us an answer on Brazil's voting 
position due to the pending agreements that have been made with 
three other countries in exchange for their support of Brazilian 
Judge Antonio Augusto Cancado Trindade, who was elected to the 
International Court of Justice last month.  She pointed out that the 
U.S. abstained from voting in that election. 
 
¶2. (U) Adorno offered that the final voting decision would be made 
at a higher level and that she would be able to advise us of their 
voting plans approximately 15 days before the general assembly in 
June.  She shared that they will consider Professor Shelton and that 
she hopes they can support her.
