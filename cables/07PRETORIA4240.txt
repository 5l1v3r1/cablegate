Zuma Voted ANC President 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) Jacob Zuma was elected President of the African National 
Congress (ANC) at an ANC national conference on December 18th, 
ousting current ANC President Thabo Mbeki.  Zuma's win of 2,329 
votes against 1,505 votes for Mbeki leaves the party facing the need 
to restore unity amid unprecedented rivalry for the office.  Zuma, 
whose reputation has been shrouded in controversy following years of 
legal battles with charges of corruption and rape, will now govern 
the ANC party while Mbeki continues to serve as President of South 
Africa.  (Business Day, December 19, 2007)

Economy Holds Steady after Zuma Wins Election 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) According to the top three global rating agencies, Fitch, 
Moody's and Standard and Poor's, South Africa's fiscal and monetary 
policy framework will stay in place and its credit ratings have not 
been put at risk by Zuma's election as ANC president.  Standards 
noted that it does not expect a sharp or immediate change in 
policies.  Moody's said that Zuma's efforts to ease investor concern 
in recent months stood him in good stead.  Fitch and Moody's 
upgraded their outlook on South Africa to "positive" this year, 
while S&P maintained a "stable" outlook, taking a "wait and see 
approach" due to the uncertainty about the ANC succession and the 
possibility of continued political turmoil ahead of the 2009 
national presidential elections.  (Business Day, December 20, 2007) 
 
---------------------------- 
Coal Prices Sharply Increase 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Coal for shipment from Richard's Bay, site of the world's 
largest export terminal for the fuel, has been rising in price as 
Indian power companies replenish stockpiles.  The price has risen 84 
percent so far this year, and last week advanced 2.7 percent to 
reach $93.75 per ton, according to McCloskey data.  India will need 
500-million tons of coal in the year to March 2008, with an 
estimated domestic production of only 461 million, said PS 
Battacharyya, chairman of Coal India.  The Richard's Bay terminal is 
owned by South Africa's biggest coal exporters, including Anglo 
American, BHP Billiton and Xstrata.  More than 25 percent of the 
coal burned in Europe is shipped through Richard's Bay.  (Business 
Day, December 18, 2007) 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Eskom Receives Substantial Rate Increase 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) State power company Eskom has received permission to levy a 
14.2 percent electricity tariff hike for the 2008-2009 financial 
year from National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa).  This is below 
Qyear from National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa).  This is below 
the 18.7 percent increase that Eskom requested, but is still 
significantly higher than the 6.2 percent that Nersa had previously 
approved.  Nersa added that Eskom's application for a further 17 
percent tariff hike for the 2009-2010 financial year would be 
considered in September 2008 when the next round of three-year price 
increases is determined.  Nersa's public consultation paper on 
Eskom's proposed tariff increases also states that electricity 
tariffs would increase by double digits from now until 2019. 
Municipal tariff increases would also increase by an average of 12 
 
PRETORIA 00004240  002 OF 003 
 
 
percent from July 1 next year.  Eskom needs the tariff increases to 
both cover rising fuel costs and fund its R150 billion ($22.3 
billion) revised capital investment program over the next five 
years.  The program proposes to increase the country's power 
generating capacity from slightly less than 40GW to 80GW by 2025. 
Approximately 20GW of the 40GW increase is expected to come from a 
fleet of pressure water reactor (PWR) nuclear power plants. The 
tariff increases will place additional pressure on inflation, which 
is already under pressure from higher food, fuel and wage costs, 
growing capacity constraints brought about by the sustained growth 
of the economy and the government's large infrastructure program, 
and rising inflation expectations.  Business Unity SA said the 
2008-2009 increase would add 0.5 percent to CPIX (consumer inflation 
excluding mortgage costs) next year.  The tariff increases will also 
create another argument for the South African Reserve Bank's 
Monetary Policy Committee to raise the policy interest rate once 
again when it meets on January 31.  Finally, the announced intention 
to increase tariffs over the next 12 years will make South Africa a 
less attractive destination for foreign investment, especially 
energy-intensive users such as aluminum and steel plants, given that 
South Africa's relatively low tariffs had been a major attraction 
for foreign investors.  (Business Day, December 21, 2007) 
 
---------------------------------------- 
New MIDP Not To Be Released Until August 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶6. (U) The new Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP) will not 
be released for at least another seven months.  The existing MIDP 
expires in 2009 while the new program will run until 2010.  The 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) provided hints that the new 
MIDP will likely take the form of a production subsidy.  The 
specific level of support is to be determined through a cost-benefit 
analysis that will be announced once the details of the new MIDP are 
finalized by August.  Currently, the motor industry contributes 4 
percent to gross domestic product and employs about 39,000 people. 
DTI said that in light of the achievements of the MIDP, the 
government will maintain reasonable support of the industry.

-------------------------------------- 
SA Joins WTO Case on US Farm Subsidies 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) South Africa has joined a WTO case seeking to challenge U.S. 
agricultural subsidies.  As a major corn producer, South Africa has 
significant interest in the case, the first it has ever joined since 
the WTO was created.  A local trade lawyer said that the likelihood 
of the case going against the US was "quite good," given the success 
Brazil had litigating against the U.S. on cotton subsidies.  The 
original claim was filed by Canada and Brazil, but a number of 
countries, including South Africa, have joined as third parties. 
(Business Day, December 20, 2007) 
 
------------------------------------ 
SA May Terminate Anti-Dumping Duties 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. (U) South Africa's International Trade Administration Commission 
(ITAC) has recommended the termination of anti-dumping duties on 
Q(ITAC) has recommended the termination of anti-dumping duties on 
several products, including several from the U.S. (Lysine, 
Acetaminophenol, suspension PVC, and chicken meat portions).  ITAC's 
recommendation is based on a recent South Africa Supreme Court of 
Appeal decision, which ruled that sunset reviews needed to be 
initiated five years from the date the duties retroactively went 
into effect, not the date the notice of duties was issued.  The 
court found that several ITAC sunset reviews were initiated after 
the five-year newly established deadline.  ITAC's proposal to 
terminate the duties is open to industry comments prior to ITAC's 
issuance of a final recommendation.  (ITAC Notice No. 1773 of 
Government Gazette No. 30602) 
 
--------------------------------- 
Inflation to Peak Above 8 Percent 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) CPIX inflation (CPI minus mortgage interest) rose to an 
annualized rate of 7.9 percent in November, well above the South 
African Reserve Bank's 3 percent-6 percent target range.  Many 
 
PRETORIA 00004240  003 OF 003 
 
 
analysts expect CPIX to peak above 8 percent early next year. 
(Business Day, December 19, 2007) 
 
---------------------------------- 
Retail Sales Slow To Five-Year Low 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) Retail sales slowed to a five-year low with an annual growth 
rate of 1.5 percent in October, providing evidence that South 
African Reserve Bank (SARB) interest rate hikes are hitting 
consumers.  The drop in retail sales will off-set some of the 
pressure to hike the policy interest rate when the SARB's Monetary 
Policy Committee meets on January 31.  (Business Day, December 20,
