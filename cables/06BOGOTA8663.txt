SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Vice Foreign Minister Camilo Reyes told us September 
15 President Uribe has instructed the MFA to handle Ecuador 
with "kid gloves" leading up to Ecuador's presidential 
election on October 15.  Security, emigration, GOC spraying 
of illegal coca on the border, and a surge in Colombian 
exports stemming from dollarization of the Ecuadorian economy 
are key bilateral issues.  Reyes said bilateral ties would 
remain manageable if either Leon Roldos or Cynthia Viteria 
win the presidential election.  In contrast, "all bets are 
off" if pro-Venezuelan and populist Rafael Correa is elected. 
 End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
COLOMBIA HANDLES "INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP" WITH KID GLOVES 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Reyes described Ecuador and Colombia as having an 
"intimate relationship", with Colombians strongly represented 
among Ecuador's business, political and professional elites. 
Still, Ecuador's internal political instability complicates 
bilateral relations, with Ecuadorian politicians routinely 
using Colombian issues to attack the GOE.  Reyes said the GOC 
tries to manage relations through patience and dialogue. 
President Uribe cares deeply about Ecuador, and has 
instructed the MFA to handle relations with "kid gloves," 
especially before Ecuador's presidential elections on October 
¶15.   If presidential candidates Leon Roldos or Cynthia 
Viteri win the election, Reyes predicted bilateral ties would 
remain manageable.  However, if pro-Venezuela and populist 
candidate Rafael Correa wins, "all bets are off." 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SECURITY TAKES THE LEAD ON BILATERAL RELATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3.  (C)  Reyes said there are four key issues influencing 
bilateral relations: security (the FARC's use of Ecuadorian 
soil for arms/narcotrafficking, safe haven, and logistics); 
emigration (Ecuador estimates 500,000 Colombians live in the 
country, while Colombia puts the figure at 150,000); coca 
spraying on the Colombian/Ecuadorian border; and 
dollarization (the overvalued Ecuadorian currency spurs 
imports, both legal and illegal, from Colombia, wiping out 
entire sectors of Ecuadorian industry.)  Venezuela's "growing 
presence" in Ecuador is an additional complication. Reyes 
said the focal issue is security, with Ecuadorians routinely 
blaming Colombia's inability to control its borders for all 
of their problems. 
 
------------------------- 
GOC CLAIMS GOOD RELATIONS 
------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  Despite the complex relationship, Reyes said 
government-to-government relations are good.  The GOC was 
able to obtain FARC official Simon Trinidad from Ecuador, and 
has also managed to limit the political fallout from the 
occasional military incident along the border. 
Communications with current FM Carrion are much better than 
they were with his predecessors.  Military-to-military links 
are also good, but corruption within the Ecuadorian military 
is a serious problem.  (Comment: DAO reports Colombian 
cooperation with the Ecuadorian police is better than with 
the Ecuadorian military, although military cooperation has 
improved in Putumayo over the last month.  End Comment) 
Colombia regularly finds Ecuadorian-marked arms and 
ammunition in FARC camps.  Reyes said Ecuadorian Minister of 
Defense Jarrin's recent resignation was indirectly triggered 
by a corruption scandal involving the military.  President 
Palacios fired Ecuador's three service commanders for their 
alleged involvement in a failed, illegal bank without first 
consulting with Jarrin.  Reyes claimed Jarrin had been 
looking for a way out ever since. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
GOC LOOKS TO U.S. FOR ECUADORIAN INTEL 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  In a separate meeting, Administrative Department for 
Security (DAS) Director Andres Penate told us the DAS has 
poor institutional ties with its Ecuadorian counterparts. 
Colombian intelligence regarding Ecuador comes from either 
U.S. channels or personal ties with individuals.  He 
contrasted this poor relationship with the good cooperation 
that the DAS receives from its institutional counterparts in 
Panama, Aruba, and Brazil.
