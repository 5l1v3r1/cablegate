¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  On September 11-12, Honduran-based Joint 
Task Force-Bravo (JTF-B) and Costa Rican medical personnel 
conducted a Medical Readiness Training Exercise (MEDRETE) in 
Costa Rica's remote, mountainous Turrialba region.  Nearly 
400 people received much-needed medical treatment.  Three 
members of the national legislature, who were from the 
province where the MEDRETE took place, also participated. 
While visiting the MEDRETE site, the Charge d'Affaires was 
interviewed by national print and television media, which 
focused on the positive contributions of the U.S. to this 
joint humanitarian mission.  Local leaders and patients 
deeply appreciated the assistance.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
AN "INVASION OF LOVE" 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) From September 11-12, over 50 JTF-B and Costa Rican 
medical and support personnel treated nearly 400 Costa Rican 
indigenous people in the Turrialba region, approximately 35 
miles east of San Jose. At the first of the two sites, 
Tolokicha, 241 patients were evaluated and treated for 
various maladies.  At Xichiari, the second site, 153 patients 
were treated.  The most common illnesses found included acute 
upper and lower respiratory infections, ectoparasitic 
infections (scabies), skin infections, some malnutrition in 
children, intestinal parasitism, and diarrheal infections. 
In addition, the H1N1 virus was detected in two patients and 
another five had suspect symptoms. 
 
¶3. (U) In addition to general medical evaluations, dentists 
also provided oral exams and performed some basic dental work 
such as extractions.  Also, each person evaluated received a 
preventative medical and hygiene packet that included items 
such as soap, insect repellent, and vitamins. 
 
¶4. (U) Most of the patients do not speak Spanish, but rather 
Cabeca, a local indigenous dialect.  Five Embassy translators 
and GOCR translators assisted English-only speaking U.S. 
military medical personnel.  No translation was needed though 
to express thanks, as evidenced from the smiles and gestures 
of grateful recipients of the assistance.  Additionally, in a 
letter to the editor in Costa Rica's most respected daily 
newspaper, La Nacion, the writer thanked the CDA, Embassy, 
and SOUTHCOM for the "great medical and psychological 
assistance" provided to these patients.  The writer continued 
and said that: 
 
     "Costa Rica, a country of peace, was the scene of a 
military invasion, in this case from the U.S., an invasion of 
love, solace, and humanitarian assistance to our ethnic 
peoples who need it so desperately." 
 
------------------------------ 
HELICOPTERS ATTRACTED PATIENTS 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Both MEDRETE sites were not easily accessible.  The 
only way to get timely medical treatment to the people in 
these areas is by air; the only other way to get to the 
remote communities is by horseback or by foot, which takes at 
least one day.  Because of a bridge that was washed out by 
floods last year, the mountainous locations have become even 
more isolated due to difficulties to get large amounts of 
supplies in.  In addition to the general isolation of the 
area, the 3000 inhabitants in "nearby" villages often had to 
walk many hours to get to the centrally located MEDRETE 
sites.  For example, one family of seven (with an eighth on 
the way) walked for over 90 minutes to seek medical 
assistance for the first time ever. 
 
¶6. (U) Helicopters are the only efficient and effective way 
to travel.  The presence of large and relatively noisy 
helicopters, such as JTF-B's UH-60 Blackhawks, also attracted 
dozens of patients who figured out (and word spread fast) 
that medical personnel were on the way.  One 50-year old 
patient, Rafael Martinez, said that he had simply heard the 
helicopters and walked a couple of hours to see a doctor.  He 
added that it had been two years since he had last seen one.

MEDRETES HIGHLIGHT U.S.-COSTA RICAN COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7. (U) As reported in Refs, MEDRETEs are great examples of 
 
bilateral cooperation.  Post's Office of Defense 
Representative (ODR) coordinated with many GOCR agencies to 
make this MEDRETE happen, but most importantly with the 
GOCR's Caja Social (similar to U.S. Social Security 
Administration, but additionally administers all of the 
public hospitals in Costa Rica), the Ministry of Health, and 
the Ministry of Public Security. 
 
-------------------------- 
LEGISLATORS DO "VIP" VISIT 
-------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) Led by CDA Brennan, Post coordinated a VIP visit to 
the area with three Costa Rican legislators.  The legislators 
all hailed from Cartago province, where the MEDRETE sites 
were located.  They represented three political parties (the 
National Liberation Party-PLN, the Citizen Action Party-PAC, 
and the Libertarian Movement-ML) and deeply appreciated the 
assistance that the USG brought to their constituents. 
 
------------------------------------- 
POSITIVE AND SUSTAINED MEDIA COVERAGE 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) Thanks to the coordination of Post's Public Affairs 
section, positive coverage of the MEDRETE continued in 
various media outlets for nearly two weeks after the 
conclusion of the event.  Four print/internet media and two 
TV stations sent reporters, with transportation provided by 
JTF-B helicopters, to the remote sites and conducted numerous 
interviews, including Spanish language interviews of CDA 
Brennan and ODR personnel. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) The positive contribution to overall bilateral 
relations between Costa Rica and the U.S. due to MEDRETEs is 
hard to overstate.  Post has supported a sustained tempo of 
2-4 MEDRETEs per year over the past two years that has opened 
many doors and made believers out of doubters on the use of 
U.S. military personnel in the region.  With a near 
withdrawal of all participation of any Costa Rican police 
officials in U.S. military training facilities via the IMET 
program two years ago (at places such as Fort Benning, 
Georgia where WHINSEC is located), to U.S. military medical 
personnel and aircraft flying in Costa Rican airspace, the 
transformation of attitudes has changed greatly.  Our 
"invasions of love" have generated a lot of goodwill. 
 
¶11. (U) Post sends a special thank you to the men and women 
of JTF-B who made it all happen.  Their medical 
professionalism and ambassadorship benefited both patients 
and USG goals in the region.  Kudos for a job well done!
