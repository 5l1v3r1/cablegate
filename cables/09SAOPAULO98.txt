SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASIFIED--PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The State of Sao Paulo is making improvements to 
its once-notorious juvenile detention system (Fundacao CASA, 
formerly known as FEBEM), in part thanks to USG support.  The 
improvements became clear during a February 3, 2009 visit to two 
such facilities by International Narcotics and Law Enforcement 
Affairs (INL) reps and Poloff.  INL funds pilot substance abuse 
treatment initiatives at these facilities to increase prospects for 
rehabilitation from drug abuse, reduce  relapse/recidivism rates 
post treatment, and improve overall psycho-social living conditions. 
 While much work still needs to be done, the two facilities visited 
are noteworthy examples of the progress that can be made given 
resources and commitment.  End Summary. 
 
CASA FOUNDATION ADDRESSES CRITICISM

¶2.  (U) Sao Paulo State's Center for the Socio-Educational Care of 
the Adolescent (CASA) Foundation (formerly known by the acronym 
FEBEM) manages Brazil's juvenile detention system.  After complaints 
of serious overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and allegations of 
torture, CASA reorganized in 2006 and is trying to clean up its act 
and its image.  The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement Affairs' (INL) Office of Anticrime Programs funds two 
pilot programs at CASA facilities to reduce drug use and related 
violence among juvenile detainees, improve psycho-social living 
conditions, and add a rehabilitation component to CASA's primary 
focus on incarceration (Reftels A and B). 
 
¶3.  (U) Poloff accompanied representatives from INL as they visited 
the two new facilities where they are implementing a pilot 
therapeutic drug counseling program.  The first location in Aruja 
houses only male offenders between the ages of 12 and 20. 
(Administrators stated that most residents were between 14 and 16 
years of age and Poloff did not observe any residents that seemed 
significantly older or younger).  In contrast to the conditions 
described by visitors to other facilities, the Aruja facility is 
modern, clean, and colorful.  The facility holds a maximum of 56 
inmates and distinguishes between adolescents detained on a 
provisional basis, i.e. those awaiting sentencing and those already 
convicted.  Up to 16 "provisional" detainees are housed separately 
from the general population.  The provisional detainees attend a 
program focused on good citizenship, respect for self and others, 
and goal setting. 
 
¶4.  (U) Forty boys are held on a more permanent basis.  These 
adolescents have already been convicted and, on average, stay at the 
facility for one year (three years maximum).  The Aruja facility has 
seven teachers from the local school system that come to teach 
primary and secondary education classes.  In addition, the boys are 
expected to complete coursework in self-esteem, planning, 
decision-making, values and ethics.  There are two full time 
psychologists on staff and all of the boys are expected to attend 
weekly counseling sessions.  INL has sub-contracted Daytop 
International, an organization that specializes in therapeutic 
communities and counseling, to help CASA develop a program focused 
on rehabilitation and integration into society rather than 
punishment. 
 
¶5.  (U) Mr. Dorival Cardoso Lima, Administrator of the Aruja 
facility, explained that CASA is moving to address past problems. 
The Aruja facility is one of the newer, smaller facilities run as a 
partnership between a local NGO and the CASA Foundation.  Rather 
than build large-scale facilities far from a detainee's family that 
are run predominantly by the State, CASA now builds smaller 
facilities closer to the local communities and has a local NGO run 
the administrative and counseling aspects of the program.  [Note: 
These newer facilities are the result of previous recommendations by 
INL to the former FEBEM system to reduce overcrowding and violence, 
in addition to addressing the drug addiction problems of juvenile

detainees.  End Note.]  CASA provides the physical facility and 
security while the NGO staff (in this case trained by Daytop) 
handles the daily interaction with the detainees.  This model allows 
the detainees to maintain ties with their families and reduces the 
alienating "factory" aspects of the large-scale detention centers. 
 
¶6.  (U) CASA also opened a new facility for adolescent girls in 
Guarulhos in November 2008.  Daytop is providing the training for 
this facility as well.  When Poloff visited, the Guarulhos facility 
only housed 12 girls, but like the Aruja facility for boys, it will 
hold up to 56 adolescent girls when it reaches full capacity. 
 
CLEAR IMPROVEMENT BUT MANY MILES TO GO

¶7.  (SBU) Comment:  The Aruja and Guarulhos facilities demonstrate 
the State of Sao Paulo's commitment to improved conditions for 
juvenile detention.  INL arranged this visit to monitor the 
implementation of Daytop's programs within the CASA facilities, but 
also brought local researchers who will conduct a short-term outcome 
evaluation (feasibility study) that includes interviews of facility 
administrators, workers and detainees and post-release follow-up to 
gain a better perspective on program implementation fidelity and the 
pilot projects' impact on drug abuse and related crime/violence 
rates. Based on the outcome evaluation results, INL will encourage 
CASA to rapidly expand the project from two pilot facilities to a 
program that is state-wide.  End Comment. 
¶8.  (U) This cable was cleared with INL.
