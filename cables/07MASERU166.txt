¶1.  (U) Ambassador June Carter Perry made a March 16 live 
statement condemning the situation in Zimbabwe for Lesotho's 
nationwide television network and for the Lesotho National and 
Regional Press Services which distributes to national radio 
outlets.  Emphasizing the inhumane treatment of opposition 
leaders, the Ambassador, expressed our deep concern over the 
deteriorating situation, the Mugabe regime's gross violation of 
human rights and its undermining of the democratic process. She 
called for Lesotho as Chair of SADC to come forward with its own 
statement and to urge other SADC member states to do the same. 
This message reached audiences across the country. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In private conversations March 14 and 15 with 
Lesotho's Prime Minister Mosisili (and his senior Ministers) and 
on March 18 with SADC Executive Secretary Salomao, Ambassador 
Perry pressed the same points and the need for national and 
regional actions to address Zimbabwe.  There was no disagreement 
with the points, but we await confirmation of actions to be 
taken, either privately or through the March 21-23 SADC 
Ministerial Council planned to take place in Maseru.
