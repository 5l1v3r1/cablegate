MOHAMED NABIL - CASE NO. K-2275 
 
REF: STATE 99495 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Pol Off met with 
registered broker Mohamed Nabil. He confirmed that he was 
authorized by the Egyptian Ministry of Defense to conduct 
brokering activities in Egypt.  Nabil operates out of a 
one-man office without any partners or employees.  He 
provides consulting services only for sensitive items, so he 
does not physically handle or store any items on the United 
States Munitions List on behalf of his clients.  He started 
his consulting business 10 years ago when he retired from the 
Egyptian Navy, where he was last the Chief of the Electronic 
Warfare Department.  His only customer is the Egyptian Navy. 
Nabil confirmed that he was familiar with restrictions on 
USML items, including the unauthorized re-transfer and 
re-export of items. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Nabil said he was asked to register as a licensed 
broker by the American company ITT, who he represents in 
Egypt to promote naval products, including sonar equipment, 
electronic warfare systems, and command and control 
equipment.  He said his only business is to promote ITT 
products and he does not have a relationship with any other 
equipment provider, American or otherwise.
