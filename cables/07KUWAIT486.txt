SUBJECT: TOP KUWAITI JOURNALIST CLAIMS "US TO ATTACK IRAN 
BY END APRIL" 
 
REF: KUWAIT 50 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In an April 4 editorial, one of Kuwait's leading 
journalists claimed inside information that the U.S. was 
planning to attack Iran's nuclear facilities by the end of 
April.  Quoting unnamed sources in Washington, Ahmed 
Al-Jarallah, the Editor-in-Chief of the Arab Times (English 
daily) and Al-Seyassah (Arabic daily), said "various White 
House departments have already started preparing the 
political speech, which will be delivered by the President of 
the United States later this month, announcing the military 
attack on Iran."  According to Al-Jarallah, Iran's support of 
militias involved in killings of American soldiers in Iraq 
and Iranian actions in "Somalia, the Horn of Africa, 
Afghanistan, Yemen, and Lebanon" would be among the 
justifications for the attack outlined in the speech. 
Al-Jarallah claimed the strike would be limited to Iran's 
nuclear facilities and would not be accompanied by a 
corresponding U.S. ground attack.  Citing Russian news 
reports, Al-Jarallah noted comments by Russian officials on 
the difficulty of a military strike against Iran and the 
potential negative political ramifications.  He also reported 
that "Russian media late last month quoted unnamed sources in 
Russian military intelligence as saying the United States 
could launch a strike against Iran as early as April." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Al-Jarallah wrote an almost identical 
article in January, in which he asserted that the U.S. would 
attack Iran "before April" (reftel).  Most of the more 
sophisticated Al-Seyassah readers dismissed that article as 
"sensational," and are unlikely to take this latest one any 
more seriously.  Unfortunately, such provocative articles 
feed into the growing sense in Kuwait that a U.S. attack on 
Iran is imminent.  End comment.
