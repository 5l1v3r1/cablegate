¶1.  Very little has changed this week in the spread of AI 
throughout Poland.  Two additional outbreaks have been 
detected.  One is in Bydgoszcz, where five swans been 
confirmed for H5N1.  This brings the total number of 
outbreaks for Bydgoszcz to three.  The other new outbreak 
site is at Lake Rzadz, near the city of Grudziadz (in the 
same province as Bydgoszcz), where H5N1 has been confirmed in 
a swan.  Veterinary inspectors also confirmed H5N1 in a hawk 
found at the Kostrzyn site. 
 
¶2.  GOP Veterinary Service officials warned post's FAS office 
that Poland is entering a dangerous phase in the potential 
spread of AI.  Migratory birds will continue to return to 
Poland until the end of May, and then will begin nesting. 
The subsequent congregating birds could facilitate the spread 
of AI. 
 
¶3.  Deputy Econ Chief recently traveled to Torun, the 
original AI outbreak site in Poland, and observed first hand 
the GOP's contingency plans in action.  The GOP is still 
enforcing a perimeter around the site and has employed 
decontamination mats to prevent the dissemination of AI. 
Post FAS and Econoffs continue to maintain regular contact 
with counterparts in the Ministries of Agriculture and 
Health.
