------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
President Bush's September 25 meeting with Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas at the White House leads coverage in Al-Quds and 
Al-Ayyam, with all three papers running prominent front-page 
pictures showing the two leaders shaking hands.  The reports quote 
Bush and Abbas reiterating their commitment to continue peace 
negotiations until the goal of a two-state solution is realized. 
Al-Quds highlights remarks by President Bush stating that the U.S. 
will continue to assist Palestinians improve security and economic 
conditions.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida spotlights comments by Abbas stating 
that negotiations are difficult but that the Palestinians will 
"press on", until the conflict is resolved.  Al-Ayyam notes that 
this is the first time that Bush has acknowledged that the 
Palestinian state may not be established during his term, adding 
that the President "expressed sadness" over that eventuality.  In 
related news, Al-Quds reports that PA President Abbas will meet with 
Secretary Rice and Israeli President Peres before heading back home 
on September 28. 
 
President Bush's September 25 meeting with Lebanese President 
Sulayman in Washington also receives front-page coverage in Al-Ayyam 
and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, quoting Sulayman telling Bush that the 
"future of Palestinian refugees is in their homeland, not Lebanon." 
 
The September 26 UN Security Council session at which a discussion 
on Israeli settlements is expected, receives highlighted coverage in 
all dailies.  Leading with the story, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports 
that Arab efforts to convene the session have been "held up" by the 
U.S. for weeks. 
 
Al-Quds quotes Al-Tayyib Abdul Rahim, Secretary General of the 
Palestinian Authority Presidency, stating that the Palestinian 
leadership is committed to establishing a Palestinian state along 
the 1967 borders.  Abdul Rahim is also reported as praising the U.S. 
for working tirelessly towards that goal, while Israel has failed to 
fulfill its commitments, especially those related to the 
implementation of the Roadmap. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Quds report that Israel has agreed to 
release 450 Palestinian prisoners as part of an exchange deal to 
free Israeli soldier Shalit who is being held in Gaza.  The report 
states that Hamas has rejected the Israeli offer. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlights a front-page report quoting President 
Bush "conceding that the U.S. is in the midst of a dangerous 
financial crisis."  In related coverage, Al-Ayyam reports that the 
U.S. Congress has agreed on the principles for a US Government 
financial bailout and that presidential candidates McCain and Obama 
are participating in discussions on the issue at the White House. 
 
Wafa official news agency and all three dailies run on inside pages, 
the Consulate press release about the recent visit of a U.S. band, 
The Fuuls, who performed concerts and conducted workshops throughout 
the West Bank and Gaza as part of the Consulate's Ramadan 
programming.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  In its main editorial, Al-Quds independent opines under the 
title "Ideas Alone are not Enough" (09/26):  "History will judge the 
presidency of George W. Bush... It was a period full of overseas 
wars and emergency laws to monitor terrorist suspects and a 
 
JERUSALEM 00001802  002 OF 002 
 
 
recession that threatens to deepen further ... In any case, the 
legacy of Bush is not something that Americans will fondly and 
admiringly remember.  For the Palestinian people, this legacy has 
one spot of light amid the darkness... of the peace process...  He 
articulated his special vision that has materialized into the 
Roadmap's plan to establish a Palestinian state beside Israel. 
Despite the passing of five full years, the occupation and reality 
of settlements has become worse instead of better for 
Palestinians...  In this context, reports are coming from Washington 
about ideas formulated by the Bush administration to 'bridge the gap 
between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,' with a special emphasis 
on security arrangements that Israel is demanding be in... any final 
agreement.  These reports, by implying that security arrangements 
are the obstacle to the agreement, are meant to divert attention 
away from the real obstacles which have turned Palestinian life into 
a living hell.  [These obstacles are] random, extensive settlement 
[expansion] which has swallowed up substantial Palestinian areas and 
deprived the people of their natural right to freedom and 
sovereignty... The [US-proposed] ideas are not the right means to 
achieve a comprehensive peace... [we need instead increased] 
American pressure on Israel to completely withdraw from the lands 
occupied in 1967..." 
 
 
¶2.  Yahya Rabah argues in official Al-Hayat Al-Jadida under the 
headline "The dialogue between Hope and Desperation" (09/26): "The 
prevailing problem these days is that all these efforts exerted by 
our Egyptian brothers for the sake of [internal Palestinian] 
dialogue, the ongoing arrangements and all those Egyptian and Arab 
calls to work hard towards this dialogue are met with very different 
and even contradictory reactions from the Palestinians; just as 
desperation contradicts hope.  This is evident in the hopeful, 
positive and optimistic statements of Dr. Sha'ath, head of the Fatah 
delegation to the Cairo dialogue, as opposed to some of Haniyyah's 
statements that do not reflect the same optimism, but rather speak 
of a road ahead that is filled with pitfalls... These black 
statements about the dialogue and about January 9 [disputed end date 
for Abbas' presidency] cast black shadows over the Palestinians' 
expectations and their feelings... Are we going to succeed in 
managing our dispute or will we fall victim to a total death?"
