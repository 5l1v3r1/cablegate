¶1.  (U) On August 20, Emboffs traveled to the South Kordofan village 
of Lagawa, to attend a ceremony sponsored by the UN Demobilization, 
Disarmament and Re-integration (DDR) Unit, celebrating the final 
performance of the Lagawa "Hakamat" and the distribution of goats to 
its members. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Hakamat are traditional women singers of the Arab tribes 
of Darfur and Kordofan.  In peacetime, the Hakamat sing the praises 
of local leaders and notables, in return for a gratuity.  (If a 
reward is not forthcoming, they instead deride their subjects in 
scathing terms.)  In wartime, Hakamat publicly chant demands that 
village men go into battle, demeaning the manhood of any who show 
reluctance.  Tribal leaders told poloff that no man could ignore the 
Hakama call to battle as "their manhood and marriage prospects were 
at stake."  Hakama women have performed this role both in Sudan's 
civil war and in Darfur. 
 
¶3.  (U) Following the signing of the CPA, UN DDR started a program 
seeking to change the Hakama cultural practice of inciting war.  "It 
had to be subtle but persuasive," said UN DDR Program Manager Basil 
Massey.  Taking advantage of the fact that in the years after the 
civil war, the surrounding areas remained dangerous for anyone to 
travel far from their home village, UN DDR arranged for UN 
peacekeepers to convoy 30 women to a workshop explaining the CPA. 
"The workshop on the CPA was far less important than the joyous 
reunion of the women that ensued", said Massey. 
 
¶4.  (U) Yet despite an initial positive response to the workshop, 
village leaders, local government officials, and other Hakama women 
remained reluctant to further endorse UNDP's DDR programs. 
Undaunted, the UN continued to offer economic-support programs to 
villagers, while Kadugli-based UN peacekeepers patrolled 
aggressively.  Now, all villagers in the Lagawa area are able to 
travel freely, even at night, said Egyptian UN 
peacekeeping-battalion commander Colonel Sayed Abd el-Hady.  Yet 
without a political commitment at the national level, local support 
remained tenuous, said Massey. 
 
¶5.  (U) That commitment came, according to Massey, with the arrival 
of Ameera Haq as Deputy UNSRSG.  He said that Haq made it a point to 
listen to (while not necessarily agreeing with) Bashir-government 
officials.  For example, Massey said that when GOS officials 
objected to UN Human Rights reports and references to GOS military 
intelligence practices, Haq defended the reporting saying that 
"human rights reporting is what the UN does, and we are going to 
continue to do it," but added that she would refer to military 
intelligence activities as coming from "government security forces." 
 Massey claimed that for the first time the GOS officials began to 
feel they were being listened to and not ignored. With support at 
national level, any local hesitancy to support UNDP's DDR programs 
"vanished," claimed Massey. 
 
¶6.  (U) On August 20, UNDP ceremonially presented a herd of goats to 
each Zaghawa Hakama woman for publicly renouncing their traditional 
chanting for war, while publicly announcing their commitment to 
peace.  Amidst the Hakama women chanting "Yes to peace, no to war," 
while stomping the ground and shouting, Massey highlighted that 
while the distribution of the goats served to increase the Hakamat 
financial stake in overall peace, the public ceremony also 
underscored their public commitment and reputation in support of 
peace and not war. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment:  While UNDP's Hakama women's program is small and 
affects only the villages in the immediate area, it represents a 
successful use of economic, military and diplomatic efforts to 
change attitudes away from war towards peace.  Massey said that he 
employed this integrative model successfully in Afghanistan, where 
he enticed different warring tribes to meet and socialize over 
several days, promoted mutual economic interaction and shared 
economic stakes, coordinated with the military to provide security, 
and sought higher level political commitment.  For DDR in Sudan to 
be successful, UN DDR will have to duplicate this model on a larger 
scale and in very remote locations.  While UN DDR has made it past 
some initial hurdles of acceptance by the regime and local 
communities, it now must move forward with its DDR plan, assuming 
that donors are able to fund the required USD 385 million, and that 
significant numbers of armed elements remain willing to disarm.
