Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds leads with news of the failure of internal Palestinian 
dialogue in Cairo, noting that Egypt accused Hamas of undermining 
the dialogue for "regional agendas."  Egypt also charged that Hamas 
has been using, "misleading positions and invalid pretexts," such as 
the issue of Hamas prisoners in Palestinian Authority (PA) 
detention, to mobilize public support for its boycott of talks.  The 
paper also quotes "Arab diplomats" stating that Iran sought to 
intervene in the dialogue, and statements from the PLO Executive 
Committee accusing Hamas of foiling dialogue. PA President Abbas is 
quoted pledging to exert all efforts necessary to achieve national 
unity, according to reporting. 
 
All dailies run front page photos of Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Abbas laying a cornerstone for a museum about the life of 
former PA President Arafat in Ramallah. In related news, the paper 
reports that Arafat's widow and daughter have expressed a 
willingness to return from their self-imposed exile in Tunisia to 
the West Bank. 
 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida lead with news of an Israeli 
incursion into Gaza on November 12 that killed four Palestinians. 
Al Ayyam's lead photo shows an Israeli tank leaving Gaza after the 
incursion, while Al Hayat Al Jadida's lead photo shows medics 
carrying one of the dead Palestinian's body.  In other Gaza news, 
all dailies note that Israeli Premier Olmert has formed a committee 
to tighten sanctions on Gaza and that the Israel Discount Bank has 
decided to stop money transfer to Gaza.  The papers also report that 
a Texas jury is deliberating on a judgment in the pending law suit 
against the charitable organization "Holy Land", accused of 
transferring $12 million to Hamas.  Finally, Al Quds' front page 
reports that Israel has prevented distribution of its newspaper for 
a seventh day in the Gaza Strip. 
 
Al Quds' front page reports that both president-elect Obama and 
Hamas deny that meetings were held before the U.S. presidential 
election between Obama's advisors and Hamas, as asserted recently by 
Hamas official Ahmad Yousef. 
Meanwhile, Al Ayyam's front page reports that URWA renewed its 
warning on November 12, that it will be forced to halt food aid 
distribution in Gaza if Israel does not reopen Gaza border 
crossings. 
 
All front pages report that Israeli Premier Olmert admitted on 
November 12 that Israel has intentionally discriminated against its 
Arab population since the establishment of the Israeli state.  He 
continued that he wanted Israeli Arabs to be better integrated into 
Israeli society, according to the reports. 
 
Al Quds publishes front page statements by the King of Jordan and 
Saudi King calling for the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict.  The statements were made at the Interfaith Conference at 
the U.N. in New York on November 12.  In related news, Al Hayat Al 
Jadida runs front page statements by former Israeli Premier 
Netanyahu calling for support to the Palestinian economy.  The paper 
also announces that Israeli Premier Olmert revealed that his Foreign 
Minister Livni has reached agreement with the Palestinians on the 
issue of Jerusalem. 
 
In settlement news, Al Ayyam's front page reports that newly elected 
Israeli Jerusalem Mayor Barakat has called for the building of new 
houses in Israeli settlements in and around Jerusalem.  The article 
 
JERUSALEM 00002029  002 OF 002 
 
 
also reports that Israel's High Court has ordered a halt to the 
construction of 35 Israeli settlement apartment units in Beit El 
near Ramallah.  In related reporting, Al Ayyam front pages a report 
that the Israeli military demolished two Palestinian houses near 
Ramallah on November 12.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1) Jawad Bashiti writes in Al Ayyam under the title, "The president 
they are creating out of Obama" (11/13):  "Rahm Emanuel was not 
selected by Obama, as we think, or as he himself thinks.  He did not 
come to Obama, but rather he was sent to Obama... We have nothing 
but a "moral lobby" that can pray for Obama that Allah gives him 
insight and shows him the correct path.  We forget the fact that the 
president there is not elected, and once he is elected, he is molded 
into [the desired form of leader]." 
 
2)  Azzam Abu Sud opines in Al Quds under the title, "Are we going 
bankrupt?" (11/13):  "The failure of the [Cairo Palestinian] 
dialogue conference causes us to pray for peace upon [former 
Palestinian Authority President] Arafat's soul.  He united us and 
after his death, we became dispersed.  This failure will, sooner or 
later, make us summon up the courage to publicly declare that we 
will be bankrupt, politically, socially, morally, culturally, 
economically and religiously, unless we act before it is too late."
