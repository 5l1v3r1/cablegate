stated on the license.  PM/DTCC also requests that post 
conducts a site visit to U&U in order to provide Department 
with an assessment of its business operations and on-site 
security.  Finally, post is asked to assess whether the 
company appears to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If 
a site visit is not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC 
officer.

accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items?

principals?
