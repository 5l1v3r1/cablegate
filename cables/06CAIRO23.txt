(SBU) Post has decided to discontinue the Ismailia Virtual 
Consulate, Embassy Cairo's trial Virtual Presence Post (VPP), 
which was launched in December 2003.  The VPP helped improve 
Embassy outreach to Ismailia, which received twelve visits 
from the Embassy after the launch of the VPP.  However, the 
small number of hits received by the site does not justify 
keeping it operational.  The Ismailia Governorate has started 
its own site which provides much of the information covered 
in the VPP; USG-specific information is available on the 
Embassy's own web site.
