SUBJECT: UPDATE ON FINNISH EU PRESIDENCY ACTIONS IN SUPPORT 
OF UNIFIL 
 
REF: HELSINKI 798 
 
Classified By: PolChief Gregory Thome, Reasons 1.4 (b and d). 
 
¶1. (C) MFA Unit for Security Policy Director Kimmo Lahdevirta 
offered an update on the Finnish Presidency's recent efforts 
to urge EU member states to make troop contributions to 
UNIFIL. 
 
¶2. (C) While signals out of Paris continue to be mixed, it 
now appears clear that the French intend to contribute only 
400 troops to UNIFIL (i.e., 200 additional troops to 
supplement the 200 already on the ground), Lahdevirta said; 
France will also put its 1700 Marines in the region "on 
standby" for deployment to Lebanon, but only if necessary. 
The Finnish Presidency is disappointed with this response and 
has urged France to reconsider.  As previewed reftel, Finnish 
FM Erkki Tuomioja telephoned French FM Philippe Douste-Blazy 
Aug. 18 to press France to lead the mission and to increase 
its troop strength, but apparently to no avail.  Douste-Blazy 
was non-committal in his conversation with Tuomioja, 
Lahdevirta reported, suggesting only that the disappointing 
French response stemmed in part from France's strained 
relationships with Syria and with pro-Syria factions in 
Lebanon.  Oddly, he added, Douste-Blazy hinted that Paris 
still might make a better showing if a second UNSC resolution 
is adopted, although in the short to medium term this does 
not appear likely.  Lahdevirta also surmised, as a personal 
aside, again oddly, that perhaps the French would have been 
more forthcoming if the mission were EU-hatted as opposed to 
UN-hatted.) 
 
¶3. (C) Meanwhile, Finnish Presidency conversations with other 
member states have also yielded few firm commitments. 
Germany, with whom the GOF held talks last week, has not 
moved very far from its reticent stance, although the door 
remains open to many possible options, including police 
and/or maritime support, Lahdevirta said.  Finnish efforts to 
press for a combined Nordic force have fallen flat.  Denmark 
and Norway may make important contributions of naval assets, 
but they and Sweden in particular have expressed little 
interest in providing ground forces -- leaving Finland in 
search of other partners to whom it can attach what it 
expects to be a 200 to 260 man force.  Finland will chair an 
extraordinary PSC meeting Aug. 23 in Brussels where "the goal 
is to pressure those who have not committed forces to make 
commitments," Lahdevirta said.  With the French backpedaling, 
Lahdevirta welcomed the concept of a "three-pillar strategy" 
as a best second option.  He said that EU sources continue to 
indicate that Italy may take on a leadership role and that -- 
in conjunction with Turkey and a third partner -- could 
provide the necessary leadership and a significant framework 
troop contribution.  However, much will depend on what Italy 
offers at the COPS meeting Aug. 23. 
 
¶4. (C) Comment: Finland continues to make good faith efforts 
in showing leadership and urging other EU members to make 
robust contributions to UNIFIL -- including its own 
contribution of an "enhanced company," which for a country of 
this size is significant given the GOF's many other PKO 
commitments worldwide.  However, the current lack of a major 
commitment from a major EU power highlights the limited role 
a small country Presidency can play.  End Comment.
