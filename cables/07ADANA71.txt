POLITICAL: 
 
¶2.      BOLGE / EKSPRES:        The local daily Bolge reads as follows 
in big captions on its front page: "Durak has his eyes on 
President's Office."  The article further reads that (Adana 
Mayor) Durak advocated in a speech he made at a meeting of the 
Union of Cukurova Municipalities that, like in the government's 
proposal which said that the president should be elected 
directly by the people in a two-round election, the mayors 
should be elected in two rounds, as well, and the voters should 
be able to directly vote for the candidates, not for candidates 
that a board nominated.  Durak further proposes that the right 
to return to their posts should be secured by the constitution 
for public office holders who are to resign from their offices 
to run in the elections. 
 
¶3.      ZAMAN:  Land Forces Commander Ilker Basbug paid a 
visit to the Sirnak Governor Selahattin Apari.  Basbug told 
Apari that he had inspected some of the military units at the 
province. 
 
¶4.      GUNDEM: DTP's election strategy was unanimously 
decided as to field independent candidates as a result of the 
two-day meeting DTP held in Diyarbakir on May 8 and 9.  The 
other election strategy, namely forming alliances with other 
parties, was opted out.   DTP's candidates will run in a total 
of 40 cities and it aims to win 37 parliamentary seats in the 
July 22 election.  The daily reports that the legal concerns 
over whether former Kurdish deputies Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, 
Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak could run and whether they will be 
nominated as candidates will be discussed in a separate party 
assembly meeting. Two of the topics discussed during the 
meetings were the termination of the PKK's unilateral cease-fire 
on May 18 and the health condition of Abdullah Ocalan.  (This 
summary is from May 10 edition.) 
 
¶5.      EVRENSEL / GUNDEM / HURRIYET:   The dailies claim that, AKP, 
CHP, Motherland Party and DYP, who were in bitter strife during 
the presidential election process, have reportedly smoothly 
agreed to boycott DTP's election strategy to win seats through 
independent candidates.  DTP's Vice-Chairperson Osman Ozcelik, 
who said the recent amendment on the election law aimed to 
prevent Kurdish people's will to be represented in the 
parliament, commented that those efforts would prove vain. 
Ankara deputy from AKP, Ersonmez Yarbay, said that amendments to 
the election law should be made one year ahead of the election 
period, or, if it gets verified, it should be implemented a year 
later; otherwise it would harm the credibility of that law. 
 
¶6.      GUNDEM: The tension between Esat Canan, Hakkari deputy 
from CHP, and CHP party administration is reportedly signaling a 
rift between the two.  Canan said, "It has become more difficult
