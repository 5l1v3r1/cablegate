SUBJECT: GOP HAS NO RECORD OF DPRK FLAG OF CONVENIENCE SHIPS 
 
REF: STATE 63168 
 
Classified By: Econ Chief Timothy P. Lattimer - Reasons 1.5(b and d) 
 
¶1.  (S) Fernando Solorzano, Director of the Panamanian 
Maritime Authority's (AMP) Merchant Marine Office, advised 
Econ Chief on May 8 that, based on reftel information, the 
AMP has no record of any North Korean flagged ships 
associated with Panama.  He said that, as Panama does not 
maintain a merchant marine consulate in North Korea, the AMP 
is unlikely involved with any DPRK ship registrations.  As a 
general rule, Solorzano said the GOP restricts the ship 
registration pursuant to directives issued by the UN, as well 
as for fishing vessels pursuant to relevant sanctions imposed 
by other international organizations. 
 
¶2.  (S) Solorzano suggested that the AMP could do a more 
thorough records check if we provide him with more detailed 
information, such as clearer names and/or radio callsigns for 
the eleven ships in question.  Post stands ready to follow-up 
with the AMP should the Department provide any further 
details.
