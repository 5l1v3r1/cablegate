 Â¶1.  (SBU)  At 0845 hrs local on May 13, Ambassador Schlicher 
convened an Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meeting to 
review political developments in Lebanon and follow up on the 
May 12 EAC meeting (reftel).  Post submitted an updated 
staffing request to Washington on May 12.  Contingency 
planning for a Beirut Air Bridge (new name to be determined) 
continues.  Two members of the Embassy staff returned safely 
yesterday to Cyprus from Lebanon via boat.  The boat returned 
with no staff on board. Katherine Ingmanson from Embassy 
Sofia will arrive May 14 to provide TDY support.  Public 
Affairs continues to coordinate with EUCOM, and a EUCOM 
Public Affairs point of contact, Lt. Commander Barker, will 
arrive in Cyprus shortly.  The Ambassador noted that since 
two-thirds of the Embassy Nicosia's American staff (including 
100% of the front office) will be turning over this summer, 
Post will be short-staffed on direct hires and EFMs.
