¶1. Poloff delivered demarche points in reftel A, emphasizing 
that, while the USG fully supported full investigations of 
all allegations of human rights violations during the Gaza 
conflict, we could not support an unbalanced resolution that 
focused entirely on the actions of Israel.  Poloff stressed 
that we also did not want to take further action on Gaza or 
the Goldstone report within the Security Council. 
 
¶2.  Fernando Gonzalez, Assistant Director General for the UN 
Security Council at the Mexican Secretariat for Foreign 
Relations, told Poloff that the GOM had also felt unable to 
support such a resolution until they saw the text that the 
Arab Group and OIC had proposed on November 2.  The GOM felt 
that this language, unexpectedly, presented the Gaza issue in 
a relatively evenhanded way.  With this draft text and the 
changes proposed by the Europeans, the GOM will likely 
support the resolution.  For reference, a version of the 11/2 
draft text Gonzalez provided to Poloff is available in para 4 
below. 
 
Gonzalez noted several examples of equilibrium in the text: 
 
--As requested by the EU, the resolution condemns all 
targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure and 
intuitions, including UN facilities. 
 
--Paragraphs numbered 3 and 4 balance one another, one 
referencing actions that needed to be taken by the Israelis 
and one that needed to be taken by the Palestinians.  Poloff 
pointed out that the para on Israel did not make note of the 
GOI's investigations into alleged violations, related to its 
own actions during the Gaza conflict. 
 
¶3.  Gonzalez agreed that not all of the 11/2 OIC/Arab Group's 
language is ideal.  In paragraph 1, the European negotiators, 
with GOM support, have asked the Arab group to change the 
word "endorse" to "takes notes of."  Gonzalez raised the fact 
that the three-month time limit for investigations 
highlighted in paragraph 3 and 4 seemed too short, and the 
GOM would prefer closer to six months.  Poloff underscored 
that, as the conflict is ongoing, a time limit for domestic 
inquiries would be artificial.  Finally, Poloff suggested 
that the paragraph that begins "Gravely concerned by reports 
regarding serious human rights violations and grave breaches 
of international humanitarian law committed during the 
Israeli military operations..." would be difficult for the 
USG to accept due to its political nature.  Gonzalez took 
note of this comment but observed that the United States 
could become increasingly isolated on human rights issues in 
multilateral foras if we could not find a way to negotiate a 
version of this text.
