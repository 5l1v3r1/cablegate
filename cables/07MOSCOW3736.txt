¶1. (SBU) This message contains an action request.  See paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On July 27, EST Officers met Andrey Kruitskikh, Deputy 
Director of the Department for Security and Disarmament Affairs 
(DVBR) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at his request.  He 
delivered a Diplomatic Note regarding the Sea Launch Technology 
Safeguards Agreement (TSA) stating that GOR had taken all necessary 
government steps to bring the TSA into force.  Kruitskikh said the 
USG should deliver a final note acknowledging the date of delivery 
of the Russian note to bring the TSA into force. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kruitskikh also reported that the MFA is ready to move 
forward with the extension of the Agreement for Cooperation in the 
Exploration and Use of Space for Peaceful Purposes (the "Civil Space 
Agreement," Ref A) and the Agreement Concerning the Procedure for 
the Customs Documentation and Duty-Free Entry of Goods Transported 
within the Framework of U.S.-Russian Cooperation in the Exploration 
and Use of Space for Peaceful Purposes (the "Customs Agreement," Ref 
B).  He delivered two draft diplomatic notes that he said the GOR 
was prepared to formalize if the USG accepts proposed minor wording 
adjustments reflected in the notes. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Referring to the Baikonur Technology Safeguards Agreement 
(BTSA), Kruitskikh said that the GOR had completed its comparison of 
the Russian and Kazakh texts, and is prepared to finalize all legal 
matters.  He reported that the GOR hopes the USG will move to 
complete the process and suggested that the USG and the GOR approach 
the GOK to urge quick action to bring the BTSA into force. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Regarding the draft Framework Technology Safeguards 
Agreement (FTSA), he said he looks forward to reviewing USG 
revisions.  Already wearing a fishing jacket, Kruitskikh noted that 
he would be on vacation from August 20 until the end of September 
and expressed the hope that the two sides could meet in Moscow upon 
his return. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Copies of the diplomatic notes and Embassy's informal 
translation have been sent electronically to EUR/PRA and EUR/RUS. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Post requests instructions to respond to Kruitskikh's 
proposals on the draft diplomatic notes on the Civil Space Agreement 
and the Customs Agreement.
