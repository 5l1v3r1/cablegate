(C) Subsequent to the contacts described in ref A, the 
Ambassador spoke with President Toledo on the afternoon of 
7/26, and briefed the President on the USG's opposition to 
the G-4 framework resolution, per ref B talking points. 
Toledo did not say definitively how Peru would vote, and 
stressed that he had not yet taken a final position.  He 
commented that he had real concerns about supporting any 
resolution promoting a UNSC seat for Japan, given the current 
state of affairs between Japan and Peru over the extradition 
of former President Fujimori.  Toledo seemed to be leaning 
toward abstention if the resolution comes to a vote, and he 
even admitted the possibility of voting against, given the 
difficult situation with Japan.
