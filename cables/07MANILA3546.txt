SUBJECT: PHILIPPINES WILL CONTINUE ITS SUPPORT FOR UN 
RESOLUTION OPPOSING CUBA EMBARGO 
 
REF: SECSTATE 148506 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  Leah Ruiz, Director for the Department of Foreign 
Affairs' Office of United Nations and International 
Organizations, told poloff that the Philippine Mission to the 
United Nations will likely vote in favor of the annual 
resolution that calls for an end to the U.S. trade embargo 
against Cuba.  To her knowledge, the Philippine government 
has always voted in favor of the resolution.  Per reftel, 
poloff requested that the Philippine government consider 
abstaining from the vote, which they have also not done, or 
at least issue an explanation of their vote.  Ruiz paid 
careful attention to these options, but said she could not 
commit on behalf of the Philippine Mission to the United 
Nations.  She believes Philippine support for the resolution 
will continue to be strong, while support for the U.S. in all 
other UN matters will also remain strong.
