SUBJECT: DOMINICANS CONCERNED ABOUT ALBA 
 
REF: BRIDGETOWN 62 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  While the Government of the Commonwealth of 
Dominica (GOCD) defends its decision to join Hugo Chavez's 
Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), many sectors 
in Dominican society are concerned about the long-term 
consequences of this agreement.  The decision to halt 
progress on the oil refinery is the first sign that Prime 
Minister Roosevelt Skerrit seems to value domestic public 
opinion over Chavez's.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) Consistent in conversations PolOff had with students, 
members of the business sector, tourism investors, and other 
members of society is a concern of what ALBA is and what it 
means for Dominica.  Fears include ALBA negatively impacting 
foreign direct investment and income from tourism dollars. 
Others worry that the USG will tighten visa policy against 
Dominicans in retaliation of ALBA.  Some worry there is truth 
in Chavez's claims that ALBA is an anti-U.S. military 
alliance.  Generally, the populace mostly wants a statement 
from Skerrit explaining what ALBA is and why Dominica joined. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In private conversations, GOCD representatives 
explained to PolOff that ALBA is not a military alliance, but 
simply a trade and development strategy (reftel).  These same 
representatives claimed that Skerrit will release a statement 
any day now and include a copy of the signed agreement with 
the statement. 
 
¶4. (U) Those concerned with ALBA also tend to disagree with 
the ALBA-funded oil refinery that Chavez has promised 
Dominica.  They see the USD 80 million refinery as a glaring 
eyesore in Dominica's marketing as the Nature Isle of the 
Caribbean.  Even if the refinery could be made 
environmentally sound, various members of the investment and 
tourism communities protested that the existence of the 
refinery is against the spirit of the Nature Isle plan and 
will put off potential tourists and investors. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: Skerrit remains a charismatic and likeable 
politician.  However, ALBA has eroded his strong popularity 
among the populace.  Recent actions from the PM's office hint 
that he recognizes this.  Immediately following the January 
25 ALBA conference in Venezuela, Skerrit met with private 
sector representatives to explain ALBA and his reasons for 
joining.  On February 12, he announced that Dominica would 
put its ALBA-sponsored oil refinery on hold.  These actions 
support the idea that Skerrit is a pragmatist concerned with 
the economic growth of Dominica.  Although sizeable foreign 
assistance from Chavez speaks loudly, the concerns of his 
electorate, particularly within the private sector, may speak 
louder.
