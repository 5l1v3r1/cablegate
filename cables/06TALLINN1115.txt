DEPLOYMENT 
 
 
On December 19, the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu) voted 
to extend the mandate for the Estonian troop deployment 
in Iraq by 12 months (until December 31, 2007).  The 
bill authorized up to 40 troops to participate in the 
mission.  At the moment, Estonia has a total of 40 
military personnel serving in Iraq.  34 infantry troops 
(ESTPLA-14) are assigned to the U.S. 4th Infantry 
Division near Baghdad, 4 staff officers serve at the 
headquarters of the multinational brigade and two are 
participating in the NATO training mission.  The bill 
was passed with an overwhelming majority of 70 votes in 
favor.  Three MPs voted against the bill, two from 
the Social Democrats and one from the Center Party.
