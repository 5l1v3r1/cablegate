¶1. (U) On September 19, the Swedish government settled with 
Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian national, to pay around USD 500,000 
in damages--a large amount in Swedish courts--related to the 
circumstances of his deportation to Cairo.  The award was not 
directly related to his claims of torture by U.S. agents.  In 
December 2001, the Swedish Security Police, reportedly acting 
in cooperation with the U.S., expelled via U.S. aircraft 
Agiza and Muhammed Alzery/Mohammed al-Zari, suspected of 
having connections with terrorist organizations.  The Swedish 
government sought and received assurances from the Egyptians 
that Agiza and Alzery would not be tortured. 
 
¶2. (U) The settlement stated that Agiza's claims of torture 
by U.S. agents were credible and accused the Swedish Security 
Police of allowing "brutal treatment" of the Egyptian by U.S. 
agents.  An identical decision on Alzery's case was made on 
June 2 (reftel).  The government has instructed the Swedish 
Migration Board to review the men's request to overturn the 
denials of their asylum applications.  The Swedish Helsinki 
Committee, representing both men, believes a decision on 
asylum will be made this fall.  Both men are in Egypt, but 
only Agiza is incarcerated.
