SUBJECT: ANOTHER UNEVENTFUL CAMBODIAN DEPORTATION OF 
SCREENED-OUT MONTAGNARDS 
 
REF: A. PHNOM PENH 1303 
 
     ¶B. PHNOM PENH 104 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Early in the morning of November 30, 21 ethnic 
Montagnard Vietnamese citizens departed a UNHCR site in Phnom 
Penh by bus headed for the Cambodia-Vietnam border in the 
first forced repatriation since January 2007 (ref B).  The 21 
individuals being deported arrived in Cambodia prior to May 
1, the cutoff date for Montagnard arrivals to be considered 
for U.S. resettlement if UNHCR denied them refugee status. 
The UNHCR had denied the 21 individuals refugee status and 
they had subsequently been rejected for resettlement in the 
U.S. following DHS USCIS interviews.  The deportation was 
originally scheduled for October 18, but was postponed 
because 20 of the individuals still fell within a 90-day 
period to request a review of their rejection by DHS (ref A). 
 That 90-day period ended November 22. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The deportation went quietly and without incident. 
When the bus pulled out of the compound, adults on the bus 
were not smiling but they were waving, and children in the 
back of the bus were smiling and waving.  Cambodian police 
officers, an MFA official and an MOI official were also at 
the site, as well as a UNHCR representative and a reporter 
from The Cambodia Daily.  A Cambodian police official and an 
MFA official accompanied the Montagnards to the Vietnamese 
border, where they were to be turned over to Vietnamese 
authorities.
