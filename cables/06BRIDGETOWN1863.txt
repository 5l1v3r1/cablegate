through emails. 
 
¶3.  Entry/departure requirements:  Mission policy is that all USG 
travellers to the region be in possession of a valid passport. 
Visas are not required for short visits.  Visitors are granted up to 
28 days upon entry, which can be extended through the Barbados 
Immigration Department for up to six months.  Barbados has a 
departure tax of 25 Barbados Dollars (BDS) of 13 U.S. Dollars 
(USD). 
 
¶4.  The exchange rate is a constant BDS$2.00 to USD$1. U.S. 
currency, travelers' checks, and credit cards are routinely and 
widely accepted. 
 
¶5.  The following is general information pertaining to security and 
health considerations throughout the Eastern Caribbean: 
 
Security 
-------- 
In the Eastern Caribbean, foot travel outside of well-established 
tourist areas is not generally recommended, especially at night.  Be 
vigilant when using public telephones or ATM facilities near 
roadsides or quiet areas.  As in many U.S. metropolitan areas, 
wearing expensive jewelry, carrying expensive objects, or carrying 
large amounts of cash should be avoided.  Visitors should also 
safeguard valuables while at the beach.  While hotels are generally 
safe, many visitors have experienced loss of unattended items. 
Hotel burglaries are not uncommon and all valuables should be locked 
in room safes if possible. 
 
Health information 
------------------ 
Throughout the Eastern Caribbean, the most likely threat to a 
visitor's health is sunburn.  It takes several weeks to become 
accustomed to the heat and humidity.  Prolonged exposure to the sun, 
without protection, causes sunburn, and may ultimately result in 
sun-damaged skin or even skin cancer.  Sunscreens should be used for 
protection. In Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent, the major 
health threat is dengue fever, transmitted by the aedes aegypti 
mosquito.  Dengue cases are most often seen in the summer months. 
Persons should therefore protect themselves with insect repellent. 
There is also a growing number of HIV/AIDS cases reported.  The 
Eastern Caribbean enjoys clean and safe drinking water.  Only 
routine boosters for immunizations (i.e. tetanus, diphtheria, 
pertussis and oral polio vaccine) are required when traveling to 
this region.  Barbados has the best medical facilities of all the 
islands in the region and most of the medical specialties have 
practitioners here.
