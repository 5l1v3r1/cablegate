SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR DONATION FOR 
AFGHAN ELECTION COSTS

Post delivered demarche (ref A) April 12 to the New Zealand 
Agency for International Development (NZAID), requesting a 
donation to help cover the UN financial shortfalls for 
election costs in Afghanistan.  Suzanne Loughlin of NZAID 
reported May 5 that her government would be unable to provide 
additional funds to Afghanistan, since it already had 
disbursed its budget for the current fiscal year.  That 
included the final allocation of NZ $1 million (US $640,000) 
to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, of NZ $5 
million (US $3.2 million) pledged this year.  New Zealand 
also has pledged NZ $5 million a year over the next three 
years for Afghanistan assistance, beginning in July (ref B). 
Loughlin agreed that the Afghan government should be 
encouraged to include election funding in future budgets as a 
routine practice.
