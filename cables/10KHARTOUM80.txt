DETENTION CENTER 
 
¶1.  (SBU) A group of approximately 50 peaceful demonstrators 
gathered outside the Chancery in Khartoum on Monday, January 11, 
2010 calling for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention 
facility.  According to banners and speeches, the demonstration was 
organized by two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) - Civic Aid 
International Organization and the Guantanamo Justice Center.  The 
latter is a Sudanese NGO founded by returned detainee Sami al-Hajj. 
A large banner written in English and Arabic read, "Eight Years of 
Guantanamo.  Shut down Guantanamo Now."  The banner and fliers 
handed out to passers-by had the logos of both organizations 
prominently displayed.  The demonstrators also erected a public 
address system with loudspeakers directed towards the Embassy to 
broadcast several speeches.  In their remarks, the protestors 
claimed that January 11 marked the eight year anniversary of the 
first Guantanamo detainee being taken into custody.  They urged 
President Obama to close down Guantanamo immediately. 
 
 
 
¶2.   (SBU) According to Embassy records, all but three of the 
twelve Sudanese men detained at Guantanamo Bay have been released. 
One of the three, Mahmoud Idriss, is scheduled to be returned to 
Sudan in late January.  The other two, Mohammed al Nur and Ibrahim 
Al Qosi are still being held for possible prosecution.  Al Qosi's 
Office of Military Commissions (OMC) defense team is scheduled to 
return to Khartoum from January 15 to 22 to meet with the 
detainee's family and to interview several of the former detainees. 
RSO and RAO are coordinating closely with appropriate host 
government officials to ensure the safety of the OMC defense 
attorneys (JAG officers) during their visit here.  Interviews of 
former detainees will be conducted in a safe environment after the 
returnees have been thoroughly searched.
