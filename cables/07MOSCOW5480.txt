REF: A. (A) MOSCOW 5372 
 
     ¶B. (B) MOSCOW 5436 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The November 11 oil spill in the Kerch Straight 
(which runs between the Black and Azov Seas near Crimea) 
continues to affect large numbers of fish and wildlife and is 
now spreading into the Sea of Azov (refs A, B).  Efforts to 
contain and remediate the spill have been limited by high 
seas and reported GOR disagreements with Ukraine over 
construction of a temporary dam between mainland Russia and 
the Ukrainian island of Tuzla (ref B).  Damages from the 
disaster continue to mount and U.S. emergency assistance is 
required to advise on a containment and remediation plan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Given the potential of emergency assistance to avert 
long-term economic and environmental damage to the Sea of 
Azov and Black Sea, the Ambassador declares the oil spill in 
the Kerch Strait a disaster.  He has determined that the 
incident is of a sufficient magnitude to warrant external 
assistance (ref A), the GOR has stated its willingness to 
accept assistance (ref B), and it is in the interests of the 
United States to provide such assistance. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ACTION: Mission requests OFDA consideration and 
approval of up to USD 50,000 to provide short-term technical 
expertise to mitigate environmental and economic damages.  In 
consultation with OFDA, Embassy proposes that these funds be 
used to support rapid assessment of the situation by a team 
from the U.S. Coast Guard or other agencies to consult with 
the GOR on the most appropriate response.  Remaining funds 
are also proposed to support short-term remediation efforts 
of local non-governmental organizations.
