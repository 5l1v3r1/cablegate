BEGIN NON-PAPER TEXT 
 
-- We welcome the September 8 supplemental agreement 
brokered by President Sarkozy, President Barroso and 
High Representative Solana that stipulated a timetable 
for withdrawal of Russian forces from areas outside of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia over the next few weeks. 
 
-- Rapid deployment of the proposed EU mission must 
occur to remove any pretext Russia might use to delay 
this schedule. 
 
-- We support an EU mandate that ensures access 
throughout Georgia. 
 
-- We are united in standing firm behind Georgia's 
territorial integrity, sovereignty and rapid recovery. 
 
-- We will continue to assist Georgia with its 
reconstruction, and we look forward to participating in 
the EU-hosted international donors' conference next 
month. 
 
-- A strong, international commitment there to help 
Georgia's economy would send a powerful message of 
solidarity.  The United States encourages European 
efforts to support Georgia's reconstruction with an EU 
contribution commensurate with the $1 billion pledge in 
assistance we have committed to bring to the EU 
conference. 
 
-- We will also need to work in close coordination to 
prepare for the October 15 meeting in Geneva, keeping it 
focused on resolving the long-standing Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia conflicts within Georgia's 
internationally-recognized borders, and reiterating 
support for Georgian territorial integrity. 
 
-- In terms of participation at the conference, both 
Russia and Georgia must participate in the same 
capacity.  Abkhaz and South Ossetians should not be 
allowed to participate in any way that implies 
recognition. 
 
-- Russia's disproportionate actions in Georgia have 
sent a sharp message of Russian aggression to our 
partners and friends in the region. 
 
-- We should reassure these states of our commitment to 
their security, independence, sovereignty, territorial 
integrity, prosperity and democratization. 
 
-- We must resist Russian attempts to restrict or 
undermine them and be prepared to counter efforts to 
stifle energy competition and diversification. 
 
 
STATE 00097574  002 OF 002 
 
 
-- We will be following closely Russia's implementation 
of its commitments under the six-point cease-fire 
agreement and supplementary agreement of September 8. 
 
-- While we welcome Russia's commitment to withdraw its 
forces to their pre-conflict positions, we are concerned 
by President Medvedev's September 9 statement that 
Russia would base 7,600 troops in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia.  We should remind Russia that the six-point 
cease-fire agreement obligates the withdrawal of forces 
to positions held before August 7. 
 
-- We should also strongly urge Russia not to block the 
flow of humanitarian assistance to any areas of Georgia. 
The Russian checkpoint at Karaleti continues to turn 
back shipments of humanitarian assistance and assessment 
teams that are trying to reach the villages south of 
Tskhinvali. 
 
-- Based on Russian willingness to complete its 
withdrawal and allow EU/OSCE monitors access to South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia, we will reassess the situation and 
our relationship accordingly. 
 
-- In the meantime, coordination on possible approaches 
as the situation develops will send a clear signal of 
unity and determination.
