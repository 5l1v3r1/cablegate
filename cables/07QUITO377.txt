REF:  06 Quito 2513 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Ecuador will request the formation of a WTO dispute 
settlement panel to hear Ecuador's complaint against the current EU 
banana regime.  Ecuador would like to see the U.S. join the case as 
a full partner, since it believes that U.S. participation is 
necessary to secure EU compliance with a WTO decision.  End summary. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Under Secretary for International Economic Policy Fernando 
Yepez told EconCouns on February 14 that the GOE has decided to 
request the formation of a WTO dispute settlement panel to consider 
Ecuador's complaint against the current EU banana regime.  Ecuador 
requested consultations with the EU in November (reftel), and after 
inconclusive consultations in December and January the GOE believes 
that it needs to move forward with the dispute settlement process to 
maintain pressure on the EU to lower its tariff on Latin bananas. 
Yepez said that the Ministers of Agriculture, Industry, and Foreign 
Affairs approved the decision to move forward with the WTO case on 
February 13 and he had just requested that the GOE's U.S.-based 
attorney prepare Ecuador's submission. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Yepez noted that time is not on Ecuador's side.  He said 
that he understands that the EU is likely to conclude a free trade 
agreement (FTA) in 2008 with the ACP (African, Caribbean, and 
Pacific) countries that would grant the ACP countries preferential 
access to the EU in the context of an FTA.  An EU-ACP FTA, he said, 
would undercut Ecuador's main arguments against the current EU 
banana regime.  Therefore Ecuador is anxious to maintain pressure on 
the EU to lower its tariffs on Latin bananas before the EU-ACP trade 
agreement enters into force. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The GOE hopes to request the formation of a dispute 
settlement panel at the February 20 meeting of the Dispute 
Settlement Body (DSB).  However, Yepez said, he believes that agenda 
for the February 20 meeting may already be closed.  If so, Ecuador 
may request an extraordinary DSB meeting or may have to wait until 
the March DSB meeting. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Yepez urged the United States to join with Ecuador as a 
full partner in the case, rather than continue as a third party.  He 
noted that only original parties to the initial WTO banana case can 
be full parties to the current case.  Of the initial group (U.S., 
Ecuador, Mexico, Honduras, and Panama) that could join Ecuador, he 
said, the U.S. is the one country with sufficient weight to force 
the EU to take notice.  He added that if the case reaches the 
retaliation phase, U.S. participation as a full party would be 
particularly important since the size of the U.S. market would be 
critical leverage in securing compliance from the EU.
