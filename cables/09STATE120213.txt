E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETTC KOMC LY
SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-LICENSE/PRE-SHIPMENT 
END-USE CHECK ON LICENSE 050101439 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on license 050101493 for 
the export of International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled 
aircraft parts and components to Libya.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: To verify that the Libyan Air Force 
(LAF) ordered the aircraft parts and components from foreign 
consignee Romeera Aero Spares Limited (RASL).  According to 
US Customs data, no shipments have been made under this 
license although it was approved over a year and half ago. 
Furthermore, RASL and the foreign intermediate consignee, 
Kearsley Airways Limited (KAL), are entities of concern due 
to previous unfavorable Blue Lantern checks. 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post confirm that the 
LAF ordered the aircraft parts listed below from RASL for the 
purpose stated on the license.  Post is also requested to 
inquire as to if and when the LAF intends to take delivery of 
the parts listed on the license. 
 
END ACTION.
