SUBJECT: TURKEY OPPOSES ICAO PLANS TO TRANSFER SAR 
RESPONSIBILITIES TO CYPRIOTS 
 
This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Turkish MFA Civil Aviation officials 
summoned PMA Counselor on February 12 to request U.S. support 
at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
Turkey has written an objection letter to ICAO leadership 
opposing its plans to transfer "state" responsibility for 
Search and Rescue (SAR) services around Cyprus from the UK to 
the Cypriot Government.  Turkey argues that doing so will 
provide undue legitimacy to the "Greek Cypriot" government at 
a time when the divided island faces the prospect of renewed 
negotiations to achieve a political settlement.  ICAO 
counters, however, that this proposed change has no effect on 
the current state responsibility, which they argue has always 
been borne by the Cypriot government, and involves no more 
than a change of name of the rescue coordination center. Post 
requests guidance from the Department on how to respond to 
the MFA's request for support.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 12, PMA Counselor was summoned to the 
MFA Civil Aviation Department where he was briefed on an 
impending decision by ICAO to transfer "state" responsibility 
for Search and Rescue (SAR) services around Cyprus from the 
UK's Episkopi Rescue Coordination Center to the Cypriotm 
government (Larnaca RCC).  MFA DDG Basat Ozturk argued that 
doing so would provide undue legitimacy to the "Greek 
Cypriot" government at a time when the divided island faces 
the prospect of renewed negotiations to achieve a political 
settlement.  He added that this has heretofore been a UK 
government responsibility and the GOT sees this as more than 
a name change.  In a letter from ICAO Council President 
Roberto Gonzalez to Turkey's ICAO Representative, Vakur 
Gokdenizler, Gonzalez argues that this proposal has no effect 
on the current state responsibility for SAR in the Cypriot 
region, which he says has always been held by the Cypriot 
government, and that it involves no more than a change of 
name of the rescue coordination center. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ozturk told us that Turkey has written an objection 
letter to ICAO regarding this issue and Gokdenizler will meet 
to discuss it on February 15 with ICAO leadership.  The MFA 
also met with a UK embassy representative on February 12 to 
formally voice Turkish opposition to this transfer of 
responsibility.  Our UK embassy contact told us that she too 
has requested guidance from London about the UK's position on 
this issue. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ozturk requested U.S. support for Turkey,s position 
at ICAO.  Turkey's argument depends on its assertion that 
such transfers of responsibility involving Cyprus cannot be 
legitimate until a political solution is achieved on the 
island,s status.  The Greek Cypriot government is not bona 
fide and thus does not represent the full citizenry of 
Cyprus, they argue.  Ozturk said that Turkey will refuse to 
recognize any ICAO decision that transfers SAR 
responsibilities under such circumstances. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action Request:  Post requests guidance from the 
Department on how to respond to Turkey's request for 
assistance and support.
