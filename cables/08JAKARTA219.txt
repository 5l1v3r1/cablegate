SUBJECT: INDONESIA PREPARES FOR SECOND HEART OF BORNEO MEETING 
 
¶1. (SBU) Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam will meet on 
February 27-28, 2008 for the second Heart of Borneo (HOB) trilateral 
meeting in Pontianak, West Kalimantan.  At this meeting, the parties 
intend to consider and adopt a "Decision on the Institutional 
Arrangement for the Implementation of the HOB Initiative".  This 
will consist of the adoption of a "Strategic Plan for the 
Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Heart of Borneo", 
and the establishment of a "Committee on the Implementation of the 
HOB Initiative" (The Committee on HOB). 
 
The Committee on HOB and HOB Secretariat 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Terms of Reference (TORs) for the Committee do not 
diverge substantially from the proposals made at the first HOB 
trilateral meeting.  The meetings of the Committee (at least once a 
year) will replace the trilateral HOB Initiative meetings.  The TORs 
also establish a Secretariat of HOB and Open Ended Advisory Group on 
HOB to support the Committee on HOB.  The draft decision documents 
do not specify the location of this permanent Secretariat -- the 
subject of debate at the first trilateral meeting in Bandar Seri 
Begawan in July 2007, when Brunei offered to host the Secretariat 
and finance it for the first several years.  Our contacts at WWF 
Indonesia indicate that the Government of Indonesia (GOI) is now 
more amenable to Brunei's offer. 
 
Strategic Plan for HOB and National Action Plans 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. (U) The Strategic Plan that the parties will adopt in Pontianak 
identifies four broad programs: 
 
-- Transboundary management 
-- Protected areas management 
-- Sustainable natural resources management (outside protected 
areas), and 
-- Sustainable financing 
 
Corresponding tables list proposed actions for each program. 
Indonesia brought its draft national action plan to the first 
trilateral meeting in July 2007.  However, Malaysia and Brunei were 
not ready with theirs at the time, so the three parties postponed 
discussion of a harmonized master action plan for the second HOB. 
Indonesia's HOB National Working Group has continued to refine the 
action plan.  It is currently meeting in Balikpapan, East 
Kalimantan, to finalize a draft dated January 22. 
 
Financing and Donor Activity 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to WWF Indonesia, the GOI and the National 
Working Group would like external donors to help fund the trilateral 
Secretariat, as well as provincial-level secretariats.  Germany, 
 
SIPDIS 
through GTZ, is contributing 2.5 million euros under an agreement 
signed last November to support Indonesian implementation of the HOB 
Initiative.  The two governments are still discussing implementation 
but expect to begin disbursing funds during the latter half of 2008. 
 Interested corporate partners such as BHP Billiton, an Australian 
coal mining company that operates in Central Kalimantan, are 
awaiting further developments before making firm commitments to 
support HOB.  GOI spending on the HOB Initiative so far has been 
extremely limited.  The 2007-2008 national budget allocated the 
Ministry of Forestry 75 million rupiah (roughly $8,000), and East, 
Central, and West Kalimantan Provinces 100 million rupiah each (less 
than $11,000) for HOB-related activities. 
 
¶5. (U) Post can forward by email draft texts of the referenced 
documents upon request (The Indonesian draft action plan is 
available only in Bahasa Indonesia).  Contact Machut Shishak 
(shishakma@state.gov) or Sri Murniati (murniatisx@state.gov).
