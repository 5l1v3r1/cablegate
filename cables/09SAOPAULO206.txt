SUBJECT:  Media Reaction Sao Paulo- G20 surpasses expectations- 
Consensus and Values- G20: beyond the meeting in London  04-03-2009 
 
Media Reaction: Global Economy/ G20 Summit; Sao Paulo 
April 3, 2009 
 
Title- G20 surpasses expectations 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (4-3) states: "The 
US$1.1 trillion package to help countries most affected by the 
crisis and to finance global trade was the most important decision 
of the G20 meeting.  With this money, the International Monetary 
Fund, World Bank and other multilateral institutions will be able to 
fight recession in emerging countries, attenuate social problems in 
the poorest and facilitate exports, one of the main engines of the 
global economy.  Aiming for results in the short run, chiefs of 
state have also committed to continue taking measures to boost 
activity in their countries and to secure solidity of the most 
important financial institutions to achieve confidence in the 
markets.  No one, though, has made specific commitments with regards 
to new fiscal stimulus through tax cuts or an increase in 
expenditures..." 
 
Title- Consensus and Values 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-3) by columnist Clovis Rossi 
says: "If we could trust in politicians, the summary of the London 
Summit would be simple: the Washington Consensus goes out and 
'values and principles' come in....[but the final text released by 
the G20] does not sound  like the end of the Washington Consensus, 
even if it has been frail for a long time....It doesn't seem to 
match with President Lula's speech in Santiago do Chile in favor of 
a 'strong State either....the most likely result of the summit is . 
. . .  G8 goes out and G20 comes in." 
Title- G20: beyond the meeting in London 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-3) by economist and former 
Brazilian Minister Luiz Carlos Mendonga de Barros notes:  "The most 
important fact created [by the G20 summit] seems to me to be the 
signals that we have entered a period of big changes. [President 
Barack] Obama's affirmation that the world should not rely on the 
excesses of U.S. purchases is a turning point....the U.S. 
President's statement evidences the need of a deep review of the 
current rules."
