Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Major media reported that yesterday President Shimon Peres told the 
UN General Assembly that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's 
speech on Tuesday constituted the "darkest anti-Semitic libel," akin 
to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Israel Radio quoted Peres 
as saying that the U.S. will have no choice but to curb Iran in 
order to save the entire world.  The Jerusalem Post reported that 
objections from Moscow, angered by Washington's criticism of its 
invasion of Georgia, have forced the cancellation of high-level 
talks on Iran that were scheduled for today on the sidelines of the 
UN General Assembly, endangering a fourth round of sanctions against 
Iran.  The newspaper quoted a senior American diplomat as saying 
yesterday that "there clearly is spillover of the difficulties 
created by the Georgia crisis, difficulties with Russian behavior 
that we have to work through." The Jerusalem Post quoted Israel's 
Ambassador to the UN as saying that she felt that Russia's move 
spelled the end of sanctions. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Defense Minister and Labor Party Chairman 
Ehud Barak will demand from prime minister-designate Tzipi Livni 
that he conduct the negotiations with Syria if she forms a 
government.  Yediot reported that Livni is expected to continue 
reserved negotiations with Syria.  Ha'aretz quoted Labor sources as 
saying that Barak will demand to be fully involved in all aspects of 
the talks with the Palestinians. 
 
Maariv detailed a package deal that Egypt is proposing: the 
establishment of a Palestinian unity government; the opening of the 
Rafah crossing and the lifting of the siege on Gaza; the 
continuation of the lull and the prevention of fire into Israel; the 
dispatch to Gaza of a force composed of troops from several Arab 
states.  Maariv reported that Egypt has already started contacts 
with Palestinian factions to implement the deal.  Maariv also 
reported that Israel has agreed to release 80 more Palestinian 
prisoners "with blood on their hands" in exchange for Gilad Shalit. 
 
Electronic media reported that last night a pipe bomb was placed 
next to the Jerusalem home of liberal historian Prof. Zeev 
Sternhell, a recipient of the Israel Prize in political science, 
injuring him slightly.  The media quoted the police as saying that 
far-Right militants are suspected.  Tracts offering great amounts of 
money to kill Peace Now members were found near Sternhell's house. 
 
Leading media reported that three East Jerusalem residents believed 
to have belonged to a terror cell have been indicted for killing two 
security forces members in Jerusalem.  Ha'aretz reported that 
yesterday the IDF arrested four Palestinians who allegedly tried to 
run over a soldier at a roadblock just north of Ramallah.  The 
Jerusalem Post reported that in the face of a growing terror threat 
originating in East Jerusalem, Shin Bet has recommended legislative 
changes to permit financial sanctions on the families of terrorists 
as well as the indictment of suspects caught in the early stages of 
planning attacks. 
 
Maariv reported that PM Ehud Olmert has ordered the establishment of 
a "Global Jihad forum" whose purpose will be to better cope with 
terror threats emanating from around the world. 
 
Ha'aretz's Internet edition reported that B'Tselem, a left-wing 
human rights organization based in Israel, has sent two official 
staffers to Washington and New York for the first time. 
 
Ha'aretz quoted McCain adviser Max Boot as saying that the peace 
process that was resumed at Annapolis was a "mistake" and that there 
are 30 conflicts in the world that demand more urgent attention than 
the Israeli-Palestinian one.  The newspaper quoted another McCain 
adviser, Richard Williamson, as saying that McCain does not intend 
to dictate Israel's behavior, but that the hope is that as a friend, 
Israel will listen to the U.S.  Ha'aretz quoted Democratic 
vice-presidential candidate Senator Joseph Biden as saying that 
Obama rejects the argument that a direct discussion with adversaries 
is a sign of weakness, and that it is the opposite. 
 
Yediot reported that in New York, Iranian President Ahmadinejad 
invited its correspondent, Yaniv Halili, to visit his father's house 
in Mashhad. 
 
All media reported that El Al flight 324 from Paris to Tel Aviv was 
escorted to Israel by air force fighter planes before its 8 p.m. 
landing last night due to suspicions that a bomb had been placed 
onboard.  It proved to be a false alarm. 
 
Yediot reported that an Israeli court has ruled that the state 
should compensate seven Iraqis who infiltrated into Israel in the 
early nineties to the tune of 2.7 million shekels (around $ 
789,000).  The court deemed their detention too long. 
 
Ha'aretz quoted Police Commissioner David Cohen as saying: 
"Government corruption is the greatest strategic threat to Israel" 
 
Major media cited data published yesterday by in the annual report 
of the GOI's Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS): On the eve of the 
Jewish New Year, Israel's population stands at 7,337,000 people, 
including 5,542,000 Jewish Israelis (75.5 percent) and 1,477,000 
Israeli Arabs (20.1 percent).  The figures also include another 
318,000 Israelis listed under the category of "others," in which 
some 200,000 foreign workers were counted. The report states that 
the population grew by 1.8 percent over the past year.  The report 
also says that Israel's population is relatively young compared to 
other Western nations.  The report also reveals a substantial gap in 
the life expectancy of Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs.  Makor 
Rishon-Hatzofe also reported that the CBS predicts a 4.5% growth in 
the Israeli economy in 2008. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Hollywood producers, East Coast property 
barons, and a Swiss banker were among Livni's main supporters in her 
race to lead the Kadima Party.  Shaul Mofaz found support among the 
wealthy business barons of the Iranian-American Jewish community, 
according to the campaign contributions lists that the two handed 
over to the State Comptroller. 
 
Yediot reported that the IDF is making use of the social networking 
site Facebook to ensnare young female draft dodgers.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: "The next 
[Israeli] government must adhere to [Tzipi Livni's] balanced 
approach.  It must explain to the public that Israel does not face a 
holocaust and that it can defend itself and deter its enemies.  The 
next government must support a diplomatic effort led by the United 
States to change Iran's threatening policy."

"A Reply to Ahmadinejad" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (9/25): "Israel 
is justifiably concerned about the naivete with which Ahmadinejad 
was received by the American media, as well as the world's growing 
tendency to view him as a legitimate leader and cease efforts to 
stop the Iranian nuclear program.... The chance that the United 
States or Israel will try to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities looks 
slim at the moment.... Since a direct Israeli rapprochement with 
Iran is impossible because of the regime's hostility to Israel's 
very existence, the best chance of calming the atmosphere and 
reducing the threat lies in starting negotiations between the United 
States and Iran.  The two U.S. presidential candidates support this 
approach, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, with the understanding 
that it is the only route not yet tried and is likely to help 
moderate Iranian policy.... Prime minister-designate Tzipi Livni 
presented a balanced approach to the Iranian threat in interviews 
before the Kadima primary.  Livni does not accept the statement that 
Israel 'will not be able to live' with a nuclear Iran; she says 
Israel will live and must deal with the challenges it faces.  In her 
response to Ahmadinejad's speech yesterday, Livni demanded that Iran 
not be allowed to join the UN Security Council, but she was not 
carried away into making belligerent threats.  Livni believes that 
Israel must not stand at the head of Iran's opponents, releasing the 
international community from the need to stop that country's nuclear 
program.  The next government must adhere to the balanced approach. 
It must explain to the public that Israel does not face a holocaust 
and that it can defend itself and deter its enemies.  The next 
government must support a diplomatic effort led by the United States 
to change Iran's threatening policy."

Summary:

Middle East affairs commentator Dr. Guy Bechor, a lecturer at the 
Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot: "In the heat of the leadership vacuum we are 
facing, and in the shallowness of our senior figures: Is anyone 
preparing for the Palestinian disintegration, which will of course 
affect us?" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "If [the Republic of Ireland] had stuck to 
the approach of 'everything or nothing' of Arafat and Abbas, it 
would have remained under British occupation until now."

¶I.  "Nearing another Intifada?" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Dr. Guy Bechor, a lecturer at the 
Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot (9/25): "The Israeli government's desire to reach a 
diplomatic solution with Abbas until the end of the year is not 
feasible.  Abu Mazen will become radical in his statements and his 
actions in the coming months.  It is no accident that he went to 
visit Samir Kuntar in Lebanon, and is once again declaring the 
return of the refugees.  To keep from being accused of capitulation 
to Israel, he will become more extreme in his criticism and 
goals.... We have reached the absurd situation where it all depends 
now on Abu Mazen in person.   The artificial support of the harmful 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for Abu Mazen has made him into 
a main axis: If he stays, there will ostensibly be a diplomatic 
solution, and if he goes, everything will collapse along with him. 
How absurd!  This status, which grants Abbas great weight and 
importance, also reflects great weakness.  How can we reach an 
agreement with him, when he does not represent a large part of his 
own PA?  How can we reach an agreement with him when his future 
presidency is not democratic?  He has effectively dissolved the 
parliament, he has formed an unlawful government with the necessary 
authorization of parliament, and now, perhaps, he will extend his 
term.  And what if another Palestinian president, a Hamas figures, 
serves along with him?  Finally, Hamas's prevention of the elections 
will bring an end to the Palestinian dreams of unity, and will make 
it clear that this is a division into two peoples, with two 
different fates.  The Palestinian vision now covers four states: in 
Gaza, Judea and Samaria [i.e. the West Bank], Jordan, and Israel. 
Not bad for people who do not have even one state.  The only way out 
of the Palestinian distress might be a new kind of Intifada, or 
other military activity against Israel, which could reunite the 
Palestinian forces.  Tzipi Livni's term as prime minister, if she is 
elected, will encourage them to act this way -- they will view 
Israel as having become weaker.  Are we ready for this?  In the heat 
of the leadership vacuum we are facing, and in the shallowness of 
our senior figures: Is anyone preparing for the Palestinian 
disintegration, which will of course affect us?" 
 
II.  "Better Occupation than a Partial Peace" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (9/25): "The Palestinians are using as their 
model the end of British colonial rule in India, Asia and Africa: 
full independence and a complete withdrawal of the foreign presence. 
 But that is not the only model for ending an occupation.  In 
Ireland a religious and nationalistic dispute has been going on for 
hundreds of years.  After the Irish revolt during World War I, the 
British offered to end their rule of the neighboring island.  The 
agreement, reached finally in 1921, promised the Irish approximately 
what Olmert is offering Abbas today.  The British kept their 
'settlement blocs' in Northern Ireland, and Irish sovereignty in the 
south remained under the auspices of the empire based in London. 
The British fleet continued to control Irish ports.... If [the 
Republic of Ireland] had stuck to the approach of 'everything or 
nothing' of Arafat and Abbas, it would have remained under British 
occupation until now."
