DAILY 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Khartoum pro-regime daily Akhbar al Youm headlined April 17 
on page one the Sudan-US talks in Rome, prominently announcing 
"details of the talks on Sudanese-US relations on their first day." 
The article states that "today the two sides will conclude important 
talks for developing bilateral relations." Sudanese Ambassador in 
Rome Rabie Hassan Ahmed is quoted saying that the two sides have 
"tabled their proposals in regard to pending issues."  The 
Ambassador underlines the importance of the talks to tackle "all 
joint and pending issues" and "to enhance and develop bilateral 
relations." Photographs of FM Alor and party chief Nafie 
accompanying the article graphically demonstrated the high level of 
Sudanese participation in the talks. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Although the article is in fact very thin on 
details (especially in comparison to the NY Times article datelined 
in Washington of the same day based on the leaked non-paper 
"received from an American official critical of the administration's 
position") the overall tone of the article is overwhelmingly 
optimistic and sets high expectations for a breakthrough in Sudan-US 
relations.  This will likely frame the way that any result (positive 
or negative) from Rome is received.  If there is no breakthrough or 
at least some tangible progress in Rome, we expect disappointment 
not just from the Government but also from many quarters of Sudanese 
society.  This will of course frame our relationships going forward, 
with the GOS more intransigent than ever on the things are important 
to us in Darfur and on the CPA (not to mention the NEC), and some of 
the Sudanese population (especially in Khartoum) frustrated by a 
perceived rigidity in US policy toward Sudan while others in the 
country with their own special agenda will breathe a sigh of relief 
at a lack of progress.
