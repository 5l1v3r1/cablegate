(SBU) Pol/Econ Chief May 30 delivered reftel demarche 
concerning joining The Hague Code of Conduct Against 
Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCOC) to MFA Director for 
Bilateral Affairs Dr. Dhafer Al Umran.  Al Umran said that 
the HCOC sounded like a logical extension of Bahrain's 
participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative.  He 
said he would request the MFA legal office to do an analysis 
of the HCOC text and pass it to the Ministry of Defense for 
its input.
