Mr. President, 
 
On behalf of the Government and people of the Kingdom of 
Bahrain, I convey to you our condolences at the death in 
Saudi Arabia of an American citizen, Mr. Paul Johnson.  His 
kidnapping and violent death is strongly condemned by all 
peace-loving people. My Government commends the efforts of 
the Saudi Arabian authorities in pursuing those who chose to 
follow their political aims through acts of terror and we 
are united in our efforts to combat all acts of terrorism 
worldwide. 
 
With my kindest regards,
