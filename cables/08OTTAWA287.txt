¶1. (SBU) Using reftel points, ESTH Counselor demarched both 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT) and Natural Resources Canada, urging Canada to 
support eventual International Energy Agency membership for 
China and India.  The growing role and impact of China and 
India in world energy markets and the need for them to be 
responsible participants in the global energy system, coupled 
with present requirements for IEA membership, made it 
necessary to begin planning for their participation in the 
IEA as early as possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DFAIT officials advised on February 25 that they 
were considering the question of IEA membership for China and 
India, including what sorts of institutional changes might be 
required to bring them into the IEA.  In considering these 
matters, DFAIT will have an intra-departmental meeting on 
February 28.  DFAIT officials expect an inter-agency meeting 
following that will be needed to reach a coordinated 
Government of Canada position. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy understands that the two main agencies 
involved in Canada's IEA participation -- DFAIT and Natural 
Resources Canada -- do not hold the identical view on IEA 
membership for China and India.  Natural Resources Assistant 
Deputy Minister for Energy Policy Sue Kirby told EEB A/S 
Sullivan a month ago that IEA membership for China and India 
could pose some difficulties for Canada.  Canada and other 
IEA members believed that only open market principles could 
underpin a well functioning global energy system, and that 
Canada would not agree to changing this founding principle of 
the Agency.  The fundamental question of where China and 
India stand on open market principles for energy would have 
to be resolved before Canada could support their membership 
in the Agency.  DFAIT officials, on the other hand, told A/S 
Sullivan they were open to considering the question 
positively.  The noted that within the Government of Canada, 
DFAIT leads on questions of outreach in the IEA. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy will advise as soon as we learn of a 
coordinated Canadian government position on membership in the 
IEA for China and India, but this is unlikely before the 
second week of March.
