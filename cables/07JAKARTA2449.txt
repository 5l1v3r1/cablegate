¶1. (SBU) On September 5, Embassy received official correspondence 
from Government of Indonesia (GOI) Minister of Environment Rachmat 
Witoelar addressed to Under Secretary of State for Democracy and 
Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky.  The letter invites U/S Dobriansky 
to informal ministerial consultations in Bogor, Indonesia, on 24 and 
25 October 2007.  The consultations are to prepare for the 
Thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Bali this 
December.  The GOI and Norway (the co-host) are still working on the 
logistical details.  Embassy will convey that information as soon as 
it is available, and advises that attendees request hotel 
reservations immediately thereafter because of the limited number of 
rooms.

Dear Ms. Dobriansky, 
 
As President-designate of the thirteenth session of the Conference 
of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the third session of the Conference 
of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto 
Protocol, it is my honour to invite you to the informal ministerial 
consultations to be held in Bogor, Indonesia on 24 and 
25 October 2007. 
 
Around the world, debates on climate change are moving with a new 
sense of urgency and openness. This year has seen an unprecedented 
number of discussions at the highest levels, which have resulted in 
a many powerful political signals. The informal ministerial 
consultations in Bogor will seek to build on this momentum and seek 
to prepare the ground for successful outcomes at the Bali Conference 
in December 2007. 
 
The consultations will start with an informal dinner on the evening 
of the 23 October to welcome arriving ministers. Ministers would 
then engage in one and a half days of discussion on 24 and 2S 
October 2007. On 25 October, the meeting would conclude with a lunch 
in time to allow ministers to make departing flights later in the 
afternoon and evening. 
 
The character of the Bogor consultations will be informal in order 
to ensure a frank and useful exchange of views on the key issues for 
Bali. I look forward to welcoming you to this important meeting and 
count on your support to making the Bali Conference a success. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
Rachmat Witoelar
