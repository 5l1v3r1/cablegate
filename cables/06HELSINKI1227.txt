SUBJECT: FINNS BACK INTEROPERABILITY OF GPS AND GALILEO 
 
REF: SECSTATE 196107 
 
Â¶1. (U) Dr. Matti Roine, Director of the Traffic Safety Unit 
at the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications, said 
Finland ratified the 2004 GPS-Galileo Cooperation Agreement 
on October 1, 2004.  Roine said all funding for Galileo comes 
directly from the EU Commission, rather than individual 
member states.  Roine reaffirmed that GPS-Galileo cooperation 
and interoperability remains a major focus for the new 
Galileo Satellite Authority, the governing body for Galileo 
operations.  The Finns envisions GPS and Galileo, when it is 
fully deployed, being used together to improve worldwide 
navigation.
