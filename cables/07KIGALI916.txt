Gatsinzi has been the focus of rumors regarding his role in 
the 1994 genocide as a senior officer of the Habyarimana-era 
armed forces, he was a moderate Hutu officer who both 
attempted to restrain the extremists in security force ranks, 
and broke with the regime and joined the RPA when he was able 
to do so.  He offered a general apology to the Rwandan public 
in 2005 for being a member of the genocidal government.
