¶1. SUMMARY: Indonesia is a unique example of how free and open new 
media and technology can support democracy and economic growth, a 
theme we understand Secretary Clinton plans to address at the 
Newseum on January 21.  Indonesian civil society is already 
harnessing social networking media to influence government actions 
and policy. Post is drawing on cutting-edge technology to increase 
the effectiveness of programming in strategic areas.  There are 
positive indications that the regulations governing the fast-growing 
telcom sector may be slated for reform, paving the way for greater 
U.S. involvement.  In this environment, opportunities abound for the 
U.S. to partner with Indonesia to develop and leverage the nation's 
free and active internet community and technology infrastructure. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
HOW CIVIL SOCIETY USES NEW MEDIA 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. Although only 10% of Indonesians have internet access, the web is 
fast becoming an invaluable tool for Indonesian civil society.  The 
internet community has remained vibrant, despite a 2008 law 
mandating up to six years in prison for online defamation. 
Indonesia has the second-fastest growing group of Facebook users in 
the world, and the social networking site has become a key forum for 
political expression.  In recent months, more than one million 
Indonesians used Facebook to protest the arrest of two widely 
respected members of the Corruption Eradication Commission on what 
were widely regarded as trumped up charges, forcing the government 
to take action (ref A).  Hundreds of thousands of Facebook users 
rallied in defense of Prita Mulyasari, an Indonesian housewife 
jailed for complaining through e-mail about poor medical service 
(ref B).  The case sparked an immense outpouring of public support 
for the accused and open criticism of the defamation law, which is 
now slated for reexamination by the Indonesian legislature. 
 
WHAT EMBASSY JAKARTA IS DOING WITH THE WEB AND TECHNOLOGY 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. Post is already leveraging new media and technology to increase 
program effectiveness.  USAID's Senada program is just one example 
of how technology can enhance the competitiveness of Indonesian 
enterprises and agribusinesses.  Internet centers in rural areas 
enable farmers to market their products using the internet and keep 
their operations supplied more efficiently.  There is enormous 
potential for collaboration with the private sector as well. 
Another USAID initiative is "IMulai", a public-private partnership 
with Microsoft Indonesia designed to stimulate innovation.  Those 
ideas will in turn contribute to the development of Indonesia's 
light manufacturing industries.  Post has joined forces with a 
number of private-sector IT firms to form an "ICT Task Force", which 
is examining ways to put cutting-edge U.S. technology in Indonesian 
classrooms. 
 
¶4. Technology has also proved an effective platform for democracy 
and governance initiatives.  USAID's electronic Community 
Information Service (e-CIS for short) is an internet and SMS-based 
service by which citizens can directly convey concerns, complaints 
and suggestions to the local government via SMS or by posting on the 
local government's website.  The information is then automatically 
forwarded to the relevant office for a response within 48 hours. 
E-CIS was nominated for this year's Indonesian Information and 
Communication Technology Awards for Software Innovations. 
 
¶5. The new media environment in Indonesia provides a multitude of 
opportunities for public diplomacy and for engagement with new and 
younger audiences.  The Mission has launched a YouTube channel and a 
Facebook page with promising results.  Embassy Jakarta has 22,415 
active Facebook fans and more than 3,000 viewers on YouTube.  Also, 
for the past two years, the Mission has been lead sponsor of "Pesta 
Blogger," an annual gathering of Indonesian bloggers.  Post has also 
recently sponsored blogshops which drew hundreds of young attendees 
across ten cities. 
 
¶6. Despite the low level of internet penetration, Indonesia boasts 
more than one million PDAs and iPhones, and the highest rate of 
growth in the world for the Blackberry handheld.  Existing 
regulations require domestic telecommunications operators to source 
a significant percentage of capital and operating expenditures 
domestically, discouraging foreign investment and hindering 
long-term development of the sector.  However, in addition to 
possible remedy through the WTO, there is well-placed support for 
reform within the GOI. The time is right to explore additional 
possibilities with Indonesia's increasingly web-savvy population and 
growing technology sector.
