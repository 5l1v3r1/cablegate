¶1. (SBU) Multiple rebel and UN sources confirmed the fighting 
between JEM and SLM/Minnawi forces in the Minnawi stronghold of 
Muhajiriya the morning of January 15 (Ref A), but details remain 
scarce and the scope of the fighting remains in question.  According 
to UN sources, clashes apparently started when a group of JEM 
vehicles moved into a Minnawi-held area, possibly with the intent of 
poaching Minnawi fighters for its own ranks. UNAMID has not yet 
entered Muhajiriya and was unable to confirm details of the 
fighting, though one UN source stated that the clashes resulted in 
only four deaths and had subsided by mid-morning. The fighting was 
preceded by SAF aerial bombing of rebel positions (apparently JEM) 
in South Darfur on January 13. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 15 poloff spoke with an officer in UNAMID's 
Joint Mission Analysis Center (JMAC). He stated that the fighting 
was triggered by a group of thirteen JEM vehicles led by Minnawi 
defector Bakhit Karima entering the Muhajiriya area with the intent 
of recruiting Minnawi fighters into JEM's ranks. Four people were 
reportedly killed in the clashes, he said. The fighting subsided 
around 10:15 AM. He noted that UNAMID has yet to enter Muhajiriya to 
confirm the details. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poloff also spoke with a UNDSS Security Officer, who stated 
he heard the clashes commenced when an uneasy truce between SLM/MM 
and the JEM fighters in Muhajiriya went awry. JEM fighters had moved 
into the area against the wishes of SLM/Minnawi, but discussions 
between the two groups were ongoing to allow JEM a safe passage 
provided that certain conditions were met, he said. One of these 
conditions was that JEM stay out certain areas, he said. JEM forces 
failed to meet this condition when they entered village of Khataba, 
south of Muhajiriya town, to restock on supplies. Upon violation of 
the agreement, clashes ensued. He had no information as to the scope 
of the fighting but had no news that it had subsided. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Multiple rebel sources confirmed fighting between JEM and 
Minnawi troops in the Muhajiriya area. SLA/Unity's Abubakar Kado 
affirmed that fighting was taking place and that the forces of Bahar 
Abu Gharda of JEM/Collective Leadership (URF) were fighting 
alongside Minnawi. Suliman Marjan, a Maidob commander affiliated 
with Abdul Wahid, also asserted that clashes were taking place 
between JEM and Minnawi forces. (Note: Marjan had previously told 
emboff on January 14 that JEM forces were concentrating in the area 
of Kalajo, approximately 25 km west of Muhajiriya town. He stated 
that JEM's presence there was creating tensions with Minnawi and 
threatening the peace there. End Note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) Marjan also told emboff that seven Maidob former fighters 
who escaped the JEM encampment in Um Jaras, Chad following clashes 
with JEM Zaghawa there had arrived in his area of control after 
walking for 13 days (Ref B).  (Note: Marjan himself is Maidob. End 
note.) He said the Maidob described Um Jaras as "Guantanamo" because 
Khalil use to imprison anyone who protested against his orders. They 
said that twenty senior Maidob commanders were killed by Khalil and 
that many junior military ranks are still under detention. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: Details of the fighting between JEM and Minnawi 
have yet to be fully verified on site by UNAMID, and reliable 
information remains notoriously hard to come by. It is exacerbated 
by the sometimes circular flow of information amongst the rebels, 
UN, media and the diplomatic community. Post will report more as 
additional information becomes available. End comment.
