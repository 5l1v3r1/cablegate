¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on January 28 to 
Ivo Pascual Herrera at MFA's Directorate of 
Counter-Terrorism.  Econoff informed Pascual that the UN 1267 
Sanctions Committee had approved the designation of the three 
reftel Kuwait-based terrorist facilitators, and that the U.S. 
had similarly designated these three under E.O. 13224 along 
with two other individuals.  Econoff requested that the GOS 
take action to freeze the assets of and block any transaction 
by these individuals. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Pascual expressed appreciation for the background 
information and said that he would pass it on to the relevant 
law enforcement authorities.  He noted that the GOS generally 
implements 1267 designations immediately.
