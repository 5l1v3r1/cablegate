In Today's Papers 
 
The Cartoon Crisis 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet and others: 
Violent protests continued yesterday over the cartoons 
depicting the Prophet Mohammed, claiming the lives of 
protesters in Afghanistan, Somali and Lebanon.  Turkish PM 
Erdogan and Spanish PM Zapatero issued a joint statement 
yesterday calling for calm and respect.  Turkey is holding 
talks with the UN, EU and OIC to defuse the tension.  The 
OIC's Parliamentary Union is scheduled to meet in Turkey in 
April to discuss ways to prevent similar controversies. 
Foreign Minister Gul raised concerns by stating 'I am sad to 
say during the past few years hostility against Muslims 
started replacing anti-Semitism.  Freedom of the press 
exists in Turkey but that does not mean that everyone can 
write without limits and insult others'.   Meanwhile, UN 
Secretary General Annan called on Muslims to accept 
 
SIPDIS 
apologies offered over published cartoons and act with calm 
and dignity.  The US Embassy in Ankara released a press 
statement yesterday saying that cartoons depicting the 
Prophet Mohammed were offensive and morally repugnant.  The 
press release also emphasized the US recognition of freedom 
of expression. 
 
Commenting on the ongoing cartoon crisis, Turkish writers 
expressed varied opinions.  In mainstream Milliyet, Hasan 
Cemal emphasized that fanatics have gained momentum after 
the events. "Any radical trying to create a clash between 
Islam and the West must be very happy now.  The cartoon 
issue demonstrates that freedom can sometimes manifest 
itself as a form of racism against a particular faith.  But 
the incidents taking place in the Islamic world also show 
that the reaction has been hijacked by those willing to use 
violence," he noted. 
 
In Radikal retired diplomat Gunduz Aktan observed the 
essence of the issue as racism. "In the aftermath of 9/11, 
racist sentiment against Muslims, and in this context Turks, 
soared dangerously in Europe due to Al-Qaeda's terrorism. 
Politicians and the press adopted disparaging rhetoric 
toward Muslims, and far-right parties gained ground. 
European societies and politics have shifted toward racism. 
Denmark has been no exception to this," he commented. 
 
Examining the complexities of the issue, Yeni Safak 
columnist Kursat Bumin wrote that it would be unnecessary to 
wait for an apology from Danish government.  "Many people in 
Islamic countries are protesting against the cartoons by 
burning Danish diplomatic facilities.  Can we really say 
that the Danish government is being punished by this type of 
action?  Why should the government be held responsible for 
an irresponsible act of the media?  Similarly, the fact that 
the British media decided not to print the cartoons was not 
a decision made at the recommendation of the British 
government," the columnist asserted. 
 
Investigation of Priest's Killing in Turkey 
All papers:  Turkey intensified its efforts to find the 
murderer of a Catholic priest in Trabzon.  Police 
distributed the drawings of the suspect widely.  It is not 
clear yet whether the shooting is linked to the publishing 
of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.   Foreign Minister Gul 
said yesterday that he thinksthe two incidents are not 
linked and it was etirely an individual act.  However, 
while expressing sadness over the killing, PM Erdogan 
suggested there could be a link.  Responding to press 
questions after a meeting of the Council of Ministers, 
 
ANKARA 00000527  002 OF 002 
 
 
government spokesman and Justice Minister Cicek was quoted 
as saying "we don't approve of the exercise of freedom of 
expression in an irresponsible way but nor do we approve of 
violent reactions against the cartoons offending Islam. 
These violent reactions do not comply with Islam because 
Islam stands for peace."  Minister Cicek urged the Turkish 
people to remain calm and called on international 
organizations to meet their responsibilities in ending this 
tension. 
 
Iran: Tehran Remarks/Rumsfeld Remarks 
Cumhuriyet, Milliyet:  Tehran announced on Monday after Iran 
was reported by the UN's nuclear watch dog to the UN 
Security Council that his country does not foresee entering 
into nuclear negotiations with the US.  In an interview with 
the German financial newspaper Handelsblatt, Rumsfeld said 
that the US does not rule out using military force against 
Iran; all options, including military ones, are on the 
table. 
 
Diyarbakir Mayor Baydemir's Visit to the US 
In Radikal, veteran columnist Hakki Devrim criticized press 
reporting on the visit of the mayor of Diyarbakir to the US, 
calling it unprofessional journalism and sensationalistic. 
Meanwhile, television reports Mayor Baydemir's statement to 
press in Washington that his visit was not sponsored by the 
US Government and that he did not travel to the US to 
express any complaints about Turkey but rather to express 
his views on the Kurdish issue. 
 
 
TV Highlights: 
 
In the case of the murder of a Catholic priest in Trabzon, a 
16-year old boy was taken for interrogation. 
 
In the midst of ongoing debate, Prime Minister Erdogan has 
decided to disclose his and Mrs. Erdogan's assets.   The 
information was placed on the Prime Ministry's web site. 
 
Diyarbakir Mayor Baydemir says he is in the US to express 
his views on Kurdish issue.
