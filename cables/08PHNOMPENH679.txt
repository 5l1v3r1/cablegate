Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOSEPH A. MUSSOMELI FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY: Ambassador August 15 delivered Ref A 
demarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong, noting ongoing 
concerns about the troop presence in the vicinity of Preah 
Vihear temple and the need to continue to exercise restraint. 
 Saying the U.S. did not support one side over the other, and 
noting recent reports of planned troop withdrawals as well as 
the scheduled August 18-19 bilateral FornMin talks in 
Thailand, the Ambassador emphasized that we support 
diplomatic efforts by both sides to resolve the border issues 
through bilateral channels, if at all feasible.  Hor Namhong 
emphasized the need to remove all troops.  He complained of a 
second Thai incursion that would have to be addressed in the 
August 18-19 bilateral talks with Thailand.  He did not rule 
out UNSC consideration.  Ambassador, echoing the Secretary, 
noted that UNSC consideration would be premature at this 
time, while not ruling it out altogether.  Embassy learned 
that most troops should be withdrawn by 1600 on August 16. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Ambassador August 15 delivered Ref A demarche to 
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hor Namhong, 
noting ongoing concerns about the troop presence in the 
vicinity of Preah Vihear temple and the need to continue to 
exercise restraint.  Ambassador noted an identical demarche 
was being delivered in Bangkok.  Saying the U.S. did not 
support one side over the other, and noting recent reports of 
planned troop withdrawals as well as the scheduled August 
18-19 bilateral FornMin talks in Thailand, the Ambassador 
emphasized that we support diplomatic efforts by both sides 
to resolve the border issues through bilateral channels, if 
at all feasible. 
 
Better to Remove All Troops 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  FM Hor Namhong confirmed that Cambodia and Thailand 
had agreed to withdraw all troops in the vicinity of the Keo 
Sikha Kiri Svara Pagoda (NOTE: sitting below Preah Vihear in 
disputed territory), except for ten soldiers each inside that 
pagoda's walls and another 20 each in the area around the 
pagoda.  He agreed that troops facing off against each other 
on disputed territory could lead to unexpected consequences: 
"With a stand-off like that, we don't know what could 
happen," he said.  He noted, however, that in a July 28 
meeting with Thai Foreign Minister Tej Bunnag, they had 
decided in principle to remove "all" troops from the area 
around Preah Vihear, but conceded that Cambodian Minister of 
Defense Secretary of State Gen. Neang Phat had made the 
agreement for removal of troops on the ground in meetings 
with Thai military counterparts on Aug. 12-13. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Remarking on the positive bilateral step to remove 
troops, the Ambassador agreed that it would be best if all 
troops were withdrawn from the disputed territory, but 
emphasized the significance of reaching bilateral agreement. 
If the issues could not be resolved at the bilateral level, 
then we would support Cambodia working within the ASEAN 
context, he said. 
 
A New Problem:  Ta Moan Temple 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (C)  Hor Namhong expressed the RGC's desire to reach 
bilateral understanding on the Preah Vihear temple area.  He 
said he would also be forced to raise a "new problem" on the 
border at the Prasart Ta Moan area 150 kilometers to the west 
of Preah Vihear, where Thai troops had dramatically increased 
their presence and entered on new territory in another 
overlapping border area.  The Thai soldiers also constructed 
a fence and other structures on the disputed territory. 
Citing an August 14 letter to Thai Foreign Minister Tej 
Bunnag, he said the area was clearly within the territory of 
Cambodia, and he was now clarifying the situation with his 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000679  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Thai counterpart. "Like it or not, we must resolve this 
issue," during the August 18-19 talks, he said. 
 
¶6.  (C)  Hor Namhong passed a copy of the letter which Post 
is transmitting to EAP/MLS.  The claim to territory is based 
on 1908 minutes of the Commission for the Delimitation of 
Frontiers Between Indochina and Siam, referring to the "Route 
named Prasart Tamone."  Citing good neighborliness and the 
ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation the letter requests 
that Thailand: (1) remove the fence and new structures; (2) 
withdraw Thai troops from the area and pull down a military 
camp at the temple; and (3) return the temple complex area to 
the status quo ante "before being occupied by the Thai armed 
forces." 
 
Diplomatic Commitment; Talk of UN 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C)  On the August 18-19 talks in Hua Hin, Hor Namhong 
said that he would propose that the Joint Border Commission 
(JBC) be tasked with handling border discussions and that 
this be supplemented with legal experts' meetings.  In the 
August 14 letter he also refers to "jurists from both sides" 
attempting to find a solution to the problem.  Embassy 
understands from MOD sources that military leaders from both 
sides will participate in the Hua Hin talks to further 
elaborate on planned troop withdrawals.  Minister of Defense 
Tea Bahn and MOD Secretary of State Neang Phat are part of 
the Cambodian delegation. 
 
¶8.  (C/NF)  Hor Namhong said that negotiations would probably 
take "days and days" but that Cambodia was willing to "talk 
and talk and talk" to reach a resolution.  Turning to the 
first bilateral FornMin talks on July 28, Hor Namhong averred 
that the prospect of UN Security Council consideration of the 
issue had "pushed (Thai PM) Samak into asking for the meeting 
between foreign ministers."  Ambassador repeated that the 
U.S. believes it premature for the UN Security Council to 
consider this issue at this time and that resolving the 
border dispute bilaterally or with ASEAN would be better for 
both sides.  A bilateral solution would be one that both 
sides could live with for generations to come.  Hor Namhong 
noted that UNSC consideration could not be entirely ruled 
out, but held out great hopes for the border dispute to 
proceed on a bilateral track. 
 
Troops Moving on August 16 
--------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (C)  MOD Secretary of State Gen. Neang Phat told A/DATT 
August 15 that he had negotiated the troop removals from the 
Keo Sikha Kiri Svara Pagoda and that Cambodia would soon move 
its troops back to their barracks.  The draw-down to ten 
troops for each side in the temple and 20 on the perimeter 
would commence at 1600 hours on August 16.  Neang Phat added 
the withdrawals were in preparation for the talks the 
following Monday.  RCAF Deputy Commander in Chief Gen Pol 
Saroeun told A/DATT mid-day that there may be some troop 
withdrawals from the Ta Moan area, as well. 
 
Comment: 
------- 
 
¶10.  (C)  We are heartened by indicators of positive progress 
made over the past few days, which suggests the two sides are 
close to removing most of the troops.  The position that all 
troops should be removed and that the border area be returned 
to the status quo ante before July 15 remains the most 
responsible approach to achieving a bilateral diplomatic 
solution.  However, until all troops are actually 
re-deployed, the situation could easily deteriorate to the 
tense stand-offs seen just after armed Thai military might 
entered onto land long occupied by Cambodia.
