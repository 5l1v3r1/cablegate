  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  COPENHAGEN CLIMATE CONFERENCE 
 
a.  "In Copenhagen, a Chinese official is refused entry three 
times" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/10)(pg 16): "For the past two days, 
Chinese delegates at the Copenhagen climate conference have directly 
criticized the United States, Europe and Japan.  Su Wei, the chief 
negotiator for the Chinese delegation, said that developed 
countries, given their 200 years of industrialization, should be 
accountable for today's climate changes.  A secret 'Denmark deal' 
has been reached, irritating developing countries and throwing the 
conference into chaos.  The disputes between the two camps 
(developing countries vs. developed countries) have intensified. 
Developing countries believe the Denmark deal is a betrayal, 
depriving them of their right to fairly participate in the climate 
change issue.  According to Australian media, the Secretariat of the 
conference and the government of Denmark have both denied the 
existence of such a deal.  A Chinese expert said that, in the 
interest of all mankind, developed countries should be sincere and 
think clearly about what they want instead of playing tricks." 
 
b.  "Europe uses environmental protection as a diplomatic trump 
card" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/10)(pg 7): "The Europeans seem to always 
stand on their 'holy altar' whenever environmental protection or 
climate change issues are discussed.  A Chinese expert said that if 
the EU would 'wear a green mask' it could retain its leadership and 
benefit from the rest of the world's dependence on its technological 
advantages.  The expert noted, however, that since the current 
climate situation is the result of European countries' 
industrialization over the past 200 years, the Europeans should not 
use environmental protection as a stick to swing at other countries. 
 Wu Yikang, the Director of the Shanghai European Studies Center, 
argued that Europe feels its voice in global politics is weakening. 
Without the United States' support, very few would want to hear what 
Europe has to say about global issues.  Europe is trying to compete 
against the United States with regards to soft power, while at the 
same time containing the development of China, India and other 
developing countries.  Jin Canrong, the Deputy Dean of the School of 
International Studies at Renmin University, said that, in the face 
of European pressure, China and other developing countries still in 
the process of industrialization feel very uneasy.  China should not 
be expected to achieve economic growth and environmental goals all 
in one go." 
 
¶2.  OBAMA'S NOBEL PRIZE 
 
"Obama goes to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in embarrassment" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/10)(pg 1): "Obama's newly-outlined plan to 
increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan has provided the 
media with a chance to mock his receiving of the Nobel Peace Prize. 
The Nobel Committee argued that Obama is bringing hope to the world; 
however, there has not been any breakthrough on peace in Afghanistan 
nor a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons held by the United 
States and Russia.  It is also very strange that all the judges on 
the Nobel Committee have recently disappeared from public view. 
Almost all media have sarcastically noted that a president of war is 
receiving the award of peace.  An AFP journalist said that Obama's 
speech in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize will be the most 
challenging of his political career, since he will need to convince 
the world in just a few minutes that the U.S. war in Afghanistan is 
just.  American media worry that Obama's speech will not be enough 
to stem global criticism and speculation." 
 
¶3.  AFGHANISTAN 
 
"What can China do in Afghanistan?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(12/10)(pg 10): 
"Currently, based on China's diplomatic principles, it is impossible 
for China to send troops to Afghanistan.  However, to a certain 
extent, helping the U.S. in Afghanistan is in China's interest. 
First of all, the situation in Afghanistan is closely related to 
China's national security.  Second, China has large economic 
interests in Afghanistan.  Third, Afghanistan is growing in 
strategic importance.  Therefore, China should help Afghanistan, but 
in a different way than Europe and the United States.  China should

focus on providing economic opportunities for and raising the living 
standards of the Afghan people; cultivating China-Afghanistan 
friendship; and supporting the Karzai government in its efforts to 
promote reconciliation among the country's various parties."
