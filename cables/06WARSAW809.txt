SUBJECT: FM MELLER SUBMITS RESIGNATION 
 
REF: WARSAW 799 
 
¶1.  Widely anticipated, Polish Foreign Minister Stefan Meller 
submitted his resignation on April 28.  Meller said at a 
press conference that he does not believe that the proposed 
coalition between the governing Law and Justice party, Self 
Defense and a break away group from the League of Polish 
Families is in Poland's best interests.  Prime Minister 
Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz has not yet acted on Meller's 
resignation.  Meller's successor, the subject of press 
speculation in the last several weeks, will likely be named 
at the end of this week when the government announces a wider 
reshuffling of jobs as part of the new coalition. 
 
¶2.  Meller, a professional diplomat, was never an insider in 
the Kaczynski government.  His resignation was expected, and 
delayed primarily because no suitable replacement emerged. 
Meller however did express his willingness to remain involved 
in foreign policy.  President Kaczynski may ask him to help 
coordinate a proposed Polish-Russian summit later this year 
with Russian President Putin.  Immediately preceding his 
appointment as Foreign Minister six months ago, Meller was 
Poland's ambassador to Moscow. 
 
¶3.  President Kaczynski's tight circle of advisors ceded 
little authority to Meller, who was frustrated by MFA being 
sidelined on foreign policy issues.  We do not expect any 
radical change with Meller's successor, once named, although 
note that MFA's role would likely expand if a close political 
ally of the Kaczynski's comes in to the job.
