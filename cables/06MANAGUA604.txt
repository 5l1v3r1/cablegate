SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN VIEWS ON RECENT INTERNATIONAL WHALING 
COMMISSION MEETING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 
 
REF: MANAGUA 0045 
 
¶1. (SBU) As noted in REFTEL, Miguel Marenco, Director General 
of the Nicaraguan Fisheries Agency (ADPESCA) candidly 
acknowledged to ECONOFF that his country maintains a quid pro 
quo arrangement in which Nicaragua supports Japanese whaling 
positions in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and 
Japan contributes generously to the GON.  Marenco recently 
returned from an IWC meeting in the United Kingdom and has 
expanded on his country's views on the whaling issue, the 
IWC, and positions taken by various countries.  He lamented 
the position of nations such as Australia, New Zealand, 
Argentina, the UK, and Brazil, saying that they "are against 
any lethal whaling and only accept whale watching."  He 
referred to the Japanese position as being "flexible" and 
"science based." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Of the U.S., Marenco said that U.S. Commissioner 
Bill Hobbarth "expressed a very mature position and looked 
very interested in making strong efforts to save the 
Commission and bring a consensus decision.  I believe that he 
will be a good candidate to be elected as IWC chair in June. 
If this happens, Nicaragua will support him fully."  Marenco 
believes that "intractable" positions taken by several IWC 
member countries threaten the very existance of the IWC.  He 
said, "We believe this (the U.S. consensus proposal) is the 
last chance to save the IWC, if not this year then by next 
year's meeting in Anchorage."  Comment: Given the close 
relationship between Japan and the GON (especially ADPESCA), 
Marenco's views may well be a clear indication of Japanese 
views on these issues as well.  End Comment.
