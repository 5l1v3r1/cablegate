¶1. Econ Assistant delivered reftel points regarding the 
upcoming International Georgia Reconstruction Donors 
Conference in Brussels to Mr Jaakko Lehtovirta, Georgia 
Desk Officer at the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA).  The MFA is working to determine how much room 
there is in Finland's budget to make a donation for the 
post-war reconstruction and economic recovery of 
Georgia, but no final decision has yet been made on how 
much support will be provided. 
 
¶2.  Lehtovirta also stated that Finland is committed to 
provide support for humanitarian assistance of civilian 
victims of the crisis in Georgia up to the amount of 
EUR 1 million. At this stage the plan is to channel the 
assistance primarily through the international 
Committee of the Red Cross ICRC, the Finnish Red Cross 
and the UN relief agencies (WFP). The overall amount of 
this assistance granted to date by the Finnish 
government stands at EUR 600 000.
