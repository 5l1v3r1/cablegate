SUBJECT:  RUSSIAN DEPUTY PERMREP WILL ATTEND SOMALIA PIRACY MEETING 
 
REF:  A. State 1223; B. State 1225 
(SBU) Post passed reftel information to Russian MFA's North America 
and Legal Departments, and received a response that Deputy Permanent 
Representative to the UN Iliya Rogachev and Russian UN Mission's 
Senior Advisor Gennadiy Kuzmen will represent the Russian government 
at the January 13-14 meetings of the Contact Group on Somalia 
Piracy.  It would appear that the Russian MFA has yet to decide on a 
lead department for the piracy issue.
