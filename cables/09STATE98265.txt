SUBJECT: MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY CLINTON TO NORWEGIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER JONAS STOERE 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  Post is requested to deliver 
the letter in paragraph 2 from Secretary Clinton to FM Stoere 
in response to his September 15 incoming letter. There will be 
no signed original to follow. 
 
¶2. Begin text: 
 
Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
Thank you for your letter of September 15 inviting the United States 
to attend a meeting of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) in New 
York on September 22.  The United States will be represented by 
an interagency team of experts at the working-level, 
including representatives from the Department of State, Department 
of the Treasury, and USAID, who are well-placed to engage in 
substantive discussions about the Palestinian economy. 
 
As you and Special Envoy Mitchell discussed on September 10, we 
believe that a ministerial-level meeting of the AHLC could be 
effective in the context of a resumption of negotiations to ensure 
proper donor coordination in support of Palestinian institutions 
and economic development.  We will work closely with you following 
the UN General Assembly to determine the appropriate time and venue 
for such a meeting. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
 
Hillary Rodham Clinton
