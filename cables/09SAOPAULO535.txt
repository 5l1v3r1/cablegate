"Subsidized cotton" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (9-5) comments on Brazil's 
victory at the WTO on the cotton dispute, on protectionism and on 
the multilateral trade system: "....Once more U.S. authorities 
showed, in practice, their lack of appreciation for the multilateral 
trade system.....In a scenario in which the major global power puts 
itself in a position of making as difficult as possible any movement 
from 'rivals,' it is hard to expect great progresses in this global 
negotiations [Doha Round Trade Talks], which has been going on for 
the last 8 years."
