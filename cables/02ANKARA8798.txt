BRIEFING 
 
 
U/S Grossman and DepSecDef.Wolfowitz visit: "Hurriyet" gives 
front-page coverage to the Grossman-Wolfowitz visit.  The 
story reports that the US had earlier conveyed a list of 
requests from Turkey for a possible operation in Iraq 
through a letter to the Turkish Ambassador in Washington. 
The letter reportedly included a request for 35,000 Turkish 
troops to be held in reserve for possible intervention in 
Northern Iraq, the use of Turkish air bases, the use of 
Turkish territory for US ground troops, and the use of 
several ports.   The letter also reportedly included a 
December 8 deadline for response, and Grossman and Wolfowitz 
will attempt to learn Ankara's initial reaction today. 
Papers listed the predominant issues for the visit as Iraq, 
the EU, and Cyprus. 
 
 
Erdogan to Parliament: Turkey's Supreme Election Board (YSK) 
ruled on Monday that the elections in the southeastern city 
of Siirt will be canceled.  The decision came after the AKP 
applied to the YSK to cancel the elections in Siirt because 
of irregularities in three ballot boxes.  According to YSK 
procedures, the elections in Siirt will be repeated 60 days 
following the cancellation decision, i.e. in February 2003. 
All papers highlight this development as the opportunity for 
AKP leader Erdogan to be elected to parliament. 
 
 
Cyprus:  Papers note the increasing number of diplomatic 
visitors, and comment that the pressure on the Cyprus issue 
is mounting.  Greek FM Papandreou reportedly changed his 
program to come to Ankara a day early in order to meet U/S 
Grossman to discuss the Cyprus issue.  The visits of UN 
Representative De Soto, the Danish Foreign Minister, and 
British FM Straw are portrayed as efforts to `increase 
pressure on the Cyprus issue prior to the EU summit.' 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Grossman and Wolfowitz visit 
 
 
"Cards Uncovered on Iraq" 
Chief columnist of mass appeal Hurriyet, Oktay Eksi wrote 
(12/3): "It seems that the US has finally expressed its 
demands and expectations from Turkey on the Iraq issue and 
presented them formally to the Turkish side.  . All of the 
reported demands obviously serve US interests both in the 
short and long term.  They require, however, careful 
evaluation by Turkey based on Turkish interests. . Let's not 
forget the fact that once the Iraq operation takes place, 
the US will leave the region.  It will be Turkey that will 
be faced with the reality of Iraq as its immediate neighbor. 
This reality alone invalidates the possibility of `Turkish 
soldiers in combat against Iraq.'  After all, why do we have 
to get involved in the US operation against Iraq?  Clearly 
this is going to happen largely because of US oil 
interests."
