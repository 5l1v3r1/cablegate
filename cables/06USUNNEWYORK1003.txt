 ¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. United Nations Department of Political 
Affairs (DPA) Assistant-Secretary-General (A/SYG) Kalomoh 
urged Security Council Members at May 15 consultations to 
intensify their contacts, especially within the Contact Group 
and the Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs), on the 
different Mogadishu factions in response to the recent 
violence there.  Kalomoh blamed the emergence of Sharia Court 
militias on foreign assistance and stressed the need to 
prevent the ascendancy of such groups with 'Islamist 
ideology.'  The Intergovernmental Authority on Development 
(IGAD) had a role to play, Kalomoh asserted, as would the 
Baidoa leadership were it to finally unite.  In their 
interventions Members drew a link between the recent violence 
and violations of the arms embargo, calling for it to be 
respected and implemented.  China, which normally holds the 
pen on UN documents regarding Somalia, ceded drafting 
responsibilities for the resultant Press Statement (text in 
Paragraph 6) to Qatar as Chair of the Somalia Sanctions 
Committee.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) At May 15 UNSC consultations, DPA A/SYG Kalomoh 
warned the Council that recent intense fighting in Mogadishu 
between elements of the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace 
and Counter Terrorism and those representing the Sharia 
Courts could worsen and threaten the TFIs, which were the 
only source of law and order in the capital. Kalomoh 
recounted the conclusions of the Somalia Contact Group in its 
May 9 meeting with Special Representative of the SYG (SRSG) 
Fall, including the need to bridge the gap between Mogadishu 
and Baidoa groups (on which both the international community 
and Somali clan Elders could be instrumental), the need to 
strengthen the National Security and Stabilization Plan and 
the need to strike a balance between the fight against 
terrorism and the pacification of Mogadishu.  More than 
anything, Kalomoh declared, 'quiet diplomacy' and engagement 
with all factions were the priorities. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In addition to these steps, Kalomoh said, a 
ceasefire must be formalized and upheld.  Kalomoh worried 
about the effect that the emergence of Sharia Court militias 
could have on Somali stability, as it would cause the 
conflict to degenerate into an ideological and cultural one. 
Kalomoh blamed the prominence of these militias on their 
foreign support.  He asserted that IGAD and an eventual 
consolidated Baidoa leadership would be important in 
combating the ascendancy of these Islamist elements. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In their interventions, Members drew a link between 
the recent violence and violations of the arms embargo, 
calling for it to be respected and implemented.  China, 
Japan, Greece, Russia, Congo and Ghana all called loudly for 
a strengthening and an enforcing of the arms embargo, with 
Ghanaian Permanent Representative Effah-Apenteng adding that 
those parties providing 'clandestine support' to violators 
should desist from such activities.  Russia seconded a call 
from the UK on imposing targeted sanctions on individuals in 
order to control the situation.  Qatar, as Chair of the 
Somalia Sanctions Committee, promised to accelerate the 
Committee's work in response to the current violence.  No 
direct mention was made of a possible waiver of the arms 
embargo to accommodate an IGAD or African Union (AU) peace 
support operation.  Members mentioned that these types of 
regional organizations (the AU, IGAD, the Arab League and the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference) had a role to play in 
reconciliation and looked forward to the upcoming IGAD Summit 
in Nairobi addressing the issue. 
 
¶5. (SBU) China and Denmark made explicit calls for dialogue 
between the parties, and Tanzania noted that the 'new fight' 
in Mogadishu involved terrorist elements.  Ambassador Bolton 
drew the Council's attention to the effects of the recent 
fighting on the distribution of humanitarian assistance in 
and around Mogadishu.  Qatar drafted a Press Statement to be 
read out by the SC President; the text includes our 
amendments and was issued May 16.
