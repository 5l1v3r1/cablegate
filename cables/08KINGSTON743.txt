1.(U) Per ref (A), Ambassador informed the Government of Jamaica 
(GoJ)'s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, Dr. Kenneth 
Baugh, of the U.S. designations under E.O. 13382, and delivered 
non-paper, in the course of a private meeting on August 22. 
 
2.(SBU) Baugh remarked that he recently had visited Tehran for the 
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)'s Meeting of Foreign Ministers (ref B), 
at which some 118 member states had been represented.  He then said 
that the NAM respected the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
and that Iran would have to comply with its findings.  He also noted 
that Iran had proposed a nuclear weapons free zone (NWFZ) for the 
entire region, providing Israel were included.
