REFTEL: USDOC 00749 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Energocascad, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on 
BIS license application D370399 as the ultimate 
consignee of eclipse model E75FL pumps. These items 
are controlled for chemical or biological warfare 
reasons under ECCN 2B350. The licensee is Pulsafeeder, 
Inc., a unit of IDEX Co, 2883 Brighton-Henrietta Town 
Line Rd, Rochester, NY 14623. 
 
¶3. On February 6, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of 
Energocascad, nab. Akademika Tupoleva 15/5, Moscow, 
Russia. The export control team met with Lyudmila 
Suleimanova, Head of Purchasing Department. 
 
¶4. Energocascad is a contractor specializing in the 
design, construction and service of chemical-water 
purification systems and thermal energy/heating 
stations.  The company employs 600 at its Moscow 
headquarters and a Research and Development facility 
in Tula.  Energocascad only works on projects located 
in Russia. 
¶5. Energocascad is not the ultimate end user of the 
commodities in reftel.  Energocascad will utilize the 
commodities in the construction of a wastewater 
purification system at the Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical 
Plant located in Nizhny Tagil, Russia.  Ms. 
Suleimanova described the end user as a large 
metallurgical plant and works.  The commodities will 
be transferred to the plant and installed in the 
wastewater purification plant.  Prior to installation 
on site, the equipment in reftel will be stored a 
warehouse rented by Energocascad in Elektrostal, an 
industrial center located in a town just north of 
Moscow.  The equipment will be moved to the worksite 
by truck.  It is expected that upon Customs clearance, 
it will take approximately one week to get the 
commodities from Elektrostal to Nizhny Tagil.  Once 
installed, security will be the responsibility of the 
plant. 
¶6. According to the company website, The Nizhny Tagil 
Metallurgical Plant (Russian acronym NTMK) is a group 
of industrial enterprises comprising of metals mining, 
processing and rolling operations. The corporation is
