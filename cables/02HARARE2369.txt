SUBJECT:  GOVERNMENT MINISTER SAYS LAND REDISTRIBUTION 
IS ONLY FOR RULING PARTY MEMBERS HARARE 
 
 
  ¶1.   According to an article in the pro-government 
      "Daily Mirror, Minister for Youth, Gender and 
      Employment Creation Elliot Manyika has threatened to 
      "repossess land allocated to people who do not support 
      the ruling party." 
 
  ¶2.   A report in the October 28 edition of the "Daily 
      Mirror," under headline "Fast-track land is for ZANU PF 
      members only, says Manyika: Party Machinery to weed out 
      enemies of Third Chimurenga," quotes Manyika as saying: 
 
  ¶3.   ". . .I am going to visit each and every farming 
      community in the country that benefited under 
      the fast track program to set up ZANU PF 
      structures.  If you were allocated land by this 
      government then you must be a member of the 
      party. . .   If you're MDC then what are you 
      doing in a program for `scavengers' or of a 
      peasant farming community who are like 
      mushrooms. . .?  This program has seen the 
      determination of our president and the country 
      in general resulting in some sanctions being 
      imposed on individuals, se we won't let our 
      enemies benefit from it. . ."
