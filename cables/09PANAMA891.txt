CLASSIFIED BY: Debra L. Hevia, Political Counselor, State, POL; 
REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary/Introduction: The Ambassador and DCM spent six hours 
in meetings with top government officials on November 25 to work 
through a number of specific security issues, as well as to agree 
on a structure for better coordination on security issues.  End 
summary/ introduction. 
 
 
 
The U.S. Is Panama's Partner 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador and DCM met first with Vice President/Foreign 
Minister Juan Carlos Varela and Minister of the Presidency Demetrio 
"Jimmy" Papadimitriu, after which they all joined President Ricardo 
Martinelli for lunch.  The Ambassador turned to the top concern of 
Panamanian citizens: security, noting that the Embassy's top 
priority in Panama is security, and that violence threatens 
long-term governance and prosperity.  She assured the GOP that the 
Embassy would strongly support both aggressive efforts against 
traffickers and robust programs to keep youth out of gangs. 
However, she expressed concern that many initiatives have been 
stalled due to divisions within the government or a lack of 
internal coordination, and in the case of the Council for Public 
Security and National Defense (Consejo), leadership that has worked 
directly counter to our bilateral information-sharing programs (ref 
A). 
 
 
 
¶3. (C) The Ambassador detailed the many programs the USG provides 
to assist Panama on security issues, including NAS assistance, 
Coast Guard and Navy patrols, Southcom humanitarian and development 
projects, gang-prevention initiatives, and 30 U.S. federal law 
enforcement agents working side-by-side with Panamanian 
counterparts.  The Ambassador underscored that Panama does not need 
to search for a partner on security issues; it already has one. 
 
 
 
GOP: No Plan or Leadership on Security 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (C) Papadimitriu acknowledged the lack of GOP coordination, 
saying that there is no consensus about security and no plan to 
address it.  He said the Ministry of Government and Justice (MOGJ) 
was too unwieldy, and that Minister Jose Raul Mulino did not have 
the full support and confidence of the government, but no one else 
wanted the job.  Papadimitriu added, "We don't have anyone who 
wakes up thinking about security in the way you do.  No one feels 
accountable or responsible."  Martinelli ridiculed Mulino, saying 
that at Cabinet meetings he often talks for 20 minutes nonstop, 
with an attitude that he knows more than everyone else because he 
served in government previously, causing the other ministers to 
stop listening and start working on their blackberries. 
 
 
 
¶5. (C) The Ambassador asked who the GOP was considering naming as 
the new minister of security, and Martinelli admitted he had not 
thought about it, but it would not be Mulino.  He said Director of 
the Panamanian National Police Gustavo Perez wanted to remain in 
his job, and Martinelli was happy to leave him there.  The 
Ambassador and DCM urged Martinelli to choose a strong manager, who 
did not necessarily have to be a security expert. 
 
 
Joint Task Force/Maritime Bases 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) The Ambassador detailed how our efforts to help the GOP 
stand up a small maritime task force that could operate off the 
Darien's Pacific coast using existing Panamanian security resources 
had spiraled into a vitriolic public debate about U.S. involvement 
in "maritime bases" (ref B).  Papadimitriu was dismayed, and asked 
for a paper detailing the operation that the President could sign 
off on as a direct order to Mulino and the service chiefs. (Note: 
DCM provided a NAS-drafted paper the same afternoon, which 
Martinelli signed.)  Papadimitriu had not paid close attention to 
the bases controversy but nor was he alarmed, as his internal 
polling showed most Panamanians were not greatly concerned about 
the bases.  He agreed with the Ambassador and DCM that the GOP 
needed to have a credible spokesperson on security issues, and 
coordinate its messaging both internally and (where appropriate) 
with the Embassy. 
 
 
 
Global CST and Israeli Involvement 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) The Ambassador expressed concerns about the proposals made 
by Israeli security company Global CST, citing negative experiences 
in Colombia and the difficulty of working with Israeli presence in 
GOP ministries (ref C and D).  Varela said the GOP could solve its 
own problems without relying on contractors.  Papadimitriu 
expressed surprise at the reports from Colombia, as he believed CST 
had been hired with Plan Colombia funds with the USG's blessing. 
He said he did not want to do anything to harm Panama's 
relationship with the U.S. and would ask CST president Ziv to stand 
down, though he later admitted it would be difficult since CST had 
spent its own money sending a large team to Panama to complete a 
survey.  In particular, Papadimitriu was receptive to the argument 
that Panama did not need to buy expensive coastal radars or other 
hardware recommended by CST.  However, he liked CST's ideas about 
creating a ministry of security and reorganizing the GOP security 
structure, as well as their suggestion to recruit management talent 
from the private sector.  To sum up, Papadimitriu said he was 
shocked by the conversation, and would not let Israeli influence 
damage the U.S.-Panama relationship.  Martinelli was similarly 
taken aback, and emphasized that he did not want to endanger 
relations with the USG, saying "We don't want to change friends." 
He said he would call Colombian President Uribe to get the straight 
scoop on CST. 
 
 
 
Matador Judicialized Wiretap Program 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶8. (C) Martinelli asked for additional wiretap assistance, saying 
the GOP needed to catch ordinary criminals in addition to drug 
trafficking organizations.  The Ambassador and DCM suggested that 
our judicialized wiretap program could be expanded, but it must 
still be moved out from under the control of Consejo to preserve 
the judicial quality of the evidence collected.  Given the 
President's opposition to putting it under the control of the 
Attorney General, the Ambassador referred to the agreement VP/FM 
Varela had worked out to move the Matador program under Panamanian 
National Police Director Gustavo Perez.  Martinelli confirmed his 
agreement with that plan. 
 
 
Moving Forward 
 
------------------- 
 
¶9. (C) The GOP and Embassy agreed to continue this on-going 
dialogue through a bi-weekly security meeting including Varela, 
Papadimitriu, and Mulino on one side and the Ambassador, DCM, and 
political-security officer on the other.  Martinelli said that he, 
Varela, and Papadimitriu were the "circle zero" of the GOP, and 
that no important decisions were taken unless the three of them had 
discussed it and agreed on a course of action. 
 
 
 
Bio notes 
 
----------- 
 
¶10. (C) In general, Martinelli seemed more relaxed overall and less 
aggressive than we have seen him in previous meetings.  His general 
tone was respectful and positive, in contrast with his previous 
argumentative, drive-a-hard-bargain manner. 
 
 
 
¶11. (C) Regarding the recent arrest of his cousin Ramon Martinelli 
in Mexico on money laundering charges, Martinelli said he was 
satisfied.  If the Mexicans had not arrested him, the GOP had plans 
to arrest him.  He said Ramon had always been a "black sheep" and 
was sullying the good Martinelli family name.
