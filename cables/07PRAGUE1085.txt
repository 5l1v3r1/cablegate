Â¶1. (SBU) Embassy political officer spoke with Czech desk 
officers for Syria and Lebanon regarding the Special Tribunal 
for Lebanon to try those responsible for the assassination of 
former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.  These Czech officials 
indicated that the EU is generally supportive of this 
tribunal.  The Czech government has not made any decision on

officials noted that the EU will continue to put pressure on 
Syria to fully cooperate with the tribunal.
