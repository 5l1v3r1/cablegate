REF: SECSTATE 97393 
 
¶1. (U)  This is an action request.  Please see para 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 17, Ecouns talked to Ambassador Jassim 
Al-Mubaraki, the Director of the MFA's Arab World Department. 
Mubaraki confirmed that the GOK had received an invitation from 
Norway to attend the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) meeting in New 
York on September 22, though he noted that the GoK had received the 
invitation "rather late" and he would not be able to attend, 
himself.  Mubaraki told Ecouns that he had already forwarded the 
information and supporting documents to the Foreign Minister's 
people in Washington, and that he hoped either the FM would attend 
or designate someone to attend the meeting.  As the Foreign Minister 
was already scheduled to be in New York, Mubaraki stated his belief 
that he would attend the meeting.  The information that Secretary 
Rice would be heading the U.S. delegation was an added positive 
factor in this regard.  He promised to try and call the Foreign 
Minister to pass on USG interest. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ecouns briefed Mubaraki on US goals for the AHLC, thanked 
him for Kuwait's recent donation of $80 million and urged the GoK to 
consider shifting the remainder of its $300 million in development 
assistance to budget assistance.  Mubaraki stressed the GoK's 
interest in supporting the Palestinian people and the Palestinian 
Authority.  With regard to the $300 million, he stated that the GoK 
believed that it would be best used for development projects to 
directly improve the lives of the Palestinian people.  That said, he 
noted the GoK was flexible and if the USG and others were convinced 
that budget support was a more important and urgent priority, they 
should make the argument to the Foreign Minister.  If he was 
convinced, he could then take it up with the Prime Minister and the 
Amir.  Mubaraki suggested that Secretary Rice raise the issue with 
the Foreign Minister personally, while he was in Washington. 
Mubaraki did say that, since the GoK had Parliamentary approval for 
the $300 million Paris Donors pledge, he did not think that 
reprogramming it for budget support would require National Assembly 
concurrence. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request:  Post suggests that -- at a senior level -- 
Department officials take advantage of the presence of the PM and FM 
in Washington on September 18 and 19 to make the case for 
Palestinian Authority budget support directly to them.  End Action 
Request.
