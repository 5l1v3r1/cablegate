Turkey Carries out Cross-Border Operation in N. Iraq 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶1. Turkey launched air strikes against PKK terrorist positions in 
northern Iraq on December 16, 17, 22 and 26.  Several of the air 
strikes were supported by artillery fire.  During the same period, 
counterterrorism operations within Southeast Turkey and against PKK 
terrorists in several cities continued.  Both civilian and military 
officials made public announcements after each operation about the 
scope and results of the operations.  The apparent harmony between 
civilian and military authorities as reflected in these public 
announcements has not been seen since before the April 27, 2007 
"e-memorandum" issued by the Turkish General Staff warning against a 
Gul presidency. 
 
 
Anti-Terrorism High Council Convenes 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. Anti-Terrorism High Council convened under Deputy Prime Minister 
Cemil Cicek on December 5.  Interior Minister Besir Atalay, Justice 
Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin, Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan, Deputy 
CHOD GEN Ergin Saygun, Jandarma Commander GEN Isik Kosaner attended 
the meeting.  In its statement, the Council discussed recent 
counter-terrorism activities of the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) and 
additional measures to follow.  The Council also discussed the 
difficulties Turkey has experienced in extraditing terrorist 
suspects from foreign countries. 
 
 
Defense Industry Executive Board Convenes 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Turkish Defense Industry Executive Board convened under PM 
Erdogan on December 5 to discuss the needs of Turkish Armed Force. 
The Board decided to: 
 
- disqualify the Israeli IAI for the Gokturk Satellite project and 
to continue talks with Britain's Eads Astrium, Germany's OHB System 
and Italy's Telespazio; 
 
- manufacture Turkey's own 5.56 mm assault rifle and machine gun to 
replace the German made G-3 rifles; 
- award Turkish Aselsan the 47 million Euro contract to set up 
surface and underwater security systems for the Aksaz Naval Base; 
 
- launch negotiations for the manufacture of multi-purpose 
helicopters in Turkey with Sikorsky and Augusta Westland; 
 
- award Turkish Aselsan the 80 million dollar contract for radar 
surveillance systems; 
 
- launch contract negotiations with Norway's Konsberg Company for 
the supply of Penguin guided missiles to be deployed on Seahawk 
helicopters; and 
 
- launch negotiations with Turkish Yonca Onuk Company for a 25-ton 
coast guard boat. 
 
Turkish Troops Hand over ISAF Command 
-------------------------------------

¶4. Turkey concluded its eight-month command of International 
Security and Assistance Force in Afghanistan's (ISAF) Kabul Regional 
Command, turning the command over to Italy on December 12.  A 
welcoming ceremony was held for the 400 troops at the 4th Army Corps 
Command in Ankara.  The Kabul Regional Command was created in summer 
2006 under the joint leadership of Turkey, France and Italy. 
 
National Security Council Convenes 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Turkey's National Security Council (NSC) convened its last 
meeting of 2007 under President Abdullah Gul on December 28.  The 
NSC assessed the results of cross-border operations carried out 
against the PKK in northern Iraq, and reiterated Turkey's 
determination to continue operations.  The Council reviewed 
diplomatic, economic, social and other dimensions of the fight 
against terrorism.  The NSC also discussed recent developments in 
Iraq and other external developments affecting Turkey's security. 
 
Donations to TAF Foundation Up 73% 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Donations to the Turkish Armed Forces Foundation (TAFF) were up 
73% during the Ramadan Holiday in December 2007.  Although many 
other institutions received donations during the Ramadan Holiday 
based on this Muslim tradition, TAFF is the only institution that 
experienced such a dramatic increase this year.  Surprised by the 
considerable increase in donations, Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
increased monthly pension for veterans and families of soldiers 
killed by the PKK.  Recent terror attacks and cross-border 
operations seems to have contributed to the outpouring of support 
for the Turkish military in general and the families of soldiers 
killed by the PKK in particular. 
 
Turkey's Security Relations with Other Countries 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7. China: Chinese Deputy Chief of General Staff GEN Zhang Li visited 
Turkish Land Forces Commander GEN Ilker Basbug and Turkish CHOD GEN 
Yasar Buyukanit on December 10-11, respectively.  No information on 
the purpose of the visit was made public. 
 
¶8. Kazakhstan: Kazakh Defense Minister Danial Akhmetov received his 
Turkish counterpart Vecdi Gonul in Astara on December 14.  The 
ministers discussed prospects for cooperation. 
 
¶9. Greece: TGS reported 24 air interceptions by Greek jets in 
international airspace over the Aegean Sea and one violation of 
airspace in December.  34 incidents of violation of Turkish 
territorial waters in the Aegean were reported in December.  Turkey 
sent a diplomatic note to Athens on December 26 after considerable 
increase in what the TGS considers violations of territorial water 
by Greek fishing boats and Coast Guard vessels. 
 
Defense Industry Activity 
------------------------- 
 
¶10. TAF is planning to announce a tender for the purchase of 
heavy-lift helicopters for the army. Boeing's CH-47 Chinook 
helicopters are reportedly TAF's first preference because of low 
maintenance costs and suitability for Turkey's terrain, according to 
a defense industry expert. 
 
¶11. Turkish Havelsan developed an 'Integrated Command and Control 
System' for Turkish Air Forces.  The system, which is the most 
sophisticated integrated command and control system of the country, 
was delivered in a ceremony held at the Havelsan Headquarters on 
December 30.
