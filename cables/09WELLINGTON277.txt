REF: 09 STATE 77369; 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1.   In response to reftel, PolOff conducted a Blue Lantern post 
shipment check of Garden City helicopters on September 14, 2009. 
This helicopter rescue company is a legitimate business operating 
under contract with the New Zealand government's Accident 
Compensation Corporation, and it has land and sea rescue 
responsibility for the northern half of New Zealand's south island. 
PolOff witnessed a signed contract and a current business license. 
 
 
 
¶2.  Garden City Helicopters is home-based in Christchurch, NZ and 
has been in business for 25 years.  John Currie is its sole 
proprietor, and in addition to his Christchurch headquarters, he 
has flight operations in Greymouth on the west coast and Nelson in 
the northern part of the island.  This company uses night vision 
devices (nvd) primarily for night rescue and medical evacuation 
operations over land.  Management understands the restrictions on 
United States Munitions List items, especially the prohibition 
against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export. 
 
 
 
¶3.  All nvds are kept in a safe within a locked facility when not 
in use, and only pilots and paramedics who are trained to use them 
have access to the safe.  PolOff inspected the Christchurch 
facility and verified that four ITT Model F4949F, Gen III ANVIS 9 
Aviator Night Vision Goggles (serial numbers: 11921, 11923, 25326, 
and 25327) plus associated hardware were present.  Garden City 
Operations Manager, Stuart Farquhar shared digital photographs of 
the Greymouth and Nelson facilities' security systems, and PolOff 
was convinced that security is substantially equivalent at all 
three sites.  Two ITT nvds reside at Greymouth (serial numbers 
21616 and 21617), and Garden City's final four nvds (serial numbers 
21618, 21619, 25328, and 25329) are kept at the Nelson facility.
