on encouraging additional countries to subscribe to the Hague 
Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation 
(HCOC) to MFA Director for Bilateral Affairs Dhafer Al Umran. 
 Al Umran wondered aloud why the other GCC countries and 
Egypt had not signed up for the HCOC, but took note that 
Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman had voted in favor of the 2004 UNGA

position on subscribing to the HCOC, commenting that the HCOC 
is the type of group Bahrain should join.
