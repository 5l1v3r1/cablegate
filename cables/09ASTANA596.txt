SUBJECT:  KAZAKHSTAN:  MEDIA REACTION, MARCH 25-APRIL 1 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: During the week of March 25-April 1, there was no one 
topic that dominated the Kazakhstani media.  Independent weekly 
"Delovaya Nedeleya" ran a lengthy interview with Deputy Defense 
Minister Bulat Sembinov regarding Kazakhstan's participation in 
Afghanistan, and pro-government weekly "Liter" focused on 
discussions of a single world currency at the G-20 summit. 
Opposition websites posted articles on the latest political intrigue 
surrounding President Nazarbayev's ex-son-in-law Rakhat Aliyev and 
ousted BTA bank head Mukhtar Ablyazov.  An article in the 
pro-government press criticized Kazakhstani ministers for failing to 
update their blogs.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER STRESSES SUPPORT FOR AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶2.  The independent weekly "Delovaya Nedeleya" published an 
interview with Deputy Defense Minister Bulat Sembinov upon his 
return from bilateral meetings in the United States.  Sembinov is 
quoted as stating that "mutual understanding on the goals of 
operations in Afghanistan was reached." 
 
¶3.  In the interview, Sembinov said that Afghanistan was a complex 
problem but emphasized that Kazakhstan could only benefit from 
joining these operations in a format "similar to Iraq."  He stressed 
that the United States "highly valued" Kazakhstan's participation in 
Iraq, putting it in the category of the "hard work of trustworthy 
local partners who will not run away in case of danger."  Sembinov 
said that it was important for Kazakhstan to maintain this image of 
its army and "support it with concrete actions" and noted that he 
would like Kazakhstani officers to become part of ISAF staff in 
Afghanistan. 
 
¶4.  Turning to the current situation in Afghanistan, Sembinov said 
media reports were far from reality and underscored that the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s could not be compared to the 
current situation, since coalition forces, comprised of troops from 
40 countries, were in Afghanistan in accordance with a UN Security 
Council mandate and were not "ideologically induced."  Although he 
expressed doubt that the security situation would fundamentally 
improve in the next two to three years, he emphasized the importance 
of Kazakhstan's participation, noting that the situation in 
Afghanistan would have an impact on security and stability 
throughout the region. 
 
¶5.  On the topic of expanded U.S.-Kazakhstani military cooperation, 
Sembinov said that his Russian colleagues "have no fears about it" 
since this was happening within the framework of Kazakhstan's 
multi-vector foreign policy.  He noted that one of Kazakhstan's key 
goals was modernization of its army and said that this was not 
possible "without cooperation with the CSTO and CIS as well as NATO 
and the United States."  The paper quoted Sembinov as stating that 
Kazakhstan's military cooperation with any one country was never 
aimed at a third country and that this was well understood in both 
Russia and the United States. 
 
G-20 SUMMIT:  NO CONSENSUS ON A SINGLE WORLD CURRENCY 
 
¶6.  Pro-government "Liter" reported that participants in the G-20 
had "serious disagreements" about the introduction of a single world 
currency.  The paper cited a Russian plan to implement a single 
world currency, noting that China and Kazakhstan earlier expressed 
this same position.  "Liter" said that Russia was promoting the new 
currency as a political idea, since the dollar represented a 
"one-pole world" for Moscow, but that China's interest was 
pragmatic, since two-thirds of its gold reserves are held in dollars 
and U.S. bonds.  The paper stated that Kazakhstan had taken on the 
role of a "theorist" by outlining the disadvantages of a dollar 
system that caused "crises and economic convulsions" and underscored 
the need to replace the dollar with another currency that would be 
controlled by an independent body.  (NOTE:  President Nazarbayev 
himself has been publicly advocating for a single world currency for 
several months.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶7.  "Liter" acknowledged that President Obama did not see a need for 
 
ASTANA 00000596  002 OF 003 
 
 
world currency and said the United States was not the only country 
to resist "changing horses mid-stream."  The paper noted that 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the G-20 would not pay much 
attention to a world currency and instead suggested creating a 
global insurance program that would allow countries to put forth 
claims if their currency experienced problems.  "Except for the 
United States," wrote "Liter," "there is no other country to bring 
claims against." 
 
¶8.  The paper reported that the U.S. dollar was a prestigious 
symbol, stating that it was "very easy to get around if you have an 
American Express card in your pocket."  "Liter" opined that in order 
to preserve the dollar, the United States would have to reject the 
temptation to start issuing money any time it feels like it and also 
resolve its debts.  "Otherwise," the paper warned, "default will hit 
the United States as well as other countries." 
 
OPPOSITION PRESS SPECULATES ON PROSECUTIONS IN ABLYAZOV CASE 
 
¶9.  Opposition website "respulika.kz" published an article 
suggesting that "clouds are gathering" over the relatives, 
associates, and business partners of Mukhtar Ablyazov, the ousted 
head of BTA bank.  "Respublika.kz" wrote that the first person to be 
prosecuted would be Mukhtar Dzhakishev, head of the state-owned 
nuclear company Kazatomprom, and the second would be businessman 
Nurlan Smagulov, the owner of the company Astana Group.  The website 
commented that although Smagulov had denied that there was 
law-enforcement interest in his activities, it was not by chance 
that both Khabar and KTK television broadcast a photo of him 
together with Ablyazov. 
 
OPPOSITION LEADER ABILOV SPECULATES ABOUT RAKHAT ALIYEV 
 
¶10.  Kazakhstani opposition leader Bulat Abilov answered questions 
from the public on the independent website "zonakz.net."  According 
to Abilov, the official investigating the 2006 murder of opposition 
leader Altynbek Sarsenbayev was told by then Interior Minister 
Baurzhan Mukhamedzhanov to say that Rakhat Aliyev was not involved 
in the killing.  "As far as I know, a bargain with Rakhat is taking 
place now," said Abilov.  "Certainly, it was suggested that he stop 
publishing compromising materials against the president and his 
people, and he was told not to publish his book."  Abilov said that 
negotiations were going well because Aliyev had not published any 
material on his site that would seriously discredit the government 
since the beginning of the year.  Abilov said that although Aliyev 
was 50 percent related to the murder, the "the order came from the 
highest levels in Astana." 
 
¶11.  When a reader questioned why Abilov had stopped criticizing 
President Nazarbayev directly and had started criticizing other 
politicians instead, Abilov replied that "criticism of Nazarbayev is 
not the goal."  He said that although the president had concentrated 
all the power in his own hands, those surrounding the president 
played a key role, too.  "Such odious figures as [Astana mayor 
Imangali] Tasmagambetov, [Prime Minister Karim] Masimov, and 
[Nazarbayev son-in-law Timur] Kulibayev must resign," he said. 
 
GOVERNMENT BLOGS ARE IDLE 
 
¶12.  Pro-government "Liter" published an article criticizing the 
lack of activity on government blogs.  The paper noted that only 
three ministers had updated their blogs -- with Nauryz (Persian New 
Year) greetings -- over the last month.  In particular, "Liter" said 
that Prime Minister Masimov's blog had gone from daily updates to 
only two entries over the course of the last month.  "Liter" 
reported that comments such as "What are ministers' blogs for if no 
one answers questions?," "I won't ask anything because I'll have to 
wait half a month for a reply," and "Close the blog, there is no 
reason to spend money on it" were becoming more and more common. 
The paper said that this electronic platform had turned into another 
failed project because the ministers "lack the vision or the desire 
to update their blogs."
