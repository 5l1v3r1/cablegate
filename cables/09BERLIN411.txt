Director for Middle East and Maghreb Sabine Sparwasser April

German Government took the issue seriously.  She pointed out

"partnership" status with the German Foreign Office, which 
heightened Germany's interest in the case.

summon the Tunisian Ambassador to protest Tunisian Government 
actions toward the school, and she said Germany would be 
prepared to carry out a demarche in Tunis as well, in
