SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/12): New Fatah Central 
Committee members bring new blood to the movement 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The local press runs prominent coverage of unofficial results of the 
Fatah Central Committee (FCC) elections.  The coverage notes that 
"new blood" has been pumped into Fatah after 14 new members were 
elected to the FCC; Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with photos of the 14 
new members. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas noted 
that the official results of the FCC elections will be announced by 
the elections supervisory committee. 
 
Al-Quds runs separate front page news citing DPA on senior Fatah 
leader Nabil Shaath noting after the elections that the newly 
elected FCC will have to pursue three major tasks: national 
reconciliation, ending the internal Palestinian division, and the 
establishment of the Palestinian State. 
 
Al-Quds also runs front page news citing Israeli government sources 
who doubt the peace plan that is reportedly being prepared by the US 
to end the Arab-Israeli conflict will succeed in light of Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's position on freezing settlement 
construction. The article notes that the Israeli government is 
challenging Washington and has firmly adopted the positions of the 
Israeli right wing. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page news citing Wafa News Agency on 
State Department Spokesperson Robert Wood reiterating the US call 
for the Israelis and Palestinians to commit to their Roadmap 
obligations. ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Dr. Asad Abdel Rahman opines in Al-Quds independent daily under 
the title, "The Obama-Netanyahu conflict" (08/12): "Obama's strategy 
focuses on a comprehensive peace not only between the Palestinians 
and Israelis but with the Arab and Muslim countries as well ... 
However, the next few months will determine if he will stick to his 
positions in light of the anticipated Israeli rejection of his 
proposals, or if he will cease the pressure and leave Netanyahu to 
fulfill the Jewish dream." 
 
2) Hamada Fara'na opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
headline "Fatah conference... Abbas conference" (08/12): "Mahmoud 
Abbas proved to be the key player in the proceedings of the Fatah 
h 
conference ... It was obvious in his speech that he is confident, 
determined, and balanced. If the conference is a success, then the 
success must be named after Abbas, the leader!"
