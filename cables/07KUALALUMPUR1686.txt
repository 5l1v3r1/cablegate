CONFERENCE, LEVEL NOT DECIDED 
 
REF: STATE 163955 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Polchief spoke with Assistant Secretary Mohd Adlyn 
Mughni Shamsudin in the Malaysian Foreign Ministry's OIC 
Division on December 7 and urged Malaysia's full and 
constructive participation in the Paris Donors Conference. 
Adlyn responded that Malaysia had agreed to attend the 
conference.  The decision on Malaysia's level of 
representation was still under consideration by Prime 
Minister Abdullah Badawi and Foreign Minister Syed Hamid 
Albar.  (Note:  We heard separately from a diplomatic source 
that Foreign Minister Syed Hamid likely would not go to 
Paris.  End Note.)  Polchief noted the importance of 
delivering significant political and economic support to the 
Palestinian Authority and argued that Malaysia should try to 
exceed its previous levels of assistance to the Palestinians 
(roughly $16 million over the past year).  Adlyn stated that 
Prime Minister Abdullah had been briefed on the issue.  The 
Malaysian government had not yet made a decision on 2008 aid 
to Palestine, but in all likelihood the amount would increase 
over that of previous years.  Part of Malaysia's support 
would take the form of technical assistance and training. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Adlyn, who joined the Malaysian delegation to 
Washington for the Annapolis Conference, said Foreign 
Minister Syed Hamid viewed Annapolis as "very positive."  The 
Foreign Minister and the Malaysian government had not issued 
any formal statements following Annapolis.
