REF: LIMA 1388 
 
 ¶1.  Via a Supreme Decree signed by President Toledo on May 
20, the Government extended for two more months the State of 
Emergency first declared in May of 2003.  The Presidential 
Decree carried over the State of Emergency in the same 
geographic area covered by the most recent extensions, dated 
March 20 and January 19.  The areas affected are seven 
provinces and districts located in the departments of 
Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Cuzco and Junin.  An accompanying 
Supreme Resolution, also signed by the President, provides 
that the Armed Forces are responsible for maintaining 
internal order in the affected locations, with the National 
Police tasked to support the military's efforts. 
 
¶2.  The area where the State of Emergency continues to exist 
includes some of Peru's most remote regions, where there is 
little official presence.  The four departments affected have 
large areas dedicated to coca cultivation, and in some 
locations continue to witness sporadic activity on the part 
of Sendero Luminoso. 
 
¶3. The specific areas are: 
-- Huanta Province (Ayacucho Department) 
-- La Mar Province (Ayacucho) 
-- Tayacaja Province (Huancavelica Department) 
-- La Covencion Province (Cuzco Department) 
-- Satipo Province (Junin Department) 
-- Andamarca District, in Concepcion Province (Junin) 
-- Santo Domingo de Acobamba District, Huancayo Province 
(Junin)
