Classified By: POLCOUNS BRIAN NARANJO.  REASONS:  1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
Panama would continue to exercise vigilance and restraint 
with respect to travel of UNSC-designated Iranians to our 
through Panama, MFA DG for International Political Affairs 
Javier Bonagas told POLCOUNS on May 14 following presentation 
of reftel A demarche.  Bonagas underscored that Panama, a 
non-permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC), was 
cognizant of UN Member States' responsibilities to uphold 
UNSC Resolutions 1737 and 1747.  Bonagas demurred on whether 
Panama would encourage Russia to use restraint regarding the 
travel of UNSC-designated Iranians or to encourage other 
governments to deny overflight or to require inspections if 
there were reasons to suspect that such individuals were on 
board.  While post believes Panama would take appropriate 
action to fulfill its obligations under these UNSCRs should a 
designated Iranian attempt to travel to or through Panama, 
post does not believe that Panama is prepared to press other 
countries, including Russia, to do the same.  Reftel A 
demarche was delivered in conjunction with reftel B demarche 
concerning the growing Iran-Venezuela relationship (septel).
