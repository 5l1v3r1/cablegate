SUBJECT: PRT Herat: Semi-Annual Herat Province Review 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Herat enjoys a relatively stable security 
situation, an improvement from this past spring when there was a 
series of kidnappings.  Shindand and Guzara districts remain 
unsettled.  Governor Anwari has worked closely with Coalition 
forces, the Italian-led PRT, international organizations, and NGOs 
to improve security, governance, and development.  Heratis' major 
concern is the current drought and the projected poor harvest.  The 
UN has predicted large-scale population displacements in western 
Afghanistan as people seek out alternate sources of food and water. 
The PRT provides substantial resources for reconstruction and 
development. 
 
Security: Stable, But Problems to the South 
------------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) The security situation in Herat is generally good, but 
on-going operations in southern Afghanistan have spill-over effects 
in Shindand district.  Guzara district is a base for local criminal 
elements.  In early spring 2008, there was a spate of kidnappings, 
which caused the local population to protest the deteriorating 
security situation.  Governor Anwari coordinated an operation with 
ISAF and Afghan security forces in Guzara against the criminals, and 
there have been no kidnappings since the operation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The economic vitality of Herat and Heratis' interest in 
maintaining it makes infiltration by anti-government forces more 
difficult.  Recently, five individuals carrying approximately 110 
kgs of explosives were arrested shortly after they arrived in the 
province.  The Regional Chief of Police (CoP) and Herat CoP are very 
active in countering anti-government activity in coordination with 
their U.S. military and ISAF mentors in Shindand and Farsi 
districts.  There have been no attacks against the PRT or PRT 
personnel during the last six months, although the PRT does not 
operate in all of Herat's districts. 
 
Governance: Governor Anwari Still in Place 
------------------------------------------ 
¶4. (SBU) The administration of Herat province is reasonably good and 
the local government officials, with some exceptions, are reasonably 
competent.  As far back as September 2007, there have been rumors 
that Governor Anwari would be replaced; however, he is still in 
place and continues to successfully manage the province, work with 
the international community on development and security, maintain 
good relations with Iran, and work to counter the disruptive 
influences of former governor Ismail Khan's agents in Herat.  He has 
been able to gain not only the public support of local religious 
leaders, but also the support of local former mujahideen who were 
unhappy about being excluded from the government with Khan's 
departure to Kabul as Energy Minister.  Rumors persist, however, 
that he will be replaced soon. 
 
Development: Both Quick-Impact and Long-Term 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) The Italian contribution to development in Herat is made by 
the military and civilian components via coordinated though separate 
programs.  The Italian military concentrates on quick-impact 
projects carried out by its civilian affairs staff, and the yearly 
budget is about 5 million euros.  The civilian component works on 
longer-term development projects, and its budget comes from Italy's 
overall development budget for Afghanistan of about 40 million 
euros, including 10 million euros for Herat.  Since the Italians 
took over the PRT in 2005, they have spent 40 million euros on 
reconstruction.  Iran continues to invest in Herat with construction 
of the railroad continuing, but with only Iranian engineers and 
labor.  Given the availability of development resources from the 
international community, provincial officials find it easier to ask 
for international help rather than raise their concerns with Kabul.
