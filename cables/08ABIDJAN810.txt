Mister President, 
 
Your brilliant victory in the American presidential election 
offers me the pleasant opportunity to extend to you, on my 
own behalf, and on behalf of the Democratic Party of Cote 
d'Ivoire (PDCI-RDA) my warmest congratulations. 
 
The enthusiasm and joy with which your election is welcomed 
are for us a reason to hope for a world of peace, justice and 
progress for all.  By choosing you, the American people have 
demonstrated their determination to face, together with you, 
the challenges of our times, which call upon each people to 
renew themselves and adjust to the new developments and 
demands of our planet. 
 
Wishing you full success, the PDCI-RDA is pleased by your 
commitment to fight poverty to achieve peace and security. 
 
With this expectation, please accept, Mister President, with 
my renewed congratulations, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Henri Konan Bedie 
President of the PDCI-RDA
