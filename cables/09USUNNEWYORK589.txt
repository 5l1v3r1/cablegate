SUBJECT: AMBASSADORS DENNIS ROSS AND SUSAN RICE DISCUSS
IRAN WITH UN SECRETARY-GENERAL
Classified By: Ambassador Susan E. Rice, reason 1.4 (b) and (d).
¶1. (C) Ambassador Rice and Special Advisor for the Gulf and
Southwest Asia Ambassador Dennis Ross on June 9 met with UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to explain key elements of U.S.
diplomatic outreach to Iran and to hear Ban's assessment.
Ambassador Ross explained that President Obama in various
fora and particularly from Cairo has made it clear that the
USG will engage Iran without any preconditions. He
emphasized, however, that the USG is cognizant that the
process will be difficult because, despite numerous common
interests, more than 30 years have passed without a
systematic line of communication with Iran. Ambassador Ross
said that every administration since 1979 has failed to
successfully engage with Iran, but he pointed out the urgency
in reaching a diplomatic settlement because of the region's
fears of Iran's nuclear program.
¶2. (C) Ambassador Ross said the USG values the P5 1 structure
for dealing with Iran because it is a statement of the
international community's resolve to deal with the nuclear
issue in a coordinated fashion, and he said the USG will be a
full participant in the P5 1 structure. Despite its
importance, Ambassador Ross said the USG aims to engage Iran
bilaterally, because that would allow for a broader treatment
of the issues, which is more difficult to achieve in a
multilateral context. The SYG said it is good to continue
with the P5 1 structure for now, but if its effectiveness
wanes the U.S. should be prepared to take the reins.
Moreover, the SYG said the Iranians had asked that he
persuade the Europeans to change their negotiating team,
principally Javier Solana, because of an apparent loss of
confidence in him. He said he delivered this message to
Solana.
¶3. (C) No engagement, however, should dismiss the fact that
Iran is currently sanctioned under three UNSC resolutions,
Ambassador Ross highlighted; international consensus should
not be ignored. Ambassador Ross said that the USG is not
interested in denying Iran its right to nuclear energy, which
it can enjoy under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but
with those rights comes responsibilities.
¶4. (C) Ambassadors Ross and Rice emphasized to Ban that Iran
must seize the moment now to answer positively the overtures
from the U.S. Ambassador Ross highlighted the moral
authority of the SYG's office in delivering a reinforcing
message. Ban said he does so every time he meets with
Iranian officials, and he offered UN assistance at the
appropriate time to further dialogue. Ban said he welcomed
President Obama's speech in Cairo as a strong diplomatic
initiative, which he said bolstered his standing with Iran
and regional actors. Despite Iran's unhelpful behavior at
times, Ban said the UN is working with Iran on various
peacekeeping and development programs. He said the UN
recently has opened a liaison office in Tehran for the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and plans
to open a similar office in Tehran for the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). Ban said he has plans
to send UN Undersecretary-General Lynn Pascoe to Iran but he
has not set a date.
¶5. (C) The SYG pointed out that he has insisted to Iranian
officials and President Ahmadinejad in particular that they
soften verbal attacks against the United Nations and against
him. Ban said Iranian officials generally dislike his
message, and the Government of Iran has openly criticized
him. He said, however, that he personally intervened with
Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki and told him that a
"low-level spokesperson" should not attack the SYG in the
press and that if Mottaki or Ahmadinejad have a problem with
the SYG they should tell him directly and in private.
