SUBJECT:  BRAZILIAN TEXT FOR U.S.- BRAZIL IMPLEMENTING ARRANGEMENT 
ON HEALTH 
 
 
¶1. This is an action request (please see paragraph 4). 
 
¶2.  Post is aware that Brazil's former Minister of Health, Jose 
Saraiva Felipe, met with several officials from HHS, the Department, 
CDC and NIH in February.  One of the topics presented by the 
Brazilians was the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
between the Brazilian Ministry of Health and HHS which expired in 
December 2003.  Post understands that there was agreement in 
principle to formalize the joint efforts but that HHS would consult 
with other U.S. Government entities prior to making a commitment. 
 
¶3.  During our last visit to the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, it was 
mentioned informally that Brazilian Ministry of Health officials 
attending the upcoming April 24 - 25, 2006, U.S.-Brazil Science and 
Technology (S&T) meetings, might come with draft text in hand for 
what they refer to as an "implementing arrangement." 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Post requests guidance on how to respond if asked by the 
Foreign Ministry whether the U.S. delegation has agreed to negotiate 
a new agreement, and if we will be prepared to discuss it during the 
previously mentioned April meetings.
