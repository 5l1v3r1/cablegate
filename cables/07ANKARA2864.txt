SUBJECT: TURKEY/IRAQ: GOVERNMENT APPROVES OCTOBER 17 
PARLIAMENTARY DECISION AUTHORIZING A CROSS-BORDER OPERATION 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Prime Minister Erdogan reportedly stated November 
30 that the Council of Ministers and President Gul have 
authorized the Turkish Armed Forces to conduct a cross-border 
operation (CBO) against PKK terrorists operating in northern 
Iraq.  Foreign Ministry and Turkish parliament contacts tell 
us the Council of Ministers decision, reportedly taken on 
November 28, is necessary to implement the parliament's 
October 17 decision authorizing a CBO, and does not mean a 
CBO is imminent.  A contact in the parliament's legal office 
told us that any CBO would still have to be coordinated by 
the Prime Ministry and the Turkish military. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  This appears to be the final bureaucratic 
step in giving the government, in coordination with the 
military, legal authorization to conduct a CBO should they 
decide one is necessary.
