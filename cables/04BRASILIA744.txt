REF: SECSTATE 62180 
 
According to the Ministry of Development, Industry and 
Foreign Trade, Department of Foreign Trade Operations 
(DECEX), Brazil maintains no controls on exports of steel or 
copper scrap.  The only requirement for scrap exports that 
differs in any way from the norm, according to the 
Department, is a requirement that proof of the purchase price 
of the scrap be provided at the time of export.  This 
requirement was established for tax purposes, given the 
difficulty of establishing the commercial value of some scrap 
items.  A cross-check with Brazil's published, consolidated 
list of items subject to export controls or requiring special 
procedures showed no controls on scrap, coke, DRI, copper 
cathode or iron ore exports.  To the contrary, Brazil is a 
major exporter of the latter.
