REF: A. SECSTATE 87824 
 ¶B. THE HAGUE 1356 
 
¶1. (SBU) Conoff contacted Rheinmetall Canada headquarters in 
St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec.  All officials contacted were helpful 
and forthcoming, and though they had not been contacted by the 
Mission in the past, understood the purpose of our questions. 
 
¶2. Natalie Nantel, Transport Coordinator, confirmed that the order 
had been placed, and that the product was destined for the Royal 
Dutch Army.  However, she said that the license number in Ref A, 
05-050048064, may have been changed because of an error in the 
initial license application.  The project described in reftel 
requires "FGBAD Consoles" rather than "ASRAD Consoles" necessitating 
a change in the order to U.S. supplier Vicor Corporation. 
 
¶2. Conoff also spoke to Pierre Lord, Security Coordinator and 
Raymond Houle, Senior Procurement Manager and ITAR Coordinator. 
Lord said that the company has applied for and been granted several 
DTCC Licenses over the last twenty years, and is fully aware of the 
restrictions on the export of U.S. defense articles.  He said that 
the facility in St-Jean is "NATO-Secret" certified for secure 
handling of defense technology. 
 
¶3. Houle said that Rheinmetall Canada's role in the transaction is 
to assemble and integrate the U.S. components into the consoles. 
These consoles would then be transferred to EADS in Germany, who 
would install the consoles into the armored personnel vehicles.  The 
vehicles would then be transferred to the Dutch.  Under ideal 
circumstances, Houle said, the U.S. technology would not have to be 
handled by the other three intermediate consignees: Krauss-Maffei 
Wegman, Kongsberg, and Aselsan.  Rheinmetall added them to their 
license application in case it was necessary for any of them to make 
a modification or perform testing after the U.S. technology was 
installed into the vehicle.  Krauss-Maffei Wegman is the 
manufacturer of the basic vehicle.  Normally, the vehicle would be 
shipped from Krauss-Maffei Wegman to Kongsberg defense, where a 
radar system would be installed, and then shipped to EADS.  EADS 
would then install Rheinmetall's console, with U.S. technology, 
completing the vehicle for the Dutch Royal Army.  Aselsan, a company 
that EADS uses for testing of its products, was also included, so 
that testing could be performed at their facility, if necessary, 
without changes to the license. 
 
¶4. Rheinmetall Canada, formerly Oerlikon Contraves Canada, supplies 
defense hardware and software mainly to the Canadian Forces, but 
also to other military customers, such as France, Belgium and the 
Netherlands, as well as the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guard. 
Rheinmetall Canada has also contracted with the Port of Dakar, 
Senegal to upgrade the security of the country's main commercial 
port.  The company has been in business since 1986. 
 
¶4. Post was not able to arrange a site visit in time for this 
report.  A site visit will be arranged at the earliest opportunity.
