REACTION 
 
REF: STATE 12905 
 
¶1. On February 29, EMIN presented reftel demarche to 
Balsharan Rakhra, Trade Policy Officer, Technical Barriers 
and Regulations Division, DFAIT.  He had arranged to make the 
presentation jointly with his EU Mission counterpart, but she 
was absent due to illness.  At the end of his oral 
presentation, EMIN asked the Canadian government to 
co-sponsor the U.S.-EC proposal on non-tariff barriers to 
textiles, apparel, footwear, and travel goods (TAFT).  He 
left a copy of the talking points and the text of the joint 
TAFT proposal. 
 
¶2.  Rakhra said that the Canadian government finds the 
U.S.-EC proposal "very positive" and supports its intent and 
content strongly "in principle."  Canada wants to collaborate 
with the U.S. and the EU to move this initiative forward. 
 
¶3.  However, Rakhra could not say at this time when Canada 
would agree to be a co-sponsor.  The Canadian government's 
inability to co-sponsor at the present time awaits 
clarification of a technical legal issue, she explained. 
Government lawyers expect to finalize in the near future 
their legal analysis of whether the TAFT proposal references 
in para. 5 and later paragraphs to the existing Technical 
Barriers of Trade (TBT) Agreement can be supported legally. 
The key question is "whether the new proposal can legally 
modify the TBT Agreement?"  Rakhra promised that there would 
be further consultations in Genera on this matter between 
Canadian officials and their U.S. and EU counterparts.
