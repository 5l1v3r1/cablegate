CIRCUMSTANCE 
 
¶1. (U) On December 10, the official state news agency WAM announced 
that the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Civil Aviation 
Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran to expand air passenger 
links between the two countries.  GCAA Director General Saif 
Mohammed al Suwaidi told the local press that the agreement, which 
will give UAE carriers 50 percent more access to Iranian airports, 
was signed on December 6 in Tehran.  Under the deal, a total of 215 
flights could be operated by Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, Dubai-based 
Emirates and Fly Dubai, Sharjah-based Air Arabia and Ras al 
Khaimah's RAK Airways.  Al Suwaidi said the UAE would be looking to 
conclude similar agreements with other countries in the region. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The GCAA Director of Aviation Safety and Security told FAA 
Rep on December 11 that the MOU was signed for purely commercial 
reasons.  However, Etihad VP for Operations told EconOff that the 
airline was having difficulty filling its single daily flight to 
Tehran that started in 2007 and didn't anticipate adding capacity. 
Similarly, sources at Emirates have told EmbOffs that the airline is 
having trouble filling existing flights. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  In tough economic times, there is little 
indication that passenger demand is driving this agreement, 
although, the MOU benefits UAE carriers in the long run.  More 
likely, the agreement represents an easy way to maintain cordial 
relations with the UAE's behemoth neighbor while enhancing 
commercial opportunities in a cornerstone industry.  It may also 
reflect part of a recent push by the Iranian Cultural Heritage and 
Tourism Ministry to boost Iran's tourism from the region.  A more 
detailed overview of the broader UAE-Iranian relationship will be 
reported septel. End Comment.
