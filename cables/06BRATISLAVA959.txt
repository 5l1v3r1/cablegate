¶1. FM Jan Kubis said Slovakia was among the majority of EU 
Member States on the side of continuing accession 
negotiations with Turkey, during a December 12 press 
conference at the Slovak MFA. Kubis said Slovakia's goal was 
to continue negotiations while sending a clear signal of 
displeasure with Turkey's continued failure to live up to its 
Istanbul commitments. "A very small group of countries" 
thought suspending even eight chapters was too strict a 
punishment, "and an even smaller group" thought it was not 
harsh enough, said Kubis. Kubis said Slovakia supports 
Turkey's candidacy in recognition of the progress Turkey has 
made, and because it is in the strategic interests of 
Slovakia and the EU. 
 
¶2. PM Robert Fico told Parliament December 11 that he 
supports Turkey's accession. Fico is quoted as saying that 
Turkey must fulfill all the EU accession criteria just like 
any other candidate, but that the country cannot be turned 
away just for having a different religion.
