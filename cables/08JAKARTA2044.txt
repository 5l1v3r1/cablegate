PRESIDENT SUSILO BAMBANG YUDHOYONO'S 
REMARKS ON 
THE U.S. ELECTIONS 
JAKARTA, INDONESIA, 
NOVEMBER 5, 2008 
 
The U.S. election results have now been announced with certainty and 
Senator McCain has also congratulated Senator Obama. 
 
I extend our heartfelt congratulations to the people of America for 
their obvious enthusiasm in exercising their democratic rights and I 
congratulate Senator Barack Obama for his successful election 
result. 
 
This is a very historic election for the United States in many ways. 
 It is also of great importance to the world. 
 
Indonesia hopes that President-elect Barack Obama will lead the U.S. 
as a force for peace, for progress, for spreading good, and for 
reforming the international system. 
 
The world community is now bound together in the midst of enormous 
global challenges: food shortages, energy security, financial crisis 
and climate change. 
 
None of these great issues of our time can be solved without the 
U.S. on board, and certainly, none of these issues can be solved by 
the U.S. alone. 
 
We need to work together to deliver a new age of global 
cooperation. 
 
Indonesians have a special affection for President-elect Barack 
Obama.  He had spent his childhood in Indonesia for some four years. 
 He knows our people and our culture well. 
 
I look forward to working closely with President-elect Barack Obama 
to strengthen our bilateral relations and to constructively address 
the global challenges of the 21st century. 
 
Thank you.
