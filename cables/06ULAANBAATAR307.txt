¶1.  (SBU) During an April 25 introductory courtesy call 
on new MFA State Secretary K. Bekhat, Charge urged 
Mongolia to immediately make clear that it will vote 
for Guatemala for an elected UNSC seat.  He commented 
that prospective votes are being closely followed in 
Washington.  Bekhat cautiously replied that Mongolia 
typically waits until August to make such decisions, 
and then decides how to vote based on a variety of 
factors.  He added, however, that Mongolia is currently 
discussing formal establishment of relations with 
Guatemala, as well as considering how to wage its own 
campaign in 2008 vis-a-vis Iran for an elected seat. 
Poloff commented that the U.S. hoped Mongolia would not 
become discouraged looking at the 2008 UNSC battle; 
just as the U.S. might focus later on the 2008 battle, 
however, it is now squarely intent on this year's UNSC 
contest and hopes for early expressions of Mongolian 
support for Guatemala. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In an ad hoc follow-on separate discussion 
immediately after the meeting with the State Secretary, 
Charge and Poloff met with MFA Director for 
Multilateral Affairs Ms. Enkhtsetseg, who explained 
that Mongolia hopes to sign an agreement of mutual 
support with Guatemala at the time diplomatic relations 
is established.  Mongolia, she said, would offer 
Guatemala support for its UNSC bid this year in 
exchange for Guatemalan support for Mongolia in 2008. 
She commented that Mongolia's reply to the U.S. request 
thus would be speeded if the Guatemalan Foreign 
Ministry accelerates discussions with Mongolia on 
establishment of diplomatic relations.  Charge urged 
that Mongolia support Guatemala's candidacy without 
linking it to the potentially time-consuming process of 
establishing diplomatic relations.  Ms. Enkhtsetseg 
mentioned the two nations' embassies in London planned 
to conduct discussions soon, and she also suggested 
USUN might consider putting Guatemalan and Mongolian UN 
reps together to advance the dialogue regarding UNSC 
voting.
