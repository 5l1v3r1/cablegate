CONCESSIONS FROM SUDAN JUSTIFYING ARTICLE 16 ACTION 
 
REF: STATE 77701 
 
Econ/Pol Counselor and Poloff discussed reftel points July 28 
with with Thomas Baier, MFA Legal Advisor on Multilateral 
International Law Issues, and Doris Danler, Deputy Head of 
the Africa Department.  Danler said the GOA had opposed the 
language proposed, and then withdrawn, by Libya.  Baier said 
the Austrians had been approached by the Sudanese and told 
that "without an unconditional agreement on Article 16, there 
was no chance to advance the peace process."  However, Baier 
noted that although Sudan and the African Union were pressing 
for UN Security Council action, neither had offered any 
concessions in return for a deferment of the ICC indictment 
on Bashir.  Since the UN Security Council had agreed to take 
up the ICC indictment, it would take a compelling reason to 
overturn it, Baier said.
