SUBJECT: MALTA: VISIT OF CHINESE VP UNDERSCORES CLOSE TIES 
AND RESULTS IN GRANT FOR PURCHASE OF CHINESE GOODS AND 
SERVICES 
 
¶1. (SBU) Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping arrived in Malta 
February 21 for an official two day visit during which he met 
with Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi and announced a grant of 
580,000 euros for Malta to purchase Chinese products and 
services. Paul Sant, MFA Desk Officer for China, told PolOff 
the grant was "a gesture of China,s appreciation" for the 
close historic relations between Malta and China, which date 
back to the 1972 when Malta, under a Labor government, 
recognized China. Sant indicated that the grant would go into 
a fund that would be created to foster economic and technical 
cooperation; he said that there were no specific projects 
under consideration thus far, and that all projects would 
need to be agreed to by both parties. 
 
¶2. (U) Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi told the press that 
"strengthening Malta,s cooperation with China is one of the 
government,s main foreign policy goals." During the visit, 
the Maltese and Chinese governments also signed five 
cooperation agreements on law and order, commerce, and 
culture.  Gonzi highlighted an agreement facilitating 
business and trade between investors in Malta and China, and 
referred to one collaboration, whereby the University of 
Malta will open a Confucius Institute, as a "milestone in 
cultural cooperation." 
¶3. (SBU) Malta has historically maintained strong relations 
with China.  In the 1970s, the GOM was one of the first 
European governments to recognize China and, in doing so, it 
forged a close relationship, including significant Chinese 
invested in Malta,s port infrastructure, and a long-term 
loan to build factories in Malta. China maintains two large 
and active Chinese Cultural Institutes in Malta, one in Paris 
and the second in Valletta. Just last month Malta,s Chief of 
Military, Brigadier General Vassallo went to Beijing for a 
five-day visit at the invitation of China,s Chief of 
Military.  Vassallo told Charge, February 21 that his visit 
was unrelated to the visit of China,s Vice-President, and 
did not result in the signing of any agreements or arms 
sales. Vassallo added that he had been "amazed" by the 
red-carpet treatment he was given during the visit, including 
multiple-gun salutes normally "reserved for heads of state."
