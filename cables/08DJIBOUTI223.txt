UNHCR REPATRIATION 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) reports a continued influx of refugees from south and 
central Somalia to Djibouti.  Meanwhile, UNHCR completed the 
repatriation of 1,853 Somali refugees to Somaliland.  END SUMMARY. 
 
REFUGEES FROM SOUTH AND CENTRAL SOMALIA 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. According to UNCHR, a steady influx of Somalis from south and 
central Somalia continues to arrive in Djibouti daily.  Figures 
collected by UNHCR and ONARS (Office National pour l'Assistance des 
Rfugis et Sinistrs - the GoDJ office in charge of refugee 
affairs) show that a total of 2,000 asylum seekers arrived at the 
Djibouti border since January 1, claiming to have fled the conflict 
in southern Somalia.  This sum totals UNHCR expected projected 
figure for all 2008. 
 
 
¶3. The refugees arriving at Loyada, the main border checkpoint 
between Djibouti and Somaliland, claim to have paid up to $250.00 
for transportation.  Others pay with jewelry or use other valuables 
and possessions.  There have been reports of sexual violence against 
women during their journey.  Those who cannot afford to pay walk the 
800 kilometers to find safety and security in Djibouti, particularly 
since the Kenyan border remains closed and the security situation is 
uncertain. 
 
¶4. As refugees reach Somaliland, they are not allowed to stay.  At 
the border point before leaving Somaliland, they have to pay $50.00. 
 If they manage to get to the no-man's land between Somaliland and 
Djibouti, they are approached by traffickers who offer to take them 
to Yemen and beyond, or to Eritrea.  Also, smugglers offer services 
to get them through mountain paths into Djibouti, to avoid the 
official border checkpoints.  The majority who make it to Djibouti 
among these recent arrivals are young men, who tell stories of 
leaving their wives and children because the journey is too 
difficult. 
 
¶5. On January 27, the UNHCR Special Advisor on the Somalia 
Situation, Wairimu Karago, visited the main Djibouti/Somaliland 
border crossing at Loyada, accompanied by the UNCHR Representative 
in Djibouti and the Government of the Republic of Djibouti (GoDJ) 
officials.  The delegation witnessed approximately 100 south/central 
Somali asylum-seekers crossing the border. 
 
¶6. The joint mission met with both police and military commanders at 
the border, who confirmed the presence of new arrivals in the no 
man's land area between Djibouti and Somaliland and led the joint 
mission to the group.  With the assistance of the border officials, 
the joint mission identified 62 families/122 persons all originating 
from Mogadishu and its surrounding areas.  Most of the group's 
members were single males between the ages of 16 and 35.  There were 
few women with young children.  No unaccompanied minors had been 
identified among the group.  Based on information collected from the 
group's members, they traveled by road from northern areas of 
Mogadishu via Galkayo and eventually through Hargeisa, Somaliland. 
Those interviewed claimed that they had fled from their homes 
because of continuous fighting and fear of Ethiopian troops.  They 
also added that they could not remain in Somaliland due to lack of 
protection and assistance.  According to the refugees, more people 
would be heading towards the Djibouti border. 
 
¶7. Border officials reportedly confirmed a continuous daily flow of 
30-40 asylum-seekers trying to cross into Djibouti.  They welcomed 
the proposal of having a permanent GODJ presence (ONARS) at the 
border, to facilitate the prompt and coordinated transfer of 
asylum-seekers from Loyada to the Ali Addeh refugee camp. 
 
SOMALILAND REFUGEES' REPATRIATION 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶11. On December 31, 2007, UNHCR reported the successful completion 
of the voluntary repatriation of an estimated 1,853 Somaliland 
refugees from Djibouti to Somaliland, with the cooperation of ONARS, 
Somaliland authorities, the World Food Program and other 
implementing partners.  The first six convoys departed from 
Ali-Addeh refugee camp.  The last convoy included 242 former 
refugees from Holl-Holl.  The refugees were taken with their 
personal effects to a way station, 130 km from Ali Addeh in Djibouti 
to Zeila Somaliland,that had been built for the reception of the 
returnees, distribution of food, non-food items and $40 cash 
grants.
