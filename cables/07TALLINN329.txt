(SBU) On May 18, Poloff delivered reftel points to 
Andres Talvik, MFA Asia Division Director, and discussed 
China and Taiwan's membership bids in the World 
Organization for Animal Health (OIE).  According to 
Talvik, the GOE fully agrees with the United States that 
the OIE is not the proper forum to discuss China/Taiwan 
policy.  Moreover, due to the global threat of 
communicable diseases like SARS and Avian flu, Talvik 
said the GOE agrees with the USG that a postponement of 
the vote on the PRC resolution would be the best 
compromise solution for both parties to save face and 
ensure both Chinese and Taiwanese participation in the 
OIE.  As the EU will ultimately take a single bloc 
position, Talvik said Estonia will argue strenuously in 
EU fora for the EU to back a postponement of the vote. 
However, given that there are a number of EU member 
states which support the PRC resolution, Talvik was not 
certain what position the EU would eventually take.
