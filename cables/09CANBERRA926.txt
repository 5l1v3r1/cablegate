 ¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Australia will support the U.S. position 
on the Goldstone Report (State 106423) and will instruct its 
UN Missions in New York and Geneva to coordinate with their 
U.S. counterparts.  DFAT Security Council Task Force Head 
Bassim Blazey, who is acting First Assistant Secretary for 
IO, told us October 14 that he would instruct the Australian 
Mission in New York to look for an opportunity to speak at 
the UNSC Open Debate.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SUB) Pol/EconCouns delivered the demarche (State 106423) 
to Acting 1st Assistant Secretary for International 
Organizations,  Bassim Blazey.   Blazey was receptive and 
indicated Australia's willingness to work with the United 
States on this issue.

U.N. delegations in New York and Geneva  to coordinate with 
the U.S. delegations prior to the Security Council Meeting on 
the 14th of October and the Human Rights Committee on the 
15th and 16th. Australia will support the U.S. position on 
the Gladstone Report and the peace process, and that will 
oppose any effort to have the Security Council take up the 
issue.   Blazey agreed that he would encourage the Australian 
delegation to try and find an opportunity to speak during the 
open debate at the Security Council.
