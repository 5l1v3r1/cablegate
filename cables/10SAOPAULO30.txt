"Brasil and the U.S. in Haiti" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-19) says: "The 
initial reaction of Brazilian authorities to the U.S. humanitarian 
operations in Haiti was nothing less than awkward.... The absolute 
priority for Haitians is to receive help, with the utmost urgency, 
regardless of who it comes from. The Brazilian reaction ignored the 
basic reality, which was clear to President [Ren????] Perval, that no 
other country had comparable means to help Haiti other than the 
U.S.....For President Barack Obama  the rescue in Haiti is both an 
act of humanity and an opportunity to show the world what the U.S. 
is capable of when it dealing with destructive forces.... A 
teleconference on Sunday...was the first initiative to share the 
work of managing the Haitian hell.... If it works, the 
Brasilia-Washington bilateral relationship will have overcome one 
of the most severe tests in many years." 
 
 
 
"In the Heart of Darkness" 
 
Opinion in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (1-19)  states: "No one knows 
what will become of Haiti once its misery leaves the headlines. 
Once more there is a great risk that the industry of humanitarian 
help will serve more the interests of a network of activists and 
international organizations than the rebuilding of the 
infrastructure and the building of public services in the country. 
We've seen this happen before. It is unfortunate, wearisome,and 
ends poorly." 
 
 
 
"The Defeat of Victory" 
 
Article by columnist Eliane Cantanhede in liberal Folha de S.Paulo 
(1-19) says: "Truth be said: both [Defense Minister Nelson]  Jobim 
and [Foreign Minister Celso] Amorim asked, several times, for more 
funds and for a change in the status of the [Minustah] mission from 
a peace mission (in other words, a police mission) to one of 
rebuilding the country.... The UN (in other words, the U.S.) never 
responded." 
 
 
 
"God and Men" 
 
Article by columnist Carlos Heitor Cony in liberal Folha de S.Paulo 
(1-19) states: "The worst seems to have passed in Haiti, God's work 
is done.... The U.S. with its financial and military powers has put 
itself in the role of manager of the tragedy...the attitude upset 
other countries who have been there for a long time as part of the 
UN peace mission , including Brazil.... But the vanities, spites 
and forces that are getting in the way of distributing 
reinforcements to police a society with no state structure are acts 
of men."
