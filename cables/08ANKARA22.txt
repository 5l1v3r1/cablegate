In Today's Papers 
 
Blast Kills 5 in Diyarbakir 
All papers report an explosion struck a military vehicle in the 
heart of the mainly Kurdish southeastern city of Diyarbakir on 
Thursday.  Of the five who were killed in the explosion, two were 
students; of the 110 who were injured, 30 were military personnel. 
Eight of the injuries are serious, which could cause the death toll 
to rise. The bomb was set off by remote control and targeted a 
military vehicle carrying 46 personnel.  Due to the explosion's 
proximity to a school, many more children would have been injured or 
killed if the explosion had occurred five minutes later, according 
to a teacher.  No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, but 
the A4 explosives used in the blast are known to be used by the PKK. 
 Police have detained 12 suspects. 
 
General Yasar Buyukanit, the chief of the military General Staff, 
will go to Diyarbakir on Friday to visit the soldiers wounded in the 
attack.  Mainstream Sabah cites Anatolian News Agency sources in 
reports that Turkish warplanes, soon after the Diyarbakir attack, 
bombed terrorists camps located in the Gabar and Kupeli mountains. 
 
 
After the blast, President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Erdogan 
reaffirmed their determination to eliminate the PKK.  "Once again 
terrorism shows its ugly face," said Gul.  Prime Minister Erdogan 
stressed that "Turkey will continue to fight terrorism with 
determination." 
 
Turkey's mainly Kurdish political party DTP issued a statement 
condemning the attack, which said the attack took place at a time 
when there is need for peace around the country.  The DTP also 
tasked a delegation of parliamentarians and deputy chairmen to 
conduct an investigation in Diyarbakir.  The Mayor of Diyarbakir, 
Osman Baydemir, also condemned the attack. 
 
Mainstream Sabah and the Islamist-oriented Zaman say the attack 
shows the desperation of the PKK terrorists, who are now heavily 
bombarded by Turkey's military in northern Iraq.  Papers note A-4 
explosives were used in the attack, which "turns the eyes to the PKK 
as the main suspect."  Papers reiterate that the PKK had threatened 
to retaliate against the Turkish operations into northern Iraq. 
Under the headline, "The 'You Can't Return Home' Bomb," the 
leftist-intellectual Taraf says the blast has been a response to the 
AKP government's "return home" project for the PKK militants. 
 
In a related story, all papers report that police have seized a bomb 
made of 14 kg of C-4 explosives from a car in Bursa, which is just 
south of Istanbul.  One suspect was detained in Bursa.  In the 
eastern city of Van, police found a minibus, parked near the Van 
castle, with hand grenades, hand-made landmines, and 50 kg of C-4 
explosives. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkish Domestic Politics, the Country in 
2008 
Hasan Cemal observes in mainstream Milliyet (1/4):  "The opposition 
CHP does not inspire trust within Turkey.  Swiss Professor Erik-Jan 
Zurcher, an expert on Turkey, says "the CHP is not a left party, but 
an authoritarian state party.  In Turkey, there are no serious 
alternatives to the ruling party.  The AKP appeals to all on the 
political spectrum, which is not normal.  AKP has been considered as 
a force for democratization in Turkey.    I do not see a threat of 
Islamization in Turkey."  Deniz Baykal's CHP has never succeeded in 
establishing a viable opposition platform.  There is not one 
opposition party who can come forward to say they can manage the 
economy or unemployment better than the ruling AKP.  No opposition 
party is keen to launch educational and judicial reforms. 
Instability awaits Turkey's political system if the non-existence of 
a viable opposition party continues."

Koray Duzgoren comments in Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak (1/4): 
"Turkey enters 2008 in a state of war.  This cannot continue; there 
is a lot the government must do to secure peace this year.  Reforms 
must be made to expand freedoms, lift bans, protect minorities, and 
jump start efforts for EU accession.  The AKP has demonstrated 
attempts to resolve the Kurdish question without talking to Kurds 
and without attempting democratic and political solutions.  2008 
will test the ruling AKP's ability to deal with the Kurdish problem. 
 Turkey does not have any more time to lose." 
 
Turkish Cyprus Leader Talat Visits Ankara 
All papers report that on Thursday, President Abdullah Gul received 
northern Cyprus leader Mehmet Ali Talat.  In a joint press 
conference after the meeting, Gul said he would urge UNSYG Ban 
Ki-moon to revive the stalled Cyprus peace process.  "I will ask the 
UN to be more active, to start new efforts for a comprehensive 
solution to the Cyprus problem." Gul said 2008 offered a new 
opportunity for Cyprus because of Greek Cypriot elections are set 
for February 17.  "We are determined to support a settlement that is 
acceptable by both parties," said Talat.  Leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet emphasizes that Talat did not use the term "Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC) but said the "Turkish side" 
while referring to the enclave in the north of the divided island. 
A commentary in liberal Radikal says that Talat's top-level 
reception at the presidential palace indicate Ankara's full support 
for Talat. 
 
Gul's US Trip is not a 'Fast-Food Visit' 
Liberal Radikal says President Abdullah Gul will embark on his 
January visit to the US with Foreign Minister Ali Babacan, Energy 
Minister Hilmi Guler, Economy Minister Mehmet Simsek, and a 
high-level military official.  US media calls the Gul visit a 
"fast-food visit," but Ankara insists the timing is perfect since 
Gul will meet President Bush before his tour of the Middle East, 
according to Radikal.  Islamist-oriented Zaman says Gul will hold 
separate talks with Secretary Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney 
before meeting President Bush.  Then, Gul will travel to New York to 
meet UNSYG Ban Ki-Moon and the representatives of the Jewish lobby. 
Gul will also deliver a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations 
(CFR). 
 
Editorial Commentary on President Gul's Visit to US 
Hasan Mesut Hazar wrote in conservative-nationalist Turkiye (1/4): 
"President Gul's upcoming US visit will be remembered as an 
historical effort to strengthen bilateral relations.  At a White 
House briefing, spokesman Scott Stanzel announced that Presidents 
Gul and Bush will discuss Afghanistan, Iraq and Turkey's EU 
membership.  This visit carries great importance because of the 
timing and the issues to be discussed.  The visit will take place at 
the beginning of 2008, when the international agenda is very 
intense. The meeting's immediate proximity to Bush's tour of the 
Middle East indicates Turkey's increased international importance. 
Prime Minister Erdogan's visit to the White House in November 
resolved the two countries' prior bilateral problems.  Following 
this meeting, President Bush declared the PKK a common enemy of the 
US and Turkey.  However, Turkey-US relations are not limited to the 
fight against the PKK.  The US is aware of Turkey's strategic 
importance in the region.  Let us all remember that strong 
US-Turkish relations benefit Turkey, the US, and the Middle East. 
These relations will promote peace and calm in the region."
