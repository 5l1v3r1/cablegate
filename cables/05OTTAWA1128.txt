SUBJECT: CANADA: RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON FOURTH GLOBAL 
FORUM ON FIGHTING CORRUPTION,  BRASILIA, BRAZIL, JUNE 7-10, 
2005 
 
REF: STATE 063279 
 
¶1.  Poloff delivered reftel demarche discussing the Fourth 
Global Forum on Fighting Corruption (GF IV) to Alain Tellier, 
Deputy Director of the International Crime and Terrorism 
Division at Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC), on April 8. 
Tellier thanked us for the points, said that FAC was tracking 
the preparations for GF IV closely, and advised that he would 
pass this demarche within FAC and to their embassy in 
Brasilia. 
 
¶2.  Continuing, Tellier indicated that FAC has ongoing 
concerns on the logistical planning for GF IV, especially 
when compared to the previous two GF conferences in South 
Korea and The Netherlands.  He said that several Government 
of Canada (GoC) ministries have offered to send speakers to 
GF IV, but that FAC has yet to receive any definitive 
response from the conference organizers.  Likewise, he said 
that GF IV conference organizers have not responded to 
queries that FAC has made about hotel rooms and other 
logistical questions.  Tellier also noted that the proposed 
agenda may be too ambitious, and that he has concerns that 
the conference itself may lack focus, as compared to previous 
GF conferences. 
 
¶3.  According to Tellier, with less than two months until the 
start of the conference, these problems are hampering FAC's 
planning for GF IV.  There is no current plan for a 
minister-led delegation, and Tellier noted that with the lack 
of information from GF IV organizers, senior level GoC 
officials may not be able to attend, due to other GoC 
scheduling commitments.
