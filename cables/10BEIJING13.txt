SUBJECT: JANUARY 5 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: U.S.-SINO RELATIONS, 
CHINA-AFRICA, EXECUTION OF UK CITIZEN, IRAN, DPRK 
 
¶1. Key points at the January 5 MFA press briefing included: 
 
-- On trends in U.S-China relations, the two sides worked from a 
"comprehensive common ground," believed in the peaceful development 
of the relationship, and respected the "core interest" of each 
other. 
 
-- The PRC followed the "ethics and customs" of Shaikh in the 
implementation of his death sentence and was dissatisfied with EU 
remarks that encroached on China's "judicial sovereignty." 
 
-- "Dialogue and negotiation" were the way forward in dealing with 
the Iranian nuclear issue. 
 
-- The PRC and Africa shared a "strategic partnership" based on 
"equality and mutual benefits" and close coordination on 
international affairs. 
 
U.S.- China Relations in 2010 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On media predictions that U.S.-Sino relations will deteriorate 
in 2010, Jiang replied that China and the U.S. worked from a 
"comprehensive common ground," believed in the peaceful development 
of the relationship, and respected the "core interests" of one 
other.  Taiwan and Tibet remained core interests for the PRC and 
China firmly opposed the sale of arms to Taiwan.  Jiang urged the 
U.S. to "realize the gravity" of the situation and not sell arms to 
Taiwan.  China was opposed to the leaders of the U.S. and any other 
nations or international organizations meeting with the Dalai Lama. 
 
The Execution of Akmal Shaikh 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  China had explained its position in the execution of British 
citizen Akmal Shaikh on many occasions, Jiang said.  The case was 
handled according to Chinese law and China's independent judicial 
authority, she claimed.  The PRC respected the "ethics and customs" 
of Shaikh in the implementation of his death sentence.   Shaikh's 
case was of a criminal nature and unrelated to Sino-UK relations, 
Jiang asserted, adding that China was focused on "common interests" 
and developing relations with the United Kingdom.  The PRC was "very 
dissatisfied" with the EU President's public display of displeasure 
towards China in the Shaikh case, which was a clear infringement on 
China's judicial sovereignty. 
 
U.S. Dialogue with North Korea 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  China supported increased contact and dialogue between the 
United States and North Korea, Jiang stated.  The goal for all 
parties involved was the resumption of the Six-Party Talks and the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
 
No Exit Permission for DPRK Border Crossers 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  On reports that China had refused since April 2009 to grant exit 
permission to DPRK citizens that cross into China, Jiang responded 
that China believed such border crossers entered China illegally, 
and foreign embassies and consulates in China "should not give 
shelter to them."  China's position on these "illegal immigrants" 
remained unchanged, Jiang concluded. 
 
Sanctions on Iran 
----------------- 
 
¶6.  China had taken note of the news that the U.S. and other 
countries wanted to impose further sanctions on Iran, said Jiang. 
China believed that "dialogue and negotiation" were the way forward 
and that there was "still room for diplomatic measures" with Iran. 
The international community should come up with the "best possible 
plan" to resume talks with Iran, Jiang said. 
 
Chinese Websites Supporting Iranian Protestors 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶7.  A question was asked on the government's reaction to Chinese 
websites that have appeared supporting Iranian protestors calling 
for democratic reforms in Iran, but the question was not translated 
by the interpreter and was ignored by the spokesperson. 
 
FM Yang Jiechi to Visit Africa and Saudi Arabia 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
BEIJING 00000013  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶8.  Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will visit Africa and Saudi Arabia 
from January 6-13, Jiang reported.  He departed this morning for the 
Maldives to hold meetings today with President Mohamed Nasheed and 
Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed, and will travel on to Kenya (January 
6-7), Nigeria (7-9), Sierra Leone (9-10), Algeria (10-11), Morocco 
(11-12), and Saudi Arabia (12-13).  This was the 20th consecutive 
year that the Chinese Foreign Minister chose Africa for the first 
overseas trip of the calendar year, Jiang claimed, underscoring the 
deep friendship between China and Africa.  The PRC and Africa shared 
a "strategic partnership" based on "equality and mutual benefit," as 
well as close coordination on international affairs.  During the 4th 
Forum on Cooperation between China and Africa held in November in 
Egypt, the two sides laid out the "future course for cooperation," 
which included eight new measures of cooperation.  China will 
continue to "join hands" with its friends in Africa to increase 
cooperation and "enhance strategic partnerships" for the well-being 
of the African people, Jiang added. 
 
 
China's Role in the World Economy 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  In response to a recent article in the UK's Guardian newspaper 
questioning the influence on the world economy from the rise of 
China's economy, spokesperson Jiang Yu responded that the root cause 
of the international financial crisis was "obvious to all."  In the 
past when developing countries had economic troubles western 
countries were always quick to place blame on the countries 
themselves.  Yet with this most recent financial crisis, while 
everyone knew the root cause came from the U.S. and Europe, western 
countries sought to place blame on others, she argued.  "What kind 
of logic was that?" asked Jiang.   China's economy was deeply rooted 
in and contributed to the world economy.  The future of the world 
economy does not depend on just one country, and the key was to 
increase economic cooperation between countries, Jiang said. 
 
China-Australia Oil Contracts 
----------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Spokesperson Jiang claimed to be unfamiliar with the details of 
media reports that oil contracts between China and Australia have 
been cut off.  China and Australia had "highly complementary" 
economies and worked from the basis of "common interest," she said. 
 
PRC Development of Nansha Islands 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  China took note of Vietnam's demand that China end its project 
in the Hoang Sa Archipelago to develop it as a tourist designation, 
Jiang said, but maintained that China has undisputed sovereignty 
over the Nansha (Spratly) Islands. 
 
World Economic Forum 2010 
------------------------- 
 
¶12.  China will be represented at the World Economic Forum in Davos, 
Switzerland, January 27-31.  The PRC had always supported the World 
Economic Forum and would send a "high-level" delegation to attend 
the meeting, Jiang said. 
 
Senior Appointments at the MFA 
------------------------------ 
 
¶13.  The MFA will release information on the reassignment and 
appointment of senior MFA officials in "due course" and interested 
parties should monitor the MFA's website.
