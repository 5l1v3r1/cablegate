REF: STATE 63551 
 
¶1.  Post delivered reftel demarche on June 22.  On June 24, 
we were informed by the Afghan desk of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs that Belgium does not intend to make an 
individual declaration on the elections at the present time. 
The MFA referred to the common statement released by the 
European Union following the European Council meetings on 
June 19.  The MFA welcomes President Obama's statement, finds 
it appropriate and approves of it.  It shares the view the 
credible elections are what Afghanistan needs most today. 
 
¶2.  As quoted by the MFA, the EU statement says: 
 
Begin text: Recognizing the challenging environment in which 
the first Afghan-led election process will take place, the EU 
attaches the greatest importance to the holding of credible, 
inclusive and secure presidential and provincial elections in 
Afghanistan in line with international standards, which would 
strengthen the support of the Afghan people for their 
institutions. It is particularly important that the state 
exercise its authority with impartiality and integrity to 
ensure that no candidate is unfairly disadvantaged. 
Political legitimacy is at the heart of further progress in 
Afghanistan.  Afghan politicians have an important role to 
play by reaching out to the voters and encouraging Afghans to 
exercise their right to choose their own leaders by 
participating in the August elections.  The EU also calls on 
candidates to use the campaigning period to present policy 
manifestos, which inform and engage the population in the 
political process.  As part of international efforts, the EU 
remains committed to supporting the elections and will deploy 
a team of international observers to Afghanistan.  End text.
