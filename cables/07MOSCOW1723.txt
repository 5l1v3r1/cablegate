SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: PRE-LICENSE CHECK: VITALIY 
SHEVCHENKO, KREMENCHUK, UKRAINE, LICENSE NO. D370016 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 00697 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Vitaliy Shevchenko, Kremenchuk, Ukraine. The company 
is listed on BIS license application D370016 as the 
ultimate consignee of two USB WIN 7 input channel 
computerized polygraphs. These items are controlled 
for foreign policy reasons under ECCN 3A981. The 
licensee is Lafayette Instrument Co., 3700 Sagamore 
Pkwy North, Lafayette, IN47904. 
 
¶3. On March 15, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the Kremenchuk Hotel, 
Kremenchuk, Ukraine. The export control team met with 
Vitaliy Shevchenko and Sergey Shevchenko. 
 
¶4. Messrs. Shevchenko are brothers, and plan to open a 
polygraph examination service from a small, currently 
unfurnished office in the Kremenchuk hotel.  Currently 
Vitaliy Shevchenko is working at the Kremenchuk 
Railway Wagon Factory, which produces railroad cars 
and other rolling stock, as a laborer.  The company 
will be operated under the auspices of Vitaliy 
Shevchenko's pribol, a permit to operate as an 
independent businessperson issued by the local 
government.  The choice of polygraph screening 
services came to Vitaliy Shevchenko by way of the 
Internet, as Vitaliy read extensively on polygraphy 
and related business opportunities. 
 
¶5. The brothers plan to offer pre-employment screening 
services and private examinations.  Messrs. Shevchenko 
both attended a training course in Kyiv given by the 
International League of Polygraph Examiners - Ukraine 
and taught by Dr. Andrii M. Volyk.  They also both 
hold certificates from the Indiana Polygraph 
Institute, which co-sponsored the training.  Neither 
brother has any prior experience in investigative 
interviewing.  The brothers are financing the venture 
with their own money. 
 
¶6. The polygraph in reftel will be stored in a safe at 
the home of Vitaliy Shevchenko.  Vitaliy has doubts 
about the security at the hotel, and feels the safest 
way to secure the device is to keep control of it 
himself.  Considering the fact that the business is 
dependent of the security of the device, Vitaliy is 
not willing to take any chances that might lead to the 
theft of the polygraph. 
 
¶7. ECO Pearce has conducted additional research 
regarding the statements and information provided in 
the above interview.  An email to the International 
League of Polygraph Examiners - Ukraine was replied to 
by Dr. Andrii M. Volyk, who verifies that the 
Shevchenko brothers indeed attended his training 
course. It should be noted that Dr. Volyk is also the 
founder of ARGO-A, the official distributor for 
Lafayette Instruments in Ukraine.  No further 
information was available on the Indiana Polygraph 
Institute.  ECO Pearce is concerned that Messrs. 
Shevchenko lack of prior experience and certification 
by a questionable organization might pose a risk of 
future unauthorized resale or transfer.  Should the 
license be granted, it is recommended that a 
requirement for post-shipment verification be added to 
the conditions of the license. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: While post believes Vitaliy 
Shevchenko, Kremenchuk, Ukraine, to be a potentially 
reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities, the finding is limited as noted in 
paragraph 7 above. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
