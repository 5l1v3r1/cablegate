¶1. SUMMARY: There are no specific laws that protect children from 
exploitation in the workplace, and child labor occurred during the 
reporting period.  A lack of resources and political instability 
hampered the GOGB's response to the problem. END SUMMARY 
¶2. There are no specific laws that protect children from 
exploitation in the workplace, and child labor occurred. The legal 
minimum age is 14 years for general factory labor and 18 years for 
heavy or dangerous labor, including labor in mines and the armed 
forces. The small formal sector generally adhered to these minimum 
age requirements; however, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry 
of Civil Service and Labor did not enforce these requirements in 
other sectors. 
¶3. The Institute of Women and Children and the ministries of labor 
and justice are responsible for protecting children from labor 
exploitation; however, there was no effective enforcement due to 
insufficient protective statutes, and capacity constraints in the 
police and judiciary. 
 
¶4. Most child labor occurred in the informal sector. The incidence 
of children working in street trading in cities increased during the 
year. In rural communities, children did domestic and field work 
without pay to support families or because of a lack of educational 
opportunities.  Some children were partially or completely withdrawn 
from school to work in the fields during the annual cashew harvest. 
The government had not taken action to combat such practices by 
year's end. Children were trafficked for purposes of labor 
exploitation, working as domestic servants, shining shoes in urban 
areas, and selling street food such as bananas and peanuts. 
¶5. Throughout the reporting period, the GOGB made little progress in 
combating child labor.  Following the dissolution of the government 
and National Assembly in early August, 2008, officials were focused 
on the November 16 legislative elections, and distracted by 
attempted coups in August and November.  A new government was 
installed in January 2009 and pledged to unveil its legislative and 
budgetary program by the end of February.
