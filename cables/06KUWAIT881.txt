REF: 05 KUWAIT 4813 
 
¶1.  Summary: Kuwait hosted the 50th session of the 
Tripartitite Commission's Technical Subcommittee (TSC) on 
March 14, 2006 with representatives from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, France, Britain, the International Committee for the 
Red Cross (ICRC), and Embassies Kuwait and Baghdad in 
attendance.  The session closed three cases, each involving 
an Iraqi found alive in either Iran or Iraq.  Investigations 
into the mass graves sites previously discussed (reftel) were 
unable to proceed in the time period since the 49th session 
due to security issues.  There was no new information on 
CAPT. Speicher's case.  End Summary. 
 
Mass Graves Update 
------------------ 
 
¶2. The 50th session of the TSC was held in Kuwait on March 
14, 2006.  The Kuwaitis opened the meeting by informing the 
attendees that no assessments or exhumations had taken place 
in the period since the 49th TSC because of security 
concerns.  As soon as conditions improve, the Kuwaitis said 
they would coordinate with the Iraqis to pursue their 
missions in Nasseriya and Karbala III.  In addition, there 
were no identifications made of mortal remains previously 
exhumed.  Reporting on the eight samples of mortal remains 
provided by the Iraqis to the Kuwaitis from a site in 
Amarah/Missan, no match could be made with Kuwaiti missing. 
The number of identified Missing/POWs from the Iraqi invasion 
stands at 227 of 605. 
 
Jahra 
----- 
 
¶3.  The Kuwaitis reported that an incomplete assessment was 
made on gravesites in the city of Jahra, Kuwait, within a 
military compound January 29, 30, and 31 as well as February 
20 and 21, 2006.  The gravesites were mapped out by an 
eyewitness who was unable to travel from Iraq.  Due to recent 
construction within the military compound, the gravesites 
could not be positively located.  The direct witness is 
expected to travel to Kuwait with the assistance of the ICRC, 
sometime in the future to assist in locating the gravesites. 
 
Tel Al-Laham 
------------ 
 
¶4.  The Iraqis reported that the site at Tel Al-Laham may 
contain about 450 mortal remains.  The Iraqi Ministry of 
Human Rights (IMHR) is interviewing a "high official" from 
Saddam's regime regarding this site and stated that as soon 
as additional information became available they would contact 
Kuwait via the ICRC.  Kuwait acknowledged that since it was 
believed that there was a high number of remains at the site, 
it is likely to contain more than Kuwaiti remains. 
 
¶5.  The Iraqis also reported that a female professor from 
Baghdad informed the IMHR that a gravesite containing 250-300 
Kuwaiti mortal remains was located in Baghdad.  Further 
investigation of the witness and an assessment of the site by 
the Iraqis and Kuwaitis is expected. 
 
Al-Kaffel and Salman-Pak 
------------------------ 
 
¶6.  The Saudis reported to the Iraqis that they had no 
further information to provide on the site at Al-Keffel. 
Regarding Salman-Pak, according to the Iraqis the site is 
inaccessible at this time due to security concerns.  The 
Kuwaitis asked if the cemetery official could be interviewed 
in the meanwhile in order to ascertain how many unnamed 
graves are located in Salman-Pak.  The Iraqis stated that the 
IMHR had already requested contact with a cemetery official. 
 
Iraq/Saudi Mission 
------------------ 
 
¶7.  The Saudis informed the ICRC that a joint Iraqi-Saudi 
mission would take place in Saudi Arabia beginning April 29th 
and that formal notification of the mission was already sent 
to the ICRC.  The purpose of the mission is to discuss the 
repatriation of Iraqi remains currently located in Saudi 
gravesites.  The Saudi proposal was met with thanks and the 
ICRC will observe the mission. 
 
Closed Cases and an Iraqi Request Regarding Missing Servicemen 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
 
KUWAIT 00000881  002 OF 003 
 
 
¶8.  The Iraqis closed three cases.  The first was an Iraqi 
repatriated alive from Iran in late 2003 while the other two 
involved Iraqis who were in the Rafha refugee camp and who 
returned to Iraq without notifying the ICRC.  The Iraqis also 
asked the Kuwaitis to look into information that eight Iraqi 
pilots were killed and buried on Ali Al-Salem airbase as well 
as information that 10 Iraqi soldiers were buried in Umm 
Al-Manaqish oilfield near Al-Ahmadi.  The Kuwaitis welcomed 
the request and asked that any further information be passed 
through the ICRC.  The Kuwaitis further reasserted that any 
mortal remains not identified by their DNA lab were returned 
to Iraq. 
 
¶9.  There was no new information on CAPT. Speicher's case. 
 
Next TSC Meeting 
---------------- 
 
¶10.  The next TSC meeting will take place during the second 
half of June 2006 at the request of the Kuwaitis.  The Iraqi 
delegation insisted that the meeting should take place in 
northern Iraq, either Erbil or Suleimaniya, a request the 
ICRC will take into consideration. Following is the 
activities plan to be undertaken before the 51st session: 
 
 - Assessment and exhumation mission in Nasseriya and Karbala 
III. 
 
 - Further assessment of the Tel Al-Laham site. 
 
 - Visits by Iraqi witnesses to assist in locating gravesites 
in Kuwait. 
 
 - Pursuing investigation efforts regarding Najaf/Al-Kaffel 
and Salman-Pak. 
 
 - Joint assessment mission to Saudi Arabia starting April 
29, 2006. 
 
 - Transmission of coordinates of gravesites by U.S. and U.K. 
regarding Iraqi mortal remains (Note.  The ICRC delegate told 
poloff that his office was in possession of military map or 
grid coordinates from 1991 which do not match longitude and 
latitude.  He asked for assistance in transcribing the 
coordinates into ones which could be easily plotted.  End 
note.) 
 
 - Transmission of coordinates and possible visits by Iraqi 
witnesses to assist in locating gravesites at Umm Al-Manaqish 
oilfield, near Al-Ahmadi and Ali Al-Salem airbase.
