Department Asian Multilateral Security Division Deputy 
Director Zuo Wenxing told PolOff August 24 in response to 
reftel points inviting Chinese participation.  Zuo added that 
the PRC delegation would be led by PLA senior Colonel Zhao 
Bao and likely include three representatives from the 
Ministry of National Defense, one representative from the 
Ministry of Civil Affairs and one representative from the

the PRC representatives directly to EAP/RSP Kevin Sheives
