August 31, 2009 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
The Nationalist Party (former Norodom Ranariddh Party) was deeply 
saddened to learn the passing away of His Excellency Mr. Edward 
Kennedy, Senator of the United States of America.  On behalf of the 
leadership of the Nationalist Party and on my own behalf, we would 
like to express our most sincere condolence at this painful time. 
 
It is with highest respect and emotion that today we salute this 
great Statesman who tirelessly devoted his life for justice, 
fairness, human rights, democracy, and opportunity for all.  We want 
to pay tribute to his great moral qualities and his political 
responsibilities.  With his passing, the American people lose a 
great leader who wholeheartedly committed himself to unwaveringly 
serving his Country. 
 
We would like to convey our sympathies to his great wife, children, 
grandchildren, and to the people of the United States.  We pay 
tribute to his memory and his great achievements for the People of 
the United States.  May his soul rest in peace! 
 
May I avail myself of this opportunity to express my best wishes for 
Your Excellency's success, good health personal well-being, as well 
as for the continued progress and prosperity of Country and its 
citizens. 
 
Please accept, Your Excellency, the renewed assurances of our 
highest consideration and personal esteem.
