START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Ms. Tracey Thomas is one of Nova Scotia's more prominent 
young, black women who is clearly on a fast track in the 
business development area and in various volunteer positions 
in the local black community. 
Ms. Thomas has enjoyed a stellar career with the Black 
Business Initiative and more recently with her temporary 
assignment to Nova Scotia's community college.  Both 
positions have put her in direct contact with many young 
minority people who are focused on getting an education and 
ultimately at starting businesses.  Young people describe 
her as their biggest positive influence, especially with her 
emphatic messages such as staying in school. 
Ms. Thomas would benefit greatly by the opportunity of 
traveling to the United States to meet and network with 
members of America's minority communities.  The experience 
would be a lasting one for her and one that she could share 
with the young people she encounters in her professional and 
volunteer careers.  This project would support the post's 
goal of furthering understanding of U.S. society among 
influential Canadians.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: PAO Alyson Grunder 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Patrick Gilles was brought into the Quebec Liberal Party in 
2002, to help coordinate and build support in Montreal 
minority communities in the run-up to the 2003 provincial 
elections. His attributes for the job included his strong 
ties to Montreal's large Haitian community, his networking 
and negotiating skills (developed from his years as an 
entrepreneur and a union official in Laval), his name 
recognition as a local sports hero and his pragmatic yet 
very committed approach to involving minority populations in 
Quebec's political process.  He has been particularly active 
on Haitian issues, and has been working to coordinate a role 
for the diaspora in Haiti's reconstruction and development. 
Gilles is a respected party official, whose advice and 
presence is sought by Montreal's numerous cultural groups, 
and by Parti libral du Qubec leaders. Gilles was 
instrumental in getting out the vote for another Montreal 
l 
nominee, Yolande James, the first black woman member of the 
National Assembly.  He would eventually like to run for 
office in Quebec himself, but he also wants to see other 
minority group members get elected, and is committed to 
helping them.  Gilles is interested in how American 
government, political parties, community groups and the 
private sector respond to the needs and take advantage of 
the contributions of minority populations. He would also 
like to explore the impact and integration of immigrants in 
U.S. society.
