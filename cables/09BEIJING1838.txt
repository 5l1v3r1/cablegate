Wu Dawei's Trip 
--------------- 
 
¶2. Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei began his visit to Russia, the 
United States, Japan and South Korea today, announced Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Qin Gang at the July 2 regularly 
scheduled press briefing.  During the trip, Wu will "exchange views 
with relevant parties" on the situation on the Korean Peninsula as 
well as issues relating to Northeast Asia, added Qin.  Wu's exact 
itinerary will depend on his consultations, Qin explained.  China 
continues to "maintain communication" with relevant parties, noted 
Qin, and believes that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can 
only be achieved through "dialogue and consultation" within the 
framework of the Six-Party Talks. 
 
¶3. When asked whether or not Wu planned to meet with the U.S. 
Coordinator for Implementation of UN Security Council resolution 
1874 Philip Goldberg during his current trip to China, Qin replied 
that Ambassador Goldberg would be meeting with MFA officials. 
 
Green Dam 
--------- 
 
¶4. When asked if he believed that children in China were endangered 
by the delayed implementation of the Green Dam filtering software, 
Qin replied that he had said "all he needed to say" about this 
issue, that "competent authorities had made remarks," and that he 
"had nothing to add." 
 
Reserve Currency at G-8? 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. President Hu plans to exchange views on strengthening 
international cooperation to address the financial crisis, as well 
as reform of the international financial and currency systems, said 
Qin when asked whether or not President Hu would raise the issue of 
replacing the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency at the upcoming G-8 
summit in Italy July 8-10.  He added that China has "already made 
clear" its position on this specific issue, and that countries 
should focus on areas of consensus as well as implementing the 
recommendations issued at the G-8 summit last year. 
 
Troops to Yonaguni 
------------------ 
 
¶6. China hopes that any action by Japan "will contribute to peace

Chinese.

project financing for the country.  China would expect "early 
results" from this cooperation, maintained Qin.
