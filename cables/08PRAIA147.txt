REF: STATE 51536 
 
In response to the Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People, 
materials provided in reftel will be placed on post website in 
English and in Portuguese.  Because all local newspapers are 
published weekly, translating and placing the editorial in a 
timely manner was not possible in this instance.  The GOCV is 
not planning any events to promote Solidarity with the Cuban 
people.
