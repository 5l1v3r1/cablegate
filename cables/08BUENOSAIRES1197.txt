SUBJECT: ARGENTINE SPACE AGENCY DESIRE TO INCLUDE 
 BRAZILIAN-UKRAINIAN JOINT VENTURE IN END-USER REQUEST FOR 
 ARGENTINE SAOCOM SATELLITE MISSION 
  
 REF: NONE 
  
 Classified By: DCM Thomas P. Kelly, for reasons 1.4 (c) and (d). 
  
 ¶1. (C) On 01 August, Executive Director of the National 
 Commission on Aerospace Activities (CONAE), Dr. Conrado 
 Varotto and CONAE Secretary General Felix Menicocci, made a 
 request to broaden the scope of an existing End-User request 
 related to the Argentine SAOCOM satellite project.  Per 
 Varotto, the GOA had drafted the text for an open tender 
 which conformed to existing International Trade in Arms 
 Regulations (ITAR) standards with regard to the use of 
 U.S.-made components in the SAOCOM satellite system.  At the 
 time of the original draft, the GOA did not take into account 
 the possible use of the Ukrainian Cyclone-4 launch vehicle or 
 the use of the Brazilian launch facilities at Alcantara. 
  
 ¶2.  (C)  To allow the joint Brazilian-Ukrainian venture, 
 Alcantara Cyclone Space, to compete in the Argentine SAOCOM 
 project, the GOA has proposed changes in the text of their 
 original End-User request.  Varotto believed the updated text 
 will permit the sale of U.S. components to the GOA for use in 
 SAOCOM, and will account for the possible participation of 
 Alcantara Cyclone Space in an eventual launch.  Varotto 
 expressed his interest in traveling to Washington to discuss 
 the details with relevant Department officials.
