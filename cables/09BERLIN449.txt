SUBJECT: (S) GERMANY INFORMED ABOUT POSSIBLE IRANIAN UAV
SHIPMENT THROUGH HAMBURG

REF: A. STATE 28302
¶B. ANKARA 450
¶C. STATE 36834

Classified By: Global Affairs Unit Chief Don L. Brown for
reasons 1.4 (b), (c), and (d).

¶1. (S//NF) German officials have agreed to immediately
notify their competent authorities about an imminent shipment
of Iranian origin UAV parts to Venezuela in the coming weeks,
possibly through Hamburg. On April 15, EconOff delivered the
REF C demarche to German MFA export control officers led by
Markus Klinger, Deputy Office Director for Export Controls.
PolOff delivered the demarche in parallel to MFA Arms Control
Desk Officer Hans Koeppel. Klinger said Germany is glad to
assist in preventing this shipment to Venezuela, but said
that more detailed information concerning the goods and date
of possible shipment would be very helpful. Koeppel, having
previously served in Caracas, noted that cargo flights
between Iran and Venezuela are scheduled to occur on a weekly
basis and questioned why the Iranians wouldn,t simply fly
this shipment directly to Venezuela.

¶2. (S//NF) The German export control officials, ever
sensitive to potential legal vulnerability on export control
matters, said that based on the REF C information they would
need to examine their legal position on this case, given that
action may be required. Specifically, they asked whether
these items (UAV components) are clearly Wassenaar-listed
items and whether they would be considered "arms or related
materials" pursuant to the UNSCR 1747 operative paragraph 5,
prohibiting Iran from exporting arms or related materials.
Post will report any substantive German response septel.
