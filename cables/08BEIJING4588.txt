¶1. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"The self-saving ability of the U.S. should not be underestimated" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/17): "Many people say that the U.S. is 
declining because of the financial crisis. However, the U.S. is 
showing its people that it has the self-saving capability and 
self-reflection and self-correction capabilities needed to regain 
its strength. The self-saving and self-correction mechanisms of Wall 
Street are completed through reflecting on the supervisory 
departments and the selection system of the financial market. The 
political changes in Washington have shown that the U.S. is very 
capable of self-correcting. Obama's existence is like a milestone in 
the world's eyes. The American culture is so generous that it has 
moved the world. A nation's self-saving capability is based on three 
things: firstly, a rational society which contains justice and 
fairness, forgiveness and freedom, relaxed atmosphere for different 
opinions, the spirit of reflection and the talent to be good at 
reflection; second, a complete legal and democratic system which can 
protect an individual's dignity and where the will of the majority 
can be fulfilled. And third, an effective, non-corruptive, and 
responsible administrative and judicial system to ensure the 
self-saving measures will be implemented." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"'Seeking common views and promoting cooperation' - an international 
seminar based on memorializing the 30th anniversary of the 
establishment of U.S.-China relations" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(12/17): 
"Both Chinese and American scholars indicate that the U.S.-China 
relationship is progressing and becoming more honest. Experts 
believe that the development of U.S.-China relations is driven by 
interests and not by values. For a healthy development in the 
U.S.-China relationship, in the future, the U.S. will need to 
cautiously deal with sensitive topics like the Taiwan and Tibet 
issues. Experts also indicate that the long-term and mutually 
beneficial cooperation between the two has benefited the two 
countries. The long lasting and the quick development of China has 
become an important factor in the U.S.-China relationship. Chinese 
experts believe that the Obama administration's China policy will 
emphasize domestic issues such as, economics. The two countries will 
have conflicts based on the exchange rate and the trade surplus, but 
overall, the cooperation will be furthered." 
 
¶3. SOMALI PIRATES 
 
"China will send three warships to Somalia" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/17): "China is actively considering 
sending a fleet of war ships to the Somali coast to maintain 
shipping security. Chinese officials have said that the fleet will 
consist of two cruisers and one large supply ship. China has 
discovered that the outside's reaction to sending these warships has 
been quite positive and that the China-threat theory has not been 
brought up. Western media and officials indicate that the moves by 
China show the World that China is a responsible member of the 
international society. Chinese experts indicate that China's move 
may arouse the West's attention and that this is a good experience 
for the Chinese Navy. China is willing to provide public security 
assistance for the international community. China's efforts to help 
maintaining international shipping security is also welcomed by the 
international community. China's moves can also protect the 
international trade environment. It is a chance for the Chinese Navy 
to take over international duties and establish the Chinese 
military's image as a responsible party, willing to contribute to 
the World's peace.
