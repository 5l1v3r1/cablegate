SUBJECT: GOP RALLIES NEIGHBORS, EU TO CONDEMN RUSSIAN ACTIONS IN GEORGIA REF: A. KYIV 1546 B. STATE 85678 Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES PAMELA QUANRUD FOR REASON 1.4 (B), (D) 

Â¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Poland has taken on a surprisingly forceful leadership role during the Georgia conflict. President Kaczynski has coordinated regional demonstrations of solidarity with Tbilisi -- including a planned August 11 joint trip to Tbilisi along with the Ukrainian and Baltic presidents -- and loudly condemned Russian military actions in an August 9 joint statement along with his three Baltic counterparts. Foreign Minister Sikorski overcame some EU member states' sympathy for Russia's "defensive/offensive operations" in Georgia to win agreement on an August 13 meeting at the FM level. Sikorski, who will be speaking to the Secretary this evening, is also pushing a proposal to replace Russian peace-keeper forces in Georgia with an EU-led force, although this may flounder for lack of Russian buy-in. Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Andrzej Kremer insisted to Charge August 11 that the Russian actions in Georgia not be allowed to damage Georgia's MAP candidacy, an effect that would reward Russia and encourage it to take similar actions elsewhere in the region. END SUMMARY. OVERCOMING EU SYMPATHY FOR RUSSIAN ACTIONS 2. (C) Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Andrzej Kremer told Charge August 11 that FM Sikorski had to overcome significant opposition within the EU even to schedule a foreign minister level meeting on Georgia August 13. Kremer said a number of EU member states believed Georgian President Saakashvili was responsible for the conflict and were sympathetic to the GoR claim that it was only acting "defensively-offensively." Although Polish FM Sikorski suggested in a "Dziennik" newspaper interview today that the Georgians had made the mistake of "yield(ing) to provocations," he pushed hard to win agreement on the EU FM meeting. Kremer said Poland had focused its lobbying efforts on the EU because the GoR suspects the USG, a NATO leader, encouraged the GoG to go on the offensive, and because the EU has economic leverage with Russia. Kremer said FM Sikorski's proposal to create an EU-led international mission to take over the Russian peace-keeping operation in Russia could well garner EU support. However, Kremer said such a plan would be contingent upon Russian approval, which appears unlikely at present. SUPPORT FOR A STRONG STATEMENT AT THE NAC 3. (C) Kremer agreed with the need for a strong statement condemning Russian actions in the August 12 NAC, but said that he did not really expect Russia to listen to NATO. Kremer agreed with all elements of reftel demarche, and added that Poland will also push hard at the NAC to prevent negative spillover on Georgia's MAP prospects. He said Russian action in Georgia should not be allowed to interfere with the MAP process, and the upcoming NATO mission to Georgia should go forward. To do otherwise would reward Russian actions and encourage Russia to act similarly elsewhere in the region. Separately, Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski spoke by telephone with DASD Dan Fata, calling for a strong NAC statement condemning Russian actions in Georgia. Komorowski warned that without a cease-fire, a wider regional conflict involving Ukraine could result. ORCHESTRATING A SHOW OF SOLIDARITY IN EASTERN EUROPE 4. (SBU) The Polish Government is pressing the envelope of international efforts to create an immediate cease-fire in Georgia and condemn Russian disproportionate use of force there. In an unusual display of presidential-governmental unity, the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister have coordinated joint initiatives among Eastern European countries and pressed hard for EU and NATO efforts to end the fighting. As a show of regional solidarity, President Kaczynski is working to coordinate a joint visit to Tbilisi the evening of August 11 along with the Presidents of Ukraine and the three Baltic countries. Kaczynski's plan, foreign policy aide Mariusz Handzlik told PolCouns, is to pick up each president in capitals en route to Tbilisi; President Klaus of the Czech Republic also backs the mission but was unable to join due to a hip injury. President Kaczynski's internet page is currently relaying messages from the Georgian government, since the Georgians' own websites are (apparently) being blocked by Russian interference. 5. (U) On Saturday, August 9, President Kaczynski and his three Baltic counterparts issued a statement condemning WARSAW 00000947 002 OF 002 Russian military actions "aimed against the sovereignty and independence of the Georgian state" and calling on the EU and NATO to oppose the spreading of "imperialist and revisionist" policies in Eastern Europe. Under these circumstances, the statement questioned the appropriateness of an EU-Russian strategic partnership and said that Russian actions in Georgia should be factored into negotiations on a new EU Partnership and Cooperative Agreement with Russia. 6. (SBU) On August 12, the Deputy Chief of the President's Chancery, Piotr Kownacki, will fly to Georgia to promote a seven-point plan authored by the Presidents of Ukraine and Lithuania and backed by President Kaczynski. The plan, which President Kaczynski reportedly briefed President Sarkozy about, calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities and the transformation of the Russian peace-keeping force in Georgia into an international force under EU command. Kownacki has told reporters that Polish troops would definitely participate in an EU-led mission. Kremer noted that Kownacki's mission is information-gathering in nature. 7. (U) The Polish government has also organized the voluntary evacuation of 300 Poles in Georgia. The Poles and a few accompanying Czechs and Estonians drove to Yerevan, from where they were to be flown home on Polish government flights. EFFECT ON MD NEGOTIATIONS? 8. (U) Some Polish politicians, including President Kaczynski, argued publicly that Russian actions in Georgia drove home the need for Poland to conclude a Missile Defense agreement with the U.S. However, the government's chief MD negotiator, FM Sikorski, said there is no link between events in Georgia and the MD talks. 9. (C) Comment: The Poles are clearly concerned that Russia be prevented from redefining the status quo in South Ossetia -- and tanking Georgian (and Ukrainian) MAP aspirations at the same time. Kremer was insistent that the conflict be walled off from MAP discussions. He (and his Minister) are hoping first that the EU will decide to offer up a peacekeeping force, and second that the EU will be willing to put some big ticket items in the EU-Russian dialogue -- energy relations and the EU-Russian Partnership Agreement negotiations -- on the line in order to convince Russia to accept such peacekeepers. Both are a tall order. QUANRUD
