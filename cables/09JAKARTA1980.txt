SUBJECT: C-175 Authority Needed to Advance NAMRU 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director General Retno has 
asked for a one-on-one meeting with you during your visit to discuss 
the future of NAMRU.  Your discussion will be most successful if you 
can inform her that the State Department has issued Circular 175 
authorization to negotiate the establishment of an Indonesia-United 
States Center for Biomedical and Public Health Research (IUC). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Visas for NAMRU personnel expire December 31.  We 
understand informally that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will 
extend the visas one final time until March 31, 2010.  Further 
extensions for NAMRU personnel would not be possible, forcing NAMRU 
to close down and its staff to depart.  In September, HHS Secretary 
Sebelius and then Health Minister Supari agreed to establish the IUC 
under joint civilian control.  The MOU establishing this center 
would enable Naval medical personnel to obtain new visas and 
continue their important work on emerging and infectious tropical 
diseases.  It would also provide a mechanism for the Center for 
Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, and other 
government laboratories to engage with Indonesian on important 
research. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In order to negotiate the formation of the IUC before 
NAMRU personnel are forced to leave at the end of March, we need 
Circular 175 authorization now.  HHS is coordinating the interagency 
process.  If we have Circular 175 authority, your message to 
Ambassador Retno would be clear: we understand the political 
sensitivity of this issue; we support the creation of the IUC as the 
focal point of our future health cooperation; and we are ready to 
begin negotiations immediately on the memorandum of understanding to 
establish the IUC.
