SUBJECT: EMBASSY PRESENTS INTEL COSTA RICA WITH ACE FINALIST AWARD 
 
¶1.  On December 17, Charge d'Affaires Peter Brennan presented Intel 
Costa Rica with a plaque of recognition for achieving Finalist 
status in the Department of State's 2009 Award for Corporate 
Excellence program.  Brennan highlighted Intel's achievements in 
the areas of good corporate citizenship, environmental stewardship, 
investment in community education programs, and development of the 
local economy. 
 
 
 
¶2.  Intel Costa Rica's General Manager Mike Forrest expressed 
gratitude for the recognition.  He considered it a validation that 
Intel was "on the right track" in its attempts to model excellence 
in the area of corporate social responsibility.  He noted that 
Intel believed so strongly in contributing to the community that it 
authorized employees to work with charitable organizations during 
business hours, and Intel employees had dedicated 32,000 hours to 
these causes in 2009. 
 
 
 
¶3.  Following the ceremony, Forrest commented that multinational 
companies can counter negative stereotypes of their roles by using 
corporate social responsibility to positively impact local 
communities.  By recognizing the achievement of the private sector 
in this area, the Department of State helps to promote a positive 
image of U.S. involvement in community-building initiatives.
