REF: A) USDOC 00153 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Rich Long Logistics, Ltd., O/B 
Uni Shine Marine Co. Ltd., 6/F Wah Tat Industrial Center, 8-10 
Wahsing Street, Hong Kong (Rich Long). The items in question for 
this PSV are outboard marine propulsion engines and a bow thruster 
system exported to Rich Long on or about February 28, 2007.  While 
the applicable export control documentation does not list an export 
control classification number (ECCN), it is likely that these items 
can be shipped license free to virtually all destinations and 
end-users worldwide except certain sanctioned countries and 
restricted entities and individuals.  The exporter was Wesmar 
Western Marine Electronics of Woodinville, Washington. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Rich Long has 
been in existence since 2001.  Its paid up share capital is the Hong 
Kong equivalent of USD 12500.  The Hong Kong Companies Registry 
lists two Hong Kong residents as directors, namely Kao, Shih Yi and 
Lin, Chien Kuo Gery. 
 
¶4.  A review of the company's web site (www.Rich Longlogistics.com) 
reveals that Rich Long is a logistics services company with 
operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China.  It provides a 
range of services including warehousing, customs operations, 
insurance, global tracking and computerization, among others. 
 
¶5.  On February 26, 2009, ECO accompanied by Commercial Assistant, 
Carrie Chan, visited Rich Long and met with Ms. Carmen, an account 
manager. She provided background on the Rich Long consistent with 
the information on the company's web site.  From ECO's observation, 
it appears that approximately 20-25 staff work at the company's 
office.  Ms. Carmen stated that Rich Long provides a range of 
freight forwarding and related services for the China market.  When 
asked, Ms. Carmen did not appear to know anything about Hong Kong 
Strategic Commodities licenses and ECO assumes the company does not 
apply for licenses.  Note: Only items on Hong Kong's strategic 
commodities control list would require a license for import into 
Hong Kong or export from Hong Kong.  ECO informed Ms. Carmen that 
U.S. export controls apply to U.S. origin items and subsequently 
provided her with additional information about those controls. 
¶6.  As to the specific transaction in question, Ms. Carmen stated 
that she was unable to locate the underlying documentation for this 
shipment.  She stated that shipping documentation is kept on hand 
for one year and then shipped to the company's warehouse in the 
mainland.  She further stated that the customer and ultimate 
consignee, Uni Shine Marine, is a regular customer of Rich Long.  It 
manufactures boats in Zhuhai, mainland China.  Ms. Carmen stated 
that she is unaware of Uni Shine's customers.  A web search of Uni 
Shine reveals that it is apparently an affiliate or subsidiary of 
Taiwan firm Her Shine Marine which, among other things, builds 
yachts in partnership with Jefferson Marine in Jeffersonville, 
Indiana.  ECO has no reason to doubt that the items were actually 
shipped to Uni Shine. 
 
¶7.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes the items did 
reach the buyer listed on the applicable export documentation 
(namely Uni Shine Marine Co. Ltd.).  ECO is less sanguine about the 
suitability of Rich Long to be the recipient (as logistics provider) 
of controlled U.S. origin technology.   ECO can make no 
determination as to the suitability of the apparent ultimate 
consignee Uni Shine Marine Co. Ltd.
