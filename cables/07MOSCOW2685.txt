¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Russian Academy of 
Sciences (RAS) Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP), 
Chernogolovka, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application D358874 as the ultimate consignee of one (1) millimeter 
source module 90GHZ to 140GHZ, model S08MS-AG, and one (1) 
millimeter source module 60GHZ to 90GHZ, model S12MS-AG. These items 
are controlled for national security and anti-terrorism reasons 
under ECCN 3A002. The licensee is Agilent Technologies, Inc., 1666 K 
st., N.W. Suite 420, Washington DC. 20006. 
 
¶3. On May 11, 2007, Export Control Attach Donald Pearce and FSN 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification with RAS ISSP, Institutsky pr., 15, Chernogolovka, 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Vladimir 
Kulakovsky, Deputy General Director. 
 
¶4. ISSP was founded in 1960 as an educational research facility 
concentrating on the study of condensed matter physics, materials 
science and high technology.  The institute employs 207 researchers, 
the majority at the Ph.D. level or above.  The institute has two 
buildings with laboratories and classes located on a closed campus 
in the town of Chernogolovka, about 30 kilometers from central 
Moscow.  Dr. Kulakovsky provided the team with a fifteen-page 
overview of ISSP and its research programs, which is available from 
post upon request.  The facility does no military research, and has 
no visiting faculty or students from Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan 
or Cuba. 
 
¶5. The devices in reftel are used in the study of composite fermion, 
a new class of particles discovered in condensed matter physics. 
The frequency source modules are needed to study the microwave 
response from a semiconductor heterostructure in a high magnetic 
field.  The goal of these studies is to better understand the 
composite fermion particle, which may lead to the next advances in 
semiconductor materials use. 
 
¶6. The team was shown a 90GHZ to 140GHZ millimeter source module, 
model S08MS-AG with serial number 60821-1 and a 60GHZ to 90GHZ 
millimeter source module, model S12MS-AG, 61002-1.  Digital 
photographs of the units were taken and are available from post upon 
request. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends RAS Institute of Solid Physics, 
Chernogolovka, Russia as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities.
