¶1.  (U) UAE headlines August 2 cited Vice President and Prime 
Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MbR, also 
ruler of Dubai) expressing solidarity with Prime Minister 
Siniora in a telephone call the previous evening.  UAE media 
also highlighted MbR's statements early on August 1, in which 
he praised the Lebanese people for their bravery against 
"barbaric Israeli aggressors" who indiscriminately attacked 
civilian and military targets in Lebanon.  He also "held 
Israel fully responsible for crossing the red line in this 
war" and stated that Israeli targeting clearly showed that it 
was not only hitting Hezbollah, but "the whole of Lebanon, 
including its civilization, history, resources, achievements, 
and various sects, especially innocent children who have been 
brutally killed." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Prime Minister's strong words come amidst 
ongoing humanitarian outreach to the Lebanese people. 
Official UAE web sites note Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin 
Zayed Al Nayhan visiting Lebanese patients who have been 
transported (by the UAEG) to a military hospital in Abu Dhabi 
for treatment.  Reports of four more planeloads of UAE aid 
arriving in Beirut also feature on August 2. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: UAE residents of all nationalities 
continue to be energized by the crisis in Lebanon.  Angry 
headlines and editorials reflect a deep concern, as do the 
strong statements of senior government officials -- two of 
the strongest of which have been by the Foreign Minister (ref 
A) and now by the Prime Minister.  End comment.
