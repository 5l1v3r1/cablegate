The three dailies front page news on Monday's clashes in Shufat 
refugee camp after Israeli civil and paramilitary police stormed the 
camp and detained dozens. Confrontations erupted near the military 
checkpoint at the main entrance to the camp after young Palestinians 
pelted Israeli soldiers with stones and empty bottles. Soldiers 
responded by firing tear gas, rubber-coated bullets and stun 
grenades. Hours earlier, a large deployment of Israeli forces raided 
the neighborhoods of As-Salam, Ras Khamis, and Ras Shahada in the 
camp, north of East Jerusalem, and detained over 60 Palestinians 
affiliated with the Salafi movement and Fatah. 
 
The dailies report on Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud 
Abbas stating in a joint press conference with the Japanese Prime 
Minister in Tokyo yesterday that they discussed ways to strengthen

building the institutions of a Palestinian state 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages news on Palestinian officials stating that

time to conduct these talks. 
PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat is quoted in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
denying news in the local media that Abbas agreed to resume peace 
talks. 
 
The dailies report that the PA cabinet decided yesterday during its 
weekly meeting to hold municipal and local elections in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip on July 17, 2010. Directives were given to the 
Palestinian Central Elections Committee to begin preparations. 
Al-Ayyam reports on Hamas criticizing the decision and saying that

reconciliation.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Under the title "Stop the Mutual Incitement First", an editorial in 
Al-Quds urges Hamas and Fatah officials to stop the incitement and 
trading blame for problems the Palestinian people are facing. The 
author urges both movements to focus on ending the division and 
achieve national unity.
