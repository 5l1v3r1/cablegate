SUBJECT: CZECH STATEMENT ON IRAN MISSILE LAUNCH 
 
REF: WARSAW 1004 
 
Czech Defense Minister Martin Bartak told the press on 
September 29 that the Czech government considers the recent 
tests of Iranian Shahab-3 and Sedjil missiles a serious 
threat to Israel and southeast Europe.  Noting that these 
missile tests occurred shortly after Iran admitted to 
building new underground facilities for enriching uranium, 
Bartak stated that "this approach is destabilizing for the 
Middle East and provokes serious concern."  The Czech 
government also released an official statement on September 
29, which follows below. 
 
Begin statement: 
 
Iran's recent missile tests only confirm doubts over the 
advanced development of the Iranian missile program.  The 
Sahab-3 and Sejil missiles with a flight range of 1,300 to 
2,000 km represent potential serious threats not only for 
Israel, but also southeast Europe.  These tests took place 
shortly after Iran acknowledged the existence of a second 
nuclear facility, the purpose of which is very questionable. 
This approach is destabilizing for the Middle East; it is 
also a reason for grave concern and must lead to a strong 
coordinated process that would encourage Iran to respect its 
international commitments. 
 
End of the Czech government's statement.
