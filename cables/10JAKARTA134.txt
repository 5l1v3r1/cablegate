SUBJECT: POTUS Indonesia Climate Initiative: from Science to 
Solutions 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Jakarta suggests the framework below as a way to 
carry a POTUS message on climate change and environment during his 
upcoming visit to Indonesia.  SOLUSI is the Indonesian word for 
"solution" and could be the name of an Obama climate and environment 
initiative.  SOLUSI -- Science, Oceans, Land USe, and Industry -- 
could provide an umbrella to house the very substantial, broad-based 
U.S. activities on climate and environment.  As a package, SOLUSI 
would support the key messages that POTUS could deliver on his 
upcoming visit: 
 
-- Indonesia is a climate change heavy weight, not only due to its 
substantial GHG emissions from forests and peat and for its 
unsurpassed marine biodiversity, but also for its efforts to advance 
a global solution. 
 
-- The U.S. launches a new climate partnership with Indonesia 
focused on domestic, regional and global challenges for mitigation 
and adaptation. 
 
SOLUSI -- A PACKAGE OF BROAD-BASED U.S. ACTIVITIES 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) The very wide-ranging impacts of climate change do not 
allow for a single area of focus, particularly in a large 
archipelagic nation like Indonesia.  Furthermore, no single U.S. 
effort on climate change or environment is large enough in dollar 
terms to underpin a strong POTUS message on climate change. 
However, the net sum of all USG activities on climate and 
environment in Indonesia is substantial and impressive.  SOLUSI 
provides an elegant package, and could be strengthened further if it 
has components into which other major donor countries can plug as 
part of a multi-donor effort. 
 
S = Science 
----------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The U.S. and Indonesia can partner in collaborative science 
research to jointly discover new solutions to the full range of 
climate challenges.  Our bilateral science and technology 
cooperation is poised for takeoff under a new Science and Technology 
Agreement, which we hope to initial very soon.  Joint activities 
range from hard science measurement and R&D to converting 
discoveries into practical solutions, policy implementation and 
commercialization that will benefit local communities in adapting to 
and mitigating climate change.  Announcing a climate change center 
in Indonesia could fulfill a Cairo Vision promise of establishing a 
science center of excellence in Southeast Asia.  Furthermore, if the 
USG creates an ARC component in Indonesia (whether hub or spoke) 
that can serve as an open platform for other donor countries to 
join, we could multiply the impact in Indonesia.  Increased impact 
in Indonesia will yield lessons learned to share with other 
countries in the region to help them adapt to climate change and 
meet mitigation targets. 
 
Potential U.S. activities for inclusion: 
 
- USAID's University Linkages Grants (2 already awarded, including 
one on marine climate change) 
- Increased DOE labs engagement with Indonesian research institutes 
- Methane-to-Markets Partnership (proposed) 
- Science and Policy collaboration on Peat Lands 
- Disaster preparedness/mitigation 
- Biotech collaboration for Food Security 
- Joint Ocean Exploration (NOAA Okeanos Explorer) 
- NOAA-Indonesia Ocean Science Partnership, including on fish and 
food security (proposed) 
- Climate Change Center (under consideration through ARC 
initiative) 
 
O = Oceans 
---------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Hundreds of millions (if not billions) in Indonesia and 
other countries with a coastline face climate change threats of sea 
level rise, ocean acidification, and destruction of habitats that 
spawn the fish we rely on for food and protein.  Indonesia is home 
to the most marine biodiversity in the world and has also shown 
 
JAKARTA 00000134  002 OF 002 
 
 
leadership on marine and climate-ocean issues.  It launched the 
6-nation Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI), hosted the World Ocean 
Conference, and wants to see increased climate change focus on 
oceans.  As an archipelagic nation of over 17,000 islands, Indonesia 
is acutely sensitive to the potential impacts of climate change. 
Indonesia lies at the heart of the Coral Triangle and will host the 
permanent Regional CTI Secretariat.  The United States is a founding 
partner - and largest bilateral supporter - of the CTI, which has 
climate change adaptation as a key concern. 
 
Potential U.S. activities for inclusion: 
 
- USAID Jakarta's Marine Program 
- Regional support to Coral Triangle Initiative, including Regional 
Secretariat in Indonesia 
- NOAA's engagement on the joint exploration visit 
- USDOJ Marine Law Enforcement capacity building 
- 2009 Jakarta 1473 proposal for fish/food security center (needs 
funding) 
- USAID grants for climate change adaptation and disaster 
preparedness 
 
LUS = Land Use 
-------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) This is the most critical area for reducing green house 
gases in Indonesia, 80% of which comes from forestry/land-use. 
Indonesia is the third largest global emitter and a country with the 
third largest tract of tropical forest in the world.  Of its 
domestic mitigation emissions reduction target of 26%, Indonesia is 
targeting 14% from forestry and peat. 
 
Potential U.S. activities for inclusion: 
 
- USAID Jakarta Forest Program 
- 1st (concluded) and 2nd (in process) Tropical Forest Conservation 
Act agreements 
- USAID Orangutan habitat conservation program 
- New work on Peat Lands (TBD) 
- Policy engagement, particularly on REDD+ 
- Donor coordination with focus on REDD+ 
- USTR-led illegal logging cooperation 
- USAID mitigation and adaptation grants including food security 
- Fish and Wildlife Service grants 
- Other U.S.-supported international work (World Bank Forest Carbon 
Partnership, RAFT, etc.) 
 
I = Industry 
------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) If Indonesia does not move on to a low carbon growth 
strategy, this fourth most populous nation will see its future 
emissions from industrial output and energy eclipse those from 
forests and land-use within the next two decades. 
 
Potential U.S. activities for inclusion: 
 
- USAID Clean Energy Program 
- EPA's $450,000 "Breathe Easy, Jakarta" clean air program 
- EPA collaboration on GHG inventories, pollution, waste 
- Multilateral Clean Technology Fund 
- USAID climate adaptation support with water utilities 
- Industrial and/or science cooperation on developing geothermal 
resources
