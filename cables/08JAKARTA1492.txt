¶1.  (U) Summary:  The Embassy Science Fellow program has been a 
valuable asset for Post, providing insight into the priorities of 
the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (DKP), and showing that 
DKP is open to advice about on how to make its organization more 
effective.  Minister Numberi has committed to take specific steps 
based on Science Fellow's recommendations, including restructuring 
the management of the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) in order to 
strengthen the planning and implementation of a national CTI 
program.  Embassy Science Fellow explored ways in which to achieve 
the goals of the MOU between DKP and NOAA, an important vehicle for 
advancing our bilateral cooperation.  Using the World Ocean 
Conference (May 2009) as a vehicle to engage DKP could further 
enhance the benefits of our collaboration.  End Summary. 
 
NOAA-DKP MOU an Important Vehicle for Moving Forward 
 
¶2.  (U) NOAA Embassy Science Fellow Dr. Mary Baker recently met with 
Minister Freddy Numberi and officials of the Ministry of Marine 
Affairs and Fisheries (DKP) -- including Widi Agoes Pratikto 
(Secretary General) and Dr. Sunggul Sinaga (Director for 
International Cooperation).  She reviewed and discussed 
recommendations for achieving the goals of the MOU signed by DKP and 
NOAA in September 2007.  These recommendations were derived during 
six weeks of extensive discussions with managers and staff at DKP to 
evaluate their priorities, plans, and ongoing programs. 
 
¶3.  (U) During discussions, it clearly emerged that decentralization 
of authority from the national to the provincial and district level 
has created challenges for DKP.  Coastal communities are pressured 
by increased food and fuel prices, and by effects caused by global 
climate change (Ref B).  Discussions with Directors-General and 
staff identified several priorities for implementation of the MOU 
and continued partnership with NOAA (Ref A).  Capacity building, 
training, and educational exchanges are priorities for all parts of 
DKP, and are specifically mentioned in the MOU.  Other issues raised 
by DKP staff included: 
 
-- Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI):  DKP is providing international 
leadership of the CTI by hosting the regional secretariat.  There is 
no separate organization to develop and implement a national CTI 
program, which must be developed before May 2009 when implementation 
of the initiative begins.  This may leave the impression that the 
program is not fully supported. 
 
-- The Sea Partnership Program (SPP) is specifically mentioned in 
Law 27/2007 on Coastal Zone and Small Islands Management as an 
implementation arm for the Ministry.  However, its mission and goals 
remain somewhat unfocused, and the program is lack in project 
funding.  The private sector has not been engaged nationally. 
 
DKP Open and Responsive to USG Suggestions 
 
¶4.  (U) In response to these issues, Dr. Baker recommended elevating 
management of CTI and the Sea Partnership program to the Secretary 
General level.  This would give the programs a broader perspective, 
and would allow the Planning Bureau to make connections between 
needs and capacities, and to oversee projects that serve the 
interests of multiple Directorates Generals (DGs) and Bureaus.  Dr. 
Baker also conveyed some specific recommendations to implement the 
CTI using the Sea Partnership Program and to clarify and strengthen 
the goals and implementation of the programs. 
 
¶5.  (U) Minister Numberi agreed to consider several specific actions 
to implement these recommendations.  He reiterated the importance of 
demonstrating Indonesia's accomplishments under the Coral Triangle 
Initiative, and agreed to restructure management of the CTI within 
DKP.  He will also identify DG-specific needs in capacity building 
and for program integration, and will create a strategic plan for 
DKP for 2010 and beyond.  Minister Numberi expressed his desire for 
transparency and accountability in implementing CTI activities in 
Indonesia, and looks forward to a productive relationship with NOAA, 
USAID, and the rest of the USG.

Science Fellow Program Furthers US-Indonesia Collaboration 
 
¶6.  (U) NOAA will be developing next steps to support the MOU, based 
on Dr. Baker's work.  This would include assigning points of 
contact, creating NOAA working groups to work with the Ministry to 
focus further partnership, and determine whether a further 
implementation agreement will be developed.  NOAA's partnership will 
help inform DKP-USAID collaboration on CTI and other projects. 
USAID is committed to supporting the regional and national action 
plans under CTI.  USAID's Regional mission in Bangkok is now in the 
process of procuring services from NGOs and contractors for up to 
$40 million to support CTI. 
 
¶7.  (U) Minister Numberi will also create a strategic plan for DKP 
for 2010 and beyond -- a process that USG assistance is 
facilitating.  The USAID Jakarta Mission will provide the services 
of a well-qualified and -experienced team of people to perform a 
study for the institutional strengthening of DKP (Ref B).  USAID has 
discussed this with the Secretary General, and it will be tailored 
to fit the mutually-agreed needs of DKP.
