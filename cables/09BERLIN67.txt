¶1. (SBU) Per reftel request, after an initial investigation, 
we assess that ASC is a reliable recipient of United States 
Munitions List (USML) items.  We will conduct a site visit on 
March 3, 2009 to complete this investigation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ms. Renate Bay, ASC's Marketing and Customer 
Service Director, provided post on January 13, 2009 
documentation (via email) of a delivery notice of the 
Honeywell accelerometers (QTY 12) to Carl Zeiss Optronics 
GmbH.  The delivery notice is dated September 15, 2008 and 
contains all 12 serial numbers of the accelerometers. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Bay confirmed to EconOff that ASC has secure 
facilities, maintains proper accounting and understands all 
restrictions placed on USML items.  Bay stated that ASC 
always retains positive control over USML items.  She 
explained that as soon as ASC receives a USML item, they are 
immediately registered in ASC's system and checked according 
to individual serial numbers.  Then, the items are re-shipped 
to the end-user on the same day.  Bay added that "the only 
personnel that have access to the items are Mr. Bay, ASC's 
CEO, and myself." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ASC was founded in 2006 and is a producer of 
high-end, compact, environmentally ruggedized accelerometers. 
 In addition, ASC is the exclusive distributor of Honeywell 
accelerometers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.  ASC 
currently services customers worldwide in the United Kingdom, 
Italy, and Turkey.  According to their website, they will 
soon add France and Japan to their customer list.  Further 
information can be found on ASC's website at 
www.asc-sensors.de. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5.  (SBU) ASC was very responsive to all questions regarding 
this transaction.  They responded in a timely matter and 
appeared sincere about the careful handling of USML items. 
Their approach to ensuring positive handling of USML items is 
minimal in that they simply ship USML items to their 
customers on the same day they receive the items.  This 
practice minimizes the exposure of these items to potential 
third parties.  Post will conduct a site visit on the morning 
of March 3, 2008 and follow this cable up with and email 
response to Blue Lantern coordinator Tim Mazzarelli.
