REF: STATE 021473 
 
¶1. (SBU) On February 25, Embassy officers discussed Asian 
Development Bank issues with Ministry of Finance (MOF) 
International Department Director General Zheng Xiaosong and 
other MOF officials (septel).  Concerning safeguards in 
general, Zheng said the ADB should be more flexible and allow 
the use of domestic consultants in some countries, including 
China.  He said China opposes a "one size fits all" approach 
to safeguards, and noted that in some areas China's 
safeguards now are more stringent than those of the ADB. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 11, Embassy followed up with DG Zheng and 
conveyed reftel demarche.  Zheng did not provide any response 
beyond the points he made on February 25.
