OSCE COUNTERTERRORISM CONFERENCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 62142 
 
(U)  DCM and Russian DCM Sergey Simakin jointly delivered 
reftel demarche on May 17 to Stanislav Vidovic, head of the 
MFA's Security Policy Division.  Vidovic said that Slovenia 
would participate in the Counterterrorism conference and that 
its delegation would most likely be headed by Andrej 
Slapnicar, a Security Policy Division official heading the 
ESDP unit and responsible for COTER issues.  He also thought 
that the Slovenian delegation would include representatives 
from the Ministry of Defense and/or police, the intelligence 
agency, the Ministries of Justice and Finance, and perhaps an 
academic specialist.  Vidovic commented on the joint 
demarche, calling it unexpected and welcome.
