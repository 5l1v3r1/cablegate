SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN OPPOSITION ON STATUS OF TALKS WITH 
RULING PARTY 
 
 
Classified By: CHARGE MARK C. STORELLA FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) MP (and Sam Rainsy spouse) 
Saumura Tioulong -- please protect -- told us March 6 that PM 
Hun Sen recently offered to take opposition leader Sam Rainsy 
into the government as a deputy prime minister, possibly with 
broad authority over various ministries.  Rainsy reportedly 
declined, telling the PM that such a move would be "political 
suicide" for an opposition leader.  Instead, he suggested 
that Hun Sen appoint him to lead the anti-corruption 
commission that is to be established under new pending 
legislation.  She believes that the position would be a 
winner for the opposition as it would further burnish 
opposition anti-corruption credentials and would also have 
the effect of associating the party with attracting much 
needed foreign investment.  The two parties are already 
engaged in detailed negotiations on the proposal. 
 
¶2.  (C)  When asked why Hun Sen was proffering important 
posts to the SRP, Saumura said she believes the PM wants to 
pursue real reform and has difficulty leading it himself. She 
added that part of Hun Sen's motivation was likely that the 
CPP sees improved relations with the opposition as a means of 
improving relations with the U.S.  She said that the SRP has 
been playing on this and has even begun to filter back to Hun 
Sen that the SRP would actively work to promote a visit by 
the PM to Washington as early as next year if the PM followed 
through on his reform ideas.  (Note:  we pointed out to her 
that the SRP should be careful about making any such 
promises.) 
 
¶3.  (C)  On the recent decision of FUNCINPEC leader Prince 
Ranariddh to resign as president of the National Assembly, 
Saumura said that the FUNCINPEC party had been in decline 
since its original election victory in 1993.  Nevertheless, 
she said that the ruling CPP party had an interest in 
maintaining the shell of a FUNCINPEC structure in order to 
avoid a political crisis.  She said that the SRP expects the 
SRP to be the main beneficiary of former FUNCINPEC votes at 
the 2007 local and 2008 national elections. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Comment:  Political events in Phnom Penh continue to 
develop in a rapid and positive direction.  The prospect of 
an opposition-led anti-corruption commission was unthinkable 
only a few weeks ago.  While we have cautioned SRP about 
promising any visits to Washington, if concrete progress were 
made on important democratic reforms, at some point such a 
proposal could be used to further the political reform 
process along.  End Comment.
