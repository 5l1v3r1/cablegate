SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE - GOZ SUSPENDS CARE ACTIVITIES 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) After months of harassment of the non-governmental 
organization (NGO) CARE's staff by "war veterans," military and 
other officials, Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) Minister Nicholas 
Goche informed CARE on May 28 to immediately suspend its operations. 
 Goche accused CARE staff of meddling in political activities 
favoring the opposition, and said CARE would be suspended until 
investigations were completed.  CARE is pursuing further 
clarification regarding terms of the suspension and the 
investigation process, but it seems clear the suspension will last 
at least until the Presidential run-off election scheduled for June 
¶27.  CARE believes, based on the Minister's comments that he intends 
to suspend other NGOs as well.  This comes at a time when CARE and 
other NGOs have been trying to meet acute humanitarian needs of 
thousands of people displaced by political violence and 
intimidation. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (U) CARE has been providing assistance to Zimbabwe for many 
years, and has been one of the major players in responding to the 
humanitarian crisis that has existed since 2002.  CARE receives 
funding from several donors, including support from USAID's Office 
of Food for Peace`}T-poxn for Democratic Change (MDC) won the majority of seats in 
the March 29 parliamentary elections.  Not surprisingly, these areas 
in Masvingo where MDC candidates won have been particularly hard hit 
by the post-election wave of violence. 
 
¶3.  (U) Shortly after the March 29 elections, in several separate 
incidents, CARE offices in various districts and at the provincial 
level in Masvingo received demands to stop operations and threats to 
staff by persons identifying themselves as "war veterans" and 
out-of-uniform military officers.  These people repeatedly made 
claims (unspecified and unsubstantiated) that CARE staff was 
engaging in political activities in support of the MDC, essentially 
scapegoating CARE for ZANU-PF's political defeats. 
 
¶4.  (U) To try to resolve the problem, CARE had several 
communications, through meetings and letters, with various GOZ 
officials over the past two months, including Masvingo Governor 
Chiwewe.  While Governor Chiwewe repeated the same vague allegations 
that CARE staff was engaging in political activities in support of 
the MDC, as recently as May 19, he sent CARE a letter stating that 
the GOZ had NOT stopped CARE's activities and would continue to 
support its programs.  However, two days later CARE was informed by 
a Department head within the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and 
Social Welfare (MPSLSW) that the issue had been taken up to Cabinet 
level and that CARE would need to meet with the MPSLSW Minister, 
Nicholas Goche.

MEETING WITH MINISTER GOCHE 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) On May 28, CARE met with Minister Goche.  Goche made several 
allegations against CARE: (1) that CARE had stopped activities 
before the elections (for political reasons); (2) that one of the 
GOZ vice presidents had shown him election campaign pamphlets that 
CARE was distributing; (3) that CARE told people that voting for 
ZANU-PF was "suicide"; and (4) that CARE had violated their MOU with 
the MPSLSW.  Goche then concluded that while these allegations were 
being looked into, all CARE operations would be suspended.  The 
Minister also told CARE that he planned to call other NGOs to a 
meeting to suspend their activities. 
 
-------------------------- 
FOLLOW-UP AND IMPLICATIONS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) CARE FOLLOW-UP:  CARE intends to write a letter to 
Minister Goche seeking to clarify:  (1) the terms of the suspension 
(e.g., permissible levels of field presence and staff movement), and 
(2) the investigation process (e.g., timeframes and what CARE can do 
to expedite the process).  CARE also plans to raise the issue 
through the UN channel to seek support.  At this point CARE is not

¶7.  (SBU) UNHC FOLLOW-UP:  The CARE issue was raised by the UN 
Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) at a UN/Donors Group Meeting on May 
¶29.  The HC also reported that the Minister planned to call a few 
other NGOs to a meeting on June 2 and suspend their activities as 
well.  The HC listed specific NGOs that would be targeted, although 
this was based on speculation and not on information provided by 
Goche.  These NGOs included SCF/UK, Concern, Plan International, 
Oxfam and World Vision.  (NOTE: To date, we have no reports of other 
NGOs being summoned. END NOTE.)  Finally, the HC assured donors that 
he would take the issue up with the GOZ at the highest level 
necessary. 
 
¶8.  (U) FIELD IMPACTS:  The USAID-supported CARE activities affected 
include school feeding, institutional feeding, and food-for-assets 
projects.  Other donor-funded activities put on hold include 
agricultural support programs, home-based care, OVC activities, 
water/sanitation, and micro-credit.  CARE was also part of a joint 
response to address recent acute needs of people displaced by 
political violence and intimidation.  CARE did not have plans to do 
large-scale food distribution (Vulnerable Group Feeding) until 
August so this area is not impacted for the moment by the GOZ's 
actions.
