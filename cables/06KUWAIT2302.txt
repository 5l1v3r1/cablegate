-- Mohamed Bin Ibrahim Al-Shibany commented in the progressive 
Arabic daily Al-Qabas under the title "Al-Zarqawi Film" (6/15): "If 
Hollywood's directors work for years to produce a film which costs 
ten of millions of dollars or possibly hundreds of million and the 
film receives Oscars, why is the Central Intelligence Agency unable 
to produce a film about September 11 to convince the world that Bin 
Laden did it?  Or, it could produce many films for Al-Zarqawi, Bin 
Laden, Al-Zawahri, and others...?  Do you not see our condition? 
Only God knows how long it may continue.  Yes, America will produce 
many films in the near future, the greatest of which will be that of 
the assassination of bin Laden and Al-Zawahri....  Examine the 
statements made by American officials and the manner in which 
Al-Zarqawi was assassinated and the photos and films that appeared 
afterwards and you will realize that this film is good enough to be 
shown in American theaters; not here though, because these films are 
produced for the ignorant and the stupid." 
 
-- Hasan Ali Karam noted in the moderate Arabic daily Al-Watan under 
the title "Kuwaiti Extremists" (6/15): "It is no wonder that a 
handful of Kuwaiti Islamic fundamentalists are saddened by the 
killing of the Jordanian criminal Abu Musaab Al-Zarqawi in Iraq.... 
The danger of this abnormal way of thinking is that it not only 
endangers those who think it, but it also reaches to the security, 
stability, and unity of society.  The question is not how to protect 
society from the dangers of this way of thinking?  The question is 
how do we return these young men to their senses and how do we 
correct the wrong satanic notions and ideas that they have?" 
 
-- In the moderate Arabic daily Al-Watan Kamal Ali Al-Kharas 
contended in under the title "Al-Zarqawi's Death, a Nation's Crisis" 
(6/15): "The death of Abu Musaab Al-Zarqawi revealed the depth of 
the crisis in which the Arab nations are in on the ideological, 
psychological, and moral levels which translate into a political 
crisis....  It is a psychological problem when certain people of 
[the Islamic] nation who are sick lead political movements and 
represent our nation in its parliaments.  It is an ideological 
crisis where there are politicians in this nation who have such sick 
and shallow ideas.  It is a moral crisis when politicians and 
parliamentarian adopt the ideas of murders and justify their 
actions.  Lastly, it is a political crisis when those who know 
nothing about the art of politics oppose political efforts of the 
nation."
