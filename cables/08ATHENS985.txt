¶1.  (C) DCM spoke July 10 with MFA Secretary General 
Agathocles to inquire about the Greek position on the EU 
package of measures to implement UNSCR 1803; DCM said that we 
understood many in the EU were supportive of a common 
position with robust measures, but that Greece and a few 
others were expressing skepticism.  The DCM underscored the 
importance of increasing the financial pressure on Iran, and 
asked for Greece to look carefully and positively in Brussels 
at a more robust package of measures.  Agathocles said that 
Greece "will not block consensus on this issue," and will 
follow whatever emerges in Brussels.  He added, however, that 
the recent story in the "New York Times" citing U.S. Pentagon 
sources that a recent joint Greek-Israeli military exercise 
had been meant by Israel to be a warning to Iran (ref C), 
made Greece "more cautious" in its Iran policy.  Agathocles 
added that Greece had some specific problems with some of the 
items in the proposed EU package, citing provisions related 
to "ship searches" and "banks."  That said, he reiterated 
that the Greek EU Mission has instructions not to impede any 
EU consensus, should one emerge. 
 
¶2.  (C) A/Pol Counselor followed up with MFA Iran Desk 
Officer Gregory Karahailos.  Karahailos confirmed that the 
Greek MFA had "just completed" a review of its policy on this 
issue with Agathocles, and that the instructed position to 
the Greek Mission in Brussels was "not to push, but not to 
block any consensus."  Greece is of two minds -- it is 
concerned about Iranian activities, but is not convinced that 
further sanctions will have any meaningful effect. 
Karahailos added that some in the GOG questioned whether it 
would be "wise" to agree to sanctions that go beyond the UNSC 
resolution.  However, Greece has now agreed it "can agree to 
this, should that be the EU consensus."  Karahailos added, 
frankly, that we should not expect Greece to do much more 
than be passive in this debate. Karahailos also clarified 
that Greece does have "a problem" with provisions in the 
package that would allow for "unscheduled inspections" of 
ships.  Citing the importance and influence of the Greek 
shipowners, Karahailos said Greece has concerns with these 
provisions, as they could lead to shipping delays, resulting 
in additional costs and possibly even potential claims 
against the government.  A/Pol Counselor underscored the 
robust steps the U.S. has taken to implement 1803, reiterated 
the importance of the EU doing the same, and emphasized our 
request that Greece actively support an EU decision on a 
robust package of measures.
