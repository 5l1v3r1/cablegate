E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETTC KOMC CA
SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050113948 
 
REF: 06 VANCOUVER 500 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050113948 for the export of 
firearms and magazines to Lebanon. Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: Paul Reibin (dba Range Sports 
Unlimited, Tel: 250-372-7030) was suspected of exporting 
United State Munitions List (USML) items to Canada without 
proper authorization and was subsequently subject to an 
unfavorable Blue Lantern pre-license check in 2006 (ref). 
When questioned, Mr. Reibin was evasive and could not produce 
documentation regarding his business activities. Post could 
not establish the bona fides of Paul Reibin at that time. 
This check seeks to establish if Mr. Reibin has proven 
himself a bona fide recipient of USML in the interim. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of this end-user and transaction by making appropriate 
inquires with law enforcement officials and representatives 
of the company. 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
