SUBJECT: (S/REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL)  REQUEST FOR 
INFORMATION ON TURKEY,S NUCLEAR INTEREST (C-WP9-00234) 
 
REF: A. ANKARA 111 
     ¶B. ANKARA 113 
     ¶C. STATE 127423 
 
Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIR., INR/OPS.  REASON:  1.4(C). 
 
¶1.  (C/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS ARE INTERESTED IN CLOSELY MONITORING ANY TURKISH PROGRESS TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NUCLEAR ENERGY PROGRAM, AND APPRECIATE POST'S CONTINUED REPORTING (FOR EXAMPLE IN REFTELS A AND B) ON TURKEY'S INTEREST IN NUCLEAR POWER. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF)  ANALYSTS CONSIDER TURKEY TO BE AN 
"OVER-THE-HORIZON" NUCLEAR CONCERN AND ROUTINELY RESPOND TO SENIOR POLICYMAKERS' QUESTIONS ON ANKARA'S NUCLEAR INTENT AND CAPABILITIES.  ALTHOUGH ANALYSTS JUDGE THAT ANKARA DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM, WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITS POLICY ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT AS A RESULT OF ANKARA'S PERCEIVED THREATS FROM SERIOUS REGIONAL INSTABILITY AND/OR THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY OTHER NATIONS IN THE REGION. 
 
¶3.  (U)  ANALYSTS WOULD READ WITH GREAT INTEREST ANY 
REPORTING POSTS CAN PROVIDE ON THE TOPICS BELOW, AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT.  ANALYSTS ARE AWARE OF EARLIER REQUESTS (REF C) AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION FROM IAEA DATABASES AND OPEN LITERATURE, AND ARE MOST INTERESTED IN SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION THAT CAN BE ACQUIRED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM POST CONTACTS. 
 
¶A.  (U/SBU)  NUCLEAR ENERGY PLANS 
 
1)  (U/SBU)  WHAT FACTORS DRIVE TURKISH LEADERS' DECISION TO DEVELOP A CIVILIAN NUCLEAR ENERGY PROGRAM?  WHAT ROLE DOES IRAN'S POSSIBLE PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS PLAY IN THIS CALCULUS?  DO TURKISH LEADERS PERCEIVE AN INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE THREAT POSED BY IRAN? 
 
2)  (U/SBU)  WHAT TYPE OF NUCLEAR POWER-RELATED TECHNOLOGY IS TURKEY SEEKING TO DEVELOP INDIGENOUSLY OR WITH FOREIGN ASSISTANCE?  HOW MANY REACTORS IS TURKEY PLANNING TO BUILD? INCLUDE THE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF ANY PLANNED REACTORS, INCLUDING DESIGN PARAMETERS, FUEL TYPE, MWE CAPACITY, AND LOCATION. 
 
3)  (U/SBU)  WHAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY/EXPERTISE TRANSFER WILL BE INVOLVED IN ANY NUCLEAR POWER-RELATED TENDER AGREEMENTS? DOES TURKEY PLAN ON DEVELOPING URANIUM OR THORIUM MINING/EXTRACTION OPERATIONS, CONVERSION/FUEL FABRICATION FACILITIES, ENRICHMENT CAPABILITIES, AND/OR WASTE MANAGEMENT/REPROCESSING FACILITIES TO SUPPORT ITS NUCLEAR POWER INITIATIVE? 
 
4)  (U/SBU)  WHAT EFFORTS, IF ANY, HAS TURKEY TAKEN TO 
ESTABLISH A NUCLEAR REGULATORY INFRASTRUCTURE TO MANAGE ITS FUTURE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT OPERATIONS? 
 
5)  (C/REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL)  DESCRIBE HOW THE IAEA IS INVOLVED IN TURKEY'S QUEST TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR ENERGY. DOES TURKEY PLAN TO APPLY FOR OR BEGIN WORKING ON IAEA TECHNICAL COOPERATION PROJECTS?  ARE THERE ANY ONGOING TECHNICAL COOPERATION PROJECTS OR CONSULTATIONS?  ARE THERE ANY OUTSTANDING SAFEGUARDS CONCERNS OR TURKISH ATTEMPTS TO 
DECEIVE SAFEGUARD INSPECTORS? 
 
6)  (C/REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL)  WHAT IS THE BUDGET 
FOR THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR POWER ACTIVITIES?  PLEASE PROVIDE A DETAILED BREAKDOWN, IF POSSIBLE.  HOW DOES THIS BUDGET COMPARE TO BUDGETS IN THE PAST?  ARE THERE ANY CHANGES PLANNED FOR FUTURE BUDGETS?  WHICH ENTITIES WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY CONTROL THE BUDGET FOR NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES? 
 
7)  (U/SBU)  WILL TURKEY CONTINUE TO PURSUE COMMERCIAL 
NUCLEAR POWER DEVELOPMENT OR ARE THERE FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD IT TO ABANDON ITS PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR ENERGY?  IF SO, WHAT ARE THESE FACTORS? 
 
8)  (U/SBU)  DOES TURKEY HAVE ANY INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN ANY PLANS TO DEVELOP A MIDDLE EASTERN CONSORTIUM TO DEVELOP A URANIUM ENRICHMENT CAPABILITY? 
 
¶B.  (U/SBU)  NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES 
 
1)  (U/SBU)  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF NUCLEAR INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY, AND RESEARCH IN TURKEY? 
 
2)  (U/SBU)  WHO ARE THE KEY SCIENTIFIC LEADERS IN TURKEY? 
WHAT TYPE OF RESEARCH DO THEY CONDUCT? DO THEY TRAVEL TO INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OR STUDY ABROAD? 
 
3)  (U/SBU)  HOW SKILLED IS TURKEY'S POOL OF LABOR?  IS 
TURKEY PLANNING TO INCREASE THE SKILL LEVEL OF ITS SCIENTISTS TO SUPPORT NUCLEAR POWER OR RELY ON FOREIGN EXPERTISE? 
REPORT ANY ATTEMPTS BY TURKEY TO ESTABLISH A TRAINED CADRE OF NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, AND TECHNICIANS, INCLUDING THE TRAINING OF TURKISH NATIONALS AT FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES AND THE RECRUITMENT OF FOREIGN NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS AND TECHNICIANS. 
 
4)  (U/SBU)  WHAT NUCLEAR-RELATED RESEARCH HAS THE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED IN UNIVERSITY LABORATORIES OR PRIVATE LABORATORIES IN TURKEY OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES? 
 
5)  (U/SBU)  DESCRIBE ALL TURKISH ATTEMPTS AT ACQUIRING 
NUCLEAR-RELATED MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, TECHNOLOGY AND EXPERTISE.  REPORT TURKISH CONTACTS WITH NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS AND/OR ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH BILATERAL NUCLEAR ASSISTANCE AGREEMENTS. 
 
6)  (C/REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL)  WILL TURKEY 
PROLIFERATE ANY PORTION OF ITS NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY?  WHAT NUCLEAR-RELATED ITEMS OR EQUIPMENT DOES TURKEY EXPORT?  TO WHOM DO THEY EXPORT? 
 
7)  (U/SBU)  WITH WHICH COUNTRIES OR FOREIGN ENTITIES DOES TURKEY SHARE NUCLEAR EXPERTISE?  WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS EXCHANGE (I.E., SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGE PROGRAMS BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES IN THE TWO COUNTRIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT AGREEMENTS)?  IF TURKEY DOES NOT CURRENTLY SHARE NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY, WHAT PORTIONS, IF ANY, ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR SHARING, WITH WHOM, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS? 
 
¶4.  (U)  PLEASE CITE C-WP9-00234 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
