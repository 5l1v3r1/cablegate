SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: RECALL OF PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI-BIAN 
 
 
¶1. Summary:  Major Chinese-language Taiwan dailies continued to 
center their reporting June 23 on the KMT's and PFP's plans to oust 
President Chen Shui-bian, and further investigations into the 
alleged role of First Lady Wu Shu-chen in the Sogo Department Store 
ownership case and an earlier political contribution controversy. 
News coverage also focused on the controversy over whether the 
government will lose its majority to major private shareholders on 
the board of directors of a local financial holding company Friday, 
and a local train accident-turned-murder case.  The pro-independence 
"Liberty Times," Taiwan's biggest daily, ran a banner headline on 
page two that read "Bian Criticizes Current Chaos:  Something That 
Should Happen in 2008 Has Happened Now."  The newspaper also ran a 
news story on page two with the headline "Ma Calls for 'People to 
Determine' Whether Bian Should Stay Go." 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials, the "Liberty Times" continued to 
criticize the pan-Blue camp's recall of President Chen, saying the 
move will only trigger political upheavals and is doomed to fail. 
An editorial in the limited-circulation, pro-independence, 
English-language "Taiwan News" said KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's 
speech Wednesday evening revealed his true intention to cause a 
power struggle.  End summary. 
 
A) "Scrutinize the KMT Behind Chairman Ma's Quibbling" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 600,000] 
editorialized (6/23): 
 
"... Ever since the transfer of political power in 2000, the 
pan-Blue camp has, on one hand, started to boycott the government's 
administration in the Legislature, and on the other hand, it has 
seized every opportunity it can to take to the streets.  Such 
behaviors failed to win the support of a majority of Taiwan people, 
so [the pan-Blue camp] was defeated again in the 2004 presidential 
elections.  This time, the pan-Blue camp launched a recall motion, 
citing reasons like President Chen Shui-bian having violated the 
Constitution and having engaged in corruption, but such a move is 
doomed to fail again.  In fact, moves like a recall motion, a 
no-confidence vote, or street demonstrations will only trigger 
political upheavals, benefit a few aggressive politicians, or even 
offer China an opportunity to take advantage of Taiwan.  If Chairman 
Ma really loves Taiwan, he should stop what he is doing now, call a 
halt to the recall mockery, and supervise the KMT legislators to 
reasonably review the appointments of Control Yuan members and the 
State Public Prosecutor-General and bills concerning flood control 
and arms procurements.  He should use actions to demonstrate his 
love for Taiwan, which will definitely touch the Taiwan people more 
than a beautiful speech." 
 
B) "Ma Reveals Recall Is Power Struggle" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" [circulation: 
20,000] editorialized (6/23): 
 
"Kuomintang Party Chairman Ma Ying-jeou protested vigorously in a 
televised speech Wednesday evening that the recall motion against 
President Chen Shui-bian was not a 'power struggle' but an effort to 
cleanse and 'save' Taiwan's democracy.  We naturally agree with the 
latter goal, but believe that the actions and statements made during 
this recall drive by Ma, People First Party Chairman James Soong and 
the legislators of their respective parties have provided ample 
reason to gravely doubt their sincerity.  Ma's response to Chen's 
'report to the people' was marred by poor delivery, but its most 
important failing was its transparent duplicity and caviler 
treatment of fact, including distortions and misrepresentations of 
matters such as Taiwan's economic performance under the DPP 
government. ...  We advice Ma to consider taking refresher courses 
in law and democratic theory before considering to run for 
president."
