"Tony Blair's Debacle" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo 
editorialized (5/12): "Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that he 
will not conclude his third term at a moment when only 22% of Brits 
declare trust in him. This has nothing to do with the unsteadiness 
of popular sentiment.  Blair can only blame himself for his debacle, 
more exactly of deserving the nickname of Bush's poodle. Not only as 
a result of his amazing and as of yet unexplained explained 
subservience to the worst of what the US has ever produced in terms 
of presidents and foreign policy, but also because he involved the 
UK in the insane war in Iraq and his government imitated his ally on 
the other side of the Atlantic in disseminating untruths about the 
danger represented by Saddam Hussein's imaginary arsenal of mass 
destruction and links with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda."
