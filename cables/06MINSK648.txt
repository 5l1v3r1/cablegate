¶1. (U) On June 16, on-line Sudanese newspaper the Sudan Tribune 
announced that Sudanese Defense Minister General Abdelrahim Mohamed 
Hussein signed a military cooperation protocol with his Belarusian 
counterpart Leonid Maltsev on June 15 in Minsk.  The article 
claimed Hussein was in Belarus June 13 to 15 for talks with the 
Belarusian Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs.  The military 
cooperation protocol reportedly covers "training, exchange of 
experiences, and military science fields."  The paper claimed the 
Belarusian side hoped to boost its exports to Sudan, especially of 
tractors, and to play a role in developing Sudanese oil fields. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Belarusian government made no announcements of any 
cooperation protocol.  No GOB body, including the MFA, MOD, or 
state news agency BelTA, even mentioned that a Sudanese delegation 
was in Minsk.  [Note: Poloff by chance directly observed Defense 
Minister Maltsev entertaining the Sudanese delegation at a Minsk 
restaurant.  Maltsev was accompanied by a senior military officer, 
and, according to the license plates on the vehicles, officials 
from the BKGB.] 
 
¶3. (U) The Sudan Tribune article also stated that Belarus has 
exported weapons to Sudan since 1996, and provided the following 
list of arms sold: 
 
1996: nine T-55 tanks; 
1997: six Mi-24B attack helicopters; 
2003: nine BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, 39 BRDM-2 armored 
reconnaissance vehicles, 16 D-30 howitzer guns, 10 Gvodzdika self- 
propelled howitzers, six Grad multiple rocket launders; 
2004: 21 BRDM-2 armored reconnaissance vehicles, seven BTR-70 
armored personnel carriers, one BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Post believes that such a deal was signed.  The 
GOB has long sought to increase cooperation among the world's 
outcast nations, to counter pressure from both the West and now 
from Russia.  The Belarusian Foreign Minister visited Khartoum in 
early February, where he signed a number of agreements on 
scientific, agricultural, and commercial cooperation.  Minsk has 
also been actively building ties with Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North 
Korea (which has a delegation coming to Minsk June 26 to 30). 
Belarus is possibly keeping this new agreement quiet, given the 
UNSC sanctions on Sudan.  Normally the GOB trumpets such agreements 
as further "evidence" Belarus is not internationally isolated. 
Post also has reason to believe Minsk is still supplying military 
equipment to Khartoum (reftel).
