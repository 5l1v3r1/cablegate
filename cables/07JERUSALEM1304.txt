REF: JERUSALEM 1296 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Imports into Gaza remain mostly limited to 
humanitarian shipments.  After Kerem Shalom crossing closed 
early June 25 due to mortar fire, WFP shipments of sugar, 
flour, and oil were diverted and passed through Sufa 
crossing.  Gaza hospitals are all operational despite 
run-down facilities and equipment.  End summary. 
 
Kerem Shalom Closed; 
Animal Feed Arrives 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) WFP Spokesperson Kirstie Campbell told Econoff June 
25, and Gaza-based USAID and OCHA staff confirmed, that Kerem 
Shalom was closed at 0945 hours June 25 after mortar shells 
were fired at the crossing.  As a result, WFP diverted 11 
truckloads of food aid (sugar, flour, and oil), which moved 
into Gaza via the Sufa crossing.  WFP shipped nine truckloads 
of food aid through Kerem Shalom June 24.  WFP estimates that 
150 truckloads of food aid are needed each day to meet Gaza's 
food needs.  Campbell said that 52 truckloads of animal feed 
were shipped by Gaza companies through Sufa crossing into 
Gaza June 23. 
 
No Damage at Karni/al-Mintar 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Gaza-based USAID staff visited Karni/al-Mintar 
crossing June 24 and reported that there appeared to be no 
damage to the crossing's infrastructure from recent violence. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Gaza-based OCHA representative Hamada al-Raiz told 
Econoff that Nahal Oz fuel transfer station remained open 
June 25, while Karni/al-Mintar and Rafah crossings remain 
closed.  Erez continues to be open to limited numbers of NGO 
staff and light ICRC medical shipments June 25. 
 
Gaza Hospital Infrastructure 
and Equipment Dilapidated 
------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Gaza-based WHO National Health officer Mahmoud 
Daher told Econoff June 25 that all Gaza hospitals are 
operating June 25, but with dilapidated equipment and a lack 
of parts, surgical kits, and laundry services.  He said that 
Gaza City's Al Quds Hospital opened June 24 for certain 
outpatient surgical operations, but inpatient services remain 
unavailable.  Daher said that the Gaza City Dar al-Shifa 
Hospital's main operating theater lacks light bulbs. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) ICRC Spokesperson Bernard Barrett told Econoff June 
25 that ICRC shipped a truckload of medicine and disposables 
through Kerem Shalom June 24 and that two ICRC-sponsored 
Gazans were transferred through Erez crossing June 23 for 
treatment in Israeli hospitals.
