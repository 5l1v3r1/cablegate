SUBJECT: SOMALIA: LETTER FROM TFG PRESIDENT YUSUF TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONTACT GROUP 
 
REF: NAIROBI 2326 
 
¶1.  Per reftel, we followed up with the Somalia Embassy in Nairobi 
and received the attached letter from TFG President Yusuf to the 
International Contact Group meeting in London. 
 
¶2.  Text of letter: 
 
Honorable Representatives of the Contact Group: 
 
I wish to express my appreciation for the support of the 
International Contact Group for achieving peace and stability in 
Somalia.  Though I could not be with you, I have sent my Foreign 
Minister to demonstrate the importance I attach to this meeting. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Contact Group of 
the following: 
 
I and the entire Transitional Federal Government are working 
extremely hard to promote national reconciliation.  In support of 
that process, I have been meeting constantly with all of the clans 
and sub-clans in Somalia, including Hawiye sub-clans. I believe that 
all Somalis who reject violence and terrorism should participate in 
the reconciliation process. 
 
I fully support the holding of the National Reconciliation Congress 
as scheduled in mid-June.  In that regard, I support the efforts of 
Ali Mahdi and his National Reconciliation Committee to hold the 
Congress, with the selection of delegates to be made by the clans 
themselves through the 4.5 formula as laid-out by the independent 
National Reconciliation Committee. 
 
In order to hold the Congress, funding is urgently needed from the 
international community.  I appeal to all of you to provide the 
necessary support immediately. 
 
In addition, I wish to emphasize that my government will continue to 
work closely with international organizations and institutions to 
facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance. 
 
The assassination attempt against Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi 
and other violence that is occurring in Mogadishu reflect the 
efforts of terrorists and radicals to disrupt the Somali 
reconciliation process. 
 
We are determined that these efforts will not be allowed to succeed. 
 With the support of the Contact Group, national reconciliation will 
marginalize these radicals and terrorists.  We will not be deterred 
from the goal of achieving national reconciliation and call on the 
Contact Group to demonstrate its support for the legitimate 
institutions of the Transitional Federal Government. 
 
I wish to thank the Government of Ethiopia and the African Union, 
particularly through the deployment of Ugandan forces for AMISOM, 
for their continuing support. 
 
I look forward to remaining in close contact with all of you as we 
work together to pursue our shared goal of building peace and 
stability in Somalia. 
 
Please accept the assurance of my highest esteem and consideration. 
 
Signed June 6, 2007 by H.E. President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed 
Transitional Federal Government of the Republic of Somalia
