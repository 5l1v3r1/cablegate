SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR BROWNFIELD'S DECEMBER 19 MEETING WITH 
COLOMBIAN SENATE PRESIDENT NANCY GUTIERREZ 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William R. Brownfield Reason: 1.4(b,d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Senate President Nancy Patricia Gutierrez 
told the Ambassador there is much support for the United 
States and the bilateral Free Trade Agreement in the 
Colombian Congress.  She criticized opposition party members 
who attack the Uribe administration and the United States, 
but do not offer constructive alternatives to address 
Colombia's problems. Gutierrez said some Colombians felt the 
USG was only preoccupied with its own hostages.  She 
appreciated the institutional-building efforts made during 
Congressman David Price's visit in August, but encouraged 
more exchanges to enhance relations between the Colombian and 
U.S. Congress.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Senate President Nancy Patricia Gutierrez (Cambio 
Radical party) told the Ambassador on December 19 she would 
like to strengthen institutional relations, including more 
exchanges and visits, with the U.S. Congress. She expressed 
appreciation for Congressman David Price's visit to Bogota in 
August to fortify these efforts. Gutierrez stressed that 
despite opposition criticism of the United States, most 
Colombian legislators recognize the importance of U.S. 
support for Plan Colombia and want closer bilateral ties. 
 
¶3.  (C) Gutierrez judged that Senator Piedad Cordoba was 
using the media and political allies in Washington to put 
pressure on President Uribe.  It would have been more 
appropriate if Cordoba had made her public accusations that a 
senior GOC officials had threatened to kill her to the 
Colombian Congress or security forces instead of during her 
visit to Washington.  Gutierrez also criticized Senator 
Gustavo Petro (opposition Polo Democratico Alternativo party) 
for fanning anti-free trade and anti-Uribe flames during his 
trips to Washington. 
 
¶4.  (C) The Senate president said some analysts accuse the 
USG of only being concerned about the three Americans held by 
the Revoluationary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and not 
the Colombian hostages.  The Ambassador assured her we hope 
for the release of all hostages, regardless of nationality. 
He also underscored USG acceptance of various channels to 
reach a humanitarian solution and viewed positively the roles 
played by Latin American and European leaders, as well as the 
Catholic Church, as long as they enjoy GOC support. The USG 
will continue to back GOC efforts to obtain the hostages' 
release. 
 
¶5.  (C) On the proposed bill regarding the legal status of 
18,000 demobilized paramilitary, Gutierrez doubted it could 
pass in the new year, even with modifications. There was no 
motivation to approve it.  If the GOC presents a new 
proposal, Congress would consider it. She said some Congress 
members feel uneasy about overstepping the authority of the 
Supreme Court and getting pulled into a legal battle between 
the Court and President Uribe.  The bill responded to a July 
Supreme Court ruling which left the legal status of 18,000 
rank-and-file paramilitaries in limbo. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Gutierrez expressed concerns over language on 
intellectual property laws in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), 
but agreed the FTA was both economically and politically 
important for bilateral relations.  She said she would be 
happy to meet with visiting Congressional delegations and 
hoped to visit Washington in the near future.
