 ¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The GOI is hoping to use an existing 
health grouping to pull together a meeting of health 
ministers to coordinate regional preparations on avian 
influenza.  The Turkish Health Minister reportedly has agreed 
to host such a gathering.  GOI officials hope that there can 
be some USG representation if such a meeting takes place. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Executive Director of the Middle East Cancer 
Consortium (MECC) Michael Silbermann called on Ambassador 
Jones October 20.  Established in 1996, MECC is a partnership 
between the United States Department of Health and Human 
Services and the Health Ministries of Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, 
Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and Turkey.  Silbermann 
reported that the GOI Minister of Health was hoping to use 
MECC's existing links with the health ministries of member 
countries to quickly convene a meeting of health ministers to 
discuss common strategies for dealing with avian influenza. 
Silbermann said that likely venues would be Cyprus or Turkey, 
and that the Turkish Health Minister had offered to host such 
a meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ambassador noted that the WHO will be holding a 
meeting on avian influenza in Geneva November 7-9, and 
suggested that regional ministers might meet on the margins 
of that meeting, making it easier for U.S. officials to 
attend.  Silbermann noted that possibility, but also said 
that the GOI wanted to see an initial meeting of regional 
health ministers take place sooner.  (Note:  Jordanian and 
Israeli veterinary officials reportedly met October 20 to 
discuss avian flu preparations; Israeli and Palestinian 
officials may meet for the same purpose in the coming days. 
End note). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Silbermann commented that a meeting of health 
ministers would be useful even if not all MECC member 
countries attend.  He said he hoped that a representative of 
the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, such as the ESTH Officer, would 
be able to attend if the meeting takes place in Turkey. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  The GOI MOH is proposing to take advantage 
of MECC's existing network to help organize a regional 
strategy meeting on avian influenza.  This would not be a 
"MECC meeting," but rather a meeting on avian influenza of 
health ministers from MECC member countries.  We will report 
on developments as we receive updates from Silbermann and GOI 
officials.  While it's not yet clear whether this initiative 
will result in several countries in the region getting 
together around avian influenaz, the proposal appears worthy 
of our support.  End comment.
