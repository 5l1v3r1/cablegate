DESIGNATION OF SOMALI GROUP 
 
REF: STATE 30472 
 
¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission reviewed reftel points regarding 
the Somali terrorist group Al-Shabaab with the GOI on March 
¶25.  We noted that the USG had designated the group as a 
Foreign Terroist Organization and we urged other countries to 
take steps against the group.  The Indonesian side promised 
to review next steps on an interagency basis.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) On March 25, Poloff delivered reftel points to 
Aris Munandar, Deputy Director for Terrorism at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU).  Poloff noted that the 
USG had designated the Al-Shabaab organization located in 
Somalia as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and as a 
specially designated Global Terrorist.  Poloff urged the GOI 
to support the designation and take needed action.   Poloff 
also underscored that such designations are an important step 
in curtailing terrorist activity on an international basis. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Responding, Munandar remarked that the Indonesian 
government appreciated the thorough investigations that the 
USG undertakes before making such designations.   He also 
stated that the GOI takes the designation of terrorist groups 
seriously and will pass the information to the Indonesian 
National Police (INP) for further review.   Munandar 
explained that DEPLU sends these designations to the INP so 
it can process the information, and then the INP sends it to 
the Indonesian Central Bank for further review and action. 
This process takes time, and DEPLU will get back to the 
Mission on whether the GOI decides to proceed with any 
actions.
