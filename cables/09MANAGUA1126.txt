SUBJECT: Siutation Report 1: Hurricane Ida 
 
¶1. On November 4, 2009, the National Hurricane Center upgraded 
tropical depression 11 to tropical storm status. The tropical storm 
was located approximately 100 miles east of Bluefields, Nicaragua. 
By early November 5, the tropical storm was upgraded to category 1 
Hurricane status as it neared Nicaragua's eastern coast.  Hurricane 
Ida passed over the Corn Islands, moved north up the Atlantic 
Coast, making landfall near Sandy Bay on November 5.   The storm is 
expected to pass near the communities of Rosita, Siuna, and 
Bonanza, exiting through the Rio Coco into Honduras. 
 
 
 
¶2. As of Thursday afternoon, damage reports from the Corn Islands 
estimate 260 houses, four hotels and six boats were damaged; 
approximately 100 wells were contaminated. 
 
 
 
¶3. Civil Defense estimates that approximately 6,400 persons have 
been evacuated in the North and South Atlantic Autonomous Regions. 
 
 
 
 
¶4. USG ASSISTANCE.  A two-person USAID/OFDA team is currently in 
Managua.  They have met with Civil Defense and will remain in 
Managua for the next few days to collect more information and 
determine the most appropriate response. A third USAID/OFDA team 
member will travel to the Atlantic Coast to conduct damage 
assessments as weather permits.

time.
