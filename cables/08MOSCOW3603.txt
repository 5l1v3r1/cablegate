SUBJECT: INFO ON LACEY ACT AMENDMENTS DELIVERED 
 
REF:  STATE 126654 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) We shared reftel information on the recent amendments to 
the Lacey Act and the phased-in implementation of new U.S. import 
requirements for plant and wood products, with Russian officials in 
the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Economic Development, and Natural 
Resources and Ecology, and in the Forestry Service and Veterinary 
and Phytosanitary Surveillance Service (VPSS).  Natalya Lobachevo, a 
senior specialist from the VPSS Phytosanitary Surveillance and Grain 
Inspection Division, told us that VPSS was not surprised by the new 
import rules for plant and wood products, and she expected that 
other countries might adopt similar measures.  None of the other 
ministries or agencies offered any substantive comments on the Lacey 
Act amemdments and the new import rules.
