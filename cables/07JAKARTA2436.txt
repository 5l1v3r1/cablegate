Get on Board: ASEAN Charter, Economic Integration on Track 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) Scot Marciel underscored 
U.S. interest in ASEAN when he met August 27-28 with ASEAN Deputy 
Secretary General (DSG) Nicholas Dammen and Indonesian Foreign 
 
SIPDIS 
Ministry Director General for ASEAN Mr. Dian Triansyah Djani.  They 
both welcomed U.S. engagement and underscored that ASEAN is entering 
a qualitatively different era.  Both officials were certain that 
ASEAN will have a Charter ready for signature at the ASEAN Summit in 
Singapore in November.  DG Djani, however, noted that member 
countries are still deliberating over the Charter's chapter on ASEAN 
as an organization (structure, size, competencies).  DG Djani 
asserted that "now is the time to bet on ASEAN", both politically 
and economically, and that the E.U., Japan, and others were 
acknowledging this by negotiating FTAs with ASEAN.  Djani also 
asserted, "ASEAN is the cornerstone of Indonesia's foreign policy". 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) DSG Dammen confirmed that the ASEAN Economic Ministers 
Meeting finalized the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint for 
November) in Manila last week.  He noted that ASEAN has to be 
flexible during economic integration toward ASEAN's second tier 
countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam), but that any FTA has 
to include all 10 member countries.  Dammen commented that ASEAN 
would like an FTA with the U.S., which DAS Marciel noted would be a 
very difficult and detailed process if undertaken. When DAS Marciel 
asked whether ASEAN is interested in an Asia-Pacific FTA, Dammen 
informed him that ASEAN has not yet discussed the idea seriously. 
Dammen also suggested that negotiating current and future FTAs would 
help move ASEAN eventually to a customs union.  He acknowledged, 
however, that ASEAN first has to improve its overall investment 
climate, including for intra-ASEAN investment, for example in 
telecommunications. 
 
Let's Ramp up Dialogue: the Commemorative Summit and ICM 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Both officials wanted to know when and where the U.S.-ASEAN 
Commemorative Summit would take place.  DSG Dammen suggested that 
they preferred a U.S. location but emphasized that having the Summit 
is the most important thing (not the location).  DG Djani noted that 
the Summit would help maintain momentum in U.S.-ASEAN relations. 
They both emphasized the importance of people-to-people contacts, 
including through scholarship programs like the Fulbright.  DAS 
Marciel affirmed USG commitment to continue developing its 
substantive program of cooperation with ASEAN, and stressed that we 
are continuing to explore possible dates and locations for the 
Summit. 
 
Democracy in ASEAN, Burma 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) DAS Marciel praised the dynamism of the region as a whole 
(including progress on the Charter), with the notable exception of 
Burma.  He stressed the importance of ASEAN as a whole, as well as 
individual ASEAN countries, continuing to press the regime for 
progress. DG Djani emphasized Indonesia's commitment to democracy 
and admitted that ASEAN's constructive engagement with Burma's 
rulers has been difficult.  He expressed optimism, however, about 
ASEAN's continuing engagement with Burma on the issue of democratic 
reform, noting that sanctions cannot change the regime and that the 
recent agreement on a human rights mechanism for the Charter shows

how ASEAN can influence its constituent countries.  Both Djani and 
DSG Dammen noted that ASEAN would continue to be consensus-driven, 
but that this can also influence positive change. 
 
¶6. (U) DAS Marciel has cleared this telegram.
