Sheberghan Power Plant project back to original blueprint. 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has pulled out of 
a proposed project for the comprehensive development of northwest 
Afghanistan's most promising gas fields in the Amu Darya basin, near 
the site of the proposed Sheberghan power plant (reftel), despite an 
agreement to combine funds in a joint project.  In a letter to USAID 
dated July 31, ADB cited internal policies prohibiting cooperation 
with Louis Berger Group, half of the joint-venture contractor 
selected for the project.  The joint project would have saved close 
to USD 4 million for USAID and ADB in mobilization and supervision 
costs.  Despite the loss of these cost savings, the USAID project to 
rehabilitate three gas fields for the exclusive purpose of fueling 
the Sheberghan power plant is proceeding apace, with a contractor 
expected in the field by early December. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Joint project proposal runs into technical snag. 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The proposed joint USAID-ADB project (reftel) to develop 
the Amu Darya gas fields was born of Minister of Mines Ibrahim 
Adel's frustration with the lack of ADB progress on a USD 24 million 
loan, approved in 2003, for the rehabilitation of gas fields in the 
Amu Darya basin and the rehabilitation of the pipeline connecting 
Sheberghan and Mazar-i-Sharif.  USAID, already committed to 
rehabilitating three gas fields to identify gas reserves for the 
proposed Sheberghan 100 MW electric power plant, saw the possibility 
of reducing costs and spurring the ADB bureaucracy into speedier 
action.  The USG, encouraged by the Ministry of Mines, approached 
ADB's representatives with a proposal in May 2007, and struck a 
tentative agreement increasing the project's scope with ADB's 
funds. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a letter dated July 31, 2007, ADB informed USAID that 
following an internal review, ADB had determined it could not 
participate in a combined project.  The reason given was that Louis 
Berger Group Inc., one of the two joint venture partners set to 
implement the project, was "currently under sanction by ADB and, as 
such, we have now confirmed that they are ineligible to participate 
in ADB-financed activities."  Although various scenarios were 
examined to determine if this decision could be altered without 
further delaying the start of the project, it was decided that USAID 
would proceed with its Sheberghan project without ADB funds.  We 
understand that ADB plans to proceed with its USD 24 million project 
as originally envisioned.

Project proceeding apace.

¶4. (SBU) USAID's contractor announced the USD 12 million project 
tender on July 31, with a closing date of September 12.  Of the 30 
companies contacted by the contractor regarding the project, twelve 
have expressed interest and are expected to submit a bid. 
Additional funds may become available to increase the number of 
wells to be explored and rehabilitated from three to seven.  Barring 
any unforeseen difficulties, USAID expects a contractor in the field 
by early December.  A report on the status of the wells and the 
supply of natural gas available for the powering of the proposed 
Sheberghan power plant is expected in May/June of 2008.
