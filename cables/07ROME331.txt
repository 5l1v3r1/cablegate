Â¶1. Poloff spoke with Fabrizio Pignatelli of the Italian MFA 
Africa Office on February 15 to encourage support for the 
postponement of the IGAD summit. Pignatelli agreed that a 
February 20 conference would not provide sufficient time for 
preparation and adequate participation.  He also agreed that 
an IGAD summit would be more appropriate in March rather than 
in July.  Pignatelli stated that this would be communicated to 
the Government of Kenya through their mission in Nairobi.
