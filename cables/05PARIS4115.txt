B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
THIS WEEKEND'S LIBERATION OF FRENCH JOURNALIST FLORENCE 
AUBENAS WHO WAS HELD HOSTAGE IN IRAQ FOR OVER THREE MONTHS IS 
TODAY'S UNANIMOUS FRONT PAGE STORY, WITH A NUMBER OF 
EDITORIALS DEVOTED TO THE "NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
MOBILIZATION EFFORTS" WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THIS HAPPY END. IN 
CONNECTION WITH THIS STORY, FORMER FM BARNIER IS INTERVIEWED 
ON THE NEGOTIATIONS LEADING TO AUBENAS'S LIBERATION. IN 
POPULAR RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE PARISIEN HE IS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 
"FRANCE RECEIVED HELP FROM THE U.S." "IN THIS TYPE OF 
BUSINESS, WE MAKE ALL TYPES OF USEFUL CONTACTS. THROUGH OUR 
EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD WE HAVE NATURALLY ESTABLISHED CONTACTS WITH 
AMERICAN AND IRAQI OFFICIALS." HIS INTERVIEW IS TITLED: "NO 
RANSOM WAS PAID." 
 
ONE ARTICLE IN LE FIGARO COMMENTS: "WHAT IS SYRIA'S ROLE IN 
THE COMPLEX LIBERATION OF AUBENAS?. IN THE EIGHTIES, SYRIA WAS 
ALWAYS PRESENT IN EVERY HOSTAGE TAKING OF WESTERNERS. RUMORS 
INTIMATE THAT TWO WEEKS AGO HIGH RANKING MEMBERS OF SYRIA'S 
REGIME WERE IN PARIS, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF EL-ASSAD'S FAMILY." 
 
RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO CARRIES AN EXTENSIVE INTERVIEW OF 
THE NEW FM, PHILIPPE DOUSTE-BLAZY, ON EUROPEAN ISSUES AND 
RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.: "THERE IS A EUROPEAN MODEL., A MODEL 
THAT REGULATES THE MARKET ECONOMY AND WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM 
THE AMERICAN MODEL. ABOUT TURKEY, IT MUST BE MADE CLEAR THAT 
WE ARE EXTREMELY VIGILANT. NEGOTIATIONS WITH TURKEY CAN ONLY 
BEGIN IF TURKEY MEETS THE CONDITIONS SET BY THE EUROPEAN 
COUNCIL. NEITHER TURKEY NOR ANY OTHER COUNTRY WILL BE 
INTEGRATED INTO EUROPE WITHOUT A FRENCH REFERENDUM, AS PER 
CHIRAC'S CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM. WITH THE U.S. WE SHARE THE 
SAME VALUES OF PEACE AND DEMOCRACY. WHEN IT IS NECESSARY, WE 
KNOW HOW TO ESTABLISH CLOSE AND EFFECTIVE CONSULTATIONS, 
WHETHER IT IS ABOUT HAITI, LEBANON OR WEST AFRICA. BECAUSE WE 
SHARE THE SAME VALUES, WE CAN AFFORD TO HAVE A VISION OF THE 
WORLD THAT IS AT TIMES DIFFERENT. OUR RELATIONSHIP OF 
FRIENDSHIP WITH THE U.S. IS PROFOUND AND LONGSTANDING. BUT 
THIS FRIENDSHIP DOES NOT MEAN SUBORDINATION. WE CAN HAVE 
DIFFERENCES OVER CONTENT AND SAY IT. EVERYONE MUST BE FREE TO 
DEFEND HIS IDEA OF THE TRUTH. FRANCE IS OF COURSE FAVORABLE TO 
THE GOALS OF DEMOCRATIZATION. BUT WE HAVE A METHOD AND 
PRINCIPLES. IN OUR VIEW, DEMOCRATIZATION MUST RESPECT THE 
CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION OF OUR PARTNERS. THERE IS NO POINT IN 
IMPOSING READY-MADE SOLUTIONS, IMPORTED FROM THE OUTSIDE, 
WHICH CAN AWAKEN REJECTION AND INTOLERANCE. FRANCE IS NOT AN 
ADEPT OF THE STATUS QUO. IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE VIRTUES OF CHANGE 
AND PROGRESS, BUT THESE MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE PEOPLE IN 
ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED. THIS IS TRUE FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AS WELL 
AS FOR AFRICA. I AM PLANNING A TRIP TO THE U.S. . AS PART OF 
THE REGULAR DIALOGUE ESTABLISHED BY MY PREDECESSOR. BUT THIS 
DIALOGUE DOES NOT PRECLUDE OPENNESS. THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN 
CONFLICT IS ON TOP OF THE TRANSATLANTIC AGENDA; IT IS CLOSELY 
LINKED TO DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST." 
 
THE PARIS AIR SHOW AND THE BOEING - AIRBUS COMPETITION ARE A 
MAJOR ECONOMIC STORY. LE FIGARO ECONOMIE DEVOTES ITS FRONT- 
PAGE REPORT TO "THE RETURN OF THE AMERICANS TO LE BOURGET." 
(SEE PART C) 
 
RIGHT-OF-CENTER WEEKLY L'EXPRESS REPORTS ON ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY DANIEL FRIED'S "EUROPEAN TOUR AFTER THE FRENCH AND 
 
SIPDIS 
DUTCH `NO' TO THE EU REFERENDUM. HIS DELICATE MISSION IS TO 
CONVINCE HIS EUROPEAN INTERLOCUTORS THAT THE WORLD'S NUMBER 
ONE POWER DOES NOT REJOICE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S 
DIFFICULTIES. HE WILL REPEAT THE U.S. INVITATION TO THE EU TO 
PARTICIPATE IN A `PRAGMATIC' COOPERATION ON SHARED AGENDAS, 
WITH SECURITY AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE 
BALKANS AS THE MAIN THEMES." 
 
L'EXPRESS ALSO CARRIES A COMMENTARY BY BERNARD GUETTA ON 
RAFSANDJANI'S ELECTORAL DESIGNS, HIS INTENTION TO "RE- 
INTEGRATE IRAN IN THE WORLD ECONOMY AND FIND A MODUS OPERANDI 
WITH THE AMERICANS." (SEE PART C) 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
LIBERATION OF FRENCH HOSTAGE 
 
"A HAPPY END" 
PIERRE ROUSSELIN IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (06/13): "THE 
AMAZING SHOW OF SOLIDARITY . AND THE ROLE PLAYED BY FORMER FM 
BARNIER WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS HAPPY END. IN IRAQ, HOSTAGE 
TAKING IS UNFORTUNATELY AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE, WHICH DOES NOT 
AFFECT EXCLUSIVELY JOURNALISTS OR FOREIGNERS. MUCH TIME WILL 
PROBABLY STILL BE NEEDED TO REACH A SEMBLANCE OF SECURITY IN 
IRAQ." 
 
G8 - LIFTING OF DEBT FOR POOR COUNTRIES 
 
"A BURDEN IS LIFTED" 
JEAN-CHRISTOPHE PLOQUIN IN CATHOLIC LA CROIX (06/13): "THE G-8 
MINISTERS HAVE JUST ANNOUNCED AN IMMEDIATE LIFTING OF THE DEBT 
FOR 18 COUNTRIES. THE AGREEMENT WAS BASED ON A BRITISH- 
AMERICAN PROPOSAL NEGOTIATED IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK BETWEEN 
BLAIR AND BUSH. ONCE AGAIN PRESIDENT BUSH HAS SHOWN HIS 
ABILITY TO TAKE STRONG AND HIGHLY PUBLICIZED DECISIONS 
REGARDING DEVELOPMENT. TWO YEARS AGO HE HAD ANNOUNCED MASSIVE 
AID FOR AIDS RELIEF IN AFRICA. THIS NEW STRATEGY FOR 
DEVELOPMENT PLACES THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY, AND NOT 
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENTS, AT THE CENTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICIES, 
FORCING THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED TO BE COMMITTED TO GOOD 
GOVERNANCE." 
 
PARIS AIR SHOW: BOEING - AIRBUS 
 
"THE AMERICANS ARE BACK" 
DELPHINE DENUIT IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO ECONOMIE (06/13): 
"THIS YEAR'S BIG EVENT AT THE PARIS AIR SHOW IS THE RETURN OF 
THE AMERICANS EN FORCE. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AMERICANS 
TO ERASE PAST DISSENSION WITH FRANCE OVER THE WAR IN IRAQ. 
THIS PROBABLY EXPLAINS WHY THE PENTAGON HAS DECIDED TO LIFT 
THE BAN ON PARTICIPATION OF ITS HIGH OFFICIALS THIS YEAR, AS 
OPPOSED TO TWO YEARS AGO. UNDER SECRETARIES FOR INTERNATIONAL 
AFFAIRS AND OTHER AIR AND DEFENSE OFFICIALS WILL BE ABLE TO 
WALK THE TARMAC FREE OF COMPLEXES." 
 
"PLANES WITHOUT PILOTS" 
GILLES SENGES IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LES ECHOS (06/13): "IT IS 
INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT AS THE PARIS AIR SHOW GETS UNDER WAY, 
THE TWO MAJOR PLAYERS IN THIS SECTOR, AIRBUS AND BOEING HAVE 
NO LEADER AT THE HELM. BUT FOR BOEING, THIS VACUUM HAS NOT 
KEPT IN-HOUSE LOBBYISTS FROM SECURING THE U.S. POSITION, BOTH 
ON THE ISSUE OF SUBSIDIES AT THE WTO. AND IN CONGRESS, TO TRY 
TO KEEP THE EUROPEANS AWAY FROM THE JUICY MARKET OF MILITARY 
REFUELING AIRCRAFT. THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID OF AIRBUS, WHERE 
THE BATTLE FOR LEADERSHIP IS AFFECTING THE A350. AIRBUS'S 
DESTABILIZATION COMES AT THE WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT: WHEN 
BOEING IS PREPARING ITS SPECTACULAR RETURN." 
 
IRAN ELECTIONS 
 
"RAFSANDJANI'S `CHINESE' WAY" 
BERNARD GUETTA IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER WEEKLY L'EXPRESS (06/13): 
"NOW THAT TURKEY'S EU MEMBERSHIP IS COMPROMISED, THE TURKISH 
PRIME MINISTER HAS RESUMED TALKS WITH THE AMERICANS WHO ARE 
WELCOMING HIM WITH OPEN ARMS. AMERICA'S INFLUENCE IN TURKEY 
WILL REAFFIRM ITSELF, AND ALONG WITH THIS, AMERICA SHOULD SOON 
BE RE-ESTABLISHING ITS TIES WITH IRAN. THIS WOULD MAKE THE 
SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION IN IRAQ EASIER. THE ENTIRE REGIONAL 
STRATEGY COULD BE AFFECTED, BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD FIND 
ONCE AGAIN TWO MAJOR ALLIES OF IMPORT WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT. 
JUST AS EUROPE'S FEARS ARE BRINGING TURKEY BACK INTO AMERICA'S 
FOLD, THE INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS IN IRAN ARE BRINGING THIS 
COUNTRY BACK TOWARDS THE U.S. IN IRAN, THERE ARE TWO 
COUNTRIES: THE LEGAL ONE, A THEOCRACY BY THE MOLLAHS. AND THE 
REAL COUNTRY MADE UP OF A YOUNG POPULATION. THESE TWO 
COUNTRIES ARE VOTING ON JUNE 17. THE DIVINE SURPRISE FOR THE 
U.S. IS THAT IN THIS RACE, THE BEST-PLACED CANDIDATE IS 
RAFSANDJANI, WHO WANTS TO USE IRANIAN OIL TO ATTEMPT A 
HISTORIC COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE REGIME AND THE COUNTRY'S YOUNG 
POPULATION. WHAT RAFSANDJANI WANTS IS TO INTEGRATE IRAN IN THE 
WORLD ECONOMY AND TO FIND, TO THAT END, A MODUS OPERANDI WITH 
THE AMERICANS. IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS POSITION, RAFSANDJANI 
WANTS TO TRY THE `CHINESE' WAY: A POLITICAL DICTATORSHIP, 
ECONOMIC LIBERTIES, AND A COMPROMISE WITH AMERICA. WASHINGTON 
IS OBSERVING WITH INTEREST." WOLFF
