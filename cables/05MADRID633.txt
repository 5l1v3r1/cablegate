(SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel points February 9 to the 
Spanish MFA's deputy director for International Disarmament 
Affairs Marcos Rodriguez.  Rodriguez said the GOS supports 
the USG proposal to set up a Special Committee within the 
IAEA to help ensure that countries meet their safeguard 
obligations and comply with the IAEA Additional Protocols and 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  He noted that Spain now serves 
as an observer on the IAEA Board of Governors and is not in a 
position to vote on the USG proposal.  However, Spain would 
favor the implementation of the proposed draft terms of 
reference for the Special Committee.  It would also recommend 
that member states under investigation for non-compliance not 
be permitted to participate in decisions of the Board or the 
Special Committee.
