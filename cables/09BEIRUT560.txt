Despite the Lebanese media's preoccupation with the elections, the 
meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu was a 
front page story in all newspapers.  The media seemed sympathetic to 
the American President "who has a vision" and wants to reach a 
"two-state solution" as soon as possible.  Newspapers focused on the 
contradiction between the two leaders.  An editorialist expressed 
the belief that President Obama will do everything he can to "keep 
the Israeli beat under control."

"Obama and Netanyahu: Which Formula Will Win?" an editorial by Aouni 
Al-Ka'aki in pro-Hariri Ash-Sharq (5/19): 
 
"The meeting between...Obama and Netanyahu is very important because 
its...impact will determine the future, particularly the future of 
the peace process in the region.  ...Both leaders' statements showed 
contradictions in their visions: Obama believes in the two-state 
solution while Netanyahu seems to have an indecisive plan and 
obviously rejects Obama's vision.  ...During President Clinton's 
tenure, there were also contradictions between the United States and 
Israel.  At that point in time, Netanyahu was decisive about 
refusing the American plans and was able to obstruct them.  ...Now, 
the circumstances are different and Netanyahu might not be able to 
obstruct President Obama's vision and plans.  This was obvious 
because following his meeting with Obama, his statements seemed 
ambiguous and not clear.  He said that he has a plan but did not 
explain it.  In fact, the Israelis are in dire need of historic 
leadership.  Neither Netanyahu nor Olmert are historic leaders 
...Perhaps the American President will not be able to impose his 
vision on the Israelis, ...however, it is believed that the 
Americans will do everything they can to keep the Israeli beat under 
control.  ...This may take a long time, though, and time is not in 
any party's interests."
