SUBJECT: CANADA'S RESPONSE TO ZOELLICK'S NOMINATION 
 
REF: STATE 73691 
 
¶1. (U) EconMinCouns delivered points in reftel to officials 
in the Prime Minister's Office, Finance Canada, and the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT).  Because Secretary Paulson had already consulted 
with Canada's Minister of Finance Flaherty on Zoellick's 
nomination, all of the officials contacted by the Embassy 
were aware of the nomination.  Canada will not make a final 
decision on whether to support the President's nomination of 
Zoellick until the end of the nomination period, but all 
officials reacted positively to the information about 
Zoellick.  John Sloan, Director General, Economic Policy 
Bureau, DFAIT, called Zoellick a results-oriented leader with 
an impressive track record.  Sloan said Zoellick clearly has 
the background that people will be looking for in a candidate 
to lead the World Bank. 
 
¶2. (U) Sloan also said he hopes that the nomination of 
Zoellick is the first step towards a more open selection 
process for the leaders of the World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund.  He said Canada would like to see a process 
that selects the best candidate for the job regardless of 
nationality. 
 
¶3. (U) Reftel points were delivered to the following Canadian 
officials: 
 
Mark Cameron, Policy Advisor to the Prime Minister 
John Sloan, Director General, Economic Policy Bureau, DFAIT 
Laird Hindle, Economic Policy Officer, Economic Policy 
Bureau, DFAIT 
David Sevigny, Director, International Policy and 
Institutions Division, Finance Canada
