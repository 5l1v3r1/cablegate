SUBJECT: China/Forex Energy Fund: Still "Just an Idea" 
 
¶1. (SBU) Begin Summary.  Official Chinese media reported 
that China's National Energy Administration (NEA) had in 
early February submitted a proposal to use foreign 
exchange reserves to help Chinese companies acquire 
overseas resource assets.  NEA's Oil and Gas Division 
Director, however, said NEA had not yet proposed 
establishment of such a fund, and China's Director 
General for Reserve Management professed no knowledge of 
the plan.  End Summary. 
 
Media Reports Plans for Forex Resource-Buying Fund 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chinese official media reported last week that 
China's NEA had submitted a proposal to use foreign 
exchange reserves to establish a fund that would support 
Chinese oil and gas companies' acquisition of overseas 
assets.  The reports all cited a February 20 article in 
the industry journal "China Petroleum Daily" and stated 
that the plan was submitted during the NEA's National 
Work Conference in early February.  According to the 
articles, the fund would be used to offer low-interest 
loans and capital injections to state-owned oil and gas 
companies aiming to expand as the global recession lowers 
share prices of foreign firms. 
 
Official Claims Fund "Just an Idea" 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dr. Yang Lei, Director of the Oil and Gas 
Division at the NEA, told econoff on February 26 that he 
had read the same media reports and he quickly dismissed 
them as misrepresentative.  Yang acknowledged that the 
concept of a fund had come up in internal discussions 
during the NEA's National Work Conference, but the NEA 
had not formally proposed establishment.  "It is nothing 
more than an idea at this point," he explained. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Chinese State Administration for Foreign 
Exchange (SAFE) Director General for Reserve Management 
told FinAtt that although he had heard rumors of such 
proposals, he did not know any details.
