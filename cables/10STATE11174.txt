Michele, 
We want to thank you and your team at Embassy Beirut for the 
swift response to the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 409. 
 Thanks to your efforts, the U.S. Government quickly 
identified how to best support Lebanon's rescue and recovery 
efforts.  Embassy Beirut's around the clock assistance and 
close collaboration with Lebanese, Ethiopian and U.S. 
government counterparts stands as an important symbol of the 
partnerships we seek to build through diplomacy and outreach. 
 Moreover, our bilateral relations with Ethiopia and Lebanon, 
two key allies, are stronger today because of your efforts. 
We particularly would like to commend the entire Defense 
Attach Office, Office of Defense Cooperation, Assistant RSO 
Karen Brown and Consular officers Erica Hosking and Mollie 
Jackson for their tireless work to provide Washington with 
the latest information, to respond to Lebanon's request for 
assistance, and to coordinate our assistance efforts.  You 
and the Embassy Beirut team have done an outstanding job at a 
critical time. 
Thanks again to the entire mission for the high standard you 
set for the Department. 
Best, 
Jeff and Johnnie 
CLINTON
