SUBJECT: NO CHANGE IN ROK POSITION ON FULL ISRAELI 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE JUSCANZ GROUP 
 
REF: SECSTATE 16185 
 
The ROKG is still reluctant to advocate for full Israeli 
membership in the JUSCANZ group without a "genuine 
consensus."  On February 20, POLOFFS presented reftel points 
to Chang Jae-bok, Director of the Human Rights and Social 
Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFAT). 
Chang promised to pass the points to the ROK Mission in 
Geneva prior to the February 21 JUSCANZ meeting.  While Chang 
made it clear that Seoul's position was unlikely to change, 
he expressed willingness on the part of the ROK 
representative in Geneva to thoroughly discuss the matter 
with the U.S. delegation, the New Zealanders, and other 
JUSCANZ members.
