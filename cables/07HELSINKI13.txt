¶1. (U) In response to reftel action request, post contacted Sirpa 
Maenpaa, Director for the Unit for Eastern and Western Africa in the 
Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) urging Finland to attend 
the Liberia Partners Forum on February 13-14, 2007. Maenpaa said 
Finland would most likely not send a delegation from Helsinki; 
however, someone may attend from the Finnish Embassy in Washington. 
In addition, Finland has yet to decide on future bilateral aid to 
Liberia. She noted that Finland has decided to concentrate its 
development cooperation on fewer countries, and that Liberia is 
currently not one of Finland's long-term development assistance 
partners. Finland is involved in regional cooperation primarily 
through the EU. 
 
¶2. (U) In 2005, Finland granted 800,000 euros in humanitarian aid to 
Liberia through Finn Church Aid (300,000 euros) and Finnish Red 
Cross (500,000 euros) for refugee aid and internal refugee aid. In 
addition, 2.5 million euros was allocated to Western Africa, of 
which approximately 1 million to Liberia, according to Timo 
Karmakallio, Counselor, Unit for humanitarian assistance in the MFA. 
In 2006, 400,000 euros in humanitarian aid was allocated through the 
UN Children's Fund to Liberia, and 2.4 million euros to Western 
Africa, of which less than half to Liberia.
