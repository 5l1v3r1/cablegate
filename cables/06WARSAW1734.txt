GROUP (OEG) MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 132263 
 
Â¶1. Poloff delivered reftel points on the Singapore OEG to 
Lukasz Zielinski, PSI point of contact in the MFA Security 
Policy Department.  Zielinski responded that he had attended 
the OEG and the GOP had found it very fruitful.  He noted 
with some pride that many delegations had the success of the 
June 2006 HLPM in.  During the OEG, Poland had briefed OEG 
participants on the Baltic Sea PSI exercise scheduled for 
13-15 September in Gdansk, Poland.  Zielinski added that 
Poland planned at the next OEG in Montreal to engage in the 
discussion on ground interdictions, as Poland has developed 
significant experience in this area after having conducted 
two successful ground interdiction exercises.
