expressed that a solution would be found. %53.1 said that the

RADIKAL: As a result of the fight that broke out in the Solhan 
township of Bingol province, 4 persons were killed the previous 
night and 13 others, including the mayor from DYP, were wounded. 
The fight is attributed to the hostilities that arouse between 
the rival families during the March 2003 local elections. 
 
GUNDEM: The Van HRA (Human Rights Association), Mazlum-Der (The 
oppressed Peoples' Association), Bar Association and Goc-Der 
(Immigrants' Association) submitted reports concerning 
violations of rights in the region to the European Parliament's 
Sub-committee for Human Rights. The reports drew attention to 
ongoing clashes and operations in the region and said that 
villagers refused to return to the villages because they were 
exposed to pressure and forced to become village guards, 
underlining that the village guards were the main obstacle in 
village return. The HRA report focused on the police arrest of 
85 persons, including 20 children, protesting in Van the attacks 
during a September 5, 2005 march in Gemlik; home raids; and 
violations at the Van Centennial University.

militants in the Oymakli village of Eruh, Siirt province, two 
militants were killed. Separately, security forces seized three

one female, in connection with the bombs.

operation in Kilis arrested 5 persons, including one Syrian 
national, who were trying to smuggle 123,000 Captagon drug-pills 
to Syria. Police seized assorted weapons and ammunition for 
those weapons in the houses they searched. 
SABAH/EVRENSEL: The "Sweep Operation" launched by GOT forces 
against PKK militants who have been determined to be in rural 
Tunceli continue.Special teams are being deployed in the rural 
Cirali village, where five soldiers were killed and four others 
were wounded. 10,000 troops are participating in the operation 
and F-16 fighters occasionally are flying reconnaissance 
missions to determine PKK militants' hideouts. 
 
EVRENSEL: The Bingol Chapter of the Human Rights 
Association(HRA) was attacked on July 2, 2005. The President of 
HRA Chapter in Bingol, Ridvan Kizgin, filed a complaint with the 
public prosecutor. The Bingol Public Prosecutor rejected 
Kizgin's petition and decided that attacking the HRA was not a 
crime because the HRA is defending the separatist organization. 
Mr. Kizgin said that that decision justified any attacks to be 
launched against HRA administrators and members and extended an 
invitation for such attacks. 
 
EVRENSEL: The Sirnak Governor's office announced that it would 
impose some limitations on the number of trucks passing through 
the Habur Border Gate during the period of October 13-16, 2005 
because of Iraq's October 15 referendum on its constitution. No 
limitations will be imposed on the tankers and trucks carrying 
goods for the Coalition Forces.
