SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR FY09 TV COOP ON AVIAN INFLUENZA 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Post would like to propose a TV COOP to produce a 
documentary about Avian Influenza (AI) for the Cambodian public. 
The proposed piece would have guaranteed primetime placement on 
Cambodia's national television station TVK, one of the top two 
networks in the country.  The documentary would focus detection, 
treatment and emergency response to AI outbreaks.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. PROPOSAL: PAS Phnom Penh, in partnership with Cambodian state run 
television station TVK, proposes to film a documentary on Avian 
Influenza (AI) in the United States over a two week period focusing 
on the U.S. preparedness plan for AI outbreaks in the hope that some 
of the methods and strategies could be adopted in Cambodia. 
 
Suggested Shooting Plan: 
 
Post envisions a shooting plan comprised of at least two locations 
and possibly three depending on advice from PA and OBS.  We would 
like to propose that the first stop be in Washington for interviews 
with policy makers about the threat of AI, our response plan and 
U.S. efforts to combat any potential pandemic through direct 
assistance in other countries.  Interviews with USG, UN and private 
sector officials who are directly involved with AI would help round 
out the documentary. 
 
The second stop would logically be to CDC headquarters in Atlanta 
for background discussions and on-camera interviews with officials 
involved with the Influenza Pandemic Operations Plan.  The focus of 
this segment would be the science involved and the containment and 
treatment strategies designed by CDC that may be viable for 
Cambodia. 
 
After the team's return, PA Phnom Penh would work with TVK to add 
the Cambodian perspective to the documentary by facilitating 
interviews with officials from the Royal Government, the donor 
community and NGO sector.  These discussions would serve to provide 
the public with more information about their own government's 
preparedness and highlight the in-country mechanisms for combating 
outbreaks of AI in the future. 
 
¶3. JUSTIFICATION:  This COOP directly supports post's MSP goal of 
"Investing in People/Addressing Health Threats, Building Systems to 
Improve Standards".  Over 50% of our $61.5 million of direct 
assistance to Cambodia is focused on addressing health care issues. 
A portion of these funds also supports public information campaigns 
that help to raise the population's awareness of the dangers of AI, 
but the reach of these programs is limited to major urban centers. 
A documentary focused on AI issues would reach Cambodians in some of 
the most isolated areas of the country as a vast majority of the 
public receives the majority of their information from television. 
 
¶4. PLACEMENT: The FY09 TV COOP documentary on AI prevention and 
response will air during primetime directly after the 1900 news 
program which is the highest rated news program in the nation. 
 
¶5. BACKGROUND ON THE STATION: National TV of Cambodia or TVK is the 
only state-owned station in the Kingdom Cambodia.  With financial 
assistance from Japanese government, TVK has installed a new high 
powered transmitter and increased its programming to between 10 and 
15 hours per day.  It is the only national broadcasting center in 
the country and has the potential to reach about 80% of the total 
population, or an estimated 2,500,000 people. 
 
¶6. NOMINEES: The three TVK crew members proposed for this project 
are: 
 
Mr. Khvay Atitya, Producer 
Mr. Chin Lyhorn, Cameraman 
Mr. Pang Nath, Program Director/Editor 
 
Mr. Atitya and Mr. Lyhorn speak enough English to operate 
effectively in a reporting environment. 
 
¶7. PAST TV COOP PARTICIPATION: National TV of Cambodia (TVK) has not 
previously participated in a TV COOP.
