Austria Favors Broad Definition of UNSCR 1747 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On May 22, EconPolOff discussed reftel demarche 
with Margit Bruck-Friedrich, Director of the Austrian Foreign 
Ministry's Office of Conventional Arms Export Control, 
Military Transit, and Overflight Control.  Bruck-Friedrich 
confirmed with the MFA's Legal Department that the GoA had 
already submitted its report to the UN on implementation of 
UNSCR 1747.  Regarding UNSCR 1747's operative paragraphs 5 
and 6, Bruck-Friedrich opined that the GoA would use a broad 
definition of "any arms or related material."  The EU's Code 
of Conduct for Arms, she explained, includes the list of 
Wassenaar controlled items, and was incorporated into 
Austria's 2005 Foreign Trade Act.  The Austrian export 
control law, she emphasized, includes technology and other 
defense-related items, such as maintenance.  Bruck-Friedrich 
added that the GoA, following a previous U.S. demarche, had 
"singled out" companies in Austria that were interested in 
doing business with Iran to warn them to refrain from 
exporting defense or dual-use items to Iran. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On May 25, EconUnit Chief followed up with Helmut 
Krehlik, Head of the Ministry of Economy's Export and Import 
Control Division.  Krehlik stated that Austrian and EU laws 
clearly allow for a broad definition of paragraphs 5 and 6 of 
UNSCR 1747.  The "catch-all provision" contained in paragraph 
4.2 of EU Regulation 1330 (2000) requires licensing approval 
for all military items (listed and non-listed) destined for a 
state under an EU, OSCE, or UN embargo.  Furthermore, 
Austria's Foreign Trade Act covers technical assistance 
(training, servicing, provision of spare parts). 
 
 
Austria Processing Large Number of Export Licenses 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Bruck-Friedrich also pointed out that Austria 
processes the fourth largest number of licenses for military 
and dual-use goods within the EU.  During a separate meeting 
on May 23 with EconPolOff, Alexander Marschik, the Acting 
Director of the MFA's Department of Arms Control, 
Disarmament, and Non-Proliferation, added that the GoA has 
instituted a more stringent process for vetting licenses for 
sales of defense and dual-use goods and services.
