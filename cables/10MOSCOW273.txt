SUBJECT: RUSSIAN SHERPA SEEKS SMOOTH NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMIT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 7493 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY-QIvQQG:kov lamented that involving 
non-NPT signatories India and Pakistan in the Summit will 
lead to an agreed text which is "devoid of important things." 
 Stressing the importance of a smooth summit, he said that 
resulting documents based on the lowest common denominator 
will still be better than nothing.  End Summary. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 28, ESTH Counselor and Dutch DCM, joined 
by nuclear affairs officers from both embassies, delivered 
jointly reftel invite to the third Sherpa meeting in The 
Hague on February 9-11 to Ambassador Grigoriy Berdennikov, 
Russian Sherpa for the Nuclear Security Summit.  Berdennikov 
confirmed that his team had already registered, including 
Mikhail Lysenko, Director of International Cooperation of 
Rosatom, and Aleksandr Boluchev from the MFA's Department of 
Security and Disarmament.  A fourth person from the Russian 
Embassy at The Hague may also take part.  Berdennikov 
confirmed he was aware of the three person delegation limit, 
adding that the Russian delegation would not make itself 
burdensome. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Berdennikov described the Summit communique as 
"more or less there," while the work plan is "more 
problematic."  He noted there was little enthusiasm at the 
December Sherpa meeting in Tokyo for a follow-on meeting 
after the Summit, adding that some do not clearly understand 
the purpose of the Summit.  He said the GOR was fine with no 
further meetings, instead stressing the importance of a 
"smooth" Summit in April. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Noting that the GOR was not consulted on the list 
of participants, he said the  composition of the summit would 
make it difficult to accomplish much. Illustrating his point, 
Berdennikov said the GOR welcomed language in previous work 
plan drafts in favor of increasing the membership of the 
Nuclear Terrorism Convention.  However, because some of the 
invited participants are not members of the Convention and 
opposed such language, the language is no longer in the 
draft, which Russia regrets.  Berdennikov further lamented 
the lack of a quid pro quo, as the draft work plan does ask 
the G-8 for something, but does not ask the other states to 
reciprocate with action.  He recalled that the G-8 text was 
able to be much more ambitious because it was crafted by 
likeminded nations.  Berdennikov stressed that it is 
difficult involve non-NPT signatories India and Pakistan in a 
non-proliferation forum based on the Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT).  He clarified that although the Summit is not billed 
as being NPT-based, for all intents and purposes it is.  He 
added,  that it's important for non-NPT signatories' voices 
to be heard.  But including them in this Summit leads to very 
bland text, "devoid of important things." 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Given that India and Pakistan will want to "bargain 
until the end," Berdennikov emphasized that the GOR's primary 
goal is for the Nuclear Security Summit to be "as ruly as 
possible."  He said that the resulting documents may be based 
on a lowest common denominator which is very low indeed, but 
the LCD is still desirable as it is better than nothing, and 
far better than a fight.  Briefly animated, he stated that a 
fight in Washington should be avoided at all costs as that 
would be a "major blow" to the non-proliferation cause. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Finally, Berdennikov noted that the GOR had wanted 
Armenia and Belarus to be invited to the Summit.  Armenia, he 
explained, is the only country in its region with an ongoing 
nuclear program and a good record on fighting nuclear 
terrorism.  Armenia feels left out as Georgia is in "and it 
has nothing."  Belarus, he continued, has nuclear research 
reactors, has just signed an agreement with DOE for HEU 
removal, and has a good record on anti-terrorism.  Belarus is 
"offended" that Ukraine is in and it is not. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Comment:  Despite Berdennikov's complaints, the 
meeting was very cordial in tone.  He appeared personally 
committed to a smooth summit, even if the final results must 
be watered down in order to reach consensus.  End 
Comment.
