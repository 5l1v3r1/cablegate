SUBJECT:  DynCorp Article Resonates, Perhaps Badly 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request - see para 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 12, the online news service Sudan Tribune carried 
an article titled, "US Firm to Turn South Sudan Rebels into 
Soldiers."  The article states that Reuters interviewed DynCorp Vice 
President for International Business Development Al Rigney in Juba 
on August 12 on the margins of a trade fair in which DynCorp was an 
event sponsor.  The article stated DynCorp would begin next year to 
reshape thousands of former southern Sudanese guerilla fighters into 
a professional army; the training would be ongoing for the next 
several years and put to work a rebel militia force with too much 
idle time. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On August 13, the Sudan Tribune carried a follow-on piece, 
"Sudan SPLM Denies Contract with US Firm to Reshape SPLA."  The 
article states that the SPLM has denied these assertions, and 
instead quotes SPLA Major General Bior Ajang as stating the SPLA is 
reshaping its structures into a modern force under the control of 
the Government of Southern Sudan, but without any foreign 
assistance.  He instead referred to UN proposals to modernize the 
joint forces, which would constitute the core of the national army 
if the South opts for unity with the North. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The content of the article, however, does not correspond 
with either the account of DynCorp activities provided to First Vice 
President Salva Kiir during his recent visit to Washington or to 
post's understanding of the DynCorp contract.  The article's 
misleading coverage of the apparent DynCorp statement begs 
clarification; its timing and necessity are puzzling at a time when 
the USG is working urgently to gain Sudanese acceptance of a UN 
peacekeeping operation in Darfur. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action requested:  AF/SPG is requested to ensure that 
DynCorp make no further public statements on its work in Sudan.
