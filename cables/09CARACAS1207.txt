¶1. (SBU)  Speaking in Madrid on September 11, Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez repeated the suggestion, first raised 
by Brazilian President Da Silva at the August 28 UNASUR 
summit in Argentina, that President Obama publicly explain 
the purpose of the Defense Cooperation Agreement with 
Colombia.  Chavez asked that Obama attend the upcoming UNASUR 
Summit in Quito and, "explain the idea behind the bases." 
Note: The GBRV has not given the Embassy either a verbal or 
written invitation for the President to attend.  End Note. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Over the weekend, five of Venezuela's leading 
dailies, including papers of record El Nacional and El 
Universal, carried Chavez's comments as well as those of 
Brazilian diplomat Celso Amorim, who claimed Obama had told 
him "he would discuss UNASUR with his team."
