¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Presidency may name an interim administration 
for Abyei soon despite the fact that borders have yet to be defined, 
according to NCP negotiator Dirdeiry Mohamed Ahmed.  Dirdeiry 
boasted that the SPLM-NCP relationship has "never been better" 
following the SPLM's rejoining of the GNU, but expressed concerns 
about elections in Sudan given current events in Kenya. End summary. 
 
 
------------------------ 
BRINGING ORDER TO ABYEI 
------------------------ 
¶2. (SBU) Parliamentarian and influential NCP member Dirdeiry Mohamed 
Ahmed informed poloffs on 15 January that the Presidency would soon 
name a chief and deputy administrator to lead Abyei's "interim 
administration." Although in the past the SPLM demanded that the NCP 
accept the results of the Abyei Boundary Commission (ABC) report 
before an administration was named, Dirdeiry said that the SPLM 
seems to have withdrawn this demand and now accepts the creation of 
an interim administration without resolution of the border dispute. 
In regard to the SPLM's 31 December appointment of Edward Lino as 
the "SPLM Chairman in Abyei area" (Ref A), Dirdeiry said that Lino 
will first serve as merely the SPLM party representative, but later 
will serve as chief of the interim administration that is called for 
in the CPA, once authorized by the Presidency.  Press reports 
indicate that the Umma Party has also named a representative to 
Abyei - Mohamed El Dorick Bakht. Dirdeiry, unaware of this 
appointment, surmised this was because Umma party leader, Sadiq 
al-Mahdi, has taken a keen personal interest in being involved in 
resolving the Abyei dispute. [Note: As part of the overall NCP/SPLM 
deal that ended the SPLM's walkout from participation in the GNU, 
the partners agreed that an SPLM member would serve as chief 
administrator and an NCP member as deputy.) 
 
----------------------------------- 
ELECTIONS - AVOIDING ANOTHER KENYA 
----------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Dirdeiry, who served as DCM in Sudan's Embassy in Nairobi, 
expressed hope that the Sudanese electoral process would be fair and 
transparent so that Sudan can avoid a crisis similar to Kenya's.  He 
observed that Sudan had the potential to split violently along 
ethnic lines, as is currently happening in Kenya.  He lamented that 
the National Constitutional Review Commission (NCRC) (of which he is 
a member) has not been fully transparent in drafting the electoral 
law, and hoped that the Council of Ministers and the National 
Assembly would be more transparent in their handling of the law. If 
the NCRC cannot manage to produce a draft law to the Council of 
Ministers within the next few days, Dirdeiry said that the law would 
likely not be ratified until April 2008 when the National Assembly 
is back in session.  That said, he suggested that it is not out of 
the question for the Presidency to ask the National Assembly to hold 
a special session in order to review and ratify the electoral law. 
Once the draft law reaches the Council of Ministers and the 
Parliament, Dirdeiry stated that it should only take 2 to 3 weeks 
for the bill to be approved. (Note: NCRC Co-Chair Abdulla Idris told 
poloff January 14 that Parliament will likely call a special session 
to pass the bill. End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Dirdeiry described the current elections timeline as 
putting Sudan "between a rock and a hard place."  If the elections 
law is not passed until April 2008 and the electoral commission not 
named until May 2008, the commission will only have 9 or 10 months 
to prepare and execute elections ahead of the 2009 rainy season and 
the CPA-mandated elections date (Ref B). Dirdeiry said that donor 
assistance (especially technical) would definitely be welcomed for 
electoral preparation, but did not know how open the GNU would be to 
international election observers.  He warned that the elections 
could prove to be a problem if they are not taken seriously by the 
Sudanese. If not handled carefully, elections could create ethnic 
tension and polarization and lead to violence, said Dirdeiry. 
Dirdeiry believes that the elections will be hotly contested at the 
presidential and gubernatorial levels and said that Umma party 
leader Sadiq al-Mahdi will likely run for President. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE - A PROMISING WAY FORWARD 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶5. (SBU) Dirdeiry, who is among the NCP members named to the joint 
NCP/SPLM Executive Committee (EC) that emerged from the recent 
political crisis, confirmed that the group will have its first 
meeting January 24.  Asked if the EC would meet regularly, he 
replied that, as a permanent body, it will have to draft rules of 
procedure, which will specify how often the EC will meet.  Dirdeiry 
predicted the EC would focus principally on elections, borders, and 
 
KHARTOUM 00000063  002 OF 002 
 
 
programs to foster unity and reconciliation.  (Note: Press reports 
January 16 indicated that the Executive Committee will be expanded 
to become a "Political and Executive Committee" (PEC) with 18 
members, nine from each side.  Taha and Machar remain co-chairmen 
and we expect the other members to remain as well, with several 
additions. End note.) 
 
------------------------------------ 
SPLM-NCP RELATIONSHIP "NEVER BETTER" 
------------------------------------ 
¶6. (SBU) Dirdeiry described the SPLM-NCP relationship as having 
"never been better" following the SPLM's December 2007 decision to 
rejoin the GNU.  Dirdeiry explained that Pagan Amum, Secretary 
General of the SPLM and recently-appointed GNU Minister for Cabinet 
Affairs, was in the past "demonized" by the NCP, but has now been 
tapped by the NCP to resolve critical disputes such as the 
SPLA-Misseryia clashes in South Kordofan.  Dirdeiry claimed that a 
visit by Amum and GNU Minister of Defense Hussein to Aweil had 
helped calm the situation there.  Dirdeiry reported that the 
three-year CPA anniversary celebrations in Wau on January 14, 
attended by First Vice President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Vice 
President Ali Osman Taha, went extremely well.  Dirdeiry noted that 
national flags were prominently displayed at the event, which was 
held in Southern Sudan. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: The SPLM-NCP relationship appears to be on the 
mend for now (at least in public) and the formation of the Executive 
Committee and the attendance of the vice presidents at CPA 
celebrations in Wau are both positive signs. Although the Presidency 
has not yet tackled the thorny Abyei issue, the appointment of a 
joint interim administration is an important step in fulfilling CPA 
requirements - though to name an administration before accepting the 
ABC report is a deviation from the CPA text.  The Executive 
Committee will have its work cut out for it, as border demarcation 
and election issues will likely require intensive negotiations.
