Former Brazilian President Jose Sarney wrote in liberal, largest 
national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (7/14): "South America 
is the most peaceful continent. We have not had a war for over one 
hundred years.  Democracy is consolidated throughout the region. We 
have never permitted an arms race.... [But] now [Venezuelan 
President Hugo] Chavez's plan to spend USD 60 billion in arms, 
thereby transforming Venezuela into a military power is a threat 
against the continent. He has said he will remain in power until 
2031 and that he is an 'integrationist.'  But who knows whether the 
president of Venezuela thinks that he should occupy the Amazon to 
avoid its internationalization?  With the new military equipment - 
14 SU-25 fighters, 600,000 GPS-guided bombs, China-made JYL highly 
sophisticated 3-D radar stations, 10 to 15 submarines, 138 warships 
and 150 supersonic jets - our sovereignty can turn to dust. No one 
ever imagined that such a situation could occur in the South 
American continent. What's the reason for all this?  To face the 
United States?  This does not mean anything for the superpower, but 
for us it is a frightening force. Either Brazil enters the arms race 
to ensure its defense, by removing resources from social programs, 
or it will have to look for protection under the NATO's umbrella."
