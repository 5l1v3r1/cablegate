THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. 
 
¶1.  (U)  Acting EconMinCouns and Econoff met with Federica Ferrari 
Bravo, Office Director for the Middle East and Balkans in the MFA's 
Bureau of Cooperation and Development (BCD) August 30 to deliver 
reftel points. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Ferrari Bravo stated that the GOI will pledge 30 million 
euro at the August 31 Stockholm conference, which she would attend 
along with Deputy Foreign Minister Patrizia Sentinelli (Note: 
Sentinelli's portfolio includes Development Assistance and 
Sub-Saharan Africa.  End note).  Ferrari Bravo noted that the 30 
million euro, which the Council of Ministers announced in its August 
28 decree law authorizing Italy's military mission in Lebanon, had 
not yet arrived in MFA coffers. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Ferrari Bravo said that the MFA had not yet decided how 
to allocate the 30 million and was still discussing plans.  Ferrari 
Bravo speculated that the money would be used for school 
rehabilitation, ongoing agricultural development projects, and 
humanitarian assistance.  She added that the MFA would prefer to 
continue previously initiated development projects in Lebanon that 
are in line with BCD's humanitarian assistance goals. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Regarding future assistance pledges, Ferrari Bravo stated 
that, given Italy's tight foreign assistance budget, it would be 
difficult for the GOI to pledge more funding to Lebanon in 2006 
beyond the 30 million euro.
