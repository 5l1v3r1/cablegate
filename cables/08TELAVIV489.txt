Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
This morning the electronic media reported that the IDF's "Operation 
Hot Winter" in Gaza has come to an end.  The pull out of Infantry 
and armored forces was completed in the early hours Monday morning, 
however, IAF strikes continue.  Ha'aretz reported that the IDF 
senior command recommended keeping up the intensive pressure on 
Hamas, while The Jerusalem Post quoted senior GOI officials as 
saying that the government will wait to see if Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice's visit this week brings calm before deciding on a 
wider offensive in Gaza.  The officials were quoted as saying that 
the longer-term goals for an IDF operation that has not yet been 
approved by the government include "weakening and even bringing down 
the [Hamas] government."  IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi was 
quoted as saying that contrary to media reports, 90 of the 100 
Palestinians killed so far were gunmen.  The electronic media 
reported that Ashkelon was again hit by two rockets this morning 
following the IDF withdrawal; no injuries were reported. 
 
Ha'aretz and other media reported that PM Ehud Olmert is expected to 
stress to Secretary Rice at their scheduled meeting in Jerusalem 
Tuesday evening that Israel reserves the right to act freely in the 
Gaza Strip against Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups. 
According to Ha'aretz, Olmert will also tell Rice that Israel is 
interested in continuing negotiations with moderate elements in the 
PA. In Olmert's view, Israeli military activity in Gaza has sent a 
message to Hamas that the group needs to rethink its strategy. 
"Israel will not consent to the equation that Hamas wants to dictate 
in the Gaza Strip by firing on Ashkelon.  We will be the ones to 
create the equation, not Hamas," he was quoted as saying at Sunday's 
weekly cabinet meeting. 
 
Ha'aretz and other media reported that Defense Minister Ehud Barak 
is considering the use of artillery against populated areas of Gaza 
from which Qassam and Katyusha rockets are being fired.  Barak will 
meet with other officials today to examine the legal aspects of such 
 
TEL AVIV 00000489  002 OF 007 
 
 
strikes.  Various media quoted Vice PM Haim Ramon as saying at 
Sunday morning's government session: "Why don't we shoot at the 
sources of the fire?  According to international law, we are allowed 
to do it.  The issue was legally examined during the Second Lebanon 
War and the conclusion was that if they fire from a village, we are 
allowed to fire back even if this is a populated area."  Ha'aretz 
reported that cabinet minister Ami Ayalon (Labor) is planning to 
propose that Israel begin indirect negotiations with Hamas, with 
Egyptian mediation, to bring about a cease-fire in Gaza. 
 
On Sunday Maariv reported that FM Tzipi Livni told the Palestinians 
on Saturday that their decision to suspend negotiations over the 
violence in Gaza was in breach of the understandings agreed upon at 
Annapolis.  Furthermore, the FM was quoted as saying that the 
Palestinians' decision to suspend the talks would have no impact on 
the IDF activity in the Gaza Strip. 
 
The media reported that a 14-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by 
IDF troops in Hebron as violence spilled over into the West Bank. 
This morning, IDF Radio reported that an armed Israeli settler 
opened fire and killed a 17-year-old Palestinian hurling rocks at a 
public bus traveling near Ramallah.  There were also protests 
against the army's operations in Gaza by Israeli Arabs in Wadi Ara 
and elsewhere. 
 
On Sunday The Jerusalem Post reported that on Friday the Bush 
administration declined to interfere in the case of American terror 
victims who are suing the PLO. 
 
Ha'aretz wrote that local defense officials reported on Sunday that 
Israel has recently purchased a new supply of Logol pills against 
nuclear radiation. 
 
Maariv reported that Salah Abassi, an Israeli-Arab publisher from 
Haifa, has started to translate Israeli best-sellers and distribute 
them in Arab countries.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Veteran journalist Hemmi Shalev wrote in the independent Israel 
Hayom: "The complicated situation we are now in -- between a rock 
 
TEL AVIV 00000489  003 OF 007 
 
 
and a hard place, as the Americans say -- is a direct result, to a 
large degree, of the failed policy of the Bush administration in the 
Middle East." 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one of the 
popular, pluralist Maariv: "Condoleezza Rice, accompanied by an 
armada of American generals that have been roaming around here for 
many months taking notes, will come to Jerusalem tomorrow.  Let's 
see [Olmert] extricate himself from that." 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: "The choice between 
[controlling the Gaza Strip and negotiating a long-term cease-fire 
with Hamas] is a choice between the plague and cholera. 
Nevertheless, it appears to be unavoidable." 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: "When senior 
Israeli military and political leaders speak about obliterating 
neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip or shrug their shoulders at the 
killing of Palestinian civilians, they must understand the cost of 
these kinds of retaliatory operations on the peace process." 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: "Instead 
of looking for ways to 'pay' Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to 
return to talks with Israel, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 
must impose concrete costs on Hamas's aggression.... The alternative 
... is ... even more surely burying the process that the U.S. is 
trying to revive." 
 
Senior columnist Haggai Huberman wrote on page one of the 
nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe: "Israel must not be 
tempted again to ... a cease-fire proposal, which will serve only 
Hamas."

¶I.  "Like a Bird on a Trip Wire" 
 
Veteran journalist Hemmi Shalev wrote in the independent Israel 
Hayom (3/3): "Tomorrow, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 
will arrive in the region.  According to knowledgeable sources, Rice 
is said to be angry at everyone, including Israel, even though the 
complicated situation we are now in -- between a rock and a hard 
place, as the Americans say -- is a direct result, to a large 
degree, of the failed policy of the Bush administration in the 
 
TEL AVIV 00000489  004 OF 007 
 
 
Middle East, a policy that is now returning, perhaps as a last 
resort, to the gunboat diplomacy of the 19th century." 
 
II.  "Waiting for Condoleezza" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one of the 
popular, pluralist Maariv (3/3): "[Cabinet minister Ami Ayalon 
says]: 'We have to achieve a cease-fire from a position of strength, 
which will be binding on all the organizations.  We have to reach an 
agreement on the crossing points with the cooperation of the 
international community, and we need a courageous and genuine 
political process in Judea and Samaria [i.e. the West Bank].  There 
are 600 roadblocks there and not one of them is being removed, and 
in such a way there will never be a better economic situation there. 
 About all these things we have to think, to talk, to hold a 
discussion.'  Ah, there lies the problem.   'I don't identify 
willingness for such a discussion on the part of the Defense 
Minister,Q says Ayalon.  What he does not say, at least publicly, is 
that Olmert is a hostage of the Defense Minister and cannot force 
such a discussion on him.... The Prime Minister tries to maneuver 
between Barak and Ayalon, the general and the admiral, without 
getting entangled.  He is, after all, just a corporal.  For his 
part, it is better for Ayalon to blow up at Barak than at him.  But 
Ayalon knows that in the end, the responsibility lies on the 
shoulders of one Ehud only -- Olmert.  One of his aides called him a 
'prime minister without portfolio.'  At this rate, it appears that 
Olmert does not lack portfolios.  Ayalon is not necessarily the 
weightiest of these.  Condoleezza Rice, accompanied by an armada of 
American generals that have been roaming around here for many months 
taking notes, will come to Jerusalem tomorrow.  Let's see him 
extricate himself from that." 
 
III.  "Between the Plague and Cholera" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (3/2): "Conquering the 
Gaza Strip is likely to cost a large number of casualties on both 
sides.  More difficult than that, from Israel's perspective, is the 
problem of controlling the Gaza Strip after the conquest.  The 
feeble coexistence between Israel and the PA that exists in the West 
Bank cannot be applied, as is, to the Gaza Strip.  The other option, 
for Israel to resign itself to the existence of the Hamas regime in 
Gaza and to negotiate with it over a long-term cease-fire, comes 
with equally high costs.  Among other things, it is a death sentence 
to Abu Mazen's regime, with which Israel hoped to reach an 
agreement; it will end the international boycott on Hamas; and it 
 
TEL AVIV 00000489  005.6 OF 007 
 
 
marks IsraelQs resigning itself to the existence of an Iranian base 
near the Israeli hinterland.   The choice between those two options 
is a choice between the plague and cholera. Nevertheless, it appears 
to be unavoidable." 
 
IV.  "Bank of Political Objectives" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (3/3): "The 
usual 'criterion' for success -- the body count -- is on Israel's 
side, but it cannot be a goal in and of itself if it does not stop 
the Palestinian rocket fire.  At the same time, the fighting in Gaza 
could damage the desire to reach a peace agreement with the 
Palestinians over the long term.... The Palestinian Authority, which 
considers itself committed to the Arab League initiative and the 
understandings reached at the Annapolis summit -- the same PA that 
was forcibly robbed of its authority in the Gaza Strip by Hamas -- 
cannot escape its commitment to the peace process at precisely this 
trying time.  But it would be delusional on Israel's part to think 
the PA can ignore the fighting in the Gaza Strip and calmly sit down 
at the negotiating table when not only gunmen but also innocent 
civilians, including newborns, are being killed in Gaza.  And so, 
when senior Israeli military and political leaders speak about 
obliterating neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip or shrug their 
shoulders at the killing of Palestinian civilians, they must 
understand the cost of these kinds of retaliatory operations on the 
peace process." 
 
 
¶V.  "Defeating Hamas" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (3/3): 
"Hamas has calculated that, since it does not care about and indeed 
cynically exploits the suffering of its own people, it has nothing 
to lose.  The more it escalates, the more likely it will compel 
Israel to respond with greater force, the more Israel will be blamed 
for the inevitable collateral damage from its operations, and the 
more pressure there will be to negotiate with Hamas and reduce its 
isolation.  In other words, the more Hamas attacks Israel, the 
better its chances for international acceptance.  Accordingly, if 
the international community, particularly the U.S., truly wants to 
prevent further escalation, it must break this cycle. Instead of 
looking for ways to 'pay' Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to return 
to talks with Israel, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice must 
impose concrete costs on Hamas's aggression.  This means greatly 
increasing the pressure on Egypt to stop the weapons flow into Gaza, 
and supporting Israel's right to respond with the necessary means, 
 
TEL AVIV 00000489  006.4 OF 007 
 
 
as any other state would, in order to defeat those responsible for 
the unprovoked terrorist attacks against her cities.  To the U.S., 
such a course of action may seem unwarranted in that it risks 
censure by Europe and trouble in the UN. The alternative, however, 
is encouraging a deepening war that will cost many lives, handing 
victories to militant Islamists, and even more surely burying the 
process that the U.S. is trying to revive." 
 
VI.  "Anything But a Cease-Fire" 
 
Senior columnist Haggai Huberman wrote on page one of the 
nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe (3/2): "A cease-fire is 
in the interests of Hamas.  Under its cover, it will be able to grow 
as strong as Hizbullah.  This contradicts the Israeli goal of 
preventing Hamas from growing stronger, which will lead to long-term 
calm.  Security-establishment officials know that a cease-fire can 
be accepted only if there is full supervision of the 
Israeli-Egyptian border.  Since such supervision does not look 
realistic right now, a cease-fire is not in IsraelQs interest. 
Throughout its history, Israel has known cease-fires many times that 
only gave enemies the time they needed to resume fighting under 
conditions that were more comfortable for them and more difficult 
for us.  Israel must not be tempted again to such a cease-fire 
proposal, which will serve only Hamas."

¶2.  Ahmadinejad in Baghdad: 
--------------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: "Ahmadinejad's arrival [in 
Baghdad] raises questions about Washington's ability to set up 
permanent military bases in Iraq in the future.

"Baghdad's New Strategic Partner" 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz (3/3): "The historic visit to 
 
TEL AVIV 00000489  007 OF 007 
 
 
Iraq by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which began on 
Sunday, suggests that Tehran is finding ways to bypass efforts to 
pressure it.... And while the United States is holding talks with 
Iraq on the details of a bilateral cooperation agreement that will 
define America's status in Iraq following a U.S. withdrawal, 
Ahmadinejad's arrival raises questions about Washington's ability to 
set up permanent military bases in Iraq in the future.  The official 
visit by Iran's president also holds out a promise of cooperation 
and economic ties with the Kurdish autonomous region.  If Turkey 
continues to pressure the PKK guerrillas and imposes sanctions on 
Kurdistan, Iran will become the Kurds' main economic outlet.  With 
its links to the Kurds, its economic contribution to Iraq and its 
close political ties with the main Shi'ite parties, Iran is 
increasingly becoming a strategic partner of Iraq.  Hence 
Washington's recognition of the need for political dialogue with 
Tehran about Iraq's future. But this development worries the Arab 
League, and especially Saudi Arabia, which is being faced with 
another large Shi'ite state on its borders."
