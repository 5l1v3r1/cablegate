REF: ANKARA 1791 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on 
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) violence in Turkey.  Our primary 
sources for these reports are mainstream Turkish press services, 
such as the Anatolian News Agency, and international wire services. 
While these are more reliable than most Turkish press sources, they 
are not necessarily unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish 
General Staff (TGS) website which documents contacts/clashes with 
the PKK.  Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such as 
Neu-Isenburg People's Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to 
report higher numbers of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and 
are often otherwise unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) From July 8 to 15, 2007, three security officials were killed 
in action (KIA) or in explosions of improvised explosive devices 
(IEDs). 
 
¶3. (U) From July 8-15, three PKK terrorists were killed in action, 
three were captured, and four surrendered, including two who were 
turned over to Turkish authorities by Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
(PUK) forces at the border crossing at Habur Gate. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported three clashes that occurred between 
security forces and PKK terrorists in southeastern Turkey during the 
reporting period.  Security forces unearthed eight PKK shelters and 
caves and seized booby-trapped land mines; other explosive 
materials, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; satellite antennas; 
and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) On July 9, a sheep stepped on a PKK land mine near Semdinli 
in Hakkari Province.  The shepherd was slightly injured and four of 
his sheep perished. 
 
¶6. (U) On July 9, the PKK raided a mine in a mountainous region of 
Hatay Province, stealing three cell phones that belonged to workers 
there, as well as food.  They also destroyed machinery at the mine 
as they departed. 
 
¶7. (U) On July 10, the PKK detonated a bomb near the Acemoglu Bridge 
in Kemah, Erzincan Province as a freight train transporting marble 
was passing over the bridge.  Two train cars were damaged. 
 
¶8. (U) On July 10, the PKK detonated a remote-controlled explosive 
on a rail line near Pulumur in Tunceli Province.  Two rail cars of a 
freight train were derailed as a result. 
 
¶9. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
