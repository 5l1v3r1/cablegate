     ¶B. TUNIS 184 
 
¶1. (SBU) On April 3, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a 
diplomatic note granting the value added tax exemption for 
the North Africa American Cemetery and Memorial irrigation 
project.  The exemption documents were available and obtained 
April 6 from the local tax office.  The MFA note made mo 
mention of a requirement for a list of Mission employees 
despite the document so requesting earlier that week. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  We are providing the exemption document to the 
contractor and believe the issues reported in reftels are 
resolved.
