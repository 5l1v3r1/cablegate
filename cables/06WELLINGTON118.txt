SUBJECT:  UNESCO CONVENTION NOT THE SUBJECT OF ATTENTION IN NEW 
ZEALAND AT THE PRESENT TIME 
 
REF: STATE 19851 
 
¶1.  (SBU) As far as Post can tell, the UNESCO Convention on the 
Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expression 
has, at this stage, not appeared on the legislative or media radar 
in New Zealand.  There is no reference or record of the convention 
at all on the official legislative agenda.  Nor is there any 
reference to the convention in the agenda of business at Select 
Committee level, including the Committee that specifically deals 
with the ratification of international treaties and conventions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A review of the media over the past 12 months reveals that 
there has been no mention of the convention at all.  There also does 
not seem to be any effort by UNESCO in New Zealand to promote the 
convention, prompt a dialogue about it, or even explain it.  As a 
consequence, at present there is no public debate on the convention 
in New Zealand whatsoever. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post will continue to be on the lookout for any sign that 
New Zealand intends to implement the convention.
