 ¶1. (SBU) Summary: On June 9, 2005, PNP DIRANDRO Special 
Operations Group, aided by NAS helicopters, seized a major 
cocaine HCL laboratory on the River Ene in the VRAE.  At the 
site, the Special Ops group found half a metric ton of 
cocaine hcl along with 1 metric ton of cocaine base, as well 
as 3 tons of precursor chemicals, several high caliber 
weapons, and sophisticated equipment to manufacture cocaine. 
Police estimate the laboratory complex had the capacity to 
produce 3 tons of cocaine hcl on a weekly basis.  Later that 
evening, traffickers attempted to re-enter the laboratory, 
resulting in a fire fight with the police.  No injuries 
resulted.  The traffickers absconded, but the investigation 
continues with arrests anticipated.  The PNP will hold a 
press conference in Lima June 10 to reveal this major 
seizure. Their investigation links Colombian traffickers to 
the operation of the laboratory. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Mid-day June 9, a NAS-supported DINANDRO Special 
Operations Group swooped in via helicopter on a cocaine 
laboratory near Puerto Ocopa, on the banks of the River Ene 
(VRAE).  The PNP team found a compound with 4 security posts 
that covered an area of about 5 acres.  It comprised 14 sound 
structures constructed of wood, with corrugated iron roofs 
covered by plastic and camoflagued by foliage to thwart 
detection from the air, all connected by walkways.  The 
compound had a running water system with showers and flush 
toilets.  Electricity was provided by a 60 KW generator, 
buried underground to muffle noise, capable of running a 
small township.  Inside one lab facility the police found 500 
kilos of cocaine HCL and in another 1,000 kilos of cocaine 
base.  Three tons of essential chemicals were stored in 
plastic garbage-cans. Some large evaporator tanks, used to 
process acetone, apparently had been made on the site in one 
of the 2 welding shops.  Twenty micro-wave ovens stood in 
rows along a shelf, along with other drying equipment used to 
process cocaine.  The police estimated that the laboratory 
was capable of producing up to 3 tons of cocaine HCL a week. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Weaponry left at the site included a Mini-14, 1 
Gallil-type, an M-16, 22 rifles, a shotgun and a 38 Smith 
Wesson.  Police also found detonators and explosives, and 7.6 
ammunition for an AK-47. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In the mess hall, the police found a half-eaten 
lunch spread out on a table, hurriedly abandoned at the 
arrival of the helicopters. The fully equipped kitchen had 
food supplies that could support 30 people for a month. 
Separate male and female sleeping quarters were in neat 
condition; on one bunk was a Spanish language magazine with 
Osama Bin Laden on he cover (the headline: "Islamic leader or 
Cruel terrorist?"). 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  After separating out the drugs, the police 
destroyed chemicals and moved to a base perimeter.  During 
the late evening hours of June 9, traffickers attempted to 
re-enter the laboratory compound.  A fire fight ensued with 
the police, who repelled the traffickers with no injuries. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  On June 10, the PNP will do a press briefing on 
the seizure of this significant laboratory.  They have some 
investigative leads.  Our police contacts have told us they 
hope to make some arrests shortly. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Comment:  The laboratory seized appears to be 
quite a significant operation in the major coca "source zone" 
of Peru.  Various telltale indicators led police 
invest
