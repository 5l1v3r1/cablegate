Drug Price Cuts 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to a pharmaceutical LAWG group member, 
the Ministry of Health has published its ordinances for 
cutting official prices for imported pharmaceuticals by 13 
percent.  The ordinances were published in the Polish 
language Journal of Law no. 101, on 19 June 2006.  The 
publication of the ordinances is the formal next step 
required to implement the draft regulations on July 1.

Inter-Ministerial Issues? 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The published ordinances themselves do not contain 
language regarding the price cuts.  However, they reference 
the "amending . . . [of] the level of payment" (i.e. the 13 
percent price cut) for drugs.  The Ministry's letter to the 
Association of Innovative Pharmaceutical Companies 
reinforces this message (we understand Washington agencies 
have received this response from PhRMA).  Econoff spoke to 
Krzystof Januszek (protect), head of the WTO Unit at the 
Ministry of Economy, about the latest developments. 
Interestingly, he said that the Ministry had sent a letter 
to Piecha urging consultations not only with the affected 
foreign industry, but also WITH THE MINSITRY OF ECONOMY (his 
emphasis).  Although he was sufficiently discreet about the 
contents of the Ministry's letter, his assessment of the 
price cut issue does not appear to differ dramatically with 
our talking points.  Januszek added, however, that Piecha 
and the Ministry of Health "did not respond to the Economic 
Ministry's letter, not even with a phone call or an email."

Comment

¶3. (SBU) There may be an opportunity for the USG to exploit 
the apparent gap between the trade authorities and the 
Health Ministry.  But any enthusiasm for this approach 
should be tempered with the awareness that principals in the 
Ministry of Health seem not to care what anyone else thinks.
