COMMENT: 
 
¶11.  With his New Democratic Party's majority victory in the 
2009 Nova Scotia provincial election, Darrell Dexter became the 
first-ever NDP Premier east of the province of Ontario.  As 
party faithful and election-watchers unequivocally concluded, 
the party's historic victory is attributable to one major 
factor:  the strength of party leader, and now premier, Darrell 
Dexter.  Dexter is highly regarded by friends and political foes 
alike as a nice, down-to-earth kind of guy who has the interests 
of his constituents at heart.  However, his victory came about 
primarily through his skill as a natural consensus builder, 
evidenced early on by his ability to bring together several 
differing factions within own his party.  When he became NDP 
leader in 2001, Dexter inherited a party that still had a heavy 
influence of what pundits like to call the "fiery, socialist old 
guard"--members who were bitterly opposed to people like Dexter 
who wanted to move the party to a more centrist position on the 
political spectrum. 
 
¶12.  Dexter believed the party's only hope to achieve success at 
the ballot box would be soften its socialist edges and present 
the party as a viable alternative to the province's two 
traditional parties:  the Progressive Conservatives (Tories) and 
the Liberals.  As he began to implement that strategy, some of 
the old guard left, chastising Dexter for abandoning those who 
had helped build the party.  Others, however, were convinced to 
join him in this new middle-of-the-road quest, swayed by what 
they saw as Dexter's sound and pragmatic approach to achieving 
electoral success.  In a few short years the party was 
noticeably different from that of its earlier days:  a party 
which still held true to the socialist principle of making life 
better for Nova Scotians, but one which also put a heavy 
emphasis on fiscal responsibility and working cooperatively with 
business and industry. 
 
¶13.  As Dexter set out to sell his party to the electorate, he 
was initially viewed with some suspicion, as voters were afraid 
of embracing a "socialist" premier who they had no doubt would 
be committed to raising taxes and driving business out of the 
province.  But through Dexter's growing credibility, he slowly 
turned around the skeptics to the point where they started to 
take him seriously and began to see him as having the right 
stuff to be the premier.  With that he was able to attract 
credible candidates to run for the party, along with a large

cadre of volunteers to help mount a highly successful election 
campaign.  The result was Dexter leading his party to the 
pinnacle of success on June 9, 2009:  a majority win and an 
undeniable vote of confidence from Nova Scotians. 
 
¶14.  Post has had a longstanding cordial relationship with 
Dexter and his inner circle of advisors who come from both the 
old and young guards of the party.  All, like their predecessors 
the Tories, attach great importance to issues of interest to the 
United States: fostering bilateral trade, increasing energy 
exports to the United States, and working cooperatively with the 
Canadian federal government on secure border issues.  Dexter is 
also a frequent visitor to the United States, primarily to play 
golf even if (as he has confided) it means going by himself when 
none of his golfing partners is available to travel with him. 
Overall, post anticipates seeing this cordial relationship 
continue and expand as this well-liked and respected Premier 
settles down to implementing an agenda overwhelmingly embraced 
by the voters of Nova Scotia.  END COMMENT.
