¶1.  On August 29, 2005, Econoff delivered non-paper to 
Doris Osterlof, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade (COMEX), 
Melissa Delgado, Advisor to the Minister, and Ronald 
Obaldia of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  COMEX is the 
lead GOCR organization on this issue and shared the 
information with other Ministries involved in the matter of 
food aid. 
 
¶2.  In a letter dated September 1, 2005 in which he 
responded to the non-paper, COMEX Minister Manuel Gonzalez 
wrote "... as discussed in the Agriculture Committee, food 
aid disciplines should ensure that such aid does not distort 
local markets of beneficiary nations nor displace exports 
from other member countries, nor be used in such a manner as 
to elude complying with export agreements or requirements." 
He further offered that "...Costa Rica will continue to 
focus on food aid in the following areas: evaluation of 
needs, role of organizations, food aid in the form of 
donations and grants, transparency, and emergency food aid." 
He specifically addressed the non-paper topic as follows: 
"With respect to the proposal presented by your government, 
we will study it and expect to make pertinent comments at 
the next special meeting of the Agriculture Committee in 
September."
