¶4.      GUNDEM: The daily reports that KKK, the political wing 
of the PKK, denied any links with the explosion that took place 
in Ankara.  It further pointed out that the attack, which 
coincided with a political turmoil in the pre-election period,

Solidarity Party), and EMEP (Party of Labor) held a joint press 
announcement in Istanbul and condemned the Ankara bombing. 
 
¶5.      GUNDEM: The daily reminds that the perpetrators of the

attack, said he would file a petition against the authorities 
with the European Court of Human Rights. 
 
¶6.      GUNDEM: Ozlem Aktan, a journalist from the Gundem 
daily, has been sentenced to three years in prison because of a 
September 2006 article which included PKK statements and made 
propaganda for the PKK.  Separately, the daily reported that the 
number of people extending support to hunger strikes initiated 
in several cities in Europe and Turkey in order to draw 
attention to the health condition of Abdullah Ocalan in his 
prison conditions was increasing.  Currently, a total of 1364 
people are reportedly participating in the hunger strikes.
