REF: STATE 84640 
 
(SBU)  On June 7 we met with Jan Arve Knutsen, Deputy 
Director General and Head of the MFA's Section for 
Disarmament and Nonproliferation.  Knutsen confirmed that 
Norway will send "higher officials" to the June 23 High-Level 
Political Meeting (HLPM) for the Proliferation Security 
Initiative in Warsaw.  The Norwegian delegation will include 
representatives from the MFA, law enforcement agencies, and 
the Ministries of Justice, Customs and Defense.  Knutsen 
remarked that the Norwegians decided not to send "political 
level" representatives (including the State Secretary level) 
based on discussions with colleagues from other European 
countries (who have opted to do the same).
