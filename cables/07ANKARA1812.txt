Anatolian Eagle Exercise-2006/2 Takes Place in Konya 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶1. The joint air force Anatolian Eagle Exercise-2007/2 (second 
exercise of the year) took place in Konya June 11-22.  United 
States, Britain, Pakistan, Jordan and NATO attended the exercise. 
The first Anatolian Eagle Exercise was held in 2001. 
 
Government-Military Focus on Terrorism 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. Intensive civil-military talks were held in Ankara in June. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul met with Deputy CHOD GEN Ergin 
Saygun on June 8 to discuss developments in Iraq and the fight 
against terrorism. 
 
PM Erdogan hosted FM Gul, Land Forces Commander GEN Ilker Basbug, 
Interior Minister Osman Gunes and Jandarma Forces Commander GEN Isik 
Kosaner at a June 12 security meeting.  The Prime Ministry released 
a statement after the meeting noting that fight against terrorism 
has the highest priority for the country.  Political analysts 
interpreted the meeting as an attempt to show unity between the 
Turkish General Staff (TGS) and the government.  The National 
Security Council convened under President Ahmet Necdet Sezer on June 
¶20.  Various aspects of fight against terrorism as well as recent 
developments on the Cyprus issue were discussed.  PM Erdogan was 
briefed on June 21 by CHOD GEN Buyukanit on terrorist camps in 
northern Iraq and along the Iran-Iraq border. 
 
Turkish Media Reacts to Hudson Institute's "Turkey Scenarios" 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3. Turkish media reacted to the meeting held by the Hudson Institute 
in Washington on June 13 in which possible "crisis scenarios" were 
discussed.  The scenarios reportedly included an assassination of 
head of the Constitutional Court and a PKK suicide attack in which 
50 people were killed.  Participants reportedly included Turkish 
military officers.  Reacting to reports of the meeting, FM Abdullah 
Gul said Turkish officers attending the meeting should have walked 
out when the disaster scenarios were raised.  PM Tayyip Erdogan 
commented that the meeting was "utter nonsense."   The TGS released 
a statement condemning efforts to link Turkish military to Hudson 
Institute crisis scenarios for Turkey.  The statement denounced the 
media reports and noted that military officers attended the meeting 
for only a brief period and that the alleged scenarios were not 
discussed in their presence.  Commentary on the Hudson Institute 
meeting was featured in the Ankara press for a number of days and 
caused controversy.  Several newspapers criticized the TGS for its 
allegedly untruthful denial statement. 
 
Turkey's Security Relations with Other Countries 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. China: Turkish Land Forces Commander Ilker Basbug visited Chinese 
National Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan on June 3.  Noting China's 
growing military and economic power, GEN Basbug said, "Turkey and 
China have similar viewpoints on world matters.  There are 
similarities in threats faced by the two countries."  GEN Basbug 
left Beijing on June 8 after visiting Chinese National Defense 
University. (ANA)

Air Defense Army Headquarters in St. Petersburg during his official
