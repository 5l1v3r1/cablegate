SUBJECT: NANGARHAR POLITICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PERSONALITIES 
 
REF: Kabul 175 
 
¶1. (SBU) Nangarhar's political scene is dominated by a handful of 
individuals.  Personal loyalty and tribal affiliations are often 
more important that competence or qualifications in determining who 
has influence in the province. 
 
Gul Agha Sherzai - Governor 
--------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Governor since 2004, Sherzai is the dominant player in 
Nangarhar politics, often ruling through force of personality.  He 
has aspirations for national leadership and regards himself as a 
viable presidential candidate.  A large man with a commanding 
presence, he often physically intimidates his rivals.  He is a poor 
listener who always tries to dominate the conversation.  A weak 
administrator, Sherzai represents the epitome of a strong Pashtun 
leader, balancing tribes and loyalty networks against each other to 
enhance his position.  He generously distributes financial support 
to different groups -- especially the elders of the province, 
journalists, parliamentarians, and provincial council members -- to 
secure their support.  He is also the chief elder of the Barakzai 
tribe in Kandahar, which has a traditionally higher status than 
President Karzai's Popalzai tribe. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Sherzai approaches governing more as a commander-in-chief 
than as a governor.  Although he formerly was a powerful 
Mahz-e-Milli commander in southern Afghanistan, party affiliation is 
a minor component of his power.  Nonetheless, his Jihadi credentials 
are key to his influence.  Upon his arrival in Nangarhar, he 
immediately established his supremacy by challenging the local 
commanders to stand up to him.  He takes full advantage of both his 
government post and the support of central government figures to 
extend his control.  His main base of Nangarhar support is among the 
Mohmand tribe, with some support among the Shinwaris.  He has the 
least support among the Khogyanis, primarily because he has 
dismissed several prominent Khogyanis from government posts since 
arriving in Nangarhar. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sherzai also fully exploits financial opportunities 
available to him as the governor of a province with the major 
highway linking Kabul and Islamabad.  Although most Nangarhar 
residents recognize that Sherzai illegally collects revenues, they 
credit him with using at least a portion of that money to 
reconstruct Nangarhar.  In addition, he makes a show of his support 
for the central government and the Coalition.  He cultivates good 
relations with the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), Coalition 
commanders, the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan 
(UNAMA) and the rest of the international community.  He sometimes 
exploits these relationships to his own advantage, threatening his 
rivals that he can turn the Coalition against them. 
 
Fazal Hadi Muslimyar - Provincial Council Chairman 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶5. (SBU) Muslimyar is a young, dynamic leader on the rise.  He comes 
from Chaparhar District in central Nangarhar and is a member of the 
Dawlatzai Tribe.  His relationship with President Karzai is 
reportedly close and growing closer, and he is rumored to be in line 
to manage Karzai's reelection campaign in the eastern region.  He is 
the protege of the late Abdul Halim Malingyar, who was a powerful 
Jihadi commander from southe
