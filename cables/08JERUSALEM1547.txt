The three dailies lead with news of a donation by the European Union 
to the Palestinian Authority worth 77 million euros.  According to 
the reports, 37 million euros will go to support of public service 
infrastructure and 40 million euros to help the Palestinian 
Authority cover expenses. The agreement was signed by Palestinian 
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and the Head of the EU Office in the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, John Kjaer, in Ramallah. Following the 
signing, Fayyad praised the supporting role of the EU. 
 
Al-Quds highlights news of commemorations planned for the 39th 
anniversary of the burning Al-Aqsa Mosque to take place on August 
¶21. According to a statement issued by the Palestinian National 
Council, the anniversary occurs this year amidst continuing Israeli 
conspiracies against Al-Aqsa Mosque. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam report that the two ships "Free Gaza" and 
"Liberty" arrived in Larnaka, Cyprus on August 20. In a statement, 
the organization sponsoring the ships said passengers on the two 
ships will now transfer to one ship, which will continue to Gaza. 
An additional 20 passengers from Larnaka will join the ship to make 
the final voyage to Gaza.  Preparations for their departure will 
include a prayer for the 5000 Palestinians who have died since 
September 2000 and 34 sailors who died on the USS Liberty in 1967. 
The prayer will take place on August 21. 
 
All dailies report on Israeli actions in Jerusalem and the West 
Bank. Al-Ayyam cites a WAFA report that East Jerusalemites blocked 
an August 20 attempt by Jewish "extremists" to occupy land in 
Al-Thori neighborhood in East Jerusalem close to King David's tomb. 
Related coverage in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida cited reports that Israeli 
forces closed two local radio stations in Hebron on August 20 under 
the claim that their broadcasts interrupt military frequencies. 
 
All dailies cite a WAFA report that the Palestinian Ministry of 
Prisoners' Affairs announced that the prisoners' release has been 
delayed to sometime after Friday, August 22. 
 
Al-Ayyam reports that Al-Qassam Brigades warned the Israeli 
government that Gilad Shalit will meet the same fate as the Israeli 
pilot Ron Arad who disappeared in Lebanon if the Israeli government 
continues delaying the prisoners' exchange deal. 
 
Al Quds carries news that a representative from the U.S. Consulate 
General Jerusalem and another from Creative Associates visited the 
Ebeydiyeh municipality and the Ebeydiyeh Youth Club in order to 
discuss possible cooperation.

¶1. Independent Al-Quds runs an editorial by the Secretary General of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Abdul Rahim 
Mallouh, entitled, "Why?!!!" (8/21): "[T]he important lesson 
Palestinian decision-makers, in particular, and the Palestinian 
people, in general, should take [from international negotiations] is 
that direct and indirect negotiations and agreements... have 
reversed the [Palestinian] people's cause years back. [These 
negotiations and agreements] have squandered the [Palestinian 
people's] sacrifices and achievements during their long struggle... 
the big question that is raised is why do the Palestinian people 
 
JERUSALEM 00001547  002 OF 002 
 
 
accept or even insist on continuing such negotiations after it is 
clear that they are absurd and even harmful?!!!..." 
¶2. Independent Al-Ayyam carries an editorial by regular columnist 
Abdullah Awwad entitled, "The Dialogue" (8/21): "[T]he coming 
dialogue in Cairo is a failure because...Hamas is not interested in 
dialogue or in agreement unless it is decided that Hamas can 
maintain military control in the Gaza Strip and be the sole leader 
of all the Palestinian people. The truce with Israel increased 
Hamas' arrogance expressed in its reaction to the beach bombings [in 
the Gaza Strip]. Now, [Hamas'] good relations with Jordan will 
increase [Hamas'] arrogance because [Hamas] will have now reached 
the same status as Fatah and the same attitude that its authority 
should be eternal. There is no need to give the Cairo dialogue any 
other interpretation than that ... it is a dialogue with no 
result... a dialogue which will pave the way to a new wave of bloody 
violence... Hamas is joining the dialogue only because it is 
incapable of giving up [authority]..."
