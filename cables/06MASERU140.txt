REF: STATE 20173 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel, Ambassador raised points on Venezuela and 
Guatemala as contenders for the GRULAC seat for the UN Security 
Council (2007-2008) during March 16 discussions with the GOL 
Foreign Minister. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Venezuela's troubling disruption of international 
events, including the disruption of the Community of Democracy 
meeting in Chile and the Summit of the Americas in Venezuela, as 
well as its rejection of the Outcome Document, were signs that 
similar behavior could compromise UNSC proceedings and 
objectives.  Guatemala, on the other hand, has been a supportive 
and responsible member of the international community, 
contributing to six global peacekeeping operations, including 
the Congo.  While Venezuela has served on the UNSC four times, 
Guatemala has never done so. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) FOMIN Moleleki acknowledged the importance of the 
GRULAC non-permanent seat and of the upcoming secret ballot in 
October.  He was not fully familiar with the international roles 
of either GRULAC nation.  However, he stated the importance of 
the principle that nations who had not had the opportunity to 
serve be offered that chance.  He did not make a firm commitment 
to support Guatemala, but said Lesotho would seriously consider 
its position.
