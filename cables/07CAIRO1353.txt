(SBU) On May 8, a member of Arab League Secretary General 
Moussa's cabinet staff told poloffs that the League was 
heavily engaged in the ongoing political strife in the 
Comoros Islands, one of the League's 22 member states.  The 
head of the AL Secretariat's Office of African Affairs, Samir 
Hosni, was traveling to the Comoros on May 8 to "mediate" 
between the disputing parties.  We will seek a read-out of 
Hosni's efforts upon his return.  The League has not yet 
taken any public positions on the conflict in the Comoros.
