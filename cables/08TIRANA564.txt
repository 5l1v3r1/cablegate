REF: SECSTATE 80088 
 
¶1.  (U) DCM and PolOff delivered reftel points to MFA 
International Organizations Director Islam Lauka on July 25. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Lauka said that the GOA had not yet decided 
officially on whether or not to attend the NAM conference, 
but said that a decision would be made by the end of the day 
on July 25. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Lauka assured the DCM that in the event Albania 
decides to participate, it will attend as the guest of the 
NAM, and not of Iran, and that Albania will be represented at 
the deputy minister level only.  Lauka said the goal of any 
Albanian participation would be to lobby for recognition of 
Kosovo.
