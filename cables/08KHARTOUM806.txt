WARN OF WAR 
 
¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY: The Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC) 
held an extraordinary plenary session May 25 to address recent 
violence in Abyei, a situation that all agreed is a "crisis." 
Members of the international community joined AEC Chairman Derek 
Plumbly in pressing the two parties to exercise extreme restraint, 
to allow unhindered UNMIS access to the entire Abyei area, and to 
redouble efforts to agree on implementation of the CPA's Abyei 
Protocol.  In their presentations, the SPLM and the NCP restated 
their prior positions, but agreed on the need for a political 
solution (although there was divergence as to as to what this 
means).  Both sides lamented the suffering endured by the local 
population.  The SPLM repeatedly warned the region is on the verge 
of war if the Abyei crisis is not solved, and said the threat will 
remain acute until the Abyei protocol is implemented, including the 
ABC (Abyei Boundary Commission) report.  The NCP agreed that a 
political settlement was urgently needed, and reiterated its support 
for the Abyei Protocol, but said that its objections to the ABC 
report are well known and remain.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Reflecting the seriousness of the situation in Abyei, all of 
the foreign "stakeholders" to the CPA agreement attended the May 25 
session.  Those addressing the session included representatives of 
the embassies of the U.S., UK, Norway, Netherlands, Italy, France 
(representing the E.U.'s Slovenian Presidency), EU, African Union, 
Kenya (as AEC vice chair), Ethiopia, and the UN.  The SPLM in 
particular was represented by a high-level delegation of Pagan Amum 
(GonU Cabinet Affairs Minister and SPLM Secretary General) and Deng 
Alor (GoNU Foreign Minister and SPLM Polit-Bureau member).  The NCP 
delegation was led by Presidential Advisor Sayed el Khatib.

¶3.  (U) AEC Chairman Plumbly opened the meeting with a brief review 
of tensions in Abyei.  He stressed several times that the situation 
represents the most serious threat to the CPA in the agreement's 
history.  Between fifty and one hundred thousand people have been 
left homeless and are now IDPs.  One of the most alarming aspects of 
the situation is that fighting broke out within the JIUs (Joint 
Integrated Units).  No decision has been taken to allow UNMIS 
unfettered access to the area. 
 
¶4.  (U) In turn, every member of the foreign stakeholders spoke up 
to second Plumbly's plea to the two parties.  U.S. DCM Powers 
underscored the gravity of the situation regarding Abyei, the need 
for humanitarian access to the area, and the need to implement the 
Abyei protocol.  Finally, he said, there was a need for an impartial 
investigation of the events leading up to the violence.  These 
sentiments were to be shared by all the foreign delegations.

¶5.  (U) The NCP acknowledged the seriousness of the problem in 
Abyei, and said "we want to see this contained as soon as possible."
