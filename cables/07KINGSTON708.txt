¶1. (U) Poloff sent talking points to XXXXXXXXXXXX,
International Organizations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Foreign Trade.  All relevant officials at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade - including XXXXXXXXXXXX -
have been involved in two days of training and have been
unavailable for comment.  Poloff is scheduled to meet with
XXXXXXXXXXXX on Monday, May 14 and will report Jamaica's
response septel.

¶2. (SBU) Post, however, is able to give a preliminary
assessment of the Government of Jamaica's (GOJ) response
based on previous demarches delivered on UN voting.  The GOJ,
on matters of UN voting, seldom reveals their intended vote.
Generally, the GOJ reports to emboff that Jamaica is a
sovereign nation and will exercise its own judgment at the
time the vote is cast.  Jamaica currently votes approximately
12 percent of the time in concordance with the U.S.
