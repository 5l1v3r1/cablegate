SUBJECT: UN REQUEST FOR USG ACTION ON REGISTER OF DAMAGES 
FROM SEPARATION BARRIER 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary and Action Request:  The UN is quietly 
asking select member states to submit recommendations for one 
of three positions on the Board of the Register of Damages 
related to the construction of the Israeli separation 
barrier.  The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution 
December 15, 2006, to establish the Register, despite USG 
opposition.  The Board will have the overall responsibility 
for the establishment and maintenance of the Register; the UN 
expects to hire attorneys with skills in claim management. 
(A copy of the Terms of Reference has been e-mailed to 
IO/UNP.)  The UN is soliciting candidates from five states in 
the Western Hemisphere, including the United States.  A 
response is due by March 30.  Action Request in para 4.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Vladimir Goryayev, the deputy director of the UN's 
office of Asia and the Pacific division in the Department of 
Political Affairs, asked to meet with USUN February 28 to 
discuss next steps on establishing the Register of the 
Damages, as mandated by UNGA resolution A/ES-10/L.20/Rev.1. 
He was joined by staff member Guillaume Blanc.  Goryayev 
noted the UNGA resolution mandated the establishment of the 
Register within six months of its adoption, but stated the UN 
could not meet that timeline.  He confirmed that the office 
will be in Vienna, and that the UN seeks to adhere strictly 
to the limited mandate of compiling claims and to take no 
action on verification, evaluation, or compensation.  He 
reported that Palestinian PR Riyadh Mansour had sought to 
establish links between the Register and other UN bodies in 
the territories (e.g., UNRWA), but that the UN had rejected 
this proposal. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Describing what he characterized as "shared 
interests" between the UN and the USG in ensuring the Board 
is composed of impartial and objective professionals, 
Goryayev explained that the UN is quietly soliciting 
candidates from select member states in the Americas, Europe, 
and Asia.  In the Western Hemisphere, the UN will approach 
the USG, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina.  Goryayev 
said the board members would be hired on a "when actually 
employed basis" at the UN rank of D2.  He expected their 
duties would involve trips to Vienna four times each year and 
that each trip was estimated to take two weeks.  Travel 
expenses would be reimbursed.  They hope the first meeting 
can be scheduled for May 1.  He explained the UN is looking 
for candidates with "international exposure" and experience 
as an attorney in claim management.  The UN believes it would 
be inappropriate to hire any national government officials. 
The UN is seeking gender balance and therefore would welcome 
female candidates. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Action Request:  USUN requests guidance on how to 
respond to this solicitation.
