On June 14, Poloff delivered reftel talking points to Pamela 
Ingleton, International Organizations Department, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade (MFAFT).  Ingleton accepted 
the message, and acknowledged that she had received the May 
27 Swiss Circular Note.  She agreed that there is no reason 
to wait any longer to convene a diplomatic conference, and 
that delaying in anticipation of peace in the Middle East 
could mean postponing the matter indefinitely.  Asked whether 
the GOJ would indicate its support for a late-November 
conference, Ingleton replied that she would review the 
Circular Note and suggested that the GOJ might reply after 
the June 17 deadline proposed by the Swiss.  Post will report 
any further details as they become available.
