TRANSPORTATION 
-------------- 
 
¶4. (U) All official travelers must possess a Korean visa to enter 
the country.  Travelers may contact the nearest Korean 
Consulate/Embassy to obtain a visa.  It is post policy to meet and 
assist visitors only at the rank of Ambassador, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary and above.  The group will not be met at the airport. 
Airport buses and taxis are available as follows: 
 
¶A. Taxi: 
A-1) Regular (white cap or blue cap): In front of exit gate No. 7A 
or 7B.  Fee will be around 60,000 won, including toll fee.  Normally 
white cap provides better service. 
A-2) Deluxe (black color with yellow cap): In front of exit gate No. 
11A or 11B.  Fee will be almost twice as much as the regular taxis. 
 
¶B.  Bus (KAL Limousine):

Hotel, on the side of the bus.  Tell the bus driver that you want to 
get off at the Lotte Hotel. 
 
There is a departure tax of 27,000 won for all non-diplomatic 
passport holders.  For travelers on diplomatic passports, the 
departure tax should have been added to your ticket by your travel 
office.  If your travel office has already added the tax to the 
price of your tickets you can pick up a refund when leaving Korea. 
After going through immigration look for the tax refund kiosk (one 
is located near Gate 28) and present your passport and tickets for a 
cash refund. 
 
THREAT ASSESSMENT 
----------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Americans in Seoul are subject to worldwide threat from 
international terrorists, although we have no information to suggest 
any specific terrorists threats directed at Americans here. 
Political demonstrations occur frequently in Seoul, and are 
occasionally anti-American.  Americans can minimize personal risk by 
staying away from demonstrations and by avoiding confrontation or 
altercations with protestors.  While relatively infrequent by U.S. 
standards, street crime does occur.  Most reported crimes involve 
pick-pocketing in tourist areas and are predominantly non-violent in 
nature.  The security precautions a person would take in any large 
city are appropriate throughout South Korea. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) As a matter of prudence, you must assume that all rooms, 
telephones, cellular phones, and fax machines can be monitored.  You 
should not discuss sensitive or classified information in 
uncontrolled areas.  Official travelers should ensure that hard-copy 
and electronic sensitive information is not left in hotel rooms. 
 
Computers, including laptops and Personal Digital Assistants, cannot 
be brought into the Embassy except with prior permission from the 
RSO office. 
 
¶7.  (U) Police are considered capable and well trained.  Seoul 
metropolitan authorities staff English-speaking personnel 24 hours 
daily to handle local emergencies.  Telephone numbers are as 
follows: 112 police emergency, 119 fire and ambulance.
