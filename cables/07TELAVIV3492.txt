(SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche to Sandra Simovich in 
the MFA Human Rights and International Organizations 
Department on December 10.  Simovich underlined that Israel 
was also concerned about prospects for the passage of these 
resolutions, especially the resolution condeming Iran, which 
narrowly avoided being stopped by a no-action motion in the 
Third Committee.  Israel plans to attend the plenary session 
that votes on these country-specific resolutions in order to 
support them.
