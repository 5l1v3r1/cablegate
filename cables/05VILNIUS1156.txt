SUBJECT: GOL CONDEMNS IRANIAN PRESIDENT'S REMARKS ABOUT 
ISRAEL 
 
 
¶1.  (U) The Baltic News Service agency reported October 27 
that an MFA spokesperson made the following statement in 
response to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's comments 
regarding Israel. 
 
¶2.  (U) Begin text of statement. 
 
Lithuania condemns the exhortations by Iran's President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to 'erase' the state of Israel 'off the 
map.'  We emphasize that the state of Israel is a recognized 
member of the international community and therefore such 
statements are irresponsible and conflict with the globally 
accepted principles of international conduct." 
 
End statement. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: This statement augurs well that the GOL 
will promote responsible action on Iran within the EU.
