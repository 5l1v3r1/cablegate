SUBJECT:  SUDAN/DARFUR:  CFC Meeting in El Fasher 
¶1. (SBU) Summary and background:  On July 17, the Darfur Ceasefire 
Commission (CFC) met in El Fasher, Darfur.  Para 2 presents the 
notes of the U.S. Observer.  Noteworthy is that the Sudanese 
Government apparently submitted its Disarmament, Demobilization, and 
 
reintegration (DDR) plan for the Janjaweed to AMIS, although it has 
not yet received even a cursory evaluation.  End summary and 
background. 
¶2. (SBU) The U.S. Observer's notes are as follows: 
Outline of Darfur Ceasefire Commission Meeting of July 17, 2006 
 
Today's CFC Session was attended by all members, with the DFC 
AMIS/1st VC CFC, BG Kamanzi as the chair.  The FC AMIS/CHMN CFC, MG 
Ihikire, is in Brussels for the AMIS Donor's Conference.  Other flag 
officers in attendance were BG Pitty (2nd VC CFC), BG Kalanja (DFC 
UNMIS), and BG Abdallah (Sr GoS Rep of Three). 
 
Answer to query of U.S. Observer regarding status of Janjaweed 
Disarmament Plan (JDP):  At the session of 10 Jul, the 1st VC, 
stated that the GoS submitted a sealed JDP to AMIS and that the FC 
would review the plan while he was at FHQ.  After the FC review, the 
plan would be presented to the CFC as stipulated in the DPA as 
opposed to vetting by AMIS.  The FC did not find the time to review 
the JDP prior to his TDY trip and thus the CFC could not review it. 
Per the DPA timeline, GoS was to submit the plan to the CFC on D+38 
or 23 June, hence it will be at least one month late. 
 
No official investigations are being conducted into alleged DPA 
violations. 
 
All other discussion items were procedural in nature. 
 
AMIS Minutes will be published in day or two. 
 
Next session is scheduled for 19 Jul. 
 
Assessment of U.S. Observer (not stated at session):  SLA (M) Rep 
and SLA (W-signed) Rep do not have situational awareness of 
operational activity in Darfur (purposely or otherwise).  AMIS Daily 
OP SITREP is available to all CFC members.
