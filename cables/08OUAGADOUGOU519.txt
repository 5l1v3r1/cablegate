SUBJECT: Burkina Faso: Meetings with President Compaore and 
Discussion with MFA Cabinet Director on Security Council Meeting on 
Zimbabwe 
 
REF: A) STATE 63183 B) Ouagadougou 514 
 
¶1.  Ambassador met with President Blaise Compaore the evening of June 
¶13.  The President said that he had just discussed Zimbabwe with 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Bassole (currently in Paris) and Burkina 
Faso's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Michael 
Kafando.  The PermRep is awaiting a briefing on the humanitarian 
situation and will then officially  commit to a "yes" vote for a 
Security Council meeting on Zimbabwe.  President Compaore assured the 
Ambassador that Burkina Faso is committed to supporting the meeting. 
Compaore was extremely critical of President Mugabe, saying that he 
is creating a "mess" of his country and that the international 
community must pressure him to ensure stability in the region. He 
expressed his thanks to the United States for helping Africans try to 
solve the Zimbabwe problem. He mentioned that ECOWAS is planning to 
send observers for the elections. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador discussed the Secretary of State's invitation to FM 
Bassole to co-chair a roundtable discussion on Zimbabwe on June 19. 
Compaore fully supports the discussion as a lead up to the formal 
UNSC meeting on the subject. 
 
¶3.  In a separate discussion on July 13, DCM was assured by the 
Foreign Ministry's Cabinet Director Vincent Zakane that Burkina Faso 
would vote affirmatively in favor of a UNSC meeting on Zimbabwe.  He 
reiterated his view that it would be "highly desirable" that the UNSC 
work closely with the African Union.  He stated that both 
institutions should tell the Zimbabwe Government that: the 
international community was closely following preparations for the 
Presidential election run-off, pre-election violence should be ended, 
harassment of the diplomatic corps stopped and civil society be 
allowed to participate fully in a democratic electoral process.
