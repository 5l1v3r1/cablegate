SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/26): Prime Minister outlines 
the path to statehood 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
All front pages report on Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam 
Fayyad announcing in a press conference in Ramallah on August 25 the 
government's plan for ending the occupation and building an 
independent Palestinian state in the next two years. The program 
included Fayyad's vision for building strong institutions that are 
capable of fulfilling the people's needs. He called on the 
international community to help end the occupation so that this 
vision can be implemented. Fayyad also said that legislative and 
presidential elections should take place in January 2010 as 
scheduled. Fayyad is quoted in all dailies saying "we will not 
accept that the transitional period lasts forever and will announce 
the establishment of our state whatever the obstacles." 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page news citing Maan and quoting senior US 
officials saying that Israel and the US are very close to reaching 
an agreement concerning a freeze in settlement construction in the 
West Bank. A senior US official is quoted in Israeli daily Haaretz 
saying "we stated right from the outset what we want regarding the 
settlements, and we are getting close to getting this from Israel." 
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's August 25 meeting with 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in London receives front page 
coverage in the local press. Netanyahu is reported as saying that he 
will not accept limits on sovereignty over Jerusalem and reiterated 
that he would not halt settlement construction in East Jerusalem. 
Netanyahu reportedly stated, "Jerusalem is not a settlement. It is 
the sovereign capital of the State of Israel. We have been building 
in Jerusalem for 3,000 years." 
 
Al-Quds runs front page news that Egypt has postponed the national 
dialogue originally scheduled for August 25 until after Ramadan due 
to the lack of consensus between Hamas and Fatah on several issues. 
Hamas and Fatah continue to trade blame regarding the fate of 
political prisoners, and also disagree about the date for the 
upcoming presidential and legislative elections.------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"Netanyahu-Mitchell meeting is only an Israel step to gain more 
time" (08/26): "Netanyahu's first and last concern is to continue 
settlement construction regardless of any other statements that he 
makes ... We hope that the US understands this and is firm with him. 
We hope that Mitchell conveys a clear message that Jerusalem is 
occupied territory and the settlements are illegal and must stop". 
 
2) Hamada Farana opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
headline "Fatah's conference and Salam Fayyad's government" (08/26): 
"Salam Fayyad has a national program that addresses security, 
development, policy, and the economy. He is no longer a planner or 
an accountant, but is highly professional and highly credible, the 
characteristics that have gained him the trust of the international 
community ... His words about establishing an independent 
Palestinian state emerge from his beliefs that national unity must 
eventually triumph over any conflicts."
