SUBJECT: EDITORIAL ON FOOD CRISIS AND ZIMBABWE'S 
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST 
 
 
  ¶1.   In its November 7 editorial, "NEPAD peer review: 
      why it scares some leaders," the independent daily 
      "Daily News" challenged the Government of Zimbabwe to 
      address allegations of using food aid as a political 
      weapon. Excerpts follow. 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The government has set itself on a 
      political course against the West, with the United 
      States this week threatening to do more than just 
      protest against the unfair distribution of food aid. 
      It is wrong-headed of the government to believe that 
      there are no Zimbabweans who are aggrieved by the use 
      of food aid as a political weapon, and that the 
      accusation by the West is without foundation.  It is 
      just as wrong for the government to believe that all 
      the criticism and condemnation of its political and 
      economic blunders is confined to, or is influenced by, 
      the West.  There are millions of Zimbabweans facing 
      starvation who blame the government for their 
      miserable situation.  They don't need the West to tell 
      them when their empty stomachs are rumbling from 
      hunger.  Instead of stubbornly seeing a Western spy 
      under every bed, the government ought to open its eyes 
      to the consequences of its policies. . .  Sovereignty 
      which places little value on human life is not worth 
      the paper it is written on."
