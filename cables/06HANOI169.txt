¶1. (SBU) In the absence of available higher-level officials 
without a lengthy wait for an appointment, Poloff delivered 
reftel demarche January 20 to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Arms Control Expert Vu Van Mien.  Poloff made the 
point that this is an exceedingly important issue not just 
to the United States but also to the entire international 
community.  Mien stated that Vietnam believes that Iran has 
the right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful 
purposes, but should only do so in accordance with an IAEA 
safeguards regime.  However, Vietnam also strongly supports 
achieving peaceful, diplomatic solutions to international 
problems such as Iran's conflict with the IAEA and the EU. 
Mien said he understood the significance of the demarche and 
pledged to bring the issue, and the U.S. position, to 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Dzy Nien the same day. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Later January 20, Mien called back and informed 
Poloff that the demarche had been delivered to the Foreign 
Minister's desk, and that the FM's staff said the issue 
"needs to be considered carefully in the international 
context."  Mien said that Vietnam would not have an official 
position on the question of referring Iran to the UNSC "for 
some time" because of the sensitivity of the issue and the 
need to develop consensus in the Vietnamese leadership. 
However, he emphasized, Vietnam remains "very concerned" 
about the fact that the IAEA cannot confirm that Iran's 
nuclear research is peaceful.
