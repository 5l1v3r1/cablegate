¶1. Summary:  In response to sustained Consulate advocacy efforts, 
Sao Paulo Governor (and possible PSDB presidential candidate) 
Geraldo Alckmin launched an Interagency Committee to Combat 
Piracy (CICP), which will improve coordination among local, state 
and federal copyright piracy enforcement officials in Brazil's 
wealthiest and most populous state.  This initiative follows 
recent high-profile raids on Sao Paulo's most notorious outlets 
for pirated goods; these actions were also prompted by persistent 
Consulate lobbying of government officials. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  At a well-attended signing ceremony on January 13, Governor 
Alckmin noted that the CICP will be responsible for the planning 
and development of a statewide anti-piracy policy, identifying 
key industries, principal products, primary producers (in and 
outside of Brazil), smuggling and transportation routes, and key 
organizations involved in distribution of pirated goods. The 
CICP's responsibilities will also include developing the state's 
anti-piracy education campaign and creating a mechanism for 
police to exploit anonymous tips about piracy.  The CICP has been 
charged with opening a dialogue and maintaining a relationship 
with domestic and international institutions that fight piracy. 
Participating state agencies include the Governor's staff, the 
State Prosecutors' Council and the Secretariats of Justice, 
Public Security, Finance, Employment, Culture, and 
Science/Technology and Economic Development.  The CICP will meet 
three times a year to discuss state policies and to evaluate 
implementation. 
 
¶3.  In his remarks to an audience of some 200 prominent business 
and political leaders, as well as major media outlets, Governor 
Alckmin declared:  "This is a statewide issue and needs to be 
dealt with at all levels of government, the business sector, and 
civil society.  Today we are establishing the workforce that can 
move this great effort forward."  He also reviewed Sao Paulo 
state's 2005 anti-piracy successes, noting that 1,396 raids were 
conducted, 3,261 police investigations were opened, and 165 
criminals jailed.  Additionally, the state seized 3 million CDs 
and DVDs, 44 million counterfeit toys, and 22 millions 
counterfeit tennis shoes and watches. 
 
¶4.  Comment: Consulate General Sao Paulo's persistent efforts 
with state and local governments to beef up anti-piracy measures 
are starting to produce results.  In meetings with state and 
local government leaders in southern Brazil, CG and other 
consulate officers have urged the creation of state and local 
agencies like the CICP, which is modeled after a similar council 
established in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul (Refs A 
and B). Also as a result of Consulate advocacy efforts, Sao Paulo 
city and state officials pressed federal officials to launch 
recent raids on some of the city's most notorious outlets for 
pirated goods (Ref C).  State and government officials, along 
with private sector organizations, including the Motion Picture 
Association and other industry leaders, have expressed 
appreciation and recognized the critical role the Consulate 
played in bringing about these successes. End Comment.
