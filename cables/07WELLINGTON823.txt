 ¶1.  (SBU)  On November 20, Pol/Econ Counselor met with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) UN Division 
Director Wendy Hinton, regarding the demarche outlined in 
reftel.  Pol/Econ Counselor provided Hinton with a copy of 
the diplomatic note suggested in reftel, as well as a copy of 
Ambassador Prosper's curriculum vitae.  Hinton welcomed the 
USG submission, but noted that New Zealand was still in the 
process of collecting information regarding candidates; the 
GNZ was not in a position to make any comment regarding how 
New Zealand would vote but promised to give every due 
consideration to Ambassador Prosper's candidacy. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Post will report any GNZ feedback on this issue as 
the CERD election approaches.
