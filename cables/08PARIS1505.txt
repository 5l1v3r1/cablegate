French MFA Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GI) 
action officer Thomas Guibert, regarding India and Jordan's

guidance in reftel B.  On July 25, poloff also relayed the 
U.S. request for French participation at the September 4-5 GI 
Conference on Legal and Regulatory Frameworks to Guibert per 
reftel C.  Guibert welcomed the news of the new GI partners; 
France had been particularly interested in India's 
participation.  He also noted that Mauritius plays an 
important regional role, notably as an aerial and maritime 
crossroad, and Guibert viewed its participation in the fight 
against nuclear terrorism as a very positive step.  He also 
noted that Uzbekistan's participation should facilitate the 
fight against trafficking in various areas; moreover, its 
membership reinforces the important role that Central Asia 
plays in the Initiative.  Regarding the GI conference in 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Guibert has relayed the information 
to colleagues in other ministries and will follow up as soon 
as possible to indicate whether or not they will be able to 
send representatives to the conference.
