SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE DEMARCHED ON SEC GENERAL OF INT'L 
RUBBER STUDY GROUP 
 
REF: SECSTATE 10729 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Econoff demarched Vincent Niagne Agnimel, 
Secretary General of the Ivoirian Rubber Association APROMAC 
 
SIPDIS 
and delivered talking points related to U.S. concerns about 
the tenure of Dr. Smits as International Rubber Study Group 
Secretary General.  APROMAC is the designated Ivoirian 
 
SIPDIS 
delegate to the IRSG, because the Ivoirian government has 
failed to pay its contributions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Agnimel told Econoff that ahead of a meeting of 
the IRSG in March in London, he had heard directly from the 
U.S. IRSG representative on the issue of Dr. Smit's 
retention.  While Agnimel will not attend the London meeting, 
he has spoken with the Ivoirian diplomatic delegation in the 
UK, which will represent APROMAC, and delivered instructions. 
 Agnimel pointedly did not/not indicate to Econoff the nature 
of the instructions on how Cote d'Ivoire will vote.
