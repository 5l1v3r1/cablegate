¶1. Action request for Embassies in countries that lead or 
significantly contribute to Provincial Reconstruction 
Teams and USNATO in paragraph 5. 
 
¶2.  The Czech Republic and Embassy Prague are 
co-organizing an international conference on the work of 
Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan 
January 25-27 (reftel).  S/SRAP views the forum as a 
unique opportunity to strengthen coordination in capitals 
of the numerous PRT-contributing countries on key areas of 
the international assistance strategy, including: 
sub-national governance, agricultural development and job 
creation, communications and counter-propaganda, 
civilian-military coordination, and, common measures of 
effectiveness.  S/SRAP would like to use the Prague 
Conference to hold a closed session for Deputy SRAPs, 
senior NATO officials, and civilian and military officials 
from the field to discuss concrete ways to achieve unity 
of effort among PRTs.  This would complement ongoing PRT 
coordination in Kabul.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶3.  The January 25-27 PRT Conference in Prague aims to 
bring together senior- and working-level civilians, 
military, and NGO leaders from Afghanistan and ISAF 
countries involved in PRT operations.  Thus far, more than 
145 invitees have already confirmed their participation. 
The Afghan government has indicated it would send a 
high-level delegation led by the Minister of the 
Independent Directorate for Local Governance Jalani 
Popal. 
 
¶4.  Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan and 
Pakistan Paul Jones is looking forward to leading an 
interagency team to Prague.  Specifically, he would 
participate in a closed pre-conference session on January 
25 to help reach agreement in capitals on concrete 
measures for deepening coordination among Allies on the 
modus operandi and priorities of PRTs.  S/SRAP would like 
PRT-contributing countries to send their Deputy SRAPs or 
appropriate senior Afghanistan-Pakistan policy-maker to 
Prague for this closed pre-conference session on January 
¶25.

Demarche Request 
---------------- 
 
¶5.  For Capitals and USNATO: Washington requests that 
Embassies in countries that lead or significantly 
contribute to PRTs convey the following points: 
 
-- In previous international conferences on Afghanistan we 
have discussed the need for better coordination of our 
security and civilian assistance. 
 
-- PRTs have proven to be an essential stabilization and 
reconstruction tool in Afghanistan since 2001, and the 
international community's renewed focus on governance and 
development in provinces and districts means that PRTs 
will play an even more vital role in the coming months. 
-- The PRT Conference in Prague represents a unique 
opportunity for policy-makers and practitioners to deepen 
our coordination on specific PRT activities in such areas 
as sub-national governance, agricultural development and 
job creation, communications and counter propaganda, and 
civilian-military coordination. 
 
-- Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan and 
Pakistan Paul Jones is considering leading a robust 
interagency team to Prague to hold talks with counterparts 
on possible ways to strengthen unity of effort. 
 
-- SRAP Ambassador Holbrooke strongly encourages Deputy 
SRAPs or appropriate senior official and a senior official 
from NATO to make plans to travel to Prague for these 
 
STATE 00003595  002 OF 002 
 
 
talks. 
 
-- D/SRAP Jones extends his best wishes to [name of Deputy 
SRAP or senior official] and hopes to meet with [him/her] 
in person at the closed pre-conference session with other 
Deputy SRAPs and the opening session of the conference the 
evening of January 25. 
 
¶6.  Please send in your responses by January 20 to S/SRAP 
(POC: S/SRAP Senior Advisor Dereck Hogan) and Embassy 
Prague (POC: Acting DCM John Law).
