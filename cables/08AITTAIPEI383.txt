SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: TAIWAN'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
 
 
¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage March 18 on the presidential election campaigns; on various 
circles in Taiwan that support Tibet; and on the fall of global 
stocks after the sale of Bear Stearns and an emergency cut of a key 
lending rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  The centrist, KMT-leaning 
"China Times" ran a banner headline on page three saying "Big U.S. 
Fed Movement; Global Financial Markets Frightened and Suspicious" 
and published a whole page of stories on reactions from financial 
markets. 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
mass-circulation "Apple Daily" said there are four possible factors 
that will determine whether DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh 
or KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's is elected president. 
A commentary in the pro-unification "United Daily News" criticized 
the DPP's opposition to the "one-China market" proposed by the KMT. 
The commentary, however, cited the example of the DPP government 
opening the local market to U.S. beef and pork and criticized the 
DPP government for having a double standard in policy-making when 
dealing with China versus the U.S.  End summary. 
 
A) "The Final Factors Deciding Ma or Hsieh's Victory or Loss" 
 
The mass-circulation "Apple Daily" [circulation: 500,000] 
editorialized (3/18): 
 
"... With four days left, a few factors will decide victory or loss. 
 (1) Whether light-green voters turn out and support Hsieh.  If it 
happens as it did in the legislative elections, with many abstaining 
or committing apostasy and voting for Ma, then Hsieh will lose.  (2) 
Voters in the middle of the political spectrum might possibly be a 
key minority, although there are not many of them.  The impact of 
their abstention will not be a big one.  Nonetheless, if many of 
them vote for Ma, Hsieh will definitely lose.  If many of them vote 
for Hsieh, Hsieh will not necessarily win but might have a chance. 
(3) It depends on how the [KMT's platform of the] one-China market 
ferments.  If it ferments [i.e. boils over] seriously, Hsieh will 
have a chance; if not seriously, Ma will definitely win.  (4) Ma's 
camp had better pray that the Chinese Communist military does not 
massacre Tibetans as during the Tiananmen Square protests. 
Otherwise, if [the Chinese crackdown in Tibet] turns out to be a 
major international event, it will definitely affect Ma's campaign. 
..." 
 
B) "Enough! Do Not Treat Voters Like Idiots" 
 
Journalist Peng Hui-ming wrote in the "United Notes" column in the 
pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] (3/18): 
 
"Recently the Green camp has fiercely attacked the 'one-China 
market' topic and emphasizes that if the Blue camp [presidential 
candidate Ma Ying-jeou] is elected, China's cheap labor will take 
all the jobs of Taiwan's workers, and the Mainland's dangerous 
products will sicken Taiwan people whenever they touch them.  With 
campaigns going on fervently, one of the strategies is to attack the 
rival's policy weaknesses.  However, distorting facts deliberately 
and engaging in demagoguery is not only politically immoral but also 
is a way of looking down at voters. ... 
 
"Furthermore, dangerous products made in China which have caused 
problems in various countries in recent years have in fact destroyed 
the reputation of products 'made in China.'  However, does the 
government of Taiwan, as a consumer country, use the same yardstick 
to check on imported goods? U.S. beef is under the shadow of mad cow 
disease.  The government, however, vied to be the first to allow the 
import without caring about people's food safety.  Regarding U.S. 
pork containing ractopamine, [the government] even amended the law 
especially to [U.S. pork's] advantage.  The Green camp slams Chinese 
products for hurting people but uses a double-standard to deal with 
dangerous products [from the U.S.]. ..."
