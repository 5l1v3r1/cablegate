SUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT 
GENERAL COMMAND 
Date: April 5th 2009 
Number: G/M/1 
 
TO: The American President Barack Obama 
Through: American Special Envoy for Sudan 
General Scott Gration 
 
Honorable sir, 
And after respect and greetings, 
 
First we welcome you as the new President of the United States of 
America and we appreciate and welcome your great concern for the 
problems of the African continent in general and Darfur in 
particular. 
 
On behalf of the Sudan Liberation Movement and people of Darfur, the 
elders, widows, orphans and children, the displaced and refugees and 
those lost and others gazing into the unknown at the last moments of 
their lives. 
 
Everyone is waiting for your arrival to rescue the people of Darfur 
from killing, hunger, rape, displacement, genocide, and everyone is 
repeating words of renewable hope on your name Barack Obama and 
welcomes you among us. 
 
Sir, the American President, 
Today you are among the people of Darfur in the liberated zones, 
among those who respect you and the American nation and its 
government which has continued to provide a lot of relief and 
humanitarian support, furthermore the American support has been 
reflected in the demonstrations that called for immediate end to the 
violations of the government of Sudan and its Janjaweed militia. We 
have not forgetten the generous support provided by the government 
of the United Sates to try those who committed war crimes, crimes 
against humanity, genocide and ethnic cleansing in Darfur and your 
stance refusing the decision of the government of Sudan for 
expelling the humanitarian organizations working in Darfur. 
 
Sir, the American President, 
Within the mission of the Sudan Liberation Movement and its 
historical struggle is the intent for peaceful dialogue and serious 
negotiations for political settlement of the Sudanese problem in 
Darfur. We have continued to request that the Government of Sudan 
implement the signed agreements, both humanitarian and security, and 
the cessation of hostilities, but as usual the GoS breaches its 
commitments, even those witnessed by the International community. 
 
The government of Sudan has relied on military solutions and the 
creation of large forums to remove the Darfur issue from its 
contextual dimensions, and continued to create new liberation bodies 
to distort the image of the movement, although all those factions 
were originally part of its mother SLA. The government of Sudan has 
utilized the friendship of some countries to polarize their 
military, economic and political support; this is why we have lost 
confidence and trust in accepting initiatives submitted from the 
countries that have had security agreements with the NCP regime. 
Also, the mediators who supported the initiatives could not 
determine the negotiating parties and venues. Additionally, the 
tactic, adopted by the government of Sudan, in bringing new settlers 
from neighboring countries and changing the structure of the land 
tenure of our people who are forcibly displaced from their homeland 
has added additional complications to the Darfur case. 
 
Mr. President, 
The Humanitarian situation is worsening every day because of the 
expulsion of the International Non Governmental Organizations 
(INGOs)that were very effective and accepted by the IDPs and 
refugees', therefore the return of the expelled INGOs is a 
fundamental and crucial demand for the people of Darfur; furthermore 
the Sudanese organizations are totally rejected by all IDPs and 
refugees. 
 
 
KHARTOUM 00000489  002 OF 002 
 
 
Mr. President, 
The Sudan Liberation Movement is hoping from the government of the 
United States of America "particularly we have this case of Darfur 
that raised the international consciousness" to look forward for its 
request of build strong relations represented in building the 
institutional capacities of the movement and upgrade its military 
and political capabilities. 
 
We are confident for your positive response to this request because 
you are the pioneers of freedom and democracy. 
Accept assurance of our respect, everlasting for America the leader 
of freedom and democracy. 
 
Signed, 
The Movement Field Command
