¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The worst flooding in Turkey since 1937 has 
caused serious damage in the underdeveloped Southeast, killing 
at least 40 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless. 
While the GOT has mobilized local military assets and promised 
assistance to the victims, PM Erdogan's hands-off approach has 
angered many in the region and exposed him to criticism by 
opposition parties.  Even if the GOT regains its footing and 
provides needed support to the victims, people in the 
predominantly Kurdish SE are likely to see Erdogan's 
characterization of the disaster as "exaggerated" as proof that 
Ankara still views them as second-class citizens.  End summary. 
 
Deluge Batters Vulnerable SE 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Heavy rains across Turkey in the first week of November 
have caused the worst flooding in the poor, mountainous and 
predominantly Kurdish southeastern provinces of Diyarbakir, 
Sanliurfa, Batman, Mardin, Siirt, Sirnak and Hakkari.  Red 
Crescent's website reported on November 8 that the death toll 
from the flooding was 36, with 5760 people left homeless.   The 
main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) reported a death 
toll of 40.  Because of shoddy construction, ageing 
infrastructure and overcrowding, natural disasters in this 
region exact a heavier toll; many of those killed were in 
vehicles that were swept off roads or on bridges that collapsed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Turkish Red Crescent Headquarters in Ankara told us 
that they sent food and shelter to the region, opened donation 
accounts in banks, and that the situation was "under control." 
Their office in Diyarbakir declined to comment on the current 
situation in the SE, or to provide us with numbers of injured 
and dead, referring us to their website instead. 
 
¶4. (U) The Turkish military is assisting with search-and-rescue 
teams and other logistical support and the central government is 
using state buildings for shelter and providing food.  In 
addition, many municipalities controlled by the Kurdish 
Democratic Society Party (DTP) have also established crisis 
centers to cope with the emergency. 
 
PM Erdogan: Callous or Misinformed? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) PM Erdogan has appeared disengaged from the crisis. 
The government has sent ministerial delegations and MPs to the 
region, but Erdogan did not speak publicly about the crisis 
until Saturday, when he commented on the media coverage, stating 
that "There are certain exaggerations, which sadden us.  You 
cannot stop such natural disasters even in the most developed 
countries of the world."  On November 7, Energy Minister Guler 
and three other ministers were dispatched to the region to meet 
with flood victims. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In conversations with Consulate Adana, civic leaders in 
the region have condemned the Prime Minister, saying that his 
attitude would probably be different if his own relatives and 
property had been affected.  One contact in Silopi, a town on 
the Iraqi border that lost 250 houses, characterized the PM's 
statement as "nonsense."  A contact in Diyarbakir said that, 
although nobody is taking to the streets to protest, there is 
deep anger about the PM's statement.  Others noted that, if the 
PM declared the region a disaster zone, the provinces would be 
granted additional resources to cope with the aftermath of the 
flood.  One DTP official told us that the central government was 
refusing to make the disaster declaration because it would make 
funds available to DTP-controlled municipalities.  Anatolian 
News Agency reported on November 7 that the opposition CHP 
introduced a bill declaring 13 SE cities disaster areas. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Shahismail Bedirhanoglu, President of GUNSIAD, a group 
representing businesses in the SE, said that the PM must have 
received inaccurate information to have made a statement so at 
odds with reality.  He said that a coalition of 30 NGOs in 
Diyarbakir is working to assess the damage and coordinate relief 
activities.  He said they estimate that 10,000 homes have been 
washed away and 80,000 people are now homeless.  A group of NGOs 
has also called on the GOT to declare the region a disaster zone. 
 
Comment 
---------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) While the GOT's actions in response to the emergency 
appear to be serious (particularly in light of the challenging 
conditions in the region), its public presentation has provided 
fuel to PM Erdogan's national opposition and angered locals who 
expected more from Ankara.  The PM's ill-advised comments and 
his reluctance to declare the region a disaster zone will

further erode trust between the GOT and Turkey's Kurds, many of 
whom believe that Ankara regards them as second-class citizens.
