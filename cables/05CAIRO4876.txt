SUBJECT: EGYPT:  PEACEKEEPERS HEAD TO SOUTHERN SUDAN 
 
 
¶1.  On June 21, President Mubarak reviewed Egyptian troops 
preparing for peacekeeping missions in south Sudan.  The 
President reminded the troops, and the public, that Sudan 
would constitute Egypt's sixth active peacekeeping mission 
under the UN umbrella.  Minister of Defense Tantawi 
highlighted Egypt's peacekeeping efforts as a declaration "to 
the world that peace is Egypt's strategic choice." 
 
¶2.  The initial contingent of 800 troops reportedly began 
deployment on June 25, with the UN coordinating 
transportation.  Egypt's forces in Sudan are to include a 
command group element, an infantry company, an engineering 
company, a demining company, a transportation platoon, and a 
field hospital.  Equipped with over 800 vehicles and supplies 
appropriate to its diverse mission, the Egyptian contingent 
may be augmented by more troops in July. 
 
¶3.  Egypt's presence in southern Sudan complements Egyptian 
military observers and a military medical facility in Darfur. 
 In addition to Egypt's political involvement in helping 
Sudan recover from years of conflict -- including recent 
efforts to broker an agreement between the GOS and the 
National Democratic Alliance (NDA) -- these practical 
contributions of manpower and expertise are indications of 
the great importance Egypt places on the stability of its 
neighbor to the south. 
 
¶4.  Khartoum minimize considered.
