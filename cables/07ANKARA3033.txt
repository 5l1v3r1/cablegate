In Today's Papers 
 
TGS Details Military Operations into Northern Iraq 
All papers report that Turkey's military General Staff (TGS) said 
Tuesday that between 150 and 175 PKK militants were killed in the 
first Turkish air assault on December 16, which targeted terrorists 
camps in northern Iraq.  TGS said "more than 200 targets were hit, 
including three command centers, two communications centers, two 
training camps, 182 living quarters, and 14 arms caches."  The TGS 
said many wounded PKK members went to hospitals in northern Iraqi 
cities after the air strikes.  The TGS emphasized that the targets 
were PKK installations and not civilians.  The military statement 
said it would continue attacks on the PKK targets in northern Iraq. 
 
 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that four Turkish F-16 
fighter jets bombed PKK targets in the Zap region of northern Iraq 
early Tuesday.  Colonel Hussein Tamar, a Peshmerge commander in the 
province of Dohuk, was quoted yesterday as saying that "Turkish 
warplanes bombed villages near the border with Turkey, but that no 
one was hurt because the area was evacuated earlier this month." 
 
At a party meeting on Monday, Prime Minister Erdogan emphasized that 
the military operations targeted the PKK and civilians were not 
harmed.  Erdogan noted that Turkey was exercising its right to 
defend itself "within the framework of international law." 
Opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal told his party that operations in 
northern Iraq should continue until the PKK is eliminated.  Baykal 
criticized the ruling AKP for planning an amnesty law, saying it was 
"too early."  The far right MHP leader Devlet Bahceli followed suit, 
saying the alleged government plan would mean "political amnesty" 
for the terror organization. 
 
Pro-Kurdish DTP to Form 'Human Chains' on Iraq Border 
Mainstream Sabah reports Turkey's main Kurdish party DTP will begin 
"civilian actions" that call for an end to Turkish military 
operations into northern Iraq.  The DTP will reportedly form "human 
chains" on the border with Iraq, and has invited both the families 
of the PKK victims and the families of security personnel killed by 
the PKK to join the demonstration.  Meanwhile, DTP MP Osman Ozcelik 
said his party was ready to support a recent proposal from Jalal 
Talabani, who said the PKK was ready to lay down its arms if a 
"comprehensive amnesty" was approved by the Turkish government. 
 
Meanwhile, DTP MP Fatma Kurtulan told liberal Radikal there were 
other politicians in the parliament like her who have relatives in 
the mountains.  Kurtulan caused a heated controversy when it was 
learned that her husband was a PKK fighter.  She claimed one of the 
AKP cabinet ministers had a cousin who died fighting for the PKK, 
and that another AKP lawmaker's brother had also died in a clash 
with the security forces.  "I am a product of the Kurdish problem," 
Kurtulan said, emphasizing her family was just one of the families 
devastated by the controversies over the Kurdish issue.  Kurtulan 
stressed that problems should be resolved in the parliament. 
 
Papers also report a prosecutor has demanded a three-year prison 
sentence for DTP deputy Aysel Tugluk for "making PKK propaganda" at 
a DTP convention in the southeastern city of Batman last year. 
 
 
President Gul to Meet President Bush Early January 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report President Abdullah Gul will pay an official visit to the 
United States from January 6-9 at the invitation of President Bush. 
At a meeting at the White House on January 8, the two leaders will 
discuss the ongoing cooperation against the PKK, Iraq, the Armenian 
genocide resolution in the US Congress, the presidential elections 
in Lebanon, Iran's nuclear program, and energy cooperation between 
Ankara and Washington, according to papers.

PKK Member Captured with A-4 Explosives in Istanbul 
All papers report Sahabettin Demir, a PKK terrorist who was 
preparing to carry out a bomb attack on Istanbul subway, was 
captured with 3.5 kg of A-4 explosives in Istanbul on Monday.  The 
police are pursuing a second suicide bomber who is allegedly 
preparing to launch an attack in the city.  Papers claim the 
bombers, trained in the PKK camps in the Kandil Mountains, were 
planning to carry out attacks in retaliation for Turkish air strikes 
in northern Iraq.  Mainstream Milliyet says the terrorist captured 
by the police in Istanbul is one of the 800 PKK bombers trained for 
attacks in Turkish cities. 
 
Meanwhile, papers report that since December 9, 47 cars have been 
set on fire in different cities around Turkey, with the majority of 
incidents occurring in Istanbul.  The Istanbul police have indicated 
that the arsonists might be Kurdish young men protesting the Turkish 
air attacks on northern Iraq.
