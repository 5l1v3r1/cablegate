SUBJECT: MINISTER OF WOMEN'S AFFAIRS ASKS FOR MORE SUPPORT 
TO WOMEN IN THE PROVINCES 
 
¶1. During a June 10 courtesy call on Minister of Women's 
Affairs Dr. Husn Bano Ghazanfar, the Ambassador reaffirmed 
the strong U.S. commitment to Afghan women.  Both President 
Obama and Secretary Clinton believe supporting Afghan women 
is essential to steering Afghanistan toward peace and 
economic development and away from terrorism, the Ambassador 
emphasized.  Ching Eikenberry accompanied and expressed her 
interest in collaborating with the Ministry to advance 
women's health, education, and political rights. 
¶2. Ghazanfar thanked the U.S. for supporting Afghan women. 
She highlighted the 20 U.S.-built provincial Department of 
Women's Affairs (DOWAs) as a particularly important 
contribution.  She urged the U.S. to build facilities for the 
14 remaining provinces.  DOWAs are not just offices, but are 
important spaces for women to meet, talk, learn, and 
commiserate together.  She also asked for increased 
assistance for the two million Afghan widows.  Finally, she 
asked for help implementing projects under the 10-year 
National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan (NAPWA). 
These projects are particularly important in the provinces, 
where women face many more difficulties than in Kabul. 
¶3. Ghazanfar also said President Obama's speech in Cairo gave 
her great hope.  She noted Obama mentioned Afghanistan not 
once but several times and warmly welcomed his attention.
