SUBJECT: MGIN01:  CANADA ON MUMBAI TERRORIST ATTACKS 
 
¶1.  (U)  Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon on 
November 28 confirmed that one Canadian had died and two 
others had been injured (one of whom remains in intensive 
care but is in stable condition) as a result of the terrorist 
attacks in Mumbai, while Canadian consular officials had been 
able to account for the safety of 17 other Canadians known to 
be in the "unsafe hotels."  On November 27, he had issued a 
statement confirming that he had spoken that morning with the 
Indian Foreign Minister and, "on behalf of the people of 
Canada, relayed my sincere condolences for those injured and 
killed in these barbaric attacks."  He confirmed that "Canada 
stands united with India to combat all forms of terrorism. 
These attacks have strengthened our resolve to work together 
for the mutual security and prosperity of our people.  Again, 
Canada strongly condemns these despicable acts of violence, 
which targeted innocent civilians."  On November 26, he had 
issued a statement in which he noted that "Canada strongly 
condemns the savage terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which have 
left hundreds of innocent civilians injured or killed.  These 
cowardly attacks are truly appalling."  He confirmed that 
"Canada stands firmly united with the Government of India in 
condemning these despicable acts of violence.  Canada and 
India share a commitment to freedom, democracy, human rights 
and the rule of law.  Among our mutual priorities is close 
cooperation to promote international security and to fight 
terrorism." 
 
¶2.  (U)  Separately, in the House of Commons' Question Period 
on November 27, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, in response to 
a question from Leader of the Official Opposition Stephane 
Dion, emphasized that "we join the entire world in expressing 
our outrage against this kind of unforgivable hatred, 
brutality and violence, and we will always stand with our 
friends in the democratic world against this."  He extended 
Canada's sympathies "to anyone from any country and their 
families who have been affected by loss of life or injury in 
this terrible tragedy."
