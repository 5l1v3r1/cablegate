SUBJECT: DELIVERING ON NATO'S PROMISE TO AFGHANISTAN - 
FINNISH RESPONSE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 186256 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Kimmo 
Lahdevirta, Director of the Finnish MFA's Office of 
Security Policy.  Lahdevirta expressed appreciation for US 
efforts to keep partners informed as the Riga NATO Summit 
approaches, and welcomed the fact that Afghanistan will 
feature prominently on the Summit agenda. 
 
¶2. (C) Lahdevirta noted that Finland's commitment to the 
NATO/ISAF mission in Afghanistan remains solid "through the 
end of 2008 and beyond."  Finland currently has about 105 
troops in five locations in Northern Afghanistan, with the 
bulk of them serving in the Swedish-led PRT at Mazar-al- 
Shariff and the Norwegian-led PRT at Meymenah.  The only 
change Finland is currently contemplating would be to 
increase its forces at those two locations by consolidating 
the small numbers of soldiers it currently has remaining in 
Kabul and two other locations.  No decision on such a move 
has yet been made, and it would be carefully coordinated 
with other ISAF partners. 
 
¶3. (C) Lahdevirta also commented on the issues of caveats 
and PRT leadership.  He noted that Finland has no formal or 
informal caveats, and expected no changes to this posture. 
As for PRT leadership, Lahdevirta said that Finland 
currently has no intention of taking over leadership of 
either of the PRTs in which it participates, mainly because 
both Sweden and Norway have renewed their commitments. 
However, Finland remains open to the idea of leading a PRT, 
perhaps in 2009.
