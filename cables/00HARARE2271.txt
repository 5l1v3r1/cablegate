¶1. SUMMARY: THIS CABLE PROVIDES A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN LAND REFORM IN 
ZIMBABWE, THE STATUS OF ZIMBABWE'S CURRENT SECOND PHASE OF ITS 
LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMME (LRRP II), USAID AND 
OTHER DONOR ASSISTANCE FOR LRRP II, AND THE STATUS OF THAT 
ASSISTANCE AS A RESULT OF THE PRESENT FARM OCCUPATION PROBLEM IN 
ZIMBABWE.  THIS IS AN UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENT AND MAY BE SHARED 
WITH THE U.S. CONGRESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ZIMBABWE'S LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM 
 
¶2. IN JUNE 1998, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) RELEASED A 
DRAFT "POLICY FRAMEWORK AND PROJECT DOCUMENT" FOR PHASE II OF 
THE LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMME (LRRP II) SETTING 
FORTH THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED POLICIES AND PLANS FOR PURSUING 
A SECOND MAJOR PHASE OF LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE.  (COMMENT: 
WHILE DEFINITIONS MAY VARY, THE FIRST 'PHASE' OF ZIMBABWE'S LAND 
REFORM PROGRAM PROCEEDED SPORADICALLY SINCE INDEPENDENCE, WITH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  01 OF 07  271033Z 
ONLY ABOUT 71,000 FAMILIES RESETTLED ON ABOUT 3.5 MILLION 
HECTARES (HA) OF LAND.  THIS CURRENT SECOND PHASE OF THE PROGRAM 
WAS LAUNCHED AT LEAST PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S 
FAILED ATTEMPT TO COMPULSORILY ACQUIRE 1,471 COMMERCIAL FARMS IN 
¶1997.  AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT'S INABILITY TO ADHERE TO THE 
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSED ACTION, THE NET 
RESULT OF THIS EFFORT, ASIDE FROM THE CONSIDERABLE ECONOMIC 
UNCERTAINTY THIS ACTION CAUSED, WAS THE IDENTIFICATION OF 118 
FARMS WHICH WERE UNCONTESTED BY THE OWNERS FOR PROGRAM 
ACQUISITION/USE (REF A).  END COMMENT.)  AS DESCRIBED IN THIS 
PROGRAM DOCUMENT, LRRP II IS AN AMBITIOUS FIVE-YEAR PLAN FOR THE 
RESETTLEMENT OF 91,000 FAMILIES (UP TO 550,000 PEOPLE, PLUS AN 
UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF SECONDARY 'SPIN OFF' BENEFICIARIES) ON 
FIVE MILLION HECTARES (HA) OF LAND IN THE COUNTRY'S LARGE-SCALE 
COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR, AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF US$ 1.9 
BILLION. 
 
INTERNATIONAL DONORS' CONFERENCE ON LAND REFORM 
 
¶3. THE GOZ CONVENED AN INTERNATIONAL DONORS CONFERENCE ON LAND 
REFORM IN ZIMBABWE ON SEPTEMBER 9-11, 1998 TO ADDRESS DONORS' 
EXPRESSED INTEREST AND CONCERNS REGARDING LRRP II (REF B).  THE 
CONFERENCE WAS ATTENDED BY SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL MAJOR 
INTERNATIONAL, MULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL DONORS TO ZIMBABWE, AS 
WELL AS KEY ZIMBABWEAN NON-GOVERNMENTAL, CIVIL SOCIETY, FARMERS' 
UNIONS AND PRIVATE SECTOR STAKEHOLDERS.  AT THE CONFERENCE, 
DONORS UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSED THE NEED FOR LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE 
FOR PURPOSES OF POVERTY ALLEVIATION (FOR THE POOR INDIGENOUS 
MAJORITY WITHIN THE COUNTRY'S CONGESTED COMMUNAL AREAS), AND 
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STABILITY.  THE DONORS' MAJOR RESERVATIONS 
REGARDING THE PROPOSED PROGRAM INCLUDED THE: (1) LACK OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  01 OF 07  271033Z 
CAPACITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A MASSIVE PROGRAM; 
AND (2) A STRONG NEED/DESIRE FOR A MORE OPEN, TRANSPARENT AND 
CONSULTATIVE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN ZIMBABWE (INCLUDING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF MORE BOTTOM-UP, PARTICIPATORY AND MARKET-ORIENTED 
APPROACHES TOWARDS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION, RATHER THAN SIMPLY 
RELYING ON THE MORE TOP-DOWN AND DIRECTIVE GOVERNMENT- 
ADMINISTERED APPROACHES OF LAND REFORM WHICH HAVE YIELDED POOR 
RESULTS IN ZIMBABWE AND ELSEWHERE). 
IN RESPONSE TO THESE 
CONCERNS, THROUGH A JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE END OF THE 
CONFERENCE, GOVERNMENT AND DONORS AGREED TO AN INITIAL 24-MONTH 
"INCEPTION PHASE" OF LRRP II TO BE PURSUED ACCORDING TO THE 
FOLLOWING MAJOR PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES: 
 
-IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT RESETTLEMENT BEGINNING WITH THE 118 
UNCONTESTED FARMS ON OFFER; 
 
-IMPLEMENT CURRENT GOZ RESETTLEMENT MODELS AND PROVIDE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR TESTING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES; 
 
-UNDERTAKE ONGOING MONITORING DURING THE INCEPTION PHASE WITH AN

EVALUATION AT THE END; 
 
-INTEGRATE THE LRRP II INTO THE NATIONAL MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICY 
AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION PLANS.  POLICY REFORMS WOULD INCLUDE THE 
INTRODUCTION OF AN AGRICULTURAL LAND TAX, STREAMLINING 
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS AND OPERATIONALIZING IMPROVED LAND 
TENURE ARRANGEMENTS; 
 
-UNDERTAKE CONSULTATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND LEARN FROM 
EXTERNAL EXPERIENCES; 
 
-PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS AND OWNERSHIP OF LAND BY MEN AND WOMEN AND 
INVOLVE WOMEN IN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION; 
 
-IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM IN A TRANSPARENT, FAIR AND SUSTAINABLE 
MANNER, WITH REGARD TO RESPECT FOR THE LAW, AND TO BROADENED 
STAKEHOLDER AND BENEFICIARY PARTICIPATION; AND 
 
-ORGANIZE AND MANAGE THE LRRP II IN WAYS THAT INCLUDE 
CONSULTATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS OF THE GOZ WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS, 
THE BENEFICIARIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY (INCLUDING THE NATIONAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

¶4. MARKET-BASED APPROACHES: AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE DONORS' LAND CONFERENCE WAS GOZ ACCEPTANCE 
TO ALLOW ALTERNATIVE RESETTLEMENT MODELS AND TO PROCEED WITH 
WORK ON LAND POLICY ISSUES THAT WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR LAND 
TENURE REFORM.  ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEED TO WORK ON POLICY ISSUES, 
SUCH AS LAND TAXATION, SUBDIVISION, FARM SIZE LIMITATIONS, LAND 
TENURE, ETC., THAT WOULD STIMULATE A LAND MARKET AND CREATE 
INCENTIVES FOR EFFICIENT LAND USE REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT 
POLICY BREAKTHROUGH FROM PAST GOZ POSITIONS ON THIS SUBJECT. 
DESPITE THE POLITICAL RHETORIC, GOZ TECHNICAL COUNTERPARTS 
UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT THESE CONCEPTS AND, IN FACT, PROGRESS IS 
BEING MADE ON THESE ISSUES. IN THIS REGARD, UNDER THE NEW LAND 
POLICY FRAMEWORK COMPLETED IN FALL 1999, A NEW PROGRESSIVE LAND 
TAX HAS BEEN APPROVED BY CABINET FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION, DRAFT 
REGULATIONS ON FARM SIZE LIMITATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, NEW 
REGULATIONS ON LAND SUBDIVISION ARE ACTIVELY BEING PURSUED AND 
LONGER-TERM PLANS FOR ADDRESSING WOMENS' AND MORE GENERAL LAND 
TENURE RIGHTS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.  COMMENT: AS DESCRIBED 
BELOW (SEE PARA 13.B.), USAID ASSISTANCE FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS 
BEEN DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT ON THESE KEY 
POLICY ISSUES.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶5. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, REPRESENTED BY AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, 
ISSUED A FORMAL STATEMENT AT THE CONFERENCE EXPRESSING OUR 
STRONG SUPPORT FOR "A LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT PROCESS THAT 
IS TRANSPARENT, FAIR AND DOES NOT HARM THE IMPORTANT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  02 OF 07  271033Z 
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY - IN ORDER TO CREATE THE 
ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE ECONOMIC 
GROWTH - AS A MATTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE."  IN ADDITION, WHILE 
ACKNOWLEDGING OUR FUNDING LIMITATIONS (AT THE TIME, THE USAID 
MISSION TO ZIMBABWE WAS STILL SCHEDULED TO CLOSEOUT IN FY2003) 
AND THE USG'S INABILITY TO FINANCE COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION, 
THE STATEMENT PLEDGED OUR DESIRE TO "REMAIN A REAL PLAYER IN 
ZIMBABWE'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM" THROUGH THE PROVISION OF 
UNSPECIFIED "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN WAYS THAT THE COGNIZANT 
AUTHORITIES DEEM USEFUL."  COMMENT:  IN ADDITION TO FUNDING AND 
MANAGEMENT CONSTRAINTS, POSSIBLE USG ASSISTANCE FOR THIS PROGRAM 
WAS LIMITED TO 'TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE' AS A MORE CAUTIOUS INITIAL 
APPROACH TOWARD PROGRAM INVOLVEMENT.  WE CONSIDERED THIS 
APPROACH PRUDENT AT THAT TIME, IN VIEW OF THE CONSIDERABLE 
POLITICAL RHETORIC ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBJECT OF LAND REFORM IN 
ZIMBABWE.  WE ALSO BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT 
TIME TO OBSERVE AND LEARN FROM THE PROGRESS AND RESULTS OF THE 
PILOT INCEPTION PHASE BEFORE MAKING ANY MORE SUBSTANTIVE U.S. 
FUNDING COMMITMENTS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USG POSITION DID 
NOT PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL U.S. 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR LRRP II SHOULD THE INCEPTION PHASE PROVE

INCEPTION PHASE 
 
¶6. ON NOVEMBER 1, 1999, THE GOZ ISSUED THE PILOT "INCEPTION 
PHASE FRAMEWORK PLAN -1999-2000" DOCUMENT, CALLING FOR THE 
RESETTLEMENT OF 33,800 FARM FAMILIES (PLUS SOME 85,000 NON-FARM 
FAMILY SECONDARY 'SPIN OFF' BENEFICIARIES) OVER AN INITIAL 24- 
MONTH PERIOD ON ONE MILLION HA OF LAND.   THIS INCEPTION PHASE 
DOCUMENT DULY INCORPORATED ALL OF THE AGREEMENTS REACHED AT THE 
DONORS' LAND CONFERENCE, INCLUDING A FAIR, JUST, TRANSPARENT AND 
HIGHLY CONSULTATIVE PROCESS; ALTERNATIVE AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT- 
ADMINISTERED APPROACHES; AND WOMENS' LAND RIGHTS AND 
PARTICIPATION; ETC.).  ACCORDINGLY, IT RECEIVED WIDESPREAD 
SUPPORT FROM ALL KEY LRRP II STAKEHOLDERS (INCLUDING ALL THREE 
OF THE FARMERS' UNIONS - CFU, ICFU, ZFU). 
 
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
 
¶7. DUE TO ITS PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE, LRRP II HAS A WIDE VARIETY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  03 OF 07  271033Z 
OF STAKEHOLDERS LOCATED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL 
STRUCTURES.  ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE, THE KEY INSTITUTIONAL 
STRUCTURE IS THE CABINET COMMITTEE ON RURAL RESETTLEMENT AND 
DEVELOPMENT (CRD), CHAIRED BY VICE-PRESIDENT JOSEPH MSIKA, AND 
CONSISTING OF THE MINISTERS OF LANDS AND AGRICULTURE; LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT AND NATIONAL HOUSING; RURAL RESOURCES AND WATER 
DEVELOPMENT; NATIONAL AFFAIRS, EMPLOYMENT CREATION AND 
COOPERATIVES; FINANCE; MINES, ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM; TRANSPORT 
AND ENERGY; AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC PLANNING COMMISSION.  THIS 
CABINET-LEVEL, DECISION-MAKING GROUP IS SUPPORTED BY A 'WORKING 
PARTY' OF THE CRD, COMPOSED OF PERMANENT SECRETARIES OF THE 
ABOVE MINISTRIES, WHICH IN TURN IS SUPPORTED BY THE INTER- 
MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON RURAL RESETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT 
(IMCRD), COMPOSED OF HEADS OF PARTICIPATING GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS. 
 
¶8. THE KEY STRUCTURE FOR NON-GOVERNMENTAL INPUT INTO THE LAND 
REFORM PROCESS IS THE LAND REFORM, RURAL RESETTLEMENT AND 
DEVELOPMENT TASK FORCE (LAND TASK FORCE) OF THE NATIONAL 
ECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE FORUM (NECF).  THE NECF LAND TASK FORCE IS 
COMPOSED OF SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KEY NON- 
GOVERNMENTAL/CIVIL SOCIETY STAKEHOLDERS IN LAND REFORM IN 
ZIMBABWE, INCLUDING ALL MAJOR FARMERS' AND FARM WORKERS' UNIONS, 
WOMENS' GROUPS, UNIVERSITY/ACEDEMIC INTERESTS, AND OTHER 
CONCERNED PRIVATE/NON-GOVERNMENTAL INTERESTS.  GOVERNMENT IS 
ALSO REPRESENTED ON THE NECF LAND TASK FORCE AT THE WORKING 
PARTY (PERMANENT SECRETARY) LEVEL OF THE CRD NOTED ABOVE. 
 
¶9. DONOR AGENCIES "ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN SUPPORTING LRRP II" ARE 
REPRESENTED THROUGH A JOINT CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE OF GOVERNMENT 
AND DONORS ON LAND REFORM ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE UNITED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

NATION'S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP). 
 
¶10. FINALLY, A NEW TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNIT (TSU) IS NOW ALMOST 
FULLY ESTABLISHED, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT OF 
LRRP II, WHICH WILL INTERACT WITH ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONAL 
STAKEHOLDERS AT THE WORKING LEVEL TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE 
PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION, COORDINATION AND MONITORING OF PROGRAM 
ACTIVITIES.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM MANDATE, 
ALL AGREED THAT THE TSU MERITED PRIORITY DONOR SUPPORT. 
 
¶11. ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS MEET 
PERIODICALLY, AS REQUIRED, TO DISCUSS LRRP II POLICY, PLANS, 
PROGRESS, ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROGRAM 
POLICY AND/OR IMPLEMENTATION CAN, AND DO FLOW IN ALMOST ANY 
DIRECTION AMONG THESE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS, WITH FINAL DECISIONS 
REFERRED TO THE CRD (AND EVENTUALLY TO PARLIAMENT FOR THOSE 
ACTIONS REQUIRING LEGISLATION).  ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME, 
WHEN GIVEN THE CHANCE, THESE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS HAVE 
FUNCTIONED REASONABLY WELL IN THE PAST.  THE MAJOR PROBLEMS HAVE 
OCCURRED WHEN GOVERNMENT IGNORES THIS ESTABLISHED STRUCTURE, 
GENERALLY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES AS IN THE CURRENT FARM

U.S. ASSISTANCE FOR LRRP II 
 
¶12. IN AGREEMENT WITH ITS CONFERENCE PLEDGE, THE USG, THROUGH 
USAID, HAS SIGNED TWO AGREEMENTS FOR SUPPORT TO LRRP II IN KEY 
AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE WE CAN EXERT A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE 
INFLUENCE ON THE COURSE OF GREATER PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. 
THESE AREAS INCLUDE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION, AND 
LAND POLICY FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.  BOTH OF THESE 
ACTIVITIES ARE DESCRIBED BRIEFLY BELOW: 
 
¶A. THE FIRST OF THESE TWO ACTIVITIES IS UNDP PROJECT NO. 
ZIM/98/008 FOR SUPPORT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND INITIAL 
OPERATIONS OF THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNIT (TSU - NOTED ABOVE) - 
THE KEY MANAGEMENT ENTITY FOR LRRP II IMPLEMENTATION. (NOTE: THE 
USG FUNDS ONE QUARTER OF THE TOTAL US$ 920,000 COST OF THIS 
MULTI-DONOR PROJECT.  TOTAL ACTIVITY COSTS ARE FUNDED THROUGH 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF US$ 230,000 FROM EACH OF FOUR DONORS - SWEDEN, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  04 OF 07  271034Z 
THE NETHERLANDS, NORWAY AND THE U.S.).  SINCE THIS PROJECT'S 
INCEPTION, SEVERAL OTHER DONORS, INCLUDING THE WORLD BANK AND 
FRANCE, HAVE ALSO AGREED TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE TO 
THE UNIT OUTSIDE OF THIS UNDP AGREEMENT IN RECOGNITION OF ITS 
KEY ROLE IN SUCCESSFUL LRRP II IMPLEMENTATION.  END NOTE.)  THE 
UNDP PROJECT PROVIDES FOR TSU STAFFING AND OPERATIONAL SUPPORT, 
AND ASSOCIATED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING FOR LRRP II 
POLICY ANALYSIS AND IMPLEMENTATION; PROGRAM PLANNING, PROCEDURAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION; PROGRAM COORDINATION, 
INFORMATION DISSEMINATION AND PUBLIC RELATIONS; AND PROGRAM 
MONITORING AND EVALUATION.  THIS MULTI-DONOR PROJECT IS 
ADMINISTERED BY THE UNDP THROUGH ITS UMBRELLA 'BILATERAL' 
AGREEMENT WITH THE GOZ, WITH INDIVIDUAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN EACH 
OF THE FOUR PARTICIPATING DONORS AND UNDP.  THE UMBRELLA 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOZ AND UNDP WAS SIGNED ON MAY 19, 1999; 
THE USAID-UNDP AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED ON AUGUST 2, 1999.  THE 
PROJECT COMPLETION DATE IS MAY 31, 2001, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
INCEPTION PHASE'S TWO-YEAR TIMEFRAME. 
 
¶B. THE OTHER USAID ACTIVITY - THE LAND POLICY REFORM 
PROJECT (NO. 613-0249) - CONSISTS OF A US$ 1.5 MILLION 
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN USAID AND THE UNIVERSITY OF 
WISCONSIN (MADISON)'S LAND TENURE CENTER (LTC) TO PROVIDE 
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING, CAPACITY BUILDING AND 
RESEARCH IN SUPPORT OF LRRP II POLICY ANALYSIS AND 
IMPLEMENTATION, AND PROGRAM MONITORING AND EVALUATION.  THE 
GOZ SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN THIS AREA IN 
RECOGNITION OF LTC'S PRE-EMINENT EXPERIENCE IN LAND REFORM 
FOLLOWING OVER 30 YEARS OF WORK IN THIS AREA THROUGHOUT THE 
WORLD.  IN AGREEMENT WITH ITS CAPACITY-BUILDING OBJECTIVES, 
THIS ACTIVITY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED WITH MAXIMUM ZIMBABWEAN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  04 OF 07  271034Z 
PARTICIPATION THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENT WITH THE 
UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE'S CENTER FOR APPLIED SOCIAL SCIENCES 
(CASS).  THE AGREEMENT WITH LTC WAS SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER 29, 
1999, INCLUDING PROVISION OF THE INITIAL US$ 800,000 
TRANCHE OF FUNDS.  THE SECOND TRANCHE OF INCREMENTAL 
FUNDING OF US$ 700,000 IS PLANNED FOR FY2000, THEREBY FULLY 
FUNDING THE $ 1.5 MILLION LTC AGREEMENT.  THE ACTIVITY 
COMPLETION DATE IS SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. 
 
¶13. ACKNOWLEDGING THE HIGH POLITICAL STAKES AND SENSITIVITY 
SURROUNDING LRRP II, THE AGREEMENTS FOR BOTH OF THESE ACTIVITIES 
PROVIDE "ESCAPE" CLAUSES, WHERE CONTINUING PROJECT ASSISTANCE 
CAN BE REVIEWED, SUSPENDED OR EVEN TERMINATED SHOULD THE PROGRAM 
NOT PROCEED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMUNIQUE AGREEMENTS REACHED 
AT THE DONORS' LAND CONFERENCE (SEE PARA 3. ABOVE).  HOWEVER, 
BEFORE ANY UNILATERAL ACTION IS TAKEN, THE UNDP PROJECT 
AGREEMENT CALLS FOR A TRI-PARTITE MEETING BETWEEN THE GOZ, 
DONORS AND UNDP TO "IDENTIFY THE BEST WAY FORWARD - SHOULD ONE 
OF THESE FACTORS CEASE TO PERSEVERE."  THE LTC COOPERATIVE 
AGREEMENT INCLUDES NO SUCH MEETING REQUIREMENT, AND ACTION CAN 
BE TAKEN UNDER THIS LATTER AGREEMENT AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE.

¶14. IN ADDITION TO THOSE COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTING TO THE ABOVE 
UNDP/TSU PROJECT, THE WORLD BANK AND THE FRANCE ARE THE ONLY 
OTHER COUNTRIES CURRENTLY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE TO 
LRRP II.  ALTHOUGH NOT YET FULLY OPERATIONAL, THE WORLD BANK 
(WB) HAS SIGNED A US$ 5 MILLION 'LEARNING AND INNOVATION' LOAN 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT INCEPTION PHASE IMPLEMENTATION, 
WHICH INCLUDES ADDITIONAL STAFFING SUPPORT FOR THE TSU AS WELL 
AS SIGNIFICANT FUNDS FOR ALTERNATIVE RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES 
(BUT NOT FOR LAND ACQUISITION COSTS).  THE BANK HAS ALSO 
INDICATED ITS WILLINGNESS TO USE FUNDS FROM ITS EXISTING US$ 60 
MILLION COMMUNITY ACTION PROJECT (CAP) FOR LRRP II RESETTLEMENT 
PURPOSES.  FRANCE IS ALSO PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE TSU IN THE 
FORM OF LONG-TERM TECHNICAL ADVISORY SERVICES FOR PROGRAM 
PLANNING, AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION, AS WELL AS A SMALL 
AMOUNT OF FUNDS FOR RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES IN MASHONALAND 
PROVINCE.

INTENTION TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LRRP II, AND 
BOTH HAVE PREPARED PRELIMINARY PROJECT PROPOSALS FOR THIS 
PURPOSE.  SIGNIFICANTLY, BRITAIN WAS THE ONLY DONOR CONSIDERING 
FUNDING LAND ACQUISITION COSTS.  HOWEVER, WITH THE RECENT 
TURBULENT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS - EXACERBATED GREATLY BY THE NEW 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OBLIGING BRITAIN, AS THE FORMER 
COLONIAL RULER, TO PAY FOR LAND ACQUISITION COSTS AND THE RECENT 
FARM INVASIONS - BOTH OF THESE DONORS' PLANS FOR LRRP II SUPPORT 
HAVE NOW BEEN PUT ON HOLD, PENDING THE OUTCOME OF IN-COUNTRY 
DEVELOPMENTS AND DIALOGUE ON THIS SUBJECT. 
 
PROGRESS TO DATE 
 
¶16. AS A RESULT OF BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS, PROGRESS 
IN IMPLEMENTING BOTH OF THE USAID-ASSISTED ACTIVITIES, AS WELL 
AS ALL OTHER DONOR SUPPORT FOR LRRP II, HAS BEEN SLOW TO DATE. 
MAJOR INTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE DELAYS IN RECRUITING KEY STAFF 
(FOR THE UNDP/TSU ACTIVITY) AND MEETING PROGRAM CONDITIONALITY 
REQUIREMENTS (FOR THE WORLD BANK LOAN).  MAJOR EXTERNAL PROBLEMS 
HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY PERIODIC GOZ RHETORIC AND/OR ACTIONS RELATED 
TO THE LRRP II, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT AND HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE LAND 
ALLOCATIONS TO FAVORED BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE COMMERCIAL 
RESETTLEMENT SCHEME, AND PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS 
PROVIDING FOR LAND ACQUISITION WITHOUT DUE COMPENSATION.  AS A 
RESULT, FEW DONOR FUNDS HAVE BEEN DISBURSED TO DATE FOR LAND 
ACQUISITION OR ACTUAL RESETTLEMENT PURPOSES, DESPITE SIGNIFICANT 
PRIOR COMMITMENTS (NOTABLY AT THE DONOR CONFERENCE DISCUSSED 
ABOVE) TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THESE MORE TANGIBLE 
ASPECTS OF LRRP II. 
 
¶17. AS A RESULT OF THESE DELAYS, PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  05 OF 07  271034Z 
MEETING INCEPTION PHASE TARGETS, WITH ONLY 59 FARMS (ABOUT 
90,000 HA) ACQUIRED WITH NOW-EXHAUSTED GOZ FUNDS AND 1,700 
FAMILIES SETTLED (WITHOUT ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE) TO DATE. 
THIS PROGRESS CONTRASTS WITH A FIRST YEAR TARGET FOR THE 
INCEPTION PHASE OF ACQUIRING 250,000 HA. OF LAND, OR ABOUT 150 
FARMS.  SINCE DONOR FUNDING IS FOCUSED LARGELY ON ALTERNATIVE 
MODELS FOR LAND REFORM AND RESETTLEMENT, AND FEW DONOR FUNDS 
HAVE BEEN DISBBURSED, THE BULK OF THE RESETTLEMENT UNDERTAKEN TO 
DATE HAS BEEN ACCORDING TO THE MORE REGRESSIVE AND TOP-DOWN 
GOVERNMENT-ADMINISTERED APPROACHES TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 
NOTED ABOVE.  THEREFORE, LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN 
TESTING AND PROMOTING THE MORE DESIRABLE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES 
FOR THIS CRITICAL AREA OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. 
 
¶18. AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED, THIS SITUATION HAS CAUSED INCREASING 
FRUSTRATION AMONG KEY GOZ DECISION-MAKERS AND COUNTERPARTS, 
ESPECIALLY AS PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS DRAW NEAR.  DESPITE ALL OF 
THE RHETORIC ON THIS SUBJECT, HOWEVER, ALL FARMS ACQUIRED UNDER 
THE PROGRAM TO DATE HAVE BEEN THROUGH CASH PAYMENT UP FRONT OF 
FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR THE LAND AND IMPROVEMENTS.  AS OF MARCH 
2000, APPROXIMATELY Z$ 200 MILLION, OR US$ 5 MILLION OF GOZ

FUNDS HAD BEEN SPENT TO PURCHASE 59 FARMS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 
90,000 HA. THE GOZ HAS ALSO RELEASED 45 ADDITIONAL FARMS 
(APPROXIMATELY 125,000 HA), ACQUIRED PREVIOUSLY THROUGH A 
VARIETY OF MEANS, FOR LRRP II PURPOSES. 
 
CURRENT STATUS 
 
¶19. AS REPORTED IN REF (C), UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE 
(RESREP) CARLOS LOPES CHAIRED A MEETING ON MARCH 14 OF ALL 
DONORS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN THE UNDP/TSU PROJECT TO DISCUSS AN 
APPROPRIATE PROJECT AND DONOR RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT FARM 
INVASIONS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT ZIMBABWE'S LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL 
FARMING AREAS (REFS D AND E).  AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT'S LACK 
OF ANY EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THIS SITUATION, ALL DONORS INVOLVED 
ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESSFUL 
PROJECT (AND GREATER LRRP II) IMPLEMENTATION.  AS A RESULT, ALL 
PRESENT AT THE MEETING, INCLUDING AMBASSADOR MCDONALD, 
UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED THAT UNDP WOULD DRAFT A LETTER TO THE GOZ 
INDICATING OUR JOINT CONCERN REGARDING THIS SITUATION, OUR 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE ACTIONS (AND/OR LACK THEREOF) 
CONSTITUTED A BREACH OF THE AGREED UPON COMMUNIQUE AGREEMENTS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02271  06 OF 07  271034Z 
(ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE 'RULE OF LAW'), AND OUR JOINT DECISION 
TO FREEZE PROJECT FUNDS, WITH NO NEW MAJOR PROJECT COMMITMENTS, 
UNTIL THIS SERIOUS LAND INVASION SITUATION IS DISCUSSED AND 
SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED.  THE LETTER ALSO REQUESTS A TRI-PARTITE 
MEETING, AS CALLED FOR IN THE PROJECT AGREEMENT, TO DISCUSS THIS 
DECISION AND SITUATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND IDENTIFY A WAY 
FORWARD.  THE TWO-WEEK DEADLINE INCLUDED IN THIS LETTER EXPIRED 
ON APRIL 11, WITH NO RESPONSE RECEIVED TO DATE FROM THE GOZ. 
 
¶20. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS DECISION, USAID SUBSEQUENTLY ALSO 
NOTIFIED LTC, BOTH VERBALLY AND IN WRITING, OF OUR DECISION TO 
EFFECT A SIMILAR FREEZE OR SUSPENSION OF ASSISTANCE UNDER THE 
LTC COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT UNTIL THIS SITUATION IS PROPERLY 
ADDRESSED.  LTC HAS CONSENTED TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST UNTIL 
SUCH TIME AS THEY ARE NOTIFIED OTHERWISE.  THE INTENT OF THESE 
ACTIONS IS TO SEND A STRONG JOINT SIGNAL TO GOVERNMENT OF THE 
DONORS' SERIOUS CONCERN REGARDING THIS SITUATION, WITHOUT AT 
THIS TIME EFFECTING ANY ACTIONS WHICH WOULD SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE 
OUR ABILITIES TO CONTINUE OUR LONGER-TERM SUPPORT FOR LRRP II, 
IF/WHEN THIS SITUATION IS PROPERLY RECTIFIED.  THIS IS THE 
PROGRAM'S CURRENT STATUS.  THE MISSION WILL INFORM OF ANY NEW 
DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY OCCUR. 
 
¶21. COMMENT: ALTHOUGH PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW TO DATE, WE BELIEVE 
THE INCEPTION PHASE, AS AGREED TO IN THE JOINT DONORS' LAND 
CONFERENCE COMMUNIQUE (SEE PARA 3.), REMAINS NOT ONLY RELEVANT, 
BUT ALSO CRITICAL FOR LONG-TERM LRRP II SUCCESS.  BY TESTING 
ALTERNATIVE POLICIES AND APPROACHES TO LAND REFORM AND 
RESETTLEMENT IN ZIMBABWE, IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO EXERT 
SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE COURSE OF GREATER LRRP II 
IMPLEMENTATION.  GIVEN THE MASSIVE SCALE OF THIS PROGRAM AND ITS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  02271  06 OF 07  271034Z 
POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR ZIMBABWE'S FUTURE 
PROSPERITY THAT THIS PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY.  FOR THIS 
REASON (AND CONSIDERING GOVERNMENT'S PAST FAILED EFFORTS IN THIS 
AREA), MISSION FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE ORIGINAL PILOT RATIONALE 
FOR THE INCEPTION PHASE REMAINS VALID AT THIS TIME. 
 
¶22. DESPITE THE START-UP PROBLEMS AND DELAYS EXPERIENCED IN 
INCEPTION PHASE IMPLEMENTATION TO DATE, FOR ANYONE TO DECLARE 
FAILURE AT THIS TIME IS PREMATURE.  MOST OF THE KEY DONOR 
ASSISTANCE FOR INCEPTION PHASE IMPLEMENTATION WAS ALMOST IN 
PLACE (INCLUDING THE CRITICAL MISSING LAND ACQUISITION 
INGREDIENT WHICH WAS IN FINAL PREPARATION BY BRITAIN) WHEN THE 
CURRENT FARM INVASION CRISIS BEGAN.  IN ADDITION, KEY TECHNICAL 
ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL COUNTERPARTS KNOW 
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM EXECUTION AND, IF 
GIVEN THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH DONORS, WOULD PROBABLY DO IT WELL. 
FINALLY, DESPITE THE CURRENT NEGATIVE DIALOGUE ON THIS SUBJECT, 
MOST DONORS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM'S FUNDAMENTAL NEED 
AND RATIONALE.  HENCE, WITH A SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION OF THE 
CURRENT INVASION CRISIS AND SUCCESSFUL ENSUING INCEPTION PHASE

RESULTS, THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SUBSTANTIAL 
ADDITIONAL DONOR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE FORTHCOMING 
IN THE FUTURE (INCLUDING FOR LAND ACQUISITION PURPOSES). 
 
¶23. THE MISSION CONTINUES TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE PRIMARY 
IMPETUS FOR THE CURRENT FARM CRISIS IS POLITICS, NOT LAND. 
THEREFORE, WHEN THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS ARE COMPLETED, MOST 
DONORS REMAIN HOPEFUL THAT THE SITUATION WILL RETURN TO SOME 
SEMBLANCE OF NORMALITY.  AT THAT TIME, THE INCEPTION PHASE WILL 
BE AS NECESSARY (IF NOT MORE SO) THAN IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN, IN 
ORDER TO LAY THE PROPER GROUNDWORK FOR A TRULY SUSTAINABLE 
SOLUTION TO THIS MOST DIFFICULT PERENNIAL NATIONAL ISSUE.  END
