REF: STATE 158768 
 
(SBU) Post provides the following responses, keyed to 
questions in paragraph 5 of reftel: 
 
--1) Finland-based multinationals such as Wartsila and Nokia 
have investments and sell products and services in Cuba. 
However, we have no information to suggest that these 
businesses have trafficked or that they have any intention to 
traffic in confiscated Cuban properties. 
 
--2) Finland has no significant bilateral trade agreements 
with Cuba. 
 
--3) There are no significant government-funded student 
exchanges between Cuba and Finland and no Cuban-paid medical 
travel for Finnish nationals that post is aware of.  If any 
Cuban medical personnel work in Finland, they are here as a 
result of economic or family-based immigration, not/not as 
part of a Cuban or Finnish Government-sponsored program. 
 
--4) Finland has no Embassy in Cuba, no bilateral aid 
projects, and very little contact with Cuban officials.  It 
has worked to promote democracy in Cuba by supporting common 
EU positions. 
 
--5) There have been no high-level visits in the past six 
months.
