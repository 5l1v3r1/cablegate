SUBJECT: OSCE GUIDANCE: DRAFT DECISION ON THE AGENDA, 
TIMETABLE AND MODALITIES OF THE 2008 OSCE-AFGHANISTAN 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF: USOSCE 190 
 
¶1. The Department has reviewed the text of draft decision 
PC.DD/26/08 (reftel), which decides the agenda and modalities 
of the November 9-10 OSCE Asia Partners Conference, to be 
held in Kabul. 
 
¶2. Post should seek the following ammendments to the text: 
 
a) in the third bullet of the session 3 agenda, on the issue 
of trafficking, for the sake of clarity about the scope of 
discussion, Post should attempt to obtain consensus on 
inserting the modifier "cross-border" in front of the word 
"traficking" so that bullet reads, in its entirety: 
"Fighting corruption and illegal activities, including all 
forms of cross-border trafficking". 
 
b) in the first bullet of the session 1 agenda, Post should 
seek deletion of the bracketed text so that the bullet reads, 
in its entirety: "Promoting institution-building, election 
capacity-building, human rights and democratization, as 
components for security and stability;". 
 
¶3. While obtaining these changes is desirable, it is not 
crucial, and Post is therefore authorized to join consensus 
on the text of the agenda without the amendment should other 
participating States object.
