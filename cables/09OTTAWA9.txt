REF: SECSTATE 499 
 
(sbu) Drawing on reftel, EMIN told Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Assistant Deputy 
Minister for Trade Policy and Negotiation Don Stephenson that 
the USG -- in principle -- supports the candidacy of Canadian 
official Meg Kinnear to be the next Secretary General of the 
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes 
(ICSID).  Highlighting the benefits of joining the ICSID, 
EMIN said Kinnear's candidacy might be stronger if Canada 
took further action to become an ICSID party.  Stephenson 
stated that he was well aware of the ICSID and that Canada 
wanted to join the organization.  Stephenson said he would 
look into the status of Canada's efforts and get back to the 
Embassy.  Stephenson was also highly complimentary of 
Kinnear, expressing his personal regret that she might soon 
leave Canada's Trade Law Bureau.
