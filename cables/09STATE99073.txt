SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT: GERMANY 
 
¶1.  The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens that Al 
Qaeda has threatened it will conduct terrorist attacks in 
Germany immediately prior to and following the federal 
elections on September 27.  This Travel Alert expires on 
November 11, 2009. 
 
¶2.  Al Qaeda recently released a video specifically 
warning Germany of attacks.  German authorities are 
taking the threat seriously and have taken measures to 
enhance the level of security throughout the country. 
 
¶3.  The Department of State urges U.S. citizens to 
maintain good security practices at all times, and to 
maintain a heightened situational awareness and a low 
profile.  Americans are advised to monitor local news 
reports and consider the level of security present when 
visiting public places or choosing hotels, restaurants, 
and entertainment and recreation venues. 
 
¶4.  We encourage U.S. citizens to read the Department of 
State's current Worldwide Caution.  It provides 
additional information on potential threats to U.S. 
citizens overseas, along with advice on how to reduce 
your vulnerability to such threats.  Additional general 
information on residing and traveling abroad, including 
the latest Country Specific Information for Germany, may 
be found on the Bureau of Consular Affairs website. 
 
¶5.  Contact information for the U.S. Embassy in Berlin 
and U.S. Consulates in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Dusseldorf, 
Munich, and Leipzig may be found on the U.S. Diplomatic 
Mission to Germany's website.  All U.S. citizens 
traveling to or living in Germany are urged to register 
with the U.S. Embassy through the State Department's 
travel registration website. 
 
¶6.  Travelers may also obtain up-to-date information on 
security conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free 
in the United States or outside the United States and 
Canada on a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444. 
 
¶7.  Minimize considered.
