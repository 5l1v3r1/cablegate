¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Ec Chief raised reftel talking points with MFA 
Secretary of State Kao Kim Hourn January 16, noting 
especially that ASEAN and Cambodia would burnish their 
credentials in the international community by continuing with 
the Tripartite Core Group's (TCG) notable humanitarian work. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Kao Kim Hourn appreciated that the TCG served to 
bolster ASEAN's profile as a regional organization and could 
enhance its reputation.  He also took note of the USG's 
interest in seeing the TCG extend its mandate for another 
year beyond July 2009.  However, he said that he was under 
instructions not to support extension at this time.  The 
Royal Government of Cambodia wants to wait for the full 
report on the work of the TCG first, and then after review of 
that report, it would take a decision about extending.  He 
nonetheless undertook to report the USG interest in taking a 
decision now to extend the TCG mandate.
