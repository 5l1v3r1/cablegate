SUBJECT: CUSTOMS AND PORTS DIRECTORATE REITERATES REQUEST 
FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: 06 MANAMA 1700 
 
¶1. This is an action message.  Please see paragraph four. 
 
¶2. The Embassy received a letter from President of Customs, 
Ports and Free Zones Shaikh Daij bin Salman Al Khalifa, in 
which he requested specific technical assistance training. 
As he mentions, his letter follows verbal discussions 
(reftel) and a previous letter, dated September 25, 2006. 
(Note:  Post faxed and pouched subject letter and previous 
letter to NEA/ARP.  End Note.) 
 
¶3. We recognize that U.S. and Bahraini customs officials are 
currently negotiating the text of a Customs Mutual Assistance 
Agreement that could be signed during the mid-April visit of 
Shaikh Daij and Finance Minister Shaikh Ahmed bin Mohammed Al 
Khalifa to Washington.  Shaikh Daij's request for training 
could serve as input for an action plan under the agreement. 
 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Please provide cleared language for a 
formal response to Shaikh Daij. 
 
¶5. Begin text of letter: 
 
 
25th February 2007 
 
 
H.E. Mr. William Monroe 
Ambassador of the United States of America 
Embassy of the United States of America 
Kingdom of Bahrain 
 
 
Your Excellency 
 
Re. Training Requirements of the Directorate General of 
Customs 
 
 
May I refer to my recent meeting, in Your Excellency's 
presence, with the U.S. Department of Commerce Deputy 
Secretary, Dr. David Sampson, at which the possibility of 
 
SIPDIS 
U.S. Customs providing training to Bahraini Customs officials 
on various customs processes and procedures and on security 
issues was discussed. As you will appreciate, this was one of 
the requests the Bahraini side made at the conclusion stages 
of the US-Bahrain FTA. I also feel that such assistance will 
be in this spirit of the FTA, Chapter 5 (Customs 
Administration), Art. 7, which states "The United States 
shall endeavour to provide Bahrain with technical advice and 
assistance for the purpose of improving risk assessment 
techniques, simplifying and expediting customs procedures, 
advancing technical skills, and enhancing the use of 
technologies that can lead to improved compliance with laws 
and regulations governing importation." 
 
¶1.    Capacity building in customs matter 
¶2.    Train the Trainer Courses 
¶3.    Train Customs Officers in drug and weapon (explosive) 
identification, investigation and evidence gathering, 
information handling, questioning techniques and covert 
operations 
¶4.    Rules of Origin 
¶5.    X-Ray and other inspection techniques 
¶6.    Risk Assessment selectivity and profiling, concealment 
methods, intrusive and non-intrusive passenger baggage and 
freight control 
¶7.    Intellectual Property Rights 
¶8.    Money Laundering 
¶9.    Customs Valuation 
¶10.   Harmonizing systems 
¶11.   Managerial courses for senior and middle management 
¶12.   Auditing 
¶13.   Automation of various Customs Procedures 
 
 
I feel that Bahraini Customs staff will enormously benefit 
from such training which will also significantly enhance the 
level of co-operation between the U.S. and Bahrain Customs. 
 
I would be grateful for Your Excellency's assistance in this 
regard and look forward to hearing from you. 
 
 
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration at all times. 
 
With warm regards, 
 
 
Daij Bin Salman Al Khalifa 
President Customs, Ports & Free Zones 
 
 
End text.
