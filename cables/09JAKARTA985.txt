¶1.  Summary: The 8th Meeting of the Asia Forest Partnership (AFP) 
and AFP Dialogue underscored the value of its open membership and 
the informality of its discussions on sometimes-sensitive topics 
related to deforestation and forest degradation.  AFP members and 
other participants at the May 27-29 meeting in Bali engaged in 
vigorous debate and the frank sharing of views on REDD and combating 
illegal logging.  Indonesia's Ministry of Forestry (MOF) was a 
co-sponsor and active participant.  Members hoped for broader USG 
participation in the future, noting that USG agencies have played a 
vital and pioneering role in anti-illegal logging efforts throughout 
the region.  End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
¶2.  The AFP is a voluntary, multi-stakeholder, partnership that 
promotes sustainable forest management in the Asia-Pacific region. 
It was launched in 2002 at the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development and aims to promote cooperation among governments, civil 
society groups and the private sector in order to cope with high 
rates of deforestation and forest degradation in Asia.  In addition 
to numerous conservation NGOs, research institutions, businesses and 
national governments (including the United States), AFP partners 
include the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Center for International 
Forestry Research (CIFOR), Food and Agriculture Organization, and 
the United Nations Forum on Forests.  Sponsors of the May 27-29 
meeting included the Responsible Asia Forestry and Trade-The Nature 
Conservancy (RAFT-TNC) Program supported by USAID, the German 
Association for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the European 
Commission-Indonesia FLEGT Support Project as well as the World 
Resources Institute, the Institute for Global Environmental Studies, 
the UK Department of International Development, the World Bank, and 
the Swiss Government. 
 
¶3.  The AFP Dialogue was an opportunity for discussion about illegal 
logging and how it might affect mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (or REDD).  The 
event, co-hosted by the MOF and CIFOR, included over 275 
participants -- representatives of governments and NGOs as well as 
businesses from the Asia Pacific region and beyond.  The dialogue 
examined whether financial transfers delivered through REDD could 
have a direct influence on the problem of illegal logging and forest 
governance. 
 
Frank Discussions and Valuable Coordination 
------------------------------------------- 
¶4.  Numerous participants value the AFP as a forum to coordinate 
current and future programs, enhance collaboration, and discuss 
contentious topics in an informal and non-intimidating environment. 
For example, Peter Younger, Manager of the Interpol Secretariat, 
stated that illegal logging is not a priority for Interpol member 
countries, given other competing issues.  A MOF Deputy Director for 
Investigation and Forest Protection admitted that Indonesia's 
prosecution rate of illegal loggers is extremely low, that those 
convicted are mostly low-level operatives instead of financiers or 
masterminds and receive relatively short prison sentences.  More 
than one Indonesian NGO representative questioned whether corruption 
would undermine the credibility of REDD projects in Indonesia.  The 
Minister of Forestry M.S. Kaban as well as the MOF Secretary General 
conceded that REDD alone is no panacea for illegal logging. 
Improved forest governance, they said, is vital for the success of 
both REDD and anti-illegal logging efforts. 
 
Widespread Support, Indonesian Engagement 
----------------------------------------- 
¶5.  There was broad and high-level MOF participation, including the 
Minister, Secretary General, Director for International Cooperation, 
a Special Advisor to the Minister (and former Director General for 
Forest Production Development), and Secretary of the Forestry 
Research and Development Agency.  CIFOR Director General Frances 
Seymour told Emboff the MOF has been unusually engaged and 
forthcoming in AFP forums.  She confided having been a skeptic about 
the AFP at first, but now sees its value in facilitating 
constructive dialogue among stakeholders that are sometimes at odds 
with one another.  Seymour said that CIFOR has been pleased to host 
(and effectively subsidize) the operations of the AFP Secretariat. 
However, she hinted at a reluctance to do so indefinitely without 
support from other partners.  Another senior CIFOR official said she 
hoped the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries would

provide a small stream of annual funding sufficient to support a 
modest AFP Secretariat. 
 
¶6.  Other AFP partners voiced strong support for the AFP's mission 
and activities.  Representatives of TNC, DFID, the Swiss government 
and Japan's Forestry Agency, among others, affirmed their long-term 
support for the partnership.  In addition, representatives of 
private company Certisource announced that it would apply for AFP 
membership. 
 
Broader U.S. Participation Urged 
-------------------------------- 
¶7.  CIFOR scientists and other participants hoped that more 
officials from USG agencies (USAID, USTR, Forest Service, as well as 
State) would attend and participate in future AFP meetings.  They 
noted the important pioneering role the USG has played in developing 
regional and bilateral partnerships to address illegal logging. 
These have included efforts through the East Asia Forest Law and 
Governance (FLEG) initiative and the International Tropical Timber 
Organization as well as bilateral MOUs with Indonesia and China.
