(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  In a meeting with Bainimarama on November 
27, New Zealand's Foreign Minister won his agreement to a 
meeting with Fiji's PM Qarase; PM Clark then called the PM 
and persuaded him to come for the meeting.  The meeting will 
take place at New Zealand's Government House from 10:00 a.m. 
tomorrow, with no definite end time or predetermined agenda, 
although Bainimarama is scheduled to depart at 6:00 p.m. on a 
Suva-bound commercial flight.  GNZ remains realistic about 
outcomes and continues its contingency planning should the 
coup proceed.  FM Peters will attend the PIF Minister meeting 
in Sydney on December 1.  End summary. 
 
Kiwis Engineer a Meeting between Qarase and Bainimarama 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶2. (C) Embassy officers attended a second Diplomatic Corps 
briefing by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) 
officials regarding the evolving situation in Fiji (reftel) 
including a supplemental US-only briefing with Heather 
Riddell, Director, Pacific Division.  While a Saturday, 
November 25 meeting between New Zealand Foreign Minister 
Winston and Commodore Bainimarama met with little result, in 
a second meeting November 27, Bainimarama agreed to meet in 
New Zealand with Fijian Prime Minister Qarase. New Zealand 
Prime Minister Helen Clark then called PM Qarase that evening 
to secure his agreement. Qarase will arrive at 8:00 p.m. 
today, November 28, on a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) 
plane.  The meeting between Qarase and Bainimarama is 
scheduled for tomorrow, November 29 at 10:00 a.m. at New 
Zealand's Government House. MFAT commented that both had 
accepted the Kiwi invitation "very quickly." 
 
¶3. (C) The meeting will last as long as the participants 
want.  MFAT says that there is no preset agenda for the 
meeting.  Also, while FM Peters will attend the meeting, no 
decision has been made about whether or not New Zealand PM 
Clark will take part. She has said publicly that she is ready 
to participate. Her involvement might include handshakes or 
assistance in a tough negotiating moment.  GNZ has indicated 
that it would like to see a press conference follow the 
meeting. (FYI: We understand that Australia's FM Downer and 
FM Peters had a telcon this afternoon, but MFAT was not able 
to offer a readout. End FYI.) 
 
¶4. (C) MFAT has heard, but has been unable to confirm, that 
Fiji Police Commissioner Hughes may attend the meeting.  They 
are unsure whether Bainimarama would agree to Hughes' 
participation. 
 
Anticipating outcomes 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) GNZ is realistic about the possibility for success, 
knowing that nothing may be resolved.  GNZ remains hopeful 
for a "best event" in which the two parties sign a written 
declaration.  Heather Riddell, Director of the Pacific 
Division said, "This could be the shortest meeting ever, or 
it may do some good.  It's hard to know." 
 
¶6. (C) Bainimarama is scheduled to leave for Suva tomorrow on 
a 6:00 p.m. Air New Zealand flight.  MFAT says that 
Bainimarama is anxious to depart because an ill daughter has 
been hospitalized in Fiji.  Qarase's departure has not been 
set, but MFAT told us after the briefing that we should not 
read into that. 
 
¶7. (U) GNZ sees this meeting, at a minimum, as setting the 
stage Friday's PIF Ministers meeting in Sydney, which 
Minister Peters will also attend. 
 
Planning contingencies

¶8. (U) GNZ continues its contingency planning, should the 
meeting fail and the coup plans proceed.   Among other 
things, GNZ will break-off of military relations, and GNZ 
will seek regional and international responses, including the 
PIF meeting and the Commonwealth, and possibly the UN. 
 
¶9. (C) MFAT is also looking into the evacuation of its 7,000 
citizens in Fiji.  They will rely on commercial flights as 
long as they are operating, and will charter flights if the 
commercial flights cease.  Contradicting what they told us 
earlier, MFAT clarified that, because of threats received to 
certain High Commission staff over the weekend, non-essential 
personnel and family members have been moved out of Suva. 
The personnel may return as early as tomorrow; the families 
possibly not.  But no one has been evacuated from Fiji.
