ACTION MEMO FOR IO COL. LARRY MROZINSKI (SEE PARA 6) 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL PGOV KPKO AF SU
SUBJECT: STRATEGIC/OPERATIONAL PLANNER FOR USUN MILITARY 
STAFF COMMITTEE 
 
REF: A)DJSM 0393-07 4 MAY 2007 
 
 
 
¶1. USUN requests LtCol. Glenn J. Sadowski, USMCR xxx-xx-xxxx, 
be activated to serve as the strategic/operational planner on 
the USUN Military Staff Committee (MSC) from 1 October, 2008 
to 30 September 2010, per DJSM 0393-07 dated 4 MAY 2007 (REF 
A). 
 
¶2.  LtCol. Sadowski is the lead strategic/operational planner 
on the USUN Military Staff Committee (MSC) for UN 
Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs). LtCol Sadowski's primary 
focus is Africa where some 70,000 UN peacekeepers are 
deployed. This amounts to over two-thirds of the total UN 
global deployment, and approximately 70% of the current 
annual peacekeeping budget of $7.2 billion. 
 
¶3.  LtCol Sadowski's is the point man for the U.S. 
interagency for Peacekeeping, particularly the UN/African 
Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). He maintains 
constant interface with numerous UN member states, the UN 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, UN Department of Field 
Support, U.S. Embassy Khartoum and the Joint Task Force Horn 
of Africa. LtCol Sadowski is responsible for providing daily 
updates to the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, and frequently 
briefs high-level US officials in New York and Washington, DC. 
 
¶4.  UN peacekeeping support U.S. national security interests. 
 A credible UN peacekeeping presence in areas of regional 
instability eliminates the power vacuums that breed 
insurgencies, and can prelude the need for a unilateral U.S. 
deployment.  The United States government therefore retains a 
significant financial and historical investment in UN 
peacekeeping. U.S. military planning assistance greatly 
improves the UNDPKOs planning process, and is in the 
interests of the United States Department of Defense. 
 
¶5. LtCol Sadowski's extensive combat experience, peacekeeping 
experience, his knowledge and familiarity with planning and 
executing UN PKOs coupled with his familiarity with the 
United States Department of State is a unique combination 
that makes him eminently qualified for this assignment. 
Request that he be activated two years on a non-reimbursable 
basis in order to continue to serve in his current capacity 
as a strategic/operational planner on the USUN Military Staff 
Committee. This timeline coincides with the operational needs 
of the missions on which he is focused. 
 
¶6.  ACTION REQUEST: That State Bureau of International 
Organization Affairs send a official Memorandum to the 
Department of Defense Executive Secretary requesting LtCol 
Sadowski be activated from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 
2010 to serve as the strategic/operational planner at USUN 
MSC.
