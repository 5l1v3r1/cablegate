respect to this research project.  We emphasize the importance of 
complying with Brazilian laws on the export of data and biological 
material. 
 
¶3.  We are providing this assessment of foreign policy implications 
in advance of receiving approval from the Brazilian Government for

completing the domestic review process.  Upon receipt of Brazilian 
approval, the Embassy will notify NIH by cable.
