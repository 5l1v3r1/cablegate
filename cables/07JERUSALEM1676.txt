ASSISTANCE NEEDED 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  During an August 9 meeting with the 
Consul General and CODEL Baird, Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad expressed his hope that 
additional U.S. assistance arrives quickly to improve the 
lives of Palestinians.  Fayyad said that the future of the 
West Bank/Gaza depends on disarming militias and the 
establishment of law and order.  He stated that PA actions 
will be pitted against Hamas' words, resulting in increased 
public support for the PA.  End summary. 
 
Security First 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During a meeting with the Consul General and U.S. 
Representative Baird on August 9 in Ramallah, PM Fayyad 
underscored that in order to weaken Hamas, the PA needs to 
move forward quickly with its plan to restructure its 
security forces and to disarm militias.  He described the 
disarmament of militias as the fundamental key to Palestinian 
success.  Fayyad said that any economic progress in the West 
Bank and Gaza will not be sustained without the establishment 
of law and order throughout. 
 
U.S. Support Needed Quickly; 
Winning With Good Works 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Fayyad stated that U.S. economic assistance will be 
essential during the upcoming months.  He said he hoped for 
an expression of strong U.S. financial support to the 
Palestinians that will:  (1) arrive quickly and (2) improve 
basic infrastructure to inject life into the Palestinian 
economy, which, he said, is critical for engine of 
sustainable job creation.  Fayyad said that he plans to work 
to attract international capital investment through the 
construction of Palestinian industrial parks.  Fayyad 
underscored that his government will "lead with action, not 
words." 
 
Palestinian Openness To The World 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Fayyad told Baird that in order to defeat Hamas, 
the PA needs to implement its vision of an open society and 
economy that responds to Palestinian needs.  He added that 
Palestinian potential lays in openness to the world, not 
hostility toward it.  Fayyad said that the combination of 
improved security and economic progress may improve 
Palestinian sentiment toward the prospects of a two-state 
solution, which has been diminished in recent years due to 
the separation barrier and reduced access and movement. 
 
Fayyad Not Sensitive About Pro-U.S. Stigma 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Responding to Representative Baird's question about 
the local perception of Fayyad's close relationship to the 
U.S., Fayyad said that he is not sensitive about the "U.S. 
ally stigma," as he would like all Palestinians to take his 
approach to the U.S. - "your country can be our model," he 
remarked.  Fayyad said he wanted to be explicit and direct 
with his Palestinian constituents and the USG about the 
dangers of radicalization and the importance of increased 
U.S. support. 
 
¶6.  (U) CODEL Baird did not have an opportunity to review 
this message.
