Six-Party Talks Update 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. Replying to reporters, questions on the number and 
schedule of bilateral meetings, MFA Spokesman Qin Gang 
said China, the DPRK and the United States held 
bilateral meetings this morning and China would hold 
meetings with the other three parties this afternoon. 
Qin said he was in no position to confirm reports that 
the United States and the DPRK had held other 
bilateral meetings outside of Beijing or that Banco 
Delta Asia officials were in Beijing for meetings.  As 
of today, 25 bilateral meetings have been held during 
this round of the Six-Party Talks, 13 of which related 
to China. 
 
¶3. When questioned if China was drafting a statement 
for this round of the talks, Qin said China was 
willing to do so, but that it depended on all parties 
reaching a consensus.  Replying to a question about 
China,s position on separating the denuclearization 
and sanctions issues, Qin emphasized that any 
statement would be multifaceted encompassing 
denuclearization, normalizing relations, peace and 
economic considerations. 
 
¶4. A reporter asked for China,s views on Assistant 
Secretary of State Christopher Hill,s remarks that 
 
SIPDIS 
China and the United States must reach consensus for 
this round of the Six-Party Talks to succeed.  Qin 
responded that success rests on the earnest and 
pragmatic joint efforts of all parties and that an 
overall consensus must be reached, rejecting the idea 
of relying on China to push a solution as not 
objective, realistic or fair.  He agreed with A/S 
Hill,s statement that the Six-Party Talks are an 
opportunity for China and the United States to further 
bilateral relations, stating that both countries 
desire greater coordination and constructive 
cooperation on bilateral and major international 
issues. 
 
China, Kazakhstan Energy Agreements 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5. In responding to calls for details regarding the 
agreements signed between China and Kazakhstan 
recently, Qin confirmed that 11 agreements were 
signed, but referred reporters to an extensive article 
in the People,s Daily for additional information. 
 
No Confirmation on China Adoption Policy Review 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6. When asked to confirm reports in the New York Times 
that China is reviewing adoption guidelines for 
foreigners, Qin had no information, stating this 
matter does not fall within the MFA,s purview and 
referred reporters to the relevant authorities. 
 
China-Japan History Study 
 
BEIJING 00024739  002 OF 002 
 
 
------------------------- 
 
¶7. Responding to a question about the upcoming China- 
Japan History Joint Study meetings, Qin said that any 
consensus reached should be based on the &three 
political documents8 (the China-Japan Joint 
Communique, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the 
China-Japan Joint Declaration).  China believes the 
meetings will help both countries increase mutual 
understanding.  When asked to comment on revisions 
being made at the Yasukuni Shrine relating to China, 
Qin reiterated that China,s position remains unchanged 
and opposes historical denial or distortion. 
 
China Urges Japan to Clear Chemical Weapons 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. In reply to a question on meetings between Japan 
and China to plan the destruction of abandoned 
chemical weapons in China, Qin emphasized that this 
"heinous historical crime" has contemporary issues and 
called on Japan to abide by its commitments in a 2005 
Memorandum of Understanding to destroy the weapons as 
soon as possible.
