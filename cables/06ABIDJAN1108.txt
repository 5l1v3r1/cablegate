¶1.  (SBU) In the afternoon of October 3, 2006, three Customs 
Agents who were arrested in connection with the toxic waste 
pollution scandal on September 7 (reftel A) were released on 
bail after a strike, threatened since September 26, commenced 
on the morning of October 3. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) The strike, conducted by nearly 2000 customs 
agents, lasted a mere four hours before authorities gave in 
to demands and released the prisoners.  On October 2, 
President Gbagbo conducted talks with the leaders of the four 
customs unions in the presence of the Junior Minister of 
Finance, Charles Diby, Acting Customs Director General, Agnes 
M ,lanhoro (the actual head of Customs, Colonel Major Gnamien 
Konan, was suspended by PM Banny because of the toxic waste 
scandal and the intense media circus surrounding the National 
Assembly's investigation into the matter), and Tax Office 
Director General, Lambert Feh KessQ.  Despite the President's 
intervention, customs unions officials publicly declared the 
strike would begin the following day, (although the national 
TV news broadcast cut off that portion of their statement, 
leaving the impression that night the strike was settled). 
On the morning of October 3, customs operations were halted 
at the port, airport and land borders.  Border crossings were 
open as immigration police were still at work, but the 
movement of goods was blocked, threatening the 3 billion CFA 
($5.8 million) Cote d'Ivoire takes in daily through customs 
revenue.  By noon, however, strikers called off their action 
following the government's decision to "provisionally" 
release on bail the three customs officers. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Background:   On September 7, 2006, three customs 
officers were arrested following the dumping of toxic waste 
in several districts in the city of Abidjan (reftel B).  The 
customs officers, who work at the Vridi oil depots, 
supervised the slops-removal operation from the ship  &Probo 
Koala, 8 which containing toxic waste.  The customs unions 
rejected responsibility for the illegal dumping, citing that 
the request received from the disposal company  &Tommy 8 made 
no reference to the toxicity of the slops.  On September 8, 
2006, the customs unions waged a three-day strike action at 
the Vridi oil depots, in protest of the arrest of their 
colleagues.  This strike was called off on September 12, 2006 
following mediation by President Gbagbo.  Two weeks later, 
the unions threatened another unlimited strike if their 
colleagues were not released on bail.  On September 26, the 
customs unions submitted to the customs management a general 
strike notification starting on October 3, 2006.
