The Kurdistan regional Minister of Health estimates that there are a 
total of 4,000 new cases since the middle of August. Of these cases,

------------------- 
Preliminary Reports 
------------------- 
 
¶2. Dr. Sherko Abdulla, Director General of Health, Sulaymaniyah 
Province, reported that over the past two weeks there has been a 
rise in illnesses with diarrhea and vomiting in Sulaymaniyah and 
Kirkuk, 2,000 cases and 1,925 cases respectively.  Laboratory tests 
have confirmed 70 cases are cholera, 23 in Sulaymaniyah and 47 in 
Kirkuk. Of the 47 Kirkuk cases only 2 have been confirmed as cholera 
by the Central Baghdad Public Health Lab. Six deaths have resulted. 
There is also one unconfirmed case of cholera reported in Salah ad 
Din. 
 
¶3. Chronic food and water infrastructure problems, along with 
seasonal or warm-weather diarrheal disease outbreaks are cited in an 
August 26 Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC) and 
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessment as possible causes of 
increased cholera cases.

Iraqis Respond 
-------------- 
 
¶4. The Iraqi Ministry of Health (MOH), without U.S. assistance, 
dispatched a team from the Public Health Directorate and delivered 
additional fluids and drugs to the North.  Additionally, Deputy 
Prime Minister Barham Saleh has met with representatives from the 
United Nations (UN) who have arranged to send an assessment team 
from the World Health Organization (WHO).  In addition, the 
International Medical Corps (IMC), a USAID implementing partner, has 
been in Sulaymaniyah since August 28, 2007, to assist in providing 
technical assistance in cholera management.  The IMC is taking on an 
integral part of the emergency coordination room that has been 
established by the Kurdish MoH.  Significant support is also 
provided by UNICEF in the form of equipment, medical supplies, and 
water purification kits. 
 
¶5. The Kurdistan Minister of Health, Dr. Abdul Rahman Yones, has 
requested investigational technical assistance from Multi-National 
Forces-Iraq (MNF-I) and has requested Multi-National Corps-Iraq 
(MNC-I) to provide additional guidance on public health measures 
that can be implemented.  The MNC-I Office of the Surgeon General 
will provide technical assistance, but not conduct the actual 
investigation.  MNF-I has created a "ready to assist" operational 
order to be released when appropriate. 
 
------------------ 
Coalition Response 
------------------ 
 
¶6. In partnership with the Iraqis, the United States Mission Iraq 
(USM-I) and coalition forces have formed a team to coordinate 
assistance efforts in managing these cholera situations.  Assistance 
will come in three parts;  supplies and equipment needed to manage 
the outbreak; a public information campaign to help stem the rate of 
infection; and technical expertise in handling the cases of cholera 
and investigating the cause of contamination.

¶7. COMMENT: The Iraqi Ministry of Health acted swiftly to move 
fluids, equipment and medicine to the Kurdish region, once help was 
requested by Kurdish officials.  They have kept in contact with the 
USM-I and requested assistance when needed.  While it's worth noting 
that field training for Iraqis regarding this very topic, outbreak 
investigation and control, is slated for no later than March 2008, 
it is promising to witness Iraqis demonstrating their willingness 
and capacity to take the lead. END COMMENT.
