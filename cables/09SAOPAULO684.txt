SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: AHMADINEJAD VISITS BRAZIL 
 
"An Undesirable Visit" 
 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-23) by Sao Paulo State 
Governor and possible presidential candidate Jose Serra states: "It 
is uncomfortable to receive in Brazil the head of a dictatorial and 
repressive regime....Democracy and human rights are indivisible and 
should be supported in any part of the world.  It doesn't make 
sense to act as if these values have lost importance just due to 
geographic distance....This is an unwelcome visit of someone that 
symbolizes the negation of everything that explains Brazil's 
projection in world.  This projection does not come from bomb 
threats or from economic coercion, which we don't practice, but 
from the examples of pacifism and moderation, democratic, human 
rights and tolerance values, built-in to our Constitution as the 
most authentic expression of the Brazilian people's way of life." 
 
 
 
 
 
"Ahmadinejad and Human Rights" 
 
Article in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (11-23) by Federal 
University of Rio Grande do Sul philosophy professor Denis Lerrer 
Rosenfield notes: "The Brazilian diplo-MA-cy [the writer highlights 
the letters MA, which means bad in Portuguese, suggesting Brazil 
has bad diplomacy] follows an accelerated route in the direction 
towards non-acknowledgment of human rights....The Iranian 
President's visit is one more example of diplomatic omission that 
is close to hypocrisy....Trying to explain Brazilian diplomacy in 
name of a supposed non-interference in domestic affairs of another 
country is another hypocrisy....because this is just what Brazil 
has been doing in Honduras....South-South dialogue is nothing but a 
mask that veils an option for progressive disrespect of democratic 
choices and human rights.  If this is the price to be paid for a 
seat in the UN Security Council, the question that arises is the 
following: is the price worth it?"
