JUSTIFICATION 
 
The bill that the Piracy CPI hereby presents has as its 
objective to modify the penal law, to combat piracy so 
prevalent in our society. 
 
During all these months of work, besides all those directly 
affected by piracy, the Commission heard various 
representatives of the Public Ministry.  They were 
unanimous in stating that despite the good intentions of 
the legislature with regard to Laws no. 9.099 and 10.259/00 
concerning Special Civil and Criminal State and Federal 
Judgeships respectively, the regulations in art. 89 of Law 
9.099, described in Law no. 10.259/00, create the 
impression that piracy is a crime of lesser importance. 
 
Subject determination concedes the benefit of procedural 
sursis to the author of a crime whose minimum penalty is 
equal to or less than one year. 
 
Since after the work done by CPI the connection between 
piracy and organized crime became overwhelmingly proven, 
the stiffening of some penalties is necessary, not simply 
to say that the law is rigorous, but to avoid that the 
people involved in these criminal organizations remain on 
the margins of the law, freely transiting the Brazilian 
territory, with so-called organized crime becoming more and 
more deep rooted, and reinforcing a "sense of impunity". 
 
This is why we are proposing an increase in the penalties 
currently in place from detention of three months to one 
year or fine to detention of two years and two months to 
four years and fine. 
 
The CPI is convinced that in addition to the force of the 
penalty of privation of liberty, the penalty of fines is 
essential as an educational tool; one should not substitute 
the other. 
 
The remaining changes were only to insert into four penal 
types the expression "with the intent to profit", excluding 
from the crime in this way, people who have practiced this 
behavior without this intent. 
 
Through the above and with the belief that the adoption of 
the measures hereby proposed will aid in the fight against 
piracy, the Piracy CPI counts on the support of the 
illustrious Deputies for the conversion of the bill into 
law.
