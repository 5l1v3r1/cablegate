INDONESIA TO COSPONSOR 
 
REF: STATE 40380 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche and nonpaper to 
Dicky Komar, Deputy Director for Human Rights and 
Humanitarian Affairs at the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU) on April 22.  Poloff underscored that the declaration 
on prisoners of conscience was an important affirmation of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  He urged 
Indonesia to cosponsor the declaration being proposed by the 
United States and the European Union. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Komar agreed this was an important issue.  He 
promised to review the U.S. position with other DEPLU 
officials and said that Indonesia would consider U.S. views 
as it decided whether to cosponsor the declaration. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poloff also raised the matter with French Embassy 
contacts.  (Note:  France is acting as de facto EU President 
in Indonesia as Slovenia, the current EU President, does not 
have a diplomatic mission in Jakarta.)  The EU has had no 
substantive response from the GOI on this issue.
