¶1.      (U)  Due to a misprint by the Royals Gazette on January 
7, 2010, the Department of Health has clarified that "There have 
been no confirmed deaths due to influenza A/H1N1. However, there 
has been reported a death in a person with influenza and a death 
in a person with confirmed influenza A/H1N1." (www.gov.bm) The 
Consulate has since clarified that the deceased individual did 
not die due to the virus but rather from other complications and 
was found later to have tested positive from the virus. 
 
 
 
¶2.      The Department of Health's website still states that 
there have been 25 confirmed cases in Bermuda as of January 16, 
2010, 23 residents and 2 non-residents.
