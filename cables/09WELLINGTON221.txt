¶1.        (SBU) Post received more detailed information regarding 
reftels from Brody  Sinclair, Policy Officer, Asia Division, South 
Korea (Trade), North Korea, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
The GNZ has begun the process of giving effect to UNSCR 1874 and 
will report on the progress by July 27, 2009.  They report no 
existing problems.  The last time NZ traded with North Korea was in 
¶1999.  At that time, NZ imported NZD$101,829 work of goods from 
North Korea, mostly insulated wire, while the last exports to North 
Korea occurred in 1996 when NZD$46,730 worth of sugar, caramel, etc 
was sent.  The GNZ reports no bunkering of DPRK vessels to date.
