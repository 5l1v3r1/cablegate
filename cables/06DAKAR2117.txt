¶B. STATE 138090 
 
¶1.  Guinea Bissau does not have a commercial textile or apparel 
manufacturing industry.  Consequently, it has not requested a 
textile visa to take advantage of duty-free exports under the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) to the American market. 
It does, however, have a dynamic new enterprise that has already 
exhibited fabrics in U.S. trade shows and that supports the 
continuance of AGOA's third fabric provision, in preparation for the 
years to come. 
 
¶2.  There are countless independent small tailors, weavers and 
industry associations in Guinea Bissau, but no commercial-level 
textile manufacturing industry.  Most of the tailors have 
pedal-operated sewing machines and produce only for the local 
market. 
 
¶3.  Among these small-scale apparel producers, there is a growing 
fabric enterprise, located in Quinhamel, just outside of Bissau, 
named Artissal and owned by Mariana Ferreira.  Ferreira is beginning 
international commercialization of her hand-woven fabrics albeit on 
a small scale.  The company consists of 12 traditional looms with a 
production capacity of 2,000 meters of fabric per month, four 
pedal-operated sewing machines used to make handbags, two small 
retail outlets, and 18 employees, 12 of which are full time. 
Ferreira sources her cotton from Sotiba in Senegal (which imports 
from Asia) and imports organic dyes from Burkina Faso. 
 
¶4.  Although Ferreira has exhibited fabric samples at trade shows in 
the U.S., she does not have the production capacity to export in 
large quantities to the U.S.  After she fulfills an order from South 
Africa in September, she will launch a research center for 
traditional dyes and designs.  Artissal has qualified for a 
fair-trade program sponsored by the European Union and expects to 
receive certification within the next year.  As Ferreira looks 
towards the American market, she supports an extension of AGOA's 
third country fabric provision.
