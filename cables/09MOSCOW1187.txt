Moscow, May 6, 2009

Regional Director 
USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) In the European Union 
Mr. Jay Mitchell 
 
The Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary 
Surveillance Service (VPSS) extends its regards 
to USDA/APHIS and informs you of the following: 
 
Due to new information on the epizootic/ 
epidemiological situation in the United States 
regarding the spread of Influenza A H1N1 
California/04/2009, VPSS is forced to restrict 
imports of all types of fresh/frozen meat and 
poultry, as well as all processed meat and 
poultry products that have not been heat-treated 
at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees Celsius 
for at least 30 minutes, from Illinois that are 
manufactured and packaged after May 6, 2009. 
This means that Illinois is now in the Zone 1 
risk level group. 
 
As of May 6, 2009, South Carolina has been 
downgraded to the Zone 2 risk group.  Therefore, 
the restrictions to South Carolina are limited to 
the export of live pigs, fresh and frozen pork 
and pork products, and processed pork products 
that have not been heat-treated at a minimum 
temperature of 80 degrees Celsius for at least 30 
minutes, from this state to the Russian 
Federation.  The prohibition covers pork products 
manufactured and packaged after May 6, 2009. 
 
Mr. Mitchell, let me assure you of my highest 
esteem.

Deputy Head
