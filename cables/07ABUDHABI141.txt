¶1. (SBU) On January 30, Econoff spoke with Dr. Saleh Al 
Ta,ie, head of the Relief and Emergency Department at the 
UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) regarding the UAE,s recent 
aid to Lebanon and Afghanistan.  Dr. Al Ta,ie said that the 
UAE,s $300 million pledge to Lebanon, announced at the Paris 
Conference on January 25, would be used for schools, 
hospitals and de-mining programs throughout Lebanon.  Al 
Ta,ie also noted that most of the UAE,s prior donations to 
Lebanon were also used for schools, hospitals and de-mining. 
(Note. The local press has reported that the Abu Dhabi Fund 
for Development, not the RCA, will disburse the $300 million 
in soft loans to Lebanon.  Post will be following-up with the 
Abu Dhabi Fund for Development.  End note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Econoff also asked Dr. Al Ta,ie about UAE 
assistance to Afghanistan.  Dr. Al Ta,ie said that the RCA 
is sending a plane with medical supplies to Afghanistan on 
February 1.  He also noted that the UAE sends one plane a 
month to Afghanistan carrying relief supplies and that -- so 
far -- the UAE has sent over 40 planes.  The relief supplies 
will be used by the Red Crescent hospital in Kabul.  Al 
Ta,ie also said that the RCA is close to finishing the 
Sheikh Zayed village in Afghanistan, which will include 300 
houses.
