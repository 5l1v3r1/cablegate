REF: 07 NDJAMENA 942 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. Chadian Foreign Minister Allam-mi told 
diplomats January 16 that Chad welcomed EUFOR/MINURCAT for 
the development dividend that the force was expected to bring 
and stressed that the force had "no hidden agenda to 
destabilize a neighbor."  Although Allam-mi assured diplomats 
that Chad was fully in control of its eastern territory, it 
is generally assumed that Chadian rebels see a fast-closing 
window of opportunity, and will try to gain a foothold in 
Chad before the EUFOR deployment.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Preparations are moving forward for the deployment of 
the European Force (EUFOR)/UN Mission for Chad and the 
Central African Republic (MINURCAT) now that additional 
European contributions (including a sizable plus-up from 
France) have filled the logistical and resource gaps.  On 
January 16 DCM attended a meeting hosted by Chadian Foreign 
Minister Allam-mi in which he announced that the Government 
of Chad was ready to sign the EUFOR agreement with the 
European Commission (represented by Germany as current EU 
President in Chad). 
 
¶3. (U)  Foreign Minister Allam-mi thanked France and the 
European partners for their support and promised to 
accelerate efforts to ensure EUFOR deployment.  He stressed 
that the mission was strictly to provide security to refugees 
and internally displace persons (IDPs).  EUFOR/MINURCAT had 
"no hidden agenda to destabilize a neighbor."  Allam-mi 
insisted that Chad was in full control of the eastern region. 
Nonetheless, Chad had accepted EUFOR in order to accommodate 
the wishes of the international community and on the 
understanding that it would provide a kick-start for 
development in the east through building of roads, clinics, 
schools and wells.  Allam-mi explained that the force would 
expire in one year and that Chad would do everything possible 
to demonstrate that it was master of the security situation 
so that there would be no follow-on UN force. 
 
¶4. (U) Foreign Minister Allam-mi announced that the 
President's Counselor for International Relations, Youssef 
Saleh Abbas would be the GOC's Special Representative to 
EUFOR.  An inter-ministerial coordinating body (French 
acronym CONIFAT) has been set up support and coordinate GOC 
actions on behalf of EUFOR.  CONIFAT will include military, 
security, territorial administration, humanitarian assistance 
and development committees.  Regional and sub-regional 
delegates will be stationed in 14 locations (for the most 
part co-located with EUFOR in eastern Chad) to oversee the 
"elaboration and execution" of development projects. The 
regional delegates also have broad authority to coordinate 
the international and national NGO's and international 
organizations on the ground. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador and DCM met with OCHA Deputy Fatma Diouf 
and OCHA's new Civil/Military Liaison Officer Sophie-Marie 
Reck on January 17.  Diouf acknowledged that CONIFAT was very 
much about demonstrating Chadian "sovereignty;" she hoped 
that it would not slow down work by adding another layer of 
bureaucracy.  Reck explained that humanitarian workers were 
concerned about maintaining their neutrality and about the 
possible blurring of roles if the military started performing 
humanitarian work. (Note: A distinction is made between 
"development work," such as building wells and clinics, and 
"humanitarian", which is considered to be provision of 
live-saving services such as food and shelter.  End note). 
Reck's job is to work with humanitarian actors and EUFOR so 
that roles and responsibilities are understood and 
maintained.  She said that she had spoken with EUFOR head 
Nash and he fully respected the different spheres of action. 
According to Diouf, EUFOR deployment will start in Abeche and 
move south initially.  Initial operating capability (IOC) is 
expected by end-February/beginning March.  MINURCAT will 
deploy at least thirty days after EUFOR deployment. 
 
Comment: 
 
¶6. (SBU) The three major Chadian rebel groups in Sudan 
announced shortly before Christmas via opposition web-site 
Al-Wihda that they had finally achieved a unified military 
command.  It is generally believed that they will seek to 
establish a foothold in eastern Chad before the deployment of 
EUFOR/MINURCAT renders their advance more difficult.
