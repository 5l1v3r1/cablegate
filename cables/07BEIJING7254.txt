Anti-Secession Law if Taiwan were to declare a state of

relevant Taiwan media reports."  Asked again for the 
spokesperson's opinion on the possibility that martial law 
could be implemented just before the Taiwan Presidential

¶4. Asked for comment on the difference between KMT candidate 
Ma Ying-jeou's "no unification, no independence, no armed 
conflict" policy and the Mainland's hope for peaceful 
reunification, the spokesperson said the Mainland supports a 
return to peaceful negotiations on the basis of the 1992 
Consensus, in order to discuss bilateral issues of common 
concern and to promote the healthy development of 
cross-Strait relations.
