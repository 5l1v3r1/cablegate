---------------- 
(SBU) KEY POINTS 
---------------- 
 
-- EU Envoy for Sudan Torben Brylle emphasized the central 
importance of CPA success and the need for medium-term development 
planning during a meeting with SE Gration 27 May. 
 
-- Brylle described the EU as pragmatic on contact with Bashir, 
encouraged taking Egypt's interests into account on Sudan, and 
worried Eritrea could be a trouble-maker in the east.  He also 
offered EU contacts and advice to facilitate a trip by SE Gration to 
eastern Sudan. 
 
-- Separately, Japanese Envoy for Sudan Amb. Keitaro Sato offered 
his full support to SE Gration and described Japan's USD 30 million 
contribution to a Sudan unity fund and separate funding of a 
vocational training center in south Sudan. 
 
End Key Points. 
 
EU Focused on Challenges of CPA Success 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a May 27 meeting, EU Envoy on Sudan Torben Brylle 
commended SE Gration's comprehensive focus on Sudan, noting the CPA 
is "the real big thing" and Darfur can be a distraction.  SE Gration 
responded that he would welcome EU participation in the June 23 
Washington Forum on Sudan, particularly as there are both implied 
and overt requirements for the EU in the CPA.  Brylle agreed with 
this characterization and mentioned the EU's own June 8-9 conference 
which will proceed in two steps: giving a platform to Sudan experts 
and then bringing in political decision-makers.  Brylle said 
expanding an understanding of CPA issues will show to all parties 
the unattractiveness of separation - a North and South Sudan would 
still be neighbors and share many issues, necessitating coexistence 
under any situation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Brylle feared the international community is facing today a 
far graver situation than anticipated when the CPA was signed.  The 
decline in the oil price is hurting Sudan badly, the SPLM is facing 
political challenges and often taking decisions outside of unity 
mechanisms, and there is a political-security meltdown in the south. 
 Brylle emphasized the need to plan for the medium-term, as there 
are currently no development instruments in place.  He criticized 
the international community for trying to use conventional concepts 
for unconventional situations in Sudan. 
 
EU Pragmatic on Bashir Contacts 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Asked by SE Gration for his advice on approaching Bashir, 
Brylle said the EU does not itself have precise guidelines on 
meetings with the Sudanese President.  EU members can have contact 
with Bashir on a case-by-case basis - but it can't be just for tea; 
real peace and security issues must be at stake.  Brylle offered no 
recipe but said certain political issues are of such a critical 
nature as to require contact with Bashir.  He reiterated that for 
the EU the ICC is important on principle, though he does not expect 
the ICC prosecutors to continue issuing indictments for VP Taha or 
others. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Brylle commended SE Gration's efforts to consult Egypt on 
Sudan, noting Cairo has interests that should be respected.  At the 
same time, Egypt must be taken out of its political and 
psychological opposition to Qatar.  Brylle also lauded SE Gration's 
efforts to get concessions from the Sudanese government on 
NGO/humanitarian access to Darfur. 
 
EU Concern Over Eritrea's Role and Eastern Sudan 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Brylle noted he was surprised none of the Envoys mentioned 
Eritrea during the plenary meeting as Asmara could be a 
trouble-maker on Sudan.  The Eritreans have "profound knowledge" of 
the situation in Sudan, according to Brylle, and some of President 
Isaias's key ministers and advisors are involved in Sudan issues. 
SE Gration responded that the USG may need EU help on positively 
engaging Eritrea on Sudan. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Brylle continued that he has good contacts in eastern Sudan 
and he recommended SE Gration visit the area early as "it's the next 
show in town."  Brylle offered to recommend key experts and contacts 
in eastern Sudan to help prepare and guide a Gration visit. 
 
EU Ready to Assist with Elections, Other Areas 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Brylle passed SE Gration a recent EU statement on Sudan 
elections and recommended this as a very useful area to work 
together with the USG - to set up standards and proper 
implementation for the elections.  Brylle believed ongoing issues of 
disarmament, demobilization, and rehabilitation will be critical and 
must be related to broader peace efforts. 
¶8. (SBU) Brylle said he had talked to JEM in Doha a week earlier and 
the leaders seemed less belligerent.  However, once the mediators 
get through the prisoners and ceasefire deadlock, there will be a 
multitude of issues to address.  On compensation, Brylle agreed with 
SE Gration's concern that it is no good to just throw cash at 
people, and others forms of payment are needed. 
 
Japan Offers Support and Money for U.S. Efforts 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶9. (SBU) In a separate May 27 meeting, Japanese Envoy for Sudan Amb. 
Keitaro Sato also noted the CPA is probably more important overall 
than Darfur, as a civil war is a high possibility without success of 
the agreement.  Sato noted Japan was ready to give USD 30 million 
for a unity fund. (Note: As described by a Japanese embassy officer 
later, the GOJ would cancel USD 30 million of GOS debt which would 
then be deposited into a unity fund in support of peace-building 
activities).  Sato also noted that Japan had recently started direct 
grant aid to south Sudan, and would be funding a vocational training 
center. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Sato reiterated that the Japanese government wanted to 
take advantage of SE Gration's appointment and efforts to do 
something positive on Sudan.  He expressed willingness to go 
"hand-in-hand" with SE Gration and follow his lead on peace efforts. 
 
 
¶11. (U) SE Gration's delegation has cleared this cable.
