(SBU) Polcouns delivered ref A demarche September 10 to 
Thamer Adwan, head of Foreign Minister Khatib's private 
office.  Adwan said the GOJ agreed that a Non-Aligned 
Movement statement supporting Iran's resistance to UNSC 
requirements would be counterproductive.  Adwan said Jordan's 
Minister of Culture, Adel Tweisi, would attend the NAM 
meeting in Havana, rather than the Foreign Minister as 
reported in ref B.
