SUBJECT: COMMERCE MINISTER CALLS FTA A TURNING POINT 
 
 
------------------------- 
FTA Will Expand Relations 
------------------------- 
 
¶1.  The Ambassador met with Minister of Commerce Ali Bin 
Saleh Al Saleh on September 15 to discuss the U.S.-Bahrain 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the potential for increased 
cooperation between U.S. and Bahraini businesses.  Al Saleh 
noted that this year had been a "turning point" in the 
U.S.-Bahrain bilateral relationship, particularly in economic 
and commercial relations.  The Ambassador pointed to the 
rapid negotiation of an FTA as evidence of that good 
relationship as well as the non-controversial nature of 
concluding the agreement with Bahrain.

Bahrain: Gateway to the Gulf 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The Ambassador called the FTA a model for others in the 
Gulf and an important launching point for U.S. efforts to 
promote open markets in the region.  Al Saleh said the FTA 
fit in well with Bahrain,s own policy of promoting regional 
free trade and becoming the "Gateway to the Gulf." He added 
that the GOB is also very aware that ensuring public security 
and stability are key to realizing its economic development 
goals.

Bahraini Expectations High for FTA 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Al Saleh pointed out the high expectations of the public 
as FTA implementation draws near.  He acknowledged the need 
to redouble GOB efforts to explain to Bahraini business how 
they might benefit from the FTA and asked for close 
cooperation with the U.S.  The Ambassador called FTA 
implementation a major focus of the USG and promised that the 
U.S. Embassy would work closely with the GOB and 
organizations like the newly founded American Chamber of 
Commerce to highlight the FTA.  He added that the FTA is a 
unique opportunity to spotlight doing business with Bahrain, 
but the window of opportunity to make an impact is finite. 
Without real opportunities for U.S. business in Bahrain, the 
impact of the FTA will remain symbolic.  The USG is now 
focusing its efforts on ensuring the FTA passes Congress 
before the election.  He suggested that the GOB work closely 
with parliament to ensure ratification.
