SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 1: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050073373 AND 050120640 
 
REF: EMAIL BALLARD-CLINE 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 050073373 and 050120640 for 
the export of firearms to Egypt.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for Request: Information obtained by PM/DTCC 
indicates that a Smith & Wesson firearm originally exported 
to M. M. Fathallah of Egypt bearing serial number BJM3308 may 
have been re-exported without Department authorization.  This 
request is for Post to inquire with M. M. Fathallah about the 
current disposition of all the firearms bearing the serial 
numbers listed in REFTEL.  Post is also requested to 
establish a baseline for M. M. Fathallah's annual sales of 
U.S.-origin firearms. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request:  Post is requested to verify that 
the firearms listed below were received by M. M. Fathallah 
and to determine the company's annual sales of U.S.-origin 
firearms.  Post is also requested to review the records of 
sale for all the serial numbers listed in REFTEL to determine 
if any were re-exported.  Finally, Post should obtain all 
available information on the Smith & Wesson firearm bearing 
serial number BJM3308 (exported on license 050120640) and 
provide that information to PM/DTCC.  The following points 
are included for guidance: 
 
(To M. M. Fathallah) 
 
--What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms? 
 
--Can you confirm receipt of all the firearms listed on these 
licenses? 
 
--Do you sell firearms to customers that reside outside Egypt? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
--Please provide all sales records for the firearms received 
in these transactions. (NOTE: Post should use this 
information to determine the current disposition of Smith & 
Wesson BJM3308 and provide this information to PM/DTCC. END 
NOTE) 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
