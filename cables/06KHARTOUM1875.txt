AGAINST CIVILIANS 
 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Amnesty International issued a statement July 31 
accusing the Sudan Liberation Movement faction led by Minni Minawi 
(SLM/MM) of killing and raping civilians in attacks against Korma 
and surrounding villages in North Darfur on July 4-8, 2006.  On 
August 3, the SLM denied the charges, stating it had not attacked or 
tortured anyone.  Amnesty's accusations are the latest in a string 
against SLM troops that also include the detention and torture of 
political opponents and civilians who oppose the Darfur Peace 
Agreement.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  Amnesty cited 72 killed, 103 injured, and 39 women raped.  In 
addition, the report states attackers looted large numbers of 
livestock and other possessions.  According to the Amnesty 
statement, the attackers said the villagers were being punished for 
opposing the Darfur Peace Agreement.  The UN has investigated the 
attacks and estimates that some 8,000 civilians were forcibly 
displaced that week as a result of these attacks and other fighting 
in North Darfur. 
 
¶3.  On August 3, Abdel Karim el-Sheikh, head of Minawi's advance 
delegation in Khartoum, denied that the DLM had ever attacked or 
tortured anyone.
