¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission has reviewed USG points re the 
U.S. Department of Labor's list of goods produced by forced 
labor or child labor with Indonesian Department of Foreign 
Affairs and other contacts.  Deputy Pol/C (Labatt) explained 
that the primary purpose of the list was to promote awareness 
and increase efforts to eliminate child labor and forced 
labor in the production of goods.  Our contacts responded 
that the GoI was committed to the elimination of such labor 
and was engaged with a variety of actors, including the USG, 
in combating the problem.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Per reftel, Mission has reviewed USG points re the 
US Department of Labor's list of goods produced by forced 
labor or child labor with the GOI.  (Note:  The list is 
mandated by the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Reauthorization Act, "TVPRA," of 2005.)  DepPol/C made the 
points to Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) Director for 
Human Rights Affairs Wiwiek Setyawati Firman on September 10. 
 Deputy Pol/C explained that the intent of the report was to 
raise awareness and increase efforts to eliminate child labor 
and forced labor.  Mission also flagged the report to other 
key ministries. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) DepPol/C went into the details of the report.  She 
emphasized that the listing of sandals, gold and tobacco did 
not indicate that all production of these products involved 
child labor, but that there were significant incidences of 
child labor in these industries.  Moreover, the list did not 
serve as a legal basis for a ban on imports.  That said, it 
was important that the GOI take steps to eliminate these 
forms of labor in the production of goods.  The USG was a 
partner in this effort and would continue to work with 
Indonesia in this key area. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Our GOI contact listened carefully to the USG 
points.  Firman responded that the GoI was working to 
eliminate all forms of child and forced labor in Indonesia, 
including in those industries highlighted in the report.  She 
noted that in addition to its own programs, the GoI was also 
working with NGOs and governments from around the world, 
including the United States. to stop child or forced labor. 
It was a difficult problem, she allowed, but Indonesia would 
continue its efforts to counter the use of such labor.
