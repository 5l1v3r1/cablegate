SUBJECT: DECLARATION OF DISASTER FOR KENYA FLOODS 
 
¶1.  Summary:  The October to December 2006 rains have 
been exceptionally heavy throughout Kenya resulting in 
serious flooding in the Coast, Western and Northeastern 
Provinces directly affecting approximately 300,000 
persons and with 23 recorded deaths so far as reported 
by Kenya Red Cross (KRC) and various media sources.  The 
rains have caused destruction of infrastructure, with 
bridges and roads washed away, cutting off access of 
vulnerable communities to traders and relief supplies. 
Crops in farmlands have been destroyed, with fear of 
renewed food insecurity looming in affected districts. 
In response to the flood crisis, Ambassador Ranneberger 
declares a disaster due to the catastrophic flooding in 
affected regions of the country and requests disaster 
assistance.  End Summary. 
 
El Nino Wrecking Havoc in East Africa 
 
¶2.  In Northeastern Kenya, heavy rains caused flooding 
in Mandera, Moyale, Marsabit Districts and in Garissa 
District where about 24,000 resident Kenyans and 
approximately 100,000 Somalis residing in the Dadaab 
Refugee camps have been directly affected.  The Tana 
River broke its banks when the Kiambere and Kamburu dams 
released waters, causing extensive flooding throughout 
Tana River and Garissa Districts.  The main roads from 
Garissa north to Mandera and Dadaab are impassable.  The 
majority of the districts in Northeastern Province 
currently affected by the floods are only just 
recovering from the effects of the prolonged drought, 
thus further stressing communities with repeated shocks. 
 
¶3.  Severe flooding has been reported in Kwale District 
in Coast Province where five bridges and most roads have 
been destroyed.  The main road from Mombassa to Kwale is 
currently cut off, impeding the flow of relief food and 
supplies.  Kilifi and Mombassa Districts in Coast 
Province are also impacted by the floods where 16 people 
died due to drowning and mudslides.  According to the 
KRC, about 60,000 people in this region have been 
affected. 
 
¶4.  Western Kenya has also been hit hard; people in 
Budalangi and Bunyala Divisions in Busia District are 
moving to higher ground due to flooding that is 
destroying crops about to be harvested.  In Kisumu 
District in Nyanza Province, the KRC is also reporting 
extensive flooding in some lowland divisions.  Central 
Province has not been spared as people are being 
displaced in Thika and surrounding locations due to 
flooding conditions. 
 
Impact of Floods on Health 
 
¶5.  Diarrhea cases have risen dramatically in all 
regions affected by floods.  A few cholera cases have 
been reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Moyale, 
Mombassa and Kwale where water sources have been 
contaminated, latrines collapsed and water systems 
destroyed.  Other water-borne diseases, such as typhoid 
and amoeba, are expected to increase in coming days. 
There is also concern that malaria will increase due to 
standing water. 
 
Responses to Date 
 
¶6.  The Kenya Red Cross is responsible for Rapid 
Response Emergency Coordination in support of the 
Government of Kenya Office of the President, Minister 
for Special Programs.  UN agencies and non-government 
organizations (NGOs) are also providing relief 
 
NAIROBI 00005076  002 OF 002 
 
 
assistance as well as Kenya military.  WFP is 
coordinating the airlift of food and supplies to 
affected areas, KRC, UNICEF and NGOs are providing non- 
food items such as blankets, mosquito nets, water 
containers, water purification supplies, and drugs as 
well as supplemental food items to flood victims.  The 
Kenya Army is building and repairing bridges and roads 
in the worst affected districts. 
 
¶7.  The USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(OFDA) currently has emergency drought assistance 
programs ongoing with six NGOs and UNICEF in the 
Northeastern and Coast Provinces targeting health, water 
and sanitation.  OFDA partners have the flexibility to 
divert current OFDA resources to respond to emerging 
flood conditions and OFDA is processing one such 
request.  USAID Kenya and OFDA Regional Advisors are 
maintaining communications with partners, GOK ministries 
and UN agencies. 
 
Disaster Declaration 
 
¶8.  As Ambassador, I hereby declare that an emergency 
situation exists in Kenya due to flooding, and that it 
is in the interest of the U.S. Government to respond to 
the crisis.  The emergency is beyond the capability of 
the GOK to respond and it will accept USG assistance. 
The Kenya Red Cross has a country-wide network and is 
leading the emergency response in coordination with 
other implementing agencies and has been designated to 
receive 100,000 USD from USAID/OFDA to facilitate 
emergency relief assistance to Kenya flood victims, in 
response to its public appeal for assistance.
