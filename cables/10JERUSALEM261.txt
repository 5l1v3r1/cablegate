The dailies run front page news on the killing of an Israeli soldier 
near the Za'atara checkpoint in the West Bank. The soldier was 
stabbed by a Palestinian man from Ya'bad town in Jenin who was a 
member of the Palestinian Security Forces. The local press 
highlights Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's 
condemnation of the incident, saying "An incident such as this goes 
against Palestinian national interests as well as the Palestinian 
Authority's efforts and the obligations it has taken upon itself". 
Ma'an highlights on its homepage that the IDF notified the family of 
the man who killed the soldier that their house will be demolished. 
 
 
The dailies also front page news on a failed attempt by settlers to 
capture lands on the Mount of Olives near the Beit Orot settlement.

living in the area. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam report on a new 
settlement project in the Ras Al-Amoud neighborhood in East 
Jerusalem. Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam report on the reoccupation of the

settlers visited Joseph's Tomb yesterday. 
 
The dailies highlight the issuance of new demolition orders against 
houses in Silwan. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that these new 
demolition orders come with the Israel Minister of Interior's 
decision to license the 'Yunatan' building. In related news, the 
dailies report on the conflict between the Israeli High Court and

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
 
Dr. Abdel Majeed Sweilem opines in Al-Ayyam daily under the title 
"Negotiations with No Discussions" saying: "If it's true that the US 
agrees to the Palestinian vision of resuming negotiations, then the 
Palestinians' compromises will remain a formality until it's certain 
that the US position is not only meant to drag the Palestinians into 
direct negotiations."
