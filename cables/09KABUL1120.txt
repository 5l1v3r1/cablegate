¶1. (U) This is an urgent action request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As reported Ref A, Afghan Agriculture Minister Rahimi has 
requested $32.4 million from donors to fund urgent procurement of 
wheat seeds and distribution in time for fall planting.  The Mission 
is aware of two USG programs that would be supportive of the 
Minister's request.  We recommend that Washington agencies take the 
steps necessary to announce progress on both as a deliverable for 
the May 6-7 US-Af-Pak Trilateral Summit in Washington, which Rahimi 
will attend. 
 
¶3. (SBU) First, we understand USDA may be prepared to allocate an 
additional $9 million under the Food for Progress (FFP) program for 
vegetable oil for Afghanistan.  Under this plan, the Ministry of 
Agriculture would reprogram for wheat seeds $9 million of FFP funds 
already on account at the Ministry and allocated for agriculture 
projects, and use the funds generated from sale of the new veg oil 
to replenish this account.  Second, USAID has proposed a $50 million 
extension of the Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased Production in 
Agriculture (AVIPA) program, and approval is pending in Washington. 
The first phase of this successful program distributed vouchers 
enabling reduced-price acquisition of seed and fertilizer by 247,000 
beneficiaries in 14 provinces. 
 
¶4. (U) The Mission urges Washington agencies to approve these 
requests in time for the Trilateral Summit.
