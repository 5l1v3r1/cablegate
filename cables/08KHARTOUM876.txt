¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. On May 31, Presidential Special Envoy Richard S. 
Williamson met with seven senior leaders of SLM-Minni Minnawi 
(SLM-MM). SLM-MM representatives voiced concern about DPA 
implementation, UNAMID's performance, GoS-USG bilateral discussions, 
and the indiscriminate targeting and detention of Darfuri's 
following the JEM attack. END SUMMARY.

- Dr. Ar-Raya Mahmoud Juma, Deputy Chairman SLM 
- Abdel Jabar Dousa, SLM Chief Negotiator, Commissioner Darfur 
Development and Reconstruction Fund

"NO DPA IMPLEMENTATION IN THE LAST 10 MONTHS"

¶3. (SBU) Muhammad Tijani opened the meeting saying "in the last 
ten months nothing in the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) has been 
implemented." With respect to the wealth sharing provisions of the 
DPA, Tijani noted that of the 700 million USD that should have been 
allocated to the Darfur Reconstruction and Development Fund by 2008, 
only five million has been received. Tijani stated that although 
Minni Minnawi has been appointed as a Senior Assistant to the 
President, "power without resources does not lead to any results." 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Tijani stated that the GoS has done "nothing" to improve 
the lives of refugees and IDPs. According to Tijani the GoS is 
still actively recruiting fighters for its militias, as it targets 
and attempts to weaken SLM-MM. In particular, the GoS labels SLM-MM 
an ethnic movement and uses its proxy forces to attack their 
movement. Tijani stated that the GoS makes no differentiation 
between DPA signatories and non-signatories. "We cannot and will 
not continue in this very bad situation foreveZ8EA0w Union, because 
the African Union "would at least talk to you," opened Traio. Traio 
referred to a Sudanese newspaper which quoted Force Commander Martin 
Luther Agwai saying "I will never risk losing a single UNAMID 
peacekeeper." Reflecting on this statement, Traio commented, "UNAMID 
seeks protection instead of protecting the people of Darfur." Traio 
stated that UNAMID "has no color and no taste as they neither monitor 
what is going on in Darfur nor protect Darfur's citizens." Traio ended 
his remarks stating that the people of Darfur see UNAMID as "a big 
joke" that is "here to certify the second round of the genocide." He 
said that the DPA's ceasefire mechanisms need to be urgently 
reactivated. 
 
SLM-MM ON BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS

¶6. (SBU) Traio stated that if the U.S. continues its bilateral 
discussions with the GoS, SLM-MM should participate. "Darfur is at 
the center of your talks, but SLM-MM does not have a seat at the 
table," said Traio. He stated that some observers see these 
discussions as only endorsing the National Congress Party as the de 
facto rulers of Sudan. 
 
JEM ATTACK 
- - - - - - 
¶7. (SBU) Abdel Jabar Dousa, the Chairman of the DRDF, stated that 
Sudanese opposition political parties are "trying to please the NCP 
after the JEM attack." According to Dousa, the NCP has used the 
event to marginalize SLM-MM participation in national institutions. 
He stated that the SLM condemned the attack on Omdurman and that the 
SLM-MM formed a number of committees to investigate indiscriminate 
Zaghawa detentions (reftels). Legal Advisor Abdul Aziz Sam said 
that 55% of Zaghawa tribe are Sudanese, and only a very small 
percentage of them participated in the attack on Omdurman. He 
stated that most of the soldiers were Chadian Zaghawa and child 
soldiers, some of which were as young as 12 years old. Sam stated 
that SLM-MM is working to document the location, numbers, and ethnic 
profile of detainees. 
 
¶8. (SBU) SE Williamson stated the U.S. commends the SLM leadership 
for its willingness to work towards peace in Darfur. He stated that 
the U.S shares SLM-MM's frustration with respect to the lack of 
implementation in the DPA. He added that the U.S. is concerned 
about reports of ethnic targeting following the JEM attack, and 
stated that he shared this concern with Presidential Advisor Dr. 
Nafie Ali Nafie more than three times on May 31. Williamson closed 
the meeting stating that the DPA must be the foundation for 
sustainable peace in Darfur. 
 
¶9. (U) This cable has been cleared by the office of SE Williamson.
