SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (04/29) - ABBAS'S FIRST 
100 DAYS IN OFFICE 
 
TOP STORIES: 
 
The dailies continued to carry front-page coverage on 
Russian President Putin's visit to the area, highlighting 
reports that his call to hold an international peace 
conference is fading away and has turned instead into a 
suggestion for a meeting of a group of experts. 
 
Al-Quds front-paged a report that President Bush's 
popularity has plunged dramatically in the first 100 days of 
his second term, in part because of "congressional battles 
that have stalled his main initiatives." 
 
The dailies front-paged reports, quoting American officials 
as saying that the U.S. is planning to sell Israel 100 
bunker-busting bombs.  Al-Quds reported that the Arab 
countries are concerned that Israel may carry out a military 
strike against the Iranian nuclear weapons program. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida published a public opinion 
poll conducted by Birzeit University showing that 33 percent 
of those surveyed believe that President Abbas has delivered 
on one third of his election campaign promises and that 84 
percent of the respondents support holding the legislative 
elections in July as scheduled. 
 
COMMENTARIES AND POLITICAL CARTOON: 
 
Rajab Abu Sariya commented in Al-Ayyam that after 100 days 
in office, President Abbas's main challenge has been and 
will remain the political process and Israel's failure to 
fulfill its obligations. 
 
Al-Quds ran a political cartoon depicting President Bush, 
dressed as a Roman solider, brandishing a sword as he rides 
in a chariot being pulled by a blindfolded horse, 
representing the world.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Rajab Abu Sariya commented in independent Al-Ayyam under the 
headline, "After 100 days in presidency, Abu Mazin still 
facing a long road" (4/29): "Not many people have bothered 
to take the time to evaluate what Mahmud Abbas, the elected 
president, has achieved in his first 100 days in office. 
There are many reasons for that, but the most important is 
probably the fact that these people have realized that 
Abbas's duties are extremely complex and involve both the 
political and internal levels. [.]  Obviously, the main 
challenge facing the Palestinian Authority in the past 100 
days of Abbas's term, and which will persist even after 100 
months., is the political situation.  Despite the importance 
of any accomplishments achieved at the internal level, the 
failure to achieve tangible and specific progress in 
accordance with the national program will certainly not be 
enough to pressure the Israeli side into recognizing our 
national rights."
