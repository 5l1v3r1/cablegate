(SBU)  In response to reftel, David Ellis of the FCO 
Afghanistan Group told Poloff November 22 that President 
Karzai's office had approached the UK Embassy in Kabul in 
very vague terms about possible problems obtaining Saudi 
approval for leased aircraft to transport pilgrims to the 
Hajj, but the Afghans provided no specifics.  Ellis commented 
that providing support "on a reimbursable basis" would be 
tantamount to "taking from our left pocket to pay into our 
right pocket," given that "we are bankrolling the Afghan 
government."  He also remarked that NATO is in no position to 
help.
