YEMENI RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 127423 
 
In response to reftel, post provides the following 
information from Vice Chairman Mustafa Bahran of the Yemeni 
National Atomic Energy Commission (NAEC). 
 
-- While the ROYG is considering pursuing development of 
nuclear power, any plans are purely speculative at this 
point.  Yemen has no nuclear power related facilities. 
 
-- The ROYG is considering pursuing nuclear energy to shore 
up energy security as its oil output declines.  (Note:  Most 
electricity in Yemen is currently generated by diesel fueled 
plants.  The ROYG hopes to use the country's previously 
under-exploited natural gas reserves to generate electricity 
but is aware that these reserves, like the petroleum 
reserves, are limited.  End Note.) 
 
-- It is too soon to forecast how the ROYG would pursue 
nuclear power.  (Note: Bahran told POL/E Chief that he finds 
it unlikely that the ROYG would be interested in owning or 
operating the plants or in seeking financing from 
international organizations.  End Note.) 
 
-- The key nuclear decision making body is the NAEC.  It is 
chaired by Prime Minister Ali Mujawar.  (Note:  Bahran is the 
Deputy Chair and oversees day-to-day operations.  End Note.) 
Other NAEC members include Minister of Electricity and Energy 
Awadh Sa'ad al-Socatri, Minister of Public Health and 
Population Abdelkarim Ras'e, Minister of Finance Numan 
al-Suhaibi, and Minister of Oil and Minerals Ameer 
al-Arderous. 
 
-- The NAEC is the existing nuclear regulatory authority.  It 
has a staff of 84 technical employees and has considerable 
inspection/enforcement authority in pursuit of illegal 
import/export of nuclear and radiological sources. 
 
-- The country does not have a nuclear liability law in 
place.  A draft law is under consideration by the Parliament. 
 (Note:  Post will attempt to obtain a copy of the draft law 
and forward it.  End Note.) 
 
-- The country has no manufacturing base involved in 
nuclear-related products.  It seems unlikely that components 
or contracting services for nuclear plants could be sourced 
locally. 
 
-- Yemen has no appreciable nuclear trained workforce and no 
program for training of domestic personnel in this area 
exists.  Any development of civil nuclear energy would 
require a significant foreign workforce. 
 
-- Yemen has no current or anticipated nuclear tenders. 
 
-- It is too early to foresee any nuclear sector 
opportunities for U.S. industry. 
 
-- N/A 
 
-- There are no formal agreements with any nuclear supplier 
countries. 
 
-- (Note:  Bahran did not specify what any political 
considerations would be, but indicated that he believed there 
would be some.  End Note.)
