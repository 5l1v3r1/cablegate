REF: STATE 115443 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (U) On August 24, Economic Minister-Counselor presented a 
non-paper based on reftel to Patrick Wittmann, Director, 
United Nations and Commonwealth Affairs Division, Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT).  Wittmann 
said that Canada values U.S. participation in ICAO and 
believes that Canada and the U.S. are like-minded on most 
aviation issues.  However, since Canada is the host country 
for ICAO, it is a discreet participant in that organization. 
While it has a vote in elections to the ICAO Council, it does 
not disclose its voting intentions or lobby other governments. 
 
¶2. (U) Wittmann promised to deliver copies of the U.S. 
non-paper to other interested Canadian government agencies, 
including Transport Canada.  He said that there has not yet 
been a decision on Canadian participation in the September 
18-28 ICAO Council meeting in Montreal.  However, if past 
practice is followed, he speculated that the Canadian 
delegation would be headed by Transport Minister Lawrence 
Cannon.
