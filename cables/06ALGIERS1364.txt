SUBJECT: LIBYAN, ALGERIAN MINISTERS OF INTERIOR DISCUSS 
BORDER AND SECURITY ISSUES IN ALGIERS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) General Salah Rajab El-Mismari, Libyan Secretary 
General of the Popular Committee and de facto Libyan Minister 
of the Interior, visited Algiers July 17-19, holding talks on 
border and security issues with Algerian Minister of the 
Interior Nouredine Yazid Zerhouni.  The official visit, 
according to the press and Embassy contacts, signaled that 
Libya -- and its leader Muamar El-Qaddafi in particular -- 
had pulled back from Qaddafi's initiative for a "Greater 
Sahara" tribal alliance and was looking to patch up relations 
with the GOA.  Terrorists and smugglers operating in the 
buffer zones between the undelineated borders of Algeria and 
Libya have been a rising cause of concern not just for 
Algeria but for all the greater Sahel countries.  Delineating 
the border, thought to be long overdue on the Algerian side, 
was the primary focal point of the discussions, according to 
press reporting and MFA sources. 
 
¶2.  (U) General El-Mismari, acknowledging Algerian security 
concerns about the lack of controls along the Libyan border, 
told journalists that planned "collaboration" in delineating 
the border -- the biggest breakthrough achieved during the 
visit -- would be "extremely beneficial" for citizens of both 
countries, especially those living near the border.  The 
Libyan official considered this joint decision, which he 
described as a partial settlement of the issue, as a sign of 
"real improvement" in bilateral relations.  The meetings in 
Algiers also led to the signing of an agreement on 
across-the-board security cooperation; cleared the way for 
the reactivation of the bilateral Joint Commission on 
Security; and set the stage for better Libyan-Algerian 
cooperation on "organized crime, terrorism, illegal 
immigration, drug trafficking, and migration flows." 
Algerian officials privately welcomed El-Mismari's visit as 
an indication that Qaddafi was becoming a "more pragmatic" 
leader, according to one MFA source.  Zerhouni, for his part, 
was quoted by one reporter in an off-the-record session as 
welcoming his Libyan counterpart's visit as "an important and 
positive step" in improving bilateral relations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  MFA sources quietly credit the United 
States for making El-Mismari's visit, and the progress 
associated with it, possible.  Without going into detail, one 
MFA official commented that U.S. engagement of Libya on the 
Algerian border issues was key to scheduling the visit and 
making it successful.  Post, for its part, is unaware of what 
role the U.S. may have played with the Libyans on this issue.
