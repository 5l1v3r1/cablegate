¶1. (SBU)  On November 24, Poloff shared the points in Reftel with 
Chantal Elsenhout, Acting Head of International Organizations, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Elsenhout responded that the 
overarching principle for Suriname's foreign policy on the 
Palestinian issue is to "support the legitimate quest of 
Palestinians for peace, and that it should be based on UN 
resolutions on the matter." 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  In general, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
tends to defer its UN voting decisions to its Mission in New York, 
which holds the greater influence and responsibility for deciding 
which way Suriname will vote.  There is at least one official from 
International Organizations on detail in New York to work on-site 
on United Nations issues, rather than relying on communications 
back to the Ministry.  In addition to our demarching MFA here, 
delivery of demarches directly to the Mission in New York also 
could be helpful in influencing Suriname's voting pattern.
