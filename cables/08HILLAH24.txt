¶1. (U) This is a PRT Karbala Reporting Cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary:  On Thursday, March 13, 2008, Karbala PRT Rule 
of Law (ROL) Coordinator, met with Mr. Ahmed Sadiq Al-Mosewy 
(Karbala Human Rights Organization Coordinator/Justice Network 
for Iraq Prisoners), Mr. Nabeel Mohammed Hassan (Deputy Chief of 
Karbala Human Rights Organization), and Mr. Falah Abud Al Hassan 
(Member of Karbala Human Rights Organization) The meeting was 
requested by ROL Coordinator Mathias Onderak and REO Locally 
Engaged Staff (LES) Kamel El Hassani to make contact with the 
Karbala Human Rights Organization ("KHRO") to discuss the 
current KHRO projects and the status of Karbala detainees and 
prisoners.  A wide range of issues was discussed and including 
the pending move of the PRT to Karbala province.  End Summary. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) KHRO expressed concern that some projects they had 
hoped to work on with the PRT were being delayed or neglected. 
ROL Coordinator explained to KHRO that the PRT has been 
undermanned and that the USG was ramping up a fully staffed PRT 
for deployment specifically for Karbala Province.  PRT Karbala 
plans to be much more engaged in the province and specifically 
the ROL Coordinator is tasked with working on Karbala Province 
Rule of Law issues.  KHRO and Rule of Law Coordinator agreed 
that a PRT and Rule of Law Coordinator dedicated only to Karbala 
issues will be beneficial to confronting human rights abuses in 
the province. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) KHRO was encouraged that several Karbala judges have 
received laptop computers and computer training.  KHRO indicated 
that more than one month prior they asked the PRT to review a 
QRF request regarding advanced computer training for judges and 
computer training for legal support staff.  KHRO wondered why 
they had not heard about the request.  ROL Coordinator assured 
KHRO that the proposed training programs and QRF request would 
be evaluated by the ROL Coordinator.  ROL Coordinator made clear 
there were no guarantees about fund appropriation for the 
program but that the requests would be taken seriously, 
reviewed, and an update on the status would be timely provided 
to KHRO. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) KHRO explained that the correctional centers in 
Karbala are terribly overcrowded and disease infested.  KHRO 
stated a similar environment exists in the Al Hillah prison 
where Karbala Province felony convicts are housed.  KHRO also 
noted that recently they asked the PRT for assistance and help 
on a proposal to provide dental and health care to the prisoners 
and receive QRF funds for this purpose.  Rule of Law Coordinator 
advised this plan and proposals would be timely reviewed along 
with the advanced computer training proposal. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Rule of Law Coordinator asked KHRO for documents on 
the number of Karbala Province correctional facilities (adult, 
women, and juvenile) and the number of prisoners currently 
housed in these facilities.  KHRO noted they have done much 
research on this issue and agreed to supply this information 
with the caveat that some of the evaluations are six months old. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Rule of Law Coordinator asked KHRO what the effect of 
the newly enacted amnesty law had on Karbala correctional 
facilities.  KHRO stated that they believe as many as 1/3 of all 
Karbala prisoners would be released because of the Amnesty Law 
(it was explained that this figure includes woman and 
juveniles).  KHRO did express concern that the Karbala Province 
prisoners currently housed in Al Hillah will not have access to 
lawyers or be able to file the appropriate documents for 
release.  Rule of Law Coordinator assured KHRO that the amnesty 
law and its' implementation will be discussed shortly when the 
Rule of Law Coordinator meets with Karbala Chief Justice Abdul 
Nour.  KHRO stated that they have found Judge Adbul Nour easy to 
work with. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) KHRO commented that they often deal with the very 
"dangerous" work of combating public administrative corruption 
and asked if this will also be addressed by the new Karbala PRT. 
 Rule of Law Coordinator indicated that the Karbala PRT is also 
concerned about public administrative corruption and has a 
governance specialist working in the PRT.  KHRO stated that they 
hope to work closely with all aspects of the Karbala PRT that 
work on human rights issues and thanked the Karbala PRT and the 
Rule of Law Coordinator for their service. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Comment:  KHRO was very pleased to hear that a ROL 
coordinator was assigned to the PRT.  They look forward to 
working the many issues that face them and the PRT over the 
coming months and years.  KHRO can serve a good purpose by being 
the eyes and ears for the PRT for Human rights and prisoner 
issues.  ROL Coordinator surmises there is much work to be done 
and is looking forward to the challenge.  Karbala has been 
 
HILLAH 00000024  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
neglected for a period of time and KHRO was pleased to learn 
that the USG was re-engaging in the province on all levels and 
is looking forward to working with us in the short and long 
term. End Comment
