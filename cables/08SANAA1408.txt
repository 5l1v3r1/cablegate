SUBJECT: YEMEN RECEIVES DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL IRANIAN 
ENTITIES NON-PAPER. 
 
REF: STATE 88759 
 
On August 19 Poloff delivered the reftel non-paper to Khalid 
Al-Akwa, Assistant Deputy Foreign Minister.  Al-Akwa 
expressed interest in whether any of the newly designated 
Iranian entities were public companies.  Although he was 
unable to remember the name of the company, he said that an 
Iranian power company working in Yemen has defaulted on 
payments.  He mentioned that if the company were designated 
under E.O. 13382, it would be a convenient excuse for the 
ROYG to ask the company to leave Yemen.  Poloff encouraged 
Al-Akwa to pass along the company,s information and offered 
to confirm whether the company is designated.
