¶2. (U) This telegram constitutes the Construction Security Plan 
(CSP) for the installation of a split-pack air conditioning unit in

installation of ONE split pack air conditioning (A/C) unit in Room 
216 in the Political Section suite of the CAA of Embassy Ankara. 
There is no work in the core areas involved in this project.  The 
split-pack A/C unit will be installed on the exterior walls of the 
CAA, with a four to five inch penetration made in CAA outer wall for 
the refrigerant and drainage tubes of the split unit.   This room 
was built as an extension to the original building and has no 
existing room air conditioning.   The work for installation of the 
split unit will be accomplished in the following manner: 
 
¶A. Mounting of the exterior unit of the split-pack on the outer part 
of the exterior wall adjacent to Room 216.  (Three hours) 
¶B. Mounting of the interior unit of the split-pack on the wall in 
Room 216.  (Three hours) 
¶C. Boring of hole in outer wall for passage of refrigerant and 
drainage tubes.  Seal holes after installation.  (One hour) 
¶D. Connections of the new split pack A/C unit including electrical 
and plumbing connections.  (Five hours) 
¶E. Testing of unit.  (One hour) 
¶F. Clean up and retouch. (One hour) 
 
¶4. (U) Estimated start date: 26 April 2010 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Estimated completion date: 28 April 2010.  The exterior 
and interior placement and mounting of the split unit will take less 
than one day.  The final connection to include plumbing and 
electrical connections and testing will take no more than one day, 
and it will begin and be finished the same day.   The estimated 
completion can be earlier if approval of this CSP can be expedited. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Estimated Cost:  US$1,800.00.  To include the A/C 
equipment, materials and labor. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Labor Schedule:  Work will be performed by the Post's 
IDIQ Air Conditioning contractor.  There will be a total of four (4) 
workers performing the tasks.  Two craftsmen will be inside Room 216 
and the other two will on the exterior of the building.  Criminal 
and other indices checks on the workers will be conducted prior to 
start of work.  Only workers yielding negative results to these will 
be allowed to work.   As work will take place within CAA, the 
contractors performing the work will be under continuous escorts and 
surveillance by appropriately cleared American employees.  Two 
Cleared American Escorts (CAE) will monitor the four workers to 
maintain the proper escort ratio.  Tools and non-electrical 
materials brought in by the contractors will be inspected by ESO 
before entering the work area. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Procurement plan:  The split units and materials for 
this project will be acquired through random selection from post 
stock (1 unit to be selected from 24 units available from post stock 
at GSO). 
 
¶9. (SBU) Secure storage:  Split unit after random selection will 
be taken to and maintained in the ESO secure storage, maintained 
under surveillance and U.S. control. 
 
¶10. (SBU) The Embassy RSO is designated as the primary Site 
Security Manager (SSM) and will interface regularly with the 
construction personnel and security escorts to insure compliance 
with security procedures.  ESO will provide technical security 
assistance when needed.  The RSO (SSM) and ESO will have 
unrestricted access to the work site to ensure full compliance with 
proper security procedures and requirements.  The RSO (SSM) may 
delegate the day to day operations of this project to the GSO, FM or 
other security personnel, but remains responsible for the security 
requirements associated with this specific project.  The RSO (SSM) 
may supplement, but will not lessen the provisions of this CSP as 
required by local conditions and prevailing circumstances.  The RSO 
(SSM) will promptly notify the escort personnel of any security 
inconsistencies or unauthorized work material found on the site. 
The RSO (SSM), in consultation with OBO/PE/SM and DS/PSP/PSD/CAT, 
may hold the project in abeyance pending resolution of any 
inconsistencies or security related issues such a time as remedial 
actions are taken to resolve the problem. 
 
¶11. (SBU)  Project documentation:  The CAE personnel, acting by 
and through the RSO (SSM), will maintain a log, which identifies 
 
workers, materials, detail of work, and any anomalies.  The RSO 
(SSM) will immediately report any deviation from the CSP plan to 
DS/PSP/PSD/CAT and OBO/PE/SM.  The log will be verified daily by the 
RSO (SSM) and become part of the permanent project documentation to 
support any additional technical inspections. 
 
¶12. (SBU) ACTION REQUESTED: Embassy Ankara requests DS/PSP/PSD 
review and concur with this CSP.  Work is estimated to start in late 
April 2010 or earlier if approval of this CSP is received.  Points
