SUBJECT: JORDANIAN AIR CHARTER COMPANY BEGINS SERVICE TO IRAQ'S 
NAJAF AIRPORT 
 
¶1. (U) Jordan Aviation (JA), Jordan's largest charter airline, flew 
a test flight to Najaf in southern Iraq on December 6 and began 
charter service to Najaf International Airport on December 12. 
According to press reports, JA Chairman Captain Mohammed Al-Khashman 
said that JA will dedicate three planes to serving Najaf, a 
destination for an estimated 3 million, primarily Shi'a, pilgrims 
annually. 
 
¶2. (U) JA was founded in 1998 and operates 18 commercial aircraft 
including Boeing 737s and 767s and Airbus A310s and A320s with a 
primary base in Aqaba.  JA plans to grow to 30 aircraft and 2000 
employees in 2009.  JA provides charter flights to Baghdad and has 
transported 65,000 Iraqis on the hajj over the past three years, 
including 24,000 in 2008.  JA is Jordan's second largest aviation 
company after Royal Jordanian and is also active in aviation 
leasing. 
 
¶3. (U) Al-Khashman spoke on November 23, at the First International 
Transport Conference and Exhibition in the Dead Sea on aviation 
challenges and opportunities.  While lamenting the impact of the 
recession on air travel, he said that a 60 percent reduction in fuel 
costs over the past 3 months was good for the sector.  He said 
transportation relies heavily on public-private partnerships and 
credited the GOJ with significant investments in airports in Amman, 
the Jordan valley, and in the Mafrak economic zone.  He also said 
that Jordan, with its good location and political stability, will 
benefit greatly from the rapid growth in aviation in the Middle 
East.
