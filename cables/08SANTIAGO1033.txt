REF: STATE 122262 
 
Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Fernando Salas, MFA 
Central America desk officer, on Nov. 25.  Salas stated that 
Chile was very concerned about the violence that had occurred 
in Nicaragua following the elections.  Chile views the 
outcome and conduct of the elections as an internal matter 
and, as a matter of policy, does not make public comments nor 
raise in bilateral discussions questions about internal 
politics.  However, Chile is very active in multilateral fora 
and does raise these issues in those contexts.  To this end, 
Salas noted that the issue had already been discussed at the 
OAS and that the Rio Group was working on a declaration of 
concern regarding the elections.  Chile plans to take an 
active role in supporting such a declaration.
