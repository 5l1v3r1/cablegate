SOUTHERN SUDAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On October 2, Sudan People's Liberation Army 
(SPLA) forces loyal to Deputy Chief of Staff Paulino Matip and 
bodyguards of Governor of Unity State, Brig. Gen. Taban Dang Gai 
clashed in the town of Bentiu resulting in the death of sixteen 
people and twenty-one injured.  GOSS press statements claim the 
clashes between the units were a "misunderstanding."  A number of 
GOSS and UN officials visited Matip on October 2 to request he get 
control of the SPLA forces loyal to him.  The situation is now calm 
in Bentiu, but there are reports that  different SPLA units may be 
reorganizing.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On October 2, clashes between SPLA forces acting as 
bodyguards to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the SPLA, Paulino Matip 
and the Governor of Unity State, Brig. Gen. Taban Dang Gai erupted 
resulting in the deaths of sixteen people-twelve SPLA soldiers and 
four civilians, including one child-and twenty-one injured - 
seventeen SPLA soldiers and four civilians.  Tensions in Bentiu 
remained high on October 2, although the situation calmed down over 
the weekend.  The airport in Bentiu was closed, and all UN and other 
organizations locked-down and elevated to Level IV. 
¶3.  (SBU) Reasons behind the clash are still speculative.  Minister 
of Interior Paul Mayom told the press that the clashes were a result 
of a "misunderstanding between the SPLA forces guarding Matip and 
those guarding the governor."  Matip publicly stated that he 
believed the governor was trying to bribe SPLA troops loyal to him 
(Matip) in Bentiu and bring them over to the governor's  side.  Some 
claim that the clash was a result of pressure and attempts to remove 
the current governor.  While others believe Matip's continued 
reliance on a large private army for protection incited the clash. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  On October 3, SPLA Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations 
General Mabutu Mamour led an SPLA delegation to Bentiu to try and 
resolve the dispute between the two SPLA factions.  UN officials in 
Bentiu report that the delegation failed, as they were unable to 
persuade the commander of Matip's forces to come to Bentiu for a 
meeting to resolve the crisis.  The UN reports that the commander 
and his forces refused to return to Bentiu for talks for fear of 
their lives as the SPLA made no guarantee for their safety.  Mamour 
and his delegation returned to Juba on October 5 without success. 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) UN officials have been meeting with Matip since October 2 
to try from Juba to  resolve the problem .  However, they believe 
that Matip's position is hardening, following statements by Salva 
Kiir on October 4 regarding a need to move forward with SPLA 
transformation and the disbanding of all private armies, including 
Matip's.  UN officials expressed serious concern as they believe any 
attempts to go after private armies in Bentiu, Mayom, Mankien, and 
similar locations will have direct repercussions on security in 
Juba. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  Recent clashes in Jonglei and Unity states 
continue to raise concerns over armed militia and private armies 
throughout southern Sudan.  While the GOSS is attempting to disarm 
the civilian population, they need to also consider how to bolster 
police presence in strategic areas that can respond and quell these 
eruptions.  It is also imperative that the GOSS actually implement 
their policy to disarm and/or integrate the remaining private armies 
and militias into state security forces.  If not, they will continue 
to pose a destabilizing effect for the GOSS.
