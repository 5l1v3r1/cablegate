SUBJECT: Request for a DVC with Thomas Mann and David Gergen to 
discuss the U.S. Elections. 
 
¶1.  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Post requests a DVC with highly respected 
congressional scholar Thomas Mann and political analyst David Gergen 
to discuss the state of the 2008 elections, the candidates, their 
policies, and their potential impact on Congress and the Presidency. 
 
 
¶2. PREFERRED ACTIVITY DATE, FISCAL YEAR, AND QUARTER:  This is an 
FY08 program, which is requested ideally for the week of the 15th of 
September; fourth quarter; 5-6.00pm Washington time = 0900 NZ time 
the following day. [The ideal would be 16th 5-6pm DC/NY time, which 
would be 17th September 9-10am NZ time]. 
 
JUSTIFICATION OF PROGRAM: The national climate for the 2008 
elections portends big changes in the USA, and Post would like to 
discuss the possible implications for New Zealand - and the world. 
There is a huge amount of interest in these elections in New 
Zealand.  Mann and Gergen would form a perfect team - the former 
speaking widely on issues related to campaigns, elections, and the 
effectiveness of Congress. He has conducted polls for congressional 
candidates and overseen national public opinion studies.  Gergen, 
best known as a political consultant and presidential adviser, would 
use his experience to comment on relevant issues.  There would be a 
good deal of interest amongst our contacts in these two 
interlocutors, and we would be providing "top-notch" candidates for 
this important public Affairs event. Post regards a DVC with our 
contacts in Auckland and Wellington at this post-convention time as 
a most valuable opportunity for our contacts to discuss election 
issues directly with these interlocutors, who are highly respected 
in their fields. 
 
Jon Johansson, a New Zealand scholar of the U.S. election process, 
believes that by mid-September we "should have a very good view of 
the shake-down between McCain and Obama." [This DVC is thanks to Jon 
for his support of our "Election" programs in New Zealand - and he 
requested Gergen.] 
 
¶4. MPP THEME AND EXPECTED AUDIENCE: MPP GOAL 08-01 Mutual 
Understanding. Audience Expected:  To include members of the New 
Zealand government, including members of Parliament; local body 
politicians, lobbyists, political consultants, government officials 
and foreign embassies, academics, opinion-makers, policy-makers, 
members of the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs 
(NZIIA), and the media.
