¶1. (SBU) We shared Ref A message on the need for further funding for 
the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) with Deputy Finance 
Minister Storchak, and with International Department officials from 
the MFA, Health and Social Development Ministry, and the Federal 
Surveillance Service for Consumer Rights Protection and Human 
Well-Being (Rospotrebnadzor).  On November 6, Deputy Minister 
Storchak told us that it was unlikely that Russia would be able to 
contribute any additional funds beyond the $18 million already 
committed as part of the infectious diseases focus of Russia's 2006 
G8 Presidency (Ref B).  However, Storchak said that he would explore 
the possibility of accelerated disbursement of the remaining $15 
million Russian commitment to the GPEI ($3 million has already been 
received by the WHO.)  He noted as an aside that Russia is being 
approached from all corners to contribute money to international 
causes and initiatives. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rospotrebnadzor International Department Director Alexander 
Kucherenko also told us on November 6 that WHO Director General 
Margaret Chan wrote to Finance Minister Kudrin and Rospotrenadzor 
Head Onishchenko three months ago requesting a further Russian 
contribution to the GPEI.  The Russians had already responded to the 
WHO that a further contribution for polio eradication was not 
possible at this time.
