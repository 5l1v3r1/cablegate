¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND CG COMMENT:  Tijuana's latest wave of 
violence (reftels) continues, with a number of fresh 
assassinations of individuals apparently tied to the two main 
organized crime cartels.  The Baja Attorney General told CG on 
January 7 that there is no sign that the renewed intra-cartel 
war is abating, but he affirmed that the government security 
services at all levels are working in crisis mode to reestablish 
order.  One disturbing new trend appears to be willingness of 
the cartels to target family members.  Following is a spot 
report from the Congen's EAC.  END SUMMARY AND CG COMMENT. 
 
¶2.  (U) On January 5, 2010, Post's Emergency Action Committee 
(EAC) was convened to discuss two incidents of shooting near the 
U.S. Consulate General (USCG) which occurred the previous 
afternoon. EAC participants included CG, CONS, RSO, DEA, 
DHS-ICE, MGT, PAO, and ATF. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On 01/04/10, departing staff members saw police units 
and road blockage at close of business due to two separate 
exchanges of gunfire in Mission residence neighborhoods. 
Mission personnel were not involved in the shooting incidents, 
but they occurred within a few blocks of where Mission personnel 
work and live, and hindered travel to Mission residential areas 
throughout the evening. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) U.S. Consulate General Tijuana's Law Enforcement 
Working Group (LEWG) informed the EAC that on 01/04/2010 at 
about 1700 hours, an exchange of gunfire in the streets in front 
of a popular Lomas Hipodromo shopping area (Soriano grocery 
store), left one victim dead in his vehicle.  This drive-by 
shooting was within blocks of several Mission residences, about 
one-half mile from the Consulate main building.  The target was 
allegedly connected to a drug cartel, shot and killed by rival 
cartel hit-men. Responsive police activity presence in the area 
slowed traffic for staff members leaving the Consulate, who 
observed the victim's bullet-riddled vehicle and significant 
police presence during their evening commute. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The second shooting incident occurred within an hour 
about one mile away, injuring Josi Fernando Labastida Fimbres, a 
member of one of Tijuana's most prominent families (Fimbres 
family owns the Calimax grocery store chain).  The victim died 
within a short time in a local hospital. This second shooting 
occurred on Merida street, a few blocks from the Principal 
Officer's residence (CGR), and within one-half mile of the 
Consulate main building.  This route between the Consulate and 
the CGR was totally blocked for police investigation for more 
than an hour, requiring alternate routing of local guard mobile 
patrols. 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The two shootings of 01/04/10 were on opposite sides 
of the Consulate main building, so two separate Mission 
residence neighborhoods were impacted at the same time. That 
day, eight violent homicides were reported in Tijuana within a 
three hour period.  LEWG informed the EAC that in the last few 
days, Tijuana has seen increased crime activity.  Heavily armed 
police presence around the U.S. Consulate is visible and 
frequent, due to rival cartels targeting victims residing in the 
area. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) LEWG discussed with the EAC that the crime wave that 
has hit Tijuana in the last two months is due to a battle 
between organized crime cells.  Reportedly "El Teo" and "El 
Ingeniero" aligned groups are attacking family members of the 
opposing cell as reprisals for prior deaths of group members. 
Local police forces appear to have an attitude of heightened 
alertness, and Post observes more police presence than usual. 
 
¶8.  (U) The recent spike in crime shows no signs of slowing. 
Since the EAC convened, additional drive-by shootings, murders, 
and a beheading have been reported throughout the city, 
including three minor children killed by a La Mesa district 
school on 01/06/10. In the morning of 01/07/10, gunfire erupted 
next to the NIV (visa) Annex building, during a high-speed 
police chase on the adjacent Via Rapida main road.  The exchange 
of gunfire forced one employee's vehicle off the road to avoid 
the shooting.  Although no employees were injured, that main 
route was blocked by the NIV Annex for several hours by the 
crashed suspects' car and police investigation.  At the same 
time, a separate police checkpoint near Mission residences 
impeded access to that neighborhood near the Main Consulate 
building. In the last 24 hours, several kidnappings have also 
been reported nearby, including Tijuana Labor Secretary Josi 
Agustin Caldersn.  The Labor Secretary and spouse were kidnapped 
from their home by an armed group dressed in police commando 
type clothing, but were released late last night under unknown

circumstances. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The EAC recommended Post personnel be advised of the 
situation. By security notice, RSO informed staff of the 
incidents and reminded all staff that Tijuana is rated as 
"critical" for crime by the Department of State Security 
Environment Threat List (SETL). The security notice reminded 
that everyone should always be aware of their surroundings, 
avoid conflict areas, vary routes, and practice good security 
measures. All post personnel had attended mandatory crime 
awareness and car-jacking avoidance training on 03/25/09 
coordinated by RSO and provided by DS Mobile Security Training 
team (DS/MSD). RSO in-briefing relays this information to new 
arrivals to Post.  RSO recommended to EAC that adult family 
members should attend mandatory security in-briefing along with 
newly posted officers. The training was relayed to local 
contract guards and mobile patrol also by RSO and included in 
their procedures. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Tijuana's EAC will continue to monitor the any 
developments.   RSO and Post's law enforcement representatives 
(LEWG) plan to monitor local contact information and local law 
enforcement counterparts for sharing of any future crime or 
threat information. For comments or questions, please contact 
RSO at 011-52-664-622-7464.
