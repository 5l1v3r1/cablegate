REF: REF: STATE 20468 
 
Per reftel, Trade, Agriculture and Foreign Ministries have 
been apprised of U.S. concerns regarding the proposed wood 
packaging materials directive.  On 2/8/05, EconCouns and 
EconOff met with Secretary General for Foreign Trade 
(Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade) Alfredo Bonet 
Baiget and Subdirector General for EU Trade Policy Nicolas 
Lopez Lopez (Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade) and 
discussed the proposed directive.  They said that they had 
been in contact with the Ministry of Agriculture, and that 
the GOS supports the EU directive.  Spain does not consider 
it to be unnecessarily trade restrictive and a technical 
barrier to trade.  Bonet cited Australia as a country that 
already has a debarking requirement.  However, Spain is 
willing to consider the "timing" of the directive.  Charge 
will be meeting with the Spanish Minister of Agriculture on 
2/10/05 who will likely confirm the GOS position and 
elaborate upon it.
