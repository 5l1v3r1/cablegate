Â¶1. (SBU) KEY POINTS 
 
--Over the past year, the USG has worked with GOE interlocutors to conclude an Inflight Security Officers agreement with Egypt. The agreement, once finalized, will allow armed U.S. Federal Air Marshals to travel on board U.S. flights to and from Egypt. --The Egyptian Ministry of Interior, the Civil Aviation Authority, and Egyptair provided Econoff, via interlocutors at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with their concerns regarding the current draft MOU, which include relinquishment of the Air Marshals' firearms upon entry into Egypt, reciprocal treatment of Egyptian inflight security officers, and command authority over the Air Marshals. --Embassy Cairo has requested a new round of meetings with GOE officials to discuss the GOE's concerns and move forward with the agreement. ---------- BACKGROUND ----------

2.(SBU) The USG is seeking to conclude an Inflight Security Officers (IFSO) agreement with the GOE to allow armed U.S. Federal Air Marshals to travel on board flights between the U.S. and Egypt (reftel). Over the past year, attorneys from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) met with GOE offiials to discuss each side's concerns with the curent draft IFSO Memorandum of Understanding. Inrecent months, the GOE has been unresponsive to UG requests for an update on the MOU's status. Rcently, MFA North American Division attorney Salma Atef conveyed to Econoff the GOE's interagency cncerns regarding the MOU. ------------------------------ GOE issues with the current MOU ------------------------------

3.(SBU) Atef said he Ministry of Interior is concerned with the curent MOU's language on the requirements for the Ai Marshals to deposit their firearms. The draft areement calls for the Air Marshals to leave theirfirearms upon arrival in a secured facility at te airport. MOI has requested the USG provide laguage that clearly states the exact procedure for the Air Marshals' relinquishing of their firearms It also wants an article added that would allow Egypt to send armed Egyptian air marshals on boad Egyptair flights going to the United States. astly, the MOI wants further clarity on the type of firearms and ammunition that would be carried y the Air Marshals.

4.(SBU) Egyptair wants to make sure that the IFSO agreement only applies t U.S. carriers. It does not want armed U.S. AirMarshals on Egyptair flights, unless a specific theat to that flight has been identified.

5.(SU) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is seeking an additional article stating that the Air Marshalsfall under the authority of the aircraft's commader (i.e. the captain). The CAA also wants bothU.S. and Egyptian firearm laws to apply to the Ar Marshals. ---------- Next Steps ----------

6.(SBU) Econoff and TSA's Amman-based field reresentative are seeking meetings with the relevat GOE agencies to discuss the current MOU impass. Embassy Cairo has requested that the MFA coordinate an interagency meeting with Econoff and TSA attorneys in mid-July. We will continue to report on substantive developments. SCOBEY
