We delivered ref A demarche and points October 25 to Turkish 
MFA Americas Department Head Onder.  In addition, we provided 
Onder a copy of Vladimiro Roca's October 7 open letter to 
Spanish PM Zapatero stressing the importance of the EU Common 
Policy for Cuba's democratic activists.  We added ref B's 
point that the Spanish Ambassador's speech had hurt Cuba's 
democratic opposition.  Onder made no substantive reply, but 
undertook to convey our message to senior levels of the MFA.
