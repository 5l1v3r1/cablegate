                  JOINT STATEMENT NUMBER 39 
 
         ON FIRST STAGES OF SS-25 ICBMs BURNED WITHOUT 
                       NOZZLES ATTACHED 
 
     The Parties, referring to the Treaty Between the United 
States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms 
of July 31, 1991, hereinafter referred to as the Treaty, 
understand that, during data update inspections or conversion 
or elimination inspections, first stages of SS-25 ICBMs that 
have had their end domes burned out as a result of having had 
fuel removed by burning the stages without their nozzles 
attached, may be located at conversion or elimination 
facilities of ICBMs. 
 
     The Parties understand that the photographs of the first 
stage of an SS-25 ICBM, burned without nozzle attached, and 
declared data on the length of such a first stage, which were 
provided to the other Parties by the Russian Federation at 
JCIC-XXVII, may be used by the inspecting Party during data 
update inspections or conversion or elimination inspections 
only for the purpose of confirming this type of ICBM at 
conversion or elimination facilities of ICBMs. 
 
     The Parties understand that the 6.5 meter length of the 
first stage of the SS-25 ICBM, burned without nozzle 
attached, declared for such first stages, is the distance 
between the extreme points of the cylindrical portion of the 
motor case of that stage, without taking into account 
protruding elements attached to the motor case. 
 
     The Parties understand that no later than five days 
after entry into force of this Joint Statement, the Russian 
Federation will provide texts of footnotes specifying the 
length declared for the first stage of an SS-25 ICBM, burned 
without nozzle attached, in a notification provided in 
accordance with paragraph 3 of Section I of the Protocol on 
Notifications Relating to the Treaty.  In this connection, 
the respective numbers of the footnotes will be superscripted 
after the first mention of the first stage length for the 
SS-25 ICBM in subparagraph (a)(i) of Annex F to the 
Memorandum of Understanding on the Establishment of the Data 
Base Relating to the Treaty. 
 
     The Parties agree that the inspecting Party shall have 
the right during data update inspections or conversion or 
elimination inspections to confirm the type of ICBM by 
external viewing and by measurement of the dimensions of a 
first stage of an SS-25 ICBM, burned without nozzle attached.
