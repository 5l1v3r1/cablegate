     ¶B. SAN JOSE 299 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to Ref A, and further to Ref B, the MFA 
informed us on April 16 by diplomatic 
note of the GOCR's intention to support the USG's candidacy 
for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the period of 
2009-2012. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: GOCR officials have previously urged the 
USG to consider running for a seat on the Council, stating 
that it would add balance to the Council's membership.  As 
such, Costa Rica's support is a welcome example of the GOCR 
walking it's talk on this UN issue.
