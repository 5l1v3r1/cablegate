¶1.  (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In response to reftel, between January 7 and 8, 
USUN-Rome contacted World Food Program (WFP) Deputy Executive 
Director (DED) Amir Abdulla to obtain the latest pipeline 
information on WFP Protracted Relief and Recovery Operations 
(PRROs) in Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti.  Following is a summary: 
 
A) Kenya PRRO 102583:  With the exception of a slight cereals 
shortfall, WFP reports full pipelines for cereals pulses, 
corn-soy blend (CSB) and oils through July. Current shortfall 
includes an outstanding advance of 11,000 MT, $10.55 million in 
the six-month period February-July 2010, which WFP expects to be 
able to cover. 
 
The relocation of 13,000 refugees from Dadaab to Kakuma was 
completed in October 2009.  Since the beginning of January 2010, 
Dadaab has registered more than 59,000 new arrivals, of which 
53,000 are from Somalia.  New arrival trends from Somalia have 
decreased probably due to heavy rains, rendering the roads 
impassable.  With the suspension of WFP programs in areas of 
Somalia controlled by the Al-Shabaab, a new wave of refugees is 
expected possibly over the next 3-4 weeks.  There is urgent need 
for additional storage and food stocks at the Dadaab refugee 
camps. 
 
WFP stressed that, if there is an increased Somali refugee 
influx into Kenya, a projected worst case scenario of 141,000 
additional Somali refugees will result in a total shortfall of 
25,531 MT, $23.84 million in the six-month period February-July 
¶2010. 
 
B) Ethiopia PRRO 101273: Cereals, pulses and blended foods will 
be required in the coming months. The current shortfall is 
estimated at 715 MT, $537,438 in the six-month period 
February-July 2010. 
 
WFP stressed that, if there is an increased Somali refugee 
influx into Ethiopia, it would not begin for possibly another 
3-4 weeks and an estimated worst case scenario of 50,000 
additional Somali refugees would result in a total shortfall of 
7,196 MT, $6.05 million in the six-month period February-July 
¶2010. 
 
C) Djibouti PRRO 105441:  WFP reports a healthy pipeline for 
cereals, pulses and oil through July 2010, with a total 
shortfall of 449 MT, $457,086.  However, funds are urgently 
required for the purchase of CSB and salt. Serious pipeline 
breaks will start in the second half of the year. 
 
WFP stressed that, if there is an increased Somali refugee 
influx into Djibouti, it would not begin for possibly another 
3-4 weeks and an estimated worst case scenario of 30,000 
additional Somali refugees would result in a total shortfall of 
3,419 MT, $2.98 million in the six-month period February-July 
¶2010. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) DED Abdulla also transmitted a detailed Excel 
spreadsheet summarizing the pipeline info for all three 
countries for CY 2010.  Spreadsheet has been forward to 
State/PRM (Janet Deutsch), USAID/FFP (Rachel Grant and Pete 
Mohan) and State/AF (Matt Walsh). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On separate issues, DED Abdulla also reported that, as 
of January 8: 
 
-- WFP is currently in the process of clarifying a 
misunderstanding by the TFG, which believes WFP will suspend 
operations in Mogadishu (TFG authorities erroneously 
misinterpreted the "operational pause" which went into effect on 
January 1 to also include the capital); 
 
-- A major Somali national newspaper has run a drawing depicting 
a hand draped in the WFP flag attempting to deliver a plate of 
food to a malnourished Somali, but the hand is being blocked by 
a militant in Al-Shabaab garb wielding a Kalishnikov and 
questioning, "Why do you care about these people?"  (He believes 
 
UN ROME 00000001  002 OF 002 
 
 
this provocative image may rile up locals against the actions of 
Al-Shabaab.); and 
 
-- WFP and UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will 
jointly lead a regional contingency planning exercise during the 
week of January 25 (TBC).
