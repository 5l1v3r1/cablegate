REF: KIGALI 652 
 
¶1.  (SBU)   In conversation with our DATT on September 30, 
Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) J4 General Patrick Nyamvumba said 
the UN Pre-Deployment Visit (PDV) team noted in reftel will 
now arrive on October 8 for a three day final assessment of 
Rwanda's readiness to deploy to Darfur (other PDVs may be 
conducted by UN personnel in the coming months).  Of the 78 
APCs ordered from China (vice 58 in reftel), Nyamvumba said 
that 20 are due to arrive at the end of October, with the 
remaining APCs due to arrive in mid-December to mid-January. 
Trucks and medical gear on order from the Dutch are scheduled 
to arrive mid-October, said Nyamvumba.  Nyamvumba has 
communicated weights and dimensions of all Darfur 
peacekeeping equipment to the requisite UN offices to assist 
in planning for possible airlift. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) DATT informally discussed with Nyamvumba the 
Rwandan requirements for airlift, and Nayamvumba shared with 
DATT the load list for such an effort.  As in previous 
discussions with Mission personnel, Nyamvumba expressed his 
government's concern regarding delay and loss of equipment on 
land and sea routes to Darfur, should airlift of men and 
equipment directly to Darfur not be possible.
