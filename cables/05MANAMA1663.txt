Dear Mr. Bush: 
 
Thank you for your letter of 4 November, 2005 and for your 
decision to delegate Secretary of State Rice as your envoy to 
discuss issues relating to the combating of terrorism and 
extremism, both in the Middle East and worldwide. 
 
Our discussions with Secretary Rice, on the sidelines of the 
Forum for the Future meeting in Bahrain, were extremely 
productive and informative, and undoubtedly have helped to 
develop further the cooperation and understanding between our 
two countries on this vital issue.  Bahrain looks forward to 
building upon its historic ties of friendship and trust with 
the United States, in order to agree common strategies to 
overcome the urgent global challenges of extremism and 
terrorism. 
 
In this regard, we greatly welcome your continued close 
personal involvement in the Middle East, and your efforts to 
achieve peace and promote freedom, understanding, and 
comprehensive development throughout the region.  We will 
continue to work with the United States to promote and 
achieve these goals, which will benefit the countries and 
peoples of the region, as well as the international community 
as whole. 
 
In thanking you once again for your letter, and in renewing 
the appreciation for our meeting with, Secretary Rice, may I 
also extend my personal best wishes to you, Mr. President, to 
your family, and for further progress and prosperity to the 
friendly American people. 
 
Hamad Bin Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa 
King of Bahrain 
 
His Excellency 
The Hon George W. Bush 
President of the United States of America 
Washington, DC
