REF: PRETORIA 546 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (U) The South African power utility Eskom reduced its 
supply of electricity to Zimbabwe during January, according 
to February 6-8 South African press reports.  Eskom spokesman 
Fani Zulu said that the power utility provided less power 
than required to Zimbabwe because of planned "maintenance 
outages" at generation plants.  Zulu claimed that the 
maintenance work was normal this time of year, and that it 
simply took longer than expected to bring the plants back on 
line.  South Africa has resumed providing the requested 
amount of power to Zimbabwe, Zulu said. 
 
¶2. (U) The Eskom press story followed a similar report in the 
February 5 The Sunday Independent, claiming that the South 
African Department of Minerals and Energy sent a circular to 
South African fuel companies urging them to cease supplies 
fuel to Zimbabwe.  The circular supposedly cited "refining 
issues" as the reason for the cut-off.  Department 
spokesperson Yvonne Mfolo denied that the Department sent any 
circular, as did the South African Petroleum Industry 
Association. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The press reports about cuts in South 
Africa's supply of fuel and electricity to Zimbabwe have 
sparked speculation in South Africa that the SAG is sending a 
subtle political message to the Government of Zimbabwe to 
reform or risk the consequences.  While South Africa is 
increasingly concerned about the economic decline in Zimbabwe 
and frustrated by the failure of their loan and 
constitutional initiatives to bring change (reftel), we have 
no evidence that the electricity cuts were politically 
motiviated.  End Comment.
