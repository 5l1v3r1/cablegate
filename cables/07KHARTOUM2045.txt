SUBJECT: CEASEFIRE COMMISSION UNDER UNAMID - LONGTERM PROSPECTS FOR 
IMPROVEMENT 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 1957 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Ceasefire Commission (CFC) needs reform and 
the impending transfer of authority from AMIS to UNAMID provides the 
opportunity for needed change.  However, significant improvement in 
CFC operations, which should result in better monitoring and 
implementation of the ceasefire, is six months to a year away. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The CFC is currently ineffectual and suffers from the 
signatories' refusal to allow AMIS freedom of movement.  Currently 
the signatories require party rep presence on all patrols.  It is 
also ineffective because of: 1) AMIS reluctance to investigate 
ceasefire violations robustly; 2) the splintering of the rebel 
movements and proliferation of party reps at the sector and 
sub-sector level; 3) CFC's striving for consensus for its violation 
reports to the Joint Commission; and 4) the movements' reliance upon 
Mission Subsistence Allowance (MSA).  Everyone agrees the CFC is 
broken, but a fix has yet to be found. 
 
¶3. (SBU) CFC Chair and AMIS/UNAMID Force Commander GEN Agwai 
recently proposed several changes to improve CFC operations and 
effectiveness under UNAMID.  He suggests consolidating signatories 
and non-signatories into one chamber (vice two currently) and 
reducing the number of reps to one per party.  He further proposes 
that CFC reps be stationed only at the CFC headquarters in El 
Fasher.  In addition, he recommends that MSA and all other support 
to the party reps be halted, including AMIS/UNAMID ID cards, sleeve 
badges or berets, vehicles, computers, cell phones, food and 
lodging. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Reacting to Agwai's proposals, GoS Advisor to President 
Bashir, Nafi Ali Nafi, reportedly told Joint Special Representative 
(JSR) Rodolphe Adada during a meeting on December 17 that: 
 
- The GoS does not object to stopping MSA payments under UNAMID, but 
insists upon the continuation of the CFC as a body; 
 
- Any change in the composition of the CFC, even limiting it to HQ, 
would require a review of the DPA.  The GoS does not agree to limit 
the CFC just to the HQ level in El Fasher and believes CFC reps 
should be present at all team sites; and 
 
- The GoS wants the "Second Chamber" of the CFC for non-signatories 
closed.  (NOTE: The GOS also continues to oppose non-signatory 
participation in the "First Chamber"). 
 
¶5. (SBU) JSR Adada stated that UNAMID will not pay "one penny" to 
any CFC member nor provide cars, phones or other equipment.  He said 
that Force Commander Agwai will soon convene a CFC meeting to 
discuss the other issues and would then follow up with GoS General 
Mohammad Dabi.  Adada also promised to call a Joint Commission 
meeting to discuss the future of the CFC under UNAMID. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Note:  The CFC's "founding" documents (the N'Djamena 
Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement and the Addis Ababa Agreement on 
the Modalities for Establishment of the CFC and DPA) highlight that 
it is supposed to have two party reps at CFC HQ and two liaison 
officers per party at the Ceasefire Sub-Commission in each Sector. 
There is no mention of reps at the sub-sector level.  There is also 
no requirement for the MSA.  The Addis Agreement, however, says 
"Observers participating in the monitoring, investigation and 
verification exercise, as well as members of the CFC, shall be 
funded through the budget of the CFC."  Consensus on CFC reports is 
not needed and party reps do not have to participate in CFC 
investigations.  The Joint Commission later created the "Second 
Chamber" to inlVe!non-ricnatorusin0v(e#CBC(prg#uss aNd`prvlb$
