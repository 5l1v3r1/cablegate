Econoff delivered reftel points on February 21 to Antonio 
Morreno-Torres, International Affairs Advisor, who will 
review them with Ignasi Nieto, Secretary General of Energy in 
the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade.  Post has not 
yet received a formal response from the Secretary General or 
the GOS, but we expect the Spanish to support the inclusion 
of China and India in the IEA.  Post also confirmed that all 
IEA issues are managed by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism 
and Trade and not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Post will 
forward the GOS' formal response once received.
