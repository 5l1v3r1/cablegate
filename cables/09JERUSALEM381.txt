------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with photos of Secretary Clinton and Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Abbas warmly shaking hands at their March 4 
meeting in Ramallah.  Papers report that the two leaders had, 
"comprehensive discussions."  The dailies extensively report on 
Clintons' and Abbas' remarks from the joint press conference. 
Headlines highlight agreement by the U.S. and PA over support for 
the two-state solution and President Abbas' remarks opposing Israeli 
settlement policies.  In response to Clinton's remarks that the U.S. 
will not deal with Hamas until they meet Middle East Quartet 
conditions, Hamas spokesperson Taher Al Non told the press that the 
U.S. has not changed its policies and remains biased towards 
Israel. 
 
All front pages report that Secretary Clinton met with Palestinian 
Authority Premier Fayyad in Ramallah on March 4.  In discussions, 
Fayyad demanded a halt to Israeli settlement activities while 
Clinton expressed appreciation for the achievements of the 
Palestinian government, according to coverage.  Clinton also visited 
AMIDEAST in Ramallah, front pages report, where she met with 
Palestinian youths and gave interviews to young Palestinian media 
broadcasters.  Papers highlight that the Secretary also unveiled 
plans to continue funding for the "YES" exchange program and 
increase funding for other educational exchanges, including programs 
for undergraduate Palestinian students. 
Al Ayyam's front page runs statements by Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas responding to Iranian statements calling for a 
Palestinian revolution and resistance against Israel.  Abbas is 
quoted asking Iran, "to mind its own business," and not interfere in 
Palestinian affairs.  All papers quote Secretary Clinton telling 
journalists aboard her plane en route to Brussels that the Iranian 
statements are "flagrant interference" in Palestinian affairs. 
Al Quds' front page quotes Chief Palestinian Authority Negotiator 
Ahmad Quray stating that negotiations with Israel remain on hold 
until there is "substantial change" to Israeli policies.  Meanwhile 
all front pages run AFP coverage about a report in British Lancet 
medical magazine claiming that the health of Palestinians living in 
the Palestinian Territories has deteriorated due to Israeli 
restrictions. 
Demolitions orders are again front page news in Al Quds.  The paper 
reports that the Israeli military on March 4 ordered the demolition 
of 20 Palestinian houses and agricultural structures in Aqraba 
village near Nablus in the West Bank.  In a separate front page 
article, the paper reports that an Israeli Jerusalem municipal court 
issued a stay on demolition orders of houses in East Jerusalem's Ras 
Khmais area on March 4.  The order expires in 72 hours, papers note. 
 
Al Ayyam's front page reports that a young Palestinian sustained 
serious injuries when he "wrestled with" Israeli soldiers who were 
"torturing" his 55-year old father near the West Bank Bita village 
in Nablus district. 
The three papers report that an Israeli military air strike on a 
Palestinian car near Jabaliyah in Gaza killed a senior Islamic Jihad 
militant on March 4.  Israeli air strikes also targeted smuggling 
tunnels near the Gaza-Egypt borders on March 4, papers 
report.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1)  Taysir Zabiri opines in Al Quds under the title, "Parallel lines 
- one solution"(03/05):  "If Palestinian national agreement and a 
united Arab stand were realized, and if international, economic and 
political support [for Palestinians] continued, the incoming Israeli 
 
JERUSALEM 00000381  002 OF 002 
 
 
extreme right government [would find itself increasingly isolated] 
and its expansion plans that violate Palestinian rights, would be 
foiled." 
 
2)  Talal Okal writes in Al Ayyam under the title, "What was absent 
from the Sharm El-Sheikh conference"(03/05):  "He is mistaken who 
bets on Washington being able to "change" Israeli policy [towards 
Palestinians]...  The conference should have addressed issues 
related to Israel, including guarantees to facilitate Gaza 
reconstruction.  Then we could believe that there is some integrity 
and sense of justice in the international community."
