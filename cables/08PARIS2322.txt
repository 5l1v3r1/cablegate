(SBU) IO DAS-Equivalent Fabien Penone reiterated French 
support for the Somalia Piracy Contact Group and plans for a 
January meeting in New York.  He stated that Anti-Piracy 
Coordinator Ambassador Chantal Poiret was already in direct 
communication with A/S Kimmitt about the proposed 13-14 
January meetings.  The level of French participation at this 
point was unclear.  With regard to the agenda, Penone 
commented to poloff that mobilizing the international 
community remained the key objective, with pre-cooking an 
action plan of less consequence.
