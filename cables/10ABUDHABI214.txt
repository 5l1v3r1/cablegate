¶1. (SBU) On January 10, visiting SRAP Special Advisor for 
International Partnership Jarrett Blanc and EconOff met with Acting 
Director General of the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) 
Mohammed Saif Al Suwaidi to discuss UAE aid for Afghanistan.  Al 
Suwaidi explained that the ADFD currently has four projects planned 
for Afghanistan, in response to GOA requests: 
 
 
 
-   The first is for Kabul roads, part of a $30 million grant 
announced in 2002.  Three projects for 18 km of roads is being 
funded, with four other roads under consideration. 
 
-   The second is a $15m project with Germany to fund work at the 
Mazar-e-Sharif airport. 
 
-   The third project is a Shahtoot dam project near Kabul, which 
will focus on drinking water, irrigation and recharging ground 
water. 
 
-   The fourth project would utilize the UAE's remaining $235m 
pledge to build 7,000 housing units in Kabul, in cooperation with 
the Urban Development Ministry.  This project is facing planning 
and implementation challenges, and ADFD may be open to alternatives 
for disbursing this portion of the pledge.
