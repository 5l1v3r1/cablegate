SUBJECT: MOROCCAN RESPONSE TO THE CONVENTION ON 
SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION FOR NUCLEAR DAMAGE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 54213 
 
(SBU)  On May 23, Econoff met with Bouchaib El Oumni, Office 
of International Organizations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
to discuss reftel and to deliver a copy of the U.S. non-paper 
concerning the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for 
Nuclear Damage (CSC).  El Oumni was well familiar with CSC, 
having just come from the Moroccan Mission in Vienna.  He 
noted that Morocco had already ratified CSC, saw no reason to 
expect less than full Moroccan support in urging other 
nations to do the same, and pledged to share the U.S. 
non-paper with other responsible government offices.
