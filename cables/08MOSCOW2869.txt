¶3. On September 25, 2008, Export Control Attach Peter 
Liston and ICE LES Sergey Kishkimski conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with JSC Novo, 
Dubki Street 6, Moscow, Russia. The export control 
team met with Vladimir Filippovsky, President, and 
Andrey Kaznin, Commercial Director. 
 
¶4. Novo Corporation was established circa 1992 and was 
founded by former Soviet officials of State owned 
institutions.  Novo Corporation is located in a stand- 
alone two-story office building that house their 
production facility, administrative offices and sales 
department.  Novo Corporation has 50 employees and 
manufactures police and security electronics such as 
detection equipment, x-ray, and metal detectors.  Novo 
Corporation attends international security and police 
trade shows as an exhibitor and has established an 
export branch within their sales department. 
 
¶5. The Export Control Attach office provided a copy 
of the Commercial Invoice of the commodities for 
subject cable to Novo Corporation one day before the 
PSV because Novo indicated that they do not believe 
that they had been in receipt of any commodities that 
would warrant the visit from the ECO.  During the PSV 
visit to Novo, Vladimir Filippovsky explained to the 
ECO that he carefully reviewed the Commercial Invoice 
with his Commercial Director and only found one line 
item, the eleven (11) I.C., Div 2 Prescaler, part no. 
8542.39.0000, that Novo purchased.  Vladimir 
Filippovsky stated that Novo Corporation has a long 
and respected history with the Intermediate Consignee 
Radiant-Elcon LTD, and stated that it is possible that 
Radiant made the purchase and stocked the remaining 
line items, and are waiting for additional orders from 
Novo in the future. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends Novo Corporation, 
Dubki Street 6, Moscow, Russia as reliable recipients 
of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
