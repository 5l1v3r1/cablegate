¶1. (SBU) We met April 30 with Dr. Mona Mehrez, director of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation's (MALR's) Animal 
Health Research Institute today.  Mehrez confirmed Egypt's mass pig 
slaughtering operation began in earnest April 30.  MALR teams are 
doing the killing.  The goal is no pigs in Egypt within a month. 
New "clean" pig farms may be permitted in the future. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MALR teams began testing pigs for flu before the slaughter 
began and they are taking samples as the culling continues; so far, 
no H5N1 and no H1N1. 
 
¶3. (SBU) MALR's surveillance teams continue to find H5N1-infected 
birds in the live bird markets and on commercial farms around the 
country.  There have been two serious outbreaks this month in the 
commercial sector: in Kalubia and Sharkia involving 44,000 breeders 
and 4,000 layers,  respectively.
