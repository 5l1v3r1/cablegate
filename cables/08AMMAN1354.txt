¶1. Amman believes that an Op-Ed authored by a senior USG official 
which details the human rights situation in Cuba and the plight of 
Cuban refugees would be the most effective way to commemorate the 
Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People in Jordan.  Post will work 
to gain the widest possible placement of such an Op-Ed in the 
Jordanian press.  Post requests that IIP inform us if any Op-Ed's 
are already being prepared, and seeks to get a text at least one 
week in  advance in order to prepare an accurate translation into 
Arabic. 
 
¶2. Post will also be in touch with the Office of Commerce Secretary 
(and Co-Chair of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba) 
Gutierrez to inquire whether his office will be issuing suitable 
materials for placement. 
 
¶3.  Embassy Amman POC is PAO Phil Frayne.
