¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, JSC 
Kashirsky Electrical Network, Kashira, Moscow, Russia. 
The company is listed on BIS license application

model: 1100. These items are controlled for national 
security, nuclear non-proliferation reasons under ECCN 
6A003. The licensee is Mikron Infrared, Inc., 16

¶3. On January 18, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of JSC 
Kashirsky Electrical Network (KEN), 4 Klubnaya St., 
Kashira, Moskovsky Oblast, Russia. The export control 
team met with Mikhail Knyazkov, Chief Engineer. 
 
¶4. KEN was founded 45 years ago to provide electrical 
generation and delivery services to the Kashirsky 
district.  Today KEN has 27 substations serving three 
districts in the southwest part of the Moskovsky 
Oblast.  KEN was a daughter company of Mosenergo, 
which is currently undergoing a major restructuring. 
KEN currently operates as an independent organization. 
The company is headquartered just outside of the 
Kashira city center at the Kashirsky Electrical 
Generation Plant, and employs around 500. 
 
¶5. The thermal imager in reftel will be utilized for 
preventative maintenance of electrical equipment and 
to check thermal insulation at plant facilities. 
There is one specialist trained in the use of thermal 
imagery, who is assigned to the Isolation and Defense 
From Overpowering Service of KEN.  The specialist is 
currently using an AZOT Thermal Imager, and Mr. 
Knyazkov showed the team some of the reports generated 
from imagery taken with the AZOT.  When not in use the 
device will be stored in a safe located in the 
technical building on the plant grounds.  The plant is 
protected at all times by an armed guard force and an 
electronic security system.  Mr. Knyazkov is aware of 
export controls, and acknowledged that the item was 
not for resale or transfer.  Mr. Knyazkov added that 
he understands the concerns of the USG regarding 
transfers to "Iran and such countries." 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC Kashirsky 
Electrical Network, Kashira, Moscow, Russia, as 
reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities. It is requested that post be notified of 
final disposition of the application, and of any 
shipments for this organization in order to conduct 
appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical reporting.
