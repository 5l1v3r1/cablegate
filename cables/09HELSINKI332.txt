¶1. Econoff delivered reftel points to Matti Aho Director 
General for the Department of Food and Health at the Ministry 
of Forestry and Agriculture.  Aho noted that Finland had 
received no imports of US soy products containing dust from 
biotech corn MON88017, and therefore had no reports of 
voluntary suspensions of US soy imports. 
 
¶2.  Aho added that this issue might be discussed at the 
September 7 European Union (EU) Agricultural Council meeting, 
but any vote to approve or deny the use of MON88017 in the EU 
would take place at a later date.  When the Council 
eventually votes on MON88017, Aho predicted that there would 
be no clear majority and that the issue would return to the 
European Commission for review. 
 
¶3. Aho acknowledged the importance of this issue to US 
agricultural interests.    Finland supports approval of 
MON88017 and has asked the EC to draft new legislation to 
allow small quantities (maximum .1%) of non-approved biotech 
products to be imported as long as the products have been 
positively assessed by the European Food and Safety 
Authority.
