SUBJECT: Georgia seeks Latin American allies on territorial integrity 
 
¶1.  (SBU) As part of its campaign to prevent additional Latin 
American countries from recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia, a 
delegation from Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs visited Costa 
Rica November 16-18.  MFA Head of the Americas Department Otar 
Berdzenishvili told us that Georgia was reaching out to Latin 
American countries, because Russia had been working hard to 
persuade them to recognize the break-away regions.  He said his 
delegation had made its case to representatives from the UN 
missions of 14 Latin American countries in New York the week of 
November 8.  They were now visiting Costa Rica, Argentina, and 
Cuba, and they hoped to visit other Latin American countries in the 
coming months.  As part of its efforts to engage with Latin 
America, Berdzenishvili reported that Georgia planned to open an 
embassy in Brazil and establish some sort of diplomatic 
representation elsewhere in Latin America. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Berdzenishvili said Georgia was confident of Costa Rica's 
support for its territorial integrity, commenting that the Costa 
Rican ambassador to the UN had spoken passionately on Georgia's 
behalf two years ago.  They were visiting Costa Rica at this time 
simply for scheduling reasons; the GOCR was available to receive 
them, while other Latin American governments had their calendars 
full.  That said, since Georgia does not have a presence here, he 
requested that the U.S. embassy help keep Georgia on the mind of 
the GOCR after the visit. 
 
¶3.  (U) During the visit, Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Alexander Nalbandov and Costa Rican Deputy Foreign Minister Edgar 
Ugalde signed a memorandum of understanding that provides a legal 
basis for political consultations in bilateral and multilateral 
fora.  According to Costa Rican MFA Political Director Alejandro 
Solano, Costa Rica has MOUs of this nature with 70 countries.  The 
Georgian delegation also met with Costa Rica's trade promotion and 
tourism ministries in hopes of expanding contact in both areas.
