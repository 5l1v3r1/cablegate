REF: BARCELONA 32 
 
Post received on August 5 a faxed diplomatic note from 
Andorra's foreign ministry asking us to forward a letter from 
Andorran Finance Minister Pere Lopez Agras to Treasury 
Secretary Geithner regarding the GOA's interest in starting 
Tax Information Exchange Agreement(TIEA) negotiations.  The 
letter contains an offer to send an Andorran delegation to 
the U.S. in September and asks for a point of contact.  Full 
text of the (English-language) letter follows: 
 
Andorra la Vella, 30 July 2009 
 
Excellency, 
 
I am pleased to inform you hereby that the Principality of 
Andorra signed on 10 March 2009 a unilateral statement 
declaring the will of the Government of Andorra to adapt to 
OECD standards for the exchange of information relating to 
tax matters. 
 
In this sense allow me to express the interest of my 
Government to initiate negotiations for the signing of an 
agreement for the exchange of information relating to tax 
matters between the Principality of Andorra and the United 
States of America. 
 
However considering the Andorran legislative elections took 
place last 26 April and the new Government was set up last 7 
June, during the first week of September the Consell General 
that is our Parliament will examine the bill modifying 
regulations on bank secrecy currently in force. 
 
As soon as the appropriate legislative modifications are 
done, we will be able to commence formal negotiations of 
agreements for the exchange of information relating to tax 
matters with several countries. 
 
Therefore if this proposal is of your interest, an Andorran 
delegation will be willing to travel to your country in 
September.  In order to begin talks formally, I would be 
grateful if you could provide me with the contact details of 
the person from your Cabinet who is in charge of these 
matters so as Mr. Marc Juan (marc juan@govern.ad; tel: 
00376875700) from my Ministry contacts him/her. 
 
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
/ s / 
Pere Lopez Agras 
Minister of Finance
