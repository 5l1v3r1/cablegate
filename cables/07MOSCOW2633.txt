SUBJECT: RUSSIAN POSITION ON EU AS OBSERVER IN GLOBAL 
INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM 
 
REF: STATE 75227 
 
Â¶1.  (U) On June 4 we contacted Amelia Siderova, in the MFA's 
Department of Security and Disarmament Affairs (DVBR), and 
asked her to clarify (REFTEL) Russia's position on the 
potential participation of the European Union in the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT).  Siderova 
responded unequivocally that Russia's view remains unchanged 
from the agreement reached between U/S Joseph and Deputy 
Foreign Minister Kislyak in Ankara: the EU should be 
considered for observer status only after all 27 EU Member 
States have joined the GICNT.
