SUBJECT:  Darfur:  NRF Press Release Claims Gov't has Transferred 
Chemical Weapons 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On November 1, Sudan Tribune, an online news service, 
posted a press release dated October 1, purportedly from the 
National Redemption Front, a grouping of Darfurian rebels that have 
not signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), claiming that the 
Sudanese Government had transferred chemical weapons to Darfur. 
 
 
¶2. (U) The text of the press release is as follows:

Khartoum Moves New Chemical Weapons into Darfur 
OCTOBER 31, 2006 - The National Redemption Front (NRF) confirms that 
GoS has airlifted new weapons into Darfur. The airlift that took 
place a week ago during the festival of the holy month of Ramadan 
included banned chemical weapons and lethal bombs, described as 
entirely new to Darfur battlefields. 
Rather than seeing this as a new twist, the NRF takes it as 
perfectly in line with Albashir's genocidal policy and war of 
annihilation in Darfur.  Impervious to all International Conventions 
of Engagement, Albashir once publicly ordered his troops "not to 
bring him back any war prisoners or injured enemies" in their 
battles in Darfur.  Khartoum's renegotiation maneuvers are nothing 
but a public relations exercise and a cover up for insidious 
military tactics.  Only a few weeks ago Khartoum's Minister for 
Defense was in Russia procuring new arms for millions of Dollars to 
boost their military adventures in Darfur. 
The NRF assures its constituency that it is monitoring Albashir's 
gamble in Darfur and is ready to teach him, yet, another lesson, 
just as it did in Umsidra and Kari Kari of North Darfur. 
Despite, the NRF affirms to the UN, and the international community 
that Darfur problem is political and that it has no military 
solution as Albashir still foolishly thinks.

¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Embassy Khartoum Defense Liaison Office has no 
information regarding this claim, and does not regard it as 
credible; it more likely appears an effort by the NRF to call 
attention to continued military build-ups by the Sudanese Government 
in Darfur.
