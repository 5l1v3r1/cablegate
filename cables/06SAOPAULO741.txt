¶1. "Fires That The US Dreamed Of Extinguishing Are Multiplying" 
 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo Paris correspondent Giles Lapouge 
underscored (7/7): "The war in Iraq has proved to all unruly, 
rebelling or messianic nations that they will never be safe from the 
US's wrath. The only way to prevent the US from going to war is the 
possession of arms of mass destruction. Since the catastrophe in 
Iraq the nuclear bomb has been seen throughout the Middle East as 
the only protection of weak nations against the US. This is one of 
the reasons for the North Korean missile tests. It is also the 
reason that pushes a more dangerous and fearful nation than North 
Korea, Iran, to develop nuclear weapons against everyone's will.... 
The US is at the limit of its intervention capability.  Not only 
because its troops are exhausted, but because the fires Washington 
dreamed of extinguishing have multiplied and are threatening regions 
that the US thought it could save.... This is how one can explain 
the US's prudence and apathy before the small and ragged North 
Korea. The US seems unable to add to its ruinous expeditions in Iraq 
and Afghanistan an even limited blow against the tiny North Korea." 
 
¶2. "Disturbed Elections" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (7/7) 
editorialized: "The political situation in Mexico continues to be 
confusing after the general elections. The recounting of votes gave 
the victory to government-supported candidate Felipe Calderon by a 
less than one percent advantage over leftist Andres Manuel Lopez 
Obrador, who has made accusations of fraud and promised to question 
the returns in court. It is a scenario that resembles very much 
George W. Bush's disturbed election in 2000.... Obrador has reasons 
to fear fraud.  It was frequent during the 70-year period of PRI's 
(Institutional Revolutionary Party) dominance.... Now, however, 
there has been no apparent massive adulteration of votes. There were 
hundreds of international observers and they did not notice 
suspicious moves. What happened were basic mistakes involving lack 
of transparency by IFE (Federal Electoral Institute). Because of 
such mistakes, the process lost credibility." 
 
¶3. "Mexico's Unstable Transition Towards Democracy" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Economico (7/7) remarked: "Mexico is living 
an unstable transition stage between a septuagenarian dictatorship 
of a single party and a full democracy with strong parties. The 
process began with President Vicente Fox's election in 2000, but is 
experiencing an impasse shown in Felipe Calderon's tight and 
controversial victory.... While the shadows of political gangsterism 
are disappearing from the Mexican political scene, many sensitive 
questions remain. More that 50 million Mexicans live below the 
poverty line near the world's richest nation.... Mexico has a low 
inflation rate, but it is no longer growing. The legion of Mexicans 
crossing the borders looking for jobs - as well as the US increasing 
truculence searching mechanisms to stop them - demonstrates that the 
nation's serious problems were not resolved with Nafta."
