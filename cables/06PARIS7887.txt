 ¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered answers to follow-up questions 
from reftel A. on Cuban and Haitian protected migrants (see 
also reftels B. and C.) on December 8 to Pierre Brethes, MFA 
officer in the Office of Asylum and Immigration.  Brethes 
responded that illegal immigration to France from its 
overseas departments in the western hemisphere was already a 
significant issue and that the GOF did not wish to 
participate at this time in resettling protected migrants 
from the Guantanamo Bay Migrant Operations Center.
