brought to an end."  It also noted Greece's support for the 
Cypriot reunification effort by Republic of Cyprus President

¶2. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF GREEK MFA STATEMENT ON TURKISH CYPRIOT 
UDI: 
 
Announcement regarding the anniversary of the illegal 
declaration of the pseudo-state in northern Cyprus 
 
Twenty-five years ago, the declaration of the pseudo-state in 
the section of Cyprus under Turkish military occupation was 
) and remains ) a provocative illegal action in violation 
of the fundamental rules and principles of international law. 
 
The 15th of November 1983 is a dark date, not only for Cyprus 
and Greece, but also for all those who believe in and respect 
international legality. 
 
The Cyprus problem remains an international issue of the 
foreign, illegal occupation of the territory of an 
independent member state of the international community and 
the European Union. 
 
This unacceptable state of affairs must be brought to an end. 
 This is the purpose of the negotiations taking place at this 
time. 
 
Greece gives its full support to the tireless efforts of the 
President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Christofias, so that 
justice can be restored and the reunification of Cyprus can 
become a reality, with Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots 
enjoying the security and prosperity that comes with 
membership in the European Union.
