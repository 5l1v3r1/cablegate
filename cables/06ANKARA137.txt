¶1.  Summary. Turkish Minister of Agriculture and Rural 
Affairs Eker, in a meeting with Ambassador January 13, 
reported on the progress made in responding to the recent 
outbreak of Avian Influenza in Turkey and agreed to a 
proposed US assessment team visit the week of January 16. 
He appealed for US contributions toward a World Bank- 
recommended package of measures designed to improve Turkey's 
capacities to deal with AI.  Eker emphasized that the AI 
outbreaks here are along migratory bird flyways that cross 
the eastern, central and southern parts of the country and 
that the spread of the disease in poultry is not related to 
trade in birds.  The Minister noted that children in rural 
areas are particularly at risk.  Additional measures need to 
be taken to educate rural families about the risks 
associated with this disease.  Eker claimed the ministry has 
received informal reports of AI outbreaks in Georgia, 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq and Syria, including the 
culling of 50,000 birds in Iran, but he offered no specific 
evidence.  End Summary. 
 
Current Situation 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  Eker said the ministry has confirmed 19 incidents of AI 
in 13 provinces; 31 further incidents are suspected in an 
additional 18 provinces, meaning that AI is confirmed or 
suspected in over one-third of Turkey's 81 provinces.  The 
minister underscored the fact that a single case of AI might 
only be one bird or one backyard farm.  A total of 455,000 
birds have been culled as of January 12.  Eker declined to 
predict the number of birds that may eventually require 
culling, but noted that backyard, domesticated family 
poultry totals an estimated 10 million birds (with 300 
million total in Turkey, including those at commercial 
operations).  Three kilometer quarantine areas have been 
established around each suspected site, and all birds are 
being culled within the quarantine areas.  In addition, 
there is a ten kilometer surveillance zone in which all 
transport is being disinfected and all trade in poultry and 
poultry products forbidden.  Provincial governors are using 
local police and Gendarme to enforce the quarantines. 
 
A Brief History of AI in Turkey 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Eker provided an overview of Turkey's response to the 
October and December AI outbreaks in Turkey and described 
 
ANKARA 00000137  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
the initiatives the government put in place to detect and 
eradicate any incidents of AI.  Prior to the October 
outbreak and after receiving reports of AI in wild birds in 
Russia, the government, in conjunction with the European 
Union, conducted an AI crisis management exercise.  Eker 
said the authorities took very proactive and aggressive 
measures in October and again in mid-December as information 
about further AI outbreaks first appeared.  In October after 
the first outbreak, the GOT began taking samples, 
particularly in lakes where migratory birds were present. 
Over 400 samples of birds and manure were taken as part of 
detection procedures.  Letters were sent to provincial 
offices outlining the precautions that needed to be taken 
for poultry, particularly on small land holdings. 
 
Migratory Birds Cause of Spread 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  The Minister provided evidence that the spread of the 
disease in December and January were due primarily to 
migratory birds and not from the sale of infected poultry. 
He cited several incidents of AI infected dead wild birds in 
different areas of the country including Bitlis, Erzincan, 
Beypazari (near Ankara) and Aydin.  He had maps showing 
known migratory flyways through Turkey and each AI incident. 
In all cases the outbreaks of AI were along migratory 
routes. 
 
Minister: "Commercial Farms Not a Problem 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Eker said the December/January outbreaks of AI in are 
taking place in mostly remote, rural areas among small 
household flocks of small numbers of birds (2-5) kept for 
family use and not significantly traded.  A visit to any 
rural town will show domestic poultry running freely in 
yards and along roadsides.  Given their remote and dispersed 
nature, these family flocks are not sources for spreading AI 
more widely among poultry, but also mean that precautionary 
measures are difficult.  The Minister took pains to 
emphasize that integrated commercial poultry operations are 
not at risk and that meat from these operations is safe. 
(Note:  We have observed that the commercial sector has been 
very active in protecting facilities and educating local 
farmers.  Many companies are providing training and 
initiating their own surveillance of farms near commercial 
operations.  However, despite these actions, poultry 
 
ANKARA 00000137  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
consumption has decreased by 90 percent in recent weeks and 
according to one private sector representative, the industry 
is losing $40 million a month due to the crisis.  End note.) 
 
Children Particularly at Risk 
----------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The Minister noted that government needs to be more 
active in protecting children who are particularly at risk 
to contracting the disease.  Children often have close 
contact with their family flocks.  Eker had met with the 
Dogubayazit family whose children died from AI in early 
January.  The oldest child had slaughtered sick birds and 
the two middle children plucked them.  By contrast, the 
youngest child who had only more casual contact recovered, 
and the parents had not become ill at all.  Recently the GOT 
had sent home information about the disease attached to 
report cards given to the children. 
 
Further Steps 
------------- 
 
¶7.  The Minister stressed that he believes the government is 
taking effective actions and being fully transparent with 
the public and the international community.  He underscored 
the need for the government to take additional steps to help 
educate people and address the economic impact of the 
crisis.  On January 14, a deputy prime minister will meet 
with government and private sector officials in all related 
fields to discuss the crisis and ways to address it.  (Note: 
The Turkish press is reporting that the meeting will 
actually be chaired by Prime Minister Erdogan.  End note.) 
 
¶8.  Eker claimed the ministry had received informal reports 
among all of Turkey's neighbors to the south and east.  He 
said Iran has reportedly culled some 50,000 birds, and 
another country has worked to vaccinate poultry.  When 
pressed, however, he did not provide any evidence of AI in 
these countries. 
 
Request for US Help 
------------------- 
 
¶9.  Eker and his deputy referred to an assessment and 
proposed package of measures developed in late 2005 as part 
of a World Bank initiative that he said was supported by 
AID.  The package identified needed improvements in 
 
ANKARA 00000137  004.2 OF 004 
 
 
laboratory capabilities, diagnostics, training and equipment 
for veterinarians, safety clothing and gear for those 
culling birds, and compensation for peasant farmers.  Turkey 
expected some help will come to support this work via World 
Bank loans and from bilateral donors, and Eker urged that 
the US consider supporting this effort as soon as possible, 
preferably ahead of World Bank loan approval.  (Note: 
Separately, the Turkish press reported January 13 that the 
EU is redirecting 4 million Euros for Turkey's AI efforts 
from already planned EU assistance for Turkey. End note.) 
 
¶10.  Eker also noted that he will be in Beijing for the AI 
conference that begins January 17.  He expressed interest in 
meeting with Ambassador Powell.  A ministry staffer asked 
for help in changing Eker's speaking slot at the conference; 
embassy suggested the Turkish embassy in Beijing may be 
better placed to influence the AI conference program. 
 
U.S. Support 
------------ 
 
¶11.  The Ambassador thanked Eker for the information and 
commended him and the government for their work in 
responding to the crisis.  He underscored the concern and 
sympathy in the United States for the situation in Turkey. 
Ambassador informed Eker that two CDC experts will arrive 
shortly to assist with WHO and FAO work, and he said that an 
interagency USG assessment team plans to visit Turkey and 
possibly the Caucasus beginning o/a January 16 to assess the 
situation, determine where there may be gaps and lessons to 
be learned, and consider the issue of further USG support. 
Any consideration of the World Bank project would flow from 
that visit, he said.  Eker expressed appreciation for the 
assessment team and directed his staff to work with the 
embassy on arrangements for it.
