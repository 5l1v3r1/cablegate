Summary 
------- 
¶1. (S/NF)  The Australian ambassador in Tehran demarched 
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Akhmondzadeh on April 7 on 
behalf of Ms Saberi. Akhomdzadeh, just back from The Hague, 
expressed surprise to learn that Saberi had not yet been 
released. The Australian Embassy believes that the GOI 
indictment of Saberi simply marks the prelimary investigative 
stage, and reflects an internecine conflict within the 
Iranian bureacracy.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) Hugh Jeffrey, Desk Officer in the Middle East 
Section at DFAT,  told Poloff that besides the demarche to 
the Iranian ambassador in Canberra (reftel C), the Australian 
ambassador to Iran Marc Innes-Brown, on April 7 delivered a 
message on behalf of Ms Saberi to the Iranian Deputy Foreign 
Minister for the Asian and Pacific Region, Mr.  Akhmondzadeh. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) The deputy minister told the ambassador that Ms 
Saberi had been released and was somewhat shocked to be 
advised that she was still in custody. He had been at the 
Hague at the recent Afghanistan conference and apparently 
believed that the request from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) would easily influence people in the Interior 
Ministry and Justice. 
 
¶4. (S/NF) Hugh told us that the Iranian government was such a 
nest of fiefdoms that officials are constantly thumbing their 
noses at each other's attempts to accomplish something.  He 
did not think that the MFA was unwilling to have her 
released, quite the contrary; however, people in the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry reminded him that a whiff of gasoline is all 
that is  needed  for an indictment for arson--she had been 
denied press credentials and she had continued to file 
stories with the BBC and NPR. Thus, she was arrested for 
having ignored the clear message from the Interior Ministry. 
Hugh explained that each indictment is actually the 
preliminary step to the investigation, which will 
subsequently determine guilt. If she is not guilty, she has 
nothing to fear, according Iran contacts. 
 
¶5. (S/NF) The final interpretation at DFAT and the embassy in 
Tehran is that the MFA wanted her released, but bureaucrats 
in Justice or Interior required that she run through all of 
their hoops first, as a way of underscoring that no one gets 
out of our jail just because the MFA requested it.
