All front pages carry negative reports about Israeli plans to, 
"renew [Israel's] settlement campaign in Jerusalem."  Al-Quds 
reports that the timing of the "settlement campaign" is meant to 
come just before the June 2 meeting of Palestinian President Abbas 
and Israeli Premier Olmert.  Angry comments by Palestinian Authority 
(PA) officials appear in the dailies:  Palestinian Presidency 
spokesperson Abu Rudaynah states, "This is a real threat to the 
peace process."  Al-Ayyam calls the plans a, "settlement attack on 
Jerusalem."  All dailies quote PLO negotiator Sa'eb Erekat 
announcing that, "settlements, negotiations and the truce will all 
be on the agenda of [the June 2] meeting between Olmert and Abbas." 
 
Violence grabs headlines:  12 Palestinians were injured during a 
protest, "against the wall" in N'ilin village near the West Bank 
city of Ramallah, according to the dailies.  The papers also 
highlight the injuring of three Palestinians and an Israeli soldier 
during an Israeli military operation in Gaza on May 1.  Papers also 
report that Israeli police have, "heightened the security alert" in 
Jerusalem because of activities linked to the Israeli celebration 
of, "Jerusalem day," a national holiday celebrating the 
"reunification" of the city in 1967.  Related coverage highlights an 
"attack" by Israeli authorities on Palestinians gathered in East 
Jerusalem at a June 2 commemoration ceremony for deceased 
Palestinian Authority advisor on Jerusalem affairs, Faisal 
Al-Hussayn. 
 
Front pages devote extensive, positive coverage to the homecoming of 
Lebanese civilian Nassim Nasr on June 1, following his release from 
an Israeli jail.  Nasr served a six-year prison term on charges of 
spying for Hezbollah  Reports note that Palestinian prisoners in 
Israeli jails are encouraged by the action, hoping that a prisoner 
exchange deal may happen soon.  Photos of Lebanese celebrating the 
release also appear on the front pages.

Rabbo confirmed that the appointment of a vice president to the

consideration.

front page headlines.  Al-Quds reports that Hamas denied receiving 
any, "official Israeli response" to a truce proposal.  Hamas also 
announced its readiness to start immediate national talks with Fatah 
and other Palestinian parties.  Meanwhile Hamas repeated its threats 
to end the "siege" on Gaza.  Hamas spokesperson Fawzi Barhoom 
commented that, "the breaking of the siege could come at any moment 
and the world will be caught off guard." At the same time, Hamas 
denied reports that Egyptian authorities would soon reopen the 
Gaza-Egypt Rafah crossing. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page reports that former American diplomats met 
with former Hamas Premier Haniyya in Gaza on June 1.  Al Quds 
carries an inside story.  The stories note the visiting Americans

to Gaza and that they had, "serious and open negotiations," with

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Independent daily Al-Ayyam runs an op-ed by veteran columnist 
Talal Okal entitled, "After Barak... Olmert loses his chance" 
(6/02):  "...Olmert cannot go to Washington and ask for its support 
in the middle of his current crisis unless he achieves some progress 
in his meeting with Palestinian Authority President Abbas... Bush 
showed unlimited support to Israel when he visited to celebrate its 
60th anniversary, which was also a show of [U.S.] support for 
Olmert...  But the question is, can Olmert, who is weak... really 
pull off a historic or significant break-through while he is losing 
the confidence [of everyone] everywhere he goes..." 
 
¶2. Independent daily Al-Ayyam runs an op-ed by veteran columnist 
Samih Shbaib entitled, "Early elections and the contours of the 
Israeli political map!" (6/02): "It is practically an established 
fact that early Israeli elections will take place soon.  As a 
result, political Israeli parties have begun preliminary moves 
towards elections including the Kadima party... we can infer that 
the current state of the Israeli political map, after Olmert's 
scandals and his preliminary surrender, is very tentative and likely 
to change... Israel will experience a string of changing... foreign 
policy.  It will not be able to negotiate neither with the 
Palestinians nor the Syrians.  This situation will be accompanied by 
a frozen U.S. foreign policy until the beginning of next year.  This 
raises very serious questions about how to deal with Palestinian 
negotiations and realign Palestinian national efforts with the 
national interest."
