Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (5-5) by Eliane Catanhede says: 
"[The decision] by Iranian President Ahmadinejad to not come to 
Brazil had a negative result on Brazil as the country made all the 
sacrifices in order to arrange the meeting between Lula and 
Ahmadinejad and ended up having no advantages.  It lost a lot (in 
criticisms) and won nothing." 
 
Iran is not Ahmadinejad 
 
Op-Ed in liberal O Estado de S.Paulo (5-5) by diplomat and former 
Ambassador to the U.S. Roberto Abdenur notes: "The visit of the 
Iranian President to Brazil could not be more 
inappropriate....Bringing Ahmadinejad to Brazil a few weeks before 
the Iranian Presidential election clearly would not demonstrate 
wisdom in political terms.  Seeking rapprochement with Iran in the 
person of Ahmadinejad brings us embarrassment and 
criticism....Brazilian diplomacy would have done well to realize 
that Iran is not necessarily Ahmadinejad." 
 
Mercosul Bolivarian Mercosul 
 
Editorial in liberal O Estado de S.Paulo (5-5) states: "Brazil won't 
gain anything if it lets Venezuela enter Mercosul now .....but it 
may lose a lot if it allows its trade diplomacy to depend on the 
humors and political interests of Alba's (Alternativa Bolivariana 
para as Americas) creator."
