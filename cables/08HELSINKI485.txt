SUBJECT: INVITATION TO THE OSCE MINISTERIAL 
 
Madame Secretary: I encourage you to participate in the OSCE 
Ministerial in early December.  Your participation at this 
pivotal time in Finland's foreign policy development would 
reinforce Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb's argument for 
closer ties with the US and NATO.  By coming to Helsinki, you 
would give our diplomatic efforts a powerful positive 
reinforcement.  I hope to welcome you here in Helsinki in 
early December.  Warmly, Barbara Barrett
