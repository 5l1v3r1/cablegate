SUBJECT: SANT' EGIDIO'S PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT 
CHISSANO ON ZIMBABWE 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Charge spoke with former president Joaquim 
Chissano about Zimbabwe on July 10 at a reception hosted by 
Sant' Egidio founder Andrea Riccardi.  Chissano said 
initially he did not want to speak about Zimbabwe but 
preferred to discuss Uganda.  Nevertheless, he believed that 
Mbeki was doing a good job since communication was ongoing 
with Mugabe.  Chissano had spoken with Mbeki twice during the 
last few months but otherwise claimed not to have engaged on 
Zimbabwe in the region.  As Charge raised the ongoing 
political violence and growing international concern, 
Chissano said that Mbeki needed some more time.  Chissano 
acknowledged that his name had been mentioned as someone to 
help in Zimbabwe, but he quickly dismissed the suggestion 
since he was too busy with Uganda.  He continued that if the 
only measurement of success was Mugabe's removal, then Mbeki 
had not succeeded.  If the result of the proposed negotiation 
was pre-determined, then no true negotiation could transpire. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Sant' Egidio President Marco Impagliazzo told 
the Charge of the Community's deep concern about Zimbabwe. 
When asked if Sant' Egidio was involved in finding solutions 
in Zimbabwe, as they did so effectively in sponsoring the 
Peace Accord which ended Mozambique's Civil War in 1992, 
Impagliazzo responded "No, but we would be willing to help if 
asked."  He even suggested that Dom Mateo Zuppi, a mediator 
who helped with the Mozambique negotiations, would be an 
ideal interlocutor since he "was friends with Mugabe and 
visited him every year."  The Charge encouraged Impagliazzo 
to speak with the U.S. Embassies in Rome and Vatican City 
should he wish to pursue the idea. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  While a reception is not an ideal venue 
for a detailed discussion, Chissano seemed clearly to rule 
out any role for himself in Zimbabwe.  For historical 
reasons, Sant' Egidio maintains an excellent reputation in 
Mozambique as the facilitators of peace.  If this view is 
shared throughout the region, and the claim's about Zuppi's 
relationship with Mugabe prove true, speaking with Sant' 
Egidio about a possible role in Zimbabwe could be a 
conversation worth having.  End Comment.
