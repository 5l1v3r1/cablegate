IDEA 
 
Ref: STATE 69698 
 
(SBU) On May 21, we delivered reftel points to Arti 
Hilpus, MFA Director for Security and Arms Control, and 
discussed the proposed Russian draft of an OSCE 
"charter."  Hilpus said Estonia's position is similar to 
the USG?s position and agrees that the Russian proposal 
would undermine fundamental OSCE commitments on human 
rights.  Estonia is currently participating in the EU 
Coordinating Group in order to have a common European 
position on Russia's proposal.  While many other EU 
member states have similar positions to Estonia, Hilpus 
was unable to predict what the final EU position will 
be.
