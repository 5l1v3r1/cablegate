Old Fashioned Coup d'Etat 
Center-left Rio daily Jornal do Brasil writes on June 30, 2009, 
"Last weekend, in less than 10 hours, Honduras watched the 
deposition of its constitutionally-elected president and the 
assumption of power by a new ruler, all with the blessing of the 
Armed Forces and political elite. The reaction from the 
international community came with the same swiftness of the coup 
d'tat itself. And the world witnessed one of the very rare 
occasions when all the principal actors-of the most different 
political nuances-united themselves in one voice, condemning the 
anti-democratic act and demanding the return of the legitimate 
leader, Manuel Zelaya. 
 
The coup's mentors were not counting on the firm and fast 
repudiation  from names ranging from Barack Obama and Luiz Incio 
Lula da Silva to Hugo Chavez (and his disciples from the Bolivarian 
Alternative for the Americas, or ALBA), and organizations such as 
the Organization of American States and the European Union. Without 
any international support whatsoever and contested by labor unions 
and other Honduran civil society representatives, the recently 
implanted government in Tegucigalpa is already indicating [an 
openness] for dialogue and a return to democratic normalcy. 
Meanwhile, the call for retreat grows louder in the country's 
capital, and the military apparatus stationed in the streets only 
reinforces the feeling of unease that has descended on the nation. 
 
The coup's origins go back to Zelaya's referendum, which aimed to 
amend the Constitution and allow for a new term-going against the 
decision of the courts and the military and opposition's wishes. The 
president's insistence, who scheduled the vote for Sunday, was the 
trigger for the uprising. What one saw on the eve of the voting was 
a repeat ...of the worst stories...of Central America in the 60's 
and 70's... 
 
The military surrounded Zelaya's house at dawn, brought him to an 
air base and afterwards dispatched him to Costa Rica. Radio and 
television transmissions were suspended, electricity was cut and 
public transportation was interrupted. Around noon, the Honduran 
congress met in a special session called on by the president, 
Roberto Micheletti, who was named the country's interim president. 
That night, Zelaya went to Nicaragua (on board a plane lent to him 
by Hugo Chavez), and participated in a meeting with other Latin 
American presidents. In spite of uncertainties, the deposed leader 
remains confident for the future. 
 
In these times of globalization and multilateralism, there is simply 
no room for what happened in Honduras. The words of the American 
president define well the international community's sentiment: 'Any 
existing tensions and disputes must be resolved peacefully through 
dialogue free from any outside interference.' Or else, as President 
Lula pointed out, 'soon it will become fashionable.' The fact is 
that the countries that know the importance of democracy wish to 
guarantee the safety of the deposed leader and that of his family, 
as well as the restoration of constitutional order and Zelaya's 
return to the presidency. All that is left is to find out how much 
each side is willing to cede for that to happen."
