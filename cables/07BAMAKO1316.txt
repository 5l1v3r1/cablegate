SUBJECT: MALI BLOCKS TAIWAN PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY OF 
DEMOCRACIES MINISTERIAL 
 
REF: STATE 151150 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ambassador had several conversations with officials 
at the Foreign Ministry about Taiwan Foundation for Democracy 
(TFD) participation in the NGO portion of the Bamako 
Community of Democracies ministerial.  In a November 2 
discussion, Dr. Oumar Makalou the coordinator of the civil 
society portion of the Bamako ministerial, told the 
Ambassador that Foreign Minister Ouane was aware of the 
exclusion of the two TFD members, and had told Makalou that 
the Malian government would neither invite nor issue visas to 
any participant holding a Taiwan passport. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  After lower level officials professed no knowledge 
of the matter, in a meeting November 5 on a number of issues 
with Foreign Minister Ouane, Ambassador made the points in 
reftel, and asked Ouane to reconsider the case of the two TFD 
participants.  In reply, Ouane noted that the convening group 
meetings in Washington had managed many difficult issues 
regarding participation at the Bamako ministerial, and the 
TFD case fell into this category.  He added that 
participation from Taiwan was a very sensitive matter for the 
Government of Mali, and in the end, Mali agreed to include 
the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy as a participating 
organization in the NGO summit, but to exclude anyone 
carrying a Taiwan passport.  We note from reftel that one of 
the proposed TFD participants is an American citizen. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Although FM Ouane agreed to &reflect 
further8 on this issue, we do not believe the Malians will 
reconsider the decision to exclude Drs. Lin and Yang.  China 
is an increasingly important development partner for the 
Government of Mali, and in the end, this relationship trumps 
any cloud that may hang over the Bamako ministerial as a 
result of the exclusion of participants from Taiwan.
