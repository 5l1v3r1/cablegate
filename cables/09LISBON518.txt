(SBU) Poleconoff delivered reftel points on September 28 to 
Joao Neves da Costa, Portugal's MFA Director for Middle East 
and Maghreb Affairs, and Pedro Carmona, special assistant in 
the MFA's Office of Common Foreign and Security Policy. 
Neves da Costa asserted that the GOP was "on the same line" 
as the U.S. regarding Iran's nuclear program but would await 
the outcome of the October 1 meeting before taking any 
action.  Noting that Portugal had just held parliamentary 
elections September 27, he commented that the Foreign 
Minister could be replaced, resulting in the GOP not having a 
formal position on Iran for some time.  Nonetheless, Neves da 
Costa observed that the EU was developing a "package of 
sanctions" against Iran and the GOP would fully support them.
