RESOLUTIONS ON IPR, HIV/AIDS, AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 93373 
 
¶1.  On September 10, Poloff delivered reftel demarche to 
Nathanael Souza e Silva of the MFA's Human Rights Division 
and provided him a copy of the text of the draft freedom of 
expression resolution.  Souza will personally attend the 12th 
session of the UN Human Rights Council and has also attended 
the last several sessions.  He is knowledgeable about the 
issues. 
 
¶2.  BRAZILIAN INITIATIVES:  Souza said Brazil would likely 
table resolutions concerning access to medicine and IPR, the 
right to health care and HIV/AIDS, human rights cooperation, 
and the effect of the global economic crisis on economic, 
social and cultural rights.  When Poloff commented that there 
may be differences between the U.S. and Brazil on IPR issues, 
Souza replied that he did not think so. 
 
¶3.  FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION:  Souza said that any position 
Brazil takes internationally must be compatible with 
Brazilian domestic law and universal human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.  Under Brazilian law, there can be no 
defamation of religion; only a person can be defamed.  Souza 
said it is essential that human rights be considered within a 
legal framework and not vague sociological notions.  He said 
a resolution could be acceptable that condemns hate speech 
and incitement to religious violence. 
 
¶4.  Souza said he would carefully review the U.S. draft 
freedom of expression resolution and provide his 
recommendation to his immediate superior, Marcia Adorno, head 
of the Human Rights Division.  Then the draft resolution will 
be sent to the Brazilian ambassador in Geneva for his 
comments.  Finally, the MFA in Brasilia will make a decision 
whether or not to support the resolution or to sign on early 
as a co-sponsor.  Souza noted that Brazil had previously 
abstained on this issue. 
 
¶5.  HUMAN RIGHTS CAPACITY-BUILDING:  Souza said that Brazil 
believes that "cooperation is far more effective than 
condemnation" in promoting human rights and therefore has 
been involved in "triangular projects" with the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights for Haiti, Guinea-Bissau 
and Angola.  By the same token, he said, Brazil will support 
the continuation of the UN Human Rights Council's special 
procedures mandates for Somalia, Cambodia and Burundi. 
 
¶6.  DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AGAINST WOMEN:  Souza did not know 
about Colombian plans to introduce a resolution to establish 
a new mechanism to combat discriminatory laws against women, 
with the creation of a Special Rapporteur or Independent 
Expert.  He said, however, that it sounded like something 
Brazil would support. 
 
¶7.  TRADITIONAL VALUES:  The UN Human Rights Council, Souza 
said, should be concerned about the rights of individuals, 
not the protection of different countries' values.  Moreover, 
Brazil has been a leader in the developing world in upholding 
the rights of women and of lesbians, gays, bisexual and 
transgender people, taking positions that are seen by some as 
at odds with so-called traditional values.  Brazil therefore 
shares U.S. concerns about the Russian-sponsored resolution.
