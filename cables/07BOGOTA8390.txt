Third Conference on Colombia 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. Over 400 representatives from 35 countries participated in 
the Group of 24 (G-24) Third International Conference on 
Colombia on November 29-December 1 in Bogota. Building upon 
conferences in London in 2003 and Cartagena in 2005, 
delegates from international organizations, local civil 
society groups, the GOC and donor countries focused on four 
themes (poverty, victims, peace and human rights, democracy) 
to coordinate international assistance to Colombia. The U.S. 
head of delegation, Paul Bonicelli, USAID Assistant 
Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean, welcomed 
robust dialogue among the GOC, civil society and the 
international community, and praised GOC progress on human 
rights. He also clarified that Plan Colombia is not solely 
about military aid, noting USG programs to strengthen 
democratic institutions and assist victims, indigenous, Afro 
Colombians, and displaces persons.

Bogota Declaration Recognizes Advances and Challenges

¶3. The Bogota Declaration, signed by Vice President Santos 
and the Troika Ambassadors (Argentina, Canada and Sweden), 
reaffirmed support for the tripartite dialogue and the 
increased space for civil society participation. Signatories 
affirmed support for the GOC in its efforts to strengthen 
democracy and implement human rights measures. The statement 
also showed solidarity in the global fight on terrorism, 
drugs and corruption. The declaration demanded armed illegal 
groups respect human rights and release all hostages, and 
condemned the killings of the kidnapped Colombian Congressmen 
this summer.  It underscored GOC commitment to protecting and 
guaranteeing the rights of journalists, union workers and 
human rights defenders. It also encouraged the investigation 
of extrajudicial killings and recognized the important role 
of the Prosecutor General's Office and the Supreme Court in 
combating impunity.

GOC: Progress and Ongoing Efforts 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. President Uribe, Vice President Santos, Foreign Minister 
Araujo and other cabinet members stressed the need for 
interagency coordination to address concerns raised by civil 
society and donor countries. Uribe highlighted advances in 
the "recovery of freedom" from the FARC and paramilitaries 
through his democratic security policies. He said 
transparency is boosting confidence and respect for human 
rights. He would continue to pursue policies promoting social 
cohesion and economic prosperity.  The Vice President's 
Director of Human Rights, Carlos Franco, spoke about 
balancing justice and peace, noting that over 84,000 victims 
have registered under the JPL and that versiones libres have 
led to the discovery of numerous remains and mass graves. 
National Commission for Reparation and Reconciliation 
Director Eduardo Pizarro said the GOC will soon issue an 
administrative reparation program to ensure more timely 
relief for victims.  Luis Alfonso Hoyos, Presidential 
Director of Accion Social, also outlined socio-economic 
achievements and outreach to local communities.

Civil Society Voices Concerns 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. In its 21-point declaration, Colombian civil society 
groups called for more support for victims and reparations, 
as well as for greater victim participation in the JPL. While 
critical of the GOC, civil society debate throughout the 
conference was moderate and constructive. The declaration 
urged the GOC to respect the independence of the judicial 
branch, particularly in the para-political investigations. 
The declaration expressed concern about the current 
"humanitarian crisis" in Colombia, including displacement, 
selective murders and extrajudicial killings. It did not 
explicitly refer to the FARC, but called for the release of 
all hostages held by armed groups. It strongly rejected all 
"terrorist actions,"  Lastly, it urged the GOC better 
integrate environmental protection, respect for collective 
territorial rights, and more alternative economic 
opportunities into its counternarcotics policy. 
 
¶6. The international civil society declaration was more 
critical, accusing the GOC of allotting more resources to 
demobilized paramilitary than victims. In reference to the 
Chiquita case, it urged the GOC to take political and legal 
action against multinational companies that made payments to 
paramilitary or other armed groups.  The statement criticized 
the GOC's Center for Coordination of Integral Action (CCAI), 
accusing it of stressing military-oriented programs that 
result in more violence for local communities. It called 
aerial and manual fumigation "weak and marginal" in the 
effort to stem illegal drugs. The declaration reaffirmed the 
necessity of the GOC maintaining political dialogue with the 
FARC,  but did not criticize FARC kidnappings and crimes. 
Vice President Santos rebuked the group for this omission, 
asking why the statement did not condemn the FARC given the 
newly released photos of FARC hostage Ingrid Betancourt. 
 
¶7. In roundtable's between the civil society and the 
international community, civil society leaders said 
para-political ties and "incomplete demobilization" threaten 
democracy. Some groups recognized the fall in murders in 
recent years and the increased capacity of the Fiscalia and 
courts, but they also called for more concrete action to 
improve the human rights situation. Delegates also voiced 
opposition to fumigation in Putumayo, maintaining that local 
communities' health and economy are adversely affected. 
Father Hector Fabio Henao and other civil society leaders 
agreed that, although differences in opinion remain, events 
such as this provide a useful forum for debate.
