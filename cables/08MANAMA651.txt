SUBJECT:  Bahrain charges U.S. teacher with insulting Prophet 
Mohammed 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  This cable provides background on the case of a 
teacher at a local U.S. university charged with insulting the 
Prophet Mohammed.  This case originally surfaced in the 
Arabic-language press approximately three months ago and has now 
been picked up by the international media.   The teacher is no 
longer in Bahrain.  Bahraini law protects all religions from 
defamation.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sometime in June, a teacher at the New York Institute of 
Technology's  Bahrain campus used a doll as a prop to lead a 
discussion on religious tolerance.  Some students objected to the 
characterization of Mohammed and reported the teacher to the school 
authorities.  After an intervention by the Ministry of Education, 
the teacher apologized.  Another student then claimed that the 
teacher further insulted her and would not accept the apology.  The 
teacher departed the island in July and eventually the case made its 
way to the Public Prosecution. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Public Prosecution completed its investigation in early 
September and referred the case to a judge.  The judge has scheduled 
a hearing for 9 October in the lower criminal court.  The judge can 
pronounce a sentence in absentia at that time if the Public 
Prosecutor has served a summons to the accused.  Alternately, the 
judge may defer the hearing in order for the accused to be notified 
either via publishing the summons in the official gazette or by 
having the local police deliver the summons to appear.  A close 
Embassy contact at the Public Prosecution explained to the consular 
officer that according to Bahraini law, it is a crime to blaspheme 
or otherwise insult any religion.  Ramadan and the current financial 
crises have overshadowed this case as there has been no further 
reporting since last Friday, except for in the international press. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: With the accused no longer in Bahrain, a guilty 
verdict will have little immediate effect.  The teacher would likely 
be barred from returning to Bahrain and could be subject to a fine 
and/or jail time if she did attempt to re-enter the country 
following a guilty verdict.  Post has not had any contact with the 
accused.
