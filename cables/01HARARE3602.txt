E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ZI PREL PHUM
SUBJECT: GOZ APPROVES INFORMATION BILL 
 
 
¶1.   THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) HAS APPROVED THE 
    CONTROVERSIAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PROTECTION 
    OF PRIVACY BILL.  THE BILL IS LIKELY TO BE 
    PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR CONSIDERATION WITHIN 
    THE NEXT 10 DAYS. 
 
¶2.   THE BILL CONTAINS A NUMBER OF MEASURES PROVIDING 
    FOR GOVERNMENT LICENSING AND CONTROL OF JOURNALISTS AND 
    MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS.  SEVERAL MEDIA OBSERVERS AND NON- 
    GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE MEDIA 
    INSTITUTE OF SOUTHERN AFRICA (MISA) AND THE NATIONAL 
    CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY (NCA), HAVE SHARPLY CRITICIZED 
    THE BILL.  THEY DESCRIBE IT AS "ANOTHER GOZ TOOL TO 
    MUZZLE THE INDEPENDENT PRESS." 
 
¶3.   ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE NOVEMBER 
    30 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE 
    HERALD," THE BILL PROVIDES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
    "MEDIA AND INFORMATION COMMISSION" TO REGULATE THE 
    MEDIA INDUSTRY.  THE ARTICLE DOES NOT INDICATE THE 
    COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION, BUT MAKES CLEAR THAT THE 
    MINISTER OF INFORMATION WILL HAVE CONTROL OF THE 
    COMMISSION. 
 
¶4.   THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE BILL ARE: 
 
-    SANCTIONS AGAINST JOURNALISTS OR MEDIA 
  ORGANIZATION THAT ".SPREAD RUMORS, FALSEHOODS OR CAUSE 
  ALARM AND DESPONDENCY UNDER THE GUISE OF AUTHENTIC 
  REPORTS." 
-    THE REQUIREMENT THAT MEDIA OWNERS REGISTER WITH 
  THE COMMISSION, WHICH MAY CANCEL THE REGISTRATION IF AN 
  ORGANIZATION VIOLATES ANY PART OF THE BILL. 
-    THE REQUIREMENT THAT ONLY ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS OR 
  COMPANIES OWNED BY ZIMBABWEANS WILL BE ALLOWED TO 
  OPERATE MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS. 
-    THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGISTER OF JOURNALISTS AND 
  THE ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF REGISTRATION TO 
  JOURNALISTS WHO "MUST POSSESS THE PRESCRIBED 
  QUALIFICATIONS AND BE A CITIZEN OF AND BASED IN 
  ZIMBABWE." 
-    GRANTING THE COMMISSION AUTHORITY TO ACCREDIT 
  JOURNALISTS AND GIVING THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION 
  AUTHORITY TO PRESCRIBE THE MANNER AND FORM IN WHICH THE 
  ACCREDITATION WILL BE DONE.  THE BILL ALSO GIVES THE 
  COMMISSION AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND OR PUNISH JOURNALISTS 
  FOR "MISCONDUCT." 
-    SANCTIONS AGAINST JOURNALISTS WHO WRITE FOR 
  PUBLICATIONS OTHER THAN THE ONE THAT EMPLOYS THEM. 
-    THE REQUIREMENT THAT ALL FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS 
  NEED TO BE CITIZENS OF ZIMBABWE. 
-    THE REQUIREMENT THAT FOREIGN MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS 
  WILL BE SET UP ONLY WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE MINISTER 
  OF INFORMATION AND ONLY JOURNALISTS ACCREDITED IN TERMS 
  OF THE BILL SHALL BE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS. 
 
¶5.   IF THIS BILL IS PASSED AS WRITTEN, IT WILL GIVE 
    THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE SWEEPING POWER TO DETERMINE 
    WHO MAY OWN AND OPERATE A MEDIA COMPANY, WHO MAY WORK 
    AS A JOURNALIST AND WHAT NEWS MAY BE REPORTED.
