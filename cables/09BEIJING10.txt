  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"To cautiously evaluate the future of U.S.-China relations" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/04): "Regarding certain historical lessons 
after the 10th and 20th Anniversaries, this year the government and 
the scholars in both countries have become cautious when evaluating 
the future of the U.S.-China relationship. The two countries should 
not look at their bilateral relations in the short-term. Both 
countries' scholars indicate that none of the historical issues have 
been solved. At the same time, in several new fields, there are new 
issues arising, such as climate change and Tibet. Most scholars have 
a concerned and practical attitude when reporting on the 
relationship. After Obama takes office, it would be helpful if the 
transition is peaceful and further develops U.S.-China relations. 
Our generation is not wiser than our predecessors, but we have 
learned their lessons and we believe we can do better." 
 
¶2. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"U.S. and Europe contemplate the flaws in their market rescue 
policies" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/05): "In 2009, people will begin to worry 
over the negative effect of the market rescue measures taken by many 
countries. European and American decision makers, lacking new ideas, 
are facing new challenges such as the deficit, inflation, and 
stimulus packages. Experts believe that the U.S. cannot completely 
rely on foreign investors. The only way that the U.S. can help 
itself is by producing more money. Inflation is inevitable. ...To 
stimulate economy, the government has to conduct a loose currency 
policy.  Deficit and inflation are inevitable.  However, a policy 
that is loose is the only way to deal with an economic recession. 
In 2009, the commodities market will likely experience some big 
ups-and-downs. In order to step-away from the financial crisis, many 
decision makers need to be more creative with their solutions." 
 
¶3. U.S. MILITARY 
 
"The U.S. army issues a report suggesting that it should 
'domestically deploy troops' which arouses conflict" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily 
(01/05): "Along with the spread of the global financial crisis, 
inside the U.S. concerns about the large-scale chaos caused by a 
financial recession is increasing day after day. The U.S. army 
recently issued a report which indicates that the U.S. military is 
prepared to interfere in domestic issues, should they be needed. 
This suggestion is not the traditional American way of thinking and 
so it has aroused many conflicts.  The U.S. media guessed that the 
report has gained much support within the military and was issued in 
order to test public opinion.  No matter what the excuse is, sending 
regular troops in the country to conduct combat activities is a 
challenge to the U.S. constitution and political system.  The social 
and legal problems this would produce are hard to predict." 
 
¶4. ISRAEL 
 
"Why does Israel conduct a heavy strike at Gaza?" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(01/05): "Analysts indicate that Israel has three goals in 
launching its war against Gaza: first, after a yearlong ineffective 
blockage, Israel must use its armed forces to remove Hamas, the 
biggest obstacle to peace talks. Second, Israel intends to destroy 
the military strength and the weapons that Hamas uses to fight 
against Israel. And third, Israel intends to strike down Hamas' 
spirit and will so that Hamas loses its support from the Palestinian 
public. Israel's air attack did not reach these goals, thus Israel 
decided to start a ground attack. The U.S., who is the most capable 
of interfering in this war, is, at this time, in a power transition. 
And, it is hard for the UN to make any resolution to restrict 
Israel. All of these factors have strengthened Israel's 
determination to launch a ground attack on Gaza."
