¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Dec. 3, Ambassador Ashe called 
on new AgMinister Marek Sawicki, accompanied by 
AgCounselor.  As reported reftel, Sawicki is a 
member of Poland's minority party, PSL, in the new 
governing coalition with PO that came to office 
after parliamentary elections Oct. 21.  Minister 
Sawicki spoke warmly about relations with the 
United States and outlined his priorities for the 
improvement of Polish agriculture, mentioning his 
concern about farmer incomes and retirement social 
security programs.  The Minister commented with 
moderation on biotechnology, hinting at a 
recognition of Poland's EU commission problems. 
Sawicki mentioned interest in attending the WIREC 
Ministerial energy conference and requested more 
information.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Ashe congratulated Sawicki on his 
appointment to his position.  Sawicki answered that 
he had been born on a farm in Sawice, a farm he now 
owns.  Sawicki extended his appreciation for the 
visit and offered that America is a great nation. 
Sawicki thanked USDA for approving sanitary 
regulations to allow Polish pork exports to the 
United States. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ashe said that agricultural biotechnology 
benefits farms and the environment simultaneously 
and is helping to advance biofuel research.  He 
said Poland's upcoming ban on biotechnology 
varieties in animal feeds was harmful to Poland's 
farm economy.  Sawicki replied that Polish 
regulations are very strict, but that he supports 
the EU solutions to raise the zero tolerance of GMO 
presence in feeds and food.  He added he was 
against GMO's in general, but thought it worthwhile 
to cooperate with the United States to find 
solutions to EU problems with the technology.  In a 
follow up question on biotechnology, Sawicki shared 
that he takes resolving the feed ban problem 
seriously, and may be interested in talking about 
other Poland biotech problems later.  He said work 
must be done to inform the public about 
biotechnology and its benefits. 
 
¶4.  (U) Mentioning the upcoming U.S. Ministerial 
conference on biofuels, Ashe inquired whether 
Sawicki might attend.  Sawicki replied that 
biofuels will be a major initiative of his work and 
he will be working hard to influence the Ministry 
of Economy on the issue to support Polish farmers. 
He expressed interest in attending the WIREC 
Ministerial March 4-6. 
 
¶5.  (U) Ashe informed Sawicki of USDA's decision to 
acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Henryk 
Jasiorowski, a Polish agricultural scientist, at an 
upcoming ceremony at the CMR, January 17, 2008. 
Sawicki replied that Jasiorowski was an excellent 
choice.  He will try to attend.  (Comment.  USDA's 
award for Dr. Jasiorowski highlights Poland's 
agricultural contributions to the globe and was a 
post-initiated award.  Jasiorowski was a pioneer 
animal feed expert that helped promote studies that 
favored U.S. feeds and animal breeds after WWII, 
building markets in Europe for these products.  Dr. 
Jasiorowski has been a tireless promoter and board 
member of the global NGO - The Heifer Project, 
offering free animals to the poor in the developing 
world.  End comment.) 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Sawicki offered his goals for his term as 
Agricultural Minister.  He emphasized his devotion 
to the Common Agricultural Policy and his alliance 
with French Ag. Minister Barnier to forestall cuts 
in the future.  He wishes to see Polish farmers' 
payments harmonized with Western Europe.  He wants 
to see more producer groups acting as collectives

to process their products, and complimented the 
American model of the producer group. Collectives 
exist for the dairy industry, but more farm 
processing is needed, he said.  Sawicki shared his 
concern with farm pensions.  Poland's pension 
program for farmers is separate from other programs 
and is not as well funded as other sectors.  He is 
concerned about outmigration of Poland's brightest 
pupils to other EU member states.  He wants more 
and better jobs in agriculture created in Poland. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment.  The new minister must balance 
consumer opposition to biotechnology with renewed 
pressure from the EU to resolve Polish legislative 
problems on biotech.  Sawicki is interested in 
close contact with the United States and in dialog 
about biotechnology.  The meeting confirms Poland's 
strong opposition to CAP reform.  End comment.
