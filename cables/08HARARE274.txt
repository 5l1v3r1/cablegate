¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Four days after Zimbabwe's national 
election, presidential and senate results have yet to be 
announced, but rumors abound. The government-run newspaper, 
The Herald, dedicated much of its April 2 issue to 
post)election propaganda.  In what appears to be an attempt 
to manage expectations and tamper excitement about change in 
the State House, the newspaper refuted MDC claims of victory, 
applauded the role of the electoral commission, fanned fears 
of a dismal future under an opposition-led executive, and 
promulgated conspiracy theories of Western intervention. 
Nonetheless, all evidence suggests the majority of 
Zimbabweans are ready for a change. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Under the headline "ZANU, MDC in Photo Finish", 
Zimbabwe,s state-run newspaper's April 2 edition worked to 
maintain the appearance that ZANU remains in control.  While 
The Herald, using results from the Zimbabwe Electoral 
Commission (ZEC), conceded that the opposition MDC leads in 
House of Assembly seats (99-97), it emphasized that ZANU won 
the popular vote.  If extrapolated to the presidential race, 
this could suggest momentum for a ZANU win in the rumored 
upcoming runoff or lend credibility to a ZEC announcement of 
a Mugabe win. 
 
¶3. (SBU) What the paper failed to highlight, however, was 
that ZEC's results also revealed that the opposition tally, 
combining the MDC-Tsvangirai and MDC-Mutambara factions along 
with independent candidates, exceeded ZANU's total by 196,525 
votes and put the opposition in control of Parliament with 
106 seats.  With the opposition ahead in the both the popular 
vote and in seats gained, the desire for change in Zimbabwe 
is clear. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In the wake of the MDC's announcement of its victory 
in both the presidential and Assembly races (reftel A), The 
Herald went on the attack.  Quoting the ZANU secretary for 
administration, the paper reported that the MDC's 
announcement was both incorrect and illegal, as ZEC was the 
only body authorized to declare final results.  The article 
went on to criticize the MDC for speaking to the 
international media and accused the opposition of attempting 
to confuse the public about the outcome of the election.  The 
Herald failed to note that the opposition party has stated on 
numerous occasions that MDC figures were based on publicly 
available information from polling station postings, and were 
not meant to be viewed as certified results. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Herald gave significant coverage to touting the 
work of ZEC, which, according to the paper, "is emerging this 
week as the bedrock of a peaceful and transparent election." 
The Herald noted that preliminary statements by observer 
missions; including the Common Market for East and Southern 
Africa, the Pan African Parliament (PAP), and the Southern 
African Development Community, deemed ZEC,s efforts and the 
elections as credible.  The paper did not report on PAP,s 
caveat that the delay in the announcement of the results was 
a serious concern that could suggest fraud (reftel B). 
 
¶6. (SBU) Other Herald articles condemned the role of NGOs, 
the international media and Western governments for their 
"hidden hand" in the election.  The newspaper reported that 
U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown had "hinted" on the BBC at 
increased aid for Zimbabwe if Tsvangirai won the presidency. 
State-run radio has been airing programs blaming Western 
sanctions for Zimbabwe's economic crisis.  The paper claimed 
that in contrast with the silence from African leaders, the 
 
HARARE 00000274  002 OF 002 
 
 
West's statements calling for results to be released were a 
sign of political maneuvering by "unfriendly nations" to 
promote regime change.  The international media, much of 
which was officially banned from covering the election from 
inside Zimbabwe, was criticized for spreading conspiracy 
theories about ZANU.  The African Union observer mission 
delegation leader criticized CNN,s "biased reporting" 
following a meeting with Mugabe.  The accuracy of parallel 
tabulations by "the MDC and its civil society compatriots" 
was questioned by The Herald in a veiled reference to the 
Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network's sample vote count 
(reftel C). 
 
¶7. (SBU) Additional articles were written within the context 
of Zimbabwe's liberation struggle, of which Mugabe is still 
considered a hero, and the ruling party's subsequent 
controversial land reform efforts, during which farms 
belonging to whites were seized and redistributed to 
liberation veterans.  One story described Tsvangirai and 
presidential candidate Simba Makoni as "Western stooges" who 
were "being used to sabotage the land reform program."  In 
another, The Herald reported on "the conspicuous flow of many 
white commercial farmers who trooped back to Zimbabwe once 
the MDC prematurely claimed victory. Some of them headed to 
farms where they threatened to evict newly settled farmers." 
One veteran from the liberation war was quoted as saying, "we 
will be left with no option except to take up arms and defend 
our pieces of land" if Tsvangirai wins. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT: In an apparent move to rekindle nationalist 
sentiment and remind Zimbabweans of Mugabe's once popular 
political agenda, ZANU, through its government mouthpiece, is 
playing on some of the country's most emotional issues, 
including white rule and Zimbabwe's perpetual political hot 
potato, land reform.  Whether this return to campaign mode 
will have any impact on voters in either a runoff scenario or 
in the case of a Mugabe power grab remains to be seen. 
However, results released so far only lend credence to the 
perception that Zimbabweans are ready for change no matter 
what tactics are employed to impact their vote. END COMMENT.
