¶1. (C) Summary: The Muslim Brotherhood (MB) in Syria
Website published a "letter" on June 11 accusing external
Damascus Declaration committees of violating the Damascus
Declaration National Council’s bylaws on electing members to
the General Secretariat. XXXXXXXXXXXX explained
the Muslim Brotherhood’s protest stemmed from the external
Damascus Declaration committees’ failure to coordinate with
the MB in setting up the external political structures meant
to compliment the Damascus Declaration’s internal structures.
The rancor expressed in the MB’s letter suggested a growing
fissure between expatriate Damascus Declaration
representatives, especially between the MB and the small, but
politically connected and increasingly active Movement for
Justice and Development (MJD). More worrisome, however, is
recent information suggesting the SARG may already have
penetrated the MJD and learned about sensitive USG programs
in Syria. End Summary.
----------
Background
----------
¶2. (C) Since 2005, internal squabbles among political
parties signatory to the Damascus Declaration have stalled,
but never obstructed, the organization’s forward progress.
Disputes ranged from how vocal the organization should be in
condemning U.S. policies in the region (ref A) to whether the
Damascus Declaration should distance itself from the MB.
Nasserists and nationalists of varying stripes, especially
those in the Arab Socialist Democratic Party, whose
participation in the Damascus Declaration was permitted by
the SARG as a wedge to create division among reformist ranks,
proved especially adamant in their rejection of the MB. The
Nasserists, XXXXXXXXXXXX told us, insisted the MB’s involvement
provoked the SARG; for the Damascus Declaration to continue
safely, MB participation would have to be jettisoned.
¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX

MJD vs. Muslim Brotherhood
--------------------------
¶4. (C) Since 2008, expatriates have formed Damascus
Declaration committees throughout Europe and the United
States. Initially, XXXXXXXXXXXX remarked, little coordination
existed among the nascent "external committees" in the U.S.,
Britain, Belgium, France, and Germany. The MB, despite
having a developed network in Europe and being signatory to
the original Declaration, was left on the margin. The MB did
not comment on the formation of the committees, nor was the
MB’s input sought by those putting the committees together,
XXXXXXXXXXXX said. XXXXXXXXXXXX added that the purpose of these
committees was to put in place a temporary, seven person panel that
could elect a small number of external representatives to the
General Secretariat, an idea consistent with the founders
intentions for the General Secretariat’s structure.
¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX asked the representative of the London-based
Damascus Declaration committee, Anas al-Abdah -- who was also the
leader of the Movement for Justice and Development, a self-professed
moderate Islamic organization (ref B) -- to contact the MB
and invite them to participate in the formation and elections
of the ad hoc political panel.
¶6. (C) "After a year," XXXXXXXXXXXX lamented, "nothing has been
achieved. Abdah claimed he tried to contact them, but this
is hard to prove." XXXXXXXXXXXX added that other external Damascus
Declaration committee members had reported back that they too
had attempted to contact the MB without success. XXXXXXXXXXXX told
us XXXXXXXXXXXX doubted attempts at contact commenced until it was
effectively beside the point -- that is, after the MB broke
with the NSF and disavowed opposition activities in response
to the Israeli attacks on Gaza. By then, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, it was too
late; the MB felt slighted by the external committees. When
the MB broke from the NSF, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, "I tried to push
XXXXXXXXXXXX to contact them directly," to ask them to
participate in the formation of the external political
structure. "I said directly, not through (Anas) Abdah
because I know competition among groups outside causes
problems," XXXXXXXXXXXX recounted. XXXXXXXXXXXX
¶7. (C) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, it was the external committees’
disregard for MB participation that prompted the Brotherhood
to draft and publish its incendiary letter. XXXXXXXXXXXX said "some
people are now saying the MB isn’t serious about joining in
the Damascus Declaration’s work" and that the letter is just
an excuse -- they have already renounced opposition
activities and do not plan to resume them against Syria. XXXXXXXXXXXX
cautioned, "I think this comes from outside, not in Syria,"
and that it is not true. XXXXXXXXXXXX, "The MB is
the largest Islamic group in the country; the MJD is just a
few people."
------------------
MJD: A Leaky Boat?
------------------
¶8. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX had told us in the past (ref B) that the MJD
(1) had many members who were formerly with the MB; (2) was
at odds with the MB and sought to marginalize it abroad; (3)
was seeking to expand its base in Syria, though it had not
been successful; and (4) had been initially lax in its
security, often speaking about highly sensitive material on
open lines. The first three points speak directly to the
ongoing feud and the MB’s recent letter of protest. XXXXXXXXXXXX
¶9. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX told us security services had asked
whether XXXXXXXXXXXX had met with anyone from our "Foreign Ministry"
and with anyone from the Democracy Council (Comment: State
Department Foreign Affairs Officer Joseph Barghout had
recently been in Syria XXXXXXXXXXXX; we assume the
SARG was fishing for information, knowing Barghout had
entered the country. Jim Prince was in Damascus on February
25, XXXXXXXXXXXX
¶10. (S/NF) Comment: Born not as a political party, but as
an umbrella organization composed of many different groups,
the Damascus Declaration has been handicapped by internal
divisions among unlikely allies: the Kurds, the MB, liberals,
national socialists, communists and others. XXXXXXXXXXXX
MJD’s organizational successes so far might best be explained
as the by-products of its relationship with the XXXXXXXXXXXX and the
USG. Evidence the organization has a sizable, influential
constituency inside and outside Syria is difficult to
discern. Post has seen no reporting on the size MJD’s base
in Europe and the U.S. XXXXXXXXXXXX; therefore it would not
surprise us if an external committee member like Anas Abdah,
who heads both the Damascus Declaration’s external London committee
and the MJD, would drag his feet when asked to contact the MB.
¶11. (S/NF) Comment continued: XXXXXXXXXXXX report begs the
question of how much and for how long the SARG has known
about Democracy Council operations in Syria and, by
extension, the MJD’s participation. Reporting in other
channels suggest the Syrian Muhabarat may already have
penetrated the MJD and is using MJD contacts to track U.S.
democracy programming. If the SARG does know, but has chosen
not to intervene openly, it raises the possibility that the
SARG may be mounting a campaign to entrap democracy activists
receiving illegal (under Syrian law) foreign assistance. End
Comment.
