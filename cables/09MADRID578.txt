¶1. (U) Please see request for guidance paragraph 5. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On June 14, post received an e-mail message from 
Orion Air advising that Orion has terminated its contract 
with Syrian Pearl.  Informal Embassy translation follows: 
 
Begin text: 
 
Dear Sirs: 
 
ref: Orion Air 
 
This is to inform you that this company, following the 
guidance of the U.S. Government - once confirmed by Spanish 
authorities - has terminated, effective immediately (Note: 
The Spanish expression used, "de manera fulminante," is 
stronger and implies a sudden and drastic action.  End 
Note.), its relationship with the company Syrian Pearl. 
 
Therefore, via this letter we request that you take the 
necessary measures to cancel the TDO against this company and 
proceed to communicate to all concerned businesses to cease 
to take measures against Orion Air and to lift the 
restrictions in force. 
 
As a result of the rupture with Syrian Pearl, the EC-IVO 
aircraft currently in Damascus has been illegally retained by 
Syrian Pearl, making it impossible for the plane to return to 
Europe.  We would appreciate your advice on the steps to take 
to withdraw the plane from the Syrian airport. 
 
We look forward to your reply. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Arancha Merino 
Director General 
Orion Air

¶3.  (SBU) On June 15, Orion Air Manager Jose Maria Orea 
called post to convey again the message that Orion had broken 
off dealings with the Syrian airline and to request that the 
TDO be lifted.  He clarified that it was Syrian airport 
authorities who were not allowing Orion's crew access to the 
aircraft in order to fly it back.  Orea said it was not clear 
whether the Syrian airline or the Syrian government was 
behind this.  He added that the Spanish Embassy in Damascus 
was engaged. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On a related subject, as reported in ref A e-mail, 
post was contacted June 10 by Elena MacCormick, Director 
General of Pan Air, a company with a maintenance contract 
with Orion Air for its plane in Syria.  MacCormick advised 
that upon learning on June 8 of the TDO, she had that day 
recalled Pan Air's three mechanics who were working on the 
plane.  She stated that the removal of the employees 
effectively grounded the aircraft. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Request for guidance: Please advise how post should 
reply to Orion's message, or, alternatively, whether we 
should urge Orion to contact Commerce/BIS directly.
