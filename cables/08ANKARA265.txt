¶1. (C) We delivered reftel demarche on February 11 to MFA 
Department Head for Arms Control and Disarmament Elif Ulgen, 
who is coordinating Turkey's interagency position on cluster 
munitions and was a member of the Turkish delegation to the 
Oslo Process meeting in Vienna on 5-7 December.  Ulgen said 
that Turkey shares many of our concerns about the draft 
declaration.  Turkey continues to view the Convention on 
Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) as the most appropriate 
framework to conduct negotiations on cluster munitions and to 
strike a balance between humanitarian concerns and military 
requirements.  In particular, Turkey is concerned about the 
impact that the proposed convention would have on NATO 
interoperability.  Ulgen further stated that although there 
exists a de facto moratorium on the use of cluster munitions 
by the Turkish armed forces, Turkey's military doctrine 
continues to call for the use of cluster munitions in the 
event of an "all out war." 
 
¶2. (C) Despite having strong reservations about the draft 
declaration, Turkey will send a delegation to the Wellington 
meeting.  Ulgen expected the Turkish delegation only to play 
an observer's role in Wellington, and stressed that Turkey's 
goal in participating in the meetings is to avoid being 
blindsided by the process. 
 
¶3. (C) Ulgen noted that Turkey has been participating in a 
series of informal meetings taking place in Geneva (separate 
from but possibly related to the CCW negotiations chaired by 
Danish Ambassador Witgoski) among like-minded countries 
participating in the Oslo Process (including the UK, Germany, 
the Netherlands, Finland, Japan, and Australia).  According 
to Ulgen, during the last Geneva meeting in January, 
participants were in wide agreement that the provision for a 
total ban on cluster munitions must be removed from the final 
declaration.  Ulgen made clear that Turkey has no intention 
of signing the declaration as it currently stands.
