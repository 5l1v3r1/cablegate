SUBJECT: JERICHO PRISON ATTACK DRAWS IRE AT U.S., UK 
 
¶1. (U) The March 14 Israeli raid on Jericho Prison and 
seizure of Palestinian suspects drew strong condemnation in 
Omani newspaper editorials the following day.  The 
independently owned Arabic daily "Al-Watan" placed its 
editorial on the front page, asserting that Israel's actions 
were clearly illegal and have only served to make a hero of 
Ahmed Saadat.  Local media carried a statement by GCC 
Secretary General Attiyah also criticizing the Israeli 
 
SIPDIS 
action.  Popular reactions in the local Internet message 
board "al-Sablah" overwhelmingly heaped blame upon the U.S. 
and UK governments for withdrawing their monitors from the 
prison prior to the Israeli attack, taken as proof of 
collusion in the operation.  The volume of postings on the 
topic exceeded 47 pages by the morning of March 15. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Omani government has made no statement in 
reaction to the Israeli strike.  In a March 15 discussion on 
other topics, Pol/Econ Chief explained to the MFA 
Undersecretary's main Embassy interlocutor the reasons for 
the USG decision to pull its monitors from the prison, 
denying there was active collusion with Israel on its 
subsequent operation.  The MFA official took positive note.
