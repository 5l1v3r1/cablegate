REF: SECSTATE 44903 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Kigali has taken several strides to reach out 
to activists for democracy and dissidents since the 
Secretary's request for such action by Chiefs of Mission. 
Ambassador and Embassy personnel have met frequently with 
members of independent political parties, human rights and 
civil society organizations, independent journalists, and 
religious groups on issues of democracy and governance. 
Mission officers conducted several prison visits, where they 
observed and spoke with detainees, including prominent former 
politicians.  Mission staff conducted regular outreach 
programs, including a workshop on political communication for 
political parties, civil society, and the media, focusing on 
democratic debate and pluralism, party organization, and 
mobilization.  Journalists also received training and 
development on media in a democracy, ethics and social 
responsibility through participation in the International 
Visitor Program. 
 
¶2. (U) The Ambassador and Mission staff were forceful 
advocates in support of human rights and democracy and raised 
concerns about human rights abuses with high-level government 
officials, NGOs, and international agencies.  Using a wide 
range of diplomatic tools, the Mission closely monitored and 
reported on human rights abuses; provided technical 
assistance and training to promote government accountability 
and respect for human rights; offered programs to strengthen 
institutions, NGOs, and civil society; and was proactively 
engaged in individual cases of concern.  The Ambassador and 
members of the Mission worked with the government to develop 
strategies and programming designed to improve ruling justly 
indicators, particularly political rights, civil liberties, 
and voice and accountability, including in such areas as 
judicial independence, civil society participation, and press 
freedom as part of its Millennium Challenge Corporation 
Country Threshold Plan.
