¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  At 5:15 am local time on Tuesday, August 
4, 2007, Hurricane Felix made landfall 20 miles north of the 
city of Puerto Cabezas on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. 
Initial reports from the region indicate that the category 
five storm has displaced more than 38,000 people in the 
Atlantic Region.  More than 90 percent of houses in Puerto 
Cabezas have suffered severe structural damage; 80 percent of 
electrical and telecommunications infrastructure has been 
damaged. Access to remote areas of ordinarily-isolated 
Atlantic Region for assessments have been hampered by the 
fact that there are no all-weather roads at all between 
Puerto Cabezas and the rest of the country.  As of late this 
afternoon, the storm had slowed in speed and intensity, which 
will likely result in heavy rainfall (over 400mm), flooding 
and landslides.  The Nicaraguan Government has declared a 
state of emergency.  Early this afternoon President Ortega 
spoke personally with the Ambassador who told him that 
Nicaragua "would be grateful for our help."  We strongly 
believe it is in the USG interest to provide assistance to 
Nicaragua. 
 
STORM STATUS AND DAMAGE ASSESSMENT 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Hurricane Felix, a Category Five storm, made landfall at about 5:15am local time this morning 20 miles north of Puerto Cabezas. Initial reports from the region indicate that the storm has displaced more than 38,000 people in the Atlantic Region. Three Nicaraguan fatalities have been reported so far. More than 90 percent of houses in Puerto Cabezas have suffered severe structural damage; while in the communities of Sandy Bay and Bismona, all houses have been destroyed. The hospital in Puerto Cabezas was partially destroyed. 80 percent of electrical and telecommunications infrastructure in Puerto Cabezas has been damaged; while electricity and phones lines in many smaller communities have been destroyed. Access to remote areas of ordinarily-isolated Atlantic Region for assessments have been hampered by the fact that there are no all-weather roads at all between Puerto Cabezas and the rest of the country. As of late this afternoon, the storm had slowed in speed and intensity, which will likely result in heavy rainfall (over 400mm), flooding and landslides.
 
COM DISASTER DECLARATION MESSAGE 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) At the end of a two-hour press conference this 
afternoon, the government announced that President Ortega had 
declared a state of emergency.  Just prior to the press 
conference, the Ambassador spoke via phone with President 
Ortega who stated that this disaster was beyond the ability 
of Nicaragua to respond adequately and that he would be 
grateful for our help.  He said the most urgent problem they 
faced was not having adequate capacity to reach isolated 
areas to make damage assessments and distribute relief 
supplies.  He requested large helo lift support for this 
purpose.  We strongly believe it is in the USG interest to 
provide assistance to Nicaragua.  It is the Ambassador's view 
that: 
 
-- This disaster is beyond Nicaragua's ability to respond. 
-- Nicaragua will accept USG assistance. 
-- It is in the interest of the USG to provide assistance. 
 
Per section 4 of the SouthCom Guidance to SAOs and JTFs 
regarding Foreign Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief, 
the Ambassador also requests that the OFDA/DOS to DOD ExecSec 
memo move forward to formally request DOD assistance to 
provide relief. 
 
ACS RESPONSE: NO REPORTS OF AMCIT INJURY OR DEATH 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The consular section has received one phone call and 
four email inquiries from American citizens regarding the 
status of Hurricane Felix.  To date there are no/no reports 
of American citizen injuries or deaths.  There are relatively 
few American citizens living in the remote north-east region 
of Nicaragua, the area most affected by Hurricane Felix. 
Only 49 American citizens are registered with the consular 
section in the RAAN, with 27 registered in neighboring state 
of Jinotega.  The majority of Americans in this area are 
affiliated with missionary organizations.  We have attempted 
to contact all of the wardens and registrants living in the 
areas most affected by Hurricane Felix, including the RAAN, 
and the states of Jinotega, Nueva Segovia, and Madriz.  We 
have also contacted the major religious organizations that 
send American citizen missionaries out to these areas.  We 
have spoken with some 20 people living in the affected area 
and all report extensive property damage but no American 
citizen injuries or deaths. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Missionary-affiliated Americans in Puerto Cabezas 
reported that the high winds caused extensive damage, ripping 
roofs off houses, toppling down trees, and knocking houses 
off of their stilts.  The missionaries were not aware of any 
injuries or deaths in the area but said they would pass on 
the Embassy's contact information and contact us immediately 
if they came across any American citizens in need of 
assistance.  One of the Baptist missionaries reported that a 
group of 14 Americans who are there temporarily assisting 
with their ministry, including an 80 year-old woman, were all 
fine.  The roof was blown off their house and the contents of 
there home severely damaged, but the group sought refuge in 
the basement and were not injured by the hurricane. The 
regional coordinator for the Sisters of St. Agnes reported 
that their convent in Waspam, a small town located along the 
Rio Coco River, suffered some damage but that all occupants, 
including one American citizen, were fine.  The consular 
warden in Jinotega confirmed that they had not experienced 
injuries and that local groups were leading efforts to 
provide shelter and medical assistance.  He believes there 
are about 12 American citizens in the area and is contacting 
them to ascertain their situation. 
 
EMBASSY PLANNING AND RESPONSE 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Embassy Hurricane Task Force met this morning 
and this afternoon.  We also participated in two 
Washington-organized teleconferences.  We have been in 
contact with GON officials and counterparts throughout the 
day, receiving status reports and damage assessments.   Late 
this morning, the Ambassador spoke with the Vice President 
and with the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and offered an 
initial tranche of USD 25,000 in relief assistance authorized 
by USAID/OFDA for disaster preparedness.  The country team 
has already begun the process to request additional 
assistance from USAID/OFDA.  We are also working to 
facilitate the transport of OFDA personnel to the affected 
areas within the next 18 hours to conduct damage assessments 
and determine what additional USG assistance is appropriate. 
 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY OUTREACH 
------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) We have prepared a press release offering our 
condolences to those who have been affected by the storm.  It 
will also note that the U.S. has offered initial funds and is 
determining how best to respond to the GON request for 
assistance.  We will continue to respond to media inquiries 
from local, regional and international outlets.
