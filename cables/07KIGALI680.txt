REF: STATE 55422 
 
¶1. SUMMARY. In accordance with reftel, the following updates the 
single existing investment dispute involving an American investor in 
Rwanda. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. The United States Government is aware of one (1) claim of a 
United States person that is outstanding against the Government of 
Rwanda (GOR). 
 
      a. Claimant A 
 
b. Year the dispute arose: 2002 
 
c. Case History:  Claimant A is in dispute with the GOR involving a 
fish farming project/investment in Rwanda.  Claimant A was in 
business from April 1996 until December 2002 at the Kigembe Fish 
Farm, when persistent disagreements with the Government of Rwanda 
(GOR) over financing and payment arrangements led to an end to 
formal company operations.  Since 2002, the director of the company 
has been in negotiations with the GOR for payment of operational and 
income loss from his investment, an amount he now claims totals $15 
million.  Non-binding arbitration was sought by the GOR, but 
Claimant A, after an attempt to seek an out-of-court settlement from 
the GOR for an undetermined amount failed, took the case to court on 
July 18, 2006. 
 
On August 1, 2006 Judge Karugarama heard the case, but was appointed 
to Minister of Justice on August 4 before rendering a decision.  The 
court scheduled a new court date for January 15, 2007.  When the 
court finally convened on March 26, 2007, the High Court ruled that 
it is "not competent to hear the case" and that the case must 
restart in a lower court or appeal to the Supreme Court.  The 
claimant filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and is supposed to 
receive a verdict on August 7, 2007. 
 
On July 24, 2007 the Minister of Finance agreed to the Embassy to 
assemble a cross-ministerial team to meet with the claimant in hopes 
of reaching an out-of-court settlement.  This will be done in 
parallel with the judicial proceedings and is an attempt to resolve 
the matter once and for all.
