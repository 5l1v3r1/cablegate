¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a follow-up inquiry on a request (DDTC case GC 0997-09) for 
the re-export of three (3) C-130H aircraft from Nigeria to 
Senegal.  The aircraft are defense articles controlled under 
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) 
administered by PM/DDTC.  Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future license 
requests involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: 
 
--PM/DDTC received a request from the Government of Nigeria 
(GoN) for authorization to sell three C-130H aircraft to the 
Government of Senegal (GoS).  A pre-license Blue Lantern 
inquiry to Senegal officials revealed that GoS was not/not 
planning to purchase the aircraft from Nigeria. 
 
Furthermore, documentation included with GC 0997-09 revealed 
the re-titling of the C-130H aircraft from GoN (Ministry of 
Defense) to private entity A.D. Consultants (ADCON), Israel, 
without prior approval from DDTC. ADCON had been selected by 
GoN to broker the sale of the aircraft.  However, no 
documentation or contract between ADCON and GoN detailing the 
terms and conditions of the sale was included, nor was 
documentation on the source, type, and amount of any fees, 
payments, or other consideration that was to be paid to ADCON 
for brokering the transaction. 
 
--DDTC has not received any correspondence from GoN notifying 
DDTC of the canceled transaction or of current ownership 
status of the aircraft. 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post contact the 
Government of Nigeria to gather details regarding the 
canceled transaction and any potential new sale. 
 
The following points are included for guidance: 
 
--Please explain the current ownership status of the aircraft. 
 
--Who owns the legal title to the aircraft? 
 
--Where are the aircraft currently located? 
 
--Why did the GoN re-title the aircraft to ADCON? 
 
--Is the GoN aware that authorization from the Department of 
State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls is required for 
the retransfer of US-origin military equipment, including 
re-titling or retransfers to new end-users within Nigeria? 
 
--Would the GoN provide contractual or other documentation 
identifying the terms and conditions of sale of the C-130H 
aircraft to ADCON? 
 
--To date, has any money been exchanged for the aircraft? 
 
--To date, have any fees or commissions been paid? 
 
--Does GoN intend to sell the aircraft to a different 
end-user? 
 
--Will ADCON broker any potential sale? 
 
--Who will refurbish the aircraft should a sale be finalized? 
 Will ADCON be responsible for the oversight and payment of 
the refurbishment? 
 
END ACTION.
