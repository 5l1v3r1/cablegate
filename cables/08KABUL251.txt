SUBJECT: PRT KANDAHAR: WOMEN PROTEST KIDNAPPING OF AMCIT 
 
¶1. (U) Approximately 500-600 women demonstrated in Kandahar 
City on January 29 to protest the January 25 kidnapping of 
American Cydney Mizell, who was working for an international 
NGO in Kandahar.  In addition to calling for the immediate 
release of Mizell and her Afghan driver, demonstrators urged 
mullahs to condemn the kidnapping and speak out on women's 
rights.  The women also urged foreigners to stay in close 
contact with the GIRoA for their protection.  The 
demonstration received both international and local media 
coverage. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The event was prompted by Kandahar Governor Khalid's 
January 28 meeting with the Director of Women's Affairs and 
several female members of the Provincial Council.  Governor 
Khalid charged each of the women with gathering "like-minded" 
women to attend the demonstration.  The Governor also 
arranged to pay for use of the private hall where the 
demonstration was held. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Governor Khalid is under pressure from 
President Karzai to resolve the kidnapping and realizes he 
must be seen to be acting to address the issue.  While the 
women's demonstration may have been pre-planned rather than 
spontaneous to create an impression of widespread public 
concern, there is no doubt that the Governor, Provincial 
Police Chief, NDS Director, and all of their subordinates 
desperately want to resolve the kidnapping and are doing 
everything in their power to accomplish this goal.
