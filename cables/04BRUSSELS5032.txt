 In response to inquiry in para. 6 reftel, both DOJ Senior 
Counsel Mark Richard and USEU/NAS Frank Kerber will be 
involved in the process of preparing for the instrument 
signings in Brussels.  However, given that Richard has been 
requested to accompany the Attorney General during his entire 
trip to Europe, Kerber will likely be primary USEU action 
officer for this event.  Schnabel
