REF: STATE 148531 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Czech MFA Director of Southern Europe and Eastern 
Europe, Tomas Szunyog, thanked us for our comments related to 
the PKK (reftel). Szunyog noted that the Czech government 
takes this topic seriously and acknowledged that the Czechs 
have been in touch with the Turkish Embassy to discuss the 
matter, particularly with respect to the existence or transit 
of any PKK members in or through the Czech Republic.  No PKK 
members in the Czech Republic have come to the attention of 
either government.
