SUBJECT: GERMAY NOT CERTAIN OF PARTICIPATION IN SEOUL 
GLOBAL INITIATIVE CONFERENCE 
 
REF: A. STATE 22354 
     ¶B. STATE 18574 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Econoff met with German MFA Assistant Desk Officer 
Marc Hinrichsen, Russian Federation First Secretary Dmitri 
Cherkaschin and Korean First Secretary Won-jae Lee. 
Hinrichsen said he would pass the Ref B invitation for the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) 
workshop in Seoul to relevant experts in the Federal Office 
of Radiation Protection (part of the Ministry of the 
Environment) and legal authorities.  Germany's participation 
would be at the expert level, Hinrichsen said, but depends on 
the availability of personnel to travel to Seoul.  Hinrichsen 
stated he should know by the Ref B deadline if Germany will 
participate and will notify Econoff and the Korean host POCs. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  With respect to the Exercise Planning Group (EPG) 
discussed in Ref A, Hinrichsen said that if Germany 
participates in the workshop, it would also participate in 
the EPG.  As the EPG focuses more on the future direction and 
work of the GICNT, Germany,s participation in the EPG would 
come from their E Embassy in Seoul.  Hinrichsen also 
commented that the EPG is a good idea, as it will focus the 
work of the GICNT.
