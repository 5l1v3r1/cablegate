¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade 
Controls Compliance (PM/DTCC)requests Posts' 
assistance in conducting a pre-license check 
on application 050139416 for the export of 
electronic components and spare parts to 
Azerbaijan. Posts are requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.

to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request:  Confirm bona fides of 
transaction; diversion concerns. 
 
¶4. Action Tel Aviv:   Department requests that Post 
contact Foreign Consignee Elbit Systems, Tadiran to 
confirm its role in the proposed transaction, and 
determine whether or not it has proper supporting 
documentation, including purchase orders from the 
Azerbaijan MOD.  Ask Elbit Systems-Tadiran if it is 
one of Azerbaijan MOD's regular suppliers/contractors, 
and obtain the specifics of any other contracts 
this entity currently holds with the MOD.  Emphasize 
that the unauthorized re-export or retransfer of 
United States Munitions List (USML) items is strictly 
prohibited. 
 
Action Baku:  Confirm that the Azerbaijan MOD ordered 
the exact type and quantity of USML items listed on the 
license application for the specific purpose from Elbit 
Systems-Tadiran.  Verify the foreign consignee's specific 
role in this transaction, and determine how long the 
Azerbaijan MOD has done business with this entity.  Ask 
the Azerbaijan MOD if Elbit Systems is one of its regular 
suppliers/contractors, and obtain the specifics of any other 
contracts this entity currently holds with the MOD.
