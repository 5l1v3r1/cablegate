Title- Obama believes in a regime that lies, arrests and spanks 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (6-23) by Joco Coutinho states: 
"....So far, the U.S. President persists in his deafening silence 
[about the situation in Iran]....But there are words that must be 
said so that thousands of people that are risking their lives know 
that the world is supporting them." 
 
Title- The virtual and the (real) blood [In Iran] 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (6-23) by Clovis Rossi notes: 
"...Today it is possible to physically close a country, but it will 
be virtually opened [thanks to the new technologies]. By good 
fortune." 
 
Title- Bric, Allegro ma non troppo 
 
Op-ed in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (6-23) by former 
Ambassador to the U.S. Rubens Barbosa says: "....There are few 
common interests between BRIC countries [Brail, Russia, India and 
China]....[the group] shoud be seen as a new player in the 
international scne, but it will take time to find the exact tone 
for its statements and te [best] way to insert itself in the 
world....Its voice, though, begins tobe heard, as evidenced by the 
international medi coverage.  [Nevertheless] it does not seem 
adequate to consider the BRIC as a crucial part of Brazil's Foreign 
Policy or to proclaim the death of th G7/G8, because it [the G7/G8] 
will remain alivefor a while...."
