SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO TREASURY DEPARTMENT NSDD 38 REQUEST 
 
REF: NSDD 38 Case Number TREAS-IND-21402-12222008 
 
¶1. Post supports and approves the addition of one full-time 
Department of Treasury (DOT) Staff, as outlined in ref A. 
 
¶2. This position will enhance the USG's in-country macroeconomic and 
financial sector analysis, support Indonesia's financial sector 
development, and increase Post's knowledge of and contract with 
International Financial Institutions.  The position will also 
enhance Post's ability to support Indonesia's work with the G20, 
particularly around reform of International Financial Institutions. 
The DOT position will also augment USG in-country efforts to reduce 
terrorist financing and curtail financial crimes. 
 
¶3. The DOT attach will report to the Deputy Chief of Mission or the 
Economic Counselor, as determined by the Chief of Mission.  The 
attach will coordinate closely with the Embassy's economic cluster 
team.  All submissions from the attach to the Embassy's front 
office will be coordinated in advance with the Economic Counselor. 
The DOT attach will also provide front-channel reporting on 
macroeconomic policy and financial sector trends. 
 
¶4. The position was not included in the 2008 MPP, as DOT has only 
recently reached an agreement with Post on the scope of work for the 
Treasury position. 
 
¶5. There is no Treasury staff in Jakarta currently, but the Mission 
has the space to house the one requested position with some 
reconfiguration of the Economic Section.  Post recommends initially 
hiring only one FSN given the space constraints in the Economic and 
Political FSN office.  The start-up and ICASS costs to the DOT for 
one position are as follows:
