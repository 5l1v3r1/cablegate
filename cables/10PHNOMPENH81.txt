¶1.  ESTHOff delivered Reftel materials to Suon Phalla, Deputy 
Director of the Cambodian CITES Management Authority, who 
distributed the U.S. proposals to relevant officials in the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) and 
Ministry of Environment (MOE) for comment.  Suon said that 
the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) would support the U.S. 
proposals on polar bears and bobcats.  He noted that he 
thought the RGC would also possibly support the shark and 
coral proposals, but that he needed official guidance from 
the Fisheries Administration. 
 
¶2.  Suon said that the RGC would support the U.S. proposal to 
hold a workshop on the status of the snake trade.  He had met 
with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service representatives at the 
last CITES Conference of the Parties (COP) and had discussed 
the proposal briefly.  He said he had raised a request to 
hold multiple workshops around the region, rather than just 
one workshop, and he recommended that any workshop on the 
Asian snake trade should include discussion on water snakes, 
which are exported from Cambodia to China in great numbers 
with little monitoring.  Suon said that at COP-16 or -17 the 
RGC would likely propose adding the water snake to CITES 
Appendix III. 
 
¶3.  Suon was not yet sure if a Cambodian delegation would 
attend the COP-15 meeting in Qatar, saying that participation 
would depend on funding from the CITES Secretariat in Geneva. 
 If funding becomes available, the Cambodian delegation will 
be comprised of:
