IDEOLOGICAL MESSAGE IN LIBERAL STRONGHOLDS 
 
REF: A. MANAGUA 0324 
 
     ¶B. 06 MANAGUA 1556 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Liberal mayor Bronley Alvarez reports that 
the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) is using 
assistance programs sponsored by Venezuela and Cuba to spread 
the message that the USG "does nothing" in Nicaragua and only 
the FSLN and its allies can alleviate poverty.  Alvarez fears 
that this strategy has won the FSLN many new friends in 
traditionally Liberal bastions such as Ciudad Dario, his 
municipality.  He agrees that the best way to check 
Sandinista advances is through unity of the Liberal 
opposition and has organized a meeting for 26 mayors with the 
Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) and dissident legislators 
of the Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC).  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Poloff met with Ciudad Dario (Matagalpa Department) 
mayor Bronley Alvarez on February 26 to discuss the political 
activities of the FSLN in outlying departments.  Alvarez 
commented that the FSLN is using a Cuba-sponsored literacy 
campaign and a Venezuela-sponsored lightbulb exchange program 
to spread a message in "Liberal territory" that the U.S. has 
abandoned Nicaragua and that the rural population can only 
count on the FSLN and their allies for help alleviating 
hunger and poverty.  Now that all of the official government 
municipal assistance programs are in the hands of the 
Sandinistas, the Liberal mayors "have their backs against the 
wall," he said.  (Note: Alvarez was a leader of the PLC 
mayoral revolt against Arnoldo Aleman prior to the November 
elections -- see ref B.  The lightbulb exchange program was 
"borrowed" from the ALN's election campaign.  End Note.) 
 
¶3. (C) Alvarez added that U.S. assistance is often 
"invisible" because the NGO partners take all the credit.  He 
only learned about considerable U.S. aid to the northern 
departments of Matagalpa and Jinotega after attending a 
USAID-organized presentation with the Ambassador in Santo 
Tomas last year.  Alvarez urged the U.S. to better publicize 
its programs and activities in the region. 
 
¶4. (C) Alvarez agreed that the only way to block the FSLN 
political juggernaut is to achieve Liberal unity.  To this 
end, he organized a meeting of 26 mayors opposed to the 
leadership of corrupt PLC caudillo Arnoldo Aleman with ALN 
leader Eduardo Montealegre and PLC "dissident" National 
Assembly deputies (he only identified Enrique Quinonez) to 
take place on February 28.  Alvarez commented that the PLC 
rank and file feel "cheated" by Aleman and the Liberals in 
general following the electoral defeat by the FSLN.  He said 
that the internal PLC elections called by Aleman are a 
"farce" used to legitimate his continued domination of the 
party. 
 
¶5. (C) Alvarez noted that Aleman has summoned the PLC mayors 
to a meeting at El Chile (his hacienda) on March 1 to "bring 
them in line."  He commented that Aleman's modus operandi is 
to threaten dissidents with persecution through the judges he 
controls, but that Liberals' fear of Ortega's totalitarianism 
is beginning to outweigh their fear of Aleman.  Alvarez 
concurred, however, that a significant number of mayors and 
deputies will never break ranks with the caudillo because 
"they owe their power to Aleman." 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: We will continue to work with courageous 
leaders such as Alvarez to encourage Liberal unification 
through a transparent, consultative process free of Aleman's 
influence.  The ALN and PLC dissidents must capitalize on the 
Liberals' disenchantment with the caudillo before Ortega 
allows him to consolidate his power (by altering his "medical 
parole" status to allow him to travel throughout the country, 
for example).  Ambassador has made numerous trips throughout 
Nicaragua to highlight USG assistance and the benefits of a 
friendly relationship; however, we will identify new 
opportunities for public outreach.
