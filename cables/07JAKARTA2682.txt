REF: Jakarta 1657 (Energy Dialogue Back On Track) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Director General of Oil and Gas Luluk Sumiarso told us on 
September 20 that he liked the USG proposed agenda for the bilateral 
Energy Policy Dialogue (EPD).  He expressed particular appreciation 
for the mix of Government-to-Government and Government-to-Business 
modules.  Luluk stressed that he wants his tenure as DG to be noted 
for his inclusiveness of business and transparency in his dealings 
with them. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The GOI is not willing, however, to proceed with the 22-25 
October time frame, originally proposed by DOE PDAS Kathrine 
Fredriksen during her June visit to Jakarta.  Luluk also stressed 
that the GOI wishes to host the EPD in Denpasar, rather than 
Jakarta.  We reiterated our desire to have the largest, most 
comprehensive U.S. delegation possible and said that holding the EPD 
in Jakarta would promote that goal.  We sense their fixation on the 
Bali venue is due to an edict from the highest levels of government 
to help the tourism sector in Bali which has been taken a deep 
plunge in the last few years. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In any event, Luluk said the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources must use a competitive tender process for the contract to 
manage the conference.  For that reason, he said he doubted the GOI 
would be ready to host the EPD by 22 October.  They have 
counter-proposed the dates of 14-16 November.  Luluk had also 
proposed 29 and 30 November, but we expressed our concern about the 
proximity to the dates for the UN COP-13 environment conference.  We 
fear that the EPD will get lost in the shuffle of their preparations 
to receive 10,000 visitors for the UN meeting the following week. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Luluk said he appreciated the suggestion from DOE's Tom 
Cutler regarding an Aceh event or theme for the EPD.  He said he 
would put this in front of the Minister for his decision and get 
back to us.  With the departure of Edy Hermantoro to a new job, our 
new working level contact for the EPD is Nita Wartini, Deputy 
Director of Oil and Gas Cooperation, who struck us as very worthy 
successor to Edy.
