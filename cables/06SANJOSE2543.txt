RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 184156 
 
¶1. (SBU) Late afternoon of November 7, Polcouns discussed 
reftel talking points regarding the Cuba embargo resolution 
and the proposed Australian human rights amendment with 
Antonio Alarcon, chief of staff for Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Bruno Stagno.  Post also delivered talking points to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with the 
discussion.  Alarcon indicated that he would consult with 
vice-Minister Edgar Ugalde and Director of Foreign Policy 
Jose Chaverri before responding. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 8, 12:30 P.M. EST, Alarcon told Polcouns 
that Ugalde and Chaverri were still considering the matter. 
When reminded that the vote on the resolution was scheduled 
to take place shortly, or had already taken place, Alarcon 
elaborated a little further.  He said that the human rights 
aspect of the Australian amendment gave the Cuban embargo 
debate a "new dimension" from the GOCR,s perspective, in 
light of Costa Rica,s strong support for human rights in 
general.  Alarcon added, however, that Costa Rica,s support 
for human rights should take place "in the appropriate fora," 
and that any GOCR position on the embargo issue should be 
consistent with the anti-embargo position Latin American 
countries, including Costa Rica, agreed to during the 
November 3-5 Ibero-American summit. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Alarcon was politely signaling that the 
GOCR will not oppose this year,s Cuban embargo resolution 
(and probably will not abstain, either).  In light of the 
importance to the Arias government of gaining a UNSC seat for 
the 2008-2010 term, we anticipate continued Tico reluctance 
to take actions that go against the flow in the UNGA.
