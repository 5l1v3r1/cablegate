The Government of Morocco responded to the humanitarian 
crisis in Haiti by committing to transport at its own expense 
two C-130 aircraft containing 20 metric tons of relief 
supplies and medicine, valued at more than USD 1 million, to 
Port au Prince.  Embassy Rabat has been in frequent contact 
with the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs to 
facilitate delivery and, per reftels, to express our 
gratitude for Morocco's quick, generous response.  We 
understand that Morocco's two C-130s arrived in Haiti the 
afternoon of January 17 and successfully delivered the 
donations.
