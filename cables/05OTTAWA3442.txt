PA Calgary and nominee Gerry Bourdeau have outlined  goals 
for his program as follows: 
--to develop a better understanding of U.S. Government 
(including federalism, the role of  Congressional district 
offices, the function of Congressional committees); 
--the role of PACs, NGOs, and think tanks in advancing 
issues and shaping policies, and the role of lobbyists (both 
at the federal and state level); 
--the relationship between cities, state governments, and 
the federal government; 
--opposition parties, and the growth and development of 
grassroots parties (meetings both with the current 
opposition in Congress, the Democrats, and with fringe 
parties will provide insight into the two-party system and 
the influence of those within and outside the major 
parties); 
--the role of religion in U.S. politics 
 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Based on these goals and objectives, PA Calgary Rep, with 
research and input from Intern David Dill, have developed 
the following suggestions for appointments: 
Washington: 
--meetings with organization(s) that can provide an overview 
of federalism; the relationship of states to the federal 
government; state to state relations; Canada-U.S. relations 
(recommend Council of State Governments, Chris Sands at the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies at 
Georgetown, the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced 
International Studies/Johns Hopkins, David Biette at the 
Woodrow Wilson Center's Canada Institute).  As well Dr. 
Robert Stacey, Dean of Government for Patrick Henry College, 
has authored several books on federalism and English common 
law and has expressed interest in meeting with the deputy 
minister; 
-- A lobbying firm: DM Bourdeau might be interested in 
visiting Environmental Energy Lobbyists, as the Alberta 
government has recently tried to clean up its image of being 
soft on the environment. 
--Department of State, for meetings with Canada desk 
officers; 
--The American Association of Political Consultants; 
--Local think tank(s): the Brookings Institute, the Cato 
Institute, Heritage, or the American Enterprise Institute 
might be appropriate to give the DM insights into their 
work; 
--a meeting with the office of Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana. 
We specifically request this meeting with Senator Burns,  as 
it is our sense that he is key to re-opening the dialogue 
between these two neighbors.  Topics to cover would 
emphasize some of the positive aspects of the relationship, 
and areas in which positive collaboration have taken root 
(e.g. border security, energy, native issues, provincial- 
state organizations such as the Montana-Alberta Bilateral 
Advisory Council, water issues, and the CANAMEX-the trade 
route from Alberta to Mexico).  This purpose of this 
appointment is to subtly break the ice and re-establish 
important contact and dialogue between Alberta and Montana. 
--Congressional committee meeting(s): DM Bourdeau has 
requested the opportunity to sit in on a Congressional 
Committee session (we suggest the Energy Committee is 
particularly appropriate for a representative of the Alberta 
government, although the Committee on Agriculture would also 
be a good fit, assuming either of these is sitting at the 
time of his visit).  He would also like to take in a session 
of the full House or Senate; 
--visits to Congressional offices: since DM Bourdeau would 
like to visit Austin and Sacramento following Washington, we 
suggest meetings with senators or staffers from either Texas 
or California would be appropriate. 
--DM Bourdeau will no doubt make his own plans to drop in on 
the Alberta office at the Canadian Embassy, so a separate 
call on the Canadian Embassy is not necessary.   Post will 
coordinate timing for his Embassy call with program 
officers. 
Austin, Texas 
--State Capitol: meetings with counterparts in 
intergovernmental relations; sitting of the State 
legislature (if in session) 
--The Center for Public Policy in Austin: the center is an 
all-encompassing think tank/NGO/lobbying firm that should 
give the DM a better understanding of local politics; 
--Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum, which is located 
near the state capitol: A visit to the museum would give DM 
Bourdeau a better understanding of the development of Texas 
as a separate nation and then as a state; 
-- The Baptist General Convention of Texas has an office a 
few blocks from the capitol in Austin and would be 
interested in meeting with Mr. Bourdeau to discuss the role 
of religion in politics; POC is Suzii Paynter, director of 
Public Policy for the Convention. 
--A meeting with Phil Hardberger, San Antonio mayor: Mayor 
Hardberger can give the DM a view of the workings of a city 
government; as well, there may be other contacts in the city 
as a result of the 2004 Trade and Technology Summit in 
Calgary which representatives from San Antonio and Monterrey 
attended. 
DM Bourdeau has also asked to visit NASA in Houston; if an 
"insider's tour" exists, 
DM Bourdeau would enjoy such a program. 
Sacramento 
--State Capitol: meetings with counterparts in 
intergovernmental relations; sitting of the State 
legislature (if in session); 
--A grassroots political organization, such as a 2006 
legislative campaign in Sacramento. 
--An ethnic minority group, such as the Sacramento Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce or one of the numerous Hispanic PACs 
centered in Sacramento. 
--American Family Association: Scott Lively, President of 
the California chapter of this group, has offered to meet 
with DM Bourdeau if the opportunity arises. Mr. Lively has 
been instrumental in the founding of several conservative 
and religious PACs and NGOs; 
-- Green Party of California. While it may be a bit of a 
fringe party, a visit to this group would give DM Bourdeau a 
look at some of the exceptions to the two-party system in 
the U.S.; 
--Sacramento Town Council meeting: This would give the DM an 
opportunity to see the relationship between city and state 
governments.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Gerry Bourdeau is the highest-ranking civil servant in the 
office of International and Intergovernmental Affairs for 
the Province of Alberta.  As Deputy Minister (DM) in this 
office, Bourdeau is responsible for managing the important 
associations Alberta cultivates with other provinces, 
states, and federal governments around the world. 
The province of Alberta has the fastest growing economy in 
Canada, fueled by a booming oil and gas sector. And the 
United States depends on this flourishing industry.  Alberta 
is the energy capital of Canada, which supplies more than 
15% of crude oil and 16% of natural gas to the U.S.  As 
well, the development of the Athabasca Oil Sands (currently 
producing one million barrels of crude oil every day, the 
lion's share of which goes to the U.S.) will yield a sharp 
increase in the amount of oil Alberta produces in the near 
future, strengthening the province's position as the main 
producer of these important resources.  In a time when 
energy security is of critical concern, it is important to 
encourage and nurture the relationship between Alberta and 
the United States. 
From the northern perspective, no relationship is more 
important to Alberta than the one it shares with the United 
States; the province recognizes the significance of this and 
has taken steps to cement this connection.  Earlier this 
year, Alberta opened an office in Washington, located at the 
Canadian Embassy and headed by the former provincial energy 
minister.  The office of International and Intergovernmental 
Affairs works closely with the Washington office and with 
ConGen Calgary on a variety of issues including energy, 
agriculture, security and trade.  We find provincial 
officers eager to engage and advance the relationship, and 
ours has been a long-standing and positive one.  That said, 
we cannot let our relationship lag, especially with respect 
to energy during this critical time. 
The post's contact with DM Bourdeau has been limited to a 
few meetings over the five years he has been in his position- 
and Bourdeau himself does not have any substantial first- 
hand experience in the United States.  We hope that this 
Voluntary Visitor Project will give him a stronger focus and 
background on the United States, and will result in a closer 
relationship between an important provincial government 
official and U.S. colleagues and counterparts. We further 
hope that this exchange will present more opportunities for 
the United States to engage an important ally. 
Another important, more sensitive and subtle goal for this 
program revolves around a more rocky relationship.  Over the 
last few years, officials in Alberta and Montana have 
experienced a breakdown in communications.  Alberta 
government officials have told us, off the record, that the 
current state of communication between the province and the 
state is, at senior levels, virtually non-existent.  The 
recent BSE situation and subsequent action by Montana 
ranchers to bar beef and cattle imports from Canada, failure 
to attend and engage in cross-border meetings, and the 
frustration of Montanans who are living next to the 
economically-booming Alberta have all contributed to this 
breakdown.  Since they have so much in common, and since 
there are many on both sides of the border who would like to 
see the relationship get back on track, ConGen Calgary would 
like to quietly encourage the state and the province to get 
back to the business of business-and we believe that there 
may be an opportunity for DM Bourdeau to begin the process 
by calling on a federal legislator from Montana.
