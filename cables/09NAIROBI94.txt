¶1. (U) Summary:  With the election and inauguration of Puntland's 
president complete, Puntlanders remain pleased with Abdirahman 
Mohamed "Faroole," their new leader.  The inauguration took place on 
January 11 and was reportedly a well-executed ceremony punctuated by 
positive remarks from the outgoing president.  Contacts report 
Faroole is seen as a more decisive leader than his predecessor, and 
they hope his financial experience will lead to a strengthening of 
the Puntland economy.  End summary.

Peaceful Inauguration 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The January 11 inauguration of Puntland's new president, 
Abdirahman Mohamed "Faroole," was punctuated by encouraging remarks 
from outgoing president Mohamud Musse Hersi and the presence of 
recently-resigned Transitional Federal Government (TFG) President 
Abdullahi Yusuf.  Contacts report that all 66 Puntland MPs and many 
of the presidential candidates attended the ceremony, which was held 
at the presidential palace.  Outgoing president Hersi praised 
Faroole as "a close friend" and promised to work constructively with 
the new administration, emphasizing that his political career was 
not over.  Faroole praised Hersi for his accomplishments while in 
office and for having overseen a peaceful election at the designated 
end of his term.  To warm applause, Hersi handed over a file of 
papers he stated were documents crucial to the president, and also 
ceded eight armored vehicles and more than 200 soldiers who serve as 
the presidential security guard.

More Perspectives on Faroole 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Puntlanders continue developing perspectives on Faroole, who 
was not viewed as a front-runner in the weeks and days prior to the 
election.  Multiple contacts have labeled Faroole as "one of 
Puntland's educated elite."  Most contacts cite his political 
experience as an asset, though many offer the caveat that Faroole 
was suspected of corruption during his tenure as finance minister. 
Faroole's wife and children reportedly remain in Australia, which is 
where Faroole fled after failing to win the 2005 Puntland election. 
We are told that, to date, no clan-based groups have spoken out 
against Faroole's election. 
 
¶4. (U) Contacts tell us Puntlanders are optimistic Faroole's can 
improve Puntland's lot.  Observers say Faroole is more decisive than 
his predecessor, a trait they hope will lead to quick improvement in 
the region's security and economic situations.  Other contacts say 
Faroole is well-regarded since during his tenure as Finance Minister 
of Puntland, he was known for treating all areas of Puntland with 
equal respect and attention.
