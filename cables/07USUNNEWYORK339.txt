SUBJECT: WESTERN SAHARA: SECURITY COUNCIL RENEWS MINURSO 
MANDATE FOR SIX MONTHS; CALLS FOR DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS 
BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER UN AUSPICES 
 
 
¶1. The Security Council April 30 adopted a resolution 
extending the MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the 
Referendum in Western Sahara) mandate for a further six 
months to October 31, 2007.  In addition, the resolution 
takes note of both Moroccan and Polisario proposals for 
ending the political impasse, and calls on the parties to 
enter into direct negotiations under UN auspices.  The 
resolution asks the Secretary-General to report on the status 
and progress of the negotiations by June 30, 2007.  UNSCR 
1754 (2007), based on a draft developed and co-sponsored by 
Friends of Western Sahara (U.S., UK, France, Russia and 
Spain), passed by a 15-0 vote. 
 
¶2. Only South Africa delivered an explanation of vote (EOV). 
Delivered prior to the vote, South African PermRep Dumisani 
Kumalo criticized portions of the text as unbalanced, 
allegedly favoring Morocco over the Polisario.  Kumalo also 
complained that those members of the Security Council who are 
not members of the Friends of Western Sahara had not had 
sufficient time to consider the resolution.  Kumalo, 
concluded, however, that South Africa "reluctantly" supported 
the resolution because it believes in the importance of 
direct talks between the parties. 
 
¶3. Text of UNSCR 1754 (2007) follows:
