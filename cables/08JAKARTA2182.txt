Two Biodiesel Plants Begin Production 
------------------------------------- 
¶1.  The Deputy Minister for Research Science and Technology 
Development officially inaugurated two biodiesel plants in South 
Sumatra and South Kalimantan on October 27. The combined production 
capacity of the two plants is 12,000 liters per day.  The State 
Ministry for Research and Technology has also trained 21 technical 
school, college and university students to operate the plants. 
 
Jakarta Activates Flood Early Warning System 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶2. Jakarta's Emergency and Alertness Office announced that it has 
activated a flood early warning system.  The system includes five 
CCTVs monitored by Jakarta Crisis Center, 160 CCTVs monitored by the 
Traffic Management Center of the Metro Jaya Police Office, 
communication systems using radio and telephone lines, regular 
removal of waste from sewers and rivers, and a task force ready to 
establish emergency centers for refugees. 
 
Jakarta Needs $20 Million to Reduce Flooding 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶3.  Prijanto, Vice Governor of Jakarta Province, says that in order 
to prevent routine flooding, Rp. 20 trillion ($20 million) of 
improvements to upstream-downstream environment and infrastructure 
is needed in the 13 rivers that travel through Jakarta and West Java 
Provinces.  This will require cooperation with West Java Province 
and the Central Government.  Upstream forest degradation, silt 
buildup in rivers and lakes, and a lack of dams and canals cause the 
flooding. 
 
Seaweed for Biofuel 
------------------- 
¶4.  According to the Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, 
Indonesian seaweed production can be a significant source of 
biofuel.  One hectare of seaweed (microalgae) can produce 58,700 
liters of biodiesel per year.  The Government plans to revitalize 
the seaweed industry by targeting 1.9 tons of production in 2009 on 
25,000 hectares.  In response to the plan, the Governor of South 
Sulawesi stated that his province would provide the area for growing 
seaweed. 
 
Provinces Target Forest Carbon Trade 
------------------------------------ 
¶5.  Governor Gamawan Fauzi of West Sumatra submitted a carbon trade 
plan on October 13 to the provincial House of Representatives 
(DPRD).  In the plan, the projected income from carbon per hectare 
is Rp. 1,404,000 ($127.64).  West Sumatra has 692,448 hectares of 
protected forests spread across 11 regencies/cities, potentially 
generating income of Rp. 972 billion ($88.36 million) per year. 
 
Lampung Province is also preparing to trade carbon credits from its 
protected forests (317,615 hectares spread across five regencies). 
Forest conservation has been difficult because of illegal logging 
and encroachment.  Carbon Strategic Global Ltd (CSG) and IBN 
(International Bank of Australia) are offering to help with 
protection of the carbon-traded area in Lampung and West Sumatra 
provinces, including the administration of forest guards and 
surveillance, recruiting forest rangers, and training local people.

Wehea Forest Receives International Award 
----------------------------------------- 
¶6.  Wehea Forest Management in East Kalimantan came third (and 
received $1,000) in the Schooner Prize Award competition in 
Vancouver, Canada.  760 orangutans live in Wehea forest according to 
a Nature Conservancy (TNC) study.  Niel Makinuddin, Program Manager 
of The Nature Conservancy in East Kalimantan, partner of the 
USAID-funded Orangutan Conservation Services Program (OCSP) notes 
that good cooperation among indigenous people, local government and 
the private sector is vital for forest management. 
 
Development of Artificial Coral Reefs 
------------------------------------- 
¶7.  The West Kalimantan Marine and Fisheries Office began planting 
artificial coral to rehabilitate coral reefs damaged by bombing and 
potassium use by.  According to Sigit Sugihardi, project consultant, 
the project is using technology developed by BPPT (Agency for 
Assessment and Application of Technology).  The project area covers 
40 square meters with a depth of 8-10 meters. The project also 
includes educating fishers about alternatives to potassium use and 
bombing for fishing activities. 
 
Jakarta Loses 20 Million M3 of Water Each Month 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶8.  Jaya Haryadi Priyohutomo, President Director of the regional 
water utility company PAM Jaya announced that the company loses 20 
million cubic meters of drinking water every month.  The loss is due 
to leakage, inadequate and old pipes, unstable land conditions, and 
illegal connections.  According to Haryadi, 62 percent of Jakarta's 
7 million are PAM Jaya customers. 
 
KPK Investigates Members of Parliament 
-------------------------------------- 
¶9.  The Commission for Combating Corruption (KPK) investigated 10 
members of the House of Representatives for a corruption case 
involving the conversion of a mangrove forest to a small port in 
South Sumatra.  The House members admitted receiving payments for 
expediting the conversion permit and several of them have returned 
the money to the KPK. 
 
South Sulawesi Hopes to Reduce Forest Destruction 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶10.  The head of South Sulawesi's forestry office said that the 
provincial government plans to reduce forest destruction by 30 
percent.  To accomplish this, the government is allocating 500 
rangers and Rp. 300 billion for rehabilitation of damaged forests. 
 
Mangrove Trees Planted on Surabaya Beach 
---------------------------------------- 
¶11.  500 Indonesian Navy personnel and many local residents planted 
mangrove trees at Wonorejo beach, which is home to over 140 species 
of birds.  Muhlas Udin, a Surabaya city official, appreciated their 
participation in mangrove restoration and welcomed the increased 
awareness of global environmental issues. 
 
South Sulawesi Launches a "Go Green" Movement 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶12.  Governor Syharul Yasin Limpo of South Sulawesi launched "Go 
Green South Sulawesi" and declared Jompie Parepare a forest model. 
This 13.3-hectare forest is located in the northern part of Parepare 
city and has approximately 137 species of plants and dozens of 
traditional plantations.  The Governor said preservation of the 
forest would help reduce global warming.  He promised to provide 
10,000 seedlings and urged people to plant trees. 
 
HEALTH 
------ 
 
Inadequate Quality Control of Medical Equipment 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶13.  Indonesia Agency for Supervision of Health Facilities (BPFK) 
has only four offices, located in Medan (to service Sumatra), 
Jakarta (to service West Kalimantan and West Java), Surabaya (to 
service East Java and Central, South, and East Kalimantan) and 
Makassar (to service eastern Indonesia).  BPFK conducts quality 
control of health equipment -- in particular, calibrating medical 
instruments.  BPFK offices in Surabaya and Tugijono admit struggling 
to improve services because of limited skills, staff, equipment, and 
an inadequate budget.  For example, the Surabaya BPFK office 
provides services for 7 provinces and 150 hospitals with only 27 
 
JAKARTA 00002182  003 OF 003 
 
 
officers.  BPFK is trying to improve its capabilities by cooperating 
with the Indonesian Institute of Sciences and international 
standardization agencies. 
 
High Malnutrition Rate in Madura 
-------------------------------- 
¶14.  Malnutrition rates among infants remain high, according to the 
East Java Health office.  In 2007 the malnutrition rate was 5.1, 
4.9, and 4.2 percent in the Pamekasan, Sampang and Bangkalan 
regencies, respectively.  According to Dr. Susianto, head of the 
Sumenep health office, there have been around 490 cases of 
malnutrition there in the last three years. 
 
Infant Malnutrition in East Java 
-------------------------------- 
¶15.  M. Moeljono, head of the East Java health office, said that 
16.5 percent of the approximately 3.1 million babies in East Java 
(or 511,500) are malnourished due to improper care and diseases.  In 
an effort to reduce child malnutrition, the U.N World Food Program 
is providing healthy food and medical assistance. 
 
Industrial Waste Contaminates Paddy Fields 
------------------------------------------ 
¶16.  The harvest has failed on at least 18 hectares of rice fields 
in four villages in East Java because of contaminated irrigation 
water.  Kateman, a local farmer, said that due to the poor quality 
of irrigation water, his field only produced 3 tons of rice but has 
the potential of 7-8 tons.  A representative of Posko Ijo, an 
environmental NGO, reported that there are 10 industries around 
these paddy fields without liquid waste processing infrastructure. 
 
 
North Jakarta Vulnerable to TB 
------------------------------ 
¶17.  According to the North Jakarta Community Health Office and the 
Infectious Diseases Unit, 3,321 citizens of North Jakarta have 
tested positive for tuberculosis (TB) in the first nine months of 
¶2008.  Though the figure is lower than in 2007 (4,079), it is still 
considered high. A carrier can infect 10-15 persons that live around 
him/her.  Of the 3,321 new TB cases, 832 are BTA plus (bacterial 
tuberculosis active plus) triggered by bad environment, infection, 
and smoking.  Health care officials hope that more than 85 percent 
of patients recover after a six-month routine treatment.
