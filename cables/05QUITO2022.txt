STATEMENT 
 
¶1. .  "Pact with Venezuela - Let's Get Going," a 
column (08/29) in Guayaquil's conservative "El 
Telegrafo" (circ. 8,000) 
 
"The fiscal situation has been deteriorating for 
quite some time now.  The fundamental cause is the 
huge amount of money allotted in the budget for the 
so called service of the public debt. . . . What 
alternative sources for financing are available? . . 
. 
 
". . . The option offered by Venezuela must be taken 
seriously, because it is a good opportunity.  Despite 
its obvious benefits, no doubt the unconditional 
supporters of neoliberalism will put forward the 
`argument' that `Chavez is dangerous'. . . 
 
"No conditions have been placed on this - unlike the 
extremely harsh [conditions] constantly imposed on us 
by the IMF, World Bank, and others.  We should demand 
that negotiations with Venezuela go forward . and 
show the spirit of solidarity amongst the community 
of South American nations that everyone should 
support." 
 
¶2.  "Sowing Violence," a column (08/27) by Rene Mauge 
in Quito's leading centrist "El Comercio" (circ. 
70,000) 
 
Quote:  "It was not a simple `statement from a 
private citizen', as President Bush's spokesmen have 
said, rather it was a declaration from a preacher who 
has wide popularity in the U.S. and is a close friend 
of the President and Chief of the Pentagon. . . . 
 
"There is no doubt that the biggest concern for U.S. 
foreign policy is not so much Chavez, as the 
possibility of a unified South American continent 
seeking to defend its own interests and the promotion 
of sustainable development that will benefit its 
people."
