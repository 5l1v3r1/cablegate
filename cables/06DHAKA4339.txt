SUBJECT: BANGLADESH: LIMITED REACTION TO HOSTILITIES 
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND LEBANON 
 
 
¶1.    Bangladeshi reaction to the hostilities between Israel 
and Lebanon has thus far been muted.  Responding to media 
questions, a spokesman for the MFA condemned Israeli attacks 
and called on Israel to halt its "aggressive" actions.  The 
BDG has not issued a formal statement. 
 
¶2.    Media reporting is largely drawn from the major wire 
services.  Although most Bangladeshi newspapers have not yet 
commented on the hostilities, those that have are critical of 
the U.S. for failing to condemn Israel.  (Media reaction 
reported septel.) 
 
¶3.    Sources reported a few small protests following Friday 
prayers (July 14), with the largest attracting fewer than 
1500 participants.  By contrast, a rally that day by garment 
workers calling for implementation of recent labor agreements 
drew 3,500-4,000 participants.  The Islamic Constitution 
Movement held a small protest on July 15 and burned an 
Israeli flag.  They have announced another protest for July 
¶17.  Of the six public rallies announced for July 16, none 
was organized to protest the Israeli actions in Lebanon.
