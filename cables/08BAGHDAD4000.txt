¶1. (U)  This is an EPRT Baghdad reporting cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As many as 1857 families have returned this year to 
the once strife-torn district of Adhamiyah, according to GOI 
figures available at the end of November.  (Coalition figures 
differ slightly.)  The overwhelming majority of returnees are 
Shi,a and by far the majority of them have re-occupied 
family property or otherwise found housing in the district,s 
Sunni-dominated areas.  That said, CF elements of late have 
noticed an uptick in the number of Sunni returnees to Shi,a 
majority areas.  With a few isolated exceptions -- notably a 
killing and firebombing last sumer in the Shi'a Sha,ab area 
-- this steady stream of returnees has encountered little in 
the way of violence or trouble beyond the norm of 
administrative fumbling.  Even the administrative problems 
appear to be few, thanks to the efficient support provided by 
local government and the ISF.  National ministries are 
playing only a limited role. 
 
¶3. (SBU) There are several other signs of progress.  One of 
the most important, and celebrated, was the re-opening two 
weeks ago of a Shi,a-owned restaurant in the heart of &Old 
Adhamiyah,8 once an epicenter of AQI-inspired violence.  The 
decision to reopen was purely a business one:  unlike some of 
the smaller entrepreneurs in the area, the restaurant owners 
have not received a cent from either the Coalition or the 
GOI.  Just as encouraging has been the quiet opening of links 
between Shi,a sheikhs from Sadr City and the group of Sunni 
sheikhs linked to Old Adhamiyah,s paramount leader, Sheikh 
Azawi. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Local people are at long last taking the lead in 
promoting stability.  After months of wrangling, the 
Adhamiyah District Council decided on December 17 to begin 
meeting at a site in Qahirah, a mixed neighborhood on the 
border between the Sunni-dominated western and the Shi,a-led 
eastern area.  (Note:  The Army canal is the rough boundary 
between the two areas.)  This action will end the 
increasingly embarrassing situation of meeting at a neutral 
site -- FOB War Eagle.  Other local leaders are working to 
organize a &fun run8 through the district that starts at 
the Imam Bridge re-opened in early October.  The EPRT 
provided encouragement and NGO contacts, but minimal material 
support.  The EPRT also is supporting another tangible sign 
of progress, an effort by the Shi,a Qai Makam, a kindly 
gentleman from Sha,ab, to launch a soccer league in the 
western part of the district.  If all goes well, a 
representative of this league will soon be competing for the 
&Adhamiyah Cup8 against rivals from the east.
