SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA RELEASES STATEMENT ON NEW U.S. 
INITIATIVE ON IRANIAN NUCLEAR ISSUE 
 
REF: ANKARA 3172 
 
¶1. (U)  Following our conversations with Turkish officials 
yesterday on the new USG initiative on Iran (reftel), the 
Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) released a 
supportive statement on June 1. 
 
¶2. (U) Text of MFA statement.  Unofficial translation.  Begin 
text. 
 
The U.S. has announced that it is ready to participate in 
multiparty negotiations if Iran completely suspends, in a 
confirmable way, the uranium enrichment activities that are 
part of its nuclear program. 
 
Our country has always provided its utmost support to the 
efforts conducted by the international community in order to 
find a diplomatic solution to the above mentioned problem. 
 
We believe that responding to the U.S. proposal positively 
will strengthen the efforts displayed by the international 
community in finding a diplomatic solution to the problem 
which is linked with the Iranian nuclear program; will 
establish confidence and dialogue among the parties; and will 
contribute to regional and international security and 
stability. 
 
We hope that our neighbor Iran, as well as other interested 
parties, will value this opportunity and take steps that will 
enhance the efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the 
problem.  End text.
