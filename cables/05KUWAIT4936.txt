Local English daily the Arab Times reported November 29 that 
Iraqi Charge d'Affaires Hamed Al-Sharifi announced that the 
ITG will provide consular and other services from a temporary 
location in the Jabriya neighborhood until the chancery, 
renovated by the GOK, is ready for use.  He offered no 
comment on who would be the Iraqi ambassador to Kuwait.  A 
senior MFA official confirmed that Iraqi diplomats "recently" 
arrived in Kuwait, but had no additional information on the 
exchange of ambassadors.
