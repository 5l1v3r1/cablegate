COUNCIL 
 
REF: EUR/ERA E-MAIL 12/03/2009 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered ref points December 3 to MFA EU 
Correspondent Cyryl Kozaczewski, who responded with a summary 
of Poland's positions for this first EU Foreign Affairs 
Council (FAC).  With a view to establishing the EU as a 
global actor, Poland endorses all activities aimed at 
strengthening the EU's international role.  A strong union 
capable of coordinating policy is in the interest of all 
member states.  Poland's EU foreign policy priorities will 
emphasize the European Neighborhood Policy and Eastern 
Partnership, as well as strengthened civilian and military 
crisis management capabilities, and reinforced EU relations 
with key partners, third countries, and international 
organizations. 
 
WESTERN BALKANS 
 
¶2. (SBU) While a military presence in the Western Balkans is 
still required, Poland believes the EU should focus primarily 
on training and advisory activities.  Kozaczewski said Poland 
advocates a military withdrawal by mid-2010, but in the 
spirit of solidarity and responsibility for the success of 
the mission is ready to maintain its presence until November 
2010, if such a consensus emerges at the FAC meeting. 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kozaczewski said that in Poland's view, EU unity on 
the Middle East Peace Process should be "indisputable."  The 
EU message should encourage the parties to resume talks with 
the goal of reinvigorating the peace process, rather than 
setting up a predetermined solution.  This goal can only be 
achieved with balanced Conclusions.  Poland welcomes Israel's 
recent announcement of a temporary, partial settlement 
freeze.  However, if the process is to move forward, Israel 
must still meet its other Road Map commitments, to include a 
moratorium on all settlement activities in East Jerusalem. 
Poland is concerned that President Abbas has chosen not to 
run in the January 2010 Palestinian Authority elections. 
This could lead to a political crisis among the Palestinians, 
which would further undermine the peace process. 
 
BURMA 
 
¶4. (SBU) Poland supports a proactive EU policy with respect 
to Burma and an openness to dialogue with the Burmese 
government, according to Kozaczewski.  Poland attaches great 
importance to fostering the democratic process in Burma, 
viewing ASEAN engagement as a necessary component.  Poland 
also seeks increased humanitarian and development assistance 
from the international community as part of a long-term 
strategy to develop Burmese civil society.
