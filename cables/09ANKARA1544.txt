¶1. (SBU) On October 26, the GOT published the biotechnology 
regulation described in reftel.  The regulation is effective 
immediately (vice the 6 month implementation period reported 
earlier) and could affect up to USD 1 billion worth of U.S. 
agricultural exports.  Apart from the effective date, the 
published regulation differs only minimally from what was 
reported in reftel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 15, EEB/CBA Special Representative 
Lorraine Hariton raised the issue with Deputy Prime Minister 
Ali Babacan, and Ambassador Jeffrey followed up with a 
detailed letter to Babacan on the same day.  Subsequently, 
Ambassador Jeffrey has tried to reach Babacan by telephone 
and also requested a meeting with Agriculture Minister Mehdi 
Eker, who is in Saudi Arabia until October 28.  Sub-Cabinet 
officials have declined Ag Counselor's requests for meetings. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Turkish food and feed sector companies have all 
tried to lodge protests against the regulation with relevant 
officials.  Textile companies and cotton traders are also 
investigating whether cotton will be affected by the new 
rules.  Bizarrely, the regulation also calls for testing of 
wheat along with soy and corn, even though there is no 
genetically-engineered wheat in production. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request: Post believes USTR should consider 
an immediate request for WTO consultations in Geneva, as the 
regulation itself, as well as its publication without 
notification, violates many aspects of the Sanitary and 
Phytosanitary Agreement.
