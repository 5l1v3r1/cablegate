SUBJECT: DHRF FY2006 ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT -- ZIMBABWE 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) This message contains the annual summary report for 
Zimbabwe's FY2006 Democracy and Human Rights Fund (DHRF) II 
activities.  Post has in process/advanced $32,421 of the $60,000 in 
obligated FY2006 funds (none of the payments has been registered yet 
as liquidated by the USAID Financial Controller Office). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The political situation in Zimbabwe continues to 
deteriorate ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections 
scheduled for March 2008.  The Government is using widespread 
abductions, arrests, and torture to intimidate and harass opposition 
and civil society members and supporters.  The worsening operating 
environment has made it increasingly difficult for our DHRF grantees 
to maneuver, but all have assured us that they would increase their 
efforts to carry out their planned activities over the next few 
months. 
¶3. (SBU) We are working with the USAID Financial Controller Office 
to close-out all pre-FY2006 projects.  In the meantime, post has 
started receiving a number of promising DHRF project proposals for 
FY2007.  End Summary.

FEMINIST POLITICAL EDUCATION PROJECT 
Grant number: DHRF-06-613-01

Zimbabwe, and, based on the results, to publish a "Women's Yearbook" 
that analyzes and documents the status of women in Zimbabwe.  To 
obtain up-to-date literature in respect of the constitution, human 
rights, the independence of the judiciary and rule of law.

printing to be completed before September 2007. 
 
YOUTH INITIATIVE FOR DEMOCRACY IN ZIMBABWE (YIDEZ) 
Grant number: DHRF-06-613-02

Paul Siwela.  Over 700 youths from across the Matabeleland province 
area gathered to discuss one of the country's pressing civic issues 
-- the Zimbabwe National Water Authority's takeover of distribution 
of water to urban areas.  YIDEZ held this consultative discussion to 
inspire young people to take a more active role in local and 
national issues that affect them.  YIDEZ plans to hold its next 
workshop on June 16 in preparation for the Day of the African 
Child.

Previous Year Projects 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) We extended two grants, WOZA and ZIMCET, from FY2005 in 
order to give the grantees more time to complete their planned 
activities.  We are waiting for the final requests for reimbursement 
for the expenditures associated with these grantees.  Once the final 
payments are processed, we will work closely with USAID to close out 
these grants.  We are waiting for close-out confirmation from USAID 
on the other two FY2005 grants. 
 
¶6. (SBU) A description of our two open FY05 grantees follows below: 
 
 
Women of Zimbabwe Arise! 
Grant number: DHRF-05-613-02 
Description: to purchase equipment that will enable activists to 
capture and transmit images within Zimbabwe of their activities and 
the conditions they witness in order to counter government 
misinformation about the situation in the country. 
Amount obligated: $14,125.00 
Balance: $11,373.44 
Status:  Due to hyperinflation, the grantee was not able to purchase 
the proposed equipment within the budget in Zimbabwe, and post 
decided to purchase the equipment outside the country.  Post placed 
orders for the equipment for WOZA in 2006 and again in May 2007. 
Some of the equipment has arrived and been given to WOZA.  The 
remaining equipment is expected to arrive shortly.  Our delay in 
making the additional purchases was due to technical problems USAID 
experienced in receiving confirmation of liquidation from 
Charleston.  We have been working with USAID to resolve the matter 
and close out the project. 
 
Zimbabwe Civic Education Trust 
Grant number: DHRF-05-613-03 
Description: for radio programs, advertising, placement of articles, 
setting up a website, and purchase of equipment to produce 
educational materials to publicize its activities across Zimbabwe. 
 
Amount obligated: $10,425 
Balance: $7,114.01 
Status: ZIMCET purchased some equipment to produce educational 
materials to publicize its activities across Zimbabwe.  However, the 
group's work was delayed due to a turnover in management.  The 
previous director resigned and post decided not to provide 
additional funding until management issues were resolved.  At this 
point, we are still not confident that the group is ready to receive 
additional funding.  The agreement extension has expired and we have 
begun the close-out process.   DELL
