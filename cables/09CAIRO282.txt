¶1.  (U) In January 2009, the year-on-year change in the urban 
consumer price index (CPI) declined to 14.4%, its lowest rate in ten 
months, and down from 18.3% in December 2008 and 23.6% peak in 
August 2008, according to the official statistics agency CAPMAS. The 
decline is a result of the drop in the year-on-year change in most 
of the index items, with the biggest drop in th year-on-year change 
of food prices. Food price eclines are expected to continue, in 
part due to ower world market prices for commodities imported y 
the government, including for frozen chicken, il, rice, etc. 
 
¶2.  (U) Egypt's Central Bank (CB) Governor El Okdah had announced 
earlier this wek that a large decline in inflation could lead to 
more flexibility in monetary policy, but that negtive real interest 
rates continued to slow the dcision to cut interest rates to 
maintain a higher return for the large base of depositors in banks. 
Consistent with these comments, the Monetary Policy Committee 
reduced rates on February 12 by 100 pb, the first reduction in 
almost three years.  In its statement, the CBE noted that that a 
"less restrictive monetary policy is required...to stabilize 
economic growth around its potential."  The statement went on to 
remind investors that price stability remains the number one 
objective of the CBE, but that "the CBE would continue to take the 
necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global 
economic turmoil on the domestic economy."  The first business day 
after the rate announcement, the Egyptian stock exchange was up 2.65 
percent (although it still is down 22 percent this year). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: Since the start of the financial crisis, 
government ministers have become frustrated with the Central Bank's 
high interest rates.  Even President Mubarak seemed to complain 
about high interest rates in one of his policy speeches last fall. 
They argued that inflation is coming down, and that interest rates 
should as well.  Bank Governor El Okdah has argued that price 
stability is the CBE's monetary policy and he has asserted the CBE's 
independence by not reducing rates until this point.  The CBE has 
moved cautiously and fought the political pressure, as they waited 
for adequate evidence of a decline in inflation before cutting 
rates.  Given that Central Banks globally have had to loosen 
monetary policy as a tool to stimulate growth and demand, it is 
interesting that the Central Bank of Egypt held out so long. 
Several leading analysts anticipate that rates will fall further 
this year (perhaps another 200-300 pb) as inflation continues to 
decline. The most recent IMF Article IV review agreed, on balance, 
with El Ohdah's price stability approach.
