SUBJECT: WATER: GOI FEARS LACK OF PWA MAINTENANCE WILL 
EXACERBATE WEST BANK SHORTAGES 
 
¶1. (SBU) Keying on the April 2009 World Bank Assessment of 
Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector Development and in 
anticipation that water issues may be raised at the June 8-9 
Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) meeting, Lt. Col. Uri Singer, 
COGAT Deputy Foreign Relations Head called in EconCouns for a 
June 1 discussion of West Bank water issues. Singer noted 
that Israel has fulfilled its water obligations to the PA 
under the Oslo Accord. However, he said poor maintenance and 
mismanagement of existing facilities by the Palestinian Water 
Authority are worsening the already serious drought-induced 
shortages.  Singer cited five of eight water wells in 
Palestinian-controlled areas A and B that are non-operational 
because the PWA did not maintain them; the result is that the 
eight million cubic meters of water that these wells should 
be producing are not being pumped and distributed to the 
Palestinian people.  He also raised lax enforcement against 
illegal tapping of distribution systems and inadequate 
maintenance of distribution networks as serious issues that 
the PWA must address.  Finally, Singer noted that Ramallah 
residents are receiving one-third less water than they should 
because the PWA installed-pipes were the wrong size for the 
Ramallah network. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Singer criticized the April 2009 World Bank 
Assessment of Restrictions on Palestinian Water Sector 
Development's assessment of progress--or the lack 
thereof--regarding developments to meet future needs. The 
report cites 82 wells for which "the Palestinians ... have 
lodged an application" (paragraph 94 of the report, as well 
as Annexes), of which "to date, only three have been 
developed...however, these wells have never operated."  Of 
these 82, Singer said, only 24 are in Area C, i.e., under 
Israeli Civil Administration control.  Of those 24, three 
were approved by the Civil Administration; two applications 
were received in April/May 2009 and are currently under 
review; 17 were approved in concept, but the PWA has not yet 
submitted plans for approval; one plan was returned to the 
PWA for technical modifications, but was never resubmitted; 
and one was rejected on May 17th because it would service 
homes built illegally in Area C.  (NOTE: Prior to the release 
of the World Bank report, the Government of Israel raised 
specific objections, (embassy has a copy) but these were not 
reflected in the published report.  According to Singer, in 
post-publication discussions, the World Bank's David Craig 
offered to revise the annexes, but not the text that referred 
to the annexes, a proposal which the GOI found insufficient. 
END NOTE). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Singer explained, "the PWA is politically motivated, 
not job-oriented," and politics are negatively impacting the 
PWA's ability to distribute water to West Bank residents. He 
warned that the PA needs to remedy as many of these problems 
as possible as soon as possible, or this summer's water 
shortages will undermine public support for the PA, a 
situation Singer said the GOI wants to avoid.  Singer urged 
that donors place an emphasis on technical assistance on 
maintenance in upcoming contributions, preferably by linking 
equipment and parts donations to training and scheduled 
maintenance requirements.
