REF: STATE 176793 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) The Czechs will oppose the two resolutions on the 
situation of human rights and children in Lebanon sponsored 
by Non Aligned Movement (NAM) members in the Third Committee 
of the UN General Assembly. Poloff discussed the resolutions 
and reftel talking points with Czech MFA Director of the UN 
Department Jan Kara and Deputy Director of the Human Rights 
Department Martin Boucek, separately, on October 24 and 25. 
Kara and Boucek said the Czechs agree with the U.S. position 
that the proposed resolutions are unbalanced and unhelpful. 
Because the co-sponsors have refused to amend or withdraw the 
resolutions, the Czechs will vote against them "as usual." 
Boucek also said the Czechs have encouraged the EU to adopt a 
common position against the resolutions.
