SUBJECT: MINI-DUBLIN GROUP MEETING IN BRASILIA -- NOVEMBER 2007 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  On November 19, 2007, under the chairmanship of the 
Government of Spain, the Mini-Dublin Group convened at the Spanish 
Embassy to discuss counter narcotics assistance and cooperation 
between member countries and the Government of Brazil (GoB).  This 
was the first time the group had gathered since November 2005. 
Participants included representatives from several European Union 
countries, Canada, Japan, the European Commission, the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States. 
Following the closed meeting of the group, the head of Brazil's 
Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD), General Paulo Uchoa, as well as 
representatives from the National Secretariat of Public Security 
(SENASP) and the Federal Police, made presentations to the group. 
The Brazilian participants expressed appreciation for USG support, 
noting that NAS assistance has helped the GoB advance its 
counter-narcotics and drug demand-reduction efforts.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The Spanish DCM and Chair of the meeting, Miguel Gomez de 
Aranda, opened by stating that it was unfortunate that no 
Mini-Dublin meeting had taken place during 2006, noting that the 
last meeting had taken place on November 17, 2005. 
 
----------------------------- 
UNODC OVERVIEW OF DRUG TRENDS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Giovanni Quaglia, country director for UNODC, presented 
information collected by the UN on the global supply of cocaine and 
other illicit drugs between the years 1995-2005.  According to the 
World Drug Report, the illicit drug market has stabilized at around 
US$ 320 billion per year.  Likewise, there has also been a 
stabilization of coca production worldwide.  During the same period, 
cocaine seizures worldwide have increased.  In Brazil, cocaine use 
is climbing, and Brazil has reported the third-largest number of 
users, after the United States and Spain.  Quaglia also reviewed 
trafficking trends for major illicit drugs, and observed that 
cocaine trafficking from Latin America to Europe via Africa is 
increasing, as is ecstasy trafficking from Europe to Latin America.

VARIOUS BILATERAL PROGRAMS IN BRAZIL 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  Other representatives described their programs: 
 
¶A.  Portugal described Brazil as one of the principal transit 
countries of cocaine produced in South America and destined for 
Europe, with Portugal as the primary point of entry.  Consequently, 
Portugal and Brazil maintain ongoing cooperation at the police 
level, facilitating significant operations that have resulted in 
arrests and seizures.  Both countries enjoy an agreement of 
cooperation, established in 1992 and modified in 2004, on combating 
the production of illicit drugs and promoting demand reduction 
efforts. 
 
¶B.  Spain has organized and hosted six regional seminars on 
counter-narcotics, which included the participation of 12 Brazilian 
officials, designed to improve technical capabilities and share best 
practices.  Moreover, Spain plans to hold a seminar in Brasilia in 
December 2007, in cooperation with the Brazilian Federal Police, on 
synthetic drugs and trafficking through airports.  In the field of 
drug prevention, two Brazilian non-government organizations (NGOs) 
participated in the annual Ibero-American Network on drug addiction 
to study health and education in relation to drug consumption and 
its mental effects.  Additionally, Spanish and Brazilian police 
routinely cooperate on joint operations, investigations of mutual 
interest, and intelligence exchanges. 
 
¶C.  The United Kingdom, although not present, submitted a brief 
report stating that through the British Embassy in Brasilia, the 
British Government has funded a series of programs with the 
Brazilian Federal Police aimed at increasing their capacity to fight 
drug trafficking.  The programs have included training and the 
 
BRASILIA 00002158  002 OF 002 
 
 
provision of equipment for surveillance and the profiling of air 
passengers.  The British also have a significant program aimed at 
reducing trafficking through Brazil's ports.  This has included 
training and providing equipment for profiling and searching 
containers, and improving techniques for searching ships.   The 
British officers of the Serious Organized Crime Agency, based in 
Brasilia and Sao Paulo, have been integral to the delivery of these 
programs, which complement their active operational partnership with 
the Federal Police. 
 
¶D.  As USG representative, the NAS Director re-iterated that the GoB 
and USG have maintained close cooperation to develop and implement 
counter-narcotics, anti-crime, and border control programs that 
minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs.  He 
outlined INL assistance to Brazil, and briefly described the 
U.S.-Brazil letter of agreement (LOA), noting that the USG will 
implement an updated strategy that addresses changing policy 
priorities of both countries and also makes the bilateral 
counter-narcotics law enforcement efforts more effective and cost 
efficient. 
 
-------------------------- 
BRAZIL'S ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  During the second part of the meeting General Paulo Uchoa (the 
Brazilian Drug Czar) and Paulina Duarte from SENAD gave a 
presentation on the history of Brazil's demand reduction and 
treatment efforts.  Both presenters expressed gratitude for 
longstanding cooperation provided by Portugal and the United States. 
 SENAD has a three-pronged approach to drug prevention: diagnosing 
the problems, promoting capacity-building, and implementing its 
strategy.  In other words, by conducting diagnostic studies through 
surveys, training educators and key law enforcement officials, and 
by maintaining and replicating systems and programs that are 
working, SENAD believes it is on the road to drug prevention 
success.  While past surveys have focused on general drug and 
alcohol abuse, SENAD now wants to study the student and prison 
populations in order to formulate a more accurate quantitative and 
qualitative baseline from which to direct future efforts.  SENAD 
hopes to expand the D.A.R.E. program and operate the toll-free 0800 
telephone hotline 24 hours per day in order to reach a broader 
audience and better serve the Brazilian population. In closing, 
Duarte praised USG support for training educators at the University 
of Brasilia and Federal Police agents in drug prevention methods and 
practices, noting that NAS support has been a key component to 
advancing GoB efforts.
