¶2. (U) Afghans are now in the phase of vote counting, retrieval, and 
transport.  The atmosphere in Kabul and elsewhere remained calm and 
quiet overnight.  PRTs are paying particular attention to the 
transport process and will report abnormalities in the following 
sitreps. 
 
RC South: 
 
-- Nothing new to report. 
 
RC-East: 
 
-- RC-East reported this morning that in Wardak and Logar, two air 
recon trips were carried out on August 20, one in the early morning 
and another in the mid-afternoon.  There was very little activity on 
the roads.  The primary mode of transport used by the population was 
bicycle or on foot. Barely any cars were seen throughout both 
provinces.  No lines or crowds were seen at any polling centers. It 
was eerily quiet. 
 
RC North: 
 
-- Nothing new to report.

Voter Turnout 
------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Provincial reports by region follow: 
 
RC South: 
 
-- Nothing new to report. 
 
RC East: 
 
-- The highest turnout was in Khost City, Gardez, Zormat (Paktya), 
Sharana, Bermel and Khayr Khot (in Paktika), according to initial 
reports.   Given the insurgent attacks on the morning of August 20 
in Naka district center and Combat Outpost Zirok, turnout in Naka, 
Zirok and Gerda Serai (Haqqani's home district) was higher than 
expected, perhaps due to recent increases in the number of ANSF 
stationed in those areas.  Female voters also defied predictions by 
coming out to vote in respectable numbers in Khost City, Orgun, 
Sharana, Terwa and Waza Khwa. 
 
-- The assessment is that 37 percent of the population in Wardak and 
26 percent of the population in Logar participated in the election. 
There was poor voter turnout in Sayed Abad, Chakh, Jaghato, and 
Nerkh for Wardak province.  In Logar there was a poor turnout in 
Baraki Barak at only five percent.  On the positive side in Wardak, 
the districts with highest turn out were Jalrez and the two 
Beshood's reported in at 90 percent and Mayden Shah reported in at 
80 percent.  In Logar, voter turnout was highest in Mohammad Agha 
and Khoshi districts, which reported in at 60 percent.

Security 
 
--------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ANSF and ISAF conducted security operations coordination 
for the elections in an unprecedented manner.  There were more 
security incidents than on a typical day in Afghanistan, but the 
people were allowed to vote.  It will take approximately three days 
to collect tally sheets from the Provincial level to transport back 
to IEC Headquarters in Kabul.  The emphasis by security forces is on 
the retrieval of ballots and making sure they are secured in 
Provincial warehouses through appropriated chain of custody.  It was 
suggested that QRF forces stay in place until ballots are safely 
secured.  Admiral Borsboom reiterated that air request to move 
ballots and election material is initiated by the IEC as a request 
to UNAMA.  If UNAMA cannot fulfill the air transport request, then 
if falls on the shoulders of ANA.  If ANA can not conduct air 
transport, then ISAF forces would pick up the request.  All 
available air assets were used by ISAF and ANSF forces on Election 
Day.  The ISAF Elections Task Force will have a meeting at 2000 on 
Friday to discuss the post-election period and to conduct 
contingency planning for the possibility of a runoff election. 
 
¶5.  (U) Provincial reports by region follow: 
 
RC South: 
 
-- Nothing new to report. 
 
RC East: 
 
-- Predictions of a high number of suicide bombers in the AO did not 
prove accurate; only two reportedly detonated, in Gardez, causing 
only their own deaths. 
 
-- In Logar and Wadak, there were a total of 48 security incidents, 
many of which had multiple contacts within them.  There were 19 
accounts that were election based.

¶6.  (U) Provincial reports by region follow: 
 
RC South: 
 
-- Nothing new to report. 
 
RC East: 
 
-- In Jaji Ayroub, Paktya ballot, counting was reported completed by 
2000 on August 20. 
 
-- In Logar and Wardak there were a total of 142 sites that were 
opened, with 132 actually used.  Thirteen were abandoned by IEC or 
ANA.  Three were abandoned on the evening of August 19 by IEC 
because the polling sites were in areas that had heavy contact the 
night before.  However, they were reopened by 1000 on August 20. 
The majority of the polling sites were closed by 1600, with a few 
outliers in both provinces remaining open until 1700.  The IEC 
confirmed all were closed at 1700.

¶8.  (U) AFGHAN MEDIA HIGHLIGHTS 
-- The leading story in the Afghan media was the continued coverage 
of the yesterday's press conference by President Karzai and the 
joint press conference by the IEC, MOD, MOI, and NDS. 
--Afghan media widely reported on the reactions by the leaders of 
the international community on the Afghan elections.  President 
Obama said that the Afghan presidential election appeared to have 
been a success and that the United States will continue to monitor 
the situation in Afghanistan.  He added that the international 
community must focus on finishing the job in Afghanistan, which is 
going to take some time.   UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that 
the Afghan people voted in the elections despite the threats by the 
Taliban.  Brown also said that this was the first time that 
Afghanistan's elections were Afghan led.  The French foreign 
minister appreciated the courage and the determination of the people 
of Afghanistan to vote in the elections.  UNAMA described the 
conduct of the presidential and provincial council elections as an 
achievement of the Afghan people.  NATO Secretary- General Anders 
Fogh Rasmussen hailed the vote as a testimony to the determination 
of the Afghan people to build democracy.  UN Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon also issued a statement congratulating the women and men of 
Afghanistan on the presidential and provincial council elections. 
-- Radio BBC reported that presidential candidate Ashraf Ghani 
Ahmadzai said that there were signs of fraud in Kandahar and there 
were also signs of use of force by specific candidates' agents to 
exert pressure on the local people to vote for a specific candidate 
in northern Afghanistan. 
-- BBC:  the IEC stated that the primary results of the elections 
will be announced in 12 days and the final results will be announced 
in four weeks. 
-- Pajhwok News Agency reported that 10 people were arrested on 
charges of distributing night letters in Paktia province. 
-- BBC radio interviewed General Petraeus in which he said that 
negotiations with the local insurgents should take place in 
Afghanistan and that high-ranking Taliban leaders such as Mullah 
Omar cannot be part of the negotiations.  He also said that there 
should be more focus on good governance in Afghanistan. 
-- Pajhwok News Agency reported that unofficial results indicate 
President Hamid Karzai and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah dominated the vote 
in Kabul and are virtually tied in a dozen or so polling station 
counts. 
-- Pajhwok News Agency reported that more than 1,341 prisoners, 
including 17 women, cast their votes in the presidential elections 
in Kabul, Khost and Parwan provinces on Thursday. 
-- Radio Salam Watandar reported that three employees of the IEC 
were fired from their posts due to fraud and alleged violations of 
regulations seen in their performance in Balkh province.
