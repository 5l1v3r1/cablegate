REF: (A) BUENOS AIRES 1695 (B) BUENOS AIRES 1420 
 
¶1. (U) As anticipated in ref A, Argentine Special Prosecutor 
Alberto Nisman on December 16 ordered the attachment of real 
estate property in Buenos Aires allegedly belonging to former 
Iranian Embassy Cultural Attache in Argentina Mohsen Rabbani, 
one of six Iranian suspects sought by Interpol at Argentina's 
request for participation in the 1994 bombing of the 
Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA). 
According to the press, the properties are located at 3387/95 
Gaona Avenue and 1111/35 Terrada in the Flores neighborhood, 
across the street from the Ezrah Jewish Hospital.  Nisman 
reportedly ordered the attachment in connection with the 
civil action (ref B) filed by an AMIA neighbor seeking 
compensation for damages. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Prosecutor Nisman told Legat on December 19 that he 
will subpoena and interview the occupants of five small-scale 
commercial establishments (a general store, a butcher, a 
pizzeria, a restaurant, and a telephone service center) and 
parking garage operating on the attached property to 
determine rents paid,contract details and other information 
of interest. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Nisman also confirmed for Legat that he had formally 
requested that the governments of Germany and France freeze 
four accounts worth USD 48 million.  One account with a 
balance of USD 38 million reportedly was in the name of 
Iranian former president Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani.  Nisman 
intends to seek to attach these funds on behalf of the AMIA 
victims' relatives, some of whom are pursuing civil 
litigation against Iranian officials for their role in the 
bombing.  Nisman further adivised that he will contact Judge 
Canicoba-Corral on December 22 or 23 to request authorization 
to amend his requests to Germany and France to include a 
claim for an additional USD 500 million in damges for the 
victims of the bombing and their families. 
 
¶4. (U) On December 18, President Cristina Fernandez de 
Kirchner visited the AMIA bombing site, at which 85 persons 
were killed, for her first time as President.  She had lunch 
with AMIA representatives, including President Guillermo 
Borger, and was accompanied by the Ministers of Justice and 
Interior, and promised the government's continuing efforts to 
bring the AMIA attackers to justice.  "This is a fight for 
justice and truth," she said, "and for the victims, because 
no one has the right to take another's 
life."  The head of the umbrella organization DAIA, the 
Delegation of Argentine Jewish Associations, Aldo Donzis, 
praised the good relations between the Jewish community and 
the Government of Argentina.
