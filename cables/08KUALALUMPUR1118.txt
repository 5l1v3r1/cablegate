Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Malaysian political leaders and press have reacted 
with angry rhetoric to Israeli air strikes in Gaza and 
heavily criticized the U.S. together with Israel.  The 
Malaysian government came out quickly to condemn the Israeli 
air strikes on Gaza, labeling this action as a "war crime" 
and calling for an immediate cease-fire, but refrained from 
explicitly highlighting U.S. support for Israel, at least in 
initial commentary.  Political parties, including all three 
parties in the opposition coalition, were not as restrained 
and strongly criticized both the U.S. and Israel.  The main 
Islamist opposition party organized a small and orderly 
demonstration at the Embassy on December 30, presented a 
letter holding the U.S. responsible for Israeli actions, and 
chanted "destroy Israel, destroy America."  Malaysia's 
mainstream media, including television and print, has focused 
extensive coverage on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and 
emotive, critical commentary on Israel's actions, as well as 
criticism of U.S. statements blaming Hamas.  Malaysia's 
government-affiliated Malay language press has been more 
strident in its anti-U.S. commentary.  A December 30 
editorial in the Malay language daily owned by the ruling 
UMNO party urged a boycott of U.S. products and withdrawal of 
deposits from U.S. banks, and suggested that support for 
"retaliation by militant Muslim groups" should not be ruled 
out. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Although far from Malaysia's shores, 
Palestine is the single most compelling international issue 
for the Malaysian public, particularly among the Malay Muslim 
majority.  Malaysia's response to the current Israel-Hamas 
conflict appears similar to the reaction we witnessed to the 
Israel-Hizbollah war in 2006 and the invasion of Lebanon, a 
reaction which featured sharp criticism of the U.S. and some 
demonstrations at the Embassy.  As Israeli military actions 
in Gaza continue or escalate, Malaysian politicians will be 
tempted to pile on with further anti-U.S. rhetoric and 
possibly stage more public protest actions.  The Malaysian 
government, however, has an interest in confining the Gaza 
reaction to the realm of rhetoric and not letting matters get 
out of hand.  There have been no indications of anti-U.S. 
sentiment affecting American citizen security in Malaysia at 
this time.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
Malaysian Government Deplores Air Strikes 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Following initial reports of Israeli air strikes 
against Hamas, the Malaysian government quickly expressed 
concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza and strongly 
condemned Israeli actions.  Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi 
released a press statement on December 28 "deploring the 
disproportionate use of military power by Israel against the 
people of Gaza," urging the immediate restoration of the 
cease-fire by all concerned, and calling on the UN Security 
Council to take "necessary action."  The Foreign Ministry 
issued a separate statement on December 28, which notes that 
"Malaysia considers this act (air strikes by Israel) as a war 
crime and a crime against humanity."  The MFA statement also 
"urges all parties to exercise utmost restraint," and seek a 
negotiated, two-state solution. 
 
Political Parties Criticize U.S. Alongside Israel 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4.  (U) Malaysia's political parties across the spectrum, 
including all three parties in the opposition coalition, 
spoke out to criticize both Israel and the United States. 
The Peoples Justice Party (PKR), led by Anwar Ibrahim, issued 
a December 29 statement referring to "Israel's barbaric air 
raid" and claiming that Israel's "state terrorism" would 
continue as long as its "Western allies" endorsed and 
supported such actions.  Secretary General of the Democratic 
Action Party (DAP) Lim Guan Eng said the U.S. should stop its 
"blind support" for Israeli bombings and urged the Malaysian 
government to lodge an official protest with the Ambassador. 
Criticism of the U.S. was by no means limited to the 
 
KUALA LUMP 00001118  002 OF 002 
 
 
opposition.  Mukhriz Mahathir, son of Malaysia's former Prime 
Minister, and a leading candidate to head the UMNO party's 
Youth wing, issued a statement December 30 calling "upon the 
world's Muslims to be steadfast in rejecting this act of 
terror that has the tacit support of the United States." 
 
Small Protest at Embassy 
------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (U) On December 30, the opposition Islamic Party of 
Malaysia (PAS) led a vocal but orderly demonstration of some 
150 to 250 people in front of the Embassy.  The group, 
reportedly representing a coalition of 45 predominantly 
Muslim NGOs, presented a letter that condemned "yet another 
horrendous crime perpetrated by the Zionist regime of Israel 
on the occupied territory of Palestine."  The letter also 
stated, "We hold the (U.S. government) responsible for the 
death, destructions and sufferings by the wanton acts (sic) 
of Tel Aviv."  The demonstrators' chants in Malay included 
"destroy Israel" and "destroy America."  The demonstrators 
dispersed peacefully after 45 minutes.  The police presence 
was very visible and they provided good support to ensure 
Embassy security during the protest. 
 
Media:  Extensive Coverage of Gaza, Blame on U.S. 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶6.  (U) Malaysia's mainstream media, including television and 
print, has focused extensive coverage on the humanitarian 
situation in Gaza and emotive, critical commentary on 
Israel's actions, as well as criticism of U.S. statements 
blaming Hamas.  Nightly television news shows, Malaysians' 
primary source of news, have given top billing to the air 
strikes on Gaza.  The New Straits Times, which routinely 
represents government views, ran an editorial on December 30, 
entitled, "Stop the Gore in Gaza."  The editorial 
acknowledged that "no country would tolerate daily rocket 
attacks on its towns," but stated "there is no excuse for the 
indiscriminate and disproportionate slaughter (in Gaza)..." 
The editorial argued, "the Israeli assault has certainly 
dashed whatever faint hopes there have been that the 
inauguration of a new American president would provide a 
fresh momentum for the peace process," criticized 
President-elect Obama for his "silence," and urged continued 
vigorous protests. 
 
Malay Press More Strident, Calls for Anti-U.S. Action 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶7.  (U) Malaysia's government-affiliated Malay language press 
has been more strident in its anti-U.S. commentary.  The 
Utusan newspaper, the Malay language daily of the ruling UMNO 
party, used its December 29 editorial to blame the U.S. for 
Israel's actions and for failure to achieve Middle East 
peace.  Utusan's December 30 editorial column "Whispers," 
written on a rotational basis by the paper's editors, went 
further and deemed Israel and the U.S. as the "real axis of 
evil," and called for action not just words to oppose the two 
countries.  The short editorial urged a boycott of U.S. 
products, including films; withdrawal of deposits from U.S. 
banks; and suggested that support for militants' retaliation 
should not be ruled out:  "We could even, if the need arises, 
support retaliatory action by militant Muslim groups after 
this, although it will be interpreted as terrorism.  Who 
cares...."  Berita Harian, another Malay daily associated 
indirectly with UMNO, in its December 29 editorial described 
the Palestinian people as "the victim of U.S. treachery."
