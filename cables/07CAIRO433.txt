SUBJECT: EMBASSY CAIRO'S NOMINATION: THE SECRETARY'S AWARD 
FOR INTERNATIONAL WOMEN OF COURAGE 
 
REF: STATE 12871 
 
¶1. (U)  Per reftel, Embassy Cairo nominates Ambassador 
Moushira Khattab, President of the National Council for 
Motherhood and Childhood (NCCM), for the Secretary's Award 
for International Women of Courage.  Ambassador Khattab is 
one of Egypt's most outspoken and inspirational leaders 
lobbying for the rights of women and children.  As the head 
of the NCCM, she not only has considerable influence with 
policy makers, but also commands admiration and respect from 
grassroots women activists for her leadership, commitment, 
vision, and courage. 
 
¶2. (U)  Since the beginning of her tenure as 
Secretary-General of the NCCM in 1999, Ambassador Khattab set 
 
SIPDIS 
an agenda of progressive reform in Egyptian family law. 
Combating the widespread practice of female genital 
mutilation (FGM) both at the grassroots level and with policy 
makers is one of her top priorities.  NCCM also focuses on 
greater access to education for girls.  Ambassador Khattab is 
the primary author of a national plan of action on girls' 
education, and NCCM works closely with NGO's to ensure that 
future generations of Egyptian women receive the skill sets 
they need to succeed.   Finally, she is leading a fight 
against child labor and protecting the rights of often 
neglected street children. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Ambassador Khattab's work is remarkable and 
courageous because she tackles sensitive and often taboo 
subjects.   As a close associate of First Lady Suzanne 
Mubarak, she is able to effectively influence policy making, 
while clearly maintaining the trust and confidence of 
grassroots organizations.  She not only leads the fight for 
positive reform of Egyptian society, but does so in such a 
unique and far reaching way that she is worthy of receiving 
the Secretary's Award for International Women of Courage.
