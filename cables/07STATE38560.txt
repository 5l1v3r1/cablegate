SUBJECT: GUIDANCE: UNIIIC MANDATE EXTENSION RESOLUTION 
 
¶1. (U) USUN is authorized to join consensus on the 
resolution, in para 2 below, authorizing an extension of 
UNIIIC's mandate until June 15, 2008. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin text. 
 
The Security Council, 
 
Recalling all its previous relevant resolutions, in 
particular resolutions 1595 (2005), 1636 (2005), 1644 
(2005), 1664 (2006), 1686 (2006), 1373 (2001) and 1566 
(2004), 
 
Reaffirming its strongest condemnation of the 14 February 
2005 terrorist bombing, as well as of all other attacks in 
Lebanon since October 2004, and reaffirming also that 
those involved in these attacks must be held accountable 
for their crimes, 
 
Having examined the report of the International 
Independent Investigation Commission (Sec/2007/150) ("The 
Commission"), submitted pursuant to resolutions 1595 
(2005), 1636 (2005), 1644 (2005), and 1686 (2006), 
 
Commending the Commission for the outstanding professional 
work it continues to accomplish under difficult 
circumstances in assisting the Lebanese authorities in 
their investigation into all aspects of this terrorist 
act, 
 
Taking note of the letter of the Prime Minister of Lebanon 
of 21 February 2007 to the Secretary-General 
Sec/2007/159, Enclosure requesting that the mandate of 
the Commission be extended for a further period of up to 
one year from 15 June 2007 in order to ensure stability 
and continuity in the investigative process, and noting 
the concurrent recommendation of the Secretary-General in 
this regard, 
 
Noting the Commission's conclusion that, in light of its 
current and planned investigative activities and while 
significant progress has been made, it is unlikely that 
the Commission will complete its work before its current 
mandate expires and that the Commission therefore welcomes 
the Lebanese request for an extension of its mandate 
beyond this date, 
 
Willing to continue to assist Lebanon in the search for 
the truth and in holding all those involved in this 
terrorist attack accountable, 
 
¶1. Welcomes the report of the Commission; 
 
¶2. Decides to extend the mandate of the Commission until 
15 June 2008 and declares its readiness to terminate the 
mandate earlier if the Commission reports that it has 
completed the implementation of its mandate; 
 
¶3. Requests the Commission to continue to report to the 
Council on the progress of the investigation every four 
months, or at any other time as it deems appropriate; 
 
¶4. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
