Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered ref A demarche to Political 
Counsellor Tenxin Rondel Wangchuk on September 2, urging the 
Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) to consider sponsoring a 
candidate for a seat on the 2010 UN Human Rights Council 
(HRC).   During a September 4 meeting, Wangchuk informed 
PolOff that the RGoB appreciated the invitation of the United 
States to run for a seat on the HRC, but due to a prior 
commitment next year as host of the 16th South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit, they 
will not be able to sponsor a candidate at this time. 
Wangchuk left open the possibility for future collaboration 
within the HRC.
