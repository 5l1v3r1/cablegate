REF: KABUL 878 
 
¶1. (SBU) The opposition United Front political bloc's April 8 
conference on insurgent reconciliation provoked considerable 
internal debate.  Party chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani reaffirmed his 
willingness to negotiate with the Taliban (reftel).  Identifying 
reconciliation as a national priority, he urged insurgent leaders to 
abandon violence and enter into talks with either the government or 
United Front. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In contrast, Abdul Hamid Mubariz, a United Front supporter 
and head of the Journalists Union, described efforts to reconcile 
the Taliban as futile so long as they remain militarily strong and 
have recourse to Pakistani safe havens and support.  Reconciliation 
now, he implied, would require capitulation to the Taliban. 
Political Analyst Ahmad Saidi agreed, criticizing Karzai and ISAF 
for not taking the war to Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan.  Two 
female United Front activists, Shukria Haidary and National Assembly 
MP Qadria Yazdan Parast, vehemently argued that the Taliban are 
beyond redemption because of the crimes they committed against women 
while in power. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rabbani likely adopted his recent high profile on 
reconciliation hoping it would advance his undeclared 2009 
presidential race ambitions.  His overture to the Taliban might 
attract a trickle of Pashtun support.  It does usefully serve to 
remind Afghans of Karzai's failure to reconcile any insurgent of 
note.  Ironically, Rabbani's ploy has also provoked fundamental 
division among his disparate supporters and highlighted the 
fragility of his own political bloc.
