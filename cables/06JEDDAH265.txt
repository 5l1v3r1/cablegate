SUBJECT: CONVERSATION WITH FINNISH AMBASSADOR TO SAUDI 
ARABIA 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General Tatiana Gfoeller, for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) On March 29,  CG received a courtesy visit from 
Finnish Ambassador Martti Isoaro.  Also present was Jeddah 
Pol/Econ Chief.  The Ambassador expressed the hope that the 
U.S. and Finnish missions could cooperate in the Western 
Province and described the two major objectives of his 
embassy in Saudi Arabia, promotion of trade and protection of 
Finish citizens, including a small contingent of Muslims who 
traveled on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.  The Ambassador also 
spoke about a meeting with the Secretary General of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference who expressed interest 
in increasing that organization's engagement in international 
affairs on behalf of the Islamic community of nations. 
 
THE FINNISH MISSION TO SAUDI ARABIA 
 
¶2.  (C) On March 29, Finnish Ambassador Martti Isoaro 
discussed the objectives of his mission in Saudi Arabia with 
the Consul General and Pol/Econ Chief.  Ambassador Isoaro has 
been in Saudi Arabia for approximately nine months.  The 
Finnish Embassy is of very modest size, numbering only five 
officers, including the Ambassador.  Finland does not 
maintain a consulate in Jeddah; however, efforts to promote 
trade dictate that the Ambassador or his staff travel to 
Jeddah frequently. 
 
OIC SEEKING LARGER ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 
 
¶3.  (C) During the meeting, Ambassador Isoaro informed CG 
that while in Jeddah, he had meet with the Secretary General 
of the OIC.  He stated that Secretary General Ihsanoglu had 
expressed a desire to increase the organization's role in 
international affairs, as a representative of the Islamic 
community.  CG replied that the OIC, under Ihsanoglu, was 
striving to take a larger role, but that the organization 
appeared to still lack decisive influence with the Islamic 
populace. 
 
FINLAND LOOKS TO REGENERATE TRADE RELATIONSHIP 
 
¶4.  (C) A major objective of the Finnish Embassy is to revive 
Finnish trade in Saudi Arabia to take advantage of the 
rapidly growing economy and the structural changes brought 
about by Saudi Arabia's entry into the WTO.  The Ambassador 
related that during the boom years before the turn of the 
century, as many as 2,000 Finns had lived in Saudi Arabia. 
As major development projects ended the number diminished and 
dropped drastically in the wake of the terrorist attacks in 
the last few years.  At the present time there are only about 
100 Finns in the Kingdom. 
 
¶5.  (C) The Ambassador is now working to reverse this 
decline.  He hopes to build on the reputation of leading 
Finnish companies, particularly in the areas of construction 
and industrial products.  An important image-maker for 
Finnish industry is Nokia which has a dominant portion of the 
market for mobile phones.  He also has great hopes for a 
Finnish elevator manufacturer that had once been active in 
the Kingdom.  Pol/Econ Chief offered a short briefing on the 
economy in Jeddah and advised him of potential resources, 
such as the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI). 
 
FINNISH HAJJIS 
 
¶6.  (C) Isoaro also revealed that Finland sends approximately 
200 pilgrims to the Kingdom on hajj each year.  The Finnish 
Muslim community is very small, consisting primarily of 
"long-established Tartars" and recent Somali 
"refugees--whether economic or political, it is hard to say." 
 The first group was expelled from their homeland in western 
Asia by the Soviet Government during the mass population 
removals in the 1930's and '40's.  The Somalis were accepted 
by the Finnish Government as refugees from their country's 
civil war in the 1990's.
