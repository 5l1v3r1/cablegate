CONVENTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 109135 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  We delivered reftel demarche on October 16 to 
Basat Ozturk, DDG for Civil Aviation and Maritime Affairs at 
MFA.  Ozturk said the GOT strongly supports the ratification 
of the Montreal Convention and pressed earlier this year to 
make it a legislative priority.  The ratification legislation 
was adopted  by the two relevant parliamentary committees in 
the last parliamentary session, but the General Assembly did 
not vote on it before the session ended.  While unpassed 
legislation normally has to start the process in committee 
again in the new parliamentary session, Ozturk was hopeful 
they can find a procedure to have the ratifcation legislaton 
brought directly to a  general assembly vote, given that both 
committees previously approved it..
