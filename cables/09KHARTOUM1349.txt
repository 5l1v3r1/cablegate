¶1.  (SBU) On November 25, EmbOff discussed Sudan's policy on the 
Arab League Boycott (ALB) of Israel with Abdel Aziz M. Ahmed, head 
of the Multilateral Trading Department of the Government of Sudan 
(GOS) Ministry of Foreign Trade.  Ahmed stated that there has been 
no change in Sudan's policy or practice since last year.  The Israel 
Boycott Act of 1958 exists, but it is ineffective.  Ahmed said that 
the boycott is a political issue more than an economic issue, and he 
believes that during the coming few years Sudan may abolish this 
Boycott Act, especially after accession to the WTO.  The Ministry of 
Foreign Trade of Sudan is in charge of ALB enforcement.  It has 
contacts with the Arab League Boycott office in Damascus, which 
updates information of ALB.  However, Sudan does not send 
representatives to meetings of the Central Boycott office in 
Damascus, but Sudan's Ambassador at Syria can attend. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sudanese authorities require a certificate of origin for 
the importation of all goods and services, and most goods are 
imported to Sudan through its Red Sea port of Port Sudan.  Most 
non-perishable goods are imported directly from Jeddah, Saudi 
Arabia.  No boycott compliance questionnaires or furnished 
boycott-clearance certificates are needed.  Sudan does not request 
any firms to comply with ALB requirements or provide information 
regarding such compliance.  Sudan has no formal or informal boycott 
practices that have an identifiable impact on U.S. businesses. 
Suppliers, vendors and service suppliers are governed by Sudan's 
trade regulations, which do not require compliance with ALB or other 
international boycotts.
