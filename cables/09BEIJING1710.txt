SUBJECT: JUNE 23 MFA PRESS BREIFING: DPRK VESSEL, H1N1, IRAN 
 
¶1. Key points at the June 23 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Qin Gang stated that 
China was aware of relevant reports of a DPRK vessel transporting 
munitions but emphasized that any related inspections must abide by 
the provisions of UNSC 1874. 
 
-- Qin asserted that China's H1N1 quarantine measures were 
consistent with WHO standards and Chinese law, and assist global 
prevention efforts. 
 
-- China had "taken note" of developments in Iran, "respected the 
choice of the Iranian people" and hoped for the preservation of 
Iranian "solidarity and stability." 
 
-- Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva will visit China from June 
24 to 27. 
 
DPRK Vessel 
----------- 
 
¶2.  Asked about reports that a DPRK ship carrying munitions was 
being "trailed by the U.S.," China had "read the relevant reports," 
but could provide no further information, said Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Qin Gang at the June 23 regularly scheduled press 
briefing.  China maintained that any inspection of the vessel and 
restriction of its cargo should abide by UNSCR 1874.  Qin said China 
would "strictly implement" UNSCR 1874 along with relevant national 
and international laws.  China called upon all parties to refrain 
from acts that might "further escalate" the situation.  Qin noted 
that China would welcome any information the U.S. could provide 
regarding the ship in question. 
 
H1N1 Prevention Measures 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. Asked about China's H1N1 prevention strategy, Qin said that, 
having experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak, China approached swine 
flu prevention measures "seriously, prudently, and extremely 
responsibly."  Qin asserted that foreigners "confirmed to be 
infected" were placed into medical observation and quarantine to 
"protect their own health and safety and that those around them" and 
in order to assist global prevention efforts.  Qin claimed that 
China's quarantine procedures were consistent with WHO standards and 
Chinese law on epidemic prevention. 
 
Five-Party Proposal 
------------------- 
 
¶4. In response to a question on proposals for the creation of a 
five-party talk mechanism, Qin said that "dialogue and 
consultation," as well as the Six-Party Talks were the best way to 
achieve denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.   China was 
willing to "stay in close contact and communication" with other 
parties, Qin said. 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶5.  China had "taken note" of the domestic situation in Iran and 
"respected the choice of the Iranian people."  Qin said China 
believed the election issue should be "decided by Iran" and hoped 
for the preservation of Iranian "solidarity and stability." 
 
U.S.-China Defense Consultative Talks 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Qin said that during the tenth session of bilateral U.S.-China 
Defense Consultative Talks in Beijing June 23-24, the U.S. and China 
would exchange views on military relations, Taiwan, international 
and regional security issues, and other issues of common interest. 
Qin said it was "natural" for the U.S. and China to discuss their 
"common interest" in North Korean denuclearization and the situation 
on the Korean Peninsula.  China took this consultation "very 
seriously" and hoped to get "positive results." 
 
Ma Ying-jeou Hawaii Visit 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7.  In response to reports that President Ma Ying-jeou will meet 
with the Governor of Hawaii during a transit stop en route to South 
America, Qin said that China consistently opposed any form of 
"official exchanges" with Taiwan authorities by any country.

Premier Wen Jiabao, and NPC Chairman Wu Bangguo to exchange views on 
enhancing mutual trust, deepening pragmatic cooperation and 
strengthening "coordination, communication and cooperation" in 
international and regional affairs.  Qin noted China and Thailand 
enjoyed "friendly and good neighborly relations." 
 
¶9.  Qin announced that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Song Tao will 
visit Italy from June 26 to 27 to attend the G8 ministerial meeting 
to discuss "Afghanistan and regional crises."
