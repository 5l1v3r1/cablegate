"Panama would be open to considering focused measures to 
pressure the Government of Eritrea to cease interfering in 
the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea," Panamanian MFA DG 
for External Affairs Javier Bonagas told POLCOUNS on March 5. 
 Bonagas -- who was very conversant on the situation in 
Eritrea, Ethiopia, and the region -- expressed concern at 
continued "arms trafficking" in both Eritrea and Ethiopia, 
said that this region of Africa could not suffer additional 
instability, and expressed concerns about the regrettable 
human rights situation.  Bonagas said Eritrea could not be 
permitted to continue to "disturb" the situation in the 
region.  Bonagas said that Panama would support focused 
sanctions against Eritrean officials (e.g., travel ban, asset 
freeze) and an arms embargo to attempt to pressure Eritrea to 
stop interfering with UN operations.  Comment:  Panama 
generally does not like to resort to sanctions and rarely 
ever suggests using "pressure" against other countries. 
Bonagas' openness to sanctions and pressure with respect 
Eritrea highlights Panama's belief that Eritrea is indeed in 
the wrong, Eritrea's behavior is unacceptable, and the UNSC 
should act to bolster UNMEE.
