Â¶1.  (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche on October 26 to 
MFA desk officers for Burma, Jeremie Petit and Marie-Pierre 
Giron.  This demarche was timely as Petit was preparing 
Foreign Minister Kouchner's visit to Thailand, Singapore and 
China on October 28.  Marie-Pierre Giron responded that the 
French agreed with our points -- ones that tracked with the 
reasons for FM Kouchner's trip to Asia.  On the issue of 
pressuring ASEAN to disinvite Burma to the EU-ASEAN meeting, 
she noted this was an EU level decision, and did not know 
what position the French would take.
