"Brics" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (6-18) by Kenneth Maxwell states: 
"....Brics' power is for now more rhetorical than real. Brazil's 
economy, even being the 10th largest in the world, reaches only half 
of the French economy dimension.....Brics are looking for, above 
all, a louder voice in international business. The meeting held in 
Russia this week was an important first step to hit this aim." 
 
"The first meeting of the Bric" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (6-18) notes: "It 
lacked issues to give substance to the first Bric summit, for now 
only am abbreviation, not a group an even less a bloc....The flags 
raised at the meeting were also raised at the last G20 
meeting.....[and] are not enough to differentiate Bric countries and 
give them an collective identity." 
 
"Limited room for a deal at the Brics meeting" 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (6-18) says: "The 
rapprochement between Brazil, Russia, China and India has few 
chances of going beyond preliminaries, as shown by the meeting held 
in Yekaterinburg ....In addition to restrict agreements , there is 
nothing much these countries, which are more rivals than allies, may 
agree on and take [joint] actions."
