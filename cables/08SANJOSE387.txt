SUBJECT: COSTA RICA SUPPORTS UNSC ACTION ON BURMA BUT WARY 
OF FRENCH MEDIA RHETORIC 
 
REF: SECSTATE 49813 
 
Classified By: David E. Henifin, Acting DCM, Reason 1.4 (d). 
 
¶1. (U) We delivered reftel demarche on May 12 to Adriana 
Murillo, Juan Salas and Deyanira Ramirez of the MFA's UN 
Security Council Team. The team was very happy to receive the 
text of the French resolution; they stated that Costa Rica 
had been asked to support it in New York but had not seen the 
draft text. 
 
¶2. (C) Murillo stated that as a human rights matter, raising 
the issue of humanitarian aid for Myanmar is definitely 
within the scope of the Security Council, even though some 
UNSC members claim it is not. The GOCR feels that protection 
of Burmese citizens is a priority and does not want to see 
them left defenseless. The GOCR would be supportive of UNSC 
action, but added the caveat that the French have been using 
stronger language in the media than contained in the 
resolution (they did not cite a media source). Therefore, the 
MFA officials asked how far the U.S. and France are planning 
to go to resolve the situation. The team agreed that the 
optimal solution would be that the regime allows in aid 
workers and supplies. 
 
¶3. (C) Ramirez added that the resolution might have more legs 
in the UNSC if it were framed around the possibility that the 
situation on the ground (with thousands of people suffering 
and lacking basic needs) could destabilize the regime and the 
region. 
 
¶4. (C) COMMENT: For the second time when receiving a 
Burma-related demarche, Costa Rica asked about China,s 
position on the matter. This seems to reflect new Costa Rican 
sensitivity to China since establishing relations last year. 
Chinese Vice Premier Hui Liangyu visited here last week and 
signed a $50 million package of donations to Costa Rica. We 
will report separately on that.
