SUBJECT: NON-PAPERS DELIVERED REGARDING UNSCR 1803 AND 
FUTURE BANK 
 
REF: A. A) SECSTATE 29096 
 
     ¶B. B) SECSTATE 27642 
 
Classified By: ADCM Margaret McKean for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶1. (C) Per  Ref A, Non-Paper regarding Iranian Banks' 
deceptive financial practices was delivered by Econoff to New 
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFAT) Middle East 
Division with responsibility for sanctions issues regarding 
Iran and to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the New 
Zealand Police responsible for monitoring suspicious 
financial transactions.  MFAT Iran desk officer James Munro 
indicated he would disseminate information contained in Ref A 
to both relevant government agencies and financial 
institutions.  He indicated that many of the major banks in 
New Zealand have already begun to search financial 
transactions in order meet compliance with the UNSCR 
sanctions.  He went on to indicate that the Iranian Embassy 
had complained to MFAT that ANZ Bank, which handles the 
Embassy local accounts, wanted to drop them as a customer. 
In researching trade and financial flows, bilateral trade 
between New Zealand and Iran amounts to only 0.4 percent of 
all exports amounting to NZ$112 million. Exports are 
primarily agriculture and meat products.  As far as 
technology transfer, New Zealand exports some seismic 
equipment to monitor earth quakes but little other technology 
and certainly no technology related to nuclear power. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ref B Non-Paper regarding the designation of Future 
Bank under E.O. 13382 was also delivered to MFAT and FIU 
officials.  While there was no immediate reaction, Post was 
informed that GNZ authorities would disseminate the 
information and search financial transactions to ascertain 
any suspicious activity.  Post will follow-up with any 
information provided by GNZ resulting from provided 
information.
