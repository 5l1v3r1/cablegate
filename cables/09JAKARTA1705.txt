Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  The September 30 earthquake damaged or destroyed approximately 
210,000 houses and affected at least 1.2 million people.  Field 
assessments conducted by the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team 
(USAID/DART) indicate needs for food, safe drinking water, and 
shelter interventions.  The U.N. Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has issued preliminary findings of the 
October 1 to 5 joint humanitarian needs assessment.  USAID's Office 
of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) has received 
proposals and anticipates receiving additional proposals.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Number of People Affected 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the 
earthquake affected 1.2 million people in Padang District, according 
to U.S. Embassy staff in Padang. 
 
---------------------------- 
USAID/DART Field Assessments 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The USAID/DART continues to conduct field assessments.  On 
October 8, the USAID/DART program officer and field officer are in 
Padang Pariaman and Adam districts, assessing humanitarian access, 
determining priority needs of earthquake-affected families, and 
examining potential geographic gaps in the humanitarian response to 
date. 
 
-- Food and Nutrition -- 
 
¶4.  The USAID/DART has investigated rumors of shortages of food and 
medicine in one subdistrict and noted that supplies of medicine are 
sufficient.  According to the USAID/DART, food is one of the 
priority needs of individuals in earthquake-affected areas.  The 
U.N. World Food Program (WFP) has redirected $3 million in food 
assistance from Aceh to Padang. 
 
¶5.  Preliminary assessments conducted by the USAID/DART indicate 
that the price of noodles, one of the staple foods, and the price of 
water sold from water vendors are increasing, with the price of 
noodles increasing more than 60 percent since the earthquake.  The 
increase in the cost of food and water raises concerns about 
potential food insecurity due to lack of access.  Populations in 
affected areas were able to plant the recent rice crop, however, and 
the agricultural season is still on track, without any significant 
interruption. 
 
-- Health -- 
 
¶6.  Preliminary assessments by the USAID/DART indicate that the 
price of cooking fuel has not increased since the earthquake.  This 
trend is significant, given the longstanding tradition in West 
Sumatra of boiling piped water -- which comes from shallow aquifers, 
susceptible to contamination -- to make contaminated water safe for 
drinking.  Families that lack money to purchase fuel are instead 
burning wood and are thus able to maintain this habit, which 
protects individuals from water-borne disease. 
 
-- Water and Sanitation -- 
 
¶7.  The USAID/DART is investigating rumors of water shortages at 
hospitals in and around Padang.  The USAID/DART is working to 
ascertain whether area hospitals are facing water shortages and, if 
so, whether shortages were a result of the earthquake or existed 
prior to September 30. 
 
-- Shelter and Settlements -- 
 
JAKARTA 00001705  002 OF 003 
 
 
 
¶8.  The USAID/DART is investigating a report from the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) of an informal settlement of 
approximately 2,000 people in Padang District.  The USAID/DART will 
ascertain why individuals in this settlement were unable to return 
to points of origin.  The vast majority of earthquake-affected 
populations have remained at points of origin and have not been 
displaced to informal settlements.  The trend to stay in areas of 
origin -- even if houses are damaged or uninhabitable -- reduces 
humanitarian needs and facilitates the humanitarian community's 
response to existing needs, as long as the area is accessible via 
ground transport. 
 
¶9.  As reported by OCHA on October 7, the Government of Indonesia 
(GoI) confirmed that the quake severely damaged 102,046 houses, 
inflicted moderate damage on 49,864 houses, and slightly damaged 
54,606 houses.  In addition, staff from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta 
reported that the earthquake damaged or destroyed at least 2,580 
religious venues in West Sumatra. 
 
¶10.  The USAID/DART has noted that as of October 6, humanitarian 
agencies working to respond to the earthquake had distributed a 
total of 10,500 tarpaulins, 2,250 tents, and 47 shelter-in-a-box 
sets, out of a total 57,600 tarpaulins, 30,000 shelter kits, 774 
shelter-in-a-box sets, 13,900 tents, and 13,020 emergency shelters 
planned for distribution. 
 
¶11.  The USAID/DART has received reports that the GoI plans to 
provide cash assistance to families whose houses were damaged or 
destroyed by the earthquake.  The GoI plans to provide IDR 5 million 
($530) to families whose houses were slightly damaged, IDR 10 
million ($1,060) to families with moderately damaged houses, and IDR 
15 million ($1,590) to families whose houses were severely damaged. 
These funds are designed to supplement families' available resources 
to repair or rebuild.  A USAID/OFDA shelter and settlements 
specialist, who is tentatively planning to deploy to Indonesia to 
join the USAID/DART, will examine options for temporary and 
transitional shelter, in conjunction with shelter cluster partners, 
including the GoI.

Joint Humanitarian Needs Assessment 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  From October 1 to 5, U.N. agencies and NGOs conducted a rapid 
joint needs assessment.  On October 7, OCHA summarized the results 
of the assessment. 
 
-- Livelihoods and Agriculture:  The quake damaged some fish landing 
centers, auction halls, and irrigation canals. 
 
-- Food Security and Nutrition:  The humanitarian community expects 
the need for rice stocks to increase and is prioritizing procuring 
rice and obtaining funding to support complementary food supplies. 
 
-- Health:  Mobile clinics are needed to treat injured persons, 
particularly in rural areas.  The humanitarian community is 
concerned about the health status of the affected population due to 
high rates of respiratory infections and diarrhea and high levels of 
stress. 
 
-- Shelter and Non-Food Items:  The majority of affected populations 
are living in close proximity to damaged houses and urgently require 
emergency shelter and relief items. 
 
-- Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH):  Affected populations 
require safe drinking water transported by bowsers.  Additional 
bowers and storage capacity are needed to meet SPHERE standards for 
drinking, cooking, and basic hygiene.  An estimated 200,000 people 
require access to basic water supplies and sanitation and hygiene 
services, according to participants in the joint humanitarian 
assessment.

Humanitarian Response Plan 
-------------------------- 
 
¶13.  The U.N. is planning to release the Humanitarian Response Plan 
on October 9, and USAID/DART and Mission staff will attend the 
release.  Similar to a U.N. flash appeal, the plan will summarize 
humanitarian needs and request assistance from the international 
community. 
 
---------------------------------- 
USAID/OFDA Humanitarian Assistance 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶14.  The USAID/DART is reviewing proposals and anticipates receiving 
additional proposals from potential partners. 
 
----------------------- 
DoD Earthquake Response 
----------------------- 
 
¶15.  On October 7, during the first day of operation, the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD) Humanitarian Assistance Rapid Response 
Team (HARRT), or mobile medical unit, treated more than 100 patients 
in Padang.  DoD anticipates that the number of patients treated per 
day will increase as word spreads about the medical unit.  Families 
of patients and administrators of a nearby hospital stated that they 
were very pleased with the field hospital, and local media provided 
positive coverage of the field hospital's activities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Transition from Emergency to Reconstruction and Rehabilitation 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶15.  As reported by the U.N., the Humanitarian Response Plan, which 
supports the GoI's humanitarian response efforts, will last for 90 
days.  The GoI has declared that the emergency phase will last for 
one month, followed by the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase 
that is planned to commence on November 1 and last until March 
¶2010.
