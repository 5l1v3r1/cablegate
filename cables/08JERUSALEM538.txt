SUBJECT: PALESTINIAN FRESH PRODUCE TO U.S. 
 
REF: 2007 JERUSALEM 869 
 
¶1. (U) USG assistance facilitated the shipment of a sizable 
quantity of fresh produce from the West Bank to New York via 
Jordan on March 24.  The USD 10,000 shipment of chives and 
tarragon herbs originated from a farm in Tubas, northeast of 
Nablus, that has been the recipient of USAID support through 
the Palestinian Agriculture Partnership Activity (PAPA) 
program since 2006.  According to PAPA contractors, this is 
the first shipment of Palestinian fresh produce to the U.S. 
that any of them can remember. 
 
¶2. (U) According to those involved, the shipment went 
smoothly.  At the Allenby Bridge, Israeli authorities 
permitted back-to-back transfer on the West Bank side of the 
bridge, allowing the shipment to remain chilled throughout. 
The herbs were flown from Amman to New York.  The U.S. buyer 
confirmed the shipment passed USDA and customs inspections on 
March 25.  The shipment's country of origin label reads "West 
Bank via Israel." 
 
¶3. (U) This cable has been cleared by USAID WB/G.
