SUBJECT: TURKEY/NATO: TURKEY REQUESTS SUPPORT ON EXERCISE 
NOBLE ARCHER 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Kim Deblauw for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  In conversations with Ambassador on May 14 
and 15, MFA Undersecretary Apakan requested the U.S. urge 
NATO political and military authorities to maintain NATO 
impartiality in Aegean disputes, stating that conduct of 
Exercise Noble Archer under the current scenario will 
escalate tensions between Greece and Turkey while undermining 
Alliance solidarity and credibility.  MFA Maritime/Aviation 
Deputy Director General Ozturk convoked us May 15 to 
elaborate on the same points, stressing that NATO support to 
the current Noble Archer scenario would violate NATO's 
long-held policy of neutrality and could jeopardize progress 
being made in the bilateral dialogue, including low-key 
exploratory talks, between Turkey and Greece.  Ozturk said 
Turkey would protest vigorously a NATO decision to take part 
in the exercise, suggesting the Turkish military may react 
more strongly.  End Summary 
 
¶2. (C) Apakan told Ambassador May 14 that Turkey believes the 
island of Aghios Efstratios, the focal point of Exercise 
Noble Archer proposed by the Combined Air Operations Center 7 
(CAOC 7) in Larissa, is demilitarized under international 
agreements; any exercise involving that island would violate 
its demilitarized status.  In line with long-established 
policy (the "Luns doctrine"), NATO should not get involved in 
the dispute nor be the venue to discuss and judge 
disagreements among Allies.  Involving the Alliance in such 
bilateral disputes will not be in the interest of NATO and 
Allied countries.  Apakan stated that conduct of the exercise 
under the present scenario (with NATO participation) will 
escalate tensions between two Allies, undermine Alliance 
solidarity, and call into question NATO's impartiality. 
Apakan noted that Greece and Turkey continue to try to solve 
their problems through bilateral dialogue, including via 
low-key exploratory talks. 
 
¶3. (C) Ozturk told us May 15 that the May 8 meeting of Greek 
and Turkish officials in Istanbul, under the 39th round of 
exploratory talks, had gone extremely well with positive 
feelings on both sides.  The GOT is therefore surprised and 
disappointed to hear the NATO Secretary General claim 
bilateral talks are not going well.  Ozturk wondered whether 
the SYG is getting one-sided reporting from the Greek side, 
and is therefore inclined to be sympathetic to the Greek 
request for participation in Noble Archer.  Ozturk also 
stated that Turkish reporting from Brussels indicates the 
U.S. is now leaning more toward the Greek view on Aegean 
exercises.  In any case, Ozturk emphasized, NATO 
participation in Noble Archer would undermine the painstaking 
bilateral talks underway to resolve the entire range of 
complex and interlinked Aegean issues. 
 
¶4. (C) Ozturk said the GOT would protest a NATO decision to 
participate in Noble Archer vigorously and at all levels.  He 
stated he could not predict the Turkish military's reaction, 
but suggested it would be very strong.  At the least, NATO 
participation under the current scenario would jeopardize 
chances for any future NATO exercises in the Aegean.  He 
stated the U.S. has a great responsibility for taking a stand 
in favor of NATO neutrality and that Turkey is hoping for our 
strong support.  We told Ozturk that any Turkish reaction to 
a NATO decision to participate in the exercise should not 
contribute to escalating tensions or creating dangerous 
situations in the Aegean.
