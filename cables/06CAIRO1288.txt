¶1.  (SBU) The GOE's National Telecommunications Regulatory 
Authority (NTRA) on February 19 made available instructions 
for bidders on the proposed third mobile telephone licence 
(reftel).  According to press reports, as of February 27, 17 
companies had purchased the tender document, or the "Network 
Specifications Handbook," at a cost of $25,000 each.  Press 
suggests that among the 17 are the GOE-controlled Telecom 
Egypt (TE), and private Egyptian firms Raya Holdings, 
National Telecommunications Corporation, and Teletech. 
International corporations AFK Sistema (Russia), Etisalat 
(UAE), Mobile Telecommunications Corporation (Kuwait), and 
Mobile Telephone Networks (South Africa) reportedly are also 
among those who paid for the document.  NTRA will sell the 
license by auction, at a starting bid of LE 2.5 billion, or 
approximately $439 million.  (Comment: As per reftel, we 
still lack confirmation of a consortium among TeleTech, 
Sprint, and Nextel, but the expenditure of $25,000 suggests 
TeleTech has obtained a commitment from international 
partners.  However, we expect the auction format to favor 
bidders willing to spend large amounts of capital up front - 
i.e., investors from the oil-rich Arabian Gulf.  End comment.) 
 
¶2.  (U) NTRA offered the tender on a technology neutral basis 
- i.e., either GSM or CDMA technology would be acceptable - 
and required the winner provide 3G-2G service.  Bidders 
reportedly will each put up $4.4 million as a guarantee, 
forfeited to NTRA if they win the contract and then withdraw. 
 NTRA will host a bidders' conference on March 8, the 
deadline for sumbitting proposals is April 17, and NTRA will 
complete evaluation of proposals within the following eight 
weeks.  Preference will be given to consortia including an 
Egyptian partner, and to firms willing to trade a portion of 
shares on the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange after two 
years of operation, according to press. 
 
¶3.  (U) New NTRA Executive President Amr Badawi announced 
that the tender document includes provisions for domestic 
roaming service in uncovered areas, at least initially, via 
the existing infrastructures of current telecommunications 
providers TE, MobiNil, and Vodafone (i.e., TE-owned landline 
infrastructure, and MobiNil- and Vodafone-owned cellular), as 
well as number portability.  However, press also indicates 
that the tender protects existing commitments between NTRA 
and the current mobile providers MobiNil and Vodafone.
