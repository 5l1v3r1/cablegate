SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT:

Mideast

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that contrary to widespread 
expectations, the US-sponsored international meeting scheduled for 
sometime this fall may not be held at the level of heads of 
government, but only for foreign ministers.  The daily quoted Andrey 
Demidov, the No. 2 diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Tel Aviv, as 
saying it was his understanding that the proposed meeting in 
Washington would "be at the level of foreign ministers."  Maariv 
(Ben Caspit) said that if PM Olmert and Strategic Affairs Minister 
Avigdor Lieberman agree on a change in Israel's governmental system, 
Lieberman's party may support the Washington meeting. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that an IDF probe determined on Thursday that the 
three Palestinian children killed in Gaza on Tuesday were only 
playing near rocket launchers targeted by Israeli troops, and were 
not connected with the terrorists. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that senior Russian Embassy official 
Andrey Demidov told the newspaper that an accusation by Amos Gilad, 
the head of the Defense Ministry's Diplomatic-Military Bureau, that 
Russia was partly responsible for recent tensions between Syria and 
Israel could undermine Israeli-Russian relations.  Maariv reported 
that Russian advisers are returning to Syria.  Similarly, The 
Jerusalem Post reported that Russia is developing an advanced naval 
port at Tartus and providing Syria with sophisticated missile 
technology. 
 
Former minister Natan Sharansky was quoted as saying in an interview 
with The Jerusalem Post that he gives President Bush a "C" grade for 
implementing his vision.  Sharansky's book, "The Case for Democracy: 
The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror," had inspired 
the President. 
 
Leading media reported that on Thursday PM Olmert named Dr. Shaul 
Horev as the next managing-director of the Israel Atomic Energy 
Commission (IAEC). The former Israel Navy deputy chief has in the 
past filled-in as temporary chairman of the IAEC and in his latest 
capacity headed a secret agency within the Defense Ministry.  He 
will be replacing Gideon Frank, a senior expert in the field of 
atomic energy who held on to the position for over 15 years and who 
Ha'aretz says is held in high esteem at the International Agency for 
Atomic Energy. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that on Thursday, for the first time since 1994, 
all Palestinian security organizations in the West Bank participated 
in a senior level meeting with their Israeli counterparts.  The 
security coordination meeting took place in the army headquarters in 
Beit El, near Ramallah. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted PA Information Minister Riyad al-Malki as 
saying on Thursday that the PA's decision to close dozens of Islamic 
charities is aimed at preventing Hamas from exploiting these 
institutions for money laundering.  The Jerusalem Post reported that 
PA security officials expressed concern that the decision would 
prompt many of the affected charities to go underground or to move 
their activities to mosques. 
 
Ha'aretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that the Winograd 
Commission has still not decided who is likely to be harmed by its 
conclusions, according to a statement it made to the High Court of 
Justice. 
 
The Jerusalem Post printed an AP wire report that Human Rights Watch 
(HRW) has issued a report accusing Hizbullah of firing rockets at 
civilian areas in Israel during the Second Lebanon War.   HRW was 
quoted as saying it is planning to release a report critical of 
Israel on September 6.  Maariv and other media revealed that a 
failure to encode orders in a drone led to a 1997 ambush by 
Hizbullah that left 12 IDF troops dead during an operation in 
Ansariya, Lebanon. 
 
Maariv reported that Israel is worried by the lack of public 
appearances by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak over the past two 
weeks. 
 
Yediot examined the possibility of a new threat to Israel after a 
pullout of US forces from Iraq. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Jewish American organizations are 
not impressed by Israel's PR campaign on its treatment of Darfur 
refugees. 
 
All media reported that on Thursday Finance Minister Roni Bar-On 
informed the accountant general in his ministry, Yaron Zelekha, that 
his contract would not be extended when it finishes at the end of 
October.  The media reported that critics of the move said that 
Zelekha acted as whistleblower in the affair of the privatization of 
Bank Leumi, Israel's second-largest bank, in which PM Ehud Olmert 
was allegedly involved.  The media reported on moves to prevent 
Zelekha's ouster. 
 
Maariv ran a feature about Congressman Keith Ellison from Minnesota 
(Democrat), who is active on the national level in advocacy for 
Muslims in the US. 
 
Yediot reported that on Thursday the State Department announced that 
150 Israelis won its green card lottery. 
 
The JerusalemQst reported on the journey of "hidden Jews" and 
potential converts to Israel from Hispanic countries for a "personal 
Jewish renaissance." 
 
In an unusual move, Ha'aretz led with a report from Greenland on the 
effect of global warming on the island's icebergs and maritime 
environment.

Summary:

Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn and Washington correspondent 
Shmuel Rosner wrote in the independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: "Let 
me make progress with the Israelis and Palestinians, [Secretary 
Rice] told [President Bush], and I'll bring over the Arab world." 
 
Palestinian affairs correspondent Khaled Abu Toameh wrote in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: "It is highly unlikely 
that the PA Chairman would be able to win the backing of a majority 
of his people for a US-backed deal." 
 
Ha'aretz editorialized: "Israel cannot behave like a terrorist 
organization that targets civilians, even when the shooting comes in 
response to an attack.  After all, this is the main reason why 
Israel is encouraging the boycott of Hamas the world over." 
 
Former IDF chief of staff Moshe Ya'alon wrote in The Jerusalem Post: 
 
"Shorn of ... mistaken assumptions, the picture in the Middle East 
is disturbing indeed.  No wonder emissaries hold on to them." 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one of the 
popular, pluralist Maariv: "Russia's road back to the status of a 
world power is paved with bad intentions.  Vladimir Putin is being 
revealed as the regional pyromaniac." 
 
Military correspondent Yaakov Katz wrote in The Jerusalem Post: 
"Overall, according to senior officers, the IDF has learned its 
lesson [from the Second Lebanon War]." 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
Â¶I.  "Rice's Promises" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn and Washington correspondent 
Shmuel Rosner wrote in the independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz 
(8/31): "The sincerity shown by Abbas and Olmert is one element the 
Americans are relying on, but there is another one above it: Rice's 
promise to Bush.  Let me make progress with the Israelis and 
Palestinians, she told him, and I'll bring over the Arab world. 
Rice apparently truly believes in this, despite expressions of 
skepticism on the part of Israeli officials, who have told her they 
have difficulty finding any evidence of such a process.  Rice 
already has two achievements in the bag: the Arab League delegation 
to Israel and the Saudi announcement of its participation in the 
conference.  Rice has learned the lessons of previous conferences. 
Bill Clinton, she thinks, made a mistake when he got to Camp David 
without first ensuring the Arab world's support of the agreement 
being formulated.  She believes that this time, the window of 
opportunity created with the consolidation of 'moderate' powers in 
the Arab world -- united against the modified axis of evil 
consisting of Iran, Syria, Hizbullah, and Hamas -- can lead to a 
different dynamic." 
 
II.  "Summits Aside" 
 
Palestinian affairs correspondent Khaled Abu Toameh wrote in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (8/31): "Abbas may be 
sincere in his efforts to talk peace with Israel and assert his 
control over the West Bank, but it's hard to imagine that he would 
be able to make crucial decisions on explosive issues concerning 
Jerusalem and the refugees.  It's hard to imagine that he would be 
able to accept anything less than what was offered to Arafat at the 
botched Camp David summit in 2000.  Having lost the Gaza Strip and 
much of his credibility -- not only among his constituents, but also 
among many Arabs and Muslims elsewhere -- it's not even clear if 
Abbas has a mandate to represent the Palestinians at the 
US-sponsored Middle East peace conference due to be held later this 
year.... Given the current divisions among the Palestinians, the 
ongoing Hamas-Fatah power struggle, the growing mistakes of the US 
and Israel in the Arab world, and Abbas's shaky status, it is highly 
unlikely that the PA Chairman would be able to win the backing of a 
majority of his people for a US-backed deal." 
 
III.  "Five Children in One Week" 
 
Ha'aretz editorialized (8/31): "Three Palestinian children were 
killed by Israeli fire in the northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday.... 
The Israeli public reacted to these killings, just like it did to 
the killing of two other children several days earlier, with near 
complete apathy. It might as well be an act of god, or an acceptable 
price that balances out the frustration at the continued Qassam 
rocket attacks.  This indifference is dangerous because it does not 
encourage greater care in identifying targets.  The automatic 
expressions of sorrow by government officials, and the argument that 
the 'terrorists organizations send children deliberately to places 
where they become targets,' does not suggest that anyone is 
attempting to learn the necessary lessons from the mistakes.  This 
is all the more true when the targets are in areas housing 
civilians, and the risk is known in advance. Israel cannot behave 
like a terrorist organization that targets civilians, even when the 
shooting comes in response to an attack.  After all, this is the 
main reason why Israel is encouraging the boycott of Hamas the world 
over." 
 
IV.  "Misinterpreting the Mideast" 
 
Former IDF chief of staff Moshe Ya'alon wrote in The Jerusalem Post 
(8/31): "After a few years of benign neglect, Israel is back on the 
itineraries of well-meaning foreign emissaries.... There are four 
misconceptions thatQiplomats bring with them to Israel.  Primary 
among them is the idea that solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
is a prerequisite for stability in the Middle East.... The second 
misconception is that Israeli territorial concessions are the key to 
progress.... Emissaries also still believe that the 'occupation' 
blocks agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.... Finally, the 
well-intentioned visiting diplomats believe that the Palestinians 
want -- and have the ability -- to establish a state that will live 
in peace alongside Israel.... Shorn of these mistaken assumptions, 
the picture in the Middle East is disturbing indeed.  No wonder 
emissaries hold on to them.  So what should be done?.... Rice, 
Blair, and the other emissaries must be the countervailing voices, 
offering vision, clarity, and leadership.  They must draw on their 
rich diplomatic experience, free themselves from misconceptions 
about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the petty politics that 
flow from them -- especially the binds of political correctness -- 
to lead us all toward freedom, security, and peace.  Anything else 
is mere meddling." 
 
Â¶V.  "The Regional Pyromaniac" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one of the 
popular, pluralist Maariv (8/31): "Russia's road back to the status 
of a world power is paved with bad intentions.  Vladimir Putin is 
being revealed as the regional pyromaniac, who does as he pleases 
and pays no mind to anyone.  As far as he is concerned, the Middle 
East can go up in flames with all its inhabitants -- as long as the 
payments arrive on time.  At the beginning of the year, the Russians 
gave Iran information that the US was planning to attack in April. 
March came, April came, but the Americans did not attack. 
Afterwards they moved on to Damascus.  The Israelis, so the Russians 
informed the Syrians, will attack in the summer.  The summer has 
passed, and no attack is to be seen.  What do the Russians get out 
of all this?  Quite a bit.  Reports have now spread in the West 
saying that Russia recently signed a new contract for supplying 
long-range rockets to Syria.  The value of the deal is estimated at 
about USD 1.4 billion.  The financier: Iran.  Putin laughs all the 
way to the bank, while in Israel and Syria everyone heads for the 
bunkers.  It would be distorted to pin all the regional escalation 
on Russian instigation.  Moscow's behavior provides a tailwind and 
fuels the fire.  It is not the one that started it.  Bashar Assad 
closely examined the outcome of the Second Lebanon War.... The 
latest reassuring statements made in Jerusalem, by Ehud Barak and 
others, are intended to be self-fulfilling.  They are not based on 
true calm, for the time being.  Tension continues to be high.  The 
Syrians are preparing for war -- that is clear." 
 
VI.  "Lying in Wait" 
 
Military correspondent Yaakov Katz wrote in The Jerusalem Post 
(8/31): "In Gaza, Hamas is building up an army and continues to 
smuggle unprecedented amounts of weapons and explosives in from the 
Sinai.  In the North, Hizbullah has basically rebuilt itself and is 
continuing to receive large amounts of weapons, including advanced 
anti-tank missiles and rockets, from Syria.  At the moment, Israel's 
policy regarding both is 'watch and wait'.... Upon taking his post 
in February, Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi set the 
summer as the deadline for getting the IDF ready for war with 
Hizbullah and Syria.... Overall, according to senior officers, the 
IDF has learned its lesson, and will utilize its advantage in 
massive fire-power and large numbers of tanks and infantry units in 
any future battle against Hizbullah."
