REF: SECSTATE 01351 
 
¶1. (SBU) On January 5, PolOff met with Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Director of African Union Affairs Kwabena Baah-Doudu 
to urge the Government of Ghana to press the AU to request 
that the UN begin planning to re-hat the African Union 
Mission in Sudan (AMIS) in 2006, per reftel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Baah-Doudu inquired why the U.S. sought to remove 
the mission from the AU. Per reftel, PolOff assured him that 
the U.S. appreciated Ghana's contribution to AMIS and the 
results the Mission had achieved. PolOff emphasized that 
re-hatting the mission to a UN peacekeeping operation was 
congruent with the AU's plans for AMIS and that the USG 
believes the UN must begin planning now for the future. 
PolOff added that the USG hoped to introduce a resolution 
authorizing the planning for a re-hat during its presidency 
of the Security Council in February. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Unprompted, Baah-Doudu then raised the AU's 
financial and logistical difficulties identified in the 
recent assessment mission report as if to suggest that these 
issues prompted the USG to seek a re-hat. (Note: Baah-Doudu 
said the GOG had not seen the report's recommendations yet, 
but he clearly seemed briefed on its contents. End note.) 
PolOff responded by asking if Baah-Doudu expected the report 
to contain any recommendations relevant to the GOG's 
position. Baah-Doudu acknowledged AMIS' difficulties and said 
the GOG was concerned about them. He said the GOG would have 
to review the report's recommendations at Addis Ababa on 
January 11 and consider the USG's offer of assistance before 
recommending any course of action to the AU.  Commenting on 
the USG position, he said, "This is important. We will give 
this all the due weight it deserves." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Baah-Doudu seemed concerned that the USG 
may regard AMIS as a failure and be seeking a re-hat to place 
responsibilities in more capable hands. It is unclear how 
this sensitivity may influence the GOG's decisions on this 
issue.
