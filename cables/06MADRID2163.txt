SUBJECT: STAFFDEL BRENNAN SEEKS SPANISH COOPERATION IN 
STEMMING FLOW OF COLOMBIAN COCAINE 
 
 
 ¶1. (U) A staff delegation from the House International 
Relations Committee and the House Judiciary Committee visited 
Madrid August 28-30, to discuss narcotics trafficking between 
Europe and Colombia and other Andean nations. Poloff and DEA 
attach attended all meetings with Spanish and Colombian 
officials. During their meetings, the delegation delivered 
the message that narcotics trafficking -- specifically 
Colombian cocaine -- is no longer just a U.S. problem and 
Spain and the rest of Europe must take an increased role in 
dealing with the issue.  The StaffDel met with the Action 
Committee on Drug Trafficking of Spain's Interior Ministry, 
and representatives from the Spanish National Police, Civil 
Guard and Customs. In addition, the StaffDel met with the 
Colombian Ambassador to Spain Martha Noemi Sanin and 
Colombian Ambassador to the United Nations Jose Serrano 
Cadena. 
 
¶2. (U) In preparation for a September 21 joint hearing on the 
European role in stopping the flow of narcotics, the StaffDel 
will make the following observations and recommendations to 
the HIRC: 
 
//OBSERVATIONS// 
 
-- (U) Spain does not dispute that cocaine trafficking is a 
major problem for Spain and Europe. They agree with the 
consensus among U.S. and Colombian officials that 40 to 50 
percent of all Andean cocaine now goes to Europe. 
 
-- (U) While Spain is clearly working to coordinate efforts 
between the Spanish National Police, the Civil Guard and 
Spanish Customs, interagency turf battles seem to be 
hindering the cooperation efforts. 
 
-- (U) It is evident that Venezuela is the primary 
stepping-off point for Colombian cocaine en route to Europe. 
 
//RECOMMENDATIONS// 
 
-- (U) Encourage Spain to support Colombia in the war against 
narco-trafficking. 
 
-- (U) Encourage Spain to take the lead in the European Union 
in the drug war. 
 
-- (U) Encourage Colombia to seek EU assistance similiar to 
USG assistance provided through "Plan Colombia." 
 
-- (U) Encourage Spain to be the European leader in soft-side 
support to Colombia such as assisting demobilized members of 
the FARC, planting alternative crops or in projects such as 
the construction of schools and hospitals. 
 
-- (U) Praise Spain for its work in helping initiate a 
European/Andean law enforcement liaison office in Lisbon, 
Portugal, based on the JIATF-S concept. 
 
-- (U) Encourage greater information sharing between 
Colombian and U.S. agencies. 
 
-- (U) Encourage a much increased Spanish liaison presence in 
Bogota to improve cooperation with Colombian law enforcement 
agencies in the fight against drugs, particularly in 
information sharing. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
¶3. (SBU). Spain is clearly engaged in the battle to stem the 
flow of Colombian cocaine and Colombian Ambassador Sanin was 
quick to express appreciation for Spain's good cooperation 
with Colombia on this issue.  However, resource issues are 
clearly a problem for Spain's security services; at several 
points, Spanish interlocutors said that the recent spike in 
illegal immigration from sub-Saharan Africa is straining 
their interdiction capabilities.  We expect that Spain will 
maintain a good level of cooperation with Andean countries 
despite the current resource pressures.
