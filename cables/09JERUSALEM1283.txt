SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (07/28): Palestinians looking for 
action after US official visits 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Local media run prominent coverage on US diplomatic efforts in the 
region. Al-Quds's lead headline reads "Mitchell, Gates and Jones in 
the region, Amr Moussa reiterates Arab States' refusal to take any 
steps towards normalizing relations with Israel prior to cessation 
of settlements, Intensive US efforts to push the peace process 
forward." Al-Quds reports on Special Envoy George Mitchell's talks 
in Cairo on July 27 with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Mitchell 
thanked Egypt for its leading role in achieving regional peace and 
urged the Palestinians to take positive steps towards achieving 
security and peace in the region. He also asked the Arab States to 
take serious steps towards normalization with Israel to pave the way 
for a successful peace process. 
 
The dailies all run front page coverage on Mitchell's July 27 visit 
to the Palestinian Territories and meetings with Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam 
Fayyad. Al-Ayyam leads with news that Mitchell informed the 
Palestinians that the US is still committed to road map obligations 
concerning the cessation of settlement activity and assured the 
Palestinians that the US will not take any decision without 
consulting with them. The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) 
Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat noted to the press after the meetings 
that Mitchell informed Abbas that there is no US-Israeli agreement 
regarding the continuation of settlement construction. Erekat noted 
that the PA will continue to implement all of its road map 
obligations and that Israel must withdraw from all Arab land prior 
to normalizing relations under the terms of the Arab Peace 
Initiative. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage citing Wafa news agency 
that US Defense Minister Robert Gates arrived in Jordan on July 27 
after his visit to Israel. Gates met with King Abdullah and 
discussed efforts to achieve peace in the region. In a statement 
issued by the King's office, the King noted that "reaching a just 
and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian cause that leads to 
the establishment of a viable Palestinian state is the foundation 
for achieving peace and security in the region." King Abdullah 
praised US efforts to help resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
 
 
Al-Quds runs separate front page coverage citing AFP on the Israeli 
Minister of Trade and Commerce Binyamin Ben Eliezer noting on July 
27 that the US realizes that construction in West Bank settlements 
will continue. The minister noted that "the Americans have started 
to understand that construction underway to absorb needed natural 
growth in the settlements cannot be stopped," and added that the US 
realizes that Arab States are not ready to take steps towards 
normalization with Israel. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page coverage citing AFP that an official report 
published by the Israeli daily Haaretz notes that there are more 
than 300,000 settlers residing in the West Bank and that this number 
is increasing every day despite efforts to halt settlement 
activities. 
 
News on the Sixth Fatah Party Congress receives front page coverage 
in all Palestinian media. Al-Ayyam notes that the PA requested the 
mediation of Syria, Turkey, Russia and Egypt to convince Hamas to 
allow Fatah members residing in Gaza to participate in the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001283  002 OF 002 
 
 
conference scheduled for August 4 in Bethlehem. The coverage noted 
that the PA is ready to release 200 Hamas detainees in the West Bank 
as a gesture of goodwill.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"Will the European role continue to remain subsidiary to the US 
role?" (07/28): "Although the European countries try to express 
their reservations concerning settlements, checkpoints and closures, 
their positions are very timid...Everyone realizes that the European 
role is subsidiary to the US role, but at this stage it is necessary 
to have a more powerful and influential European role to ensure 
better support of the peace process, end the occupation, and halt 
t 
settlement activity." 
 
2) Hafeth Barghouti opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title "A peace with settlements" (07/28): "It seems like the 
Americans are convinced now that they can't force Israel to halt 
settlement activity...Therefore we see the US envoys visiting the 
Arab States to promote the idea of normalization and to encourage 
them to take steps that will contribute to building trust with 
Israel. This serves no one but Netanyahu and his vision of an 
economic peace".
