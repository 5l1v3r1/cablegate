regulations governing the import of U.S.-origin defense articles. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a July 17 meeting, owner of MXM Hunting Club Andrey 
Shelestov told us his company received the 99 firearms mentioned in 
reftel on May 14, 2008, and has since sold them to customers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Shelestov, MXM Hunting Club was founded in 
¶2000.  He became the owner of the MXM Hunting Club in April 2009, 
although he has been in the firearms business for about 10 years. 
Shelestov also owns stores in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, and 
Yaroslavl. 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Shelestov, MXM Hunting club sells sporting 
goods, including firearms, to sportsmen and hunters living primarily 
in the Moscow region.  His company also provides advice on hunting 
and firearms selection to customers.  Shelestov said he also planned 
to set up a website so customers can view the company catalogue and 
arrange for product sales online. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Shelestov told us MXM Hunting Club sold approximately 100 
U.S.-origin rifles (valued at around USD 150,000) and 200 
U.S.-origin shotguns (valued at around USD 300,000) in 2008. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The security of MXM Hunting Club facilities is in full 
compliance with Russian Federation law, according to Shelestov.  The 
company stores its firearms in a vault that is alarmed when they are 
not on display.  Only personnel trained by the Ministry of Interior 
are allowed in the vault. 
 
¶7. (SBU) According to local law enforcement, MXM Hunting Club is 
properly authorized to import and sell defense items in Russia. 
Local law enforcement has no information that would call into 
question MXM Hunting Club's reliability as a recipient of U.S. 
defense articles. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Shelestov told us MXM Hunting Club understood the 
regulations governing the import of U.S.-origin defense items, 
including the prohibitions against unauthorized re-transfers and 
re-exports.  Our assessment is that MXM Hunting Club is primarily a 
commercial venture, and we do not have reason to believe that the 
company would be an unreliable recipient of U.S.-origin defense 
items.
