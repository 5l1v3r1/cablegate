POLITICAL 
 
HURRIYET: Three PKK terrorists caught in Erzurum's Karacoban 
district told the prosecutor that the Karacoban district mayor 
(from DTP) was allegedly helping and providing aid to them.  The 
mayor, for his part, said that he provided phone units and 
hygiene supplies, under pressure from those terrorists. 
 
¶3.      HURRIYET: Diyarbakir's Security Directorate reportedly 
imposed fines on the cars of the Kayapinar district municipality 
on September 20.   Allegedly in response, Kayapinar 
Municipality, which is administered by the DTP, attempted to 
close down the building of the Security Directorate on grounds 
that the building lacked a residence permit.  The tension which 
has been going on between those two public institutions in 
Diyarbakir for months has been resolved as a result of the 
mediation efforts by the Governor's Office, according to the 
daily. 
 
¶4.      OZGUR GUNDEM: Special Team members reportedly conducted 
raids at many houses in a quarter of Hakkari's Yuksekova 
district for unknown reasons.   Meanwhile, jandarma teams caught 
13 illegal aliens in a passenger car they searched in Van's 
Muradiye district.  Twelve of the people were Afghanis and one 
of them was an Iraqi national.   Those people were traveling 
from Van to Istanbul. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM: The daily claimed that Turkish Armed Forces 
Foundation website at www.tsk.org.tr has been hacked by Kurdish 
hackers.  The hackers reportedly wrote the following statement 
on the site: "We sincerely back the cease-fire decision of the 
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and KKK."   (Note: Read KKK as the 
political wing of the PKK.) 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM: Despite the PKK's call for cease-fire, Turkish 
Armed Forces have been continuing its military operations in the 
region.   The daily claims that one soldier died in Diyarbakir's 
Lice district in one of those operations. 
OZGUR GUNDEM: Many people and non-governmental organizations in 
Diyarbakir, Mardin, Sirnak, Sanliurfa and Mersin gathered and 
condemned the anniversary of the alleged international plot 
against Abdullah Ocalan eight years ago which reportedly forced 
him out of Syria on October 9, 1998. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM: A German sociologist, who is also a counselor for 
a deputy from Democratic Socialism Party in Germany, conducting 
studies in Diyarbakir, said they were hoping that the cease-fire 
decision would bring permanent peace in the region.   The 
sociologist expressed concern over the increasing pressure on 
the Kurdish politicians and DTP members. 
 
¶8.      BOLGE:    Erkan Mumcu, National Leader of Motherland

significantly as compared to the previous year.
