SUBJECT: UNAMID - A VIEW FROM RURAL NORTH DARFUR 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  A March 24 visit by emboffs to UNAMID camps in 
Sector North revealed that UNAMID troops can make a difference on 
the ground as local populations trust UNAMID with their security 
concerns.  Nonetheless, discussions with UNAMID contacts in Um 
Kadada and Shangil Tobai also revealed a weak UNAMID public 
communications strategy and local perceptions that the Darfur Peace 
Agreement is an agreement between only the minority Zaghawa tribe 
and the Government of Sudan.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On March 24, emboffs traveled to the distant northern sector 
UNAMID base camps of Um Kadada and Shangil Tobai to conduct an 
inventory of high-end items (vehicles, generators, armored personnel 
carriers, etc.) for rotating Rwandan peacekeeping battalions. 
Emboffs will continue through March 30 conducting such inventories 
at base camps where Rwandans are located  (Note:  The results of the 
March 24 inventory will be sent via e-mail to interested parties. 
At the end of the week-long inventory, septel will follow. End 
Note). 
 
"WHEN THREATENED, THE IDPS CAME TO US"

¶3.  (SBU)  Following the inventory, UNAMID Civilian Police (civpol) 
representatives told emboffs that during one of the most recent 
conflicts in Shangil Tobai, internally displaced persons (IDP) 
immediately ran to the UNAMID camp asking for help.  Civpol stated 
that a conflict occurred approximately two weeks ago when Sudan 
Liberation Army fighters of Minni Minnawi (SLA-Minnawi) detained the 
Fur mayor (umdah) of the Shahada IDP Camp.  (Note:  The area of 
Shangil Tobai is controlled by the largely Zaghawa SLA-Minnawi 
faction.  Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are also present in the area. 
End Note).  Civpol stated that although the reason for the detention 
of the Fur umdah was not clear, it was part of an ongoing, low-level 
conflict between the Zaghawa and the Fur.  "They [the Fur IDPs] 
immediately came and started protesting outside of our gates," 
stated the civpol representative.  Civpol added that after 
consulting with the Fur leaders, UNAMID civpol and force protection 
appraced SLA-Minnawi leaders and began negotiations with them. 
According to civpol representatives, SLA-Minnawi released the Fur 
Umdah after one day and returned him to the Shahada camp. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Civpol and military observers (milobs) from UNAMID stated 
that the example above is not an isolated incident, as other IDPs 
continue to visit the UNAMID camp reporting crimes, asking for 
community interventions, and entrusting UNAMID with their security 
concerns.  "They are not afraid of us and feel comfortable coming 
here.  It is a good sign," stated one milob. 
 
¶5.  (U) Local Sudanese employees (mechanics, cooks, cleaners, and 
satellite TV technicians) were present in the UNAMID base camps at 
both Shangil Tobai and Um Kadada.  One civpol representative stated 
that the presence of these local Sudanese employees may have helped 
UNAMID improve its community relations.  One local Sudanese cleaning 
woman agreed, telling emboff that she not only appreciates the work, 
but that "now there is stability, peace, and a better life in 
Shangil Tobai." 
 
ALL IS NOT ROSY

¶6.  (SBU)  UNAMID civpols and milobs stated that although many 
Darfuris feel comfortable approaching UNAMID troops, many others do 
not understand their mission, nor the difference between AMIS and 
UNAMID.  UNAMID civpols stated that that they are not responsible 
for this public education.  "As SLA-Minnawi controls this area, they 
have to get out and tell the IDPs what we are about," stated one 
UNAMID civpol.  Another UNAMID Sudanese "language consultant" to 
UNAMID also cautioned that many Fur people from this region consider 
that UNAMID is intended to enforce the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), 
which they see as an agreement soley between the Zaghawa and the 
Government of Sudan.  "The Fur do not feel included in this 
agreement, and only see the Zaghawa benefiting - this could hurt us 
in the long-run" said this representative. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  It is encouraging that IDPs in one camp in 
North Darfur trust that UNAMID can solve inter-tribal tensions, feel 
comfortable approaching it, and associate UNAMID deployment with 
increased security.  This is peacekeeping at its best and, in the 
case of Shangil Tobai, may have prevented an ethnic conflict between 
the Fur and Zaghawa from quickly escalating.  This good news is 
tempered by other less encouraging reports, such as persistent local 
perceptions of the DPA as a narrow and ethnically-based agreement 
and these particular troops' attitude towards UNAMID's public 
information campaign as someone else's job. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Septels will follow this week on emboff visits to other 
UNAMID bases as part of the Rwandan battalion inventory.
