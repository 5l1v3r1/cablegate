SUBJECT: CONFERENCE REINFORCES BAHRAIN INTEREST IN 
POST-ICCP GCC METROLOGY SYSTEM 
 
 
¶1. NIST's Stephen Carpenter briefed ECON on May 10 regarding 
response to his participation at the Second Middle East 
Measurement and Instrumentation Conference and Exhibition. 
Carpenter reported that Bahrain is interested in setting up 
for the Gulf a regional metrology system to complement the 
existing five regional centers in the EU, Americas, 
Asia-Pacific, Former Soviet States and Southern Africa. 
Carpenter said that Assistant Undersecretary of Commerce 
Ahmed Isa Bubshait approached him to request assistance in 
organizing a metrology center and possibly a calibration 
laboratory in Bahrain.  Carpenter added that UAE Deputy 
Director General of Metrology Rashid bin Fahad seemed 
supportive of Bahrain's proposed undertaking.  Carpenter told 
ECON that he encouraged Bubshait first of all to bring 
together representatives from other Gulf countries to seek 
uniformity and agreement.  At that point NIST could share its 
experiences in organizing the system in the Americas, 
Carpenter said.  The project, he noted, would require a needs 
assessment for each of the potentially involved countries, a 
determination of the organization's structure, establishment 
of the system's objectives, and a study of regional training 
needs and ways to satisfy them. 
 
¶2. COMMENT: Ministry of Commerce officials repeatedly have 
indicated to post their interest in setting up testing labs 
and a metrology system for the region in Bahrain.  Bubshait's 
approaching Carpenter signals that this interest is serious 
and persistent.  Testing labs would be a new industry for 
Bahrain, one that fits with the type of clean industry 
Bahrain hopes to attract.  The establishment of regional 
testing labs in Bahrain would create jobs and thus support 
the success of a bilateral Free Trade Agreement. 
Furthermore, following up on Bubshait's request will allow us 
an opportunity to help shape a workable post-ICCP standards 
system for the Gulf.  END COMMENT.
