SUBJECT: GAZA HEALTH CARE BECOMES PAWN IN HAMAS-FATAH POWER 
STRUGGLE 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 1764 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  In reaction to Hamas' replacement of 
Fatah-affiliated hospital administrators in Gaza (reftel), 
the Fatah-affiliated labor unions of the Ministry of Health 
(MOH) in Gaza have been conducting work-stoppages as of 
August 23.  An estimated 95 percent of MOH hospital employees 
have been working only from 0800-1100, Sunday through 
Thursday, according to Gaza-based World Health Organization 
(WHO) contacts.  Union leaders have stated that the 
work-stoppage is scheduled until September 13, when a full 
strike may be called if Hamas does not stop "interfering in 
the Gaza health care sector."  Hamas, in turn, has threatened 
to close down Gaza's "private clinics," which are, in 
general, the homes of Fatah-affiliated physicians who have 
been consulting patients from home (and charging fees) since 
the work-stoppage began.  MOH pharmacies remain open only 
three hours each day and hospital in-patients are tended 
mostly by their family members.  End summary. 
 
Hamas-Fatah Battles 
Extend To Health Care 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gaza-based OCHA representative Hamada al-Bayari 
told econoff August 28 that Hamas replaced several 
PA-appointed hospital administrators in early August, 
alleging that they were unprofessional, incompetent and had 
stolen vast amount of hospital furniture for personal use. 
Gaza-based WHO information officer Dalia Salhah told econoff 
August 27 that the new Hamas-affiliated hospital 
administrators are experienced MOH hands, who, as a result of 
accepting the Hamas-filled positions, are no longer receiving 
PA salaries.  She said that these new Hamas-affiliated 
administrators accepted their new positions due to their 
Hamas loyalties, and may receive cash payments from Hamas in 
place of PA salaries. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Fatah-affiliated MOH unions in Gaza, including 
those of physicians, pharmacists, technicians, and 
administrators, instructed their membership on August 23 to 
conduct work-stoppages during all hours but 0800-1100, Sunday 
through Thursday, in protest of Hamas' replacement of 
high-level Fatah-affiliated hospital administrators. 
According to news reports, the work-stoppage was explicitly 
ordered by the Fatah political leadership.  Salhah said that 
roughly 95 percent of all MOH hospital employees have 
participated in the work-stoppages, limiting health care 
options for Gaza residents to private hospitals and clinics, 
and NGO health care facilities.  She said that the medical 
union leadership plans to continue the work-stoppage until 
September 13, when a full strike may be called if Hamas does 
not stop "interfering in the Gaza health care sector." 
 
 
Gaza Physicians Double-Dipping 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) OCHA's al-Bayari said that PA hospital physicians 
participating in the work stoppage are returning to their 
homes at 1100 to run private clinics, charging patients NIS 
40-50 (USD 10-12) per visit.  (Note:  News reports August 28 
state that Hamas plans to close-down all private clinics that 
are not licensed and registered.  Hamas has claimed that the 
striking doctors are taking advantage of Gaza's sick by 
earning full PA salaries and charging patients at private 
clinics in the afternoon hours.  End note) 
 
Nurses Affiliated With Hamas 
Resist Work Stoppage 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Salhah said that the MOH union of nurses in Gaza 
refused initially to participate in the work stoppages, as 
its members had been affiliated with Hamas and did not object 
strongly to Hamas' administrative changes.  She said that the 
PA threatened to withhold the nurses salaries, therefore the 
union leadership on August 26 instructed its membership to 
participate in the work stoppages. 
 
Poor Health Care Made Worse 
---------------------------

¶6.  (SBU) According to Salhah, Gaza MOH pharmacists are 
closing their operations at 1100 hours, as well, making it 
more difficult for Gazans for purchase medicine.  She 
underscored that emergency services have remained open 
24-hours a day in all public hospitals, with a select few 
nurses managing in-patient services around the clock.  She 
added that family members have been helping to care for 
patients requiring over-night hospitalization, but that 
hospital bed sheets, floors, and restrooms remain soiled, 
meals unavailable, and doctors' visits rare.
