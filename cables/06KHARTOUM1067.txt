¶1. (SBU) Security Update: 
 
¶A.  On May 3, an NGO convoy with an AU escort was stopped 
outside Mershing on the way to East Jebel Marra area by 
65 militia.  They warned the convoy that if they 
continued they would be shot.  The convoy returned to 
Nyala. 
 
¶B.  On May 2, Arab militias shot at the AU outside their 
compound in Marla.  Apparently this is the second such 
incident within a week - the AU was moving after dark, 
including relocating a fuel tanker, and the militia in 
the area opened fire on them though later apologized for 
mistaking them for SLA. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Humanitarian Update: 
 
NGOs suspended general activities in the Sania Afundu 
area due to increasing tensions and continued military 
movements.  The agencies have all deemed it too risky and 
will re-assess within the next 2 to 3 days for possible 
resumption of programs.
