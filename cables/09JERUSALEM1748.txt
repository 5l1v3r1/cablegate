SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (09/30): American Role in Peace 
Process is in Serious Question 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Lead UN investigator into the Gaza conflict Richard Goldstone's 
recommendation that his report be referred to the International 
Criminal Court receives highlighted coverage in all dailies. 
Leading with the story, both Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida quote 
Goldstone in their headlines saying that a "culture of impunity" in 
the region has to stop. Other related front-page stories report on 
Palestinian families' attempt to have Israeli Defense Minister Ehud 
Barak arrested in London for war crimes. Al-Ayyam reports that 
Barak's diplomatic immunity shielded him from being arrested during 
his short visit to the UK. 
 
"[Palestinian] Officials in Washington today and tomorrow indicate 
the possibility of the resumption of negotiations next month" is the 
lead headline in Al-Ayyam. Quoting unnamed Palestinian sources, the 
article states that "in light of the retreating American position on 
settlements," the meetings that are scheduled to take place between 
Israeli and Palestinian delegations with Special Envoy George 
Mitchell will indicate whether or not the two sides are ready to 
resume negotiations in the coming weeks. Al-Ayyam quotes Palestinian 
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad saying that the Palestinian Authority 
rejects Israel's attempt to exclude Jerusalem from the ongoing 
negotiations. 
 
Al-Ayyam quotes Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyya confirming that 
Hamas will sign a reconciliation agreement with Fatah by 
mid-October, the result of which should end the internal Palestinian 
division. Al-Quds reports that the Palestinian factions are 
satisfied with Hamas's position on Egypt's plan to end the internal 
division. Reports also note that Egypt suggested that Palestinian 
elections be held on June 25, 2010. 
 
Citing Israeli daily Ma'ariv, Al-Quds reports on a document that was 
passed on to Secretary of State Hilary Clinton by former Secretary 
Condoleezza Rice outlining the US plan to end to the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
¶1. Hamada Fara'neh commented in independent Al-Ayyam under the 
headline, "Reaching a settlement without a third party" (9/30): "It 
is not the first time that the US failed to forge an agreement 
between the Palestinians and Israelis, especially in regards to the 
final status issues ... It was unsuccessful in reaching an agreement 
at Camp David in July 2000. The negotiators left without an 
agreement or resolution, and history recorded it as a failure to 
make any progress toward ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
The Bush administration also failed to carry out its own plans 
launched in Annapolis. The only tangible agreement that was ever 
reached between the two sides took place only when the sides were 
themselves convinced it was a good idea and without any intervention 
from a third party." 
 
¶2. Independent Al-Quds ran an op-ed by Sa'ad Mahyo entitled, 
"America and the Middle East: A dangerous crossroad" (9/30): "There 
is a real crisis of an unprecedented American failure. Ever since 
the US gained power in the region in the aftermath of the Suez War 
of 1956 ... the US has neither been able to win its wars in the 
region, nor make peace in it. The question here is: can the US 
afford to lose the Middle East? The quick and obvious answer is 
 
JERUSALEM 00001748  002 OF 002 
 
 
absolutely not. In fact, the US is now facing a battle of life or 
death, especially as it relates to its world leadership."
