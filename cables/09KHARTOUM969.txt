SUBJECT: UNAMID CONVENES ROUNDTABLE FORUM ON DPA IMPLEMENTATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On August 19 UNAMID convened a roundtable meeting 
on implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) in El Fasher. 
Though billed as a discussion of DPA implementation and challenges, 
the meeting served primarily as a forum for representatives of 
SLA/Minni Minnawi (MM) to air their grievances on the lack of DPA 
implementation. They chastised the GOS, international community and 
UNAMID in equal measure for perceived indifference and lack of 
commitment to the DPA. UNAMID Joint Special Representative (JSR) 
Rodolphe Adada later proposed a mechanism be set up under the 
auspices of UNAMID to monitor DPA implementation modeled after the 
Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC) established by the CPA. 
The move was welcomed by SLM/MM; representatives of the GOS and the 
international community largely refrained from comment. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Senior Assistant to the President Minni Minnawi led a large 
SLM/MM delegation to the August 19 meeting, while the GOS was 
represented by Dr. Omar Adam Rahama of the Presidency. (NOTE: 
Minnawi openly questioned why the GOS official ostensibly charged 
with the Darfur portfolio, Dr. Ghazi Salaheddin, was in fact on his 
way to Juba for SE Gration's Trilateral Talks instead of UNAMID's 
DPA roundtable -eeting. END NOTE.) Also in attendance were 
representatives from the various obscure factions who signed 
Declaration of Commitment (DOC) to the DPA, including SLM/Free Will, 
JEM/Peace Wing, SLM/Peace Wing, SLM/Mother, and the Popular Force 
for Rights and Democracy (PFRD). Representatives from the 
international community included Ambassadors from the African Union 
(AU), League of Arab States, and Nigeria; Egypt's Special Envoy to 
Sudan; and poloffs from the EU, Netherlands, UK and"USG. The JMST 
was represented by Deputy Joint Chief Mediator Azouz Ennifar, and 
the meeting was chaired by UNAMID JSR Rodolphe Adada. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The meeting got off to an inauspicious start when SLA/MM's 
Head of DPA Implementation, Mohamed El Tijani, expressed his 
dissatisfaction with the agenda. When gently rebuked by JSR Adada, 
he retorted that SLA/MM had been trying to get UNAMID to host such a 
meeting for two years without success, and that it deserved a chance 
to be heard. Several hours of haranguing followed as members of 
SLA/MM and the DOC parties successively berated the GOS for its lack 
of sincerity, UNAMID for its lack of purpose, and the international 
community for its lack of commitment to the DPA. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A largely unstructured discussion followed in which a 
central point was the need for the DPA to be incorporated into 
Sudan's Interim Constitution. SLA/MM representatives complained that 
this had yet to take place despite the issuance of a Presidential 
Decree on the matter; GOS Representative Dr. Rahama retorted that 
the issue had in fact been transferred to the National 
Constitutional Review Commission (NCRC), where it was currently 
being reviewed. He added that questions remain whether the DPA in 
its entirety conforms to the Interim Constitution, or whether some 
provisions would have to be excluded or modified. SLA/MM Member of 
Parliament Ali Traio disputed this notion, arguing that it was a 
simple question of political will and noting that the CPA had not 
faced such difficulties. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Deputy Joint Chief Mediator Azouz Ennifar later provided an 
update on the current peace process in attempt to lead a discussion 
on the role of DPA signatories in this process going forward. SLM/MM 
representatives responded largely with disdain for the current peace 
process, and insisted that the DPA be formally declared the basis 
for any new peace agreement. While agreeing that the DPA was an 
important document, both Ennifar and Adada steadfastly refused to 
link it with ongoing peace process. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In attempt to bring the meeting to closure, Adada stated 
that while progress has been achieved on DPA implementation, 
numerous challenges remain. He noted that while the day's meeting 
had been useful, a more formal mechanism was needed to address DPA 
implementation. He therefore proposed a mechanism modeled after the 
Assessment and Evaluation Committee (AEC) established by the CPA, 
comprised of three representatives from the GOS; two from SLA-MM; 
one each from0the DOC signatories; international partners of the 
DPA; and UNAMID. He proposed that the mechanism would be chaired by 
one of the international partners. (NOTE: Representatives from the 
EU, Netherlands, UK and USG refrained from comment. END NOTE.) 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: While the DPA is by and large a good document, its 
lack of inclusiveness has proved to be its fatal flaw. With SLM/MM 
politically and militarily weaker than ever before, the GOS has very 
little incentive to implement the DPA at this point; it further 
needs save its political capital to expend at negotiations in Doha. 
The utility of an AEC style mechanism to monitor DPA implementation 
is thus highly questionable, though the role of SLM/MM in the peace 
process going forward and the status of the DPA in that context are 
important issues that need to be addressed. END COMMENT.
