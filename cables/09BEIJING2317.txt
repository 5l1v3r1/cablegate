¶1. CHINA'S ECONOMY 
 
"Europe and the United States envy China's economic trend" 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/12): "China's July Consumer Price Index 
and Producer Price Index have both dropped, which shows China's 
economy is continuously rising.  A British analyst indicates that 
China's economy is further developing which makes the west jealous. 
Mei Jun, deputy director of Finance and Securities Studies Institute 
at Ren Min University said that "although the economy is developing 
in a good direction, China's economy still doesn't have a concrete 
foundation."  China's recently-released economic data is not only 
used for domestic decision-making concerning the financial crisis, 
but also provides important information for many western economic 
experts when judging the world's economy.  Some conservative 
American think tanks doubt that China fabricates the data because it 
needs too.  Mei believes that some Westerners have a rather 
complicated mentality when looking at China's economy.  On the one 
hand, they hope China's economy will recover and assist the economic 
recovery of their own countries.  And on the other hand, they are 
worried that China's economy is developing too well, too fast.  They 
are a little jealous of China's success.  To remove the world's 
doubts, China has changed the way it publicizes data, so that China 
can transmit economic information in a transparent and direct way." 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
"China is no longer concerned about U.S. debt?  How can Hillary say 
this?" 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(08/12): "Secretary Clinton recently 
told CNN that she believes that Chinese concerns over the health of 
the U.S. financial system have been addressed.  However, China's 
concern over the security of its investments was not alleviated 
following the Strategic and Economic Dialogue.  The U.S. and China 
did not reach any new agreements in fields other than climate 
change, energy and environmental cooperation.  The Chinese 
delegation urged the U.S. to reasonably control the global supply of 
the USD.  However, the U.S., which is in the midst of the crisis, 
hopes to use a relaxed currency policy to stimulate economic growth. 
 No signs show that the confrontation has been resolved with 
dialogue.  Sun Lijian, professor of finance at Fudan University, 
said, 'We haven't yet seen signs of relief over U.S. debts.' 
Concerning Secretary Clinton's remarks, Sun commented that Clinton 
most likely said this because 'the U.S. and China probably reached a 
common agreement on how to handle China's foreign reserves. It is 
possible that the U.S. has heard China's opinion about its foreign 
reserves.'" 
¶3. CHINESE MILITARY 
"Chinese army needs to urgently upgrade their long-range delivery 
capability" 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/12): "Currently speaking, China there is 
still a large gap between developed countries in long-range delivery 
capability.  Developing this capability has been at the top of 
various countries' military construction agendas.  For China, 
upgrading their capability is not only a basic condition for being a 
power country, but will also ensure the stable and peaceful 
development of the country.  As one of the most important trade and 
economic powers, China's merchants and ships have reached every part 
of the world.  Without powerful long-range delivery capability, 
China's national and public interests can't be effectively 
protected.  Although there are still noises in the international 
community about "China's military threat," China's determination to 
develop their long-range delivery capability will not change.  It is 
not only China's People's Liberation Army's mission, but also a 
necessity for developing China's powerful national strength."
