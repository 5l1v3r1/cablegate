¶1. (SBU)  On January 19, Post Emergency Action Committee 
(EAC) Avian Influenza (AI) Subcommittee met with the Regional 
Medical Officer (RMO) to discuss Post preparedness.  The 
Subcommittee then held a follow-up meeting on January 26 to 
review the preparedness checklist as it pertains to Post 
operations, and reviewed Center for Disease Control (DCD) and 
World Health Organization (WHO) pandemic flu literature. 
Post has also held mission-wide AI briefings throughout the 
month of January by the RSO and Post Medical Advisor, and has 
offered additional briefings for family members.  The 
Community Liaison Office has made AI handouts available and 
has addressed AI in the weekly Embassy newsletter.  Post has 
issued two detailed staff notices with key facts about AI and 
preparedness measures.  Post is also nominating four 
candidates from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of 
Agriculture to attend an Avian Influenza training offered by 
the Department on April 23. 
 
¶2. (SBU) No cases of AI, nor of course of animal-to-human AI 
have been reported in Venezuela.
