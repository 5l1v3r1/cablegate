SUBJECT: MEETING WITH TURKISH OFFICIALS ON NUCLEAR 
SMUGGLING OUTREACH INITIATIVE 
 
REF: STATE 172634 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We have been working intensively with the MFA 
Disarmament and Arms Control Directorate to organize reftel 
meeting on the Nuclear Smuggling Outreach Initiative.  MFA 
officials have displayed great interest in having these 
initial discussions.  However, citing staff turnover and a 
number of competing commitments, they have requested we 
postpone this initial meeting until early in 2007. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA Disarmament and Arms Control Directorate 
officials have cited a number of competing priorities during 
the remainder of 006, including: participation in the PSI 
OEG eeting in Montreal next month, preparing to host the 
second meeting of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism in the first half of February 2007, UN First 
Committee issues, and issues associated with MTCR, Wassenaar, 
Australian Group and NPT.  The office is developing Turkish 
policy with regard to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear 
programs.  This small office has recently experienced a 50 
percent turnover of personnel and Deputy Director General 
Bulent Meric will be departing in mid-December for a new 
assignment. 
 
¶3. (SBU) MFA officials insist that Turkey is interested in an 
information exchange on nuclear smuggling, but wishes to 
ensure a productive initial meeting based on the availability 
of key staff and sufficient time.  As a result, we may wish 
to offer the GOT possible dates early in the new year, 
allowing the MFA sufficient time to prepare the successful 
meeting they claim to want.
