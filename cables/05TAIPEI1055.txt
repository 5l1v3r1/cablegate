SUBJECT: TAIWAN CONFIRMS ADHERENCE TO 12 CT CONVENTIONS AND 
PROTOCOLS 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on March 
4 provided AIT official documentation confirming Taipei's 
adherence to the 12 international  counterterrorism (CT) 
conventions and protocols.  In December 2004, the 
Counterterrorism Action Group (CTAG) requested AIT verify 
that Taiwan is in compliance with the 12 CT conventions and 
protocols.  Via e-mail, AIT provided Washington with MOFA's 
interim response that said Taiwan is not permitted to be a 
signatory of the 12 conventions and protocols due to its 
international isolation.  MOFA officials, however, have 
assured AIT that Taiwan is committed unilaterally to follow 
the 12 convention and protocol guidelines and would provide 
AIT formal documentation of its compliance for passage to the 
CTAG.  AIT will forward copies of MOFA's response to the CTAG 
for review.
