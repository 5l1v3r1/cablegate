¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  Alleged links between the investigation into 
the Ergenekon deep state gang (ref A) and the chief public 
prosecutor's closure case against the ruling Justice and 
Development Party (AKP) are both difficult to prove and 
impossible to ignore.  Although evidence of a direct link 
remains largely circumstantial -- and hard to come by in the 
face of a court-imposed gag order on the Ergenekon 
investigation -- the progression of each case has clear 
implications for the other.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Links between Ergenekon and AKP Closure Case 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶2. (C) Detention of several prominent leftist 
ultranationalist figures March 21 -- the first Ergenekon 
raids since the Chief Public Prosecutor's March 14 indictment 
against AKP -- unleashed a media furor that unambiguously 
linked the two as a confrontation between AKP and "Kemalist 
forces."  The closure case was said to be retaliation for the 
Ergenekon crackdown, and the subsequent high-profile 
detentions were seen as tit-for-tat for the closure case. 
Prime Minister Erdogan charged March 17 that the closure case 
was revenge for uprooting deep state gangs "like Ergenekon" 
(ref B), although prominent AKPers Abdullatif Sener and 
Mehmet Saglam privately reject Erdogan's claim. 
 
¶3. (C) "Cumhuriyet" daily is the site of much of the 
circumstantial evidence, rallying leftist ultranationalists 
who agree with the chief prosecutor that the time has come to 
take extra-political measures to stop AKP.  Ilhan 
Selcuk, "Cumhuriyet's" Editor-in-Chief who was detained as 
Ergenekon's alleged intellectual leader, mentioned in a 
February editorial, "If a closure case is opened and that 
triggers an economic crisis, then that will stir Turkey. 
There may be some hope."  A February article by retired 
General Dogu Silahcioglu -- who has not been implicated in 
Ergenekon but was deeply involved in the February 28 process 
that pulled the rug out from under Necmettin Erbakan's 
Islamist-oriented government in 1997 -- also articulated the 
need to "push AKP from power" in the fight against political 
Islam (ref C).  Pro-government Yeni Safak columnists point 
out that former National Security Council members and 
high-ranking officers have joined the Cumhuriyet Newspaper 
Foundation administration upon retirement, including 
Silahcioglu, Aytac Yalman, and Sener Eruygur, who also heads 
the Ataturkist Thought Association.  Yalman and Eruygur were 
named last spring as coup plotters in Admiral Ornek's leaked 
diaries -- reportedly detailing plans to oust the AKP 
government. 
 
¶4. (C) Proponents of a link cite as evidence of complicity 
between the prosecutor and some Ergenekon suspects media 
reports that a copy of the AKP closure indictment, obtained 
from one of the Ergenekon detainees' computers, was dated two 
days before the indictment was filed. 
 
Military and Intelligence Community Complicity? 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) "Radikal" daily published on April 5 the "chart and 
charter" of Ergenekon, based on a 1999 document allegedly 
seized in the houses of detainees Tuncay Guney, retired 
Captain Muzaffer Tekin, retired General Veli Kucuk, and 
retired Major Zekeriya Ozturk.  The document, which describes 
Ergenekon as operating within the armed forces, outlines a 
rigidly compartmentalized structure of a president, four 
commands, and two civilian departments.  Only the Ergenekon 
president would be aware of the existence of the Operations 
command.  Techniques outlined in the document include 
creation of terrorist groups, cooperation with legal or 
illegal organizations, assassination, disinformation, 
 
ANKARA 00000680  002 OF 003 
 
 
establishing NGOs and media, and illegal fundraising. 
Internal executions of double agents would be carried out by 
select military personnel who had served in special 
operations units. 
 
6.(C/NOFORN) Non-public information obtained during Ergenekon 
raids also suggests potential military and intelligence 
community complicity.  Embassy Legatt reports the Ankara 
branch of the Turkish National Police (TNP) has detailed 50 
officers to Istanbul to process 1000 CDs obtained during the 
raid on Labor Party (IP) leader Dogu Perincek's office 
building.  Perincek is imprisoned on charges of being "a 
high-level administrator in the Ergenekon terrorist 
organization," and several of his aides have been arrested as 
well.  In addition to IP, the building contains offices of 
Perincek affiliates, Aydinlik weekly and Ulusal Kanal 
television.  The CDs contained mainly military information, 
some of which was classified top secret, as well as top 
secret information from the National Intelligence 
 
SIPDIS 
Organization (MIT). 
 
¶7. (C/NOFORN) According to Legatt's TNP contacts, seized 
documents reveal evidence of several plots.  The linchpin 
plot appears to be the assassination of Chief Public 
Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, author of the AKP closure 
indictment.  His assassination -- much like the 2006 attack 
on the High Administrative Court (Danistay) that resulted in 
the death of one justice -- would be attributed to Islamic 
radicals acting on behalf of AKP.  The political and economic 
crises that could result from this or other similar events 
could create an opening for second-tier military to launch a 
coup and "force the retirement" of their seniors.  Some of 
the documents seized reportedly implicate senior officers in 
the Aegean Army (NFI).  Perpetrators of a "colonels' coup," 
contacts maintain, willingly risk endangering relations with 
the European Union and US. 
 
The US Angle: Guilty on All Counts 
---------------------------------- 
¶8. (C) Commentators on both sides name the US as the 
behind-the-scenes puppeteer, stemming from a deeply and 
widely held belief that the US supported Turkey's past 
military coups. "Cumhuriyet" has regularly pushed the 
apparently contradictory but also widely-held belief that the 
US brought AKP to power to showcase Turkey as a moderate 
Islamic republic, with the Broader Middle East and North 
Africa initiative (BMENA) as the mechanism for instituting 
this new order.  Echoing the theme, the Chief Prosecutor 
alleges in the closure case indictment that BMENA and the 
"Moderate Islam Project" allow AKP to hide its sharia goals 
behind appeals to democracy, freedom of faith, and freedom of 
education (ref E). 
 
¶9. (C) Others accuse the US of abandoning its AKP ally. 
Samil Tayyar, writer of a recent book on Ergenekon, argued 
in "Star" daily that AKP's failure to support an operation 
against Iran, refusal to support a Kurdish state in 
northern Iraq, and failure to furnish combat troops to 
Afghanistan caused the US to shift to "Plan B," to eliminate 
AKP.  "As it used the PKK as an instrument against Turkey," 
the US is now using Ergenekon against AKP, Tayyar maintained. 
 He claimed that if AKP cuts a deal with the US, the closure 
case might evaporate. 
 
¶10. (C/NOFORN) COMMENT.  The progression of the Ergenekon and 
AKP cases is now inextricably tied together.  The 
Ergenekon investigation may implicate high-level officials, 
both military and civilian; the further it goes, the 
greater the risk existing confrontation between elected 
government and the state will intensify.  The Ergenekon 
probe, which has yet to produce an indictment in nine months, 
remains a test of both the government's (and police) resolve 
and capacity.  TESEV's Foreign Policy Program Director Mensur 
Akgun worried from the outset about the GOT's ability to find 
prosecutors and others willing to take on the "deep state" 
system (ref A).  The closure case could well cause TNP's 
commitment to pursuing Ergenekon to falter; AKP closure could 
be disastrous for TNP leadership, who are now largely 
 
ANKARA 00000680  003 OF 003 
 
 
pro-AKP, beholden to their political masters, and have stuck 
their necks out on Ergenekon.  END COMMENT.
