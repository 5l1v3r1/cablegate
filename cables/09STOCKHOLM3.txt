SUBJECT: SWEDISH CHARTER AIRCRAFT STARTS A REGULAR FLIGHT 
TO BAGHDAD 
 
¶1. On January 2, Nordic Airways, a Swedish private sector 
company, flew its first flight to Baghdad, carrying 150 
passengers to Baghdad International Airport (BIA). According 
to Swedish press, this marks the first commercial passenger 
flight from Europe to the Iraqi capital since the UN imposed 
sanctions on Iraq after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait.  Iraqi Transport Minister Amer Abduljabbar Ismail 
told journalists that he expects additional international 
flights in the next two days.  Iraq's Transport Ministry 
signed a preliminary agreement earlier in the week with Air 
France-KLM that will allow Iraqi Airways to fly to European 
destinations, according to Ismail.  The agreement also calls 
for BIA to be renovated. 
 
¶2. In addition to this new Baghdad flight, Swedish charter 
companies have for several years flown to the northern Iraqi 
cities of Erbil and Suleimaniya.  Sweden has Europe's largest 
Iraqi immigrant community, with official estimates of between 
120,000 and 150,000.
