Belgium has nominated Brussels examining magistrate Judge 
Daniel Fransen to be one of the non-Lebanese judges at the 
international Special Tribunal for Lebanon in the Hague. 
According to a BELGA news report, Fransen is a specialist in 
terrorist cases who brought Belgium's cases against the 
Belgian cell of the Maroccan Islamic network connected to 
attacks in Madrid and Casablanca as well as its Belgian 
subgroup that sent Jihad candidates to Iraq, including the 
first European woman suicide-bomber.  Fransen issued an 
international mandate against former Chad leader Hissen 
Habre, then an international fugitive.
