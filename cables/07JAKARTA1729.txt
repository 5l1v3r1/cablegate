1.(SBU) Summary.  On June 13-14, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), 
Food and Animal Organization (FAO) and the National Committee on 
Avian Influenza Control and Pandemic Preparedness (KOMNAS) hosted a 
two-day technical workshop focusing on controlling avian influenza 
(AI) in animals.  Participants committed to new pledges and 
identified shortcomings to the government's attempts to control the 
disease in the animal population.  The Indonesian press continued to 
run numerous avian influenza articles, including a TEMPO (weekly 
news magazine) interview with Minister of Health Siti Fadilah Supari 
on sample sharing and articles on vaccine development.  On June 21, 
the Ministry of Health (MOH) gave permission for newly arrived 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) officer Dr. Mike Thomas to propose 
a joint US-GOI work plan.  A visiting CDC contractor began a 90-day 
work program on June 5 to help get the Eijkman Institute Biosafety 
Level 3 (BSL 3) laboratory operational.  On June 19, a visiting CDC 
media expert began his Indonesian speaking tour to help Indonesia 
raise public awareness of AI.  The MOH announced another fatal human 
AI case on June 12, raising the total cases to 100, with 80 deaths. 
End Summary. 
 
KOMNAS MEETING EVALUATES AI CONTROL IN ANIMALS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (SBU) At the two-day workshop hosted by MOA, FAO, and KOMNAS on 
June 13-14, participants committed to new pledges and identified 
shortcomings with the government's attempts to control the disease 
in the animal population.  Donors conveyed the message that the 
large amount of money flowing into Indonesia is due to the threat of 
a pandemic, and the money will not flow forever.  Participants cited 
the lack of significant budgetary and political commitments from the 
GOI and the lack of widespread buy-in from local governments and 
private, commercial poultry producers as significant gaps to 
controlling the disease. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Several participants suggested a significantly strengthened 
role for the Chief Veterinary Officer to include oversight of 
commercial and private poultry production and authority over all 
disease control efforts.  Participants also repeatedly questioned 
the effectiveness of animal vaccines currently used in Indonesia, as 
well as the consistency of delivery and application.  The MOA 
stresses the need for vaccination, but participants disagreed on 
whether blanket or targeted ring vaccination strategies are more 
appropriate. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  In a June 21 follow-up call with Dr. Tri Satya Putri 
Naipospos (Tata), Secretary to KOMNAS, Dr. Tata noted that the MOA 
had not/not made budget cuts to its program.  Tata explained that 
the GOI organizes AI funds in various ministries, which makes 
answering budget questions difficult.  She claimed the KOMNAS does 
not have AI budget data for Indonesia.  Tata noted KOMNAS' interest 
in raising the transparency of the AI budgeting process in order to 
assure the donor community that the GOI remains committed to 
combating the disease. 
 
INDONESIAN PRESS FOLLOWS SAMPLE SHARING 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) In the June 18 issue of TEMPO, one of Indonesia's leading 
weekly newsmagazines, Minister Supari describes Indonesia's struggle 
to change the WHO regulations on sample sharing to become more 
equitable.  Minister Supari describes "It was a hard fight because 
we faced the United States head on."  The article alluded to the 
upcoming October intergovernmental health meeting where participants 
will develop the changes to these regulations. Supari also described 
Indonesia's collaboration with Baxter Health Care and mentioned that 
Indonesian officials planned to conduct clinical tests on the H5N1 
vaccine produced by the US-based manufacturer. (However, a 
spokesperson at Baxter denied planning such testing in Indonesia.) 
The MOH also stated that they expect the release soon of an early 
diagnosis test for H5N1 currently in development in Singapore. 
 
¶6. (U) Supari described the APEC health ministers' meeting in Sydney 
 
JAKARTA 00001729  002 OF 002 
 
 
in the June 9 issue of Seputar Indonesia, a daily newspaper.  Supari 
stated, "We endorse sample-sharing as stated in a WHO resolution." 
APEC health ministers agreed to ensure and support AI sample 
sharing. 
 
¶7. (U) On June 21, the Jakarta Post reported that the GOI will hold 
another round of discussions with the World Health Organization 
(WHO) in July about the authority of using AI vaccines from the WHO. 
Health Minister Supari stated, "We will meet again next month to 
renegotiate (on bird flu vaccines)."  She added that the government 
wanted to have direct authority to use the vaccine.  The Minister 
said the WHO wanted the government to maintain the supply of the 
vaccine and to only use it in case of a pandemic.  She said that it 
would take six months to prepare the vaccine. The government has 
expected to secure a deal with the WHO about the use of the bird flu 
vaccine. 
 
CDC GETS GREEN LIGHT TO WORK, 
MEDIA EXPERT BEGINS SPEAKING TOUR 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) On June 21, the influenza headquarters at the Indonesian 
Center for Disease Control and Environmental Health gave newly 
arrived Dr. Mike Thomas permission to begin to develop a joint plan 
for collaborative work.  A Singaporean-funded WHO epidemiologist 
recently arrived and may share temporary office space with the US 
CDC officials at the MOH. 
 
¶9. (SBU) On June 5, visiting CDC contractor Thomas Rowe, began a 
ninety day assignment at the Eijkman Institute to help get its BSL-3 
laboratory operational.  The President of Indonesia plans to 
celebrate the opening of the lab in early July. 
 
¶10. (U) On June 19, Dan Rutz, acting director of the Division of 
Partnerships and Strategic Alliances, CDC National Center for Health 
Marketing, began an eleven-day program in Indonesia.  His goal is to 
meet with the media, students in journalism schools, and government 
and NGO spokespersons to discuss ways to raise public awareness of 
AI without causing panic. 
 
AI HUMAN CASE REPORTS 
--------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) The MOH reported one new fatal human AI case since reftel A. 
 The number of bird flu fatalities in Indonesia has risen to 80 with 
the death of a 29-year-old male patient in Riau province on June 12. 
 As of June 21, the MOH reports 100 human cases, with a case 
fatality rate of 80%.
