--------------------------- 
U.S. TO REMAIN ACTIVE IN OSCE 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Secretary Rice appeared on May 31, 2007 before the 
heads of delegations of the 56 OSCE States at a special 
meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council chaired by 
Ambassador Carlos Sanchez de Boado representing the 
Spanish Chairmanship.  Setting aside her formal remarks to 
allow more time for discussion, Secretary Rice said the 
OSCE was doing important work to consolidate a Europe that 
is whole, free, democratic, and at peace.  Citing OSCE's 
work in support of elections, human rights, and the 
European security architecture, the Secretary pledged that 
the United States would continue to remain active and play 
a leadership role in the OSCE. 
 
¶5. (U) Germany, on behalf of the EU and several other 
countries, praised U.S.-EU cooperation, highlighted the 
importance of the CFE as a bedrock of European security, 
and spoke of the need for cooperation in resolving the 
frozen conflicts in Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. 
Canada and Norway expressed similar viewpoints.  Georgia 
called on Russia to fulfill its Istanbul commitments, 
which would allow for Adapted CFE ratification, and called 
for the diversification of energy supplies and 
distribution networks.

RUSSIA MILD ON CFE, OSCE REFORM { SEEKS DIALOGUE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6. (U) Russian Ambassador Borodavkin said Russia sought 
new possibilities for Russian/U.S. cooperation in the 
 
 
OSCE, citing the example of the Russia/U.S.-sponsored 
Private Public Partnership Conference on Combating 
Terrorism taking place in Vienna that very day.  Russia 
and the United States could also cooperate on providing 
assistance to Afghanistan to improve border security (see 
para 9) and promoting tolerance and non-discrimination, 
especially the dialogue of civilizations and the 
protection of ethic minorities, he said. 
 
¶7. (U) Borodavkin listed missile defense, CFE, frozen 
conflicts and the need for OSCE reform as areas where US 
and Russian positions differed, but said cooperation at 
the OSCE in other fields was possible.  He renewed Russian 
criticisms of the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions 
and Human Rights (ODIHR) and cited the need to make ODIHR 
accountable to the Permanent Council.  He said giving 
impetus to the OSCE was in the interests of all 
participating states. 
 
¶8. (U) Secretary Rice told the delegates that a discussion 
was necessary to respond to Russian questions on the CFE, 
and she insisted that the treaty remained important to the 
security architecture of Europe.  She underscored that 
Russia must implement fully its Istanbul commitments.  In 
addition, she identified common issues such as the fight 
against terrorism, nuclear nonproliferation, and work to 
enhance and solidify a Europe that is whole, free, and at 
peace.  The Secretary indicated that the United States has 
high hopes for the June 7-8 Bucharest Conference on 
Tolerance and stressed the importance of tolerance issues 
for the OSCE. 
 
------------------------------------ 
PROPOSALS FOR AFGHANISTAN ASSISTANCE 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (U) The EU, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan spoke 
in favor of possible OSCE involvement in Afghanistan.  In 
particular, they supported projects to improve border 
security in Afghanistan to stop the flow of drugs and arms 
across that country's common border with three OSCE 
countries.   Secretary Rice welcomed the OSCE's interest 
and said she looked forward to a discussion of what role 
the OSCE might play given the other actors involved in 
supporting Afghanistan. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
SERBIA PLEADS FOR KOSOVO RECONCILIATION 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) Serbian Ambassador Beham made a plea for more work 
on reconciliation between Serbia and Kosovo.  Beham 
acknowledged differences between the United States and 
Serbia, but said those differences could be overcome 
through additional dialogue and compromise, as well as 
through confidence-building measures between Belgrade and 
Pristina.  Secretary Rice restated U.S. support for the 
Ahtisaari plan, saying that Ahtisaari worked to get the 
best deal possible and that now was the time to move 
forward and let go of the past.  The Secretary also 
emphasized U.S. support for Euro-Atlantic integration for 
Serbia, and said she expected that a democratic Serbia 
would find its full and rightful place in Europe.
