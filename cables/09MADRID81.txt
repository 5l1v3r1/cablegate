¶1. (U) This is an action request, please see paragraph five. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY. Ricardo Ortega was a Spanish journalist 
shot and killed in Haiti in 2004 while covering the unrest 
there.  There have been repeated suggestions in the media 
here that U.S. forces fired the shot that killed him.  The 
Spanish National Court commenced an investigation into his 
death in June 2008.  We received an MLAT request in August 
2008 (forwarded to DOJ) and more recently a request from the 
Spanish Civil Guard for information related to the case.  The 
most recent request seeks information on named USG officials 
in Haiti at the time of Ortega's death as well as information 
regarding U.S. forces there.  On January 23, Spain's Council 
of Ministers authorized the declassification of a 2005 secret 
investigative report on Ortega's death, and Vice President 
Fernandez de la Vega told the press that Spain will "spare no 
effort" to clarify the circumstances of this case.  Post 
requests instructions regarding a response to the Spanish 
information requests.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (U) Ortega was fatally wounded March 7, 2004, during a 
anti-Aristide demonstration in Port-au-Prince.  Weeks after 
his death, Aristide supporters Yvon Antoine and Haitian 
Police Inspector Jean-Michel Gaspard were arrested and 
investigated for their involvement in the demonstration. 
Both were released and neither charged.  After conducting its 
own investigation in 2004, Spain's Antena 3 television 
station (Ortega's employer), concluded that U.S. forces could 
have fired the fatal shot.  In April 2007, Spanish 
authorities called on Haiti to create a joint official 
commission to investigate the case, but no such commission 
was formed, and the case continued within the Haitian system. 
 We understand Spanish Ambassador to Haiti Paulino Gonzalez, 
accompanied by a Spanish special investigative envoy, called 
on the U.S. Ambassador to Haiti on two occasions (in 2005 and 
2007) seeking U.S. cooperation.  Spanish FM Moratinos 
accompanied Ortega's family to Haiti in April 2008 to 
retrieve the Haitian court's investigative results, and 
shortly thereafter the family disclosed the findings, which 
included an assertion that foreign soldiers may have killed 
Ortega.  The Spanish press reported that the Haitian judge 
named U.S. forces but did not include that assertion in his 
findings since he had insufficient evidence. 
 
¶4. (U) In August 2008, we received a MLAT request (forwarded 
to DOJ), seeking contact information for two journalists who 
were witnesses and also for relevant U.S. military records 
(our understanding is that U.S. forces went to the scene and 
rendered medical assistance after Ortega was shot).  That 
request did not suggest USG personnel were a target of the 
investigation.  On January 7, 2009, LEGAT received a request 
for law enforcement cooperation from the Civil Guard.  That 
request (which we have e-mailed to L/DL and EUR/WE) seeks 
contact information for three named U.S. officials in Haiti 
at the time Ortega was shot, identification of officers 
commanding U.S. military personnel in Haiti at the time, 
reports regarding the activities of U.S. forces that day, and 
information on ammunition used by U.S. forces (our 
understanding is that no bullet was recovered from Ortega's 
body).  It is unclear why the Civil Guard has made this 
latest request and done so outside of MLAT channels. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action request:  Post requests instructions on 
responding to the Spanish requests.  Regarding the second 
request, our recommendation is that we advise the Civil Guard 
we cannot respond and that Spain should continue to pursue 
any information requests relative to this case via the MLAT 
channel.  That said, we would appreciate DOJ cooperation in 
facilitating an expeditious response to the original and any 
subsequent MLAT requests, to the maximum extent consistent 
with U.S. interests.  If for any reason we do not respond or 
do not respond fully, we should expect the Spanish 
authorities to attribute their inability to clarify the 
circumstances of Ortega,s death to U.S. unwillingness to 
cooperate.  The Spanish press would doubtless paint this as 
the U.S. having something to hide.  More generally, failure 
to respond in a timely fashion to Spanish MLAT requests can 
affect other USG priorities with Spanish judicial authorities.
