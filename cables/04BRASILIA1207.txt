(S) DATT and Econoff met with ANATEL's (Brazil's telecom 
regulator) General Satellite Manager Sueli Aruajo, 
Supervision of Satellite Services Manager Paulo Machado, 
Operations Manager Jose Amado, and Engineer Jaime Ono on May 
Â¶14.  We delivered Reftel talking points and left a copy in 
English with the ANATEL team.  They asked specifics about the 
types of interference, which frequency channels are affected, 
how often, and during what times of the day.  DATT committed 
to obtaining these answers and will transmit the answers to 
Econoff, who will respond to ANATEL.  DATT offered a 
technical team to assist ANATEL discover the sources of 
interference, but our interlocutors responded that assistance 
is not required at this time.  The ANATEL team promised to 
investigate the frequencies further, and when the sources are 
found, will advise and consult with us further.
