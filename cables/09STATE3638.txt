SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050139731 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050139731 for the export 
of C-130 aircraft component parts to Brazil.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Verify the Brazilian Air Force's 
relationship unfamiliar foreign intermediate consignee, 
Digex.  The company has appeared on previous licenses but the 
company's bona fides have not yet been verified by a Blue 
Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION BRASILIA: Embassy is requested to make inquiries 
with appropriate host government officials to determine if 
the Brazilian Air Force ordered the C-130 aircraft component 
parts from Digex and if so, confirm that the articles will be 
used for the purpose stated on the license.  PM/DTCC also 
requests that post conducts a site visit to Digex in order to 
provide Department with an assessment of its business 
operations and on-site security.  Finally, post is asked to 
assess whether the company appears to be a reliable recipient 
of USML items.  If a site visit is not possible, please 
inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
END ACTION 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
transaction?  Are all of the USML parts going to the 
Brazilian Air Force? 
 
--Does the company have proper accounting and security 
procedures for handling USML items? 
 
--Will Digex retain positive control over the C-130 aircraft 
component parts at all times? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
--Does the company understand the prohibition against the 
unauthorized stockpiling of USML items?
