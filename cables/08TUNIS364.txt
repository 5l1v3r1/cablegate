REF: A. TAYLOR-KANE E-MAIL DATED 4/4/2008 
     ¶B. STATE 28712 
     ¶C. 07 TUNIS 471 
     ¶D. 07 TUNIS 453 
 
¶1. Embassy Tunis submits the following proposal for an 
Embassy Science Fellow (ESF).  Our request for an ESF from 
the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the field of 
engineering is a resubmission of our 2007 proposal (Ref B). 
Due to difficulties with timing, the ESF selected for Embassy 
Tunis was unable to participate in the program.  The Science 
Fellow would identify potential partnerships between Tunisian 
and US educational and research institutions and participate 
in Embassy public outreach activities.  The placement of a 
fellow would help to strengthen activities and collaboration 
under the bilateral Science and Technology Cooperation 
Agreement signed in 2004. 
 
¶2. The Government of Tunisia has expressed great enthusiasm 
for increasing educational and research partnerships and 
exchanges with the United States.  By creating such 
partnerships, this project will have a lasting impact not 
only on collaborative research, but will also foster mutual 
understanding.  Both the Minister of Higher Education, 
Research and Training and the Minister of Industry have 
recently emphasized that Tunisia's future economic success 
will depend on embracing technological advances and 
developing science and technology (Ref C).  Tunisian 
institutions have focused particularly on engineering, 
especially in power and communications technology.  Tunisia 
views itself as a leader in science and technology in Africa 
and is eager to play an international role.  In June 2007, 
Tunisia hosted a World Federation of Engineering Organization 
conference for women in engineering. 
 
¶3. Post requests an NSF fellow with expertise in engineering, 
preferably power or environmental.  The NSF has previously 
funded several successful collaborations between US and 
Tunisian universities and there is great potential for future 
cooperation.  A Science Fellow from the NSF would work 
closely with the Ministry of Higher Education and 
institutions like the Cite des Sciences (Science City) to 
identify potential research and educational partnerships with 
US partner institutions.  The Cite des Sciences hosts 
exhibitions and lectures and serves as a resource for 
Tunisian schools and universities.  In the field of 
engineering, currently the Ecole Polytechnique, Tunisia's 
premier engineering university, is the only Tunisian 
institution to have partnerships with US universities.  Ecole 
Polytechnique has partnerships with Virginia Tech and the 
University of Houston that involve student exchanges, joint 
research, and faculty workshops and seminars.  The Cite des 
Sciences is a publicly-funded institute that aims to 
familiarize the Tunisian population with science and 
technology, making it a natural partner for the NSF. 
 
¶4. While in Tunisia, the Science Fellow will visit 
educational and research institutions throughout the country 
and will also have the opportunity to participate in Embassy 
public diplomacy efforts.  US speakers with a scientific 
background have been enthusiastically received by the 
Tunisian public.  The Fellow may also give lectures and 
conduct workshops at the universities and institutions he/she 
visits. 
 
¶5. French or Arabic language skills are preferable to 
facilitate outreach activities such as seminars and 
interviews, but are not required.  English is increasingly 
being used as the language of instruction in engineering. The 
Embassy will provide housing and work space for the Fellow. 
The Public Affairs Section will provide logistical support. 
Post requests a timeframe of two months between November and 
February to coincide with the school year.  As the assignment 
will be less than 60 days, the Fellow will not require a 
medical clearance.  A security clearance is not required.
