(SBU) MFA Director for International Organization Affairs 
Ghassan Shaikho told Pol/Econ Chief March 15 that Bahrain's 
candidate for president of the 2006-07 UNGA session, Shaikha 
Haya bint Rashed Al Khalifa, was now Asia's single candidate 
for the position.  He said it was Asia's turn in the 
position, and the Asian bloc had already endorsed her. 
Shaikha Haya's election was now only a "procedural matter." 
Shaihko said Bahrain wanted U.S. support for her candidacy in 
the run-up to the election, and suggested that the Crown 
Prince and Foreign Minister's Washington visit (March 19-23) 
would be a good opportunity to discuss the issue.  Shaikho 
said Shaikha Haya was a highly qualified candidate and her 
serving as UNGA president would send a positive message about 
the role of women in the Arab and Muslim worlds.
