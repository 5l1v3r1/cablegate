¶1. (SBU) According to Hasan Yalcin, Turkish Foreign Trade 
Undersecretariat (FTU) Deputy Director General for 
Multilateral Agreements, Turkey supports the U.S. proposal 
but wants an agreement with the EC that would consolidate the 
two papers into one compromise proposal.  He added that it 
would be difficult to side against the EC, especially at a 
time when the two sides are still seeking a possible 
solution.  According to Yalcin, Turkish representatives at 
the WTO plan to submit a formal response to U.S. questions 
about the proposal and will attend the May 7 morning meeting 
organized by the U.S. delegation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On the substance of the U.S. proposal, Yalcin said 
that FTU officials have two minor issues.  For the labeling 
requirements for footwear, they do not believe that country 
of origin is sufficient and would like to see material 
content labeling required.  They also feel that Article 
1.a.i.'s mention of "information necessary for consumer 
safety" is too broad and ambiguous and needs to be better 
defined. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Yalcin raised Turkey's proposed joint declaration on 
the textile sector, which it would also like to issue during 
May 7 "NAMA week."  As he did during an April meeting in 
Washington with the USTR Textile Negotiator, he asked for 
quiet U.S. encouragement of producer countries to join the 
planned Turkish declaration, which will emphasize the 
sensitive nature of the textile sector.  Such support could 
me most useful with Central and South American producers, as 
well as Mediterranean producers like Jordan and Egypt.  He 
understands that the United States cannot join the 
declaration.
