SUBJECT: KABUL-PARIS DIRECT ACCESS MEDIA PROJECT 
 
¶1.   (U) Please see request for mission action in paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (U) Embassy Paris plans an exchange for Afghan television 
leaders to build relations with French counterparts.  The 
goal is to establish partnerships in creating and 
disseminating programs about Afghanistan, and to increase the 
visibility of Afghan produced programs for French-speaking 
audiences.  In this way, French audiences will have greater 
direct access to in-depth news from Afghanistan, access that 
can help to strengthen French support for U.S. policy.  Post 
notes that the most effective programs in influencing French 
public opinion thus far have been tied to visits by Afghans. 
Programs involving a group visit by Afghan women 
parliamentarians and a separate visit by Afghan governors 
were both well-received with positive media coverage.  The 
French media very much value the opportunity to speak 
directly with Afghans, especially those outside of the 
central government in Kabul, as they are very effective in 
telling their own story of current challenges and needs. 
 
¶3.  (U) We have made preliminary contact with SCA/PPD and 
Kabul Public Affairs (PAS) and have secured funding for this 
program.  We would appreciate the assistance of PAS Kabul in 
identifying three media leaders able to travel from three 
different and respected channels.  These leaders should 
actually produce televised information programs, such as 
documentaries and/or news features.  We also seek Embassy 
Kabul,s assistance in helping these individuals obtain any 
needed documentation, including Schengen visas, for travel. 
Finally, we would welcome the participation of an LES escort 
from PAS Kabul who would be able to assist in building these 
relationships into the future. 
 
¶4.  (U) Embassy Paris will be able to subtitle at least one 
film by each participant, to be carried out in advance of the 
visit so that we can show the participants, work here in 
Paris.  The planned visit will include film showings followed 
by question and answer sessions, as well as working visits to 
French television and other media offices.  We will also 
organize interviews to highlight media freedom in Afghanistan. 
 
¶5.  (U) Embassy Paris appreciates the support of our mission 
in Kabul and we welcome your ideas and suggestions in how 
best to make this a successful project.
