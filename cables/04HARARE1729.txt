CONSERVANCY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Clive Stockil, director of Save Valley 
Conservancy (Zimbabwe's largest private wildlife 
reserve), told EconOff on October 8 that he has GOZ 
assurances of no action on the conservancy until after 
parliamentary elections and a subsequent cabinet 
reshuffle. End Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) About a month ago, Stockil organized a 
presentation for a group of investors that the GOZ wants 
to share in Save Valley ownership led by Masvingo Chief 
Fortune Charumbira to explain Save Valley's 
profitability, governance, and international linkages. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Through his presentation, Stockil attempted to 
dispel the GOZ's impression that Save Valley is a cash 
cow. He disclosed financial records indicating losses in 
recent years. He sought to refute the GOZ's belief that 
anyone could run the conservancy by detailing the 
intricate governing structure and myriad of wildlife 
issues a conservancy manager must consider. Stockil 
sought to emphasize Save Valley's international 
importance by revealing the details of loans from the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the high- 
level of international conservation interest in Save 
Valley. This, he hoped, impressed upon the GOZ that any 
adverse action against Save Valley would result in strong 
international condemnation. 
 
4 (SBU) In a separate meeting afterwards, Environment 
Minister Frances Nhema assured Stockil that the GOZ will 
take no action on Save Valley until after the March 2005 
parliamentary elections and a subsequent cabinet 
reshuffle. Stockil could then reassess his negotiating 
position once a new team was in place, Nhema said. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Stockil continues his negotiation dance 
to try to save the nature conservancy he co-owns with 
twenty-three others. As a result of Minister Nhema's 
assurances, Save Valley investors will continue to 
negotiate with the Masvingo investors, but agree to 
nothing for now. They hope a new cabinet will no longer 
support shared ownership with Charumbira's Masvingo 
investors.  Save's owners have concluded that taking a 
more confrontational approach at this time would only 
encourage GOZ hardliners to pounce. End Comment.
