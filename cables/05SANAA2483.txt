SUBJECT: YEMEN REQUESTS EXTENSION IN TIME FOR BLUE LANTERN 
END-USE CHECK ON YEMEN AIR FORCE SUPPLIERS: ASTON AVIATION, 
TRANSWORLD AVIATION, AND SEGERS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 153143 
 
¶1. Post requests an extension of 60 days to conduct the Blue 
Lantern end-use check on the Yemen Air Force Suppliers Aston 
Aviation, Transworld Aviation, and Segers. (reftel) 
 
¶2. Emboffs met with Yemen Air Force (YAF) on 22 August but 
were not able to discuss the matter with the appropriate YAF 
officials.  On 29 August, Emboffs contacted YAF Lieutenant 
Colonel Jamil Nehmi, who promised to look into the matter and 
respond to the Blue Lantern inspection request. 
 
¶3. In past Blue Lantern checks with YAF, Post made repeated 
telephone calls, sent numerous diplomatic notes, and 
requested meetings with YAF officials without receiving 
sufficient response to the Blue Lantern questions.  We 
anticipate a similar slow response time with the reftel Blue 
Lantern check request.  As such, Post requests an additional 
60 days to make the necessary efforts to perform the check.
