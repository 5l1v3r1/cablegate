Opinion Surveys on March 29 Municipal Elections 
Media outlets report predictions for this weekend's municipal 
elections from two leading polling companies, Konda and A&G, and 
note the poll conclusions diverge significantly.  The latest Konda 
poll dated March 14-15 suggests the AKP will win 47.9 percent of the 
votes nationwide for provincial assemblies, and 44.6 percent in 
mayoral races -- a 4 percent rise over the 41.7 percent votes the 
AKP won in the 2004 local elections.  The A&G Research Company, 
however, suggested the AKP's votes in Sunday's elections would drop 
to 39.1 percent.  Konda's survey estimated the AKP would win 51.8 
percent of the votes if general elections were held today.  The A&G 
survey, however, gives the AKP only 42.5 percent in a general 
election -- less than the 46.6 percent it obtained in July 2007 
general elections.  The distribution of votes in March 29 elections 
predicted by the two companies would be as follows: Konda: AKP 47.9 
percent, CHP 23.5, MHP 14.3, DTP 4.2, SP 3.7 A&G: AKP 39.8 percent, 
CHP 26.4, MHP 15.7, DTP 5.3, SP 5.2. 
 
President Gul in Brussels 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni Safak, Vatan: 
Mainstream Sabah reports that yesterday President Gul held a meeting 
with European Commission President Barroso in Brussels to discuss 
ties between Turkey and the EU, Iraq, Afghanistan and energy issues. 
 Islamist-oriented Zaman quotes Gul as saying "EU reforms will 
further strengthen Turkey's economy and democracy."  Mainstreams 
Hurriyet and Milliyet report that regarding the tax fine to Dogan 
Media Group, Barroso said that respect for freedom of the press is 
one of the fundamental values of the European Union and we attach 
great importance to it.  We understand that in Turkey there are some 
problems with this issue.  We are closely following the issue." 
 
Iraq and Denmark Push the Button to Eliminate PKK 
Mainstream Sabah reports that following the visit of President Gul 
to Iraq, the Iraqi Administration took a step forward to eliminate 
the PKK.  In a statement yesterday, Iraqi National Security Minister 
Al-Vaili said the process to expel the PKK from Iraqi territory has 
already started and Washington, Ankara and Baghdad were exchanging 
intelligence in this process.  The paper adds that Denmark also 
might take steps to outlaw the broadcasts of PKK's mouthpiece Roj 
TV.  Danish PM Rasmussen made arrangements to start legal steps 
against Roj TV.  Within this framework, a Danish prosecutor came to 
Ankara yesterday to gather information on the issue.  Sabah notes 
that the goal of the move by Denmark is to ease Turkish reactions 
and to win Turkish support for the bid of Danish PM Rasmussen to 
take the post of NATO Secretary General. 
 
International 'Kurdish Conference' to be Held in Erbil 
 Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet says in a news commentary that the 
forthcoming international "Kurdish Conference" in the northern Iraqi 
city of Erbil in late April or early May expects PKK participation. 
Kurdish sources in northern Iraq say it was not yet clear whether 
European countries will join the conference.  If the conference 
calls on the PKK to lay down its arms, Ankara wants an 
"implementation mechanism" to see the terror organization disarmed, 
says Cumhuriyet.  The paper adds the Erbil conference will be the 
first of a series of future conferences to be held on the Kurdish 
question. 
 
Editorial Commentary on the PKK-Iraq/Turkey 
 
Erdal Safak wrote in mainstream Sabah: "The upcoming Kurdish 
Conference will be held in Erbil most likely in late April or early 
May.  However all is not going smoothly regarding the conference 
preparation.  President Gul described the initiative as an 
indication that "everybody is working to resolve the issue" while FM 
Babacan emphasized Turkey does not want this platform turning into a 
propaganda venue for a terrorist organization.  As for the PKK, the 
organization was not enthusiastic about attending this conference

until imprisoned leader Ocalan gave his green light for attendance. 
 Now, the PKK has started asking for a general amnesty for PKK 
militants, including Ocalan, and want pardoned militants to become 
an armed group under Ocalan.  Given such insane demands, it is 
obvious that the problem cannot be resolved overnight." 
 
Yasin Dogan wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "There are strong 
dynamics both internally and externally to resolve the PKK problem. 
However, significant expectations, including a time frame to finish 
off the PKK, are being created by some circles as if a miracle is 
about to happen.  Extreme patience and maturity is advised because 
realism is necessary to resolve this issue." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey-EU 
 
Ali Bayramoglu wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "President 
Gul's trip to Brussels is a clear indication of the state's 
determination to return to the EU process. We can now expect to see 
steps to upgrade democratic standards after the elections." 
 
Taha Akyol wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "In Brussels, President Gul 
emphasized Turkey's policy priorities by being the first Turkish 
President ever to visit the EU capital.  Likewise, he believes that 
the Europeans have also begun to realize Turkey's importance as a 
soft power in the region.  Considering both, Turkey's EU process has 
good potential."
