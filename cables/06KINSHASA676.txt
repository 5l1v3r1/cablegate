SUBJECT: DRC ELECTIONS: BALLOTS TO BE PRINTED IN SOUTH 
AFRICA; NEW ELECTORAL CALENDAR ANTICIPATED 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) The electoral commissions of the DRC and South 
Africa signed an agreement April 27 which will provide for 
the printing of the DRC's presidential and legislative 
electoral ballots in South Africa. The GRSA will fund the 
paper for the ballots as well as the transportation of the 
finished ballots to 14 distribution sites in the DRC -- a 
contribution of approximately USD 10 million that closes a 
significant electoral funding gap. The tender for the paper 
will be sent out April 28, while it is expected the tender 
for printing will be sent early next week in a expedited 
bidding process. The actual printing phase will take two 
weeks, while distribution to the DRC will take another two to 
three weeks. CEI officials have estimated it will then 
require a further three weeks for MONUC and the CEI to 
deliver ballots to the planned 53,000 voting sites in the DRC. 
 
¶2. (SBU) CEI President Abbe Apollinaire Malu Malu told PolOff 
April 26 that he will hold a press conference April 30 in 
Kinshasa to announce the final list of approved legislative 
candidates, and that he also expected to announce a new 
electoral calendar, based upon the time needed to print and 
deliver ballots. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Though nothing is yet certain, the 
speculation is that Malu Malu will announce that the first 
round of presidential and legislative elections will take 
place no sooner than the second half of July. End comment.
