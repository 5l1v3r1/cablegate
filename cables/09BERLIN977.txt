SUBJECT: H1N1 UPDATE: 9,770 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 962, B) Berlin 937 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 infections in Germany 
rose over the week end by 557 to a total of 9,770 on August 
¶10. The majority of new infections occurred abroad.  Berlin 
authorities are taking additional precautionary measures in 
preparation for the 12th IAAF World Athletic Championship which 
begin August 15th in Berlin.   END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U)  At its August 10 press briefing, the National 
Reference 
Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
confirmed a total of 557 new (laboratory and non-laboratory) 
H1N1 cases over the week end in Germany.  This increases the 
total number of H1N1 cases to 9,770.  New cases were 
distributed among the federal states: North Rhine-Westphalia 
(218), Lower-Saxony (82), Baden-Wuerttemberg (67), Rhineland- 
Palatinate (52), Hesse (43), Thuringia (23), Bavaria (20), 
Saxony (18), Brandenburg (13), Saxony-Anhalt (9), Bremen (6), 
and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (6). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, the increase in the number of 
infections is mainly due to people returning from travel 
abroad (437 new cases).  Newly confirmed cases include 
laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 as well as non-laboratory- 
confirmed cases, mainly from people who have showed symptoms 
after being in contact with a patient who has been tested 
positive at a laboratory for the new virus.  So far, all cases 
are reportedly mild. 
 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) remains the German state 
with the highest number of virus cases among all German states 
with a total of 3,583, followed by Lower-Saxony (1749) and 
Bavaria (833 cases).  About 22 percent (2141) of all confirmed 
infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission.
