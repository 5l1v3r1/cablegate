SUBJECT: Taiwan Adopts FATF Recommendations 
 
 
¶1.  On July 11, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission Banking 
Bureau issued a regulation effective August 1 that requires all 
banking institutions to collect, verify and store information about 
any banking customer that makes any single cash or electronic 
remittance above NT$30,000 (US$923).  At present, the personal data 
requirement applies only to a remittance exceeding NT$1 million 
(US$30,769).  The data that banking institutions must verify, 
collect and store include customer name, national identification 
number, address, and telephone number. 
 
¶2.  Our contact at the Banking Bureau told AIT that the requirement 
was adopted in response to suggestions submitted to Taiwan in 2004 
by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Money Laundering.  He 
said the new requirement was intended to demonstrate Taiwan's 
determination support global efforts to crack down on international 
money laundering and terrorist finance.
