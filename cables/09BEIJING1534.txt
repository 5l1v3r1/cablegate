¶1. OBAMA'S SPEECH IN EGYPT 
 
"Obama is not the terminator of cultural conflict" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(06/08): "Obama 
intends to fix the divergences between the U.S. and the Muslim world 
through his speech. He hoped to terminate the nightmare that is 
cultural conflict.  Obama's stance toward the Muslim world is 
different from Bush's. Because culture clash is not the root 
conflict, approaching the Muslim world through cultural similarities 
will not solve the real issues that are the main obstacles between 
the countries. The main cause of the rancor between the U.S. and the 
Muslim world is the support for Israel by the U.S.  If there is no 
change in the basic stance of the U.S. on the Palestine-Israel 
conflict, the 'two-state solution' will not actually be fulfilled. 
The root cause of the Palestine-Israel, Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran 
issues is the conflict between the interests of the U.S. and Israel 
and those of the Muslim world.  Obama's 'smart power' must return to 
practical resolutions.  Being unwilling to give up any part of the 
interests of the U.S. will determine that the conflicts cannot be 
resolved." 
 
¶2. NORTH KOREA 
 
"North Korea: Don't follow others countries experiences blindly" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(06/08): "Two 
historical lessons have provided a motive for North Korea and other 
countries to pursue nuclear weapons.  The first is the U.S. and all 
other nuclear powers will not attack a country with nuclear weapons. 
 The nuclear weapons seem to mean absolute security.  Second any 
illegal nuclear possession will be taboo at first but will later 
become accepted. The most recent supporting example is the nuclear 
tests between India and Pakistan in 1998.  North Korea seems to be 
determined to follow Pakistan and India's lead in becoming a nuclear 
country.  Iran is paying close attention to the global reaction to 
North Korea's nuclear progress.   However, history is not always the 
right model to follow. Sometimes it is to the contrary. The 
experiences of other countries may not apply to the current 
situation. For example, Israel will attack any Muslim country within 
their air force's strike zone.  It is the U.S. and other western 
countries who will decide whether to revise these two historical 
lessons."
