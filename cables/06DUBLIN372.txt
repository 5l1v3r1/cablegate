SUBJECT: IRELAND UNLIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE POLICE TRAINERS TO 
THE JORDAN INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINING CENTER 
 
REF: SECSTATE 50968 
 
(U) On April 5, emboff delivered reftel points to Department 
of Foreign Affairs Middle East and North Africa Section 
Deputy Director Stephen Dawson.  Dawson stated the GOI is 
unlikely to contribute police instructors to JIPTC.  Dawson 
added that the Irish Garda would not "fit the bill" and noted 
that they lack some of the necessary skills such as firearms 
training.  The GOI considered involvement in this cause 
through the EU integrated Rule of Law Mission for Iraq 
(EUJUST LEX) but was similarly unsuccessful in finding an 
appropriate candidate.
