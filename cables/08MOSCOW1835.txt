SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON NTI PROPOSAL FOR A NUCLEAR FUEL BANK 
DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 68313 
 
Â¶1.  On June 27, we delivered reftel demarche requesting GOR 
support for the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) nuclear fuel 
bank proposal to Aleksandr Trofimov, Nuclear Affairs Officer 
in Department of Security Affairs and Disarmament, MFA. 
Trofimov asked if this was an effort to coordinate joint USG 
and GOR solicitations.  We clarified that it was simply a 
request for GOR support in soliciting contributions from 
potential donors consistent with our joint commitments to 
create reliable access to nuclear fuel.  Trofimov told us he 
would consult in the Ministry and get back to us with a 
response.
