¶1.    (SBU) PLO Chief Negotiator Sa'eb Erekat June 1 faxed to 
the ConGen a letter addressed to NEA A/S Welch criticizing 
statements by Israeli Interior Minister Roni Bar-On, 
published in the Israeli media on May 30, threatening to 
revoke the residency status of three Hamas PLC members from 
Jerusalem and the PA Minister for Jerusalem Affairs unless 
they publicly renounced their Hamas membership.  Israeli 
Police reportedly delivered a letter giving them two months 
to resign or face action from the GOI.

His Excellency Ambassador David Welch 
Assistant Secretary of State 
Washington, D.C. 
 
Dear Excellency: 
 
I am writing in response to the Israeli Government decision 
to deport from East Jerusalem members of the elected 
Legislative Council Mr. Muhammad Abu Tir, Muhammad Totah, 
Ahmad Attun, and Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Mr. Khaled Abu 
Arafah and strip them of their identity cards (residence in 
East Jerusalem). 
 
We believe that this act constitutes not only a flagrant 
violation of the Fourth Geneva Conventions, but also of the 
agreements signed between the PLO and the Government of 
Israel, namely the agreement on elections (including East 
Jerusalem) which were held in 1996 and 2006 in cooperation 
with the Israeli Government. 
 
We urge your Government's direct intervention to stop this 
Israeli illegal action, because if it is carried out it will 
be a real threat to all 300,000 Palestinians living in East 
Jerusalem. 
 
Sincerely Yours, 
 
Dr. Sa'eb Erekat 
Chief Palestinian Negotiator 
NAD-PLO
