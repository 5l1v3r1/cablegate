 ¶1.  (SBU) Embassy has received an apparently bogus email 
(text in para. 6), purporting to be from the Legal Department 
of the Bank of Sudan, originally addressed to Diebold, Inc., 
charging that ATM machines manufactured by Diebold in the 
United States have been shipped to Sudanese commercial banks 
in violation of the U.S. embargo and requesting that Diebold 
halt such deliveries.  The email was transmitted from a UK 
email address and contains numerous typographical and 
grammatical errors.  Bank of Sudan denies having transmitted 
the message.  Post is forwarding this information to 
Washington agencies because attachments suggest that Diebold 
ATMs have, in fact, been re-exported to commercial banks in 
Sudan, along with information on the re-exporting firms, and 
in case Diebold brings the message to Washington's attention. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The message alleges that ATMs exported to Egypt and 
Saudi Arabia have then been trans-shipped to Sudan via the 
Dubai Free Zone or Jeddah.  The message states that re-export 
to Sudan was done from Egypt by a firm called Raya 
Integration and from Saudi Arabia by one called Al Hamrani. 
The message asserts that &a big number8 of additional 
Diebold ATMs intended for Sudanese banks currently are under 
production. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Attached to the message are several photographs, 
showing packing labels which include the following additional 
information on re-exporting firms: 
 
Raya Integration 
25 Mossadek St. 
(no city) Egypt 
 
Motherlines Shipping LLC. 
P.O. Box 44806 Dubai, UAE 
tel 04 2868791 
 
¶4.  (U) Email and attachments have been forwarded to the 
Department:  AF/SPG and EEB/ESC/ESP. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Although the message is addressed to Diebold and 
requests that Diebold take action to stop these activities, 
Post has no evidence that the alleged re-exports have been 
going on with the firm's knowledge. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Begin text: 
 
Dear Sirs, 
 
As required by CFR #31 Part 538 (Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury) We are notifying 
you of a serious violation of many of those regulations by 
Diebold.  It has come our attention in Sudan that your 
product (Automated Teller Machine) fabricated by your company 
in Ohio are being sold and distributed in Sudan by a third 
company through Saudi Arabia (Al Hamrani) and Egypt (Raya 
Internation (sic)).  As for our information, those products 
are supplied from a third country Egypt and Saudi Arabia to 
Dubai Free zone or to Jeddah, then documents and exchanges 
and sent to by air to Sudan.  We have enough information and 
supported documents proving that those machines are supplied 
to several banks (Sudanese French bank, Al Baraka Bank, 
Faisal Bank, Farmer Bank) and recent information shows that a 
big number of machines will be supplied for some other local 
banks and are under production. 
 
We ask you to stop immediately your action in this country. 
Furthermore we will forward to the local U.S. embassy full 
details and information by post and by email about the 
persons and companies involved in this illegal action in 
addition to Diebold, Post office Box 3077, Dep. 9-8-16, North 
Canton OH  442720(sic)-8077 which will affect the image of 
the company specially that spare parts and support are not 
available ( therefore they might put it on a black list with 
the direct Manager in charge on Distributor Diebold in 
Africa, Europe, Middle East and Africa called Piet Cooreman. 
We do hope to take this email and it is contain as top 
priority and to investigate with concerned people and stop 
immediately this illegal action.

¶7.  (SBU)  Comment:  With the Sudanese businessmen we have 
talked to, sanctions are among the first topic they raise. 
We will watch to see if this poison-pen email is a trend as 
Sanctions continue to affect Sudan's economy.
