¶1. Following is Embassy Dakar's quarterly fraud reporting cable for 
the fourth quarter (July-September) of FY2006.  Responses are keyed 
to Reftel A. 
 
2.A. COUNTRY CONDITIONS: No change since last quarterly report. 
 
¶B. NON-IMMIGRANT (NIV) FRAUD: No change since last quarterly 
report. 
 
¶C. IMMIGRANT VISA (IV) FRAUD: In this quarter, Post returned 37 
petitions to USCIS for review with the recommendation that they be 
revoked. 
 
¶D. DV FRAUD: Thirty percent of the cases that the Fraud Prevention 
Unit (FPU) resolved in fiscal year 2006 were fraudulent.  Eighty 
percent of the fraudulent cases involved fake baccalaureate 
certificates.  On September 30, post had 22 pending DV2006 cases in 
the FPU that were suspended. 
 
¶E. ACS AND PASSPORT FRAUD: Post denied two American passports 
because of false claims to U.S. citizenship.  In one case, the 
applicant, age 29, was applying for his first passport and was 
unable to provide any evidence of identity other than a birth 
certificate.  The second case involved an applicant who was 
previously denied in 2005 as an imposter.  The applicant still could 
not present any evidence of his identity. 
 
¶F. ADOPTION FRAUD: During this quarter, Post requested that Embassy 
Freetown conduct 7 field investigations to confirm the orphan status 
of children adopted in Sierra Leone.  Field investigations continue 
to reveal widespread adoption fraud in Sierra Leone.  In one 
particularly disturbing case (Reftel B), the birth mother, who 
allegedly died of a miscarriage, was alive and had been attempting 
to regain custody of her son.  Post is also seeing an increase in 
K-1 female beneficiaries who claim adopted children as derivatives. 
In many cases the derivatives are much older than the K-1 
applicants. 
 
¶G.   ASYLUM AND OTHER DHS BENEFITS FRAUD: In the past, Senegalese 
immigration authorities cooperated with Post whenever passengers 
with suspicious U.S. Refugee Travel Documents (I-571) and 
Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the United States (I-512L) 
tried to board a South African Airways flight to the U.S. (Reftels C 
and D).  Unfortunately, the FPU has not received any suspicious 
documents from Senegalese immigration authorities since the consular 
section found the Deputy Director of the Special Airport Police 
Agency's three children ineligible for nonimmigrant visas on 13 
September 2006.  FPM is following up with airport authorities to 
encourage continued cooperation. 
 
¶H.   COOPERATION WITH HOST GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES: See paragraph G. 
 
¶I.   AREA OF PARTICULAR CONCERN: Significant numbers of Senegalese 
continue to migrate illegally to Spain.  According to media reports, 
parents are sending their child between 12 and 17 years on fishing 
boats to the Canary Islands because it is more difficult for Spain 
to repatriate unaccompanied minors. 
 
An Amcit told Conoff that he obtained a genuine, but falsely issued 
Senegalese entry stamp from a Senegalese immigration official at the 
airport for CFA 10,000 (USD 20).  This confirms how easy it is for 
people to obtain genuine, but falsely issued entry and exit stamps 
for Senegal. 
 
¶J.  STAFFING AND TRAINING: No changes since last quarterly report.
