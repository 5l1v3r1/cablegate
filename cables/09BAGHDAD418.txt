¶1. (U) The following is a personal message from Charge 
d'Affaires Patricia A. Butenis. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Our partnership and engagement with Iraq is about to 
hit another milestone with the release of the 2009 Country 
Commercial Guide (CCG) for Iraq.  This first post-conflict 
CCG for Iraq captures and represents the rapid evolution of 
Iraq's commercial and economic outlook from the depths of 
widespread violence to a picture of growth and 
diversification.  Serious hurdles will continue to confront 
American investors and businesspeople here, and the CCG is 
careful to highlight these, but opportunities exist and our 
companies must be well-positioned to compete in this market. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As the guide will attest, Iraq, despite the many 
real challenges it still faces, has the potential to be one 
of the world's leading mid-size markets.  Iraq is in need of 
all manner of goods and services, and the competition to 
American suppliers is not standing idly by.  Foreign business 
delegations are venturing beyond the friendly confines of the 
KRG, as Baghdad, Najaf, and Basra increase their share of the 
visitors. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In early February, President Sarkozy of France led a 
business-focused visit to Baghdad, announcing not only the 
expansion of the French diplomatic mission here, but also the 
impending visit of a delegation of French companies to Iraq. 
He was careful to point out that they would be seeking 
opportunities "not just in the areas of security and 
defense." A German business delegation led by high-level 
political officials will soon be in country, and the UK is 
planning for a large Iraq trade show in April.  This is not 
to mention aggressive manufacturers and suppliers from the 
neighborhood, currently being led by Turkey and the UAE. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The time is now for the USG to redouble its efforts 
to build links for American companies here and craft the 
underpinnings of a strong interagency advocacy effort on 
their behalf.  Opportunities for structured engagement with 
Iraqi decision makers on economic and business matters are 
growing.  We will take advantage of the working groups formed 
under our Strategic Framework Agreement to press for 
business-friendly policies and facilitate access for American 
companies, and will continue our multifaceted outreach to 
regional investment officials, legislators, and business 
groups.  The establishment of the American Business 
Council-Iraq as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce-sanctioned 
AmCham provides us with an important new partner to improve 
both the business climate overall and the opportunities for 
specific U.S. commercial projects.  DPM Barham Salih is 
pushing for a large U.S. business delegation to visit Iraq in 
the near term and the U.S. Chamber is prepared to assist 
(reftel).  We must work to facilitate these exchanges. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Building trade and investment links is critical to 
our long-term objectives in Iraq:  diversifying and growing 
the economy, and broadening the linkages between our two 
countries.  Despite the challenges, significant opportunities 
exist for American companies to prosper in Iraq.  As the new 
Administration reviews its priorities for Iraq, and as we 
continue with steps to "normalize" this mission, I strongly 
urge that we devote sufficient resources to business 
promotion, expanding our FCS presence on the ground and 
ensuring that we are able to adequately meet our goals.
