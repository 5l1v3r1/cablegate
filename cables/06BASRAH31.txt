¶1.      Summary.  On March 5, the Regional Embassy Office (REO) in 
Basrah organized a local outreach event that brought together 
religious leaders and children from all the communities in 
Basrah to celebrate religious tolerance.  The event was held at 
the largest mosque in Basrah and included the presentation of 
soccer balls and soccer paraphernalia from the Real Madrid 
Football Club of Madrid.  With local and international media 
present, all the participants agreed that such events should be 
repeated in the future to highlight how Basrah continues to be a 
melting pot of religions.  End summary. 
 
 
¶2.       The Deputy Regional Coordinator (DRC) had received a 
variety of Real Madrid soccer material from soccer great 
Zinedine Zidane who he had met while working at the U.S. Embassy 
in Madrid.  The sports material was to be donated to Iraqi 
children in Basrah.  In addition, through REO donations, soccer 
balls were purchased locally and combined with the Real Madrid 
material.  With the increase in sectarian violence after the 
bombing of the Al Askariya mosque in Samarra, the need to 
promote religious tolerance acquired a greater urgency.  As a 
result, the DRC began to meet with different religious leaders 
to gauge their interest in an event that would bring children 
together under the umbrella of sports. 
 
¶3.       The DRC met separately with the Christian leader, the 
Archbishop of Basrah, Gabriel Kassab, the Shiite cleric of the 
largest mosque in Basrah, Syed Abdul Aaly Al Moosawi and the 
highly respected Shiite leader and Basrah Provincial Council 
(BPC) member, Syed Bahaa Jama al Deen.  The latter was 
instrumental in influencing the participation of the Sunni imam, 
Sheik Khalid Al Mullah and the leader of the Sabaeans-Madaeans, 
Sheik Raad Gbashi.  With regards to the Sabaeans-Madaeans, the 
DRC was previously unaware of their importance in Basrah until 
Shiite cleric Syed Abdul Aaly Al Moosawi insisted they be 
included and offered his mosque as the site for the event. 
 
¶4.       The various religious leaders were asked to bring 
children from their respective communities between the ages of 6 
- 10 years old.  On the day of the event, 22 children (6 girls 
and 16 boys) arrived at the Al Moosawi mosque accompanied by 
parents and the religious leaders. BPC member Syed Bahaa Jama al 
Deen spoke to the crowd of about 50-60 guests and 20 media 
personnel, welcoming the opportunity to promote religious unity 
through children and sports. The Regional Coordinator (RC), Ken 
Gross, also spoke thanking the religious leaders for their 
courage in gathering together for the sake of the children of 
Basrah.  Finally, the DRC presented an autographed poster of 
Real Madrid to Captain Hussein Abdallah, the general manager of 
a local soccer club who is also the Director General of Iraqi 
Ports. 
 
¶5.      During the event, the 22 children were extremely well 
behaved, but slightly fearful.  The sight of heavily armed 
security personnel brought some of them to tears, clearly 
showing the traumatic experience of living in an a city with 
unstable security.  One of the children present had been the 
victim of a kidnapping and subsequent torturing.  However, when 
the candy, soccer balls and other Real Madrid material were 
distributed, the kids began smiling.  Their smiles grew even 
larger when they started to examine their candy and discovered 
most of it had been sent directly from the United States. 
 
 
¶6.  Comment: The above event was a resounding success from all 
angles.  The REO was able to organize an event free of political 
and religious strings during a period of not only a Provincial 
Council boycott of the British, but heightened tension and 
strife between the Shia and Sunni communities.  More 
importantly, with the help of soccer great Zinedine Zidane, the 
REO was able to bring smiles to the faces of Iraqi children who 
have had little reason recently to be happy. End Comment.
