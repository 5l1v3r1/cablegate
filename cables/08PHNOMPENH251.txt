¶1.  (SBU)  The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) 
understands the importance of UNSCR 1803, according to Tuy 
Ry, the in-coming Director of the International Organizations 
Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Ry told 
Pol/Ec Section Chief March 12 that Cambodia is actively 
enforcing restrictions on Iran related to UNSCR 1737 so that 
it is in full compliance with that earlier resolution.  Ry 
stated that the RGC was committed to take further steps and 
adopt any necessary measures to effectively implement UNSCR 
¶1803. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Tuy Ry seemed to be well-briefed on RGC 
efforts to enforce UNSCR 1737, referring to lists of dual use 
items passed to various Cambodian agencies to ensure they 
were not trans-shipped through Cambodia.  Although Ry was 
confident UNSCR 1803 would also be adhered to and 
implementation reports submitted to the Security Council, we 
would provide a cautionary note that RGC capabilities in the 
areas of export controls or border security are weak. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  BIO NOTE:  Tuy Ry comes to MFA/IO from a posting 
in Brussels where he was assigned to the EU.  Before that he 
was at the RGC mission in Geneva.  Tuy Ry has a wife and two 
children.  A daughter who resides in Los Angeles has two 
young sons.
