REF: STATE 177681 
 
¶1. Mission Brazil's AI Monitoring Group continues to meet on a 
regular basis to update and revise its tripwires and to maintain 
vigilance in preparing the Embassy for the event of a pandemic 
outbreak of AI.  Post feels, however, that it is still too soon to 
actively prepare the U.S. community in terms of an outbreak.  An 
engagement plan is laid out in the Embassy's tripwires. 
 
¶2. Per the reftel, the Monitoring Committee has determined that the 
water systems in Brasilia and all constituent Posts are adequately 
maintained by GoB municipalities and there is no indication that 
there would be an interruption of services at the time of a 
pandemic.  Moreover, additional sources of water, such as swimming 
pools, are readily available and could be sanitized and utilized in 
an emergency situation. 
 
¶3. Mission Brazil's updated tripwires will be incorporated into 
poems at the earliest possible opportunity.
