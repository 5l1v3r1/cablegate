China Seeks Mutual Trust in Six-Party Talks 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang announced at the December 
14 press briefing that, during the Six-Party Talks, 
time, patience, compromise and the building of mutual 
trust between all countries will be required.  Asked 
for details on the schedule and structure of the

begin Monday morning. 
 
No Further Information on Gao Zhisheng, Slain Tibetan 
Refugees 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3. Qin stated that the case of human rights lawyer Gao 
Zhisheng will be decided in accordance with Chinese 
law, when asked by an Associated Press reporter about 
concerns that Gao received a closed-door trial without 
legal representation.  Responding to the reporter's 
second question as to what measures had been taken to 
address the September 30 shooting of two Tibetans by 
Chinese border guards, Qin said that the victims were 
illegal border-crossers and that there was no more to 
add. 
 
Sensitivity to Criticism on China-Africa Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. Qin said he "does not understand the mentality and 
motives" of countries who continue to criticize 
China's relationship with African nations in a several 
minutes long response to a question regarding South 
African President Thabo Mbeki's remarks that China 
risks entering into a colonial relationship with 
Africa if it continues to extract natural resources 
without developing Africa's manufacturing capacity. 
Qin spoke about common experiences and suffering under 
colonialism between the people of China and Africa as 
well as of prior support for China-Africa cooperation 
from President Mbeki himself.  Times have changed and 
no force can hold back the trend of cooperation 
between China and Africa, Qin said, adding that any 
words that undermine this relationship are also not 
welcome to the African people.

--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. Responding to reports, Qin acknowledged that U.S. 
actor George Clooney visited Beijing December 10-12 to

MFA who briefed on China's policy in the region. 
China is concerned about the Darfur issue, Qin said, 
and actively provides humanitarian assistance to the 
region.  China hopes through dialogue to increase 
mutual trust and promote an early resolution of the 
issue. 
 
China Thanks Annan and Wishes Him Well

has been consistent.
