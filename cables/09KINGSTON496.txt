Two Cases of Internal Transmission 
----------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) has confirmed fourteen 
cases of influenza A (H1N1) on the island.  The first two cases were 
from two people who arrived from New York on May 19 (reftel).  In 
the first week of June, five cases were detected, all related to 
people who traveled from the United States.  Last week, the Ministry 
of Health's (MOH) confirmed several more cases, bringing the total 
number of detected and treated H1N1 cases to fourteen.  EconOff 
spoke with Dr. Sandra Knight of the MOH on June 22; she said that at 
least two of the cases were internal transitions spread from contact 
on the island, as the individuals had not traveled recently. 
 
No Deaths, Continued Monitoring 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) There have been no deaths associated with H1N1 in Jamaica. 
Testing of suspected cases is being done at the University of the 
West Indies.  The MOH have been testing 362 samples, 129 from 
suspected cases of H1N1, and continue to watch for any further 
spread of the virus.  The virus has now been detected in the 
parishes of St. Mary, St. James, Trelawny and St. Catherine. 
 
Existing Supplies 
----------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In light of the H1N1 cases, the MOH has procured more 
protective gear for its workers.  Dr. Marion Bullock DuCasse, 
Director of Emergency Disaster Management at the MOH, indicated to 
the press that the MOH is continuing to ensure that stocks are not 
depleted as healthcare workers continue to investigate persons with 
flu-like symptoms.  Dr. Knight said the Government of Mexico had 
provided the MOH with 3,500 treatments of Tamiflu and an additional 
3,500 treatments had been provided by Pan American health 
Organization. 
 
Supplies Needed and Comment 
--------------- 
 
¶4.  Dr. Knight said that the MOH currently needs additional supplies 
of N95 masks and swabs for testing suspected cases.  In the event 
that there is a larger outbreak they would need these two items as 
well as a supply of disposable gowns.  COMMENT: The Jamaican economy 
continues suffer under global economic downturn and is heavily 
reliant on tourism revenues from the tourism.  The GOJ will likely 
remain cautious about negative press related to flu outbreaks on the 
island, fearing it could hurt tourism.  END COMMENT.
