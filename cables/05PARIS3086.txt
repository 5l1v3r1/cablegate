¶1. In the absence of the MFA IO Human Rights action officer, 
currently in Geneva, poloff raised reftel points with IO 
DAS-equivalent Jean-Pierre Lacroix May 6.  Poloff stressed 
that the USG believed that the proposal was both unnecessary 
and costly and that issues of UN reform should be discussed 
in New York.  Lacroix agreed. 
 
¶2. Lacroix promised to ensure that our points were fully 
considered but noted that the GoF supported the USG position 
and opposed the establishment of the five-day working group.
