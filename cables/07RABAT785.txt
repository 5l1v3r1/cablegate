Â¶1. (SBU) Economic Counselor delivered points in reftel in 
separate meetings on April 30 with Houda Marrakchi, Head of 
the Free Trade Office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and 
Wassane Zailachi, Chief of the Ministry's North America 
division.  Both expressed pleasure with USTR's decision. 
Marrakchi, who transmitted the International Intellectual 
Property Alliance's (IIPA's) comments to concerned Moroccan 
agencies, noted that a formal response to the issues 
identified there will follow in the near future.  She agreed 
that enforcement of Morocco's IPR regulations is now key, and 
should be a focus of future technical assistance related to 
the FTA.
