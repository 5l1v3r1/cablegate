SUBJECT: AVIAN FLU UPDATE: GUANGXI TEEN BECOMES FIFTH AI FATALITY IN 
CHINA IN 2009 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Mindful of the need for transparency on pandemic 
diseases, Chinese authorities released information that an 18-year 
old in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had become 
China's fifth H5N1 avian influenza (AI) fatality of 2009.   Possible 
sources of the infection under investigation; no additional 
illnesses have been reported. Guangxi has launched an emergency AI 
action plan amidst continued monitoring and oversight from the 
national Ministry of Health.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Media reports confirm that an 18-year old, surnamed Liang, 
died from the H5N1 strand of avian influenza (AI).  The man 
reportedly first exhibited signs of the illness on January 19, while 
in Guangxi's Beilu city.  Following tests for H5N1, the Chinese 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that he 
had contracted the virus.  Liang was transferred to a local Red 
Cross hospital on January 24, where he died on January 26. 
According to staff at the Guangxi Department of Health, Emergency 
Response Office, Liang is from a village area, and may have come 
into contact with sick chickens.  The source of the infection 
remains under investigation. 
 
¶3. (U) On January 26, Guangxi authorities launched a Level II Public 
Health Incident Emergency Response Plan.  According to authorities, 
the action plan includes establishing a human AI taskforce, headed 
by the Hospital Administration of the Guangxi Department of Health, 
which will monitor those who came in close contact with Liang and 
conduct epidemiological investigations.  The action plan also 
involves strengthening the management of fever-related illnesses at 
local hospitals and clinics; there will be additional health 
publicity campaigns.  According to protocol, this case has been 
reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the 
Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. 
 
¶4. (U) As part of ongoing efforts, on January 22, the national 
Ministry of Health sent a taskforce to Guangxi to inspect SARS and 
human AI prevention and control work. Inspectors highlighted the 
following problems: a lack of self-protection among doctors treating 
ill patients, failure to investigate patients' epidemiological 
history, a lack of pre-screening techniques in hospitals, and poor 
hygiene in wet markets where poultry are slaughtered and sold.  The 
national Ministry of Health will continue to discharge monthly SARS 
and AI inspection teams to Guangxi hospitals and wildlife markets 
through March 2009.
