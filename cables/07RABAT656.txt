SUBJECT: SITUATION REPORT AS OF 1130 GMT 14 APRIL 2007: 
SUICIDE BOMBINGS NEAR USG FACILITIES IN CASABLANCA 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) At approximately 0900 GMT on Saturday April 14 two 
suicide bombers detonated the explosives they were carrying 
at two locations on Boulevard Moulay Yousef in central 
Casablanca.  One detonation occurred near a police van 
stationed diagonally across the street from the Consulate 
General.  The other occurred in front of the American 
Language Center down the street from the Consulate General. 
As of 1030, Consul-General Casablanca advised the DCM that a 
body, presumably that of the bomber, was still in the street 
in front of the ALC.  There are reports of a second fatality, 
presumably that of the other bomber.  All American personnel 
of the Consulate General are safe and accounted for and have 
been advised to remain at home.  The Consulate General is 
currently contacting all locally engaged employees.  A 
substantial police deployment has fanned out to search for 
any possible additional bombers and secure the neighborhood. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Embassy legal attache and RSO are en route to 
Casablanca and in contact with Moroccan police authorities. 
Moroccan authorities have asked the Consulate General for 
access to surveillance tapes of the street in front of the 
Consulate.  Consulate General personnel are currently working 
to access those tapes. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Local guard force personnel stationed at the ALC, 
Dar America, and the Consulate General are accounted for and 
currently inside the buildings. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ambassador has spoken by phone with General 
Idriss Charki, commander of the national police force and 
requested additional police protection for the 
Consulate-General and U.S. Embassy facilities in Rabat.  The 
DCM has activated the U.S. Embassy's phone tree to account 
for Embassy personnel. The Consular Chief, Casablanca, is 
preparing a warden message for the American Community in 
Morocco.  The American club in Rabat has been closed for the 
day as a precautionary measure. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) The DCM has conferred with the Director of the Rabat 
American School, where many students are currently engaged in 
Saturday morning little league practice and other activities. 
 ARSO, currently at the school, coordinated with local 
authorities for additional police and local guard protection 
for the school. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The DCM has convened the Embassy's Emergency Action 
Committee in Rabat with phone participation of the Consul 
General in Casablanca at 1200 noon GMT.
