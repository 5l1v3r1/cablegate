SUBJECT: SUPER TUESDAY IN SURABAYA 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  Congen Surabaya hosted a Super Tuesday 
Election event at the Consul General's residence for 35 invited 
guests from the media, local political parties, and academia. 
The Consulate's Pol/Econ Officer and Public Affairs Officer led 
a discussion of Blue State vs. Red State dynamics, focusing on 
their own home states of New York and Utah, in addition to 
giving a basic explanation of the Electoral College and the role 
of state primaries.  Guests posed questions about U.S. political 
life and the mechanics of voting in the U.S.  Invitees made 
their preference known in a mock primary election by voting for 
Barrack Obama, who spent four years of his childhood in 
Indonesia. End Summary. 
 
Red, Blue, and Purple 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U)  Following an introduction by Consul General, Surabaya's 
Pol/Econ Officer gave an outline of U.S. presidential elections 
and the Electoral College.  He introduced the 'Red State - Blue 
State' phenomenon from the 2000 and 2004 election results.  By 
using a map with election results colored in shades of red, 
blue, or purple to indicate its support for Republican or 
Democratic candidates, guests could see that supporters of both 
parties live throughout the United States.  The country is 
actually more 'purple' than the red/blue divide would indicate. 
Surabaya's Public Affairs Officer discussed the touchstone 
issues that are likely to determine whether a state is 'blue' or 
'red.'  His home state of Utah (which was red even on the 
predominately purple map) served as a useful model for 
explaining issues and demographics typical of red-state voters. 
 
Super Wednesday in Indonesia 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Election commissioners, Islamic social institution 
leaders, university and college faculty members, local and 
national media outlets, and representatives from six different 
political parties attended the event, which was actually held on 
Wednesday due to time zone differences.  Senator Barrack Obama 
received 20 of 25 votes in a mock primary election.  Guests 
agreed that Obama's higher name recognition resulted from his 
four years as a grade school student in Jakarta.  Trailing 
Obama, John McCain led a group of five other candidates who also 
garnered some support.  After the mock primary, focus shifted to 
the televisions as official results from western states were 
announced. 
 
Who's Going to Win? 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U)  Intense interest in the campaign and the electoral 
process was clear during the question and answer session. 
Guests raised questions about the importance of a candidates' 
experience to voters, the voter registration process, and race 
relations, among others.  One journalist wanted to understand 
Barrack Obama's ability to score victories in states without a 
large African American community -- like Iowa.  Their questions 
demonstrated the depth to which these participants are following 
the American political process. 
 
¶5. (U) Guests told Consulate Officers that they came away from 
the event with a greater understanding of the role of political 
parties, a better knowledge of issues Americans deem important, 
and a sense of how "open" our campaign process is despite its 
complexities.  Media coverage of the event was extensive and 
universally positive.  Most of the five papers that covered the 
event highlighted Obama's victory in the straw poll but also 
included the discussions and some of the questions and answers. 
We anticipate a continuing and growing interest in Indonesia 
about the U.S. elections and will continue to use this as an 
opportunity to encourage democratic reforms and political 
participation.
