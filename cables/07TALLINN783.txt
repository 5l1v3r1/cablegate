Â¶1. (SBU) Pol/Econoff shared reftel points with Juri Kahn, 
Division Director for Middle East Affairs at the Estonian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  On December 12, Kahn 
responded that the Government of Estonia plans to announce 
a pledge of USD 1 million in assistance to the Palestinians 
at the Paris Donor's conference.  This will be the largest 
monetary donation Estonia has ever made.  Kahn explained 
that the GOE considers the U.S. Annapolis initiative and 
its follow up, the Paris Donor's conference efforts to 
support the Middle East Peace Process, as a 'unique 
opportunity to help all sides find a solution to this long- 
term regional conflict.'  Kahn also stated that Estonian 
Foreign Minister, Urmas Paet, will represent the GOE at the 
conference.
