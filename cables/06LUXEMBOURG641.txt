SUBJECT: LUXEMBOURG'S PM ON THE NATO SUMMIT 
 
 
Classified By: DCM STEVEN H. KRAFT, FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) During an 11 December meeting the Ambassador and 
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker discussed the 
NATO Summit, the NATO Response Force (NRF), and the 
International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) in 
Afghanistan.  The Ambassador expressed her appreciation to 
the PM for Luxembourg's support for NATO and ISAF.  Juncker 
said he appreciated the Ambassador,s comments especially 
since earlier in the year he felt that he was "all alone" as 
the one European leader strongly supporting NATO.  Juncker 
also said that this is why he felt it was important for him 
to be so vocal about his support for NATO, including writing 
a pro-NATO editorial entitled "Why is NATO Good for All of 
Us?" The editorial was published on 7 December in the German 
weekly "Rheinische Merkur." 
 
¶2. (C) Juncker was clearly pleased with the Summit itself. 
He said that holding the Summit in the former Soviet Republic 
of Latvia had been "very moving."  He was also delighted to 
have had the opportunity to speak with President Bush, 
commenting that the President "is a man who speaks from 
conviction" and who "doesn't only do things when they are 
popular."  Juncker expressed some concern that the USG was 
pushing "too aggressively" on both Georgia and Ukraine's 
relationship with NATO at the risk of provoking Russia. 
Turning to NRF and ISAF Juncker reiterated Luxembourg's 
support for the NRF and underlined how important he thought 
it was for "even tiny Luxembourg" to participate in both NRF 
and ISAF with troops, not just financial support.  (NOTE: 
Luxembourg has 9 soldiers participating in ISAF and 2 
soldiers participating in NRF-7.  The GOL has also committed 
itself to the goal of being able to expand its NRF 
contribution up to 20 soldiers by the 2009/2010 timeframe - 
NRF-15/16. END NOTE.) 
 
¶3. (C/NF) COMMENT:  Perhaps it is a function of the afterglow 
of Riga or the mire which has become the debate over the 
European Constitutional treaty but Juncker's overall tone 
regarding NATO was markedly different then that of a year 
ago.  In earlier meetings with the Ambassador there were more 
references to EU-centric security matters like the Common 
Foreign and Security Policy/European Security and Defense 
Policy and the Battle group concept.  He raised none of these 
issues in the 11 December meeting.
