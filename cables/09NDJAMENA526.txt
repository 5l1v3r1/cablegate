¶1. (U) The following is an update of N'Djamena RefCoord's activities 
for the period of 02-06 NOV, 2009. 
 
------------------------------ 
EASTERN CHAD SECURITY CONCERNS 
DOMINATE MULTILATERAL MEETINGS 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU)  RefCoord attended the meeting of the Interagency Steering 
Committee (IASC) and the monthly meeting of the SRSG with the 
Diplomatic Corps, both on November 4.  The UN Chief of Security, 
Bertrand Bourgain, briefed the IASC (as reported Reftel) on his 
assessment of the security environment, especially in the area 
around Farchana and Hadjer Hadid.  Bourgain stressed that (a) in his 
opinion, this area cannot be accessed without armed escort unless 
one is prepared to take on unacceptable risks, and (b) there are 
insufficient escort assets to provide for all humanitarian 
operations in the area.  Bourgain stated that despite this lack, it 
was UNDSS policy that all UN Agencies plan all movements around the 
provision of armed escorts, either from MINURCAT troops or DIS 
officers.  He reported on the withdrawal of the NGO Premihres 
Urgences staff and assets from the region, noting that the NGO's 
leadership had determined they could not maintain operations along 
the lines of their commitment to humanitarian principles in such an 
environment, having acknowledged that armed escort was both 
unavoidable and unacceptable.  RefCoord suggested that donors should 
make explicit to partners their policies toward reduction or 
suspension of activities should partners determine this to be 
required under such security conditions.  Country Representative 
Stefano Severes reported that some 35 UNHCR-owned or -seconded 
vehicles had been stolen in the course of the year.  He acknowledged 
that issues such as attendance at UNHCR-convened meetings and the 
location of fuel access points had put partners on the road and at 
unacceptable risk, and committed to mitigate these problems.  He 
stated he would ask for partners to do their utmost to minimize 
their need for road movements to only those strictly called for by 
their professional requirements. 
 
--------------------------- 
OXFAM UK ON FUTURE 
COLLABORATION POSSIBILITIES 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) RefCoord met with Oxfam UK Country Director Pauline 
Ballaman, and newly arrived Funding Coordinator, Daphne Callies, to 
discuss possibilities for 2010 and potential PRM funding.  Oxfam UK 
has been working on water and sanitation projects in the Kounoungou 
and Mile camps.  Motorized pumps were installed in the early years 
of project, and until recently Oxfam UK has been keeping systems 
maintained and functioning.  Responding to UNHCR requests that 
systems be shifted toward hand and foot pumps, Oxfam began the 
retooling work with funding from the Canadian international 
Development Agency (CIDA).  That funding will be lost end-December. 
Since CIDA was funding these activities for both refugee and IDP 
populations, Oxfam UK must determine how best to seek new donor 
support, and is exploring OFDA backing a well.

END OF ACCRA REFCOORD'S 
N'DJAMENA TDY 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Accra RefCoord Emily Mestetsky ended her three-week TDY in 
N'Djamena by accompanying IOM Chief of Movement and Management 
Division, Michel Tonneau, to Abch November 5-6.  Accra RefCoord 
joined Tonneau for meetings with the Governor, Deputy Governor, and 
CNAR Delegate for Ouaddai region, and with the Deputy SRSG of 
MINURCAT, to discuss IOM's establishment of offices and staff 
residences, as well as a new and larger transit center.  Post thanks 
Emily for bringing to bear in N'Djamena her expertise and energy on 
resettlement and admissions issues, and congratulates her on the 
significant strides made in encouraging a more realistic IOM 
approach to operations in Chad.  We look forward to her next TDY.
