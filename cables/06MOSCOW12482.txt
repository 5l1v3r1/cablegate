¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, (A) 
JSC CHOP Vityaz-S (D359202) AND (B) JSC CHOP Vityaz-S 
(D358555), Samara, Russia. The company is listed on 
BIS license application D359202 and D358555 as the 
ultimate consignee of (A) Flir Systems Inc. model 
thermovision sentinel thermal imaging system and (B) 
flashlight camera. These items are controlled for 
national security and nuclear non-proliferation

¶3. FSN Natalya Shipitsina first contacted JSC CHOP 
Vityaz-S (Vityaz) on or about October 3, 2006.  FSN 
Shipitsina spoke with Viktor Zalozhny, who identified 
himself as the General director of JSC Vityaz-S. 
Zalozhny agreed to meet with ECO Moscow regarding the 
planned purchase.  The meeting was scheduled for 
November 8, 2006. Zalozhny provided a mobile phone 
number for any additional contacts. 
 
¶4. Open source research conducted by FSN Shipitsina 
was unable to verify the Samara address provided by 
the company.  A check with the website provided in 
reftel showed the name Vityaz-S, and noted an address 
and telephone number in Moscow.  FSN Shipitsina 
contacted the company via the Moscow telephone number, 
and was told that there was no subunit, affiliate or 
related company to Vityaz-S in Samara. 
 
¶5. On November 7, 2006 FSN Shipitsina called Zalozhny 
to confirm the meeting. Zalozhny stated that the 
company no longer plans to buy the American equipment, 
and therefore was reluctant to meet.  FSN Shipitsina 
was able to convince Zalozhny not to cancel the 
meeting.  Zalozhny said that his deputy, Mr. Aleksandr 
Khokhlov, would be responsible for the meeting. The 
meeting was confirmed for November 8 at 1500 (all 
times local), and promised to meet the team at the 
hotel and provide transportation to the offices of 
Vityaz. 
 
¶6. On November 8, 2006, an Export Control Team 
consisting of ECO Donald Pearce and FSN Shipitsina 
arrived in Samara to conduct the pre-license checks. 
FSN Shipitsina attempted to contact Kholkhlov and 
Zalozhny several times via both the mobile phone and 
office phone numbers provided with no answer. Khokhlov 
failed to show at the appointed time and location for 
the meeting. 
 
¶7. At 1515 the team hired a taxi and proceeded to 146, 
Unikh Pionerov Avenu, Samara, the address noted in 
reftel as the offices of Vityaz.  At 1600 the team 
arrived at the address, observing a ground floor 
office with a small sign bearing the name Vityaz-S in 
Russian.  The team approached the office, observing 
lights through the windows.  The team entered the 
office, which was under renovation, and without 
furnishings.  The workers in the office stated that 
the company was operating from an adjacent office. 
 
¶8. The team approached the second door, which was not 
marked and had no doorknob.  Prying the door open from 
the edge, the team made entry into a darkened, 
warehouse-like space; cluttered with a variety of 
items.  There was a second door to the left of the 
entrance, where the team observed signs of occupancy. 
Upon entering the office, the team observed a 
similarly cluttered office, with two desks, one 
computer, a television set and a large antenna of the 
type used on a rooftop.  The only appliance in the 
office that was operating was the television. The 
occupant, who identified himself as a guard, confirmed 
that this was the office of Vityaz.  The guard stated 
that he did not know the whereabouts of Kholkhlov and 
Zalozhny, and did not know when they would return. 
The team returned to the taxi, and kept the office 
 
 
under observation until 1700. The team then departed 
from the area, as there was no sign of Kholkhlov or 
Zalozhny. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post does not/not consider JSC 
CHOP Vityaz-S (D359202 and D358555), Samara, Russia to 
be a reliable recipient of U.S. origin commodities or 
technology. Post considers PLC completed unless BIS 
cables with additional questions.
