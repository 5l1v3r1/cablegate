SUBJ: Canada's Views on American IMSO DG Candidate Steven Lett 
 
Ref: State 140757 
 
¶1. Sensitive but Unclassified, do not release outside USG channels. 
¶2.  (SBU) EMIN delivered diplomatic note/demarche (reftel) on August 
28 to Santiago Reyes-Borda, who will be the GoC's Head of Delegation 
to the September 25 through 29 Assembly of the International Mobile 
Satellite Organization (IMSO).  Reyes-Borda noted Lett's "excellent" 
qualifications and noted that he had worked often with Lett in 
various multilateral fora.  He commented that Canada is "very, very 
pleased that Steven is a candidate" and added that Canada is 
"looking forward to working in IMSO with Mr. Lett's direction". 
Comment:  Reading between the lines is not difficult, and we 
conclude that Canada is very favorably disposed towards the American 
candidate.  End comment. 
¶3. (SBU) Nevertheless, at this juncture, the GoC is not yet willing 
to formally and openly endorse one candidate over another. 
Reyes-Borda indicated that Canada will likely declare its preference 
only just prior the start of the Assembly.  Reyes-Bordas told us he 
is consulting with Transport Canada, Fisheries and Oceans and 
Canadian Coast Guard; he added that Steven Lett is a familiar and 
well-regarded name among his interlocutors in those departments. 
Embassy subsequently delivered the diplomatic note/demarche in 
reftel to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
although that department is not substantively involved in IMSO 
matters. 
¶4. (SBU) Reyes-Borda told EMIN that Canada and the USA see 
eye-to-eye on most issues at IMSO, especially that the IMSO should 
be a trim and efficient organization that does not interfere with 
domestic policy.  Reyes-Borda indicated that Canada is concerned 
with the future oversight role by IMSO of "Long Range Tracking and 
Identification" (LRTI) activities, indicating that the United States 
(in particular the Coast Guard) shares Canada's concerns.  He also 
expressed Canada's views that the IMSO Advisory Committee needs to 
be strengthened and that the IMSO needs to become less of a 
"Director General driven" body, but rather must become more 
"administration-driven". 
¶5. (U) Santiago Reyes-Borda is the Senior Advisor, International 
Telecommunications Policy and Coordination at Industry Canada.  The 
other member of the Canadian delegation at the IMSO Assembly will be 
Sam Ryan, Project Manager, Navigation Systems at Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada.
