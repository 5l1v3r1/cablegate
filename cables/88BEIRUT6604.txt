IN THE NAME OF GOD THE MERCIFUL, THE COMPASSIONATE 
 
(KORANIC OPENING PHRASE) 
 
TO THE LIBERALS OF THE WORLD 
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
TO THE FAMILIES OF THE DETAINEES 
 
DAY AFTER DAY THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO 
INCREASE ITS DECEPTIONS, LIES AND COMPLETE   MISLEADING 
OF THE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE FAMILIES OF THE 
DETAINEES, IN ORDER TO REDUCE ANY ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE THE 
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TO COMMENCE PRACTICAL STEPS TO 
RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF THE DETAINEES AND TO SAFEGUARD ITS 
POSITIONS, PRIVILEGES AND SPECIAL INTERESTS.  AFTER THE 
COMMENTS OF REAGAN AND BUSH ON THE CONTENTS OF THE 
VIDEOTAPE ISSUED BY TERRY ANDERSON, WE WISH TO CLARIFY 
THE FOLLOWING: 
 
1 - THE VIDEOTAPE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT INCLUDED, WAS 
ISSUED DIRECTLY BY TERRY ANDERSON WITHOUT ANY PRESSURES 
AND AS A RESULT OF WRITTEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED MESSAGES SENT 
TO HIM THORUGH NEW AGENCIES.  THE TAPE WAS ISSUED AFTER A 
SHARP AND LARGE DEBATE BETWEEN US AND HIM CONCERNING ALL 
THE IDEAS HE PRESENTED IN IT, WHICH WE FOUND WERE GREATLY 
INCOMPLETE.  TERRY ANDERSON WILL HAVE A SUITABLE REPLY TO 
THE CLAIMS (OF THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION - ED.). 
 
2 - AMERICA ALWAYS ATTEMPTS TO "EVADE" THE CONTENTS OF 
THE TAPE AND LETTERS, WHICH REPRESENT A TRUE REALITY 
WHICH CANNOT BE DEBATED, BY RAISING DOUBTS AS TO THE 
CONTENT OF THE TAPE AND (CLAIMING - ED.) THAT IT WAS 
ISSUED BY THE KIDNAPPERS. 
 
3 - THE DETAINEES IN OUR POSSESSION ARE NOT ISOLATED FROM 
THE EXTERNAL WORLD.  THEY RECEIVE ALL THE NEWS THROUGH 
NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND TELEVISION.  THEY KNOW 
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED OR HAPPENS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR 
SITUATION, BIG OR SMALL.  WHAT REAGAN SAID IN THIS CASE 
IS LIKE THE OSTRICH WHICH HIDES ITS HEAD IN THE GROUND SO 
THE HUNTERS WILL NOT SEE IT. 
 
4 - THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION, THROUGH ITS PRESIDENT, 
HIS VICE PRESIDENT, STAFF AND ASSISTANTS, MADE ALL THE 
DEALS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUE OF DETAINEES; IF THIS WERE 
NOT SO, WHO ELSE NEGOTIATED THE CASE OF THE TWA 
AIRLINER?  HOW WERE THE FORTY PASSENGERS AND 735 
DETAINEES IN THE PRISONS OF ISRAEL RELEASED?  WHO 
NEGOTIATED THE ISSUE OF "IRAN-CONTRA?"  WHO GAVE THE 
ARMS, TOOK THE FUNDS AND TRANSFERRED SOME TO THE 
CONTRAS?  WE WERE SURPRISED THAT REAGAN RECENTLY 
ANNOUNCED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW UNTIL NOW WHO GAVE THE 
ARMS AND WHERE THE FUNDS CAME FROM IN THE "IRANGATE" 
ISSUE.  WAS IT NOT THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION?  OR ARE 
THEY ALL ON A FARM WHERE EACH CROWS ON HIS OWN?  IF THEY 
WERE AWARE, IT IS A CATASTROPHE WHICH CANNOT BE DENIED. 
IF THEY WERE UNAWARE, THE CATASTROPHE IS GREATER. 
 
5 - AS FOR CLAIMS THAT THE CEASEFIRE IN THE GULF WILL 
SPEED THE RELEASE OF THE DETAINEES WITH US, WE REITERATE 
FOR THE ONE-THOUSANDTH TIME OUR INSISTENCE THAT THE ISSUE 
OF ALL THE DETAINEES IS UNCONNECTED, IN PART OR IN WHOLE, 
NEAR OR FAR, WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE GULF.  THE 
HOPE WHICH PREVIOUSLY PREVAILED HAS GONE AND CANNOT COME 
BACK.  THE NON-RELEASE OF THE DETAINEES IS NOW DUE TO THE 
AMERICAN SANCTIMONY, FRAUD AND THE FACT THAT PROMISES AND 
GUARANTEES HAVE NOT BEEN FULFILLED. 
 
6 - THE ONLY SAFE WAY FOR THE FREEDOM AND SAFETY OF THE 
DETAINEES IS ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR JUST DEMANDS.  THIS IS 
THE PRINCIPAL FOCAL POINT OF THIS ISSUE; NOTHING ELSE.
