  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S. DEPLOMACY 
 
"Obama runs 'family politics' very well" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(01/06): "Caroline 
Kennedy has become the most capable candidate for the New York 
Senate seat left by future Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This 
news reflects the fact that the Obama administration has been 
influenced by 'family politics'. In fact, Obama's success in the 
Democratic primary was been closely credited to the Kennedys. 
Compared to other politicians who play at 'family politics' Obama is 
very effective. With one Senate seat, he has successfully restricted 
two Democratic families. Analysts have criticized Obama for 
utilizing 'family politics' and therefore, disappointing his 
grassroots supporters. However, 'family politics' are deeply 
traditional in American politics. It would be unusual for Obama to 
be able to resist them. The U.S. has the least feudal tradition 
among Western countries. What's more, the U.S. constitution doesn't 
authorize any hereditary peerage. But in recent years, 'family 
politics' and 'hereditary politics' have become the trend in 
Washington. Obama seems to be an exception of this trend, but who 
knows, he might be the beginning of the next political family." 
 
¶2. JAPAN 
 
"Japan provokes oil conflicts in the East China Sea" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/06): "Chinese experts indicate that the 
conflict over oil in the East China Sea has negatively influenced 
the China-Japan relationship. Japan should refrain from bringing 
this issue up again.  Chinese analysts indicate that the 
relationship has greatly improved in the past two years. This 
gas-oil field conflict should not cause a setback. During the U.S. 
power transition, Japan needs to maintain a good U.S.-Japan 
relationship. Thus Japan needs to have good relations with its 
neighbor countries. Japan's criticism is baseless.  It is easy to 
prove false. The current relationship between China and Japan is 
unprecedentedly complicated. The two governments should make a 
larger effort to promote their relationship, avoiding vicious 
exaggeration in reporting."
