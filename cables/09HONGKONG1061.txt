REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated May 15, 2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post-shipment verification (PSV) at Flex-In Electronics Limited, 
Flat 204-205, 2F, Laford Centre, 838 Lai Chi Kok Road, Hong Kong 
(Flex-In). The items in question for this PSV are three shipments of 
logic arrays and integrated circuits exported to Flex-In on or about 
May 24, 2008 (shipment one), November 18, 2008 (shipment 2), March 
10, 2009 (shipment 3).  These items are classified under export 
control classification number (ECCN) 3A001 and are controlled for 
national security (NS) reasons.  The exporter was Lattice 
Semiconductor of Hillsboro, Oregon. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Flex-In was 
registered in 2001 and has the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 1300 in 
paid up share capital.  Flex-In's directors are listed as Hong Kong 
residents Chong, Man Sui (HK ID C368535(5)) and Shen, Hing Steven 
(HK ID E781805(1)). 
 
¶4.  Web based research reveals that Flex-In 
(www.fe-electronics.com)is part of the Dragon Group of companies. 
The Dragon Group of companies is owned and controlled by ASTI 
Holdings Limited (www.astigp.com), a Singapore stock exchange listed 
company.  ASTI's companies include electronics distribution 
companies (including those in the Dragon Group) as well as 
semiconductor equipment manufacturing companies.  The group employs 
over 2900 employees worldwide. 
 
¶5.  On June 4, 2009, ECO and Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan 
visited the company and met with Dragon Technology Distribution (HK) 
Limited's Finance Manager, Ms. Shirley Kam.  She provided an 
overview of the corporate structure of the various ASTI and Dragon 
companies.  She further clarified that Flex-In serves primarily 
Korean customers.  Flex-In's customers are primarily manufacturers 
in the mobile telecom market and Flex-In rarely sells to other 
resellers.  Ms. Kam was familiar with Hong Kong and U.S. export 
licensing rules. 
 
¶6.  Ms. Kam was open and forthcoming and provided documentation 
confirming the final disposition of all three shipments.  Each of 
those shipments was reexported by Flex-In to Samsung Electronics for 
use in mobile phone production. 
 
¶7.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes Flex-In to be 
a suitable recipient of controlled U.S. origin technology.
