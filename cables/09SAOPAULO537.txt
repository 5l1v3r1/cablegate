SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - FX-2 BID; DRAFT BILL WAXMAN-MARKEY 
 
"Theatrical Blow?" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (9-11) says: "....The 
more we know the circumstances that led to President Lula's 
announcement to purchase the 36 fighter planes from France, the less 
his decision making process can be taken seriously....The first 
consequence of this type of move...is a loss of 
confidence.....[Lula's international advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia] 
will soon find out that there is no such a thing as unrestricted 
technology transfer...." 
 
"New risk to exports" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (9-11) by Brazilian Minister of 
Industry and Trade Miguel Jorge states: "The Waxman-Markey draft 
bill (American Clean Energy and Security Act) may have a big impact 
on Brazilian exports and therefore should get special attention from 
the Brazilian government and from the private sector....it brings 
two worrisome measures for our foreign trade: a program to grant 
subsidies to U.S. industries....and a program that imposes the 
requirement of purchasing licenses......Brazil is facing an 
estimated threat....of one third of ours exports to the U.S.....The 
Waxman-Markey draft bill may represent a significant change in the 
world's industrial production paradigm....but this praise-worthy aim 
cannot happen at the expense of developing countries' foreign trade 
and in disregard of multilateral trade rules."
