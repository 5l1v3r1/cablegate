FOR REQUEST OF FINDING OF SECTION 2225 VISA INELIGIBILITY 
 
REF: 04 MANAGUA 2136 
 
SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION 
------------------------ 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post forwards additional information to support the request 
of a finding of visa ineligibility concerning Martha Guadalupe 
Romero under Section 2225 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and 
Restructuring Act of 1998.  U.S. citizen Roberto Velez has been 
unsuccessful in reclaiming his property from Romero via the courts 
or negotiations with the Government of Nicaragua (GON).  Post 
believes that visa revocation or denial might encourage Romero to 
return the property to Mr. Velez or compel the GON to settle the 
claim with him via indemnification bonds (BPIs). 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On July 20, 2004, Post submitted reftel recommending to the 
Department that Martha Guadalupe Romero be considered ineligible for 
a non-immigrant visa under Section 2225 of the Foreign Affairs 
Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998.  Romero abused her position as 
senior advisor to Nora Astorga, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs 
during the Sandinista government, to acquire the home of U.S. 
citizen Roberto Velez.  According to Mr. Velez, Romero also worked 
as senior advisor to former Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto 
Brockman.  Romero took possession of the property in June 1982 and 
has confirmed to GON officials that she had occupied the house since 
August 22, 1982.  Between August 1992 and July 1996, Romero 
attempted to obtain a title for the property, but never paid back 
the property taxes she owed.  In 1996, the Government of Nicaragua 
(GON) made Mr. Velez an offer of $100,000 in indemnification bonds 
or BPIs (estimated market value of $23,000) to settle the claim, but 
he refused the amount because the offer was too low. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Government of Nicaragua sued Romero for non-payment of 
2,275,746 cordobas ($167,800) in property taxes by September 2001, 
and a local court ordered the foreclosure of the property and the 
house transferred back to Mr. Velez in December 2001.  In March 
2002, the GON attempted to execute the court order to return the 
property back to Mr. Velez and cancel Romero's record in the Public 
Registry, but Mr. Velez was never able to take possession of it. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) In October 2002, the Attorney General's Office filed a 
civil lawsuit against Romero seeking an eviction order, and in 
October 2003 the court ordered eviction.  In February 2004, Romero 
appealed to the Property Appeals Court, but the court delayed 
issuing a decision.  Mr. Velez was able to obtain internal court 
memos that indicated that at least three of the judges who sat on 
the court would rule against him.  On April 3, 2006, the Property 
Appeals Court ruled against Mr. Velez, nullifying the previous 
ruling that transferred the property back to Mr. Velez.  Mr. Velez 
believes the ruling was a political decision coordinated between the 
Sandinista Party and the Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC), 
known as the "Pacto."  Mr. Velez was a member of the National 
Assembly for the Conservative Party during the Somoza era, but 
claims that he was never a Somocista [Note: Post does not have any 
evidence that this unusual court decision was the result of 
Sandinista influence.  End Note.]. 
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) On January 8, 2007, Mr. Velez signed a document 
acknowledging that the Office of Assessment and Indemnification had 
offered him a settlement of BPIs for the house.  Mr. Velez informed 
the Property Office that he would accept BPIs as settlement for his 
house but that he would continue to negotiate separately for the 
property on which it was located.  On February 8, the National 
Confiscations Review Commission (CNRC) dismissed his entire claim, 
alleging that Mr. Velez had already received bonds [Note: The GON 
has provided no additional details supporting this allegation.  End 
Note.].  On February 15, Mr. Velez filed an appeal with the CNRC. 
On February 28, Econoff raised Mr. Velez's claim during the monthly 
Property Working Group meeting (septel) and GON officials promised 
to review his case. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Romero and her family still live in the house and control 
the property.  She has never applied for a non-immigrant visa.  Mr. 
Velez claims that he has spent about $50,000 in legal fees to regain 
possession of the property. 
 
POST RECOMMENDATION 
 
------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Post recommends that Romero be considered ineligible for an 
NIV under Section 2225 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and 
Restructuring Act of 1998.  Romero abused her position in the GON to 
obtain the property of a U.S. citizen for her personal benefit and 
continues to maintain control of it.  We believe that visa 
revocation or denial might encourage Romero to return the property 
to Mr. Velez, or compel the GON to settle Mr. Velez' claim via BPIs.
