¶1.  (SBU)  PolOff delivered REF A points on August 4 to 
Jeremy Lester, head of the European Commission unit for the 
Horn of Africa, Eastern Africa, and the Indian Ocean.  Lester 
agreed that the TFG is Somalia's best chance for stability 
and said, "If we were to deliver a demarche in Washington on 
this issue, we would say almost exactly the same things."  He 
noted that the European Commission has remained committed to 
provide development and humanitarian support to Somalia -- 
including South/Central, Somaliland, and Puntland -- since 
before the Djibouti Peace Process.  At present, the 
Commission, like the EU Council Secretariat and Member 
States, is considering what more it can contribute along the 
six lines of action laid out by EU High Rep Javier Solana in 
May (REF B).  The Commission, like the Member States, has not 
reached a decision on additional measures, but has a number 
of instruments at its disposal which could provide 
humanitarian assistance, governance support, support to 
police forces, and indirect support to military forces, but 
not lethal aid such as weapons and ammunition (REF C).  He 
said the Commission and Council General Secretariat would 
probably be called upon in mid-September to present new ideas 
to EU Ambassadors in the Political and Security Committee, 
after which both the Commission and Council could move 
forward towards specifics.  All parties agreed to stay in 
touch regarding future programs for Somalia, in particular 
during this time of EU deliberation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  During the meeting, Lester and staffer Giorgio 
Balzarro confirmed that the Commission would be represented 
in the UN-led, U.S.-funded Somalia security sector by 
Georges-Marc Andre, the Commission's special envoy for 
Somalia (REF D).  As the assessment develops, they said, the 
Commission may be able to send someone with expertise in a 
specific area, if necessary.  The Council General Secretariat 
has likewise been working to volunteer a participant or 
participants, and is expected soon to confirm its 
participation.
