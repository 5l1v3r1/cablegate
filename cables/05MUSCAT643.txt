----------------- 
A Tough Job Ahead 
----------------- 
 
¶1. On April 15, government-owned Arabic daily "Oman" carried an 
editorial entitled, "The Iraqi Government's Huge Task": 
 
"The soon to be announced Iraqi government has a huge mission 
before it.  It must bring security and stability to Iraq, as well 
as revive the Iraqi soul and strengthen the sense of national 
unity that has been whittled away over the last two years.  The 
National Assembly was smart to include all factions of Iraqi 
society in the process of electing the President's Council.  This 
ensured that Iraq's greater interests are protected and help to 
facilitate the rebuilding of the country.  Perhaps the desire for 
a strong and stable Iraq also led Sunnis to accept leadership 
positions in the new government even though they chose not to 
participate in the recent elections."

Release Of Palestinian Prisoners 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. On April 18, the privately-owned Arabic daily "al-Watan" 
carried an editorial entitled, "Israel's Treatment of Palestinian 
Prisoners of War Shows Bad Intentions": 
 
"After the Sharm al-Sheikh Summit, the Palestinian President 
promised his people that he would work to obtain the release of 
Palestinian POW's from Israeli prisons. However, to embarrass 
him, Sharon only released a few Jordanian prisoners... 
International human rights groups should launch a campaign to 
inform people about Israel's inhumane treatment of Palestinian 
POW's to facilitate their release.  The release of a significant 
number of prisoners would do much to convince the Palestinians 
that it is possible to reach a fair and just solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian question with Israel."

Israel Calls For A New Road Map 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. The government-owned Arabic daily "Oman" published an 
editorial on April 18 entitled, "Israel's Manipulation of the 
Road Map": 
 
"Some days ago in Cairo, the Foreign Minister of Israel called 
for the creation of a new road map between Israel and Arab 
countries that would lead to the normalization of relations. 
This means that Bush's Israeli-Palestinian road map has no value, 
especially after Bush supported Israel's demand to retain its 
settlements in the West Bank.  Israel's retention of the 
settlements prolongs the occupation and makes it impossible to 
create a viable Palestinian state."
