Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 

(C) Ambassador met with Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa on February 18 and discussed Kosovo's declaration of independence. He told the FM that the U.S. would move quickly to recognize Kosovo, and called on Bahrain to do the same. The FM replied that Bahrain would recognize Kosovo's independence, but wanted to move "collectively with the GCC." He added that he expected an announcement would come soon, possibly within the next week. (Note: King Hamad responded enthusiastically on February 13 to Ambassador's request that Bahrain act quickly in recognizing Kosovo's independence (ref B). End note.) ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
