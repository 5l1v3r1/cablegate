Emboff delivered reftel demarche to Amal Morad, Deputy 
Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs for Arab Affairs, who 
said that the GOE had not yet entered into negotiations with 
Iraq on debt forgiveness.  She was aware of the Paris Club 
terms, but said that the GOE had not decided how it would 
approach any future negotiations on debt forgiveness.  she 
also said that a London-based firm was calculating how much 
Iraq owed the GOE, several parastatal firms and Egyptian 
citizens (worker remittances).  Asked to estimate the amount, 
she offered "several hundred million."  Emboff also delivered 
the demarche to Mohamed Assaad, Advisor to the Minister of 
Finance for Public Debt.  Assaad suggested that any 
state-to-state debt held by Egypt was likely held by the 
military, in which case it would not appear in the GOE 
general budget figures.  The Ministry of Defense (MOD) 
official responsible for debt issues is currently traveling 
out of the country but will return next week.  Post will 
follow up to determine if in fact Iraq owes debt to the MOD, 
how much, and if MOD is willing to pursue debt forgiveness.
