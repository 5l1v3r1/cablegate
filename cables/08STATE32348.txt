SUBJECT: KUDOS TO EMBASSY DAKAR FOLLOWING S/E CUMBER VISIT 
 
 
¶1. Special Envoy (SE) Sada Cumber wishes to express his 
strong appreciation to all American and Locally Employed 
staff at Embassy Dakar for the extraordinary support he 
received during his March 11-14 visit to Dakar for 
the 11th OIC Summit. 
 
¶2.  Given the last minute scheduling and short duration of 
his visit, SE Cumber was very pleased and impressed by the 
number of meetings Embassy Dakar was able to arrange. 
Through active participation in this OIC Summit, the USG was 
able 
to work efficiently and highly effectively toward its 
objective of advancing mutual understanding and dialogue 
between the 
United States and Muslim communities.  In this regard, SE 
Cumber would like to thank in particular David Mosby and Jay 
Smith for their strong efforts and great guidance.  Thanks to 
them and the entire Embassy community, it was a highly 
successful visit.
