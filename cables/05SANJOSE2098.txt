Econoff, ESTH Officer, and Agricultural Attache shared 
talking points with representatives of the Ministries of 
Foreign Affairs, Health, and Agriculture.  Econoff 
corresponded with Edwin Arias, Deputy Director for Foreign 
Policy in the Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), 
who will be coordinating the dissemination of information 
within the GOCR and the GOCR response to this issue.  ESTH 
Officer also talked to Maricela Cubero, Advisor to the 
Health Minister, about this issue.  She stated that her 
Ministry will work with MFA on the response.  This issue is 
pertinent to Costa Rica because of the relatively large 
poultry industry.  The GOCR is interested in taking steps to 
ensure avian flu does not affect this industry or pose a 
threat to humans.  However, the MFA was not prepared to 
provide specific feeback at this time.  Post will follow up 
with Arias and report GOCR comments and positions.
