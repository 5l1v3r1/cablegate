¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: At its midyear meeting in Paraguay March 13-16, the 
Inter American Press Association (IAPA) criticized President Rafael 
Correa and his government's attitudes and actions toward the 
Ecuadorian media.  On March 17, Correa responded to the IAPA's 
declarations by rejecting its legitimacy to question his actions, 
saying it has no "moral authority" and should "win an election" first 
before commenting on his government.  Though Ecuadorian media 
commentators pointed out the fallacy of this response, civil society 
seemed to shrug off the President's latest dismissal of criticism 
against him as another example of one of his main governing tactics - 
to attack any criticism.  End Summary 
¶2.  (SBU) The IAPA made a number of critical points about the current 
state of freedom of the press in Ecuador in the documents it 
published during its March 13-16 midyear meeting in Paraguay.  Among 
them are these points: "The government continues to systematically 
threaten and insult the press and journalists.  On his Saturday radio 
and television program, the president constantly depicts journalism 
as causing all the country's problems."  The IAPA also stated that 
Correa, and other Latin American leaders, have taken up President 
Hugo Chavez's tactic of "actively fanning the flames of hatred 
(toward the press) through rhetoric," and that the GOE should abandon 
its threats to not place government advertising as retribution 
against media outlets that criticize it. 
 
¶3.  (C) The IAPA midyear report on Ecuador also said: "The 
government's general attitude toward the press was summarized by 
President Correa himself, who told the state-controlled Ecuadorian 
newspaper El Telegrafo on March 9, 'Very few governments have had an 
opposition as primitive and bloodthirsty as ours.  The thing is that 
it doesn't express itself through political parties...but they use 
the press.'  Meanwhile, the government has been consolidating a block 
of state-controlled media outlets.  So far the government has three 
broadcast (UHF) television channels (out of six), one VHF channel and 
one cable station (out of dozens), in addition to a national daily 
newspaper and several radio stations."  These actions are 
inconsistent with Correa's comments to former Ambassador Jewell in 
June 2008, when he complained about the lack of professionalism in 
the Ecuadorian media, but also recognized the need for a free press 
and that no one can be a neutral arbiter of what is "good or bad 
reporting."  On the other hand his attacks against some media outlet 
owners, designed to undermine the credibility of their reporting, 
have included allegations that they are tax dodgers. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In public remarks on March 17 and March 23 Correa responded 
to the IAPA's criticisms.  He said on March 17 in Guayaquil, "What 
moral authority does the IAPA have, an association of media outlet 
owners?  Who gave them any authority or moral right?  They should 
know their place.  If they want to criticize the government or 
recommend government policies, they should win an election first. 
What legitimacy do they have?"  On a visit to Paraguay on March 23 he 
added, "What often exists, and not just in Ecuador, is a corrupt, 
mediocre press that performs a political role.  Where can I go to 
complain about the press' harassment of the Ecuadorian government? 
Just as the press can say many things, the president and the 
government have the right to respond, based on (the principle of) 
free speech."  In Paraguay, he also alleged that the IAPA was founded 
by someone with links to the CIA. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Editorialists, op-ed commentators and columnists in Ecuador 
quickly reacted to President Correa's counter-attack.  One pointed 
out that according to Correa's logic, no civil society entities could 
ever protest government abuse because they never won an election. 
Another said that Correa does not think that a free press is 
essential in a democracy as a check on government power.  A third 
pointed out that regional Latin American governments are using state 
advertising campaigns to discredit the independent media in their 
countries.  More than one contrasted Paraguayan president Lujo's 
pledges, made at the IAPA meeting, not to restrict press freedom in 
his country with Correa's rejection of the IAPA's authority to 
comment on press freedom in Ecuador.  Curiously, no civil society 
groups in Ecuador spoke out publicly to defend the media or point out 
that a free press is society's best defense against a government 
trying to monopolize power. 
¶6. (SBU) There is more than a grain of truth to Correa's observation 
that the Ecuadorian media play a political role, in this case the 
role of the opposition.  Many media outlet owners come from the elite 
business class that feels threatened by Correa's reform agenda, and 
defend their own economic interests via their outlets.  In addition, 
 
Ecuador's weak political parties have left a political vacuum, which 
has been filled in part by criticism of Correa by some of the large 
Ecuadorian TV stations and newspapers. 
 
¶7. (C) COMMENT:  Correa's categorical rejection of the IAPA's 
criticism, and its right even to comment on his government, follows a 
familiar pattern of lashing out at the media and other critics and 
brooking no dissent.  It also is in line with his past criticism of 
the Ecuadorian media and betrays an intolerance for free speech and a 
free press.  His statement that only those who have won an election 
have the legitimacy to comment on his government reveals an even 
deeper rejection of the give and take of modern politics than he has 
shown in the past.
