SUBJECT: UNHCR'S SECURITY CONCERNS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: UNHCR still remains concerned that it will 
not have the capacity to cope with a refugee influx, and new 
IDP movements should violence in eastern Chad escalate after 
the end of the rainy season.  Chadian government 
representatives are absent from a number of areas where UNHCR 
operates, and these areas are extremely insecure, making 
humanitarian access difficult.  UNHCR still suspects 
recruiting in refugee camps is taking place with the 
knowledge of Chadian authorities.  END SUMMARY.

¶2.  (SBU) Economic/Consular officer traveled to Abeche on 
September 29 to meet with Claire Bourgeois, Deputy Head of 
Operations for the United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees in eastern Chad, to discuss UNHCR's current 
contingency planning efforts and operations after the 
September 19 clashes between GOC forces and Chadian rebels in 
the East.  Bourgeois stated that UNHCR was already planning 
the movement of refugee camps further west should an 
increased number of refugees enter eastern Chad with renewed 
fighting in Darfur.  The current camps would act as transit 
centers for the refugees coming in, who would then be moved 
to areas that were deemed viable camp sites (i.e., with 
adequate water supplies, being accessible, and where the 
refugees were ethnically compatible with the host 
population).  The Ouri Cassoni camp would probably move to an 
area close to the northern Chadian town of Faya.  The Am 
Nabak camp would move closer to the Chadian town of Biltine. 
At the same time, new camp sites would open closer to the 
Gaga camp. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Bourgeois admitted that, even with the movement of 
camps, and indications from refugee leaders that new refugees 
would be welcomed by the existing refugee populations, UNHCR 
was not sure if it had the absorptive capacity to offer 
sustained assistance for the projected number of 50,000 
refugees.  She added that the capabilities of the 
organization would be severely tested should renewed violence 
in eastern Chad create IDPs in the region.  Bourgeois noted 
that during a meeting with the Governors of the Ouddai and 
Wadi Fira provinces, the GOC authorities admitted that the 
Government did not know how the country would handle IDP 
movements to areas that were already burdened by refugee 
populations.  She said that UNHCR would obviously do what it 
could to assist any new IDPs, but was pessimistic about the 
organization's ability to assist all IDPs.

¶4.  (SBU) With respect to the attacks in Hadjer Marfaine that 
occured the previous week, Bourgeois said that she was not 
particularly concerned that the violence would affect the 
security of refugee camps and humanitarian workers operating 
in the camps.  The Chadian national army, according to her, 
had standing orders to ensure that refugee camps and 
humanitarian workers would be off-limits in military 
engagements.  At the same time, Chadian rebels were normally 
focused to combating the Chadian national army, and only 
targeted humanitarian activities for vehicles (although she 
admitted that vehicle thefts directly put the safety of 
humanitarian workers at risk). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The greater problem with increased insecurity was 
access to assist potential IDPs.  The towns of Guereda and 
Iriba lacked an effective GOC authority figure.  Bourgeois 
pointed out that a vehicle for the International Committee 
for the Red Cross was stolen by a group of armed unidentified 
men in military fatigues on September 27.  She also noted 
that near the southern part of the Chad-Sudan border, 
Janjaweed incursions, along with a minimal Chadian military 
presence, had forced the local population to create local 
militias, referred to as the Toroboro.  The GOC was trying to 
develop a plan to disarm the Toroboro, but, as Bourgeois 
indicated, the continued presence of armed militias would 
impact UNHCR's decision to send humanitarian workers in that 
area to assist any IDPs.

¶6.  (SBU) During a subsequent meeting, Claude Vadeboncoeur, 
Senior Refugee Security Liaison Officer, told 
Economic/Consular officer that UNHCR was still very concerned 
 
NDJAMENA 00001183  002 OF 002 
 
 
by the presence of Sudanese rebel movements loyal to the 
Justice and Equality Movement and National Redemption Front. 
While higher-level Chadian authorities had told UNHCR that 
Sudanese rebels were no longer permitted to remain in Chad as 
part of the July 26 agreement between Chad and Sudan, 
lower-level authorities (particularly in Guereda, Iriba, and 
Bahai) were permitting the free movement of Sudanese rebels. 
Vadeboncoeur said that while forced recruitment was probably 
not taking place, Sudanese rebels were reported to be 
"encouraging" refugees to join the Sudanese rebel movements 
in Darfur.  Vadeboncoeur also said that some of these rebel 
leaders were accompanied by Chadian officials, who were 
traveling with official travel documents signed by the 
Chadian Minister of Territorial Administration.
