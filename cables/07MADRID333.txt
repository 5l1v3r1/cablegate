(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to Coordinator for the 
Spanish OSCE Chairmanship Jose Angel Lopez Jorrin on February 
Â¶20.  Lopez Jorrin, rushing out the door for a week long trip 
to Vienna, Serbia, and Kosovo, replied that Spain agrees in 
large measure with the demarche points, as recently discussed 
in Washington.  He said that Spain continues to press these 
points with Romania, and encouraged the US to do so as well. 
Regarding the conference dates, Lopez Jorrin said that it 
will take place June 7-8, dates chosen to ensure that FM 
Moratinos would be able to participate.  He said that Romania 
will present these dates to the Permanent Committee.  Post 
will follow up with Lopez Jorrin when he returns from his 
trip.
