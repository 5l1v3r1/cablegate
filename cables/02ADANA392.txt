¶2.  REPAIR CONTINUES AT ADANA AIRPORT 
(Hurriyet/Bolge)  Maintenance and repair work 
continues at the Adana Airport, which was closed to 
flights on November 4.  Officials from the State 
Airports Administration (DHMI) in Adana said DHMI was 
exerting efforts to complete the renovation project 
within the stated period of time and re-open it on 
December 31.  Contracting firm, MON, which won the 
bidding tender, has begun to remove the asphalt of the 
2,750-meter runway.  The estimated cost of the project 
is TL 6.8 trillion (approx. USD 4.1 million). 
 
 
¶3.  VILLAGE RETURN PROJECT 
(Milli Gazete/Turkiye)  The Siirt Governor's Office 
reportedly placed weight on the Village Return Project 
in Siirt following the restoration of calm in the 
Southeast.  Under the project, infrastructure services 
have been completed in residential areas and 
centralized villages, with residential units 
constructed in Eruh's (Siirt) Cizmeli village opened 
to evacuees' settlement.  Governor Nuri Okutan said he 
had mobilized all resources to implement the project, 
of which 80% has been completed.  "There is quite a 
high demand for returns in our region," Okutan added. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶3.  SOUTHEAST ECONOMIC WOE 
(Evrensel)  Over the past four years, the number of 
Guroymak (Bitlis) merchants decreased by 30%, falling 
from 480 to 300, due to the economic crisis.  Nearly 
another 40 merchants are preparing to close down. 
Guroymak Merchants and Artisans Chamber President 
Fedai Erdanis said dozens of merchants had applied to 
the chamber to de-register.  "No merchants will remain 
in Guroymak at this rate," he added. 
 
 
¶4.  ADANA BUSINESSMEN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NEW GOVERNMENT 
(Bolge)  The board of directors of the Adana Chamber 
of Commerce emphasized the importance of the positive 
environment created by the one-party government 
formula that came out of the November 3 elections in 
terms of solving problems facing Adana, as well as 
Turkey.  They described the outcome as a big 
opportunity.  "People have displayed their attitudes 
toward the coalition governments by giving AKP the 
ability to form a single-party government by itself 
due to what was experienced during the last (outgoing) 
government's period.
