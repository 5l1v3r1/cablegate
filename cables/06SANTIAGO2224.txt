¶1.  On October 21, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (Sat. 
circ. 195,626) carried and editorial entitled "Similarity between 
Iraq and Vietnam."  Quote: 
 
¶2.  "President George W. Bush admitted similarities between the war 
in Iraq and Vietnam...  He specifically compared the 1968 Tet 
Offensive, where the North Vietnamese communist forces achieved an 
important tactical and psychological advantage, and Iraq, where the 
U.S. military authorities have admitted their inability to contain 
the growing wave of attacks against its forces and the Iraqi 
government....  This has political significance, because until now 
the White House had explicitly objected to any comparison between 
the two conflicts....  But other similarities are also valid. 
 
¶3.  As in Vietnam, in Iraq the United States seems to be trapped in 
a conflict it cannot control...has no strategy to withdraw or one 
that will allow it to remain and move toward clear objectives.... 
The goal of that war, contain the expansion of Communism...was at 
least easy to learn.  The current one -- to make Iraq a functional 
democracy so that it can...instill democratic values in an important 
and conflictive region -- is not only ambitious, but harder to 
assess....  Plus, the war in Iraq has been put in the context of the 
War on Terrorism...a policy that...has emotionally involved 
Americans after the 9-11 attacks. 
 
¶4.  Therefore, although the United States is in the process of 
restating its strategy in Iraq, this war could become a paradigm for 
the world power as Vietnam was in terms of shaping...the political, 
military, and strategic position of the White House, the Pentagon, 
and the Department of State.  Iraq is already determining how other 
conflicts are handled (Iran and North Korea) and will be a reference 
point for future crisis."
