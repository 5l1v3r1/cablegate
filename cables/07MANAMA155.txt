¶1. (U) NEA/ARP Office Director Alan Misenheimer and Econoff 
February 14 delivered reftel demarche concerning U.S. 
suggestions on how states can most fully implement the asset 
freeze required under UNSCR 1737 to Central Bank of Bahrain 
(CBB) Director of Financial Institution Supervision 
Abdul-Rahman Mohammed Al-Baker, Head of Compliance 
Directorate Ahmed Bumtaia and Compliance Unit Analyst Bushra 
Al-Haddad. Al-Baker said that as a UN member, Bahrain was 
committed to enforce UNSCR 1737 and would do so. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Director Misenheimer and EconOff also delivered 
reftel demarche to the Ministry of Interior Anti-Economic 
Crime Directorate's Anti-Money Laundering Unit (AMLU) 
Director Captain Bassam Al-Miraj.  (Note: The AMLU is the 
U.S. FINCEN equivalent.  It is responsible for investigating 
suspicious transactions, money laundering and terrorist 
finance cases but does not have regulatory authority.  End 
Note.)  Captain Al-Miraj said he was committed to enforcing 
UNSCR 1737 and, in fact, had already checked and re-checked 
for any Bank Sepah holdings in Bahrain and had found none. 
He assured Director Misenheimer of the Ministry's continuing 
support for bilateral cooperation on anti-money laundering 
and terror finance issues.
