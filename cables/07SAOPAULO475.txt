CHANGE; SAO PAULO 
 
 
¶1. "Preemptive Attack" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (6/1) 
editorialized: "In what seems to be a preemptive attack against the 
tough criticism the U.S. would suffer at the G8 Summit - to take 
place next week in Germany - because of his position on climate 
change, President George W. Bush launched yesterday a new proposal 
to try to stop the planet's abnormal heating.... The acceptance of 
goals by President Bush signals a turning point in his position.... 
But there is no reason for one to believe that he has really bent to 
the environmental question. His gesture seems to be rather 
pragmatic. By announcing the initiative on the eve of his departure 
to Germany, Bush not only softens pressures that he would have faced 
from his European colleagues, but also practically ensures that the 
summit will not make decisions on the climate problem. Moreover, the 
U.S. proposal also tramples ongoing negotiations in regards to the 
second stage of the Kyoto Protocol, and this tends to make advances 
on such a global discussion more difficult. In the implausible 
hypothesis that the White House's initiative will succeed, something 
that would not happen before the end of 2008, it would not be Bush, 
but his successor, that would have to face the economic burden." 
 
¶2. "The Speech Changes, But Not The Position" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo's 
science editor Claudio Angelo commented (6/1): "Who believes in 
George Walker Bush?.... Alone internationally and domestically, Bush 
has no longer succeeded in maintaining the rhetoric denying global 
climate change. But his position remains the same. The speech he 
delivered yesterday is purposively vague, contradictory and includes 
an oxymoron ('clean coal') among the solutions for the environmental 
problem. Actually, the U.S. 'proposal' limits itself to calling a 
meeting to discuss objectives (thereby reinventing the wheel, since 
both the Climate Panel and the UN Climate convention have this goal) 
and reach an agreement by 2008. But in 2008, Bush will be likely 
replaced by a Democrat president. Therefore, in addition to not 
doing anything, he is pushing the burden of the decision to his 
successor.... Bush's new plan is not only ingenuous, but also 
pernicious: by kicking the debate to 2008, he automatically cancels 
the G8's hopes of producing this month a solid multilateral 
agreement to prevent global warming.... What remains to be seen is 
whether the European Union and Japan will believe in the Texan's 
talk - which despite the sheep's clothing, continues to be as toxic 
as always."
