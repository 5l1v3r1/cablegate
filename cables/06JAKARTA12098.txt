¶1.  Embassy Jakarta's Economic Section coordinates 
monitoring of Indonesia trade agreement compliance and 
responding to foreign trade barrier complaints. 
International Trade Officer Tobias Glucksman 
(GlucksmanTH@state.gov) is the primary working level point 
of contact for these efforts.  Embassy's Foreign Agriculture 
Service (FAS) officers, with support from Animal Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS), collaborate closely with 
Econ on U.S. agricultural technical market access issues. 
Embassy's Foreign Commercial Service (FCS) also advises and 
supports Econ on additional market access concerns.  U.S. 
Customs representatives in Singapore have collaborated 
closely with Econ on anti-dumping and transshipment 
investigations in Indonesia.  USAID and DOJ-ICITAP provide 
valuable trade capacity building assistance to the 
Government of Indonesia (GOI) in support of our broad trade 
policy agenda. 
 
¶2.  Since 2005, the U.S. has enjoyed a reinvigorated trade 
dialogue whthp e Indonesia through formal and regular Trade 
and Investment Cuncil (TIC) talks, led by USTR. Through 
these reular dialogues and Embassy interventions, the 
Emassy and USG agencies have raised, and in some case 
resolved, a number of market access concerns:

APHIS and Econ, the Ministry of Agricultue announced on 22 
August that it is preparing tolift its BSE-based import 
ban, in place since Jul 2005, on boneless U.S. beef imports 
under the ae of 30 months and meat and bone meal (MBM). 
Thefirst containers of MBM are already reported to hae 
made port in Indonesia. 
 
-- Econ and Washingon agencies have leveraged one regular 
and two cosecutive out-of-cycle Special 301 reviews for 
Inonesia into a substantial increase in law enforcemnt 
activity against piraacy, significant progressin the 
implementation on new optical disk regulaions (ODR), and 
the creation of ministerial-levelnational IPR task force. 
 
-- DOJ-ICIPTAP and USAD, with support from Econ, have 
provided senior PR technical advisors to aassist the GOI in 
its OR implementation and police IPR enforcement action. 
 
-- Econ and Customs Singapore collaborated on nvestigations 
into allegations of shrimp transshpments through Indonesia. 
After finding clear evdence of transshipments, EEcon worked

credibility of GOOI uurtle excluder device certifications. 
 
-- Econ worked with USTR and U.S. Customs to investigate and 
address allegations of garment transshipments through 
Indonesia.  These efforts led to the September 2006 signing 
of an U.S.-Indonesia MOU on Textiles Transshipments.

the magnitude of GOI hikes in lubricant tariffs.

regarding the use of check prices for assessing the value 
and duty on some imported products.

requirements do not require importers to disclose sensitive 
intellectual property, such as exact percentages of 
ingredients. 
 
-- FAS continues to provide technical information to the 
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) concerning the prevalence of 
certain species of fruit flies in the U.S. in an effort to 
convince the MOA to ease new quarantine restrictions on U.S. 
fresh fruit entering Indonesia.

Embassy and Washington agencies continue to press the GOI to
