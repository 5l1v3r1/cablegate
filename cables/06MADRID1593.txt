Poloff delivered reftel points on June 19 to Enrique 
Yturriaga, MFA Subdirector General for Technical 
International Organizations, and urged Spain to help block 
any effort to prematurely adjourn the June 20-21 
International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. 
Yturriaga said that Spain strongly believed in the importance 
of the Third Protocol and would continue to work with its EU 
partners to secure its enactment.  He said he would relay 
concerns about the efforts of some countries to block 
adoption of the Third Protocol to Spanish Ambassador Manuel 
Pombo, who will direct Spain's participation on this issue at 
the Conference.
