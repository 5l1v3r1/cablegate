 (SBU) On October 19 Post Blue Lantern Action Officer 
contacted Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deputy Assistant 
Secretary-equivalent for Export Control Marc Abensour to seek 
 
SIPDIS 
clarification of laws regarding re-transfers of U.S. 
Munitions List (USML) articles to French DOM-TOM (ref A).  On 
November 21 Abensour replied to our request for a brief 
assessment of French law by fax.  The following is a 
translation of Abensour's letter. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin text: 
 
The first paragraph of the instruction of January 21, 1982 
relating to exports and imports of firearms and munitions 
between metropolitan France and its overseas departments 
states, "All transfer of arms and munitions between 
metropolitan France and its overseas departments shall be 
free.  Such transfers are not subject to the preliminary 
authorization regime governing imports and exports specified 
in Articles 11 and 13 of the April 18, 1939 Decree and the 
July 16, 1955 Decree governing the inter-ministerial 
examination of arms exports. 
 
The transfer of war and associated materials between 
metropolitan France and its overseas departments is therefore 
not subject to the October 2, 1992 special export control 
procedures regarding the import, export, and transfer of war 
materials, arms, and associated materials. 
 
French Guiana, being an overseas department of France, 
therefore has the same common rights regarding the purchase, 
possession, import, and export of munitions and associated 
materials.  The following laws are relevant: 
 
- The April 18, 1939 Decree Number 95-589, updated May 6, 
1996, which covers the manufacture and trade of war 
materials, arms, and munitions. 
 
- The May 6, 1995 update of Decree Number 95-589, which 
covers the purchase, possession, and transport of arms and 
munitions. 
 
- The January 21, 1982 instruction applies to the delivery of 
arms between France and Guiana. 
 
Regarding USML transfers from France to Guiana, such 
information can only be known after a thorough investigation. 
 This department does not have, at this stage, all the 
necessary information.  We have requested the help of the 
relevant officials at the Ministry of Defense to examine and 
collect information on these possible transfers and will 
inform you as soon as they are communicated.
