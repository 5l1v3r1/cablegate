SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON UNIVERSAL ELECTION STANDARDS DELIVERED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 71941 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Ambassador delivered reftel demarche and concept 
paper to Presidential Advisor Dr. Abdul Karim al-Iryani on 
April 19 in preparation for the Santiago Community of 
Democracies meeting.  Iryani commented that the ROYG 
delegation would fully support the idea of universal election 
standards and the creation of an experts group to develop the 
concept following the ministerial.  He also noted that he 
would study the matter more carefully before going to the 
Community of Democracies meeting in Santiago. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche and concept paper 
to Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman on April 18.  Noman 
promised to study the paper and get back to post with a 
response. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Although Iryani will not officially 
represent the ROYG at the upcoming Community of Democracies 
meeting, his statement of support, given his high rank and 
close relationship with President Saleh, most likely reflects 
ROYG support.  Iryani and DFM Noman also have a close 
relationship and can be counted on to collaborate before and 
during the ministerial.  Department interlocutors are 
encouraged to press the idea further in Santiago with both 
Iryani and Noman. End Comment.
