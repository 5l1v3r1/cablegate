SUBJECT: SUSPENSION OF TITLE III OF LIBERTAD ACT - URUGUAY 
 
REF: STATE 57782

for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Upon taking office on March 1, 2005, the 
left-of-center Frente Amplio Government immediately renewed 
diplomatic relations with Cuba, which had been previously 
suspended by the Batlle administration.  This move appeared 
to have been a gesture by President Vazquez to the more 
radical elements of his coalition, including ForMin Gargano, 
a strong proponent of expanded ties with Cuba.  Gargano and 
the more radical elements of the Frente regularly criticize 
the U.S. embargo on Cuba.  The GOU opened an Embassy in Cuba 
on June 30, 2005, and Cuba's ambassador to Uruguay was sworn 
in on November 7, 2005. 
 
¶2. (C) There have been two ministerial-level visits to Cuba, 
one in January 2006 by Social Programs Minister Arismendi 
(Communist Party) and the other in April 2006 by Health 
Minister Munoz, who accompanied a group of Uruguayan patients 
for treatment in Cuba.  Last year, the GOU accepted Cuba's 
offer to conduct ophtalmological interventions free of charge 
for Uruguayan cataract patients, under a program called 
Operacion Milagro"" (""Operation Miracle"").  About 400 
patients have been treated so far, and Minister Munoz 
recently accompanied another group of 123 patients to Cuba. 
The initiative has raised protests from the Uruguayan 
association of ophtalmologists.  The Cuban government also 
offers scholarships for Uruguayan medical students.  In 2005, 
43 Uruguayan medical students graduated in Cuba.  Post is not 
aware of any Uruguayan investments in Cuba or Cuban 
investments in Uruguay, nor of any bilateral trade agreements 
between Uruguay and Cuba. 
 
¶3. (C) All in all, the GOU's involvement with Cuba appears to 
be limited to a few areas of medical cooperation and to some 
expressions of support by the more radical elements of the 
Frente Government.  Minister Arismendi was ridiculed by large 
sections of the Frente and by the opposition when she 
suggested, upon her return from Cuba, that the GOU apply 
Cuban ""experiences"" in the area of education.  While Post is 
not aware of any declarations by the GOU criticizing the 
human rights situation in Cuba, ForMin Gargano had to 
publicly admit that Cuba is not a democracy, after he was 
criticized for suggesting that Cuba be admitted into Mercosur 
in May 2005.  Other Mercosur members and several of Gargano's 
Cabinet colleagues pointed out to Gargano that Cuba would not 
fullfill the ""democracy clause"" condition for Mercosur 
membership.
