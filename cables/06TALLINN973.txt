REF STATE 176793 
 
Â¶1. (U) On October 23 Poloff delivered reftel points to 
Kirke Kraav, MFA Director for International Organizations 
and Cooperation, on the UNGA's resolutions on the 
situation of human rights and children in Lebanon.  Kraav 
said that the GOE is following the developments in the 
Third Committee very closely but noted the GOE is not yet 
prepared to reveal how it plans to vote on this issue. 
However, Kraav assured us that as the GOE's discusses the 
issue with other EU member states, it will try to take 
into account the USG's concerns.
