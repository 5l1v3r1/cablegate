     ¶C. SECSTATE 32105 
 
¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST -- see paras. 4-5 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post welcomes the reftel request by the 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Bureau (INL) to 
send INL/CIV Senior Advisor Dave Purdy, Program Officer Sarah 
Perrine and three additional trainers to Kathmandu to assist 
the Nepal Police in preparation for their deployment to the 
UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) in May 2008. 
Embassy Kathmandu recognizes the importance of UNAMID to U.S. 
and international efforts to bring peace to Sudan.  Senior 
Law Enforcement Adviser Denver Fleming and his Deputy Jim 
Lane have begun planning for the training and have alerted 
post's medical unit that it will likely be called on to 
assist as well. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post regrets it will not be in a position to grant 
country clearance, however, until after April 15.  Nepal is 
scheduled to elect a Constituent Assembly on April 10 and the 
country is facing considerable law-and-order issues at 
present.  All TDY requests have been cancelled for April 
5-15.  Post will need to consider the security situation at 
that time before making a final decision. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In the interim, post requests a copy of the full 
training curriculum in order to ascertain the training's 
impact on post resources and to assess the ability of post 
staff to support this activity.  Specifically, post requests 
additional details regarding: 1) the number of 4x4 trucks or 
vehicles needed; 2) any GPS hand or mobile units and related 
map reading materials required; and 3) details on the 
quantities of medical support materials and supplies required. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post has verified approval from the United Nations 
Mission in Nepal and the Home Ministry for this training 
initiative. 
 
¶6. (U) Post appreciates Department's assistance.
