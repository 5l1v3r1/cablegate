¶1.  (SBU) Senegal plans to support the U.S. positions on the Bowhead 
Whale quota and the Conservation Committee, according to Mrs. Ndeye 
Ticke Ndiaye Diop, Senegal's International Whaling Commissioner and 
Director of the Maritime Fishing Division of the Ministry of 
Maritime Economy and Mr. Moustapha Thiam, Assistant Director and 
Senegal's leading specialist on the IWC and whaling issues.  EconOff 
met with these GOS officials on May 15 to present U.S. priorities 
for the International Whaling Commission's May 28-31 annual meeting 
as requested in reftel.  Thiam, who will represent Senegal in 
Anchorage, asserted that Senegal has long supported the U.S. 
approach and sees no reason to change.  He added that the U.S. 
priorities are reasonable and appear to be based on a scientific 
approach, which also guide's Senegal's IWC policy.  He also agreed 
that Japan's proposal for small-type coastal whaling should be 
presented with additional supporting research in order for the 
Commission to fully and reasonably debate that request.  Mrs. Diop 
reinforced the importance of a scientific approach, but also 
mentioned that "cultural" considerations need to be included in the 
debate.
