(SBU) During a February 23 meeting with Foreign Minister 
Morjane, the Ambassador urged Tunsian support for the 
candidacy of Anthony Lake as the next Executive Director of 
UNICEF.  Morjane, who had served for nearly two decades in 
various UN jobs, did not offer a direct comment on Lake's 
candidacy, but recalled fondly his close collaboration with 
previous UNICEF directors Carol Bellamy and James Grant.  The 
Embassy will report any subsequent substantive response we 
receive.
