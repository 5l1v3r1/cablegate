(SBU)  On May 31, Post followed up ref A discussion with 
Manfred Poiger of the Austrian Foreign Ministry's department 
responsible for ILO issues.  Poiger said the GoA had informed 
its ILO delegation of the USG position.  He said Austria 
plans to consult with the EU and will probably support the 
Governing Body candidacy of Barbados.  Poiger mentioned that 
Cuba had hurt its candidacy by recently blocking an attempt 
by EU representatives to participate in a Cuban opposition 
party meeting and by continuing to ignore the fundamental 
rights of workers.  Nevertheless, Poiger noted that the 
situation would become more complicated if the Caribbean 
sub-region agreed on Cuba as its candidate.  Poiger pointed 
out that it is unusual for ILO members to vote against a 
candidate the sub-region selects.
