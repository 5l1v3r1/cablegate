¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Contacts from UNAMID, Darfur rebel movements, and 
cival society reported wideqpread Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 
bombing in both North and South Darfur on January 24-25.  Sources 
reported that the bombing was not restricted to JEM positions in 
Muhajarriya, South Darfur, but included bombing on SLA-Unity, 
SLA/Abdul Wahid, and possibly even SLA/Minni Minnawi throughout the 
region.  Despite their limited fire power, the SAF appears 4o have 
used MIG &ighters in addition to Antonovs in at least one of the 
bombing campaigns.  One leadep from an internally displaced camp 
reported an influx of new IDPs into North Darfur camps as a result 
of the recent violence.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BOMBING IN MUHAJARRIYA 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶2. (SBU) On January 25, UNAMID reported that the GOS began a 
"bombing campaign" on January 22.  According to this reporting, GOS 
aircrafts bombed a village ten kilometers east of Muhajarriya, 
resulting i. the injury of at least three people, and the 
destruction of 60 homes.  UNAMID also reported dhat the Government's 
notorious Popular Defense Force (PDF) had moved into formerly 
SLM-MM-held Gareida the week of January 18.  41 SLM/MM subsequently 
sought refuge with UNAMID in Gereida upon arrival of the PDF, while 
JEM rebels remained stationed outside of Gereida.  This report also 
states that on January 24 UNAMID learned that four MIG fighters flew 
over Muhajarriya, received fire from JEM, and subsequently bombed 
JEM positions.  Two of these bombs hit the North IDP camp west of 
the UNAMID base, resulting in the death of one IDP child, and the 
destruction ob at least eight houses. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  UNDSS representatives based in Nyala told poloff on 
January 25 that since January 21, the GOS has intermittently bombed 
areas in South Darfur, including one populated area ij South Darfur. 
 (Contrary to the reporting above) this UN source stated that he had 
no indication as to the number of casualties from the bombardment. 
This contact stated that UNDSS had previously planned an assessment 
mission for January 26, but determined in a meeting that the area 
remain3 a "no-go zone" for international humanitarian workers, and 
UNAMID has yet to conduct a reconnaissance mission to the area. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Another UNDSS source stated that last week%s lull in 
fighting between SLM/MM and JEM was the result of negotiations 
between Minnawi and JEM. According to this source, the GOS attempted 
to disrupt this reconciliation effort by boibing Muhajarriya "as the 
Goverment of Sudan is not comfortable with SLM/MM and JEM becoming 
friends," preferring that current and former rebel groups fight each 
other.  This same contact also stated that he had received one 
beport that the Sudanese Armed Forces had entered some areas 
occupied by SLM/MM forcs and begun disarming Minnawi's fobces. 
This contac speculated, "If this is true, this disarmament of 
Minnawi's fores suppords the theory of a growing GOS concern that 
Minnawi may join with the Krebel] opposition again and perhaps even 
drop the DPA ltogether." 
 
¶5. (SBU) RLM/MM Member of Parliaent, Ali Traio, told poloff on 
January 25 that he had "no information" regarding violence in 
Darfur.  When hearing reports of alleged SAF disarmament of SLM/MM 
fighters or inadvertent GOQ attacks on SLM/MM positions as reportedQin Sudan Dribune, Traio lashed out, "You people in the United Stateq 
want 4o know about every little detail of a chaotic situation that 
you created."  Traio is one of many in the SLM/LM movement who 
believe that JEM was emboldened by its visit to Washington, 
resulting in JEM feeling confident enough to attack SLM/MM 
positions.  CDA Fernandez urged Minnawi on January 22 and 25 by 
satphone from Darfur, "not to be manipulated by the GOS" in his 
eagerness to get back at JEM. He noted that "nothing makes Khartoum 
happier than to see Zaghawa fighting Zaghawa." Minnawi noted that he 
has nothing against (JEM leader) Khalil Ibrahim, "but we want to see 
a return to the status quo ante January 15." 
 
BOMBING REPORTED ELSEWHERE IN NORTH & SOUTH DARFUR

¶6.  (SBU)  On January 24, SLM/Unity Leader Abdallah Yehia told 
poloff via satellite phone that Government Antonov airplanes bombed 
SLM/UniTy's posithons east of Muhajarriya in Abu Sauna and Abu 
Rufyan (11053' 26024).  Yehia stated that he had seen the 
destruction of Abu Sauna "with his own eyes" and asked for U.S. 
intervention "to stop the GoS from its indiscriminate air campaign." 
 On January 25, a UNDSS source confirmed that this area had been 
bombed, but said that SLA/AW, and not SLA/Unity was the targetof 
this attack. (Note:  We have heard reports of increased coordination 
between SLA/AW and SLA/Unity.  On January 25, Center for 
Humanitarian Dialogue's Theo Murphy told CDA Fernandez that some 
 
KHARTOUM 00000092  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
senior SLA/Unity commanders have been working closely with SLA/AW 
and several may be ready to defect to Abdul Wahid's movement. 
Septel will follow.  End Note.)  Contrary to these reports of 
bombing outside of Muhajarriya, another UNDSS source based in Nyala 
said that he had not received confirmation of bombings near 
Haskanita, and cautioned that accurate information was exceedingly 
difficult to obtain in Darfur. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Also on January 25, prominent SLA/AW Commander Muhammad 
Gadura told emboff that in addition to Muhajarriya, the Sudanese 
Armed Forces bombed areas of North Darfur including Ain Siero, Bir 
Mazza, and Al Hashaba on January 24. Ahmed Atim Uthman, a community 
leader in Al Salam IDP camp in El-Fasher, also reported that the 
violence of the last two weeks has resulted in an influx of new IDPs 
to the camps over the last few days. Uthman reported that two 
hundred families traveling from both North and South Darfur arrived 
in Al-Salaam IDP camp on January 24. 
 
PRESS REPORTS 
- - - - - - - 
¶8. (SBU)  Local and international press reported that the Sudanese 
Armed Forces readily admitted to attacking JEM positions in South 
Darfur.  On January 25, the pro-government "Akhir Lahza" also 
reported that Minnawi had not reconciled with JEM and that "it is 
only a matter of time before SLM/MM recaptures Muhajarriya."  The 
article further states that SLM/MM "absolutely rejects" any form of 
mediation with JEM.  "Al-Rai Al-Aam" reprinted portions of a Reuters 
article which quotes a SAF Spokesman acknowledging the SAF attack on 
Muhajarriya.  The article also emphasizes that SLM/MM and JEM have 
not reconciled, and quotes JEM Political Secretary Ahmed Tugud as 
boasting of JEM's military capability in the face of the GOS attack. 
 As if boasting its military capacity and media profile, JEM's 
website also translated the Reuters and AFP stories into Arabic, 
highlighting the GOS bombing, its civilian death toll, and the 
proximity of the bombing to UNAMID bases. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
¶9.  (SBU)  It appears as though the GOS has used the pretext of 
targeting JEM for waging a broader campaign not just on JEM but also 
on other rebel movements.  While the international press has fixated 
on Muhajarriya, there are other areas that may be as affected as 
this area in South Darfur.  With Minnawi's return to Darfur, it 
appears as though SLM/MM representatives in Khartoum are not well 
informed about exactly what is happening to their movement.  This is 
also the second time in a week that we have received incongruent 
information from sources within UNAMID, highlighting, once again, 
the need for better information gathering and sharing within the 
hybrid force.  Post will continue to follow the trail of violence in 
Darfur, particularly in Muhajarriya, Abu Sauna, Abu Sufyan, and 
Hashaba, as JEM attempts to increase its profile and strength in 
Darfur and the SAF responds with a coordinated bombing campaign. 
This latest episode of violence highlights once again the complex 
nature of the conflict in Darfur, with rebels fighting each other 
and then reconciling, and the government playing the rebels off each 
other to its own advantage.  The bombing campaign will likely 
continue, as the government intends to blunt JEM's recent offensive 
and cannot afford to allow JEM to build significant strength deep in 
South Darfur so close to the border with Kordofan - within striking 
distance of oil installations and urban areas in the Nile valley.
