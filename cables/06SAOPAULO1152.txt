"Iraq And The US Elections" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
(10/26) editorialized: "In view of the prospect that the Republicans 
may lose the majority in the House or in the Senate, or in both, in 
the upcoming midterm elections, President George W. Bush spoke once 
against yesterday about Iraq - one of the topics responsible for his 
party's low popularity. He spoke, but didn't say much because he 
couldn't. Speaking impartially about the Iraqi question would mean 
to admit failure, something that Bush is not willing to do. The 
truth is almost simple: the US made a mistake when it invaded Iraq 
and has not been able to prevent that nation from getting involved 
in a civil war that is expected to last for years to come. And 
worse, if the US troops leave Iraq now, as part of public opinion is 
beginning to demand, the crisis might be aggravated and spread to 
other Middle East nations.... The outcome of the US military 
adventure in Iraq is still unknown. The chances of an implosion and 
fragmentation of Iraq into smaller states are great. If there is one 
certainty, it is that if a split really occurs it will cause further 
tensions in the already disturbed Middle East. But this is a subject 
that neither Bush nor the Democrats want to debate openly."
