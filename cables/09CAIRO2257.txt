REF: STATE 99501 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Pol Off met with 
registered broker El Sayed Safwat Saleh at the offices of the 
Arab Trading International Company.  The firm's General 
Manager, Osama Fathy, was also present.  Saleh confirmed that 
he was authorized by the Egyptian Ministry of Defense to 
conduct brokering activities in Egypt.  The Arab Trading 
International Company provides consulting services only for 
sensitive items, so the firm does not physically handle or 
store any items on the United States Munitions List on behalf 
of its clients.  The company was established 12 years ago. 
In addition to Saleh and Fathy, the only additional partner 
is Sahar Shaheen.  Besides the partners, the firm employs six 
other people. The firm's only customers are located in Egypt 
and are predominantly military organizations or petroleum 
companies.  Both Saleh and Fathy are retired military 
officers. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Saleh explained that the firm focuses on three main 
areas:  1) consulting services for military factories, 2) 
spare parts for oil servicing companies, and 3) spare parts 
for factories.  Saleh said he was asked to register as a 
broker by L3, who Arab Trading International Company is 
consulting for on a proposed overall of M60A3 tank engines 
that would be financed through the Foreign Military Financing 
program.
