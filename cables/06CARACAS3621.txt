SUBJECT: POST-ELECTION SCENESETTER FOR CODEL DELAHUNT/MEEKS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Representatives Delahunt and Meeks are already very 
familiar with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (BRV). 
They will be the first congressional visitors to come to 
Caracas since their April 23-24 visit, and this visit comes 
on the heels of President Chavez's re-election on December 3. 
 President Chavez won approximately 63 percent of the vote, 
while opposition challenger and Zulia Governor Manuel Rosales 
polled 37 percent.  Despite a highly polarized political 
environment, the December 3 election took place without major 
incidents of violence. 
 
¶2. (SBU) After his electoral victory, President Chavez 
underscored his intention to "deepen" the "Bolivarian 
revolution" and to launch "Socialism in the 21st Century," 
but he has not yet defined these political projects in any 
detail.  Chavez said he will form a commission to propose 
amendments to the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution, one of which 
almost certainly will allow Chavez to run for president again 
in six years.  He and his supporters are also discussing 
holding a party conference in the first four months of 2007 
to try to merge all the pro-government parties into a "single 
revolutionary party." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rosales conceded defeat on election night in 
statesmanlike fashion.  Despite losing by a wide margin, 
Rosales remains Venezuela's pre-eminent opposition leader. 
His campaign received high praise from all elements of the 
opposition, international observers, and even some Chavez 
supporters.  Since his defeat, Rosales has returned to his 
Zulia Governorship, but he has also signaled his intention to 
continue to lead a united opposition.  Rosales has named his 
own commission to propose changes to the Constitution.  He 
and his followers are also planning to make their Zulia-based 
Un Nuevo Tiempo (UNT) a national party. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The United States government commmended the 
Venezuelan people for turning out in large numbers to 
exercise their right to vote and Governor Rosales for 
conducting an exemplary campaign in a difficult environment. 
In addition, we have expressed our interest in working with 
the Venezuelan government on issues of mutual interest.  A/S 
Shannon and Ambassador Brownfield have publicly and privately 
reinforced that interest in recent days.  Representatives 
Delahunt and Meeks will have a timely opportunity to test the 
BRV's willingness to engage on a practical, cooperative 
agenda.
