Classified By: DCM Lisa Kubiske. Reason: 1.5 (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Following up on reports that Brazil submitted on 
opinion to the ICJ on Serbia's request that Kosovo's 
declaration of independence be regarded as illegal, poloff 
contacted Elizabeth-Sophie Mazzella, Director for Eastern 
Europe at the Ministry for External Relations (MRE). 
Mazzella explained Brazil's position as supporting UNSCR 1244 
and the process it established.  Mazzella said specifically 
that Brazil did not support Serbian claims of illegality, but 
was concerned that the UN resolution be respected.  Although 
poloff noted that UN representative Ahtisaari and many 
governments had recognized Kosovo independence as being 
consistent with 1244, Mazzella said Brazil was not yet ready 
to make such a determination and would not until there was a 
"UN decision," i.e. a Security Council Resolution. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Mazzella also commented that Serbian Foreign 
Minister Jeremic had impressed his Brazilian counterparts 
favorably during his recent visit to Rio de Janeiro.  Jeremic 
had, she said, been eloquent in stating Serbia's case and had 
impressed the Brazilians with his commitment to a European 
future.  She noted that the slower pace of EU integration for 
Serbia would negatively impact not only Serbia's development 
but further recognition of Kosovo independence.
