AND EXTENDED CONSULTATIONS 

REF: LIMA 3572 

Sensitive but Unclassified. Please handle accordingly. 

¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph 5. 

¶2. (SBU) Summary:  President Garcia has called for judicial 
reform and highlighted extradition as a national priority, 
but the judiciary's interpretation of our bilateral 
extradition treaty has obstructed U.S. extradition requests. 
To seize on the government's stated interest and overcome 
obstacles, post requests DOJ and other support for an 
extradition workshop targeting Peruvian judges and government 
officials.  Senior DOJ attorney John Beasley's recent visit 
to Peru shed light on the way forward.  End Summary. 

¶3. (SBU) The U.S.-Peru bilateral extradition treaty went into 
effect August 2003.  There are eight pending U.S. extradition 
requests with the GOP.  In the last three years, only one 
subject was extradited and surrendered to th U.S., in part 
because he wanted to be.  The main obstacles to successful 
extraditions are the Peruvian judges' inexperience in 
extraditions and their inadequate understanding of the 
extradition treaty, as well as its requirements and 
processes.  In one recent example, the Peruvian Supreme Court 
requested that the Embassy provide evidence far beyond what 
the treaty calls for. 

¶4. (U) In a letter to President Bush (Reftel), President 
Garcia stated his interest in expediting extraditions of 
narcotraffickers.  More generally, Garcia has also emphasized 
judicial reform and improving the capabilities of judges and 
the efficiency of the judicial system.  Everyone from the 
Ministers down to staff in the Ministry of Justice and the 
Public Ministry have emphasized the need to educate judges on 
the extradition treaty, the required standards of proof, and 
the extradition process.  In a 10/13 meeting with DOJ 
representative John Beasley, the Minister of Justice, Maria 
Zavala acknowledged she herself could benefit from such a 
workshop on extradition issues. 

¶5. (SBU) Action Request: With the glaring need and the clear 
interest in mind, Post requests assistance from DOJ, ONDCP, 
and other relevant stakeholders in funding, organizing, and 
administering an extradition workshop and/or extended 
consultations on extradition law and the extradition process 
with special emphasis on the U.S.-Peru treaty.  These 
workshops would primarily target judges who hear U.S. 
extradition requests.  They would also aim to educate 
Peruvian government officials who work on extraditions 
particularly in the Public, Justice, and Foreign Ministries. 
The objectives of the workshop and/or consultations would be 
to: 1) educate the judges on extradition requirements and 
procedures, and 2) foster a culture of responsibility and 
cooperation with regard to compliance with the extradition 
treaty. 

¶6. (U) Post wishes to thank DOJ for the productive visit by 
Office of International Affairs Senior Trial Attorney, John 
Beasley, to assist in advancing issues related to U.S. 
extradition requests to Peru.  Beasley met with senior 
representatives in the Justice Ministry, the Public Ministry, 
the Foreign Ministry, and judges from the relevant courts. 
His visit helped bring to light the substantive issues, 
demonstrated the importance of the extradition process to the 
USG and GOP, and delineated some of the challenges the USG 
faces in its requests.
