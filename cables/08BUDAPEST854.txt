(SBU) Ref talking points were delivered on August 28 to Mark 
Horvath, Head of Section for Arms Control and 
Non-Proliferation, GoH Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Horvath 
was intimately familiar with various UNSC resolutions on this 
issue and the NSG in general, having recently returned from a 
four year tour at the Hungarian Mission to the UN in New 
York.  He stated that Hungary is always cautious regarding 
contact with the Iranian government or related entities and 
continues to support strong non-proliferation efforts towards 
Tehran.  Horvath did not believe any private Hungarian 
companies dealt with nuclear fuel issues, only energy related 
technologies.  He plans to circulate Ref talking points to 
other relevant departments in the MFA and will advise PolOff 
if any further comments surface.
