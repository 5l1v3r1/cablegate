SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KAGAME'S MEDIA COMMENTS ON KENYA 
 
 
¶1. (U) Recent comments made by Rwandan President Paul Kagame 
about the use of military force to resolve the situation in 
Kenya have resulted in a series of articles in local and 
international media, both critical and supportive of his 
views.  In one interview, Kagame expressed a desire to see 
more action taken by stable Kenyan institutions, in the 
interest of preventing further violence, while at the same 
time supporting UN efforts to mediate the conflict.  In 
another, Kagame more explicitly suggested military 
intervention in the Kenyan crisis.  Kagame subsequently 
sought to clarify and expand upon his viewpoint, saying he 
supported ongoing dialogues but hoped that action would be 
taken if conditions on the ground in Kenya continued to 
deteriorate.  Finally he offered three possible non-military 
solutions to the crisis - another presidential election, a 
re-count of the first election, or a power-sharing agreement 
to stabilize the country. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Kagame supports the UN-led peace process 
and existing structures in Kenya.  However, he also speaks as 
a former military leader, who watched as a discredited 
government engaged in wholesale slaughter in Rwanda's 1994 
genocide while the international community engaged in 
"dialogue" and self-serving indecision.  We in the U.S. call 
out the national guard when domestic civil disorder descends 
into mayhem and bloody conflict (as in a number of our 
twentieth century urban riots).  His comments on the need for 
intervention if the violence does not stop in Kenya should be 
seen in that light.  End comment.
