Title- The Iranian Enigma 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (2-9) says: "A 'dtente' 
between the White House and the Ayatollah-lead regime, which 
accumulates more than 30 years of rupture and hostility, will be an 
event capable to disarming spirits throughout the so called greater 
Middle East....The easing of tensions between Iran and U.S. will 
also help to consolidate a political transition in Iraq, to a Shiite 
majority like Iran.  The normalization of the relationship between 
Washington and Teheran depends above all on how the two parties 
tackle the Iranian nuclear program theme....but the realization of 
an ambitious re-approximation agenda with Iran will have to wait 
until June, when there will be presidential election in the Persian 
country." 
 
Title- The Serpent's Egg 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (2-9) by Senator Aloisio 
Mercadante (PT) states: "What surprises the most is not the strength 
and rapidity [of the crisis], but the lack of action from 
authorities during its elaboration. .....While the U.S. economy was 
growing and people made a lot of money, many looked the other way 
from this monumental financial egg that freed the serpent of the 
crisis that devastated the world when it broke.  Nevertheless, there 
is another serpent egg in sight. It is about protectionism....The 
only way of facing the current crisis is through swift international 
cooperation and measures that go beyond old paradigms.  And the best 
way to avoid new disasters is to build a new global order, more 
regulated, symmetric and firm placed in multilateralism." 
 
Title- America for Americans? 
 
Op-Ed in O Estado de S. Paulo (2-9) by FGV professor Eliana Cardoso 
states: "What would be the implications of a change in the global 
power for South America in the long run?  It is possible to think of 
three scenarios.  The first is: more of the same.  Neglected by the 
three major powers (U.S., China and European Union) the continent 
would remain forgotten as a U.S. backyard. The tradition is so long 
that seems unchangeable.....There are signs that [President] Barack 
Obama wants to resuscitate economic nationalism.  Even if 
globalization ends up suffering from that, the second scenario is a 
variation of the first, in which the difference would be the 
replacement of the U.S. power by the Chinese....The third scenario, 
more optimistic, depends on the economic integration of South 
American countries.  United, the continent would have more strength. 
 But.....South American Integration is far from being what one might 
wish."
