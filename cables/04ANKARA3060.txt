PolMilOff faxed May 14 the proposed dip note containing 
Washington's approved CFE Host Country Agreement text to MFA 
Disarmament Head of Department Bulent Meric.  On June 3 Meric 
said the Turkish interagency was reviewing the text, and he 
hoped to get back to the Embassy in the next couple of weeks. 
 PolMilOff reminded Meric that the latest version was the 
Turkish proposal and expressed hope that a comparison of the 
texts would not take much longer.  Meric concurred but 
wondered aloud if the agreement would require Parliamentary 
approval once the Embassy sent the official dip note; he said 
he would have to check into it.
