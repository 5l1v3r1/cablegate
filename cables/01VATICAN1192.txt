POPE CALLS WORLD'S CARDINALS TO ROME 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS ORDERED ALL THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S 
CARDINALS TO ROME IN MAY TO DISCUSS POLICY ISSUES. CALLED AN 
EXTRAORDINARY CONSISTORY, THE MAY 21-24 MEETING WILL ANALYZE 
THE WAY THE POPE EXERCISES HIS AUTHORITY AND HOW THE WORLD'S 
BISHOPS SHARE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. 
VATICAN WATCHERS SUGGEST THE MEETING MIGHT ALSO ADDRESS THE 
STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND OTHER 
CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN THE HOPE OF RE-ESTABLISHING FULL 
UNITY. POPE JOHN PAUL HAS REGULARLY INSISTED ON THE PRIORITY 
OF CHRISTIAN UNITY. AN EVENTUAL "RE-PHRASING" BY THE WORLD'S 
CARDINALS OF HOW PAPAL AUTHORITY IS EXERCISED MAY MAKE IT 
LESS OF A PROBLEM FOR OTHER CHRISTIAN CHURCHES, ESPECIALLY 
THE ORTHODOX, TO ACCEPT.

¶3.   A VATICAN DELEGATION MET IN CAIRO, EGYPT FEBRUARY 24 
WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ISLAM BASED AT AL-ALZHAR UNIVERSITY. 
THE VATICAN'S INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE SPECIALIST, BISHOP 
MICHAEL FITZGERALD, SAID THE MEETING FOCUSED IN PART ON "THE 
DETERIORATING SITUATION ON THE MIDDLE EAST." A STATEMENT 
RELEASED BY THE VATICAN SAID MOSLEM REPRESENTATIVES JOINED 
ITS OWN DELEGATION IN CALLING FOR AN END TO THE ISRAELI- 
PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY IN "UNJUSTLY OCCUPIED" 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. THE JOINT STATEMENT AFFIRMED THE 
SPECIAL CHARACTER OF JERUSALEM AS SACRED TO ALL THREE 
MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS, AND CONDEMNED BREACHES OF THE 
PRINCIPLE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, PARTICULARLY THE BLOCKING OF 
ACCESS TO THE HOLY PLACES.

PAPAL APPEAL FOR AFGHANISTAN 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.   POPE JOHN PAUL II APPEALED TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY ON BEHALF OF DROUGHT AND CIVIL WAR VICTIMS IN 
AFGHANISTAN. AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS FEBRUARY 28 GENERAL 
AUDIENCE IN VATICAN CITY, THE POPE DECLARED THAT "A GRAVE 
HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY IS OCCURRING IN AFGHANISTAN." HE SAID 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, THE SICK AND THE 
ELDERLY, WERE DYING OF HUNGER AND COLD. THE POPE EXPRESSED 
HIS APPRECIATION FOR THE EFFORTS OF HUMANITARIAN 
ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN THE REGION. HE APPEALED TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "NOT TO FORGET THIS TRAGIC 
SITUATION," AND URGED ALL PARTIES IN "A WAR WHICH HAS BEEN 
TOO LONG AND BLOODY" TO ARRANGE AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE TO 
ALLOW AID TO REACH PEOPLE MOST AT RISK.

IRAQI PATRIARCH DECLARES SADDAM CAPABLE OF RETALIATION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5.   PATRIARCH RAPHAEL BIDAWID OF BAGHDAD DECLARED THAT 
RENEWED BOMBINGS OF MILITARY TARGETS BY US AND BRITISH 
AIRCRAFT COULD PUSH SADDAM HUSSEIN "TO RETALIATE OUT OF 
DESPERATION." IN AN FEBRUARY 25 INTERVIEW WITH VATICAN NEWS 
AGENCY "FIDES," BIDAWID OPINED THAT "THE WHOLE OF THE ARAB 
WORLD IS NOW AGAINST THE AMERICANS AND THE BRITISH, AND 
READY TO COMMIT VIOLENCE AGAINST THE USA AND BRITAIN IN 
THEIR OWN COUNTRIES." THE PATRIARCH SAID THAT THE MORE 
SADDAM HUSSEIN IS "MALTREATED", THE GREATER THE SUPPORT HE 
RECEIVES FROM ORDINARY IRAQIS. BIDAWID CALLED FOR A "SERIOUS 
DIALOGUE" AND DECLARED THAT AIR STRIKES WOULD ONLY LEAD TO 
MORE VIOLENCE. ACCORDING TO THE CATHOLIC LEADER, WESTERNERS 
DO NOT APPRECIATE THE ARAB MENTALITY AND THAT IF AN ARAB'S 
DIGNITY IS OFFENDED "HE WILL BE AS FEROCIOUS AS A LION." 
BIDAWID SAID "IT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE" THAT 
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS DIRECTED AT IRAQ HAVE NOT WEAKENED SADDAM 
HUSSEIN'S CONTROL OVER THE COUNTRY.

UKRAINE'S CARDINAL ASSESSES NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS UNITY 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶6.   UKRAINE'S NEWLY CREATED CARDINAL LUBOMYR HUSAR WANTS TO 
"REASON WITH" HIS ORTHODOX CHURCH COUNTERPARTS WHO OBJECT TO 
A PAPAL VISIT IN JUNE. SPEAKING AT A FEBRUARY 22 PRESS 
CONFERENCE IN VATICAN CITY, HUSAR SAID CATHOLICS IN UKRAINE 
HAVE THE SAME CULTURE, HISTORY, CHURCH STRUCTURE, THEOLOGY 
AND DISCIPLINE AS THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. HUSAR ACKNOWLEDGED 
THE TENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ORTHODOX CHURCH LEADERS BUT SAID 
THE SITUATION "IS NOT A STALEMATE." ACCORDING TO THE 
CARDINAL, THERE ARE TWO COMPLICATING FACTORS. THE FIRST IS 
THE GROWING STRENGTH OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN UKRAINE, 
WHICH AFTER YEARS OF COMMUNIST REPRESSION IS "REBOUNDING 
WITH VIGOROUS HEALTH" AND IS ACCUSED BY THE ORTHODOX OF 
COMPETING FOR SOULS.  SECONDLY, HUSAR SAID, THE ORTHODOX 
LEADERSHIP IS SPLINTERED AND THE MOSCOW PATRIARCHATE FEARS 
THAT A PAPAL VISIT MIGHT LEND CREDIBILITY TO ORTHODOX 
LEADERS OTHER THAN THE ONES BACKED BY MOSCOW. (NOTE: THE 
VATICAN HAS SAID POPE JOHN PAUL II WILL BE VISITING CATHOLIC 
FAITHFUL AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY INSENSITIVE INITIATIVES 
TOWARDS ORTHODOX LEADERS. END NOTE). CARDINAL HUSAR POINTED 
OUT THAT IN THE PAST THE COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA MACHINE HAD 
PORTRAYED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS A TOOL OF THE WEST 
DEDICATED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET STATE, AND THAT 
THE LINGERING EFFECTS OF THAT MESSAGE MAKE MANY UKRAINIANS 
UNEASY ABOUT THE CHURCH. HUSAR OPINED THAT THE UKRAINIAN 
GOVERNMENT BACKED THE PAPAL VISIT AS A "MEANS OF DRAWING THE 
COUNTRY CLOSER TO THE OTHER NATIONS OF EUROPE."

¶7.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS APPOINTED AMCIT VATICAN DIPLOMAT,

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND PUERTO RICO. THE 49-YEAR-OLD 
CLEVELAND NATIVE WILL BE ORDAINED AN ARCHBISHOP BY THE POPE

MINISTER EQUIVALENT), CARDINAL ANGELO SODANO. HE WAS 
ORDAINED A PRIEST IN 1977 AND HAS A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN 
CHURCH LAW. BROGLIO ENTERED THE VATICAN'S DIPLOMATIC SERVICE 
IN 1983 AND HAS SERVED IN IVORY COAST AND PARAGUAY, AS WELL 
AS AT THE VATICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY. HE SPEAKS FRENCH,
