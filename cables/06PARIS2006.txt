SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (U)  As of 1900 hours Paris time on March 28, preliminary 
police reports cite a turn-out for today's (ref A) nationwide 
demonstrations of over a million, double that recorded during 
previous protests against the Villepin government,s First 
Employment Contract (CPE).  Earlier in the day, Prime 
Minister de Villepin reiterated his refusal to withdraw the 
CPE, but also renewed his offer to "ameliorate" certain of 
the more controversial clauses of the youth employment reform 
law.  Outside of Paris, there were no reports of significant 
violence during demonstrations and protest marches that, in 
most cases, took place during late morning and early 
afternoon.  The march in Paris, which began in mid-afternoon, 
was marred by one clash between hooligans and police at the 
beginning of the march.  Later in the afternoon, dozens of 
hooligans were arrested as plainclothes police tried to 
prevent muggings and robberies of demonstrators.  As of early 
evening, the site of the end of the Paris march, the Place de 
la Republique in eastern Paris remains tense as hooligans 
challenge riot police amid the dispersing demonstrators.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
SIZEABLE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS NATIONWIDE 
------------------------------------------ 
¶2.  (U) Preliminary police reports cite 1,055,000 as the 
number of anti-CPE protesters who took to the streets today, 
in the fourth iteration of nationwide protests against the 
Villepin government's youth employment labor reform, the 
First Employment Contract (CPE) (ref A).  Organizers claim 
that 3 million participated nationwide.  The police figures 
are double those reported for the demonstrations on March 18, 
the largest anti-CPE protests (ref C) until today's. 
(Comment: The success of today's protests is certain to 
encourage the student, labor, and political organizations 
behind the campign to persist in demanding a full withdrawal 
of the controversial labor reform.  End Comment). 
 
VILLEPIN STANDS HIS GROUND 
-------------------------- 
¶3.  (U) Earlier today, Prime Minister de Villepin reiterated 
his refusal to withdraw the CPE, but also renewed his offer 
to "ameliorate" the most contested clauses of his 
controversial youth employment reform law.  "The unions have 
refused my outstretched hand," Villepin said during a 
mid-afternoon speech in the National Assembly.  "If they 
would like to reduce the two year trial period, and if they 
want (the employer to provide) a reason for firing the 
employee, then I am open to those discussions."  (Note: The 
response of organized labor, as articulated by Francois 
Chereque, head of the moderate CFDT trade union federation 
is, "We're not interested in negotiating the details of 
allowing employers to fire without cause -- that's the 
fundamental change in the relationship between employer and 
employee that we object to".  End note.) 
 
PROTEST LEADERS PROMISE TO PURSUE THEIR SUCCESS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶4.  (U) Referring to today,s large turnout, Bernard 
Thibault, leader of the once communist CGT trade union 
federation said, "It is unimaginable that the prime minister 
is sticking to his position.  For us, there is only one 
answer -- withdrawal of the CPE law."  Jean-Claude Mailly, 
leader of the militant FO trade union federation, was even 
more confident, saying, "Unless Villepin announces the 
withdrawal of the CPE law tonight, I will call for another 
day of strikes."  Judging that the student led-movement had 
yet to reach its peak, Bruno Julliard, leader of the UNEF 
student union, predicted that the protest movement would 
continue to grow to "tidal wave" proportions. 
Representatives of the numerous student, labor, and political 
organizations that are leading the protests will meet 
tomorrow afternoon (March 29) march to review today,s events 
and discuss next steps.

PARIS INCONVENIENCED, BUT NO MORE, DESPITE SIZEABLE 
PARTICIPATION IN STRIKES 
--------------------------------- 
¶5.  (U) Most of Paris' transportation networks appeared to be 
functioning better than expected, with buses, trams, subways 
and commuter trains operating at almost 70 percent of 
capacity, as opposed to the 50 percent predicted.  Even so, 
today,s transportation strike affected at least 70 cities 
and towns throughout France, including Paris.  According to 
preliminary estimates from the Education Ministry, about 40 
percent of high school teachers walked off the job nationwide 
(more than the prior March 7, 2006 strike against the CPE 
(ref D), but less than the January 20, 2005 strike against 
the education reforms proposed by then-Education Minister 
Francois Fillon).  For the first time since the anti-CPE 
strikes began in early February, there appeared to be 
significant participation among employees from the parastatal 
companies (essentially the telephone, gas and electric 
utilities, and the post office).  A significant turnout was 
also reported for private sector banks, steel companies and 
telecoms, although no official figures were provided. 
 
MINOR INCIDENTS OF HOOLIGAN VIOLENCE -- SO FAR 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶6.  (U) Nationwide, there have been no reports of major 
violence.  However, as the Paris demonstration got underway 
in the early afternoon, there was a brief altercation between 
some one hundred masked youths ("casseurs" (ref B)) and 
security personnel affiliated with the trade unions.  The 
hooded hooligans then attempted to attack a supermarket, but 
were rebuffed when the manager closed the heavy metal gates. 
Undaunted, they then shattered the windows of the cafe 
next-door before riot police intervened and hauled many of 
them away. 
 
ARRESTS AND TENSION AT END POINT OF PARIS MARCH 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶7.  (U) As today's march in Paris winds down (1900 local 
time), and demonstrators disperse from its end point at the 
Place de la Republique in eastern Paris, there are reports -- 
televised live -- of gangs of hooligans assaulting and 
robbing demonstrators and challenging riot police. 
Approximately 100 hooligans fled authorities after attacking 
demonstrators and stealing cell phones, cameras, and bags. 
Several dozen arrests were reported, many by plain-clothes 
police patrolling among the demonstrators.  Many shops and 
business around the Place de la Republique are closed and 
shuttered for fear of vandalism and looting by hooligans 
after nightfall.
