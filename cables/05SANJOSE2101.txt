¶1.  (U) Econoff delivered nonpapers (Refs A and B) to Edwin 
Arias, Deputy Director for Foreign Policy in the Costa 
Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), and discussed the 
issues with Ronald Obaldia and Rolando Madrigal from the 
MFA on September 8, 2005.  The representatives of MFA 
understood our positions and stated that they had shared 
the information with the appropriate personnel, including 
their team at the United Nations, and that they have not 
yet formulated official responses on these issues. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) With respect to the proposal by Algeria, Brazil, 
Chile, France, Germany, and Spain regarding innovative 
sources of financing for development, Ronald Obaldia stated 
that reducing poverty is a subject very important to the 
GOCR and is a top priority.  While not officially saying 
the GOCR supported the six-country proposal, the MFA 
representatives did not express opposition to implementing 
a numerical goal for a country's official development 
assistance.  While discussing this issue, Obaldia mentioned 
several times that he remembered when ex-Costa Rican 
President Miguel Angel Rodriguez wanted the goal to be 1.0 
percent of GDP (instead of the 0.7 percent in the proposal 
by the six countries). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The MFA representatives did say that they would 
not be inclined to support a tax on airline tickets because 
it could have an adverse impact on Costa Rica's tourism 
industry, and because of potential problems with existing 
international agreements.
