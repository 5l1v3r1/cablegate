SUBJECT:  FRENCH SECRETARY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VISITS DRC 
 
REF:  Kinshasa 519 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  French Secretary for Human Rights Rama Yade 
re-extended an invitation to President Kabila to visit France, 
announced a 300,000 euro grant to assist street children in Kinshasa 
and made a side trip to Bukavu during her June 8-11 visit to the DRC 
visit.  The French hope Kabila will travel to Paris at the end of 
July. 
Their relatively low-key approach to Congolese relations has enabled 
France to raise sensitive issues without the acrimony of recent 
Belgian-Congolese exchanges (reftel).  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) French Secretary for Human Rights Rama Yade, in her first 
visit to the DRC June 8-11, re-extended an official invitation to 
President Kabila to visit France.  She also reiterated France's 
support for the reconstruction of the DRC, especially the health, 
environment, and education sectors, during their June 9 meeting in 
Kinshasa.  The French DCM told us Kabila did not confirm a specific 
date for the visit; the French embassy here hopes the visit will 
take place at the end of July. 
 
¶3.  (U) Yade announced a 300,000 euro grant to the NGO Medecins du 
Monde (MDM) to assist street children in Kinshasa.  The grant will 
help provide food and medical care to children's centers throughout 
the capital.  MDM estimates that 18,000 children live on the streets 
of Kinshasa.  Many are believed to suffer from malaria, a number of 
infectious diseases, as well as untreated injuries and wounds of 
various kinds. 
 
¶4.  (U) Yade met with Governor Louis Muderhwa of South Kivu June 10 
in Bukavu.  She also visited the BVES Center for Child Soldiers and 
visited victims of sexual violence at Panzi Hospital.  The French 
DCM said a planned visit to an IDP camp was cancelled due to 
logistical concerns. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  Unlike the Belgians (reftel), the French appear 
to be well regarded within the DRC government.  Through several high 
level visits this year, including by Foreign Minister Kouchner, they 
have made it known they want to strengthen bilateral ties.  Their 
relatively low-key diplomatic approach, in contrast to the more 
strident behavior of many official Belgian visitors, coupled with 
foreign aid, seems to have struck a positive chord with Kabila. 
Additionally, Yade's personal presence and charm, herself of 
francophone African background, undoubtedly made a highly favorable 
impression here.  End Comment.
