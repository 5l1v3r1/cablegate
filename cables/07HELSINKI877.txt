REF: STATE 164778 
 
 (U) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Outi Holopainen, 
Office Director of the Finnish MFA's Arms Control and 
Non-Proliferation Unit, Dec. 13.  Holopainen expressed 
enthusiasm for the PSI 5th Anniversary Conference, saying 
that the GoF is seeking to ramp up its own interagency 
coordination on PSI and that the conference will provide 
timely incentive for that process.  Finland will attend, and 
will inform us later as to the exact composition of its 
delegation.
