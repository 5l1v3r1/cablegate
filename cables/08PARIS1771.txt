¶1. (U) This is an action cable. See paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Recent press reporting has speculated on the 
possible sale or lease of Airbus aircraft to Syria's 
state carrier.  While the GOF has downplayed the 
reports, speculation has centered on ways in which a 
deal could be structured to sidestep U.S. sanctions, 
possibly through lease and purchase of several Airbus 
aircrafts through a private third-party. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We will meet or encounter EADS and Airbus 
officials on several occasions over the next two to 
three weeks.  Embassy requests specific guidance on 
the restrictions imposed by U.S. legislation on sales 
to Syria, including as relates to possible third-party 
lease agreements.
