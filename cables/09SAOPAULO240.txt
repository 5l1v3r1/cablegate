"Latin America's memories" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-24) by the head of Brazil's 
Senate and former President Jose Sarney states: "Only Brazil and the 
U.S. saved themselves in Trinidad Tobago.....President Lula, more 
than trying to calm down dinosaurs, was saving the hemisphere's 
image....[while President Barack Obama] showed with the color of his 
skin that not only the U.S. has changed but also the world.....Obama 
brought a new message, an invitation to solidarity and a joint view 
of work and cooperation.....Lula has increased Brazil's 
international level. Our position in Trinidad Tobago showed a mature 
and modern Brazil, able to negotiate with the U.S. at the same level 
as Obama. Everything else was excessive fluff"
