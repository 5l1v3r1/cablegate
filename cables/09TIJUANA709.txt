SUBJECT: LAW ENFORCEMENT HIGH JINKS IN TJ: HOW NARCOTRAFFICKERS EVADE 
AUTHORITIES  
CLASSIFIED BY: ARADETSKY, Political Officer, Pol/Econ, STATE. 
REASON: 1.4 (d) 
 
 
¶1.            (C) Mexican state and federal authorities have 
made impressive numbers of arrests and narcotics seizures over 
the last two years in Baja California, weakening, but not 
defeating, the organized crime syndicates that operate in the 
state.   Despite these successes, the complex interactions among 
the various local and federal law enforcement agencies and local 
powerbrokers make Baja California, and Tijuana in particular, 
still a relatively safe place for narcotraffickers to ply their 
trade. 
 
¶2.      (C)  This fact was demonstrated by a June 30 incident in 
front of Consulate Tijuana.   Acting on information from the law 
enforcement community (LEC), Post's ARSO requested Baja 
California State Preventative Police (PEP) appear at the 
Consulate to arrest an American citizen who had a U.S. arrest 
warrant for drug trafficking and was scheduled to come in to 
renew his passport that day.   PEP forces, as they have done in 
similar cases in the past, duly stationed an unmarked car 
outside the Consulate and waited for the subject to exit the 
building.   However, when the subject walked out, he entered a 
Crown Victoria vehicle with two body guards which quickly sped 
off and entered the parking lot of the Agua Caliente Racetrack, 
across the street from the Consulate, which is owned by Tijuana 
former mayor Jorge Hank Rohn.  (NOTE: it is unclear if the 
bodyguards inside the Crown Victoria were policemen offering 
protection to the subject or part of Hank's security apparatus, 
but the Crown Victoria is a typical car used by policemen who 
provide protection for drug traffickers or government 
officials).    As soon as the vehicle entered the Racetrack, the 
PEP forces stopped their (half-hearted) pursuit and told ARSO 
that they "could not enter" the racetrack.  And that was that. 
 
¶3.      (C) Hank is widely believed to have been a corrupt mayor 
and to be still involved in narco-trafficking.   Post usually 
receives exceptional cooperation from the PEP, but our normal 
liaison declined to involve himself in this case, and ARSO also 
found it odd that the PEP stationed outside the Consulate did 
not use normal police situational awareness procedures to notice 
the Crown Victoria before the subject's escape.    Despite 
Hank's political defeat in the 2007 Baja California 
gubernatorial race, he still enjoys wide influence in Tijuana, 
and state law enforcement officials appear unwilling to meddle 
on areas considered his turf.   This is not the first time law 
enforcement agencies from outside Tijuana have rubbed up against 
Hank.   Just a month ago, Mexican military forces were involved 
in a standoff with local security at Hank's racetrack.   There 
are still plenty of safe havens for organized crime in the 
border region.
