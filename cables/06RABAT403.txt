SUBJECT: ARAB MAGHREB UNION:  LETTERS TO SECRETARY RICE AND 
NEA FROM SECRETARY GENERAL BEN YAHYA 
 
 
 ¶1.  (U) Post received on March 3 the following letters to 
Secretary Rice and NEA A/S Welch from Secretary General of 
 
SIPDIS 
the Arab Maghreb Union Habib Ben Yahya.  The originals have 
been pouched to NEA/MAG. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Begin letter (as received) to Secretary Rice: 
 
Dear Madam, 
 
On the occasion of my appointment as Secretary General of the 
Arab Maghreb Union, I have the honor to stress the great 
efforts you're making as Secretary of State, to strengthen 
the intente cordiale and partnership between the Maghrebian 
countries and the United States of America, thanks to your 
great knowledge of the many challenges confronting the 
region, and to your outstanding talents. 
 
I would also take this opportunity to assure Your Excellency, 
during my tenure of office, to continue working together to 
strengthen the ties existing between the Maghreb and USA, 
relations that actually experience great achievements, and 
are expected to be strengthened. 
 
I will surely be counting on the United States of America's 
support, and on Your Excellency's help too, in carrying out 
my mission aiming essentially at reactivating the process of 
the Maghreb integration, consolidating its structures and 
making out of it a region of development, peace and security 
in North Africa. 
 
Considering the initiatives of the American administration 
launched in favor of the institution of a Maghrebian sub 
regional and integrated entity, able to cooperate with other 
groups in its immediate neighborhood, and also with its great 
traditional partners, including the United States of America, 
I would like to reaffirm the Arab Maghreb Union's commitment 
to fully support initiatives that can bolster the AMU, 
contribute to promote the development in the Maghreb, and 
further foster the friendly ties among its people. 
 
Looking forward to meeting your Excellency, and discussing 
cooperation perspectives between the Arab Maghreb Union and 
the United States of America, 
 
I remain Sincerely Yours. 
 
Habib BEN YAHIA 
Secretary General 
 
SIPDIS 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Begin letter (as received) to NEA A/S Welch: 
 
Dear Mr. Secretary (David), 
 
I would like to acknowledge with thanks your letter 
congratulating me on my appointment as Secretary General of 
the Arab Maghreb Union. 
 
I would like also to seize this opportunity to thank you for 
your supporting efforts to strengthen the Arab Maghreb Union, 
which is committed since its creation in 1989 to making the 
Maghreb a region of peace, stability and development. 
 
During my tenure of office, I can assure you that I will be 
doing my best to reactivate the AMU institutions in order to 
really strive for more regional integration.  I will surely 
be counting on your supporting efforts in looking for 
positive regional initiatives that can bolster the AMU's 
genuine endeavors to strengthen the regional integration 
process and to contribute to overcome the many challenges 
confronting the AMU's drive to achieve its development 
objectives. 
 
Sincerely yours. 
 
Habib BEN YAHIA 
Secretary General 
 
SIPDIS
