SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON IDP SITUATION IN PAKISTAN 
 
REF:  Islamabad 940 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The UN and partner agencies have now set up three 
IDP camps, two in Mardan and another in Swabi to accommodate a total 
of 1150 refugee families.  All camps are being developed by UNHCR 
site planners, and WHO and UNICEF are developing water/sanitation 
and health facilities.  As of May 4, 194 families from Dir and Buner 
have registered in the camps, and 4,304 families have registered 
outside of camps in Swabi, Mardan, and Charsadda Districts.  WFP has 
distributed food items to approximately 21,000 new IDPs since 
registration began.  UN agencies report that the Swat District 
Commissioner is now requiring evacuation of Mingora and suggest that 
a resulting displacement of up to 200,000 additional IDPs would 
severely strain existing resources.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) UN and partner agencies were active over the weekend in 
Mardan and Swabi Districts.  They, with local authorities, have now 
set up three camps to receive IDPs.  In Mardan, a camp at Jalala 
will accept up to 600 families, and another at Shaikh Shahzad will 
accommodate up to 400 families.  UNHCR has already provided tents 
and NFIs for 200 families, and more will be sent as the camps are 
developed in the coming days.  In Swabi District, one camp at Yar 
Hussain is being developed to accommodate up to 150 families. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Social Welfare Department (SWD) has begun registering 
new arrivals from Lower Dir and Buner at humanitarian hubs in 
Mardan, Charsadda and Swabi.  Food and NFI items are being 
distributed at the point of registration by UNHCR partner Sarhad 
Rural Support Program (SRSP).  UNHCR reports that as of May 4, a 
total of 194 families(1,422 individuals) from Lower Dir and Buner 
have registered in camps.  Outside of camps, 4,304 families (25,824 
individuals) have registered in Swabi, Mardan, and Charsadda 
Districts.    Of those registered outside the camp, 72 percent come 
from Buner, and 28 percent come from Lower Dir.  Registration staff 
have reported congestion and inadequate staffing, but UNHCR and the 
Minister of Social Development have agreed that teams will be 
strengthened to speed up registration. 
 
¶4. (SBU) While UNHCR reports that systems are set for accepting 
newly displaced persons into IDP camps, there remain concerns for 
IDPs in host communities.  Communities already host a large number 
of IDPs, and coping mechanisms are being stretched. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The UN assessment mission reported that most of the IDPs 
from Buner had to leave their homes abruptly and without warning as 
the military operations began.  Many left with nothing, including 
their identify cards (NICs).  On a more positive note, most told 
UNHCR that they would return home as soon as possible because it is 
now harvest season in Buner. 
 
¶6. (SBU) An accurate count of new IDPs continues to be elusive.  A 
USAID/OFDA implementing partner with programs in both Lower Dir and 
Buner reports from field staff on the ground that there are an 
estimated 17,000 families displaced in Lower Dir.  They say that 65 
percent of the Lower Dir IDPs remain in Lower Dir, mostly with host 
families.  The others have moved out to Malakand, Mardan and 
Charsadda Districts.  They believe that 30,000 have come out of 
Buner.  Al-Khidmat Foundation, a local NGO that is providing warm 
meals to IDPs, estimates that as many as 35,000 families have fled 
Buner.  Another local NGO active in the region conducted an 
assessment over the weekend and believes that as of noon on Sunday, 
May 3, 9,000 families had arrived in Mardan and Swabi from Buner. 
All reports indicate that most of the new IDPs are staying with host 
families. 
 
¶7. (SBU) As of May 5, WFP reports that it has distributed food items 
to approximately 21,000 new IDPs since registration began.  There 
are now two WFP distribution hubs in Mardan, and, as of May 5, WFP 
will have two others in Swabi.  WHO is working with local health 
officials and providing health services in new camps and mobile 
services in Mardan.  WHO is looking for a partner organization to 
provide the same in Swabi.  Water/sanitation work is also 
progressing in the new camps.  UNICEF reports that water tanks have 
been placed in the camps, and tankering services have begun. 
Latrine construction is ongoing.  UNICEF also reports that two 
schools are already functioning in Yar Hussain camp (Swabi) and that 
schools will be opened soon in the Mardan camps.

¶8.  (SBU) At a May 5 General Coordination Meeting hosted by OCHA for 
donors and UN and NGO humanitarian assistance providers, a major 
concern was rumblings out of Swat that the District Commissioner is 
now requiring the evacuation of Mingora.  Humanitarian agencies 
suggest that such an evacuation could result in up to 200,000 
additional IDPs.  UNHCR expressed concern that pipelines were meant 
to meet humanitarian needs prior to the Dir and Buner displacements. 
 While HCR has 21,000 NFI kits available at present and HCR expects 
new supplies within two weeks, the needs of those IDPs who have not 
come out of Dir as well as an additional displacement from Swat 
would severely strain existing resources.  WFP has prepositioned 
food on the supposition of more people coming out of Dir, Buner, and 
Swat.  WFP is currently feeding 500,000 IDPs and has planned for 
600,000, but displacement of another 200,000 would exceed the 
planned worst case scenario.
