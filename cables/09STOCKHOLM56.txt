¶1. On January 24, the Swedish Transport Agency (STA) revoked 
the operating license of Nordic Airways, a carrier operating 
flights between Sweden and Iraq.  The Stockholm District 
Court turned down a request by Nordic Airways, which had been 
operating with a temporary license, to extend the period it 
had agreed upon to reconstruct the company. 
 
¶2. The STA stated it revoked Nordic Airways' license due to 
the carrier's long-running financial difficulties.  STA 
Divisional manager Simon Posluk commented that Nordic Airways 
was "no longer able to fulfill its commitments and duties to 
its passengers."  Posluk stated that an unknown number of 
passengers now risk being stranded in Iraq.  Nordic Airways 
operated a flight to northern Iraq on January 20 and another 
to Baghdad on January 23.
