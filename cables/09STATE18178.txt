SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - SUDAN 
 
¶1.  The Department of State continues to warn against 
all travel to Sudan due to threats from armed 
conflicts and terrorism.  American citizens who 
choose to remain in Sudan should take appropriate 
precautions, particularly in light of the January 
2008 murder of two American Embassy employees, the 
possibility of protests related to the expected 
issuance of an arrest warrant by the International 
Criminal Court for the President of Sudan on March 4, 
2009, and ongoing violence in many regions of the 
country.  This Travel Warning for Sudan replaces the 
Travel Warning issued on October 2, 2008, to note the 
potential for violence when the ICC announces its 
decision. 
¶2.  In July 2008, the Prosecutor of the International 
Criminal Court (ICC) requested that a warrant of 
arrest be issued for Sudan's President Omar Hassan 
al-Bashir for genocide and crimes against humanity. 
The ICC said on February 23 that it will announce its 
decision regarding the request for a warrant on March 
4, 2009.  There is a potential for violent protests 
and incidents targeting Europeans and Americans if 
the ICC issues an arrest warrant or additional 
indictments against President Bashir. 
¶3.  On January 1, 2008, two American Embassy 
employees were assassinated while traveling in their 
vehicle in Khartoum.  In May 2008, the city of 
Omdurman, adjacent to Khartoum, was attacked by armed 
militias.  The Embassy has implemented heightened 
security measures to protect Embassy personnel in 
Sudan, which include obtaining advance permission for 
all travel and modes of transportation to be used. 
American citizens residing in Sudan are urged to 
maintain situational awareness at all times. 
¶4.  The Department of State continues to warn U.S. 
citizens against all travel to Sudan, particularly in 
the Darfur area, where violence between Sudanese 
Government forces and various armed militias 
continues.  Americans and Europeans have been victims 
of carjackings and armed robberies while traveling in 
Sudan.  Land travel at night should be avoided. 
¶5.  Travelers are reminded that the U.S. Government 
has received information on terrorist threats aimed 
at American and European interests in Sudan. 
Terrorist actions may include suicide operations, 
bombings, or kidnappings.  U.S. citizens should be 
aware of the risk of indiscriminate attacks on 
civilian targets in public places, including tourist 
sites and locations where expatriates are known to 
congregate, and commercial operations associated with 
U.S. or European interests.  Anti-American/European 
demonstrations periodically occur, mostly in the 
capital city of Khartoum. 
¶6.  Travel anywhere in Sudan, including Khartoum and 
the adjacent town of Omdurman, is potentially 
dangerous.  Militia forces have instigated sporadic 
violence and have attacked locations in Southern 
Sudan.  Threats have been made against foreigners 
working in the oil industry in Upper Nile state. 
¶7.  Enforcement of aviation safety standards in Sudan 
is uneven; civil aviation in Sudan continues to 
experience air incidents and accidents, including 
five crashes with at least 64 fatalities between 
November 8, 2007, and September 21, 2008.  Incidents 
included engine failures, a collapsed landing gear, 
and planes veering off the runway.  In August 2008, a 
domestic flight originating in Nyala, Darfur was 
hijacked and forced to land in Libya. 
¶8.  Americans traveling to Sudan despite this Travel 
Warning are advised to travel, whenever possible, 
directly to their destinations on international 
 
STATE 00018178  002 OF 002 
 
 
carriers from countries whose civil aviation 
authorities meet international aviation safety 
standards for the oversight of their air carrier 
operations under the FAA's International Aviation 
Safety Assessment program. 
¶9.  Americans traveling to Sudan must possess a valid 
passport with at least six months of validity and a 
Sudanese visa.  Travelers must apply for a visa in 
their own country of residence.  In August 2006, five 
foreigners, including two Americans, were arrested 
and detained in Darfur after entering Sudan via the 
Chadian border without the appropriate documentation. 
 Several of these individuals had solicited and 
obtained escorts in Chad who allegedly promised to 
facilitate entry into Sudan but were ultimately 
unable to follow through with their commitments. 
Without appropriate travel documents and permits, 
travelers may face arrest and detention for crimes 
including illegal entry, publication of false 
information, and espionage.  If convicted, sentences 
range from deportation to life in prison or the death 
penalty. 
¶10.  Upon arrival, the traveler must register with 
the Ministry of Interior within 72 hours.  The 
Sudanese Government requires that anyone seeking to 
travel outside a 25-kilometer radius of Khartoum 
obtain a special travel permit.  The Government has 
established additional permit requirements for travel 
to Darfur that apply to humanitarian workers, 
journalists, photographers, and other media 
employees.  Separate additional permits are required 
to take photographs, even for private use, and to 
conduct journalism-related activities anywhere in 
Sudan. 
¶11.  U.S. citizens are strongly urged to register 
with the Embassy in Khartoum or through the State 
Department's Travel Registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  By 
registering, American citizens make it easier for the 
Embassy to contact them in case of emergency. 
¶12.  U.S. citizens should note that the Embassy 
varies its operating hours without advance notice due 
to the dynamic political and security situation. 
Services for U.S. citizens are available by 
appointment only.  Requests for an appointment can be 
made by e-mailing KhartoumConsular@state.gov. 
American citizens may request emergency services at 
any time, but the ability of the U.S. Embassy to 
assist U.S. citizens in an emergency is limited. 
 
¶13.  The U.S. Embassy is located at Sharia Ali Abdul 
Latif, Khartoum; tel. (249-183)774-700/1/2/3 (outside 
Sudan); tel (0183) 774-700/1/2/3 (inside Sudan). 
U.S. citizens may contact the consular section by 
phone or email KhartoumConsular@state.gov. 
Additional information and U.S. Embassy warden 
messages are available on our website: 
http://sudan.usembassy.gov/.  For after-hours 
emergencies, please call (249-183) 774-7000/1/2/3 and 
ask to be connected to the duty officer. 
 
¶14.  U.S. citizens should also consult the Department 
of State's Country Specific Information for Sudan and 
the Worldwide Caution, both located on the 
Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov.  Safety and security is also 
available toll-free at 1-888-407-4747 from within the 
United States and Canada, or at regular toll rates at 
1-202-501-4444 for callers outside the United States 
and Canada, from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 
Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays). 
 
¶15. Minimize considered.
