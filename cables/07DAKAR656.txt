REF: STATE 050692 
 
Although Guinea-Bissau is closed, this report is submitted in 
anticipation of leasing commercial office space for TDY personnel. 
The following paragraphs and codes are keyed to the ACEQ format 
provided by DS/IP/ITA: 
 
¶1.  Crime Mobility: (E) 
 
Opportunistic criminal elements roam freely day or night and target 
affluent residential areas for burglary. 
 
¶2.  Crime ambience around neighborhoods: (C) 
 
Most American embassy personnel resided on compound until post 
closed in June 1998.  Most neighborhoods in Bissau are surrounded 
within walking distance of high crime areas. 
 
¶3.  Aggressiveness of Criminals: (B) 
 
Criminal perpetrators usually commit street crimes and burglaries, 
but rely on stealth during burglaries. 
 
¶4.  Arming of Criminals: (B) 
 
Although sometimes armed with firearms, criminal perpetrators 
usually are armed with knives or lethal cutting weapons.  Reports 
indicate that machetes and other sharp instruments are the most 
common weapons used to commit crimes. 
 
¶5.  Aggregation of Criminals: (C) 
 
Criminal perpetrators usually operate in groups of two to four 
individuals.  Street scams, pick pocketing, purse snatching, and 
theft by intimidation are frequently perpetrated by small groups of 
individuals.  Often beggars and vendors create a distraction, while 
collaborators accost the victim. 
 
¶6.  Deterrence/Response of Police: (D) 
 
Local police or neighborhood associations are totally ineffective at 
deterring or disrupting burglaries and other crimes and seldom are 
able to apprehend or arrest suspects after the fact. 
 
¶7.  Training/Professionalism of Police: (F) 
 
Police are a negative factor; besides being inept, untrained and 
uncaring, they are corrupt and may collaborate with criminal 
elements, or carry out crimes themselves under protection of their 
official duties.
