¶1. (U) On January 24, polcouns and poloff met Vice Minister of Government Deyanira Arguello to discuss the status of various GON efforts to combat trafficking in persons (TIP). As Vice Minister of Government, Arguello has the primary responsibility for overseeing all GON anti-trafficking programs. Since she took office in July 2005, she has proven to be a dynamic manager, strongly committed to strengthening anti-trafficking efforts in all areas. She has tirelessly lobbied the National Assembly to approve the new Criminal Code, which is pending in the Assembly's Justice Committee and which would dramatically strengthen Nicaragua's anti-trafficking statutes. She believes that one stumbling block holding up approval of the code is the fact that it would eliminate any statute of limitations for child sexual abuse. Although the new code would not be retroactive, Arguello said that this provision nevertheless worries Sandinista (FSLN) leader Daniel Ortega, whose (now adult) step daughter, Zoilamerica Narvaez, has accused him of rape and sexual abuse committed over an extended period (reftel A).
 
¶2. (U) Poloffs urged the Vice Minister to send the Embassy a tightly-focused anti-trafficking proposal that post will submit to G/TIP for possible FY 2006 funding. Poloffs also noted that post has INL funds available for smaller anti-TIP projects, such as the printing of posters for the Ministry's ongoing anti-TIP awareness campaign, and encouraged the Vice Minister to contact the Embassy whenever we can assist with such efforts. (NOTE: Post is presently using INL funds to finance the production of two thirty-second anti-TIP television spots. The Ministry of Government has secured an agreement with local television stations to air them free of charge. END NOTE)
 
¶3. (U) Arguello assured us that the GON will continue to lobby the National Assembly for the approval of the Criminal Code, work to strengthen and increase TIP prosecutions, and expand its multi-faceted awareness raising campaign. She added that USG support for all of these efforts is crucial. Arguello noted that the GON,s toll-free hotline for victims of TIP, sexual abuse, and other crimes, managed by the Ministry of the Family, is up and running. The Ministry of Government is working to ensure continued budget for line maintenance and phone calls, and to make the number usable throughout Central America.
 
¶4. (U) Arguello's assistant, Maria Gabriella Zuniga, who runs the Ministry's anti-TIP office, informed poloffs that three suspected traffickers who were acquitted by a Managua jury in November (reftel B) will face a new trial sometime this year because of problems with the jury that only came to light after the trial concluded. When prosecutors learned that one of the five jurors was deaf and another had a criminal record, they asked the judge to throw out the verdict and order a new trial, which the judge has now done. Post will closely observe the new trial when it is scheduled.
