Poloff discussed REFTEL A points on October 15 and REFTEL B 
points on October 23 with Jose Luis Garcia Galan, MFA Deputy 
Director General for Southeast Asia, and Fernando Fernandez 
Arias, Director of the MFA Human Rights Office.  We requested 
information about Spain's efforts to support human rights and 
democracy in Burma and encouraged greater funding for any 
such programs.  We urged Spain to consider implementing 
financial sanctions against the Burmese regime, particularly 
bans on the export of financial services and on new 
investment.  The Spanish officials appreciated being kept 
apprised of recent U.S. sanctions on the regime, but said 
that Spain does not have an Embassy in Burma and maintains 
only limited contact.  However, they said they would lend 
their support to whatever punitive actions the EU decides to 
take.  The GOS would appreciate information on future U.S. 
initiatives to support the Burmese people.
