SUBJECT: SOYBEAN BOYCOTT IN THE AMAZON REGION: 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: Multinational soy traders agreed to a two-year 
moratorium on the purchase of soybeans from newly deforested land 
starting in the 2006-07 crop season. A remarkable feature is that 
even soybeans grown on land legally cleared during this period on 
farms in the Amazon forest zone will not be purchased by these 
traders.  The agreement followed a Greenpeace report claiming that 
the grain's cultivation is responsible for the deforestation of new 
lands in the Amazon.  U.S. distributors Cargill, Archer Daniels 
Midland Co. and Bunge Ltd., as well as France's Dreyfus and 
Brazilian-owned Amaggi are all taking part in the boycott. End 
Summary 
 
¶2.  Greenpeace, together with McDonald's and leading European food 
retailers, formed an alliance to persuade soybean traders to stop 
deforestation in the Amazon.  This alliance brought the big soy 
traders to the negotiating table, since the majority of the 
Brazilian soy production goes to Europe and is being used to feed 
chickens, pigs and cattle for meat production. 
 
¶3.  Soy is the leading cash crop in Brazil and some studies suggest 
that it is a principal driver of Amazon deforestation, along with 
cattle ranching and illegal logging.  According to Brazilian 
Association of Oilseed Industries (Abiove), 4.9% of the country's 
soy production takes place in the Amazon covering nearly 2.84 
million acres. 
 
¶4.  The Brazilian Agricultural Ministry is worried about this 
decision and believes that this could be a non-tariff export barrier 
on the Brazilian crop.  On the other hand, Greenpeace responded by 
saying the moratorium will remain until there is an agreement with 
the Brazilian government and key stakeholders on long-term 
protection for the Amazon Rainforest.  Greenpeace Director in the 
Amazon, Paulo Adario, was quoted as saying that two years is too 
short of a time for results to be seen and a verbal agreement with 
the agribusiness sector assures the revision of the time-span in 
¶2008. 
 
¶5.  Comment:  While laudable in spirit, certain questions remain to 
be answered.  First and foremost is the capacity for the 
distributors to monitor and enforce the ban, as no mechanism exists 
to prohibit co-mingling of crops or track deforestation on a 
farm-by-farm basis.  Moreover, despite Greenpeace's claims that soy 
is definitively linked to deforestation, many purport that the 
evidence is unsubstantiated.  Until this question is answered, the 
efficacy of the program remains uncertain. End Comment
