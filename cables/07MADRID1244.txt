¶1. (U) On June 21 Spanish media outlets reported that 130 
kilos of explosives (reportedly enough to make eight bombs) 
were found in Huelva, Spain, two kilometers from the 
Portuguese border, in an abandoned Ford Focus allegedly 
belonging to the Basque terrorist group ETA.  The vehicle 
contained detonators, timers, and one remote control.  Daily 
ABC reported that Spanish security forces may have foiled a 
delivery to an ETA command cell that would be based in the 
popular Portuguese tourist destination of Algarve, and would 
support a chain of summer attacks against tourist interests 
in Andalucia. 
 
¶2. (U) National Police and the Civil Guard have been on high 
alert since ETA's June 6 rupture of its "permanent" 
cease-fire.  They have further reinforced security in the 
likelihood that ETA has set up other commands for attacks 
throughout Spain. 
 
¶3. (U) Daily El Pais reported that President Zapatero 
congratulated Spanish security forces for their work and a 
CiU (the leading Catalan regional party) spokesperson said 
that all Spanish political parties will stand by the Spanish 
government in their efforts against ETA.
