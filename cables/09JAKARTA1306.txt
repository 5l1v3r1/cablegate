REF: 08 JAKARTA 2234 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: Jakarta requires the Department's urgent 
assistance in securing Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) 
clearance for a GOI official who was invited by the FBI and 
U.S. Marshal Service to Washington for anti-corruption 
consultations.  Facilitating this travel is a United States 
priority.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Mission requests the Department's urgent assistance 
in securing interagency SAO clearance for an Indonesian 
official to travel to Washington on August 9 for meetings 
with the FBI and the U.S. Marshal Service.  Budi Ibrahim is 
Director of Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission and 
was part of a delegation whom FBI Deputy Director Pistole met 
during his November 2008 visit to Indonesia.  This official 
already traveled to the United States in December 2008 to 
further develop cooperation under the Memorandum of 
Understanding between Indonesia,s Corruption Eradication 
Commission (KPK) and the FBI (reftel). 
 
¶3.  (U) Consular Chief Jeffrey Tunis sent particulars of the 
individual by email in an expedite request to Greg Beer in 
CA/VO.  His name and particulars are Budi Ibrahim, 
DOB:13May62, IDSA. 
 
¶4.  (U) Fighting corruption in Indonesia and building 
cooperative links between GOI law enforcement officials and 
their USG counterparts are key USG priorities here.  The 
difficulties Ibrahim is having with the SAO process threaten 
progress on this important objective.  This is not the first 
time the SAO process has created difficulties for senior GOI 
officials, and Budi Ibrahim in particular, as noted in 
reftel.  Jakarta requests Department's assistance to address 
this problem.  In the meantime, please assist by expediting 
the SAO clearance for Budi Ibrahim.
