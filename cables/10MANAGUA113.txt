SUBJECT: (C) President Ortega Asks Former Amb. to U.S. to Consider a 
Second Washington Tour 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Robert J. Callahan, Ambassador, Department of State, 
Exec; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Arturo Cruz Jr., Nicaragua's most recent Ambassador to the 
United States, recently confided to the Ambassador that President 
Daniel Ortega had asked Cruz to consider a second tour in 
Washington as Ambassador.  Cruz says he told Ortega he would 
consider returning only if two conditions were met.  First, Roberto 
Rivas, the corrupt president of Nicaragua's discredited Supreme 
Electoral Council (CSE) had to be replaced.  Second, Ortega must 
guarantee transparent Presidential elections in 2011, including 
credible domestic and international observation. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Cruz expressed some reluctance to accept the post a second 
time.  He acknowledged that Nicaragua's image had suffered severe 
damage in the year since he left Washington, and that as Ambassador 
defending (or at least explaining) Ortega's increasingly 
undemocratic behavior would be substantially more difficult the 
second time around. 
 
 
 
COMMENT 
 
 
 
¶3.  (C) We find it interesting that after a year of inaction, 
Ortega has approached Cruz to reprise his performance in 
Washington.  Ortega's two previous nominees, Saul Arana, 
Nicaragua's Ambassador to Japan, and Harold Rivas, Nicaragua's 
Ambassador to Costa Rica, had serious problems.  Arana's name was 
withdrawn after he was asked to provide information about his legal 
status in the United States during the 1970s.  Rivas's nomination 
was withdrawn after less than 24 hours for unknown reasons.
