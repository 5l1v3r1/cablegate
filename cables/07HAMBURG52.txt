SUBJECT: AL QAEDA ACCOMPLICE AWAITING TRIAL IN SCHLESWIG, GERMANY 
 
HAMBURG 00000052  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: After German Police arrested Redouane El-Habhab 
July 6, 2006 at the Hamburg Dammtor train station, the Federal 
Prosecutor charged him April 25, 2007 with nine counts of 
supporting the foreign terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda and 
Al-Qaeda in Iraq as well as four counts of acting against the 
German Foreign Trade Law between August 2005 and July 2006. 
Prosecutors also charged him with founding a terrorist 
organization abroad.  Schleswig-Holstein's Higher Appellate 
Court in Schleswig has announced that the trial is scheduled to 
begin July 18, however the court's spokesperson has informed 
post that due to elevated security arrangements hearings are not 
expected to begin until July 25. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Redouane El-Habhab (37) is a dual German and Moroccan 
national.  Between 1996 and 2004 he was a student at Kiel's 
Christian Albrechts University.  Prosecutors suspect him of 
attending an explosives-making camp in Algeria in November 2005. 
 In 2006 he opened an internet cafe and call center on Iltis 
Street in Kiel's Garden District.  Federal police arrested him 
July 6, 2006 at the Hamburg Dammtor train station on a warrant 
issued by the Federal Prosecutor's Office based on incriminating 
online chat room activity German authorities had observed which 
suggested that El-Habhab was relaying news between fugitive 9/11 
planner Said Bahaji and his now former wife, who was then still 
living in Hamburg.  Law enforcement officials concluded Bahaji 
would only give this important task to a trusted Al-Qaeda member 
and therefore El-Habhab must be a member of the terrorist 
organization.  He is not accused of planning or preparing 
attacks within Germany.  Initial news reports suggested that 
El-Habhab may have had connections to the August 2006 "suitcase 
bomber" Youssuf Al Haijib, who was also a Kiel resident.  Later, 
however, police concluded there was no clear link between the 
two. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Federal Prosecutor's Office has accused El-Habhab 
of nine independent acts of supporting the foreign terrorist 
organizations Al-Qaeda and Al-Qaeda in Iraq as well as four 
counts of acting against the Foreign Trade Law between August 
2005 and July 2006.  Prosecutors also charged him with founding 
a terrorist organization abroad. 
 
Four Counts Against the Foreign Trade Law 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Prosecutor's Office asserts El-Habhab transferred 
money (5000 Euro total) on four occasions to Egypt and Syria for 
equipping "God's Fighters," financing the participation in an 
explosives training course, and paying off a smuggler.  These 
four charges are also part of the nine counts of supporting the 
terrorist activities of terrorist organization.  Furthermore, 
they broke the UN Security Council and EU embargos. 
 
Five Additional Counts of Supporting a Terrorist Organization 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
---------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Prosecutor's Office asserts that in August 2005 
El-Habhab pledged an oath of loyalty to Mullah Omar over the 
internet in which El-Habhab declared that he was ready to 
provide fighters and financial resources to the "community." 
According to the Prosecutor's Office, Osama bin Laden empowered 
Mullah Omar to accept such oaths.  El-Habhab is accused of 
supporting Al-Qaeda in Iraq in four more counts by arranging for 
Jihad Fighters from Morocco and Egypt from May through July 
¶2006.  the prosecutor states that he provided financial 
resources for transfers, provided logistical support through 
smuggling, and offered financial help, . 
 
One Count of Co- Founding a Terrorist Organization Abroad 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
--------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Federal Prosecutor's Office has also accused 
El-Habhab of co-founding a terrorist organization abroad with 
four other people in June and July of 2006.  The Prosecutor's 
Office states that the organization's goal was to build a front 
against the "Crusaders" in Sudan and to answer Osama bin Laden's 
call for holy war by committing serious criminal acts.  The 
founding members intended to divide their work, with El-Habhab 
given the responsibility to procure information, clarify 
technical options, and recruit trainers and others.   The 
Prosecutor also accuses El-Habhab of being involved in financing 
the group.  (Note: One additional founding member and a 
supporter of the organization were recently extradited from 
Sweden to stand trial in Germany.  Thaer Alhalah, a Jordanian 
national, and Moroccan Abdelali Miftah were extradited on April 
4 and May 15, respectively.  The Federal Prosecutor's Office 
 
HAMBURG 00000052  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
issued their arrest warrants based on evidence found during 
police observation of El-Habhab's internet chat sessions; 
however their investigations are independent of the El-Habhab 
case.  The prosecutor accuses Alhalah of co-founding the 
organization and Miftah is accused of assisting in its 
foundation.  End Note.) 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: Post expects the case to draw wide-spread 
public attention and, as has been seen at similar trials in 
Germany, that the court will undertake significant security 
measures.  Security concerns have already caused the court to 
delay the beginning of the trial until July 25.  END COMMENT.
