REF: STATE 13645 
 
(SBU) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Tarja 
Pesamaa, Counsellor in the Office for Arms Control, 
Disarmamant and Non-Proliferation on September 8.  Pesamaa 
welcomed our points and underscored the GOF's full support 
for UNSCR 1695, noting that the international community 
must maintain "utmost vigilance" and a very skeptical 
stance toward any exports to North Korea.  She noted also 
that in recent years there have been no applications from 
Finnish businesses seeking to export any sort of missile- 
related or dual use products to North Korea.  In 2002, 
Finland enacted "enhanced export control" legislation which 
took the unprecedented step of singling out North Korea and 
Iran for particularly stringent control, Pesamaa explained. 
Businesses have been cooperative, she added, and the GOF 
does not expect Finnish firms to seek any contact with 
North Korea.
