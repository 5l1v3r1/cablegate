Main Stories:

All front pages continue weekend coverage of Palestinian "dialogue 
for reconciliation" in Cairo.  Papers report that some dialogue 
committees have achieved progress, noting that the elections 
committee has agreed to simultaneous Palestinian Authority 
legislative, presidential, and PLO National Council elections by 
January 25, 2010.  The papers vary in their predictions of the 
parties' chances in reaching an agreement on most issues. 
 
Al Quds leads with news about the prisoners' exchange between Hamas 
and Israel.  The paper reveals that Egypt has invited Hamas Chief 
Khaled Misha'al to come to Cairo, possibly to make a final decision 
on the deal.  The report receives front page coverage in all papers, 
with Al Ayyam noting that Israeli envoys have failed to finalize the 
deal because of Israeli demands to "deport" certain Palestinian 
prisoners outside of the Palestinian Territories and release some 
West Bank prisoners to the Gaza Strip.  The paper notes that the 
Israeli cabinet has postponed a meeting to make a final decision on 
the deal until March 17. 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida run extensive front page and inside 
coverage of the March 15 opening of the Jericho training facility 
for Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces.  Al Ayyam runs half 
page inside coverage.  Reporting notes that Assistant Secretary of 
State David Johnson, along with many foreign consuls and military 
attaches listened to PA Premier Fayyad as he thanked the U.S 
Government for its support in establishing the training facility and 
noted that security is the basis for statehood and called for 
internal Palestinian unity.  Assistant Secretary of State Johnson 
remarked that the new facility is another success story of 
cooperation between the U.S. and the Palestinian Authority in the 
security sector.  He recalled other examples of Palestinian security 
sector success such as activities in Nablus, Janin and Hebron. 
 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam's front pages cover a March 15 conference in 
Jerusalem hosted by the Civic Coalition to Defend Palestinian Rights 
(Tal Quds) to highlight Israeli plans to demolish 1,700 Palestinian 
houses in Jerusalem and displace 17,000 Palestinians, according to 
reporting.  In related news, Al Ayyam's front page and inside Al 
Quds, run a report that "extremist Jews" stormed a Palestinian house 
in East Jerusalem's Yemeni neighborhood in Silwan, near the Al Aqsa 
mosque. 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida front page and Al Quds reports 
inside on comments by Palestinian Authority Presidential Spokesman 
Abu Rudaynah responding to Israeli Premier Olmert's claims that he 
has never received a serious offer from the Palestinians regarding a 
peace settlement.  Olmert is quoted by the papers accusing 
Palestinians of lacking courage. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page and an inside page of Al Quds 
reports on a "limited-circulation classified" CIA report that 
predicts the end of a Jewish-majority Israel within the next 20 
years.  The report sees diminishing chances for the two-state 
solution against growing chances of a one state solution.  The 
report also expects the return of Palestinian refugees, which it 
notes is the basis for a lasting peace.  The report also expects 
more American Jews to immigrate to Israel. 
Al Quds runs an inside report that continues front page reporting in 
all dailies of the recent meeting by British legislators with Hamas 
officials in Lebanon.  Al Quds writes that former U.S. officials are 
now urging President Obama to begin dialogue with Hamas and explore 
if Hamas is ready to renounce violence and engage in peace talks. 
Reporting highlights that an economic advisor to President Obama is 
 
JERUSALEM 00000475  002 OF 003 
 
 
among the signatories to a letter urging Obama to engage with Hamas. 
 
 
Al Ayyam's front page, also inside Al Quds, cites an AFP report 
about an open letter published by international judges and 
prosecutors calling for international investigations into human 
rights violations committed during the Gaza conflict.

WEEKEND STORIES 
--------------- 
 
Sunday, March 15 
All front pages run statements from March 13 by Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas. Abbas stressed the messages, "We want 
unity and a government that will not bring a return of the siege and 
is capable of dealing with Arabs and the world."  In regards to his 
position on a new Israeli government, Abbas said that he will 
refrain from comment until a new government is formed, but that any 
Israeli government should, "endorse the two state solution, halt 
settlement activities and remove checkpoints." 
 
Al Ayyam front pages the headline,"British Consul General: 
Demolition of houses in the occupied territory violates 
international law and casts doubts on Israel's commitment to peace." 
 British CG Makepeace said in a letter addressed to the residents of 
the East Jerusalem Al Bustan neighborhood that the demolition of 
houses in an occupied territory is a matter that directly 
contradicts article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Israel's 
obligations to the Road Map Plan. 
 
Saturday, March 14 
"Fayyad reveals the existence of a European paper for peace and 
reiterates:  The question of the [future] government is in the hands 
of the President.  I have no intention of undertaking any official 
duties in the Palestinian Authority," according to front page 
headlines in all dailies.  Fayyad noted that Palestinians want the 
European Union to be an active player in negotiations and not just a 
good donor.  According to Fayyad, "the paper conveys a European view 
to President Obama." 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam front paged reports of 9 wounded, including an 
American citizen, in the weekly protests against the Israeli 
separation barrier in the West Bank villages of Bil'in, Ni'lin, Al 
Ma'sara and Burin.  Scores of protestors also suffered from 
suffocation as a result of tear gas fired by Israeli military 
reporting noted.  The protest in Burin was against alleged Israeli 
confiscation of land, the story adds.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
 
1)  Independent daily Al Quds' editorial is titled, "Waiting for 
Agreement"(03/16):  "In these difficult circumstances, suffered by 
our people because of the occupation and all its practices, stands 
and designs, the most comforting thing to our people, and the 
strongest instrument to deal a blow to those violating our national 
rights, would come from a comprehensive [reconciliation] agreement. 
It would place us, once again, on the right path to freedom from 
occupation and establishing an independent state on our national 
soil." 
 
2) Basim Abu Sumaya comments, in official daily Al Hayat Al Jadida, 
under the title, "The taste of breakthrough"(03/16):  "The 
[Hamas]coup, division, contradictory efforts and separation [of West 
Bank and Gaza] have exhausted us.  Moreover... regional and 
 
JERUSALEM 00000475  003 OF 003 
 
 
international players, Arabs and others, have tarnished our name."
