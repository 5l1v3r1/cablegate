SUBJECT: MALDIVES WILL CO-SPONSOR HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE 
RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 188927 
 
(SBU) In an October 31 call on the Ambassador in Colombo, 
Maldivian Foreign Minister Dr. Ahmed Shaheed said that his 
government will co-sponsor the Holocaust Remembrance 
Resolution (Reftel).  Shaheed said his government had not 
responded earlier to the demarche, which was delivered on 
October 17, because of uncertainty about its ability to 
develop the education programs on the Holocaust stipulated in 
the Resolution and because it was waiting to see if other 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) nations would 
extend support.  Because of its conviction that "genocide has 
no place" in society, however, the Maldivian Government 
ultimately decided to support the resolution, regardless of 
what other OIC members do, Shaheed reported.
