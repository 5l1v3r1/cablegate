PARTNERSHIP 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: The Ambassador presented his credentials to President 
Guelleh on November 10.  In their formal remarks and informal 
post-ceremony conversation, both President Guelleh and the 
Ambassador evoked the strong U.S.-Djibouti partnership, especially 
noting USAID's successful programs in health and education, and 
Djibouti's hosting of the Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa 
(CJTF-HOA).  The Ambassador and President Guelleh also underscored 
common U.S. and Djibouti interests in combating piracy, advancing 
the Somalia peace process, and pressing for a peaceful solution to 
the Djibouti-Eritrea border standoff.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. The brief presentation ceremony featured short formal remarks 
followed by a relaxed conversation.  Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Mahamoud Ali Youssouf attended, and there was full local press 
coverage.  In his remarks, the Ambassador saluted Djibouti's 
positive contributions to regional peace and stability, and 
highlighted both the USG's recent additional food aid contributions 
in response to Djibouti's growing food insecurity, and USAID's 
ongoing successful programs in health, education, and democracy and 
good governance.  The Ambassador also thanked Djibouti for hosting 
CJTF-HOA, and reemphasized the U.S. commitment to finding a peaceful 
solution for the Djibouti-Eritrea border dispute. 
 
¶3. President Guelleh responded in formal remarks welcoming the 
Ambassador to Djibouti, and thanking the U.S. for its active 
cooperation in Djibouti's fight against poverty.  He especially 
noted USAID's work in improving rural health clinics.  On the border 
dispute, Guelleh contrasted Djibouti's commitment to regional peace 
and stability with Eritrea's "destabilizing" role in the region. 
 
¶4. During a friendly, informal post-ceremony conversation, Guelleh 
congratulated the Ambassador on the recent U.S. presidential 
elections.  Guelleh said that while he was disappointed that he 
himself had been out of the country at the time, he was glad that 
President-Elect Barack Obama had visited Djibouti briefly in 2007 
and had met with Prime Minister Deleita Mohamed Deleita.  On 
Somalia, Guelleh mentioned his participation in the recent IGAD 
summit in Nairobi, and especially urged the importance of funding 
for the proposed 10,000-strong Somali force to allow for AMISOM and 
Ethiopian withdrawal.  While expressing concern with the continued 
rash of piracy off the coast of Somalia, Guelleh seemed reasonably 
pleased with the European Union's recent anti-piracy efforts.  The 
Ambassador noted continued U.S. support for a UN PKO for Somalia to 
improve security and stability in the country. 
 
¶5. On the Djibouti-Eritrea border dispute, Guelleh reiterated 
Djibouti's commitment to finding a peaceful solution.  As he noted 
growing "pressure" both from the Djiboutian population and from the 
strain of keeping Djiboutian troops near the border, Guelleh mildly 
criticized the U.N. Security Council for "escaping decisions" and 
noted some countries' unwillingness to impose sanctions, despite 
Eritrea's continued "defiance" of the international community.  The 
Ambassador concurred that Eritrea remains a spoiler in the region 
and noted USG leadership in the Council to press for a more robust 
response.  On the economic front, Guelleh said he hoped that 
CJTF-HOA's presence at Camp Lemonier and the upcoming construction 
of the new U.S. Embassy complex would continue to offer 
opportunities to Djiboutian businesses.
