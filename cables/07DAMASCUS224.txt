¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
-------------------- 
 
"The People at the Summit" 
 
-------------------- 
 
Issam Dari, Chief Editor of government-owned Tishreen, wrote (3/7: 
"It is absolutely rejected that hostile fingers play with the 
(Arab)Summit schedule, whether directly or through mediators, so 
that decisions come out in accordance with Israeli and American 
interests, and totally contrary to the prevailing Arab current, 
which represents the interests of all Arabs, from the Gulf to the 
Atlantic Ocean. 
 
"Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni announced rudely and 
insolently, in what looks like an order for Arabs, that she wants 
the Riyadh summit to 'review the Arab Initiative, by introducing 
amendments, regarding, especially, the paragraph about the refugees' 
right to return....' 
 
"However, what makes us sad and suspicious are those calls for 
amending the Initiative to become 'more convenient for the Israeli 
interest.' 
 
There is no doubt that the 'people at the Summit' are responsible to 
 
the 'people at the Bottom.'  For whose sake are these concessions? 
And why do some of us seek to please the American master and Israel 
at the expense of Arab principles, rights and, even, existence?"

"Between Failure and the Illusion of victory " 
----------------------------------------- 
 
Ahmad Burghul, a columnist in government-owned Al-Thawra, commented 
(3/7):  "Apparently President Bush is not interested in the dilemma 
from which his troops are suffering in Iraq.  Nor is he concerned 
about the devastation that has taken place in the country, which has 
been occupied and destroyed in violation of international law... 
 
"The democratic Congress is in constant confrontation with President 
Bush, and the majority of Americans are now scared that Bush may 
push the US into a new war with Iran for the sake of Israel's 
interests.. . 
 
"President Bush managed to divide Americans about his unilateral 
policy and his decision to invade Iraq in 2003.... And now Americans 
have to face the horrible consequences of the folly of Bush, Cheney 
and Rice, who waged this aggressive war to accomplish the 
instructions of the neo-conservative snakes, who misled American and 
international public opinion, and made (people) believe that the 
unjust occupation would bring democracy for Iraqis, who are 
desperate for it."
