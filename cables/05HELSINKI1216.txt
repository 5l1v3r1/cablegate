Â¶1.  (SBU)  Finland shares USG concerns about possible 
no-action motions on important Third Committee resolutions. 
Johanna Suurpaa, MFA Director for Human Rights, told Poloff 
that the GoF was increasingly pessimistic about the 
Uzbekistan and Burma resolutions.  The Burmese regime has 
been emboldened by the slew of no-action motions this year 
and is pushing Asian countries to support a similar motion. 
At the least, even if a no-action motion is defeated, the 
Burmese resolution might not be a consensus resolution as it 
has been in the past.  Suurpaa said that the situation may be 
better for the Iran and Turkmenistan resolutions given last 
year's healthy passage margins, but the vote will still be 
close.  Finland is playing a leading role in lobbying hard 
against no-action motions, but has less proactive support 
than it would like.  Suurpaa said that the GoF was encouraged 
by U.S. lobbying efforts and hopes such efforts continue 
right up until votes are taken.  The successful passage of 
the North Korea resolution validated this approach.
