INFORMATION SHARING ON IRAN 
 
Ref: (A)STATE 69315 (B)STATE 47004 (C)STATE 39585 
(D)STATE 69283 
 
(SBU) On May 22, we delivered points (Refs A, B, C, and 
D) to Kadri Jogi (MFA Acting Division Director for 
Africa, the Near East, the Middle East and Latin 
America), Riho Kruuv (MFA Division Director for 
Strategic Goods Control), and Tuuli Parnsalu (Strategic 
Goods Desk Officer) and discussed (1) the U.S. proposal 
at the NSG (Nuclear Suppliers Group) plenary to share 
Iran export denial information; and (2) the U.S. 
invitations to discuss the most effective implementation 
of UNSCR (United Nations Security Council Resolutions) 
1737 and 1747 at an open-ended seminar.  Parnsalu 
informed us that Estonia has no information to be shared 
at the moment in regards to exports to Iran and the GOE 
does not plan to send a representative in June to 
participate in the U.S. hosted open-ended seminar in 
Vienna.  On UNSCR 1737 and 1747, Parnsalu again assured 
us that Estonia fully supported the U.S. initiatives.
