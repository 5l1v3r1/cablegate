Energy Conference Invitation (WIREC) 
 
REF: STATE 00138428 
 
¶1. This is an Action request.  See paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. There was a Turkish Holiday in mid-October that delayed the 
Turkish Government's response to the invitation to the WIREC 
Conference.  The MFA informed us October 16 that the GOT would like 
to participate in the conference, and has one confirmed participant, 
but needs more time to put together a full list of participants. 
The GOT requests an extension of the October 16 deadline to submit a 
participant list to the Department. 
 
¶3.  Action request: Embassy Ankara requests the Department let us 
know what is the final date that Turkey has to present its 
participants for WIREC participation.
