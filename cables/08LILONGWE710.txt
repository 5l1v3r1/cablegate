¶1. (SBU) Summary: Emboffs met with principal secretaries at 
the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) to discuss reftel points regarding Somalia.  PS Livuza 
from the MFA indicated that Malawi would support a resolution 
authorizing a UN peacekeeping operation in Somalia as long as 
adequate efforts are made to resolve political problems as 
well.  PS Kachimera at the MoD was tempted by the offer of 
equipment support, but noted there was no currently no peace 
to keep in Somalia.  He said the Malawi Defense Force (MDF) 
would prefer to deploy to a United Nations mission (MONUC, 
MINURCAT, or UNAMID) instead.  Livuza echoed this sentiment, 
but did say Malawi might send police to Somalia if the 
security situation improved.  Comment: The US equipment offer 
is prompting a new discussion about a Somalia deployment 
within the GOM, but Malawi is unlikely to volunteer troops in 
the near term.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 11, Charge met with MFA Principal 
Secretary Anthony Livuza regarding ref A demarche.  Livuza 
said Malawi would support a resolution authorizing a UN 
peacekeeping operation in Somalia if adequate attention were 
also given to solving political problems and strengthening 
Somalia's governing institutions.  Though he characterized 
the operating environment in Somalia as particularly 
challenging, Livuza said there was a possibility Malawi could 
one day deploy there, but likely only under a UN mandate, 
with adequate equipment, and (he implied) after other 
peacekeepers had established basic security conditions. 
Livuza also said Malawi would potentially be interested in 
sending police to Somalia. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Emboff discussed ref B points with MoD Principal 
Secretary Patrick Kachimera.  Kachimera said Malawi told the 
AU team that it did not have enough equipment to deploy to 
Somalia.  When emboff reiterated that the U.S. could provide 
equipment support if that was Malawi's only obstacle, 
Kachimera quickly replied that Malawi would prefer to deploy 
to one of the other UN missions in Africa (MONUC, MINURCAT, 
or UNAMID) instead.  Kachimera added that the GOM is 
committed to participating in peacekeeping missions, but 
believes there is no peace to keep in Somalia. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Kachimera seemed momentarily tempted by the 
prospect of equipment support and other deployment 
assistance.  The USG offer appears to be prompting a new 
Somalia discussion within the GOM; a decision to volunteer 
for Somalia would need President Mutharika's approval.  The 
President will likely listen to Malawi Defense Force 
leadership who show no signs of supporting a Somalia 
deployment, probably due to concerns that the MDF does not 
yet have the requisite experience under fire to confront a 
challenge of that magnitude.  End Comment.
