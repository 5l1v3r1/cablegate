¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche concerning 
Venezuela's bid to chair the OAS working group on the social 
charter, to Leonard Beaulne, Deputy Director of the 
Inter-American Affairs Division at Foreign Affairs Canada 
(FAC), on February 18.  Beaulne relayed that FAC was also 
tracking this issue closely, and that the Government of 
Canada shares our misgivings on the Venezuelan draft, which 
Beaulne called unacceptable.  He had heard that El Salvador 
may present an alternative proposal, drawing from a variety 
of other sources, and inquired if the U.S. had tabled a 
document as well. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Beaulne indicated that Ambassador Durand was 
already in transit back to Washington.  A copy of the 
demarche has been forwarded by FAC to their OAS Mission in 
Washington, so that it would be available for their review 
prior to the February 23rd visit to the OAS by Venezuela 
Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez.
