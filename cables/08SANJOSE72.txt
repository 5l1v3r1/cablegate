¶1. (SBU) On January 29, we delivered the "nil" form to MFA 
Carlos Cordero Madrigal, Director of the Disarmament, 
Terrorism, and Organized Crime Section of the MFA, as Costa 
Rica does not have a space launch vehicle/ballistic missile 
program. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cordero told us the GOCR would submit the HCOC AD by 
March 31, as it has done in the past.
