SUBJECT: FACEBOOK MLK DAY OUTREACH PROVES THE TWO-FOLD VALUE OF 
SOCIAL MEDIA 
 
REF: JAKARTA 65 
 
¶1. SUMMARY:  Consulate Surabaya's official Facebook page 
launched its "I have a dream~" outreach in celebration of Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Day.  Indonesia is the seventh largest 
Facebook-using country and one of the fastest-growing in the 
world.  The Surabaya Facebook MLK posts received over 10,000 
hits within a couple days.  More than 150 "fans" participated 
directly in the outreach by posting their dreams for Indonesia. 
This outreach not only allowed "fans" to learn about American 
culture, history, and society, but enabled Mission Indonesia to 
hear from the Indonesian public about what is important to them. 
 This two-way dialogue fosters mutual understanding, reaches a 
specific Indonesian target audience, and exponentially increases 
the number of interactions between U.S. Government personnel and 
the Indonesian populace.  END SUMMARY 
 
A LESSON IN U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS 
¶2. Consulate General Surabaya's Facebook page has attracted 
nearly 17,000 "fans" since its official launch on October 1, 
¶2009.  In January, we launched the "I have a dream~" campaign to 
promote awareness about Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and civil 
rights in the U.S.  We posted a note containing the text of 
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech.  Then we 
asked our fans to post their dreams for Indonesia.  Every fan 
who posted their "dream" for Indonesia was entered into a 
contest to win a prize pack which included a Martin Luther King, 
Jr. biography, President Obama's "The Audacity of Hope" book 
translated into Indonesian, and other prizes. 
 
UTILIZING FACEBOOK FOR SOCIAL CHANGE 
 
¶3. Indonesia has the seventh largest number of people using 
Facebook in the world, with approximately 12 million users. 
This number only continues to climb, as Indonesia is ranked 
second in the world for the highest 12-month growth.  Facebook 
is being used in Indonesia as a tool for social protest, freedom 
of speech, and to connect people across this nation of islands 
(Reftel).  Now through the use of Facebook for Mission-wide 
outreach, we can expand beyond the normal limitations of time 
and space, and on a limited budget, reach thousands more people 
(primarily youth audiences) through "owned" social media 
platforms. Facebook pages give the unique ability to reach out 
and educate Indonesians about American culture and history and 
then hear the reactions and how Indonesians apply these ideas to 
their own country and situation, within defined parameters. 
 
WHAT INDONESIANS WANT 
 
¶4. After only a couple of days, the Facebook posts about Martin 
Luther King, Jr. had more than 10,000 hits and received 150 
responses to the question "What is your dream for Indonesia?" 
The posts of Indonesian "fans' were thoughtful and most 
resonated with the same themes.  Indonesians want to "stop 
corruption and personal interests from the lowest officials up 
to the highest parts of government."  They want a "clean, fair 
justice system with honest officials."  There is a deep desire 
for "religious harmony and respect" and to "stop terrorism."  On 
the economic front they want "development to come to all parts 
of the country" and to "reduce unemployment."  They feel a 
desire to be seen as a country like China or Brazil in regards 
to development and to be a donor country rather than a 
"receiver".  The strongest and most prominent "dream" is to 
eliminate corruption and nepotism.  They also express doubt, as 
some said these are just dreams and will never become reality. 
Others show a lack of hope that things like corruption, 
especially, can ever really change. 
 
THE VALUE OF LENDING AN EAR 
 
¶5.  By using the virtual gathering-place that is Facebook, we 
can demonstrate that we are interested in what "regular" 
Indonesians think.  We do not censor posts or comments, except 
if they violate Facebook's policies.  People feel free to 
express their opinions directly to us, and believe that their 
voice is heard by the U.S. Government.  While it is impossible 
for USG employees to reach every part of Indonesia, through 
social media we are now thousands of places at once, forming 
interactive and direct online communities throughout Indonesia. 
This has value and fosters mutual understanding between the U.S. 
Government and regular Indonesian citizens.  Mission Facebook 
pages are portals to exponentially increase our people-to-people 
connections through a virtual meeting space.  They give us 
un-matched opportunities to not just reach out and educate or 
explain, but more importantly to listen.
