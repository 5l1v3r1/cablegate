Dear Mr./Madam President/Prime Minister, 
 
I would like to invite you to a working luncheon meeting 
with your colleagues from across Sub-Saharan Africa in 
New York on September 22, 2009, from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 
p.m. 
 
I am encouraged by Africa?s progress in recent years to 
close the development gap and increase opportunity. More 
work, however, remains to be done.  I hope you will join 
this lunch meeting for a dialogue on how we can build a 
21st century partnership that will lead to increased 
economic and social development for the people of 
Africa.  This expanding partnership needs to work in 
both directions, and I am interested in hearing your 
ideas about how our mutual efforts can be more 
effective.  I would also like to hear about your work to 
create the kind of long-lasting development effects that 
we all desire. 
 
My team will be in touch with your U.N. delegation with 
details on the venue and agenda in the weeks ahead. 
 
I hope you will be able to attend, and I look forward to 
our discussions in New York. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Barack Obama 
 
¶9.  (U) Posts may draw from the information below as 
necessary: 
 
-- This event will focus on how the United States can 
strengthen partnership with African countries to improve 
economic and social conditions on the continent.  The 
President wants to hear about leaders? efforts to create 
opportunity and introduce lasting positive change into 
their countries.  President Obama would like to discuss 
three areas in particular: job creation, especially for 
young people and entrepreneurs; how to create a 
favorable climate for trade and investment; and, how we 
can mobilize African agriculture to create jobs and feed 
the continent. 
 
-- Not all sub-Saharan African heads of state have been 
invited.  We have declined to invite the heads of state 
of Zimbabwe, Sudan, Madagascar, Eritrea, Niger, and 
Guinea.  Other sub-Saharan African heads of state will 
receive invitations, as will the Chairman of the 
Commission of the African Union, Jean Ping, and TFG 
President Sheikh Sharif. 
 
-- President Obama will make brief opening remarks, and 
ask a head of state (to be determined) to begin the 
discussion on each of the three topics.  Following the 
intervention of the designated African head of 
state/government, President Obama will moderate a 
discussion on that topic.  Invitees should not prepare 
formal interventions; we intend for discussion to be 
spontaneous and succinct. 
 
-- Unfortunately, substitutes will not be accepted for 
this unique high-level event. 
 
-- We will provide exact information on the venue, which 
will be in midtown Manhattan, at a later date.
