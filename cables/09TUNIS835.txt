¶1.  Embassy Tunis conducted a validation study covering all 
non-diplomatic non-immigrant visas (NIV) for the month of April 
2009, excluding K visas.  This time period was selected as it was 
the first complete month of visa operations after returning Libyan 
NIV applicants to Embassy Tripoli. 
 
¶2.  During this period, 246 non-immigrant visas were issued.  Of 
these visas, 90.6 percent were B1/B2 visas.  Other categories issued 
during this time included F1 (4 percent), J1 (3.6 percent), J2 (0.4 
percent), H4 (0.4 percent), O3 (0.4 percent), and C1/D (0.4 
percent). Tunisian applicants comprised 85.7 percent of issued 
visas.  No other single nationality represented a significant 
percentage of issuances.  Most third country issuances were to 
applicants from African countries, usually linked to African 
Development Bank staff and their families. 
 
¶3.  The validation study found that 99.6 percent of visa recipients 
were in status.  The majority of checks were performed using the 
Department of Homeland Security's Arrival and Departure Information 
System (ADIS).  In cases where arrival and/or departure information 
was not available, Embassy Tunis consular staff contacted travelers 
to inquire about their status.  It was not possible to contact one 
applicant, who is reported to be living in a third country; this 
applicant represents the 0.4 percent of travelers who were not 
verified to be in status. 
 
¶4. When contacted, 63 applicants who were issued visas (25.6 percent 
of total issuances) said that they did not travel.  Of these, the 
majority cited concerns about H1N1.  A number of applicants who are 
medical professionals noted that the Tunisian Ministry of Health had 
explicitly ordered them to remain in Tunisia during April, as 
concerns about H1N1 spread were increasing. 
 
¶5. Embassy Tunis' overall issuance rate - net of administrative 
refusals - was 80.1 percent for the same time period.  Embassy Tunis 
will continue to ensure that qualified travelers are issued visas in 
a timely manner, while guarding against the possibility of fraud.
