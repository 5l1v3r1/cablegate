¶1. (SBU) Summary: CA/FPP and the Cairo Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) 
have been reviewing visa and PIERS records in an effort to identify 
additional cases of the baby trafficking network described in 
reftels. Through an analysis of PIERS records, a Fraud Prevention 
Officer (FPO) at CA/FPP linked and identified a Coptic priest who 
had successfully smuggled newborn twins from Egypt to the United 
States for purposes of adoption.  A further review of PIERS records 
by the Cairo Fraud Prevention Manager (FPM) subsequently linked and 
identified another Coptic priest who had successfully smuggled one 
newborn child from Egypt to the United States also for the purpose 
of adoption. End Summary. 
 
 
 
Working the systems 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The FPO at CA/FPP searched PIERS records looking for 
applications of young, Egyptian born, naturalized Americans.  On the 
passport applications in 2004 of two four year old twins, 
handwritten notes described an adoption in North Carolina and name 
changes. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) yielded the 
original B1/2 visa applications of these twins in 2000 when they 
applied as newborns and forming part of the family of a Coptic 
priest and his wife. In addition, TECS showed that the future 
adoptive mother, an Egyptian-American, departed the United States 
for Egypt approximately one month before the visas were issued and 
returned on the same flight with the Coptic priest and his "family." 
 Finally, DHS systems confirmed that the priest remained in the 
United States obtained a naturalization certificate and applied for 
a U.S. passport. His wife, however, returned to Egypt. 
 
Filling in the Blanks 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. With the above information, Cairo FPU checked with contacts at 
the Egyptian Civil Affairs Agency (CAA). They confirmed that the 
twins of the priest had never been registered as his biological 
children. Furthermore, they confirmed that the birth certificates he 
presented to obtain Egyptian passports were entirely fraudulent. FPU 
contacted the wife of the priest residing in Cairo who initially 
denied she ever had twins.  However, confronted with the evidence, 
the wife admitted that her husband had fraudulently obtained birth 
certificates for two newborn twins born out of wedlock. They applied 
for visas posing as a family and upon arrival in the United States, 
handed the babies to the future adoptive father waiting at the 
airport. According to her, the entire fraud was organized by her 
husband and she has never seen the babies again. 
 
Second Case 
----------- 
 
¶4. In the second case identified by the FPM at post, a 2003 U.S. 
passport application for an Egyptian born, eight year old boy showed 
handwritten notes indicating an adoption and name change. NIV 
records indicated that the boy had originally applied as a nine 
month old baby in 1996. He formed part of a family of a Coptic 
priest and his wife who applied for B1/2 visas.  Checks with CAA 
confirmed that the baby had never been registered as the biological 
child of the couple. However, the couple had registered three girls 
as their biological children.  CCD records further indicated that 
the priest, his wife and three girls had subsequently applied for 
and received R visas on two separate occasions. However, during 
their last and third interview in 2004, the couple applied only with 
one girl and was refused. The case notes from the officer stated 
that the priest appeared to be "deliberately attempting to obscure 
the reason for his trip." 
 
Challenges and Comment 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. The above cases are extremely difficult and time consuming to 
identify due to the name changes involved and the limited search 
capability of PIERS which lacks options such as Text Search and 
Facial Recognition on Demand. However, with the assistance of 
CA/FPP, post will continue to review visa and passport records in an 
effort to identify more cases and further develop profiles of this 
baby trafficking ring in order to assist interviewing officers. In 
addition, CA/FPP and the FPM are working with the A/RSO-I and 
Diplomatic Security to further investigate these cases and other
