SUBJECT: COMPROMISE AFGHAN MOTION SETS END DATE IN 2011 
 
REF: Ottawa 0221 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: In a new compromise motion, PM Harper acceded to 
the Liberals' call for a firm end date to the Afghan mission of 
Canadian Forces in Kandahar, with pull-outs beginning in July 2011 
and ending by December 2011.  The new language apparently draws 
heavily from the Liberals' amendments to the government's original 
motion (reftel), and may placate the opposition into supporting the 
motion or letting it pass when it comes to a vote in March.  End 
Summary. 
 
Olive branch to the Liberals 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
¶2.  (U) In a well publicized speech to Canadian Conference of 
Defence Associations Institute on February 21 (with CENTCOM 
Commander Admiral Fallon in attendance), Prime Minister Stephen 
Harper described a revised motion that the government would 
introduce later that day in the House of Commons on the future of 
the Canadian Forces in Kandahar province of Afghanistan.  He 
emphasized that the government's move sought to achieve a 
"bi-partisan consensus," building on the recommendations of the 
Manley Panel, and highlighted "fundamental common ground between the 
Government and the Official Opposition, particularly agreement that 
the mission should continue until 2011 and that operational 
decisions should be left to Canadian commanders on the ground in 
Afghanistan."  He explicitly admitted that the new motion 
incorporated "large elements" of the Liberals' amendments.  He 
insisted that NATO partners must nonetheless still find 1,000 more 
troops to support Canadian Forces in Kandahar, but made no reference 
to helicopters, UAVs, or other requirements. 
 
¶3.  (U) PM Harper explained that Canada now planned to notify NATO 
that in July 2011 its military deployments will begin to leave 
Kandahar, with the final pull-outs by December 2011.  He insisted 
that a firm end date for the mission was neither a Liberal nor 
Conservative but rather a "Canadian" position.  He confirmed that 
the government intends to hold a vote in the Commons on this motion 
before the NATO summit in April.  PM Harper argued that Canada is 
making a "real and positive difference" in Afghanistan and 
emphasized an "unbreakable link" among security, development, and 
aid. 
 
¶4.  (U) PM Harper emphasized that, with its role in Afghanistan, 
Canada was honoring its tradition as a reliable and resolute ally in 
the quest for global security.   Highlighting Canadian contributions 
in World Wars I and II, Korea as well as numerous peacekeeping 
operations, he emphasized that "the reality of our world" was the 
need for "peace enforcement missions" under UN Security Council 
Chapter VII authorizations, such as in Afghanistan.  He noted that 
"all Canadians" were proud of Canada as a force for "positive 
change" in the world, and insisted that Canada would always be ready 
to take up arms to defend its interests and values.  He lamented 
that Canada had not always maintained the capacity to meet such 
security challenges, but described how his government had undertaken 
a major program to "build a first class modern military and keep it 
that way," which he said was "a duty we owe to our troops."  Saying 
that Canada should be a world leader, not a follower, he asserted 
that Canada needs a credible military to be a "serious player" in 
the world.  He laid out the government's commitment to raise the 
the world.  He laid out the government's commitment to raise the 
automatic annual increase in defense spending from 1.5 per cent to 2 
per cent, beginning in 2011-12. 
 
Debate to begin on February 25 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) The government will table the text of the revised motion 
later on February 21 (although Parliament remains on recess) and 
will begin debate in the Commons when it resumes on February 25. 
Journalists who have seen the revised text said it followed the 
wording of the Liberals' amendment almost verbatim. With debates and 
votes on the budget coming first in early March, and an expected 
spring recess March 15-30, the next likely date for a vote on this 
motion is March 31. 
 
Comment 
------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Conservatives have moved significantly toward the 
Liberals' position, particularly on the question of a fixed end date 
for the Afghan mission.  It will be all but impossible for the 
Liberals to refuse to support the motion, despite the slightly 
longer timeframe (the Liberals had wanted the pull-out to begin in 
February 2011 and to finish by July 2011) and failure to resolve 
differences in how to handle Afghan detainees in light of 
allegations of torture by Afghan authorities.  The Conservatives 
likely still have a few surprises up their sleeves to sweeten the 
deal, probably an announcement before the vote on success in 
procuring helicopters and UAVs, and -- the government very much 
hopes -- on new commitments by NATO partners on additional troops.
