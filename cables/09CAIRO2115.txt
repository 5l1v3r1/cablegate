SUBJECT:  CAIRO - A2 VISA VALIDATION STUDY 
 
¶1.  In response to concerns raised by other agencies 
regarding the possible overstay and/or abuse of A2 visas by Egyptian 
Ministry of Defense (MOD)personnel, the Fraud Prevention Unit 
(FPU)conducted a validation study. The FPU reviewed all issued A2 
visas for the Egyptian MOD from 01 Jan 2008 to 31 December 2008, a 
total of 422 visas. 
 
¶2.  Using the Department of Homeland Security's Arrival 
Departure Information System (ADIS) and the assistance of the 
A/RSO-I and DS/CR/VPA, the FPU identified 14 individuals with no 
records of departure from the United States. The results were then 
cross-checked with Egyptian immigration records for arrival and 
departure. All except two A2 visa holders returned to Egypt after 
their respective training programs were finished. 
 
¶3. With only a .47 percent confirmed overstay rate, the FPU 
could not confirm any evidence of fraud for A2 visas issued for the 
Egyptian Ministry of Defense.
