SUBJECT: TURKISH PARLIAMENT APPROVES SENDING FRIGATE TO THE 
GULF OF ADEN 
 
REF: A. 08 ANKARA 2184 
     ¶B. 08 STATE 133199 
 
¶1. The Turkish Parliament approved February 10 a motion 
authorizing the government to send naval forces to the Gulf 
of  Aden to protect commercial vessels from pirates. The 
Turkish Naval Forces frigate Giresun (ex USS Flatley, an 
Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate) will reportedly depart 
February 17 to join Joint Task Force 151. The petition 
specified that the frigate is expected to operate in the Gulf 
of Aden, including Somali territorial waters, for one year. 
 
¶2. The petition, submitted by the Prime Minister, noted that 
three Turkish ships had been captured and 37 Turkish sailors 
taken hostage, and called the current environment a threat to 
Turkish commercial interests and to Turkish citizens. (Note: 
None of these vessels remain in captivity; press reports 
suggest that their owners paid ransom for their release. End 
note.) The frigate will join Task Force 151 to participate in 
operations against pirates as authorized in UNSCR 1851. 
According to the petition, its duties will be to conduct 
surveillance, boarding of ships, escort duties for commercial 
vessels, aid of vessels under attack by pirates, and capture, 
interrogate, and detain pirates as required. The petition 
also states that Turkish Naval Forces will not be tasked to 
serve on Somali territory nor participate in any ground 
operations against the pirates. 
 
¶3. All parties in Parliament voted for the petition except 
the Democratic Society Party (DTP).
