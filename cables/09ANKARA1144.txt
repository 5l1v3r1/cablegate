SUBJECT: TURKISH MEDIA REACTION 
FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 2009 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
A New Era With Russia 
The main feature story in all Turkish media outlets today is 
yesterday's meeting between PM Erdogan and Russian PM Putin, during 
which Turkey agreed to allow Russia to build part of the South 
Stream natural gas pipeline through Turkish territorial waters in 
the Black Sea.  Mainstream pro-government Sabah headlines, "The 
Agreement of The Century," as "Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin both established a global 
energy bridge and clamped together the fates of Turkey and Russia," 
and, "A new dimension has been added to Ankara-Moscow relations - 
intergovernmental cooperation."  Islamist-oriented pro-government 
Zaman reports, "These signatures deepened Ankara-Moscow relations." 
Mainstream Hurriyet notes, "Important steps have been taken in 
energy cooperation. Turkey said "yes" to the request of Russia to 
ship natural gas to Europe through pipelines under the Black Sea by 
bypassing Ukraine."  In "New Era With The Kremlin," mainstream Vatan 
reports, "Huge energy projects, which will change the course of 
Turkey-Russia relations, were signed. Turkey gave a green light to 
Russia to use the  Black Sea for its natural gas pipeline project 
South Stream. Until yesterday, Ankara would not join South Stream 
due to concerns it would compete with the Nabucco project." 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet comments, "Erdogan defined the 
Nabucco and South Stream projects as alternatives to each other, 
while Russian Premier Vladimir Putin said that the two projects were 
'rivals.'"  And thus, mainstream Haberturk headlines, "Putin Won." 
Islamist-oriented pro-government Yeni Safak headlines, "The Photo 
That Makes The World Jealous," next to a photo of the Turkish, 
Russian, and Italian prime ministers.  Liberal Radikal reports, "The 
Turco-Russian energy partnership has been strengthened with the 
signing of 12 separate agreements and protocols," and "Ankara signed 
eight other agreements for Turco-Russian-Italian partnership."  In 
"A Nuclear Plant In Exchange for Petrol," Radikal comments, "At the 
summit Russia promised to give oil for the Samsun-Ceyhan pipeline 
project, and Turkey awarded a Russian company the contract to 
construct a nuclear power plant without holding a tender." 
 
Editorial opinion on Turkey-Russia Energy Partnership 
 
Ibrahim Karagul wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "Turkey and 
Russia are closer now than at any other time during our 500 years of 
diplomatic history.  The recent projects with Russia contain 
political, strategic and global importance along with economic 
benefits.  The whole thing makes Turkey a key country in both the 
Islamic world and in the Caucasus.  There is no doubt there will be 
efforts underway to sabotage this valuable partnership between 
Russia and Turkey." 
 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "The deals with Russia have 
made Turkey an international actor on energy where Turkey can play 
its energy card in a global scheme.  There are however some 
inconsistencies and contradictions.  Turkey has become one of the 
Nabucco partners yet at the same time, committed itself to South 
Stream which is known as an alternate project to Nabucco.  This is 
something worth observing" 
 
Erdal Safak wrote in mainstream Sabah: "The partnership with Russia 
goes beyond economic nature and contains a strong strategic 
component as well.  This strategic partnership will most likely be 
seen in the Nagorno Karabakh problem.  There are strong speculations 
about the establishment of a peace keeping mission to N. Karabakh 
composed of Turkish and Russian soldiers.  If that happens, the 
partnership will be crowned." 
 
 
Baykal Reiterates his Criticism for Erdogan-Turk Meeting 
Mainstream Vatan reports that the main opposition party CHP leader 
Deniz Baykal reiterated yesterday his criticism regarding the 
meeting between PM Erdogan and pro-Kurdish party DTP leader Ahmet 
Turk.  Baykal said the government is "bargaining with terrorists 
 
ANKARA 00001144  002 OF 003 
 
 
while keeping secret its plan for the Kurdish issue."  Liberal 
Radikal gives front page coverage to the words of DTP leader Ahmet 
Turk saying that "I miss the old Baykal who had visited me in 
Diyarbakir in 1983 when I was discharged from prison.  At that 
meeting I shared all the problems I faced in Diyarbakir prison with 
Baykal and Baykal vowed to take legal action against those 
responsible for the troubles in prison if he wins a seat in 
parliament one day."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports that 
Ahmet Turk described his meeting with Erdogan as "a historical 
opportunity" and added that "the MHP, which chooses politics over 
Turkish nationalism, is not at a different point.  Mr.Bahceli is the 
biggest chance in the solution process.  He prevented problems from 
occurring in the streets in the past." 
 
U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Meets With DTP 
Mainstream Vatan, Kanal D, CNN Turk:  Vatan reports that "support 
for the AKP government's Kurdish initiative came from the U.S. 
during "a meeting with DTP members at a restaurant in Ankara last 
night."  Ambassador Jeffrey did not/not speak to press, but Vatan 
claims he said, "At the moment there is a healthy atmosphere 
regarding ways to find a solution to the Kurdish issue.  Erdogan's 
meeting with DTP Leader Ahmet Turk was very important.  Everyone 
should also support this process."  Co-chair of DTP Emine Ayna said 
"This dinner appointment is a follow up to the DTP's dinner with EU 
Ambassadors and it was previously scheduled."  The papers and TV 
channels note that Ambassador Jeffrey met with the main opposition 
party CHP leader Deniz Baykal the other day.  Meanwhile, NTV reports 
the DTP will open a representative office in the U.S. in October and 
the representative will be Nazmi Gur. 
 
Two PKK Members Killed in Kato Mountains 
Mainstreams Sabah, Milliyet and Vatan report that a clash erupted 
between security forces and PKK terrorists who were found with 
thermal cameras at Kato mountain between Sirnak and Hakkari.  Two 
PKK terrorists, including one female, were killed in the clash. 
Operations continue in the region to capture the rest of the 
terrorists. 
 
Blackwater Crusaders 
Islamist-oriented pro-government papers Zaman and Yeni Safak, as 
well as liberal Radikal, highlight the latest allegations regarding 
the Blackwater Security firm.  Zaman headlines, "Blackwater Worked 
In Iraq Under A Crusader Mentality."  Yeni Safak notes two of the 
company's former employee's claim Blackwater acted as if they were 
on a "Crusader mission" in Iraq to "wipe out Muslims and the 
religion of Islam."  Reports in these newspapers also mentioned that 
Blackwater had a notorious record of arms smuggling and 
intentionally killing civilians.  Leftist Taraf headlines, "(They) 
Shot Iraqis For Fun."
