¶1. Summary: Post engaged local Thai audiences in a variety 
of ways to counter any possible misperceptions, 
inaccuracies and misinformation regarding U.S. relief 
efforts for Haiti.  The centerpiece of the outreach was a 
roundtable for Thai journalists held by the Ambassador on 
Thursday, January 21.  His statements received widespread 
positive coverage and, taken together with other PA-led 
activities, helped to ensure that the Thai public fully 
understands the intentions and role of the U.S. government 
in assisting with humanitarian relief for Haiti. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  Comment: Thai public interest in the Haiti disaster 
has been strong, as evident by the lead coverage and front 
page headlines the story has received across both print 
and broadcast news outlets.  Although most criticism in 
the Thai media has focused on the "paltry" initial 
response from the Thai government, Post decided to 
proactively engage opinion-makers to head-off any 
misinformation and/or mischaracterizations of our 
commitment to assist the Haitian people and government in 
recovering from this disaster.  End comment. 
 
¶3.  On January 21, Ambassador John hosted a media 
roundtable for Thai journalists that included five major 
Thai print dailies (The Nation, Bangkok Post, Daily News, 
Kao Sot, and Naew Na) and two leading national 
broadcasters (Channels 3 and 7).  During the one-hour 
media interaction, the Ambassador discussed U.S. efforts 
to assist Haiti, but also emphasized that this was a 
collaborative, international effort lead by the GOH and 
UN.  He also stressed that the U.S. is committed to the 
long-term, sustained effort to rebuild Haiti and applauded 
the RTG and the people of Thailand for their readiness to 
assist as well.  After the roundtable, the Ambassador 
conducted an on camera, stand-up interview with national 
broadcasters Channels 3 and 7.  Questions focused on two 
main themes: "Can you tell us more about long term aid to 
Haiti?" and "How are you working with the RTG?" 
 
¶4.  The Ambassador's interview with Channel 3 aired a few 
hours later during a special segment on the Haiti disaster 
featured during its late afternoon news program, while 
Channel 7 carried the interview with the Ambassador in its 
evening news broadcast (estimated combined peak 
viewership: 13 million).  The January 22 morning edition 
of the Daily News (estimated circulation: 500,000) ran 
extensive coverage of the Ambassador's remarks from the 
roundtable.  Several local Thai dailies carried the 
Ambassador's comments from the roundtable in their online 
editions. 
 
¶5.  PA also has actively engaged local media and the 
public in an effort to forestall potential 
misunderstanding and/or inaccurate reports about U.S. 
activities in Haiti.  On January 21, PAO, IO, and AIO met 
with senior editors and foreign news writers from 
Thailand's most widely read newspaper, Thai Rath 
(estimated circulation: 1 million), and had a cordial 
discussion about a range of issues, including America's 
role in the Haiti relief effort.  Two days earlier, the 
Ambassador hosted a large reception at his residence and 
paid tribute to Thai and U.S. efforts to relieve suffering 
in Haiti; in the audience were many high-level contacts 
and members of the media.  On January 19, IO met with his 
European Union counterpart to compare notes on media 
coverage of the crisis and to ascertain points of mutual 
interest. 
 
¶6.  In an effort to reach an even broader audience, over 
the last week PA's Information Resource Center (IRC) has 
kept the Embassy website updated with the latest 
information on U.S. relief efforts, as well as prominently 
featured the "Help for Haiti" badge with a link to 
information on how the public can donate to cause.  In 
addition, the IRC sent multiple Tweets on a range of Haiti 
relief topics from the role that U.S. search and rescue 
teams play on the ground to announcing the arrival of the 
USNS Comfort in Haiti.  Many of these Tweets have been re- 
Tweeted and shared on several hundred Facebook pages.  For 
example, our January 15 Tweet on where to donate money to 
the relief effort was re-Tweeted 101 times and had racked 
up 774 Facebook shares.  All in all, Post's series of 
Haiti Tweets have been shared a total of 1,022 times on 
Facebook.
