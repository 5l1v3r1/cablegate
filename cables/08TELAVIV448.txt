¶2.  Islamic Extremism

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha'aretz's web site quoted PM Ehud Olmert as saying today before a 
business conference in Tokyo that he is not certain that Israel and 
the PA will be able to reach a peace agreement by the end of 2008, 
as they committed themselves to doing in the Annapolis conference. 
"We have a desire to reach an agreement within the year 2008," 
Olmert was quoted as saying.  "I am not sure we will make it, but we 
are determined to make a giant step forward to end this dispute once 
and for all," he added. 
 
All media reported that on Monday rocket fragments injured three 
Sderot residents, including a 10-year-old Sderot boy who was hurt in 
the shoulder.  The media reported that rocket fire on Israel started 
shortly after the Palestinian demonstration south of the Erez 
crossing died out.  The media generally reported that the 
demonstration was a PR exercise that is bound to repeat itself 
perhaps more seriously. 
 
Yediot reported that despite Defense Ministry statements to the 
contrary, Israel has resumed the supply of electricity to Gaza. 
 
The Jerusalem Post, Makor Rishon-Hatzofe, and other media reported 
that on Monday senior members of Kadima and the government coalition 
(including Rafi Eitan of the Pensioners Party, the cabinet minister 
in charge of Jerusalem affairs) expressed their opposition to making 
concessions in Jerusalem.  The Jerusalem Post reported that on 
Monday a group of right-wing legislators charged PM Olmert with 
freezing construction in Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem as a 
result of the peace negotiations with the Palestinians.  Maariv 
quoted a senior official in the bureau of Communications Minister 
Ariel Attias of Shas as saying that Shas will not quit the 
government coalition even if Israel returns the Western Wall. 
Maariv, which reported that the official later denied having made 
the comments, noted that such statements and allegations reflect an 
internal struggle within Shas. 
 
Yediot quoted Vice PM Haim Ramon as saying that the total freeze of 
construction in the settlements will be partially lifted within one 
or two months.  The Jerusalem Post quoted Ramon as saying that not a 
single outpost has been established in the West Bank since 2005. 
 
The Jerusalem Post and Makor Rishon-Hatzofe quoted Democratic 
presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama as saying on Sunday in a 
closed-door meeting with several members of Cleveland's Jewish 
community: I think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community 
that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to 
Israel, then you're anti-Israel, and that can't be the measure of 
our friendship with Israel."  The Jerusalem Post reported that on 
Sunday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," independent presidential 
candidate Ralph Nader attacked Obama for allegedly concealing his 
"pro-Palestinian" feelings. 
 
Ha'aretz cited a report that the children of Israeli emigrants are 
detaching themselves from Israel. 
 
Leading media reported that Israel has postponed a planned meeting 
with Costa Rican officials over the Central American nationQs 
decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state. 
 
The Jerusalem Post and Israel Radio quoted Syria's Ambassador to the 
U.S., Imad Mustafa, as saying on Monday that there will be no 
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal this year, adding that the Annapolis 
conference was only an "exercise in public relations.' 
 
Israel Radio and Ha'aretz's web site reported that on Monday a U.S. 
federal judge ruled that Iran must pay more than $33 million to the 
family of David Ben-Rafael, a U.S.-born Israeli diplomat killed in 
the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. 
 
South Korea's Ambassador to Israel, Dr. Shin Kak-soo, was quoted as 
saying in an interview with Ha'aretz that the top priority of new 
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak will be a solution to the North 
Korean nuclear problem. 
 
Electronic media reported that this morning a five-justice panel of 
the High Court of Justice, headed by Supreme Court President Dorit 
Beinisch, rejected, 3-2, petitions against the plea bargain arranged 
with former Israeli president Moshe Katsav.  Beinisch held a 
minority view.  The petitions were filed in response to Attorney 
General Menachem Mazuz's decision in June 2007 to sign a plea 
bargain with Katsav that eliminated two counts of rape that had 
appeared in the draft indictment.  It also eliminated several other 
charges, including two counts of forcible indecent assault and one 
of sexual intercourse while exploiting an employer-employee 
relationship.  The plea bargain includes only minor sexual offenses 
-- one count of indecent assault involving pressure and one of 
sexual harassment -- and would give Katsav a suspended sentence 
rather than actual jail time. 
 
Ha'aretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that on Monday the 
Immigration Police raided the area around Tel Aviv's old central bus 
station and arrested more than 240 asylum seekers, most of them from 
Eritrea and some from the Ivory Coast.  The raid followed PM Ehud 
Olmert's order to deport all infiltrators who lack UN certification 
as refugees by the end of the week. 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that Israel has sent Kenya 800 kg of 
medical equipment. 
 
The electronic media reported that Dan Shomron, who was IDF chief of 
staff from 1987 to 1991, passed away today at the age of 70. 
 
All media reported that the Bank of Israel lowered central bank 
interest rates for March by 0.5%; the prevailing expectation in the 
marketplace had been that Governor Stanley Fischer would leave the 
central bank rate unchanged or reduce it by only 0.25%.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: "The most 
important development in dealing with the Iranian nuclear program is 
intra-American." 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in Ha'aretz: 
"Without making light of the power of the Israeli Air Force and its 
excellent pilots, this is not something we should be doing on our 
own. Israel needs the cooperation, consent and support of the United 
States and the European Union in order to defend itself."

¶I.  "Sanctions to Gain Time" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (2/26): "The 
United Nations Security Council is discussing a draft resolution 
this week that to a small extent tightens economic sanctions against 
Iran.... [But] the most important development in dealing with the 
Iranian nuclear program is intra-American.... Since the publication 
of the [National] Intelligence Assessment, and the gleeful reactions 
to it in Tehran, Washington has come to its senses and is trying to 
state things precisely.... The standard-bearer for the Republican 
Party, Senator John McCain of Arizona, is partner to Bush's 
belligerent stance against a nuclear Iran.  The Democrats have not 
yet stabilized around a candidate and only in the duel between the 
candidates of the two parties this fall will there be an airing of 
the differences of opinion on foreign affairs and security issues, 
among them a nuclear Iran.  The mission, then, is to get to the next 
administration with a reasonable opening position in the 
international arena, in the shape of resolutions on sanctions.  This 
is not a lot, but it is not realistic to expect the world to embark 
now on a war for which, in its opinion, the time is not yet ripe. 
From Israel's perspective, this is not heartening news.  Its hope 
that international elements will deal with the Iranian atom for 
their own sake and spare Israel difficult decisions is liable to 
turn out to have been an illusion." 
 
II.  "The Goal: Annihilating Israel" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in Ha'aretz 
(2/26): "Israel is the only member of the United Nations that is 
being openly threatened with destruction -- not just as a country 
but as a Jewish state.  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who 
never loses an opportunity to sow hatred against the Jews, is busy 
drumming up support for the annihilation of Israel.... [A] 
possibility is for Israel to get parliamentarians of European Union 
countries to convince their governments to stop selling bomb-making 
materials to Iran.  But the most important thing of all is to make 
the U.S. Congress understand the dangers that loom over its sane 
allies in the region.  From what we are hearing these days, the next 
American president is not going to be as friendly or involved in the 
war on Islamic extremism as George W. Bush.... Even if Ahmadinejad 
doesn't use the bomb -- if he ever gets his hands on one -- there is 
no question that this threat looming over our heads is liable to 
undermine the whole concept of Israel being the only safe haven for 
the Jewish people.  Under the circumstances, it is important for 
Israel to avoid collective punishment of the population of Gaza, 
lest it lose international support for its efforts to block the 
Iranian nuclear program.  Without making light of the power of the 
Israeli Air Force and its excellent pilots, this is not something we 
should be doing on our own. Israel needs the cooperation, consent 
and support of the United States and the European Union in order to 
defend itself."

¶2.  Islamic Extremism: 
---------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Middle East scholar and former senior diplomat Zvi Gabbay wrote in 
the popular, pluralist Maariv: "Media attention is focusing on the 
boastful statements of leaders such as Nasrallah and Ahmadinejad, 
but it neglects the non-confrontational voices of Arab 
intellectuals, who dare to stand as buffers against the despots."

"Another Arab Voice" 
 
Middle East scholar and former senior diplomat Zvi Gabbay wrote in 
the popular, pluralist Maariv (2/26): "Media attention is focusing 
on the boastful statements of leaders such as Nasrallah and 
Ahmadinejad, but it neglects the non-confrontational voices of Arab 
intellectuals, who dare to stand as buffers against the despots, 
asking them harsh questions about social issues and human rights. 
These intellectuals express real concern for their people, who groan 
under the tyrannical regimes of leaders whose main concern is 
preserving their power.  The linkage that the leaders make between 
dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict and the gloomy situation of 
the Arab nations is no longer acceptable to many people in Arab 
countries.  However, they are unable to express their opinions in 
their own countries, and they publish their statements in Arabic 
newspapers that are published mainly in London.  Among the 
intellectuals who dare to speak against accepted convention are the 
Saudi Arabian Ali bin Talal el-Jihani.  In an essay that was 
published in Al-Hayat (December 11, 2007), he criticizes 
politicians, Sunni or Shi'ite, who use Islam to justify terrorism. 
He claims that this was forbidden by all streams of Islam 'even 
before the coming of Khomeini and the ascent of his supporters in 
Lebanon and Palestine.'  El-Jihani claims that terrorism in the name 
of Islam has damaged the Arabs and the true image of Islam.... In 
the newspaper Ilaf, which is published in London, Khadeir Taher, an 
Iraqi Shi'ite, laments the ethnic struggles in Iraq in which, in his 
opinion, the Syrian and Iranian secret services have a hand. 
Besides, he also dares to note that 'what happens in Lebanon and in 
Palestine' is the result of provocative acts by the 'Iranian fools 
and mercenaries.'  The author does not forget to note in the margins 
of his essay that if not for the newspaper in London, he would not 
be able to express his opinion.  Abd el-Halek Hassin wrote on the 
Internet that the Middle East will not become calm until the 
elimination of the 'fascist regimes in Syria and Iran and their 
burial together with the Iraqi Ba'ath regime.'  Only then, in his 
opinion, will it be possible to solve the problem of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict 'by negotiations as conducted by Sadat, who 
won back all of his land without spilling one drop of blood'.... 
When Arabs win freedom of the spirit, repose will come to the Middle 
East."
