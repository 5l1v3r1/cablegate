¶1.  (SBU) We presented reftel points to MFA Energy Officer Gulsun 
Erkul on October 6. During the discussion, we encouraged the 
Government of Turkey to participate in the DOE National Nuclear 
Security Administration (NNSA) "Sister Laboratory" program for 
bilateral technical cooperation in peaceful nuclear applications. 
Erkul reacted positively to this opportunity for cooperation, 
stating that she would present the proposal to the Energy Ministry 
and the Turkish Atomic Energy Board (TAEK) for further consideration 
and action. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In response to Erkul's question whether the lack of a 
"Cooperation on Peaceful Uses for Nuclear Energy" ("123") Agreement 
would be an obstacle, we noted that technical cooperation under the 
"Sister Laboratory" program is undertaken under a non-binding 
protocol and does not require a more formal and broader agreement. 
We stated that "123" ratification was still in process in 
Washington. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Citing other areas of potential cooperation with respect 
to Turkey's decision to seek to add nuclear power to its energy mix, 
we mentioned the DOE Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) and 
cooperation with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
(septel).  Scheduled briefings from USG officials to Turkish 
officials on these topics have unfortunately not materialized to 
date, but the Energy U/S told us he looks forward to meeting with 
the U.S. NRC at an IAEA meeting in Vienna in November.  Erkul 
suggested that we advance these initiatives by presenting them more 
formally to the Turkish Government. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: We continue to approach the Turkish Government 
with offers of cooperation in various areas of nuclear energy. 
Turkey ratified the "123" agreement in March 2005, but we have not 
been able to provide formal feedback on our ratification status to 
date.  Continued delay in providing a formal answer may be perceived 
by TAEK and MFA as an indication the U.S. is not eager to be part of 
Turkish nuclear power development and that they should look to 
alternative sources for assistance (Russia, Canada, France, South 
Korea).  End Comment.
