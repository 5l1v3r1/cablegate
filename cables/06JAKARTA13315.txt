SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR AMBASSADOR RICHARD CROWDER, 
MR. JASON HAFEMEISTER, MR. ANDREW STEPHENS, AND MS. ELLEN 
TERPSTRA 
 
REF: USTR AND USDA FAS 681882 
 
¶1. Embassy Jakarta grants country clearance to Ambassador 
Richard Crowder, Chief Agricultural Negotiator USTR, Mr. 
Jason Hafemeister, Deputy Assistant USTR, Mr. Andrew 
Stephens, Director, USTR and Ms. Ellen Terpstra, Deputy 
Under Secretary, USDA to visit Jakarta from November 30 
through December 2, 2006.  The purpose of the visit is to 
discuss DOHA Agricultural negotiations and market access 
issues with Government of Indonesia. 
 
¶2. Control officer for this visit is Fred Kessel, 
Agricultural Counselor, office telephone (62-21) 3435-9162, 
home telephone (62-21) 3989-9316, cell phone (62) 816-186 
¶8366. 
 
¶3. Hotel Reservation information will be sent separately via 
email. 
 
¶4. All official travelers to Indonesia are encouraged to 
travel on a diplomatic or official passport (with at least 
six months validity remaining) and must be in possession of 
a valid visa issued at an Indonesian embassy or consulate 
abroad.  Travelers arriving without a valid visa may 
purchase an airport visa for Dols. 10.00 for a three-day 
validity or Dols. 25.00 for a thirty-day validity.  Payment 
must be made with the exact fee in U.S. dollars and there 
are no currency exchange facilities at the visa counters. 
Please note that upon expiration of the 3-day or 30-day 
visa, travelers must/must depart Indonesia for at least two 
weeks and the visa cannot be renewed.  Post strongly 
encourages all TDY travelers to obtain visas in advance to 
avoid problems in case travel plans change unexpectedly. 
 
¶5. All air travelers from Jakarta are subject to a departure 
tax of Rupiah 30,000 (approx. Dols. 3.00) for domestic 
flights and Rupiah 100,000 (approximately Dols. 10.00) for 
international flights.  This must be paid in local currency 
at the check-in desk.  It may not be paid in U.S. dollars. 
 
¶6. Ground transport from Jakarta International Airport will 
be provided by FAS/Jakarta. 
 
¶7. Threat Assessment: The most recent Department of State 
travel warning cautions American citizens to defer non- 
essential travel to Indonesia.  The bombings of two 
restaurants in Bali on October 1, 2005, the Australian 
Embassy on September 9, 2004, the J.W. Marriott Hotel in 
Jakarta on August 5, 2003, and of two nightclubs in Bali and 
the attack near the U.S. Consular Agency in Bali, both on 
October 12, 2002, along with the current security situation 
within Indonesia, puts U.S. citizens and interests at risk. 
All American citizens in Indonesia have been warned to 
evaluate their security posture and exercise maximum caution 
such as avoiding crowds and demonstrations and locations 
known to cater primarily to a Western clientele.  Bombings 
and separatist violence in the provinces of Aceh and Papua 
(Iryan Jaya), Central and West Kalimantan, Maluku, North 
Maluku, Central and South Sulawesi and West Timor have 
contributed to unsafe conditions in these regions.  On 
August 31, 2002, an ambush in Papua resulted in the death of 
two and wounded eight Americans.  Americans should avoid all 
travel to these areas. 
 
¶8. The Embassy strictly controls the entry of laptop 
computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other 
electronic devices into Embassy facilities.  If you plan to 
bring official electronic equipment to post, please advise 
the make/model, and serial number or other control number to 
your sponsoring office at post so they may alert the 
Regional Security Office.  Personally owned or unapproved 
USG equipment may not enter the controlled access areas. 
 
¶9.  ICASS Policy: Each visitor, regardless of length of 
stay, must bring/forward fiscal data to pay for direct costs 
of the visit.  Each agency, organization, or visiting 
delegation will be charged for the actual costs attributed 
 
JAKARTA 00013315  002 OF 002 
 
 
to their visit.  For TDYers over thirty (30) days, there is 
a charge for ICASS support services.  If your sponsoring 
agency is not signed up for ICASS services at post, please 
be prepared to sign an MOU for ICASS support services upon 
arrival.  The agency should provide post with a written 
communication, generated by the traveler's headquarters, 
that confirms the agency will pay ICASS charges for the 
TDYer, provides the agency ICASS billing code that TDY 
support charges should be applied to, and authorizes the 
traveler to sign the ICASS invoice generated by the TDY 
module.  To request use of Mission services upon arrival at 
post, TDY personnel must complete and sign the form 
'Application and Approval for Use of U.S. Mission Services,' 
attach their travel orders, and submit it to the Management 
Counselor for approval.  TDY visitors will not have access 
to Mission services, including the Commissary, until the 
form is completed. 
 
¶10. Medical: 
 
¶A. The Embassy in Jakarta operates a Health Unit that is 
accessible to personnel who have a current Class 1 or 2 
medical clearance issued by State MED. Military personnel 
whose agencies have signed an ICASS agreement also have 
access. 
 
¶B. TDYers who are federal employees and who have been on TDY 
travel outside of CONUS for less than 60 days in a calendar 
year may use the health unit for up to 60 days without a 
medical clearance. Those traveling on government orders for 
more than 60 days per year should obtain medical clearance 
before coming to post.  Without a clearance, health unit 
access will be denied. 
 
¶C. Traveler has Medical Evacuation Insurance WITH MEDEX 
ASSISTANCE CORPORATION.  Direct-hire State Department 
employees are already covered for medical evacuation. 
Medical care in Indonesia is deficient and employees are 
frequently evacuated to Singapore for care. 
 
¶D. Bring copies of all medical and immunization records and 
update immunizations prior to arrival, including Typhoid, 
Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.  Bring an adequate supply of 
prescription medications.   For travel to some areas outside 
Jakarta, malaria prophylaxis should be started before 
arrival.
