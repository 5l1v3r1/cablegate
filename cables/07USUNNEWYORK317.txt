¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Acting Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General (SRSG) Taye Brook-Zerihoun briefed the 
 
SIPDIS 
United Nations Security Council (UNSC) at April 23 
consultations on the status of the UN Mission in the Sudan 
(UNMIS) and on implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement (CPA).  Zerihoun stressed as priorities completion 
of the CPA security protocol by July 9, establishment of 
administration in Abyei, and preparations for 2009 elections. 
 Zerihoun called the problem of Darfur an integral part of 
the problems of Sudan and hoped for a political solution in 
Darfur, an end to violence and attacks against humanitarian 
workers, and disarmament of the janjaweed.  Zerihoun offered 
no elucidation on the question of appointment of an UNMIS 
SRSG, saying it was an SYG prerogative.  Sudanese and Qatari 
representatives confirmed that SYG Ban was meeting a 
high-level Sudanese delegation in Doha April 23.  Ambassador 
Sanders called for progress on Darfur peacekeeping as a way 
of maintaining CPA integrity and introduced our draft 
resolution for extending UNMIS' mandate (reftel).  Members by 
and large favored the SYG's recommendation for a six-month 
mandate extension.  The first Experts Meeting on the draft 
text will be April 24, with a view to adoption on April 27. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
MODEST PROGRESS IN CPA IMPLEMENTATION 
------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Acting UNMIS SRSG Taye Brook-Zerihoun briefed the 
UNSC at April 23 consultations on the status of the Mission 
and on implementation of the CPA.  Zerihoun warned that the 
changing roles of key actors in the peace process have 
complicated the already difficult process of CPA 
implementation, but he noted some progress: establishment of 
almost all power-sharing commissions, the functioning of the 
National Petroleum Commission and the launching of the new 
Sudanese currency under wealth-sharing agreements, and the 
modest steps toward economic development in Southern Sudan. 
On security issues, Zerihoun said the cease-fire had been 
respected in the wake of the November violence in Malakal, 
suggesting that the Cease-fire Joint Monitoring Commission 
had been instrumental in preventing conflict escalation. 
Finally, Zerihoun commended the efforts of UN Special Envoy 
of the SYG for the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)-affected 
areas Joaquim Chissano in improving prospects for the 
resumption of high-level talks with the LRA, adding that LRA 
attacks in southern Sudan were down. 
 
BUT HURDLES REMAIN 
------------------ 
¶4. (SBU) Zerihoun was concerned that full formation of Joint 
Integrated Units (JIUs) was still behind the schedule laid 
out in the CPA, carrying potential consequences for the "full 
and verified redeployment" of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 
and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) by the CPA's 
July 9 deadline, since SPLA redeployment would be through 
JIUs.  Zerihoun warned about the continued existence of Other 
Armed Groups (OAGs) in Southern Sudan, despite established 
deadlines for their disbandment.  OAGs were also facing 
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) 
challenges, he added.  Zerihoun said that the North-South 
border demarcation was lagging and that there was still no 
agreement on Abyei boundaries, despite the commencement of 
the work of a technical team on the ground.  Zerihoun 
reported that the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA) was 
still intact, despite the perception that it represented more 
a deal between the Sudanese Government of National Unity 
(GNU) and the Government of the State of Eritrea than it did 
between the GNU and the rebel Eastern Front.  Zerihoun noted 
residual resentment by the Beja Congress in Kassala and Port 
Sudan at having been excluded from ESPA negotiations. 
Finally, Zerihoun reported that UNMIS was still subject to 
GNU restrictions, particularly in Sector VI of its Area of 
Operations, impacting on demining activities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Zerihoun stressed as priorities completion of the 
security protocol by July 9, establishment of Abyei 
administration and development of Southern Kordofan and Blue 
 
USUN NEW Y 00000317  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
Nile States, and preparations for 2009 elections, including 
passage of the requisite electoral law, groundwork for the 
national census in November, subsequent voter registration 
and a re-engagement of political parties with their 
constituencies.  In a meeting of troop- and 
police-contributing countries immediately prior to 
consultations, Zerihoun remarked that census preparations 
were hampered by lack of refugee and internally displaced 
person returns. 
 
DARFUR DRAINING UNMIS 
--------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) Such returns, according to Zerihoun, were but one 
illustration of the effect of the Darfur crisis on UNMIS. 
Declaring that peace in Sudan was "indivisible," Zerihoun 
hoped for a political solution to the Darfur crisis, an end 
to violence and attacks against humanitarian workers, and 
disarmament of the janjaweed by the end of the year to 
counteract the drain the Darfur conflict was causing on UNMIS 
time, effort and resources, particularly the mission support 
aspect, which had forced a re-prioritization in Southern 
Sudan.  Zerihoun also predicted that deployment of the Heavy 
Support Package (HSP) would similarly strain the UNMIS budget 
but recognized the drain overall as a necessary one.  "If 
Darfur is not pacified or is not at peace," Zerihoun 
explained, "then national elections will be only partial or 
will not be possible at all." 
 
¶7. (SBU) Zerihoun offered no elucidation on the question of 
appointment of an UNMIS SRSG, saying only that it was an SYG 
prerogative.  He called the hybrid operation "the ultimate 
objective" of Darfur peacekeeping and told Members to expect 
the hybrid to be finalized by the UN and the African Union 
(AU) within the next two weeks, at which time the plan would 
be presented simultaneously to the UNSC and the AU Peace and 
Security Council (PSC), as well as to the GNU for a 
"comprehensive briefing."  While acknowledging that GNU 
consent and AU PSC endorsement were necessary for hybrid 
implementation as a practical matter, Zerihoun spoke to the 
need for clarity on command and control structures and on 
accountability mechanisms. 
 
MEMBERS WANT 6 MONTHS FOR UNMIS 
------------------------------- 
¶8. (SBU) In her intervention, Ambassador Sanders called for 
progress on Darfur peacekeeping as a way of maintaining CPA 
integrity and introduced our draft resolution for extending 
UNMIS' mandate (reftel).  Members by and large favored the 
SYG's recommendation for a six-month mandate extension for 
UNMIS' mandate renewal (set to expire April 30).  Members, 
including France and the UK, told Poloff privately that to do 
otherwise, as our draft suggested, would give the impression 
that the UNSC's commitment to supporting the fragile CPA was 
fading.  Members also feared the linking of the expiration of 
the AMIS and UNMIS mandates (AMIS on June 30, UNMIS as we 
proposed on July 31), which would increase the pressure by 
Africans for UN funding of AMIS, regardless of hybrid 
progress.  Members expressed a general sense that renewing 
mandates for shorter periods of time would involve more UN 
bureaucratic procedures and complications for 
troop-contributing countries.  Russian and Chinese delegates 
questioned Poloff privately about the proposed three-month 
extension.  Italy and Belgium have also voiced concerns.  The 
first Experts Meeting on the draft text will be April 24, 
with a view to April 27 adoption. 
 
¶9. (SBU) A Qatari political officer told Poloff privately 
that his delegation could be flexible on the issue of mandate 
duration.  He asked if we planned to invoke any chapter of 
the UN Charter in the text.  He and Sudanese Mission 
Political Counselor confirmed separately that SYG Ban was 
meeting a high-level Sudanese delegation in Doha April 23, a 
meeting the Sudanese rep called "constructive."  The Sudanese 
delegate also told Poloff that the meeting between Eritrean 
President Isaias and President Bashir on reconciling Sudanese 
rebels had gone well.  Chadian President Deby was expected in 
Khartoum in the coming week, according to the Sudanese 
officer.
