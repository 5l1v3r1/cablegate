¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The nascent growth of Tibetan language 
internet in China slowed with the closure of several websites 
and detention of Tibetan e-activists over the past year. 
Tibetan language email and websites are nevertheless becoming 
increasingly popular among students and intellectuals, 
lower-level government officials, and monks due to much improved 
language upgrades in Microsoft Vista.  Ethnic Tibetans are 
networking using Tibetan language e-mail, the Internet, 
telephone software such as Skype, and instant messaging 
services.  Eighty-eight Tibetan language websites, including 
eleven government-sponsored sites, are currently available in 
China, mostly in ethnic Tibetan areas outside of the Tibetan 
Autonomous Region (TAR).  Given prior official support voiced by 
Chinese authorities for the development of Tibetan language 
software followed by the more recent crackdowns, it appears that 
Tibetan language internet is viewed by the government as both an 
avenue to influence Tibetans as well as a potential threat.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
 
High Plateau Internet 
 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Internet appears to be becoming more popular and 
accessible for China's six million ethnic Tibetans both within 
their own traditional areas and in other parts of the country. 
According to the China Center for Tibet Studies (a PRC 
government funded Tibetology research center in Beijing that 
publishes much research in both Chinese and Tibetan), the number 
of regular net users in the TAR reached 200,000 this year and 
there are an estimated 800 TAR-hosted websites.  (Note: most are 
in Chinese and aimed at the burgeoning ethnic Han minority 
there).  In 1998, the first-ever internet bar was opened in 
Lhasa and charged 50 RMB (USD 6) per hour for internet access. 
Today, Lhasa's approximately 133 internet bars typically charge 
just 2 RMB (USD 30 cents) per hour. 
 
 
 
Improved Language Support Boosts Websites 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Chinese language Tibetan websites, such as Tibetcul.com 
run out of an ethnic Tibetan area of Gansu Province that was 
suspended for several weeks in March 2009, are not new. 
However, the rapid improvements in Tibetan language application 
software for Windows XP as well as Windows Vista are creating a 
second Tibetan language wave of Tibetan internet use.  Ever 
since Microsoft developed Himalaya Tibetan software with Windows 
Vista in 2007, many young Tibetan e-activists have been chatting 
in Tibetan through QQ, Skype and sending Tibetan-language 
e-mails. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) One ethnic Tibetan IT worker told ConGen recently there 
are now over one hundred Tibetan language websites in the world 
and 88 of them are hosted in Tibetan areas of China.  Among the 
88 Tibetan websites, eleven were created for official government 
purposes, with the others being semi-official or private. 
According to the IT worker, ninety percent of Tibetan language 
websites were created in Tibetan areas of China outside of the 
TAR, especially in Tibetan areas of Qinghai and Gansu Provinces. 
 These Tibetan language websites are owned by non-governmental 
communities and individuals, such as Tibetan monasteries, 
college students, and low-ranking rural Tibetan cadres. 
 
 
 
PRC Sees Both Opportunity~ 
 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Senior Chinese government leaders, including President 
Hu Jintao, have officially voiced support for making it easier 
to use Tibetan on computers and the Internet.  On January 10, 
2009 in Lhasa, the TAR government inaugurated a new Tibetan 
language software development project.  At the opening-ceremony, 
TAR Governor Shamba Phuntsog asserted, "the development of 
Tibetan language software and the digitalization of Tibetan is 
an important part of TAR's stability and development work.  This 
will not only make it easier for Tibetan masses to use modern 
communication, but also will effectively refute Western hostile 
forces and the `Dalai clique's proposition that Tibetan culture 
is dying out in China." (http://tinyurl.com/ddqk5k 
  ). Official attention given to 
Tibetan language on the Internet appears to parallel the 
lengthening of Tibetan language PRC state radio broadcasts from 
four to eighteen hours daily beginning in March 2009.

~ and Threat in Tibetan Language Websites 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) At the same time, however, some Tibetan language 
websites have been closed and ethnic Tibetan Web activists 
arrested.  For example, Kunga Tsayang, a monk from the Labrang 
Monastery in Gansu Province, was reportedly arrested by Public 
Security Bureau officers in a late-night raid on March 17, 2009 
during a general government crackdown across Tibetan areas of 
China.  Tsayang had written such online political essays as, 
"Who Is the Real Disturber of Stability?" and, "Who Is the Real 
Instigator of Protests?"  A translation of one of his articles, 
"Who are the Real Separatists?" can be found at 
http://tinyurl.com/oybjop 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) Similarly, on October 16, 2007, a day before the Dalai 
Lama was due to be honored with the Congressional Gold Medal, 
www.tibettl.com/blog   was shut 
down temporarily.  Soon after, www.tibetcm.com 
  known as "the Lamp" that claimed some 
800 registered forum users and blogwww.tibetcm.com/blog 
  were temporarily shut down and only 
reopened after sensitive articles and postings were deleted. 
These websites were also suspended for two to three weeks in 
March 2009, but have since been reopened.  The Chinese-language 
Tibetan website www.newtibet.com   has 
been closed since 2005.  Website owners are reportedly often 
called to police stations and ordered to delete articles. 
 
 
QQ Tibetan Language Messaging Shutdown 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Another indicator of official anxiety over Tibetan 
language internet was the February 2009 closure of Tibetan 
language messaging on QQ, which is by far China's most popular 
internet messaging service.   Monitoring Tibetan language 
messaging is probably difficult for the Chinese government, 
which reportedly faces shortages of personnel both 
linguistically capable of reading Tibetan and politically 
reliable enough to be depended upon to give accurate reports. 
 
 
 
¶9. (SBU) Tencent QQ (a Shenzhen company, for background see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QQ ) recently received the 
following message from an ethnic Tibetan;  "Over the past 10 
years, QQ has provided high quality services for all the net 
users and we are very grateful for that.  Since the Himalayan 
Tibetan language support was built into the Microsoft Vista 
operating system, it has brought an unprecedented benefit for 
the development and use of Tibetan language on the internet and 
hence all Tibetans are very happy about this.  However, Tencent 
has recently banned Tibetan language chat on the QQ without any 
reason.  As a great culture in the big family of China, Tibetan 
should be respected and given equal rights in the society; 
therefore, we hope that Tencent will solve this problem as soon 
as possible and give Tibetans equal rights." (The original 
Chinese language text is at http://tinyurl.com/cmhwth 
 )" 
 
 
 
¶10. (SBU) The recent Tibetan language chatting ban on QQ 
indicates the challenges and difficulties Tibetan language users 
are facing in China.  The Chinese Government often suspends or 
shuts down Tibet-related websites in both the Chinese and 
Tibetan languages for political reasons, and has detained 
Tibetan e-activists for writing, posting and chatting sensitive 
things on the internet.  This situation appears to have gotten 
more serious over the past year, likely due to general security 
tightening ahead of sensitive Tibetan anniversaries in March. 
At least six well-known Tibetan e-activists have reportedly been 
harassed, and their blogs and websites have closed down over the 
last 10 months (for example: http://tinyurl.com/cd6qfm 
   or http://tinyurl.com/corjkr 
  ). 
 
 
 
Hot Topics: Religion, Culture, Literature, Education 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Hot topics on Tibetan language websites include: 
 
CHENGDU 00000087  003.2 OF 005 
 
 
religion, culture, literature, the promotion of the Tibetan 
language, education, government policies, environmental 
protection, and health care.  In addition, some of these 
websites carry Tibetan language blogs, forums, opinion pollingg, 
interviews, on-line movies and songs.  Most participants appear 
to be Tibetan students, young intellectuals, and monks, as well 
as rural/low ranking Tibetan government or Party cadres. 
 
 
 
Official Involvement in Software Development 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (U) Chinese government offices involved in developing 
Tibetan language software include:  the Communist Party's United 
Front Work Department, the Ministry of Industry and Information 
Technology, the National Reform and Development Commission, and 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  Private Chinese companies are 
also working on such software, including the China Founder Group 
and Red Flag Software Company, as well as the Tibet University 
and the TAR Tibetan Language Working Committee. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comments 
 
-------- 
 
¶13. (SBU) Most Tibetan websites appear to have been created and 
are managed by young Tibetans as either a part-time job (with 
little remuneration) or hobby using very simple and basic 
technology.  It does look like anyone is making much of a profit 
from Tibetan language websites yet.  Shortages of funding and 
Tibetan technical expertise remain obstacles to the further 
development of Tibetan language websites and e-activism.  The 
future of e-activism and Tibetan language use on the internet in 
China will likely continue to remain closely tied to the 
availability of cheap internet access, the availability of 
Microsoft Vista and eventually other functionally equivalent 
operating systems, and the control/interference exercised by 
local authorities.
