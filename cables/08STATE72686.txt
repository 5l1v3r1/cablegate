 ¶1. The Department has reviewed its files and finds that it 
possesses no credible information of gross violations of 
human rights at this time by the members of the Iraqi

that visa applications for both individuals be filed with as 
much time as possible to allow for additional processing 
procedures that may be required.  Note that if, at any time,

incidents which could be deemed to be credible information of 
a gross violation of human rights by any of these 
individuals, the Embassy should so inform the Department.
