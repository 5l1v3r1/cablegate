REF: JAKARTA 1968 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- 
Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The avian influenza-related lawsuit 
against the USG and World Health Organization (WHO) has been 
dismissed.  The Central Jakarta District Court cited the 
plaintiff's lack of seriousness and refusal to pay 
administrative court fees as the reasons for its decision. 
This is a welcome outcome that removes a potentially serious 
irritant to our bilateral relationship.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) CASE DISMISSED:  On December 15, Mission received a 
copy of the Central Jakarta District Court's decision to 
remove the lawsuit against the USG and the WHO from the 
court's register of cases.  The court acted on the grounds of 
lack of "seriousness" by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's 
refusal to pay for administrative court fees. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On the latter point, the attorneys for the 
plaintiff were notified on July 21 and September 9 that the 
plaintiff must deposit additional funds in a court account to 
cover administrative fees.  On November 6, the court notified 
the plaintiff that if additional funds were not forthcoming, 
the case would be dismissed after 30 days.  In the decision, 
the Chief Judge determined that because the plaintiff was 
unwilling to deposit additional funds to cover court costs, 
the plaintiff was not interested in pursuing the case further. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) DISCREPANCY IN DECISION DATE:  There is some 
question about the date of dismissal.  According to the 
decision, the case was removed from the register on November 
7, 2008.  The discrepancy between the date of the decision 
and the date in December when the decision was mailed to 
Mission is likely due to internal court processing, as is 
often the case with Indonesian courts. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) NO MEDIA ATTENTION:  There was no press coverage of 
the court proceedings or of the dismissal. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) A WELCOME OUTCOME:  This is a welcome outcome that 
removes a potentially serious irritant to our bilateral 
relationship.  Mission would like to thank the Department of 
Justice Office of Foreign Litigation for its assistance with 
this case.
