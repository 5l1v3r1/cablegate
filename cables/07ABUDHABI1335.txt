SUBJECT: THIRD LATIN AMERICAN EMBASSY TO OPEN IN ABU DHABI 
 
Sensitive but unclassified. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Charge was recently introduced by diplomatic 
colleagues to a new Charge representing Venezuela in the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE).  MFA tells us that the Venezuelan 
mission is still being set up and that the current Charge 
(Asdrubal Pulido Leon) would likely be replaced by (or assume 
the duties of) an accredited Ambassador in the near future. 
In an August 9 conversation with PolOffs, MFA's Department of 
European, American, and Oceanic Affairs saw no particular 
significance in the establishment of this new diplomatic 
mission, noting that as a member of OPEC, Venezuela already 
had a sufficient window into the premier issue of oil policy. 
 MFA noted that it rarely received requests for meetings from 
Latin American diplomats. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The establishment of an Embassy representing 
Venezuela brings to three the number of Latin American 
missions in Abu Dhabi, the other two being Argentina and 
Brazil.  MFA confirms that the UAE only has one mission in 
all of Latin America -- tasking its Ambassador in Brazil with 
looking after the entire region.  That Ambassador is 
officially accredited to a limited number of other capitals 
(they mentioned specifically Argentina, Chile, and Cuba), but 
is also called upon to help coordinate far flung issues (such 
as a prior visit by the president of Uruguay to the UAE).
