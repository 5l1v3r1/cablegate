Chen Shui-bian, Current Situation in the Strait 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. At the January 30, 2008 regular Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) press 
briefing, TAO spokesman Yang Yi began with a lengthy statement about 
Chen Shui-bian and the situation in the Taiwan Strait.  Yang stated 
that in the past year, Chen Shui-bian has pressed on with his 
"Taiwan independence separatist activities."  The Chinese Government 
has firmly opposed Chen's "so-called constitutional revision" and 
his attempts to hold a "referendum on joining the UN" to achieve 
Taiwan's "de jure independence."  The relations between the two are 
at a critical juncture and curbing "Taiwan independence separatist 
activities" is a critical task of China and the Taiwan people. 
Facing this severe and complicated situation, the Mainland will be 
guided by the principle of "peaceful reunification, one country, two 
systems."  Yang stated that the Mainland would never give up or 
compromise in its opposition to Taiwan independence and would seek 
the peaceful development of relations.  The Mainland will continue 
to promote the implementation of cross-Strait exchanges in order to 
maintain the momentum and pace of their development, he said. 
 
No Comment on Civil Aviation Corridor 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Yang did not comment, when asked about Beijing's proposed new 
civil aviation corridor near the center line of the Taiwan Strait. 
 
Mainland Will Not Involve Itself in Taiwan Elections 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. "Noninvolvement" (bu jieru) in Taiwan's elections is the 
Mainland's clear and consistent position, stated Yang when asked if 
the TAO would offer assistance to Taiwan residents on the Mainland 
who want to return to Taiwan to vote in the March "presidential 
election."  The TAO is aware that many Taiwan businessmen on the 
Mainland have expressed interest in ensuring the availability of 
plane tickets, and the Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises 
on the Mainland has already contacted relevant airlines regarding 
this issue. 
 
¶5. Asked about prospects for the Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and 
Cultural Forum in the wake of the Kuomintang's (KMT) victory in 
January's Legislative Yuan elections, Yang said that the Mainland 
will continue to promote whatever is beneficial to the Taiwan 
compatriots, cross-Strait exchange, the maintenance of peace in the 
Taiwan Strait and the realization of the peaceful reunification of 
the Motherland. 
 
Snowstorms 
----------- 
 
¶6. Yang stated that the TAO is investigating damage suffered by 
Taiwan-owned enterprises on the Mainland during the recent 
snowstorms and will report back if there is any news, responding to 
a reporter's question.  Yang also pledged that the Mainland would do 
its utmost to assist any Taiwan compatriots or Taiwan enterprises 
affected by the storms. 
 
Charter Flights 
--------------- 
 
¶7.  Yang took multiple questions on charter flights over the Spring 
Festival holiday period, stating that arrangements had been made for 
94 round-trip flights to fly from February 2-6 and from February 
11-15.  Departure cities will include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, 
Xiamen, Taipei and Kaohsiung. 
 
Delay in Panda Delivery

----------------------- 
 
¶8. When asked why the giant pandas, Tuantuan and Yuanyuan, promised 
to Taiwan by the Mainland have still not arrived, Yang responded 
that Taiwan had refused to accept the gift because of Chen 
Shui-bian's "political considerations."  Yang said that the Mainland 
is sincere in its desire to give Taiwan the giant pandas and is 
still prepared to fulfill its promise. 
 
Fruit Delivery for Olympics 
--------------------------- 
 
¶9. Yang announced that Beijing has arranged to import Taiwanese 
fruit to fulfill the wishes of the Taiwanese farmers to have their 
produce sold at the Olympics. 
 
Mainland to Taiwan Railway Planning 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶10. Yang confirmed that in accordance with the "Comprehensive 
Transportation Network Long-Term Plan" approved by the State 
Council, the Ministry of Railways has begun planning for a 
transportation network spanning from Manzhouli in Northern China to 
Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 
 
Exchange in '07, Charter Flights, TAO Personnel, Crime-fighting, 
Gravel Exports, Agricultural Exchange 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶11. Asked for a summary of cross-Strait exchange and cooperation in 
2007, Yang discussed cooperation in the fields of culture, commerce, 
agriculture, finance, charter flights and the "three links."  Yang 
said the TAO leadership "has not changed," when asked about a 
possible upcoming personnel turnover.  The spokesman also took 
questions on cross-Strait crime-fighting, Mainland gravel exports to 
Taiwan and agricultural exchange.
