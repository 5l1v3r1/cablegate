REF: SECSTATE 38890 
 
¶1. Per reftel, on March 10, econoff met with ANATEL (Brazil's 
FCC equivalent) Superintendent of Radio Frequency and 
Monitoring Edilson Ribeiro dos Santos, Regional Monitoring 
Supervisor Antonio Zanoni and Spectrum Control Manager Itamar 
Paes.  Based on their previous conversations with Washington 
interlocutors, the three were expecting the demarche econoff 
presented and said ANATEL plans to resolve the complaint by 
the week of March 27.  They expressed surprise at the 
resurfacing of the complaint, as they thought the matter had 
already been resolved through their efforts in March 2005. 
Santos also assured econoff that he would personally deliver 
the letter and attachments to President of ANATEL, Mr. Plinio 
Aguiar Jr. 
 
¶2. Upon looking through the information provided, Santos 
reiterated a request the GoB has made before--more 
information on how the USG was able to pinpoint the location 
of the culprit(s).  He lamented Brazilian authorities' 
inability to reproduce such a study.   He and his colleagues 
suggested that, if possible, ANATEL representatives 
participate in an exchange program at the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) to observe monitoring 
practices and the advanced technology that would make the 
results econoff presented to them possible.  Santos also said 
that he understands that some of the technology may be 
protected, but the GoB is still interested in methods.  Paes 
added, ANATEL is looking for solutions to apprehend their 
most evasive violators of radio frequency--truckers.  They 
hope that their possible exchange at the FCC would also help 
in this regard.
