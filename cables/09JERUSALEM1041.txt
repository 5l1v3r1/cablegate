Main Stories: 
------------- 
All front pages covered Israeli daily Haaretz's report of an 
official complaint submitted by the U.S. three weeks ago to Israel 
over the deteriorating situation in Gaza.  The report, that leads Al 
Hayat Al Jadida, alleges that the U.S. urged Israel to lift the Gaza 
blockade and open the crossing points to allow entry of food aid, 
medication and construction materials to accelerate Gaza 
reconstruction activities.  The lead photo of Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
shows Gazan children protesting the Israeli blockade near the Rafah 
crossing, holding signs that read, "Stop killing us." 
 
Al-Ayyam leads with and Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida run front 
page coverage of new demolition notices served by the Jerusalem 
Municipality on June 18 to Palestinian owners of several houses in 
East Jerusalem's Al-Bustan neighborhood.  The orders cite a lack of 
building permits. 
 
Al-Quds leads coverage with a Reuters wire report of a plan proposed 
by Jewish religious leaders aimed at dividing the religious sites in 
East Jerusalem, including Al-Aqsa mosque, among the three religions. 
 The Jewish leaders acknowledged that the plan will be extremely 
difficult to implement because it will be, "subject to deep and 
lengthy study by the concerned parties," according to coverage. 
 
Al-Quds'front page announces, without further detail, that two new 
cases of H1N1 have been reported in the Palestinian Territories. 
The Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health reassured the public 
that the cases, "are contained," reporting notes. 
 
All dailies run front page coverage of statements made by Middle 
East Quartet Envoy Tony Blair (June 18), stating that he believes a 
peace settlement can be reached between Israel and the Palestinians 
within a year's time, if all concerned parties meet their 
obligations. 
 
Al- Ayyam includes a Reuters wire report on its front page 
concerning statements from PLO Chief Negotiator Erekat (June 18) 
reiterating the Palestinian demand that settlement activities must 
stop completely in order to end the Palestinian Israeli conflict. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs inside coverage on the participation of 
General Dayton and the Palestinian Authority Minister of Interior in 
a graduation ceremony held in Ramallah (June 18) for 40 Palestinian 
Authority National Security Forces from a "U.S.-funded training 
course on security procedures."  General Dayton is quoted stating 
that preparing Palestinian Authority security forces is part of 
preparations for a Palestinian state.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds editorial runs under the title, "Retaining Palestinian 
red lines"(06/190:  "Palestinians can contain their conflict only by 
returning to transparent and accountable elections... Palestinians 
must commit to their national principles [statehood, sovereignty, 
ending the Israeli occupation,etc.] which have always characterized 
the Palestinian national movement... Otherwise, we will witness more 
deterioration in the Palestinian cause, and we will have no one but 
ourselves to blame." 
 
2) Mouhammad Yaghi opines in independent daily Al-Ayyam under the 
title, "The world is waiting to hear three words from Misha'al," 
(06/19):  "In order for the Palestinian conflict to end, [Hamas 
 
JERUSALEM 00001041  002 OF 002 
 
 
leader] Misha'al must voice his acceptance of the two-state 
solution, even if he attaches preconditions... such as a halt to all 
settlement activities, dismantling existing settlements and 
retaining full sovereignty over Jerusalem... The bottom line is to 
recognize the need for two states... I do not believe that Hamas is 
ready yet [to make such statements]."
