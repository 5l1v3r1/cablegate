¶2.  (SBU) Finance Minister Rodrigo Cabezas went on the 
offensive November 14 and publicly accused FEDECAMARAS,the 
country's largest umbrella business organization, of 
"subversion" for its opposition to the BRV's constitutional 
reform project.  Cabezas was reacting to a five-page report 
issued by the organization on November 13 calling on civil 
society to reject the project and laying out why it was 
reiterating its rejection (ref. c).  The starkly worded 
document which is available on the FEDECAMARAS website 
underscores the continuing deterioration of the country's 
productive sectors and international competitiveness (in 
spite of high oil-fueled, consumption-led growth rates), the 
failure of BRV economic production schemes, skyrocketing 
crime, the erosion of the nation's institutions, laws and 
social comity, and the consolidation of power into the hands 
of one individual. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Cabezas in a hastily convened press conference 
(where reportedly no questions were permitted) challenged the 
FEDECAMARAS position that the reform project was illigitimate 
by noting that articles 342 and 344 of the current 
constitution provided for constitutional reform and 
established the mechanics for doing so.  He also defended the 
BRV's economic record by claiming, inter alia, that there 
still were "large opportunities to invest (in Venezuela)" and 
argued that "it was impossible to explain 15 quarters of 
economic growth without the expansion of investment and newly 
productive plants."
