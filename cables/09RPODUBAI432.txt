REACTOR FUEL IF AGREEMENTS FAIL 
 
DUBAI 00000432  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1. (U) On October 10 the Iranian press service ISNA reported 
comments by AEOI Spokesman Ali Shirzadian on Iran's options for 
acquiring fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR). 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) The ISNA article's title was: "AEOI Spokesman in Talk 
with ISNA: Various Ways of Procuring Fuel for the Tehran Reactor 
Are Being Looked At; If They Don't Give 20 Percent [Enriched] 
Fuel, Iran will Itself Act to Provide Fuel."  A loose 
translation of AEOI spokesman Shirzadian's main comments are as 
follows: 
 
 
 
- [referring to Iran's proposal to provide fuel enriched to 5.3 
percent in exchange for 20 percent enriched fuel] This is a 
practical pro posal and it was agreed in the discussions that 
various ways for providing fuel be looked into. 
 
 
 
- The amount of fuel that this reactor needs is 150 to 300 
kilograms, depending on its level of operations.  This reactor 
is the main provider of needed medical isotopes in Iran and its 
[current] fuel is sufficient for a period a little over a year 
and a half. 
 
 
 
- [in stating that Iran's national interests are paramount in 
the deal to provide fuel for the TRR]: We will decide based on 
national interests and technological progress, and a technical 
report for confirmation and final approval will be submitted to 
Iran's officials after carrying out discussions and 
investigations.. As such, it is agreed that there will be 
discussions on how to carry out this work at the October 19 
meeting among Iran and several countries to include America, 
Russia, France and the IAEA. 
 
 
 
- [Question: Why couldn't Iran buy twenty percent enriched fuel 
as it did 16 years ago from Argentina]: One of the proposals was 
providing 5.3 percent enriched fuel and receiving 20 percent 
enriched fuel..  Iran has complete enrichment technology at its 
disposal and as such will sit at the negotiating table with a 
full hand and with power. 
 
 
 
- [Question: What will Iran do if, for whatever reason in the 
future, the probable contract to provide fuel for TCC is 
cancelled, like other contracts that up until now these 
countries have had with Iran which have cancelled or 
postponed?]: At that time we will write a letter and announce to 
the IAEA that Iran will itself act to provide fuel for the 
Tehran Reactor. 
 
 
 
- From an economic viewpoint it is most economical for us to 
purchase the TRR fuel from one place instead of acting to set up 
a production line to change five percent enriched uranium to 
provide 20 percent enriched uranium for 200 kilograms.   For 
this reason we told the IAEA that we need this much fuel and the 
IAEA Director General carried out some actions in this regard. 
 
 
 
- Iran is an IAEA member and the IAEA is present in the 
discussions relating to providing fuel for the TCC, and this is 
a guarantee for the implementation of a probable fuel agreement. 
 The question of how much ability the IAEA has to defend 
agreements reached under this international agency's framework 
and guarantee their implementation goes back to the Agency 
itself.  If tomorrow or one day America wants to create problems 
with such an agreement it is not a matter for Iran and the IAEA, 
but relates to America and the IAEA. 
 
 
 
- We enter these negotiations as a technical organization and 
pursue dialogue.  If an agreement is formed and for any reason 
isn't implemented the stain is on the reputation of the IAEA and 
 
DUBAI 00000432  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
the countries scuttling the agreement. 
 
 
 
- [Question: if the agreement isn't implemented, will Iran 
itself produce the 20 percent enriched fuel for the TCC]: As I 
said earlier, [in this instance] we ourselves would act [i.e. 
provide the fuel], of course this action of Iran's would be 
under the supervision of the IAEA. 
 
 
 
- [Question: what guarantee exists that the IAEA itself will 
live up to its agreements in that in relation to the modalities 
of settling up the remaining issues with Iran it has not acted 
according to its obligations]: 
 
 
 
Most of the IAEA's members agree that Iran's activities are 
peaceful and legal and that Iran has always cooperated with the 
IAEA, and the chance of exercising severe political pressure on 
Iran and on its cooperation in the f uture with the Agency is 
very slight.  At the same time we are not as pessimistic as you 
and we interact with good intentions, while from the technical 
viewpoint we are empowered. 
 
 
 
Definitely their positive steps will have a positive influence 
on wide future cooperation between the western world and 
developing countries, because these countries see the Islamic 
Republic of Iran as a defender of their nuclear rights who has 
taken a stand opposing imposition of conditions outside of 
international norms and has insisted on achieving its explicit 
rights.
