¶1.  (SBU) On November 1, Poloff delivered reftel demarches to 
Amb. Guillermo Melendez, Director General for Foreign Policy 
at the MFA, and Mario Rivera, Head of Multilateral Affairs. 
They replied that, bearing significant changes to the 
resolutions' text, El Salvador was unlikely to change its 
voting record this year on the three resolutions targeted by 
the U.S. for their anti-Israeli bias.  They said an 
abstention might be possible on resolution concerning the 
Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices, but were 
very unlikely to change their yes votes on the other two. 
(Comment: The GOES has made a very public effort this year to 
strengthen ties with Arab countries, including establishment 
of diplomatic relations with a number of countries, and 
moving their embassy in Israel from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. 
Given this policy shift on their part, we find it unlikely 
they will abstain on any of the resolutions.  End Comment). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On the resolutions concerning Lebanon, Melendez 
replied that he was unfamiliar with them, but would ask his 
Mission in New York to send copies.  He said the GOES 
believes that Hizballah was responsible for the initiation of 
the hostilities, and that Israel's response was justified. 
Nevertheless, he added the GOES feels that Israel inflicted 
greater overall damage.  In general he said the GOES would 
seek to support a balanced approach, and believed that any 
resolution must also make mention of the suffering of 
innocent Israeli civilians.
