(SBU)  On July 21, PolOffs visited MFA International 
Organizations (IO) Director Javier Bonagas to follow-up on 
reftel demarche delivered on July 18.  On the G-4 proposal, 
Bonagas reiterated the GOP position, similar to our own, that 
UNSC reform should be one part of an integral reform package. 
 He said that different groups of countries were seeking GOP 
support for their proposals, but he added that the GOP was 
not inclined to support the G-4 proposal.  He also 
underscored the importance of consensus on UN reform issues, 
saying that the GOP wishes to avoid deep divisions on reform 
issues.  Bonagas said the GOP hopes that the G-4 proposal 
will not come to a vote, but if it does, the Foreign Minister 
will have to decide what action to take.  Bonagas had nothing 
new to share on other UN demarche issues.  Embassy will 
report any updates to the Department.
