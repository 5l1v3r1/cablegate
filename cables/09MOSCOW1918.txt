REF: SECSTATE 77701 
 
(SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche to the MFA's 
International Organizations Department's Sergei Zhdanov.  He 
told us that in general Russia supported the opinion of the 
African Union and that the International Criminal Court 
should take into account the regional organization's 
position.  However, in connection with UNAMID's renewal, 
Zhdanov said that Russia could be "flexible," and urged us to 
reach out to Russia's UN Mission in New York.
