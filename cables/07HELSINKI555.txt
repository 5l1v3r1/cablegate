PolChief delivered reftel demarche to Acting European 
Correspondent Niklas Lindqvist on July 18.  Lindqvist 
highlighted the following: 
 
KOSOVO: The GOF is firmly behind Ahtisaari and 
agrees with our points.  The GOF is so fully behind 
Ahtisaari, in fact, that it still is waiting for a UNSCR, 
and not even thinking about establishing an official 
position on what it might do if Kosovo declares 
independence.  The GOF does not reject continued 
negotiations, but does reject something that might lead 
to "marginalizing" Ahtisaari's plan. 
 
UKRAINE: General agreement on our points, although the 
GOF does not expect strong messages on energy or weapons 
issues to emerge from the GAERC.  The tone of the 
upcoming EU-Ukraine summit will be positive, Finnish MFA 
says, although emphasis will be placed on free and fair 
September elections. 
 
IRAN: Member states will get a detailed report from 
Solana;  no conclusions expected.  The Finnish national 
position agrees with our points (albeit not overly 
enthusiastic agreement on further sanctions).  The Finns 
also want the EU to focus pressure on two tracks: 
pressuring Iran not only on the nuclear issue, but also 
on its dismal human rights record. 
 
SUDAN: The GOF expects a lot of discussion at the GAERC 
about a potential EU mission, and hopes for a strong 
signal from France regarding its intention to deploy an 
ESDP mission to Chad.  Finns are hopeful that this will 
lead to a more operational EU role, particularly in 
providing military support to the eventual EU police 
mission in Darfur.  Our contacts heard our message on 
sanctions, but did not think this would be a major 
component of GAERC deliberations.
