ERADICATION 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 225847 
 
     ¶B. WELLINGTON 502 
 
¶1. Post delivered ref A demarche points on December 20 to 
Vicki Poole, Global Group Program Manager at the New Zealand 
Agency for International Development (NZAID); Dr. Mark 
Jacobs, Director of Public Health in the Ministry of Health; 
and Rebecca Lineham, Americas Division of the New Zealand 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
 
¶2. On behalf of all these agencies, Poole responded on 
December 21 that New Zealand is aware of the critical need to 
fund polio eradication through the Polio Eradication 
Initiative (PEI), but that New Zealand's 2006 assistance 
funding is fully committed.  However, as in 2005 (ref B), the 
PEI will be a top priority for funding alongside HIV/AIDS 
should additional funds become available.
