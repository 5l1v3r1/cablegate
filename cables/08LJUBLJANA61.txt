MFA Security Policy Division official Borut Valencic, who 
stated that Slovenia supports IAEA efforts to investigate 
Iran's nuclear programs.  Valencic said that he would pass 
IAEA Deputy Director General for Safeguards Olli Heinonen's 
request for additional information from Nuclear Suppliers' 
Group members on export denials to all relevant Slovenian 
agencies and ministries.  He undertook to inform us if the 
GOS decides to provide such information to the IAEA.
