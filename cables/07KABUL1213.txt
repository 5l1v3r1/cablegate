SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST:  INL TRAINING OF PSD FOR 
HERAT CHIEF PROSECUTOR 
 
 
¶1.  (U) This is a time-sensitive action request; please see 
para 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Background:  In order to comply with Leahy Amendment 
vetting requirements, this cable forwards (in para 5) the 
names and biodata of eight candidates for INL-funded training 
as members of a personal security detail (PSD) for Herat 
Chief Prosecutor Maria Bashir.  The Chief Prosecutor was 
asked to nominate candidates whom she trusts fully.  Chief 
Prosecutor Bashir has received threats, due both to the fact 
she is an Afghan woman in a senior position, and because of 
her prosecution of corruption.  Post therefore is eager to 
have these PSD candidates complete this training as soon as 
possible, so that they can begin to provide Chief Prosecutor 
Bashir protection. 
 
¶3. (U) Action Request:  In light of this background, and 
given the relatively small number of candidates on this list, 
post request that the Department complete its Leahy review of 
the candidates as soon as possible. Post wishes to thank 
Department in advance for its support on this matter. 
 
¶4. (U) INL has conducted in-country vetting and possesses no 
evidence that any of the candidates have committed human 
rights violations.  Post has made a good faith effort to 
ensure that the individuals who provided only one name truly 
have only one name.
