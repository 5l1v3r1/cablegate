Amnesty Law Implementation Moving Forward 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶1. (SBU) Chief Judge (CJ) for Ninewa Province Faisal Sadeeq 
Hadeed told PRToffs March 16 that preparations for 
implementation of the Amnesty Law were well underway in this 
northern province.  CJ Faisal said he had formed committees 
that had already begun receiving and reviewing applications 
for amnesty.  CJ Faisal said there was a 10-day period 
between an application and when the official file was 
required to be presented to the amnesty committee.  The first 
applications were filed on March 6 and the respective files 
had been received.  CJ Faisal expected the amnesty committee 
would eventually be able to handle between 35 and 40 cases 
per day.  CJ Faisal said that he had communicated very little 
with the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) on the implementation of 
this law. 
 
Public Health Concerns Being Addressed 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Separately, the PRT asked CJ Faisal about potential 
health implications of release of prisoners.  PRT helped CJ 
Faisal coordinate with the Iraqi Red Crescent, with the goal 
of conducting a health screening of detainees in jails in 
Ninewa before they are released into the general population. 
Contagious diseases, such as scabies, are rampant in the jail 
population in the province.  CJ Faisal expressed interest in 
continued coordination with the PRT on this issue.  CJ Faisal 
also agreed that the release of prisoners could be delayed a 
few days in order to coordinate treatment of infected 
prisoners but the program needed to be expedited to ensure 
timely release after treatment. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Chief Judge Faisal is moving forward rapidly on 
implementation of the Amnesty Law in Ninewa Province. Given 
the vagueness of the instructions to the courts, it is not 
clear exactly how this law will be interpreted and 
implemented. We will continue to track closely this important 
process. The PRT will also work closely with the Chief Judge 
and the Iraqi Red Crescent to ensure that released detainees 
do not pose a health risk to the general population.
