SUBJECT: GUIDANCE: CONSULTATION ON UNSCR 1701, JULY 9, 
2008 
 
 ¶1. (U) This is an action message.  USUN is authorized to 
draw from the points in para 2 below during consultations on 
the Secretary-General,s report on the implementation of 
UNSCR 1701 scheduled for July 9.  Please see septel for 
further guidance in the event the French delegation 
subsequently tables a draft Presidential Statement welcoming 
and reacting to the SYG,s report.  (Note: We do not 
anticipate that France will table a draft PRST on  July 9.) 
 
¶2. (U) Begin points: 
 
-- I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report 
on UNSC Resolution 1701 on Lebanon.  The United States 
welcomes this report as a positive step towards full 
implementation of all provisions of the resolution.  Today, I 
would like to make four points. 
 
-- First, I would like to take note of the 
Secretary-General,s intention (noted in para 62) to 
strengthen the diplomatic process aimed at expanding UN 
engagement on Sheba,a, and endorse such efforts, in the 
context of full implementation of UNSCR 1701. 
 
-- During her recent visit to Beirut on June 13, Secretary 
Rice noted that Sheba,a should be dealt with as a priority 
and in the context of full implementation of UNSCR 1701. 
 
-- The United States joins the Secretary-General in welcoming 
Prime Minister Siniora,s April 2, 2008 letter on Sheba,a 
farms, in which the Prime Minister cites the UN 
Cartographer,s work on the geographic definition of the 
Sheba,a area as a good basis for discussion. 
 
-- At the same time, we urge both sides to accept UNIFIL's 
plan to deal with the Ghajar area near Sheba,a. 
 
-- Second, the United States supports the normalization of 
Lebanese-Syrian relations, especially the reciprocal 
establishment of embassies and border delineation. 
 
-- Bilateral delineation by Lebanon and Syria of their full 
border remains the optimal step to finding a permanent 
solution to Sheba,a. 
 
-- Third, the United States supports and encourages the 
national dialogue process agreed upon at Doha on May 21. 
This process is critical for achieving the full 
implementation of all aspects of UNSCR 1701, including the 
disarmament of armed groups, Lebanese government control of 
the border, and enforcement of the arms embargo. 
 
-- Finally, I wish to underscore U.S. concern about the 
illegal arms transfers across the Syrian-Lebanese border, in 
particular claims by Hizballah that it has replenished its 
military capacity since the 2006 war.  We fully support the 
Secretary-General,s call for a process to disarm all 
militias in Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council 
resolutions 1559 and 1701 and the Ta,if accords. 
 
-- UNIFIL continues to discover serious weapons caches south 
of the Litani.  During calendar year 2007, UNIFIL discovered 
39 bunkers, 54 rockets, and 277 bombs of various types, all 
of which were turned over to the Lebanese Armed Forces. 
 
-- We applaud the work of UNIFIL in this effort and I would 
like take this opportunity to note in particular Maritime 
UNIFIL,s work, in coordination with the Lebanese Navy, in 
deterring unauthorized arms shipments.  Since assuming its 
mission in October 2006, it has conducted nearly 17,000 ship 
hailings and challenges.  During this period, over 120 
vessels were identified as suspicious and boarded and 
inspected by the Lebanese Navy or customs with UNIFIL 
support. 
 
-- We also urge all sides to renew their support for the 
Secretary-General on the issue of cluster munitions. 
 
-- We reject any attempt to destabilize Lebanon or violate 
its sovereignty. 
 
End points. 
 
¶3. (U) Septel will provide elements for inclusion in a French 
draft PRST on the report in the event one is presented.
