¶1. (SBU) Acehnese government capacity is severely limited and is 
insufficient to absorb the central government budget allocations, 
according to Minister for State-Owned Enterprises and former Aceh 
peace negotiator Sofyan Djalil.  In a January 29 meeting with the 
Ambassador, Djalil said that this capacity-funding gap threatens 
Aceh's longer-term development and undermines the provincial 
government's ability to deliver key public services. (ref A). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Limited government capacity, not insufficient revenue, is 
the key issue for Aceh, according to Minister Djalil.  The 
capacity-funding gap in Aceh is due to the poorly functioning 
bureaucracy in Aceh.  Djalil regarded Governor Irwandi as a smart 
man, but noted that his institutional capacity is weak. 
 
¶3. (U) Aceh provincial government revenue is growing rapidly. 
Despite massive needs, the government is unable to spend the funds 
properly.  In 2007, the provincial budget was $411 million (ref B). 
Aceh was only able to spend around 75% of the budget.  Difficulty 
with budget execution is expected to worsen this year because 
provincial government revenues will double in 2008 to more than $850 
million. There are several reasons for the explosive growth in 
revenue, most notably the special autonomy fund designed to finance 
provincial development as well as Aceh's entitlement to a greater 
share of central government revenues generated within the province. 
The special autonomy funds are to be used to pay for infrastructure 
and development programs over the next 20 years. 
 
Sofyan Djalil Bio Note 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Minister Djalil was the State Minister for Information and 
Communication when the Helsinki Peace Accords were signed.  He and 
Hamid Awaludin were the two Indonesian negotiators of the Helsinki 
MOU. Djalil also played a key intermediary role for the President 
and Vice President during the Aceh Monitoring Mission and was a key 
interlocutor with GAM members. Governor Irwandi and many senior GAM 
members trust him.  Minister Djalil was born in Aceh, but left in 
¶1976.  Many observers view Djalil as among the most reform-minded 
members of SBY's Cabinet.
