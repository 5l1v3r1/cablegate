SUBJECT: JANUARY 31 END OF ORAL DECLARATION CREATES FEW 
PROBLEMS OR BACKUPS AT THE U.S-CANADA LAND BORDER 
 
REF: MEXICO 312 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  The situation along the U.S.-Canada border 
following the January 31 implementation of the requirement 
that U.S. and Canadian citizens show proof of citizenship 
(rather than simply making an oral declaration) was similar 
to that reported in reftel concerning the southern border. 
Most ports of entry reported very high rates of compliance 
with the new documentary requirements.  Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) officers kept lines moving by exercising 
flexibility with non-compliant travelers, giving them a 
verbal admonishment to get documented as well as a tear sheet 
explaining acceptable documentation.  Canadian citizens 
entering the U.S. were highly compliant, perhaps thanks to 
Government of Canada advertisements in local and national 
media and a mass mailing of the new rules to millions of 
homes the week before implementation.  The fact that CBP 
inspectors have been giving all travelers the tear sheet 
since December probably also contributed to awareness and a 
high compliance rate.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) ConGen Halifax reported that ports of entry in its 
district were seeing compliance rates close to 100 percent. 
Halifax notes that most of the residents living along the 
land border were well aware of the tighter documentary 
requirements and have prepared to meet them.  Traffic at the 
ports was not experiencing delays.  ConGen Montreal reported 
high rates of compliance and no delays at ports going into 
New York and Vermont.  The percentage of Americans and 
Canadians presenting passports has increased markedly since 
last summer. 
 
¶3.  (U) Ports south of Ottawa were experiencing at least 95 
percent compliance with no wait, no lines.  ConGen Toronto 
said that CBP and tunnel/bridge operators at the major ports 
in its district are reporting non-events.  Traffic was 
reported moving quickly at Detroit, Sarnia, and Buffalo. 
 
¶4.  (U) In Winnipeg's district, the busiest ports reported 
better than 90 percent compliance and no delays or incidents 
related to the new procedures.  Calgary said that most 
travelers in its district were compliant (and most presented 
passports), but some delays were observed at the biggest port 
of entry going into Montana. 
 
¶5.  (U) Vancouver said that CBP supervisors at the ports of 
entry report no delays or complaints related to the end of 
oral declarations.  They reported close to 100 percent 
compliance and "business as usual." 
 
¶6.  (U) Comment:  The phased-in implementation of the proof 
of citizenship requirement for travelers on the land border, 
just as the phased-in implementation of the passport 
requirement last year for air travelers, seems to have 
avoided the problems and delays many had anticipated.  CBP 
has been able to keep the traffic and trade flowing, while at 
the same time encouraging people to get the required 
documentation.  The purposefully vague ending date for 
phased-in implementation of the proof of citizenship 
requirement will likely spur travelers to get such proof.
