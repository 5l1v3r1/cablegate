DELIVERABLES FOR FCS RIYADH

¶3. In addition to the action plan, the Commercial Office 
will provide the following Commercial Service deliverables 
to FCS Riyadh: 
 
-- Planned Market Research Reports on the oil services and 
equipment markets and trends in the ICT sector. 
-- Fifteen Market Insight Reports (unplanned market research 
reports) 
-- Five Export Successes

---------------------------------------- 
GREATER INTEGRATION INTO THE FCS NETWORK 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. During the recent training visit by the SRCO, the 
Commercial Specialist and Econ/Commercial Officers received 
logons to the Department of Commerce intranet.  Commercial 
Service e-mail addresses and expanded access to the intranet 
site's E-menu tool will facilitate greater coordination with 
FCS Riyadh, and post will consult with that on office on how 
to accomplish this goal. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
SPECIAL CONDITIONS IN YEMEN'S COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. Yemen is a challenging country for commercial services 
due to lack of rule of law, bureaucratic corruption, and an 
undeveloped investment environment.  Nonetheless, post is 
confident that it can successfully carry out the elements of 
this modest strategic plan, and looks forward to working 
with FCS Riyadh and Washington colleagues in this regard. 
Post plans for a comprehensive Commercial Service program 
for Yemen to augment MPP goals for economic reform in the 
coming years.
