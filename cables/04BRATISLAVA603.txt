SUBJECT: THANKS TO KEITH MINES FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH ON IRAQ 
 
 
¶1.  BERT, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR "LENDING" US POLITICAL 
OFFICER KEITH MINES FOR A DAY OF PUBLIC OUTREACH ON HIS 
EXPERIENCES DURING SIX MONTHS IN IRAQ.  HE SPOKE TO A 
VARIETY OF SLOVAK AUDIENCES JUNE 17: THE EMBASSY STAFF, 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THINK TANK MEMBERS AND OPINION MAKERS. 
HE DID A COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW WITH A JOURNALIST FROM ONE 
OF SLOVAKIA'S LEADING DAILY NEWSPAPERS AND MADE A 15-MINUTE 
APPEARANCE ON A LIVE PUBLIC AFFAIRS PROGRAM ON THE 
    TELEVISION STATION TA3, THE SLOVAK CNN.  HE IS A TALENTED 
PUBLIC SPEAKER AND AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL, AND I'M SURE 
YOU WILL MISS HIM WHEN HE DEPARTS BUDAPEST THIS SUMMER. 
 
¶2.  KEITH, LET ME THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR BRINGING YOUR ONE- 
MAN ROAD SHOW TO BRATISLAVA.  IT IS TRUE THAT A PICTURE 
SPEAKS A THOUSAND WORDS, AND ALL YOUR AUDIENCES APPRECIATED 
THE CHANCE TO SEE YOUR SLIDES AND HEAR YOUR FIRST-HAND VIEWS 
ABOUT PROGRESS MADE AND CHALLENGES REMAINING IN IRAQ.  AS 
THE MFA HOST DECLARED, AFTER SEEING DAILY IMAGES OF 
EXPLOSIONS AND ANGER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO SEE THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THE COIN INCLUDING CIVIC LIFE. 
 
WEISER
