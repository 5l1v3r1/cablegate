LICENSE NO. D357531 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 06911 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Eurochim Spb, St. Petersburg, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D357531 
as the ultimate consignee of a Metrohm 716 Dosimat, 
one Metrohm 665 Dosimat, two Perkin-Elmer LC systems, 
one Satoris BP210S, one Perkin-Elmer LC system and one 
Varian 3800 GC with auto-sampler. These items are 
controlled for chemical and biological weapons and 
anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 2B350. The licensee 
is General Electric Co. Plastic Group, One Lexan Lane, 
MT. Vernon, IN 47620. 
 
¶3. On January 31, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Eurochim 
Spb, 14, Kourchatova st., St. Petersburg, Russia. The 
export control team met with Andrei Zinenkov, Senior 
Staff Scientist and Aleksey Sominich, Financial 
Director. 
 
¶4. Eurochim was founded in 1992 as a a research 
laboratory for processing of waste products of 
petrochemical production.  Currently the main 
concentration of the business is the distribution of 
tires, and the company partners with international 
tire companies such as Continental, Goodyear and 
Michelin.  The company also imports and exports both 
raw materials and finished petrochemical and rubber 
products.  Eurochim estimates 25,000,000 USD in annual 
turnover, with imports accounting for 5,000,000 USD, 
and exports for 20,000,000 USD.  The company is also a 
full-service provider of heavy equipment to chemical, 
petrochemical and oil-refining industrial enterprises. 
Eurochim has a research and development laboratory on 
premesis, with 25 full-time engineers and three PhD 
Candidates on staff.  The company employs 300, and 
maintains offices, laboratories and warehouses on a 
large industrial facility in St. Petersburg. 
 
¶5. The equipment in reftel is currently in the custody 
of a Customs Warehouse.  Due to strict import 
regulations, Russian Customs will hold certain dual- 
use equipment for import certification.  The last pump 
system imported under USDOC license took six months to 
clear customs in St. Petersburg.  Eurochim and GE are 
in close negotiations with the Russian Customs Service 
to ensure delivery of the commodities. 
 
¶6. When delivered, Eurochim plans on installing the 
system described in reftel in the laboratory. The 
laboratory has around the clock security, with an 
electronic surveillance system. Mr. Zinenkov gave a 
tour of the laboratory facilities, and identified for 
the team all U.S. origin equipment.  Digital 
photographs of the systems and equipment were taken, 
and are available from post upon request. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: While post recommends Eurochim 
Spb, St. Petersburg, Russia as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities, the finding is 
limited as the equipment in reftel was still in 
Customs custody. Post considers the matter closed 
unless BIS cables with further instructions.
