REF: SECSTATE 99472 
 
¶1. (SBU) We visited the office of Elsan Defense and 
Communications (reftel) and met with Murat Unluturk (vice 
president for contracts) and Ambassador (retired) A. Hikmet 
Alp (senior advisor) on November 23.  Unluturk told us that 
the company does not engage in manufacturing or storage of US 
Munitions List items, and is not a distributor of such 
equipment.  Rather, Elsan's core business is to serve as an 
intermediary for U.S. and Turkish defense firms to identify 
opportunities for U.S. clients in the Turkish market and to 
help the Turkish armed forces and Turkish defense companies 
locate sources and partners for defense-related projects. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Unluturk, Elsan was founded in 1983. 
The company is registered with and licensed by the Ministry 
of Commerce to engage in business activities.  The company 
has registered with PM/DTCC since at least 2004, according to 
Unluturk, and its registration has been renewed on an annual 
basis since.  In addition to founder and chairman Osman 
Mayatepek, principal officers in the company include: 
 
- Mr. Ersoy Volkan (CEO and CFO) 
- Ambassador (retired) Ali Hikmet Alp (senior advisor to the 
chairman) 
- Murat Unluturk (Contracts Vice President) 
- Deniz Findik (Administrative Manager) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Elsan's U.S. clients include Boeing, Pratt and 
Whitney, Force Protection, Global Seating Systems, Hydraulics 
International, and Delex Systems.  The company also has 
clientele from Canada, Jordan, Israel and the Czech Republic, 
although, Unluturk stressed, its relationship with non-U.S. 
companies never involves USML items.  Unluturk underscored 
that the company only deals with established Turkish defense 
firms, the Turkish Armed Forces and the Ministry of National 
Defense on USML items. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The company relocated its office in September 2009 
and its new contact information is as follows: 
 
Iran Caddesi 47/4-5 
Ankara 06700 Turkey 
Tel: (90) 312-428-8812 
Fax: (90) 312-428-8801 
Website: www.elsangroup.com 
 
¶5. (SBU) The company representatives were cooperative and 
answered all of our questions related to the company and are 
open to answering any additional questions.  Based on the 
information presented in the meeting we believe that the 
company is a bona fides company authorized to engage in 
defense-related activities.
