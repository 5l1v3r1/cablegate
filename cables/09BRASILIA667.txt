¶1.  (U)  Summary.  In response to the May 25 DPRK nuclear 
test, Brazil is indefinitely postponing sending its 
Ambassador-designate to Pyongyang to open the Brazilian 
embassy (reftels).  The Ministry of External Relations (MRE) 
issued an uncharacteristically strong note in which it 
"vehemently condemns" the test, states that it violates UNSCR 
1718, calls on the DPRK to observe a strict test moratorium, 
and appeals to all members of the six-party talks to avoid 
taking any aggravating steps. End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) According to media reports citing MRE sources, 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim ordered Brazil,s 
Ambassador-designate Arnaldo Carrilho not travel to Pyongyang 
until further notice because of Brazil,s displeasure over 
the DPRK nuclear test on May 25.  There was no official 
statement from the MRE about the delay, and press reports 
said Carrilho is in Beijing making final preparations to go 
to Pyongyang to open Brazil,s embassy during the week of May 
¶25.  Brazil decided last year to open an embassy in 
Pyongyang; North Korea has had an embassy in Brasilia since 
at least 2004.  High level contacts are rare and trade 
between the two countries is minimal, although the DPRK 
foreign minister met with FM Amorim in Brasilia on May 8 
(septel). 
¶3.  (U) The text of the MRE press release (unofficial Embassy 
translation):

Note 238, May 25, 2009 
North Korean Nuclear Test 
The Brazilian government vehemently condemns the nuclear test 
carried out by the People,s Republic of Korea, today, May 
¶25.  The test violates Resolution 1718, adopted by the United 
Nations Security Council on October 14, 2006.  Brazil 
expresses its hopes that the DPRK will rejoin, as quickly as 
possible and as a non-nuclear armed country, the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
In the same manner, the government of Brazil calls on the 
DPRK to sign, in the shortest term possible, the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to observe strictly the 
nuclear test moratorium.  Brazil hopes, also, that the DPRK 
will return, in a constructive spirit, to the Six-Party 
Talks, aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, 
and appeals to all parties to abstain from acts that could 
aggravate tensions in regional and global contexts. (End). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment.  Brazil has been cautiously and gradually 
upgrading its relations with the DPRK (reftels), and the 
unusually strong MRE response suggests the nuclear test has 
stopped Brazil in its tracks.  Given Brazil,s repeated 
public and private avowals of respect for UN and especially 
UNSC decisions, Brazil now has no practical alternative -- 
despite its inclination to avoid controversial stands -- but 
to suspend further development of its relationship with the 
DPRK.
