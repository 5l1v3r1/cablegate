Comment 
------- 
7.(SBU) From post's and the GOS' point of view, the visit was 
very successful.  As this was the first visit of a member of 
President Obama's Cabinet, it was very important to the GOS, 
as shown by Minister Blanco's offer of a meeting with 
President Zapatero, who almost never receives foreign cabinet 
ministers.  With European parliamentary elections a week 
away, the GOS was eager for any favorable statements it could 
get from a member of the Administration, and it ensured 
thorough press coverage.  The Secretary's statements praising 
the GOS and the AVE were widely reported, including leading 
the evening television news on May 29.  The Secretary's 
invitation to Minister Blanco to join the delegation for an 
informal dinner helped strengthen our relationship with one 
of President Zapatero's closest political allies, who has 
been critical of the USG in the past.  During the dinner, 
Zapatero called Blanco to enthuse about favorable press 
coverage of the visit.  In addition to the political aspects 
of the visit, GOS officials are genuinely proud of the AVE 
and pleased that it is being studied by U.S. officials.  They 
hope that U.S. interest in the AVE will lead to greater 
bilateral cooperation in both directions (they are interested 
in learning from our experience with cargo rail) as well as 
business opportunities for Spanish companies.
