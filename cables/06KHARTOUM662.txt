¶1.  SUMMARY:  UN Special Representative Jan Pronk urged 
Darfur rebels and the Government to focus on the Abuja talks, 
not Tripoli back-channels, during a March 15 press 
conference, though he warned that the AU,s recent ceasefire 
proposal was "not good enough."  Pronk declared he was ready 
to receive a UN peacekeeping1 planning assessment team, 
although a decision would not be made until the Security 
Council meets on March 21.  He also expressed his frustration 
with the Eastern Front -- which once again refused to meet 
with him -- and reviewed progress on CPA implementation.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Road to Peace Starts in Abuja, not Tripoli 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  UN Special Representative in Sudan Jan Pronk told 
reporters in Khartoum on March 15 that "the only place to 
negotiate peace in Darfur was Abuja," and urged all parties 
to take specific negotiating steps to reach a real ceasefire. 
 Responding to a question about recent meetings in Tripoli 
between Vice President Ali Osman Taha, SLA Chairman Mini 
Minawi, and JEM Chief Khalil Ibrahim, Pronk stressed that 
"the AU is the only game in town," and parties "have to 
negotiate in Abuja." 
 
¶3.  However, Pronk warned that a partial agreement -- like 
the AU,s "Enhanced Humanitarian Ceasefire" proposal -- was 
"not good enough."  "Even if it were to be accepted, it would 
just be like another N,Djamena Agreement," because it would 
allow only the delivery of humanitarian relief, not the 
return of the displaced to their villages, he continued. 
Moreover, a UN peacekeeping force would be "doomed to fail" 
without a comprehensive agreement respected by all parties. 
 
UN Planning Assessment Team:  Will They Come? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Pronk said he expected the Secretary General to send a 
peacekeeping planning assessment team "sometime in March," 
and emphasized that "we are ready to receive it" (Ref B). But 
he also noted that "consultation with the government was 
necessary," and did not expect to begin the process until 
after he presents his quarterly report to the Security 
Council on March 21.  In response to press reports that the 
Government had already refused to accept an assessment team, 
Pronk urged forbearance until the Security Council meets next 
week.  "Let's not talk too much, and we,ll leave it those 
who will make a decision." 
 
Disappointed in Eastern Front 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Pronk also noted that he had a three-hour discussion with 
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki during his March 13 visit 
to Asmara, but declined to provide details (Refs A, B). 
However, he declared he was "quite disappointed" with leaders 
of the Eastern Front, who failed to show up for their 
appointment -- the second time, Pronk noted in frustration, 
that the Eastern Front had stood him up.  "They have to agree 
to talk; if not, they will have to find solutions on the 
ground." 
 
CPA Implementation:  CPC Meeting, Abyei Attack, IDPs 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶6.  Pronk then turned to the implementation of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).  He reported that the 
Ceasefire Political Commission (CPC) had held its first 
meeting in February, after eight months of delay, and would 
hold its second meeting at the end of March.  The atmosphere 
during the first meeting had been "very good," and he was 
hopeful the CPC could begin dealing with a number of 
substantive issues.  However, he was very concerned by the 
last week's attack on a convoy of unarmed SSDF returnees last 
week in Abyei, which he considered "a serious violation" of 
the CPA.  When pressed to identify who he thought was 
responsible for the attack, Pronk declined to answer, though 
he admitted to having "some suspicions." 
 
¶7.  Finally, Pronk announced that the Khartoum wali had made 
a "firm commitment" to the UN and several senior diplomats on 
March 14 that no more IDPs would be deported from Khartoum 
against their will.  "There will be no more forced 
relocations," Pronk said definitively.  He also noted that he 
had asked a UN agency, UN-HABITAT, to begin working on urban 
poverty relief projects in the capital.
