DPA: D-Day and the First Week 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council has 
designated May 16 as D-Day, and the Darfur Peace Agreement 
(DPA) officially enters into force at 18:00 GMT on that day. 
Required activities for the first week (up to D 7) include:

soldiers (D-Day), cessation of hostilities (D 3), 
reconstitution of Cease-Fire Commission at Force Headquarters 
(D 3), establishment of the implementation team (D 5), 
establishment of the Logistics Coordination Committee (D 5), 
development of the sensitization strategy and dissemination 
of the DPA (D 5), development of a plan for policing party 
Control Areas, Buffer and Demilitarized Zones (D 6), 
preparations for Phases I-III (D 7), and establishment of 
sector cease fire sub-commissions (D 7). 
 
----------------------------------------- 
INGOs Consider Pulling Out of West Darfur 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) INGOs continue to face security concerns in West 
Darfur.  On May 15, Save the Children reported that a convoy 
was ambushed at 14:00 local, and their team was robbed at 
gunpoint.  Meanwhile, in the Riyad camp, the Humanitarian 
Assistance Comission's (HAC) office was burned down by 
residents of the camp.  Although no one was hurt in either 
case, many INGOs had already been discussing leaving West 
Darfur before these incidents. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Kutum Sees First Janjaweed Attack Since DPA 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) The newspapers are reporting the first attack 
attributed to the Janjaweed since the signing of the DPA. 
According to reports, around 500 Janjaweed attacked villages 
in the area of Kutum, North Darfur, killing 15 and taking 
1,000 heads of cattle.  The SAF is working to control the 
situation, and the AU has already begun its investigation.

CDA Host Diplomatic Core on DPA 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On May 15, the Charge d'Affaires (CDA) hosted a 
meeting of twenty members of the diplomatic corps to discuss 
the DPA.  The general consensus was that Abdel Wahid must 
sign the agreement in order to get the support of the Fur, 
the largest single ethnic group, but stigmatizing those who 
have not signed risks closing the door for future agreement. 
Currently, there is a lack of good information, with 
disinformation and opposition mounting.  Information must be 
disseminated widely, quickly, and thoroughly, perhaps through 
radio.  There was some concern about the possibility of using 
radio, considering the UN's difficulty in getting permission 
to broadcast messages in support of the CPA.  Many felt that 
the government's ability and willingness to implement the DPA 
is limited by its hesitancy to antagonize Arab groups, many 
of whom believe the DPA works against them.  This includes 
the fears of creating a "greater Zagahwa nation" that 
includes parts of Chad and Libya. 
 
------------------------ 
Darfur Leaders Speak-Out 
------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On May 16, a group of Darfurian leaders came to the 
Embassy to discuss the DPA with the CDA.  The leaders, who 
represented a range of ethnic groups and political parties, 
said the primary demand was adequate individual compensation 
before Darfurians will support the agreement.  The Charge 
explained that the international community cannot assist with 
individual compensation, which is estimated at over USD 600 
million if USD 1,000 is given to every family, but that the 
international community is standing by to help provide the 
resources each family needs to recover and return to a normal 
life.  This cannot be done, however, until there is peace and 
security.

¶7.  (SBU) All agreed that the Darfur-Darfur dialogue could 
succeed in promoting reconciliation if it were done properly 
and led by a neutral party.  They said that they did not 
trust the Government of Sudan to be fair, and they thought 
the African Union has lost all credibility.  The CDA 
responded that the AU is the best mechanism available to 
them, and that the international community will work to make 
it a success. The Darfurians should also look at ways to 
strengthen the AU rather than simply say it does not work. 
With regards to power sharing, group members expressed 
reservations about the lack of a vice-president position, and 
were afraid that selected officials  would not represent all 
Darfurians.  The Charge explained that the best way to 
address these concerns was to work within the agreement and 
find a genuine leader who could gain trust outside of ethnic 
divides.

U.S. Invited to Meeting with Leaders Considering DPA 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) During a visit to El Fasher, Embassy POLOFF was 
approached by an employee of the Sudanese Development 
Organization (SUDO) who said that there will be a meeting of 
SLA commanders who have not signed the DPA on May 18 in the 
Northern Sudan town of Hamaraia.  He said that the leaders 
were "confused" about the DPA but were keeping an open mind, 
and that a U.S. representative would be welcome.  Attendees 
would include Jar Anlabi, a Zaghawa SLA Field Commander; 
Suleiman Marajan, a Midoub SLA commander; Suleiman Jamoos, 
who recently defected to the SLA from the Turabi's Popular 
Congress Party (PCP); and Osman Bushra, an SLA commander 
based in Libya.  Also expected at the meeting were two 
opponents of the accord, SLA commander Dr. Sharif Harir and 
JEM leader Khalil Ibrahim.  Post has declined this invitation 
because of security concerns.
