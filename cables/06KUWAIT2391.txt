-- Political Science professor and former dean of the American 
University in Kuwait Dr. Shafiq Nazim Al-Ghabra editorialized in 
moderate Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam under the title "Iran on the 
scale": "It is difficult to conclude that Iran is facing a time of 
unrest. To the contrary, Iran is now living a period of national 
stability and that is due to the harmony between Iran's government 
and the republic's religious leader. This stability is contingent 
upon current high oil prices, the power of the executive authority, 
and the nature of the strife with the United States. As a matter of 
fact, the confrontation with the U.S. strengthens the influence of 
the conservative groups in Iran. Iran is utilizing the conflict with 
the U.S. over its nuclear program to distract America's attention 
from other issues in Iran such as human rights, and the legitimacy 
of the republic's religious leader."
