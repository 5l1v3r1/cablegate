REF: NAIROBI 2444 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Somali media outlets have uniformly expressed revulsion at 
the December 3 suicide bombing in Mogadishu that took the lives of 
three TFG ministers, seriously injured a fourth, and killed more 
than a dozen others attending a medical school graduation.  Some of 
the Media are suggesting that the extremists' attack on the students 
and their families was perhaps a step too far. Post continues to 
underscore U.S. government outrage at the attack in its contacts 
with the Somali media.  End summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Uniform Disgust, 
Varying Focal Points 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Most Somali media reaction to the December 3 suicide blast in 
Mogadishu has focused on the deaths of the three Transitional 
Federal Government (TFG) ministers.  BBC's Somali Service noted that 
the three assassinated ministers were prominent and in frequent 
contact with the Somalia public. Many reports noted that the 
ministers were well-respected and were accomplishing much good work 
on the ground. Some reports faulted the TFG for failing to secure 
the venue of the graduation, given that such a high concentration of 
senior government officials was present.  Other reports noted that 
the attack was a shock to the country's beleaguered educational 
system, as two of the ministers were veteran educationists who 
represented the future of education in Somalia. 
 
¶3. (U) Another area of focus was on the students, for whom the 
graduation ceremony was being held.  BBC's Somali Service noted that 
this event honored students who had managed to persevere through 
years of conflict to complete their studies, only to die on their 
happiest day.  Virtually all outlets noted the sad irony:  that 
these youth were killed as they were preparing to begin their 
careers as doctors in a country desperately short of medical 
professionals. 
 
¶4. (U) Somali journalists have focused on the loss of at least two 
of their colleagues in the blast. Somali journalist organizations 
including the Somali Coalition for Freedom of Expression (SOCFEX), 
the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), and the Somali 
Journalists Rights Agency (SOJRA) have issued press statements 
lamenting the deaths of the journalists who died in the attack. In 
addition, many international journalist organizations, to include 
the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the International 
Federation of Journalists (IFJ), both of which have relationships 
with the Somali journalist unions, issued statements condemning the 
attack and highlighting the loss of the journalists. 
 
¶5. (U) VOA's Somali Service interviewed a well-known Somali-American 
religious elder who condemned the bombing and stated that it went 
against the basic teachings of Islam.  Most outlets have carried the 
various international statements issued after the bombing, as well 
as TFG President Sharif's statement and the Prime Minister's 
comments to the media.

Post's Outreach 
to Somali Media 
-------------- 
 
¶6. (U) On December 3, the Embassy joined the EU, AMISOM, IGAD, the 
League of Arab States, Norway, and the UN, in issuing a statement 
that condemned the attacks.  We have also done an interview on a 
Somali radio station, and will continue to conduct interviews in the 
coming days.  There is a high level of interest among Somalis in the 
international community's reaction to this event.
