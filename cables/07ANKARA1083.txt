SUBJECT: TURKISH PARLIAMENT HOLDS RAUCOUS DEBATE OVER 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROPOSAL 
 
REF: ANKARA 1071 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (U) After contentious debate on May 7, parliament held the 
first round of voting on a controversial constitutional 
amendment package to move toward direct presidential 
elections, with 361 MPs voting in favor.  A required second 
vote is scheduled for May 10.  The ruling Justice and 
Development Party (AKP) wants to send the package to 
President Sezer with at least 367 votes supporting.  Sezer is 
expected either to withhold action until parliament recesses 
or veto the proposal.  The parliamentary debate was 
particularly raucous, reflecting the current tense political 
atmosphere.  Many deputies would prefer to leave changes of 
this magnitude to the next parliament.  Turkey's influential 
business association, TUSIAD, recently issued a statement to 
the same effect. 
 
¶2. (U) AKP has suspended a separate constitutional amendment 
package that would lower candidate's age from 30 to 25 and 
put independent candidates' names on the main ballot instead 
of separate slips.  Parliament approved the proposal in the 
first round of voting on May 6 but has cancelled the required 
second round.  Although AKP and opposition parties support 
the changes, the package was shelved for procedural reasons 
related to when candidates must declare. 
 
¶3. (U) Still unresolved is whether parliament can continue to 
conduct business.  Some argue that parliament can keep 
working so long as the presidential election process 
continues.  Others maintain that parliament will recess 
closer to May 15, the constitutionally mandated end of the 
presidential election process.  Parliament's Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chair said, without hesitation, May 17.  Other AKP 
MPs told us they plan to conduct business until June 4, when 
candidate lists will be finalized and candidates will hit the 
campaign trail full-time. 
 
¶4. (U) With parliamentary elections set for July 22, the 
election calendar clock is ticking.  Civil servants planning 
to run must resign by COB May 8.  Potential candidates are 
busy lobbying party leaders, who must submit their candidate 
lists to the Supreme Election Board by June 8.  AKP 
reportedly cautioned some senior officials and mayors, 
including PM Erdogan's Foreign Policy Advisor Ahmet 
Davutoglu, to consult with the party before resigning.  As 
required by the constitution, the GOT replaced three key 
ministers with independent technocrats on May 8: Justice U/S 
Fahri Kasirga will serve as Justice Minister; Kayseri 
Governor Osman Gunes will serve as Interior Minister; and 
Maritime Affairs U/S Amet Yilmaz will act as Transportation 
Minister.
