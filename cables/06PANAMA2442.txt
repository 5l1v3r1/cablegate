REFORMS 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR WILLIAM EATON FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)
PRESIDENT TORRIJOS TO SEEK MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH
‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
¶1. (C) President Torrijos plans to visit the United States
in February and may seek an appointment with President Bush,
Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro told the Ambassador
December 27. The most likely day for the meeting request
with President Bush is February 26, the same day Torrijos is
scheduled to meet with Defense Secretary Gates, said Lewis.
Torrijos also plans to visit College Station on February 28.
TORRIJOS TRIP TO CUBA
‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
¶2. (C) Lewis indicated that President Torrijos planned to
travel to Cuba January 4‐6, where has requested meetings with
both Fidel and Raul Castro. Torrijos will be accompanying
his daughter to Cuba for physical therapy.
LEWIS ON FUTURE OF PRD AND HIMSELF
‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
¶3. (C) Current Housing Minister Balbina Herrera will run for
president of the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD)
in the 2007 internal party elections, said Lewis. Herrera's
bid for party president is a move to "edge out" and lessen
the influence of former Panamanian President Perez Balladares
and current Panama City mayor Juan Carlos Navarro in the
run‐up to the 2009 presidential elections, he said. In
particular, Lewis appeared hopeful that Herrera's position as
PRD president would avoid the appearance of Navarro as heir
apparent for the presidential election. Lewis said they
would have to "play this carefully" as Herrera's plans are
not yet public knowledge.
¶4. (C) Lewis told the Ambassador he may well step down as
Foreign Minister (while still maintaining the first vice
president position), "but not imminently." He said it is
still too early and the timing is not right for him to step
down now. (Comment: Although Lewis did not mention any
specific timeframe, he gave subtle indications that it would
be within the next six months, possibly after the internal
party elections. End Comment.)
REFORMS

¶5. (C) Lewis said plans are to move ahead with the creation
of the Sala V (an added group of three Supreme Court
justices). The GOP plans to convene an extraordinary session
of the National Assembly in January to approve the formation
of the Sala V and hopes to start appointing additional
justices in January or February, added Lewis. He said this
would help change the balance of power in the notoriously
corrupt Supreme Court by bringing in respected apolitical
figures similar to those appointed previously appointed by
Torrijos. He also mentioned ongoing attempts to reform the
Judicial Technical Police (PTJ). The PTJ is "rotten to the
core," said Lewis. He acknowledged the courts' opposition to
bringing the PTJ under control of the Executive, but said
reform was necessary.
