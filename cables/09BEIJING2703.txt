¶1. (U) Summary: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. 
CDC) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
and the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shanghai 
CDC) are collaborating on preparations for the World Expo 2010, 
including, developing a health security action plan and establishing 
a Shanghai Center for Field Epidemiology.  This is the first direct 
sub-national collaboration for the U.S. CDC.  Uniquely, this 
collaborative model only requires direct costs for each partner 
versus the traditional model of U.S. Government technical and 
financial assistance for cooperative projects.  This will help 
facilitate mutual technical exchange between the two agencies.  As 
the Chinese Government increases funding for improved public health 
capacity, we expect to expand this partnership model. End Summary. 
 
 
U.S. CDC technical assistance to Shanghai CDC for World Expo 2010 
public health preparedness 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. (U) Shanghai estimates 70 million visitors (60 million Chinese 
and 10 million foreigners) from approximately 190 countries and 
territories are expected to visit Shanghai, China for the World Expo 
2010 from May 1 to October 31, 2010. In order to best prepare public 
health measures during the World Expo, the Shanghai CDC requested, 
in July 2008, assistance from experts at U.S. CDC to help develop a 
health security action plan.  A Public Health Safety Action Plan was 
developed and a variety of technical assistance activities occurred 
over the past year to meet defined needs. In addition, U.S. CDC in 
China hired an All-hazards coordinator to help meet China's growing 
demand for emergency preparedness technical assistance. 
 
 
June 2008 Joint CDC-Shanghai CDC Needs Assessment Conclusions 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In June 2008, a team of fourteen U.S. CDC experts from its 
headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia and the U.S. Embassy, Beijing - CDC 
Section, conducted a needs assessment with Shanghai CDC.  This 
assessment determined the primary threats to and preparedness 
measures needed for a safe and healthy World Expo 2010.  During this 
session, an action plan was prepared.  It included capacity building 
activities on the following topics: 
* Risk assessment for man-made disasters and natural disasters; 
* Emergency preparedness and response including incident command 
systems; 
* Risk communication and communication strategies; 
* Food safety field investigation and response; 
* Surveillance systems for communicable and non-communicable 
diseases; 
* Immunization strategies; 
* Environmental health issues; and, 
* Program monitoring and evaluation. 
 
Development of Shanghai Center for Field Epidemiology 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4.  (U) Shanghai CDC and U.S. CDC are establishing a Shanghai Center 
for Field Epidemiology.  This center will follow the general model 
of the Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) developed by the 
U.S. CDC and exemplified by the domestic Epidemic Intelligence 
Service training program.  FETPs are currently active in 35 
countries including China.  The U.S. CDC has also helped 24 country 
FETPs transition into self-sustained programs worldwide. 
 
¶5. (U) Pending the availability of funds in fiscal year (FY) 2010 
 
BEIJING 00002703  002 OF 002 
 
 
and Chief of Mission approval, the U.S. CDC will assign an expert 
advisor to support the Shanghai Center for Field Epidemiology to 
help develop the FETP. In June, 2009, several experts from U.S. CDC 
including the All-hazards emergency coordinator in China attended a 
meeting in Shanghai to develop program plans. Shanghai CDC has 
dedicated donations from the private sector totalling 5 million RMB 
($735,000) for the first three years' cooperation for the Shanghai 
Center for Field Epidemiology. A draft three year action plan has 
already been developed and is under review by partners.  The first 
three cohorts (one hundred officers) have been tested and selected 
from different level CDCs in Shanghai.  They likely will start their 
training in early 2010.  The first cohort officers are expected to 
be responsible for public health security during the 2010 World 
Expo.
