1.(SBU) Summary. Dr. Nyoman Kandun, Director General for Diseases 
Control and Environmental Health convened the first Government of 
Indonesia (GOI) interagency meeting on September 22 to discuss 
Tangerang pilot project implementation.  USDA sponsored a three- 
day seminar on biosecurity and disease surveillance in wet 
markets in Tangerang municipality from September 18-20.  As of 
September 25, NAMRU-2 and MOH laboratories have confirmed two 
additional (both fatal) human AI cases since reftel.  Updated 
data from NAMRU-2 and the Ministry of Health (MOH) show 67 human 
AI cases in Indonesia with 51 fatalities. End Summary. 
 
Tangerang Trilateral Project Update 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) On September 22, Dr. Nyoman Kandun convened a planning 
meeting for the Tangerang pilot project that included strong GOI 
participation from the Tangerang Municipality, the Ministries of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU), Agriculture, Health, and the National AI 
Committee.  Representatives from the Mission and Singaporean 
Embassy attended the session.  The GOI provided an overview of AI 
related activities (training and public awareness) that they have 
already implemented in Tangerang.  DEPLU officials reported that 
a Singapore-Indonesia Letter of Intent (LOI) is nearly complete, 
and suggested that the U.S. might wish to develop a LOI of its 
own since Tangerang municipality operates under a different 
authority than Jakarta.  DEPLU officials noted that they would 
study existing umbrella agreements with the US before making a 
final recommendation. 
 
¶3. (U) MOH officials reported that they would convene a separate 
meeting with the Ministry of Finance to establish a mechanism for 
Singaporean reimbursement for the project.  We continued to push 
for a designated GOI project lead, establishment of the working 
committees, and stronger National AI committee involvement in 
coordinating the project.  Dr. Nyoman noted that as soon as the 
GOI finalizes the reimbursement mechanism, GOI would hire staff 
for the Tangerang project and convene working committees. 
 
Wet Market Seminar Heavily Subscribed 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) USDA sponsored a three-day seminar covering biosecurity 
and disease surveillance in wet markets in Tangerang municipality 
from September 18-20.  Seminar organizers ran a plenary session 
for an audience of sixty participants, targeting government and 
industry officials, followed by smaller workshops for poultry 
producers, slaughterhouse operators, and government workers. 
Speakers from national and international human and animal health 
organizations discussed factors that influence the presence of 
H5N1 and HPAI at the market level.  High interest in the sessions 
necessitated wait listing and turning away participants.  USDA 
plans similar workshops in the future to meet demand. 
 
NAMRU-2 Human AI Case Profile 
------------------------------- 
 
 
JAKARTA 00011842  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) NAMRU-2 reports two new (both fatal) cases of human H5N1 
infection since reftel. On September 22, NAMRU-2 and MOH 
laboratories confirmed H5N1 infection in an 11-year-old 
Indonesian male who died on September 18 at a hospital in 
Tulungagung, East Java.  On September 24, NAMRU-2 also confirmed 
H5N1 infection in a nine year-old male from South Jakarta who 
died at the Infectious Disease Hospital on September 22. Local 
health officials reported both boys had contact with dead 
chickens near their homes. 
 
¶6. (SBU) NAMRU-2 data indicates the following AI-related case 
profile as of September 25: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or serology) 
human AI cases: 67, of which 51 have been fatal (case fatality 
rate of 76 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases 2, with 1 death (fatality rate of 
50 percent). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting analysis at the U.S. CDC: 2. 
 
-- Number of possible untested AI cases under investigation (last 
30 days): approximately 35. 
 
Note: NAMRU-2 data corresponds with MOH data but may vary at 
times with AI case figures presented on the official World Health 
Organization (WHO) website, which usually lags NAMRU-2 data by 
one week.  The WHO website, last updated on September 19, notes 
65 human AI cases in Indonesia with 49 deaths.  WHO figures can 
be accessed at www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza.
