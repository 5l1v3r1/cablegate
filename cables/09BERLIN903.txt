¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 infections in Germany rose 
by 461 cases to a total of 3,810 on July 28. The majority of 
new infections occurred abroad, mainly during travel to Spain. 
Information available to German companies on pandemic 
planning.  RKI warns of "H1N1 parties".  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  At its July 28 press briefing, the National Reference 
Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
announced 461 new (laboratory and non-laboratory) confirmed 
cases of H1N1.  This increases the total number of H1N1 cases 
to 3,810.  New cases were distributed among the federal 
states: North Rhine-Westphalia (196), Lower-Saxony (114), 
Bavaria (47), Baden-Wuerttemberg (31), Berlin (17), Rhineland- 
Palatinate (10), Saxony (8), Schleswig-Holstein (7), 
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (7), Thuringia (7), Bremen (7), Hamburg 
(4) and Brandenburg (3) and Hesse (3). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, the increase in the number of 
infections is mainly due to people returning from travel 
abroad (384 new cases), with most of them reportedly infected 
while in Spain.  Newly confirmed cases include laboratory- 
confirmed cases of H1N1 as well as non-laboratory-confirmed 
cases, mainly from people who have showed symptoms after being 
in contact with a patient who has been tested positive at a 
labor for the new virus.  So far, all cases are reportedly 
mild. 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) remains the German state 
with the highest number of virus cases among all German states 
with a total of 1405 (37 percent of German cases), followed by 
Lower-Saxony (795) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (375 cases).  Less 
than 24 percent (879) of all confirmed infections in Germany 
have resulted from domestic transmission. 
 
 
Information Available to German companies on Pandemic Planning 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶5. (U)  The Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster 
Assistance (BBK) in cooperation with the health ministry of 
Baden-Wuerttemberg published a H1N1 handbook for German 
companies giving references to self protection, protection of 
employees and internal pandemic planning.  Guided by check 
lists and background information, the handbook supports 
companies in the development of company internal emergency 
action plans. (http://www.bbk.bund.de).  As previously 
reported in Ref 884, some German companies are already 
preparing for the pandemic and taking precautionary measures 
to protect employees against the virus.  The German Chamber of 
Commerce and Trade, IHK, has now called on all German 
companies to take actions and prepare for a flu outbreak and 
thus avoid a breakdown of the German economy. 
 
 
RKI Warns of "H1N1 Parties" 
-------------------------- 
¶6. (U)   RKI vice president Reinhard Burger warned of so- 
called H1N1 parties where people gather together to purposely 
get infected with the new virus in the hope to build up an 
immunization for fall.  He cautioned that everything speaks 
against that a mild course of the virus will guarantee an 
immunization against the new flu.  Currently, RKI sees no need 
for panic.  Despite an increase of a few hundred cases per 
day, there is still no mass spread of the virus in Germany 
yet, Burger said.
