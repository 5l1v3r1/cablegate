IN SIX YEARS

¶1. (U) Summary.  Canadian courts have sentenced one key participant 
in the "Toronto 18" terror plot to life imprisonment and another to 
twelve years, but they will be eligible for parole in 2016 and 
2011, respectively, partly due to Canadian sentencing policies that 
give double credit for pretrial detention.  The government is 
likely to re-introduce legislation to eliminate the double credit 
for pretrial custody in the next session of the House of Commons. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Twenty-four-year-old Zakaria Amara, identified by 
prosecutors as the ringleader of the "Toronto 18" terror plots and 
who pled guilty in October 2009, was sentenced to life in prison on 
January 18.  However, under Canadian sentencing law he will be 
eligible for parole in 2016.  Co-conspirator Saad Gaya, 22, who 
pled guilty in September 2009, was sentenced the same day to 12 
years in prison, but will be eligible for parole in 18 months after 
being given double credit for pretrial custody. 
 
¶3. (U) Amara admitted to recruiting people, helping to lead a 
terrorist training camp, creating remote-controlled detonators, and 
purchasing three tons of what he thought was ammonium nitrate 
fertilizer for truck bombs.  Gaya, a university student, was 
arrested in a police sting while unloading a delivery truck filled 
with three tons of a harmless substance substituted for the 
fertilizer.  He had been selected by the group's leaders to drive 
one of the bomb-laden trucks to its target. 
 
¶4. (U) Dissatisfied with the comparatively light sentence of at 
least one "Toronto 18" defendant, Crown prosecutors are appealing 
the sentencing of Saad Khalid, who on September 3, 2009 received 14 
years.  Credit for pretrial detention in Khalid's case 
significantly reduced the time he will serve in prison.  In filing 
the notice of appeal, Crown prosecutors stated that the sentence 
did not fit the "gravity of the offense and the culpability of the 
offender." 
 
¶5. (U) Since the initial arrests of 18 Toronto-area men in 2006 for 
a plot to carry out terrorist attacks in Southern Ontario to 
protest Canada's military presence in Afghanistan, the following 
have been convicted: 
 
a) Nishanthan Yogakrishnan, 21, was convicted in September 2008 and 
sentenced to 30 months on May 22.  Given credit for time-served, he 
has already been released; 
 
b) Ali Mohamed Dirie, 26, pled guilty on September 21 to 
participating in the activities of a terrorist group; he received a 
seven-year sentence and will receive double credit for time in 
pretrial detention; 
 
c) Saad Khalid, 23, was sentenced to 14 years in prison on 
September 4 and will receive double credit for time in pretrial 
detention; 
 
d) Saad Gaya, 21, pled guilty on September 28 and was sentenced to 
12 years; 
 
e) Zakaria Amara, 23, pled guilty on October 8 and was sentenced on 
January 18 to life in prison. 
 
Of the remaining members of the "Toronto 18" terror plot arrested 
in 2006, one man's trial began last week and five others face trial 
in March.  They cannot be identified due to an ongoing publication 
ban.  Charges against the other seven members were either stayed or 
dismissed. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  The life sentence for Amara is viewed as a 
significant victory for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), 
who have seen previous "Toronto 18" convictions result in 
comparatively light sentences.  A proposed law was introduced in 
March 2009 to eliminate the practice of giving defendants double 
credit for time spent in pretrial custody, but the bill died when 
Parliament was prorogued on December 30.  The government is likely 
to re-introduce the bill soon after the House of Commons reconvenes 
 
 
on March 3.
