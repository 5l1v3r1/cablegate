SUBJECT: COSTA RICA DEMARCHED ON UN REFORM 
 
REF: STATE 4746 
 
Classified By: Amb Mark Langdale for reasons 1.4 (b&d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Ambassador Langdale and visiting A/DAS David 
Lindwall delivered reftel demarche to Foreign Minister Tovar 
on January 17.  Tovar was receptive to all of our points, but 
seemed most inclined to cooperate on reforms to the Human 
Rights Commission.  End Summary. 
 
UNHRC 
----- 
¶2. (C) Tovar agreed completely with the need to replace the 
discredited Human Rights Commission.  He used the annual Cuba 
Resolution as an example of the need for reform adding that 
Costa Rica's willingness to take some diplomatic heat for its 
principled stands in support of this resolution demonstrates 
its willingness to work for positive reforms.  Tovar nodded 
in agreement with most of our points and motioned for his 
staff to take notes on our arguments for retaining country 
specific resolutions with less than a 2/3's vote.  However, 
Tovar was careful to only commit Costa Rica to continued 
study of various reform proposals. 
 
UN Management 
------------- 
¶3. (C) Tovar said Costa Rica has long agreed with the U.S. in 
principle on the need for reform of the UN's business 
practices.  He said that he saw no reason why the UN should 
not struggle to live on a budget just as its member 
governments do. 
 
Security Council Expansion 
-------------------------- 
¶4. (C) Tovar raised the issue and regretted that it is 
politicizing the region.  He said Costa Rica faces reprisals 
due to its decision not to support Japan's bid for inclusion 
on an expanded Council.  Tovar said that Costa Rica would 
stick to its principles even though Japan was withholding 
financing for a desperately needed metropolitan aqueduct in 
retaliation.
