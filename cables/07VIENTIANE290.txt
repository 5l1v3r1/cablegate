 ¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Econoff met with Bank of Laos (BOL) 
Deputy Director General Mr. Leuane March 16, and NAS Director 
met with Lao Customs Deputy Director of International 
Relations Mr. Vongchan April 5 to discuss reftel and deliver 
nonpaper.  DDG Leuane understands 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Special Recommendation #9. 
 However, Laos is not a member of the FATF, and his focus is 
currently on creating an effective Financial Intelligence 
Unit (FIU)within the bank that can actively track bulk cash 
transactions throughout the Lao banking 
sector.  Mr. Vongchan said Laos was well aware of criminal 
organizations using cash couriers and noted the amount of 
illicit cash seized has risen in 2007.  He blamed narcotics 
smuggling for the rise and said any additional training the 
U.S. could provide would be greatly appreciated. End Summary 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Econoff met March 16th to discuss reftel with Mr. 
Leuane Vongphranakhorn, Deputy Director General in the Bank 
of Laos' Supervision Department and Chair of the FIU, 
currently a committee within the BOL.  Mr. Leuane was well 
aware of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Special 
Recommendation #9 and agreed that bulk cash smuggling was 
dangerous and disruptive.  As he pointed out, however, Laos 
is not currently a member of the FATF, and his goal is 
currently to see the FIU committee become a full-time 
stand-alone department within the Bank of Laos that can 
effectively track suspicious transactions, including large 
movements of cash.  According to Leuane, the BOL is currently 
receiving assistance from AUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction 
Reports and Analysis Center.  AUSTRAC has 
helped with the design of a Secure Transaction Report (STR) 
Form for the BOL and is providing additional support. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The BOL is also working with the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Hanoi on a Cash 
Transaction Report (CTR) Form for domestic cash transactions 
over $3,000.  According to Leuane, international cash 
transactions over $10,000 must currently be reported, 
although he is considering lowering the limit and asked for 
our opinion.  Econoff suggested a lower limit, 
considering Laos' level of development.  Leuane ended the 
conversation by requesting increased technical assistance for 
the Financial Intelligence Unit and additional training when 
possible. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  On April 5, the Embassy Narcotics Affairs Director 
delivered reftel talking points and non-paper to Vongchan 
Lawkhamphromtakoun, Deputy Director of the International 
Relations Division, Lao Customs Department.  Vongchan stated 
the GOL was well aware of the use of cash couriers by 
criminal organizations in Southeast Asia and had become 
increasingly concerned about this issue as the 
number of cash seizures at Lao border crossings has increased 
in the past year.  During 2006, $29,000 in undeclared 
currency was seized by Lao Customs at Wattay Airport in 
Vientiane.  In 2007, this jumped to more than $300,000 in 
only the first three months, most of the cash in Thai Baht. 
Cash couriers included Chinese, Sri Lankan, and Vietnamese 
nationals.  Some used concealment devices, such as hollow 
books, as a means of smuggling currency. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Vonchan said that the BOL is the lead agency on 
penal actions for violations of currency laws.  Laos limits 
the import and export of cash to $5,000.  The GOL will seize 
50% of any amount it finds in excess of that limit, and 100% 
of any cash used for illicit purposes, such as 
narcotics smuggling.  Vonchan said that the latter was a 
major factor in the increased cash seizures that Customs had 
made this year.  He also said that any training that the U.S. 
could provide in this area would be greatly appreciated.
