REF: STATE 72078 
 
¶1.  (U) In response to reftel instructions, Mission requested 
information regarding Indonesian high-level attendance at the 
63rd United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) via diplomatic 
note on July 8.  As of July 31, despite our requests for 
information as soon as possible, the GOI had made no decision 
regarding the participation of President Yudhoyono, FM 
Wirajuda or other high-level officials.  In the past, 
however, President Yudhoyono and Foreign Minister Wirajuda 
have participated in UNGA along with other GOI officials and 
we believe such will be the case again this year. 
 
¶2.   (U) Mission will continue to engage GOI interlocutors on 
this subject.  In previous years, Indonesia did not finalize 
its UNGA high-level attendees' list until mid-August or later.
