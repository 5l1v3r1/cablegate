  ¶1.   Under headline "DRC peace pact: not another mirage, 
      please" the independent "Daily News" dedicated its August 2 
      editorial to persuading the leaders of Rwanda and the 
      Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to implement their 
      peace deal, saying "this pact cannot be allowed to 
      evaporate like another mirage."  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "Last Tuesday, Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, 
      and Joseph Kabila, the President of the DRC, signed 
      a memorandum of understanding on the way to end the 
      four-year conflict in that vast country. . .What is 
      crucial for the pact to succeed is for both South 
      Africa and U. N. to convince the two leaders that if 
      the fighting continues. . .their respective 
      countries will sink deeper and deeper into the 
      morass of poverty, driving into the distant future 
      the prospect of their people ever enjoying the 
      fruits of the independence their countries won in 
      the 1960s.  Kagame and Kabila must be convinced that 
      this pact cannot be allowed to evaporate like 
      another mirage. . .  Kagame and Kabila will need to 
      display tremendous courage, tolerance and even 
      statesmanship if they are to save their people from 
      the further punishment of senseless killings. . . ."
