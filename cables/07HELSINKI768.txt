 ¶1. (SBU) According to Finnish MFA sources, Minister of Trade 
and Industry Mauri Pekkarinen will lead a Finnish delegation 
to the Washington International Renewable Energy Conference 
(WIREC 2008) in March 2008.  The exact composition of the 
delegation will be decided at a later date.  According to 
Henri Backman, Senior Advisor in the Ministry of Trade and 
Industry, Pekkarinen is interested in speaking opportunities 
during the Conference.  Renewable energy, mostly from wood 
sources, already accounts for 20 percent of Finland's primary 
energy consumption and 10 percent of electricity demand. 
Pekkarinen is a strong advocate of GOF policies to increase 
Finnish renewable energy use to 35 percent in the next decade. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following WIREC 2008, Pekkarinen will likely travel 
to California to learn more about renewable energy production 
on the west coast and to visit Finland,s business promotion 
office, FinNode, in San Jose.
