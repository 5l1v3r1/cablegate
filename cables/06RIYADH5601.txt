SUBJECT: SAUDI ARABIA ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECURITY
SITUATION IN PALESTINE AND LEBANON

REF: A) STATE 114594 B) RIYADH 5600

Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Michael Gfoeller
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

¶1. (U) NIACT precedence justified due to urgency of the
message conveyed by the Government of Saudi Arabia.

¶2. (SBU) On July 14, the Saudi Foreign Ministry urgently
contacted and delivered to the Ambassador the following
official Saudi statement expressing its views on the
situation in Palestine and Lebanon.

¶3. (U) Post's informal translation of the Saudi
Government's statement follows:

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has believed and still believes
in the right of people in a state of occupation to engage in
resistance to said occupation in all its forms and counter
illegitimate acts intended to erase their identity and change
reality on the ground. On the basis of this logic, the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always stood by the side of the
legitimate Palestinian resistance with all its capabilities,
which are intended to target the military occupation and to
avoid harming the innocent. On the same basis, it stood
decisively with the Lebanese resistance until the Israeli
occupation of southern Lebanon ended. The Kingdom therefore
views with great concern the painful and bloody events that
are troubling security in both Palestine and Lebanon. It
wishes to announce clearly that it is essential to
differentiate between legitimate resistance and irresponsible
adventures engaged in by elements both in the state and
behind it without reference to the legitimate authority
within their states and without consultation or coordination
with the Arab states, thereby leading to an extremely
dangerous situation that exposes all the Arab states and
their achievements to destruction, without this state having
an opinion or say in the adventure. The Kingdom is of the
view that the time has come for these elements alone to
assume complete responsibility for these irresponsible acts
and that they alone are responsible for ending the crisis
that they have created. End text.

¶4. (C) Comment: Saudi Arabia is apparenting attempting to
adopt a firm and balanced position vis-a-vis the crises in
Lebanon and Gaza. SAG support for the now-vetoed UNSC
resolution, including its apparent refusal to press Qatar for
a delay in bringing the resolution to a vote, made clear the
Saudi leadership's view that Israeli military operations to
date have been excessive, and that the Kingdom is unwaivering
in its support for the Palestinians and for Lebanon's
sovereignty. Those same positions are reflected in the
statement translated above. However, the statement is also a
clear warning to Hizballah, Hamas, and their Iranian
supporters that 1) they started this latest crisis, 2) their
actions affect not only Lebanese and Palestinians, but the
rest of the Arab world as well, and 3) that they can expect
little sympathy or support if they do not end what they have
started. End Comment.
