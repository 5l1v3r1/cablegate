(6), North Rhine-Westphalia (3), Baden-Wuerttemberg (3), 
Berlin (3), Rhineland-Palatinate (2), Hesse (2), Saxony (2), 
Bremen (1), and Saarland (1).  RKI reports that 25 of the 46 
newly confirmed virus cases occurred abroad, mainly from 
travel to Spain.  In the majority of all cases, the course of 
the virus is reportedly mild. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the state with the 
highest number of virus cases among all German states with a 
total of 318, followed by Baden-Wuerttemberg (97) and Bavaria
