Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U)  The Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
concluded that South Africa's national and provincial 
election on April 22 was "peaceful, free, fair, and 
transparent."  SADC's delegation, which comprised 108 
observers from the region, was led by Swaziland's Minister of 
Agriculture Clement Dlamini.  Despite the mission's 
statements that the election results reflect the will of the 
people, the SADC delegation did investigate some concerns 
from stakeholders about the pre-election environment and 
offered some suggestions and recommendations for future 
elections.  End Summary.

"Free and Fair" . . . 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (U)  A SADC delegation of 108 observers from the region 
held a press conference on April 25 and described the 
national and provincial election on April 22 as "peaceful, 
free, fair, and transparent."  Swaziland's Minister of 
Agriculture Clement Dlamini told a crowd in Pretoria that 
"political parties followed relevant legislation to address 
election-related issues affecting them with the electoral 
commission." 
 
------------------------ 
. . . With Some Concerns 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U)  SADC also noted some areas of concern regarding the 
election.  Observers pointed out that voting by South 
Africans living overseas proved to be one of the areas of 
most concern for the election's credibility.  The delegation 
noted that there was a lack of a clear legal framework to 
regulate voter registration overseas.  The SADC mission also 
said the involvement of the Department of Foreign Affairs at 
voting stations overseas was an issue because diplomats often 
are seen as political agents of the ruling party.  A second 
area of concern focused on logistical issues.  The mission 
said that in some areas voting stations ran out of ballots 
and ballot boxes.  (Note:  The U. S. Mission's own observer 
teams also noticed that some voting stations were running 
short of ballots and ballot boxes.  End Note.)  The third 
area of concern focused on issues of political freedom, 
noting that in some areas political parties set up stands 
inside the perimeter of voting stations -- e.g., too close to 
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) polling stations. 
They also said there was singing, dancing, and shouting of 
political slogans outside stations as well as party agents 
wearing party colors.  (Note:  Some of the U. S. Mission's 
observing teams saw parties outside of voting stations with 
music blaring out of expensive cars near party supporters 
waving huge party flags.  End Note.) 
 
------------------------------- 
SADC Offers Few Recommendations 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U)  The SADC observer mission suggested the IEC should 
enhance its logistical support in the provision, development, 
printing, transportation, storage, and management of voting 
materials.  The delegation also noted that improved supplying 
of transparent ballot boxes at all voting stations was needed 
in the future -- especially ballot papers.  Moreover, SADC's 
officers said that the amendment of electoral laws was 
necessary to prohibit political activities within the 
vicinity of voting stations.

Comment

¶5. (U)  SADC's observer mission seemed largely satisfied that 
the April 22 election in South Africa reflected the will of 
Qthe April 22 election in South Africa reflected the will of 
the people.  Although generally positive, the regional 
observers pointed out some isolated areas where the IEC may 
have fallen short and some areas that the SAG could improve. 
The question will be how many of the recommendations the IEC 
takes onboard and how South Africa's electoral commission

evolves ahead of the 2011 local election.
