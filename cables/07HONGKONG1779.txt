HONG KONG IP ISSUES WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND STAKEHOLDERS 
 
REF: HONG KONG 1363 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Legislative Councilor Sin Chung Kai told 
visiting Beijing Intellectual Property Senior Attache Mark 
Cohen and ConGen Hong Kong staff that Hong Kong's amended 
copyright law should generally please copyright owners, 
including U.S. companies, although he noted that a statutory 
"fair use" provision will have to be strengthened later.  The 
recent decision by the Court of Final Appeal to uphold the 
conviction of a Hong Kong resident for illegally uploading 
copyrighted material using BitTorrent software should lead to 
increased enforcement activities against infringement using 
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) software, he added. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In a subsequent meeting with the Hong Kong Customs 
and Excise Department (CED), Hong Kong government (HKG) 
officials offered mixed responses on Hong Kong's legal status 
regarding accession to the WIPO Internet Treaties (WIPO 
Treaties).  All agreed that Hong Kong's copyright laws 
already met most of the requirements of WIPO Treaties 
provisions.  CED's Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau 
actively conducts enforcement against trade fair violations. 
Cooperation with mainland customs officials is frequent, 
although less regular with mainland police.  Cohen also 
discussed mainland IP issues with AmCham Hong Kong's IP 
committee and with a group of international IP lawyers based 
in Hong Kong.  END SUMMARY.

Legco and the Copyright Amendment 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On June 13, ConGen Hong Kong staff and Embassy 
Beijing Intellectual Property Senior Attache Mark Cohen met 
with Legislative Councilor and Democratic Party Vice Chair 
Sin Chung Kai, who represents the functional constituency for 
the Information Technology sector.  Sin told Cohen that the 
government yielded to some stakeholder concerns, including 
director's liability for software infringement.  As for 
publishers, the amendment introduces a "fair use" concept for 
textbooks.  However, this clause remains controversial for 
stakeholders who argue it is too broad.  Sin noted that this 
provision will likely require further subsidiary legislation. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  NOTE:  The copyright Amendment was passed on June 
¶27.  The government yielded to stakeholder concerns on the 
circumvention of technical prevention measures and reached a 
compromise with industry on parallel imports.  Although 
included in the amendment, the director's liability clause is 
weaker than what American stakeholders had hoped.  While it 
does make company directors liable for infringement in the 
workplace, it also provides an employee defense, which 
potentially could be used by directors to relieve themselves 
of liability.  Furthermore, this clause will not come into 
effect for approximately six to twelve months, pending a HKG 
education campaign to warn companies of the new law. 
Nonetheless, BSA and Microsoft officials expressed 
satisfaction that some form of director's liability is now 
law.  Regarding fair use, publishers remain concerned that 
the new law is too broad and does not protect rights holders 
from infringement by for-profit educational institutions (of 
which there are many in Hong Kong.)  The HKG responds that 
its fair use provision is based on U.S. copyright law. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Sin also stated that Hong Kong amended its copyright 
laws between 1995-1997 to comply with TRIPS and WIPO 
treaties.  Hong Kong already complies with 95% of WIPO rules 
with the sole exceptions being provisions on public 
performance rights and moral rights.  Cohen encouraged the 
HKG to complete remaining legislative formalities.  Regarding 
BitTorrent and P2P file sharing, Sin predicted that CED would 
escalate enforcement operations against this form of 
infringement.  He noted that CED largely waited until the 
Court made its final verdict in the case and now is empowered 
to take more proactive action.

¶6. (SBU) Cohen and ConGen staff discussed enforcement 
activity with CED Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau 
Superintendent Jim Kwok, Divisional Commander Le Kam-kuen, 
Group Head Edmond Cheng, and Senior Investigator Simon Ng. 
Kwok said CED closely monitors trade exhibits for IPR 
violations.  Last year, CED intervened in three or four cases 
for IPR violations at trade shows.  Cohen responded that the 
Commerce Department has a world-wide trade fair enforcement 
initiative and requested further information on Hong Kong's 
practices.  Regarding handling of infringing materials after 
enforcement activities, CED destroys both counterfeit items 
and production lines after successful raids.  Typical 
violations involve watches, handbags, and garments.  Internet 
piracy is growing as well. 
 
¶7. (SBU) CED has fast action plans for enforcement and 
accepts affidavits for copyright registration without a 
requirement for personal presence.  In such instances, a U.S. 
copyright certificate could be used to demonstrate ownership 
of copyright.  Kwok said civil IP complaints can be filed 
online, while criminal complaints require that the owner's 
representative be in Hong Kong.  Bonds are not required, 
although evidence is. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Kwok added that CED's IP Investigation Bureau has 
200 staff and that they regularly exchange information with 
PRC customs authorities, noting many successful joint 
seizures with the mainland.  Coordination with mainland 
police, however, is infrequent.  Nonetheless, Kwok added that 
frequent information exchange -- including real time exchange 
-- between HKG and PRC officials allows Hong Kong to monitor 
piracy in the Mainland, especially in Guangdong.  Cooperation 
on internet related cases remains limited, however. 
Regarding education in Hong Kong, the HKG's youth ambassador 
projects resulted in thousands of reports of IPR violations. 
CED works with education officials on creating primary and 
secondary school programs to build awareness of IPR.

¶9. (SBU) Cohen attended the monthly meeting of the American 
Chamber of Commerce's IP Committee.  He provided committee 
members with an overview of the recent WTO case that the U.S. 
filed concerning IP in China, nothing that the case should 
not be taken as an attack against China.  However, he stated 
that China reacted by suspending formal cooperation on IP 
matters with the U.S., including putting off the Joint 
Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) and suspending 
cooperation with the EU and Japan. (Note:  The EU, Japan and 
Mexico joined the U.S. as "observers" in the case.)  In 
response to a question on IPR enforcement in China, Cohen 
suggested it was important not to misallocate resources and 
that foreign companies, including their counsel in Hong Kong, 
should encourage spending on deterrent remedies.  He told the 
committee that using foreign lawyers to pursue administrative 
or trade fair remedies is often quite expensive with minimum 
deterrent effect.
