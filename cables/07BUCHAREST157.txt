The Ministry of Justice salutes the Embassy of the United 
States of America and has the honor to request to speed up 
the answer to our nota verbale no. 133431/2006 of December 
29, 2006. 
 
Thus, the embassy is requested to communicate the following: 
 
¶1. If U.S. authorities agree to the hearing by 
videoconference, as a defendant, of U.S. and Iraqi citizen 
Mohammad Munaf, for committing the crimes of initiating an 
association with the purpose of committing terrorist acts as 
well as of financially supporting this association, 
(incriminated by art. 35, para 2, Law 535/2004) and 
complicity to terrorism acts (incriminated by art. 26, 
Criminal Code; art. 32, para 1 and 2, Law 535/2004;  art. 189 
para 1 and 2 of the Penal Code), acts for which he was 
indicted by the General Prosecutor,s Office, High Court of 
Cassation and Justice, Direction for Investigation of 
Organized Crime and Terrorism together with defendant Omar

¶2. The standpoint of the U.S. authorities with regard to the 
request of hearing by videoconference of Mr. Munaf as a 
witness, in the criminal file no. 33970/2005 registered with 
the Bucharest Court of Appeal, Criminal Section I. 
 
In case of an affirmative answer, the embassy is kindly asked 
to communicate a date for the two hearings in the two files, 
so that the courts can set the dates for the respective 
hearings, as well as contact information for the U.S. 
officials who will help with the technical support. 
 
Also, the Ministry of Justice requests the embassy to express 
its standpoint with regard to a new hearing by 
videoconference of Muhammad Munaf as a witness in the 
criminal file no. 5708/2005 registered with the Bucharest 
Tribunal, Criminal Section I regarding the defendants Omar 
Hayssam, Omar Mohamad and Qasim E. Esa for the crimes of 
associating with the goal of committing fraud.  The hearing 
was programmed for June 28, 2007; we, therefore, request the 
embassy to analyze the possibility of the videoconference 
hearing of Mr. Munaf as a witness at the set date or earlier. 
 
Please see in the Annex the request for international 
judicial assistance of the Bucharest Tribunal, Criminal 
Section I in the file no. 5708/2005, addressed to the Iraqi 
authorities. 
 
Because the above requests refer to organized crime and 
terrorism acts and are urgent, the Ministry of Justice kindly 
requests that the embassy,s answer is given in a reasonable 
time limit. 
 
Also, please let us know, in due time, if any supplementary
