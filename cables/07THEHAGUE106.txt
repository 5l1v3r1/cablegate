ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Following the transmission of The Hague 00094 (ref 
A) on the Dutch response to the GAERC demarche (ref B), post 
received the following information about Dutch intentions 
with regard to UNSCR 1737 and Iran from Andre van Wiggen, 
Deputy Director, Terrorism and New Threats Unit, Political 
Affairs Division, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Van Wiggen told econoff that the Dutch approach to 
implementing UNSCR 1737 "remains to be seen," and would be 
determined the week of January 22 by an inter-ministerial 
meeting between the Dutch ministries of Foreign Affairs, 
Finance, Justice, Transportation, Agriculture, Education, as 
well as Dutch immigration, customs, and tax agencies.  This 
group would identify which of GAERC's resolutions are 
relevant, van Wiggen said, and that any subsequent Dutch 
action would depend on whether the information provided is 
enough to legally justify a ban on entities related to Iran's 
nuclear and missile programs.  Van Wiggen added that specific 
and robust information is also needed in the case of the 
Saderat and Sepah banks prior to Dutch or EU action.  Post 
will follow up and report on any substantive outcome from the 
inter-ministerial meeting. 
 
¶3. (U)  Post also received confirmation from Wink Joosten, 
Trade Policy Department, Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs 
(MEA) that the Energy Policy Non-Paper (ref C) had been 
delivered to Rodrigo Pinto Scholtbach, Senior Policy Officer 
at MEA's International Department for the Directorate General 
for Energy and Telecom.
