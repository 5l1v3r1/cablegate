¶4. Ret. Admiral Ilhami Erdil, the first Turkish service commander to 
be incarcerated, was imprisoned on July 3.  Ret. ADM Erdil was 
sentenced to 2.5 years of imprisonment on charges of fraudulent 
acquisition of personal wealth during his tenure as Naval Forces 
Commander between 1999 and 2001.  The court expelled him from the 
military and stripped him of all privileges as a retired force 
commander.  Erdil returned all military medals, insignia and 
documents certifying a military career in Turkish Armed Forces 
(TAF).  Only one other Turkish general officer has served jail time: 
MG Mustafa Muglali, who was tried and convicted of executing 33
