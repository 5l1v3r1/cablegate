¶1.  (U) This is an action request; please see para 7. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA Assistant Under Secretary for Coordination and 
Follow Up Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa February 
27 summoned representatives of G-8 embassies to formally 
request their governments' financial support for the BMENA 
Center for Entrepreneurial Excellence in Bahrain (CEEB). 
(All G-8 countries were present except for Canada.)  The 
Jordanian Ambassador and CEEB Executive Advisor also attended 
the meeting.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz told the group it was "crunch 
time" to come up with assistance for the CEEB.  The Center 
would need help for the first 2-3 years, after which time it 
would be self-sustaining through the support of regional 
governments, whose citizens will benefit from training 
provided by the CEEB.  Financial support for the Center would 
help governments in the region answer citizens' questions 
about how the BMENA process has helped them. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Shaikh Abdul Aziz said an excellent, qualified 
candidate for the Executive Director position had been 
identified.  The Center now needs to obtain funding to bring 
him on board, and for future programming.  The Center had 
reached a critical stage.  If there is no response from the 
G-8 governments, the Center will have flowered and died away. 
 The concept of the Center had been discussed thoroughly at 
the G-8 Sea Island summit and the Rabat and Manama Forums for 
the Future.  It now needs practical support. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Executive Advisor described the Center's 
operations to date and distributed a three-year budget 
identifying the funding shortfall.  He invited the G-8 
representatives to attend a March 5 training session for 
young entrepreneurs.  The participants expressed interest in 
attending. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Pol/Econ Chief said that the U.S. was proud to have 
funded the Center from the beginning.  The Center had been 
designed to get maximum bang for the buck.  G-8 funding went 
exclusively toward staff compensation and program 
development, not buildings or other extraneous costs.  He 
urged the other officials to request funding from their 
capitals.  The UK representative said that her government had 
decided to fund the Center, calling it a very positive 
initiative.  HMG will finance a specific program as part of 
the Center's activities.  (Following the meeting, the UK rep 
told Pol/Econ Chief that she would ask London to request 
European Commission support for the Center.)  The Japanese 
rep said his government was considering offering technical 
support for programming. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Russian and Italian officials asked about the 
possibility of private sector support for the CEEB.  Shaikh 
Abdul Aziz said the private sector would step up, but its 
support was predicated upon the CEEB's long-term viability. 
He requested that the participants inform their capitals of 
the Bahraini request.  He said he would schedule another 
meeting in one month's time to get their feedback. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Action Request:  Post recommends that Washington 
instruct Embassies in G-8 capitals to request host government 
support for the CEEB, referencing the February 27 meeting in 
Manama.
