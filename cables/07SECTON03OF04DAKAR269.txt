¶6.  (SBU) There is general economic stability, and GDP 
growth had averaged five percent annually for the last 
ten years, but is estimated to have fallen to three 
percent in 2006.  More than half the population lives in 
poverty; one-third to one-half have no reliable 
employment; the agricultural sector, which employs 60 
percent of the population, is weak and unreliable; and 
most youth see emigration as a panacea, as shown by the 
recent flight of thousands of Senegalese to the Canary 
Islands.  On a more positive note, Senegal graduated from 
the Highly Indebted Poor Countries program.  In 2005 and 
2006, the IMF and the World Bank forgave over USD 1 
billion in multilateral debt, potentially freeing up over 
USD 80 million per year for poverty reduction.  Despite 
these successes, the business environment remains 
difficult.  Corruption is an issue, and while Wade has 
said the right things about combating it, members of his 
own inner circle are often rumored to demand bribes and 
percentages of investments. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Senegal's manufacturing and services sectors 
are hampered by major infrastructure weaknesses that 
prevent Senegal from taking advantage of its favorable 
geographic location.  Senegal's underdeveloped road and 
dilapidated railway systems do not provide adequate links 
to Senegal's landlocked neighbors, who could profit from 
exporting through Dakar's international port.  Roads are 
overly congested in major urban areas as well as poorly 
maintained almost everywhere in the country.  Electricity 
supplies are unreliable, very expensive and far from 
universally available.  The Port of Dakar, the closest 
African port to the U.S. and Western Europe, is in great 
need of modernization to meet the potential demand of the 
sub-region alone.  The country has done little to take 
advantage of potential trade preferences under the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), although new, 
direct trade links to the U.S. should help augment 
Senegalese exports to the U.S. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Senegal has traditionally been a French and 
Lebanese expatriate business preserve.  In recent years, 
China, India, Morocco, and Iran have become significant 
economic players in Senegal.  Some high-profile U.S. 
companies operate in Senegal, including Citibank, General 
Electric, Pfizer, Colgate-Palmolive, Microsoft, Ernst and 
Young, Suffolk University, UPS, and Phillip Morris. 
While the Government rhetoric speaks favorably of the 
benefits of the private sector, in practice the 
Government involves itself in many major transactions and 
potential investments that undermine the principles of 
free, open and transparent competition. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) For 2007, the Government of Senegal will have 
to deal with a significant budget deficit, while at the 
same time continuing to finance significant public 
investments in roads and a new international airport. 
Since 2004, Senegal has been eligible as a potential 
Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) partner and is 
continuing to do the required feasibility studies for a 
proposed MCA Compact to build a major new industrial
