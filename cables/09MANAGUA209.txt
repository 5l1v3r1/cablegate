Ambassador Delivers School Materials for USAID Program 
 
¶2. During a Feb. 4 public ceremony to deliver $250,000 in school materials under USAID's EXCELENCIA Education Program, the Ambassador assured 200 students, teachers and parents assembled at the Benjamin Zeledon School in Managua that the U.S. government is committed to aiding Nicaragua in achieving quality education for all children. Over 30 national TV, radio and print reporters captured the Ambassador's message that schools are where "democratic ideals are developed; where future voters learn to evaluate their governments and protect their civil rights." Minister of Education Miguel De Castilla repeatedly thanked the USG for supporting education in Nicaragua and praised USAID's EXCELENCIA Program.
 
Reaching Development Goals Through Quality Education 
 
¶3. The USG, through USAID, has been a major donor in Nicaragua for basic education, providing $92.2 million in assistance since 1990. USAID's $15.8 million EXCELENCIA Program (2005-2009) works in close collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MINED) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to expand a successful child-centered teaching approach, pioneered by USAID, to approximately 3,000 public, private and faith-based elementary schools by September 2009. EXCELENCIA'S objectives are to provide quality education to primary school children and increase student completion rates and academic achievement through the use of modern teaching practices and community participation.
 
¶4. EXCELENCIA's success in increasing school completion rates and improving academic achievement led MINED to expand the model to all public primary schools. To date, 2,869 primary schools in 151 of the country's 153 municipalities are participating in the USAID EXCELENCIA program, benefiting 444,761 Nicaraguan children. The EXCELENCIA program includes a reformed curriculum, teacher training, parent/teacher involvement, democratically elected student councils, and donations of school supplies. USAID addresses the learning needs of children in the North Atlantic and South Atlantic Autonomous Regions by providing school books and materials in Miskitu, Mayagna and English.
 
Comment: Development and Diplomacy 
 
¶5. USAID's development programs such as EXCELENCIA, and others in the areas of health and economic growth, show the people of Nicaragua the benefits of favorable relations with the United States, contributing to U.S. foreign policy objectives while advancing development goals. Public events highlighting these programs offer opportunities to show how the U.S. government supports the Nicaraguan people and seeks to maintain a dialogue with the Nicaraguan government on matters of mutual concern. These activities generate positive coverage by the local media and contribute to a favorable opinion of the U.S. in Nicaraguan opinion polls.
 
¶6.  These programs also foster improved relations between the two 
governments, often at odds, in areas where a common ground can be 
reached and provide an opportunity to emphasize U.S. government 
principles of democracy and civil rights.  End comment.
