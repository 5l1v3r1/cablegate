¶1. (SBU) Summary.  While the flu epidemic is spreading across 
Ukraine, public panic levels appear to have dropped slightly, as 
some rationality returned to the discussion.  According to the World 
Health Organization (WHO), there has been one officially confirmed 
H1N1 death and 14 non-lethal H1N1 cases.  The number of flu- and 
pneumonia-related deaths meanwhile exceeded 80, Deputy Minister of 
Health and Chief Sanitary Doctor Oleksandr Bilovol said in a press 
conference on November 4.  Several countries including Poland, 
Hungary, Slovakia and Georgia pledged assistance to Ukraine to fight 
the outbreak and provided medicine and H1N1 testing kits.  At the 
same time, Slovakia closed two of its five border crossings with 
Ukraine and other countries announced stricter border controls to 
prevent the flu from spreading into their territories.  To combat 
the virus, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) approved 
amendments to the budget on Tuesday to allocate UAH 1 billion ($125 
million) to the Ministry of Health.  However, questions about the 
funding source quickly arose, fueling debate about the 
politicization of the epidemic.  End Summary. 
 
ONE OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED H1N1 DEATH 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a briefing for the diplomatic community on November 3, 
the WHO country office head Igor Pokanevych said there has been one 
officially confirmed H1N1 death in Ukraine and 14 non-lethal cases 
of H1N1.  Yet, despite this relatively low number of confirmed 
cases, the WHO said in a statement that most flu cases in Ukraine 
can be assumed to be H1N1, "as the pandemic virus has rapidly become 
the dominant influenza strain worldwide."  According to preliminary 
findings by the WHO, however, nothing indicates that Ukraine's flu 
outbreak is different from those experienced in other countries.  A 
special WHO team, which arrived in Ukraine on November 2 at the 
invitation of the government, is currently working closely with the 
Ministry of Health to study the outbreak and take adequate measures 
to protect the population. 
 
VACCINES AND SURGICAL MASKS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to WHO's Pokanevych, two H1N1 vaccines, produced 
by Russia and Canada, are currently undergoing a registration 
process in Ukraine and could be available in December 2009-January 
¶2010.  Ukraine is also expected to procure 700,000 doses of Tamiflu 
from Swiss drug manufacturer Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, in addition to 
300,000 doses already purchased (ref C).  Prime Minister Tymoshenko 
also reportedly tasked Foreign Minister Poroshenko with procuring 
additional medication from international companies "at a special 
pandemic price."  In a more populist move, Tymoshenko said that all 
Ukrainian will be provided with a surgical mask within one week, 
according to Interfax news service. 
 
STATE-RUN DRUGSTORES 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ostensibly to ensure availability and affordability of 
medicine, Tymoshenko suggested that a state network of drugstores be 
created and asked the government to draft a plan to this effect by 
November 11.  The Prime Minister proposed that owners of drugstores 
engaged in "profiteering" be criminally prosecuted and the Security 
Service of Ukraine (SBU) reportedly closed several pharmacies which 
failed to carry the recommended assortment of medications, according 
to First Deputy Health Minister Vasyl Lazorishinets. 
 
CAN THE NATIONAL BANK PAY FOR ANTI-FLU PROGRAM? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Verkhovna Rada overwhelmingly approved amendments to 
the 2009 budget on November 3 to allocate UAH 1 billion ($125 
million) to the Ministry of Health to combat the flu.  According to 
the amendments, the funds are to be provided by the National Bank of 
Ukraine (NBU) and redirected from the state program for financing 
Ukraine's preparations for the Euro-2012 soccer championship. 
[Note: These outlays are to be financed from the NBU's "future" 
profit earned in 2009.  The NBU however estimates that its 2009 
profit will be about UAH 608 million ($76 million) and repeatedly 
spoke out against an advance payment to the budget. End Note.] 
According to NBU Deputy Governor Shapovalov, "it is up to the 
government how to use the UAH 608 million both to pay for the Euro 
2012 Championship and the anti-flu campaign." 
 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
------------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) The WHO has donated 61,000 treatment courses of Tamiflu to 
Ukraine and provided Ukrainian laboratories with H1N1 test kits.

According to the WHO, the Ukrainian government has also reached an 
agreement with Indian pharmaceutical companies on the supply of 
medicines and medical equipment to Ukraine.  Slovakia, Poland, 
Hungary and Georgia have already provided assistance to Ukraine, 
including H1N1 testing kits and antiviral drugs.  China and 
Singapore have reportedly agreed to render expert assistance to 
Ukraine.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has been tasked with 
coordinating all international assistance. 
 
BORDER SITUATION 
---------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Slovakia said on November 3 it closed two of its five border 
crossings with Ukraine to prevent the spread of H1N1 into its 
territory.  Russia boosted controls on its borders with Ukraine and, 
according to news reports, announced it would quarantine people with 
severe flu symptoms.  There have also been unconfirmed press reports 
of stricter border regimes and potential closures at the Ukrainian 
border with Moldova, Romania and Poland. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The panic level in the media appears to have diminished 
slightly, due to the arrival of the special WHO team and a more 
unified message from the government.  The public seems calmed by 
reports that, based on preliminary findings, the WHO team has 
confirmed Ukraine is experiencing a flu epidemic at a level 
comparable to other affected countries, including the U.S.  End 
Comment.
