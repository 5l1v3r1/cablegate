¶1. (U) Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht will represent the 
Royal Government of Belgium at the Dec. 17 Paris donors 
conference for Palestine.  Belgium will contribute USD 38.75 
million (26.18 Euros) to the Palestinian Authority (PA) in CY 
2008, and a total of over USD 92 million (more than 62 
million Euros) for 2009-2011.  As such, Belgium believes 
that, given its size, it is right up there with other key 
European contributors to the PA (a list that includes Norway 
and the Netherlands) and wants to have that recognized. 
Having convinced the French to include Belgium in the Dec. 7 
planning meeting in Paris, the MFA hoped that other nations 
will "finally" recognize the kingdom's consistent important 
contributions to the Palestinians. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  In response to our points, delivered to MFA Deputy 
Chief of Staff Jean-Luc Bodson, MFA Deputy Chief of Staff on 
December 11, Bodson confirmed that FM Karel De Gucht will 
represent Belgium at the December 17 Paris conference.  He 
then turned the meeting over to Levant desk officer Hendrik 
Van De Velde who had attended the Dec. 7 planning meeting in 
Paris.  Van de Velde reported what Belgium had announced in 
Paris:  that, starting from a baseline of 2006 contributions 
totalling 13.59 M Euros (USD 20.11), Belgium had and will 
increase its Euro contributions to the Palestinian Authority 
in the following categories per the following timeline:
