¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 infections in 
Germany increased over yesterday by 350 new cases, bringing 
the total as of August 20 to 13,180.  Germany ranks first in 
confirmed virus infections among European countries.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U)  At its August 20 press briefing, the National 
Reference 
Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
confirmed a total of 350 new (laboratory and non-laboratory) 
H1N1 cases in Germany, increasing the total number of H1N1 
cases to 13,180.  New cases were distributed among the federal 
states as follows: Bavaria (118), Baden-Wuerttemberg (107), 
Lower-Saxony (40), North Rhine-Westphalia (37), Saxony (16), 
Hamburg (11), Hesse (8), Brandenburg (3), Rhineland-Palatinate 
(3), Saxony-Anhalt (3), Bremen (2), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (1) 
and Thuringia (1) 
 
¶4. (U)  According to RKI, 273 of the total 350 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases 
include non-laboratory H1N1 cases that exhibited symptoms 
after being in contact with a laboratory confirmed infected 
person. 
 
¶5. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the German state with 
the highest number of confirmed virus cases with a total of 
4,519,  followed by Lower-Saxony (2,225) and Baden- 
Wuerttemberg (1,628 cases).  About 23 percent (3,023) of all 
confirmed infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission. 
 
¶6. (U)  For the first time since the H1N1 outbreak in April, 
Germany has reported more H1N1 infections than any of its 
European neighbors, passing even the UK.  Nevertheless, we are 
aware of no deaths in Germany due to the virus.
