SUBJECT: ORAL MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY TO ARAB 
LEAGUE MEMBERS AND UAEG REACTION TO THE SUMMIT 
POSTPONEMENT 
 
Ref: State 67135 
 
¶1. Post delivered reftel points from the Secretary to 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed on March 27, 
the day before Arab League Summit host Tunisia 
announced that it was canceling the meeting. 
 
¶2. A public statement issued by UAE Foreign Minister 
Rashid Abdullah on March 29 endorsed President 
Mubarak's initiative to hold the Arab League Summit in 
Cairo instead of in Tunis.  Abdullah said holding the 
summit in Cairo at the Arab League headquarters was 
normal because Arab leaders had agreed that the summit 
must be regularly held in Cairo unless the country 
currently chairing the league chooses to host the 
summit.  Abdullah said the summit's suspension was not 
because of the issue of reform in the Arab world, nor 
issues on the agenda.  He said Tunisia suspended the 
summit citing differences on a number of issues 
presented for discussion by Tunisia, which saw those 
issues as important toward achieving development, 
modernization, and reform in Arab countries.
