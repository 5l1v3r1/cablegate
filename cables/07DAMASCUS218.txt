REF: SECSTATE 202745 
 
¶1.  (U) THE FOLLOWING IS POST'S SUBMISSION TO THE ANNUAL 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT.   THE EMBASSY'S POINT OF 
CONTACT IS POLOFF MARIA D.G. OLSON.  OFFICE TELEPHONE:  (963) 
(11) 3391-3785.  FAX:  (963) (11) 3391-3999.  OFFICER SPENT 
40 HOURS IN PREPARATION OF THE REPORT, WHICH IS STRUCTURED TO 
ANSWER REFTEL.

CHECKLIST

¶2.  (SBU) 27.A:  SYRIA'S OPAQUE LEGAL AND POLITICAL SYSTEM 
AND CONSERVATIVE, FAMILY-CENTERED SOCIETAL VALUES, WHICH 
DISCOURAGE DISCUSSION OF TRAFFICKING-RELATED ISSUES SUCH AS 
PROSTITUTION, MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT 
SYRIA IS A COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, TRANSIT, OR DESTINATION FOR 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS.  NO GOVERNMENT ENTITY FOLLOWS THIS 
ISSUE IN DEPTH; THE CAPACITY OF CIVIL SOCIETY IS 
UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THERE ARE FEW INTERNATIONAL NGOS IN 
SYRIA.  CONSEQUENTLY, THERE ARE NO STATISTICS AVAILABLE ON 
THE SCOPE AND TYPE OF TRAFFICKING THAT MAY EXIST AND VERY 
LIMITED INSIGHT ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC, THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY AND INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS RESIDENT IN SYRIA INTO THE ISSUE.  EMBASSIES 
AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE BEST SOURCES OF 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN SYRIA WHO ARE 
POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING.  BASED ON OUR SOURCES AND 
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE, WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE MOST AT RISK OF BEING 
TRAFFICKED TO AND THROUGH SYRIA FOR PROSTITUTION AND DOMESTIC 
LABOR. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) 27.B:   MOST SOURCES QUERIED BY POST (UNHCR, 
INTERNATIONAL OFFICE FOR MIGRATION OTHERWISE KNOWN AS IOM, 
ASIAN, ARAB, AFRICAN AND EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS) DO NOT BELIEVE 
THAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IS WIDESPREAD OR SYSTEMATIC IN 
SYRIA, ALTHOUGH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE IT COULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A 
LARGER PROBLEM.  POST IS NOT AWARE OF WIDESPREAD TRAFFICKING 
OF SYRIANS ABROAD OR WITHIN SYRIA.  NEVERTHELESS, POST HAS 
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED EASTERN EUROPEAN 
WOMEN ARE EMPLOYED AS DANCERS IN CABARETS IN UNACCEPTABLE 
CONDITIONS, WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS HOLDING THEIR PASSPORTS AND 
RESTRICTING THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT DANCERS CAN LEAVE THE 
WORK PREMISES.  EMPLOYERS FROM BOTH SYRIA AND THE WOMEN'S 
HOME COUNTRY REPORTEDLY RECRUIT THE WOMEN AS DANCERS, HAVING 
THEM SIGN A CONTRACT THAT STIPULATES A VERY LOW WAGE IN SYRIA 
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WILL BE PAID MORE UNDER THE 
TABLE UPON ARRIVAL.  ONCE THEY ARRIVE, THE DANCERS ARE MADE 
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN EARN ADDITIONAL MONEY FROM 
PROSTITUTION, ESPECIALLY DURING THE THREE HOURS DAILY THAT 
THEY ARE AUTHORIZED TO LEAVE THE CLUB. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) 27.B-CONTINUED:  ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS EVIDENCE 
THAT AT LEAST 50,000 SOUTHEAST ASIAN AND ETHIOPIAN DOMESTIC 
HELPERS WORK IN SYRIA (AN ESTIMATED 40,000 FROM INDONESIA, 
8,000 FROM THE PHILIPPINES, 2,000 FROM SRI LANKA AND AN 
UNKNOWN NUMBER FROM ETHIOPIA).  THE GOVERNMENTS OF SRI LANKA, 
INDONESIA, AND THE PHILIPPINES BAN THEIR CITIZENS FROM TAKING 
EMPLOYMENT AS DOMESTIC WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY, ABSENT FORMAL 
MECHANISMS TO REGULATE SUCH EMPLOYMENT, ALTHOUGH AT LEAST 
WITH REGARD TO INDONESIANS, THE BAN IS NOT STOPPING THE FLOW 
OF WORKERS TO SYRIA.  THERE WAS AN UNCONFIRMED NEWS REPORT IN 
2006 THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF EAST TIMOR ALSO BANNED EXIT VISAS 
TO SYRIA FOR ITS CITIZENS WHO WERE BEING RECRUITED AS 
DOMESTIC LABORERS.  MANY WORKERS APPARENTLY ARRIVE IN SYRIA 
WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS. 
EMPLOYERS ROUTINELY HOLD THE WORKERS' PASSPORTS AND REQUIRE 
THEM TO WORK LONG HOURS, OFTEN WITHOUT PROVIDING PRIVATE 
LIVING QUARTERS THAT WOULD GUARANTEE PERSONAL PRIVACY.  UP 
UNTIL THE PM'S ISSUANCE OF DECREE 81 TO REGULATE DOMESTIC 
WORKER AGENCIES IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE DOMESTIC WORKERS 
ARRIVED IN SYRIA VIA OUTLAWED SYRIAN AGENCIES THAT ARRANGED 
FOR THE WOMEN TO COME TO SYRIA ON TOURIST VISAS (EITHER FOR 
SYRIA OR A THIRD COUNTRY IN THE REGION) THAT ARE THEN 
EXTENDED UPON ARRIVAL.  ONE SYRIAN CONTACT ESTIMATED THAT AS 
MANY AS 80 DOMESTIC WORKER AGENCIES OPERATED ILLEGALLY 
THROUGHOUT SYRIA.  SUCH AGENCIES CONTINUE TO PLACE NEWSPAPER 
AND TELEPHONE DIRECTORY ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THEIR SERVICES, 
BUT REPORTS SUGGEST IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW IS STARTING 
(SEE BELOW). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) 27.B-CONTINUED:  SEPARATELY, MOST SOURCES ASSERT 
THAT TURMOIL IN NEIGHBORING IRAQ HAS CREATED CONDITIONS 
CONDUCIVE TO THE TRAFFICKING OF IRAQI WOMEN, WHICH HAS LED TO 
INCREASED PROSTITUTION BY IRAQI WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SYRIA, AND 
TO THE TRAFFICKING OF SOME WOMEN AND GIRLS TO KUWAIT, DUBAI 
 
AND LEBANON THROUGH SYRIA.  THERE ARE NO ESTIMATES ON THE 
NUMBER OF IRAQI PROSTITUTES HERE, WHETHER THEY WERE 
TRAFFICKED HERE OR TURNED TO PROSTITUTION ONCE THEIR OTHER 
ECONOMIC MEANS OF SUPPORT RAN OUT, OR ON THE NUMBERS OF WOMEN 
AND GIRLS WHO ARE TRAFFICKED THROUGH SYRIA.  ONE DIPLOMATIC 
SOURCE SUGGESTED THAT SOME IRAQIS BRING THEIR WIVES AND/OR 
DAUGHTERS HERE BEFORE RETURNING BACK TO IRAQ AND THAT THE 
IRAQI WOMEN ARE EVENTUALLY FORCED BY A LACK OF ECONOMIC MEANS 
TO TURN TO PROSTITUTION.  (NOTE:  THERE ARE NO DIRECT 
PROVISIONS IN SYRIAN LAWS GIVING REFUGEES THE RIGHT TO WORK. 
OBTAINING A WORK PERMIT IS A LENGTHY AND COMPLICATED PROCESS; 
REFUGEES ARE RARELY GRANTED A PERMIT.)  SEPARATELY, IRAQI MEN 
BRING IRAQI WOMEN AND GIRLS INTO SYRIA, WHO ARE FALSELY 
LISTED AS WIVES AND DAUGHTERS ON THE TRAFFICKERS' PASSPORTS. 
THE TRAFFICKERS THEN SEEK NEW PASSPORTS FOR THE WOMEN AND 
GIRLS BEFORE "SELLING" THEM TO THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS FOR 
EMPLOYMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, SUCH AS IN LEBANON, DUBAI AND 
KUWAIT, ACCORDING TO A DIPLOMATIC SOURCE.  THERE IS NO 
INFORMATION SUGGESTING THAT SYRIA IS A COUNTRY OF ORIGIN FOR 
TRAFFICKING. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) B-CONTINUED: THE SARG HAS TAKEN STEPS THAT INDICATE 
OFFICIAL AWARENESS OF THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATER TRAFFICKING 
TO AND FROM SYRIA, BY CREATING A COUNTER-TRAFFICKING 
COMMISSION IN 2005, WHICH MET AT LEAST TWICE IN LATE 2006, 
AND BY ISSUES OF DECREE 81 IN NOVEMBER 2006 TO REGULATE THE 
ACTIVITIES OF DOMESTIC WORKER AGENCIES.  IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE NEW LAW, WHICH REQUIRES ALL AGENCIES TO OBTAIN A LICENSE 
AND PUT DOWN A USD 1 MILLION SECURITY DEPOSIT, IS REPORTEDLY 
JUST STARTING, ACCORDING TO CONTACTS.  ONE SOURCE TOLD US 
THAT, AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE DECREE'S PASSAGE, SARG 
OFFICIALS UNCOVERED HIGH-LEVEL TRAFFICKING-RELATED CORRUPTION 
IN THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR'S IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, WHICH 
LED TO THE FIRING OF A NUMBER OF IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS AT 
HIGH LEVELS.  ALTHOUGH POST COULD NOT CORROBORATE THIS 
REPORT, WE DID HEAR OF A WIDESPREAD SHAKE-UP IN THE 
IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT IN LATE 2006.  ADDITIONALLY, THE SARG 
AUTHORIZED AN IOM COUNTER-TRAFFICKING CONFERENCE, WHICH WAS 
CO-ORGANIZED WITH THE SYRIAN MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, THAT TOOK 
PLACE IN FEBRUARY 2007.  THE COMMISSION IS DRAFTING 
COUNTER-TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO GO TO 
THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY AFTER PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN APRIL. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) 27.C:  LIMITATIONS ON THE SARG'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS 
TRAFFICKING INCLUDE A LACK OF RELIABLE STATISTICS ON FOREIGN 
MIGRATION TO SYRIA, A LACK OF WIDESPREAD AWARENESS ABOUT 
TRAFFICKING, INCLUDING AMONG OFFICIALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS, A LACK OF RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL CAPACITIES, AND 
CORRUPTION. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) 27.D:  MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OFFICIALS SAID DURING 
THE FEBRUARY 2007 COUNTER-TRAFFICKING CONFERENCE THAT THEY DO 
NOT SYSTEMATICALLY MONITOR COUNTER-TRAFFICKING.  RATHER, 
MINISTRY OFFICIALS MONITOR, FOR EXAMPLE, PROSTITUTION-RELATED 
OFFENSES.  TO POST'S KNOWLEDGE, NONE OF THE SARG'S 
ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO TRAFFICKING ARE MADE AVAILABLE 
PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY. 
 
---------- 
PREVENTION 
---------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) 28.A:  DURING AN IOM SEPTEMBER 2005 
COUNTER-TRAFFICKING WORKSHOP, THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE 
INTERIOR IBRAHIM AL-MOUSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED (AS NOTED ABOVE) 
THAT SYRIA IS A TRANSIT COUNTRY FOR TRAFFICKING.  DURING 
IOM'S 2007 CONFERENCE, A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT'S 
COUNTER-TRAFFICKING COMMISSION LISTED SEVERAL LOCAL NEWSPAPER 
REPORTS AS SUPPORT FOR THE COMMISSION'S WORK ON NEW 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) 28.B:  GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED IN EFFORTS 
THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ANTI-TRAFFICKING INCLUDE THE MINISTRIES OF 
JUSTICE, INTERIOR, HIGHER EDUCATION, AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS AND 
LABOR.  EACH OF THESE MINISTRIES HAS A REPRESENTATIVE ON THE 
SARG'S COUNTER-TRAFFICKING COMMITTEE.  THE MINISTRY OF 
INTERIOR HAS CO-SPONSORED THE PAST TWO IOM ABOVE-MENTIONED 
CONFERENCES. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) 28.C:  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY ANTI-TRAFFICKING 
INFORMATION OR EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS. 
 
¶12.  (SBU) 28.D:  THE SARG SUPPORTS A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS 
WHICH SEEK TO EMPOWER THOSE SYRIANS MOST THEORETICALLY AT 
RISK OF TRAFFICKING (ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT 
SYRIANS ARE TRAFFICKED FROM SYRIA).  MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS 
ARE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE SYRIAN WOMEN'S UNION (SWU), A 
 
GOVERNMENT-AFFILIATED ORGANIZATION THAT MAINTAINS HEALTH 
CLINICS AND OFFERS COUNSELING AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING 
PROGRAMS FOR SYRIA WOMEN.  SYRIA'S CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR 
EQUALITY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN AND EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. 
MOREOVER, THE GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TO OVERCOME TRADITIONAL 
DISCRIMINATORY ATTITUDES TOWARD WOMEN AND ENCOURAGED WOMEN'S 
EDUCATION BY ENSURING EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING UNIVERSITIES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE 
GOVERNMENT PROVIDED FREE, PUBLIC EDUCATION TO CITIZEN 
CHILDREN FROM PRIMARY SCHOOL THROUGH UNIVERSITY.  EDUCATION 
IS COMPULSORY FOR ALL CHILDREN, MALE AND FEMALE, BETWEEN THE 
AGES OF 6 AND 12.  ACCORDING TO A 2005 JOINT STUDY BY THE 
UNDP AND THE SYRIAN STATE PLANNING COMMISSION, 49.6 PERCENT 
OF STUDENTS THROUGH THE SECONDARY LEVEL WERE FEMALE.   THE 
SARG PERMITS IRAQI CHILDREN DISPLACED BY THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ 
TO ATTEND SYRIAN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR 
FREE.  SOME IRAQI CHILDREN IN SYRIA, HOWEVER, ARE PROBABLY 
NOT ATTENDING SCHOOL, FOR FEAR OF DRAWING ATTENTION TO THEIR 
FAMILY'S PRESENCE HERE OR FOR A LACK OF SCHOOL RECORDS AND 
MONEY FOR INCIDENTALS. 
 
¶13.  (SBU) 28.E:  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY 
TRAFFICKING-SPECIFIC PROGRAMS OR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN 
GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS AND NGOS OR OTHER RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS 
TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING; HOWEVER, THE IOM AND OTHER EMBASSIES 
HAVE STATED IN THE PAST THAT THE SARG HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO 
AD HOC REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE ON TRAFFICKING-RELATED MATTERS. 
 
¶14.  (SBU) 28.E:  THE GOVERNMENT MONITORS SYRIAS BORDERS 
RELATIVELY CLOSELY, BUT SHARES IMMIGRATION AND MIGRATION 
STATISTICS WITH NON-SARG OFFICIALS SELECTIVELY.  POST IS NOT 
AWARE OF CURRENT SCREENING FOR POTENTIAL TRAFFICKING VICTIMS 
AT THE BORDER.  IN 2006, IOM RECEIVED FUNDING FOR THE 
TRAINING OF MINISTRY OF INTERIOR IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS, AS 
WELL AS GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO CONDUCT THE TRAINING IN 
¶2007.  THE TRAINING CONTAINS A COUNTER-TRAFFICKING COMPONENT. 
 
¶15.  (SBU) 28.G:  FOLLOWING IOM'S SEPTEMBER 2005 WORKSHOP, 
THE SARG ISSUED DECREE 5114 ON THE CREATION OF A GOVERNMENT 
COMMITTEE TO FORMULATE A COMPREHENSIVE DRAFT LAW TO COMBAT 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS AND TO DRAFT A SET OF RULES TO 
REGULATE AGENCIES THAT RECRUIT FOREIGN WORKERS TO SYRIA. 
POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER ANTI-TRAFFICKING-IN-PERSONS 
WORKING GROUP OR SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT.  POST IS NOT AWARE 
OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ANTI-CORRUPTION TASK FORCE. 
 
¶16.  (SBU) 28.H:  POST IS NOT AWARE OF A GOVERNMENT NATIONAL 
PLAN TO ADDRESS TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶17.  (SBU) 29.A:   SYRIA HAS NO LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY 
PROHIBIT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A 1961 
ANTI-PROSTITUTION LAW THAT IMPOSES PUNISHMENT AND 
INCRIMINATES BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE PURPOSE 
OF PROSTITUTION, ACCORDING TO A STUDY COMPILED FOR IOM BY A 
PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DAMASCUS' 
FACULTY OF LAW.  A SECURITY MOU SIGNED IN LATE 2006 BETWEEN 
THE SYRIAN AND IRAQI GOVERNMENTS PLEDGES TO COUNTER 
TRAFFICKING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.   TRAFFICKING IS NOT 
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE SYRIAN PENAL CODE, BUT THERE 
ARE LEGAL TEXTS IN SYRIA THAT COULD FORM THE BASIS FOR 
FURTHER LEGISLATION TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, 
ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF DAMASCUS STUDY.  THE SYRIAN 
CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR REGULATION OF WORKING HOURS, 
ACCORDING TO THE STUDY.  DECREE 81 OF 2006 THAT REGULATES 
DOMESTIC WORKER AGENCIES PROVIDES GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR 
EMPLOYEE CONTACTS, STIPULATING THAT WORKER RIGHTS BE 
RESPECTED, ESPECIALLY "PROVISION OF CLOTHING, FOOD, MEDICINE, 
ACCEPTABLE PLACE FOR THE SLEEP AND REST OF THE WORKER AND 
UNDERTAKING TO PAY OUT THE MONTHLY SALARY AT THE END OF EACH 
MONTH AND ....SUFFICIENT PERIODS FOR REST AND ANNUAL LEAVE 
AND NOT TO ABUSE OR BEAT HER UNDER THE THREAT OF JUDICIAL 
PROSECUTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXISTING LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS." 
 
¶18.  (SBU) 29.B:  POST IS NOT AWARE OF SPECIFIC PENALTIES 
UNDER SYRIAN LAW FOR TRAFFICKING PEOPLE FOR SEXUAL 
EXPLOITATION. 
 
¶19.  (SBU) 29.C:  THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC ANTI-TRAFFICKING 
LAWS.  HOWEVER, THE 2006 DECREE STATES THAT DOMESTIC WORKER 
AGENCIES THAT VIOLATE THE DEGREE WOULD BE PUNISHED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 756 OF THE GENERAL PENAL CODE, WHICH 
STIPULATES THAT VIOLATORS MAY BE IMPRISONED FOR AN 
 
UNDETERMINED LENGTH OF TIME AND/OR FINED UP TO 100 SYRIAN 
POUNDS (ABOUT USD TWO). 
 
¶20.  (SBU) 29.D:  RAPE AND FORCIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE 
ADDRESSED IN THE 1949 PENAL CODE; PENALTIES FOR SEX CRIMES 
WERE REVISED IN 1985.  THE MINIMUM SENTENCE FOR RAPE OR 
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT; THE MAXIMUM 
SENTENCE IS 15 YEARS--OR 21 YEARS IF THE VICTIM IS A MINOR 
BETWEEN THE AGES OF 12 AND 15.  IF THE VICTIM IS LESS THAN 12 
YEARS OLD, THE MINIMUM SENTENCE IS 15 YEARS IMPRISONMENT. 
HOWEVER, THE PERPETRATOR IS ABSOLVED OF ALL CRIMINAL GUILT IF 
HE AGREES TO MARRY THE VICTIM.  IF THE VICTIM IS TOO YOUNG 
FOR MARRIAGE, THE RAPIST RECEIVES A LONGER PRISON SENTENCE. 
FOR KIDNAPPING OF WOMEN, THE PENALTY IS IMPRISONMENT FOR 
THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.  THE PENALTY FOR DEFLOWERING A VIRGIN 
IS FIVE YEARS.  THE PENALTY FOR MOLESTATION OF A MINOR LESS 
THAN FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE IS EIGHTEEN MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT. 
FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO FACILITATE TRAVEL OF SYRIAN WOMEN ABROAD 
TO WORK AS PROSTITUTES, ARTICLE 3 OF LAW 10 OF 1961 
STIPULATES IMPRISONMENT OF ONE TO FIVE YEARS AND A FINE OF 
1,000 TO 5,000 SYRIAN POUNDS (ABOUT USD $20 TO $100).  IF 
MORE THAN ONE VICTIM IS INVOLVED, OR IF THE VICTIM IS LESS 
THAN 16 YEARS OLD OR IS A PAID SERVANT, THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE 
INCREASES TO SEVEN YEARS. 
 
¶21.  (SBU) 29.E:  PROSTITUTION IS ILLEGAL IN SYRIA.  IN 
ADDITION, THE SYRIAN PENAL CODES DEBAUCHERY LAW CRIMINALIZES 
PROSTITUTION OF ANY KIND.  PROSTITUTION IS DEFINED AS 
OCCURRING WHEN ANY PERSON LURES, SEDUCES, INDUCES, ASSISTS 
WITH, OR FACILITATES ANOTHER PERSONS COMMITMENT OF 
FORNICATION OR ADULTERY.  THE PENALTY FOR PROSTITUTION UNDER 
THE PENAL CODE IS IMPRISONMENT FOR THREE MONTHS TO THREE 
YEARS AND PAYMENT OF A FINE OF 1,000-3,000 SYRIAN POUNDS 
(ABOUT $20-60).  IN THE PAST, POST HAS RECEIVED ANECDOTAL 
REPORTS THAT CABARETS WITH DANCERS WHO DOUBLE AS PROSTITUTES 
OPERATE THROUGHOUT SYRIA WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF LOCAL POLICE 
WHO ARE BRIBED TO IGNORE THE PROBLEM. 
 
¶22.  (SBU) 29.F:  POST IS NOT AWARE OF INSTANCES IN WHICH 
TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED IN SYRIA. 
 
¶23.  (SBU) 29.G:  IN THE AREA OF DOMESTIC WORKERS, BOTH 
SYRIAN AND FOREIGN RECRUITMENT AGENCIES ILLEGALLY RECRUITED 
ETHIOPIANS AND SOUTHEAST ASIANS TO COME TO SYRIA FOR 
EMPLOYMENT.  CABARETS REPORTEDLY ALSO USE LOCAL AND FOREIGN 
AGENTS TO RECRUIT DANCERS.  WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTAL BUT 
UNCONFIRMED EVIDENCE THAT IRAQI CRIMINAL GANGS MAY BE LINKED 
TO THE TRAFFICKING OF IRAQI WOMEN TO AND THROUGH SYRIA FOR 
PROSTITUTION.  POST HAS NO EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THESE ACTIVITIES OR OF HOW PROFITS 
ARE CHANNELED. 
 
¶24.  (SBU) 29.H:  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE SAID IN THE PAST 
THEY ACTIVELY PURSUE ILLEGAL MIGRATION CASES. WHILE THEY HAVE 
ASSISTED EMBASSIES AND THE IOM "BEHIND THE SCENES" WITH 
TRAFFICKING-RELATED ISSUES, THERE IS NO PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF 
THE PROBLEM OR PUBLICIZED GOVERNMENT STRATEGY TO ADDRESS IT. 
IN THE PAST, WESTERN EMBASSIES HAVE PROVIDED TRAINING TO 
SYRIAN OFFICIALS ON HOW TO RECOGNIZE, INVESTIGATE, AND 
PREVENT ILLEGAL MIGRATION; THE TRAINING HAS NOT SPECIFICALLY 
FOCUSED ON TRAFFICKING.  POST IS NOT AWARE OF THE SPECIFIC 
TECHNIQUES USED TO MONITOR THE BORDER OR OF LAWS THAT 
PROHIBIT THE POLICE FROM ENGAGING IN COVERT OPERATIONS. 
 
¶25.  (SBU) 29.I:  AS NOTED ABOVE, IOM HAS FUNDING AND 
AUTHORIZATION TO TRAIN MINISTRY OF INTERIOR IMMIGRATION 
OFFICIALS IN 2007 ON BORDER MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING A COMPONENT 
ON TRAFFICKING. 
 
¶26.  (SBU) 29.J:  THE GOVERNMENT HAS INFORMALLY DISCUSSED 
INCIDENTS OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS THROUGH 
THEIR EMBASSIES IN DAMASCUS AND HAS ASSISTED FOREIGN 
EMBASSIES AND THE IOM WITH CASES INVOLVING TRAFFICKED 
INDIVIDUALS.  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY INSTANCES OF 
COOPERATIVE INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS ON TRAFFICKING 
SPECIFICALLY. 
 
¶27.  (SBU) 29.K:  POST HAS NO INFORMATION ON EXTRADITION OF 
TRAFFICKERS. 
 
¶28.  (SBU) 29.L:  ALTHOUGH OFFICIAL POLICY IS THAT ALL 
NON-ARAB VISITORS TO SYRIA MUST HAVE VISAS BEFORE ARRIVING, 
IN THE PAST YOUNG INDONESIAN WOMEN WHO COME TO WORK AS 
DOMESTIC HELPERS APPARENTLY REGULARLY RECEIVE VISAS ISSUED BY 
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OFFICIALS AT THE AIRPORT.  IT IS NOT 
CLEAR HOW THE RUMORED SHAKE-UP AT THE MINISTRY OF INTERIORS 
IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT AND DECREE 81 WILL AFFECT THIS 
 
PRACTICE.  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER SARG INVOLVEMENT OR 
TOLERANCE OF TRAFFICKING. 
 
¶29.  (SBU) 29.M:  POST IS UNAWARE OF ANY EXAMPLES OF 
TRAFFICKING-RELATED CORRUPTION BEING PROSECUTED, BUT NOTES 
THE RECENT RUMORED FIRING OF IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS AT THE 
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR. 
 
¶30.  (SBU) 29.N:  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CHILD SEX TOURISM 
IN SYRIA. 
 
¶31.  (SBU) 29.O:  SYRIA HAS SIGNED BUT NOT RATIFIED: 
 
-- UN CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME AND 
THE RELATED PROTOCOL TO PREVENT, SUPPRESS, AND PUNISH 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN. 
 
SYRIA HAS SIGNED AND RATIFIED: 
 
-- ILO CONVENTIONS 29 AND 105 ON FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOR; 
 
-- ILO CONVENTION 182 CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION AND 
IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE WORST FORMS OF 
CHILD LABOR; 
 
-- THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN IN 2002, WITH RESERVATIONS TO 15 
ARTICLES; 
 
-- CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD (BUT HAS NOT SIGNED 
THE OPTIONAL PROTOCOL ON THE SALE OF CHILDREN, CHILD 
PROSTITUTION, AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY). 
 
¶32.  (SBU) 30.A:  THE GOVERNMENT HAS LIMITED MEANS AND DOES 
NOT HAVE DEDICATED SHELTERS FOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS NOR DOES 
IT PROVIDE COUNSELING OR LEGAL ASSISTANCE.  SUCH SERVICES ARE 
LIMITED IN SYRIA, AND ARE PRIMARILY PROVIDED THROUGH 
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARITY GROUPS.  (FOR EXAMPLE, 
POST IS AWARE THAT THE INDONESIAN EMBASSY HAS A SHELTER WITH 
10 ROOMS ON ITS EMBASSY GROUNDS IN THE EVENT THAT A WOMAN 
ESCAPES TO THE EMBASSY SEEKING ASSISTANCE.) JUVENILE VICTIMS 
OF RAPE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT, AS WELL AS MINORS ACCUSED OF 
PROSTITUTION, ARE HOUSED IN DEDICATED JUVENILE DETENTION 
FACILITIES, WHICH PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND VOCATIONAL 
TRAINING.  IOM IS SEEKING FUNDING TO TRAIN WORKERS FOR A 
SHELTER FOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS THAT WOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY 
THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS AND LABOR.  SEPARATELY, DURING 
THE 2006 HIZBALLAH-ISRAEL CONFLICT, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT 
GRANTED ENTRY TO AND HELPED FACILITATE THE TEMPORARY STAY AND 
THEN VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION OF AN ESTIMATED 13,000 
THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS FROM A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, ACCORDING 
TO IOM.  DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS IN SYRIA NOTE THAT SOME OF THESE 
THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS WERE ILLEGAL WORKERS EMPLOYED IN 
LEBANON. 
 
¶33.  (SBU) 30.B:  ACCORDING TO EMBASSY SOURCES, THE SARG DOES 
NOT PROVIDE FUNDING TO FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC NGOS FOR PROVISION 
OF SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING, ALTHOUGH IT DOES 
SUPPORT THE SYRIAN WOMENS UNIONS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE 
EMERGENCY RELIEF AND EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO WOMEN IN 
SYRIA. 
 
¶34.  (SBU) 30.C:  POST HAS NO INFORMATION ON THE TREATMENT OF 
TRAFFICKED PERSONS WHO COME TO THE CUSTODY OF POLICE 
OFFICIALS.  POST IS NOT AWARE OF A REFERRAL PROCESS FOR 
VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING. 
 
¶35.  (SBU) 30.D:  THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC COUNTER-TRAFFICKING 
LAWS IN SYRIA THAT PROVIDE FOR THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS.  POST 
HAS NO SPECIFIC DETAILS ON THE TREATMENT OF VICTIMS. 
 
¶36.  (SBU) 30.E:  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY EXAMPLES OF 
VICTIMS PARTICIPATING IN THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF 
TRAFFICKERS.  DECREE 81 REQUIRES DOMESTIC WORKER AGENCIES TO 
PUT DOWN A USD 1 MILLION GUARANTEE, WHICH SOME CONTACTS 
ASSERT COULD BE USED FOR A VICTIM RESTITUTION PROGRAM. 
 
¶37.  (SBU) 30.F:  POST HAS NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR VICTIMS AND 
WITNESSES OF TRAFFICKING. 
 
¶38.  (SBU) 30.G:  THERE IS NO SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR SYRIAN 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN HOW TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO 
TRAFFICKED VICTIMS.  THERE IS NO TRAINING FOR SYRIAN EMBASSY 
AND CONSULATE PERSONNEL SERVING ABROAD.  WE ARE UNAWARE OF 
ANY EFFORTS BY THE MFA TO ENCOURAGE EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES 
TO DEVELOP ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANY NGOS, INCLUDING 
 
THOSE THAT SERVE TRAFFICKED VICTIMS. 
 
¶39.  (SBU) 30.H:  POST IS UNAWARE OF INSTANCES OF SYRIANS 
BEING TRAFFICKED.  POST IS LIKEWISE UNAWARE OF GOVERNMENT 
EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO ANY REPATRIATED SYRIAN 
NATIONALS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING. 
 
¶40.  (SBU) 30.I:  THERE ARE VERY FEW INTERNATIONAL NGO'S 
OPERATING IN SYRIA.  RELIEF AND SOCIAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED SYRIAN WOMEN'S UNION AND 
RELIGIOUS AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.  THE IOM HAS WORKED 
ON AN INFORMAL BASIS WITH TRAFFICKING VICTIMS WHO HAVE 
CONTACTED THEIR OFFICES SEEKING ASSISTANCE.  AS NOTED ABOVE, 
IOM ALSO ORGANIZED WITH THE SYRIAN MINISTRY OF INTERIOR 
COUNTER-TRAFFICKING WORKSHOPS IN SEPTEMBER 2005 AND FEBRUARY 
2007 TO SUPPORT THE SARG IN EFFORTS TO DRAFT 
COUNTER-TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION.
