Â¶1. (SBU) On August 15 we shared reftel letters from NNSA Deputy 
Administrator Tobey and Ambassador Guhin to Rosatom Deputy Directors 
Spasskiy and Kamenskikh, as well as the accompanying U.S. comments 
on the draft joint statement on plutonium disposition.  Kamenskikh 
has agreed to meet with Deputy Administrator Tobey and Ambassador 
Guhin on August 29.  Spasskiy only returned from vacation on August 
20, and that meeting request is still pending.  Rosatom is currently 
reviewing the latest round of U.S. comments, including our request 
for clarification on additional donor funding, and we do not expect 
to receive an official response before the August 29 meeting.
