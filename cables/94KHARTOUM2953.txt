SUBJECT: TURABI CALLS FOR JIHAD TO CREATE AN ISLAMIC 
SUDAN 
 
¶1.  ACCORDING TO THE JUNE 9 SUDANESE PRESS, NATIONAL 
ISLAMIC FRONT LEADER AND DE FACTO RULER OF SUDAN, 
HASAN AL TURABI TOLD STUDENTS ATTENDING A CONFERENCE 
OF SUDAN'S STUDENT UNIONS, THAT THE UNITY OF SUDAN 
AND THE CREATION OF AN ISLAMIC STATE COULD NOT BE 
ACHIEVED EXCEPT THROUGH A JIHAD.  ACCORDING TO 
TURABI, THE MAIN DANGER FACING ISLAM IS THE WESTERN 
COALITION WHICH OPPOSES IT.  HE ASSERTED, HOWEVER, 
THAT THE WEAPON OF JIHAD TERRIFIES THE WEST BECAUSE 
OF THE WEAKNESS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION.  THE 
CHALLENGES TO ISLAM MUST BE CONFRONTED STRONGLY HE 
ADDED.  THIS MESSAGE APPLIED NOT JUST TO SUDAN BUT TO 
ALL MUSLIMS WHEREVER THEY RESIDE. 
 
¶2.  COMMENT: THIS IS VINTAGE TURABI AND HELPS TO 
EXPLAIN THE THE DEEP SKEPTICISM WITH WHICH SOUTHERN 
SUDANESE APPROACH PEACE TALKS WITH THIS GOVERNMENT. 
AT THE SAME TIME THE GOS IS OFFERING SOUTHERNERS 
FEDERALISM AND PERHAPS EVEN AUTONOMY, THE REAL POWER 
BEHIND SUDAN'S PRESIDENTIAL THRONE IS CALLING UPON 
MUSLIM YOUTH TO LAUNCH A JIHAD TO INSURE A UNITED AND 
AN ISLAMIC SUDAN.
