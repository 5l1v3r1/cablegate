SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2.  (U)    In response to United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1803 and the Financial Action Task Force's 
February 2008 statement on the deficiencies of Iran's 
anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing 
(AML/CFT) regime, the U.S. Treasury Department Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an advisory on 
March 20 to U.S. financial institutions on the risks to the 
international financial system arising from the these 
deficiencies.  The advisory urges all financial institutions 
to take into account the risk arising from the deficiencies 
in Iran's AML/CFT regime, as well as all applicable U.S. and 
international sanctions programs, with regard to any possible 
transactions with Iranian financial institutions provided in 
the advisory. 
 
---------- 
OBJECTIVES

delivering the advisory.  USUN is authorized to permit the 
Committee to share this document with other UN Members 
outside of the committee and to post to its own website.

TEXT OF U.S ADVISORY 
-------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U)  The following Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network (FinCEN) advisory was issued to U.S. financial 
institutions on March 20, it is also available at: 
www.fincen.gov/fin-2008-a002.pdf. 
 
 
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing 
this advisory to supplement information previously provided 
on serious deficiencies present in the anti-money laundering 
systems of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Financial Action 
Task Force (FATF) stated in October 2007 that Iran's lack of 
a comprehensive anti-money laundering and combating the 
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime represents a 
significant vulnerability in the international financial 
system. In response to the FATF statement, Iran passed its 
first AML law in February 2008. The FATF, however, reiterated 
its concern about continuing deficiencies in Iran's AML/CFT 
system in a statement on February 28, 2008. Further, on March 
3, 2008, the United Nations Security Council passed 
Resolution 1803 (UNSCR 1803), calling on all states to 
exercise vigilance over activities of financial institutions 
in their territories with all banks domiciled in Iran and 
their branches and subsidiaries abroad. The FATF statement, 
combined with the UN's 
specific call for vigilance, illustrates the increasing risk 
to the international financial system posed by the Iranian 
financial sector, including the Central Bank of Iran. 
 
Iran's AML/CFT deficiencies are exacerbated by the Government 
of Iran's continued attempts to conduct prohibited 
proliferation related activity and terrorist financing. 
Through state-owned banks, the Government of Iran disguises 
its involvement in proliferation and terrorism activities 
through an array of deceptive practices specifically designed 
to evade detection. The Central Bank of Iran and Iranian 
commercial banks have requested that their names be removed 
from global transactions in order to make it more difficult 
for intermediary financial institutions to determine the true 
parties in the transaction. They have also continued to 
provide financial services to Iranian entities designated by 
the UN Security Council in its Resolutions 1737 and 1747. The 
U.S. Department of the Treasury is particularly concerned 
that the Central Bank of Iran may be facilitating 
transactions for sanctioned Iranian banks. 
 
UNSCR 1803 calls on member states to exercise vigilance over 
the activities of financial institutions in their territories 
with all banks domiciled in Iran, and their branches and 
subsidiaries abroad. While Bank Melli and Bank Saderat were 
specifically noted, the United States urges all financial 
institutions to take into account the risk arising from the 
 
STATE 00029398  002 OF 003
