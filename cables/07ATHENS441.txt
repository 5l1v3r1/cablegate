Classified By: DEPUTY POLCOUNS PAUL CARTER.  REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (C) On March 1, Poloff raised ref a points with MFA D1 
Directorate for International Organizations and 
Nonproliferation officer Dionyssios A. Kyvetos.  Kyvetos 
confirmed that Greece had not been invited to, nor did it 
send any officials to participate in, the February 22-23 Oslo 
cluster munitions conference.  Reiterating his position from 
an earlier discussion on ref b points, Kyvetos said Greece 
agreed with the U.S. position that favored dealing with 
cluster munitions within the framework of the Convention on 
Conventional Weapons (CCW) and not at a separate, non-binding 
conference such as the one held in Oslo.  Kyvetos was 
somewhat surprised and disappointed that certain nations, 
such as the UK, Japan, and France, who he claimed in November 
2006 had been opposed to a separate conference dealing with 
cluster munitions, in the end signed the joint statement at 
the conclusion of the February Oslo conference.
