Military Developments 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gaza was generally quiet overnight August 7; 
however three Qassam rockets were launched from Gaza toward 
the Western Negev on August 7 and an additional two were 
launched on August 8.  There were no reported injuries or 
damage. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In the West Bank, IDF special units arrested three 
wanted Palestinians near Qalqiliya on August 7. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A 48-year old Palestinian farmer from Duma in the 
northern West Bank was shot and killed August 6 and his son 
was moderately injured when unknown gunmen fired on their 
truck near the Zatara checkpoint.  Palestinian witnesses 
claim that the gunmen were Israeli settlers. 
 
 
Political Developments 
---------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Prime Minister's office in Ramallah received an 
envelope containing a suspicious substance on August 7, which 
resulted in several employees going to the hospital after 
being exposed to the envelope's contents.  The envelope was 
sent to a Bir Zeit University laboratory for tests. 
President Abbas ordered an investigation of the incident, but 
Hamas officials claim that the envelope was an "assassination 
attempt." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) PLC Speaker Aziz Dweik, who was arrested by Israeli 
forces on August 5, was transported to hospital from his 
detention center August 7.  There are conflicting reports as 
to the cause of his hospitalization, but Palestinian sources 
report that Dweik has a history of heart problems. 
 
Humanitarian Update 
------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Rafah crossing remains closed August 8.  PLO 
Chief Negotiator Sa'eb Erekat told the Consul General that he 
had been informed by the GOI that the crossing could open for 
two days (August 9-10) to allow individuals in the following 
categories to leave Gaza: businessmen, those returning to 
jobs overseas, students returning to study overseas, and 
humanitarian cases.  (Note: The Rafah crossing had been 
slated to open August 5, but this opening was canceled due to 
military operations in the area.  End note.)  Both the 
Karni/al-Mintar and Nahal Oz crossings are closed August 8 
but were operational August 7, according to USAID Gaza-based 
staff.  According to the USAID Gaza-based staff, 
Karni/al-Mintar crossing was closed for 48 hours in order to 
put in place new security arrangements. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) All ten electricity feeder lines from Israel into 
Gaza are operational on August 8, thereby meeting 50 percent 
of Gaza electricity demand.  The feeder line into the Rafah 
area, that had been damaged August 2, was repaired late on 
August 7 by the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company 
(GEDCO).
