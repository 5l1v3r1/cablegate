Â¶1. (SBU) EmbOffs delivered demarche points contained in ref to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Humanitarian Assistance Deputy 
Director Hisanobu Mochizuki October 10.  Mochizuki, while not ruling 
out additional contributions to UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) 
in the future, said the GOJ would not be making a further 
contribution at this time.  Mochizuki noted Japan had contributed 
$5.5 million in March 2008 for UNRWA's Nahr al-Bared camp and had 
contributed $700,000 in July 2007.  The GOJ would like to see 
additional time elapse before making further contributions for these 
UNWRA programs, Mochizuki said.
