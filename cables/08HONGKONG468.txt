¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), conducted 
a pre-license check at the Hong Kong University, Pediatric and 
Adolescent Medicine Department, No 21 Sasson Road, Pokfulam, Hong 
Kong (HK University). The purpose of the visit was to determine the 
suitability of HK University to be a recipient of Staphylococcal 
Enterotoxin B that is the subject of export license application 
D391076. The items (Export Control Classification Number 1C351) are 
valued at USD $126 and are controlled for chemical and biological 
weapons reasons (CB). The license applicant is Sigma Aldrich 
Chemical Company of Saint Louis, Missouri. 
 
¶3. On March 6, 2008, ECO and Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan 
visited HK University at the address listed above and met with the 
Director of the lab that is receiving the items, Mr. Davy Lee, as 
well as Dr. Mike Mackett, the University of Hong Kong's Biological 
Safety Officer.  The meeting occurred in the HK University 
laboratory where the items will be used as part of research on 
T-Lymphocytes. 
 
¶4.  Mr. Lee stated that the quantities in question are very small 
and will be preserved in a refrigerator in the lab where the meeting 
occurred.  The refrigerator is secured by a lock and access to labs 
is limited by electronic key card access. Dr. Mackett stressed that 
HK University had recently been favorably inspected by the CDC for 
safety and security measures in conjunction with unrelated research 
funded by the CDC that is also being conducted at the university. 
 
¶5. At the time visited, HK University appeared to be a suitable 
recipient of the subject controlled items since it cooperated fully 
with the PLC and provided information on HK University's proposed 
use of the items in Hong Kong as well as measures taken to secure 
the items.
