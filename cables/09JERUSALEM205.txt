Main Stories: 
------------- 
Top stories highlight the visit of U.S. Special Envoy Mitchell to 
the region and Israeli settlement activities.  All front pages 
highlight and Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida lead with lengthy 
quotes from statements by Special Envoy Mitchell from Cairo and 
Jerusalem.  The papers note that Mitchell stated in Cairo on January 
28, that the U.S. is grateful to Egypt for its efforts in realizing 
a ceasefire in Gaza.  Al Ayyam also stresses that Mitchell 
reiterating "full U.S. commitment" to achieve a sustainable, stable 
peace in the Middle East.  Al Quds and Al Ayyam highlight a January 
28 Mitchell quote, after his meeting with Israeli Premier Olmert in 
Jerusalem, stating that Washington will sustain "active commitment" 
to realizing a two-state solution, while Al Hayat Al Jadida 
highlights Mitchell's call for consolidating the truce in Gaza.  Al 
Hayat Al Jadida adds that Israeli Premier Olmert informed Mitchell 
that Israel will link the opening of Gaza crossings to the release 
of captured Israeli soldier Shalit.  All front pages report that 
Special Envoy Mitchell will meet with Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas in Ramallah on January 29. 
All dailies run inside articles demanding that Special Envoy 
Mitchell begin his work by picking up where the 2001 Mitchell report 
left off:  Calling for a halt to Israeli settlement activities.  Al 
Hayat Al Jadida runs lengthy excerpts of the report on an inside 
page and comments that, as Mitchell begins his first regional tour, 
an Israeli Peace Now organization report reveals a 60% increase in 
Israeli West Bank and Jerusalem settlement activities in 2008. 
Another inside report in Al Ayyam notes that German Foreign Minister 
Frank Steinmeier expressed Germany's appreciation of U.S. engagement 
and efforts in the Middle East and invited Mitchell to Germany. 
On its editorial page, Al Quds runs a political cartoon showing 
Special Envoy Mitchell in three frames:  In the first frame, 
Mitchell resolutely announces, "Sustained cease-fire!"  In the 
second frame, he announces, "Reopened Crossings!"  In the third 
frame, a disappointed Mitchell sighs, "Nobody's listening." 
All front pages report the findings of a recent study by the Israeli 
organization, Peace Now, revealing that Israeli settlement 
activities increased by 60% in the West Bank and Jerusalem area in 
Â¶2008.  Al Ayyam leads with a photo of an Israeli bulldozer 
demolishing a Palestinian house "where 45 people lived" in the East 
Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit Hanina, "with the construction of new 
houses in the Israeli settlement Pisgat Ze'ev appearing in the 
background..."  Al Hayat Al Jadida leads with an oversized photo of, 
"Pisgat Ze'ev settlement that continuously expanded during 2008." 
In contrast, Al Quds' lead photo keeps the focus on humanitarian 
needs in Gaza, showing a young Palestinian girl, sitting next to a 
plastic container of water, watching a wood fire, "amidst the rubble 
of her destroyed house." 
Israeli settlers organizing a rally in Tel Aviv is the subject of an 
AFP report on an inside page of Al Quds.  The story notes that 
settlers, "mobilized against anticipated U.S. pressure" to halt 
Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank and rallied against 
the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank. 
 
Al Ayyam leads front page coverage with a January 28 statement by 
Hamas leader Khaled Misha'al promising in Doha the, "surprise 
establishment of a new authority to replace the PLO."  Al Hayat Al 
Jadida front pages the news.  According to Misha'al, the body will 
represent the Palestinians in the Palestinian Territories and 
abroad.  Reporting also notes that Misha'al has sent a second letter 
to U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell stating that all military, 
security and political efforts will fail if they ignore the 
resistance."  Both front pages run a linked article about Misha'al 
 
JERUSALEM 00000205  002 OF 003 
 
 
telling a French journalist "several times" in a France Presse 
interview last month, before "the war on Gaza," that Hamas is 
willing to recognize Israel within the 1967 borders.  Meanwhile, Al 
Quds' front page reports that Hamas chief in Gaza Ismail Haniyah has 
sent a letter to President Obama urging him to, "avoid committing 
the same mistakes as the previous U.S. Administration." 
 
All front pages headline statements made by Palestinian Authority 
President (PA) Abbas during a January 28 meeting with EU foreign 
policy chief Solana in Ramallah.  Coverage quotes Abbas condemning 
the Israeli, "assault on our people [in Gaza]," adding that Israeli 
actions in Gaza are an obstacle to Palestinian reconciliation and 
the two-state solution.  Abbas also condemned continued Israeli 
settlement activities stating that they prove that Israel does not 
want peace.  Regarding the "war on Gaza," Abbas insisted that its 
aim was to divide the Palestinians, thereby preventing the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank, 
Gaza and Jerusalem.   For his part, Solana confirmed that European 
humanitarian aid will be channeled through the PA.  Solana also 
hinted at the possibility of the EU recognizing a Palestinian unity 
government under certain conditions.  Finally, speaking at a press 
conference after the Abbas-Solana meeting, PA Premier Fayyad added 
that ensuring "safe passage" between Gaza and the West Bank is an 
important requirement in unifying the Palestinian Territories. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida front pages, and all papers carry, a Reuters 
report on Gaza "citizens returning to work" in the Gaza-Egypt 
tunnels despite recent Israeli airstrikes.  The article notes that 
repair to tunnels resumed within hours of the January 28 airstrike. 
The article appears next to a photo, taken after the strike, of a 
Palestinian working in the entrance to a tunnel near the Gaza border 
area of Rafah.In other U.S. foreign policy news, the front page of 
Al Ayyam runs a Reuters story about President Obama promising to 
make "difficult decisions" regarding Iraq and Iran.  Meanwhile, Al 
Quds runs a AFP story on an inside page about Secretary Clinton 
"leaving her mark" during her first week of work, with the 
introduction of a new personal style and "smart diplomacy." 
Finally, Al Hayat Al Jadida reports on an inside page that U.S. 
Consul General Walles met with Palestinian Authority (PA) President 
Abbas on January 28.  Abbas discussed, "latest developments and PA 
efforts to alleviate the suffering of the people of Gaza.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1)  Al Quds editorial is titled, "We hope that Mitchell will be the 
last envoy to the region" (01/29):  "Some are optimistic about 
Mitchell's tour for two reasons:  First, he doesn't have stereotyped 
ideas or positions, and he isn't one of the extremists who had 
influence in the previous U.S. Administration.  Thus, he could be 
more objective than others.  Second, Mitchell arrives in the region 
just a few days after the inauguration of President Obama, and 
[Mitchell] is the first [in the new U.S. administration] to be sent 
[abroad], which indicates special [U.S.] interest in the region... 
If President Obama says, "judge me by my actions, not my words," 
then this [new maxim] is evident in the new U.S. envoy's travel to 
our region.  Things are neither complicated, nor new, nor vague. 
Rather, they are extremely clear:  Israeli withdrawal in exchange 
for peace and the Arab proposal, provide full answers to all 
questions.  They provide a historic opportunity to achieve peace in 
the region.  In addition to the proposal, there are the Road Map and 
Mitchell's own diary on settlements and violence, Annapolis, etc. 
and a long list of other proposals and ideas, all of which have not 
been implemented for one simple reason - Israel does not want to... 
We hope that the newly-arrived will be the last envoy... because we 
 
JERUSALEM 00000205  003 OF 003 
 
 
call for actions not words." 
 3)  Basim Abu Sumaya opines in Al Hayat Al Jadida under the title, 
"George Mitchell" (01/29):  "All the American envoy has to do, 
[keeping in mind that] he is an expert in Palestinian and Israeli 
affairs and was blasted by the Israelis following his report... is 
to pick up from where negotiations ended, meaning, go into the 
details of the issues... according to the vision of President Obama 
not that of [Obama's] predecessor...  We are looking for a practical 
tour not a fact finding tour... Mitchell should not go home before 
compiling a new report that includes [suggestions] for the peace 
process to move forward and the resumption of real negotiations."
