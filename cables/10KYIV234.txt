SUBJECT: UKRAINE: DEMARCHE ON DISTRACTED DRIVING DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 6703 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, Post delivered the distracted driving demarche on 
January 27 to Oleksiy Illyashenko, Deputy Head of Public Relations 
and International Affairs at the Ukrainian Ministry of the Interior, 
with the points and questions attached as a non-paper.  The Ministry 
of the Interior did not have any immediate response.  Post will 
report any substantive response septel. 
 
¶2. (U) Cell phone usage while driving has been prohibited in Ukraine 
by law since November 2008.  Yet, although police conduct campaigns 
against cell phone usage while driving at least annually, 
enforcement is spotty and drivers talking on their cell phones are a 
common sight. 
 
¶3. (U) In addition to cell phone usage restrictions, Ukraine's 
Cabinet of Ministers (CabMin) approved a draft law on February 2 
regulating placement of advertizing billboards along international 
highways in Ukraine to minimize distractions while driving.
