SUBJECT: CZECHS WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMPACT WITH IRAQ MINISTERIAL 
 
REF: STATE 43799 
 
Czech MFA desk officer for Iraq, Hana Jehlinkova, stated that 
the Czechs plan to participate in the International Compact 
with Iraq (ICI) Ministerial in Stockholm on May 29.  Normally 
Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg would attend an event of this 
significance.  Beginning the week of May 26, however, the 
Czech MFA has scheduled all of the Czech Ambassadors to 
return to Prague for their annual week of consultations as 
well as discussions related to preparations for the upcoming 
Czech EU Presidency in January 2009.  Thus, while no decision 
has been made yet, the Department of Middle East Affairs 
anticipates that the Foreign Minister will remain in Prague 
and that Deputy Foreign Minister Tomas Pojar will likely 
attend the ICI.
