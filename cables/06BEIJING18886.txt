¶1.  (SBU) China formalized its inability to co-host an ASEAN 
Regional Forum Seminar (ARF) on UNSCR 1540 in a September 7 
letter delivered to the Embassy.  Full text of the letter to 
Blair Hall, EAP/RSP Director, is contained para 2.  The 
letter was faxed separately to EAP/CM.  China would likely 
participate in the 1540 seminar, as it does in all other ARF 
activities, MFA Asian Affairs Department Regional Security 
Division official Ning Bo told poloff. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The letter, dated September 7, 2006, reads in full: 
BEGIN TEXT 
 
Mr. Hall, 
 
Thank you for your letter dated August 30, 2006. 
 
We appreciate the repeated efforts of your government to 
invite China to co-chair the ARF Seminar on the 
Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1540. 
Though we are not able to co-chair it this time due to 
various reasons, including budgetary restraints and schedule 
arrangement, we are willing to continue the exchange and 
coordination with all ARF participants on security issues 
including non-proliferation. 
 
Looking forward to our further contacts and cooperation. 
 
Sincerely, Ma Jia 
Director, Regional Security Division 
Asia Department 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
People's Republic of China
