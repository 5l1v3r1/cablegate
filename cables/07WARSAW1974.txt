assesments, per reftel, to the Polish Civil Aviation Office 
(PCAO).  However, econoff was unable to make an appointment 
at PCAO to discuss the demarche.  Katarzyna Cieniuch, an 
assistant to PCAO director Tadeusz Kruszynski, said that 
Kruszynski had already left for Montreal to attend the ICAO 
assembly as the Polish delegate.  She added that no one at 
the office would discuss the assessments issue until after 
Kruszynski had met with the other Eurpean Union delegates and 
discussed the issue.  Cieniuch also said that Poland would 
vote with the European Union on the assessments issue, but 
was not aware of any opposition to the U.S. proposal.
