SITUATION

Summary 

------- 

 

¶2. (SBU) House Committee on International Relations (HIRC) 

Senior Counsel John Mackey and HIRC Democratic Deputy Chief 

Counsel Paul Oostburg Sanz traveled to Argentina January 

10-13 to investigate the flow of narcotics out of the Andean 

region, through Argentina, to the U.S. and Europe.  The 

Staffdel concluded that the drug problem in Argentina is 

going to get worse before it gets better, especially 

considering the possibility of a weakening Bolivian 

commitment to combating cocaine production and shipment.  The 

Staffdel also concluded that Europe needs to be more involved 

in fighting the drug war on this side of the Atlantic, and 

that Argentine law enforcement officials should be sent as 

students to the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) 

in El Salvador.  End Summary.

Who, When, and Why 

------------------ 

 

¶3. (SBU) House Committee on International Relations Senior 

Counsel John Mackey and HIRC Democratic Deputy Chief Counsel 

Paul Oostburg Sanz traveled to Argentina January 10-13 to 

investigate the flow of narcotics out of the Andean region, 

through Argentina, to the U.S. and Europe.  The Staffdel met 

with high-ranking officials from the MFA and the Argentine 

Gendarmeria, and received extensive Embassy briefings. 

(Note: The Staffdel also focused on the status of the current 

investigation into the 1994 Jewish Community Center (AMIA) 

terrorist bombing.  That element of the trip is reported 

septel.)

Gendarmeria's Anti-Drug Chief Paints Worrisome Picture 

--------------------------------------------- --------- 

 

¶4. (SBU) The Staffdel discussed the regional narcotics 

situation during a January 11 meeting with Gendarmeria 

anti-narcotics chief General Eduardo Maiztegui and his staff. 

 The Gendarmeria is the federal force tasked with securing 

Argentina's land borders, and as such has major anti-drug 

responsibilities.  Despite continuing budget limitations that 

have hampered investment in training and equipment, the 

Argentine Gendarmeria's cooperation with the USG on 

anti-narcotics initiatives has been excellent. 

 

¶5. (SBU) Maiztegui began by extolling the relationship his 

agency has developed with the Embassy, and Mackey responded 

by asking whether the Gendarmeria enjoyed similar cooperation 

with the European nations to which almost all the cocaine 

transiting Argentina is destined.  Maiztegui described 

limited cooperation with Italy and France, but said it was 

not close to the scale or effectiveness of the Gendarmeria's 

work with U.S. agencies.  With cocaine seizures in Argentina 

at a ten-year high, indicating a significant increase in 

volume heading to Europe, Maiztegui said that he would 

appreciate greater European involvement in anti-narcotics 

work in Argentina. 

 

¶6. (SBU) Argentina is not a major drug-producing country, 

Maiztegui said, and most of the narcotics found in the 

country come from Bolivia.  Maiztegui expressed concern that 

political developments in Bolivia could translate into a 

larger drug transit problem for Argentina.  Mackey cautioned 

Maiztegui that transit countries quickly develop into user 

countries, and Maiztegui admitted that he believes Argentine 

consumption of narcotics has risen, especially in the 

interior of the country in what were previously drug-free 

areas, but there are no national statistics to confirm his 

 

suspicions.  Maiztegui said that smugglers who take illegal 

drugs through Argentina used to be paid in cash, but are now 

being paid in product with greater frequency, a change that 

inevitably results in greater local usage.  The Gendarmeria 

are also capturing many more Colombian nationals than ever 

before, and those Colombians are generally connected to the 

heroin trade in the U.S., according to Maiztegui. 

 

¶7. (SBU) Responding to Staffdel's query regarding the type of 

assistance that would be most helpful to his forces in their 

drug-fighting role, Maiztegui cited communications problems 

on the Bolivian border that could be ameliorated with better 

equipment.  He also said that the training Gendarmeria most 

needs at the moment is for intelligence analysts.  Mackey 

pointed out that such training was likely available at the 

International Law Enforcement Academy in El Salvador, and 

Maiztegui indicated a strong desire for assistance in sending 

personnel for training there.

MFA Sanguine on Bolivia 

----------------------- 

 

¶8. (SBU) The Staffdel met January 10 with MFA Undersecretary 

for Foreign Policy Ambassador Luis Cappagli and members of 

his staff.  Mackey asked Cappagli for his views on 

Argentina's anti-drug cooperation with Bolivia, and Cappagli 

said that president-elect Morales' position on the issue was 

clear: he will tolerate the cultivation of the coca plant for 

traditional uses only, not to produce cocaine.  Mackey 

pointed out that traditional uses are not what our countries 

have to worry about, but Office of Counterterrorism and Other 

Crimes Director Minister Marcelo Colombo Murua responded by 

saying those who produce cocaine are not Morales' people. 

The Staffdel mentioned the importance of keeping a careful 

watch on the number of cocaine labs being constructed in 

Argentina: an increase would spell trouble.  Colombo Murua 

responded by saying that Argentina and Brazil will attempt to 

coordinate closely with Bolivia on counternarcotics. 

 

------- 

Comment 

------- 

 

¶9. (SBU) Argentine law enforcement appears more sensitive 

than the MFA to the threat posed by increasing amounts of 

narcotics transiting Argentina.  All indications are that the 

drug problem in Argentina is going to get worse before it 

gets better, and it will likely require a more active 

European involvement as well as continued U.S.-Argentina 

cooperation to effect a positive change. 

 

----------------------- 

Staffdel Recommendation 

----------------------- 

 

¶10. (SBU) The Staffdel encourages the active and continuing 

participation of Argentine law enforcement personnel in the 

ILEA in El Salvador.  Mackey further recommends that the ILEA 

build intelligence analysis training into its curriculum.
