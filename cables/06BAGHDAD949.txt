RECONSTRUCTION TEAMS IN IRAQ 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Korean Ambassador Ki-Ho Chang met 
with IRMO Director Ambassador Daniel Speckhard on 
March 19 to gather details regarding USG intentions 
related to the development of the planned Erbil 
Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT).  Chang 
reiterated Korean interest in the program and 
relayed that the Korean National Security Council 
has established a working-level group to study the 
situation and make recommendations on the way 
forward.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
NSC Working Level Group Studying PRT Participation 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. (SBU) IRMO Director Ambassador Speckhard met with 
Korean Ambassador Ki-Ho Chang at his request on 
March 19. During this meeting, Chang reiterated his 
government's interest in the Erbil-based Provincial 
Reconstruction Team.  Chang informed Speckhard that 
the Korean National Security Council has formed a 
working group to study ROK participation, and he 
presented a list of questions from the working 
group.  Initial findings of the working group are 
supportive pending further study and a site visit to 
Iraq. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The questions from the working group 
addressed programmatic and operational support 
issues.  They sought to determine the level of 
support that could be expected from the USG, 
particularly related to funding provided by the USG, 
both to support the PRT and as funding for 
governance and reconstruction.  Their questions also 
covered security, organizational structure of the 
team, integration of KOICA activities, and the role 
of the Zaytun Division.  The Koreans are very 
concerned about the operational costs of the PRT. 
(Comment: We should anticipate that we will at a 
minimum be required to provide life support and 
administrative support for USG personnel assigned to 
a Korean-sponsored PRT.  End Comment.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Chang was interested in how the offices in 
Sulaymaniyah and Dohuk would be supported from the 
Erbil PRT.  Because of limitations placed on the 
Korean military by their National Assembly, the 
Koreans must limit their activities to Erbil 
Province.  We explained that offices in Sulaymaniyah 
and Dohuk would be composed primarily of locally 
employed staff, with support provided by USG 
personnel assigned to the Erbil PRT and with 
movement security provided by contracted security 
forces. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
More CERP for Zaytun Division; a Larger IZ Facility 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) At the conclusion of the discussion on the 
PRT, Chang made a point of requesting our support in 
obtaining more CERP funding for the Zaytun Division. 
We explained that there was $375 million for OIF 
CERP in the Supplemental request, which should be 
distributed later this year.  Chang also requested 
support for obtaining a larger facility within the 
IZ to house the Korean Embassy. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Conclusion.  The ROK clearly has an 
interest in an Erbil-based PRT.  However, the level 
of their commitment in terms of leadership, manpower 
and funding remains an open issue and one that will 
only be resolved in our favor with continued 
engagement in both Washington and in Seoul.  Given 
the importance of showing strong Coalition 
engagement in Iraq, we believe it is important that 
the Koreans are seen as leading the PRT, even if the 
US must provide the bulk of the staff and resources 
to support the initiative in Erbil.
