¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The final number of casulties from the 
October 29 suicide car bombs in northern Somalia's Somaliland 
and Puntland regions have not yet been confirmed.  In 
Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, reportedly three car 
bombs killed 29 and injured scores more.  In Bossaso, 
Puntland's commercial capital and largest city, two car bombs 
killed two Puntland Intelligence Service officers, according 
to officials.  To date, no organization has taken 
responsibility for the attacks.  Post has received no reports 
of American citizen casualties.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Three suicide car bombs were detonated in Hargeisa. 
 One bomb reportedly exploded inside Somaliland President 
Dahir Rayale's compound, killing the president's personal 
secretary, security chief, a senator and three staff.  At 
roughly the same time, a second suicide car bomb exploded at 
a security barrier just inside the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP), killing two Somali staff.  A third bomb 
exploded at the Ethiopian mission, killing three Ethiopian 
staff, 19 visa applicants and bystanders, and largely 
destroying the building.  According to the Somaliland 
president's office, the British will airlift four critically 
injured government employees to a French hospital in Djibouti 
for treatment.  UNDP staff have reportedly been evacuated 
from Somaliland. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Two car bombers attacked two separate Puntland 
Intelligence Service buildings in Bossaso.  Two Bossaso 
intelligence officers were killed and several wounded. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Somaliland Interior Minister told us they are 
agressively investigating the incident, and Somaliland's 
official website announced two arrests.  The minister said 
the attackers came to Hargeisa from Mogadishu, and our 
contacts report rumors of mobs threatening revenge against 
the city's southern Somalis.  Another contact reported 
Somaliland officials have identified two, or possibly three 
houses the bombers may have used.  NGOs and aid organizations 
in Somaliland and Puntland tell us they are evacuating their 
international staff for fear of more terror attacks or 
vigilante violence.
