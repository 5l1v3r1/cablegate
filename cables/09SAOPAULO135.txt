Title- "Darkness at noon" in Cuba 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-10) states: 
"....seven decades after the infamous Moscow Processes that allowed 
Josef Stalin to exterminate imaginary enemies of the Bolshevik 
elite, here the same pattern resurfaces on the unfortunate island of 
Castro, with the only difference being that in this case, the purged 
ones remain alive, bearing the humiliation of the farce they agreed 
to take part in to 'continue serving the Revolution'......in the 
Castro brothers gerontocracy there is nothing to be remodeled in 
politics or in economy. Because there is not a political life or a 
modern economy.  We must await the death of the last of them [Castro 
brothers] to see what comes next." 
 
Title- Purges show new challenges to Cuban regime 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (3-10) says: "....In 
Cuba internal problems also mirror external challenges.  With Barack 
Obama's arrival to power in the archrival U.S. and his gestures of a 
change in U.S. relations with Cuba, Raul Castro will [probably] be 
in an uncommon position....- [to see]  a proposal for peace and 
understanding [between Cuba and the U.S].  This is something 
absolutely encouraging, but equally dangerous for the Cuban 
bureaucrats, that they maintain a majority of their popularity 
thanks to the memories of the attempted Cuban invasion [Bay of 
Pigs], the odious economic embargo and the antagonistic political 
myopia from U.S presidents in relation to the island.  This way, a 
"closure" of the regime, unveiled by the purging [of Cuban 
officials], would be a preparation for the dialogue with the U.S. 
and not a negation".
