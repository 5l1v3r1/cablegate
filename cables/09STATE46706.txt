SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050124935 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 050124935 for the 
export of gyroscopes to Russia.  Embassy is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: unfamiliar foreign end-user Open Joint 
Stock Company (OJSC).  The company has appeared on a previous 
license but the firm's bona fides have not been established 
by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION MOSCOW: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate officials to establish the bona fides of 
unfamiliar foreign end-user OJSC and confirm that the 
gyroscopes will be used for the purpose stated on the 
license.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conducts a site 
visit to the company in order to provide Department with an 
assessment of its business operations and on-site security. 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will OJSC 
retain positive control over the gyroscopes at all times? 
  Will they be transferred or re-exported to any other users? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of the company's business?  Have they 
previously sought defense articles on the USML? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
END ACTION.
