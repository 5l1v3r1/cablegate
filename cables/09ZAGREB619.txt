(U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Vesna Vukovic, head 
of the MFA's UN office.  Vukovic said that the Croatian 
government shares our belief that the Goldstone report would 
be best dealt with in the Human Rights Council and indicated 
that the Croatian mission in New York would be coordinating 
with our USUN mission on the issue.  Croatia also is 
supportive of U.S. efforts to foster a comprehensive peace 
accord regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
