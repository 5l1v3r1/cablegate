SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: IRAN 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage June 18 on a Chinese woman who allegedly poisoned her 
Taiwan mother-in-law and husband; on the results of senior high 
school entrance exams; and on the political dynamics inside the KMT. 
 In terms of editorials and commentaries, a column in the centrist, 
KMT-leaning "China Times" commented on the post-presidential 
election unrest in Iran.  The column said it is unlikely that the 
"Color Revolution" that took place in Eastern Europe would happen in 
Iran, as Western countries are hoping.  The column predicted that 
the United States might have to face the reality of recognizing 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election after all.  End summary. 
 
"How to Settle Iran's Post-Election Unrest" 
 
The "International Lookout" column in the centrist, KMT-leaning 
"China Times" [circulation: 130,000] wrote (6/18): 
 
"... What is the United States going to do now?  If [the United 
States] insists upon expressing its support for [opposition 
presidential candidate] Mir-Hossein Moussavi and does not recognize 
[Iranian President] Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election, then, after the 
dispute is settled, it will be more difficult for the Obama 
administration to deal with Ahmadinejad.  It will not only be 
disadvantageous [for the Obama administration] in improving 
relations with Iran, but also will make it more difficult to break 
the Iran nuclear stalemate.  However, if the United States realizes 
that it is unlikely that a 'Color Revolution' will succeed [in Iran] 
and immediately recognizes Ahmadinejad's election, the United States 
will appear weak.  It is unlikely that the United States will 
recognize this fact, as China and Russia have done.  Instead, [the 
United States] will probably wait for Iran's Guardian Council to 
formally announce the result of the elections, and then recognize 
the fact with disappointment."
