Phnom Penh, 5 November 2008 
 
Dear President-elect Obama, 
 
We, Members of Parliament of the Sam Rainsy Party, the leading 
opposition party in Cambodia, sincerely congratulate you and all 
Americans living in the USA and abroad for making the choice for 
change.  Your victory today represents a triumph for democratic 
values, for an America that will embrace the differences and 
diversities of her people.  Your call for change was heard by 
millions and we are confident that actions will be taken in the 
months ahead to ensure that the message of hope you displayed 
throughout your presidential campaign will be realized. 
 
There are many hurdles that lay ahead but with your leadership we 
know they will be overcome.  Your election signifies real change in 
the political landscape and a commitment to improve the country for 
all citizens, regardless of race, creed or social standing. 
 
Your election in America resonates deeply with the Cambodian people. 
 America leads the world in the promotion of civil liberties, and 
Cambodia is its partner in this mission. 
 
Sincerely, 
/signed/ 
 
Sam Rainsy and Members of Parliament of the Sam Rainsy Party
