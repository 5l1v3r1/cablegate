¶1.  On May 5, Turkish MFA Americas Department Head Ilicak 
presented us a dipnote noting that the Department of 
Commerce's website www.aesdirect.gov used "historic, ancient 
and archaeological" place names for certain Turkish cities as 
well as their current Turkish ones, e.g., "Constantinople" 
and Istanbul are both used. 
 
 
¶2.  Citing the Third UN Conference on the Standardization of 
Geographical Names, the GOT requests that the website list 
only the Turkish names and discontinue use of the other names.
