SUBJECT: TURKEY: TGS FEELING ERGENEKON SQUEEZE 
 
REF: ANKARA 1083 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James Jeffrey for reasons 1.4(b,d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  Investigations into the Ergenekon case took 
a nasty turn with the revelation of what purports to be an 
original of the alleged military-penned anti-government 
"Action Plan," essentially a roadmap for bringing down the 
government and the Islamist Fethullah Gulen organization. 
The ensuing public outcry has put the military back on the 
defensive, prompting statements from the TGS trying to play 
down the issue and assure the public that it is investigating 
the new claims.  Pressure on the TGS is mounting as actively 
serving members of the military are summoned for questioning. 
 Meanwhile, the timing of the document's leak has further 
raised questions about the independence of the Ergenekon 
prosecutors.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The controversy surrounding an alleged military 
"Action Plan Against Fundamentalism" -- enumerating steps to 
undermine both the governing Justice and Development Party 
(AKP) and the Fethullah Gulen religious order -- reemerged on 
October 23, with the publication in Taraf newspaper of a 
letter, allegedly from a military officer to the prosecutor's 
office, purporting to contain an original copy of the plan. 
The text of the letter claims that then-Deputy Chief of the 
TGS, Hasan Igsiz, had ordered the drafting of the plan, that 
TGS Chief Ilker Basbug was aware of the project, and that the 
TGS had covered up its involvement during its investigation 
into the alleged plan in June.  Ergenekon prosecutor Zekeria 
Oz has reportedly summoned Colonel Dursun Cicek, the alleged 
author of the plan, and eight other active-duty soldiers who 
are accused of destroying evidence of military involvement in 
its drafting, for questioning. 
 
¶3. (C) In the wake of the new document's release, the 
military is back on the defensive.  Basbug met with Erdogan 
on October 29 in what was billed as a routine weekly meeting 
to discuss the case.  The meeting was anything but routine: 
it was held on Republic Day -- Turkey's most important 
secular holiday -- and was uncharacteristically followed by a 
press statement which stressed that the letter is merely 
evidence in support of an allegation and should be treated as 
such while the case is ongoing.  Before the meeting, the 
military had issued two statements to the press, one 
criticizing the leaks of court evidence to the press and the 
other announcing that military prosecutors had begun an 
investigation concerning the new evidence and reiterating the 
findings of military prosecutors in June to the effect that 
the then-available documents were of dubious quality. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The government appears to be playing good cop/bad 
cop concerning the new developments in the case.  Deputy 
Prime Minister Bulent Arinc has gone on the offensive, 
demanding the resignation from the army of all suspects tied 
to the plot who are still in active service.  Meanwhile, 
Prime Minister Erdogan has taken a higher road, calling 
accusations against the military unacceptable and declaring 
that the accusers should also testify in court. 
 
¶5. (C) Comment:  The first point to note here is that we are 
talking about the original piece of paper with the action 
plan -- from which, presumably, the copy, which hit the 
street several months ago, was made.  The fact that there is 
now an original in the hands of the authorities does not 
prove -- as yet -- that the document is authentic or a fake. 
The main significance of an original (aside from the fact 
that, if authentic, it indicates "moles" within the TGS 
trying to discredit their own organization) is that it will 
provide a forensics basis (watermarks, type of paper, 
specific printer attributes) to aid the investigation. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment (cont.):  Nonetheless, with the military 
having previously dismissed the first copy of the "Action 
Plan" documents as "mere bits of paper," the claim that the 
original document has been uncovered and sent to the 
prosecutor's office ratchets up the pressure.  If the courts 
find the document to be admissible evidence (whether rightly 
 
ANKARA 00001582  002 OF 002 
 
 
or wrongly), we will likely see calls for the resignation of 
increasingly higher-ranking military officials suspected of 
approving the alleged cover-up.  Calls for resignation of 
those involved -- not just from DPM Arinc but also among 
pundits, even respectable independent ones, such as Fikret 
Bila -- have already begun, and could quickly move up the 
chain of command as suspicion of a cover-up builds along with 
increasing doubt of military probity.  This would confirm in 
the minds of Turkey's copious conspiracy theorists that 
Ergenekon is synonymous with Turkey's miiltary-bureaucratic 
complex. 
 
¶7. (C) Comment (cont.):  The press is also rife with 
speculation that the timing of the leaked evidence is too 
neat to be coincidental.  Prime Minister Erdogan has too 
often taken aim at an easy target to deflect negative public 
opinion from a controversial policy.  Israel has been the 
standard whipping-boy in this regard.  Some journalists are 
speculating that the Ergenekon trial may be taking on the 
role of convenient bugbear when AKP falls afoul of public 
opinion.  The "original document" leak came on the heels of a 
Kurdish nationalist upswell surrounding the return to Turkey 
from Iraq of PKK members under the guise of a "peace 
delegation, causing a collective drop of support for AKP 
among nationalists.  The new developments related to the 
"Action Plan" have neatly supplanted the debate over the 
returnees in the news.  The uncanny timing of the new 
evidence reinforces allegations -- including a comprehensive 
report on the case by British scholar Gareth Jenkins and 
speculation about an unseemly row in the Supreme Board of 
Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) (REFTEL) -- that the Ergenekon 
case has been thoroughly politicized.
