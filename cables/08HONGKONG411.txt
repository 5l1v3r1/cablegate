¶9.  On February 14, 2008, the ECO and Commercial Assistant, Carrie 
Chan visited Walasey Limited and met with Mr. Ricky Law, Deputy 
General Manager of Walasey Technology Limited.  He stated that 
Walasey Limited was established in 1994.  It is the distributor and 
representative for certain brands of electronic components.  It is 
primarily an electronic components reseller and has six offices in 
mainland China.  The Hong Kong office acts as the contact window 
between those offices and outside suppliers.  This is because many 
of the company's employees in mainland China cannot speak English 
well and it is also easier to get items through mainland China 
customs via Hong Kong.  In effect, Walasey Limited acts as a 
consolidator and customs broker for items being sent to customers in 
mainland China.  Mr. Law stated that for some components, Walasey 
Limited is the exclusive distributor, while for others it is one of 
many (e.g., Kenet Inc.).  Walasey Limited's business focus is on 
communications components (base stations for SCDMA) and consumer 
applications (i.e., web cams and radio controlled clocks). 
 
¶10.  As to the other related companies, Mr. Law provided the 
following background at the meeting and by subsequent e-mail: 
 
Walasey Technology Limited:  Registered but not active. 
 
Bright Concept Trading Limited:  Owned by Mr. Zhang Zhi Tong (99.5 
percent) and Mr. Wong, King Bor (0.5 percent).  According to Mr. 
Law, this company is involved in the electronics trading business. 
 
M2C (Hong Kong) Limited:  Registered but not active. 
 
M2C Electronic Technology Limited:  This company is a developer, 
producer and marketer of business information displays 
(www.m2c-electronics.com).  During the February 14th visit, Mr. Law 
showed the ECO and Commercial Assistant Chan the premises of this 
company, located next door to the offices of Walasey Limited. 
According to Mr. Law, this company produces and manages the content 
display for nationwide information screens in various businesses. 
The R and D for this company is conducted in Fuzhou, mainland 
 
China. 
 
Mega Bright International Enterprise Limited:  Electronics trading 
company. 
 
Well Time Technology Limited:  Electronics trading company. 
 
Electrend Industrial Limited:  Electronics trading company. 
 
¶11.  As to the specific items in question, Mr. Law stated that there 
were two potential customers for these items.  The first is Jiangsu 
Luyang Electronic Instrument Group Co., Ltd. (www.lvyang.com).  By 
subsequent e-mail, Mr. Law provided the ECO with an internal order 
form from Walasey's Shanghai office and filled out by the company 
(located in Jiangsu province).  According to Mr. Law, this 
customer's project (involving the production of oscilloscopes) is 
still in the planning stages and they are only requesting a sample 
of the product. 
 
¶12.  According to Mr. Law, the second customer for the applicable 
items is Nanjing Nanrui electronic Tech Co., located in Nanjing, 
mainland China.  According to Mr. Law, this second customer will use 
the items in the production of high resolution medical devices. 
 
¶13.  The ECO found Mr. Law to be open and cooperative.  His 
explanations appeared credible and generally consistent with 
information independently obtained by the ECO.  At the same time, 
ECO is concerned by the large number of collocated and interrelated 
companies uncovered during this check and the lack of an apparent 
clear delineation between these companies and their business 
purposes.  Also, aside from the web site for Walasey and M2C, none 
of the other companies appears to have any web presence (typical for 
many electronics trading firms).
