SUBJECT: MORGAN TSVANGIRAI ADDRESSES MEDIA IN BOTSWANA 
 
¶1.  Zimbabwe Movement for Democratic Change Leader Morgan Tsvangirai 
spoke to and took questions from some 50 local and international 
media December 19 at a hotel in Gaborone.  Tsvangirai addressed 
issues including the abductions of MDC party members in Zimbabwe, 
the Global Political Agreement, Robert Mugabe's claim that MDC 
insurgents are being trained in Botswana, mediation by the Southern 
African Development Community, the cholera epidemic, and his status 
in Botswana. 
 
¶2.  On the status of abducted MDC party members, Tsvangirai said 
that he could not negotiate while his organization is being 
violated.  He set a date of January 1, 2009 for there to be 
resolution of the abductions or he could not continue to work with 
the Robert Mugabe regime. 
 
¶3.  Referring to the Global Political Agreement signed September 15 
with Robert Mugabe, Tsvangirai said that a partnership must have 
willingness on both sides for it to work.  Mugabe wants to stay in 
power at all costs and have the MDC as only a junior partner. 
Zimbabwe has no government, according to Tsvangirai. 
 
¶4.  Asked about the South African President's reported assertion 
that a deal would be struck by the end of this week, Tsvangirai 
found no basis for this since the necessary change to the Zimbabwe 
constitution (Amendment 19) to allow for a power-sharing arrangement 
would require at least a month to go through Parliament. 
 
¶5.  Tsvangirai denied Mugabe's claim that MDC insurgents are being 
trained in Botswana and added that it is not being done anywhere. 
He also said that South Africa has reported that there is no 
foundation for the allegation. 
 
¶6.  Addressing political mediation by Zimbabwe's neighbors, 
Tsvangirai called for SADC's continued engagement.  While it is said 
that SADC's role is key to resolving the situation in Zimbabwe, 
Tsvangirai wondered why more progress had not been made.  Answering 
a question, he later said that he respected the South African 
President as SADC chair and considered him to be an important 
influence to resolving the crisis. 
 
¶7.  Speaking to the cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe, Tsvangirai said 
that Harare is the center of it and that the MDC-controlled city 
council could have access to the means to address the outbreak if 
Mugabe's ZANU-PF party didn't stand in the way. 
 
¶8.  Taking a question about his status in Botswana, Tsvangirai noted 
that he was not a "leader-in-exile" but rather in the country 
temporarily while he waited for his travel documents.  He said that 
the MDC has no status in Botswana -- it is just a visiting political 
party from Zimbabwe -- but he asks that Botswana be sympathetic to 
the plight of Zimbabweans here.
