REF: STATE 93894 
 
¶1. We delivered reftel invitation and draft statement to 
Ibrahim Yagli, Head of Department at MFA's Office of 
Multilateral Economic Affairs.  He indicated that Turkey is 
considering the invitation and will decide on an appropriate 
representative to send, but no final decision has been made. 
 
¶2. On the broader topic of food security, Yagli referenced a 
recent meeting in Washington between MFA D/US Selim Kuneralp 
and Treasury Undersecretary-Designate for International 
Affairs Lael Brainard, noting that Turkey fully supports the 
activities of the FAO office based in Turkey but that it is 
still evaluating how it can best contribute in other ways to 
global food security. 
 
¶3. We also raised food security issues with Treasury 
Undersecretary Ibrahim Canakci, who said the GOT was still 
consulting internally on the food security agenda, 
particularly on the proposed trust funds, and had not yet 
decided its position.
