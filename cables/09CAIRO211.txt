(SBU) On February 4, 2009, Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population 
(MOHP) announced the country's 54th human avian influenza (AI) 
victim: a two-year-old boy from the Ganian district in the Suez 
Governorate.  The boy, the first AI victim in Suez, fell sick 
February 2, was hospitalized February 3, received Tamiflu the same 
day, and is in good condition.  MOHP's Central Laboratories and 
NAMRU-3 have confirmed the boy was struck by the H5N1 virus.  (SBU) 
While Egypt's young children have been hit hard by AI -- the boy 
from Suez is the 23rd victim here under age ten -- every one of them 
has survived (reftel.)
