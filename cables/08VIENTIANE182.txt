SUBJECT: UN SECURITY COUNCIL'S ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION 1803 
ON IRAN: DEMARCHE TO LAO GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: STATE 21770 
 
(SBU)  Charge delivered Reftel demarche to Saleumxay 
Kommasith, Acting Director General of the Department of 
International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, on March 20.  Mr. Saleumxay said that the Lao 
government would be vigilant in complying with the resolution 
and would submit a report to the UN as mandated.  He noted 
that, while Laos has diplomatic relations with Iran, it is 
not a nuclear state and it has no economic or financial links 
with Iran.  Therefore, the report is unlikely to contain any 
information beyond what the GOL has reported already.
