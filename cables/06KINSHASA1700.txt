SUBJECT: FDLR DENOUNCES U.S. SANCTIONS DECISION 
 
¶1. (U) The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda 
(FDLR) issued a statement November 1 calling the U.S. 
decision to impose UN sanctions against the group as "unjust, 
useless, unjustified and counterproductive." It claimed the 
group has never been involved in arms trafficking or in 
undermining regional security. It states the FDLR believes 
the sanctions will not resolve the crises in the Great Lakes 
region and calls for an inclusive dialogue to create a 
permanent solution. 
 
¶2. (U) The following is Embassy Kinshasa's unofficial 
translation of the statement: 
 
In regard to the sanctions imposed by the United Nations and 
the United States of America on the president of the FDLR, 
Dr. Ignace Murwanashyaka, claiming that he had violated the 
arms embargo in the Great Lakes Region, the Democratic Forces 
for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) categorically rejects 
these sanctions it judges unjust, useless, unjustified, and 
counterproductive. 
 
The FDLR declares that it is not involved in arms trafficking 
in the DRC or anywhere else and that it does not threaten the 
security of any country in the Great Lakes Region. The only 
ones responsible for threatening security and prosperity of 
the sub-region are those who have knowingly conceived, 
organized, financed, supported and maintained the endless 
wars that ravage the region; who continue their invasions; 
and who devastate the entire region in looting its riches. 
 
These sanctions therefore do not apply to the FDLR and were 
unjustly taken against its president in whom the FDLR renews 
its confidence and its unfailing support, and calls upon all 
who favor peace, justice and friendship between people to 
reject such sanctions. 
 
The FDLR remains convinced that unjust sanctions and the use 
of force cannot resolve the crisis in the Great Lakes Region. 
It is only through an honest, constructive and highly 
inclusive dialogue between the different protagonists that 
the recurring crises can find a final solution.
