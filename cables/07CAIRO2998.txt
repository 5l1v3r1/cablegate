¶1. (SBU) Independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm published a 
front-page, above the fold article on October 9 stating that 
GoE security services had arrested 62 members of a group 
affiliated with terrorist organization Takfir wa al-Higra, 
and accused them plotting to blow up the Ibn Khaldoun Center 
(IKC), headed by democracy activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim. 
According to press reports, the group planned to use a car 
bomb, and had targeted the IKC because of its links to 
"foreign elements," including the United States.  The reports 
also claimed that the group had been influenced by 
"extremists abroad," and that some of the accused had been 
planning to go to Iraq for jihad, and some had tried to 
travel to Syria a few days before, but had been prevented 
from doing so by Syrian authorities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) IKC staff did not respond to our October 9 inquiries 
regarding the allegations.  We will follow up and will report 
more details as we learn them.
