SUBJECT: F-16 BASING:  REQUEST FOR BASING REVIEW 
 
REF: (A) ISLAMABAD 3168 (B) ISLAMABAD 2794 
 
Classified By: Anne W. Patterson, for reasons 1.5 (b), (d). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Summary and Action Request.  Following Ambassador's 
July 21 meeting with Pakistan Air Chief Marshall Tanvir, post 
requests a review of paragraph 9 (basing and personnel 
restrictions) of the pending security notes for the $3 
billion sale of 18 block 52 F-16s to Pakistan before the 
Congressional hearing scheduled for August 16. 
 
¶2. (C)  The purpose of the sale was two-fold: to augment 
Pakistan's defensive capacity; and to send a strong political 
signal that the U.S. intends to remain engaged in Pakistan. 
Current basing and personnel restrictions make full use of 
the aircraft impractical, effectively sub-optimizing the 
capabilities of the aircraft and undermining the purpose of 
the sale.  Post believes there is scope to amend these 
restrictions in a way that both protects U.S. security 
interests and enables more effective use of the aircraft for 
Pakistani and U.S. interests. End Summary and Action Request. 
 
 
¶3.  (C)  Ref A reports on Ambassador's July 21 meeting with 
Pakistan Air Chief Marshall Tanvir to inform him that 
mid-life upgrades to Pakistan's existing F-16 and EDA F-16 
aircraft must occur outside of Pakistan. Tanvir reported that 
the Pakistan Air Force would base its new block 52 F-16s 
(currently in production) and some MLU aircraft at Shabaz 
Airfield in Jacobabad.  He requested information on the 
security survey soonest so the Pakistan Air force can begin 
making the necessary budget and engineering decisions 
necessary to comply with the security notes. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Tanvir stated that Shabaz would be an all F-16 base; 
however, he stressed the need to also base French 
manufactured Alouette rescue helicopters at Shabaz for safety 
reasons.  As we noted in Ref B, other foreign origin aircraft 
-- particularly Spanish made C-235s for supply and troop 
transport and Russian and Ukrainian built MI-17 helicopters 
for troop transport -- would also need access to Shabaz if 
the Pakistan Air Force were to efficiently carry out its 
day-to-day operations and training. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Post appreciates support for the waiver process we 
proposed in Ref B but also requests a review of the personnel 
restrictions to determine how they could negatively affect 
joint exercises and Pakistani pilot training. 
 
¶6.  Comment:  Strict interpretation and adherence to current 
basing restrictions will cause serious operational, training 
and safety problems for the Pakistan Air Force and will 
impose added costs beyond those expected to arise from the 
security survey.  Further, the basing restrictions, in our 
view, simply do not improve the security of U.S. technology. 
We believe it should be possible to monitor the security of 
the F-16s while allowing Pakistani-owned, foreign 
manufactured aircraft access to a different part of the same 
base.  We request Washington consider ways to both meet our 
national security needs and help Pakistan obtain the most 
operational value from their significant investment in these 
F-16s.
