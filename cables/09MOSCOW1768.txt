SUBJECT:  EXBS RUSSIA MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE 
JUNE 2009 
 
Summary:  This cable highlights activities of the Export Control and 
Related Border Security (EXBS) Russia Program Office for the period 
of June 01, 2009 to June 30, 2009.  End Summary 
 
¶1.  EXBS contractor Commonwealth Trading Partners (CTP) through its 
Russian partner, the Center for Export Controls (CEC), conducted 
export controls training in Vladivostok June 9-10 for approximately 
20 Russian Customs inspectors.  Specialists from the Federal Service 
for Technical and Export Control (FSTEK), Customs, and CEC updated 
the audience on major Russian export controls laws and changes to 
those laws, as well as Russian government agencies' areas of 
responsibility in upholding export controls regulations.  The 
training consisted of two parts:  day one was devoted to Russian 
export rules and regulations; and day two consisted of hands-on 
computer work with the Product Identification tool (PIT).  This 
software has been used by Russian Customs as a supplemental aid in 
identifying and classifying commodities presented for export. 
Seminar participants successfully used the PIT tool in day-long 
exercises meant to simulate real-life situations. 
¶2.  This was the last in a series of export controls training 
sessions for Federal Customs Service officers in Moscow and the 
regions.  In July, CEC will present a training class on export 
controls tailored to industry representatives. 
 
¶3.  EXBS Russia Advisor Joan Agerholm participated in the annual 
EXBS Advisors conference in Tbilisi, June 2-4.  In the opinion of 
this office, the meeting was of tremendous value in facilitating the 
exchange of ideas and information regarding programs and 
administrative issues, and in strengthening networks and working 
relationships. 
 
¶4.  On June 24, the EXBS Advisor and EXBS Program Coordinator held a 
long-awaited meeting with representatives of the export controls 
section within the Security and Disarmament Department of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry.  It was the Advisor's first meeting with 
MFA, consisting of a meet-and-greet, brief summary of EXBS Russia 
activities to date, and ideas for future cooperation.  MFA expressed 
interest in all of our ideas, but did not commit to any of them, and 
asked for additional information, which we have provided. 
 
¶5.  (Comment):  In our view, the meeting with MFA accomplished 
several modest goals:  maintained positive relationships with the 
export controls section of MFA; put forth program ideas which were 
not rejected; and introduced a new idea (possible partnership with 
an export controls training center in St. Petersburg).  MFA agreed 
to meet with us again in August to review what we had discussed at 
our meeting and to hear any additional suggestions we might have.
