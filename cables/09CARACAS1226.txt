¶1.  (SBU)  Following the fractious September 15 UNASUR Summit 
in Quito, President Chavez declared victory, claiming on a 
September 17 television broadcast that Colombia had been 
"completely isolated."  He said it was "embarrassing" that 
the Colombians could not even show the Defense Cooperation 
Agreement (DCA) to the UNASUR members without U.S. 
permission. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Chavez stressed that the DCA was a "threat" to 
Venezuela.  Speaking from Quito, Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Nicolas Maduro claimed that the USD 2.2 billion arms deal 
with Russia (reftel) was needed to defend Venezuela against 
the threat from the DCA.  Referring to media reports of 
comments by Secretary Clinton on September 15, Maduro charged 
that Secretary Clinton had "no moral standing" to criticize 
Venezuela's defense plans.  Venezuela's OAS Ambassador Roy 
Chaderton called Secretary Clinton's concern over Venezuela's 
arms deals a "false threat" and noted that the U.S. was the 
only country to ever use atomic bombs against other human 
beings.  Chaderton added that the DCA, when combined with the 
FOURTH FLEET and SOUTHCOM, are a "threat to the security and 
peace" of South America.
