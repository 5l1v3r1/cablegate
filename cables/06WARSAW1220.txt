REF: STATE 94236 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  In response to reftel guidance, both Embassy 
Warsaw and Consulate General Krakow convened a joint meeting 
(via digital video conferencing) of core EAC members at both 
posts on June 20, 2006 to discuss security planning for the 
four official American Independence Day celebrations 
sponsored by U.S. Mission Poland.  Those events are: 
 
Reception near Opole, Poland on June 27, 2006 
Reception in Chelm, Poland on June 30, 2006 
Reception in Krakow, Poland on July 4, 2006 
Reception at the Ambassador's residence in Warsaw, Poland on 
July 4, 2006 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  RSO Warsaw briefed meeting attendees that 
pedestrian and package security screening will be set up at 
entrance points for all four venues and that appropriate 
Mission local guard, surveillance detection, and local police 
support has been arranged and will be deployed to work each 
event.  At this time, the Mission has no information of any 
security threats concerning any of the four events.  RSO 
personnel will be on-hand at each event to manage security 
on-site and lead coordination with local police.  The joint 
meeting concluded with core EAC members agreeing that 
security measures planned for all four events are appropriate.
