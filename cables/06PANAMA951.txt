SUBJECT: PANAMANIAN JUDGE ORDERS DETENTION OF FORMER 
NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ALEMAN AND CRONIES 
 
REF: A. PANAMA 610 
 
     ¶B. 05 PANAMA 2292 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)   As first reported by Panamanian television early 
May 18, Panamanian Judge Adolfo Mejia has ruled that the 
money laundering case against former Nicaraguan President 
Arnoldo Aleman and cronies (reftels) will go forward.  Ruling 
on the evidence presented during a March 30 hearing, Mejia 
ordered Aleman and co-accused to be detained pending trial. 
This is a stunning blow to Aleman, and is the result of years 
of work by Panamanian and U.S. investigators and Panamanian 
prosecutors. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Upon receipt of the initial press reports, Embassy 
officers contacted Panamanian anti-corruption prosecutor 
Mercedes de Leon for a reaction to Judge Mejia's ruling.  De 
Leon was clearly pleased by the news, but cautioned that she 
had not yet received her copy of the written ruling.  Among 
the issues to be clarified is whether charges against any of 
the co-accused had been dismissed (Note:  press reports 
indicated that Ethel and Valeria Jerez may have been 
exonerated.)  De Leon promised to share copies of any 
relevant documents, including the judge's ruling, with USG 
officials.  She also signaled her intent to appeal decisions 
to dismiss charges against any of the accused. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Post will continue to monitor this case closely, 
including the possibility of appeals.  At our urging, 
prosecutors will request that the judge expeditiously issue 
arrest warrants, which can then result in the issuance of 
INTERPOL red notices.  It is not yet clear when the judge 
will schedule the beginning of the trial. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment:  Panama's Public Ministry, including the 
investigators and prosecutors who have worked on this case 
over the past several years, deserve kudos for their 
dedication to seeing Aleman brought to justice.  Attorney 
General Ana Matilde Gomez has been resolute in her personal 
commitment to this case.  We believe that the consistent 
strong message of USG interest in this case, expressed both 
here and in Washington, helped counter efforts by the defense 
to tamper with the proceedings.
