SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO ACTION REQUEST: NEW ZEALAND - REQUEST 
FOR DEMARCHE ON MINISTERIAL DELEGATIONS TO WASHINGTON 
INTERNATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY CONFERENCE (WIREC 2008) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 138428 
 
In response to reftel action request, Poloff contacted Eric 
Pyle, Director of Environmental and Social Development within 
the New Zealand Ministry Of Research, Development and 
Technology (MORST).  According to Pyle, the GNZ has not yet 
determined whether it will be sending a ministerial 
delegation to WIREC 2008.  The reason is that Prime Minister 
Helen Clark is in the process of implementing a cabinet 
reshuffle following the resignation of MORST Minister Steve 
Maharey, among other reasons.  Consequently, the GNZ cannot 
at this time select which ministers, if any, will attend 
WIREC 2008.  However, Pyle assured me that as soon as that 
decision is made, he will advise Post.  Post will keep OES 
advised as well.
