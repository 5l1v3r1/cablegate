SUBJECT: AT EU, SWEDEN PUSHES IRAQI REFUGEES OVER 
REPATRIATION 
 
¶1. (U) On June 24, the local media ran an op-ed piece by 
Migration Minister Tobias Billstrom calling on other EU 
countries to take in more Iraqi refugees.  That same day at 
the EU Ministerial meeting, the EU did not address the issue 
to take in more Iraqi refugees.  According to press reports, 
this was because Iraqi PM Maliki requested the EU not to take 
further initiatives that would counter Iraqi repatriation. 
 
¶2. (U) Billstrom's political specialist, Kristina Lindahl, 
told emboff that the op-ed was written and published based on 
a draft EU text, which changed somewhat at the Ministerial. 
She said Sweden supports the decision to organize a 
repatriation settlement program, but would have preferred 
additional wording urging EU members to take in Iraqi 
refugees.  A EU volunteer study trip to Iraq is being planned 
in conjunction with UNHCR prior to the start of the EU's 
repatriation program scheduled for 2009.  Sweden intends to 
participate. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment: It seems that Sweden underestimated its 
ability to influence other EU members to agree to accept more 
Iraqi refugees.  Sweden has taken in almost 60 percent of all 
Iraqi refugees to the EU and is feeling the heat domestically 
as its social welfare program is being overtaxed.  Sweden is 
a top EU destination country for asylum-seeking Iraqis, both 
legal refugees and illegal immigrants.  Sweden's generous 
policies allow asylum seekers to stay and receive government 
assistance while awaiting a decision--a process that often 
lasts more than two years.  Swedish authorities have had 
difficulty repatriating the 10-15 percent of Iraqis denied 
asylum for reasons including absconsion, lack of transit 
visas through Jordan, and domestic opposition over returning 
asylum-seekers to a "war-torn" country.
