(SBU) Following interventions with MFA and Ministry of 
Communications over the past several weeks, officials of both 
ministries informed ESTH Officer verbally and in writing on 
September 18 that Israel will support the candidacy of Steven 
Lett for Director of the International Mobile Satellite 
Organization during voting to be held in London September 
25-29.  Mr. Erez Gil, Economic Counselor of the Israeli 
Embassy in London, will represent the GOI at the IMSO 
Assembly.  The British Embassy had also demarched the GOI on 
behalf of the U.K. candidate.  Embassy appreciates guidance 
on procedural and substantive questions raised by the GOI 
provided by the candidate himself (Ref C).  In conveying 
support for Mr. Lett's candidacy, Communications official 
noted that developments at the IMSO, highlighted by Mr. Lett 
in his communications with post, were of great importance to 
the State of Israel.
