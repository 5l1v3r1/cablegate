¶1. (U) Summary: Building on his previous calls for closer 
transatlantic economic ties (reftel), Matthias Wissman, 
Chairperson of the Bundestag Committee on EU Issues, 
presented his latest ideas on further integrating the 
transatlantic economy at a press roundtable March 8. 
Wissmann told the press the U.S. and EU -- drawing from their 
common values -- could develop a model for free trade and 
closer regulatory cooperation that would demonstrate to the 
world the benefits gained from international commerce and 
provide momentum for on-going multilateral trade 
negotiations.  He emphasized his proposals -- and Chancellor 
Merkel's transatlantic economic initiative -- are not in 
competition with the Doha Round.  Germany's leadership as EU 
and G-8 president, Wissmann continued, puts it in excellent 
position to lay the foundation for a long-term strategy of 
closer transatlantic economic cooperation.  He said April's 
U.S.-EU Summit offers the opportunity to bring renewed focus 
to the economic pillar of the transatlantic relationship. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Wissmann, at a press roundtable, presented his latest 
paper on integrating the transatlantic economic region. 
Wissmann's paper, which echoed many of the ideas put forth by 
Chancellor Merkel, built off his previous efforts to 
encourage closer economic cooperation between the EU and 
North America.  Wissmann emphasized the need to focus on the 
areas which present the opportunity for the greatest benefits 
- namely lowering the regulatory barriers that currently 
exist between the U.S. and EU through greater cooperation. 
He said the U.S. and EU have an opportunity, through their 
cooperation, to draw from their common values and establish 
models for the global market in areas such as IPR and 
technical standards.  He also said it is important not to 
exclude countries that share these values; the door should be 
open for Canada to participate as well.  Wissmann referred to 
the European Single Market as a possible model for deeper 
transatlantic integration, noting the similar challenges the 
single market has faced in its integration.  He said Germany 
should utilize its leadership role in the EU and G-8, 
including during the upcoming U.S.-EU Summit, to revitalize 
existing regulatory cooperation and promote agreement on new 
areas for future cooperation. 
 
¶3. (U) In his report, Wissmann offered a time line for 
U.S.-EU regulatory cooperation: by 2010 the U.S. and EU 
should agree upon common legal standards in regulatory fields 
with existing mechanisms for collaboration; 2015 should be 
the goal for establishing a transatlantic "level playing 
field" in all major regulatory fields.  The goal of the April 
30 U.S.-EU Summit, according to Wissmann, should be a binding 
agreement on improved regulatory cooperation with funding for 
the regulatory bodies on both sides of the Atlantic to cover 
the costs of their activities.  In addition, the U.S. and the 
EU should agree on undertaking studies analyzing the 
cost-benefit ratio of regulatory cooperation by sectors. 
Wissmann acknowledged the different U.S. and EU regulatory 
systems have posed challenges to cooperation in the past, but 
his proposal aims at finding a common ground.

NTEP and Doha: Complementary not Competitive 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Wissmann explicitly stated that his proposal -- as 
well as the Chancellor's -- in no way is an alternative or is 
in competition with the on-going multilateral WTO trade 
talks.  He opined a U.S.-EU summit agreement for more 
integrated transatlantic economic relationship could provide 
momentum for moving Doha to a successful conclusion.  On a 
broader level, Wissmann said bringing the transatlantic 
economy closer also provides left-leaning European 
governments a way to support the larger transatlantic 
relationship with little risk of domestic political backlash.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Beginning last year with his short-lived proposal 
for creating a transatlantic free trade area (TAFTA) (reftel 
B), Wissmann has been one of the original supporters for 
Germany working to create a closer transatlantic economic 
relationship.  Despite the setback on his TAFTA proposal, his 
fundamental idea of strengthening the overall transatlantic 
relationship via the economic pillar has captured the 
Chancellor's interest and has given him a voice in the 
development of Merkel's transatlantic initiative within the 
Chancellery.  Not surprisingly, his redefined proposal 
calling for closer regulatory cooperation reflects many of 
the ideas found in Merkel's new transatlantic proposal. 
Wissmann also recognizes the need to maintain political 
momentum for this initiative to succeed and has actively 
engaged high-ranking German and EU officials on pursuing 
closer transatlantic economic cooperation.  End Comment.
