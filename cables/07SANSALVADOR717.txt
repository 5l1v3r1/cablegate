Emboff delivered reftel demarche on April 13 to Milton 
Magana, Head of Asian Affairs at the Salvadoran MFA.  Magana 
reported that while El Salvador remains steadfast in its 
support for Iraq's reconstruction via the presence of the 
Cuscatlan Battalion in Al Kut, the GOES was unlikely to 
participate at the Ministerial Level in next month's 
International Compact with Iraq (ICI) meeting in Egypt.  He 
said the MFA is following the ICI, and would be in touch with 
their Permanent Mission to the U.N. for more details.  Post 
will report any additional developments.
