SUBJECT: UNGA:  FIFTH COMMITTEE DISCUSSES FINANCING 
TRIBUNALS FOR RWANDA AND YUGOSLAVIA 
 
¶1.  Summary:  On December 15 the UN General Assembly (UNGA) 
Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) began 
discussions of financing the international criminal 
tribunals.  African and European representatives endorsed the 
Secretariat's calls for additional funding.  The French 
delegate (on behalf of the EU) expressed full support for the 
tribunals and complained that this discussion should have 
begun earlier.  The representative of Rwanda (on behalf of 
the African Group) welcomed the increasing number of 
countries supporting the tribunals.  All delegations agreed 
on the need to forestall staff losses, but U.S. and Chilean 
delegates disagreed on the proposal for a USD 5 million staff 
retention bonus.  The Cubans used the opportunity to push 
back on the UN Security Council (UNSC) in favor of UNGA.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.   Sharon Van Buerle, Director of Program Planning and the 
Budget Division, introduced the Financial Performance Reports 
for the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY) 
(A/63/558) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda 
(ICTR) (A/63/559) and the Revised Estimates for the tribunals 
(A/63/513 and A/63/506) and the Revised Estimates Arising in 
Respect to Security Council Resolution 1800 on the 
appointment of ad litem judges (A/62/809). Chairman Susan 
McLurg of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) introduced related reports.  The 
Rwandan and Chilean delegations expressed support for ACABQ 
recommendations.  The representative of France expressed 
disappointment of the late release of the ACABQ reports and 
reiterated that a fundamental duty of Member States is to 
provide timely financial support for the tribunals. 
 
¶3.  On staffing, the ACABQ urged more intensive efforts to 
retain the specialized tribunal personnel.  Most delegations 
emphasized the vital nature of preserving adequate staffing 
levels until the tribunals' mandates are fulfilled, keeping 
in mind the UNSC-endorsed completion strategy.  The 
divergence is in the mechanism to encourage staff members to 
stay.  All parties agreed that the Committee must take swift 
action to keep the tribunals functioning.  The tribunals will 
need more time for concluding trials, a now-impossible 
deadline originally agreed upon for this month. 
 
¶4.  The representative of Cuba complained that the UNSC has 
encroached upon UNGA's power of the purse by passing 
Resolution 1800, allowing the Secretary-General to appoint 
additional ad litem judges within existing resources.  Cuba 
argued that it was UNGA's role, and in particular the Fifth 
Committee, and not that of the UNSC to address budgetary 
matters. 
 
¶5.  USDel expressed support for the tribunals and noted 
American financial contributions, personnel assistance and 
information sharing.  We expressed serious reservations about 
some of the staff retention proposals, which would likely set 
negative precedents.  The EU concurs with USDel's position, 
and would like to see efforts to retain staff which are 
consistent with the common system.  The G77 and China, 
however, are more willing to provide a financial bonus to 
retain staff.  Full USDel remarks are available on Mission 
web site, www.usunnewyork.usmission.gov.
