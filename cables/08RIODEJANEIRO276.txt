SUBJECT: BRAZIL: AMBASSADOR SOBEL PROMOTES COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR U.S. FIRMS AT THE RIO OIL AND GAS EXPO 
 
¶1.  Summary.  On September 17, 2008, U.S. Ambassador to Brazil 
Clifford Sobel welcomed approximately 80 representatives from U.S. 
firms to a seminar at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo 2008 to discuss 
commercial opportunities in the energy sector.  The seminar, 
organized by the U.S. Commercial Service, featured presentations by 
Petrobras and Brazil's National Petroleum Agency (ANP).  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  The Rio Oil and Gas Expo, organized by the Brazilian Petroleum 
Institute (IBP) is one of the largest oil and gas industry events in 
the world.  The event, which takes place every two years in Rio de 
Janeiro, attracted over 35,000 people this year.  As part of his 
participation in the expo, U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Clifford Sobel 
hosted a seminar for approximately 80 participants entitled 
"Commercial Opportunities in Brazil for U.S. Firms." 
 
¶3.  The seminar featured speakers from the Brazilian oil company 
Petrobras on opportunities for U.S. equipment suppliers and service 
providers to do business with Petrobras.  In 2007, Petrobras spent 
USD 5.2 billion for equipment, chemicals, and parts; USD 23.6 
billion for seismic, drilling and transport services; and USD 11.0 
billion on platforms and refineries.  According to Petrobras 
Materials Manager Paulo Alonso, U.S. firms can play and important 
role in supplying critical upstream goods such as production 
pipeline alloy coatings, turbo compressors, mooring systems, 
drilling bits, special submarine valves, and steam generators. 
Alonso also identified critical E&P services such as drilling, 
workover, undersea interconnection, and support to ROVs which could 
be provided by U.S. firms. 
 
¶4.  Nelson Narciso, a Director at Brazil's National Petroleum Agency 
- ANP (the national oil regulator) briefed U.S. companies on the 
upcoming licensing auction for oil and gas rights and potential 
changes to Brazil's regulatory framework.  Brazil will respect 
existing contracts and maintain a transparent, stable regulatory 
regime, Narciso said.  With regards to roles for U.S. firms, he said 
that many American companies are already participating in Brazil's 
bid rounds but that more opportunities exist, especially on-shore. 
For goods and services, he noted Brazil's rules for local content 
requirement and advised that partnering with Brazilian firms would 
be a good strategy for American companies. 
 
¶5.  Following the seminar, the Ambassador walked the show floor, 
where he visited several U.S. exhibitors.  We requested information 
on how the four states represented in the U.S. Pavilion (OK, LA, PA 
and TX) could be helpful to the pending U.S. visit of Brazil's 
Minister of Energy Edilson Lobao to enhance his opportunities to 
learn to better access U.S. markets and suppliers. 
 
¶6.  Kallman Worldwide, a New Jersey firm, organized the U.S. 
Pavilion organizer and sponsored the commercial seminar.  Petrobras 
and ANP presentations from the seminar are posted online at the FCS 
Rio de Janeiro website.
