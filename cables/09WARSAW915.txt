¶1.  Summary.  Poland likely supports, or will abstain from voting, 
on suspended U.S. soybean shipments due to the EU zero tolerance for 
unapproved biotech varieties -- if the September 7 Ag Ministers 
Council meeting discusses the issue.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  August 28, Ag Counselor delivered reftel demarche to Ministry of 
Agriculture, Department for Animal and Feed Products, Director 
Wojciech Wojtyra.  Wojtyra commented that the Ministry had no 
position on the low level presence issue.  Wojtyra added that the 
Polish Grain and Feed Producers Association and others had written 
the Ministry asking for support to raise the zero tolerance limit to 
a workable level.  Wojtyra said that there had been no communication 
from the Commission or other member states to Poland about the 
issue. 
 
¶3.  September 4, Ag Counselor met with member companies' 
representatives of the Polish Grain and Feed Producers Association. 
Contacts reported that in their view the Ministry will either 
abstain or support the issue if raised.  Called for comment, MinAg 
declined to confirm how it might vote.
