¶1. (SBU) We presented proposed Consequence Management MOU 
text (ref a) to Bora Kerimoglu, Section Chief in the MFA Arms 
Control and Disarmament Department, on July 31.   Kerimoglu 
promised to review the text and bring it to the attention of 
Deputy Director General Ahmet Gun and other officials when 
they return from vacation.  We stressed the voluntary nature 
of the MOU, which would provide a practical vehicle for 
ensuring smooth cooperation before and during a catastrophic 
WMD event. 
 
¶2.  (U) We will follow up with DDG Gun and ascertain whether 
and when a visit from ISN/WMDT representatives would be 
useful.
