¶1.  (SBU) On March 8, Econoff met with Abdul Kareem 
Al-Mutawa, Regional Manager for South Asia at the Kuwait Fund 
for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) to discuss the recent 
Afghanistan Compact conference held in London.  (Note: 
Al-Mutawa attended as part of the GOK delegation headed by 
KFAED Director General Abdulwahab Al-Bader.  End note.) 
Al-Mutawa praised the organizers of the conference for its 
efficiency and substantive discussions, exclaiming that it 
was "one of the most successful conferences" he had attended. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Although the GOK did not make any new pledges at 
the conference, Al-Mutawa noted that KFAED officials and GOA 
ministers (Foreign Affairs and Finance) held productive side 
meetings to discuss Afghanistan's arrears, the possibility of 
renewed bilateral dialogue on priority reconstruction 
projects, and visits to Kuwait by senior GOA officials, 
including President Karzai, whose January visit was postponed 
following the death of Amir Shaykh Jaber Al-Sabah. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Al-Mutawa, KFAED has offered to extend 
the proposed repayment timeline of Afghanistan's arrears by 
granting the GOA a five-year repayment grace period in 
addition to the 20-year repayment timeline at 0% interest. 
(see ref C for an overview of GOK arrears with KFAED). 
Al-Mutawa explained that the KFAED offer was pending the 
review and approval of the GOA's Finance Ministry.  He 
expressed renewed hope in resolving the arrears in an effort 
to resume KFAED bilateral assistance to Afghanistan. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Al-Mutawa also pointed out that any decision to 
cancel the GOA's KFAED arrears would have to made by the 
Foreign Minister (chairman of KFAED) with the approval of the 
Council of Ministers (cabinet) and the Amir.  He added that 
President Karzai had called Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber 
Al-Sabah on March 7 to congratulate him on his appointment as 
Amir and the possibility of rescheduling Karzai's visit to 
Kuwait.
