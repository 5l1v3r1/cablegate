INCIDENTS WITH UN DPKO MIDDLE EAST CHIEF 
 
REF: BEIRUT 998 
 
(SBU)  POL officers met July 21 with Wolfgang Weisbrod-Weber, 
Asia and Middle East Division Director in the Office of 
Operations of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
(DPKO), and raised the issue of the suspicious incidents 
involving the Indian contingent of UNIFIL detailed in reftel. 
 Per reftel instruction, we orally provided him with a 
summary of the incidents and gave him a paper copy of the 
following message: "Prior to any appointment at the U.S. 
Embassy, UNIFIL members should send an e-mail to 
DSRSOBeirut@state.gov stating the time, date, and vehicle 
information."  Weisbrod-Weber expressed deep concern about 
the incidents and said he would follow up with UNIFIL.
