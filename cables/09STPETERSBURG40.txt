SUBJECT: ANTI-SEMITIC BOOK REMOVED FROM UNIVERSITY BOOKSHELVES 
 
(U)  The St. Petersburg University of the Russian Ministry of 
Internal Affairs - the training ground for future policemen - 
recently issued a controversial textbook "History of the 
Domestic Government and Rights" to students  as part of a 
history course.  The book is decidedly anti-Semitic in tone, 
blaming Jews for all of Russia's problems and accusing Gorbachev 
of having engineered the downfall of the Soviet Union as part of 
a Zionist plot.  The book seems to have initially had the 
backing of the university, as it was copyrighted by the 
university itself in conjunction with the author. Local media 
drew public attention to the issue.  On March 30 two university 
officials appeared on television and acknowledged that the book 
was outrageous and shameful.  The university subsequently 
removed all copies of the textbook from its library and bookshop 
on March 31.
