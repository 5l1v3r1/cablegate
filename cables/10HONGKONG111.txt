¶1.  To date, Hong Kong and Macau SAR governments have not

Relief Fund. 
 
¶2.  Several Hong Kong-based charities and NGOs have collected 
donations.  The Hong Kong Red Cross and World Vision Hong 
Kong have raised over HK$7.5 million (US$966,000) and HK$6 
million (US$773,000) respectively as of January 18.  As of 
January 19, the Macau Red Cross and Macau World Vision raised 
MOP 950,000 (US$114,000) and MOP350,000 (US$44,000) 
respectively.
