SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR TDY SCIENCE ADVISOR AT EMBASSY JAKARTA 
 
¶1. (U) Summary. Science and Technology (S&T) has emerged as a 
prominent and positive area of engagement with the government and 
people of Indonesia.  To support continued engagement, Embassy 
Jakarta requests assistance securing a TDY science advisor starting 
from January 2009. 
 
¶2. (U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶3. (U) Background.  Science and technology (S&T) has emerged as a 
prominent and positive area of engagement with the government and 
people of Indonesia.  Recognizing the benefit to the overall 
U.S.-Indonesia bilateral relationship, Post has identified S&T as a 
long-term priority.  Post has initiated a number of short-term 
scientific diplomacy efforts and is working to build upon this 
progress by developing a more comprehensive engagement strategy, 
starting with a proposed U.S.-Indonesia umbrella Science and 
Technology Agreement 
 
¶4. (U) ACTION REQUEST:  To help implement our science and technology 
engagement strategy, Post seeks assistance identifying an individual 
with a science background for a short term posting (90 days) from 
January 2009 as resident science advisor in Jakarta.  Post will 
provide housing and local transportation, but cannot provide travel 
to Post or M&IE.  The science advisor will work directly with the 
Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) and the Indonesian Academy 
of Sciences (AIPI) as well as other relevant government ministries 
to assist in long-term planning for U.S.-Indonesian engagement on 
science and technology.  Additionally, the advisor will track 
progress on the U.S.-Indonesia S&T Agreement and seek to identify 
opportunities for its application with Indonesian counterparts.  As 
time allows, the advisor may also assist on the the World Oceans 
Conference, the proposed Okeanos Explorer visit, and other ESTH 
activities.  Candidates are invited from all scientific disciplines 
and should be familiar with U.S. science and technology policy.  A 
SEC RET clearance is preferred but not required. 
 
¶5. Post POC for this request is Randall Beisecker 
(BeiseckerR@state.gov).
