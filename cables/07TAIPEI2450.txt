SUBJECT:  Taiwan Banks Hold US$2.4 Billion in Sub-prime and SIV 
Assets 
 
¶1.  Summary.  Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission disclosed 
that as of October 25, Taiwan banks held about US$2.4 billion in 
sub-prime related products and structured investment vehicles 
(SIVs).  This represents about 3% of the sector's portfolio assets. 
The FSC says banks can cover any potential losses.  End summary. 
 
Banks Disclose SIV and Sub-Prime Assets 
--------------------------------------- 
¶2.  Following an earlier request by Taiwan's Financial Supervisory 
Commission (FSC) for local banks to disclose their holdings of 
sub-prime-related assets in August 2007, the FSC ordered local banks 
to once again disclose holdings of sub-prime assets as well holdings 
in Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs).  According to the FSC, as 
of October 25, Taiwan bank holdings of these two asset classes 
totaled NT$78.1 billion (US$2.4 billion), including NT$21.8 billion 
(US$0.67 billion) in SIV products.  The value of sub-prime based 
assets was NT$56.3 billion (US$1.7 billion), up from NT$40.4 billion 
(US$1.24 billion) reported in early August.  The increase was mainly 
due to banks' new disclosures of assets already on the books, rather 
than from an increase in holdings. 
 
FSC Says Reserves Sufficient 
---------------------------- 
¶3.  FSC Vice Chairman Susan Chang told the press Taiwan banks 
holding these assets have set aside sufficient reserves to absorb 
likely losses.  The holdings of these two asset classes, at only 3% 
of the sector's total portfolio investment, are relatively small. 
According to FSC estimates, likely losses will be NT$7 billion 
(US$215 million), including NT$3 billion (US$92 million) in 
sub-prime based products and NT$4 billion (US$123 million)in SIVs.
