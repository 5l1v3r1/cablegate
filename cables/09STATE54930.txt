SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST: INVITING KOSOVO TO THE 
"CORRIDORS OF CULTURE" FORUM 
 
REF: PODGORICA 26 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This is an action request.  See para 5 for demarche 
points. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Department requests that addressee posts 
demarche their host governments at the highest appropriate 
level encouraging them to call on the Montenegrin government 
to invite the President of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, to attend 
&Corridors of Culture,8 a June 3-4 event organized by the 
Montenegrin government about regional cultural cooperation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Background:  Montenegro will host a cultural forum 
of regional presidents to be held in Cetinje on June 3-4. 
The forum is devoted to preserving cultural heritage in 
Southeastern Europe.  We understand that similar forums have 
been previously hosted by the presidents of Albania, 
Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Greece.  Per Ref, presidents of 
Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Serbia are confirmed 
as attending, while the presidents of Macedonia, Slovenia, 
and Turkey are very likely to attend, but their formal 
confirmations are pending.  Montenegro has not invited Kosovo 
to the event, despite recognizing it in October 2008. 
Montenegrin President Vujanovic, focused on rapprochement 
with Serbia, has insisted on not inviting Kosovo President 
Sejdiu to this particular event.  Posts may draw on below 
points in their approaches to host government. 
 
¶4.  (U) Points: 
-- Regional cooperation on cultural issues should be a common 
denominator that helps build greater cooperation and 
understanding throughout Southeastern Europe. 
 
-- In this regard, the U.S. regrets that Kosovo was not 
invited to participate in this forum.  In light of the very 
important responsibility Kosovo,s leadership has in 
preserving the invaluable cultural and religious heritage in 
Kosovo ) a responsibility to which the Kosovo government has 
shown strong commitment -- excluding Kosovo from this event 
does not serve the greater good of the region. 
 
-- Kosovo has a responsible role to play in regional 
politics, economics, cultural and sports exchanges.  With the 
exception of Serbia and Bosnia, all countries participating 
in this forum have recognized Kosovo.  It is also in Serbia 
and Bosnia,s interest to see the Kosovo government exercise 
its cultural preservation responsibilities, in cooperation 
with neighbors. 
-- The countries of the region must find a pragmatic approach 
that accepts the reality that Kosovo should be integrated 
into regional cooperation mechanisms on matters of 
overarching importance. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In the event the points are not delivered in time 
for an invitation to urge that an invitation be extended to 
Sejdiu, urge the host governments to express their regret for 
not seeing Kosovo,s president seated at the forum and to 
urge the next host to invite Kosovo.
