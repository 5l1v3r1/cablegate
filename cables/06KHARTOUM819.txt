SUBJECT:  UNMIS CONFIRMS HANDS-ON VERIFICATION OF SAF 
WITHDRAWAL FROM THE SOUTH 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In the wake of declarations by senior GoSS 
officials that the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have 
violated the CPA timetable for withdrawal of its forces 
from the South, CG met with a UNMIS officials to discuss 
how UNMIS is tracking SAF withdrawal.  They shared the 
following. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) UNMIS has established a system whereby the SAF, 
if it is to receive credit for troop withdrawals, must 
provide UNMIS a list of flights redeploying troops north. 
UNMIS logs this, and a UNMO team goes to the departure 
sight to verify that the number of troops listed embarks. 
This process is duplicated at the other end, to ensure 
that the forces have actually been withdrawn.  On March 
31, for example, flights carrying 348 SAF troops left 
Juba and arrived in Khartoum. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Based on this, UNMIS is confident that the SAF 
is adhering to the CPA withdrawal timetable.  UNMIS 
believes that approximately 32 percent of SAF forces have 
left, although it notes that the SAF did not agree to a 
troop census until January 9.  Some forces were withdrawn 
prior to that date, and the fact that UNMIS did not have 
total numbers until then does not permit UNMIS to declare 
with full certainty that the percentage is exactly right. 
UNMIS notes that the GoSS would like to see SAF 
withdrawal progress at a faster pace, but that, according 
to the CPA, SAF forces are not required to reach the 50 
percent drawdown level until June. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) CG cited claims from various quarters that the 
SAF is withdrawing on one hand, but recycling the same 
forces back into the South through clandestine nighttime 
flights and barge traffic on the Nile.  Aware of these 
accusations, UNMIS has stationed a permanent presence at 
various airfields and along the Nile.  One unscheduled 
flight arrived in Juba after sunset, but it was a case of 
mechanical problems, and the aircraft was not carrying 
troops.  UNMIS flight ops offered that landing troops in 
isolated bush airstrips at night would be dancing with 
death.  The airstrips are short, unlighted, and possess 
no homing beacons.  UNMIS has detected no river 
redeployments south up the White Nile. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) To date, the only verified violation of the 
withdrawal timetable has been ticketed to the SPLA in the 
East.  The failure of the North to expeditiously stand up 
the Joint Integrated Units (JIUs), and continued 
reluctance to do so, meant that the force charged with 
taking charge of the SPLA occupied areas in the East was 
non-existent.  The CPA does not provide for reoccupation 
of that area by the SAF. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  Until someone can provide something 
other than hearsay evidence that the SAF has found a way 
to bypass UNMIS measures, we remain unconvinced by 
accusations that the SAF remains fully in place, or is 
reinforcing in the South.  We note for the record that 
the SAF officers whom we have met have expressed delight 
that they are going home, some for the first time in 
years.  End comment.
