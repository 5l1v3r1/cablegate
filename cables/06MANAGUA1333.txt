SUBJECT: MANY NICARAGUAN EVANGELICALS WANT TO SUPPORT 
MONTEALEGRE, IF HE WILL REACH OUT TO THEM 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Many leaders of the evangelical community in 
Nicaragua prefer ALN presidential candidate Eduardo 
Montealegre as the best option to lead Nicaragua after the 
November elections.  Most feel, however, that Montealegre has 
not done enough to promote evangelical candidates and 
politicians within the ALN -- especially current National 
Assembly Delia Arellano, who was allotted a "losing" position 
on the ALN's list for national deputies.  The evangelicals 
stated that Camino Cristiano leader Guillermo Osorno has lost 
respect and influence within the evangelical community 
because of his alliance with the PLC, and FSLN vice 
presidential candidate Jaime Morales Carazo has cost that 
party considerable evangelical support due to his outspoken 
support of prejudicial laws in the National Assembly.  One 
leader complained that the Bolanos administration favors 
Catholic clergy over evangelicals.  Despite their formal 
non-partisan affiliation at the institutional level, 
evangelical leaders are clearly anti-Sandinista and ready to 
encourage their followers to support a democratic candidate. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador and poloffs conducted a series of recent 
meetings with different evangelical groups to discuss the 
upcoming national elections.  Most of the pastors expressed a 
preference for ALN presidential candidate Eduardo 
Montealegre, but commented that they would be more motivated 
in their efforts to support him if he would promote more 
evangelical candidates within the ALN.  The evangelical 
leaders claimed that 30-40 percent of Nicaraguans now 
identify themselves as evangelical.  A brief demographic 
summary of each evangelical organization follows: 
 
- EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE: The Evangelical Alliance has over 80 
member institutions from most evangelical denominations.  The 
directors of the Alliance claim that its member organizations 
represent 70-80 percent of all evangelicals in Nicaragua. 
 
- NICARAGUAN PASTORS' ASSOCIATION (APANIC): APANIC is a 10 
year-old organization that has over 70 active evangelical 
pastors from various denominations in its membership.  APANIC 
is based in Managua, where it draws most of its membership, 
but includes pastors from throughout Nicaragua. 
 
- NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EVANGELICAL PASTORS: The Council is an 
umbrella organization that includes more than 400 pastors 
representing all evangelical denominations in Nicaragua. 
Council members are present in 122 of Nicaragua's 152 
municipalities. 
 
MANY EVANGELICAL LEADERS PREFER EDUARDO, BUT...

¶3. (C) All of the groups expressed some degree of support for 
Eduardo Montealegre as the most appropriate candidate for the 
presidency.  APANIC leader Jairo Hernandez commented that 
APANIC will publicly declare its support for Montealegre's 
candidacy and is discussing with his campaign managers the 
best timing for the pronouncement.  Evangelical Alliance 
leaders initially seemed tepid in their support for 
Montealegre during a June 8 meeting with Emboffs, but came 
out more strongly in favor in a meeting with the Ambassador 
on June 12.  Alliance leader Leonel Ubeda noted that they had 
ongoing contact with Montealegre through evangelical members 
of the ALN, particularly National Assembly deputy Delia 
Arellano.  In contrast, President of the National Council of 
Evangelical Pastors Mario Espinoza stated that Montealegre 
does not maintain close ties with evangelical churches and 
that evangelicals in general have not yet defined a 
presidential candidate that they favor. 
 
¶4. (C) Ubeda expressed concern that evangelicals, including 
Arellano, are not more strongly represented in winning 
positions on the ALN's deputy lists.  (Note: Arellano is 
currently in the ninth position on the ALN's national deputy 
list, a long-shot position at best.  End Note.)  APANIC 
leaders Hernandez and Jaime Sierra commented that they would 
like to see Arellano moved into the fourth or fifth position 
and to see more evangelicals in general in positions of 
influence within the ALN.  Sierra generally complained about 
the ALN deputy lists, saying they should reflect the outcome 
of the ALN primaries and not horse trading with the allied 
parties and the Bolanos Administration. 
 
OSORNO HAS LOST INFLUENCE IN EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY

¶5. (C) The evangelical leaders agreed that Camino Cristiano 
head and current PLC deputy candidate Reverend Guillermo 
Osorno has lost much of his influence in the evangelical 
community for "selling out" to the corrupt PLC.  Alliance 
leader Danilo Ortiz noted that Osorno is president of one of 
the Alliance's member organizations (the Assembly of God) and 
respected as such, but "the group is disappointed with his 
decision" to join the PLC.  Sierra stated that Osorno "chose 
the wrong path" and can no longer claim to represent any 
evangelicals outside of his own denomination.  (Note: 
Osorno, previously a vociferous opponent of the FSLN-PLC 
pact, recently told the press that the pact allowed the 
National Assembly to function efficiently.  End Note.) 
 
MORALES CARAZO HURTING FSLN WITH EVANGELICALS

¶6. (C) FSLN vice presidential candidate and current National 
Assembly deputy Jaime Morales Carazo was subjected to even 
stronger censure from the evangelical leaders for his 
promotion of "noise pollution" laws in the Assembly that 
would have shut down evening services for many evangelical 
denominations.  The Alliance leaders laughed when poloff 
mentioned that Morales renounced his previous position as 
"wrong" after receiving the FSLN nomination.  Sierra and 
Hernandez both agreed that Morales is "completely rejected" 
by the evangelical community. 
 
BOLANOS FAVORS CATHOLICS

¶7. (C) Mario Espinoza complained that the Bolanos 
administration has "remained distant" from evangelicals, 
despite strong evangelical support in the last election.  He 
claimed that Catholic clergy are given open access at 
airports to enter the country, whereas evangelicals are 
subject to luggage searches and other formalities.  He also 
referred to subsidies that the state allegedly provides to 
Catholic cultural and other facilities and wants evangelicals 
to have the same access and clout that he claims the Catholic 
clergy currently enjoys. 
 
COMMENT: EDUARDO SHOULD COURT EVANGELICALS

¶8. (C) The evangelical leaders emphasized the fact that they 
have considerable and growing influence throughout Nicaragua, 
especially in poor, remote areas -- places where the 
traditional parties retain their strength.  For that reason, 
poloffs advised Montealegre's close advisors take into 
account the evangelicals' concerns, specifically by offering 
Arellano a better deal, not only because she has influence in 
the evangelical community, but because she is one of the few 
deputies who actually works for the people of Nicaragua in 
the Assembly.  Working against Delia Arellano is the fact 
that her joining Montealegre was a personal, not a party 
decision, and thus she does not enjoy the backing of a 
political entity to lobby for a more favorable position on 
the National Assembly candidate list.
