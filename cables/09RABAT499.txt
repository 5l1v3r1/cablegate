The USG can "cont on Morocco's support" for UN International 
Ciil Service Commission candidate Lucretia Myers, Minstry 
of Foreign Affairs Head of International Oranization Affairs 
Rime Jirari told Econoff on Jue 12 in response to reftel 
demarche.  The Governents of Greece, Italy, and Germany have 
also requested support for their candidates, she revealed, 
but Morocco would certainly back the U.S. candidate.  Morocco 
will likely send one note in September confirming its 
position on all candidates for international organizations to 
be selected in connection with the UN General Assembly, 
Jirari predicted.
