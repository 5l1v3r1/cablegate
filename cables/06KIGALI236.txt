¶1. On 9 March Ambassador met with Foreign Minister Murigande 
in response to a request by the Minister to discuss the 
return of the US Peace Corps to Rwanda. Minister Murigande 
explained that he had met with a Peace Corps delegation led 
by Mr. Henry McCoy in 2004 and he asked if there was any 
progress made in getting the Peace Corps to return to Rwanda. 
 
¶2. Ambassador Arietti recounted his actions in Washington in 
2005 to encourage a Peace Corps return to Rwanda, including 
meetings and briefings at Peace Corps Headquarters. He said 
that it was likely that the first efforts by the Peace Corps 
in Rwanda would be in the education or health sectors but 
noted that funding limitations would be the biggest 
constraint to a near term deployment. Ambassador Arietti 
assured FM Murigande that he would continue to work with 
Peace Corps Headquarters and the Department on a Peace Corps 
return to Rwanda.
