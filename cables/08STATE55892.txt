¶1. (SBU) The Department appreciates Post's inquiry as to 
how best to encourage the Estonian MFA to increase its 
engagement in the Middle East, in particular in Lebanon and 
Syria.  Estonia's prior work in 
Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova and Kosovo provides it 
with excellent credentials to promote democracy and market 
reform. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Past engagement with Syria by European 
Foreign Ministers has been unproductive.  If any engagement 
must take place, the Department strongly prefers that 
European Union High Representative Javier Solana be the 
sole point of contact for the European Union with Syria. 
Interlocutors are encouraged to desist from senior-level 
travel to Syria unless there are direct humanitarian reasons 
compelling such travel, and are also encouraged not to invite 
Syrian officials to travel to their home countries. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) With respect to Lebanon, we encourage host 
governments to provide tangible political, economic, and 
security 
support to the democratically-elected Government or its March 
14 
majority coalition in Lebanon and to ratchet up pressure 
against 
the Syrian regime and its proxies.  Host governments should 
support 
the United Nations Special Tribunal for Lebanon and 
condemn political violence.  The Special Tribunal will 
help bring to justice those responsible for the February 
14, 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. 
 
Economic assistance can be offered in the 
form of grants and support to the Lebanese Armed Forces 
(LAF) or Internal Security Forces (ISF). 
 
¶3.  (U) For additional guidance, please contact NEA/ELA 
Matthew Irwin at 202-647-1058 or IrwinMT@state.sgov.gov.
