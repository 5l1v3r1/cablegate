CHAIRMAN 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Welcoming Speaker of the U.S. House of 
Representatives Nancy Pelosi and a delegation of five additional 
House members on May 24, Shanghai Municipal People's Congress 
(MPC) Standing Committee Chairman Liu Yungeng characterized the 
Speaker's visit to Shanghai as good both for China and for the 
municipality.  Liu acknowledged the global financial crisis had 
slowed Shanghai's growth but believed Central Government 
economic stimulus policies and popular expectations for the 2010 
World Exposition are helping to reenergize the local economy. 
He acknowledged rapid growth has led to challenges for the 
municipal leadership, particularly in dealing with citizens' 
discontent over relocation as a result of urban redevelopment. 
The Speaker thanked Liu and his colleagues for their efforts on 
the delegation's behalf and indicated she would work with 
Secretary of State Clinton on U.S. representation at the 2010 
Expo.  End summary. 
 
 
 
U.S.-China Relations "Positive, Cooperative, Comprehensive" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Following introductions of the Chinese attendees at 
the May 24 meeting with Speaker Pelosi, Shanghai Municipal 
People's Congress Standing Committee Chairman Liu Yungeng 
welcomed the Speaker's delegation and observed relations between 
the United States and China have been developing "steadily and 
progressively" since President Obama took office in January. 
President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, he noted, had 
reached a consensus at the London G20 meeting in April on 
establishing a "positive, cooperative, and comprehensive" 
relationship between the two countries.  Liu praised the 1999 
establishment of the parliamentary exchange between China's 
National People's Congress Standing Committee and the U.S. House 
of Representatives as another bridge for friendly interaction 
between U.S. and Chinese legislators. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Liu stressed that the delegations decision to make 
Shanghai their initial stop on their visit to China was good not 
only for China but particularly for Shanghai in its own effort 
to build ties with other countries and regions.  Shanghai, Liu 
noted, has sister-city relations with San Francisco and Chicago. 
 He hoped the Speaker and other members of the delegation would 
leave Shanghai with a better understanding of the city and 
invited them to be candid in any suggestions they might have on 
how to improve it. 
 
 
 
Effects of Financial Crisis Appear to Be Easing 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Reviewing Shanghai's development, Liu observed the 
municipality had enjoyed double-digit economic growth both in 
gross domestic product and in citizens' incomes for many years. 
The global financial crisis had caused growth to slow in 2008 to 
9.7 percent, but central government policies to boost domestic 
demand have started to create a "warming" of the local economy. 
In particular, policies aimed at aiding enterprises had led to a 
pick-up both in the stock market and in the housing market 
during the first four months of 2009.  Strong growth in retail 
sales during the January-April period shows the ability and 
willingness of Shanghai residents to consume more.  Moreover, 
the Central Government has reiterated its support for Shanghai 
to develop its service and advanced manufacturing sectors and to 
act as China's leading financial and shipping center. 
Expectations for the Shanghai 2010 World Exposition (Expo) have 
also strengthened the confidence of Shanghai residents in the 
municipality's future, Liu stressed.  According to Liu, 238 
 
SHANGHAI 00000229  002 OF 004 
 
 
countries and regions have confirmed their participation in the 
Expo, of which over 40 had agreed to build pavilions.  This 
effort will give a strong boost to the Shanghai economy. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Nevertheless, Liu acknowledged Shanghai's development 
has its challenges as well, notably the ubiquitous construction 
sites that create substantial inconvenience to its citizens.  In 
addition, Shanghai has had to relocate about one million 
households in order to improve living standards.  He admitted 
not all citizens have welcomed relocation.  If even just one 
member of each household opposes relocation, that means one 
million unhappy people, Liu observed. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Liu briefly described the organization and functions 
of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress.  Using energy 
issues as an example, he indicated the congress has increasingly 
passed more detailed local legislation in contrast to the very 
general statutes of earlier years in order to strengthen 
regulation.  The congress is also focusing on improving the 
administrative regulations of the municipal government. 
 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  In response to question from Representative Markey on 
energy efficiency standards in Shanghai, Liu noted he had 
personally made inspection tours of building sites to observe 
the installation of energy saving measures.  For example, new 
government buildings and factories are required to install 
energy-efficient lighting and automatic switches to reduce power 
consumption.  In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government is 
providing subsidies to car owners that encourage them to switch 
to more fuel-efficient vehicles, Liu stated.  Shanghai also has 
a number of solar power and wind power facilities, and the 
municipality's Tongji University has been pioneering several new 
energy-saving technologies that have yet to be commercialized. 
Liu indicated that, according to a municipal government report, 
Shanghai's coal consumption per RMB 10,000 of GDP has fallen 
over 11 percent over the past three years. 
 
 
 
Speaker:  Important to See China First-hand; Support for U.S. 
Presence at 2010 Expo 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Speaker Pelosi recounted her meeting earlier in the 
date with Catholic Bishop Jin Luxian (septel), who had noted 
how, despite the improvements in communication in the modern 
world, there is still no substitute for seeing something in 
person.  She thanked Liu for the compliment he and the other 
Chinese participants had given to the U.S. delegation in the 
time and effort they had contributed to allowing the members to 
experience China first hand.  She indicated the main purpose of 
the delegation was to discuss energy and climate change, a 
pillar of President Obama's policy agenda, with their Chinese 
counterparts. 
 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  The Speaker added that she could not imagine the 
Shanghai 2010 Expo without a U.S. national pavilion and 
indicated she would work with Secretary of State Clinton on U.S. 
representation at the Shanghai Expo.
