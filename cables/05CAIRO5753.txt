¶1.  Summary:  Egyptian state-run TV ran President Bush's 
July 25 signing of the condolence book at the Egyptian 
Embassy as the top news item, while local press made it the 
main front-page story with a photo on July 26.  Egyptian 
press and TV also prominently carried Secretary Rice's July 
26 signing of the condolence book and her remarks 
expressing solidarity and support for Egypt.  The 
Information Minister and PA media contacts praised the 
President and Secretary's gestures, which they said would 
have a powerful impact and underline American-Egyptian 
friendship in a time of crisis.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  The Egyptian media gave extensive coverage to the July 
25 visit of President Bush to the Egyptian Embassy in 
Washington, during which he signed a condolence book in the 
presence of the First Lady and Egyptian Ambassador to the 
U.S. Nabil Fahmy.  The front-page of leading pro-government 
newspaper Al-Ahram printed a large photo of the President 
signing the condolence book, flanked by the First Lady and 
Ambassador Fahmy.  A smaller front-page photo ran on pro- 
government Al-Akhbar.  The same image was replayed to 
voiced-over coverage on Egyptian TV of the President's 
visit throughout July 25, 26, and 27.  Secretary Rice's 
signing of the same condolence book on July 26 was also 
given top-of-the-TV news coverage and prominent mention in 
the pro-government press.  FM Aboul Gheit was quoted in all 
newspapers on July 27 as saying the visits were "big 
support for Egypt in its war against terrorism."  (Note: 
This coverage was in addition to reporting on U.S. and 
Embassy statements and condemnation and condolences 
previously in the week (reftel).  End note.) 
 
¶3.  In a conversation with the Charge, Information 
Minister Anas El-Fekki praised the President's signing 
of the condolence book as an excellent signal to the 
Egyptian people.  One PA contact, echoing the remarks of 
several others, commented that the President's visit to 
the Egyptian Embassy was "a positive public diplomacy 
move."  The contacts noted that having the First Lady 
visit the Egyptian Embassy along with the President 
enhanced the positive image the visit sent to Egyptians. 
PA contacts also praised the U.S. for immediately 
condemning the attacks and, especially, the President 
and Secretary for their July 23 statements that the U.S. 
would stand with Egypt.  The new Editor-in-chief of 
weekly magazine Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, Mohamed Abdel Atti, 
suggested on July 26 that the visits to the Egyptian 
Embassy would help to smooth over "recently tense 
relations" between Egypt and the U.S.
