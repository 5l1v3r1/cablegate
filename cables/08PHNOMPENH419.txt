¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Ec chief May 23 delivered demarche (Ref A) to 
Kan Pharidh, Director General of the ASEAN Department at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, on 
the Royal Ploughing Day holiday.  Kan Pharidh understood the 
significance of our points, took on board the distinction 
between recovery and reconstruction, and said he would brief 
Foreign Minister Hor Namhong and Secretary of State Kao Kim 
Hourn on the U.S. position before they departed for the Burma 
conference. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Kan Pharidh noted our earlier demarche to Prince 
Sisowath (Ref B), and understood the additional points about 
the need to move to a full-scale, independent needs 
assessment.  Kan Pharidh emphasized Cambodia's support for 
the ASEAN mechanism and the newly established Task Force to 
be led by ASEAN Secretary General Dr. Surin Pitsuwan.  He 
expressed the hope that the UN-ASEAN conference would get 
results so that every nation wishing to provide aid could 
have "deliverable ouputs."  He noted there would be an ASEAN 
Task Force meeting back-to-back with the UN-ASEAN donors 
meeting, adding that ASEAN was providing its own technical 
experts to the process. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In addition to the USD $50,000 cash donation from 
the government and USD $10,000 from the Cambodian Red Cross, 
Kan Pharidh said that the Royal Cambodian Government was 
considering sending food (rice and dried fish) as well as 
cloth as further disaster assistance to the Burmese people in 
the wake of Cyclone Nargis.
