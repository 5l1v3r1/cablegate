SPECIAL SESSION 
 
REF: STATE 188244 
 
(U)   During a previously scheduled November 17 meeting with 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, Ambassador Aguirre 
expressed USG concern with the tone and substance of the 10th 
Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly and its 
consideration of a resolution on the unfortunate incident in 
Beit Hanun.  Moratinos replied that he had not been briefed 
on the subject, but said he suspected the French and by 
extension the EU might be difficult on the matter.  However, 
he promised to read the text and said that Spain would see if 
it could work to soften the text of the resolution. 
Ambassador urged Spain to vote against the resolution or, at 
a minumum, to abstain.
