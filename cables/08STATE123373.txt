ON APPLICATION 050131468 
 
REF: A. 01 MADRID 461 
     ¶B. IIR 4 235 2964 08 OF 04 AUGUST 2008 
     ¶C. BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050131468 for the export 
of C-130 aircraft parts to Spain.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future applications involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  concerns about foreign consignee GECI 
Espanola S.A., which was the subject of an unfavorable Blue 
Lantern in 2001 (ref A).  Ref B raises additional relevant 
concerns.  Post should make appropriate inquiries to verify 
the bona fides of GECI Espanoa S.A. and confirm the 
legitimacy of the proposed transaction.  The following 
questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
For the Spanish MOD: 
 
--Are you familiar with GECI Espanoa S.A.? 
 
--Did you order from GECI Espanoa S.A. the exact type and 
quantity of items listed on this application? 
 
--Is GECI Espanoa S.A. an official supplier/contractor for 
the Spanish MOD?  Does the Spanish MOD have any other 
contracts with the company? 
 
For GECI Espanoa S.A.: 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including purchase orders from the Spanish MOD, for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--What is the company's role in this transaction?  Will it 
provide any defense services such as repair or maintenance? 
 
--Will the company handle or store the items listed on the 
application?  If so, does it have secure facilities and 
proper accounting and security procedures for handling these 
sensitive USML items?  How many parts will it store and for 
how long? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what types of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located?  Does the company export 
any items?  If so, what items, and to what destinations? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
¶4. If possible given time and resource constraints, 
Department requests that post ask Consular Agency Seville to 
conduct a site visit to the company in order to provide 
Department with an assessment of its business operations and 
on-site security.  If a site visit is not possible, please 
inform PM/DTCC case officer.  Finally, post is asked to 
assess whether the company appears to be a reliable recipient 
of USML items.  End action.

question are provided:
