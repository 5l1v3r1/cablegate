Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam lead with and Al-Quds front pages 
news of U.S. Special Envoy Mitchell's June 10 meetings with 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad. 
Abbas urged the U.S. to pressure Israel to accept the two-state 
solution and force a complete halt to all settlement activities in 
order to pave the way for peace talks and an independent Palestinian 
state.  Also according to coverage, President Abbas stressed "those 
who are seriously engaged in pushing the two-state solution, must 
also seriously impose measures on Israel to halt settlement 
activities including so-called, natural growth."  Papers report 
extensively on Mitchell's Ramallah press statement noting that he 
reiterated U.S. support for a Palestinian state and underscored that 
the U.S. is working hard towards meeting that goal.  Mitchell's call 
on all to help create an environment conducive to peace talks, is 
also highlighted.  PLO Chief negotiator Erekat told press that 
Palestinians are ready to open talks with Israel if Israel meets its 
Roadmap obligations. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs separate front page coverage, citing Israeli sources, 
on President Obama's vision for a solution to the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict by 2012 through the creation of an 
independent Palestinian state.  U.S. officials are also quoted 
noting that the U.S. cannot impose a solution on the two parties. 
Meanwhile, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam run front page wire 
reports about Israeli Defense Minister Barak urging Israeli Prime 
Minister Netanyahu to accept the two-state solution and all 
agreements by the previous government. 
 
Al-Quds leads with news of 20 demolition orders being served by the 
Jerusalem Municipality to residents of Palestinian homes in the East 
Jerusalem Al-Bustan neighborhood on June 10, citing lack of building 
permits.  Palestinian Authority Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Abdil 
Qader noted that the orders are meant to convey a message to the 
U.S. and Envoy Mitchell that Israel is serious about continuing 
settlement activities despite U.S opposition. 
 
Al-Quds' front page runs an exclusive interview with Hamas leader 
Misha'al on June 10, in which he called on the Palestinian Authority 
to stop its security operations against Hamas militants in the West 
Bank.  Such a halt would allow for the creation of a positive 
environment for Palestinian reconciliation and national unity talks. 
 
 
Al-Quds runs front page coverage citing DPA about President Obama 
telephoning King Abdullah of Jordan on June 10 to discuss regional 
efforts for re-launching "serious and direct" peace talks to end the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  According to coverage, the leaders 
discussed a solution based on the two-state solution and a regional 
peace settlement for the Middle East. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front page and Al-Quds runs an 
inside page report on the U.S. $55 million contribution to UNRWA 
announced on June 10 during the semiannual UNRWA Consultative 
Committee meeting in Amman. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs inside coverage on a discussion held in 
Ramallah by the U.S. Consulate General, Jerusalem and 25 members of 
the Palestinian Sharek Youth Forum.  The group discussed President 
Obama's June 4 speech, offering praise but also skepticism that, 
"words will be translated into actions."

All dailies front page news on the Palestinian Authority Minister of 
Health announcing on June 10 that the first case of "swine flu" has 
been reported in the Palestinian Territories - a four-year old boy 
from Bethlehem who returned from the U.S.  The Minister noted that 
the case had been contained and there is no need for panic.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Sa'ed Abdul Rahman opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title, "How should we react to Obama?"(06/11): "Obama has so far 
proven that he is credible and honest in making good on pledges he 
made during his election campaign.  He has taken bold decisions 
regarding Iraq, dialogue with Syria and Iran and he keeps focusing 
on a better America and better future through peaceful means.  We 
have even started to see a U.S. position that is not biased towards 
Israel... However, in order for Palestinians to benefit from the 
Obama era, we must end internal Palestinian division and enable him 
to implement his vision of ending the conflict." 
 
2) Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title, 
"A chance for political investment" (06/11): "President Obama is 
proposing a complete halt to settlement activities and the immediate 
launch of peace talks... however, at the same time, he is supporting 
the Israeli demand that Arabs recognize Israel as a Jewish state... 
Israel does not want to take advantage of the opportunity the U.S. 
is proposing [for peace]... On the contrary, Israel is proposing to 
punish the U.S. for its policies, which will only complicate things 
later on."
