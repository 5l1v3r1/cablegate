SUBJECT: KENYA AGREES TO POSTPONE IGAD SUMMIT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 18712 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: We discussed the points in reftel with 
senior Government of Kenya officials.  They are postponing 
the IGAD summit to mid-March or later and agreed to discuss 
with their IGAD partners our strong suggestion that the Sudan 
CPA should have its own summit.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) We received a diplomatic note on 15 February 
pertaining to this issue.  The operative portion reads: 
"...an Extraordinary Summit of the Inter-Governmental 
Authority on Development will be held in Nairobi on Tuesday 
20th of February 2007 at 10:00 a.m. preceded by an 
Extra-Ordinary Meeting of the Council of Ministers on Monday 
19th February 2007 at 3:00 p.m.  The agenda of the meeting 
will be to review the implementation of the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement on Sudan and discuss the road map for the 
post conflict peace-building and reconstruction, as well as 
deployment of AU/IGAD protection force for Somalia.  The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kenya has the 
honor to invite you to attend the meeting as an observer." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Subsequent to the issuance today of this diplomatic 
note (but prior to its receipt by us), we discussed points 
contained in reftel with senior Government of Kenya 
officials.  They are postponing the summit until at least 
mid-March.  They agreed to discuss with their IGAD partners 
our strong suggestion that the issue of implementation of the 
Sudan CPA should have its own summit.  They appreciated the 
symbolic value of Navaisha as a location for the summit and 
agreed to consider that option.  They intend to convene an 
IGAD committee of experts prior to the ministerial meeting 
and the Head of State summit.  Our Kenyan interlocutors were 
quite pleased to hear that the USG is prepared to send a high 
level delegation to participate in the summit.
