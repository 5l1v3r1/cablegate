¶1.  (U) Summary.  Charge and A/Polcouns met on August 25 with 
Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (MFA) 
Secretary General Youssef Amrani.  Ambassador Amrani 
requested the meeting to discuss preparations for the 
upcoming Forum for the Future, to held in Marrakech November 
1-3.  Charge used the opportunity to press Mr. Amrani on 
outstanding property issues and on concerns related to taxes 
and customs duties being applied to USAID contractors in 
Morocco.  End summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Forum for the Future 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Amrani began by noting the need to speed up 
preparations for the Forum for the Future and for the need to 
identify "deliverables" that would be presented at the Forum. 
 He stated that invitations had been prepared and were ready 
for signature, and added that Moroccan and Italian embassies 
in invitee countries had already been informed and had begun 
reaching out to their respective host governments.  The MFA 
plans to establish a Forum website and to convene at an 
as-yet unspecified date a meeting in Rabat G-8 and BMENA 
Chiefs of Mission in Morocco.  The MFA is considering two 
sites in Marrakech to house the Forum, but has not yet made a 
final decision. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Concerned about the substance of Forum activities, 
Amrani mentioned the three preparatory workshops, including 
the Rabat sub-ministerial, and the importance of 
government/civil society partnership.  The Charge suggested 
that women's issues could be a focus, and that Morocco was 
already a leader in this regard.  Amrani expressed the need 
for feedback from Forum partners, to which the Charge replied 
that the USG was planning a coordination meeting this week, 
after which feedback should be forthcoming.  Amrani expressed 
the need for a "new impulse" for the Forum, especially in 
Arab countries, and he commented that this is an important 
opportunity for Morocco, the United States, and for the 
region as a whole. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Amrani inquired about the possibility of meeting 
with Deputy Secretary Steinberg, with whom he met at the 
Community of Democracies Ministerial in Lisbon, when Mr. 
Steinberg travels to New York for the UNGA.

Property

¶5.  (SBU) Taking advantage of the opportunity to address 
other issues with Amrani, the Charge noted that the Mission 
was still waiting for a reply to a request for confirmation 
of approval to build the NEC in Rabat.  Land was purchased in 
1988, but the Mission has sought confirmation so that 
detailed planning could begin.  Amrani promised to look into 
it and expedite a reply. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Charge also noted that the Mission has identified 
two parcels of land in Casablanca that would be appropriate 
to serve as the site of a new Consulate General, but that 
approval to purchase either one might require the consent of 
Moroccan King Mohammed VI.  Amrani agreed to forward to the 
Palace a letter describing the properties and the desire to 
purchase one of them. 
 
-------- 
Taxation 
-------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Finally, Charge raised as well the outstanding 
concern that the Ministry of Finance had attempted to apply 
duties and taxes on USAID contractors )- in violation of the 
1957 cooperation agreement.  Amrani asserted that the issue 
should be resolved.  He called a representative of the MFA 
Legal Office, who confirmed that the Customs Agency had been 
informed that USAID should be permitted duty-free import, but 
had not responded.  The Legal Assistant noted, however, that 
the MFA considered the 1957 agreement as remaining in force. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) While the pace of much activity in Morocco has 
slowed due to Ramadan, Amrani clearly remains engaged and 
interested in advancing these issues, and post will continue 
at every opportunity to press for their successful 
resolution.  Amrani recognizes the significance of the Forum 
for the Future and evinces firm commitment to ensuring that 
it is an unqualified success.  The Mission looks forward to 
additional information about Forum planning, and to working 
with Morocco to bring this important undertaking to rich 
fruition.  End Comment.
