SUBJECT: UK FULLY SUPPORTS USG ON POSSIBLE CLOSURE OF 
AMERICAN SCHOOL IN TUNIS 
 
REF: STATE 33548 
 
(SBU) The UK shares the USG's concerns about the closure of 
the American Cooperative School in Tunis, FCO Tunisia Desk 
Officer Robert Brooks told us April 7 in response to reftel. 
Noting that the British Ambassador to Tunisia has already 
been in touch with Ambassador Godec on this issue, Brooks 
said HMG will support and participate in all efforts to keep 
the school open.  The UK is particularly concerned that 
closure of the school would send the wrong message to the 
international business community about Tunisia's willingness 
to abide by legal contracts and obligations, Brooks said.
