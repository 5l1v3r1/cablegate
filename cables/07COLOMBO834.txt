¶1. (SBU) Summary: Sri Lanka has not yet taken steps to 
implement UN Security Council Resolution 1747, but says it 
will do so soon.  Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Bogollagama 
visited Iran May 25-28.  With that visit past, Sri Lanka is 
likely to take steps to implement UNSCR 1747 in the near 
future.   End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DCM and EconOff met with Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Additional Secretary for Multilateral Affairs T B 
Maduwegedera June 12 to follow up on Sri Lanka's progress in 
implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1747 and to 
deliver the United States' report on its implementation of 
the resolution (ref A).  Maduwegedera said that the MFA had 
not yet issued instructions to government agencies on 
implementing UNSCR 1747 because it had not yet received from 
its mission in New York the annex listing sanctioned 
entities.  We gave Maduwegedara a copy of the annex, as we 
had done when we initially delivered this demarche in March 
(ref B). 
 
¶3. (SBU) EconOff also spoke on June 12 with of Sri Lanka 
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) Director H.A. Karunaratne 
about the status of the correspondent banking link between 
the Bank of Ceylon and Iranian Bank Sepah.  Karunaratne said 
that the FIU had not yet acted to sever the Bank of 
Ceylon-Bank Sepah link because it had still not received 
instructions from the MFA on UNSCR 1747.  He also said that 
the May 15 Asian Clearing Union board meeting had not 
discussed the issue of its members ties with Bank Sepah, 
contrary to the GSL's intention to raise the issue in that 
forum (ref C).  Karunaratne reported that the FIU had found 
"a few inactive accounts" linked to Bank Sepah, maintained by 
various Sri Lankan banks, and that it would address these as 
well as the Bank of Ceylon correspondent link when advised to 
do so by the MFA. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Bogollagama 
visited Iran May 27-29.  With that visit past, Sri Lanka is 
likely to belatedly take steps to implement UNSCR 1747 in the 
near future.
