  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "To create a space for new win-win" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(01/16): 
"The U.S. -China economic and trade relationship has been developing 
over the last 30 years. The relationship's growth has exceeded the 
most optimistic estimation from before the establishment of 
diplomatic relations. A mutually beneficial, bilateral, economic and 
trade relationship has created the real economic interests of the 
two countries. The economic and trade relationship provides a strong 
motivation for the continued development of the U.S. - China 
relationship. The differing developmental phases of the U.S. and 
China have given a strong supplementary nature to the two countries' 
industrial structures. The U.S.-China economic and trade 
relationship has developed away from a mutually beneficial 
relationship into a mutually dependent relationship. The 
international financial crisis has greatly influenced China's 
exports. The U.S. and China are both large markets for each other. 
In the current financial crisis, the two should make a larger effort 
to promote their economic and trade relations. What's more, the two 
should create spaces for new win-win situations for the sake of the 
global economic recovery." 
 
b. "An American official wants China to publicize their nuclear 
secrets" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/16): "The chief consultant for Asia 
Affairs to President Bush and the Director of East Asia Affairs on 
the National Security Committee, has recently claimed that China is 
disguising their position on nuclear weapons and urges China to 
publicize their nuclear secrets. Chinese experts believe that this 
notion is baseless and that the U.S. should not bring a request like 
this to China because it is a nuclear power. The U.S. clearly knows 
that China holds vastly less nuclear strength than the U.S. This 
move is aimed at enlarging the U.S.' own military deterrence. The 
U.S. has created an imbalance in the nuclear politics between the 
U.S. and China, like the Taiwan issue, and now tried to make 
imbalance on military issues as well. It is baseless to say that the 
U.S. encountered China's sudden military activities because of the 
non-transparency of Chinese military. A military's transparency has 
no relation with maintaining its nuclear striking capability. It has 
always been the intention of the U.S. to detect China's nuclear 
secrets." 
 
¶2. U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
"'Smart power' diplomacy will change the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/16): "The phrase 'Smart power' has become 
a hot phrase in the U.S. because Hillary mentioned it 13 times 
during her Senate hearing.  The largest issue with U.S. diplomatic 
measures is that it is either too hard or too soft. This idea, 
'smart power', has a strategic meaning. It is an extension of the 
general U.S. diplomatic strategy and emphasizes that terrorism is 
not the only major threat to the U.S. 'Smart power' has become a new 
strategy that scholar, think tank, congressmen and Generals are 
enthusiastic about. 'Smart power' strategy advocates providing 
global benefits to the international society. Obama and Hillary have 
been deeply influenced by the idea of 'smart power' in their 
policy-making. China should educate itself on this concept so that 
it can predict the development and direction of the U.S.' strategy 
and the U.S.-China relationship. China should keep vigilant, 
considering that 'smart power' will put the U.S.-Japan alliance into 
the same position as the U.S.-Japan relationship. Trilateral 
relations of the U.S., Japan and China are likely to become more and 
more frequent."
