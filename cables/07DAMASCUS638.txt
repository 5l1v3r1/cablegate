¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
---------------------------------------- 
 
"A Call for Dialogue and Reconciliation" 
 
---------------------------------------- 
 
Muhammad Khayr al-Jammali, an editorialist in government-owned 
Al-Thawra, wrote (6/26):  "Israel and the US administration are the 
only parties benefiting from the political crisis in the Palestinian 
territories.  The loser is the Palestinian cause and the 
achievements that the Palestinian people have scored throughout 
their struggle to regain their rights and occupied land.  The 
infighting and rifts in Palestinian ranks have offered a gratuitous 
service to the American-Israeli alliance and its plans to liquidate 
the Palestinian cause.... 
 
"Palestinians must be aware of the dangers of the American-Israeli 
role and its malicious objectives.... They must return to dialogue 
 
and implement the understandings and agreements reached in Damascus 
and Mecca to achieve a solid national accord and unity...." 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
"To Remove Marks of their Crimes" 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
Izz-al-Din al-Darwish, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, 
wrote (6/26):  "The White House theoreticians are working to expand 
the scope of their aggressions and interferences in the Arab region 
in an effort to remove the marks of their crimes in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.... 
 
"Developments in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon are parts 
of the brazen US maneuvers.... Why all the US rush to support one 
Palestinian party against another?  Why all the US interference in 
Lebanese affairs, that reached the point of US Ambassador Feltman 
criticizing the Arab mediation effort...? 
 
"Arab peoples are fully aware that American hands are tampering with 
the region's affairs and resources.... 
 
"Stubbornness does not score victories, and everyone knows that the 
Bush administration has been defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan and 
that the attempts to expand the circle of aggression to remove the 
marks of the crimes will not succeed, as is obvious, especially 
since everyone knows what the Bush administration is doing and 
planning...." 
 
--------------------------- 
 
"Playing on Contradictions" 
 
--------------------------- 
 
Umar Jaftali, a commentator in government-owned Tishreen, wrote 
(6/26):  "The promises of political and financial support for the 
Palestinian Authority are meant to entrench Palestinian rifts and 
distract the Palestinians with permanent debates and marginal issues 
to give Olmert's government more time to evade the requirements of 
peace and complete its plan to Judaize Jerusalem and other areas in 
the West Bank.... 
 
"Palestinians must be alert and must read well all their bitter 
experiences of the past and the present." 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
"Olmert and Bush, a Meeting of Disappointment" 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
Dr. Jihad Bakfaluni, a columnist in government-owned Al-Thawra, 
wrote (6/26):  "Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's visit to the 
United States was a big failure.... 
 
"Both Olmert and President Bush are in bad situations, with each 
suffering physical and psychological crises.... 
 
"The Olmert-Bush meeting was the meeting of disappointment, where 
the two wanted to vent the failures and setbacks that are growing 
more complicated and are weighing heavily on them.  Iraqis will not 
relent in their confrontation with the American invader until he 
leaves in defeat and humiliation.  And Palestinians will not support 
the trend of humiliation and capitulation, the trend that allows the 
Zionists to engage in killing, destruction, and violation of all 
taboos whenever and however they want...."
