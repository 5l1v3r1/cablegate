¶2.  The new Executive Secretary, or Deputy Minister is Joco Paulo 
Capobianco. 
 
¶3.  According to Minister Silva, the changes were made to better fit 
the new themes and demands of the international environmental 
agenda.  However, the changes were announced one day after President 
Lula's complained about delays in the construction of two large 
hydropower dams in the Amazon due to the long process of getting 
environmental licenses.  Earlier media reports said President Lula 
only agreed to keep Minister Silva as Environment Minister if she 
agreed to set Ministry goals closer to those supporting Brazil's 
economic development.
