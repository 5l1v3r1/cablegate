¶1. Embassy on October 20 delivered reftel demarches on Israel 
at the 60th UNGA (Holocaust Remembrance Resolution and 
opposing anti-Israel bias) to MFA UN affairs director 
Michelle Cohen.  We thanked her for the Dominican Republic's 
offer to co-sponsor the Holocaust Resolution.  We also urged 
that the Dominican Republic vote against renewing the mandate 
of the three UN institutions that are biased against Israel, 
instead of abstaining or being absent for the votes.as last 
year.  Cohen had no immediate response, but undertook to 
present our demarches to higher levels for decision.  We 
requested and will report any significant substantive 
response.
