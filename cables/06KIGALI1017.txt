SUBJECT: GOR ON TRACK TO ABOLISH DEATH PENALTY 
 
 
¶1. (U) On 17 October Rwandan Justice Minister Tharcisse 
Karugarama held a press conference to announce a "nation wide 
debate" on the abolishment of the death penalty in Rwanda. 
Although it has not been implemented since 22 genocidaires 
were shot by  firing squads in 1997, the subject has been a 
key issue in discussions between the GOR and the Arusha based 
International Criminal Tribune for Rwanda (ICTR).  ICTR chief 
prosecutor Hassan Bubcar Jallow described the death penalty 
as "the major stumbling block" in a final agreement to 
transfer ICTR detainees to Rwanda for trial.  The discussion 
follows a 7 Oct meeting of the ruling Rwandese Patriotic 
Front (RPF), chaired by President Kagame, that made the 
recommendation that the government abolish the death penalty. 
 The cabinet then directed the Minister of Justice to launch 
public debates which, in addition to the press conference, 
will include a discussion at the Political Parties Forum on 
19 Oct and debate with students and academic staff at the 
National University on 20 Oct. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment. Although described as Kaurgarama as a 
"public debate" and that a consensus has not been reached on 
the issue, last week's RPF announcement likely means this 
decision has been made and the public discussion is a 
formality that will not impact the final outcome.  In 
addition to resolving the ICTR transfer question, ending the 
death penalty will also allow Rwanda to discuss suspect 
transfers with European nations.  However, there will still 
be opposition to the decision by genocide survivors groups 
and others who believe that the state should execute those 
found guilty of genocide.  End comment.
