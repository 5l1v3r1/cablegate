Â¶1. We delivered reftel demarche on October 4 to MFA Middle 
East and North Africa Department First Secretary Timur 
Zabirov.  Zabirov expressed GOR support for the Tribunal 
mission, although he could not specify the level of GOR 
funding.  Zabirov warned against the use of the Tribunal as a 
means to a political agenda.  While supporting the 
investigation of former Lebanese PM Hariri's assassination, 
the GOR opposes implicating Syria without clear evidence.
