SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: AFGHANISTAN 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage July 18-20 on the 2009 World Games, which began in 
Kaohsiung the evening of the 16th; on U.S. TV news legend Walter 
Cronkite, who passed away in New York last Friday; on the results of 
this year's university entrance exams in Taiwan; and on the 
celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon 
landing on July 20.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, a 
column in the pro-unification "United Daily News" discussed the 
recent incident in which a U.S. soldier was captured in Afghanistan. 
 The article questioned whether U.S. President Barack Obama has 
miscalculated regarding his plan to send more U.S. troops to 
Afghanistan.  End summary. 
 
"Obama Miscalculates [the Decision to] Augment Troops in 
Afghanistan?" 
 
A column in the pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 
400,000] wrote (7/20): 
 
"U.S. President Barack Obama, since taking over the helm, has made 
two major revisions to his strategic plans concerning the 
battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively.  He has placed a 
priority on the war in Afghanistan and continuously sent [more] U.S. 
troops to the country over the past few months.  The 32,000 U.S. 
soldiers originally stationed in Afghanistan will be increased to 
68,000 by the end of this year.  Together with the 36,000 soldiers 
from other allies who are also stationed in Afghanistan, the move is 
aimed at securing a smooth presidential election in Afghanistan on 
August 20 and fighting a quick battle with the Taliban.  But the 
recent military actions by the United States to suppress the Taliban 
have resulted in frequent injuries and deaths.  The worst case was 
that of the first U.S. soldier to be captured since the United 
States sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001. ...  It appears that 
Obama's [decision to] send more troops to Afghanistan will likely 
start with a bang and end with a fizzle.  One of the reasons for 
such a failure is that [Washington] has failed to learn from the 
lesson of the former Soviet Union [in Afghanistan]."
