SUBJECT: GOOD SECURITY ALLOWS PANJSHIR TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE 
ENERGY 
 
¶1.  Summary. Panjshir province has become a model for "clean" 
energy, with virtually 100 percent of electricity coming from 
renewable sources.  Recent projects include Afghanistan's first wind 
farm providing power for the provincial government center, multiple 
micro hydro-electric systems, and solar-powered health clinics. 
Panjshir's unique security environment allows such energy projects 
to be built and sustained, free from interference or sabotage. 
Additionally, these clean energy projects will allow Panjshir to 
maintain its relatively pristine environment - a key element in the 
province being able to develop its tourism potential when 
Afghanistan's overall security situation improves in the future. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
POWERING THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  First Vice President Ahmed Zia Massoud inaugurated Afghanistan's 
first power-generating wind farm on November 13.  The wind farm 
project, funded by the Panjshir PRT at a cost of USD 977,000, has a 
capacity of 30 kw of electricity, expandable to 100 kw.  The ten 
turbines of the wind farm serve as the primary power source for the 
new provincial government complex. 
 
¶3.  Providing power on a consistent basis to the government complex, 
the wind farm has enabled the governor's staff and key ministry 
personnel to be co-located which significantly improved coordination 
among provincial officials.  Prior to transferring to the compound, 
officials were scattered throughout the province and were often 
operating in facilities that were inadequate at best. 
 
------------------------------ 
A LEADER IN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY 
------------------------------ 
¶4.  The wind farm is only the latest example of the application of 
renewable energy technology in the Panjshir Valley.  Approximately 
25 percent of the province's population has access to electricity -- 
virtually all of it from renewable sources.   Lacking a provincial 
power grid, and given Panjshir's rugged mountainous terrain, the 
valley presents an ideal setting for decentralized, renewable energy 
projects.  Additionally, Panjshir is endowed with all the right 
ingredients for "green" energy -- swift-running rivers, ample 
sunshine, and, near-constant wind at higher elevations. 
¶5.  In addition to the wind farm, the province has 27 PRT funded 
"micro hydro-electric" projects either completed or in process.  A 
single micro hydro-electric system can provide electricity for 
approximately 500 people, enough to power most of Panjshir's 
villages while having little effect on the river's flow.  The 
province is also considering the feasibility of a significantly 
larger power-generating dam project in the valley.  Such a project, 
if built, could potentially power not only most of Panjshir, but 
also areas beyond the valley. 
¶6.  Additionally, solar power is playing an increasingly important 
role in the electricity mix of the valley.  Solar-panels on health 
clinics throughout Panjshir will power water purification systems. 
The water purifiers will not only provide clean water for the 
clinics, but also for surrounding villagers, helping address the 
problem of water-borne illnesses in the province. 
 
¶7.  While green electricity is becoming increasingly important in 
Panjshir, Panjshiris must still rely on traditional fuels for 
heating, including wood and dried animal dung.  As trees are already 
a scarce resource in the rocky gorges of the valley, fast-growing, 
high-altitude "hybrid Poplar" trees that provide a ready source of 
firewood and building material are being considered as a potential 
project for the province. 
---------------------- 
SECURITY MAKES IT WORK 
---------------------- 
 
¶8.  Projects such as the Panjshir wind farm are relatively expensive 
and vulnerable to sabotage.  While not suitable in all areas of 
Afghanistan, they work in Panjshir because of the secure 
environment, free from Taliban or other insurgent actiity.  Such 
projects serve as a powerful and hghly visible demonstration of 
what is possibl when security is present.  First Vice President 
Massoud, brother of the late Ahmed Shah Massoud -- the legendary 
"Lion of Panjshir," notd in his remarks at the wind farm opening

that "Security will always be a concern for anything we develop in 
this country...but Panjshir's geographical location and 
well-esablished security made this province a good choie to usher 
in the development we hope to bing to our country."
