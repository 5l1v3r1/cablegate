¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In a December 20 meeting in Sao Paulo with 
Ambassador Sobel, Microsoft Brazil President Michel Levy 
stated that current GOB policies are antagonistic towards 
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).  According to Levy, the 
GOB through the Foreign Ministry (Itamaraty) has mounted an 
international campaign to discredit Microsoft's proprietary 
XML format and is pushing for countries to adopt the ODF 
(Open Document Format) at the expense of XML at the March 
meeting of the International Standards Organization in 
Geneva.  Levy sees both ideological issues as well as 
commercial interests at work in the GOB position.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) Microsoft Brazil President Michel Levy requested a 
meeting with Ambassador Sobel on December 20 to discuss ways 
forward on working with what he characterized as an 
antagonistic GOB.  According to Levy, Itamaraty has pressured 
the purportedly independent Brazilian Technical Standards 
Agency, ABNT to adopt a more aggressive posture against using 
XML as one of two possible standards, along with ODF, in 
Brazil.  In addition, Levy stated that he is in the 
possession of unsigned letters from Itamaraty to various 
foreign governments requesting that the governments work 
together to support only the open source ODF as the 
international standard. 
 
¶3.  (C) Levy believes that this issue has turned ideological 
and is a manifestation of anti-Americanism within Itamaraty. 
He cited President Lula's Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff as 
well as high-ranking advisor Celso Alvarez as being the chief 
architects of an anti-IPR, anti-royalties strategy within the 
GOB.  According to Levy, these advisors have convinced 
President Lula that there is no difference between ODF and 
proprietary XML software.  His main concern is that the GOB 
will use the ABNT to adopt an ODF only standard by decree 
rather than going through Congress where Microsoft would at 
least have an opportunity to explain the differences between 
the software systems.  Levy used as an example that all of 
Embraer's designs are created through XML and that the 
current ODF software simply can't do the same job.  If ODF is 
the only standard, Levy argued, there could be economic 
ramifications for Brazil. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Levy then pointed out that commercially Microsoft 
faces an uneven playing field in Brazil.  He stated that in 
addition to several bills in the Brazilian Congress that 
would deny the GOB the ability to buy proprietary software, 
there are reports that many recent bids that went to tender 
had specific, if unwritten, instructions that disallowed any 
Microsoft bids.  He further stated that the issue of 
cross-retaliation on IPR from the cotton subsidies case is 
alive and well and could potentially come to pass in 2008. 
 
¶5.  (C)  While Levy made it clear that Microsoft is not 
asking for any USG advocacy at this point, and in fact 
requested that our communication be kept strictly 
confidential, Ambassador Sobel did offer advice on various 
 
SIPDIS 
approaches Microsoft could take in generating support for 
standards that would have room for both ODF and XML software. 
 Specifically, the Ambassador thought Mircosoft should work 
through various trade groups to begin a discussion with the 
GOB on this issue.  The Ambassador also indicated that 
Microsoft should get Brazilian companies to put this issue 
high on the agenda of the CEO Forum meetings to take place 
with Department of Commerce Secretary Gutierrez early next 
year. 
 
¶6.  (C)  COMMENT:  The debate among various international 
standards (GPS, telecommunications, etc.) is not new in 
Brazil, and Levy's concerns about an anti-American ideology 
in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry are not only Microsoft's 
concern.  Microsoft's concerns that the GOB is seeking to 
adopt one standard that does not allow for proprietary 
softwear, bears watching.  A multi-industry push for a 
strategy that allows for Congressional debate over the 
relative merits of the software systems will certainly yield 
better results than Microsoft fighting this issue alone.  END 
COMMENT.
