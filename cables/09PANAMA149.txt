Ernesto Cerrud, Coordinator for the Global Initiative to 
Combat Nuclear Terrorism within the Panamanian MFA, told 
POLOFF February 17 that the GOP knew about the workshop 
scheduled to take place in Garmisch Germany from April 20-22 
to revise the Model Guidelines Document. He said it was 
unlikely that the GOP would send a representative to the 
meeting, though he said the GOP was aware of the issues to be 
discussed.
