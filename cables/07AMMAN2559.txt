SUBJECT: JORDAN,S KING CALLS SAMARRA BOMBINGS A "HEINOUS 
CRIME" 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 01949 
 
(U) King Abdullah strongly condemned the June 13 attack on 
the Al-Askari Golden Dome mosque and shrine in Samarra, Iraq. 
 Jordan's Petra news service quoted from a letter the King 
wrote to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani saying, "this heinous 
crime was an insult for all Muslims."  King Abdullah restated 
Jordan's condemnation of all violent actions that aim to kill 
Iraqis or destroy their holy places, and reaffirmed his 
support for the unity of the Iraqi people.  The King's 
condemnation of the Samarra attack was reported prominently 
by Jordanian media outlets.
