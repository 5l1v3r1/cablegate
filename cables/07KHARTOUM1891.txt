¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: AEC Chairman Tom Vraalsen presented the AEC's 
two-year progress report to Sudanese President Al-Bashir on November 
¶3.  There has not been any public reaction by the Government as yet, 
no doubt because the report notes the major areas of deficiency in 
implementation, chief among them the Abyei stalemate.  Seeking 
balance, the report also emphasizes the areas of successful CPA 
implementation.  Those who actually read the report will be left 
with the impression that a plethora of implementing bodies (and 
acronyms) have been created, but also left wondering just how much 
work the many agencies have accomplished (in general, not much). 
This cable summarizes the report, which is formally titled "Factual 
Report on the Status of CPA Implementation, 2007."  End Summary 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Chairman's Foreword: Some impressive achievements 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2.  (U) The Report starts with the Chairman's Foreword focusing on 
the four working groups - Power Sharing (headed by Italy), Wealth 
Sharing (U.S.), Three Areas (Netherlands), and Security Arrangements 
(U.K.).  The Foreword notes "significant progress achieved by the 
parties in implementation of CPA since 2005."  Chief among the 
accomplishments are the adoption of the Interim National 
Constitution (INC) and the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan 
(ICSS), the establishment of the Government of National Unity (GNU) 
and the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS), and, not least of all, 
"the general compliance with the ceasefire."  The Foreword points 
out that the ambitious task outlined in the CPA is nothing less than 
political nation-building, "a daunting task under the best of 
circumstances."  The various accomplishments and shortcomings are 
put in perspective, in essence that this is a hugely ambitious task, 
and much has in fact been accomplished. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Power Sharing:  Successes and Shortcomings 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (U) Much has been accomplished in building the new institutions 
called for in the CPA, including the Presidency, the National 
Assembly, and the Interim constitution.  However, in other areas, 
deadlines have not been met and much remains to be done.  Among the 
successes and shortcomings in implementation: 
 
Successes: 
 
-- Many bodies created, most are "in operation" 
-- Progress in planning census 
-- Census pilot project carried out in all states 
-- Southern representation on National Constitutional Court 
-- National Judicial Service Commission established, training a 
national judiciary 
-- North/South technical border commission established and 
operating, aiming for border demarcation by February 2008 
-- Southern and Northern States have adopted state constitutions 
 
Failings: 
 
-- Abyei interim administrative area council not established 
-- No national program for reconciliation and healing 
-- Chronic delays in funding hampers census planning 
-- National Electoral Law and Commission overdue 
-- Continued non-representation of Southerners in Khartoum law 
enforcement agencies 
-- Commission to safeguard rights of non-Muslims in Khartoum not yet 
operational 
-- National Civil Service Commission, affirmative action program not 
yet operational 
-- National Security Act and Council not established 
-- Human Rights Commission not established 
-- Identification of security organs of the two parties and their 
assets not accomplished 
-- No Southern representation on National Supreme Court 
-- National Land Commission not established

Wealth Sharing: Oil revenues distributed, but more transparency is 
required 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4.  (U) The U.S.-led Working Group reported that, by and large, the 
provisions of the wealth sharing protocol are being met.  The 
various agencies called for in the protocol are up and running.  Oil 
revenues are being distributed to the various parties according to 
the formula enshrined in the protocol and the CPA.  However, the 
SPLM is pushing for more transparency along the entire stream of oil 
production.  For example, the SPLM has concerns regarding the levels 
of transport and management fees being deducted from the profits. 
For its part, the NCP claims that the SPLM/GOSS has usurped some 
functions of the national government in the South, particularly 
collection of customs duties.

¶5.  (U) Abyei accounts for the most significant shortcoming in 
wealth sharing:  because the Abyei area borders have not been 
agreed, the entitlement to oil revenues from the area have not been 
determined, and transfers of funds has not taken place. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Three Areas:  No progress on Abyei 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) The Abyei area dominates this working group, with little 
progress to report.  The report states that "Progress with regard to 
the Protocol on the Resolution of the Abyei Conflict has been little 
as the key decision on the ABC-report, submitted to the Presidency 
on 14 July 2005, has yet to be taken.  Parties differ on the 
validity of the report which prevents further implementation of the 
majority of provisions of the protocol." 
 
¶7.  (U) Regarding the other two areas, Southern Kordofan and Blue 
Nile, the report notes "substantial progress."  However, the two 
states are struggling to cope with the fiscal and policy 
decentralization mandated by the CPA. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Security: Ceasefire holds, but JIUs not integrated 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶8.  (U) According to the AEC report, it is in the realm of Security 
that the most progress has been achieved in CPA implementation.  The 
Security Working Group notes that aside from one serious incident in 
November 2006, "ceasefire violations have been few and comparatively 
minor - the peace has held."  However, in the area of forming and 
strengthening the institutions to maintain that peace and, in the 
longer term, to foster national unity, much still remains to be 
done. 
 
¶9.  (U) Much progress has been made on redeployment of troops, but 
the two parties disagree on the numbers remaining to be redeployed. 
The SAF maintains that it redeployed over 90% of its non-Joint 
Integrated Unit (JIU) forces by the CPA deadline of 09 July 2007, 
and claims that most of the remaining forces are in the 
oil-producing areas and cannot leave until the JIUs are able to take 
over there. 
 
¶10.  (U) The JIUs themselves are impressive on paper, though the 
reality is far less impressive.  The report notes, "while 
co-located, and with each JIU having a commander chosen on a 
rotating basis between SAF and SPLA, in practice the two command 
chains have generally remained separate, with separate 
administration and, to date, limited professional interaction." 
Some of the supposedly SAF forces in the JIUs are, in fact, other 
armed groups (OAGs) that were associated with the SAF.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Vraalsen obviously tried to strike a balance in his 
report between highlighting the progress that has been made, while 
encouraging more of it, and drawing attention to the challenges that 
lie ahead.  Vraalsen writes that three years remain in the interim 
period in which the two parties must "make unity attractive" to the 
voters of Southern Sudan if national unity is to be maintained after 
¶2011.  He notes that no "program for reconciliation and healing" has 
been instituted - a shortcoming that neither party seems concerned 
about.  The AEC report does not refer to the current political 
crisis between the SPLM and the NCP, but it is the outcome of that 
crisis - particularly on the Abyei issue - in the upcoming weeks and 
months that may determine the success or failure of the CPA.  Even 
complete success in that regard seems unlikely to change the minds 
of many in the South on whether to vote for unity in 2011.  After 
decades of war, much mistrust remains.
