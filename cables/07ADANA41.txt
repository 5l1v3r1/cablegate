POLITICAL 
 
EVRENSEL:       The representatives of Gundem daily, whose 
publication was banned for one month last week, will hold a 
press announcement tomorrow.  The venue of the press 
announcement was not specified by the daily. 
 
RADIKAL / EVRENSEL:     The police conducted an unannounced raid 
at the Tunceli chapter of DTP yesterday.  Police also conducted 
raids on the houses of DTP members and detained ten people. 
According to Radikal, a total of five people were detained. 
Radikal further stated that police conducted the raid as a 
result of tip-offs about PKK members making contact with DTP 
officials ahead of Newroz celebrations.  DTP Tunceli chairperson 
condemned the raids, and the EMEP's (Party of Labor) party 
organization showed its reaction to the raids by paying a visit 
to DTP Tunceli chapter.  Meanwhile, actions were reportedly 
brought against chairmen of DTP chapters in three western 
provinces for "praising the criminal acts and criminals." 
 
 
EVRENSEL:       The daily reports that "as some circles are trying 
to escalate tension before the Newroz celebrations," 76 
applications have been lodged nationwide with authorities to get 
permission for this year's Newroz celebrations and preparations 
for Newroz were well under way.  The Diyarbakir Newroz committee 
stated that some problems were experienced with their 
application process because of the non-Turkish "w" letter in the 
word Newroz used in the application documents.  It is expected 
that Diyarbakir, Van and Batman will be able to celebrate Newroz 
on March 21.  Committees in Igdir and Agri provinces were 
granted permission for March 21.  The authorities overturned the 
application of the DTP in Tunceli because of the "w" letter in 
the documents and the committee had to reapply after revising 
the documents.  The Deputy Chairperson of the Diyarbakir DTP 
said that they hoped to attract one million people to this 
year's celebrations in Diyarbakir. 
 
HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    Adana Mayor Aytac Durak, who has served 
19 years as Adana mayor, reportedly announced five months ago 
that he will not run again in the next elections.  However, 
Durak startled everybody in town by stating that he will not 
leave the seat before completing the controversial light rail 
metro project which was launched twenty years ago. (This summary 
is from March 14 edition.)
