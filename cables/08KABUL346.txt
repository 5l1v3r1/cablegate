     ¶C. WILLIAMS-BAKER E-MAIL (13 JAN 2008) 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Wood for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Wood on January 31 raised the 
cluster munitions (CM) issue with President Karzai and 
National Security Advisor Rassoul, who said the Afghan 
government would not take any steps that would damage the 
U.S.-Afghan security relationship.  Foreign Minister 
Spanta told the Ambassador and Assistant Secretary Boucher 
on February 8 that although an Afghan representative would 
attend the Wellington meeting on CM, the Afghan government 
would not sign any document produced by the "Oslo Process." 
 
¶2. (C) Following up on Embassy demarches to the MOD and 
MFA in December (Ref C), Ambassador Wood discussed the 
Oslo Process with Karzai and Rassoul on January 31.  Karzai 
and Rassoul understood the significance of the issue for 
the U.S.-Afghan strategic partnership and promised that 
the Afghan Government wold not sign an Oslo Process 
treaty. 
 
¶3. (C) Following Spanta's return on February 7 from 
extended travel, he informed Ambassador Wood that the 
participation by an Afghan representative at Oslo Process 
meetings was a mistaken initiative by the Afghan Ambassador 
to Norway.  MFA officials at the Assistant Secretary level 
had apparently viewed the cluster munitions issue in the 
same vein as the anti-landmine Ottawa Treaty, to which 
Afghanistan is a party.  The MFA bureaucracy saw an 
opportunity to further insert Afghanistan into the 
anti-landmine (inclusive of ordnance resulting in 
explosive remnants of war) group of nations in the 
international community without regard for the implications 
for the U.S.-Afghan relationship.  When the issue reached 
the Foreign Minister's office, the Minister's Senior 
Advisor provided informal assurances that Afghanistan would 
not be a signatory to an Oslo Process treaty, which Spanta 
formally confirmed on February 7. 
 
¶4. (C) COMMENT:  The delay in receiving a formal response 
from the MFA and the necessity of raising this issue with 
the President underscore the dearth of experienced 
diplomats in the MFA.  It also underscores the narrow focus 
of the MOD, which was unaware of Afghan participation in 
Oslo Process meetings and the implications for U.S.-Afghan 
security relations.  Although Embassy encouraged the MOD to 
insert itself into the decision-making process, considering 
the military interoperability and training assistance 
equities, Defense Minister Wardak was reluctant to engage 
on a "diplomatic" matter unless/until brought up in cabinet 
meetings.
