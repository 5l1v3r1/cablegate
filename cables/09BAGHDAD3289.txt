ADVISORY MISSION IN IRAQ 
 
REF: A. BAGHDAD 2384 
     ¶B. BAGHDAD 3141 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The corrections advisor program in Iraq is 
needed to ensure humane treatment of detainees turned over to 
the GOI as well as to bolster GOI institutional capacity 
through December 2011.  MNF-I will provide partial funding 
for the continuation of the corrections advisory program for 
coalition-related facilities.  In the context of ongoing 
budget discussions across the interagency in Washington, Post 
would like to underline our support for continued State 
Department funding of the ICITAP mission.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU) Current INL-funding provides support to the 
corrections mission as previously agreed with ICITAP.  This 
funding takes into account a planned dramatic staffing 
decrease between now and the end of the mission currently 
slated for March 2011.  Current funding will not provide 
assurance that the Iraqi Corrections Service (ICS) can 
independently sustain prison operations without tragic or 
dangerous failures at high risk prisons.  Had ICITAP 
corrections advisors been present at the Baghdad Central 
Prison in September 2009, they would have provided guidance 
to the ICS to prevent or at least mitigate the disturbance 
that destroyed that facility and required the MOJ to move 
over 2000 detainees to Chamchamal Prison.  ICITAP advisors 
are required to ensure minimum oversight and capacity 
development of the ICS during the extremely important 
transition period. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Against this backdrop -- and given how important the 
advisors are to prison security -- we support the State 
Department continuing the program, including covering the 
projected USD 9.8 million shortfall after DOD contributions. 
Doing so would allow for a sufficient number of corrections 
advisors to remain in high-risk ICS facilities throughout the 
transition process to assist in guaranteeing both Iraqi 
institutional capacity and compliance with international 
human rights standards. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Such funding could support advisors at the following 
ICS prisons: Khadamiyah Maximum Security Prison, which houses 
death row inmates; Ft. Suse Prison, which holds AQI and third 
country nationals (TCNs); Rusafa Prison Complex, which is the 
ICS headquarters and primary intake center; Chamchamal 
Prison, currently under activation; and Basra Central Prison, 
which is under construction.  MNF-I will fund advisors 
through December 2011 at Cropper and Taji Theater Internment 
Facilities (TIF) and at the National Corrections Training 
Center.
