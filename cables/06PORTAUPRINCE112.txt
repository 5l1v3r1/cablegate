SUBJECT: HAITI: FM ABRAHAM DISCUSSES DUVALIER PASSPORT
ISSUANCE WITH CHARGE
REF: PAP 0093
Classified By: CDA TIMOTHY M. CARNEY, REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D).

¶1. (C) Charge took the opportunity of a January 14 meeting
with Prime Minister Gerard Latortue to fortify points DAS
Duddy and DCM Griffiths raised in opposition to the interim
government´s issuance of a passport (diplomatic) to former
dictator "Baby Doc" Duvalier (reftel). PM Latortue, in
Charge´s presence, called Foreign Minister Herard Abraham
noting that he had failed to convey USG concern at the
decision in his last meeting with Abraham. Latortue recalled
points accurately to Abraham urging that the passport be
canceled or at the very least that Duvalier be dissuaded from
returning to Haiti at this point.

¶2. (C) On January 16, Abraham called Charge and convoked him
to a meeting on January 17 to continue discussions on the
issue. During the meeting, Abraham said he sent the passport
as part of an effort to de-mythologize Duvalier. He did not
accept Charge´s contentions that the visuals are bad, that
the matter should have awaited a duly elected Haitian
government or that Baby Doc is a risky, potentially divisive,
presence. He gave Charge his personal assurances that
Duvalier would not risk returning to Haiti at this time
because "he lacks appropriate guarantees, security and
otherwise, to secure his reentry into the country." Abraham
said he made the decision to issue the passport because
according to the law, every Haitian citizen has the right to
a passport (former president´s have the right to a diplomatic
passport) and that he would defend his decision even after he
completes his term as Foreign Minister. Abraham added that
Haitian citizens are not required to have a passport to enter
the country, simply some form of identification, therefore he
considered Duvalier´s passport issuance a "non-issue." He
concluded by refusing to revoke the passport already issued
to Duvalier, but confirming that he would do everything in
his power to transmit the message to Duvalier that he should
not to return to Haiti at this time.
