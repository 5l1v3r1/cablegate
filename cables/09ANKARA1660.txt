PROPOSAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 117710 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to MFA Energy 
Department Head Berris Ekinci and Nonproliferation and 
Disarmament Section Head Mustafa Yurdakul on November 17. 
While noting no particular objections to the reftel 
information, Ekinci said the GoT will seek additional 
information about the proposal at the November 19 briefing 
that the Russian delegation had scheduled in Vienna.  She 
said the MFA would have to consult the Turkish Atomic Energy 
Agency following the November 19 briefing and will have to 
weigh the relative merits of the Angarsk Reserve proposal 
with other nuclear fuel bank proposals before taking a 
decision.  We noted that the various nuclear fuel bank 
proposals are not competitive but complementary in nature and 
urged the GoT to support the likely Russian request for a 
resolution in support of its proposal at the upcoming IAEA 
Board of Governors meeting.  Ekinci agreed to meet again 
during the week of November 23, after the GoT has had a 
chance to evaluate additional information from the Russian 
briefing.
