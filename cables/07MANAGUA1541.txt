SUBJECT: NEW ACTING MINISTER OF DEFENSE RECEIVES AMBASSADOR 
 
REF: MANAGUA 1223 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Ambassador met with Ruth Tapia Roa, the new Secretary 
General and acting Minister of Defense (reftel), on June 4 to 
discuss issues of mutual concern.  Although Tapia's office 
delayed granting the appointment for several weeks, the 
meeting was cordial.  She led the meeting on behalf of the 
Ministry, clearly having taken charge from Dr. Juan Umana, 
the previous "administrator," who was also present.  Tapia 
did not initiate any point of discussion, but generally 
pledged to continue cooperation in a number of areas. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The following is a summary of topics raised by 
Ambassador: 
 
-- White Paper Process: Ambassador mentioned that military 
roles in the region have changed, and we hope that the 
Ministry and Army continue to support the 2005 Defense and 
Security White Paper elaborated by both institutions and 
endorsed by the FSLN most recently in September 2006.  Tapia 
responded that the White Paper is a "good base," but 
continued (rather cryptically) that "all things can be 
improved." 
 
-- Property: Ambassador commented that, despite an overall 
beneficial and cooperative relationship with the Army, the 
unresolved property cases remain a point of contention. 
 
-- SOFA: Ambassador thanked the Ministry for help in 
approving a series of diplomatic notes for New Horizons, ship 
visits, and other activities.  He explained that a blanket 
SOFA could further streamline cooperation and reduce the 
bureaucratic burden on both parties.  Tapia replied that she 
would support a process to simplify procedures. 
 
-- MANPADS: Ambassador reiterated that achieving the full 
destruction of Nicaragua's MANPADS stocks remains a priority 
for the USG, although this is not simply a bilateral issue as 
the threat of MANPADS to civilians has been recognized by the 
OAS, UN, and other organizations. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: It is unlikely that Tapia will establish 
independence for the Ministry of Defense beyond the will of 
the Army or the Presidency.  President Ortega declined to 
make her a full Minister and clearly intends to retain 
personal control over defense and security policy.
