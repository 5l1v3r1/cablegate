REF: A) USDOC 04879 B)GBS 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the 
USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), 
Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at 
Siltronic Singapore Pte Ltd., 10 Tampines 
Industrial Ave. 5, Singapore (Siltronic).  The ECO 
was accompanied by Kevin Boo of Singapore Customs 
for this PSV.  The items in question are 20 sic 
coated graphite single wafer susceptors exported 
on or about March 1, 2007 and March 8, 2007.  On 
the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), 
the items are classified under ECCN 3B001 and are 
most likely controlled for national security (NS) 
reasons.  The exporter was SGL Carbon of St. 
Mary's Pennsylvania. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, 
Siltronic has been in existence since 1997.  Its 
paid-up share capital is the Singapore equivalent 
of USD 180 million.  Singapore national, Mr. Bock 
Cheng Niew and German national Michael Bernhard 
Peterat are listed as directors.  The sole 
shareholder is listed as Netherlands company 
Siltronic Holding International B.V. 
 
¶4.  On June 21, 2007, the ECO met with several 
officials of Siltronic including Mr. Divakaran 
Krishnan, Head of Procurement and Logistics and 
Klaus Mortiz, Senior Manager of Strategic 
Procurement.  Siltronic officials provided an 
overview of the company which is part of the 
Siltronic group of companies, a worldwide leader 
in silicon wafer production (more information at 
www.siltronic.com).  The Singapore operation has 
been in existence since 1997 and has approximately 
530 staff primarily engaged in production of 
silicon wafers.  Its customers are located 
primarily in Asia although it ships product 
worldwide. 
 
¶5.  As to the specific items in question, Mr. 
Krishnan provided the ECO with copies of the 
relevant company invoices and delivery notes 
confirming receipt of the items.  These were so- 
called goods receipt slips (dated April 2, 2007 
and March 5, 2007) referencing purchase order 
¶4500455637.  Siltronic engineer Boon Koon Ow 
stated that the items are consumables used in 
surface deposition on the silicon wafers.  When 
they are needed, they are taken from the warehouse 
to the production line and later incinerated once 
they are used.  Mr. Ow provided ECO with a sample 
of the product. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Siltronic appeared to be 
a suitable recipient of the commodities shipped 
since Siltronic cooperated with the PSV and 
operates a line of business consistent with the 
use of the items.  The ECO recommends that this 
PSV be classified as Favorable.
