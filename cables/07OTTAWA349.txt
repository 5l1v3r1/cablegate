REF: STATE 20845 
 
¶1. (U) ESTH discussed WHO DG Chan's upcoming high-level 
consultation on polio eradication with GOC officials from 
Health Canada and Foreign Affairs Canada and provided a 
non-paper drawn from reftel.  Our interlocutors were well 
aware of Dr. Chan's initiative but were still deciding who 
would represent Canada in Geneva and were thus grateful to 
learn who planned to lead the U.S. delegation.  They have 
since advised that Canada will be represented at the 
consultation by Geneva mission CIDA counselor Peter Oldham 
and CIDA senior health advisor Garry Aslanyan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Canadian officials were likewise aware of the 
funding gap facing the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 
2007-08.  They noted the importance Canada attaches to 
eradicating polio and stressed that Prime Minister Harper was 
fully supportive and considered the GPEI a priority.  At the 
meeting, the delegation will reinforce continuing strong 
Canadian support for polio eradication efforts.  Canada 
contributed C$45 million to polio eradication in 2006-07, and 
was contributing an additional C$5 million for polio 
eradication in Afghanistan.  Our contacts said Canada had 
made no decisions about additional contributions to meet the 
funding gap, but noted active development assistance programs 
in the regions where polio seemed to be making a comeback. 
Any immediate additional support would be focused on efforts 
at the country level in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. 
(Canada does not have a donor relationship with India, at the 
latter's request.)
