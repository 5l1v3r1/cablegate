SUBJECT: U.S.-CHINA WORKING GROUP MEETS WITH GANSU GOVERNOR 
LU HAO 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a meeting between a visiting 
delegation from the U.S.-China Working Group led by 
Congressmen Mark Kirk, Rick Larsen and Tom Feeney and 
Gansu Governor Lu Hao, the two sides discussed 
increased educational exchanges between Gansu 
universities and University of Illinois.  The space 
launch facility located in Gansu has limited local 
economic impact beyond locally provided support 
services, the Governor highlighted.  Despite rapid 
economic growth and significant fiscal support from 
the central government Gansu's economy continues to 
lag behind.  End summary. 
 
Bilateral Exchanges 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gansu Governor Lu Hao thanked Congressman 
Kirk for his assistance in supporting his visit to the 
United States in September of 2005.  The Governor's 
visit also included a trip to Oklahoma to celebrate 
the twentieth anniversary of their relationship as 
sister regions.  During the visit he signed an MOU 
with Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry pledging to push 
economic, educational, scientific and cultural 
cooperation. 
 
¶3.  (U) Congressman Kirk presented Governor Lu with a 
letter from the Chancellor of the University of 
Illinois expressing his desire to build an academic 
relationship with Lanzhou University and Gansu 
Agricultural University.  Governor Lu said that he was 
very pleased to receive the letter and that Gansu 
hopes to build stronger academic ties with the 
University.  Regional and educational cooperation is a 
very important part of the overall U.S.-China 
relationship, Governor Lu noted. 
 
Gansu Launch Site 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Responding to a question from Congressman 
Feeney, the Governor said that the space center is 
mainly engaged in research and launch activities, 
which does not filter down to the local economy. 
However, the support services for the launch site are 
provided locally, which is beneficial to the local 
economy. 
 
Gansu Economy 
------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Congressman Rick Larsen asked Governor Lu if 
he could give the delegation more background on the 
economy of Gansu including the difference between 
Gansu and the more developed regions of China.  The 
economy of Gansu is primarily based upon resource 
extraction and basic manufacturing including 
petrochemicals, steel and ferrous metals production, 
he noted.  Despite 11 percent growth last year, the 
per capita income of Lanzhou is only 78 percent of the 
national average, while rural Gansu is only 68 
percent, he added.  However, he claimed, the cost of 
living is much lower in Gansu than it is in coastal 
cities like Beijing.  Housing costs 10,000 RMB per sqm 
in Beijing, but in Lanzhou it is only 2000 RMB per 
sqm, he added. 
 
¶6.  Central government support to develop the western 
region of China has led to major investments in 
expressway, city and rural transportation 
infrastructure and water and sewage treatment, the 
Governor noted.  The central government has also 
invested significant amounts into education and health 
services for western regions like Gansu.  As an 
example of central government support for the West, 
Governor Lu noted that the fiscal revenues of Gansu 
Province were only 25 billion RMB while the actual 
expenditures were 40 billion RMB.
