¶1. (U) Per ref B, Public Safety Canada and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police are working with the Canadian Crime Stoppers 
Association, a non-profit organization, to establish a 
national hotline for reports of possible Trafficking in 
Persons (TIP) cases.  In January 2008, the Canadian 
government dedicated $6 million to strengthening initiatives 
to combat TIP, a portion of which will go to the Canadian 
Crime Stoppers Association for the establishment of the 
hotline.  The hotline is not yet operational.  Contacts could 
not provide a timeline for implementation.  The Canadian 
Crime Stoppers Association currently runs a hotline for the 
reporting of all crimes (1-800-222-TIPS).
