SUBJECT: APRIL 7 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: NORTH KOREA LAUNCH, SOMALI 
PIRATES, CHAVEZ VISIT 
 
¶1. Key points at the April 7 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- The UN Security Council should "make a prudent response" to the 
North Korea rocket launch and a satellite launch is "different than 
a missile launch or nuclear test." 
 
-- China has been "working to rescue the crew" of a ship from 
"Chinese Taiwan" captured by pirates near Somalia. 
 
-- Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez will arrive in China April 7 for 
a "working visit." 
 
North Korea Launch 
------------------ 
 
¶2. China has "taken note of North Korea's announcement" that it 
successfully launched a satellite, said MFA spokesperson Jiang Yu at 
the April 7 press conference.  China hoped relevant parties would 
"maintain caution and restraint" in order to promote peace and 
stability in the region, said Jiang.  China was willing to "continue 
to play a constructive role" on the issue.  Jiang said the UN 
Security Council should "make a prudent response" to the launch. 
Jiang noted that satellite and missile technologies "show 
similarities and differences" and that a satellite launch is 
"different than a missile launch or nuclear test."  This issue "also 
involves a country's right to the peaceful use of space," said 
Jiang.  Asked whether China had discussed the launch with North 
Korea, Jiang said that "China has maintained close communication 
with relevant parties about the satellite launch over the last few 
days."  "Under the circumstances," added Jiang, the best course 
would be to "continue the Six-Party Talks."  Countries should "focus 
on their long term interests" and "keep cool heads" in order to 
continue the Six-Party Talks. 
 
Piracy Involving Taiwan Vessel 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. When it learned of the hijacking of a ship from "Chinese Taiwan" 
on April 6 in the waters off of northern Somalia, China "attached 
great importance to the incident, worked to ascertain the situation 
and informed foreign embassies in China" about the situation.  China 
was "working to rescue the crew and the boat," added the 
spokesperson. 
 
Visit of Hugo Chavez 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez arrived in China on April 7 for 
a "working visit" said Jiang.  During the visit, Chavez planned to 
meet with President Hu Jintao and Vice President Xi Jinping.  China 
was willing to continue cooperation with Latin American countries 
"including Venezuela" said Jiang. 
 
Cyber Spies 
----------- 
 
¶5. China "firmly opposes and cracks down on all cyber-crime 
including hacking," said Jiang.  The accusations that China engages 
in "so-called cyber spying" were "groundless and would lead 
nowhere." 
 
Trilateral Meeting 
------------------ 
 
¶6. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao would attend a breakfast meeting with 
leaders from Korea and Japan on the margins of the April 10-12 ASEAN 
Summit in Thailand.  Wen Jiabao planned to "expound on Chinese 
ambitions for trilateral cooperation, exchange views and put forward 
initiatives" during that meeting, said Jiang.  China would also be 
willing to discuss regional issues during the meeting. 
 
Alliance for Civilization 
------------------------- 
 
¶7. China supported and attached great importance to the UN Alliance 
of Civilizations, said Jiang.  The Alliance "enhances mutual trust" 
and China supported the efforts of Spain and Turkey with regard to 
the Alliance. 
 
Visas for Foreigners in China 
----------------------------- 
 
¶8. China dealt with foreigners "according to laws and regulations,"

said Jiang.  China hoped all foreigners would abide by the law and 
was committed to protect the rights of foreigners in China.
