REF: A. MCKERNAN-O'HARA EMAIL 
     ¶B. ROME 04052 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  Please see Para 4 below. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Federika Ferrari Bravo, MFA Coordinator for 
Economic Assistance to Iraq, asked December 6 for U.S. help 
to complete an Italy-Iraq loan agreement to permit Italy to 
disburse a five million euro soft loan to reestablish the 
Iraqi meteorological system, essential for running Iraq's 
airports.  Italy cannot disburse the loan until the Iraqi 
Ministry of Finance signs the already-drafted agreement. 
 
¶3.  (U) Although Italy's own efforts to date have not led to 
a signed agreement, Ferrari Bravo said she would again ask 
Italy's Embassy in Baghdad to press Iraq's Finance Ministry, 
but would appreciate our also raising the matter with the 
Ministry.  The point of contact at Italy's Embassy in Baghdad 
is Mainarndo Bernadelli, Deputy Chief of Mission. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment and Action Requested.  We would like to be 
responsive to Ferrari Bravo's request, which she directed to 
Deputy Senior Coordinator for Iraq Robert Deutch (reftel B) 
during his courtesy call on her.  We would appreciate 
guidance on what we might tell Ferrari Bravo.  End comment 
and action requested.
