SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.   Iran's nuclear program continues to make international 
headlines, with a focus on the increased pressure from the 
international community on Iran.  One opposition paper reported on 
the role of Brazilian government as a mediator between the 
Washington and Tehran, as well as the Obama Administration's 
declaration that it "doesn't rule out any options.  In addition, 
major newspapers printed headlines about the U.S. and Pakistan 
capturing the Taliban's second-highest ranking leader.  End 
summary. 
 
 
 
BRAZILIAN INTERVENTION IN IRAN 
 
------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶2.   In an article headlined "The Iranian revenge will be 
terrible," left-of-center, opposition newspaper Critica reports 
that Brazilian President Lula da Silva will visit Iran in May to 
"look for solutions" to "avert a larger crisis" over Iran's nuclear 
program.  Critica observed that European Union and U.S. lawmakers 
welcome Brazil as a mediator, and quoted Republican Rep. Roger 
Wicker commenting that if "Brazil can persuade Iran...it is 
something good."

¶3.   Clarin, Argentina's largest circulation daily, used newswires 
from international agencies DPA and AP reporting that Russia had 
"joined" the U.S. and France in urging Iran to stop increasing its 
level of uranium enrichment.  The newswire notes that Iran's latest 
move "strengthens suspicions that Tehran wants to build nuclear 
arms" and that Iran's nuclear program is "an open defiance to the 
international community."

¶4.   Under the headline "Obama already uses the Bush rhetoric on 
Iran," conservative Ambito Financiero writes that Obama is 
considering a military option in Iran.  Ambito Financiero 
highlighted White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs' claim that 
the U.S. government "doesn't rule out any options" on Iran, and 
Iran's reluctance to engage in diplomacy is "not pursuing the goals 
[Iran] officially communicated."

¶5.   Daily La Prensa covered Brazil's intervention and Iranian 
President Ahmadinejad's reaction to "welcoming a possible Brazilian 
mediation in the conflict."  However, similar to Ambito Financiero, 
La Prensa reported that Obama is using similar rhetoric to the Bush 
Administration, quoting the President as saying "we don't rule out 
any options." 
 
 
 
TALIBAN'S SECOND-IN-COMMAND ARRESTED 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶6.   Maria Avignolo, Clarin's Paris correspondent, reported that 
U.S. and Pakistan authorities' arrest of the Taliban's "number two" 
leader, Abdul Baradar, is a "hard strike" to the Taliban, but is 
also  "surrounded by mysteries and questions."  Avignolo questions 
Pakistan's motives to arrest Baradar as possibly part of its 
"strategy to force its participation" in "secret negotiations" 
between Afghan President Karzai and the Taliban.  The article also 
notes that the U.S. labeled the arrest as a "joint operation" 
between the CIA and Pakistan, despite Pakistan's "previous public 
rejection" of these missions due to "profound anti-American 
 
sentiments crossing the country."

¶7.   Critica labeled Baradar's arrest as the "largest strike 
against the Afghan insurgency" since 2001.  However, Critica also 
cautioned that this development does not signify "the final battle" 
and observed the Taliban's "great capacity to replace leaders 
quickly," even though the arrest could "delay new operations." 
Additionally, the article noted the U.S. hope that Pakistan is 
"more available" to "deny a safe refuge to Afghan militants."

¶8.   Second-largest daily La Nacion and financial dailies Ambito 
Financiero and Buenos Aires Economico reprinted Reuters and EFE 
newswires giving an overview of the developments surrounding 
Baradar's arrest.  Newswires observed the U.S. achieving its 
"greatest success" since 2001, but also divulged comments from the 
Taliban denying Baradar's capture.  In addition, financial daily El 
Cronista reprinted an article from Britain's Financial Times noting 
that although a U.S. General said six months ago the "West could be 
destroyed in Afghanistan," Baradar's arrest "has strengthened hopes 
of rescuing the conflict."
