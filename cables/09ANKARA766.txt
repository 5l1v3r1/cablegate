¶1.  (U) Summary.  During his May 27-28 visit to Bagdad, Turkish 
Energy Minister Taner Yildiz participated in the first Regional 
Power and Energy Conference, and signed an electricity cooperation 
protocol with his counterparts from Iraq, Iran and Syria.  The 
agreement provides for the interconnection of the power grids of 
these four countries, followed by an enlargement of the connection 
to include to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.  Turkey 
will reportedly lead this effort.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Turkey's newly appointed Energy Minister Taner Yildiz visited 
Iraq on May 27-28.  In a press conference prior to his departure, 
Yildiz said he would participate in a regional energy and 
electricity ministers' meeting in Baghdad and would have bilateral 
meetings with the ministers of the participant countries.  Yildiz 
said the talks with Iraq would focus on electricity trading, 
bringing the operation of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline up to full 
capacity and cooperation in oil and gas.  The representatives of 
Calik Energy and Kartet Energy (electricity exporter to Iraq) also 
joined the trip. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Commenting on Yildiz' visit, Kartet Energy Commercial 
Director Nuray Atacik said electricity cooperation would be the 
major issue on the parties' agenda in this visit.  Atacik noted 
that, after years of delay, Turkey's State Transmission Company 
(TEIAS) had finally budgeted capacity increase in the transmission 
grid between Turkey and Iraq.  Atacik said the construction work 
would not be finalized before 2011. 
 
¶4. (U) Turkish press announced on May 29 that the electricity and 
energy ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria signed an 
Electricity Cooperation Agreement at the end of the Regional Power 
and Energy Conference.  According to the agreement, these countries 
will build a connection to each other's power networks, and, in the 
future stages of the project, will extend the connection to the 
grids of the eight Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.  The 
GCC countries include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and 
UAE.  According to the press, Turkey is the president of some type 
of coordinating council that will lead this effort. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) At this early stage, it's unclear how serious this 
initiative will be.  It does show that Turkey continues to seek 
opportunities to take a leadership role in its relations with 
neighboring countries, including Iran.
