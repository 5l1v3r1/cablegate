ASSESSMENT 
 
REF: 06 MANAGUA 1114 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reason 1.4(d) 
 
¶1. (C) Although the Nicaraguan government (GON) has in the 
past expressed a willingness to assist with limited refugee 
resettlement (reftel), post believes that because of 
ideological and public relations considerations, the recently 
installed Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) 
government of President Daniel Ortega would have no interest 
in considering such cooperation.  The FSLN is close to the 
Cuban regime.  Further, previous administrations were wary of 
admitting non-Hispanic populations (such as Haitians) and 
also concerned about the optics of assisting refugees in the 
second poorest country in the hemisphere.  The Ortega 
government would likely have the same reservations. 
 
¶2. (C) The following responses are keyed to questions posed 
in reftel: 
 
a. It is extremely unlikely that the GON would be willing to 
build a camp for migrants. 
 
b. See above response. 
 
c. It is unlikely that they would consider migrants from any 
country.  In the past, the GON was willing to consider taking 
small numbers of Cubans, who are culturally and 
linguistically familiar, but the new left-wing administration 
would almost certainly refuse. 
 
d. This stance would not likely change in a post-Fidel 
environment. 
 
e. The timing is not ideal to approach the Ortega 
administration regarding accepting migrants, a request they 
would in all probability refuse.
