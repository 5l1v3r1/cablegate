Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: QInstead of military action, Israel has opted 
to pressure Hamas via an economic blockade.  But its freedom to do 
so is liable to decrease once Barack Obama assumes the U.S. 
presidency. 
 
Intelligence affairs commentator Amit Cohen wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv: QAt such moments, HamasQs unity is revealed.  Once 
a decision has been made, no one will deviate from it.... None of 
the opponents would dare say that the decision that has been made is 
incorrect. 
 
Deputy Managing Editor and right-wing columnist Caroline B. Glick 
wrote in the conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: QEven if it 
were to sign a peace deal with Israel -Q and really meant to keep it 
-Q the deal would be a dead letter because he Palestinian people 
themselves want neither peace with Israel nor Fatah.

¶I.  "BarakQs Gamble" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (12/18): QInstead of military action, Israel 
has opted to pressure Hamas via an economic blockade.  But its 
freedom to do so is liable to decrease once Barack Obama assumes the 
U.S. presidency.  Already, international patience with the blockade 
is wearing thin, and Israel has been under increasing pressure to 
allow more goods into Gaza.  Just last week, with George Bush still 
in office, America joined the other members of the Middle East 
Quartet.... in demanding that Israel completely lift the blockade 
with regard to humanitarian goods (food, fuel, medicine, etc.). And 
if even the Bush administration, which has largely supported Israeli 
measures against Hamas, takes such an approach, Obama's 
administration can be expected to take an even harder line, arguing 
that it is wrong to punish 1.5 million Palestinians over a few 
rockets.... However, this approach is liable to strengthen those in 
Israel who favor a large-scale military operation. 
 
II.  "No Leader, No Need for Truce" 
Intelligence affairs commentator Amit Cohen wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (12/18): QWe should remember that in the past 
months, the military wing has gained in strength, and this includes 
building bunkers and acquiring arms.  They appear to believe, more 
than in the past, that they have the ability to protect the senior 
leaders against a renewal of the targeted killings.  This is the 
Hizbullah model.... At such moments, HamasQs unity is revealed. 
Once a decision has been made, no one will deviate from it.  As 
opposed to Fatah, we will never see a deviation from the 
organizationQs official line.  All the spokespersons, all the senior 
figures, adopt the decision, memorize the message sheet, and 
aggressively convey it to Arab and Palestinian public opinion.  This 
unity is also maintained in off-the-record conversations, where all 
that can be heard is that the status quo will be maintained.  None 
of the opponents would dare say that the decision that has been made 
is incorrect. 
 
III.  "Betting on a Dead Horse" 
 
Deputy Managing Editor and right-wing columnist Caroline B. Glick 
wrote in the conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (12/18): 
QFatah is a dead horse.  Even if it were to sign a peace deal with 
Israel -Q and really meant to keep it -Q the deal would be a dead 
letter because the Palestinian people themselves want neither peace 
with Israel nor Fatah.... To date, IsraelQs strategy for contending 
with FatahQs demise has been to deny it.  After Hamas renewed its 
war against Israel this week, Prime Minster Ehud Olmert, Foreign 
Minister Tzipi Livni, and Barak have all threatened to take action 
against Hamas.  But at the same time, they have sent emissaries to 
Egypt to beg Hamas to reconsider its decision.

¶2.  Iran: 
--------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: QIf [Obama] fails [in his arms-control bid], 
and the nightmare of a nuclear Iran comes true, no one will be able 
to pressure Israel. 
 
Block Quotes:

"Is Obama on the Way to Dimona?" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (12/18): QIn their campaigns, Obama and 
[Hillary] Clinton promised that arms control would once again play a 
central role in American diplomacy.  Their associates and 
supporters, some of whom are candidates for positions in the new 
administration, have repeated this message relentlessly to Israeli 
colleagues and acquaintances.... In Israel there is a public 
consensus that nuclear capability is important for the country's 
survival and shouldn't be tampered with.  There is not a single 
Israeli among the signatories of Global Zero.  The initiatives are 
not directed against Israel, but as the Obama administration takes 
shape and establishes its objectives, Israel will have to decide how 
to act. Ten years ago, Bill Clinton's administration demanded that 
Israel not raise any obstacles with respect to this treaty.  The 
prime minister at the time, Benjamin Netanyahu, acquiesced 
unenthusiastically to the pressures.  A few months later, when he 
signed the Wye agreement with the Palestinians, Netanyahu asked for 
and received from Clinton a written commitment that American moves 
toward weapons control would not harm Israel's deterrent 
capability.... During the Bush years, Israel enjoyed relative quiet 
in this realm.... Now Israeli officials are expecting that Obama 
will return to the Qfreeze treaty,Q even if not immediately.... The 
prevailing view in the Israeli establishment is that everything 
depends on what Obama achieves vis-a-vis the Iranians.  If he stops 
them before they have built a bomb, and maintains the world order 
with regard to nuclear armament, there will be more legitimacy for 
making demands of Israel.   But if he fails, and the nightmare of a 
nuclear Iran comes true, no one will be able to pressure Israel.  In 
that case, the discussion will revolve around ways to strengthen 
Israel -- not about good intentions and arms-control treaties.
