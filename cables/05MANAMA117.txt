Dear Mr. President, 
 
Please accept my sincere congratulations upon your 
inauguration as President of the United States of America.  I 
have no doubt that your second term of office will be one of 
further success, progress and prosperity for the friendly 
United States and its people. 
 
I also look forward to further strengthening of the close and 
historic links between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the United 
States during your Presidency, based on the existing ties of 
friendship, cooperation and trust.  I have no doubt that such 
continued coordination and cooperation between Bahrain and 
the United States will benefit both countries and their 
friendly peoples, as well as serving the cause of regional 
security and stability. 
 
Finally, may I congratulate you once again, and assure you of 
Bahrain's continued friendship and steadfast support for the 
United States of America. 
 
Salman Bin Hamad Al-Khalifa 
Crown Prince and Commander-in-Chief 
of the Bahrain Defence Force
