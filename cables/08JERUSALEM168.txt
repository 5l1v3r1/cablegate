     ¶B. JERUSALEM 111 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Restricted fuel deliveries were made into 
Gaza on January 31.  Municipal water authorities reported 
that at least 80 percent of the water and sewage pumps should 
be operational February 1, as an agreement was reached 
regarding fuel deliveries within Gaza.  The Gaza Power Plant 
is increasing output from 45 MW during the day to 65 MW 
during night peak hours.  Health sector professionals are 
concerned about the recent unrestricted importation of live 
animals through Rafah.  Gaza contacts conveyed disappointment 
and fear in response to the January 30 Israel High Court of 
Justice ruling that the current fuel and electricity cuts are 
legal.  End summary. 
 
Kerem Shalom Crossing Open 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) WFP contacts said that Kerem Shalom crossing was 
open January 31 for restricted humanitarian shipments, while 
Sufa crossing was closed.  Kerem Shalom had last been open on 
January 23 and Sufa on January 30. 
 
Restricted Fuel Transfers Made; 
Gas Stations Remain Closed 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Palestinian Petroleum Corporation Director in Gaza 
Mujahid Salama told Econoff that the following fuel transfers 
were made at the Nahal Oz station on January 31: 
- industrial fuel for Gaza Power Plant - 500,000 liters 
- diesel fuel - 170,000 liters 
- gasoline - 20,000 liters 
- cooking gas - 125 tons 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Salama said that most diesel fuel and gasoline 
transfers continue to be stored in his agency's facilities on 
the Gaza side of Nahal Oz, as the Gaza Petroleum and Gas 
Station Owners Association has closed Gaza gas stations and 
continues to limit fuel deliveries within Gaza. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Gaza Power Plant Project Manager Rafiq Maliha told 
Econoff on January 31 that the Plant is producing 45 MW 
during the day and 65 MW at during peak hours at night, given 
the cold weather in the region.  He confirmed that most 
Gazans continue to experience 10-12 hours without electricity 
each day. 
 
Major Fuel Delivery To Municipal Water Authority 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Gaza Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) 
chief engineer Monther Shoblak told Econoff on January 31 
that at least 80 percent of all municipal pumps should be 
operational by February 2, as the Gaza Petroleum and Gas 
Station Owners Association agreed on January 30 to deliver to 
CMWU a one-month supply of diesel fuel for its 170 pumping 
stations - roughly 150,000 liters.  Shoblak said that the 
association's fuel transport trucks had begun to haul fuel on 
January 31 from storage facilities on the Gaza side of Nahal 
Oz fuel transport station to municipality pumping stations. 
He said that the fuel delivery should take two to three work 
days and that roughly 85 percent of Gazans should have 
running water to their homes by February 2. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Shoblak noted that the 20 percent of the pumps that 
will not be operational following the fuel delivery are (1) 
missing spare parts and/or (2) dependent on electricity of 
the Gaza Power Plant, whose output continues to fluctuate 
between 45 MW and 65 MW, depending on the time of day. 
Shoblak added that with the additional fuel, he would soon be 
able to reduce the sewage flow into the sea and partially 
treat that sewage prior to entry.  Roughly 40,000 cubic 
meters of sewage has been flowing into the sea each day since 
January 22, due to the lack of functioning pumps. 
 
Unrestricted Animal Imports 
At Rafah Spur Health Concerns 
----------------------------- 
 
 
JERUSALEM 00000168  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU) WHO National Health Officer Mahmoud Daher told 
Econoff on January 31 that health concerns are rising among 
PA health officials in Gaza that the unrestricted passage of 
animals from Egypt into Gaza through the Rafah crossing 
recently has put the region's human and animal population at 
an increased risk of foot and mouth disease and avian 
influenza.  Daher noted that Egypt had reportedly experienced 
a number of cases of avian influenza last year.  Daher said 
that Gaza health sector officials met with GOI health 
officials to discuss the matter on January 30 at Erez 
crossing. 
 
Israeli High Court Ruling 
Spurs Fear Of Additional Cuts 
----------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Daher and Shoblak were focused on the January 30 
Israel High Court of Justice decision that ruled that 
Israel's reduction of power and fuel to Gaza was legal. 
Daher feared that the decision may result in even greater 
fuel cuts by GOI, while Shoblak opined that more detrimental 
actions - such as fuel cuts and electricity reductions - 
against the Gaza population would occur due to the "blessing 
of the High Court."
