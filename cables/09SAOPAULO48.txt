ADMINISTRATION FOREIGN POLICY 
 
Invisible Hand, Alert Eyes 
 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (1-23) penned by Clovis Rossi: 
"Thus ends the Reagan era, where the invisible hand of the market 
seems to be the only guide, and the Obama era begins, at least in 
rhetoric, where the invisible hand will have to live with 'alert 
eyes' that can only be the State's [eyes] - or ideally the society's 
[eyes], through the State....Obama has around two months to show his 
'alert eye', which is the deadline prior to the G-20 meeting (April 
2nd) when the issue will have to be defined." 
 
Why, Bush? 
 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (1-23) by former Brazilian 
President Jose Sarney states: "Obama is the rising sun. Bush is the 
light that switched off ....His [George. W. Bush's] reactions to the 
challenges of governing were wrong and generated mortgages for the 
world that will last for a long time....The past was a disaster: the 
heritage of two wars and the greatest crisis of the century.  But 
the American dream survived, thanks to freedom; freedom to choose, 
to realize the pursuit of happiness that [Thomas] Jefferson talked 
about - that is an example to all of us." 
 
So Help Me God 
 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (1-23) by Fernando Gabeira, 
states: "How to come down from the clouds of great expectations to 
the reality without causing frustration?....In [President Barack 
Obama's inauguration] speech, there is a choice: between security 
and our ideals, he chose both.  The next day, an action: suspend 
proceedings in Guantanamo.  Obama's success will be a thread of hope 
against the cynicism of politics."
