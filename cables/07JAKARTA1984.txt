MINISTER OF FINANCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA 
Ref. No: S-296 /MK 011/2007 
July 9, 2007 
 
H.E. Mr. Henry M. Paulson, Jr. 
Secretary of the Treasury 
 
SIPDIS 
Washington, U.S. 
 
Subject: Indonesian Minister of Finance Initiative for a High Level 
Event during the UNFCCC COP13/MOP3; Bali, 10-11 December 2007 
 
Dear Mr. Paulson, 
 
Indonesia will host the 13th Conference of Parties of the United 
Nations Framework of Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bali 
in December 2007. Earlier this year, in discussions with the UNFCCC 
Executive Secretary, Mr. Yvo de Boer, I agreed to host a high level 
event for Ministers of Finance in parallel with the Conference of 
Parties. 
 
Climate change has become one of the most important global issues 
that require effective international policy frameworks and actions. 
The effects of climate change are estimated to be most severe in the 
poorest countries of the world, creating a potentially serious 
constraint on continued development.  Developed countries also face 
serious risks from rising temperatures, changing weather patterns, 
and rising sea level. 
 
I would like to invite you to attend the High Level Event of 
Ministers of Finance on Climate Change, which will be held on 
December 11th, preceded by a meeting of Deputies on the 10th of 
December 2007. 
 
The meeting aims to initiate a discussion process among Finance 
Ministers on climate change issues. For its content and structure, I 
am proposing three discussion sessions, followed by a wrap-up 
session. During each technical session, we will ask for brief 
presentations by a developing country, a developed country, and an 
international financial institution. Participants will be asked to 
share their comments during the discussion period. The results of 
the discussion will be reported at the UNFCCC COP13/CMP3 plenary 
sessions on the following day. For further detail of the event and 
participation you may contact Mr. Anggito Abimanyu, the Head of 
Fiscal Policy Office and Indonesia's finance deputy (phone +6221 
3441484; fax +6221 3848049; anggito a() indosat.net. id; cc to 
herfan a(),.depkeu.go.id). 
 
The three sessions would focus on the Economic Magnitude and 
Consequences of Climate Change; Policy Instruments for Addressing 
Climate Change; and Common Objectives on Climate Change Finance 
Issues. A final session would discuss follow up initiatives, which 
could include regular meetings, discussions at future UNFCCC 
Conferences, or a working group to explore means for incorporating 
climate change into development financing approaches. In this 
regard, I would be delighted if you or a person from your 
institution designated by you would participate in the meeting as a 
presenter for Session 2: Policy Instruments for Addressing Climate 
Change. To ensure that the discussion on the topic is focused, we 
attach the terms of reference of the workshop. 
 
Although climate change has been discussed in previous meetings of 
the G8 and the G20, this would be the first global event where 
Ministers of Finance could focus on the tools and policies that they 
can bring to bear on climate change mitigation and adaptation 
issues. To keep the event manageable, I propose to invite the G20 
and ASEAN countries, some of Indonesia's key development partners, 
as well as the next hosts of the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC.

The major international finance institutions would also be invited, 
but the event would focus on the roles that Finance Ministries can 
play in this emerging global challenge. 
 
You and your delegation will be welcomed in Bali at a reception on 
the evening of Monday 10 December 2007 with Indonesian and 
international business and community leaders.  On the evening of 
Tuesday, 11 December 2007, we would be delighted if you could 
participate in a dinner and cultural event. 
 
I am quite enthusiastic about the potential of this event and I hope 
you will be able to participate and contribute actively to the 
discussion. I would be grateful to have a response by no later than 
July 28, 2007. Please send a reply by fax at +6221 3451205. I will 
be following up with you to consolidate these arrangements in 
upcoming meetings of APEC, G20 and at the WBG Annual Meetings in 
October in Washington, D.C. 
 
Sincerely Yours, 
(Signed)
