OFFICE STRUGGLES TO CHANGE A CULTURE OF CORRUPTION 

 

REF: SECSTATE 43557 

 

¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On June 26, Ambassador Wayne met with head of the 

Office of Anticorruption, Dr. Abel Fleitas Ortiz de Rozas to discuss 

possible increased cooperation on anti-corruption issues.  Fleitas 

highlighted his office's very active participation in international 

anti-corruption conventions, but stressed the importance of working 

bilaterally with the U.S. to combat corruption.  He described his 

office's efforts to change the current Argentine cultural tolerance 

of corruption through promoting transparency, prevention campaigns, 

improved investigations, and more efficient prosecution.  Fleitas 

had three specific requests for assistance: a series of digital 

video-conferences on cross examination/expert witnesses, attending 

the next conference of the Council on Government Ethics Law (COGEL), 

and participating in the State Department's International Visitor 

programs and other exchange programs.  Post has already facilitated 

contact with COGEL and will work with the Office of Government 

Ethics in Washington to facilitate the DVC series, as well as 

consider OA staff for IV programs. END SUMMARY. 

 

¶2. (SBU)  On June 26, Ambassador Wayne and emboffs met with head of 

the Office of Anticorruption (OA), Dr. Abel Fleitas Ortiz de Rozas. 

(See SEPTEL for background of the Anticorruption Office.)  Fleitas 

opened by describing some of the challenges Argentina faces in its 

fight against corruption: a general public tolerance of corruption, 

the lack of a culture of transparency, and a slow and cumbersome 

legal system that hinders his office's ability to successfully 

prosecute cases.  He mentioned that, while his office has brought 

many cases to trial, there are far fewer convictions.  Fleitas 

requested USG assistance in strengthening the OA's skills in oral 

arguments, particularly related to cross-examination and their use 

of expert witness testimony.  He was interested in Ambassador 

Wayne's offer to facilitate a series of digital video conferences 

with our Department of Justice on the topic. 

 

¶3. (SBU)  Fleitas highlighted his office's very active participation 

in international anti-corruption conventions.  He mentioned 

Argentina's participation in the Conference of State Parties (COSP) 

related to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), 

the Mechanism for Follow-up on the Implementation of the 

Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (MESICIC), and the 

OECD's Anti-bribery convention.  He cited Argentina's participation, 

along with the USG, in the pilot evaluation program of the UNCAC. 

He expressed appreciation for the USG's leadership role in promoting 

these conventions and gratitude for our recent offer of assistance 

with the UNCAC checklist (REFTEL). 

 

¶4. (SBU)  Ortiz de Rozas also discussed the OA's efforts to change 

the current Argentine cultural tolerance of corruption through 

promoting transparency, prevention campaigns, improved 

investigations, and more efficient prosecution.  He expressed 

admiration for what he called the U.S. culture of transparency and 

its history of whistleblowers, and discussed a few recent projects 

to raise awareness of the problems of corruption.  Fleitas expressed 

interest in attending the annual conference of the Council on 

Government Ethics Law (COGEL), which includes as a member the U.S. 

Government Office of Government Ethics - a long-time partner of the 

OA.  He also expressed interest in how participation in 

international exchanges and visitor programs might help improve the 

expertise of his staff. 

 

¶5.  (SBU)  Post has already facilitated contact with COGEL for the 

OA and passed the conference registration form and schedule to 

Fleitas's office.  Post plans to work with the Office of Government 

Ethics in Washington to facilitate the DVC series, which may involve 

some coordination with the Department of Justice.  Post will work 

with the LEGATT to identify appropriate experts on oral proceedings. 

 Post will also continue to consider OA staff for IV programs and 

other professional exchanges.
