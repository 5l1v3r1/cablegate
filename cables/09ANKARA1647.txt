Media Highlights: Nuclear Plant Bid By Russians Suspended; New 
Tenders in 2010;  FM Davutoglu Angered by Environment

New Nuclear Power Plant Tenders Expected in 2010 
Mainstream newspapers Milliyet, Vatan, Hurriyet and Sabah predict 
that the lone bid by a Russian joint partnership to build a nuclear 
power plant in Turkey will be cancelled.  According to 
Islamic-oriented Yeni Safak and mainstream Sabah,  the government 
plans to hold twin tenders for the construction of nuclear plants in 
Akkuyu and Sinop in 2010.   Media report that  Energy Minister Taner 
Yildiz reasoned that because of a court case ruling by the Council 
of State against the methodology used in the nuclear plant tender, 
"the government cannot remain indifferent."  Media also report that 
Yildiz talked about new nuclear tender arrangements that experts in 
the field interpreted as indicating the annulment of the current 
nuclear plant tender.  Sabah notes that The Russian 
Atomstroyexport-Inter Rao and Turkish Park Teknik joint venture was 
the only bidder for the last tender and the validity of that bid 
expires on November 24. 
 
Blockage of EU Environment Chapter Angers FM Davutoglu; French ME 
Conference Proposal Noted 
Hurriyet-Daily News editor Serkan Demirtas quotes FM Davutoglu from 
Madrid as saying that "We are faced with a political blockage from 
some countries on the opening of the environment chapter.  Trying to 
block the process for political reasons is unfair.  We are talking 
about cooperating on the energy security of Europe but we cannot 
open the chapter on energy because of the Greek Cypriot veto.  It is 
not understandable.  We are criticized by the Europeans for not 
being fast enough, but is it because of us or them?  In the 
beginning of the negotiation process, we were told that the chapter 
on environment was one of the hardest to open.  But we fulfilled the 
opening criteria in less than a few months time.  Instead of 
encouraging us, they indirectly discouraged us." 
 
In a related story, Sabah reports that in Madrid, Davutoglu welcomed 
a French proposal for having a Middle East conference in Paris by 
saying "Turkey supports all good will initiatives.  We support 
Obama's Middle East policies.  If France has this kind of 
initiative, we'll support that also."  Intellectual- 
Islamist-oriented Zaman says that Davutoglu warned France, whose 
plans include a Middle East conference without Turkey, by saying 
"Initiatives without a strong infrastructure and without the support 
of all parties, can cause disappointment." 
 
"Obama to China: Uncensored Society is Healthy." (Hurriyet Daily 
News)  Media outlets highlight the positive messages President Obama 
gave to the world during his first visit to China.  In "Here's 
ObaMAO," mainstream Milliyet emphasizes President Obama's popularity 
in China.  Islamist-oriented Zaman headline reads, "Obama Gave Warm 
Messages to Chinese Students: We're Not Enemies,"  and notes, 
"President Obama told Chinese students in a town hall meeting with 
Chinese students that US and China have positive, constructive and 
comprehensive relations."  Mainstream Hurriyet carries the headline, 
"While Obama Says He Is Against Censorship, China Censors Him," and 
notes, "President Obama pointed out the importance of unlimited 
access to information and called for Internet freedom during a 
meeting with Chinese students.  However, the meeting was not 
broadcast live on national TV across China." Leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet writes "Obama Talked About Rights, Didn't Touch On 
Tibet," saying, "Obama used the forum to champion Internet freedom 
and human rights on the first day of his trip but he did not mention 
China's Tibet policy.  It could have created tension ahead of his 
talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing." 
 
CHP Oymen Debate 
Turkish media provide extensive newspaper coverage of a debate 
 
ANKARA 00001647  002 OF 003 
 
 
within the CHP, the main opposition party, as some members campaign 
against Onur Oymen following his remarks in the parliament last week 
that hurt Alevi as well as Kurdish feelings.  Reactions to his 
rhetoric also dominate the opinion columns.  From mainstream media 
to the Islamists, the opinion makers mostly agreed that "the 
rhetoric was wrong" and some called on him to resign.  In mainstream 
Hurriyet, Sedat Ergin does not agree with Oymen's self defense: 
"Oymen should stop comparing apples and oranges.  There is credible 
evidence that the event he referred to was a massacre."  Similarly, 
mainstream Sabah's Nazli Ilicak finds the rehoric "totally 
unacceptable" and calls CHP's Oymen "to resign immediately." 
 
Tamer Korkmaz and Fehmi Koru, two columnists in Islamist Yeni Safak 
both think that "the recent incident is not unique and actually 
shows CHP's true colors." 
 
However, in mainstream Milliyet, Melih Asik thinks differently: 
"Oymen was trying to point out a historic fact that Turkey has never 
thought of negotiating with insurgents even in the most difficult 
circumstances."  Similarly, Milliyet's Fikret Bila quotes CHP leader 
Baykal as saying he thinks "Oymen was misunderstood" because "he was 
talking about a methodology." 
 
Human Rights Department Will be Replaced by New Body 
Hurriyet reports that the government is preparing to establish an 
independent Human Rights Institution.  The Human Rights Institution, 
as an autonomous 11- member body, will replace the Human Rights 
Department, which has been inactive for long time.  The 11 board 
members will be elected from among academics, civil activists and 
members of various related institutions.  The new institution will 
be authorized to file complaints with prosecutors and to file 
objections to court rulings dismissing allegations of human rights 
violations.  The EU had pressed Turkey, according to reports, to set 
up an  independent and autonomous body, not affiliated with the 
government.. 
 
USS Bataan Docks in Izmir 
Sabah and Milliyet as well as Izmir's regional outlet Yeni Asir 
report that one of the US' biggest helicopter and amphibian attack 
vessels, the USS Bataan, docked in Izmir harbor yesterday morning. 
The articles say that the vessel is returning home from Iraq and 
Afghanistan and stopped for the soldiers to relax.  They all 
highlight the economic impact for stores in the area and Milliyet 
notes that the three day stay of the vessel will contribute three 
million dollars to Izmir's economy.  Milliyet also notes that 
security measures increased in Izmir for the visit.
