  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  AFGHAN ELECTION 
 
"Afghanistan: election goes beyond win-lose battle (pg 5)" 
 
The official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (Zhongguo 
Qingnianbao)(08/21): "Since President Obama became the U.S. 
President, in spite of the U.S. sending more troops to Afghanistan, 
Afghanistan's security situation has not improved.  The effect that 
President Obama expected his new anti-terror policy to have has not 
emerged.  The election does not mean democracy.  Democracy is seldom 
achieved through military intervention.  The U.S. doesn't have a 
great track record of 'sponsoring democracy'.   Regarding its role 
in North Korea, Viet Nam, Cuba and many other African and Latin 
American countries after the Cold War, the U.S. has not always stood 
on the side of democracy and progress.  To us, the U.S.'s sincerity 
and commitment to Afghanistan's democracy and prosperity is a big 
question mark." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS 
 
"'Industrial damage' does not exist in the 'tire special protection 
case' (pg 10) 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(08/21): "It is 
said that imports of tires from China will damage the U.S. domestic 
tire industry.  However, it seems that only the United Steel workers 
advocate imposing tough sanctions against Chinese tires, and most 
U.S. business representatives oppose the sanctions.  In fact, 
imported tires from China are in different markets than domestic 
American tires.  China's tires imports have nothing to do with 
'industrial damage.'  The U.S. special protection measures on tires 
won't help decrease the imports of tires.  Since consumers in the 
third-class tire replacement market, which is the main market for 
imported tires from China, are very price-sensitive and usually buy 
imported products from developing countries.  The growth of China's 
tire imports to the U.S. is a result of transnational restructuring 
and a shift in its tire industry.  The U.S. should use technical 
training for a smooth labor transfer." 
 
¶3. AMERICAN NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY 
 
"The American National Endowment for Democracy (NED) provides 
financial aid to 50 China-related projects (pg 7)" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/31): "The American National Endowment for 
Democracy (NED) has influenced all the incidents such as the 'March 
14' incident in Tibet last year, the 'July 5' incident in Urumqi 
this year and the conflicts happening during Iran's election. 
Analysts found out that there are as many as 50 China-related 
projects receiving financial aid from the organization.  In recent 
years, the organization's ability to conduct 'color revolutions' has 
caused serious social chaos. It is not a good thing that the 
organization is paying close attention to China.  Separatists' 
organizations like 'Tibet independence' and 'Xinjiang independence' 
are favorites for NED support.  The NED likes to emphasize its 
'non-governmental' role to the people, but knowing its source of 
money and organizational structure, one would realize that the NED 
is an American government department under the cover of being 
non-governmental. It advocates promoting American-style democracy in 
a disguised way.  The U.S. congress' grant to the organization has 
continuously increased in recent years.  A Chinese expert who is 
familiar with how the organization runs said that the NED would 
consider whether the project suits the U.S. national interests, if 
not, it is difficult to get a penny from the NED."
