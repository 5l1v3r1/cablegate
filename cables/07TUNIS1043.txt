 ¶1. (SBU) Post can not report at this time if the Head of 
State (HOS) or Head of Government (HOG) will attend UNGA, or 
if the HOS/HOG will be in New York on September 24.  On July 
23, Post sent a diplomatic note requesting information on the 
Tunisian delegation to the 62nd UNGA meetings.  On July 25, 
Ambassador followed up with MFA Chief of Staff Hatem Atallah. 
 Atallah said that he had seen Post's diplomatic note, but 
that the GOT had not yet decided who will attend UNGA. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The GOT usually decides and announces who 
will attend only days before UNGA.  Traditionally, it is the 
Tunisian Foreign Minister that attends UNGA.  Given that, it 
is unlikely that the spouse of the GOT's HOS/HOG would be in 
New York for an event with Mrs. Bush.  Post will continue to 
press for a response and report any additional information 
septel.  End Comment.
