SUBJECT: Media Reaction Rio de Janeiro: May the climate remain good 
in Denmark (COP 15) 
 
May the climate remain good in Denmark 
 
 
 
Center-left, Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper O Globo writes, "...The 
global summit, expected to be the new landmark [event] to stop 
global warming...gained new momentum with the recent announcement 
of China and the United States, stipulating cuts in their 
greenhouse gas emissions. The Summit, reborn from the ashes, could 
be promising. The Chinese and the Americans, the world's two most 
polluting nations...finally bowed to international pressure. First, 
came the surprising announcement of the United States to cut its 
emissions by 17% by 2020, in relation to 2005 levels. Not that it 
was an aggressive percentage, but it showed that the country is 
willing to collaborate and emerge from its situation of paralysis. 
This is merely the expected role of a nation which wants to keep 
its position as a leader of global governance... One cannot 
downplay the role Brazil played in the final step in the 
preparation process for the COP-15 summit. All signs pointed to a 
frustrating summit and the main players directly involved in the 
conference were expecting that a new climate agreement would only 
be possible in future summits, in one or two years. This was the 
case until Brazil dropped the first piece, triggering a domino 
effect, followed by the U.S. and China's announcements. The 
initiative put an end to the finger-pointing seen in meetings 
previous to the COP-15... excited by the support and envisioning 
the opportunity to turn the country [Brazil] into a relevant player 
in environmental issues, the GOB threatened to go further and lead 
an international effort to pressure China and the U.S. This was not 
necessary. May this climate of cooperation continue in Denmark 
until the 18th [of December]" (Dec 7, page A10).
