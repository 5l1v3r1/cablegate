DESCRIBE INDUSTRY DIFFICULTIES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 50181 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel request, on October 13, Consulate General 
E/P Chief presented the U.S. Coast Guard's Automated 
Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue (AMVER) awards to 
participating Hong Kong-based ship companies.  The event, 
which was covered by shipping trade press, publicly 
recognized AMVER participating companies for advancing 
worldwide maritime safety and for participating in vessel 
search and rescue operations on the high seas.  Hosted by the 
Hong Kong Ship Owners Association, the event drew over 60 
members from Hong Kong's maritime industry. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The awards were presented against a backdrop of 
continuing operational and financial difficulties for Hong 
Kong's maritime industry.  Container traffic through Hong 
Kong fell more than 20 percent in September YOY.  Maritime 
leaders here criticize the Hong Kong Government's lack of 
support for the industry which, combined with the logistics 
sector, employs 18 percent of Hong Kong's population. 
Industry press have been reporting that increasing numbers of 
companies are leaving Hong Kong for Singapore. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ship owners, managers, financiers, lawyers, 
builders, insurers, and suppliers all described to us the 
difficulties faced by Hong Kong's maritime industry as a 
result of the drop in regional exports to the U.S. and 
Europe.  Ship owners complain that banks' overly conservative 
credit conditions continue to pose difficulties for their 
shipping operations.  The lack of liquidity remains the 
industry's biggest challenge, forcing many to sell their 
vessels at a loss or to "send them to the scrap yard" to cut 
operating expenses.  In some cases, banks have gone after 
ships of loan-delinquent owners.  Currently, six Russian 
cargo ships are being held in Hong Kong waters on behalf of 
DVB Bank which is owed a total of $20 million by 
Vladivostok-based ST Shipmanagement.  Lloyd's List East Asia 
Editor Keith Wallis told us that, without a recovery in cargo 
exports to the West, such seizures are likely to be the tip 
of the iceberg.
