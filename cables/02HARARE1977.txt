SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PRESS STILL INDIGNANT 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "We stand by our cause" the 
      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its 
      August 27 editorial to criticizing the United States 
      for meddling in Zimbabwe's internal affairs. 
      Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "The American and their cousins in Europe have 
      perfected the art of seeking to protect their 
      interests through interference in the affairs of 
      sovereign states.  Moreover, where they seem to 
      be failing, they always try to divide the people 
      along ethnic lines in order to find means of 
      achieving their ends. . .  It is sad that 
      Americans, who have long touted themselves as 
      the paragons of democracy, should be engaging in 
      nefarious activities that only despots would 
      fathom.  News that America is fantasizing about 
      removing President Mugabe - the people's choice 
      - violently from power in cahoots with some 
      supposedly lily-livered states with whom 
      Zimbabwe shares a border, made interesting 
      reading.  As expected those countries that were 
      named as party to the conspiracy. . .have 
      distanced themselves from the American madness. 
      . .  We will not brook any nonsense from Uncle 
      Toms et al who think they know it all. 
      Zimbabweans have a right to decide their 
      destiny, and we demand that right!
