SUBJECT: 62ND UNGA ADOPTS THE REPORT OF THE GENERAL 
COMMITTEE 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 131494

     ¶C. SECSTATE 128329 
 
1.(U) The UN General Committee (GC) met September 19 to 
inscribe items on the agenda of the 62nd UNGA, which opened 
September 18, and to allocate them to the Main Committees or 
Plenary.  The UNGA plenary will meet September 21 to consider 
the General Committee's Report.  With the exception of two 
items, the process of inscription and allocation was 
non-controversial.  As anticipated (ref A), the most heated 
discussion focused on whether to inscribe an item pertaining 
to UN membership for Taiwan(ref B).  Following a vote to 
limit debate to four speakers (24(U.S.)-3-0), the General 
Committee decided not to inscribe that item, but Taiwan 
supporters are likely to reopen the issue in the Plenary. 
 
¶2. (U)  Human Rights Council:  The General Committee of the 
General Assembly decided by consensus to defer a decision on 
whether to allocate consideration of the Report of the Human 
Rights Council to the plenary or the Third Committee.  USUN 
spoke in favor of allocation to the Third Committee (ref C), 
and Egypt, speaking on behalf of Africa, made a strong 
statement along the same lines.  Six other African states 
concurred in statements of their own:  Mauritius, Botswana, 
DRC, Sudan, Gambia, and Senegal.  Russia also supported this 
view.  Iceland, Finland, Cyprus, the UK, France, and Uruguay, 
however, spoke in favor of deferring the decision to allow 
for further discussion.  The GA President will now consult 
with delegations to try to reach an agreement on the 
allocation.  No date was set for further consideration of the 
matter.  Last year, the allocation was deferred for a month, 
until late October, but the report was ultimately allocated 
to the Third Committee.
