SUBJECT:  SWEDISH PARLIAMENT APPROVES TROOP EXTENSION IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: STOCKHOLM 629 
 
On November 19, the Swedish Parliament approved the annual Defense 
Bill to extend Sweden's troop deployment to ISAF through December 
Â¶2010.  The 2010 Defense Bill allows for a permanent presence of 500 
troops, with a surge capacity of 855 in times of crisis.  Around 450 
Swedish troops are presently part of the contingent based in 
Mazar-e-Sharif.  MFA and Ministry of Defense sources tell us the 
troop level will increase to 500 in coming months (reftel).  The 
legislation also states that Sweden will increase its training 
commitments to Afghanistan, and last week, 22 Swedish officers and 
16 soldiers were scheduled to deploy to form a new OMLT to support 
the 2nd ANA Infantry Battalion in Shibarghan, 100 kilometers west of 
Mazar-e-Sharif.  The new Swedish team will advise at the battalion 
level, which means that Swedish troops will be integrated into units 
actively seeking out insurgents.  This OMLT will supplement the two 
existing Swedish OMLTs operating at corps and brigade levels.
