SUBJECT: GOVERNOR AGAR STRIKES PESSIMISTIC TONE IN MEETING WITH 
ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION COMMISSION 
 
Ref:  Khartoum 1137 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In an October 14 meeting with members of the 
Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC), Malik Agar (SPLM), 
Governor of Blue Nile State, said that increasing numbers of Sudan 
Armed Forces (SAF) and the continued presence of Other Armed Groups 
(OAGs) in his state raise security concerns; emphasized the 
importance of elections for the much-anticipated popular 
consultations in his state, but stated that the 2010 elections were 
"already rigged".  He decried what he termed the failure by the 
Government of Sudan (GoS) to release funds owed to the state.  At a 
follow-on meeting, Ahmed Kermino (NCP), Blue Nile's Deputy Governor, 
told the AEC that Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) forces 
remained in Blue Nile in violation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement (CPA), and that their presence would prevent free and fair 
elections from being held in some parts of Blue Nile.  The 
noticeable lack of partnership between Agar, a practical moderate in 
the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and the Deputy 
Governor is troubling, and contrasts with the effective partnership 
between the Governor and Deputy Governor in South Kordofan State 
(Ref).  End Summary 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SAF INCREASING, BUT BLUE NILE REMAINS PEACEFUL 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. (SBU) In an October 14 meeting with members of the AEC, Malik 
Agar, Governor of Blue Nile State told the group that there have 
been no significant, violent incidents in Blue Nile State.  This 
important point was repeated by a number of other officials that the 
Working Group met in Blue Nile, including Deputy Governor Ahmed 
Kermino, Joint Integrated Units (JIU) commanders, and 
representatives of the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS). 
Agar also noted that he did not expect violence to affect elections 
in Blue Nile. 
 
¶3. (SBU) However, Agar did express concerns over security, 
particularly the increasing number of SAF forces and the continued 
presence of OAGs within the state.  Regarding SAF forces, Agar said 
that, while the CPA calls for the reduction in armed forces to 
pre-war levels, in fact SAF forces in Blue Nile are both increasing 
in number and mechanizing.  Note: In e-mail correspondence with 
PolOff on October 18, Svetlana Pencheva and Sheeza Jones, United 
Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) Civil Affairs Officers for the 
cities of Ed Damazine and Kurmuk, respectively, confirmed that SAF 
forces are deploying or redeploying in Blue Nile.  They also noted 
that SAF is entitled to deploy forces in northern states, including 
Blue Nile, and it is unclear to what extent SAF forces are 
increasing versus shifting locations.  End Note. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Regarding OAGs, which, pursuant to the CPA, should be 
demobilized or integrated into conventional forces, Agar noted the 
existence in Blue Nile of Popular Defense Forces, Mobile Defense 
Forces, and Popular Police, each of which he said is  affiliated 
with the SAF, but  not officially part of military or civilian 
commander structures.  Deputy Governor Kermino confirmed the 
existence of these forces, but claimed that they were paid by, and 
took their orders from, the SAF or the police, and were therefore 
part of the latter or former. .  Kermino added that no security 
violations by these forces have been reported. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Agar noted that while the SPLM is not comfortable with the 
security situation in Blue Nile, contrary to what some have claimed, 
neither Blue Nile nor South Kordofan will be the catalyst for a war 
in Sudan.  Agar said that the people of Blue Nile and South Kordofan 
recognize that southern Sudan will not support a war that might 
jeopardize its right to a referendum.  He noted, however, that if 
the referendum is blocked, "there will be a total war in Sudan, and 
Sudan will disintegrate". 
 
------------------------------------- 
DDR PROCESS CORRUPT AND JIUS "USELESS" 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Regarding the JIUs in Blue Nile, Agar raised commonly heard 
concerns regarding all JIUs in Sudan; the JIUs do not conduct joint 
training, nor are the SAF and SPLA components integrated in any 
manner.  He said that in fact the JIUs are useless at best, and at 
worst they are dangerous civilians with weapons. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Agar raised allegations of corruption in the Disarmament, 
Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) process in Blue Nile.  He 
said that the commanders responsible for selecting the former 
combatants for DDR are from Khartoum, not Blue Nile, and due either 
to ignorance or corruption, these commanders selected people from 
 
KHARTOUM 00001182  002 OF 003 
 
 
Khartoum for DDR in Blue Nile.  Note:  While the UN oversees DDR and 
distributes benefit packages to DDR participants, SAF and SPLA 
commanders select the former combatants who are eligible for DDR, 
creating a significant potential for abuse.  It is also possible, 
however, that internally displaced persons from Blue Nile, but 
living in Khartoum, were selected for DDR. End Note.

DEPUTY GOVERNOR SAYS SPLA PRESENCE VIOLATES CPA 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶8. (SBU) In Deputy Governor Kermino's meeting with the AEC he 
expressed concern regarding SPLA forces in Blue Nile.  Kermino said 
that, in violation of the CPA, there were still significant SPLA 
forces in Blue Nile State, even in towns not controlled by the SPLA 
during the civil war.  In Kurmuk, for instance, Kermino said that 
the SPLA controls the entry and exit of private citizens.  Note: In 
a meeting with the AEC on October 14, Colonel Imran, Acting UNMIS 
Commander for Sector V, noted that while redeployment of SPLA forces 
out of Blue Nile is progressing, there are still SPLA forces there. 
The process of redeployment is complicated because SPLA fighters 
often have homes and families in Blue Nile, and come and go 
regularly, sometimes armed.  Further, the border between Blue Nile 
State and Upper Nile State is not yet demarcated, allowing for 
further disputes as to whether SPLA forces are actually in Blue Nile 
State in violation of the CPA.  End Note. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
ELECTIONS KEY PREREQUISITE TO POPULAR CONSULTATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Agar said the fate of Blue Nile State is dependent on 
popular consultations, and that its people are therefore keen on 
elections, as popular consultations require an elected parliament in 
the state.  Agar stated that the census results are rigged, and that 
if this is not resolved, there will not be elections as no party 
will choose to join pre-rigged elections.  He also stated that the 
security law needs to be addressed for there to be free and fair 
elections.  Agar repeated the SPLM position that popular 
consultations are a national issue and require a binding law be 
passed by the current session of the National Assembly.  In response 
to a question as to what the popular consultations are in fact, he 
said that legally the language is unclear, but that it is a process 
that will determine the aspirations of the people.  He added that 
these aspirations could give rise to political and constitutional 
rights.  Agar raised, and left unanswered, the question of what 
happens to popular consultations if there are no elections.  In 
private remarks at the end of the meeting, in response to a 
statement that he would make a good President of Sudan, Agar 
dismissed elections in 2010 as already rigged, and suggested he 
might run in 2015. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Deputy Governor Kermino was also pessimistic about 
elections in Blue Nile, but for different reasons.  He said that 
certain regions of Blue Nile State, including Kurmuk County and 
western Bau County, would be unable to hold free elections because 
SPLA forces control these regions and arrest any non-SPLM member 
conducting election activity there.  Regarding popular 
consultations, Kermino repeated the National Congress Party (NCP) 
position that there is no need for a national law regarding popular 
consultations, and said that the SPLM is talking about popular 
consultations too early.  Kermino maintained that the NCP wants to 
follow the CPA, noting that the CPA says nothing about a national 
law governing the popular consultation process. He concluded that 
the results of the process should be referred to the Presidency. 
Note: In fact, the CPA says very little about popular consultations, 
including nothing about a national law governing the process or 
referring the results of the process to the Presidency.  End Note. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
DEVELOPMENT IN BLUE NILE OBSCURE OR NON-EXISTENT 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Agar said that in Ed Damazine, the capital of Blue Nile 
State, it is difficult to see any peace dividends, while outside the 
capital there are none at all.  Agar blamed the GoS for the lack of 
progress, stating that the GoS has not released the development 
funds owed to Blue Nile State.  Agar stated that any development 
work in his state is being done by NGOs, adding that this is an 
embarrassment for Sudan, as NGOs should be filling gaps, not 
providing basic services.  Agar noted that when the NGOs were 
expelled in March, work on their projects simply stopped, but that 
some work has recently restarted.  Regarding peace dividends, 
Kermino noted that an all-weather road now connects Ed Damazine to 
Kurmuk.  Kermino acknowledged that international donors played a 
 
KHARTOUM 00001182  003 OF 003 
 
 
large part in this achievement, but also stated that donors had not 
fully implemented their role in development, while Khartoum's 
ability to aid Blue Nile is limited by the world financial crisis. 
 
¶12. (SBU) Comment: Governor Agar is generally seen as a fairly 
practical leader in the SPLM, so his apparent pessimism regarding 
elections and hardening stance toward the NCP are troubling. 
Despite Agar's leaving unanswered the question of how popular 
consultations can go forward without valid elections, it seems 
likely that he has considered this question and come up with his own 
ideas, given his dismissal of elections in 2010 as already rigged. 
It is also unfortunate that the Governor and Deputy Governor appear 
to have separate agendas, and lack the effective partnership likely 
needed to deal with the variety of issues facing Blue Nile State in 
the next two years.  End Comment.
