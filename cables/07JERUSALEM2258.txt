SUBJECT: FRENCH BEGIN PLANNING FOR PALESTINIAN DONORS' 
CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Pierre Duquesne, a former French 
representative to the IMF, is leading French efforts to 
coordinate planning for the December donors' conference in 
Paris.  Duquesne told the Consul General in Jerusalem on 
October 25 that the Palestinian Authority has agreed to hold 
the conference on December 17, provided the timing for the 
Annapolis meeting did not slip.  He delivered a concept paper 
and a potential list of participants to the Palestinian 
Authority and established a local steering committee in 
conjunction with the Ministry of Planning, the office of the 
Quartet Representative, and the World Bank.  The Consul 
General emphasized that the overall objective of December is 
to demonstrate international political and tangible financial 
support for the Palestinian government, and therefore the 
French effort needs to be closely coordinated with the office 
of Prime Minister Fayyad.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Former French representative to the IMF, Ambassador 
Pierre Duquesne, was in Jerusalem and Ramallah the week of 
October 22, in order to plan for the December donors' 
conference in Paris in support of the Palestinian Authority 
(PA).  Duquesne was joined by Jean-Christophe Peaucelle, MFA 
Deputy Director for Economic and Financial Affairs, and 
Valerie Montane, Regional Economic Counselor from the French 
Mission in Beirut.  The three called on the Consul General on 
Thursday, October 25 in Jerusalem. 
 
December 17 in Paris: 
Following Annapolis and a PA Reform Plan 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Duquesne said that he has agreed with the PA on a 
date for the conference - December 17 - provided that the 
U.S.-hosted Annapolis meeting did not slide into the second 
week of December, in which case the French will look at a 
mid-January fallback date.  Duquesne said that while he does 
not want the Paris conference "to link to the content of 
Annapolis," he thinks the U.S.-sponsored meeting is important 
to build momentum for a successful donor event.  He said that 
President Sarkozy will open the meeting, and stay for a short 
period, but will not participate at the same level that 
former President Chirac did when the French hosted the 
Lebanon donors' conference last year.  He expects Foreign 
Minister Kouchner to chair the bulk of the meeting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The French have given the PA a short concept paper 
that includes a potential list of invitees (which Duquesne 
described as "more than 70 countries and organizations, 
including all the Arabs").  While he admitted that the list 
is "too long on paper," the French believe it is politically 
necessary to invite a broad range of participants.  The 
French, with representatives of Quartet Representative Blair, 
the Ministry of Planning and the Norwegians have established 
a small local steering committee to meet regularly in advance 
of the donors' conference.  The French expect the PA to 
produce a first draft of their reform and development plan by 
mid-November, which Blair and the Norwegians would then take 
on the road to sell to donors prior to the conference. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Consul General told Duquesne that the overall 
goal of the conference is a demonstration of tangible 
international financial support to the Palestinian Authority, 
and in particular to the government of PM Fayyad.  Therefore, 
it is critical that the French remain in close contact with 
the PM and, most importantly, ensure PA ownership of the plan 
put forward to donors. 
 
Next Step: Washington Consults 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) Duquesne believes the World Bank and IMF should 
"informally endorse" the PA's multi-year expenditure 
framework prior to the donor event, as a means of warding off 
substantive discussion in Paris on the details of the plan. 
He admits this will be difficult, given that the PA is not a 
member state of either institution.  (Note: Local World Bank 
staff privately tell ConGen officers that they believe such 
an endorsement is unnecessary and will be hard to get. End 
Note.)  Duquesne said that he would go to Washington in early 
November to discuss this idea with the Bank and the Fund, but 
also would reach out to the Department to set up appropriate 
meetings.

¶7. (SBU) Duquesne is also looking to establish a follow-up 
mechanism to the donors' conference to ensure that both donor 
commitments are PA reform obligations are met.  He suggested 
that there might be role for Blair in this follow-up.  He 
also sought PA support for a private sector component to the 
conference, but was unsuccessful.  PM Fayyad subsequently 
told the Consul General he does not support inclusion of 
private sector representatives in Paris in December, and 
instead suggested a stand-alone private sector event in the 
spring. (Comment: Follow-up to Paris will be important, but 
existing donor structures - such as the AHLC - and Quartet 
Representative Blair should be able to accomplish this 
without new mechanisms.)
