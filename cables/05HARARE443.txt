(U) As requested, this is an update to post,s submission for 
the annual anti-trafficking in persons report.  Question 
numbers are keyed to the original numbers in ref A. 
 
Question 1B:  The lead Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officer 
responsible for trafficking in persons told post he does not 
currently receive all reports of anti-migrant smuggling 
efforts.  He noted that these efforts are largely 
de-centralized and handled by local officials.  Each migrant 
present illegally and each suspected migrant smuggler or 
trafficker is dealt with on a case-by-case basis by the local 
law enforcement and prosecutors. 
 
2C:  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told post that they have 
suggested to the ZRP that it draft a consular advisory to 
send to Zimbabwean embassies abroad.  The MFA said it was 
within the ZRP,s purview to draft such notices.  ZRP 
officials with whom we spoke said they are considering the 
request but have not yet taken action. 
 
3G:  The Attorney General,s office has made no additional 
progress at this time in developing an education program for 
prosecutors and judges.  We will continue to monitor the 
program,s development. 
 
2I:  The ZRP lead TIP officer said that there have been no 
additional meetings on the regional anti-TIP action plan in 
the past month.  However, he noted that other countries in 
the region had agreed that Zimbabwe should take a leadership 
role on this issue and to that end the ZRP plans to host the 
next regional meeting sometime shortly after the country,s 
March 31 parliamentary elections.
