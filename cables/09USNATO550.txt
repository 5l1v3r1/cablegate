¶1. (SBU) On November 24, NATO Secretary General Rasmussen 
provided us with a copy of a letter to the Secretary 
regarding NATO's December 3-4 Foreign Ministerial (letter 
e-mailed to EUR/RPM).  The text of the Secretary General's 
letter to the Secretary follows: 
 
BEGIN TEXT 
 
SG(2009)0932 
 
24 November 2009 
 
 
Dear Madam Secretary, 
 
At the upcoming NATO Foreign Ministers' meeting in Brussels 
on Thursday 3 and Friday 4 December I propose that we focus 
our attention on a limited number of topics: first and 
foremost Afghanistan, but also Open Door issues, relations 
with Russia, Missile Defence, and NATO's new Strategic 
Concept. 
 
The main topic of the meeting will be Afghanistan ) with our 
NAC in ISAF Format on Friday 4 December as our principal 
forum for discussing the issue.  In light of the unique 
circumstances, including the ongoing formation of a new 
Afghan government and our discussion of strategy and 
resources, this meeting will include ISAF troop contributing 
nations to facilitate open and frank discussion. 
 
Since the submission of COMISAF's recommendations, broad 
agreement has emerged in favour of General McChrystal's 
approach.  It is now time to provide the necessary resources 
to carry it out.  I have written to the Heads of State and 
Government of all ISAF contributors, and I encourage nations 
to consider additional manoeuvre forces and trainers in 
advance of our meeting and the Force Generation conference at 
SHAPE on 7 December.  Our results will send a signal about 
NATO's commitment in Afghanistan and about transatlantic 
solidarity and the balance within our Alliance. 
 
The ministerial also presents an opportunity to deliver a 
clear message to the Afghan government that our shared 
success and transition to Afghan leadership will depend on 
improved Afghan performance, especially with regard to 
governance.  We must hold the Afghan government to account. 
Our long-term commitment cannot be in doubt, and new civilian 
resources will be needed as well, as part of a 
better-structured international engagement.  Among other 
goals, our civilian and military engagement should support 
Afghan-led efforts at reconciliation and reintegration. 
 
Our Ministerial will open on 3 December with a Working Lunch 
to discuss Open Door issues, in particular regarding the MAP 
applications we received from Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
Montenegro.  We will decide on whether to extend invitations 
to either or both of these countries to join the Membership 
Action Plan. 
 
Following this Working Lunch, we will hold a meeting of the 
NATO-Ukraine Commission to discuss progress in the 
implementation of Ukraine's Annual National Programme for 
2009 and questions of regional security. 
 
We will then hold a meeting of the NATO-Georgia Commission to 
discuss the evolving security situation on the ground in 
Georgia and Allies' assessment of Georgia's implementation of 
its first Annual National Programme. 
 
 
USNATO 00000550  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
We will close the day with the usual Transatlantic dinner, 
kindly hosted by Belgium. 
 
Following the NAC in ISAF format, which will be the first 
meeting on Friday, 4 December, we will continue with a NAC 
working session, concentrating on relations with Russia, 
Missile Defence, and our new Strategic Concept.  Work on the 
Strategic Concept is a major priority in the run up to the 
next year's Lisbon Summit.  In line with the Summit tasking 
to keep the Council involved, I will provide an interim 
progress report on the work of the experts. 
 
Another key issue is the ongoing work within NATO on Missile 
Defence, including in light of the new phased adaptive 
approach to Missile Defence in Europe announced by the Unites 
States on 17 September.  I hope you will welcome this new 
approach and note that with it NATO is put at the core of 
deliberations on Missile Defence in Europe. 
 
Resetting co-operation with Russia is another key Alliance 
priority.  Without compromising on any of our positions of 
principle, such as Georgia, we need to identify areas where 
dialogue and cooperation with Russia further NATO's interests. 
 
In the first formal NATO-Russia Council meeting in Foreign 
Ministers' format since December 2007, which will be 
organized as a working lunch, we will address key political 
dialogue topics, including those on which we disagree, as 
well as possibilities for additional NRC cooperation, on the 
basis of common interest.  Allies may wish to encourage 
Russia to deliver more on Afghanistan, Operation Active 
Endeavour, and military-to-military co-operation as tangible 
signs of Russia's commitment to reengage with NATO.  In 
addition, the meeting will hopefully allow us to agree on 
some key deliverables, such as the NRC Ministerial tasking on 
the "Joint Review of 21st Century Common Security 
Challenges", ways to reinvigorate and reform the NRC 
structures, and the work plan for 2010. 
 
I look forward to welcoming you in Brussels for a focused, 
interactive and productive meeting. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
//s// 
 
Anders Fogh Rasmussen
