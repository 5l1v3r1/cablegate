PATRONAGE 
 
REF: DAKAR 696 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The recently-created Conseil Economique et Social 
(CES) is an advisory body tasked with ensuring that the needs of 
Senegal's people are heard by the government.  However, the new CES 
is no different to a pre-existing CES that President Abdoulaye Wade 
campaigned against and dissolved in 2000.  The 2009 version of the 
CES is staffed with Wade's loyal supporters and, according to the 
opposition, a blatant example of patronage. END SUMMARY 
 
Composition and Purpose of the Council 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On Wednesday, July 29, President Wade presided over the 
official installation of the new CES.  The CES consists of 80 
official members as well as 40 associate members drawn from 
different socio-professional categories.  The chair of the CES is 
nominated by the President for a renewable five-year term.  It is 
currently headed by Ousmane Masseck Ndiaye a close political ally of 
Wade who recently lost both his positions as Mayor of Saint Louis 
and as Minister of State for Decentralization and Local Government. 
The CES is designed to be an advisory body for the government; its 
duties are to listen to the needs and grievances of different 
population groups, "enlighten" the choices of the state, and promote 
peaceful relations between different social groups.  The CES will 
allegedly focus its efforts on the labor classes and vulnerable 
populations. 
 
CES - Sounds Familiar 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The CES is not a newfound idea as Wade dissolved a 
pre-existing CES in 2000 after routinely arguing that it was 
unnecessary and consumed up too much of the government's budget. It 
had no mandate to control government policy, or to reject existing 
laws; it could only advise.  Wade stressed that, if elected he would 
eliminate the CES.  Following his swearing-in, he did just that but 
kept CES President, Famara Ibrahima Sagna, one of his closest 
friends, as his special adviser until March 2004. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On June 19, 2003 the National Assembly approved the 
creation of the Conseil de la Republique pour les Affaires 
Economiques et Sociales (CRAES).  President Wade appointed MBaye 
Jacques Diop as the President of CRAES in June 2004.  This 
ostensibly "new" body staffed with 100 people fulfilled the same 
role that the CES had before Wade's presidency.  While the 
opposition questioned this decision and remarked that the CRAES was 
similar to the dissolved CES, Wade provided no reasoning or 
justification for the creation of the new council. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In 2007, the CRAES published an annual report that was 
critical on the state of corruption and mismanagement in Senegal's 
public sector.  Wade did not like it, and said as much in both 
public and private.  It was around that point in time that the Mbaye 
Jacques Diop, the then-President of the CRAES, fell out of favor 
with Wade who subsequently told Diop to resign, but Diop refused. 
As Wade had no legal authority to remove Diop, he circumvented 
around this hurdle by sending to the National Assembly on August 7, 
2008 a bill to disband CRAES. 
 
Opportunities for Patronage 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Observers and opposition parties currently echo Wade's own 
sentiments from the 2000 presidential campaign: the CES is not the 
key to providing social safety and stability, they argue.  Rather, 
it is wasteful government spending and blatant patronage.  In a vein 
similar to the creation of the Senate, Wade personally selected the 
members of the newly formed CES.  Many of them are former ministers 
and members of Wade's government, as well as his good political 
clients and supporters.  These members are paid substantially and 
given numerous perks.  Revealingly, not a single member of the CES 
participated in the 2008 "Assise National". (NOTE: The "Assise 
National" was a widely-attended gathering called by civil society to 
call attention and propose remedies to a number of Senegal's 
problems.  The gathering was critical of, and boycotted by, Wade's 
party. END NOTE) 
 
Divide and Conquer 
------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) Institutions such as the CRAES and the CES have been used 
by Wade to undermine potential future opponents.  Rather than fight 
these people, he co-opts them when possible, removing an enemy and 
further weakening any opposition.  A prime example of this practice 
at work concerns Mbaye Fall Leye, the President of CUSEMS, a popular 
teachers' union.  Leye was co-opted into the newly-formed CES.

Subsequently, the coalition of unions to which CUSEMS belonged 
kicked him out, and CUSEMS itself was split into two, divided 
between those who support Leye and those who oppose him.  By 
bringing Leye into the CES, Wade not only removed a potential 
opponent but also severely weakened CUSEMS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Underneath the lofty rhetoric, the CES is nothing but a 
patronage tool used by Wade to reward those loyal to him and to 
"recycle" unpopular supporters.  Wade's dissolution of the CRAES is 
a perfect example of this blatant patronage at work; the moment that 
it did not serve his interests, he disbanded it. Now that the 
political class has grown even larger and some of his confidants 
were soundly defeated in the March 22 local elections, Wade revived 
the CES/CRAES in order to placate his cronies.  In the end, however, 
what is most worrisome about this episode is the President's 
continued manipulation of the Senegalese constitution to suit his 
needs.  END COMMENT.
