¶1. (SBU) Nguyen Diep Ha, desk officer in the Foreign 
Ministry's West Asia and Africa Department, told Poloff 
February 23 that Vietnam "respects the decision of the 
Palestinian people's choice to elect Hamas" and predicted 
that Hamas will "represent the Palestinian people well and 
will act in their best interests."  No one from the 
Palestinian authority or Hamas has recently suggested 
meeting with any representative from the GVN, she said, but 
if such a meeting is requested, Vietnam will consider U.S. 
views.  Vietnam has relatively good relations with the PA 
(Ref B). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Americas Desk officer Le Dung subsequently told 
Poloff that Vietnam will definitely make a statement on the 
mosque bombing (Ref C), but the timing and content of the 
statement have yet to be determined.  Poloff provided copies 
of the Statement by the President and the Joint Statement by 
Ambassador Khalilzad and General Casey.
