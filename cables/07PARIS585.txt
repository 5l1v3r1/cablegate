REF:  NOTE VERBALE 82/AME DTD 24 JANUARY 2007 
 
¶1.  Embassy received from the MFA diplomatic note number 82/AME 
dated 24 January 2007 (Ref A).  Informal Embassy Translation 
follows. 
 
¶2.  QUOTE:  In its Diplomatic Note number 460 dated 14 September 
2006, the Embassy had asked the Ministry whether U.S. vessels 
conducting scientific research could be exonerated from paying taxes 
when refueling in French ports.   Following consultation with 
relevant Ministries and organizations, the Ministry informs the 
Embassy that US vessels conducting oceanographic research benefit 
from the exoneration of the Petroleum Gas (TIPP) and the Value Added 
Tax (VAT) on condition that they sail within the framework of 
missions under the aegis of public U.S. authorities. 
 
¶3.  For further information, the Embassy can contact Mrs. Michelle 
Jusselme, Ministry of Economy and Finances and Industry, Direction 
General of Customs and Rights (Tel: 01-44-74-47-21 
michelle.jusselme@douanes.finances.gouv.fr).  END QUOTE 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  The Department will recall that in connection with the 
cruise of R/V Endeavor (State Department File No. 2005-100) of April 
2006, questions had arisen whether research vessels generally would 
be exempted from payment of taxes on bunkering of their fuel in 
French ports.  Customs authorities in Marseille had replied 
negatively.  The information provided in the above Note helps to 
clarify under what circumstances U.S. research vessels may be 
exempted from fuel taxes.  Perhaps most helpfully the note refers 
the Embassy to a point-of-contact in French customs should questions 
of interpretation arise in the future.
