SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: ATTORNEY GENERAL ISSUES NEW REGULATION TO 
PRESSURE CLAIMANTS 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (SBU) The Government of Nicaragua (GON) has issued a 
regulation stating that property claimants have 45 days to provide 
their mailing addresses to the Attorney General's Office.  The GON 
claims that this regulation was necessary because the Attorney 
General's Office had been unable to notify claimants regarding the 
status of their claims.  If a claimant does not provide the Attorney 
General's Office with the correct address within that period, any 
future administrative resolution will be posted at the Attorney 
General's Office.  Absent an appeal during the allotted timeframe, 
the GON will consider the claim settled in the administrative 
process.  We are concerned that the Attorney General's Office will 
abuse the regulation to unilaterally "resolve" claims. 
 
NEW REGULATION ON PROPERTY CLAIMS 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Regulation 03/2009, published in the Official Gazette on 
September 9, states that individuals (or their legal 
representatives) with property claims filed with the GON have 45 
days, beginning September 9, to provide or update their addresses on 
file with the Attorney General's Office.  The regulation notes that 
in some cases, claimants failed to provide addresses or have not 
updated addresses since filing their claims.  As a result, it has 
been impossible to contact them. 
 
¶3. (U) Once the 45-day period concludes, the Attorney General's 
Office will use the addresses provided to notify claimants of 
administrative actions taken to resolve their claims.  The Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs will send diplomatic notes to all foreign 
missions notifying them of the regulation so that they may inform 
their citizens.  Should claimants -- whether national or foreign -- 
fail to provide an address, notice of any administrative actions 
taken on their claims will be posted at the Attorney General's 
Office. 
 
¶4. (U) Claimants may appeal government decisions in accordance with 
the Civil Procedure Code, as long as they file an appeal within the 
allotted timeframe.  If claimants do not appeal government decisions 
regarding their claims in the administrative process, the Attorney 
General's Office may publish any uncontested notification in the 
Official Gazette and the claim will be considered settled in the 
administrative process.  Claimants still have the right to go to 
court to contest administrative notifications, but it is likely that 
the GON will argue that claimants failed to challenge administrative 
decisions based on the law. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5. (SBU) We are concerned that the Attorney General's Office will 
abuse this regulation to finalize claims and move forward with the 
GON's longstanding plan to "resolve" all administrative claims -- on 
its own terms -- by 2011.  We are contacting all U.S. citizen 
claimants to make them aware of the new regulation so that they can 
provide their addresses to Attorney General's Office.  We want to 
ensure that our claimants' right to due process is protected and not 
undermined based on a legal technicality.
