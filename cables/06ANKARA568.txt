In Today's Papers 
 
Investigation into Priest Killing Continues 
Sabah, Hurriyet, Milliyet, Yeni Safak and others:  Papers 
continue to speculate about the circumstances surrounding 
the murder of an Italian Catolic priest in Trabzon as the 
investigation moves forward.  Radikal highlights the 
suspect's father's remarks that his son received medical 
treatment two years ago for psychological problems. 
According to Hurriyet, the suspect's father said his son 
received instructions to carry out the murder through the 
internet, and claimed that the real murderers were the ones 
who had given the gun to his son.  There are also 
allegations that the suspect belonged to a religious sect, 
which had manipulated him into the atack.  Vatan says the 
suspect's father denied  allegations that his son had 
murdered the priest. 
 
Protests over Cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed: 
All papers:  While violent protests continue over the 
published cartoons of Mohammed, UN Secretary General Annan, 
OIC General Secretary Ihsanoglu, and the EU's Javier Solana 
appealed for calm.  There were small, peaceful protests in 
many provinces of Turkey yesterday.  Speaking to reporters 
yesterday, MFA spokesman Namik Tan said that people should 
remember their responsibilities while they are enjoying the 
freedom of expression.  Presidents Bush and Putin called for 
calm and restraint. 
 
Columnists Akif Emre and Ibrahim Karagul, writing in the 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak, commented the cartoon crisis 
is an indication of strong Islamophobia in Europe and the 
US. 
In the mainstream daily Milliyet, Melih Asik draws attention 
to the fact that the cartoon crisis started in Denmark. 
After reminding about Denmark's participation in the Iraq 
coalition, the commentator said, "the Danish paper is not 
testing freedom of expression.  The cartoon issue has 
nothing to do with that. In reality, it is attacking the 
spiritual values of the Muslim world, which results in 
indirect support for the occupiers of the Middle East." 
 
Ambassador Wilson Remarks in Zaman: 
Visiting the Ankara bureau of the Islamist-oriented daily 
Zaman, US Ambassador Ross Wilson explained US views on 
issues of mutual concern.  Zaman highlighted Wilson's 
remarks on Iran as a front-page story under the headline "US 
is pleased with Turkey's stance on Iran."  Ambassador Wilson 
said Iran should be persuaded to abandon its nuclear weapons 
and negotiate with the international community.  "This is 
what Turkey has been calling for as well."  Responding to a 
question on the cartoon crisis, Ambassador Wilson criticized 
the cartoons as "repugnant" while emphasizing that the 
violent protests are "unacceptable."  Zaman carried Wilson's 
remarks on other issues, including Cyprus, the PKK and 
Hamas.  He noted the importance the US attaches to an 
effective solution to the PKK problem.  Regarding Hamas, 
Wilson said that Turkish PM Erdogan had given the right 
messages to Hamas when he called on the organization to 
renounce terrorism and recognize Israel.  The Zaman story 
mentioned that the Ambassador did not want to speak in 
detail on domestic political issues, but emphasized that 
Turkey's democratic system remains an assurance for 
stability and good US-Turkish relations. 
 
Iran: 
All papers carried the statement by MFA spokesman on Iran 
pointing to diplomacy for the settlement of the Iran issue. 
Tan said that Iran has until March 6 to decide to pursue 
 
ANKARA 00000568  002 OF 002 
 
 
diplomacy, and urged Iran to make use of this opportunity. 
 
Commenting on the Iran issue, Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in the 
conservative Turkiye about the growing American support for 
war with Iran.  "A recent opinion poll showed that 57 
percent of Americans support a possible military operation 
against Iran.  The figure is horrifyingly high considering 
the fact that this is about another cross-Atlantic war.  The 
result can be interpreted as evidence that Washington's 
project on Iran has attained a national consensus despite 
the negative aspects of the current Iraq operation.  If we 
remember the Israeli air attack in 1981 against a nuclear 
facility in Iraq, we can expect that the US will benefit 
from that experience and repeat it on a larger scale" the 
writer observed. 
 
In the mainstream Hurriyet, columnist Cuneyt Ulsever thinks 
Iran has a broader goal in escalating the tension.  "The 
quest for global Islamic hegemony has become an ideological 
fixation in Iran.  By defying the US and Israel, Iran hopes 
to gain more of a footing in the Islamic world and to play a 
leadership role in the region. Given the current 
international circumstances, particularly the situation in 
the Middle East, Iran seems to be carried away with 
imagining itself as the pioneer for a global Islamic 
hegemony free from Western imperialism.  It is possible that 
Iran is interpreting the current environment as suitable for 
playing this kind of chess game" the writer argued. 
 
Television (NTV, 7:00) 
 
Focus on Turkey: 
 
Turkey's Supreme Court (Danistay) ruled that a primary 
school principal should not be allowed to wear a headscarf 
as she approaches and departs from the school each day.  The 
court argued that wearing a headscarf in close proximity to 
the school would set a bad example for the students. 
 
Focus on the United States: 
 
Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi Guler spoke to the press in 
Washington before his meeting with Energy Secretary Bodman. 
Guler described Turkey's long-term energy needs, and said 
the development of a nuclear power industry would be part of 
meeting those needs.  He added that Turkey is ready to work 
with the Iraqi authorities on joint development of oil 
resources in northern Iraq. 
 
EUCOM Commander General James Jones made positive comments 
in Washington on the state of the US-Turkish military 
rlationship, and praised the leadership shown by Turkish 
Chief of General Staff General Hilmi Ozkok.   WILSON
