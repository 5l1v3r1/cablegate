REF: STATE 019516 
 
Â¶1. Embassy delivered reftel points and non-papers -- 
regarding the February 4 IAEA Board of Governors decision to 
refer the Iran dossier to the UN Security Council -- to MFA 
UN affairs director Michelle Cohen on February 8 and to MFA 
Africa/Middle East affairs director Jose Juan Hernandez 
Cimadevilla.  Neither had any substantive comment, as the 
Dominican Republic was not involved in the IAEA decision. 
However, Hernandez Cimadevilla expressed appreciation for 
this and any other information we could provide to him on the 
situation in Iran.  If Embassy receives any substantive 
reaction, it will be reported.
