SUBJECT: THE WEEK IN PARLIAMENT, 5/16-5/21: MPS DEBATE 
ELECTED GOVERNORS 
 
¶1. The Lower House moved away from contentious debate over 
civilian casualties this week and debated legislation 
regulating the Independent Directorate for Local Governance 
(IDLG), sparking a conversation over whether Parliament 
should require the popular election of governors.  Tajiks, 
Uzbeks, and Hazaras (mainly from northern provinces) argued 
in favor of elected governors, saying such a change would 
better connect people to their government.  Pashtun and 
southern MPs mostly opposed the idea, calling the idea an 
unconstitutional attempt to subvert the authority of the 
central government.  Other MPs warned that subjecting 
governors to election would lead to warlords winning office 
and persecuting ethnic and religious minorities.  MPs were 
unable to reach a consensus and Speaker Qanooni, bowing to 
tradition, did not call for a vote on a closely divided 
issue, instead referring the law back to the committees for 
further study. 
 
¶2. Lower House MPs also revisited the controversy of Foreign 
Minister Spanta, who failed a no confidence vote in 2007 but 
remained in office with the support of the Supreme Court, 
signing international agreements on behalf of the government. 
 Qanooni said Parliament would no longer consider ratifying 
agreements signed by Spanta.  MPs also passed a law 
regulating transportation affairs and condemned the alleged 
beating of an MP from Sar-e-Pul by Afghan National Police 
officers.  The Upper House again struggled to make a quorum 
and did not take any major actions this week.
