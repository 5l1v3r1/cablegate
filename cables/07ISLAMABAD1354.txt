SUBJECT: MUSHARRAF ON CHIEF JUSTICE CONTROVERSY, FATA, AND JIRGAS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (U)  Ambassador paid his farewell call on President  Musharraf on March 24.  The meeting was front-page news in  most Pakistani papers, with many articles emphasizing  Musharraf's promise to "fight the war on terror to the end."  The press coverage highlighted the strength of the  U.S.-Pakistan strategic relationship; the significant number  of Pakistanis studying under the Fulbright program; and  Musharraf's promise to address the "roots of terrorism" -- an  allusion to his Federally Administered Tribal Areas  development strategy. 
  GOVERNMENT INSTIGATING ATTACKS AGAINST FOREIGNERS IN FATA 
 
¶2.  (C)  Musharraf said he remains fully committed to the war  on terror.  Two brigades have completed their deployment to  North and South Waziristan as part of the process of  asserting government control.  The government has  successfully instigated tribesmen against the Uzbeks in South  Waziristan, with over 200 killed; Musharraf wants to  encourage similar action in North Waziristan and elsewhere. 
While the government will need to proceed carefully to insure  that the population is with the government and against the  foreigners, Musharraf stressed that there will be no  hesitation in going after al-Qaida targets. 
  FATA and JIRGAS 
 
¶3.  (C)  Musharraf expressed appreciation for the  Administration's commitment to provide USD 150 million in FY 
07 to begin funding Tribal Area development.  Musharraf  understood that success with this tranche of money was key to  securing additional funding in the out years.  He said  Pakistan was working to implement a fully coordinated  approach between Islamabad institutions (federal ministries,  the military, the parliament) and provincial institutions  (the NWFP Governor, the FATA Secretariat, and the FATA  Development Authority.) 
 
¶4.    (C)  Musharraf agreed that the Pak-Afghan jirga process  had great potential to improve cross-border cooperation, to  improve security conditions,  and to reduce tension between  the two countries.  The Ambassador urged that the two sides  move quickly to conclude arrangements for a jirga and asked  Musharraf to make this a priority.  Musharraf said he would. 
  CHIEF JUSTICE CONTROVERSY 
 
¶5.  (C)  Musharraf confided that the Government of Pakistan  had made a mess of handling corruption accusations against  the Chief Justice.  He took personal responsibility for not  having developed a "what if" plan -- referring, among other  things, to the lack of consideration of what would happen if  the Chief Justice refused to resign after learning of the  reference against him.  Musharraf emphasized that he believed  the Chief Justice was corrupt and had damaged judicial  institutions.  Something had to be done, he said, though he  admitted his government had handled the problem badly. 
 
¶6.  (C)  Musharraf was personally directing damage control. 
He had provided very specific orders to the police and other  agencies, telling them to  leave the media alone  and not to  engage protesters head on.  Musharraf added that the two  weeks of incidents had proven that the police needed greater  training, discipline, and effective control.  He committed  himself to working on those shortcomings. 
 
¶7.   (C)  Musharraf said he had personally ordered all  relevant institutions to allow the Chief Justice unfettered  movement around Pakistan.  At the same time, he was working  with business leaders to emphasize that allowing the  controversy to continue at a fevered pitch would not be in  Pakistan's interests.  The President hoped that the PPP also  would continue its relatively restrained public posture. 
(Note:  The Friday Times -- the favored publication of  Pakistan's intelligentsia -- this week highlighted the  argument that street demonstrations in the Muslim world  historically bring Islamist regimes to power, while free  elections support moderate democrats.  End Note.) 
  PERSONNEL CHANGES 
 
¶8.  (C)  While describing next steps in the controversy,  Musharraf concurred with Ambassador that Law Minister Wasi  Muhammad Zafar, whose profane rant on VOA had offended many  Pakistanis, had exacerbated the Chief Justice controversy. 
Although he was a "loyalist," Zafar was a liability and  Musharraf said he was going to fire him.  Musharraf also  would fire the head of the Pakistan Electronic Media  Regulatory Agency, whose heavy handed interventions  throughout the controversy -- including shutting down Geo  television for 20 minutes and demanding that stations remove  rolling news tickers about the controversy -- had been both  unhelpful and wrong. 
 
¶9.  (C)  Musharraf offered that, while Information Minister  Durrani had been overwhelmed by the crushing international  media attention since the controversy began, the President  had no plans to remove him. Instead, Pakistan would  strengthen the ministry by hiring a professional public  relations consultant. 
 
¶10.  (C)  A discussion of the upcoming Arab League Summit is  being reported Septel.
