  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. TAIWAN 
 
a. "The inside story about the ceasing of the U.S.-China military 
exchanges" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(12/04): "China has 
canceled its military exchanges with the U.S. in order to protest 
the U.S. arm sales to Taiwan. This is the fifth time that the 
U.S.-China military exchanges have stopped. A Chinese official in 
the National Defense Department expressed that China has cancelled 
some mutual visit and other exchange activities with the U.S. since 
October. The words 'cease' is not an exact saying. China just 
cancelled some activities and postponed some exchange activities. 
It depends on the U.S., to withdraw their arms sales to Taiwan and 
stop the U.S.-Taiwan military connections, which will decide when 
China will resume these programs. Every time there is a backwards 
step in the relationship, it has been caused by U.S. interference in 
China's internal affairs.  How long the U.S.-China military 
exchanges can last depends on actions by the U.S., not actions by 
china." 
 
b. "Taiwan spy case: the secret about the strategic missile has been 
released" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/04): "The Western countries accusation 
about China's intent to execute the Taiwanese spy is without merit. 
Strategic missiles are an important strategic strength of China. 
They protect the nation and the people's security. The Taiwanese spy 
has stolen confidential information about this strategic missile. 
The case has become one of the biggest spy cases since China's 
establishment, causing serious damage to China's security and 
national defense construction. A Chinese spokesperson of Foreign 
Ministry expressed that China's verdict is completely within the 
scope of China's judicial sovereignty. The trial process is 
righteous.  Irresponsible comments on China's verdict have trampled 
the spirit of rule of law. China urged those countries to stop their 
wrong moves and stop from interfering other country's judicial 
actions." 
 
¶2. STRATEGIC ECONOMIC DIALOGUE 
 
a. "Carry forward Sino-U.S. dialogue mechanism" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (12/04): "The 
fifth round of Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) between China and 
the United States is to be held in Beijing today. Being the last 
round of talks between the two countries during the outgoing Bush 
administration, it has evoked a particular interest as to whether 
the dialogue mechanism will be carried forward into the new U.S. 
administration. ...The SED proponents argue that as two economic 
powers, it is necessary for the two heavyweights to continue with 
such a regular dialogue channel. ...From the Chinese viewpoint, the 
establishment of the dialogue mechanism was aimed to provide both 
sides with a platform to hold consultations on issues of strategic 
significance but not to implicate them into meaningless disputes on 
specific issues. ...The SED between China and the U.S. can serve as 
an important supplement to the established global consultation 
mechanisms in dealing with the ongoing economic crisis. ...Given 
Obama's remarks during his presidential campaign, whether the 
dialogue mechanism is kept alive will be a pointer to the new U.S. 
administration's policy toward China." 
 
b. "SED has achieved a lot" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (12/04): "As 
Vice-Premier Wang Qishan and United States Treasury Secretary Henry 
Paulson co-chair the fifth Sino-US Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) 
today, many have a question to ask - will this be the last of its 
kind? ...But let us pray for the spirit that gave birth to the SED 
to sustain. It does not matter whether it will continue to be called 
SED, or conducted the way it has been. But the two countries just 
cannot afford to abandon the hard-earned consensus on the need to 
talk to each other. It took the Bush administration, and of course 
its Chinese counterpart, six years to get there. One of the truly 
significant successes of the Bush presidency is the establishment of 
the SED, which opened up real-world possibilities to anchor the once 
volatile bilateral ties. ...We wish the new round of dialogue 
another success. Not just because we want the anticipated 
agreements, which are essential for both countries to tide over 
current troubles. It is more about its main theme 'laying the 
foundation for a long-term Sino-U.S. economic partnership.'"
