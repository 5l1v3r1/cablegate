REF: STATE 5477 
 
In advance of the EU-3 meeting on January 12, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs released a statement supporting the idea of 
referring the issue of Iran's nuclear program to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors or, 
if need be, to the United Nations Security Council.  Slovakia 
called upon Iran to refrain from activities that are viewed 
as a continuation of its nuclear weapons program, and urged 
Tehran to adopt a constructive position on proposals from the 
international community, the EU, and Russia.
