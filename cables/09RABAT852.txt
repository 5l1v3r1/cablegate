RESPONSE ON GNEP NAME CHANGE 
 
REF: STATE 106834 
 
Bouchaib El Oumni, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 
Security and Disarmament Affairs Section, told EconOff on 
October 15 that the Government of Morocco (GOM) will take 
into consideration through internal discussions the proposal 
to reorganize the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) 
raised in reftel demarche, and appreciates the USG's 
intention to expand foreign ministries' involvement in the 
GNEP or proposed International Nuclear Energy Framework 
(INEF).  As an initial reaction, he observed, changing the 
the name of the organization to a "Framework" could appear to 
dilute the commitment of the parties to the effort. 
"Partnership is a stronger concept than framework," he 
elaborated.  Oumni committed to convey to EconOff any further 
GOM response arising from internal discussions.
