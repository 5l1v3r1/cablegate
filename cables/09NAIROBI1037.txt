REF: LTC JOACHIM 5/20 EMAIL 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) 
launched its long-promised offensive in Mogadishu in the 
early morning hours of May 22.  After impressive initial 
gains, al-Shabaab and its allies pushed back.  However, as of 
early afternoon (local), the TFG reportedly remained in the 
"plus" column for the day as fighting continued. It is not 
clear to Embassy at this juncture what role AMISOM played in 
the fighting, how many casualties resulted from the urban 
warfare, and what the TFG or al-Shabaab had planned for May 
¶23.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post has received word that in the early hours of 
May 22 Transitional Federal Government forces and allied 
militia launched an offensive against Islamist-held 
positions.  Initial reports from multiple contacts are 
conflicting.  The offensive, which is ongoing as of late 
morning, may have succeeded in recapturing key parts of 
central Mogadishu, including important intersections 
northwest of Bakara Market and a strategic police station in 
lower Wardhigley.  Earlier gains in some Hawl-Wadag 
neighborhoods were lost to al-Shabaab counterattacks 
following fighting in Bakara Market. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Reached on phone on the morning of May 22, Prime 
Minister Omar Sharmarke confirmed TFG forces were gaining 
ground but the situation was fluid. He asked for our help 
resupplying TFG forces with RPG rounds and PKM (machine gun) 
ammunition.  We recommended he contact the AMISOM force 
commander, who could respond most quickly.  We have also 
passed this request to Ambassador Nicholas Bwakira at the 
AMISOM political office in Nairobi and to Embassy Uganda. 
The Embassy Uganda's defense attache has previously contacted 
the Ugandan defense ministry regarding ammunition resupply to 
the TFG (ref email) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Separately, on May 21 Mukhtar Robow announced to 
media without explanation that he had resigned his position 
as al-Shabaab Spokesman.  With him was his replacement as 
spokesman, Ali Mohamud Raage "Ali Dheere" (Hawiye/Abgal), 
whom he introduced.  His resignation may signal a significant 
break with al-Shabaab chief Ahmed Abdi aw-Mohamed "Godane aka 
Abu Zubeyr"  Many in al-Shabaab criticized Robow after he 
gave safe passage out of Baidoa to TFG ministers and other 
allied warlords after he had captured the town in January 
¶2009.  Robow was said to have allowed them safely to leave 
Baidoa because they were from the same Rahanweyn clan.  Robow 
also may have broken with al-Shabaab leadership to soften his 
stance on certain humanitarian agencies' access to Bay and 
Bakool regions, according to our contacts. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) It still is unclear if Robow remains in al Shabaab. 
 One contact confirmed he was returned to Baidoa early May 
22, along with his personal bodyguards.  Another source 
speculated he may increase his cooperation with Ras Kamboni 
leader Hassan al-Turki and Hassan Dahir Aweys.
