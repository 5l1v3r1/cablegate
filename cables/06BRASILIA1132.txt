¶1. Summary:  The May 29-June 2 NSG Plenary in Brasilia featured a 
low-key review of the India civil nuclear cooperation initiative, 
with the USDEL Chairman suggesting that India be invited to the 
October 2006 NSG Plenary in Vienna to brief the group on its plans. 
Participating Governments expressed full support for the IAEA 
implementing its mandate on Iran, while discussions of the NPT 
Additional Protocol revealed NAM objections to suppliers dictating 
to recipients that they must implement an AP to receive nuclear 
supplies.  Brazil's Ambassador Jose Medeiros will chair the NSG for 
the coming year.  End Summary 
 
¶2. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) Plenary meetings were held in 
Brasilia, Brazil, May 29 to June 2.  The State Department's Richard 
Stratford led a 17 member U.S. delegation composed of 
representatives from State, DoE, DoC, DHS and the NRC.  Principal 
among the USG's goals were to maintain forward movement in the NSG's 
consideration of civil nuclear cooperation with India, updating the 
NSG on the situation in Iran and strengthening controls over 
transfers of ENR (enrichment and reprocessing) technology. 
 
¶3. On the issue of civil nuclear cooperation with India, Stratford 
reported to the Group that bilateral cooperation discussions were 
near and congressional action was likely this summer. He suggested 
that the October 2006 NSG Consultative Group meeting in Vienna would 
provide an excellent opportunity to invite the Indians to Vienna to 
brief Participating Governments on their actions.  In summary, the 
India discussion was fairly low-key, consisting of an update by the 
US del, and reiteration of positions by PG supporters and 
opponents. 
 
¶4. On Iran, PGs agreed to a statement calling on all suppliers to 
exercise extreme vigilance and make best efforts to ensure that none 
of their exports contribute to nuclear weapons programs and 
expressed full support of the continuing work of the IAEA to fulfill 
its mandate in Iran. 
 
¶5. On the Presidential proposals, Russia expressed frustration at 
the lack of movement in the U.S. position on control of ENR 
technology and indicated it was prepared to  recommend dropping  all 
efforts to strengthen the existing ENR language in the Guidelines. 
The Additional Protocol (AP) discussion revealed that South African 
and Brazilian objections to the proposal stemmed not from objections 
to the AP itself, but from a NAM objection to suppliers dictating to 
recipients that they must implement an AP to receive nuclear items. 
PGs agreed to keep the AP proposal on the agenda. 
 
¶6. The NSG officially wrapped up on Friday June 2.  A copy of the 
NSG Statement and the Chairman's summary have been forwarded to 
Washington by the delegation.  The GoB under the guidance of 
Ambassador Jose Medeiros will chair the NSG for the coming year.
