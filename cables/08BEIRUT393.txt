LIKELIHOOD THAT LEBANON WILL RECEIVE 
NATURAL GAS ON TIME VIEWED WITH SKEPTICISM 
--------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) General Manager of the government-owned Tripoli and Zahrani 
(south Lebanon) Oil Installations Sarkis Hlaiss expressed skepticism 
that Lebanon will start receiving natural gas through the Arab gas 
pipeline this summer as announced by Acting Energy Minister Safadi 
on February 27.  Hlaiss told us March 12 that he is waiting to see 
whether Egypt will actually pump gas to Syria through Jordan on 
March 21 as announced.  Hlaiss explained that Egypt is currently 
unable to pump gas directly to Lebanon because of low gas pressure. 
Therefore, Syria will use Egyptian gas and swap it for Syrian gas 
which will be pumped to Lebanon through the Homs-Tripoli pipeline. 
Lebanon and Egypt still have to sign the gas contract, and Hlaiss 
stressed that Lebanon's relationship will be directly with Egypt, 
with no Syrian involvement.  Egypt will guarantee the supply of gas, 
and Lebanon will pay Egypt directly for it (septel). 
 
MORE TRAINING TO FIGHT TERRORISM FINANCE, 
HEAD OF FIU TO VISIT U.S. SOON 
--------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Secretary of the Special Investigation Commission (SIC) 
fighting money laundering and terrorism finance, Lebanon's Financial 
Intelligence Unit (FIU), Mohammad Baasiri told us on March 12 that 
the British FIU will organize a three-day seminar on fighting 
terrorism finance on March 26 in Beirut.  The program will be 
offered to Lebanese officials at the SIC, the Internal Security 
Forces (ISF), Customs, and the judiciary.  Baasiri also mentioned 
that the IMF and the Egmont group sponsored a seminar on the use of 
Information Technology (IT) to combat terrorism finance two weeks 
ago.  He also noted that the SIC is providing technical assistance 
to Syria, offering eight sessions on a monthly basis to train 
Syria's FIU and private banks. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Baasiri told us that he will be visiting the U.S. on April 
28-29 and plans to meet with Treasury, FinCen, and the Federal 
Reserve to prepare for the U.S. - MENA Private Sector Dialogue, 
which will take place in Washington, D.C. and New York in October 
¶2008.  Baasiri will also attend the next MENA FATF Plenary meeting 
that will be held on the week of April 7 in Abu Dhabi and will 
discuss Lebanon's mutual evaluation review scheduled for July 2008. 
 
 
LEBANESE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY 
ISSUES $75 MILLION BOND 
------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) On March 10, the Lebanese American University (LAU) announced 
that it had successfully issued a $75 million bond in the U.S., 
entirely subscribed by Lebanese Byblos Bank.  LAU released a 
statement saying that this is the first time that an American 
academic institution in the Middle East has ever undertaken a bond 
issuance.  LAU President Dr. Joseph Jabra noted that this will allow 
it to finance its strategic plans, enabling it to become a 
pioneering, world-class academic institution. 
 
CDA SISON HOSTS BUSINESS 
AND ECONOMIC ASSOCIATIONS ROUNDTABLE 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) On March 13, CDA Sison hosted a roundtable with heads of 
Lebanon's main private sector business and economic associations. 
Participants expressed their concerns over current difficulties in 
US - Lebanon trade relations, including lack of trade finance, less

USTDA active involvement, fewer programs, and phyto-sanitary 
standards for Lebanese exports.  Attendees suggested the U.S. be 
more proactive in helping Lebanon adopt international standards, 
along the lines of EU efforts.  Participants hoped that more 
Lebanese companies could be subcontractors to US companies with 
contracts in the region, including Iraq, and looked for greater 
USAID support to the local food industry. 
 
BEIRUT STOCK EXCHANGE 
ACTIVITY DECLINES IN 2007 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) indicated that 2007 total 
volume dropped by 15.3 percent, while aggregate turnover dropped by 
51 percent compared to 2006.  Market capitalization rose by 31.2 
percent year-on-year, of which 60 percent was in banking stocks and 
34.7 percent in real estate company Solidere stocks alone.  Banking 
stocks accounted for 64.3 percent of aggregate trading volume, 
followed by Solidere with 31.8 percent.  In terms of value of 
shares, Solidere accounted for 65 percent of aggregate value in 
2007, followed by bank stocks (31.6 percent), investment funds (2.5 
percent), industry (0.6 percent, and trading (0.4 percent). 
 
LEBANESE FRANCHISEASSOCIATION 
LAUNCHES ADVERSTISING CAMPAIGN 
------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) On March 12, the Lebanese Franchise Association (LFA) held a 
press conference at the Beirut Chamber of Commerce to launch its 
advertising campaign.  Participants highlighted the important role 
of Lebanese franchises in promoting Lebanon's image abroad.  The LFA 
is expected to join Post's delegation to the International Franchise 
Expo in Washington D.C. on April 11-13, 2008. 
 
LEBANON FALLS 11 PLACES IN 
EUROMONEY'S COUNTRY RISK SURVEY... 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) In Euromoney's semi-annual survey of country risk, Lebanon 
ranked 127 out of 185 countries worldwide, down 11 places compared 
to the last survey, conducted in September 2007.  Regionally, 
Lebanon ranked 14 out of 19 MENA countries.  The survey uses nine 
categories, with the highest weight given to political risk and 
economic performance (25 percent each), followed by debt indicators, 
debt in default, credit ratings, access to bank finance, access to 
short-term finance, access to capital markets, and discount on 
forfeiting.  Lebanon's score dropped in all categories except for 
debt in default and access to short-term finance.  Overall, the 
survey found that the worldwide trend, as in the MENA, has been one 
of increasing risk. 
 
... AND DROPS IN THE UN 
TELECOM INFRASTRUCTURE INDEX 
------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) The 2008 UN Telecommunications Infrastructure Index ranked 
Lebanon 76 out of 192 countries worldwide, down from 62 in the 
previous survey conducted in 2005.  Meanwhile, Lebanon ranked 7 out 
19 MENA countries, maintaining the same ranking as in the 2005 
survey.  The index includes five primary variables reflecting a 
country's telecommunications: infrastructure capacity, a composite 
measure of the penetration of personal computers, telephone lines, 
Internet usage, mobile subscriptions, and broadband.
