¶1.  Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno made the following public 
statement on June 1 calling on Iran to stop nuclear 
enrichment activities: 
 
"Costa Rica agrees with the international call for Iran to 
suspend its processing and enrichment of uranium, whose 
consequences could put the world at risk of an international 
crisis." 
 
¶2.  Stagno emphasized that due to Costa Rica's commitment to 
peace and respect for international law, Costa Rica expresses 
its support for dialog and negotiations with Iran, in the 
framework established by the UN and International Atomic 
Energy Association (IAEA), "that require a demonstration of 
cooperation and compromise on Iraq's part."  Stagno added 
that "we are very pleased" with the announcement of the 
United States to assist the efforts of the European 3 to find 
solutions to the Iran nuclear situation.
