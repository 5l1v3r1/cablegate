TRAINING 
 
¶1. (U) On May 9, a U.S. Coas Guard Mobile Training Team 
(MTT) completed a wee-long outboard motor maintenance course 
for 20 Csta Rican Coast Guard (SNGC) personnel at the 
Paific port city of Puntarenas.  The SNGC personnel,from 
several different stations, received two das of classroom 
instruction followed by two days o "turning wrenches" on 
actual non-operational ouboard motors.  As a practical 
result of the MTT ourse, three outboard engines were put 
back intooperation and thus put one Eduardono-type of 
"gofast" back in the water at full operational capacit for 
Costa Rica. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The U.S. Coast Guar MTT told us that the SNGC 
personnel were alread fairly well-trained on outboard motor 
maintenane, but benefited from some new techniques and 
prcedures.  However, they did note that SNGC personne 
should be encouraged to better use their mainteance manuals 
so that no procedures were overlookd.  The MTT added that by 
the end of the trainin, the SNGC personnel were starting to 
properly ue the manuals.  The MTT also donated a ratchet 
tol set to the SNGC at the end of the course. 
 
¶3. (U) Martin Arias, Director of the SNGC, and Agnes Gomez, 
the mayor of Puntarenas, also attended the graduation 
ceremony.  Arias highlighted the importance of the training 
for his coast guard and thanked the MTT for "tightening the 
links" between Costa Rica and the U.S.  Gomez said that the 
maintenance training would directly and positively affect the 
readiness of the SNGC and would assist in interdicting drugs, 
especially in her district.  Local media coverage, including 
television, was positive and highlighted the cooperative 
nature of the training. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Arias requested further MTT maintenance training on 
the Model 3412-type of Caterpillar engines that drive their 
three 82-foot patrol boats.

COMMENT 
======= 
 
¶5. (SBU) This MTT training is the first of its type that Post 
has been able to sponsor in nearly six years, mainly due to 
DoD and USCG priorities in other regions.  We encouraged the 
SNGC personnel to take their new-found skills back to their 
units and put more of their small boats back into operation. 
Much remains to be done to put the Costa Rican Coast Guard at 
a higher operational readiness rate, but MTT's such as this 
help tremendously.  Although fairly basic, we believe this is 
exactly the kind of training that is needed to correct the 
SNGC's inconsistent maintenance record. 
 
¶6. (U) We would like to pass along kudos and thanks to the 
USCG for sending this outboard motor maintenance MTT to Costa 
Rica.  If possible, we request further maintenance visits of 
this kind to improve our bilateral maritime effort to 
interdict narcotics.
