¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Anti-trafficking NGOs applauded the 
decision to upgrade Cambodia to Tier 2 Watch List, based on 
the Cambodia's performance last year.  However, AFESIP and 
IJM believe that cooperation so far this year has not matched 
last year's efforts.  Mission officers are stressing in their 
contacts with Cambodian officials the importance of sustained 
efforts to combat trafficking in coming months lest Cambodia 
fall back to Tier 3 in next year's rankings.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  AFESIP's Mam Somaly expressed pleasure with 
Cambodia's upgrade to Tier 2 Watch List in a recent 
conversation with Poloff.  She said the top levels of the 
police are committed to fighting TIP, but she said she was 
not so certain that lower levels of the police shared this 
commitment.  She also noted the increasing sophistication of 
trafficking in Phnom Penh and expressed concern that there 
was not the same level of cooperation with provincial police 
as existed in Phnom Penh.  She singled out the small town of 
Kamrieng, between Battambang and the Thai border, as a new 
site that warranted close monitoring. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  An International Justice Mission (IJM) 
representative told Poloff that he believed that Cambodia's 
Tier 2 upgrade was warranted given the good cooperation last 
year.  However, IJM emphasized that the police have been less 
helpful this year.  IJM recommended that the approval process 
for operations by General Ung Sokunthea's MOI 
Anti-trafficking unit be streamlined.  Currently, it took two 
weeks to gain approval for operations, whereas it took only 
two days last year.  IJM said it had planned to shut down a 
group of brothels with allegedly underage children in Phnom 
Penh's Street 63 within a period of one month, but the police 
halted the operation after one brothel was shut down. 
However, IJM described good cooperation in the provinces - 
Battambang, Siem Riep and Sihanoukville - where it has 
conducted police training for anti-TIP activities.  Unlike 
AFESIP, IJM believed that investigations in the provinces 
were more expensive, but not less efficient. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  World Vision's Director Bill Forbes commented that 
he believed the Tier 2 Watch List was the proper designation 
for Cambodia.  One-off events like the Chai Hour II raid 
should not be the sole factor in determining Cambodia's 
ranking, he commented.  However, Forbes wanted to see the 
Chief of the Anti-Trafficking Department increase its 
operations.  Forbes complained that the Ministry of Social 
Affairs, Veterans and Youth (MOSAVY) does not have adequate 
capacity to monitor the well-being of rescued girls.  He also 
recommended better coordination between MOSAVY and the 
Ministry of Interior, as well as between the Ministries of 
Interior and Justice.  Forbes expressed concern about other 
forms of human trafficking apart from trafficking for sexual 
purposes, noting that he would like to raise awareness of 
safe migration and other forms of TIP.  He lauded the fact 
that the TIP Report is beginning to highlight the issue of 
forced labor. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  HAGAR's Talmage Payne agreed with other NGO 
leaders on the Tier 2 Watch List designation of Cambodia.  He 
said that Cambodia has made commendable improvement in its 
anti-TIP efforts, though he believed the effort was largely a 
bye-product of donor pressure rather than arising from 
genuine commitment on the part of the government.  He said 
that he would like to see a government managed accreditation 
system for shelters and better NGO oversight of the shelters. 
 Like World Vision, Payne believed labor trafficking was an 
important issue that will become a challenge for Cambodia. 
He sees a need to monitor labor recruiting agencies. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Comment:  All of the NGOs that we contacted 
appeared to be genuinely pleased with Cambodia's upgrade to 
Tier 2 Watch List status, but all were less enthusiastic 
about Cambodia's progress on TIP issues this year.  Mission 
officials, including the Ambassador, have stressed in their 
contacts with the RGC that it cannot rest on its laurels, 
that it must make a concerted and sustained effort over the 
coming months to ensure that Cambodia does not fall back 
again into Tier 3.
