Rio-based center-right daily O Globo writes: "Mercosul's group 
indignation against the non-restoration of Manuel Zelaya to the 
Presidency of Honduras and the consequent non recognition of the 
elections in this country shows Hugo Ch????vez's bad influence in the 
block. It is a shame that Brazil, due to its Bolivarian 
companionship, continues to throw its weight and prestige at a 
setback in the Honduran situation, for which the elections are the 
only viable way out."  (Dec 10, page 39)
