SUBJECT: GERMANY H1N1 UPDATE: German Cases Triple This Week 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 889, B) Berlin 884 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 cases in Germany 
has more than tripled this week. The one-day rise was 389 
cases to a total of 2,844 on July 24. The majority of new 
infections occurred abroad, mainly during travel to Spain. 
END SUMMARY. 
¶2. (U)  The number of confirmed virus cases in Germany has 
more than tripled compared to Friday of last week when 834 
people had tested positive for the virus.  According to the 
National Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch 
Institute (RKI), the increase in the number of infections is 
mainly due to people returning from vacation (320 new cases), 
with most of them reportedly infected while on holiday in 
Spain. 
¶3. (U)  RKI announced in its press briefing July 24, 389 new 
laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1.  This increases the total 
number of H1N1 infections in Germany to 2,844.  New cases were 
distributed among all sixteen federal states: Lower-Saxony 
(165), Hesse (37), Bavaria (32), Baden-Wuerttemberg (23), 
North Rhine-Westphalia (21), Thuringia (20), Berlin (17), 
Saarland (17), Rhineland-Palatinate (14), Saxony (12), 
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (10), Brandenburg (8), Saxony-Anhalt 
(6), Bremen (3), Hamburg (2) and Schleswig-Holstein (2). 
 
 
North Rhine-Westphalia reaches the 1,000 mark 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) remains the German state 
with the highest number of virus cases with 964 (34 percent of 
German cases).  However, media reports indicate that over 
1,000 people in NRW are infected with the virus, citing 
figures from the state institute of health and labor in 
Muenster which has confirmed 1,195 cases.  Over 700 cases 
reportedly occurred from travel abroad.  Another major share 
is related to the outbreak at a Japanese school in Duesseldorf 
in June where 79 people were confirmed to be infected with the 
new virus.
