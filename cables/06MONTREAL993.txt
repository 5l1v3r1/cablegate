REF: SECSTATE 134829 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff contacted Venga Aerospace Systems, Inc. 
President Hirsh Kwinter on August 31 to verify the 
information requested (reftel).  Venga Aerospace Systems 
has both aerospace and 3-D graphics divisions. Kwinter 
runs the company from his residence in Montreal. The 
company has no facilities; Kwinter manages Venga from his 
residence in Montreal.  Kwinter confirmed that the company 
was preparing to procure the MK66 Hawk aircraft, and 
recommended that Post contact Kirby Duffy, the company 
head of business development, for further information on 
the transaction. 
 
¶2. Econoff and Conoff spoke with Duffy on September 1. 
Duffy explained that the Hawk aircraft were being purchased 
to replace the Canadian Air Force CT-114 Aircraft 
currently being used by the Canadian Forces Snowbirds air 
demonstration squadron.  The Snowbirds currently fly CT-114 
Tutor aircraft, which had been used for many years as the 
standard pilot training aircraft of the Canadian Forces. 
In 2000, the rest of the Canadian Forces discontinued their 
use of this aircraft, and it has since become problematic 
to maintain those used by the Snowbirds.  Venga is now 
assisting the Canadian Forces in procuring the Mk66 Hawk 
aircraft from Armasuisse as replacements for the Snowbirds 
existing jets. 
 
¶3. Vengas only Aerospace customer is the Canadian Forces 
Snowbirds unit, based in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.  Venga 
has no facilities where the aircraft could be based or 
stored. The aircraft would be transferred directly to 15 
Wing Moose Jaw, the Canadian Forces base in Moose Jaw, 
Saskatchewan. 
 
¶4. According to Duffy, Venga is aware of the restrictions 
on USML articles, and is in the process of requesting USG 
authorization for the re-transfer.  Duffy is working with 
Robert Steinhauser, Counselor for Defense Procurement at 
the Swiss Embassy in Washington. (Phone 202-745-7950) 
Duffy can be reached at 519-342-4662.  Venga 
representatives will be in Ottawa for related meetings with 
the Swiss and the Canadian Forces from September 25 to 27, 
and have indicated that they would be available to meet 
with USG officials if requested. 
 
¶5. Since Venga does not operate any kind of commercial 
facility, Post did not conduct a site visit, per Econoffs 
September 1 discussion with PM/DTTC Tim Watkins.
