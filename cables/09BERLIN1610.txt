CERTIFICATION 
 
REF: STATE 120274 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Per reftel request, Embassy Berlin finds no 
evidence suggesting the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) or its 
affiliate organizations share ties to groups that support 
pedophilia. Per UNV representatives, the organization does not grant 
official status, accreditation or recognition to any organization 
that promotes, condones, and/or seeks the legalization of 
pedophilia, or that has any subsidiaries or member organizations 
that do. END SUMMARY. 
¶2. (SBU) The list of partner organizations includes 22 UN agencies 
and seven other agencies, which can be found at 
www.unv.org/partners/partnership-list.html. Information about the 22 
UN agencies is either requested directly from other posts in reftel, 
or is most readily attainable from USUN; as such, Embassy Berlin did 
not look into these agencies. Of the seven other agencies, three of 
them - the European Union, International Federation of the Red 
Cross/Red Crescent, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) 
are well known international organizations based outside of 
Germany. 
¶3. (SBU) The other four organizations listed as partners with UNV 
were not readily known to Embassy Berlin personnel, and were 
examined in accordance with reftel instructions, utilizing the 
internet. Results were as follows: 
-- CIVICUS: This is a South African-based NGO with offices in 
Washington DC that seeks to strengthen citizen actions and civil 
society throughout the world. As part of the global civil society 
network in the UN General Consultative Status, CIVICUS has 
intensified its contributions to the UN Economic and Social Council 
and has actively shown support for the Millennium Development Goals. 
Our investigation yielded no overt ties to groups that support 
pedophilia. 
-- International Association for Volunteer Effort (IAVE): This is a 
California-based NGO that seeks to promote the development of 
volunteering worldwide. They already have special consultative 
status with the UN ECOSOC Committee, and associate status with the 
UN Department of Public Information. Our investigation yielded no 
overt ties to groups that support pedophilia. 
-- New Academy of Business: This is a UK-based NGO that seeks to 
provide leaders with insights on organizational responsibility. The 
New Academy of Business re-opened as the Association of 
Sustainability Practitioners in June 2005. Our investigation yielded 
no overt ties to groups that support pedophilia. Post notes that 
there is a limited amount of information about this NGO on the 
internet. 
-- OneWorld: This NGO was founded in 1995 in London, UK and 
currently has 13 centers around the world that seek to promote 
democracy worldwide by covering news related to global justice that 
is not covered in mainstream media. Our investigations yielded no 
overt ties to groups that support pedophilia. 
¶4. (SBU) POC for this cable is Global Affairs Officer David Fisher,

with this request was two hours.
