Title - The crisis and its long-term corollaries 
 
Article in business-oriented Valor Economico (12-01) states: "From a 
short-term perspective, the crisis has been solved. The corrective 
measures are being adopted.... What one can affirm, without and 
great risk, is that capitalism will never be the same.  Among the 
probable changes we will see is strict regulation of the financial 
sector....controlling the abuse of executives who made fortunes 
through high salaries and participation in the profits.... Rules 
should be created to avoid that and with justifiable measures 
intended to correct the economic crisis that resulted in gains for 
the owners and controllers of poorly-managed financial 
institutions.... What happens to underdeveloped countries in Latin 
America? .... They should go beyond the simple institutional reforms 
proposed by the recently-launched Extended Washington Consensus, 
with the state taking the lead of long-term economic strategies 
aimed at eliminating economic backwardness as fast as possible."
