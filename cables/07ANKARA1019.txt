     ¶B. ANKARA 1017 
 
¶1. (SBU) Foreign Trade Undersecretariat (FTU) DDG for the 
Americas Yuksel Akca and Department Head Atilla Bastirmaci 
were disappointed, but not surprised, by reftel points about 
the 2007 USTR Special 301 Report.  They welcomed the idea of 
a more structured dialogue or plan of action in the coming 
year to assist with their removal from the Priority Watch 
List in 2008. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Subsequent to the April Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement (TIFA) Council meetings (ref B), FTU 
officials began following up on some of the issues raised 
during those meetings.  Bastirmaci told us that they were 
examining with the Turkish Ministry of Health (MOH) whether 
or not a time limit for completion could be placed on the 
remaining generic applications filed prior to January 1, 
2005, for which the MOH has not yet made a decision.  In 
addition, they are examining whether or not changes can be 
made to allow pharmaceutical marketing approval applications 
to be published in Turkey's official gazette to better ensure 
that patent rightholders have the information needed to 
protect their patents if needed.  They also agreed to ask the 
Prime Ministry whether or not the PM would consider renewing 
the 1998 decree outlawing the use of pirated software in 
government offices and will coordinate with BSA on business 
software pirating.  We will continue to follow-up and welcome 
the opportunity to work with Washington agencies to design 
the referenced "Action Plan" as soon as possible.
