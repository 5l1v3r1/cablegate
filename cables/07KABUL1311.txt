SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The poppy harvest is in full swing in Helmand 
Province, which has brought an influx of young males into the 
provincial center of Lashkar Gah.  Oddly, in recent days 
there has been no movement by laborers out of the town and 
into the poppy fields.  The reasons for this are likely 
twofold: (1) insecurity and ongoing military operations have 
made them reluctant; and (2) the record poppy cultivation and 
resulting increased demand for labor have put workers in a 
strong bargaining position.  There is evidence of men balking 
at harvesting in southern Garmsir district, with laborers 
realizing that they are a scarce commodity and are holding 
out for more money.  The higher labor costs, coupled with 
massive corruption and bribe-paying may have significantly 
increased the cost of poppy farming.  What impact this will 
have on farmers' decisions to plant later this year remains 
to be seen.  A more immediate benefit of the labor shortage 
is that it may allow Governor Wafa an opportunity to fulfill 
a new order from President Karzai to continue eradication in 
the province, with un-harvested fields offering ripe targets 
(reftel).   END SUMMARY 
 
Problems With Poppy Harvest Labor Pool Emerging 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Helmand province's poppy harvest, i.e., cutting or 
"lancing" the poppies for their opium, has started in the 
central districts of Nahri Sarraj, Nad Ali, and Lashkar Gah. 
The districts to the south started last week, and the poppy 
in the north should be ready for lancing in the next few 
days.  Harvesting is labor intensive, and there have been 
reports of large numbers of young males streaming into the 
provincial center of Lashkar Gah by taxi, bus or other means. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In recent days, though, there has not been as 
steady a stream of men leaving the town headed to the poppy 
fields.  The reluctance of some laborers to go out into the 
fields, and therefore the accumulation of laborers in town, 
has created some tensions, evidenced by one report of a 
policeman beating a young man and ordering him to leave town, 
and another, that one local poppy grower - who also happens 
to be a local police commander - forcibly directed laborers 
heading to other farmers' fields towards his own. 
 
Insecurity and High Cultivation Impact Labor Market 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) One reason for the workers' reluctance to go to the 
fields could be their unease with entering certain areas due 
to increased insecurity and ongoing military operations.  The 
Poppy Elimination Program (PEP) Team reports that there is 
evidence of disagreements between landowners (or simply poppy 
growers, as many use government land) and laborers regarding 
wages.  A number of laborers have balked at working in 
Garmsir in the south, where the Taliban regularly clash with 
Afghan Government and ISAF forces, and those agreeing to work 
reportedly may be receiving more than double the typical wage 
of ten dollars a day (plus room and board).  There also are 
reports of laborers being told they would work in the central 
districts and then being transported to Garmsir. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Another reason could be the high level of poppy 
cultivation, which may exceed what the labor market can 
provide, a fact not lost on the laborers.  There was a report 
of a disagreement between landowners and laborers in Lashkar 
Gah on April 10, wherein the landowners told the workers they 
would pay the workers only a quarter of the opium harvested 
(instead of a daily wage), while the workers have been

demanding from a third or even half of the harvest.  (NOTE: 
Last year workers received roughly only one-fifth of the 
harvest.  END NOTE.)  A group of farmers became so incensed 
by the laborers' demands that they even complained to 
provincial government officials, who had enough sense not to 
get involved.  The impasse may have been resolved, as there 
appear to be fewer young males milling about Lashkar Gah.  In 
addition, PEP Team monitors report seeing an unprecedented 
number of women and children working in the fields. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Insecurity and high cultivation appear to be 
driving up the cost of harvesting poppy in Helmand.  The 
evidence of serious corruption surrounding eradication 
efforts have also made farmers feel an additional financial 
pinch, which might hurt even more if additional religious or 
Taliban "taxes" are imposed.  With so much opium from last 
year's record harvest, and more expected this year, it is 
unlikely that the farmers will be able to pass much of this 
additional cost up the chain.  What impact this will have on 
farmers' decisions to plant or not later this year cannot be 
predicted, though this will be worth examining in the months 
ahead.  One more immediate potential impact from the labor 
constraints could be that the slow progress of harvesting 
will leave many hectares of poppy wide open and waiting for 
the Governor, assuming he follows President Karzai's 
directive, to continue his own eradication campaign (reftel).
