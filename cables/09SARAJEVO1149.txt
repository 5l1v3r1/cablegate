SUBJECT: BOSNIA: OPIC ACTION REQUEST - PROCREDIT HOLDINGS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 96861 
 
 Â¶1.  Per Reftel action request, post did not uncover 
information on Procredit Holdings, and its subsidiary in 
Bosnia, Procredit Bank BiH, that would prevent OPIC from 
extending its subordinated loan to ProCredit Holdings.  The 
local branch, managed by a staff of European expatriates, has 
a previous relationship with USAID-Sarajevo, when it was the 
recipient of a SME line of credit.  Overall, our experience 
with them has been positive.
