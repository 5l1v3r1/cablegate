SATELLITE COLLISION 
 
REF: STATE 12945 (DTG: 120535Z FEB 09 
 
¶1. (SBU) This cable corrects and replaces reftel, which 
should be destroyed.  Embassy Moscow, please note that the 
action request below is no longer valid. 
 
¶2. (SBU) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  See paragraph 3 below. 
 
¶3. (SBU) BACKGROUND:  At approximately 11:55 a.m. (EST) on 
February 10, there was a collision between an active 
privately-owned and -operated U.S. commercial Iridium-33 
communications satellite and a "dead" (i.e., inactive since 
1995) Russian military communications satellite (Cosmos 2251) 
in low Earth orbit. 
 
(SBU) There have been some limited telephone disruptions in 
the Middle East and parts of South Asia due to the loss of 
the Iridium-33 satellite.  The Cosmos 2251 was a Russian 
communications satellite that was launched in June 1993 and 
assessed as inactive since 1995.  U.S. Strategic Command 
(USSTRATCOM) is investigating the collision, but detailed 
answers may not be forthcoming for days. 
 
(SBU) News reports of the collision are already out.  The 
U.S. Air Force's Space Surveillance Network is tracking 505 
pieces from Cosmos and 194 pieces from Iridium in two 
separate debris fields.  The number of pieces of debris 
detected and tracked will increase as the debris clouds 
spread with time.  The debris is a hazard for other Iridium 
satellites; initial analysis indicates there is little risk 
to the International Space Station.  Potential risks to 
non-U.S. space-based assets and upcoming manned and unmanned 
launches are unknown at this time.  Due to the small mass of 
the debris pieces from both spacecraft, there is an extremely 
low risk of debris hazards to life and property on the 
Earth's surface. 
 
(SBU) According to NASA, Russian debris experts have already 
asked NASA experts about newly-identified debris fields.  In 
a public statement, Nicholas Johnson, NASA's chief scientist 
for orbital debris at the Johnson Space Center confirmed the 
collision occurred at an altitude of 790 kilometers (490 
miles) over northern Siberia, resulting in large number of 
debris from both objects.  The U.S. will also notify other 
leading spacefaring nations about the collision through 
diplomatic channels (SEPTEL) and public affairs guidance will 
be made available to all overseas 
Posts. 
 
(SBU) The U.S. follows safe practices for the operation and 
disposal of spacecraft, upon the end of their useful service 
life, and to mitigate debris that may threaten other 
spacecraft, including manned flight. The U.S. encourages 
other nations to follow the established principles 
outlined in existing treaties and international agreements 
for the peaceful use of outer space. This includes the use of 
best practices, and transparency and confidence building 
measures, which should be conducted on a bilateral and 
multilateral basis, as appropriate. 
 
¶4. (SBU) GUIDANCE REQUEST: The talking points in paragraph 4 
may be used by appropriate senior U.S. officials with 
appropriate Russian government interlocutors.  Washington 
will transmit public affairs guidance for use on an 'if 
asked' basis SEPTEL. 
 
¶5. (SBU) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
 
- U.S. Strategic Command informed the Department of State 
that there was a collision on February 10 involving an active 
U.S. commercial Iridium-33 satellite and an inactive Russian 
satellite (Cosmos 2251) in low Earth orbit. 
 
- U.S. Strategic Command is currently investigating the 
events leading up to the collision, and details may not be 
forthcoming for many days while the analysis of the event 
continues. 
 
- As of late yesterday, the U.S. Air Force's Space 
Surveillance Network was tracking 505 pieces from Cosmos and 
194 pieces from Iridium in two separate debris fields. 
 
 
STATE 00023646  002 OF 002 
 
 
- There is little risk to the International Space Station due 
to orbiting debris from the collision.  However, DoD and NASA 
are conducting further analyses on the risks due to the 
debris. 
 
- The U.S. believes this is an opportunity to pursue 
bilateral transparency and confidence-building measures 
related to our respective military space 
activities/operations. 
 
- Since space is becoming an increasingly congested 
environment, heightened space situational awareness as well 
as international cooperation between governments and industry 
is critical in the future. 
 
- The United States welcomes any information on this event 
that Russia can share to help identify the causes of the 
collision as a first step towards ensuring we can prevent 
similar incidents in the future. 
 
Embassy may additionally draw upon, as appropriate: 
 
- U.S. Strategic Command, regularly notifies users, for 
example, foreign governments and commercial operators, when 
its tracking and analysis identifies a safety-of-flight issue. 
 
-- Such analyses are primarily focused on ensuring safety of 
manned flight and national security missions. 
 
- The U.S. takes its responsibility in the space domain very 
seriously; we have been, and continue to be, proactive in 
identifying potential hazards and taking steps to preserve 
safety of flight in this complex 
environment. 
 
- When the potential for a close approach is identified, 
experts analyze options for avoiding an impact, including the 
possibility of maneuvering a satellite if necessary and 
possible.  The decision to maneuver always rests with the 
satellite operator. 
 
- Tracking data on the debris from this collision will be 
included in the Joint Space Operations Center's Space 
Catalogue - "http://www.Space-track.org" - an unclassified 
U.S. Air Force internet site, within approximately 48-72 
hours after the collision.
