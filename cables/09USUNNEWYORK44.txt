SUBJECT: MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OF THE SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR 
LEBANON TO DISCUSS TRANSITION 
 
REF: GARUCKIS/SIMONOFF 1/21/09 EMAIL 
 
¶1. (U) Summary. The Management Committee of the Special 
Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) met on January 22 to discuss the 
transition from the United Nations International Independent 
Investigation Commission (IIIC) to the STL and to discuss 
other issues. End Summary. 
 
 
Preparations for the Transition 
 
¶2. (SBU) Assistant Secretary General for Legal Affairs Peter 
Taksoe-Jensen briefed the Management Committee on the 
transition in advance of the March 1 STL commencement of 
operations.  UN Legal Counsel Patricia O'Brien, accompanied 
by a UN Department of Safety and Security official, will meet 
with the Registrar and the Dutch Government on January 23 to 
discuss the transition and to work on ensuring security for 
judges, prosecutors, defense and relevant staff.  Judges will 
be appointed by March 1, but most will not take up full-time 
duties until a trial commences.  The Government of Lebanon 
will need to appoint a Deputy Prosecutor by March 1, and this 
individual will reside in The Hague and will need appropriate 
security.  It was also reported that the STL's application to 
participate in the UN's Pension Fund was approved by the 
Fifth Committee and then the General Assembly. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Taksoe-Jensen noted that the UN controller has 
raised concerns regarding proper "checks and balances" over 
STL financial controls before he will agree to transfer the 
remaining funds in the STL Trust Fund to the STL.  The Office 
of Legal Affairs (OLA) will work with the UN controller to 
sort through the issues so that the remainder of the trust 
funds can be released to the STL.  (USD 10 million was 
released before December 31, 2008.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Taksoe-Jensen and the Registrar reported that there 
will be a "low-key" opening ceremony of the STL on March 1 or 
¶2.  The expectation is that Patricia O'Brien will represent 
the Secretary-General and will be joined by the STL 
Registrar, the head of the Dutch Foreign Ministry's 
International Organization Affairs Office and Management 
Committee mission representatives based in The Hague, 
including the Lebanese Ambassador.  The Registrar will 
prepare a brief outline of the proposed event for the 
Management Committee's review, including press arrangements. 
(Note:  The ceremony was OLA's idea, in order to have 
official and public recognition of a very important 
milestone.  According to OLA, IIIC Commissioner and 
soon-to-be Prosecutor Bellemare expressed reservations that 
the ceremony might unduly raise expectations.  Bellemare has 
said that he will not attend the ceremony since he will not 
want to field press inquiries about the investigation. End 
note.) 
 
Other Administrative Issues 
 
¶5. (U) The Management Committee accepted the Registrar's 
recommendation that the STL not participate in the Mobility 
Accord, which is designed to facilitate mobility between 
organizations participating in the UN common system, but 
which could have substantial cost implications. 
 
¶6. (U) The Registrar sought the discretion to spend 
approximately USD 2 million from an expected supplementary 
contribution from Canada. The Management Committee noted that 
any plans to spend above the existing budget would need to be 
reviewed by the Management Committee, probably through a 
supplemental budget request. 
 
¶7. (U) The Office of Legal Affairs reported that the 
Secretary General's last report on the implementation of UN 
Security Council resolution 1757 will be released shortly 
before March 1.  Thereafter, OLA recommends that the STL 
President and Prosecutor brief the Security Council every six 
months, as the STL is not a UN Secretariat body. 
 
¶8. (U) The Management Committee agreed that Canada will serve 
as Vice Chair of the Management Committee.
