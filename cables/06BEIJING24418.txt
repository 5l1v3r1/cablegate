Focus on Balance in the Economy 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Xinhua reported a move away from the emphasis on 
rapid growth rates that dominated previous years, meetings. 
There was increased attention to bringing balance to the 
economy on multiple fronts.  Conference participants 
concluded that China should strengthen its promotion of 
imports and overseas investments to reduce its balance of 
payments surplus.  There were also calls for China to raise 
domestic consumption and to achieve greater balance in 
investment and consumption across different sectors of the 
economy.  Other economic concerns addressed included the 
relatively weak agricultural sector and investment that 
creates a risk of financial market volatility.  The 
government,s major goal is to continue the country,s 
economic growth without experiencing huge boom-busts cycles. 
 
Emphasis on Economic Stability 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zhang Haiyu, Director for the Macroeconomic Policy 
Department of the NDRC,s Institute of Economic System and 
Management, told econoff December 8 that the Central Economic 
Work Conference,s major goals are to continue growing with 
economic stability, but at the same time, preserve resources 
and improve China,s quality of growth.  Specifically, the 
government will continue strengthening its macroeconomic 
controls, promote rural economic development, conserve its 
natural resources, proceed with economic structural reforms, 
promote government administrative reforms, and balance
