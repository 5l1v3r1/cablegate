SUBJECT: Damascus Media Reaction: Lebanon, Syria/Austria (4/5) 
 
¶1.  Summary: Syrian papers reported a statement by President 
Emile Lahoud that his country seeks to maintain best relations 
with Syria, "because this is a permanent option for the interest 
of Lebanon in light of the fraternal Syrian-Lebanese relations." 
Papers also reported President Lahoud's meeting with Ammar 
Moussawi and Mohammad Berjaoui, two leaders in Hizbollah, who 
discussed attempts by some Lebanese parties to target and weaken 
the Lebanese national resistance. 
 
Syrian papers reported statements of the Austrian Ambassador in 
Damascus, Karel Schrmek, underlining Syria's important role and 
position in the region, particularly for Europe. At a celebration 
attended by Syria's Grand Mufti and EU ambassadors in Syria, 
Schrmek, whose country currently heads the EU, stressed the need 
to boost ties between Syria and Europe and to work hard to expand 
the culture of tolerance, amity and peace and prevent any kind of 
extremism. 
 
End of summary.

"Al-Saniora and His Visit to Damascus" 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
The Chief Editor of Al-Iqtissadya, an independent weekly, 
editorialized (4/2): "What does Al-Saniora's handshake with 
President Asad at the Khartourm Summit mean? Did Al-Saniora want 
to express to the Arab leaders his good intention towards Syria 
and towards Syrian-Lebanese relations...? 
 
"We believe that distinguished Syrian-Lebanese relations should 
be based on mutual respect and demarcation of borders.... Mutual 
respect means, first, the accountability of all those who 
contributed to the hysterical campaign to distort Syria's image 
and deliberately accused Syrian of assassinating Rafik Al-Hariri 
and presented false witnesses to the IIC and urged the UNSC 
resolution to punish Syria for a crime it did not commit. 
 
"The good intention that Al-Saniora marketed at the Khartoum 
summit, and might market soon in Damascus, means that the 
international investigation must not be restricted to Lebanese 
victims; it must include investigation of the assassination of 
Syrian labors in Lebanon. There should no distinction between 
Syrian and Lebanese victims.... 
 
"Al-Saniora might come to Damascus tomorrow to discuss 
demarcation of the border, opening embassies and opening a new 
page in bilateral relations. But Al-Saniora will not enjoy 
popular Syrian support because he has not brought the criminals 
who assassinated bilateral relations to court....The Syrian 
people will not forget the blood of Syrian laborers in 
Lebanon.... 
 
"Al-Sanoira has not been neutral for a single day. In addition to 
his position as Prime Minister, he is an employee of Saad 
Al-Hariri, who is trying to use his wealth to prove the 
impossible, namely, that Syria is responsible for his father's 
assassination.... 
 
"Our message to Al-Saniora is that he should not hide in the 
alleys but must appear boldly in public. Lebanon can mend what 
the merchants of war and blood have spoiled.... The chance still 
exists for accountability of those who sabotaged bilateral 
relations...."
