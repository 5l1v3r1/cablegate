REF: STATE 25549 
 
(SBU) Poland will participate in the fifth Plenary Meeting of 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.  On April 
21, Embassy Warsaw--together with representatives from the 
Russian and Dutch Embassies--delivered reftel invitation to 
Szymon Bochenski of the MFA's Security Department, who told 
us that he will attend the conference.  Bochenski indicated 
that he had already passed the invitation to the Ministry of 
Interior and was waiting for a response regarding their 
participation.  He told us that Poland is particularly 
interested in participating in the session on securing public 
events because it will co-host the Euro Cup in 2012. 
Bochenksi added that Polish representatives will probably not 
give a presentation during the meeting.
