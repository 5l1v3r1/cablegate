CONFERENCE ON CHILDREN IN WAR 
 
REF: STATE 12222 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points on February 1 to MFA 
IO DAS-Equivalent Jacques Pellet to convey the U.S. decision 
not/not to participate in the February 5-6 Ministerial 
Conference in Paris entitled "Free the Children from War. 
Poloff explained that the U.S. decision did not/not reflect 
diminished U.S. concern over unlawful or abusive use of 
children in conflict situations.  Poloff stated that the U.S. 
could not endorse the underpinning Conference texts -- both 
the "Paris Commitments" and the "Paris Principles" that the 
former introduce -- due to elements that cross numerous legal 
and policy redlines. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Pellet claimed he understood the U.S. decision and 
that the MFA would study reftel points.  The Conference, he 
repeatedly emphasized, was not intended by the MFA and UNICEF 
to put the U.S. or "other friends" in a difficult situation. 
It aimed rather to garner momentum for the international 
effort against child soldiers, in particular combattants as 
young as 12 or 13.  Moreover, the Conference declaration, the 
so-called "Paris Commitments," was non-binding.  Poloff 
inquired whether France would seek to build on the "Paris 
Commitments" or "Paris Principles" as a staple reference in 
UNGA and UNSC negotations.  Pellet replied that the MFA 
currently had no agenda to that end. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Pellet, while not yet able to provide exact 
participation figures, said France and co-organizer UNICEF 
anticipated at least 14 attendees of ministerial rank, 
including Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei 
Denisov.  The PRC would be represented at ambassadorial 
level.  UN Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour and ICC 
Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo would also attend; Pellet 
found Moreno-Ocampo's presence especially appropriate given 
that the ICC was now launching a watershed trial involving 
the recruitment of child-soldiers.  Pellet was pleased that 
Sierra Leone, DRC and Sri Lanka were sending senior-level 
representatives. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Pellet closed by reminding Poloff of FM 
Douste-Blazy's personal commitment to the issue of 
child-soldiers.
