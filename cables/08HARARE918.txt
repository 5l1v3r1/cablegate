On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Tsvangirai Suspends Talks...  Prime minister designate and MDC-T 
president Morgan Tsvangirai suspended ministerial talks with ZANU-PF 
on October 9, citing the need for the reengagement of mediator and 
former South African president, Thabo Mbeki.  Tsvangirai also called 
for the involvement of SADC and the AU to reaffirm their commitment 
as the deal's guarantors.  Tsvangirai made clear that the MDC-T 
intends to negotiate the division of ministries collectively, as he 
disputed that only Finance and Home Affairs were still being 
contested.  A statement released yesterday by Tsvangirai charges 
ZANU-PF with negotiating in bad faith and using hate speech, 
political discrimination, and trumped-up charges to divide the 
country.  See Harare 915. 
 
¶4.  Teachers Unions Call for Cancellation of Exams...  Both the 
Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) and the Zimbabwe 
Teachers' Association called for the cancellation of public 
examinations this year because students are unprepared following a 
two month teacher's strike, lack of materials, and disruptions 
caused by elections-related violence.  Cancelling the exams would 
force several million children to repeat the school year.  "For the 
record, there was no meaningful learning and teaching in 2008 and 
all examination classes are not prepared," Takavafira Zhou, leader 
of the PTUZ, told journalists. 
 
¶5.  Mock Hostage Situation on YouTube...  A new five minute video 
simulating a hostage situation of prominent Zimbabwean officials wa 
recently posted to YouTube.  The morbidly humorus video ends with 
the beheading of a cardboard ut-out of Gideon Gono after a litany

of charges against him are raised.  The "Survivor-style" show will 
accept internet votes on who should be beheaded next from a cast 
including Mugabe, Mbeki, Mutambara, Chihuri, and Chiwenga.  Go to

On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Inflation Gallops--Even By Official Standards...  According to 
The Herald of October 9, Zimbabwe's year-on-year rate of inflation 
rose sharply from just over 11 million percent in June to 231 
million percent in July 2008, with the month-on-month rate rising 
from 839.3 percent to a massive 2,600 percent over the same period. 
According to the Central Statistical Office, bread and cereals were 
the main drivers of inflation in July as producers had to rely on 
importing the ingredients. 
 
¶7.  Zimbabwe Dollar Depreciates Sharply Despite New Policies...  The 
local currency continued to depreciate massively on the parallel 
market despite Gono's policies of suspending all bank transfers to 
curtail parallel market activities.  People quickly replaced bank 
transfers with checks and, as of October 9, the unofficial Zimbabwe 
dollar check rate had depreciated by over 99.9 percent from 
Z$70:US$1 on August 1 to US$3,500,000:US$1 while the cash rate fell 
by 99.9 percent from Z$15:1 to Z$12,000 :US$1 over the same period. 
 
¶8.  Dire Payment Situation, a Further Blow to the Economy... 
Hyperinflation is rapidly eroding the value of the new Z$20,000 note 
introduced recently to quell unrest over cash availability. The 
suspension of inter-bank transfers on October 3, cash shortages, the 
low purchasing power of cash, plus empty shelves that render debit 
cards in local currency useless have all exacerbated the payment 
situation.  In light of the lag in clearing checks, vendors who 
accept checks are likely to jack up their prices faster than ever. 
For their part, banks anticipate that their outdated check clearing 
systems will be unable to handle the expected volume of checks.  See 
Harare 914. 
 
¶9.  Macroeconomic Instability Undermines Export Competitiveness... 
Our response to a USITC request details the deteriorating road, rail 
transport, electric power generation and distribution, and 
telecommunications networks in Zimbabwe.  Despite these limitations, 
firms regarded Zimbabwe's macroeconomic instability as the greatest 
constraint on their export competitiveness.  See Harare 898. 
 
¶10.  ZSE Scaling New Heights...  Activity on the Zimbabwe Stock 
Exchange continues to soar despite significant falls in most world 
markets due to the current credit crunch.  Although there was a lull 
following the lopping off of 10 zeros on August 1, and the reduction 
in the payment period from 7 to 3 days, the market has rebounded 
since then.  The recent suspension of bank transfers in preference 
for checks has driven up prices to reflect the time required for 
checks to clear.  As a result, the benchmark industrial index rose 
by a whopping 5,127,920 percent between August 1 and October 9, 
while the mining index rose by 5,080,116 percent over the same 
period.

Quote of the Week 
----------------- 
 
¶11.  Zimbabwe Independent columnist Chido Makunike in an article 
published this week.  "ZANU-PF is a revolutionary party. When it 
wants to eat its own children, it will just accuse them of smelling 
like goats."
