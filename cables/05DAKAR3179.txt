SUBJECT: GUINEA-BISSAU: GOVERNMENT'S STEPS AND MISSTEPS 
WITH DEADLINES UNMET AND STRIKES PROMISED 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (SBU) The Government budget and program presentation 
to the National Popular Assembly (ANP) has been postponed 
until January.  The Supreme Court's decision on the 
constitutionality of President Vieira's naming Aristides 
Gomes as Prime Minister has also been delayed.  The 
government workers and teachers unions promise to strike 
in January if back wages are not paid and work conditions 
improved.  The ANP passed a "democracy tax" while the 
Prime Minister discounted the importance of municipal 
elections.  Against this backdrop, the National Democratic 
Institute (NDI) plans to begin its parliamentary training 
program in January.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DEADLINES UNMET 
--------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) The government budget and program were to have 
been presented to the ANP by December 19 so that a vote 
could be taken by the end of the parliamentary session on 
December 21.  Instead the Prime Minister requested that 
the ANP hold an extraordinary session between Christmas 
and New Year's Day, only to announce a few days later that 
the documents would be presented for ANP deliberations 
beginning January 9.  By December 19, the Supreme Court 
was to have ruled on the African Party for the 
Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde's (PAIGC's) 
complaint concerning the constitutionality of the 
President Vieira's naming Aristides Gomes as Prime 
Minister.  Vieira's lawyers, however, had not even 
presented their arguments by the Court's decision 
deadline.  Vague promises to proceed and render a decision 
"by next week" were made.  In what could be perceived as a 
threat to the Supreme Court, the Prime Minister stated, 
"There will be an earthquake in Guinea-Bissau if the 
Supreme Court cancels the presidential decree that 
appointed me to be the Prime Minister." 
 
GOVERNMENT STEPS AND MISSTEPS 
----------------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) In addition to the disturbing statement Gomes 
made about a negative decision by the Supreme Court, he 
also stated municipal elections "were not a priority" now 
because the country is in an "abnormal" political- 
institutional situation.  He condemned the "extreme 
personalization" of politics in Guinea-Bissau while 
singling out former Prime Minister Carlos Domingos Gomes, 
Junior (Cadogo), stating he "pretends he is the leading 
politician in the country, but he is wrong." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Meanwhile, the ANP President, Francisco Benante, 
continues to refuse to allow replacements for the six ANP 
members who joined the Cabinet (four PAIGC, one PRS, and 
one PUSD) to take their seats.  According to Benante and 
his interpretation of parliamentary rules, the six could 
not be replaced because they had been suspended by their 
parties for joining the Forum de Convergencia de 
Desenvolvimento (Forum for Development  or FCD).  The 
Government wants the six seats filled because they need 
the votes to assure passage of the budget and program.  A 
group of lawyers from the FCD is filing a suit with the 
Supreme Court over the constitutionality of Benante's 
position. 
 
¶5.  (U) The ANP managed to pass only one piece of 
legislation in the month-long session that ended December 
¶21.  Instead of relying on the international community for 
funding, the ANP passed a "democracy tax" meant to allow 
the Government to fund elections in Guinea-Bissau. 
 
STRIKES PROMISED 
---------------- 
¶6.  (SBU) UNTG (the government workers' union) and 
 
DAKAR 00003179  002 OF 002 
 
 
Sinaprof (the teachers' union) have both announced strikes 
for January.  UNTG claims the new work schedule puts an 
undue burden on employees who now have extra 
transportation and meal expenses associated with having to 
return to work in the afternoon after a 2.5-hour lunch 
break.  The Government has still not managed to pay all 
outstanding teachers' salaries although the Minister of 
Finance has stated that all arrears will be paid before 
Christmas.  In PolOff's discussions with the Presidents of 
both unions, they complained of the government's 
unwillingness to engage in dialogue and preference to rule 
by decree. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶7.  (SBU) Some of the budget and program delays can be 
attributed to the holidays, but reluctance to make 
difficult decisions also seems be plaguing all three 
branches and to have put the brakes on the initial 
momentum the Gomes government had.  Without the six votes 
that Benante is holding hostage, it is unlikely the 
Government would get the necessary majority for approval. 
The current political situation may deteriorate due to the 
inability of the various factions to attempt, let alone 
reach, any compromise.  Instead of engaging in 
constructive dialogue and relinquishing any ground to the 
opposite side, the disaffected rush to the Supreme Court 
for a ruling to resolve differences.  Mission is hopeful 
that NDI's parliamentary training program, which is 
scheduled to begin in January, may assist the ANP and 
civil society to focus on priorities and common interests. 
While the military is unlikely to intervene at this time, 
unless the political leaders in and outside the government 
can begin to work together and put personal differences 
and egos aside, it is not difficult to imagine dispute 
resolution by force of arms, as has been Bissau-Guineans' 
practice in the past.  END COMMENT.
