Since French political parties have recently begun attempting 
to push more minority candidates to the forefront, Mr. 
Kanuty's experience witnessing race relations in the U.S. and 
talking with Americans about such topics would be invaluable 
in demonstrating the extent of similar successes that can be 
had in France as well as the actions that should be avoided. 
Mr. Kanuty is in, and likely will be more prominent in, 
positions where he can disseminate his ideas and what he has 
learned. If the opportunity is taken now, he can be a great 
aid in helping others in France, especially among the minority 
and politically left communities, to have a greater 
appreciation for U.S. policy and goals.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Pierre Kanuty has all the ideal characteristics of a candidate 
for this program. He is young, an ethnic minority, an expert 
in the field of International Relations, and holds a prominent 
position in the Socialist Party. Mr. Kanuty has shown an 
interest in politics since his university years when he 
concentrated his studies on history, political science, and 
communication in politics. As part of his research during this 
time, he wrote one of his papers on the Affirmative Action 
program in the United States and another on the early years of 
the Clinton presidency. Afterwards, he lost no time putting 
what he had learned at the university to good use and, in 
1998, he entered into the executive bureau of the Movement of 
Young Socialists. In 2002, he was able to use this experience 
to obtain a job involving greater responsibilities within the 
Socialist Party.  In his current position, he is charged with 
making the goals and ideologies of the Socialist Party 
understandable to others by editing, on the internet, 
documents and papers that explain the party's official stance 
on important issues. Due to his background and specialization, 
he focuses especially on those documents dealing with foreign 
policy issues. 
Mr. Kanuty is a rising star in the Socialist Party and is 
currently their webmaster and communications expert for 
subjects dealing with international relations. It is expected 
that his experience in these positions, combined with his 
strong qualifications, will translate into his becoming a 
member of a ministerial cabinet or even a European deputy 
should the Socialists regain power. Even if they do not come 
to hold the primary position in French politics, Mr. Kanuty, 
due to his aforementioned skills as well as his close ties to 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the former Minister for European 
Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, will become a leading member of the 
party and someone capable of influencing party position. His 
participation in an IV Program in the United States could have 
the effect both of making him more understanding of U.S. 
policy, as well as to some extent influencing his party as a 
whole either via his web-based work or his almost certain 
future advancements. 
Being part of an IV Program in the U.S. would lead to Pierre 
Kanuty's better understanding of U.S. foreign policy, thereby 
impacting his work in the Socialist Party. This is important 
because the political left in France is not traditionally very 
sympathetic to U.S. policy and the more they are offered 
opportunities to personally interact with the United States, 
the more understanding they may become. Furthermore, as a 
minority candidate, his participation in a program in the U.S. 
could broaden his knowledge of, and give him some practical 
experience with, the American approach to race relations.

In his capacity as the chief of the UDF party's foreign 
relations committee, nominee is a key player in determining 
the positions taken by the party and party leader Francois 
Bayrou on U.S. issues.  (Bayrou, incidentally, is a perennial 
contender for the presidency and, though the leader of a 
smaller party, he enjoys considerable credibility among the 
public at large.)  In this time of widespread French public 
disapproval of the U.S., it is particularly important that 
those who shape political parties' positions on the U.S. 
understand well both the goals and the making of U.S. foreign 
policy.  Providing for a political party's better 
understanding of U.S. foreign policy can have a multiplier 
effect on the French public's understanding of the U.S. -- 
which is a key MPP Public Affairs objective.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Nominee is among the rising stars of the UDF party, a 
centrist, Europe-focused party likely to benefit from deep 
divisions on the right (UMP) and lack of strong leadership on 
the left (PS).  Mr. Erhard has the confidence of party leader 
Francois Bayrou, who recently chose Erhard -- at the young age 
of 34 - to act both as Bayrou's Chief of Staff and as chairman 
the party's foreign affairs committee, a position that brings 
with it a seat on the party's executive committee.  It is 
clearly a U.S. interest that those with policy-development 
responsibilities, in centrist political parties focused on 
supporting continued European integrations (like the UDF), 
have a good understanding of the U.S. and the reasons for our 
foreign policy positions.

We would like Mr. Martinez to begin to further understand the 
fundamental pressures and the checks and balances inherent in 
democracy as it is practiced in the U.S.  We want him to 
experience first-hand the vitality of US civic life, the role 
of local associations, and the relationships between various 
ethnic communities in order to understand the way 
representative government in the U.S. differs from France. We 
would also like him to develop a greater appreciation for the 
benefits of public-private partnerships in economic 
development (less governmental intervention and more reliance 
on private initiatives). Fundamentally, we think that in the 
future when he will obtain more influential elected positions, 
he will be a more effective partner for U.S. leaders and be 
more open to American investment, if he understands us better.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
At the age of 35, Manuel Martinez has already had a successful 
professional career in business and politics. As Director of 
Human resources at Hermes, a prestigious and well-known luxury 
firm, he has earned a position of great responsibility in a 
major company where he directly supervises 600 people and 
indirectly oversees 2400 people worldwide. In addition to his 
business savvy, Manuel Martinez has also shown a strong 
interest in politics since his teenage years. In his early 
twenties he joined the Socialist Party, become an elected 
municipal official at 26, and a deputy mayor of Montreuil, a 
Parisian suburb, at 29. In the 2004 elections, he defeated the 
Communist candidate to be elected to the General Council of 
Seine-Saint Denis department in a district where the Communist 
Party has never lost. In addition to this new role, he 
continues on as Deputy Mayor of Montreuil: the third largest 
town in the Paris suburbs (90,000 inhabitants) with a large 
immigrant population and a long industrial history. Although 
his town is changing and now attracts more service-oriented 
industries and more middle-class inhabitants, it still has 
more than 2,800 firms employing 37,500 people. As a result of 
his educational and professional background, Manuel Martinez 
purposely chose to be active in the economic development of 
his hometown. 
Manuel Martinez aims to be the next mayor of Montreuil in the 
upcoming 2008 elections. The Socialist Party has a very real 
chance of winning this time since the town is becoming less 
industrial, the Communist Party is losing credibility, and the 
current Communist mayor has held this office for what many 
consider to have been far too long. He will also likely be the 
substitute (suppleant) of the runner to the National Assembly. 
In the General Council of Seine-Saint-Denis, a Communist Party 
stronghold, the Socialists also hope to elect more officials 
in the coming years which will means more influential high- 
level positions. If these scenarios do play out, Manuel 
Martinez could reach one of the top positions in the Assembly 
and be very influential in his party. 
Manuel Martinez's previous travels to the United States were 
only for brief periods of time as a tourist or a student 
developing his business skills. It would be advantageous to 
send him at this juncture where he, a future French leader, 
could discover America's political system, its economic 
vitality, and its melting pot culture and history. He would be 
able to draw clear connections with his town of Montreuil and 
its immigrant heritage and in the process develop a clearer 
understanding of and appreciation for American policy. This is 
something he could take home and share with his French and 
immigrant neighbors and as a leader within his party.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Guillaume Ragonnaud is a young and bright person with a strong 
expertise in general farm policy and regulations specific to

education in agriculture, economics and political science, and 
his first professional experience in the largest French 
farmers' union, he is expected to become a highly influential 
advisor to French leaders in agriculture. As he has never been
