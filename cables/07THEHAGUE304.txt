¶1. (SBU) EconCouns conveyed on February 12 reftel nonpaper 
regarding the implementation of UNSCR 1737 to Anne-Chris 
Visser, Senior Advisor, Integrity Division, Dutch Ministry of 
Finance (MOF). EconCouns also delivered the nonpaper to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials Joost van Ettro, Policy 
Officer for terrorist financing issues, Terrorism and New 
Threats Unit, and Huib Mijnarends, Senior Policy Officer 
responsible for sanction issues, also in the Terrorism and 
New Threats Unit. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a February 16 follow-up conversation with 
EconCouns, Visser said she had shared the nonpaper with 
officials at the Dutch Central Bank and the Netherlands 
Authority for Financial Markets.  She said the Dutch were 
largely pleased with the latest draft of the EU's Common 
Position concerning restrictive measures against Iran.  It 
provided the next step in ensuring the adoption of 
regulations providing implementing authorities for UNSCR 1737 
in EU member states, she added.  From a finance perspective, 
she said the MOF had hoped for an agreement on the need for 
more identifiers for persons and entities to ensure better 
implementation within the financial sector.  However, she did 
not foresee any additional steps by the GONL at this juncture.
