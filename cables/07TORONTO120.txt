¶1. (SBU) On March 15 Consul General and Pol/Econ officer met with 
Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant to urge a strengthening of 
intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement.  Bryant said that he 
fully supports prosecuting those who pirate DVDs and CDs and 
confirmed he concurs that profits from mass IPR counterfeiting 
operations help support organized crime, not just mom and pop shops. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bryant acknowledged that resources are an issue, both for 
police and prosecutors.  He confirmed that civil asset forfeiture is 
an option, as far as reimbursing the police for their cost to 
investigate counterfeiters, and he noted the province has begun 
moving more aggressively on civil forfeiture in drug-related cases. 
He acknowledged, however, that the civil forfeiture process was 
complex, requiring the police to conduct the investigation first, 
then formally seek reimbursement for the expended funds, which must 
be budgeted in detail. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bryant concurred that outlawing movie camcording would help 
to push the point of enforcement back from the point of sale, while 
saying that, by and large, Canada's criminal code already is 
adequate to address most IPR violations.  Bryant said he closely 
follows the role of organized crime in IPR violations, and 
frequently mentions the issue in his public addresses. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Bryant told the CG he is interested in participating in 
industry and other organizations' efforts to bring IPR issues to the 
public eye.  He also opined that musicians who encourage free 
downloading of music are contributing to public perceptions that IPR 
violations are not a serious matter. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  We will continue our efforts to raise the profile 
of IPR enforcement concerns with Ontario provincial and municipal 
officials responsible for enforcing and prosecuting IPR violations. 
We plan to seek appointments with Toronto area Police Chiefs to 
encourage them to strengthen efforts.  We will mention to them that 
the civil forfeiture process is one way to recoup enforcement costs, 
particularly against some of the Toronto area's notorious marketers 
of counterfeit goods (described in ref (B)).  End Comment.
