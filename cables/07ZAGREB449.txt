SUBJECT: IRAQI MP EYES CROATIA AS POST-CONFLICT MODEL 
 
REF: Zagreb 422 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT: An Iraqi Member of Parliament and close 
relative of Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, Ms. Ala Talabani, 
visited Croatia April 20-27 in search of a successful post-conflict 
model to further promote human rights, strengthen the role of NGOs, 
and develop women's rights in Iraq.  Accompanied by Areez Mahdi, an 
Erbil-based Woman's Program Coordinator for the National Democratic 
Institute, the visit was part of Croatia's efforts to provide 
development assistance to Iraq. 
 
¶2.  The MFA organized the visit to assist in the strengthening of 
democracy, rule of law, and the promotion of human rights and 
freedoms in Iraq.  Croatia is also treating Iraqi children in a 
local Zagreb hospital, actively participating in training programs 
for Iraqi police officers in Jordan, and remains open to exploring 
other ways to contribute to Iraq's reconstruction (Reftel).  The GOC 
is also, with Embassy Zagreb support, facilitating the participation 
of a delegation of Iraqi lawyers at the International Bar 
Association Leaders Conference May 15-19 in Zagreb.   END COMMENT 
AND SUMMARY 
 
LESSONS LEARNED FROM VUKOVAR 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  At the invitation of the GOC participants traveled to Vinkovci 
and the former UN Protected Enclave of Vukovar to see first hand the 
challenges and successes of these war ravaged towns. While in 
Vukovar participants learned about Croatia's experience in 
reconstruction and postwar reintegration. Participants not only had 
the opportunity to witness first hand the devastation imposed upon 
the city, but also the efforts being undertaken by Mayor Zdenka 
Buljan to promote ethnic reconciliation in a community that is still 
feeling the scars of recent war. 
 
¶4.  Vukovar, as a divided city of Serbs and Croats, left quite an 
impression on participants. Ms. Talabani told Pol Off she was very 
impressed by the mayor of Vukovar. She also expressed her 
encouragement by what she has seen in Croatia in terms of promoting 
democratization and ethnic reconciliation. 
 
CROATIA'S WOMEN POLITICIANS AS A MODEL FOR IRAQ 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5.  During the Zagreb portion of the visit, participants met with 
high level women politicians, ranging from Foreign Affairs Minister 
Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic to United Nations Chair of the Committee to 
Eliminate Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Ambassador Dubravka 
Simonovic. In addition to meeting Croatian Parliament Deputy Speaker 
Djurdja Adlesic, where Talabani discussed the position of women in 
the two countries politics, Talabani also met with the Croatian 
People's Party President, Vesna Pusic and Minister of War Veterans, 
Family Affairs and Inter-generational Solidarity, Jadranka Kosor. 
 
¶6.  The Iraqi Delegation had a full schedule, meeting with 
representatives of the Government Office for Human Rights, 
Ombudsperson for Gender Equality, Ombudsperson for the Rights of 
Children, and numerous NGOs and civil society organizations. After 
receiving copies of Croatia's Law on Gender Equality, the delegation 
was better able to see how Croatia works to include women's issues 
in the political process. 
 
LEGISLATIVE RESEARCH TO FOSTER NGO INDEPENDENCE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7.  In order to further develop her legislative agenda in the Iraqi 
Council of Representatives, Talabani hopes to learn how government 
can successfully interact with NGOs. The GOC, which generally has a 
successful and positive relationship with NGOs, might very well 
provide a useful model for Baghdad in reducing what Talabani 
characterized as a hostile relationship filled with suspicion and 
mistrust.  In addition to extracting lessons that could be used to 
foster NGO independence and build trust, Talabani was also in 
Croatia looking for ideas to help her promote a political parties 
law.
