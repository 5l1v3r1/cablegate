SUBJECT: POSSIBLE FRAUD RING FOR SHAM MARRIAGES 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Post's Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) suspects that Mishel M. 
Kamara, a tax preparer in Maryland, may be arranging sham marriages 
between low income Amcits and Sierra Leoneans solely for the purpose 
of illegal immigration.  Kamara works for MMK Tax Services LLC, 9420 
Annapolis RS, Suite 202, Lanham, MD 20706, Tel: (301) 731-4105. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) While investigating two separate IR1 cases, the FPU noted 
the following similarities between the cases that are unlikely to be 
coincidental: 
 
a) Both petitioners employed Mishal M. Kamara, with MMK Tax Services 
LLC, to prepare their income tax returns. 
 
b) Kamara or someone linked to Kamara introduced the petitioners to 
their Sierra Leonean husbands. 
 
c) Both petitioners are single parents who had extremely low incomes 
that increased dramatically over a period of three years until they 
met the threshold level required for the Affidavit of Support (AOS) 
in 2004, the year the petitions were filed. 
 
d) Both petitioners started working for the same company, Personal 
Nursing Care Agency, after they met their husbands. 
 
e) Both petitioners obtained their first U.S. passports a few months 
before traveling to Sierra Leone to marry husbands they had not 
previously met.  Both petitioners left Sierra Leone shortly after 
their weddings and have not seen their husbands since. 
 
f) Both petitioners were married by Bishop Baughman at the United 
Methodist Church of the Parish of St. Georges in Freetown, Sierra 
Leone.  The marriages took place one day apart, and the marriage 
certificates were registered at the same time. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post suspects that Kamara has arranged these sham 
marriages for the sole purpose of immigration.  While Post plans to 
conduct in-depth interviews of both husbands, one of the husbands 
has already failed to appear for a scheduled interview.  Since 
Kamara's connection can be detected only through petitioner's tax 
returns, it is difficult to identify additional cases that he may 
have facilitated. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post requests that CA/FPP and NVC take appropriate action 
to investigate whether Kamara is arranging additional sham marriages 
solely for the purpose of facilitating illegal immigration.
