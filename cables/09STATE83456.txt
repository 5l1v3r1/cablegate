SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-LICENSE/PRE-SHIPMENT 
END-USE CHECK ON LICENSES 050134369, 050175886, 050175888, 
AND 050175889 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on licenses 050134369, 
050175886, 050175888, and 050175889 for the export of 
firearms to Costa Rica.  Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for Request: A Blue Lantern check in 2000 
found that El Hispano S.A. may import firearms and ammunition 
on behalf of other retail dealers.  Rather than importing 
larger quantities of firearms a few times a year to stock its 
inventory, El Hispano imports smaller quantities of firearms 
more frequently.  This is often done before existing export 
licenses are exhausted.  This check is to obtain more 
information on El Hispano S.A.'s customer base and to 
determine that the company does not/not sell U.S.-origin 
firearms to end-users outside Costa Rica. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request: Export license 050134369 has already 
been shipped to El Hispano S.A. whereas 050175886, 050175888, 
and 050175889 have not yet been shipped.  This request is for 
post to review El Hispano's sales records for the firearms 
exported under licenses 050134369 to determine if the company 
is importing on behalf of other firearms dealers and to 
verify that El Hispano's customers are based in Costa Rica. 
Post is also requested to establish the bona fides of the 
transactions under 050175886, 050175888, and 050175889 by 
making inquiries to representatives of the company and 
appropriate authorities of the Government of Costa Rica.  The 
following points are included for guidance: 
 
(To El Hispano S.A.) 
 
--What products and services does your company provide? Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms? 
 
--To whom will you sell the firearms received under U.S. 
export licenses 050175886, 050175888, and 050175889? 
 
--Please provide sales records for firearms received via U.S. 
export licenses 050134369.  Were any of these 
firearms re-exported to end-users outside Costa Rica?  Have 
you ever re-exported U.S.-origin firearme or other 
U.S.-origin defense articles to end-users outside Costa Rica? 
 
(To Import/Export Authorities and/or Appropriate Law 
Enforcement Officials) 
 
--Is El Hispano S.A. properly authorized to import and sell 
defense articles in Costa Rica? 
 
-- Do you have any records of El Hispano S.A. exporting 
U.S.-origin firearme or other U.S.-origin defense articles to 
end-users outside Costa Rica? 
 
--Do you have any information on El Hispano S.A. that would 
question their reliability as a recipient of U.S. defense 
articles? 
 
In its reply, Post is requested to comment on any other 
information pertinent to these transactions such as security 
of facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities 
involved.
