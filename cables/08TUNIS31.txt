Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  The Ambassador and Minister of Development and 
International Cooperation (MDIC) Jouini discussed substance 
and logistics for the upcoming US-Tunisia TIFA Council (Refs 
A-E) during a meeting on January 8.  Jouini agreed that March 
10-11, 2008 are good dates to conduct the next TIFA Council 
in Tunis.  Both parties agreed that the focus of this Council 
should be in-depth discussions on market access, intellectual 
property rights, investment, and services.  They also agreed 
it was important to also include a private sector component 
in the program and the Ambassador said that he would discuss 
this issue with relevant parties.  Jouini also expressed an 
interest in possibly attending the upcoming US-Middle East 
and North Africa Trade and Investment Conference in Jordan on 
February 10-11.  They discussed a trade and investment 
promotion tour of the United States some time in the late 
Spring or early Fall.   The Ambassador also advocated for 
Boeing,s proposal for Tunisair,s aircraft replenishment. 
End Summary.

Logistics

¶2. (SBU)  Jouini told the Ambassador that he prefers that the 
next TIFA Council take place on March 10-11 in Tunis with 
the working groups meeting on March 10 and a plenary session 
on March 11.  Separate meetings can be set up for AUSTR 
Donnell with relevant GOT officials on March 10. 
 
--------- 
Substance 
--------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The Ambassador asked Jouini if there were any 
particular issues that he would like to put on the agenda or 
particular outcomes that he would like to aim for during the 
TIFA Council meeting.  Jouini noted that the second TIFA 
Council held in June 2005 created working groups which were 
to work on progress in the following four areas: 
 
-          Services 
-          Intellectual Property Rights 
-          Investment 
-          Market Access 
 
Unfortunately, the working groups have yet to meet.  Thus, 
Jouini would like to have in-depth discussions on these four 
areas during the upcoming TIFA Council.  He expressed hope 
that each of the four working groups will begin dialogue 
immediately and be able to make some progress by the March 
TIFA Council Meeting.  Jouini is looking to come out of this 
Council with a clearer vision of where the US-Tunisian 
bilateral economic relationship is headed and agreement on 
how we can work together to advance the relationship and 
achieve common goals.  Jouini said that the meeting will be 
useful for both sides in order to get the TIFA process back 
on track.  For him the process is as important as the 
substance since it sends good signals to the private sector 
and to other interested parties (nfi).  While the proceedings 
should involve mostly government-to-government discussions, 
the Ambassador and Jouini agreed that there should also be a 
private sector component.  The hope is that members of the 
private business community from each side would come in and 
present their views on the pratical implications of the 
 
TUNIS 00000031  002 OF 003 
 
 
Council's agenda items during this portion of the program. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
There's a Need to Inform and Listen 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Jouini said that Tunisia is in the process of 
making reforms in many areas and knows that it needs to make 
progress in other areas.  Jouini said that USTR and the USG 
need to know what Tunisia has done and what it plans to do 
during the next development cycle.  Lamenting that the rising 
cost of energy was going to make accomplishing the goals 
outlined in the Eleventh Development Plan 2007-2016 (Ref F) 
difficult, Jouini said that the Tunisia also needs to hear 
the USG views on what the GOT is doing.  The Ambassador 
suggested that the GOT might offer a presentation explaining 
the Eleventh Development Plan, its goals and orientations on 
the TIFA Council agenda.  Jouini agreed and added that even 
though this TIFA Council would not be a negotiation, per se, 
it should be considered a preparation for some type of 
agreement, even if not an FTA.  Both Jouini and the 
Ambassador agreed that this TIFA Council should focus on the 
four main areas but that the targeted outcome should be an 
agreement on how to approach individual issues and how to 
resolve differences. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
BCIU US-MENA Trade and Investment Conference 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Jouini expressed interest in the Business Council 
for International Understanding (BCIU) US - Middle East North 
Africa (MENA) Trade and Investment Conference scheduled in 
Jordan on February 10-11.  He indicated that either he or his 
Secretary of State Abdelhamid Triki may attend the 
 
SIPDIS 
conference.  He was interested in learning more about the 
agenda and what ministers from other countries will attend. 
The Ambassador requested that Jouini let him know who from 
Tunisia would attend as soon as possible and said that we 
would provide him with additional information as it becomes 
available. 
 
-------------------- 
Possible GOT Mission 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The Ambassador suggested that Jouini consider 
reaching out to the business community throughout the United 
States in order to promote and create trade relationships. 
Collaboration with groups such as the World Affairs Council 
of Dallas-Ft. Worth, the Wyoming State Partnership Program, 
Tunisian American Chamber of Commerce (TACC), and the 
National US-Arab Chamber of Commerce was put forth as a means 
to develop US-Tunisian trade.  Jouini agreed that it was a 
good idea to travel and reach out to regions outside of 
Washington, D.C.  He said that it would be good to follow-up 
the March TIFA Council by sending a GOT trade mission to the 
United States in late spring (June) or early fall.  The 
Ambassador said that the key for a successful mission is to 
look for US companies that would be a good match for Tunisia 
and use them as a foundation on which to build cooperative 
trade relationships.  Stating that this is the approach that 
Tunisia has taken with Germany and France, Jouini said that 
he would welcome our advice on US cities and business 
communities that Tunisia should reach out to.  Jouini 
highlighted Microsoft as a good example of a partnership that 
is beneficial for both sides.  (Note:  During the Microsoft 
Government Leaders Forum in South Africa July 11-12, 2006 the 
GOT and the Microsoft Corporation signed a partnership 
agreement that provides for Microsoft investment in training, 
research, and development, but also commits the GOT to using 
licensed Microsoft software.  Ref G.  End Note.)  Jouini 
indicated that Microsoft is planning to install a technical 
platform in Tunisia.

Advocacy - Boeing 
----------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU)  The Ambassador encouraged Jouini to ensure that 
Boeing's submission responding to Tunisair's aircraft 
replenishment tender be given due consideration and that the 
competition be open and fair.  Jouini said that while the GOT 
will be looking to get the best deal and partnership that it 
can out of this competition between Boeing and Airbus, the 
bid review process will be open and fair.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU)  The meeting was fruitful and very positive.  Our 
next steps should be to build on this momentum and encourage 
the four working groups to begin a regular dialogue on their 
respective issues.  The working groups should flesh out and 
prepare for the TIFA Council agenda items and areas in which 
concrete progress can be achieved and areas that require 
further discussion.  End Comment.
