¶1.  (SBU) On May 29, EconCouns discussed Ref A points, urging Ecuador 
to vote in the June 3 vote on Kosovo's membership in the World Bank, 
with Ambassador Lourdes Puma, Director General for Multilateral 
Affairs in the Foreign Ministry.  Puma said that participating in the 
vote would be implicit recognition of Kosovo's status as an 
independent country, and Ecuador is awaiting a ruling by the 
International Court of Justice in the Hague before taking a position 
on Kosovo's independence (Ref B).  When asked directly if Ecuador 
would vote on Kosovo's World Bank membership request, Puma said that 
would be unlikely, and that if Ecuador were to vote it would vote 
"no." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) EconCouns sought to discuss this matter with Under 
Secretary of Public Credit at the Ministry of Finance, but the Under 
Secretary was unavailable.
