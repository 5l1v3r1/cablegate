Â¶1. (SBU) On November 19, DCM and French Deputy Head of Mission 
Vincent Floreani delivered reftel demarche to Mohammed Rashed Al 
Absi, Deputy Director of International Organizations at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs.  Al Absi asked several questions about the 
current assessment scale and associated discount and joked that it 
was UAEG "policy" to contribute more than its obligation to 
international causes.  He said he would be in contact with the UAE's 
UN delegation but offered no substantive response.
