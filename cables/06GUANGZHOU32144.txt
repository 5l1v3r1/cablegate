SUBJECT: U.S.-China Bilateral on Margins of Seventh North Pacific 
Coast Guard Forum, Sanya, China, October 25: Coast Guard Vice 
Admiral and PRC Maritime Safety Administration Deputy Director 
General Li Qingping 
 
(U) This document is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Vice Admiral Wurster, Commander of the Coast Guard's 
Pacific Area, told Deputy Director General Li Qingping of the 
Maritime Safety Administration (under the Ministry of 
Communications), at an October 25 bilateral meeting on the margins 
of the Seventh North Pacific Coast Guard Forum that the U.S. wanted 
to partner with China on projects relating to safety, security and 
environmental protection that had been tabled at the September 2006 
International Maritime Organization meeting in Kuala Lumpur.  The 
U.S. and China, the Admiral said, had a vested interest in the 
success of the IMO programs, especially as they applied to the 
Straits of Malacca. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to the Admiral's question, DDG Li said that 
China supported three programs in particular, all of which required 
some training and data exchange: 
 
-- The replacement and maintenance of navigational aids that had 
been damaged after the tsunami in December 2004; 
 
-- Availability of real time data on tides, wind and currents in the 
Singapore Strait; and 
 
-- The handling of hazardous noxious substances in the seas. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Admiral Wurster said that these were the same three areas 
in which the U.S. was interested.  Details, he suggested, could be 
discussed at the December Tripartite Technical Experts Group (TTEG), 
and he expressed hope that the U.S and China could work together to 
support the Littoral states of Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. 
In response to DDG Li's statement that he was not aware of the TTEG, 
Admiral Wurster designated Coast Guard Liaison in Beijing Captain 
Bernard Moreland and Commander Raras, on his staff,, as the USG 
points of contact for exchanging information on TTEG maters.  DDG Li 
designated Mr. Song and Mr. Li as the Chinese contacts.  DDG Li 
added that it was important for both sides to work on the safety of 
maritime transport in the Straits of Malacca, but also noted that 
this was an important responsibility of the Littoral states as well. 
 Admiral Wurster agreeQat those states had key responsibilities, 
but emphasized the critical nature of the U.S. and China in 
extending a "helping hand" to ensure success.  He concluded that we 
looked forward to working with China to find ways to extend that 
"helping hand."
