¶1. (SBU) On June 3, Poloff visited the offices of Junsdom Solutions 
in North York, Ontario as instructed by reftel to meet with Peter 
Hou, sales representative.  The North York office of Junsdom systems 
is located in a rental house in a quiet suburban neighborhood north 
of downtown Toronto.  According to Mr.Hou, all Canada-based 
activities of the firm occur at the North York location.  Mr. Hou is 
Canadian Landed Immigrant (permanent resident) and holds a Taiwan 
passport. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Hou described the S-band radar equipment scheduled to be 
consigned to the Chung Shan Institute of Technology as a normal 
order for his firm.  Hou indicated that he was familiar with the 
regulations pertaining to the use of dual-use articles, and that 
Junsdom placed great emphasis on complying with USG regulations. 
Hou also provided Poloff with a list of transactions from calendar 
year 2007.  The majority were for radar based equipment purchased on 
behalf of the Chung Shan Institute by Evergo Co., a Taiwan company. 
A typical transaction involved Chung Shan placing an order with 
Evergo, who in turn contracts Junsdom to source the product from 
North American suppliers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Hou said that the articles were then shipped to him in 
North York, before being shipped to Taiwan by Fedex.  Orders 
typically did not remain in his possession for more than 24 hours. 
Larger items were delivered directly to a freight forwarder for 
further shipment to Taiwan.  While in his possession, all articles 
were stored in an alarmed room in the basement of his house (NOTE: 
The room also functions as a study and recreation room for his 
teenage daughter. END NOTE). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Hou described Junsdom as a small company with good 
connections in Taiwan.  His boss, Hsu-Chi Liao, is a dual 
Taiwan-Canadian citizen who splits his time between the two 
countries.  To Hou's knowledge, the company does not/not have any 
subsidiaries in the PRC, nor does it do business with mainland China 
companies. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: Poloff and Toronto ICE attach subsequently 
conducted several internet searches on Junsdom Solutions and related 
phone numbers contained in the DSP-5, which indicate that Junsdom 
may have an office in Shenyang, PRC.  Toronto ICE attach has 
coordinated with the ICE field office responsible for Nashua, New 
Hampshire to establish contact with the home office of the 
manufacturer, the Ferrite Company.  Post has also asked the Canadian 
Border Service Agency Customs section to query their files for 
potential derogatory information regarding Junsdom Solutions.  We 
will forward any additional information received from Canadian 
sources to PM/DTC and ICE.  END COMMENT.
