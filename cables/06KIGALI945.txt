Press Release 
 
Today in its extraordinary session, cabinet met and decided 
that the Rwandan Defense Forces currently serving under 
African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) in Darfur, Sudan 
continue to do so until December 31, 2006. 
 
After 31 December 2006, the Government of Rwanda's decision 
to continue with the intervention will depend on the 
necessary clear framework that will have resulted from the 
agreed course of action reached between the United Nations, 
the government of Sudan as well as the African Union in line 
with United Nations Resolution 1706 and the 20th of September 
2006 AU communique of the African Peace and Security Council 
summit held in New York. 
 
Rwanda remains committed to maintaining her troops in Darfur 
to contribute to the return of peace in Darfur, Sudan as long 
as conditions allow the fulfillment of the mission entrusted 
to the troops. 
 
Done in Kigali this 28th day of September 28, 2006
