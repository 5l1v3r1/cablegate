¶1. (U) Although Turkey has now passed two major stimulus 
packages (see reftels), neither contained any major 
initiatives on green investment.  Despite some expectation 
that they would include tax incentives for automotive firms 
researching clean technologies and retail tax incentives for 
consumers purchasing green vehicles, neither proposal made it 
into the legislation. The upcoming third package is expected 
to focus on credit guarantees and temporary VAT cuts to spur 
consumption. 
 
¶2. (U) The GOT did grant an amnesty on taxes and fines for 
people who trade-in vehicles older than 30 years for a new 
car, partially with the intent of removing high-emission 
vehicles from the road, but more as a means to spur new car 
purchases.  The success of this plan has been limited, for 
reasons outlined in Ref C.  More successful has been the 
temporary removal of the special consumption tax on new 
vehicles (Ref D), which has sparked a sharp uptick in new 
vehicle sales and will tangentially help replace older 
vehicles with newer, low-emission models.  Again, the goal 
was less to help the environment than to spur the automotive 
industry, and if there is a net gain in overall cars on the 
road the emissions picture may actually worsen.
