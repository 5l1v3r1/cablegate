SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE, JANUARY 13, 1700 HRS 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 100 
 
¶1. (SBU) Kerem Shalom was the only crossing open between Gaza 
and Israel on January 14, except for limited humanitarian 
evacuations through Erez.  Kerem Shalom transferred 102 
truckloads of humanitarian supplies, including three tankers 
of diesel destined for Gaza hospital generators.  The GOI's 
Joint Coordination Room (JCR) expects Kerem Shalom to handle 
roughly the same number of trucks on January 15.  In 
addition, the Karni grain conveyor belt is expected to be 
open; Karni was closed for security reasons all day January 
¶14.  The JCR is working with UNWRA to move 25 truckloads of 
cargo through the Erez crossing on January 15.  Previous 
efforts at using Erez for cargo shipments had to be called 
off because the IDF had not given UNWRA enough lead time to 
organize convoys to pick up the goods on the Gaza side. 
Tomorrow will be a test case to see whether this problem has 
been resolved.  The Nahal Oz fuel crossing remained closed 
today, but there is still fuel to be picked up on the Gaza 
side.  JCR does not expect Nahal Oz to be open tomorrow. 
(Comment: Despite the JCR's efforts to improve coordination 
and increase crossing throughput, best estimates are that no 
more than 180 truckloads of supplies per day will enter Gaza 
for the foreseeable future; the minimum requirement to meet 
basic needs is around 200 truckloads per day.  End Comment.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Coordination difficulties that had stymied ICRC and 
GOI efforts to ensure repair of the Beit Lahiya sewage lagoon 
appeared to have been resolved as of January 14, though we 
will not know whether all the repairs have been completed 
until late evening.  As of 1700 hours local, the tanker and 
tractor needed to take fuel to the sewage pumps had not yet 
arrived.  JCR chief Baruch Spiegel told EconCouns he believes 
these repairs are a top priority, and if they cannot be done 
by the Gazan operator, will have to be done by IDF engineers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As of 1700 hours local, 12 rockets had been fired 
from Gaza into southern Israel, including a couple of Grads 
that hit Be'ersheva and Ashdod; 17 rockets were fired 
yesterday. No casualties were reported from these attacks. 
The trend in rocket attacks is sharply downward as IDF forces 
continue to take out launch sites and destroy rocket 
stockpiles.  IDF spokesman's office announced late afternoon 
that nine launch sites, including some underground sites, and 
a stockpile of 20 rockets in a private residence in Gaza City 
had been destroyed on January 14. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy is encouraging COGAT to consider using Kerem 
Shalom for evacuation of foreign nationals from southern 
Gaza, in order to provide a full range of options for the 
U.S., Egypt and Israel in arranging evacuation.  Initial 
response has been encouraging and we are working the issue up 
the COGAT chain of command.  DCM will raise with JCR chief 
Spiegel at a meeting afternoon of January 15. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COGAT confirmed to Emboff on January 14 that it had 
approved transfer of NIS 20 million and USD 16 million in 
cash through Erez to cover UNWRA salaries and cash support 
programs.  COGAT is working with UNWRA on delivery logistics; 
the transfer could take place as early as January 16.  A 
larger amount, to cover World Bank program needs, is still 
under consideration, as is the Palestinian Monetary 
Authority's request for NIS 243 million to cover PA salaries 
and arrears in Gaza.
