NOT INTIMIDATED

¶1. (SBU) Summary:  School officials in Said Abad 
told PRToffs on February 11 that despite threats 
from "those opposed to education" they were 
determined to keep the co-educational school open. 
According to the provincial education office, over 
the past 16 months 18 schools throughout Helmand 
Province have been burned; 66 (about 25 percent) are 
currently closed. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The PRT visited Said Abad school to discuss 
upcoming construction of a security wall around the 
school's perimeter.  The school is located in 
southern Nad Ali district, about 30 kilometers 
southwest of Lashkar Gah.  Built about three years 
ago with United Nations support, the school has 
about 900 students, 40 percent of whom are girls. 
Most students are of the Hazara ethnic minority, 
which views education as a top priority.  About 15 
percent are Pashtun.  No Pashtun girls attend the 
school, however, which goes up to grade 10. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Officials said that, over the past six 
months, "anti-education elements" have threatened 
the headmaster, Assadullah Karima, a number of 
times.  On several occasions, they even drove up to 
the school during the day.  (Note:  Normally, most 
intimidation takes the form of "night letters," 
warning officials and teachers to stay away from 
school. End Note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Assadullah said that the school was 
grateful for the PRT's attention and its support for 
the perimeter security wall, which would send a 
signal to potential attackers as well as enhancing 
the school's overall security.  One negative impact 
of the general deterioration of security is that 
teachers who were attending the Lashkar Gah teacher 
training college for recertification have been 
forced to stop due to the danger for women traveling 
on the road. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Headmaster Assadullah said that he is very 
much looking forward to the UK and Afghan National 
Army deployment.  He asked the PRT to ensure that 
the security forces appear at least monthly in the 
area.  He vowed to keep the school open. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In an impromptu discussion in a girls' 
ninth grade class, the students told PRToffs that 
they are grateful for the opportunity to attend 
school.  During the Taliban times, students engaged 
in clandestine studies at home, a risky proposition. 
Despite the occasional threats, the girls said that 
they were hopeful that their education would 
continue.  Several voiced ambitions to become 
engineers or doctors. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The atmosphere around the school was 
positive.  Despite the modest building, which did 
not appear well constructed with only the most basic 
materials, students and staff were engaged.  In the 
case of Said Abad, the community and school have 
 
KABUL 00000693  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
come together to protect what they have achieved. 
It is likely that there are many schools facing the 
same threats as Said Abad.  Whether they will be 
able to stand up to this increasing intimidation 
remains an open question.
