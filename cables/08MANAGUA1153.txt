REF: A. STATE 90978 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 1124 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Robert Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) On September 8, Ambassador Callahan delivered ref A 
demarche to Foreign Minister Samuel Santos after informing 
him that the visit of Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez had 
been cancelled.  Ambassador emphasized our surprise at the 
decision, stressing that recognition validated Russia's 
military invasion and was inconsistent with commitments to 
Georgia's territorial integrity.  Further, Ambassador noted 
that this decision would cause all aspects of our 
relationship to be reviewed.  While Nicaragua had the 
authority as a sovereign nation to make such decisions, the 
United States as a sovereign nation had the obligation to 
disagree, especially when the territorial integrity of 
another nation allied to the U.S. and regional security, were 
at stake. 
 
¶2. (C) Santos offered a convoluted and inconsistent 
explanation of the decision to recognize the two entities. 
Noting that he had just returned from Europe, he dismissed 
the notion that other countries had grounds to be concerned 
about the decision to recognize and alleged, unconvincingly, 
that the recent agreement brokered by the French to withdraw 
Russian troops validated Nicaragua's decision.  He declared 
that the decision to recognize was made by President Ortega 
and was intended first and foremost to "stop the killings" 
and aid peace in the region.  He also said that recognition 
was a symbolic demonstration of solidarity following a 
request made by the two territories for recognition after the 
"aggression" they suffered from Georgia.  Santos also noted 
that he had warned the U.S. when it recognized Kosovo that it 
had "opened Pandora's Box" and was now paying the 
consequences.  When Ambassador pointed out the inconsistency 
of that argument, highlighted by Nicaragua's continued 
refusal to recognize Kosovo, Santos asserted that Kosovo 
should have remained part of Yugoslavia and that South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia were "different" for ethnic, historical 
and geographic reasons. 
 
¶3. (C) In a September 9 meeting with Vice President Jaime 
Morales, Ambassador again raised our deep concerns regarding 
the recognition.  Morales attempted to assert that the 
recognition was still not "official" until it was publicized 
in the official register, the Gacetta.  When pressed, he 
admitted that did not mean that there was a chance the 
recognition could repealed and acknowledged that the 
political impact remained.  Morales echoed Santos' assertion 
that the decision was made following the request of the 
leadership of the two territories which had "suffered 
aggression and asked for help."  When pressed as to whether 
the decision was directed against the U.S., Morales asserted 
"no" but admitted he did not know all the reasons for the 
decision behind the timing of the recognition. 
 
¶4. (C) Ambassador spoke via telephone with the UK Ambassador, 
resident in Costa Rica, the Japanese Ambassador and Charges 
from Germany, Spain and Norway.  All noted that they have not 
received instructions to date from capitals or the EU, but 
that there was general concern over the decision to recognize 
the entities.  The German Charge said he expected to receive 
instructions soon, noting his governments serious concern. 
The Danish Ambassador confirmed that he has received 
instructions to raise the issue bilaterally with the GON. 
Officials of the Canadian Embassy, also resident in Costa 
Rica, also have spoken with us to obtain more information on 
the recognition and expects to receive demarche instructions 
from Ottawa.
