SUBJECT: ISRAELI DEFMIN DISCUSSES PEACE PROCESS, IRAN 
DURING VIENNA VISIT 
 
¶1. (U) Israeli Defense Minister and Deputy PM Barak met with 
Chancellor Faymann, President Fischer, DefMin Darabos, and FM 
Spindelegger during a low-key December 14-15 visit to Vienna. 
 During a joint press conference after their meeting, Barak 
and Darabos emphasized their support for a two-state solution 
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  They also stressed the 
strong bilateral relationship between their two countries, 
though Barak noted that the relationship had experienced "ups 
and downs," an apparent reference to tensions arising from 
the election of Kurt Waldheim as Austrian President in 1986 
and the 1999 Austrian parliamentary elections that led to a 
government including the far-right Freedom Party. 
Spindelegger also called for a two-state solution after his 
meeting with Barak, adding that lack of progress in the peace 
process was "creating hopelessness and playing into the hands 
of extremists."  Spindelegger urged Israel to cease 
settlement construction and called on the Palestinians to 
unify and refrain from violence against Israel. 
 
¶2. (U) Wolfgang Lapuh, MFA Middle East Deputy Director, told 
us on December 17 that Spindelegger asked Barak what Austria 
could do to help revive the peace process.  Barak replied 
that Austria, working through the EU, should encourage the 
Palestinians to return to the table for discussions.  He also 
recommended that the EU encourage President Abbas to remain 
in office.  Spindelegger asked about press reports suggesting 
that the Palestinians might unilaterally declare a state. 
Barak noted that the media had misrepresented the 
Palestinians' statements, but said that the Labor Party, 
which he leads, would have no problem with such a 
declaration.  He suggested that a unilateral declaration 
would help clarify the parties to a two-state solution. 
 
¶3. (U) Barak also told Spindelegger that Israel has 
information indicating that Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei 
might be willing to announce a two-month moratorium on 
uranium enrichment, Lapuh said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Barak also attended a December 14 event at which the 
World Jewish Congress (WJC) awarded the Nahum Goldmann Medal 
to Vienna Mayor Michael Haupl.  WJC President Ronald Lauder 
said in a statement that Haupl was chosen for his efforts in 
reviving Jewish life in Vienna, including his support for the 
Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial and the construction of Jewish 
schools and other institutions, as well as his denunciations 
of anti-Semitism.  (Note: The event received minimal press 
coverage.  It appears that Haupl, facing election in 2010, 
did not want to call too much attention to the award.  He 
likely determined that it would not be to his advantage to be 
associated with a Jewish organization, particularly the WJC, 
which many Austrians resent for its criticism of Austria 
during the Waldheim affair.)
