We delivered reftel demarche July 6 to Subdirector General of 
Commerce and Investment at the Ministry of Economy Silvia 
Iranzo Gutierrez.  Iranzo thanked us for the information and 
clearly stated that her ministry could not take action until 
the names were officially listed.  We then delivered the 
demarche to MFA Subdirector General for the Middle East 
Alberto Moreno to urge Spanish support for the listing.  Once 
listed, the Ministry of Economy will notify banks of the 
offending names.
