  Econoff delivered reftel import safety demarche on August 
31 to Director General Chen Jay-san of the Bureau of 
Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) of the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs.  Econoff emphasized that science-based 
standards and best practices  should be used as the 
guidelines to determine product safety.  Econoff also pointed 
out that the working group's activities were not aimed at 
protecting U.S. producers but rather to improve procedures 
for ensuring the safety of imported products.  Chen said that 
most of the import problems that Taiwan has experienced have 
to do with products from the PRC, followed by imports from 
Southeast Asia.  Toys from the PRC, for example, account for 
70-80 percent of the Taiwan market.  BSMI regularly collects 
information on flawed products from the US Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, press reports and its representatives 
stationed overseas.  Chen was very receptive to the idea of 
an import safety working group and was willing to share data 
on import safety.  He said that the Executive Yuan, which has 
oversight over the BSMI, has set up a website dedicated to 
import safety and welcomed data sharing with other countries.
