REF: STATE 195763 
 
(SBU) On December 7, poloff delivered reftel urging support 
for the Finnish draft resolution on Sudan in the Human Rights 
Council (HRC) to Jang Hyun-cheol, Deputy Director of MOFAT's 
Human Rights and Social Affairs Division.  Jang stated that 
the Republic of Korea, a HRC member, would support the 
resolution on Sudan and was just debating whether to 
co-sponsor the resolution or not.  The ROK had supported 
earlier EU draft language on Sudan and backed the decision to 
hold a Special Session on Sudan.  The ROK shared the same 
view as the United States and European countries on Sudan, 
Jang explained.
