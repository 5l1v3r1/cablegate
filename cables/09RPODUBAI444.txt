SUBJECT: IRAN PRESS/NUCLEAR: FRENCH-IRAN DISAGREEMENT CAUSES DELAY OF 
DAY TWO VIENNA TALKS? 
 
¶1. (U) October 19 Iranian press reports of the first day of 
Vienna IAEA negotiations cited IAEA Director General's 
characterization of the talks as "very constructive" and "a good 
start." However other Iranian press, to include two October 19 
'PressTV' pieces titled "Iran Rejects 'Direct Talks' with France 
in Vienna," and " France Removed From Iran Uranium Suppliers," 
cited "a source close to the meeting" as saying that Iran would 
not hold direct talks with France in Vienna on the purchase of 
highly-enriched uranium for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR). 
This source was quoted as saying that: 
 
- "France has failed in its responsibilities regarding nuclear 
cooperation with Iran and continues to create obstacles in the 
process of negotiations between Iran and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); " 
 
 
 
- "Iran will not hold direct talks with France in Vienna for 
failing to deliver its nuclear materials in the past." (Comment: 
Western press cites sources in Tehran as saying that France 
could no longer be trusted due to its unwillingness to deliver 
50 tons of UF6 gas, despite Iran's ten percent ownership of the 
French Uranium enrichment company Eurodif. End Comment) 
 
 
 
Subsequently, October 20 ISNA reporting quoted "sources close to 
the Vienna discussions" as saying that France's 
non-participation in the consortium of countries providing fuel 
to the Tehran Research Reactor was "definite." 
 
 
 
DAY TWO DELAY? 
 
---------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) Again citing "sources close to the Vienna negotiations," 
another October 20 ISNA piece reported that "French disruptions" 
were causing the delay of the start of the second day 
discussions.  This source ascribed France's "destructive 
efforts" to "scuttle the negotiations" to its being omitted from 
the arrangements to supply fuel to the Tehran Research Reactor. 
The source said France's actions lead to both disagreements 
between the US and Russia and between France and these two 
countries on the other, in addition to leading to consultations 
with IAEA head Al-Baradei. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) A subsequent October 20 ISNA report quoted "sources close 
to the Vienna negotiations" as saying that the delay of the 
second day discussions was related to a change in the text of 
the draft agreement, and France's elimination from it.  This 
source cited "serious efforts" by the French representative at 
the talks to pressure IAEA Director General Al-Baradei to 
prevent any type of agreement for the provision of fuel to Iran. 
 This ISNA report said that as of 1400 hours Tehran time the 
Vienna talks had still not started due to French pressure on the 
IAEA Director General, and again cited French "negative and 
destructive efforts" as causing disputes between the American 
and Russian delegations on the one side and the French 
delegation on the other side.
