¶1. STRATEGIC ECONOMIC DIALOGUE 
 
"The U.S.-China SED upgraded to premier-level" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(12/01): "The 
Japanese media recently reported that the U.S.-China Strategic 
Economic Dialogue may be being upgraded because it will be held 
between Biden and Wen Jiabao. The fifth U.S.-China Strategic 
Economic Dialogue is going to be held in Beijing. This report has 
aroused international attention concerning whether or not on this 
dialogue the U.S. and China will agree to upgrade the dialogue 
system. Japanese media is reporting that the U.S. has suggested that 
there should be a combination of the two dialogues, the SED and the 
SD, and an upgrade from the deputy minister level of participants to 
the premier level of participants. Obama has expressed his support 
for strengthening this type of senior-level dialogue. Chinese 
experts indicate that if this happens, these dialogues would become 
the highest level talks taking place between the U.S. and China. 
This change shows that the Obama administration emphasizes the 
U.S.-China relations as an important part of their strategy in north 
eastern Asia.  The possibility that the two dialogues will be 
combined is very high. To a large extent, it will help the dialogues 
between the two countries to be a comprehensive and a strategic 
dialogue." 
 
¶2. U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
"Experienced politicians help Obama change" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(12/01): "When it 
comes to human resources, Obama tends to use experienced officials, 
and usually, the most sophisticated ones. It appears that Obama 
emphasizes experience over change. Most of his candidates are 
Washington insiders rather than new faces. Analysts suggest that the 
reason for this is his political need as well as the result of the 
current U.S. political situation. What's more, Obama is facing 
difficulties both domestically and abroad. Using experienced 
officials who are more capable is more helpful when attempting to 
stabilize the people's morale than using new faces. The personnel 
arrangement will largely decide the effectiveness of Obama's policy 
in the future." 
 
¶3. CHINA-EUROPE SUMMIT 
 
"China postpones the summit & shocks Europe" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/01): "China's decision to postpone the 
China-Europe Summit has shocked Europe. China's behavior towards 
Europe is an unprecedented and tough measure; done in order to 
protect China's sovereignty. On the internet, people have 
overwhelmingly expressed agreement with the government's decision. 
However, the European media is having different opinions about this 
behavior. A British expert indicated that under the economic 
recession, Europe must swallow the bitter fruit that it grabbed for 
itself and accept the consequences. Chinese foreign ministry 
spokesperson indicated that, the China-Europe summit will be held 
when France, the rotating presidency country of the EU, takes 
practical measures to create the necessary good conditions and 
environment for the summit. Currently, Sarkozy is the most 
embarrassing. Other member countries feel angry about the negative 
influence Sarkozy's personal behavior brings; stating that, he is 
affecting the whole economic development of the EU."
