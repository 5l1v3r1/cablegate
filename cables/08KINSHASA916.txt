REF:        KINSHASA 875 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Post has received a copy of the GDRC's diplomatic note no. 
130/12/CH/0894/2008, which was sent October 9 via MONUC to the 
Government of Rwanda (GOR) in response to the GOR's note of October 
5 criticizing the GDRC for an "alliance" between the DRC's armed 
forces and the ex-FAR/Interahamwe/FDLR.  Text of the GOR's dip note 
is at reftel. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In this latest note the GDRC rejects GOR allegations, 
which it labels not only as a provocation, but also as a maneuver to 
justify the presence of Rwandan soldiers on Congolese territory. 
Additionally, the GDRC note contains accusations that the GOR and 
its armed forces are directly supporting Nkunda, as well as demands 
that they cease this support. 
 
¶3.  (U) Unofficial embassy translation of the GDRC note follows: 
 
Begin GDRC note 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the 
Democratic Republic of Congo presents its compliments to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of 
Rwanda and has the honor to acknowledge receipt of its note verbale 
No. 0233/09.01/CAB/MIN/08 of Sunday 05 October 2008. 
 
In this regard, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo 
wishes first to express its strong disapproval and profound 
indignation as to the allegations contained in the above-mentioned 
note verbale.  Next, it totally refutes the unfounded assertions 
which not only are pure provocation but constitute a maneuver of the 
Government of Rwanda aiming to justify the presence of its troops on 
Congolese territory. 
 
This dilatory maneuver is unacceptable, as it seeks to distract the 
international community and the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, which recently denounced the strengthening of 
positions of Rwandan troops on the border shared with the Democratic 
Republic of Congo and the military support of the Government of 
Rwanda to the insurrectional movement of Laurent Nkunda Mihigo. 
 
The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo accordingly 
invites the Government of the Republic of Rwanda to strictly respect 
its commitments freely engaged in through international and 
bilateral legal instruments listed in the above-mentioned note 
verbale, and to proceed without delay with the unconditional 
withdrawal of its troops currently fighting alongside rebels led by 
ex-General Laurent Nkunda Mihigo and cease all support to the 
movement of the latter. 
 
The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo wishes to see the 
Government of the Republic of Rwanda resolve as soon as possible to 
do the right thing to promote a return of stability in the region, 
which is critical to the development of both countries in particular 
and to the whole region in general. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the 
Democratic Republic of Congo takes this opportunity to renew to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of 
Rwanda the assurances of its highest consideration.
