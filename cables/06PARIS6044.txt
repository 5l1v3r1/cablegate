Poloff conveyed reftel points to MFA Lebanon Desk Officer 
Remy Bouallegue on September 7.  Bouallegue expressed 
appreciation for the demarche and agreed on all points.  He 
noted that France would like to organize a reconstruction 
conference in Beirut before the end of the year but 
recognized this might not be realistic; he suggested France 
may try to organize an ad hoc reconstruction meeting in New 
York on the margins of the UNGA.
