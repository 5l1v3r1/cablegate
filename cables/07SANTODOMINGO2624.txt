REPUBLIC LEANS TOWARD U.S. POSITION 
 
REF: STATE 159386 
 
¶1. (U) POLOFF delivered Reftel talking points on "Opposing 
UNGA Resolutions with Anti-Israel Bias" to Ambassador Pedro 
Blandino, Assistant Secretary for International Organizations 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  In his reply, Blandino 
did not directly address how the Dominican Republic would 
vote on the resolutions.  However, Blandino commented that 
the Dominican-Israeli relationship is a strong one, and that 
the Dominicans have an embassy in Tel Aviv. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Blandino added that, during the Dominican Republic's 
recent unsuccessful attempt to win a seat on the Security 
Council, some quarters within the Ministry had advocated that 
the Dominicans establish diplomatic relations with the 
Palestinian Authority.  Blandino derided this suggestion as 
"crazy," and said that the idea had gone nowhere. 
 
¶3. (U) We will report any subsequent Dominican response.
