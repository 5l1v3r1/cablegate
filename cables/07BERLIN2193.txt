¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Germany leans toward favoring a 
negotiated settlement between the European Commission and the 
United States on internet gambling to avoid arbitration in

Economics officials say Germany will not pressure other 
Member States to accept an offer from the United States that 
they may regard as providing insufficient compensatory market 
access.  End summary.
