¶1. (U) In further response (refs B and C) to our demarche on 
ref A points encouraging Omani support for the Iraqi 
government and re-establishing a diplomatic presence in 
Baghdad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a Note Verbale 
to the Embassy dated June 20. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In its communication, the Ministry reaffirmed its 
unstinting support for the Iraqi government, pointing to the 
high-level reception accorded to the Iraqi Finance Minister 
during his recent visit to Muscat.  The Ministry cited its 
close contact with the local Iraqi employees of the Omani 
Embassy in Baghdad, however, in determining that the current 
security situation there is not yet suitable for Omani 
diplomats.
