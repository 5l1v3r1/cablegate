SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST: ANP RANK REFORM PLANNING AND 
COORDINATION DIRECTORATE (PART TWO OF TWO CABLES) 
 
 
¶1. This is an action request; please see paragraphs 2 and 3. 
 
¶2. In order to comply with Leahy vetting requirements, this cable 
forwards the names and biodata of fifty (50) Afghan National Police 
(ANP) field grade officers selected for positions in the Planning 
and Coordination Directorate: the Operational Parliamentary Security 
Cell and the Anti-Disaster & Disaster Response Planning Cell.  When 
there are individuals with one name, Post has made a good faith 
effort to ensure that these individuals actually only have one name. 
 This is the second in a series of two cables. 
 
¶3. IMPORTANT NOTE:  The international community recently approved 
pay increases for ANP company grade officers (captains and 
lieutenants); however, pay increases for the field grade ANP 
personnel will not be approved until completion of Rank Reform. 
Currently, ANP field grade personnel earn less than their Afghan 
National Army (ANA) equivalents, a situation that is causing severe 
morale problems.  Completion of the ANP Rank Reform process will 
significantly alleviate deteriorating morale, which is why Post 
requests the Department's expedited vetting and response at the 
earliest possible date.  Post greatly appreciates Department's 
strong support for completing the ANP Rank Reform process.
