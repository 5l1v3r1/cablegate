SUBJECT: SPAIN/ETA: FALSE ALARM AT IBIZA AIRPORT 
 
 
¶1. (U) Spanish media outlets reported on June 30 that a bomb 
threat was called in by a member of the Basque terrorist 
group ETA to the Basque publication "Gara" warning of an 
explosive device at the airport on the Spanish island of 
Ibiza, a big international tourist destination.  ETA 
frequently uses Gara as a conduit to advise Spanish 
authorities that the group has placed a bomb in a specific 
location. According to Spanish police, no bomb was actually 
found, but as a result of the false alarm, 4,000 people were 
evacuated from the airport after a suspicious package was 
found by security officials.  Some witnesses told police that 
they heard a loud explosion, but police said that the noise 
had been created by a robot used to defuse bombs. 
 
¶2. (U) The reaction of Spanish security officials to the bomb 
threat exhibits the high state of alert in Spain after ETA 
broke its "permanent" ceasefire in early June.  June 30 
marked the first official day of the summer holiday travel 
season, and a total of 13,000 passengers were reportedly 
affected by the hoax.  The situation was resolved quickly and 
after three hours Ibiza officials reopened the airport.  Some 
Spanish authorities speculate that ETA will not resort to 
fatal attacks, but instead will target the tourism industry 
in an attempt to exact maximum damage to the Spanish economy 
during the height of the tourist season.
