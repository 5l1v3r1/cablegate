SUBJECT: GEORGIA LIKELY TO SUPPORT CUBA EMBARGO RESOLUTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 148506 
 
Per reftel request, Poloff delivered talking points to 
Alexander Nalbandov, Director of the International 
Organizations Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Nalbandov said that Georgia shares the EU position in favor 
of removal of the embargo and will support the resolution. 
When pressed, he said that he would consult with Ministry 
officials to see whether Georgia could abstain from voting, 
but noted that Georgia has traditionally voted for the 
resolution in the past, and it was unlikely Georgia would 
abstain.
