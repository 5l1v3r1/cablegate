REF: STATE 199860 
 
Drawing on points contained reftel, Poloff met on December 20 
with Azzedine Farhane, Chief of the UN Division at the 
Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to convey the U.S. view 
that the ceiling rate for member state assessments should 
remain at 22 percent and urged Moroccan support for the 
effort to reach consensus on the next UN scale.  Farhane said 
that Morocco's position was that all member states with the 
means to do so should pay their assessments promptly and in 
full.  He said Morocco had not finalized its position on the 
appropriate ceiling for assessments, but promised to convey 
U.S. views to the Minister's office.
