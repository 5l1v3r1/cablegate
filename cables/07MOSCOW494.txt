¶1. (SBU) In coordination with British and German diplomatic 
colleagues, on January 26 we shared Ref A invitation letter and 
logistics details for the March 2007 G8 BTEX Forensic Epidemiology 
Workshop in London with the MFA's Vladimir Andreyev, Deputy Director 
of the Department of New Challenges and Threats.  The Russians have 
not yet offered any substantive response to the invitation, though 
they previously told us several ministries were interested in 
participating, including the Ministries of Agriculture and Defense 
and the Federal Security Service (Ref B).
