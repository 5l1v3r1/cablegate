¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a meeting on March 25 between ANAC President 
Solange Vieira and Ambassador Sobel that addressed  FAA's proposed 
consultations and follow-up assessment, Vieira respectfully declined 
FAA's offer of consultations and proposed that FAA move ahead with 
its IASA assessment and offered the end of May or the beginning of 
June as the potentially acceptable target period.  In order to 
confirm the dates, ANAC will require information on how many team 
members would come, what official level of representation is 
expected on the Brazilian side, the elements of the assessment 
(particularly whether the team expects to examine airports, aircraft 
manufacturing, physical air traffic control, as well as examining 
paperwork) and the approximate duration in order to ensure that 
appropriate ANAC personnel make themselves available.  Action 
request for FAA in para 3.  End Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) While expressing appreciation for the offer, Vieira 
declined the FAA consultation option.  She noted that ANAC had 
already paid for consultants from ICAO to help them get ready for 
the May 4-15 ICAO inspection and felt additional consultations 
offered by FAA would not be necessary and would pull resources away 
from ICAO inspection preparations.  Vieira suggested timing the FAA 
assessment for the period shortly after the ICAO inspections based 
on ANAC's desire to complete both the ICAO and FAA assessments prior 
to turning its attention to submitting an airport privatization 
model to President Lula by the July 2009 deadline.  Vieira requested 
that FAA provide details on how many team members would come, what 
official level of representation is expected on the Brazilian side 
(including whether she is expected to participate throughout or in a 
debrief at the end of the assessment), the elements of the 
assessment (particularly whether the team will physically examine 
airports, aircraft manufacturing, air traffic control operations, 
airline operations, as well as examining paperwork) and the 
approximate duration of the inspection in order to ensure that 
appropriate ANAC personnel make themselves available for the topics 
and time period FAA requires.  With the information on scope and 
duration in hand, Vieira committed that she would then consult with 
her directors to establish a date for the IASA assessment in the 
late May/early June timeframe and ensure the necessary team made 
themselves available for the required time period. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests that FAA provide immediately 
substantive background information relating to the IASA process and 
estimated duration so that assessment dates can be quickly finalized 
and locked on ANAC's calendar.
