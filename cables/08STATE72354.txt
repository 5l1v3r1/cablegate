SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050105462 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050105462 for the export of 
rifles to Canada. Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: US applicant Robinson Armament Co. 
stated that it is exporting a "fixed stock" model of the XCR 
rifle under this license. Open-source research has yielded no 
definitive evidence that a fixed stock XCR rifle is being 
produced, as all claims of fixed stock models are accompanied 
by photos of the XCR rifle with folding stocks. A proviso  on 
this license states that rifles with folding stocks are not 
approved for export under this license. This request is for 
Post to determine that the exported rifles do not/not have 
"folding stocks." 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to verify that the 
rifles listed below do not/not have folding stocks. In its 
reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities and concerns about the entities involved.
