¶1. (U) On June 30, PolOff delivered Reftel points to Ellen 
Goelz, desk officer for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, 
who offered to share the summary with interested parties 
within the German government and noted that such information 
is "extremely welcome and helpful."  She also noted that, as 
Ambassador Groening's final official trip to Washington prior 
to his retirement as Commissioner for Arms Control and 
Disarmament, he found the Fifth Anniversary meeting very 
productive and worthwhile. 
 
¶2. (U) With the summer transfer season well-underway, the 
German MFA's main PSI expert has already departed for his 
next post, and his successor has yet to arrive.  Any 
additional response from the German interagency will be 
transmitted septel.
