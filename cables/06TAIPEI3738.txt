SUBJECT:  Taiwan APEC Envoy is TSMC Chairman Morris Chang 
 
¶1.  On October 30, President Chen Shui-bian appointed Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang 
as his envoy to attend the upcoming APEC Leaders Meeting in Hanoi, 
Vietnam, November 18-19. 
 
¶2.  Chang, 75, is the founder of TSMC, the world's first and largest 
silicon foundry.  TSMC is listed on both the Taiwan and New York 
stock exchanges, and its 2005 sales totaled NT$266.6 billion (US$8.1 
billion at an exchange rate of NT$33 per US$).  In 1994, he founded 
Vanguard International Semiconductor Co with capital of US$655 
million.  Vanguard is the 26th largest semiconductor firm in Taiwan, 
and its 2005 sales amounted to NT$11.4 billion (US$345 million). 
Chang has been Chairman of TSMC and Vanguard since their founding. 
TSMC is the only Taiwan semiconductor company with a fabrication 
 
SIPDIS 
plant in China. 
 
¶3.  Chang was recruited by Taiwan authorities in 1985 from General 
Instrument Corporation in the U.S. to serve as President of Taiwan's 
officially funded Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). 
In 1988, he was promoted to ITRI Chairman and served in that 
position for the next six years.  He founded TSMC in 1987 and served 
as Chairman of TSMC on a concurrent basis until he left ITRI in 
¶1994. 
 
¶4.  Chang obtained his BS and MS in mechanical engineering from 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  During a 25-year career at 
Texas Instruments (TI), he earned a Ph. D. in electrical engineering 
at Stanford.  He joined TI in 1958 as an engineering manager.  In 
1964, he became TI's general manager of germanium transistors and 
silicon transistors.  He was named integrated circuits manager in 
¶1966.  He established TI's TTL as the standard logic family and TI 
as a leading integrated circuit company in the world.  In 1972, Mr. 
Chang became group vice president in charge of the semiconductor 
group, where he managed the largest semiconductor operations in the 
world with 25,000 employees and 16 plants in 11 countries. 
 
¶5.  Chang's achievements reached beyond the semiconductor field. 
From 1978 to 1980, he was TI's vice president in charge of customer 
products.  Under his leadership, the company introduced the 
innovative Speak & Spell, which became an instant success with many 
children and parents.  From 1981 to 1983, he was a senior vice 
president responsible for quality, education and productivity at TI, 
and launched many successful programs in those areas. 
 
¶6.  He resigned from TI in 1983.  In 1984, he joined General 
Instrument as its president and chief operating officer.
