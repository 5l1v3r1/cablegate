His Excellency Mr. Dick Cheney 
Vice President of the United States of America 
The White House 
Washington, D.C. 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
On behalf of the Government and people of the Kingdom of 
Bahrain, I offer my sincere condolences to the Government 
and people of the United States at the death of the fortieth 
President of the United States, President Ronald Reagan.  I 
ask that my condolences also be passed on to his wife, Nancy 
Reagan and other members of his family. 
 
History will remember well President Reagan as a man of 
great achievements who had an immense personal charm as well 
as a resolve and commitment to make the world a more 
peaceful and safer place for subsequent generations.  His 
passing therefore saddens us all. 
 
The Government and people of Bahrain join with their United 
States counterparts in mourning the death of President 
Ronald Reagan. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
KHALIFA BIN SALMAN AL KHALIFA 
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain
