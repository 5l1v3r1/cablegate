(SBU)  On November 25, per reftels A and B, ESToff met with 
Alexander Bolichiov, Second Secretary in the MFA Department 
of Security and Disarmament Affairs, to reiterate and 
reinforce the USG message regarding non-attendance at Iran's 
November 30 Nuclear Conference (ref C).  Bolichiov indicated 
that he had just returned from a visit to the IAEA 
secretariat in Vienna and while there, had been assured that 
the IAEA had no intention of allowing the conference to 
become a platform for a positive political statement from 
Iran.  Bolichiov said that the MFA had sent a letter to 
Rosatom State Corporation and "other agencies" requesting 
that no "political level" attendees be sent to the upcoming 
conference.  He stated that Rosatom State Corporation was 
sending a working-level delegation.  Bolichiov allowed that 
the MFA shares the USG view that now was not the time to 
conduct business as usual with Iran.
