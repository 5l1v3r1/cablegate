The nominee's participation in the IV Program would lead to a 
more positive perception of the various facets of the U.S. in 
the ESTRI community. 
Given his leadership role in the local Arab community, 
Mostfa's participation in the IV Program would facilitate a 
less negative opinion of American policies among Arabs in the 
Rhone-Alpes region, home to one of France's largest Arab 
communities, a community which is vigorously critical of U.S. 
policies regarding the Middle-East crisis and the war in Iraq.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Professor Mostfa is a mid-career scholar of English Studies 
who is moving into American studies. Until now, he has been a 
pure British Studies scholar who has had no exposure to U.S. 
values, civilization, and policies, not even through a brief 
tourist visit. This lack of exposure is detrimental to his new 
responsibilities. Beginning in January 2005, he will be in 
charge of developing and teaching a 45-hour course each year 
on "political and cultural challenges in the U.S., Australia 
and Canada." His Dean also plans to assign to him the 
development and teaching of a course on NGOs that carry out 
international operations such as Handicap International, World 
Wildlife Fund, and Amnesty International. Born in Morocco and 
still very attached to his ethnic origins, Mostfa is an 
excellent example of an immigrant's successful integration 
into French academia. In 1990, he was the first intercultural 
mediator appointed by the French government, and worked for 
four years interfacing between the Arab community and the 
French authorities (police, justice, social services and 
others). Currently, he is the vice-president of COMARA, an 
association of upper-educated Moroccan expatriates that 
facilitate intercultural dialogue. 
Mostfa is expected to pursue his academic career at the 
Catholic University of Lyon, and particularly at its 
International Relations and Translators/Interpreters School 
(ESTRI), which currently consists of about 400 students who 
will work in international relations, NGOs, public services 
and international organizations.

We really do believe that he would be an excellent candidate 
and that the USG stands to gain a lot from having him 
participate. As the new director of IEP Lyon (one of the 
largest and most selective political science institutes in 
France), he is in constant contact with IEP Lyon's 1000 
students and 200 faculty members.  As such, he shares his 
views and perceptions on a variety of subjects -- including 
the United States -- with them, and an IV program would be a 
wonderful opportunity for us to influence those perceptions. 
IEP Lyon is in the process of opening up its curriculum to 
more international issues, and has just created a 
professorship devoted to American Studies and Politics. 
Although Pollet will not be the professor in question, he 
supervises the position and is responsible for directing and 
influencing the increased international outlook of the IEP. 
In terms of the education of hundreds of French students, it 
would be of great benefit to us to have someone in that 
position who has a positive view of the United States. 
Pollet, by the way, is not "only" the director of IEP Lyon -- 
he also teaches comparative politics there at the doctoral 
level.  Again, participating in the IV program would benefit 
us by ensuring that what he is teaching about American 
politics is correct and positive. 
In addition to his duties at IEP Lyon, Pollet also serves as 
an associate researcher with numerous scientific institutions 
and is a productive writer on a number of topics -- as such, 
it would be of great benefit to us if his perceptions of the 
United States were accurate, informed, and (of course) 
positive.  The IV program would be an excellent way of 
arriving at that goal. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Pollet's main fields of interest would include the following: 
Government: The legislative and the federal government; policy 
formulation; citizen' participation 
Analysis of public policies: federal and state agencies, think- 
tanks (Rand, Heritage Foundation, Pew research), urban 
development institutions 
Welfare system: Medicare, pension funds, social work 
institutions 
Local governments and leadership: Lobbying organizations, 
state governments, media, community groups

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Gilles Pollet is a dynamic political science scholar who 
recently was elected director of the Institute of Political 
Science of Lyon, one of the largest and most selective 
political science institutes in France. Throughout his career 
and in parallel with his teaching activities, Pollet has had 
an impressive list of concurrent positions. In 2001, he was 
elected President of the National Association of Political 
Science Scholars and Researchers. In 2003, the Ministry of 
Research and New Technologies tasked Pollet with the 
restructuring of upper education in the field of social 
sciences. In addition, Pollet continues to teach and is the 
director of the IEP's doctoral program on Public Policies and 
Comparative Systems of Government. He is also an associate 
researcher with numerous scientific institutions. 
Pollet is likely to pursue his academic career for another 
twenty years and to remain a very productive writer. In view 
of the crisis that affects the French retirement system, his 
expertise in comparative retirement systems should make him an 
increasingly sought-after expert. 
Pollet's knowledge of the U.S. is extensive but purely 
theoretical. His participation in the IVP would have a 
positive impact on his own perception of U.S. values, 
democracy, social environment and system of government. 
Because of his involvement in a wide variety of activities, 
Pollet would be able to share any insights gained during the 
IVP not only with the 1,000 students and 200 scholars of the 
IEP, but also with a large number of influential circles. 
Moreover, the IEP is largely opening its curriculum towards 
international relations, and is, for the first time creating a 
professor position that is exclusively devoted to American 
studies.

Ramel's main field of specialization (international relations, 
conflict ethics, and war sociology) ties in to various facets 
of the MPP. The ultimate goal of this International Visitor's 
program would be to help reduce the perceptual differences 
between French and American public opinions about security, 
warfare, and regional stability. A first objective would be to 
highlight the U.S.' attachment to moral values and expose the 
visitor to the work conducted by ethics development 
organizations, including in the American military. A second 
objective would be to facilitate the establishment of a 
transatlantic dialogue among ethics experts and political 
philosophers.

Frederic Ramel is a young assistant professor of political 
science who specializes his research and teaching on 
contemporary conflicts and their impact on public opinions and 
international alliances. Currently working on the consequences 
of 9/11 and the war in Iraq, he is focusing his research on 
how diverging cultural perceptions of the enemy can lead to 
the fragmentation of an international order or an alliance. 
Ramel has already been a productive author. His courses reach 
an annual audience of some 2,000 students in Lyon-III 
University's School of Law and Political Science. 
Expected to teach for another 35 years or so, Ramel has the 
profile to follow a long-term academic career, eventually 
reaching the ultimate rank of director of research. In 
parallel with his teaching responsibilities, he will probably 
continue to conduct research for the Lyon-based Center for 
Defense and Security Studies --one of the rare French think 
tanks exclusively devoted to security issues.
