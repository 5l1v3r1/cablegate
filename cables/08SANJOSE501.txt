REF: STATE 61034 
 
¶1. On June 10, we delivered reftel points to Viviana Tinoco, 
MFA Human Rights Officer. Tinoco told us that Costa 
Rica affiliated as only an observer to the HRC upon its 2006 
inception since Costa Rica's efforts and resources were 
then already focused on winning a UNSC seat. She had not 
heard about the U.S. decision to stop participating in the 
HRC, evinced little reaction when we informed her, and said 
that the GOCR has no substantive response to our demarche. 
¶2. Tinoco did say that due to earlier criticism of the  HRC's 
"politicized" activities, Costa Rica planned to join other 
countries to establish a peer-based Universal Periodic Review 
of the HRC's activities and of the human rights 
situations in other countries. 
 
¶3. On June 12, PolCouns followed up with Antonio Alarcon, 
Chief of Staff to FM Bruno Stagno. Alarcon had already been 
briefed by Tinoco, and offered a similarly supportive but 
non-substantive response. He promised to inform the FM 
(currently visiting India) of the USG position.
