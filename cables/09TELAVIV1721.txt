Key Stories in the Media: 
------------------------ 
 
All major print media reported about the international protests 
against the eviction of two Palestinian families from their homes in 
the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheik Jarrah. The media quoted 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as saying that Israel should 
avoid such acts of provocation, as well as European and Egyptian 
objection to the move. 
 
Yediot Ahronot quoted a U.S. official who said that the Saudis are 
considering granting permission for Israeli airliners to fly over 
its territory and the opening of trade offices in Israel as steps 
towards normalization. Yediot also quote Senator George Mitchell's 
interview with the New York Times from yesterday, saying that the 
U.S. is not only pressing Israel on the settlements, but also 
placing pressure on Arab states to take steps towards normalization. 
 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that last week's meetings in Jerusalem 
between top US and Israeli officials significantly improved the 
atmosphere in the Israeli-US relationship, even though Israel made 
clear that a full freeze of construction in the settlements over an 
extended period of time is not a sustainable option. 
 
The media reported on the preparations for the sixth Fatah assembly 
that will begin in Bethlehem today, with the Jerusalem Post 
reporting about growing skepticism that Fatah will succeed in 
implementing major reforms or endorsing a more moderate attitude. 
 
Haaretz reported that the Israel Air Force has begun expanding the 
types of training they are conducting with foreign armies, opening 
them up to the media as part of an effort to advertise its 
long-range capabilities. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted an Israeli Defense Ministry official who 
said that Israel has ordered over 100 LJDAMs (Laser Joint Direct 
Attack Munitions) from the U.S. for the Israeli Air Force. 
 
All media quoted Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman as saying at a 
press conference yesterday that he will resign his position if 
indicted on corruption charges one day after police recommended that 
the Attorney General charge him. 
 
All media, including electronic and television, reported about the 
arrest of an American citizen living in Israel who allegedly 
impersonated U.S. federal prisoners and fraudulently claimed taxes 
on their behalf from the U.S. government. 
 
All media led today's newspapers with a report about the Israeli 
health ministry's warning of a swine flu pandemic in Israel during 
the upcoming winter months, and that they expect about 700 people to 
die from complications relating to the disease.

¶I.  "An Important Day" 
 
Yossi Beilin, the chief Israeli architect of the Geneva Initiative, 
wrote in the independent Israel Hayom (8/4): "The sixth Fatah 
General Congress is not expected to make any dramatic decisions.... 
Those results are going to have a direct impact on the organization 
that controls the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and on the 
future of the political talks with Israel.... The sixth congress is 
likely to allow Fatah to reinvent itself as a realistic and 
clear-thinking governing party that understands the needs of the 
Palestinian people far better than its fanatical adversary... [and] 
a party that is aware of great advantage of good neighborly 
relations with Israel. Anyone who wants to see a coalition of sane 
parties form in our region ought to hope that the congress ends in 
success." 
 
 
II. "Obama's Misses" 
Orly Azulay-Katz, Washington-based correspondent for the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot opined (8/4): "Barack 
Obama's failure to win over public opinion in Israel does not stem 
from the fact that he hasn't bothered to come to Tel Aviv or 
Jerusalem to speak directly to the people. His failure stems from 
the fact that his message is vague and has not given Israelis to 
understand what future steps are being planned.... If the American 
president were shortly to introduce a plan with a program for its 
execution, he would succeed in drawing after him a large group of 
people in the Middle East who have grown weary of wars and who will 
be prepared to follow anyone who shows them the way.... Obama needs 
to outline the solution to the core issues, such as borders, 
Jerusalem and the refugees. Not an imposed solution but, rather, a 
vision. 
 
 
III. "Jews & Sheikh Jarrah" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (8/4): 
"It was not a pretty picture. The belongings of two Palestinian Arab 
families dumped in the street after they were evicted from their 
homes in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah ... This 
area, also known as "Simon the Just," was purchased by Jews at the 
end of the 19th century during the Ottoman Empire.... Israel finds 
itself in the anomalous position in which not a single nation 
recognizes Jerusalem as our capital. All foreign embassies are 
located in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, European governments, with Britain 
often in the lead have invested vast resources ... in promoting Arab 
claims to east Jerusalem (and the West Bank).... In this particular 
rivalry, we side with the Jewish groups, because whatever 
arrangements may ultimately be negotiated for sharing Jerusalem, 
mainstream Israelis will insist on unfettered access to Mount Scopus 
via Sheikh Jarrah.... That said, we are not enthusiastic about the 
purchase of property or the construction of Jewish residential 
housing in heavily Arab neighborhoods when not dictated by strategic 
imperatives. Jews and Arabs are destined to share this city. Both 
peoples would be wise to avoid actions that exacerbate tensions." 
 
 
IV. "They are So Extreme" 
 
Middle East security columnist Amos Gilboa wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (8/4): "Hamas recently launched a rhetorical 
"smiley" onslaught.... Khaled Mashal declared ... that Hamas was not 
opposed in principle to the establishment of a Palestinian state 
.... Prime Minister Ismail Haniya declared that for the sake of 
ending the "occupation," Hamas would not be an obstacle to the 
establishment of a Palestinian state.... top Hamas members called on 
the West to begin to hold a dialogue with their government.... There 
were those here who assessed that Hamas was becoming more 
moderate.... Whether there is something to this assessment or not, 
what is important is what is actually taking place in the Gaza 
Strip. A recently published study by the Intelligence and Terrorism 
Information Center opens a window understanding this process.... 
Hamas is tightening its control over the population in Gaza, and is 
preparing for the long term.... the segregation between the Gaza 
Strip and Judea and Samaria is growing.... Most of the ideas on the 
issue of the agreement between us and Abu Mazen-such as the "road 
map" or the "two state" idea-in practice are becoming not 
realistic." 
 
 
¶V. "Growing Pains" 
 
Senior Op-Ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (8/4): "... Netanyahu boasted of the fact that 
economic growth in the West Bank had reached seven percent.... 
Without the assistance, though, of the European and American 
taxpayer, who are paying the salaries of the Palestinian Authority 
... the economy of the West Bank would long since have collapsed 
along with the PA.... The Palestinian economy is not recovering 
thanks to Israel, but in spite of it.... According to the current 
report of the International Monetary Fund ... 2009 would end with 7 
percent growth ... a statistic that will, for the first time in 
three years, represent a substantial improvement in the standard of 
living.... To achieve that goal, it will not be enough to make an 
announcement to the press about the marvels of the Palestinian 
economy.... The prime minister would do well to listen to the stone 
and marble producers in Hebron and their Israeli partners. Let him 
ask them what damage is being caused to the industry due to 
arbitrary and illogical decisions by the security officials in 
charge of the border crossings."
