SUBJECT: RESPONSE: MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AUTHORIZATIONS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 101996 
 
¶1.  The Embassy Caracas officer in charge of marine 
scientific research authorizations is Veronica Millares (Sept 
2009 - Mar 2010).   Ms. Millares, back up is Economic 
Counselor Darnall Steuart. 
 
¶2.  To request an authorization, OPA must submit relevant 
documents to Embassy Caracas for submission to the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs which will in turn submit them to the 
Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Environment and Natural 
Resources, and Ministry of Science, Technology, and 
Intermediate Industry.  The  required documentation includes: 
      -Complete and updated list of the entire crew and 
scientific personnel aboard the vessel, including their 
nationalities, passport numbers, and their roles in the 
project, as well as photocopies of the passports of the 
ship,s captain and  project leader; 
      -Registration, including all data and features of the 
research vessel; 
      -Complete itinerary of the route with detailed 
information on  the Venezuelan ports that will be used; 
      -Direct and indirect environmental impact assessment of 
the project; 
      -Detailed and complete description of the project as 
well as the planned participation of a Venezuelan counterpart 
scientist; 
      -Curriculum vitae of the leading project  scientist as 
well as that of the  Venezuelan scientist counterpart  (in 
the past the Ministry of Science, Technology, and 
Intermediate Industry has suggested that inquiries concerning 
Venezuelan institutions with an interest in a particular 
project  be directed to Mr. Perez Nieto, President of the 
Oceanology Commission  58 416 605 6589); 
      -Digital copy of final report and all other information 
once research is completed. 
 
¶3.  Although the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela (GBRV) states this process will take a minimum of 
three months, this is probably an underestimate.  In 2006, 
the GBRV issued a research authorization to the R/V PELICAN 
following two denials.   However, given the current state of 
relations with the GBRV, it would be difficult to expedite 
any authorization through the bureaucracy or to lobby on its 
behalf.
