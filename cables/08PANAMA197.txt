(C) "Panama is very interested in working through the UN 
Security Council to combat piracy, not only in Somalia, but 
also throughout the world," Panamanian DG for External 
Affairs Javier Bonagas told POLCOUNS on March 5.  Bonagas 
noted that Panama had the world's largest maritime fleet, 
with an estimated 7,000 Panamanian-flagged vessels, crossing 
the world's oceans at any time.  "Our vessels have been the 
victims of piracy off of Somalia and in the Straits of 
Malacca."  Bonagas said that Panama had contemplated focusing 
on piracy during its February UNSC presidency, but decided 
against doing so as Panama did not want to "draw special 
attention to Panama or Panamanian-flagged vessels."  Post 
believes that Panama would be highly interested in joining a 
UNSC effort to combat piracy that is specific to Somalia as 
it provides an opportunity to enhance protection for its 
extensive fleet without having to draw a spotlight to itself.
