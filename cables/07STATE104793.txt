SECURITY MECHANISM 
 
REF: STATE 99425 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request for Embassy Kampala, please 
see paragraph two. 
 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post is asked to approach the Government of Uganda 
(GOU) to pursue the following objective: 
 
--  Seek agreement to take specific actions outlined below as 
the lead contingent in the African Union Mission in Somalia 
(AMISOM) to establish the Joint Security Mechanism (JSM) for 
the Somalia National Reconciliation Conference (NRC). 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Immediate action is needed to establish the JSM and 
create a secure environment for genuine political dialogue 
and reconciliation in Somalia.  As the only country currently 
deployed under AMISOM, the lead on this action falls to 
Uganda and to the Ugandan People's Defense Force (UPDF) 
currently deployed in Mogadishu.  Specific actions needed to 
achieve this objective are as follows: 
 
-- Call a meeting at the AMISOM headquarters in Mogadishu as 
soon as possible.  Participants at this meeting should 
include a representative from the TFG, most likely the Chief 
of Police, a representative from the National Governance and 
Reconciliation Committee (NGRC), and representatives from 
each clan (Hawiye, Darood, Rahanweyn, and Dir) participating 
in the Congress. Ethiopia (Col. Ghebre) should be invited to 
participate as a liaison.  AMISOM might also consider 
inviting the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to 
attend as an observer given their role in providing 
logistical support and overseeing the Rule of Law and 
Security (ROLS) program. 
 
-- At this meeting, the UPDF/AMISOM representative should ask 
participants to review the existing security arrangements for 
the Congress, beginning with a briefing from the TFG and 
Ethiopian representatives. The UPDF should invite comments 
from other representatives and help identify points of action 
for follow-up (i.e., security arrangements at hotels, 
agreement on VIP and bodyguard protocol). 
 
-- The UPDF/AMISOM should ensure that the JSM meets a minimum 
of once a week to review security arrangements for the 
Congress, and should also meet on an as-needed basis to 
coordinate the response to specific security 
threats/incidents. 
 
-- Once the equipment for the Congress arrives in Mogadishu, 
AMISOM (as the chair of the JSM) should make every effort to 
visit the Congress venue regularly to review security 
arrangements at the Congress. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The United States is actively supporting the NRC and 
plans to use FY07 Supplemental peacekeeping (PKO) funds to 
procure the equipment necessary to help secure the Congress 
venue, including metal detectors, mobile phone signal 
jammers, mine and bomb detectors, and communications 
equipment.  As outlined in reftel, this assistance can only 
be provided via AMISOM as chair of the JSM.  While AMISOM 
will be able to allow the TFG security forces at the Congress 
to operate some equipment, an AMISOM role in providing 
oversight through the JSM is crucial. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post may also wish to use the following talking 
points in their discussions with government representatives: 
 
-- We recognize and appreciate the Uganda Peoples Defense 
Force (UPDF) being the sole force contributor to AMISOM. 
 
-- Given that the UPDF is the only force deployed under 
AMISOM and Major General Karahunga is the AMISOM commander, 
we need Uganda's AMISOM contingent to take the lead in 
coordinating security for the National Reconciliation 
Congress through the Joint Security Mechanism. 
 
-- We further recognize that the UPDF/AMISOM cannot guarantee 
nor provide security for each of the 900 participants.  We 
want AMISOM to not only participate, but serve as the 
chairman of the JSM.  As such, AMISOM needs to convene and 
begin the JSM process to coordinate security for the NRC.
