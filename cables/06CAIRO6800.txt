¶1.  (U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE.  PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) EMBOFF RAISED REFTEL DEMARCHE WITH STAFF AT THE 
ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARIAT AND THE EGYPTIAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS, STRESSING USG VIEWS TOWARD THE AL'S ISRAEL BOYCOTT. 
ACCORDING TO CONTACTS AT THE MFA, EGYPT IS AWARE THAT THE 
LEAGUE'S BOYCOTT COMMITTEE WILL MEET IN DAMASCUS IN NOVEMBER, 
BUT WERE UNAWARE OF A DATE.  THE MFA STAFF CONFIRMED THAT 
EGYPT DOES NOT ATTEND THE MEETINGS, SINCE IT HAS NORMAL 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL.  SENIOR AL STAFF WERE 
LIKEWISE UNAWARE OF THE DAMASCUS MEETING DATE, NOTING THAT 
THE ISSUE WAS NOT HIGH ON THE SECRETARIATS AGENDA.  STILL, 
RESPONDING TO REFTEL DEMARCHE, LEAGUE STAFF POINTED OUT THAT 
THE "TIME WAS NOT RIGHT" TO SEEK AN END TO THE BOYCOTT DUE TO 
ONGOING VIOLENCE AND STRIFE IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.
