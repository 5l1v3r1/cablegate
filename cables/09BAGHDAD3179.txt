¶1. (SBU) Summary: Post's Emergency Assistance Coordination 
Team continues to monitor recovery efforts from the December 
8 bombings to coordinate USG assistance.  At the GOI's 
request, PRT Baghdad sent four teams of cadaver dogs to 
search two blast sites. The Higher Judicial Council (HJC) 
reported extensive damage at its Karkh Courthouse, which it 
had been using as temporary headquarters following the 
October bombs. HJC is looking to relocate once more and is 
compiling a list of immediate equipment needs for possible 
USG assistance. Ministry of Finance (MOF) officials are still 
making assessments but expect the building suffered serious 
infrastructure damage. International organizations are 
providing some medical supplies to hospitals and making 
assessments to aid vulnerable groups who live near the blast 
sites. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MoLSA) 
suffered minimal damage contrary to early press reports. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On December 10, PRT Baghdad's Fire Services team 
responded to a request from the Iraqi Civil Defense 
Directorate with four teams of cadaver dogs to search blast 
sites at the Karkh Courthouse and the MOF site in Rusafah. 
(Note: Cadaver dogs were also deployed to the bomb sites 
following the October 25 blasts. End note). The teams worked 
closely with MND-Baghdad and MNC-I on security and 
transportation to the sites.  Rubble and scattered remains 
impeded a thorough search. Although the teams did not locate 
any remains, ICDD expressed appreciation for our quick 
response to their request. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) INL met with the HJC's DG of Finance, who is acting 
as HJC's senior DG since DG Haddad was seriously injured in 
the October 25 bombing. HJC engineers told us the Karkh 
Courthouse, which it had been using as temporary quarters 
following the October attack, suffered extensive damage with 
127 injuries and seven deaths. Recovery efforts are 
continuing, along with debris removal. Meanwhile, HJC is 
making plans to relocate its court activities once again and 
must find space to handle its usual 4000 weekly visitors. INL 
is compiling a list of immediate equipment needs and security 
upgrades requested by the HJC. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) MOF officials told us they are still making 
assessments but expect to find serious infrastructure damages 
to the building. We will deliver several laptops this 
weekend, which were previously approved following the October 
bombing. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) International Medical Corps has provided 1000 IV 
sets, 500 catheters, bandages, and other equipment to Medical 
City and Al Kindy Hospital. The International Organization 
for Migration (IOM) is conducting an assessment with the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at four 
bomb sites. IOM and UNHCR will assess if vulnerable groups 
require non-food items, home repairs, and water supply 
assistance. ICRC's head of delegation told us they are 
sending two War Wounded Kits to hospitals and standing by to 
deliver more as needed. The UK, EU, Swedish, and Danish 
missions confirmed they had not received any specific 
requests from the GOI and had no plans to provide assistance. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) USAID's Tatweer implementers reported they had been 
conducting training at MoLSA at the time of the bombs. Aside 
from several broken windows, there was no damage to the MOLSA 
building, which did not appear to be a target, contrary to 
initial press reports.
