SUBJECT: RGC RESPONSE TO USG-PROPOSED ARF INITIATIVES 
 
REF: STAT 33907 
 
¶1.  (U)  Pol/Econ Chief delivered reftel demarche to Nuon 
Chivorn, MFA Deputy Director for ASEAN Affairs.  Chivorn said 
that he would share the proposals with his colleagues but did 
not offer any initial response.  He noted that the RGC did 
not plan to send anyone from Phnom Penh to the March 28-30 
meeting in Helsinki.  Rather, the MFA would send an official 
from the Cambodian Embassy in London, possibly their 
ambassador, to the meeting.  Chivorn said that the MFA would 
pass the proposals to their London mission after the MFA has 
finished its review of the materials. 
 
¶2.  (U)  We will report any further reaction to the demarche 
and the USG proposals.
