¶1. (U) Per reftel demarche, we notified Arab League African 
Affairs Department Director Samir Hosni on April 22 that the 
UN Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) 
plans to chair the International Contact Group (ICG) on 
Somalia after the next ICG meeting in Oslo, with the 
discretion to include new participants or determine the 
composition of any new subgroups.  We delivered the same 
message to Egyptian MFA cabinet advisor for African Affairs 
Ahmed Abu Zeid on April 24; neither had a substantive 
response. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Abu Zeid raised Egyptian concerns over two separate 
efforts to improve international efforts to combat piracy off 
the Somali coast, one in the UN Security Council (UNSC) in 
New York and the second in the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) in London.  The GOE views this piracy as 
an important issue to address, he said, but warned that "we 
have to be cautious" not to limit the sovereignty of 
countries in the region over their waters.  As "most of the 
piracy is in the Indian Ocean," the GOE wants to see 
international anti-piracy efforts confined to the Indian 
Ocean, and not address the Red Sea, he added.
