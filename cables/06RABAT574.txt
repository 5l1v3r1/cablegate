BEGIN TEXT:  "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presents its 
compliments to the United States Embassy in Rabat and in 
reference to the Embassy's note number 102 of March 21 2006 
containing the U.S. Government's proposal for paragraphs 3 
and 4 of Article VIII of the draft Agreement on Science and 
Technology Cooperation, has the honor to communicate the 
following observations of the Moroccan side: 
 
1) The proposed text for paragraph 3 of Article VIII is in 
conformity with Moroccan legislation and for this reason does 
not raise any objection. 
 
2)  Concerning paragraph 4 of Article VIII of the draft 
Agreement, which stipulates that the Moroccan Executive Agent 
shall serve as the sole recipient of record of U.S. 
assistance destined to be used by entities other than those 
listed in paragraph 3, the (tax) exonerations proposed are 
not in conformity with Moroccan legislation in force, and 
cannot be granted.  As such, it is proposed that paragraph 4 
of Article VIII be eliminated from the Agreement. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes this opportunity to 
renew to the Embassy the assurance of its highest 
consideration."  END TEXT.
