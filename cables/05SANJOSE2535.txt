REF: STATE 199305 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff discussed reftel demarche with Carlos 
Cordero, Director for Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign 
Ministry, on November 1.  Cordero was joined by UN Affairs 
Officer Victor Murillo and Director for Bilateral Policy 
Ronald Obaldia.  In response to our concerns about the Swiss 
proposal, Cordero stressed that the text is only a proposal 
at this point.  Costa Rica's support for the proposal stems 
from its view that the Security Council does not reflect the 
modern world.  Cordero stated that Costa Rica supports what 
he called the consensus view that the Council must accept new 
members.  Costa Rica's vision, according to Cordero, is for a 
more accountable and transparent Security Council.  For this 
reason, Costa Rica calls for any new members to be 
non-permanent.  Once chosen, a new permanent member would 
have no obligation to respond to non-Security Council 
members.  However, if any new members were non-permanent and 
could be reelected, they would have an incentive to be more 
responsive. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cordero carefully noted our argument that the 
proposal further inflames divisions between the General 
Assembly and the Security Council, and promised to consult 
further on that point.
