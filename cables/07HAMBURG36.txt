¶1. (U) On May 11, the German Federal High Court in Karlsruhe 
announced its decision to reject 9/11 cell member Mounir 
el-Motassadeq's appeal of the January 8 verdict of the Hamburg 
Regional Court that convicted Motassadeq of membership in a 
terrorist organization and of 246 counts of accessory to murders 
that took place in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  The Court also 
upheld the Hamburg Regional Court's January 8 fifteen-year 
prison sentence (Ref A) making Hamburg's decision legally 
binding. 
 
¶2. (U) After five-and-a-half years of legal battles, this was 
Motassadeq's final appeal in the German court system and so he 
will continue to serve his sentence.  The High Court found 
Motassadeq's appeal "unfounded" and said its re-examination of 
the January 8 decision did not reveal any legal errors. 
Motassadeq's defense lawyer Udo Jacob told the press that he 
intends to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights. 
Calling the German courts' decisions "arbitrary," Jacob claimed 
that his client had been convicted based on "speculation" and 
that acquitted Hamburg cell member Abdelghani Mzoudi was willing 
to testify (Ref D). 
 
¶3. (U) This message has been coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
