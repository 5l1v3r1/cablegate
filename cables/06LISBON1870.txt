 Â¶1. (SBU)  Acting MFA Middle East Director Isabel Pedrosa 
informed Post that Portugal was unlikely to make any 
additional financial contributions to Lebanon (beyond the 
200,000 euros already donated) for budgetary reasons until 
the end of the year at which time the government would review 
the situation.  She added that Portuguese Institute for 
Development Assistance Vice President Manuel Correia 
represented Portugal at the Stockholm Conference but made no 
announcement on financial assistance.  Pedrosa underscored 
that Portugal remained committed to assisting Lebanon, noting 
Portugal's Aug 29 decision to send an Engineering Company to 
UNIFIL as well as previous in-kind contributions, i.e. C-130 
flights delivering tons of supplies in early August.
