SUBJECT: AMENDED REQUEST FOR FRENCH AND ARABIC TRANSLATION 
OF THE 2007 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 151772 
 
     ¶B. RABAT 1698 
 
¶1.  Per the points conveyed Ref A, Post requested Language 
Services' assistance in translating the 2007 Human Rights 
Report from English to Arabic on November 5 (Ref B).  English 
to French translation was to have been procured locally, 
replicating the procedure used in 2006. 
 
¶2.  Subsequent to the November 5 request, Post's senior 
French translator retired, significantly diminishing in-house 
translation capabilities pending successful recruitment of a 
replacement. 
 
¶3.  As a result, Post amends reftel request to include 
Language Services' support in translating both the Arabic and 
French versions of the 2007 Morocco Human Rights Reports. 
 
¶4.  Alternatively, Post could procure a translation locally, 
but would need a fund cite.
