SUBJECT: SECRETARY LEAVITT,S MEETING WITH GUATEMALAN 
VICE-FOREIGN MINISTER ANDRADE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: On January 9, 2007, the U.S. Presidential 
Delegation (Presdel), led by Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Secretary Michael Leavitt, discussed with Guatemalan Vice 
Foreign Minister Luis Fernando Andrade a new regional 
health-care training initiative; the Guatemalan Government's 
(GOG) interest in participating in the Millennium Challenge 
Account (MCA); bilateral immigration concerns; and, popular 
perceptions of U.S.-Guatemalan relations.  Andrade indicated 
Guatemala wishes to participate in the health initiative, 
even though the program must "catch up to the Cubans, who are 
ten years ahead."  He requested Millennium Challenge 
Corporation (MCC) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) John 
Danilovich to visit Guatemala at the earliest opportunity to 
discuss the viability of Guatemala's participation in the 
MCA, while the Vice Foreign Minister also acknowledged 
Guatemala's eligibility will be difficult.  Andrade asserted 
positive bilateral relations are especially important during 
Guatemala's 2007 electoral year.  End Summary. 
 
GOG Welcomes Health Initiative, Notes Long-Standing Cuban 
Medical Presence 
- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Secretary Leavitt outlined his vision for the new 
regional health initiative, which includes a regional 
training facility in Panama and the training of hundreds of 
health workers from the region per year, with particular 
emphasis on health providers from rural areas, such as 
nurses, technicians and community health workers.  He 
described the next steps in the program -- drafting a 
Memorandum of Understanding, visiting the participating 
countries, and possibly signing the agreement in a regional 
venue -- and added he had spoken to officials from the 
Guatemalan Health Ministry about the project.  The Secretary 
clarified the health initiative arose from a meeting of 
Central American Ministers of Health in June 2006. 
 
¶3.  (C) Vice Foreign Minister Andrade welcomed Secretary 
Leavitt's announcement of the new initiative and mentioned 
that the Guatemalan Minister of Health had briefed his 
Government on the project.  He confirmed Guatemala wishes to 
participate in the program, even though it is "late," and 
will require "catching up to the Cubans, who are ten years 
ahead."  Andrade explained Guatemala cannot refuse any offer 
of help that addresses Guatemala's "human needs and social 
demands."  Therefore, Guatemala has relied on Cuban medical 
programs, despite the political risks entailed, he said. 
(COMMENT: The Vice Foreign Minister appeared to criticize 
implicitly the United States for having left the Cuban 
efforts in medical diplomacy unchecked for so long and 
clearly displayed some discomfort about the political work 
the Cubans are doing in rural areas of Guatemala.  Of all the 
meetings Secretary Leavitt had on the health initiative on 
the margins of the Ortega inauguration, the Guatemalans were 
the most candid about the costs and benefits of Cuban 
interventions in health in the region.  END COMMENT.) 
 
¶4.  (C) Vice Foreign Minister Andrade next broached his 
Government's keen interest in Guatemala's achieving 
eligibility for, and eventually participating in, an MCA 
program.  To facilitate this objective, he invited Ambassador 
Danilovich to visit Guatemala "at the earliest opportunity." 
Ambassador Danilovich assured Andrade he would welcome 
Guatemala's participation in the MCA, while clarifying that 
meeting the MCA's eligibility indicator criteria is essential 
to participation.  He confirmed his interest in visiting 
Guatemala and the MCC's interest in assisting Guatemala in 
its efforts to qualify for the program. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Vice Foreign Minister Andrade recognized that 
Guatemala's "culture of violence" is beyond one's 
imagination, and disadvantages Guatemala vis a vis MCA 
eligibility.  He ventured that the high rate of unemployment 
among youth is part of the problem.  The Secretary noted that 
given his home state of Utah's experience in managing a high 
population growth rate and young population, perhaps Utah 
could help Guatemala address its gang problem.  Andrade was 
receptive to the suggestion and indicated he will follow up 
on the matter with the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City. 
 
Immigration Considerations 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Vice Foreign Minister Andrade next raised the 
impact of U.S. immigration policy on Guatemala and suggested 
the U.S. Congress must reach bipartisan consensus to craft a 
comprehensive immigration program that will resolve 
outstanding immigration issues that affect the Central 
American region.  Andrade cited specific problems with U.S. 
deportations of Guatemalans to their country of origin, 
especially those involved in criminal activity, and sought 
Guatemala's participation in the Temporary Protected Status 
(TPS) program.  Secretary Leavitt suggested that, in addition 
to engaging Congress on immigration concerns, Guatemala 
should approach relevant U.S. States on managing matters 
related to migration. 
 
Improving Bilateral Relations in an Election Year 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7.  (C) Expounding upon his interest in an MCC program and 
TPS for Guatemala, Andrade argued that improved bilateral 
relations are especially vital this year because Guatemala 
will hold national elections in September.  He remarked that 
public perception in Guatemala is that the United States does 
not "consider" Guatemala as much as it does Nicaragua, 
Honduras, and El Salvador, given that the others are MCC 
countries and continue to benefit from TPS.  This public 
perception could be especially problematic in an election 
year, ventured Andrade, who added that the U.S. Ambassador 
and DCM in Guatemala are moving the bilateral relationship in 
a positive direction and are well-versed in Guatemalan 
issues. 
 
The Boon of CAFTA 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Vice Foreign Minister Andrade praised CAFTA by 
remarking the trade agreement offers new opportunities for 
exports and investment.  In addition to the rise in U.S. 
investors, other foreigners are seeking to invest in 
Guatemala, he said.  Andrade cited particular interest in 
establishing call centers in Guatemala and noted his country 
must expand and improve its English-language training 
programs to draw more call-center investment, as employees 
must be fluent in English.  Secretary Leavitt mentioned Utah 
is home to many call centers, in part because many Utah 
residents speak foreign languages, and the state's young 
population offers the workforce the call centers require.  He 
offered to put call-center companies he knows in touch with 
the Guatemalans, a prospect that enthused Andrade. 
 
Narcos Behind Construction Boom? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The Vice Foreign Minister commented that 
Guatemala's macroeconomic indicators are strong, but poverty, 
unemployment and social problems continue to pose serious 
challenges.  Remittances are a boon, he said, and are growing 
about 20 percent annually, which provides much-needed help to 
Guatemala's impoverished rural areas.However, Andrade 
speculated that part of Guatemala's economic strength is 
likely because of narcotraffickers, who are "legalizing" 
their operations by financing the construction of new luxury 
apartment buildings.  He warned these money-laundering 
projects are "mushrooming" in prime parts of Guatemala City 
with no apparent connection to traditional construction 
companies.
