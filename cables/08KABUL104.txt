SUBJECT: POSSIBLE UN ENVOY ASHDOWN THREATENED IN AFGHAN NEWSPAPER 
COLUMN 
 
1) SUMMARY: A recent column in a major Kabul daily compared possible 
UN Special Representative to Afghanistan Lord Paddy Ashdown to 
William Macnaghten, the British envoy to Kabul murdered in 1841, 
during the First Anglo-Afghan War. The column, which detailed 
British double-dealing in Afghanistan since then, called for 
Afghanistan to produce a new Wazir Akhbar Khan, the Afghan leader 
responsible for murdering Macnaghten and hanging his headless body 
before the Kabul bazaar. END SUMMARY. 
 
2) A December 30, 2007 newspaper column in major opposition daily 
newspaper "Arman-e-Millie" entitled "William Hay Macnaghten is 
Coming, Wazir Akhbar Khan Should" reviews British policy in 
Afghanistan since the First Anglo Afghan War of 1839-42. Taking a 
deeply negative view of British machinations in Afghanistan 
culminating with a February, 2007 deal between British forces and 
tribal elders in Musa Qala, Helmand Province that enabled the 
Taliban to capture that district, the author opined that Ashdown's 
tenure would further hinder Afghan progress. 
 
3) Arman-e-Millie is owned by Mir Haider Mutaher, a close associate 
of Marshall Fahim, a central figure in the opposition United Front. 
The newspaper is sympathetic to, but not officially affiliated with, 
the United Front. Media sources assert that Fahim funds the 
newspaper. 
 
4) "The appointment of Mr. Ashdown as the UN Special Representative 
is finalized," wrote the author. "Now the question raised among 
Afghan people is, with the appointment of a British diplomat with 
such a background, and considering what the British have done in 
Afghanistan in the past, what impact will his appointment have on 
developments in Afghanistan?" 
 
5) While some Afghans express a distrust of British motives given 
their long history of "Great Game" plotting and invasion, and some 
minor political factions have expressed displeasure with Ashdown's 
candidacy, the strident tone of the columnist and the significant 
stature of the outlet are notable. More notable still is the 
juxtaposition of Ashdown with the brutally butchered Macnaghten. The 
columnist concluded, "The arrival of Lord Ashdown ... would not be a 
good message for the critical year 2008.  Moreover, it shows the 
ineffectiveness of GOA officials in not being able to raise their 
demands to the international community, especially the United 
States. Nevertheless, Macnaghten is returning and the people of 
[Afghanistan] are dead."
