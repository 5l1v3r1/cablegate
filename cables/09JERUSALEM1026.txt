Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with wire reports on the joint 
press conference between Secretary Clinton and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Lieberman (June 17, Washington). Clinton reiterated the 
importance of halting settlement activities in the Palestinian 
Territories and supporting efforts to reach a peace settlement 
between Palestinians and Israel.  The wires covered the Secretary's 
statements concerning the establishment of a Palestinian state 
living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security.  Meanwhile 
they write that Lieberman rejected the U.S. call for a freeze in 
settlement activity, stating that Israel cannot accept any such 
request.  Lieberman also stated that the Israeli government must 
take into consideration natural growth needs, according to 
reporting. 
 
Al-Quds' leads with continued wire reporting on recent Iranian 
presidential elections and subsequent protests and violence. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Quds front page coverage of an AFP report that 
Israel dismantled a checkpoint at the entrance of the West Bank city 
of Jericho on June 17.  The checkpoint was erected in 2006, 
according to coverage. 
 
All front pages report on the Israeli government's decision on June 
17 to release the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council 
Aziz Dwayk after three years in Israeli prison. 
 
Al-Ayyam's inside coverage included a wire report of President 
Obama's announcement on June 17 of his planned financial overhaul. 
 
 
All dailies run inside coverage of a Wafa report about Consul 
General Walles' meeting with Palestinian Authority President Abbas 
on June 17 in Ramallah.  President Abbas briefed the Consul General 
on the latest developments in the Palestinian Territories and Middle 
East peace efforts.   Abbas reiterated Palestinian Authority 
commitment to the two-state solution and to Roadmap obligations. 
 
All front pages run wire reports about Egypt drafting a 
reconciliation agreement to end Palestinian division.  The agreement 
will be signed on July 7 during a meeting attended by Palestinian 
groups in Cairo.  Senior Fatah leader Abu Najjah noted that the 
Palestinian Authority (PA) will release a number of Hamas members 
from PA custody as a gesture of goodwill. 
 
Al-Quds' front page cites Israeli daily Jerusalem Post in reporting 
that the Israeli organization, "Loyal to the Land of Israel," 
announced plans to establish 30 new settlement outposts in the 
Palestinian Territories this summer as a challenge to Israeli Prime 
Minister Netanyahu's June 14 statements that no new settlements 
would be established. 
 
All dailies run inside coverage of a June 17 ribbon-cutting ceremony 
of the USAID funded Criminal Records Office at the Palestinian 
Authority (PA) Ministry of Justice.  The event was attended by PA 
Prime Minister Fayyad and USAID West Bank/Gaza Mission Director 
Sumka.  Sumka described the new facility as, "a positive step" in 
building PA institutions, according to coverage.  For his part, 
Fayyad confirmed the PA's continuing support to its judicial 
authority and the independence of the judiciary.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title, 
"Shock and the Reason Behind It"(06/18):  "The conditions that 
Netanyahu presented in his [June 14]speech seek to force every Arab 
and every Palestinian to submit to all Israeli plans and Israeli 
interests.  Palestinians can understand Netanyahu and his Israeli 
policy, but they cannot understand the positions of the U.S. and the 
EU... Obama should quickly take practical and balanced steps if he 
cares about his country's interests and image." 
 
2) Al Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, "Are 
these positive signs?" (06/18):  "Egypt is trying hard to support 
national Palestinian reconciliation efforts... Hamas' leaders are 
becoming supportive of any settlement that will end [internal] 
division.  President Obama has also proposed new language and a new 
beginning.  In order for Palestinians to benefit from these positive 
signs, they must end internal division so that Netanyahu is not 
given more chances to justify his continued provocative plans."
