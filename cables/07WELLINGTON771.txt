¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Characterized by voter apathy and predictable 
results, local government elections were held across New Zealand 
over the weekend of October 13-14.  The most noteworthy result was 
in New Zealand's biggest and most politically important metropolitan 
area, Auckland, where the one term centre-left incumbent mayor of 
Auckland City was defeated by the center-right candidate.  Local 
election results are historically no harbinger of national political 
results.  Therefore, the ruling center-left Labour Party would have 
noted Auckland's election of a center-right mayor but it would not 
have been excessively troubled by it.  End Summary. 
 
Results in Key Races 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Over the weekend, cities and town across New Zealand elected 
mayors and local councils.  Overall, there were few surprises with 
most results tracking pre-election polling and predictions.  In 
Auckland City, the country's biggest city, incumbent center-left 
Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard was ousted by the very man who he 
replaced in the previous election, John Banks.  The center-right 
Banks, a former National Party Minister of Police, regained the 
Auckland mayoralty by a very comfortable 10,000 votes.  In the 
nation's capital, sitting Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast 
retained her seat, but lost her deputy Alick Shaw who was voted out 
of local government.  In Christchurch, former TV personality Bob 
Parker rode his strong name recognition to victory. 
 
Voter Apathy a Hallmark of Elections 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) Most noteworthy in these elections was the low voter turnout. 
 A record low 42.5% of eligible voters cast votes in this year's 
elections, down from 46% three years ago.  During New Zealand's last 
general election in 2005, eligible voter turnout was 77% (compared 
to 60% in the United States in 2004).  Local Government New Zealand, 
an organization that represents the national interests of all 85 
councils of New Zealand, is to investigate the downward trend in 
local government voter turnout.  For many municipalities that 
witnessed the defeat of incumbents, the most oft-heard reason 
centered on homeowners' concerns over taxes. 
 
Labour Watchful of Auckland Result 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) As there is little correlation between local politics and a 
national politics, these election results cannot be regarded as a 
portent for next year's general election (reftel).  Labour, 
nonetheless, would have watched the Auckland mayoral race with 
interest, as Labour has traditionally had strong support in 
Auckland.  Given that Auckland provides New Zealand's biggest voting 
pool, any party that expects to win the general election needs to do 
well in Auckland.  Labour is currently trailing National in 
Auckland, however, with 50.3% of Aucklanders favoring National, and 
29% supporting Labour, according to the August Herald Digipoll. 
 
¶5. (SBU) However, post believes the result in Auckland was driven by 
local issues and personality rather than by national politics. 
Aucklanders cast their votes for Banks, not out of support for his 
center-right political values, but rather for his more authoritative 
and forceful personality, characteristics that Hubbard lacked. 
Aucklanders were also disenchanted with Hubbard's stand on some 
local issues, such as tax increases and the debacle over the 
proposed construction of a new sports stadium.
