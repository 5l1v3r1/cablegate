Poloffs discussed the GOM's participation in the August 31 
Stockholm Conference (reftel) with Mohammed Azeroual, 
Director of Multilateral Relations and Global Cooperation in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 25.  Azeroual 
advised that FM Benaissa will lead the Moroccan delegation to 
the conference.  Azeroual said that Morocco has not yet 
decided how much it will be contributing to Lebanon 
reconstruction, but affirmed that the GOM was in constant 
communication with the Lebanese government and stressed the 
importance of coordination with PM Siniora and his ministers. 
 Azeroual expressed hope that the Stockholm Conference will 
provide clarity on assistance mechanisms.
