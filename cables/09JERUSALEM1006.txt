Main Stories: 
------------- 
Prominent coverage of reactions to Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu's June 14 speech continues in all Palestinian media with 
the focus shifting to negative Arab reaction.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
reports on Arab disappointment over the speech's, "clear rejection 
of regional peace requirements" and failure to, "meet the 
expectations of the international community."  All dailies front 
page statements by Palestinian Authority chief negotiator Erekat 
noting to France Press (June 15)that, "after the speech, we realized 
that we are facing an Israeli government that rejects the two-state 
solution and a halt to settlement activity and will not pursue 
negotiations."  Erekat wondered what further U.S. and Middle East 
Quartet reaction to the speech might be. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page coverage on reaction by Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak to Israeli Premier Netanyahu's June 14 speech, noting 
that Israeli's demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish 
state, "ruins all chances of reaching a peace settlement." 
 
Al-Quds' and Al Hayat Al Jadida continue coverage of official U.S. 
and EU reaction to Israeli Premier Netanyahu's June 14 speech. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs a headline that reads, "In his speech, 
Israeli Prime Minister leaves President Obama very little chance of 
achieving peace."  Front page reporting in both papers continues 
with wire coverage noting that the U.S. and EU viewed the speech as, 
"a big step forward" because of Netanyahu's first time statements 
accepting a future Palestinian state.  However, the U.S. and the EU 
did also note that much work has yet to be done in achieving the 
two-state solution, according to reporting.  White House 
spokesperson Robert Gibbs is also quoted welcoming the speech. 
 
Al-Quds and Al Ayyam run similar inside and back page political 
cartoons showing oversized Israeli tanks towering over unarmed 
Palestinian civilians under captions alluding to Prime Minister 
Netanyahu's proposed demilitarized Palestinian state. 
 
Al-Ayyam leads with and Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida run front 
page coverage of Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Fayyad 
comments on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's June 14 speech at his 
weekly cabinet meeting in Ramallah on June 15.  Fayyad noted that 
"Netanyahu's speech, "is a new challenge that hinders regional peace 
efforts and has weakened chances of opening negotiations based on 
the Roadmap and the Arab Peace Initiative."  Fayyad added that the 
speech was vague and did not offer anything tangible, according to 
coverage. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page runs a wire story about Israeli Premier 
Netanyahu's June 15 interview with a "U.S. media outlet."  Netanyahu 
noted that he hopes to reduce conflict with President Obama over 
settlement activity in light of President Obama's insistence on a 
complete halt to settlement activity in the Palestinian 
Territories. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage citing wafa on reaction 
to Israeli Premier Netanyahu's June 14 speech by Palestinian 
Authority (PA) negotiator Quray stating that the PA rejects the 
vision presented by Netanyahu in his speech.  Quray reiterated that 
a, "Palestinian state must be established with full sovereignty over 
all occupied territories from 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital 
and the right of return for all Palestinian refugees based on UN 
resolution 194, according to coverage.  Quray also stressed that the 
PA will not accept any transitional or temporary solutions.

Al-Quds's front page reports on Middle East Quartet Envoy Blair's 
visit to Gaza on June 15 to, "learn more about the daily suffering 
of the people of Gaza."  Blair met with UNRWA officials, Palestinian 
businessmen and NGO representatives.  He noted in a press conference 
that he hopes that Hamas will change its policies in order to pave 
the way for a future peace agreement, reporting concludes.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Regular columnist Omar Hilmi Al-Ghul opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
official daily under the title, "Who will respond to Netanyahu? 
"(06/16):  "Unfortunately, President Obama welcomed Netanyahu's 
speech even though it challenged all that President Obama had called 
for in his Cairo speech in terms of settlement activity and 
recognition of the two-state solution.  By welcoming this racist, 
war-oriented  speech, Obama tried to hide the fact that Netanyahu's 
vision was shocking to him... Arabs should now call on President 
Obama to fulfill the promises and commitments he has made to the 
Palestinians and the region." 
 
 
2) Hani Al-Masri opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "Netanyahu's speech, a state with self-rule"(06/16): 
"Obama's administration welcomed Netanyahu's speech and considered 
it a step forward.  This welcome raises more than one question about 
how much progress this [U.S.]administration will make (in peace 
efforts) ... and how serious it is in implementing [its vision for 
peace].  If Obama wants to maintain his credibility, he has to at 
least hold Israel accountable to his requests, i.e. acceptance of 
the two-state solution and halting settlement activity."
