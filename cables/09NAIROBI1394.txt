SUBJECT: SOMALIA - SPORADIC FIGHTING CONTINUES NEAR TFG 
HEADQUARTERS ON JULY 6 
 
¶1. (SBU) Our contacts tell us sporadic fighting continued on 
July 6 in the Karaan and Shibis districts of Mogadishu. 
According to Somali Ambassador to Kenya Mohammed Nur, TFG 
forces held their ground.  Intelligence Chief Mohammed Sheikh 
stated the TFG had plans to counter-attack, perhaps with help 
from AMISOM. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al-Shabaab forces still occupied recently captured 
areas between Behaani and the Global Hotel, parts of Leedo 
near the old seaport and Marino.  Importantly, these areas' 
citizens are predominantly President Sheikh Sharif's 
Hawiye/Abgal clansmen.  Al-Shabaab's continued presence in 
these areas suggests the President's own clan is unwilling or 
powerless to evict al-Shabaab.  Other contacts tell us TFG 
commanders Musa Sude "Gamadhule," Indha Adde, and Police 
Commissioner "Qeybdiid" were leading the fighting, but were 
hampered by distrust of one another and poor coordination. 
Qeybdiid denied there were tensions between the commanders, 
but complained AMISOM was rationing ammunition too strictly 
to the TFG. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  AMISOM forwarded to us reports that on July 7, 14 
al-Shabaab were killed in fighting at the Sana'a junction, 
southwest of Ba'aad Market.  AMISOM also reported their 
sources tell of low morale among both the al-Shabaab and TFG 
forces, due to persistent fighting and problems re-supplying. 
 On two recent occasions TFG patrols interdicted al-Shabaab 
movements of weapons, according to AMISOM.  In one case 11 
AK-47 rifles and 10 boxes of ammunition were found hidden 
under relief aid bound for IDPs in Galgaduud.  TFG officials 
confiscated the weapons and ammunition, arrested two Abgal 
businessmen associated with the shipment, then sent the 
relief supplies on to their destination.  The TFG continues 
to investigate the incident. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Separately, the TFG released pictures of the faces 
of two purported foreign fighters killed in fighting July 1. 
The photos give the fighters' identities as a Pakistani 
"general" possibly involved in the murder of a nun in 
Mogadishu in 2008, and an Eritrean "colonel."  A third 
photograph is of the corpse of Khalid bin Walid brigade 
commander Abu Khalid, who comes from "Northeast Somalia" 
according to the TFG.
