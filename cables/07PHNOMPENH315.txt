¶1.  (C)  Summary.  The Ambassador called on MFA Secretary of 
State Ouch Borith on February 22 at the latter's request, and 
used the occasion to raise reftel demarche points regarding 
Burma.  Borith, however, was more eager to discuss North 
Korean affairs, and related his recent discussions with 
Japanese officials in Tokyo on abduction issues. He mentioned 
that the Iranians have again invited a Cambodian delegation 
to Tehran (the MFA again declined).  The MFA official 
apologized for continued RGC nonresponsiveness on the 
USG-proposed shipboarding agreement, and complained that the 
South Koreans have indicated their desire to compete for the 
rotational chair on the UNSC in 2013 that the Cambodians are 
seeking.  End Summary. 
 
 
Burma 
----- 
 
¶2.  (C)  On February 22, the Ambassador and Pol/Econ Chief 
met with MFA Secretary of State Ouch Borith, and the 
Ambassador raised the points outlined in reftel regarding USG 
proposed next steps.  Borith was noncommittal on the 
appointment of a Special Envoy but assured us that the RGC 
remains committed to helping on the issue of Burma.  He noted 
that Prime Minister Hun Sen will be visiting Burma in May or 
June, and reiterated the PM's suggestion that his government 
and the USG discuss Burma in greater detail beforehand.  He 
said that the RGC would welcome USG suggestions for topics of 
discussion and requests that Hun Sen should make to the 
regime.  The Ambassador thanked Borith, adding that the 
upcoming visit by EAP DAS Eric John would be an opportune 
time to share views on the PM's trip. 
 
North Korea, PSI, UNSC Seat 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  Borith was much more expansive on the issue of North 
Korea, having recently returned from a visit to Russia and 
Japan, where he had learned of recent developments 
surrounding the Six-Party Talks.  Borith noted that Japanese 
officials remain adamant that the GOJ will not normalize 
relations with North Korea unless the abduction issue is 
resolved and a full accounting of those abducted is provided 
to the GOJ.  Borith said that while progress on the North 
Korean nuclear issue must be encouraged, it is impossible to 
trust the North Korean leadership. 
 
¶4.  (C)  The USG-proposed shipboarding agreement, explained 
Borith, remains under discussion within the RGC.  The MFA 
official apologized for the delay in providing a response, 
saying that there is little expertise or understanding of the 
legal concepts contained in the text.  Pol/Econ Chief 
responded that the Embassy had learned of a planned PSI 
experts meeting in New Zealand, which could afford an 
opportunity for USG officials to discuss the draft agreement 
with the RGC in greater depth.  Borith said that a full 
discussion would be welcome, adding that Cambodia is prepared 
to cooperate on any interdictions related to WMD. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Turning to Cambodia's bid for a rotational seat on 
the UNSC in 2013, Borith told us that the South Korean 
government had informed the MFA that South Korea would also 
seek the seat, and asked that Cambodia consider their bid in 
the spirit of friendly competition.  Borith said that 
Cambodia had been aware that Bhutan was also seeking the 
seat, but the news of South Korea's entry was unwelcome.  He 
explained that Cambodia has withdrawn an earlier bid for a 
rotational seat in 2000-2001 in favor of South Korea. 
Moreover, the South Koreans had already approached the UN 
Secretariat before informing the Cambodian government.

Borith said that Cambodia has already been assured of support 
from 35 countries, and hoped that the USG would also support 
Cambodia's candidacy.  The Ambassador promised to convey 
Cambodia's request to Washington. 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶6.  (C)  Borith told us that the Iranian Ambassador based in 
Hanoi paid him a call on February 21 and asked for the 
Cambodian government's position vis-a-vis the Iranian nuclear 
issue.  The Iranian Ambassador requested that the RGC send a 
delegation to visit Tehran to learn more about the Iranian 
government's policy on nuclear issues.  Borith said that this 
was not the first time the GOI has invited the RGC for a 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000315  002 OF 002 
 
 
visit.  Borith said that the RGC lacks the finances for such 
a visit, and told the Iranian Ambassador that it would not be 
possible. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  (C)  We would welcome Department guidance on what we 
should recommend to PM Hun Sen regarding Burma. We would 
suggest developing some briefing material on the various 
issues of concern to the USG (political prisoners, treatment 
of ethnic minorities, child soldiers, etc.) that could be 
shared with the PM's office in advance.  We could also have 
any briefing material translated into Khmer, so that the PM 
would be well briefed in advance of any meeting.  End Comment.
