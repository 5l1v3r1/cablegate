¶1. DCM spoke October 24 with MFA Second Territorial 
Department Director Ihor Hrushko to relay ref A request for 
Ukraine to consider contributing helicopters or other 
critical force multipliers/enablers required for the 
UN/African Union hybrid peacekeeping operation in Darfur, 
Sudan (UNAMID).  DCM stressed that the U.S. places a high 
priority on a successful UNAMID mission and underscored the 
significant contribution that Ukraine's unique airlift and 
transportation support could make to future stability in 
Darfur.  Hrushko promised to convey the urgency and 
importance of the U.S. request to appropriate offices and 
invited DCM to discuss the matter further with himself and 
the relevant MFA officials on October 26.  We will provide a 
follow-up report on the results of the meeting.
