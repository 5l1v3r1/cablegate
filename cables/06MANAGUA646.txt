¶1. (U) The National Assembly approved remaining CAFTA-DR 
legislative obligations with March 21 votes for reforms of 
the Patent Law, the Trademark Law and the Special Law on 
Crimes against International Commerce or International 
Investment, and ratification of the Budapest Treaty.  These 
votes came with much larger margins than the Thursday, March 
16 votes for reforms to the Copyright Law and the Law for 
Protection of Satellite Signals and Broadcast Rights, which 
squeaked through with 48 votes and the required minimum of 47 
votes respectively, without opposition. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Political reconsideration to reengage on the CAFTA 
votes by the Liberal Party (PLC), which had tried 
unsuccessfully last week to trade a CAFTA pony for an amnesty 
jackass, yielded votes between 60 and 74 in favor of the 
numerous articles associated with the March 21 victory on 
CAFTA legislation.  Neither opposing nor abstaining votes 
were registered, though a number of deputies ) in the 
mid-teens ) were present but did not vote.  According to 
Assembly staffers and AMCHAM President Rene Gonzalez, no 
organized party tactics were associated with the present but 
not voting phenomenon.  Rather, all sources attributed the 
voting profile to either &cigarette breaks8or &the PLC,s 
lack of discipline.8  Gonzalez added that the PLC had been 
&properly shamed8 into voting for the remaining CAFTA 
legislation. 
 
¶3. (U) MIFIC sources reported to Econoff on March 22 that 
they had worked through the night to prepare the legislative 
package for signature and publication today.  The package was 
already at the National Assembly by 9 a.m. on March 22 
awaiting signature by Assembly President Eduardo Gomez and 
First Secretary Maria Auxiliadora Aleman.  MIFIC planned to 
shuttle the package to the Presidency before Noon for 
President Bolanos, signature and official publication in La 
Gaceta (the local version of the Federal Register).  Econoff 
reminded MIFIC that to be certified for EIF they also must 
publish the signed SPS decree on inspection equivalence and 
any other pending regulations.  Mentioned too was the need to 
resolve quickly the question of compensation for the removal 
of the pocket and lining concessions. 
 
¶4. (U) Minister Arguello is aiming to complete all CAFTA 
requirements by Friday, and pledging to seek certification 
from the USG next week.  He has also "guaranteed" an April 
EIF.  Minister of Foreign Affairs Norman Caldera repeated 
previous requests to Ambassador Trivelli on March 21 for an 
event in Washington celebrating Nicaraguan EIF.
