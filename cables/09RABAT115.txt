¶1.  (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel message inviting Morocco to 
participate in the April Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism (GICNT) Workshop in Garmisch, Germany to Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Head of United Nations Division Azzedine 
Farhane on February 3.  Farhane confirmed on February 6 that 
Morocco will definitely participate in the upcoming 
conference but he was unable to provide specific names. 
Farhane informed Poloff that Morocco will make every effort 
to provide participant information as soon as possible. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Farhane was not able to confirm Morocco's 
availability to moderate the review of one of the seven 
technical sections of the GICNT Nuclear Detection 
Architecture Model Guidelines Document.  Farhane asked 
whether or not French translation would be provided during 
the review.  He suggested that if Morocco were to moderate 
one of the technical sessions, it would be easier for the 
Moroccan technical expert to conduct the moderation in French 
rather than English.  Farhane agreed to discuss this request 
with Moroccan technical experts and will inform DHS POC 
Caroline Bray if Morocco can lead in this capacity.  Post is 
prepared to convey response on the language or other related 
issues.
