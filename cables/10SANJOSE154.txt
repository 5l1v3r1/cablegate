SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK COMPLETED

REF: STATE 1515 
 
¶1. On February 2, we met with Carlos Quesada, a representative of 
Fuego de Indios (the foreign end-user), and conducted the 
post-shipment check on export license 050114240 of a UH-1H Bell 
Helicopter that was exported to Costa Rica in May, 2009.  Post 
confirms the bona fides of Fuego de Indios and that it is dedicated 
to the mining and development of hydroelectric projects in areas of 
limited ground access in the Talamanca Mountains in the Atlantic 
province of Limon.  We assess Fuego de Indios to be a reliable user 
of United States Munitions Lists items.  We reminded Quesada that 
no other company may use the helicopter, nor may it be exported, 
without an approved license from State Department; he acknowledged 
this and was familiar with end-user responsibilities. 
 
 
 
¶2. The Huey helicopter, which is housed at a hangar at the Pavas 
Airport (one of San Jose's local airports), has not yet been used 
for its intended purpose because mining permits have not yet been 
issued by the Costa Rican Ministry of the Environment.  The last 
flight in its log was a maintenance flight before it left the 
United States.  The company expects the mining permits to be issued 
soon and to begin work this year. 
 
 
 
¶3. We verified that the helicopter had been demilitarized that that 
all "hard points" had been removed; we also verified the serial 
number as matching the one listed in reftel.  Attached to this 
cable are some pictures and further documentation (in Spanish) 
verifying the bona fides of this company.
