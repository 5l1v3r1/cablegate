1.(SBU) A May 27 meeting of the JCMB Informal Group of significant 
donor ambassadors failed to reach consensus to hold the third 
quarter JCMB VI meeting in Rome on the margins of the July 3 Rule of 
Law conference.  Germany, the U.K., the EU, and the IFIs opposed the 
proposed Rome JCMB add-on meeting.  However, the group recommended 
that the next JCMB that is held outside Afghanistan could be hosted 
by Italy.  UNAMA will work with its Afghan counterparts to set a 
date later in July to hold JCMB VI in Kabul. 
 
2.(SBU) The group agreed that the overarching discussion theme for 
JCBM VI should be regional economic cooperation.  Energy, elections, 
and DIAG should be specific topics the meeting would address.  Civil 
aviation may also be an issue that may be brought before the Board.
