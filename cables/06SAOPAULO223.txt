¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Sao Paulo State Secretariat for Public 
Security released fourth quarter (October-December, 2005) crime 
statistics for the city of Sao Paulo, the Sao Paulo city outskirts, 
and the state as a whole.  Statewide, violent crime decreased, 
including a marked decrease in homicide and attempted homicide.  The 
city of Sao Paulo also showed a decline in most categories of 
violent crime in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the same 
period of 2004.  End Summary. 
 
VIOLENT CRIME DOWN STATEWIDE 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The State Public Security Secretariat releases data quarterly 
on theft, drug trafficking, kidnapping for ransom, rape, homicide, 
robbery, extortion through kidnapping and many other crimes, 
including very minor offenses.  Overall, 496,066 crimes were 
reported in the fourth quarter of 2005 in Sao Paulo state, compared 
with 503,154 in the same period in 2004, a decrease of approximately 
one percent.  Most categories of violent crime fell.  For example, 
in comparison with the last quarter of 2004, reports of premeditated 
homicide declined 18 percent statewide; robbery resulting in death, 
know as "latrocinio," 30 percent; and rape, 7 percent.  Reported 
attempted homicide decreased by 20 percent.  Most categories of 
reported theft and robbery decreased by approximately 4 to 7 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. 
In contrast to other categories of violent crime, kidnapping for 
ransom increased from 29 cases in the last quarter of 2004 to 41 
cases in same period of 2005. 
 
CITY MURDERS CONTINUE TO DECLINE 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In the city of Sao Paulo, violent crime decreased in several 
categories in the fourth quarter of 2005 in comparison with the 
fourth quarter of 2004.  Reports of premeditated homicide fell from 
767 reported in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 569 in the fourth 
quarter of 2005, a decrease of 26 percent. There was also a 12 
percent decline in the number of reported rapes committed in the 
city.  "Latrocinio" cases fell from 24 cases in the fourth quarter 
of 2004 to 15 during the same period in 2005.  Most categories of 
reported theft and robbery decreased by approximately 3 to 6 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to the same period of 2004. 
The number of reported kidnappings for ransom, however, rose, from 
18 cases in the last quarter of 2004 to 22 cases in the same period 
of 2005. 
 
CRIME RATES HIGH FOR IMPOVERISHED OUTSKIRTS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The outskirts of Sao Paulo City continued to experience a 
high number of serious crimes, though there were declines reported 
in several major categories of violent crime.  Reported homicides 
decreased by 12 percent, from 545 cases in the fourth quarter of 
2004 to 482 cases in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Attempted homicide 
dropped by 18 percent, from 439 cases to 359 cases.  Reported 
"latrocinio" declined slightly.  All categories of theft and robbery 
decreased, with the exception of cargo robberies. However, as in the 
city and state, the number of kidnappings for ransom increased, from 
6 reported cases in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 10 cases for the 
same period of 2005. 
 
¶5. (U) Statewide, the State Secretariat for Public Security reported 
a dramatic 60 percent decline in the number of civilians killed by 
on-duty military police; 141 such cases were reported the fourth 
quarter of 2004, as compared to 56 reported in during the same 
period of 2005.  On-duty civilian police killed 3 civilians in the 
fourth quarter of 2005, compared to 8 during the fourth quarter of 
¶2005.  Killings committed by off-duty civilian and military police 
also declined.  (Comment: Killings of civilians by police officers 
represent one of Brazil's most serious and persistent human rights 
problems; it is unclear whether the reported decline reflects 
changing habits or a change in statistical methodology. End

CONSUL GENERAL MEETS WITH SECRETARY FOR PUBLIC SECURITY 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) On February 17, Consul General (CG) met with Sao Paulo 
State Secretary for Public Security Saulo de Castro Abreu Filho and 
his deputy, Marcelo Martins de Oliveira. The Secretary noted with 
satisfaction the significant decline in the homicide rate but did 
not attribute it to any single cause.  CG and Abreu discussed 
continuing cooperation between ConGen Sao Paulo and law enforcement 
authorities on security-related matters.
