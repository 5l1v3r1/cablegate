¶1.  (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche June 9 to the 
Foreign Ministry's Director General of Consular Affairs 
Felipe Robertti and Passports and Consular Services Director 
Raul Montiel Gasto.  Robertti, who also serves as president 
of the National Commission for Refugees, affirmed that the 
Paraguayan government would accept Cuban migrant Osmar Lopez 
Gonzalo and provide him with migrant documentation.  Robertti 
affirmed Lopez would not be returned to Cuba.  Montiel stated 
that the tourist visa issued to Lopez in 2004 would not be 
valid for immigration purposes but that the Foreign Ministry 
would issue Lopez the proper visa to immigrate to Paraguay. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Robertti noted that Cuban immigrants in Paraguay 
often experience difficulties finding gainful employment and 
adjusting to life.  He noted that Lopez would have a better 
chance at successfully resettling in Paraguay with the 
support of his family (reftel).  (NOTE:  Three of seven 
Cubans who immigrated in November 2006 remain in Paraguay. 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) Paraguay 
Office Director Guillermo Sosa told PolOff in November 2007 
that the remainder relocated to the United States.  Michael 
Ledesma Perez -- one of the seven Cuban emigrees still living 
in Paraguay -- told PolOff in April that neither the 
Paraguayan government nor the IOM had properly assisted him 
with resettlement.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Robertti requested a copy of Lopez' personal 
information provided by PRM to assist the Paraguayan 
government in issuing him a new visa.  Please provide to 
Embassy POC for this request:  Embassy Asuncion Human Rights 
Officer Michael Edwards, telephone:  011-595-21-213-715,
