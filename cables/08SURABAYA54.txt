AUDIENCES IN SOUTH SULAWESI 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: ConGen Surabaya's PAO recently traveled to 
remote regions of South Sulawesi to attend English Teacher 
Training Workshops organized by a participant in the Secondary 
School Educators 2005 program.  Ratna Haris from the Secondary 
Educators State Alumni Association is using a $13,500 grant to 
conduct 11 teacher training workshops all around the island of 
Sulawesi, connecting with thousands of English teachers in many 
areas that would otherwise not be reached by USG programs. This 
project demonstrates how grants can have an important impact in 
distant yet critical areas of Indonesia. 
 
Sulawesi's Remote Interior 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Toraja, a region in the north-central part of South 
Sulawesi Province, does not have an airport and is accessible 
only by a nine-hour automobile trip from the provincial capital 
of Makassar.  The area sees a small number of tourists, due to 
its unique cultural practices involving funerals and interment 
on cliff sides, but there is little other industry besides 
agriculture and almost no opportunities for economic, cultural, 
or academic exchange.  However, during English Teacher Training 
Workshops organized by Secondary School Educators Program 
participant Ratna Haris April 18-19, Surabaya PAO witnessed a 
genuine hunger for improvements in English language instruction. 
 Hundreds of teachers joined the workshop in the town of Makale, 
and dozens more in neighboring Enrekang.  The workshops 
organized by Ratna Haris serve as a very cost-effective model 
which demonstrates the potential of active State Alumni 
Organizations. 
 
Bang for the Buck 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) A high school English teacher in Makassar, Ratna 
participated in the Secondary School Educators Program in 2005. 
In 2007, she received a State Alumni Grant for $13,500 to 
conduct English teacher workshops throughout Sulawesi.  So far 
in FY 2008, Ratna has conducted seven teacher training workshops 
and plans at least four more.  The average attendance at the 
workshops has been over 100, and some teachers have asked if 
they can hold similar smaller workshops in their far-flung 
villages.  In addition to the training itself, participants 
receive a packet of English teaching strategies and techniques. 
Ratna also raises the profile of these events and improves the 
chances of lasting commitment by inviting local education and 
government officials to participate.  Both workshops attended by 
the PAO featured prominent government spokesmen proclaiming 
their support for better English education in local classrooms. 
 
Craving Native Speakers 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) In isolated regions of Indonesia, native English speakers 
are a big draw.  With this in mind, Ratna reached out to English 
Teaching Assistants (ETA), Fulbright English Language Fellows 
(ELF), and Regional English Language Officers (RELO) in addition 
to Consulate staff to speak at events.  She told PAO that there 
was a noticeable difference in attendance at seminars that 
featured an American and those that did not.  Following his 
presentation on U.S. Education, PAO got a sense of the interest 
people have in talking with Americans as he fielded many 
questions about school systems in the U.S., training support for 
American teachers, the No Child Left Behind Program, and dealing 
with children whose native language may not be English.  The 
admiration these teachers had for the importance placed on 
education in America was readily apparent, as was their desire 
to improve English teaching in Indonesian classrooms.  Ratna's 
workshops are a clear example of the impact of programs such as 
ETA, ELF, RELO, and Alumni Associations have in fostering mutual 
understanding between Indonesians and Americans in Indonesia's 
less well-known, far-flung regions.
