¶1. The MFA announced January 13 an increase of Spanish 
humanitarian aid to Southeast Asian countries affected by the 
tsunami to EUR 9.3 million (USD 12.2 million).  This number 
 
SIPDIS 
is in addition to Spain's pledge of EUR 50 million (USD 65.5 
million) in reconstruction credits.  The MFA press release 
indicates the decision to increase aid was made while Foreign 
Minister Moratinos and Secretary of State for International 
Assistance were visiting Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia to 
witness the tsunami,s effects first hand. 
 
¶2. The funds that will be disbursed by the Spanish Aid Agency 
(AECI) include three components.  NGO's focusing on emergency 
action and reconstruction will receive EUR 3 million (USD 3.9 
million).  Multilateral institutions, primarily UN agencies, 
will receive EUR 2 million (USD 2.6 million).  The GOS will 
continue to send direct flights of humanitarian aid to the 
region, which is predicted to reach EUR 4.3 million (USD 5.6 
million). 
 
¶3. Comment.  The increase in Spanish aid announced after the 
Foreign Minister's trip to the tsunami region confirms this 
government's commitment to the victims of the disaster and a 
robust humanitarian aid program.
