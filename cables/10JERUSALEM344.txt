SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/25): More demolition orders 
for homes in East Jerusalem 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------The dailies front page news that the Israeli 
municipality of Jerusalem distributed 12 demolition orders against 
Palestinian houses in Silwan (East Jerusalem), including houses that 
were built before 1967, claiming that they lack the appropriate 
building permits. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that the Israeli 
Minister of Interior said that Israel intends to confiscate land in 
East Jerusalem which belongs to a Palestinian citizen to build a 
parking lot for settlers on it. In related news, Al-Quds and 
Al-Ayyam report on settlers attacking the Ghawi and Hanoun families 
in Sheikh Jarrah yesterday, leading to confrontations between 
Palestinian citizens and the settlers. Six Palestinians were injured 
by tear gas. 
 
Al-Ayyam continues to lead with news on the protests in the West 
Bank (mainly in Hebron) for the third consecutive day against the 
Israeli announcement to add two holy sites in the West Bank to its 
list of heritage sites. Reports note that there will be more 
demonstrations tomorrow throughout the West Bank. Al-Quds reports 
that Yasser Abed Rabbo condemned the Israeli decision and accused 
Israel of confiscating the Palestinian heritage. Abed Rabbo noted 
that the Palestinian Authority (PA) will follow up on this issue 
with all Arab and international bodies. Al-Ayyam, citing Yedioth 
Ahronot, reports that settlers in the West Bank sent a letter to 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging him to add two more 
tombs in Hebron to the list. 
 
The three dailies continue to run front page coverage on 
developments in the investigation of the murder of Hamas leader 
Al-Mabhouh in Dubai last month. Reports note that the Dubai police 
accused 15 more individuals carrying foreign passports of 
involvement in the murder. The total number of suspects is now 26. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, citing Haaretz, reports that the son of Hamas 
leader Hasan Yousef has been a "spy" for Israel for more than 10 
years and that he was behind the murder of Al-Mabhouh. Hasan Yousef 
and Hamas denied this news. 
 
The dailies quote Secretary Clinton testifying before Congress 
yesterday saying that she hopes the Palestinian-Israeli peace 
negotiations will resume soon. Al-Quds runs a separate front page 
story citing the London based Al-Hayat reporting that the 
Palestinian-Israeli indirect negotiations will begin in two weeks, 
according to Palestinian sources. The report notes that PA President 
Mahmoud Abbas initially agreed to indirect talks but needs to get 
the green light from the Arab states after the Arab Follow-Up 
Committee meeting scheduled for next Tuesday. 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Under the title "Too Many Initiatives.... Too Little Action," an 
editorial in Al-Quds argues that there is no need to look for or 
create any initiatives other than that Arab peace initiative, which 
was approved by 57 Arab and Muslim states. The Arab initiative 
should be the framework for any peace prospects in the region. The 
author criticizes the "endless" European and American efforts to 
continue drafting initiatives while no concrete actions are taken on 
the ground.
