(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points, curriculum vitae (CV) 
on U.S. candidate Pierre-Richard Prosper, and a copy of our 
diplomatic note on November 20 to Lourdes Puma, MFA Director 
General of Multilateral Affairs.  Official diplomatic note 
will be delivered via normal diplomatic channels.  Puma said 
that she was aware of Mr. Prosper's candidacy and appreciated 
his work on the Committee, but would not be able to respond 
as she understood that the deadline for candidates was in 
December.  Post will follow-up at a later date.
