¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  David Harland, chief of 
the UN Department of Peacekeeping (DPKO) Europe Office, 
passed to dpolcouns on March 26 a paper entitled "NON-PAPER: 
Elements for a Security Regime and UN Role."  The paper is a 
revised version of the nonpaper reported reftel.  This draft, 
which Harland said was being passed to Russia by SYG Ban, 
adds specificity regarding the proposed restricted access 
zones and incorporates agreements reached in Geneva (i.e., 
the "Penta-Partite Mechanism).  Harland said DPKO would 
welcome U.S. bilateral discussion of the draft with Russia 
and looks forward to our comments. He said the UN plans to go 
to press with its proposal in late April in order to meet the 
May 15 deadline of UNSCR 1866.  USUN asks Department's 
guidance on an appropriate response to the new draft.  Text 
is contained in paragraph 2.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.

The Secretary-General was requested by the Security Council

meaningful presence would have to be based on some agreement 
or shared understanding as to the security regime that will 
apply on the ground, and this would have to be concluded by 
late April.
