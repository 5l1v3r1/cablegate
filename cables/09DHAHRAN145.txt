SUBJECT: ARAMCO SKEPTICAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION 
INITIATIVE 
 
REF: DE RHEBAAA #2397 1281145 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Joseph Kenny, Consul General, EXEC, DOS. 
REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
 
¶1. KEY POINTS: 
 
-- (S/NF) Saudi Aramco's Executive Management is skeptical of 
the presence of Ministry of Interior (MOI) critical 
infrastructure protection (CIP) forces near their oil and gas 
facilities. 
 
-- (S/NF) Aramco is currently undergoing a major upgrade to 
their perimeter surveillance system, in what may be an attempt 
to mitigate MOI encroachment on Aramco facilities. 
 
-- (S/NF) Several key Aramco contacts confirm that the recent 
resignation of the head of Aramco security was unrelated to the 
CIP initiative. 
 
¶2. COMMENT: 
 
-- (S/NF) Saudi Aramco harbors deep reservations about MOI's 
growing involvement in the protection of its facilities, which 
Aramco deems unnecessary and ill-suited.  Saudi Aramco is losing 
ground in this domestic wrangling over CIP, but is directing its 
rancor at the MOI, not the USG. 
 
ARAMCO SKEPTICAL OF MOI-CIP INITIATIVE 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Aramco's Executive Management team including the CEO, 
Khalid al-Falih, is hesitant to permit MOI-CIP forces into their 
oil and gas facilities.  This fact was made abundantly clear in 
a meeting that former Ambassador Fraker, the Consul General and 
PolOff had with al-Falih several months ago.  Aside from the 
visibly uncomfortable gestures and eye contact he made with his 
Senior VP for Industrial Relations when CIP was raised, al-Falih 
noted that Aramco was very skeptical of the net benefit of 
having Saudi soldiers around highly combustible and very 
sensitive industrial facilities.  He noted that after the 
terrorist attack on Abqaiq in 2005, Saudi soldiers deployed to 
protect the infrastructure were smoking cigarettes, driving 
their vehicles perilously close to equipment, and interfering in 
the operation of the oil facilities. 
 
¶4. (S/NF) Al-Falih emphasized that Saudi Aramco is not happy 
about MOI (irrespective of USG involvement) interfering with 
their facilities and they believe that they are more than 
capable of protecting their own assets without outside help.  It 
appears that Aramco has accepted the fact that MOI will 
inevitably be encroaching on their turf and are now in the 
process of mitigating this effect as much as possible.  As 
testament to this observation, they are in the final stages of 
signing a contract for a $1 billion perimeter surveillance 
system for all of their facilities across the kingdom.  Northrop 
Grumman has been awarded the contract (close hold), though 
Aramco has not yet officially made the announcement.  In 
addition, according to our sources in Aramco Affairs, the new 
Executive Director of Safety and Industrial Security, Mohammed 
al-Zahrani, was selected because of his knowledge of operations 
and facilities, not his security credentials.  His most recent 
position was manager of the critical office of Oil Supply, 
Planning and Scheduling (OSPAS). 
 
¶5. (S/NF) According to a cable from the Department of Energy 
(ref A), Samir Raslan, General Manager for Industrial Security 
at Aramco, was forced to resign by Aramco management.  However, 
a number of post contacts at Aramco insist that Samir quit and 
was not fired or forced to resign.  In fact, before submitting 
his resignation Raslan made it clear to his subordinates and to 
post that if he did not receive a promotion to Executive 
Director of Safety and Industrial Security he would move on from 
Aramco.  When the position was given to al-Zahrani, he submitted 
his resignation.
