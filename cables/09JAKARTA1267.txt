SUBJECT: U.S. BUSINESS COMMUNITY SURPRISED BY BOMBINGS, 
COMFORTABLE WITH SECURITY SITUATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) Senior representatives of the U.S. business 
community were surprised by the recent bombings.  They view 
the bombings as an isolated event, not a signal of a 
long-term deterioration of the security situation in 
Indonesia.  They stressed the vital nature of continued U.S. 
training and cooperation with Indonesian law enforcement and 
military to counter security threats. 
 
¶2. (SBU) American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Indonesia 
officials told Embassy they strongly favored Embassy's 
security stance in the wake of the July 17 bombings of the JW 
Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton.  The group, which met with 
Embassy officials on July 28, included James Castle, of 
Castle Asia, a two-time survivor of bombings of the JW 
Marriott, AmCham Indonesia President Joe Bartlett, and five 
other senior AmCham Indonesia officials, all long-time 
residents of Indonesia.  AmCham leaders said they were 
surprised the recent attacks occurred, given real 
improvements in the government of Indonesia's capacity to 
counter terrorist threats in recent years.  They agreed with 
Castle's assessment that such threats remain a risk of daily 
life everywhere.  They view the security environment in 
Indonesia as generally good and said they had not deferred 
travel to Indonesia by family members.  They strongly 
supported moving forward with visits by U.S. government 
officials and other delegations to advance cooperation with 
Indonesia on shared interests.  Their bottom line:  all 
governments face a real challenge in preventing a small, 
committed group of extremists from carrying out attacks, but 
cooperation and assistance can reduce those threats.  They 
welcomed the DCM's confirmation that anti-terrorism training 
will continue, and strongly supported additional security 
cooperation with partners from the hotel community on 
training to improve capacity to face the threats to soft 
targets.  They also urged that training be provided to all 
authorities with security responsibilities, including 
Kopassus. 
 
¶3. (SBU) AmCham leaders told us Indonesian election results 
offered U.S. firms a unique opportunity to enter and/or to 
expand their presence in the Indonesian market.  They said 
the recent visit of Ex-Im Board member Diane Farrell to 
Jakarta was a strong signal to the business community that 
the U.S. government was ready to step up engagement with 
Indonesia.  The fact that she made the visit in the immediate 
aftermath of the July 17 attacks also signalled how the U.S. 
government stands with its partners in the face of shared 
security threats.  AmCham leaders commented that initial 
signs are positive that President Yudhoyono may be able to 
appoint a more capable Cabinet in his second administration. 
They urged the U.S. government, in partnership with the U.S. 
business community, to take advantage of current 
opportunities to encourage President Yudhoyono to remove 
legal and regulatory barriers to foreign investment during 
his next administration.
