(SBU) As Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Sayyid Badr 
al-Busaidi promised the Ambassador on April 25 (meeting 
reported septel), a Foreign Ministry statement published in 
the national media on April 26 called for unity amongst the 
international community in fighting all types of terrorism, 
and expressed the Sultanate's support of the actions "taken 
by the Egyptian government to protect its security and 
safety."  Sultan Qaboos also sent a cable to President 
Mubarak offering his sympathy to the bereaved families, and 
the Egyptian people.  Condemnation of the April 24 Dahab 
bombings was a main headline in all the local print media. 
The government-owned Arabic daily "Oman" editorial on April 
26 stated that "these kinds of criminal acts contradict all 
religious, political and legal norms."
