SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) As political negotiations continue, much government 
activity has come to a standstill.  Not surprisingly, given 
the depth and breadth of Zimbabwe's serious economic, food, 
employment, and political problems, anti-trafficking efforts 
by the government have taken a back seat to other issues. 
IOM remains active and successfully implements programs with 
the government's approval and involvement, but the push to 
deter trafficking remains with the non-governmental 
organizations.  Until a new government takes shape, 
anti-trafficking efforts and legislation, like other pressing 
issues, will continue to be ignored.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
No New Legislation, Prosecutions 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) So far in 2008, parliament has been largely 
ineffective.  Parliament only sat for a few sessions at the 
beginning of the year, and then dealt primarily with 
election-related legislation leading up to the March 29 
harmonized elections.  The victorious parliamentarians were 
not sworn in until September, and then parliament did not 
convene to conduct business until mid-October.  Consequently, 
it has made no progress in 2008 in drafting or implementing 
anti-trafficking legislations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The GOZ has made no progress to date in combating 
trafficking in persons.  There have been no new arrests, 
investigations, or prosecutions of traffickers since April 
¶2008.

IOM leads Anti-Trafficking Efforts 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The International Organization for Migration (IOM) 
continues to sponsor the successful "Stop the Traffic" 
campaign that includes radio, TV, and billboard 
advertisements warning against trafficking.  IOM, together 
with the Zimbabwean NGO Oasis Zimbabwe, was due to launch an 
anti-trafficking toll-free hotline on October 31. 
Unfortunately, the ceremony was canceled at the government's 
request because no official was available to attend.  The 
ceremony was re-scheduled for December 6.  The hotline has 
begun to operate, but it has not yet been fully advertised. 
IOM has provided training in different areas for officials 
from four different sectors: law enforcement officials (4 
workshops), social service providers (3 workshops), 
faith-based organizations (3 workshops), and health/hygiene 
provision (3 workshops).  IOM also has two reception centers 
for Zimbabweans returning from South Africa (at Beitbridge) 
and Botswana (at Plumtree) where it sponsors dramas that warn 
against trafficking. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) IOM continues to provide direct assistance to 
victims of trafficking.  To date this year, it has assisted 
23 victims, mostly women and children, who have been 
subjected to sexual exploitation and/or forced labor.  IOM 
reports that it receives many requests from Zimbabweans 
asking for verification of job offers received from overseas. 
 IOM hopes the new hotline will provide a streamlined way to 
assist these potential trafficking victims.
