¶1. Poloff delivered ref A and B demarches to Foreign Ministry 
Legal Advisor Bishar Khassawneh regarding the upcoming 
International Labor Conference in Geneva. Khassawneh noted 
that Jordan shares U.S. concerns over International Labor 
Organization (ILO) budgetary increases. Poloff urged that the 
Jordanian delegation at the conference support U.S. efforts 
to further cut the proposed increases. 
 
¶2. Poloff also asked for Jordan's support of Barbados's 
candidacy to the ILO Governing Body, over that of Cuba. 
Talking points, in the form of non-papers, were left for both 
issues. Khassawneh promised to pass these to other concerned 
parties in the Foreign Ministry, and to the Ministry of Labor 
(whose leadership is currently out of the country) and to 
advise the USG once Jordan's position is decided.
