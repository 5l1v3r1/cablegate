SUBJECT: IRISH AMBASSADOR BRIEFS CDA ON NGO KIDNAPPING 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert E. Whitehead, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Gerard Corr, Ireland's Ambassador to Cairo, met with 
CDA Whitehead on July 8 to discuss the kidnapping of two 
female staff of the Irish NGO GOAL that occurred on July 3 in 
Kutum. Corr is in Khartoum accompanied by a military officer, 
as well as a small police and military team currently in 
Darfur liaising with GOS security officials there in attempt 
to obtain the release of the Irish and Kenyan nationals. Corr 
told CDA that the incident has aroused intense public and 
media interest in Ireland, as it has in Kenya, and that he 
has been collaborating closely with Kenyan Ambassador Ngesu 
in Khartoum. Sudanese security forces have confirmed to them 
that the two kidnapped humanitarians are being held near 
Kutum, though the identity of their captors remains unknown. 
 
¶2. (C) Corr said that the group holding the two women had 
made no demands, and that the Irish government is unwilling 
to pay a ransom for their release. He cited a similar case 
where a humanitarian aid worker had been released after three 
weeks of captivity and said that he hoped for a similar 
outcome this time. UN officials have told him that they doubt 
any of the rebel groups present in the area would take such 
actions -- they have no motive to do so, nor much freedom of 
movement in Kutum -- and that the GOS would probably seek a 
speedy resolution of the case if elements loyal to it were 
involved. The seizure of the hostages appeared too well 
organized to be the work of armed bandits, Corr said. 
 
¶3. (C) Corr and the Kenyan Ambassador have requested meetings 
with MFA Undersecretary Mutriff Siddiq, NISS Director General 
Salah Ghosh, Minister of Justice Abdelbasit Sabdarat, and HAC 
Director Hassabo Mohemed Abdulrahman for June 9. He observed 
that the latter's description of the capture of the two women 
differed notably from other sources. State officials in 
Darfur had been more positive in their conversations with the 
Irish team there than have Corr's interlocutors in Khartoum, 
who appeared unsure about where things stand. Corr said that 
the Sudanese Ambassador to Ireland, resident in London, had 
traveled to Dublin to meet with the Irish Foreign Minister 
and the family of the kidnapped Irish national, but that his 
meeting with the Foreign Minister focused largely on 
Ireland's public support for the ICC indictment of President 
Bashir. However, the Sudanese Ambassador had in no way linked 
this to resolution of the kidnapping case. 
 
¶4. (C) Corr requested that the US. Embassy Khartoum pass on 
any information it might pick up from its network of contacts 
in Darfur and the humanitarian community. CDA replied that 
the Embassy has been following the case closely, and assured 
Corr that the Embassy stands ready to assist him and his team 
with information sharing and in other ways, as possible, to 
help resolve the case.
