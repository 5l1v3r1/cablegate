level of representation.  He inquired about the composition

Director o the Office of the Assistant Under Secretary for 
International Cooperation at the MFA, told Acting EconChief

in order to respond to MFA queries in paras 2 and 3 regarding 
level of USG representation and sponsoring organizations
