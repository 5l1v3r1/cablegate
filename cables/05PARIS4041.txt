SUBJECT: UN DEMOCRACY FUND: FRENCH RESPONSE ON PROPOSED 
LETTER TO UNSYG 
 
REF: STATE 99849 
 
¶1. Poloff raised with MFA IO contacts May 31 the proposed 
letter from permanent representatives to UNSYG Annan 
requesting him to set up the UN Democracy Fund. 
DAS-equivalent for human rights and humanitarian affairs 
Beatrice le Fraper du Hellen responded June 7 that while 
France was very supportive of the Fund, and may be willing to 
contribute to it, the GoF was not in agreement with the 
structure proposed by the UN Secretariat. 
 
¶2. Fraper said that the GoF could not sign the letter as 
currently drafted as the links between the Fund and existing 
agencies and with the High Commissioner for Human Rights were 
too tenuous.
