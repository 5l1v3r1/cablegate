In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan-Buyukanit Clash over Iraq 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni Safak 
and others report the Turkish General Staff (TGS) said in a 
statement yesterday the views expressed by Chief of General Staff 
Yasar Buyukanit in a press conference in Washington last month were 
"not personal," but rather "the institutional views of the Turkish 
armed forces," contradicting comments by Prime Minister Erdogan. 
Erdogan has said on Thursday that the remarks were the "personal" 
s TalaQrriyet, Milliyet, Radi`ni Safak and 
others `gan phoned the Iraqi President 
Talabani to wish him a speedy recovery after he was taken to a 
hospital in Jordan.  Sources quoted Talabani as telling Erdogan that 
he believed that problems would be resolved by joint efforts of 
Turkey and Iraq. 
Erdogan also called the Iranian President Ahmadinejad to discuss 
current political developments in the region.  Papers comment the 
Iraqi and Iranian leaders' support was important for Turkey on the 
eve of a possible gathering of Iraq's foreign ministers in Istanbul 
in April.  Meanwhile, sources told Cumhuriyet and Zaman special Iraq 
envoy Oguz Celikkol will represent Turkey at the March 10 meeting to 
be held in Baghdad at ambassadorial level. 
 
Former President Evren Suggests Division of Turkey into States 
All papers report most Turkish politicians reacted negatively to 
comments by former president Kenan Evren, who led the 1980 military 
coup, that Turkey should be divided into semi-autonomous provinces, 
saying such a plan would endanger the country's unity and security. 
Turkey should adopt the "state system," Evren announced earlier this 
week, saying that it is possible to divide the country into eight 
states, namely Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Adana, Erzurum, Diyarbakir, 
Eskisehir, and Trabzon.  Cumhuriyet says on page one Evren speaks 
like "a US spokesman," reporting Ali Topuz, a senior figure in the 
main opposition CHP administration, said Evren has done everything 
the US has asked for, "including a military takeover."  Deputy Prime 
Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said "loosening the unitary structure in 
Turkey will not bring any good." 
 
Editorial Commentary: Iraqi Oil; PKK in the Political Process 
Fatih Altayli, comments on Iraq's oil law in the mainstream Sabah: 
"According to this draft law, an independent expert commission will 
be able to audit the agreements the Kurdish administration signs; 
however, the final decision will be made by the Kurdish 
urkey's main Kurdish party] deputy chair 
Aysel Tugluk stressed that the 'PKK should be given the chance to 
participate in politics under the condition that it does not 
interfere with the unitary state structure.'  A significant number 
of Kurdish politicians cannot make a political decision without 
getting jailed PKK leader Ocalan's approval.  Indeed, they cannot 
even announce the possibility that they might run as independent 
candidates until Ocalan reportedly gives such an instruction.  This 
proves that the PKK already is involved in legal and democratic 
politics."

Papers: US 'Corrects' Rice's 'Kurdistan Gaffe' 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni Safak and 
others report State spokesman Sean McCormack said in response to a 
press question, the word "Kurdistan" used by Secretary Rice was 
"reference to a geographical area."  On Tuesday, Rice had described 
the PKK during testimony at the Senate Appropriations Committee as a 
terrorist group operating "on the border between Turkey and 
Kurdistan," drawing reactions in Turkey.  McCormack said "the border 
is between Turkey and Iraq."  Opposition CHP lawmaker Ali Topuz told 
a press conference yesterday that Secretary Rice has revealed "her 
true intentions":  "The US Greater Middle East project has been 
given a kick-off.  A Kurdish state is to be formed in northern Iraq 
as a prelude to an independent Kurdistan on land from Turkey, Iraq, 
Syria, and Iran." 
 
Ankara Reacts to Cyprus-France Agreement 
Milliyet and Zaman report according to a deal signed Monday between 
France and Greek Cyprus, France will be able to use air and naval 
bases in south Cyprus and will execute joint military exercises with 
the Greek Cypriots.  Frenchwould jeopardize stability and 
security in the eastern Mediterranean, disrupting efforts for a 
comprehensive resolution under the UN.
