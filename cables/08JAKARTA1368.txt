     ¶B. JAKARTA 1319 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In a discussion with GOI contact, 
DepPol/C reviewed the U.S. proposal to incorporate the 
proposed statement on regional disaster relief into the 
Chair's statement at the upcoming ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) 
meeting in Singapore.  Our Department of Foreign Affairs 
contact indicated that the GOI could support the proposal in 
principal.  Our contact, however, related that Indonesia 
still wants to discuss the proposal with ASEAN colleagues 
before agreeing on a final text.  We left the USG non-paper 
for further GOI review.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The GOI seems interested in the USG proposal re 
ASEAN and regional disaster preparedness.  On July 16, 
DepPol/C reviewed reftel proposal with Ibnu Hadi, Director 
for Intra-Regional Cooperation for Asia-Pacific and Africa in 
the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU). 
DepPol/C noted Indonesia's previous support for the creation 
of regional disaster relief mechanisms within the ASEAN 
Framework. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Continuing, DepPol/C related that there was only a 
short time remaining before the ASEAN Ministerial Conference 
slated to begin on July 24.  Washington urged Indonesia to 
support the U.S. proposal to incorporate the proposed 
statement into the ARF Chairman's statement.  The USG 
proposal was constructive and was focused on improving 
disaster response in the region, a key humanitarian 
assistance objective. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Hadi replied that Indonesia agreed with the 
substance of the proposal and the idea of incorporating the 
statement into the ARF Chairman's statement.  That said, 
Indonesia wanted to consult with the Singapore chair and 
other ASEAN counterparts to ensure that the elements of the 
proposed statement were "balanced and in proportion" before 
finalizing the text.  Indonesia hoped to do this during the 
next week and, if necessary, in the first hours of the ASEAN 
conference.  Hadi expressed confidence that this could be 
accomplished in time. 
 
¶6.  (U) DepPol/C urged that GOI do a careful scrub of the 
proposal, but to move quickly to signal its acceptance of the 
proposal or suggest areas where it could be improved. 
DepPol/C left a copy of the non-paper with Hadi for DEPLU 
review.
