Â¶1.  DCM contacted MFA Chief of Protocol Alaudeen Al-Askari to 
relay that a message from Secretary Clinton was being sent to 
the MFA. (Note: MFA is closed for the Hajj/Eid holiday. End 
Note.) Al-Askari called back to confirm that the message was 
being passed to Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal (currently in 
the U.S.). He indicated the answer may take some time to be 
worked through proper channels, possibly not until after the 
Eid.
