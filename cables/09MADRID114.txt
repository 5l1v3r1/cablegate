Terrorism Office Director Pablo Nuno, the Spanish

forwarded the documents to the Vice Presidency in December.

the MFA in January.  The MFA's Executive 
Secretariat-equivalent is coordinating the final approvals. 
It is expected that instructions to convey the instruments of 
ratification to the Department will be transmitted to 
Ambassador Dezcallar at the Spanish Embassy in February.
