MFA "Noticed" Reports of DPRK Moving Funds 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  At the May 17 regular press briefing, MFA Spokeswoman 
Jiang Yu stated that the MFA has taken note of reports from 
the DPRK Foreign Ministry that BDA funds are being moved. 
Jiang reiterated China's hope for a resolution to the issue 
at an early date so that all parties can press ahead with 
implementation of the initial actions agreed upon in the last 
round of the Six-Party Talks. 
 
Financial Assistance to Africa 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  Chinese financial assistance to Africa is supported by 
the eight-point proposal for China-Africa cooperation put 
forth by China during last November's Beijing summit with 
leaders from over 40 African nations and is meant to 
encourage and strengthen development efforts, said the 
spokeswoman when asked about China's benchmarks for aid to 
Africa and how China justifies receiving outside aid itself 
in light of giving billions in aid to Africa.  Jiang repeated 
claims that such assistance has "no political strings 
attached."  When pressed by reporters for the relation of 
such claims to the five African nations currently recognizing 
Taiwan, Jiang said China is ready to work with these five 
countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Co-existence.  She also expressed hope for international 
assistance in the region particularly in the areas of debt 
relief and transfer of technology. 
 
¶4.  Asked for comment on media reports of United States plans 
to open a military command in Africa, Jiang said only that 
the MFA had taken note of the reports. 
 
MFA Cautions before Dalai Lama Trip to Australia 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5.  Asked for China's reaction to news that both Australian 
Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd 
were considering the possibility of holding meetings with the 
Dalai Lama during his scheduled 10-day trip to Australia in 
June, Jiang said the Dalai Lama's words and deeds prove he is 
not simply a religious figure, but rather a political exile 
long engaged in "splittist" activities advocating Tibetan 
independence.  Jiang cautioned relevant countries to stay 
alert to his attempts to undermine China's international 
relations and to split the Motherland.  Responding to a 
question regarding the planned May 2008 "Tibetan Olympics" to 
be held in Dharamsala, India, Jiang said that Tibet has been 
part of China since ancient times and that the Chinese people 
and government oppose the politicization of the Olympic Games. 
 
China Seeks Further Involvement in OECD 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  China has applied for observer status in various 
committees of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and 
 
BEIJING 00003321  002 OF 002 
 
 
Development (OECD) and wants to further strengthen 
cooperation with the organization, said Jiang.  She remarked 
that China has cooperated with the OECD in various fields 
since 1995 and has already participated as an observer on two 
OECD committees. 
 
Japanese Envoy for Abductions Issue in Beijing 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7.  The spokeswoman confirmed that Special Advisor to the 
Cabinet for the issue of abducted Japanese nationals, Kyoko 
Nakayama, is currently in Beijing at the invitation of the 
Japanese Embassy.  She met with VFM Wu Dawei and exchanged 
views on China-Japan relations and the ongoing nuclear 
situation on the Korean Peninsula.  She is also scheduled to 
meet with EVFM Dai Bingguo. 
 
Unrest in Pakistan 
------------------ 
 
¶8.  As a friendly neighbor to Pakistan, China is paying close 
attention to unrest in Karachi and hopes that the government 
can maintain peace and social stability there, said the 
spokeswoman when asked for comment on the situation. 
 
Chinese Sailors Kidnapped Off Coast of Somalia 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶9.  Responding to reports that as many as ten Chinese sailors 
have been taken hostage aboard two South Korean fishing 
vessels off the coast of Somalia, Jiang stated that the 
Chinese government attaches great importance to the situation 
and that the MFA is following events closely and cooperating 
with relevant governments on rescue efforts. 
 
South Korea to Join Search for Missing Sailors 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶10.  Asked about the ongoing search-and-rescue operations for 
16 sailors missing in the Bohai Sea since their boat sank on 
May 12, Jiang stated that after the incident was reported 
China's search and rescue center has made great efforts, 
coordinating with officials in Shandong Province and the ROK 
Embassy in Beijing.  China has also approved the request to 
have search and rescue teams from South Korea join in the 
search.  Jiang said that the cause of the incident was still 
being investigated and that the South Korean government and 
relatives of the missing sailors have thanked China for its 
efforts. 
 
Chirac an "Old Friend" of China 
------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  President Chirac is an "old friend" of China who 
supported the one-China principle as well as China's peaceful 
reunification with Taiwan and the Chinese Government and 
people applaud his contributions to the Sino-French 
relationship, commented the spokeswoman when asked for 
reflections on Chirac's presidency. 
 
Visits: Germany, Croatia, UK 
---------------------------- 
 
¶12.  German President Horst Koehler will visit May 23-26 at 
the invitation of President Hu Jintao as will Croatian FM and 
Minister of European Integration Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic May 
20-23 at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yang 
Jiechi.  During UK Foreign Secretary Beckett's May 16-21 
visit, she will meet with FM Yang and other leaders to 
exchange views on cooperation between the two countries and 
their respective foreign ministries, said Jiang.  The 
spokeswoman deflected a reporter's question on whether or not 
Iran would be a topic of discussion during the visit.
