¶1.  (U)  This is an action request -- see para 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On November 7, Deputy Pol/C conveyed reftel 
demarche points to James Gilmour, regional policy officer of 
the Afghan Task Force at the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade (DFAIT).  Gilmour promised to canvas 
colleagues and provide an early response.  He requested the 
most up-to-date information on U.S. policy toward Iran so 
that DFAIT can better craft "creative solutions" to the 
Afghan refugee situation without crossing U.S. "redlines." 
Deputy Pol/C noted the December 8 U.S.-EU-Canada trilateral 
meeting on Iran in Ottawa would be an excellent opportunity 
for Afghan Task Force members to sit down with State's Iran 
experts. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Action request:  Please advise if such a briefing 
is possible on December 8, and/or provide the requested 
information on Iran to share with DFAIT.
