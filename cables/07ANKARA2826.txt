In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan-AKP MPs Gathering Discusses Terror, Northern Iraq 
All papers report that Prime Minister Erdogan, during this weekend's 
AKP meeting in Kizilcahamam, stated that the fight against terrorism 
will be successful only when complemented by efforts to broaden 
democracy.  Erdogan called on the opposition to support the 
government's plan to resolve the PKK problem through "greater 
democracy."  Erdogan expressed his opposition to the closure of the 
pro-Kurdish DTP and criticized the opposition for pressuring the 
government toward a cross-border operation into northern Iraq. 
According to Erdogan, the government has a year-long mandate and the 
decision will be made in consultation with the military. 
 
At the same meeting, Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said that the 
Kurdish administration in northern Iraq is now working with Turkey 
to fight against the PKK.  Babacan underscored that 
intelligence-sharing between Turkey and the US "continues 
successfully," adding that a cross-border incursion will be 
initiated only when security forces deem it necessary.  Deputy Prime 
Minister Cemil Cicek signaled the government would soon announce 
economic measures to help develop Turkey's impoverished southeast 
region. 
 
General Craddock Meets General Buyukanit in Ankara 
Over the weekend, all papers reported that General Bantz Craddock, 
the commander of the US forces in Europe, came to Ankara on Saturday 
for talks with the chief of the Turkish General Staff (TGS), General 
Yasar Buyukanit.  Reportedly, the generals debated Turkish-US 
cooperation against the PKK, including enhanced intelligence 
sharing.  The TGS, on its website, said the meeting concerned "the 
issue of cooperation including intelligence sharing between Turkey 
and the United States in the common struggle against the PKK 
terrorist organization."  The statement noted the meeting was held 
within the context of the Bush-Erdogan decision in a White House 
meeting earlier this month. 
 
Papers: Turkey Convinces Syria, Saudi Arabia to Join Annapolis Talks 
 
All papers report that Foreign Minister Ali Babacan told reporters 
Sunday that he "welcomed the decisions of Saudi Arabia and Syria to 
participate in the Annapolis Conference."  Islamist oriented Zaman 
says that Turkey convinced Syria and Saudi Arabia to join the talks. 
 Iran is the only nation from the region not participating in the 
conference.  Although Hamas was democratically elected, they were 
not invited to the gathering.  The leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
and several mainstream papers do not feel these long-held 
disagreements can be overcome during one conference. 
 
 
 
 
Editorial Commentary on Annapolis Conference 
Huseyin Bas observed in the leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet (11/26): 
"For forty years, no initiatives to resolve the dispute between 
Israel and Palestine have been successful.  There is not much hope 
for the Annapolis conference to bring peaceful results to the 
region.  Recently, Israeli leader Olmert illustrated that Israel, 
supported by the US, is not planning to eradicate all obstacles on 
the path of the peace.  Peace in the Middle East depends largely on 
the US.  It is hard to see Bush the Warrior as a peacemaker. 
Besides, it doesn't seem possible for one occupier to force another 
occupier toward peace.  The only hope is for the parties to agree on 
the establishment of a Palestinian State. 
 
Ferai Tinc commented in the mainstream Hurriyet (11/26):  "The only 
result expected from Annapolis is a jumpstart to the Middle East 
peace initiative.  However, last Saturday, high level leaders of 
Hamas and Hezbollah met in Tehran in a counter-Annapolis meeting. 
At this meeting, Hamas representative Musa Abu Mazruk argued "the 
 
ANKARA 00002826  002 OF 002 
 
 
Annapolis Conference is arranged to eliminate the Palestine issue. 
It is not going to be successful.  The real aim of the conference is 
to pull so-called moderate Arab countries to the Israeli side." 
Hezbollah's foreign relations Representative Seyh Ali Dagmus said 
"Israel is trying to normalize its relations with the Arab 
countries."  Today, Hamas is arranging an alternative meeting in 
Gazza to discuss how to deal with the outcome of the Annapolis 
meeting."  Already, the following message is on Hamas' website: "in 
the process following the Annapolis Conference, it will be witnessed 
that the insurgency will increase in the West Bank and Gaza."  If 
nothing concrete comes out of Annapolis, the ones left out of the 
conference will benefit. 
 
Diyarbakir Rally Protests DTP Closure Case, Praises Ocalan 
All papers report 48 people were detained in the mainly Kurdish 
southeastern city of Diyarbakir.  The arrests follow a clash with 
riot police during a rally held by the pro-Kurdish DTP on Sunday. 
About 5,000 demonstrators shouted slogans in support of the DTP and 
Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the PKK. DTP 
parliamentarian Selahattin Demirtas said "at this rally, we say 
'enough is enough'- enough of denying the Kurds, enough of trying to 
solve problems through military operations."  On Friday, Turkey's 
Constitutional Court agreed to examine a call from state prosecutors 
to shut down the DTP. 
 
Papers: PKK Leaders possibly detained 
All papers over the weekend report rumors that Iraqi Kurdish leader 
Barzani accompanied Murat Karayilan and Cemil Bayik, two PKK leaders 
rumored to be apprehended, to a NATO base in Italy.  Deputy Prime 
Minister Cemil Cicek said that a handing over of some PKK leaders to 
Turkey "would not be a surprise."
