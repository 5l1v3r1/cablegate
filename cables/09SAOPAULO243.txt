""Torture in Bush's government" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (4-27) states:"....The 
U.S.... is discussing whether , how and how far it should 
investigate the systematic tortures against terrorism suspects 
practiced by the CIA....what is at stake goes beyond 
torture....under Bush's auspices and invoking the imperative of 
national security, his close circle....tried to transform the U.S. 
into a police State. Its dictatorial trends were exacerbated, but 
not created by September 11th.....They were close to bringing the 
country to its demise."
