¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
------------------------------------ 
 
"Hamas and the West Favorite Game " 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
Dr. Eid Abu Sekke, a columnist in government-owned Al-Ba'th, 
commented (2/22): "We have reached a time when birds are accused 
of harassing crows and eagles, and butterflies of spreading 
terrorism in the woods and over the prairies! A month after the 
success of Hamas in the Palestinian elections and days after the 
naming of a candidate to head the cabinet, Tel Aviv and all its 
allies in the "civilized democratic" West and in the romantic 
East still can't believe the outcome and feel that it is a 
nightmare from which they will awaken. 
 
"Officials in Tel Aviv and Washington and their chorus know well 
that the peace process has been at a complete standstill, thanks 
to them, for over five years. 
 
"The most important democratic achievement is change of power 
through the ballot box, allowing people to choose those whose 
programs and ideas match their ambitions and aspirations for the 
future. 
 
"Therefore, the people of the West, especially in Washington, 
should continue to believe this, even if it embarrasses those 
who classify organizations, parties and states according to 
their whim...and those who ask Hamas to turn its back on the 
slogans and objectives which played a major role in bringing it 
to power. Those who elected Hamas...did so because, out of 
excessive exasperation and abundant hope, they want the choice 
of resistance to go hand in hand with political action. Also, 
the recent Palestinian vote was as much for economic as 
political development, as everyone was aware of the bureaucracy 
of corruption within the Palestinian Authority. 
"Finally, isn't democracy which is manifested in a peaceful 
change of power the West's favorite game?, Why don't they like 
it when we play this game on our own turf?" 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
"This is the Arab State of Affairs" 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
Ezzedin al-Darwish, an editorialist in government-owned 
Tishreen, wrote (2/23): "In Palestine, they are not content with 
occupation and killing of Arab citizens, and the support these 
killings get, especially from the U.S. They now want Palestinian 
legislative and executive authorities to turn a blind eye to 
Israeli occupation and aggressive policies, otherwise it will be 
a `terrorist' authority that should be fought militarily, 
financially and politically. What Condoleeza Rice is trying to 
market in the region is absolute proof of this."
