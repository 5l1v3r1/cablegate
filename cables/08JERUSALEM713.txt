All the Palestinian dailies carried prominent and extensive coverage 
of President Abbas's meetings in Washington on their front pages. 
In a front-page article appearing under a large photo of Abbas 
meeting with Secretary Rice, Abbas was quoted as saying "the gap 
between the Palestinian and the Israeli stands is still wide. We 
demand that the American administration take a firm stand to make 
2008 a year of peace." The dailies highlighted that Abbas will be 
meeting with President Bush today, April 24, and Al-Ayyam also 
reported that according to Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, 
Secretary Rice will visit the region at the beginning of next month. 
 
SIPDIS 
Related reports on the front pages of all the dailies focused on 
discussions between the King of Jordan and President Bush regarding 
the peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. 
 
Comments made by deposed Hamas PM Isma'il Haniyeh on April 23 
received front page coverage in all dailies, where he was reported 
as saying that Hamas will only agree to a ceasefire with Israel if 
it is bilateral, adding that "the ball is in Israel's court." In 
contrast, related coverage on the front page of Al-Quds quoted 
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki as saying "a ceasefire in 
Gaza will be declared very soon. We are very close to calling a 
truce that will end the rocket fire on Israel, the Israeli strikes 
and the Gaza siege."  Al-Quds also reported on Egyptian negotiations 
with Israel about resuming fuel deliveries for the Gaza Strip's 
power plant and quoted an Egyptian official as saying "we succeeded 
in convincing Israel to resume supplying gasoline to the power plant 
[note: which Israel has done], after reports said the plant would be 
shut down due to lack of fuel." The dailies reported that the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) halted its food distribution 
program in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, and would not resume the 
program until Israel supplied fuel to the Gaza Strip. 
 
The dailies continue to carry reports on the visit of former US 
President Carter. The front page of Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reported that 
"Carter accused Rice of lying, denying that the State Department had 
asked him to refrain from meeting with Hamas." Al-Quds reported that 
Carter's office issued a press release summarizing his tour in the 
Middle East. 
 
On the Syrian peace path, the leading story in Al-Quds reported that 
Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan informed Damascus that the Israeli 
Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, agreed to withdraw from the occupied 
Golan Heights in return for peace with Syria. This claim reportedly 
caused uproar among several members of the Israeli Knesset. 
 
Inside pages of Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam carried coverage about the 
visit of Public Affairs Officer Micaela Schweitzer-Bluhm to Miftah, 
the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and 
Democracy. Al-Ayyam carried a photo of the meeting and reported that 
Ms. Schweitzer-Bluhm gave a very useful and comprehensive lecture on 
the "race to the White House".  Related coverage on the front page 
of Al-Quds reported on the ongoing elections campaign in the US. 
 
Wafa News Agency carried a very positive and lengthy article on the 
briefing conducted by Howard Sumka, director of USAID for the West 
bank and Gaza, with the local press in Ramallah on April 23. The 
report included coverage of projects implemented by USAID in the 
Palestinian Territories.

¶1. Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by regular columnist Talal 
Okal entitled "There is only one way out" (4/24): "The outcome of 
the visit of former US president [Carter] does not deserve the media 
uproar that it created regarding its possible effects and 
consequences ... Carter asked Hamas to recognize Israel, denounce 
violence and terrorism, and show commitment to all treaties signed 
by the Palestinian Liberation Organization. He also asked Hamas to 
initiate a truce and to accept Israel's conditions regarding the 
release of Israeli soldier Shalit.  Hamas' announcement that it will 
accept the outcome of a Palestinian public referendum on any 
agreement reached through negotiations between the Palestinian 
Authority (PA) and Israel was conditioned on first achieving 
internal Palestinian reconciliation, which we all know will be hard 
to achieve. In the midst of all this, the big question in the minds 
of the Palestinian people regards the future of the situation, 
especially if Hamas continues to oppose the PA, since this can head 
towards an explosion that no one will be able to predict the limits 
of..." 
 
¶2. Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by regular columnist, Dr. 
Abd Al-Majeed Swailm entitled "The visit of President Abu Mazen to 
Washington" (4/24): "It had been said that the visit of our 
president to the United States came after an American request, and 
is not part of the regular pilgrimage that the leaders of this 
region make to Washington whenever it is close to the time of any US 
president to leave the White House. It also been said that President 
Bush wants to hear directly from President Abbas on what had been 
achieved in ongoing negotiations with the Israel, so that Bush can 
have an achievement or breakthrough to talk about and present to the 
Republican Party ... in short, the United States wants to sell us 
words, promises, dreams, wishes, and imaginations for a new vision 
or an old vision which might be implemented or postponed..."
