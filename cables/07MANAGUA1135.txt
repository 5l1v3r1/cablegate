Â¶1.  On April 24, post faxed reftel points in English to the 
Foreign Ministry's Director of Multilateral Affairs, Magda 
Enriquez, who speaks and reads English.  On April 26, post's 
Spanish translation was sent to the MFA.  The Ambassador met 
with Foreign Minister Samuel Santos on May 2, the earliest 
available opportunity, to discuss the points.  Santos 
clarified that the Nicaraguan government (GON) supports the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy and recognizes the need for an 
international nuclear regulatory body, like the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to ensure that nuclear 
activities serve only peaceful purposes.
