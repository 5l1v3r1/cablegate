SUBJECT: DRAFT AGENDAS AND MISSION CLEARANCE REQUESTS FOR 
U.S.-UN HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGIC DIALOGUE ON IRAQ 
 
REF: USUN 578 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraphs 4 
and 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Background: The next session of the U.S.-UN 
High-Level Strategic Dialogue on Iraq will be held on July 11 
at UN headquarters in New York (Ref A).  The Dialogue will be 
divided into a political discussion, chaired by U/SYG for 
Political Affairs Lynn Pascoe, and a security discussion, 
chaired by acting U/SYG for Safety and Security Sir David 
Veness.  Additional UN participants in the Strategic Dialogue 
will include UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) Special 
Representative to the Secretary-General (SRSG) Staffan de 
Mistura, as well as senior Department of Political Affairs 
and Department of Safety and Security officials.  S/I David 
Satterfield will serve as the primary U.S. briefer for the 
political discussion, with NEA DAS Richard Schmierer also in 
attendance.  Ambassador Khalilzad may also participate.  COL 
Kenneth Dahl of JCS, DASD Dr. Colleen Getz of OSD, and MG 
Barbero of MNF-I will serve as the primary U.S. briefers for 
the security discussion.  S/I Satterfield, SRSG de Mistura, 
and MG Barbero will participate via Secure Video 
Teleconference (SVTC) from Iraq. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Objectives: This session of the High-Level Dialogue 
should serve four primary objectives.  First, it should help 
the U.S. and UN coordinate efforts on a range of ongoing 
political, security, and economic assistance issues in which 
they are both involved.  Second, it should ensure that the 
close cooperation between the U.S. and UNAMI in Baghdad is 
mirrored in New York.  Third, it should reassure the UN that 
the U.S. is fully committed to working with it to ensure that 
its security needs will continue to be addressed.  Fourth, it 
should send a message of strong U.S. support for the work of 
UNAMI personnel, in particular SRSG de Mistura, and the 
tangible improvements that UNAMI is achieving on the ground 
in Iraq.
