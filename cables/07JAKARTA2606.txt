Director of the North American Office at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU), to convey U.S. priorities regarding 
the Community of Democracies (CD).  Pol/C reviewed points in 
reftel re the October 1 Mali-hosted meeting on the margins of 
UNGA and urged Indonesian participation in that meeting.  The 
USG also urged the GOI to participate actively in the various 
CD working groups and announce a contribution to the UN 
Democracy Fund (UNDEF).  Support for Mali's efforts was 
integral, and states should if possible approach Mali and 
offer political and logistical support in preparation for the 
Bamako Ministerial. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Purwanto indicated that the GOI had received an 
invitation from the government of Mali to attend the November 
Ministerial in Bamako.  The Indonesian government understood 
the importance of the upcoming meeting in New York and would 
try to ensure high-level representation.
