August 4, 2004 
 
Mr. William E. Todd 
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Bureau of Narcotics and International Law Enforcement Affairs 
United States Department of State 
 
Dear Mr. Todd, 
 
It gives me great pleasure to inform you that on August 4, 
2004 negotiations between representatives of the Jordanian 
Public Security Directorate (PSD) and the U.S. State 
Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement (INL) concluded with agreement in principle on 
the terms of a letter of agreement (LOA) setting forth our 
mutual interests in the continuation of the Iraqi Police 
Training Center in Jordan.  It was further agreed in 
principle that the face sheet would set forth an agreed 
annual price of USD 34 million covering the base services, 
security, and administration required to operate the JIPTC in 
Jordan, and that the LOA, the face sheet, and the statements 
of work would constitute the full agreement between the 
parties.  It was also agreed that costs for utilities and 
fuel would be reimbursed separately by the United States 
(INL), with compensation of 15% to the PSD for administration. 
 
These terms are acceptable to the PSD, and therefore once the 
document has been translated into Arabic, I intend to forward 
the agreement to the Government recommending approval and 
requesting authority to sign the LOA on behalf of Jordan. 
 
It was also agreed during the discussions that all 
outstanding issues in connection to the previous invoices to 
be solved and settled soon. 
 
The efforts of our negotiators is highly appreciated.  Many 
thanks to you and your negotiating team, and look forward to 
seeing you again in Jordan soon. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
General 
Director of Public Security 
Tahseen H. Shurdom
