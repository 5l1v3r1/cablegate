------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) In an apparent instance of media harassment, a Somali 
journalist was arrested in Baidoa on October 4, apparently for 
reporting on two recent events in Baidoa.  He was held for 
approximately twenty-four hours in reportedly dismal conditions and 
has since been released on bail, but was instructed to remain in 
Baidoa until police conclude their investigation.  Post has inquired 
with the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) about this incident. 
End summary.

Another Incident of Media Harassment 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ali Ilyas Abdullahi, a reporter for Radio Horseed in 
Somalia, was arrested on October 4 for allegedly "critical" 
reporting on two recent security incidents.  Sources state that the 
arrest was in response to Abdullahi's plan to report on either or 
both the murder of the district police chief on the morning of 
October 4 or the attack on the residence of the TFG Speaker of 
Parliament, Sheikh Adan Muhammad Adan (aka Madobe), on the same 
evening.  Media reports claim Madobe, shortly after the attack on 
his house, publicly accused local media of siding with the 
opposition "by favoring their violent acts."  Another source 
indicates the police claim the journalist called the murdered police 
officer the night before the officer's death, which raised 
suspicions.  Abdullahi claims the officer was a relative with whom 
Abdullahi often spoke. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A Somali media organization claims this incident 
illustrates the provincial administration's efforts to quash freedom 
of the press, even to the extent of threatening journalists.  The 
organization states that the TFG, particularly the officials in 
Baidoa where political tension is high, have little tolerance for 
what the officials consider critical reporting.

Post Actions

¶4. (SBU) Post has inquired from multiple sources about this arrest. 
We are attempting to contact the reporter to let him know of our 
interest in his case.  In addition, we have contacted the TFG's 
Minister of Information to register our concern.  The Minister, who 
is also Deputy Prime Minister and is usually occupied with tasks 
apart from media, has not replied.  However, in previous cases he 
has acknowledged our interest several days after the initial 
inquiry.
