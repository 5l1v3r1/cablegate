¶2.  (SBU) On February 10, Poloff delivered reftel demarche 
regarding Iran's continued human rights violations in the 
aftermath of the June 12 election to Hikmat Moeljawan, Deputy 
Director for Afghanistan/Iran Affairs, at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU).  She expressed our concern for the 
human rights situation in Iran, particularly the brutal, 
repressive tactics the Iranian government has employed 
against its own population.  She stressed the potential for 
violence and repression during the "Ten Days of Dawn" period 
and urged the Indonesian government to use any upcoming 
interactions with Iranian officials to press for compliance 
with the requests of the United Nations General Assembly. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The GOI took the points on board, but had no 
immediate response.
