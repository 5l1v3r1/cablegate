SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST - RESPONSE TO NEW ZEALAND 
NOTIFICATION TO UNSCR 1737 COMMITTEE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 144910 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche to Darryl Dunn, 
Director of Middle East and African Affairs at the New 
Zealand 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Mr. Dunn said MFAT was 
formulating their response and was in the process of 
doing their internal research and seeking clearances. He said 
he hoped to have official reaction by next week. The 
one point that he did raise was that New Zealand was not the 
only country to have asked for and received a generic 
exemption. He said that he was aware that the United Kingdom 
had also received this consideration. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Action Request - In anticipation of further 
discussion with MFAT next week, Post requests guidance on 
responding 
to the point raised by Mr. Dunn that other countries like the 
UK have received a generic exemption.
