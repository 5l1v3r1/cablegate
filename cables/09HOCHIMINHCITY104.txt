¶1.  (SBU) This cable responds to State 135040 requesting that 
Post contact the foreign end user in the course of a "Blue 
Lantern Post-Shipment End Use Check" on license GC109608. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On January 21, Post contacted Mr. Vi Cong Dung, the 
director of Southern Services Flight Company (SSFC), who 
recently replaced Mr. Nguyen Duc Hoa as director.  Mr. Dung 
confirmed that SSFC purchased the Super Puma AS332L2 helicopter 
delivered in August 2008.  Dung said the helicopter (and 
gyroscopes) will be used to transport company personnel 
(civilian) staff engaged in offshore oil exploitation in Vung 
Tau province.  He confirmed that the aircraft will not be 
equipped with weapons.  Dung said he understands the 
restrictions on USML commodities, in particular the prohibition 
against re-transfer and/or re-export without express USG 
authorization.  Mr. Dung emphasized that he took up this 
position in January and is very new, but is willing to provide 
further details if requested. 
 
¶3. (U) This cable was coordinated with Embassy Hanoi.
