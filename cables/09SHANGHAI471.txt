¶1. (SBU) The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has 
indicated its desire to complete within six months its 
investigation into the November 28 crash of a 
Zimbabwean-registered MD-11 cargo charter aircraft at Shanghai 
Pudong International Airport, according to National 
Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) officials. The NTSB noted 
that such a deadline would be ambitious and challenging for any 
civil aviation authority to meet. The lone surviving American 
crewmember was transferred to a medical facility in Hong Kong on 
December 3 for further treatment. End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2. (U) On the morning of November 28, a Zimbabwean-registered 
MD-11 cargo freight plane crashed upon takeoff at Pudong 
International Airport (PVG). The seven-member crew included four 
U.S. citizens. Three of the Americans were fatally injured, and 
the fourth received serious injuries but has since stabilized. 
Carrying a load of electronic equipment destined for Bishkek, 
Kyrgyzstan, the MD-11 aircraft was attempting to take off from 
the longest of PVG's three runways. The aircraft did not lift 
off and crashed beyond the runway, erupting in flames. The PVG 
Airport Authority told Embassy Beijing FAA Attache that the 
runway involved in the crash would likely remain closed for 
"about a month," although NTSB officials personally observed a 
plane landing on said runway the morning of December 7. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
NTSB: No MD-11 Airworthiness Issues of Immediate Concern 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to NTSB officials, preliminary analysis of 
the crash indicated no immediate airworthiness concerns for the 
MD-11 aircraft; therefore, industry rumors signaling a CAAC 
"no-fly" order for MD-11 aircraft in China is imminent are 
baseless. Current lines of inquiry are focusing on operator 
issues (both for the aircraft operator Avient Aviation as well 
as for the flight crew). The NTSB officials noted that the 
aircraft had recently undergone significant refurbishment and 
only returned to service November 20.

Surviving AmCit Receiving Treatment in Hong Kong 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Having been transferred to Hong Kong December 2 for 
medical treatment, the lone surviving American crewmember, Mr. 
William Johnson remains in stable condition. (Note: Mr. Johnson 
has not signed a Privacy Act Waiver; please do not release 
information related to his condition outside USG channels. End 
Note) Family members are in frequent contact with Hong Kong 
American Citizen Services (ACS) officers. Doctors estimate he 
will need to remain hospitalized for at least an additional six 
weeks. Mr. Johnson's family is still considering a medical 
evacuation to the United States. However, doctors have cautioned 
that such a long trip might not be advisable given his current 
condition. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The CAAC still considers Mr. Johnson a part of its 
formal inquiry into the accident. When Mr. Johnson's family 
initially sought to have him moved to Hong Kong, the CAAC 
refused to permit his departure. Upon the intervention of 
Embassy Beijing FAA Attache, the CAAC consented to the transfer 
of Mr. Johnson to a medical facility in Hong Kong but requested 
notification in the event that Mr. Johnson departs Hong Kong. 
The extent of Mr. Johnson's injuries currently precludes his 
participation in an accident interview. (Note: He suffered 
severe smoke inhalation and remains on a respirator. End Note) 
The NTSB team offered to facilitate an interview with Mr. 
Johnson on behalf of the CAAC should he return to the U.S. prior 
to being interviewed. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The CAAC ordered autopsies on the three deceased 
American crewmembers December 5. Initially, the CAAC had 
indicated an autopsy would not be necessary, but ultimately 
changed its mind. (Note: NTSB officials noted that deceased 
flight crew autopsies are standard practice for aircraft

Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) FAA Attache and NTSB officials have characterized the 
CAAC's handling of the MD-11 crash investigation as very 
professional and highly cooperative. One team member commented 
to EconOff that in 1999 he participated in a CAAC-led air crash 
investigation, and that in the intervening decade the CAAC had 
made substantial improvements. Post will continue to monitor the 
situation. End Comment.
