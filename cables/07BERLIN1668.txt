REF: STATE 87824 
 
¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer contacted 
Krauss-Maffei-Wegmann (KMW) Procurement Sales Manager Harald 
Marke July 19 concerning KMV's role as an intermediate 
consignee in license application 05-050048064.  Marke sent 
the requested information to Global Affairs officer August 31. 
 
¶2. (SBU) For this particular order, Marke said KMW has a 
contract with the Dutch Defense Material Organization (DMO) 
for the delivery of 18 FENNEK Stinger Weapon Platforms. 
Marke said that KMW will install the 18 MI-J20-IY DC-DC 
converters that it ordered into the FENNEK platforms that it 
will deliver to the DMO for use by the Dutch Army for the 
Future Ground Based Air Defense System (FGBADS).  The DMO 
ordered 34 FGBADS systems from other firms, accounting for 
the total order of 52 converters from the U.S. exporter, 
according to Marke.  Marke added that KMW has received 
requests to complete DSP-83 Forms for the components and will 
do so. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Marke said KMW manufactures armored vehicles, such 
as the Leopard tank and the Grizzly armored personnel 
carrier, and associated electronics systems, mostly for the 
German Army.  KMW has been manufacturing armored vehicles 
since 1964, according to Marke.  He listed other customers as 
the armies of the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and 
Australia.  For exporting KMW vehicles and equipment outside 
of Germany, KMW applies to the German Federal Office of 
Economics and Export Controls (BAFA) for export licenses. 
When asked whether he was familiar with U.S. regulations on 
the re-export or retransfer of U.S. Munitions List items, 
Marke said KMW knows that it needs to inform the USG about 
its plans to export vehicles or systems that contain U.S. 
controlled components.
