SUBJECT: ITALY TO PROVIDE FIVE MILLION EURO TO UN FOR 
AFGHAN ELECTION AND PARLIAMENT SUPPORT 
 
REF: STATE 061560 
 
(U)  The Italian Government has approved five million Euro in 
response to the UN appeal for Afghanistan.  Four million Euro 
are designated for election support, and an additional one 
million Euro to help establish Afghanistan's new Parliament. 
Italy on April 3 requested a "letter of acceptance" from the 
UN in order to complete processing and transfer the funds. 
Upon receipt of the UN letter, the MFA Development Office for 
Afghanistan said it might take an additional week or two for 
bank processing.  Essentially, however, our MFA contacts told 
us, "the ball is in the UN's court" to receive the funds.
