REF: JAKARTA 875 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Members of several radical Muslim groups 
held a peaceful rally in front of Mission on November 8 to 
protest Israeli actions.  Approximately 6,000 demonstrators 
participated in the FUI-sponsored demonstration.  The 
FUI--which advocates for the implementation of Sharia law in 
Indonesia--is made up of several radical Islamic groups, 
including Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), the Islamic 
Defender's Front (FPI), and the Indonesian Mujahedeen Council 
(MMI).  These radical groups represent a tiny sliver of 
Indonesia's body politic.  It was the first large 
demonstration in front of the Mission in some time.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST 
 
¶3.  (U) On November 8, an estimated 6,000 demonstrators from 
the radical umbrella group, Islamic Community Forum (FUI), 
staged a protest in front of the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. 
The rally was peaceful with demonstrators chanting and 
carrying anti-Israel posters which variously read "Destroy 
Israel with Caliphate" and "Save al-Aqsa mosque and Palestine 
from Israel and its allies."  Police--including Mobile 
Brigades (BRIMOB)--provided Mission protection throughout the 
protest and the situation never grew unruly.  It was the 
first large demonstration in front of the Mission in over 
eight months. 
 
RADICAL GROUPS STAGE EVENT 
 
¶4.  (SBU) FUI is a hardline anti-Western umbrella 
organization made up of approximately 50 Muslim 
organizations.  It includes radical elements such as HTI, 
FPI, MMI, Persis and the "Voice of Palestine."  Groups such 
as FPI and MMI have been known to engage in low-level 
violence in the past.  FPI, primarily an Islamic thug group, 
promotes the implementation of Sharia law in Indonesia.  It 
is most notorious for its attack on a peaceful pro-pluralism 
rally in the capital in June 2008, and for organizing raids 
on bars, massage parlors and night clubs during Ramadan in 
years past.  The group has been relatively quiet since the 
conviction and subsequent jailing of its leader, Habib 
Rizieq, last year for his role in the 2008 attack. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The bulk of the November 8 protest was made up of 
HTI supporters.  HTI, which claims to be non-violent, is one 
of the most active radical groups in Indonesia today.  It is 
a transnational movement which advocates the imposition of 
Islamic law and the return of an Islamic "Caliphate."  The 
group promotes the implementation of Sharia law (Islamic 
jurisprudence) through religious outreach and indoctrination. 
 It is growing in size in Indonesia, primarily among urban 
middle-class intellectuals and university students, and is 
estimated to have approximately 50,000 active members and 
nearly 1.5 million sympathizers.  (Note:  HTI is a guarded 
and highly secretive organization, and does not provide exact 
membership numbers.) 
 
A TINY SLIVER OF THE BODY POLITIC 
 
¶6.  (SBU) These radical groups represent a tiny sliver of 
Indonesia's body politic.  Political Islam in general is on 
the decline with the Islamic-based parties suffering sharp 
setbacks in the parliamentary elections earlier this year. 
The rally was evidently staged in front of the U.S. Embassy 
because Indonesia does not recognize Israel and there is no 
Israeli Embassy.  In addition, the U.S. is seen here as 
Israel's major supporter.
