SUBJECT: HRC:  CANADA ASKS WESTERN GROUP TO CONSIDER A 
SPECIAL SESSION ON DARFUR/SUDAN 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  The Western Human Rights Group (WHRG) met November 
17 at Canada's request to discuss the possibility of 
requesting a special session of the Human Rights Council to 
address the situation in Darfur/Sudan or of asking that a 
segment of the November 27 - December 8 Council session be 
devoted to Darfur.  Canadian Deputy Permanent Representative, 
Ambassador Paul Meyer, highlighted the Council's 
responsibility to pronounce itself on all serious human 
rights situations wherever they occur.  This included 
situations that were under active consideration by other UN 
bodies and mechanisms. Meyer stressed that the situation in 
Darfur demanded some kind of action from the Council.  In 
addition, to the desperate situation in Darfur, the Council 
needed to demonstrate that it can deal with issues other than 
the Middle East for the sake of its credibility. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Finland on behalf of the EU, Australia, 
Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, UK, Netherlands, Sweden 
and Ireland left the door open for a special session on 
Darfur/Sudan, but questioned the timing of pressing for one 
right now. They all noted the developments overnight in Addis 
Ababa and ongoing, if contentious, discussions with the 
African Group in Geneva on a resolution text addressing the 
Darfur issue.  There was general agreement that if the 
decision is made to request a special session on Darfur, the 
Western Group would need to obtain broad support for the 
request, especially from the Latin American and Caribbean 
Group (GRULAC) and Sub-Saharan states members of the African 
Group. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:  It is uncertain that negotiations toward 
a consensus text with the African Group, which is split on 
the Darfur resolutions, will bear fruit.  At present there 
are two Darfur texts tabled:  the EU text supported by the 
WHRG and some sub-Saharan countries and the "African Group" 
text tabled by Algeria with Sudan's agreement.  Algeria, 
Sudan and Egypt are applying significant pressure on Nigeria, 
Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon, Uganda and other African states who 
want a tough text on Sudan, e.g. the EU text, to maintain 
African Group unity  -- even at the cost of what these 
countries view as their national interest.
