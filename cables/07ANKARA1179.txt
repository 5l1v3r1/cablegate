SUBJECT: IS THE PKK CEASEFIRE ABOUT TO END? 
 
Classified By: DCM Nancy McEldowney for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (S/NF) Summary: There is increasing speculation that the 
PKK's unilateral ceasefire, which it declared in October 2006 
and has somewhat observed, may end as soon as May 18.  Even 
after declaring the ceasefire -- on jailed leader Abdullah 
Ocalan's instructions -- the PKK publicly warned that it 
would end in the spring absent GOT action to improve 
conditions in the southeast.  With significant Turkish 
counterinsurgency operations underway since early April -- 
and GOT leaders taking a hard line on terrorism in the 
current highly-charged political environment -- there seems 
to be little incentive for the PKK to maintain the ceasefire. 
 Increased PKK violence would add pressure on the Erdogan 
government to approve a cross-border operation into northern 
Iraq.  End summary. 
 
Efforts to Maintain Ceasefire Continue... 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (S/NF) The PUK's Ankara Representative, Bahros Galali, 
told us May 16 that he and pro-Kurdish Democratic Society 
Party (DTP) leader Ahmet Turk recently met Iraqi President 
Talabani in Suleimaniyah, who agreed to prevail upon the PKK 
to maintain the ceasefire.  Turk requested to meet (secretly) 
with the PKK's leader in northern Iraq, Murat Karayilan, but 
was only able to send a message through intermediaries. 
Galali reported that tensions are high over the ceasefire 
issue between Karayilan and the other senior PKK leader, 
Cemil Bayik, who wants to maintain it.  Galali is concerned 
that the Turkish military will use casualties at the hands of 
the PKK to goad PM Erdogan into approving a cross-border 
operation. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Orhan Miroglu, DTP's Vice President for 
International Relations, told us May 16 that the cease fire 
had de facto ended due to the military's provocative actions 
in the southeast.  Despite this, DTP is still pushing for 
continuation of the ceasefire.  Ocalan's attorneys meet with 
him each Wednesday, and will probably get word from him today 
on his wishes.  There is a chance Ocalan will extend the 
cease fire due to the drawn-out elections process.  The May 
18 date was chosen as an arbitrary date after the 
presidential elections should have been over.  DTP is hopeful 
Ocalan will order the cease fire be held in place. 
 
...Even as Military Steps Up Ops in the Southeast 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. (S) The GOT -- especially the military -- has never 
acknowledged the PKK's ceasefire ("nations declare 
ceasefires, not terrorists"), and would likely ignore or 
treat with disdain any PKK announcement that it is over.  In 
contrast to previous years, and despite the unilateral PKK 
ceasefire, the military did not curtail counter-PKK 
operations during the winter but rather kept up a steady 
operational tempo aimed at rooting the terrorists out of 
their winter camps in southeast Turkey and keeping the 
organization on the defensive.  In March, the military 
deployed additional troops to the region to prepare for an 
expected PKK spring offensive.  In April, the military 
increased the pressure, losing 10 troops in significant 
clashes with the terrorists on April 8 and 9.  In early May, 
following the loss of four troops in a five day period in 
Sirnak province, the press reported the deployment of 20,000 
additional troops and air support to Sirnak as part of 
"Operation Sledgehammer." 
 
¶5. (S) During a May 9 visit to the Second Army Command 
headquarters in Malatya, Land Forces Commander GEN Basbug 
said the military would continue the operations "until the 
outlawed PKK is totally destroyed."  Our military contacts 
acknowledge the on-going military offensive and express 
optimism that it will be successful. 
 
The Key Word is "Pressure" 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6. (S/NF) Some Kurdish contacts describe increasing military 
pressure in some parts of the southeast.  One told us that 
residents in the Turkey-Iraq border town of Cukurca (in 
Hakkari province) are so frightened of the military's 
presence that they are essentially locked down.  Another 
contact, from the DTP, spoke of 10,000 soldiers with air 
support going after a band of 20 PKKers in Tunceli province. 
He accused the military of returning the bodies of dead PKK 
terrorists to their families without fingers and ears; this 
only increases tensions, he asserted.  While these claims are 
difficult to substantiate, the fact that they are making the 
rounds in the region is significant. 
 
¶7. (S) An end to the ceasefire would mean renewed attacks on 
Turkish security forces in the southeast and perhaps bombings 
in western and southern cities, including against tourist 
sites.  Public calls for a cross-border operation into 
northern Iraq to take out PKK camps would also increase.  In 
a highly-charged political climate on the eve of elections, 
this could spell real trouble.
