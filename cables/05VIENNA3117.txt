SUBJECT: Death of Simon Wiesenthal 
 
 
¶1.  Simon Wiesenthal died of general organ failure on 
 
September 20 in Vienna at the age of 96.  The Austrian 
 
political leadership, from Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel 
 
to all parliamentary party leaders, expressed their deep 
 
regret, praising Wiesenthal as a key figure in the fight 
 
to keep remembrance of the Holocaust alive.  In public 
 
comments, Chancellor Schuessel noted that the theme of 
 
Wiesenthal's life was justice, not revenge.  Social 
 
Democrat Party chairman Alfred Gusenbauer stressed the 
 
need to preserve Wiesenthal's heritage for all future 
 
generations.  Wiesenthal was an honorary citizen of 
 
Vienna and the recipient of many Austrian decorations. 
 
¶2.  There will be a ceremony September 21 at 3 p.m. at 
 
Vienna's Central Ceremony.  Wiesenthal's remains will 
 
then go to Israel, where the funeral and burial will take 
 
place on September 23.
