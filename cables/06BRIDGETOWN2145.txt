REF: STATE 194464 
 
¶1. (U)  Per reftel instructions, talking points discouraging 
governments from attending the 7-8 December African Caribbean 
Pacific Group of States (ACP) Summit in Khartoum were 
delivered under cover of Diplomatic Notes (Antigua #1655, 
Barbados #1656, Dominica #1657, St. Kitts #1658, St. Lucia 
#1659, St. Vincent #1660) on December 5, 2006.  The original 
Diplomatic Notes were also mailed on this date. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post followed up with phone calls to Eastern 
Caribbean MFAs and received the following responses: 
 
-- Barbados MFA Permanent Secretary Theresa Marshall told 
Charge Gilroy that Foreign Minister Dame Billie Miller will 
not/not attend the ACP Summit.  Marshall convinced Dame 
Billie, the Caribbean regional representative for the ACP, 
that her presence would be construed as support for President 
Bashir's actions.  Miller decided sending such a signal would 
be unwise and would undercut AU and UN efforts to bring peace 
to the Darfur region. 
 
-- St. Lucia MFA PermSec Cosmos Richardson told PolOff that 
the Government of St. Lucia decided a month ago not to attend 
because of the human rights atrocities in Sudan.  The Prime 
Minister personally made this decision in consultation with 
Richardson. 
 
-- St. Kitts and Nevis MFA PermSec Theresa Nisbett confirmed 
to PolCouns her government's disapproval of Sudanese human 
rights abuses and belief the Caribbean should boycott the ACP 
session.
