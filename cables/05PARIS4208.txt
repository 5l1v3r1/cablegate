START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
Vivet plays a role now in U.S.-EU aviation issues, which is 
part of Embassy Paris' MPP objectives related to economic 
prosperity and security.  Successful air transport 
negotiations with the EU will ensure continued and expanded 
market access for U.S. air carriers. 
In addition, Embassy Paris' MPP paper on Response to Terrorism 
outlines the objectives of protecting U.S. citizens in part 
through TSA and FAA's role in civil aviation security and 
safety.  As Vivet rises through the ranks at the French civil 
aviation authority, he will manage each of these issues and 
deal directly with bilateral aviation safety and security 
issues. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Vivet would need to make the rounds of all the players in U.S. 
aviation negotiations, which are led by State with the 
participation of the Department of Transportation, Department 
of Commerce, airlines and airline associations.  He should 
meet with Congressional members or staff on committees with 
oversight for aviation policy to get a grasp of legislative 
input into the process.  He would also benefit from visits to, 
and a better understanding of, our Federal Aviation 
Administration and Transportation Security Administration. 
Outside of this narrow focus, Vivet may be interested in 
looking at policy changes under discussion in FAA and DOT per 
recommendations from the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) with respect to oversight of Air Traffic 
Control.  ICAO recommendations have recently led to a 
reorganization of Vivet's agency, the General Directorate of 
Civil Aviation (DGAC), in France.  Learning how major U.S. 
airports deal with the challenge of noise abatement may be of 
interest to him also.  DGAC and the GOF have made the issue a 
high priority with mixed results for U.S. companies. 
Trade policy officials in the U.S. could provide a forward- 
looking view at trade-in-services agreements.  American 
academics and business executives with a focus on the future 
of the air transport industry (legacy carriers vs. low-cost), 
or negotiation theory could provide insight into areas he 
would want to explore.  In addition, a stop at Boeing with the 
right officials would be important to show the other side of 
the aircraft manufacturing subsidies debate.  In a broader 
perspective, interaction with State governments for a better 
general understanding of federalism would be in order. 
On a personal side, Vivet is the skipper of an eight-main 
sailing team in national competition and may want to 
experience sailing in the U.S.  He is also an amateur musician 
and supports a handicapped persons association.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Amy Westling 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Emmanuel Vivet is a promising civil servant who is smart, 
ambitious and clearly destined for broader responsibilities in 
French government beyond his current position of civil 
aviation negotiator. 
As a negotiator, Vivet has represented France in 7 of the 9 
negotiating rounds between the European Union and the U.S. on 
a US/EU open skies air transport agreement.  On internal EU 
aviation issues, Vivet drafts positions for the French 
Ambassador and his team at France's permanent representation 
to the EU in Brussels and has participated in 35 bilateral air 
services consultations between France and countries outside 
the European Union.  In this position he prepares negotiations 
by defining the French position in consultation with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and French airlines.  He takes the 
floor in negotiations, drafts the MOUs and sends diplomatic 
reports. 
In my meetings with Vivet, he has demonstrated a mastery of 
his aviation brief and the English language that is 
impressive.  He demonstrates an outlook that is curious and 
open to the world while he clearly articulates the logic 
behind his government's positions.  His superiors have trusted 
him with significant responsibility at a relatively young age. 
Vivet is exactly the type of bright civil servant that we want 
to expose to the complexities of the U.S. policy context.  For 
the immediate future, an IV experience would give him a better 
understanding of the interaction between the executive and 
legislative branches and the influence of the private sector 
in air services negotiations. 
Partly because of fundamental differences between the U.S. and 
France on the role of government in society, conventional 
wisdom in France often dictates that U.S. policy be described 
in simplistic and misguided terms.  Even intelligent, well- 
educated people sometimes accept such generalizations because 
they have no alternative reality to refute them.  The IV 
program provides the opportunity to present the reality of the 
U.S. in all its complexity.  Vivet is a prime candidate for 
the experience because he is young, competent, open to other 
points of view and undoubtedly will rise to a position of 
authority in the French government.  Now and in the future, 
his work needs to be informed by a more realistic picture of 
how U.S. government and society work, a view that will 
influence his official decisions.
