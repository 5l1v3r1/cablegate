¶1.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARA 5 FOR 
ACTION. 
 
¶2.  (U) Post appreciates RM's cooperation in 2008 in granting 
a 12-month waiver under 4 FAH-3 H-394.2-1 Cash Payment 
Limitation for specific INL operations involving cash 
payments in excess of USD 3,000, allowing cash payments of 
approximately $10,000 (REF A). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As noted in REF B, these payments are made under an 
INL/DEA program to support host government National Police 
with narcotics interdiction efforts.  The support is in the 
form of travel per diem and fuel.  Checks and/or electronic 
funds transfers are not feasible in the current political 
climate and would put this operation at risk. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post continues to adhere to proper controls per INL 
guidance and DEA operational procedures to ensure the funds 
are expended in accordance with the existing letter of 
agreement (LOA) with the host government. 
 
¶5.  (U) ACTION REQUEST.  The existing waiver will expire on 
October 31, 2009.  Post requests an extension or a renewal of 
the waiver granted in REF A. 
 
¶6.  (U) The point of contact for this request is Financial 
Management Officer, Margarita Halle.
