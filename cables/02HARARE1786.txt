SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: SCRIBES TO CHALLENGE AIPPA; HARARE 
 
 
Independent journalists in Zimbabwe have filed an 
application with the Supreme Court challenging the legality 
of some sections of the recently enacted Access to 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA).  The 
Independent Journalists Association of Zimbabwe (IJAZ) - 
represented by Abel Mutsikani (president of IJAZ) and 
Vincent Kahiya (news editor of the weekly "Zimbabwe 
Independent") - filed the application early this week 
seeking the court to declare Sections 79, 80, 83 and 85 of 
AIPPA as "unconstitutional."  Information Minister Jonathan 
Moyo is cited as the first respondent.  The Media and 
Information Commission, headed by Dr. Tafataona Mahoso, and 
the Attorney General, Andrew Chigovera, are cited as the 
second and third respondents respectively.  Already 13 
journalists have been charged under the Act.  AIPPA is also 
facing legal challenges from the Foreign Correspondents 
Association, who filed an affidavit last month asking the 
Supreme Court to declare the laws on the registration of 
media groups and licensing of journalists unconstitutional.
