Econ Counselor met September 27 with Ministry of Economy 
Director General for International Finance Ramon Guzman 
Zapater to discuss reftel points on the Tokyo Donor's 
meeting.  Guzman informed us that Spain would be represented 
by a representative from the Ministry of Commerce and Trade's 
Subdirectorate General for Commercial Policy in the Middle 
East and the Spanish Embassy in Tokyo.  Guzman said that the 
USD 20 million pledge to the IRFFI and the USD 5 million 
pledge to the IFC Small Business Facility was approved by the 
Council of Ministers September 17 and should be disbursed 
prior to the Tokyo meeting.  Guzman also mentioned that he 
believes the new Socialist government is committed to 
fulfilling Spain's entire Iraq pledge, though the security 
situation might make delivery of much of the tied aid 
challenging.
