SUBJECT: PRINCIPLES OF THE GLOBAL NUCLEAR ENERGY 
PARTNERSHIP (GNEP) - PAPER DELIVERED TO FRENCH AUTHORITIES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 139918 
 
On August 25, Embassy provided Deputy Energy Secretary Sell's 
and Under Secretary Joseph's letter, together with the Draft 
Global Nuclear Energy Partnership Statement of Principles, to 
Stanislas Lefebvre de Laboulaye, the MFA's Political 
Director.  (Sell and Joseph called upon Laboulaye earlier in 
the year to discuss GNEP.)  Embassy also provided a copy of 
the draft principles to the Deputy Director for International 
Affairs at France's Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), Didier 
Kechemair.  On August 28, ESTH counselor and ESTH 
nonproliferation officer provided copies of the 
above-mentioned letter and principles to the Deputy Director 
of the Sub-Directorate for Nuclear Nonproliferation, Hugues 
de Longevialle.  The latter recalled the several instances in 
which senior U.S. and French officials have discussed GNEP 
and said that French authorities would be pleased to review 
the draft principles.  We emphasized that the U.S. would very 
much appreciate receiving any French comments in the next two 
weeks.
