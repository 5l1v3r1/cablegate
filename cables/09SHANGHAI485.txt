¶1. (SBU) Shanghai Airlines (SAL) representatives met with 
Shanghai Consulate Officers December 14 to resolve lingering 
confusion following a November 28 Department of Homeland 
Security directive permitting visa-free travel to the U.S. 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) by Chinese 
nationals. According to the Shanghai Airlines representatives, 
coinciding with the November 28 directive, SAL unilaterally 
decided to suspend service for the twice-weekly flights 
(scheduled for Mondays and Fridays) between Shanghai's Pudong 
International Airport and Saipan International Airport. Under 
the new directive, DHS indicated it will parole into the CNMI 
visitors for business or pleasure who are nationals of the PRC. 
Parole will be authorized only for entry into the CNMI and will 
not extend to other areas of the United States for a duration of 
stay not to exceed 45 days. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy Beijing had previously notified the PRC 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs via diplomatic note of the impending 
change. However, the Shanghai Entry-Exit Administration of the 
Public Security Bureau informed SAL prior to November 28 that 
the Central Government's Ministry of Public Security had not 
issued any guidance concerning the new visa waiver directive. 
Consequently, SAL decided to suspend the service pending formal 
Chinese internal government notifications (namely, for Shanghai 
Entry-Exit Administration to receive word from the Central 
Government). The SAL representatives also noted that, in spite 
of the new directive, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) had 
since informed SAL that pilots and crew would still require 
visas. CBP has instituted a transitional period through January 
15, 2010 during which PRC-citizen pilots and crew traveling to 
CNMI without a visa will not incur any fines. SAL expects to 
resume the twice-weekly flights from Shanghai to Saipan 
beginning December 18. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The SAL representatives raised the DHS requirement for 
airlines to complete a signatory carrier agreement in order to 
be authorized to bring passengers to CNMI under the new 
directive. SAL was not prepared for this new requirement when 
the directive came into effect. However, according to the SAL 
representatives, the airline is now a signatory to the Guam-CNMI 
Visa Waiver Program. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The Shanghai Consular section offered SAL immediate 
assistance in obtaining crew visas for an estimated 120 staff 
(pilots, engineers, flight attendants) that are involved with 
this route. (Note: The CNMI is SAL's first and only passenger 
flight to a U.S. destination. SAL also operates cargo flights to 
Los Angeles International Airport. End Note.) The SAL 
representatives welcomed the offer of assistance and noted that 
the staff would apply for their visas upon issuance of new 
machine-readable passports by the Shanghai Foreign Affairs 
Office. 
 
¶5. (SBU) SAL and China Southern are the only two airlines to 
operate flights between mainland China and the CNMI. SAL 
representatives told us that the passenger load for their 
twice-weekly flights in the lead-up to the service suspension 
was a "satisfactory 80 percent." SAL operates Boeing 767s to 
service the CNMI route, with seating for 263 passengers. 
According to the SAL representatives, Shanghai-Saipan route 
service began with chartered flights in early 2008. Due to high 
demand, beginning on September 4, 2009, SAL changed the route 
from chartered service to scheduled service. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Chinese nationals require visas to travel to most 
international destinations, which may in part explain some of 
the confusion and trepidation exhibited by Chinese authorities 
when encountering would be Chinese national tourists departing 
China for a U.S. destination without valid visas. Prior to the 
new DHS directive that went into effect November 28, CNMI issued 
its own, distinct visas to Chinese visitors through two travel 
agent consolidators Century Tours and Tinian Dynasty. The 
Shanghai Consular section routinely sees the previous CNMI visas 
in the passports of visa applicants. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) works 
with Kentucky-based National Tour Association (NTA) to provide 
an exclusive "approved list" of tour operators that promote 
tourism between the U.S. and China. CNTA and NTA maintain 
separate lists. Century Tours and Tinian Dynasty work 
exclusively with Chinese tour operators to arrange tours to 
CNMI. Although both Century Tours and Tinian Dynasty are U.S. 
tour operators based in Saipan, only Century Tours is on NTA's 
approved list as of August 11, 2009. Tinian Dynasty operates 
under a "special designation" by CNTA. Both operators also have 
 
SHANGHAI 00000485  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
representative offices throughout China and work with Shanghai 
Airlines and China Southern Airlines to arrange chartered 
flights from China to Saipan.
