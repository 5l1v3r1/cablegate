(SBU) Ambassador Feinstein and EconOffs stressed in a variety 
of public and private settings the importance of 
international support to get the Copenhagen Accord up and 
running as quickly as possible.  Deputy Foreign Minister 
Dowgielewicz told Ambassador Feinstein in a meeting on 
January 21 that EU members states would associate with the 
Copenhagen Accord by the January 31 deadline.  Dowgielewicz 
did not, however, address whether Poland expected to 
associate individually or as part of a collective European 
Union (EU) association.  He stressed that details were still 
being negotiated in Brussels.  Piotr Serafin, MFA Under 
Secretary for Climate and Energy, separately told EconOff 
that negotiations among member states were ongoing not only 
to determine EU collective versus individual association, but 
also regarding submission of collective versus individual 
mitigation targets and actions.
