SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS/FRANCE: INSTRUMENTS SIGNED FOR 
EXTRADITION AND MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: TRAUB/COOK EMAILS OF 9/30 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  Embassy pouched to L/T on September 30 signed instruments 
relating to mutual legal assistance and extradition, 
concluded between the Netherlands the United States and 
between France and the United States, registered pouch 
numbers 1530586 and 1530587.  The Netherlands/US instruments 
were signed by AG Ashcroft and Minister of Justice Donner on 
September 29 in The Hague.  The French/US instruments were 
signed by AG Ashcroft and Minister of Justice Peren on 
September 30 in The Hague. 
 
¶2.  We pouched original copies of the Full Powers from both 
the French and Dutch Ministers of Justice.  We enclosed the 
original Note from the Netherlands replying to our Note 
Verbale associated with the instruments.  Finally, we 
returned extra unused paper and morrocans sent earlier by the 
Department.  As soon as Embassy receives the original Full 
Powers for AG Ashcroft, we will provide them to the French 
and Dutch reps here to replace the faxed copies we exchanged 
before the signings.   (Note:  For the Netherlands/US 
instruments, both the Dutch and English language texts were 
printed and bound by the Treaty Office at the Dutch Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs in the presence of Poloff.  For the 
France/US instruments, the English texts were printed by 
Poloff using files e-mailed from the Department (L/T), owing 
to the fact that the English language printed pages from the 
Department were delayed in shipment.  The French provided the 
printed French language texts.  Poloff and French Embassy 
counterpart bound those texts.  End note.)
