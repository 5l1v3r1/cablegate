¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  TODAY'S TURKISH DUNYA NEWSPAPER (A 
BUSINESS DAILY), REPORTED THAT TURKEY'S MINISTER OF 
AGRICULTURE SAMI GUCLU VISITED THE "MONSTER TOMATO 
BALLOON" IN ANKARA YESTERDAY.  THE GIANT TOMATO, AS 
PART OF A NATION WIDE ANTI-GMO CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN 
TOURING TURKEY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW.  THIS BALLOON WAS 
ORGANIZED AND EXHIBITED BY THE `NO' FOR GMO'S PLATFORM, 
WHICH WAS FORMED BY 90 NGOS.  IN HIS STATEMENTS, THE 
MINISTER INDICATED THAT THE GOT WILL BE INCREASING ITS 
CONTROL OF GMO IMPORTS AT CUSTOMS.  DESPITE THE TONE OF 
THESE STATEMENTS, THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE IS MOST 
LIKELY ATTEMPTING TO SEND A SIGNAL TO CONSUMERS THAT 
THE GOT IS IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.  NO IMMEDIATE 
DISRUPTION IN TRADE IS ANTICIPATED, ALTHOUGH PER 
REFTEL, NEW LEGISLATION THAT MAY BE APPROVED BY 
PARLIAMENT IN AS LITTLE AS TWO TO THREE MONTHS HAS THE 
POTENTIAL TO BE QUITE DISRUPTIVE. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) IN HIS REMARKS, MINISTER GUCLU UNDERLINED 
THAT CURRENTLY IMPORTS OF GMO PRODUCTS, EXCEPT SEEDS, 
ARE PROHIBITED.  NOTE.  BY SEEDS, THE MINISTER IS 
LIKELY REFERRING TO GRAINS SUCH AS CORN AND SOYBEANS. 
IMPORTS OF GMO PLANTING SEEDS ARE FORBIDDEN.  FURTHER, 
THERE ARE ACTUALLY NO CONTROLS FOR GMO CONTENT IN 
PROCESSED FOODS.  END NOTE.  HE ALSO ADDED THAT, 
CONSIDERING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PUBLIC ON THIS 
ISSUE, THE GOT IS IMPROVING ITS LABORATORY 
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND WILL SEARCH FOR THESE PRODUCTS AT 
CUSTOMS.  THE MINISTER STATED THAT CONFIRMATION FROM 
THE SUPPLIER COUNTRY FOR GMO CONTENT WILL BE REQUIRED, 
AND THAT THE GOT WILL ALSO ASK IMPORTING COMPANIES TO 
ANALYZE THESE PRODUCTS AT GOT LABORATORIES (AT THEIR 
OWN EXPENSE) FOR GMO CONTENT. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) TODAY AG ATTACHE MET WITH DEPUTY 
UNDERSECRETARY HASAN EKIZ TO RAISE CONCERN OVER THE 
MINISTER'S STATEMENT, AND PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION 
FROM A PREVIOUS REQUEST. NOTE. DR. EKIZ WAS AN ATTENDEE 
AT THE SECRETARY'S SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SEMINAR IN 
CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR.  END NOTE.  DR. EKIZ, WHO 
INDICATED THAT HE IS IN SUPPORT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, IS 
ALSO HIGHLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE TOPIC.  TO A CERTAIN 
EXTENT, DR. EKIZ DOWNPLAYED THE MINISTER'S STRONG 
REMARKS BY INDICATING THAT THE AGRICULTURE MINISTRY WAS 
OBLIGED TO CONVEY PUBLICLY TO CONSUMER GROUPS THAT THEY 
WERE TAKING ACTION TO DEVELOP BIOTECHNOLOGY 
REGULATIONS.  DR. EKIZ INITIALLY CONFIRMED THAT THE GOT 
WOULD NOT COMPLETELY BLOCK IMPORTS.  SUBSEQUENT 
STATEMENTS, HOWEVER, INDICATED THAT THE TOLERANCE 
LEVELS ESTABLISHED BY TURKEY THROUGH THE PENDING 
LEGISLATION MIGHT `TEMPORARILY' BE QUITE RESTRICTIVE. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENTS.  WHILE IT WAS ENCOURAGING TO MEET A 
GOT BUREAUCRAT WHO WAS KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE TOPIC, THE 
PERSISTENT NEGATIVE PRESS AND CAMPAIGN OF THE `NO' TO 
GMO PLATFORM HAS TURNED THIS INTO A POLITICAL ISSUE, 
AND NOT A SCIENTIFIC ONE.  IN THE DEPUTY SECRETARY'S 
OWN WORDS, THE AGRICULTURE MINISTRY IS IN A VERY 
DIFFICULT SITUATION.  PER REFTEL B., FUTURE LEGISLATION 
IS LIKELY TO ADDRESS THE POLITICAL ELEMENT FIRST, AND 
CONSIDER ECONOMIC AND SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS SECONDARY. 
END COMMENTS. 
 
¶5.  POST WILL REPLY SEPTEL TO STATE (#228322) REQUEST 
FOR PROPOSALS TO FUND SPEAKERS AND SPECIALISTS TO VISIT 
TURKEY.  SUCH PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED IN TURKEY, BUT NEED 
TO BE COORDINATED CAREFULLY WITH THE GOT AND LOCAL FOOD 
AND FEED ASSOCIATIONS.
