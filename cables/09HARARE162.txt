SUBJECT: NEW ZIMBABWEAN CABINET ASSEMBLED 
 
REF: HARARE 130 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The newly-constituted Zimbabwean Cabinet is 
comprised of 42 members, consisting of six principals (the 
president, the prime minister, two vice presidents, and two 
deputy prime ministers) and 36 Cabinet-level ministers. 
There are an additional five ministers of state who are not 
members of Cabinet.  Twenty deputy ministerial positions have 
also been allocated, with ZANU-PF receiving 10, MDC-T nine, 
and MDC-M one.  The incarcerated deputy minister of 
Agriculture, Roy Bennett, is the only ministerial level 
official not yet sworn into office (Ref). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The ministerial nominations represented 
approximately a 33 percent expansion from the totals agreed 
upon in the Interparty Political Agreement (IPA) signed last 
September.  The IPA and Amendment 19 stipulated a total of 31 
ministers and 15 deputy ministers, while the final tally is 
41 ministers and 20 deputy ministers.  Most significantly, 
the increase in ministers has given ZANU-PF the majority of 
votes in Cabinet, although according to the IPA and Amendment 
19 all decisions have to be made in consensus. 
 
¶3.  (U) The table below groups the two MDC formations 
together, includes the six principals, and compares the 
allocation of positions in the IPA with the current 
situation:

Non-Cabinet Ministers 0      0       3       2 
 
   GRAND TOTAL       18     19      25      22 
 
In comparison, the 2005 Cabinet had 30 ministries and 
ministers. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The expansion of the cabinet from the numbers 
contemplated by the IPA and stipulated in Amendment 19 was a 
decision of the principals--ZANU-PF head Robert Mugabe, and 
MDC leaders Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara.  Mugabe 
was the prime mover as ZANU-PF lost cabinet positions as a 
result of the inclusive government, and he tried to find 
positions for ZANU-PF loyalists.  Nevertheless, Tsvangirai 
and Mutambara went along in an effort to find positions for 
some of their people as well.  Widely and justifiably being 
criticized as bloated by political analysts and the 
independent press, the Cabinet will require badly needed 
resources to pay salaries and buy emoluments of office such 
as luxury cars.  And potential donors will know a portion of 
assistance will be used for unnecessary government officials. 
 
 
¶5. (U) The following is a list of senior Zimbabwean officials 
which indicates their government position, party affiliation, 
province of origin and ethnicity.  Post will provide greater
