SUBJECT: SPAIN:  MFA SUPPORTIVE OF SHELL/REPSOL FRAMEWORK 
AGREEMENT ON IRAN LNG PROJECT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 204528 
 
¶1.  (U) We delivered reftel demarche to Repsol YPF's Director 
General for the Eastern Hemisphere and Orient Mario B. Rosso, 
as well as to Alberto Moreno Humet, Deputy Director of the 
Near East, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Moreno expressed doubt that this issue would gain 
any traction within the GOS, in part due to the positive 
financial impact that this project could have on Spain,s 
dominant petroleum company and former government-owned 
monopoly. 
 
¶3.  (U) Rosso has not been available for comment on this 
matter.  We will forward his response should it be 
forthcoming. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  We anticipate that the potential 
financial gains from this project will be the driving factor 
in Spanish policy in Iran.  Additionally, permitting the 
continuation of this project tracks with the GOS impression 
that Iran cannot be coerced into a certain type of behavior, 
but rather can be managed through stronger political and 
economic links.
