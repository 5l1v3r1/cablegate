SUMMARY 
 
¶1.  The UN Country Team has launched a plan that 
outlines five priorities to achieve stabilization in 
Somalia over the next six months.  The UN requests $50 
million to achieve concrete outcomes from February to 
August 2007.  The UN's priorities outlined in the 
document are building institutional capacity, 
establishing rule of law and security, providing basic 
social services through the Somali Transitional Federal 
Government (TFG), assisting and relocating internally 
displaced persons (IDPs), and generating employment and 
livelihood opportunities.  End Summary. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
¶2.  On January 30, the UN Country Team for Somalia 
presented USAID staff members with a draft of the UN 
Priorities in Support of Stabilization in South-Central 
Somalia.  This plan outlines the immediate steps the UN 
will take in the next six months to support the 
historic window of opportunity created by the removal 
of the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC) from power.  The 
plan requests a total of $50 million, of which $15.7 
million has already been mobilized by UN agencies, 
leaving $34.3 million of the plan currently unfunded. 
 
¶3.  The activities outlined in the plan are priority 
actions focusing on the southern and central regions 
and are not intended to cover the full scale of UN 
operations.  The UN plans to continue operations in 
Somaliland and Puntland as previously envisioned in its 
long-term strategy.  The UN stabilization priorities 
for southern and central Somalia build on the 
humanitarian activities listed under the UN 
Consolidated Appeal for 2007 and several Reconstruction 
and Development Framework (RDF) objectives that can be 
launched now. 
 
¶4.  In order for interventions to be sustainable, the 
UN has developed a code of conduct for principled 
support and a do no harm approach.  Learning from the 
past, the code of conduct is designed to prevent a 
system of coercion and violence.  All UN agencies 
implementing the six month plan will adhere to the 
principles in the code of conduct. 
 
UN STABILIZATION PRIORITIES 
 
¶5.  In the plan, the UN outlines five priorities that 
relevant lead agencies will implement.  Lead UN 
agencies identified include the UN Development Program 
(UNDP), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World 
Health Organization (WHO), the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN World Food 
Program (WFP), UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the Joint UN 
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the UN Development Fund 
for Women (UNIFEM), and the International Labor 
Organization (ILO).  In the document, the UN lists 
intended outcomes under each of these five priority 
areas: 
 
--Capacity Building:  The UN plans to build the 
institutional capacity of a number of key institutions 
through rehabilitation of buildings, provision of 
 
NAIROBI 00000523  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
equipment, short-term technical assistance, and 
training. 
 
--Rule of Law and Security:  The UN plans to establish 
rule of law and security through improved policing and 
reintegration of ex-combatants. 
 
--Social Services:  The UN plans to provide basic 
social services through the TFG.  For example, a back 
to school campaign, including the rehabilitation of 
schools, deployment and payment of teachers, and 
provision of school supplies are envisioned.  Basic 
health care will also be rapidly provided to vulnerable 
populations. 
 
--IDPs:  In the next six months, the UN plans to 
relocate and provide immediate assistance to IDPs 
living in public buildings or those displaced by the 
conflict. 
 
--Livelihoods:  The UN also plans to increase affected 
populations' economic recovery through employment and 
increased livelihoods opportunities. 
 
¶6.  To achieve the five priority goals, the UN is 
taking immediate action to reinforce its operational 
capacity in Mogadishu.  However, the UN suspended UN 
Common Air Service (UNCAS) flights to Mogadishu 
following the attack at Mogadishu airport on January 
¶25.  The suspension of humanitarian flights is likely 
to hamper the UN's ability to scale-up activities in 
Mogadishu that support the stabilization plan. 
 
FUNDING 
 
¶7.  The UN encourages donors to provide non-earmarked 
funds through the UNDP-managed Interim Support Fund 
(ISF) for Somalia or through the Humanitarian Response 
Fund managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 
 
¶8.  The UN requests $50 million to support the 
operations outlined for the next six months, excluding 
food aid.  UN agencies have already mobilized $15.7 
million, leaving $34.3 million to be funded. 
 
¶9.  The Nairobi-based Somalia Donor Group is currently 
evaluating this plan and has not made any funding 
commitments. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
¶10.  The plan presented by the UN Country Team is 
reasonable, practical, and achievable.  The UN Country 
Team has strong leadership who understand the 
priorities and challenges of working in Somalia. 
 
¶11.  In fiscal year (FY) 2007, USAID plans to support 
strategic work in coordination with the UN and a range 
of development partners in the areas of peace and 
security, governing justly and democratically, and 
investing in people.  Planned USAID investments in 
these areas are aligned with USG policy towards helping 
Somalia regain political, economic, and social 
stability.  USAID will channel non-food humanitarian 
assistance through USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign 
Disaster Assistance's network of implementing partners 
 
NAIROBI 00000523  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
and key UN agencies working to provide basic social 
services for vulnerable populations, including IDPs. 
 
¶12.  As of January 31, the UN had not issued a 
finalized version of this plan; consequently, the 
details described above may change at a later date.
