 (C)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to the MFA's Somalia 
desk officer Katri Leino on March 16 and spoke with her again 
on March 22.  Leino said that she shared U.S. concerns about 
IGAD deployment of frontline troops to Somalia and opined 
that it would best to use troops from the African Union; 
however, she said that as Finland was not playing an active 
role in the deliberations, there was no official position on 
the issue.  She said that she believed that Sweden was 
representing Nordic concerns in intra-EU deliberations.
