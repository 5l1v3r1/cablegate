SUBJECT: RESPONSE NEEDED: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT DRAFT 
 
REF: A. Jakarta 300  B. State 14561 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request, please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 20, 2009, Post passed the draft U.S.-Indonesia 
Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation to the Government of 
Indonesia (GOI), following up on Secretary Clinton's February 18 
promise to Foreign Minister Wirayuda.  The Indonesians demonstrated 
exceptional interest and commitment to completing this agreement by 
holding three consecutive weekly interagency meetings.  The GOI 
provided formal comments on March 20, 2009, just four weeks after 
receiving the draft.  Such speed is not customary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The U.S. side has now had three months to consider 
Indonesian comments-three times longer than the Indonesians used to 
provide their comments.  Further delay by the U.S. side may 
inadvertently suggest to the Indonesians that the United States is 
not serious about the agreement. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The window of opportunity for completing the Science and 
Technology Agreement may be rapidly closing. Minister of Research 
and Technology Kusmayanto Kadiman's staff told us that the Minister 
wants to complete this agreement as part of his legacy before he 
finishes his term in October.  The GOI will slow down during Ramadan 
(August 20 through September 21), further reducing the time 
available to complete negotiations.  Our supporters within 
Indonesian governmental institutions are prepared to move quickly 
and are anxious to expedite review but need our response.  We do not 
want to see the Science and Technology Agreement become a lost 
opportunity. 
 
¶5. (U) Action Request: Post requests Washington provide an immediate 
response to the GOI's comments on the draft Science and Technology 
Agreement.  Post also requests that Washington send a team with 
negotiating authority to Indonesia to work through remaining 
concerns. Post appreciates Washington's support of science and 
technology engagement with Indonesia.
