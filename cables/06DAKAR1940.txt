SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR SIGNS USTDA GRANT FOR FEASIBILITY 
STUDY ON PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTATION FROM MATAM 
 
¶1.  On August 1, Senegalese Minister of Energy and Mines 
Madicke Niang and Ambassador Jacobs presided over a 
signing ceremony formalizing a USD 314,000 feasibility 
study grant from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency 
(USTDA) to the Direction of Mining to assess the costs of 
transporting mined phosphates to a Senegalese port of 
export.  The signing ceremony received wide press coverage 
by the local media. 
 
¶2.  The feasibility of the exploitation of the Matam 
phosphate deposits depends on the delivered cost of the 
phosphate to a port of export.  Senegal's Director of 
Mines and Geology, Dr. Moussa Sylla, lauded USTDA's answer 
to their long-standing prayers for a feasibility study to 
assess the various costs.  To date, the phosphate mines of 
Matam remain unexploited due to their remote location in 
eastern Senegal. 
 
¶3.  Under the USTDA feasibility study a U.S. consultant 
will review a number of transportation alternatives to 
include barge, road and rail models.  The rail models 
would require the construction of new lines and/or the 
upgrading of existing lines to heavy haul standards.  In 
addition to developing transportation models, the 
consultant will undertake phosphate movement forecasts to 
determine the volume of phosphate to be shipped from the 
mine.  Forecasting will cover the estimated delivered 
price of the commodity at port, estimated world commodity 
price, and estimated production start-up costs. 
 
¶4.  The feasibility study will also tie in with another 
USTDA-funded study on the development of a multi-commodity 
bulk port at Bargny, which could handle mineral exports 
and which is adjacent to the proposed Millennium Challenge 
Account industrial platform at Diamniadio. 
 
¶5.  The signing ceremony generated substantial and 
positive coverage in local media, including the Senegalese 
Press Agency, Le Matin (circ. 15,000), Le Quotidien (circ. 
18,000), Le Messager (circ. 5,000), and Le Soleil (circ. 
22,000), as well as the evening news on the national 
television network RTS.  Reports cited Minister Niang as 
saying that the grant "confirms the U.S. Government's day- 
to-day engagement in supporting development projects in 
our country." 
 
¶6.  COMMENT: Should the costs of transporting Matam 
phosphate to a port or processing facility prove viable, 
this USTDA feasibility study would move to the 
implementation stage which could result in more U.S. 
exports to Senegal while contributing to the improvement 
of Senegal's transportation infrastructure. END COMMENT.
