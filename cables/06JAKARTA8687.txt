REF: A. JAKARTA 8383 (OPENING OF TIMIKA TRIAL DEFERRED) 
 
     ¶B. JAKARTA 8114 (TRIAL OF TIMIKA SUSPECTS) 
 
¶1. (SBU) The trial of Anthonious Wamang, Agustinus Anggaibak 
and five other co-conspirators in the 2002 murders of two 
Amcits in Timika, Papua was delayed again when the defendants 
failed to appear for the second straight week (ref A). 
Defense lawyers from the Indonesian Legal Aid and Human 
Rights Association (PBHI) continue to insist that the trial 
should be held in Timika.  As expected, Chief Judge Nurdin 
ordered that the suspects be compelled to appear at the next 
session, scheduled for July 18, and we expect that the 
Supreme Court's decision to change the venue of the trial 
from Papua to Jakarta will stand.  Journalists from both 
Indonesia and Australia attended the session, but unlike the 
first session no protesters were present. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Separately, we met with Patsy Spiers' privately 
contracted attorney, Luhut M. P. Pangaribuan on July 10.  A 
former President of PBHI, Pangaribuan stated that he 
personally knows both the defense team and Chief Judge 
Nurdin, whom he considers to be very capable. He also stated 
that the defense was not aware of his role as Ms. Spiers' 
private attorney.  We emphasized our desire to keep in 
regular contact with them in order to ensure that Ms. Spiers 
has the full support she needs.  An attorney from 
Pangaribuan's office attended the July 11 session.
