SUBJECT: CHAD UPDATE, 5/8:  GOC DEFEATS REBELS DECISIVELY 
TWICE ON 5/7; WILL GOC NOW PURSUE REBELS INTO SUDAN? 
 
REF: A. NDJAMENA 156 AND PREVIOUS 
     ¶B. NDJAMENA 155 
 
¶1.  (SBU) CHAD REBELS STATUS:  As of morning May 8, the 
Chadian military inflicted two decisive defeats on Chad 
rebels.  The rebels appear to have been decisively defeated 
in May 7 battles south of Am-Dam and later near Am-Timan, 
inflicting heavy casualties.  Remaining rebels are dispersed 
and in flight back toward Sudan.  Rebel columns still in 
Sudan made no apparent effort to cross into Chad.  The UN may 
keep its security alert in place for southeastern Chad on 
grounds that fleeing rebels might try to victimize 
humanitarian aid workers.  Earlier reports that Tahir Wodji, 
rebel Chief of Staff, was killed are not/not correct (Ref A). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) CHAD MILITARY REACTION:  Our best sources confirm 
the basic content of the GOC's May 7 1600 press conference, 
namely that the Chadian National Army (ANT) battled and 
destroyed a majority of rebels in the area just south of 
Am-Dam on May 7.  ANT troops moved eastward from Mongo, 
driving the rebels into a second line of ANT troops arrayed 
east of rebel positions, which destroyed the column as a 
fighting force inflicting heavy casualties and capturing 
perhaps hundreds.  ANT troops then pursued the remaining 
rebel column further south and defeated them near Am-Timan, 
foiling their attempt to reach CAR.  Disorganized remaining 
rebels appear to be trying to flee toward the Chad-Sudan-CAR 
tri-border area, and Chad forces are attempting to block any 
rebel retreat to Sudan -- which may account for continued, 
unconfirmed reports of skirmishes May 8.  Final casulty 
figures on both sides are likely be much highers than those 
the GOC released May 7 of 20-40 troop ANt deaths and 
approximately 100 rebel captures.  The big qquestion is 
whether the GOC forces will attempt to follow fleeing Chad 
rebels back into Sudan in hot pursuit, as Pres Deby has said 
many times that he would. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) GOC ACTIVITIES:  The government plans to fly 
international journalists out to the Am-Dam battlefield May 8 
for confirmation of GOC victory/rebel defeat.  Political 
party leaders still expect the invitation to meet President 
Deby to be rescheduled for today after yesterday's 
cancellation, although no time has been set as of yet.  The 
Foreign Ministry has convoked the diplomatic corps for 1215 
local time May 8. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) MINURCAT:  The UN has resumed normal humanitarian 
flight operations between N'Djamena and Abeche and Abeche and 
points north.  Movements around Goz Beida are still halted 
due to ongoing ANT activity. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) CAPITAL CALM:  Life in N'Djamena appears normal May 
¶8.  Lack of clarity as to what has transpired in the east is 
prevalent, although there is a noticeable decrease in tension. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) EMBASSY ACTIONS:  Embassy has stood down some 
emergency action preparations but remains vigilant on all 
azimuths and is reviewing the current situation continuously. 
 
¶8.  (U) Minimize considered.
