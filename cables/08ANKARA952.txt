DTP's Ahmet Turk: A Democratic Project Needed for the PKK to Disarm 
 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Radikal, Taraf, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak and others 
report DTP group chief Ahmet Turk "clarified" his remarks to the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) website.  The website reported 
yesterday Turk commented after his meetings with Iraqi President 
Jalal Talabani last week, "The armed struggle waged by the PKK harms 
the interests of the Kurdish people."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak 
reports Turk said the remarks belong to Iraqi President Talabani. 
In a statement released Thursday, Turk said he meant to say Turkey 
needs to present a democratic plan that includes plans on PKK 
disarmament and ways to provide a voice to Kurdish identity issues 
in the political system.  "Calls are being made for the disarming of 
the organization while the government pursues a policy of violence. 
The Kurdish question cannot be resolved without a democratic 
project," emphasized Turk.  He noted he told the leaders he met in 
northern Iraq that Kurds should come together and agree on the 
resolution to the problem on a peaceful basis. 
 
AKP Closure Case 
Sabah, Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Yeni Safak, Vatan, Star and 
others:  Mainstream Sabah and Hurriyet report that Parliament 
Speaker Koksal Toptan called the Constitutional Court and urged them 
to find a third solution in the closure case against the AKP. 
Toptan wants this third way to be more like a "warning" to the party 
and eliminate the concerns of the secularists, notes Hurriyet. 
Liberal Radikal reports that during a meeting with the AKP deputies, 
PM Erdogan said "we are not considering a constitutional amendment. 
We are in a critical period and we do not want the economy to be 
affected." 
 
Sabah reports that British Foreign Secretary David Miliband met with 
CHP leader Deniz Baykal and MHP leader Devlet Bahceli yesterday and 
told them that closure of the AKP would have devastating results and 
a harsh reaction from the EU to the closure would be inevitable. 
 
U.S. Ambassador Comments on the AKP Closure Case 
Milliyet, Sabah, Zaman, Radikal:   Mainstream Sabah carries the 
front-page headline, "U.S. Ambassador Says, 'We Are Concerned,'" and 
notes, "The results of the AKP's closure could be serious." 
Mainstream Milliyet carried the Ambassador's comments, "We follow 
developments with interest and with some concern."  Liberal Radikal 
notes the Ambassador would not comment on the specifics of the 
closure case because he said, "That would not be appropriate for me 
to do."  Islamist-oriented Zaman notes the Ambassador drew attention 
to "Turkey's strong democratic institutions and traditions." 
 
 
 
Montreaux Treaty Rules Relaxed for Queen Elizabeth 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Vatan, Bugun, Posta, Yeni Safak:  Papers 
report that on the third day of her visit to Turkey, Queen Elizabeth 
enjoyed her tour of Istanbul.  Queen Elizabeth and her husband 
Prince Philip visited a high school in Istanbul.  Following the 
visit to the school, the Queen and Prince joined President Gul and 
his wife for a boat trip on the Bosporus.  Mainstream Milliyet notes 
that the rules of Montreaux Treaty were relaxed for the Queen so 
that the air craft carrier HMS Illustrious could enter the Bosporus. 
 The air craft carrier was allowed to enter the Turkish straits only 
after leaving its fourteen war planes in Southern Cyprus and 
disarming its helicopters, Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports. 
All papers report the Queen hosted a reception in honor of President 
Gul on the ship. 
 
Report Cites Police Brutality, Torture in Nevruz Rallies 
Liberal Radikal reports the Turkish Human Rights Foundation (TIHV) 
report was released concerning incidents in Van, Yuksekova, and 
Hakkari during Nevruz celebrations.  According to the report, police 
 
ANKARA 00000952  002 OF 003 
 
 
used "disproportionate force" while trying to contain the 
demonstrations, during which four people were killed and 249 
detained.  An eyewitness said Ikbal Yasar, who lost his life, "was 
beaten by the police even during his transfer to the hospital," 
according to the report.  The report also states some demonstrators 
were tortured while in police custody. 
 
AKP Rejects CHP Proposal to Investigate May Day Incidents 
Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report 
Turkish Parliament's Human Rights Committee has rejected a proposal 
of opposition CHP lawmakers for forming a special "sub-committee" to 
probe police brutality during May Day demonstrations in Istanbul. 
The Istanbul Governor's Office closed Taksim Square in the heart of 
Istanbul to demonstrators on May 1; police beat men and women with 
batons and kicks in order to keep them out of Taksim.  Workers were 
dispersed by police using water cannons, teargas, and truncheons. 
Police also used teargas in a children's hospital, hurting doctors 
and patients.  A reporter for Cumhuriyet daily suffered a broken arm 
after being beaten by policemen.  Papers strongly criticized the 
police behavior, saying the ruling AKP government's "mask of 
democracy" was removed. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Bush in Middle East; US Presidential 
Candidates 
 
"A Show or A Last Ditch Effort?" 
Sami Kohen commented in mainstream Milliyet (5/16):  "Some regard 
President Bush's trip to the Middle East as a farewell, while others 
see it as the White House's very last effort to resolve the 
Palestine issue.  Nevertheless, there is also a group which 
considers Bush's trip as a cosmetic show to the world that he works 
for peace in the Middle East.  Regardless of Bush's intention to 
achieve peace, his presence in the Middle East twice in five months 
is an important thing by itself.   The fact of the matter is that 
President Bush used to be criticized for not showing enough interest 
in Middle East peace, but now these visits show that he has changed 
his attitude.  However, if the goal is to find consensus between 
Israel and Palestine during his term, it is indeed too late.  The 
president's trip is happening during the worst possible conditions 
vis-`-vis achieving peace.  The Annapolis process is experiencing a 
deadlock, Palestine is divided between Gaza and the West Bank, and 
civil unrest is emerging in Lebanon under the growing influence of 
Hezbollah.  This makes the whole situation is very complex and dark. 
 Despite what President Bush hopes, there is no sign of peace by the 
end of this year. " 
 
"Turkey Should Be Prepared for Obama" 
Hakan Celik wrote in tabloid Posta (5/16):  "Unless there is a last 
minute surprise, Barack Obama will be the candidate for Democrat 
Party in the upcoming presidential elections.  Even Senator Clinton 
has started to acknowledge that she has fallen behind Obama in this 
race.  In presidential campaigns, the candidates merely focus on 
domestic issues and they do not usually touch on international 
matters.  However, the staffers in both the Democrat Party and the 
Republican Party are important figures which will end up assuming 
high level duties in the next administration.  Turkey has been in 
close contact with Senator Clinton's group, thus we have to work a 
bit harder to approach Obama's group.  So far, lobbyist groups have 
gained success for their benefit, and they even managed to have 
Barack Obama pledge recognition of the Armenian genocide.  Because 
the Jewish lobby is not as close to Turkey as it used to be, we 
should think of establishing a good relationship with the Obama 
campaign as soon as possible."
