     ¶B. ANKARA 2034 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Accoring to Turkish Foreign Ministry officials, a 
freeze on $3 million in al-Qadi assets found in Turkish bank 
accounts remains in place, although al-Qadi continues his 
legal challenge in Turkish courts of the Council of 
Ministers' freeze order (see ref b).  The Turkish Court that 
reviews administrative decisions, the Danistay (Council of 
State), has refused al-Qadi's request for an injunction 
voiding the Council of Ministers' decision.  Therefore, the 
Danistay will decide the case on its "merits."  The timeframe 
depends on the Danistay and is not clear.  The MFA has 
informed the UN 1267 committee of the status of the case and 
continues to request more information from the UN and the 
United States to bolster its case against al-Qadi.
