REF: SECSTATE 123081 
 
¶1. Ambassador delivered reftel talking points on 11/24 to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary General (SG) Dan 
Maradi, in the absence of Foreign Minister Mindaoudou (out of 
the country), and left as an aide-memoire a list of the 
one-sided resolutions (reftel, paragraph six).  With regard 
to the three committees cited in reftel, Ambassador informed 
the SG that the Government of Niger (GON) voted in favor of 
resolutions sustaining the three committees that consume 
resources and make no useful contribution to the Middle East 
peace process and the two-state solution. Ambassador then 
noted USG appreciation for the GON's movement closer to the 
USG position on a human rights related resolution on Iran 
(from "no" to abstention), its abstention on the motion to 
adjourn for a human rights related resolution on Myanmar 
(despite its inadvertent vote of "no" in the subsequent vote 
on the draft human rights resolution itself) and its 
abstention again this year on a human rights related 
resolution on DPRK.  Ambassador emphasized that in the 
absence of supporting the U.S. position on draft UN 
resolutions, that it would be helpful for the GON to abstain 
or absent itself on votes. 
 
¶2. SG Maradi responded that he recalled discussing the 
various human rights related resolutions (Iran, Myamar and 
DPRK) with the DCM (in his capacity as Acting Charge) some 
weeks ago.  He said he wasn't aware the GON had made an error 
in its vote on the second Myamar resolution, but he believed 
corrections to votes could be made within 24 hours.  (Note: 
Ambassador responded that it is unfortunate the announcement 
didn't change the official record. End note.)  With regard to 
the many resolutions criticizing Israel, the SG reminded the 
Ambassador that the GON does not have diplomatic relations 
with Israel.  He added that Niger's geography makes it 
difficult not to vote with certain neighboring countries, but 
stated he would phone the Nigerien Ambassador to the U.N. 
today (11/24) to discuss whether there is a way for Niger to 
be helpful in reducing the number of resolutions critical of 
Israel, such as through abstaining or absenting itself from 
such votes.
