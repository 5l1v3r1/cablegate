¶3.  Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Mr. Carre: 
 
On behalf of the U.S. Government, I want to thank you for 
introducing and leading the opening panel of the May 28, 2008 
Senior-Level Meeting of Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) participants in Washington DC.  Your leadership of the 
panel made an important contribution to the success of the 
meeting.  This panel was a good way for the meeting 
participants to take stock of the first five years of the 
PSI, including the views of France and several other key PSI 
partners. 
 
I believe the PSI Fifth Anniversary Senior-Level Meeting was 
very successful in reaffirming the strong commitment of the 
PSI partner states to respond to the WMD proliferation 
challenge.  It also provided the participants from 85 
countries an opportunity to strengthen communication with one 
another.  We hope this event will result in expanded 
participation in PSI activities, particularly on a regional 
basis.  The United States recognizes that France plays a 
significant role in the PSI, and we greatly appreciate your 
Government's continued efforts and contributions to advancing 
the PSI goals. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
John C. Rood 
Acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and 
International Security
