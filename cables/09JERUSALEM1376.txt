SUBJECT: EXTENDED HOURS FOR PASSENGERS, INCOMING CARGO AT 
ALLENBY BRIDGE CROSSING 
 
REF: AMMAN 1787 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The GOI implemented extended hours for 
passengers crossing the Allenby (King Hussein) Bridge for a 
two-month trial period, starting August 4.  According to 
ConGen's Palestinian contacts, the passenger crossing remains 
crowded, but operations are running smoothly on both sides. 
Cargo hours, however, were extended only for incoming 
Jordanian goods, not outgoing Palestinian shipments.  End 
summary. 
 
GOI Announces New Schedule 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On July 8, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced 
at a ministerial committee meeting that the Allenby Bridge 
crossing would be open 24/7 for cargo "to alleviate the 
situation for the Palestinian economy," according to press 
reports.  During a July 28 follow-up visit to the Allenby 
Bridge with Vice Premier Shalom and Transportation Minister 
Katz, Netanyahu instructed GOI officials to extend operating 
hours for passengers for a two-month pilot period beginning 
August 4.  Neither announcement was coordinated with the 
Jordanians (reftel); however, the Jordanian side extended 
their hours to match the new schedule. 
 
Extended Hours for Passengers Welcomed 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) ConGen's Palestinian contacts uniformly report that 
the 24-step procedure to cross between the West Bank and 
Jordan is an onerous one, involving multiple buses, waiting 
areas, and security checks that can turn the 2-hour commute 
between Jerusalem and Amman into a 16-hour ordeal.  Most 
welcomed the extended hours for passengers (0800-2400, 
Sunday-Thursday) which were implemented as scheduled on 
August 4.  They noted that the real area for improvement was 
in the treatment of Palestinians at the crossing. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following a coordination meeting with Israeli 
Customs on July 30, the Palestinian bus company that shuttles 
Palestinian passengers from Jericho to the Allenby Bridge 
added 8-9 additional buses with capacity for 30-40 passengers 
each the first day, and 12 additional buses the second day, 
with the last bus departing at 2200 from Jericho.  ConGen 
contacts report that there is now a steady stream of 
passengers throughout the day, instead of in "fits and 
starts."  While long lines remain, passengers told ConGenoff 
that they are "very happy" with the extended hours.  The new 
schedule is reportedly in effect for a two-month trial 
period, after which the GOI will reassess if demand continues 
to warrant longer hours. 
 
Extended Cargo Hours for Inbound Cargo Only 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Despite Netanyahu's July 8 announcement of extended 
cargo hours, Israeli Customs officials told ConGen contacts 
that the new hours would only be applicable for inbound cargo 
from Jordan, not outbound Palestinian goods.  Halaika, a 
Bethlehem-based stone exporter, reports that one of its 
trucks attempted to cross the afternoon of August 4, but 
Israeli Customs told the driver to return the following 
morning during regular operating hours.  The outgoing cargo 
traffic at Allenby is only about 20 loaded trucks every day 
(compared to 60 trucks per day from Jordan to the West Bank), 
and many Palestinian exporters consider the current operating 
hours to be sufficient.  The real obstacle to the flow of 
Palestinian goods, they said, was the costly back-to-back 
requirement, which forces them to hire Jordanian trucks and 
drivers to transport their goods to the final destination -- 
often as far afield as Iraq or the Gulf.
