Classified by POL External Chief David Burger for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
(C) On May 3 we delivered reftel demarche to MFA Head of 
Department for Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus Meltem 
Buyukkarakas.  She reported that Turkey shared our concerns 
about Belarus being elected to the UN Human Rights Council, 
but said it would be awkward for Turkey to vote to fill only 
one of the two spots available in the Eastern Europe slate. 
It would be easier for Turkey if another candidate could be 
identified.  She added that some weeks ago the Belarus 
embassy here had approached MFA seeking Turkey,s vote for 
the Council.  UK Embassy here informed us that MFA,s UN 
affairs staff gave a similar response.
