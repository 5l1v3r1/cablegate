¶1. (SBU) In numerous statements over the last two months, President 
Bashir has opposed the introduction of UN forces into Darfur. 
 
¶2. (U) His public comments included the following: 
 
-- June 30, 2006, Address on the Anniversary of the 1989 Coup: "We 
will not allow international troops under the UN to deploy in 
Darfur.  I prefer to be the leader of resistance in Darfur rather 
than being the president of an occupied country." 
 
-- July 13, 2006, Address for the Forum on the East: "We will not 
allow any foreign soldier to overstep his limits, and if that 
happens, such soldiers will be deported immediately out of the 
country." 
 
-- July 25, 2006, Address for the Civil Service Students' 
Graduation: "We will not hand Sudanese land to any intruder, 
assailant, or foreigner to profane Darfur's soil." 
 
-- August 5, 2006, Address for the Labor Union: "We will not accept 
the international forces, and we will not negotiate the Darfur 
issue." 
 
-- August 14, 2006, Address for the 52nd Anniversary of the Armed 
Forces: "The international forces will not be deployed in Darfur 
whether under Chapter VI or Chapter VII of the UN Charter or under 
the command of America, Britain, or the United Nations Security 
Council.  This issue is completely rejected, and we will defeat them 
the same way Hizballah defeated the Israeli army." 
 
-- August 18, 2006, Visit to Hajar al Asal township: "The enemy 
faced by resistance in Lebanon and Palestine is the same enemy Sudan 
faces in Darfur." 
 
-- August 29, 2006, Address to Union of Trade Workers: "If the 
global forces come to Sudan, their fate will be the same as of the 
Hicks Pasha, which the Sudanese annihilated during the colonial era. 
 Confrontation is better than accepting the international forces. 
We don't want another Abu Ghraib in Darfur, and we don't want our 
country to go to Guantanamo.  The country is in the front of a 
Zionist and crusader alliance, and it is enough to see the stance of 
America towards what has happened in Lebanon in the Qana massacre 
and what is happening in Iraq and Palestine today." 
 
-- August 29, 2006, Address to Vocational School Graduates: "They 
said we reject international forces because we want to conceal our 
crimes and brutality in Darfur.  We have nothing to hide.  We fought 
the rebels openly because they started the fight.  They (US and UK) 
gave themselves the right to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq.  They 
supported Israel to kill the aged and children in Palestine and 
Lebanon.  They denied our right to fight rebels [who are] fighting 
the legitimate government.  We reject the international forces 
because we will not accept new colonization." 
 
-- September 3, 2006, Briefing for Council of Ministers: "The 
resolution embodies the formation of an independent judiciary 
system, an authorized police force, a human rights protection 
mechanism, and coordination with Chad, which means the cancellation 
of national sovereignty.  At the last moment, the resolution had 
required the approval of the government, but then a change was made 
to make the government approval immaterial and just a call to agree. 
 This change encouraged the Americans to press to implement the 
resolution with or without government approval.  The resolution also 
depicts Sudan as a failing State, with neither a judiciary system 
nor a police force, which are considered the basic pillars of an 
ordinary state."
