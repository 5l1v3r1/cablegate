SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 05-1000927 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-5. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests posts' assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment end-use check on license 05-1000927 for the 
export of aircraft parts to Portugal. Posts are requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for request: Commodities are in demand by 
countries that are subject to U.S. arms embargoes and 
proscribed as end-use destinations under Section 126.1 of the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR); routing of 
commodities raises possible diversion concerns. 
 
¶4. (U) ACTION MADRID: Post should make appropriate inquiries 
to determine if foreign consignee EADS CASA both received the 
aircraft parts listed on license 05-1000927 and exported them 
to end-user the Portuguese Air Force.  If possible, post 
should obtain relevant identifying information in order to 
facilitate Embassy Lisbon's efforts to confirm ultimate 
receipt of the parts by the Portuguese Air Force. 
 
¶5. (U) ACTION LISBON: Post should make appropriate inquiries 
to determine if the end-user, the Portuguese Air Force, has 
received the aircraft parts listed on license 05-1000927 and 
that these United States Munitions List (USML) items are 
being used for the purpose stated on the license. 
 
End action.
