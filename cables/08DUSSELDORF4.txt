¶1.  (U) An Iraqi-born businessman from Essen, Aso Salih Koyie 
(47), has been charged with violating an EU arms embargo against 
Iraq through the 2004 delivery of 78 power generating sets 
formerly used by the German Army.  The trial, which opened 
before the Essen Regional Court on January 3, continued on 
January 10 with the questioning of German customs and export 
control officials, who testified that even if the goods had been 
"demilitarized" (i.e. stripped of certain components before they 
were exported), they were still subject to export restrictions 
under Germany's War Weapons Control Act. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The defendant claimed that the sets were intended for 
civilian use only, although this still required a certain amount 
of redesign, which had not yet been done. He also alleged that 
the U.S. Army in Iraq had rated the goods (which were 
transported to Iraq by truck via Turkey) as "unproblematic." 
Further court hearings in this case are scheduled for January 
¶25.  The presiding judge told us he is confident that he and his 
colleagues (another full-time judge and two lay judges) will be 
able to reach a verdict on the same day. 
 
¶3.  (U) This trial is the third illegal export case that has 
been brought before a court in North Rhine-Westphalia within the 
last year.  In December 2006, a Duesseldorf court found an 
Iranian and a British national guilty of having exported 
sensitive technology to Iran illegally (reftels).  In October 
2007, the same court acquitted three defendants who had been 
charged with having planned the delivery of used Czech fighter 
planes to Iran for lack of sufficient evidence.  According to 
media reports, Duesseldorf prosecutors plan to appeal the 
acquittal. 
 
¶4.  (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
