     ¶B. HARDIMAN 5/15 E-MAIL 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy on May 14 delivered ref A demarche regarding 
the GOU's weapon demilitarization proposal to Kateryna Bila 
of the MFA Arms Control Directorate.  Copies of the 
ATF-generated slides, which superimposed US requirements for 
complete weapons demil on the original GOU images, and of the 
NAMSA demil cost estimates (ref B) were provided to Bila to 
supplement our non-paper.  As per instructions, we also gave 
NAMSA representative Steve Brown a briefing on our position. 
Embassy will provide MFA with an informal translation of our 
non-paper for onward transmission within GOU to other 
involved Ministries (MoD, MoI.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bila indicated that MFA would share the documents 
with MoD and MoI technical experts and would provide a 
response once they had evaluated the information.  She also 
reiterated the MFA request that an ATF representative travel 
to Ukraine to allow for direct expert-to-expert discussions 
on this issue, citing the upcoming Non-Pro Working Group 
(NPWG) meeting in Kyiv (date TBD) as a good vehicle for this 
exchange.  Embassy supports the MFA request and asks that 
Department seek inclusion of an ATF representative in the US 
NPWG delegation.
