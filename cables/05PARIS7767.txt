¶1.  This is an action request:  see para. 6. 
 
¶2.  During a meeting on November 14, Dyane Dufresne- 
Klaus, Unesco's Director of Human Resources, told the 
Charge that she would like U.S. assistance in reforming 
the organization's human resource system.  She 
indicated that the current system is just not working 
and that there is currently no viable model in the UN 
system.  Dufresne-Klaus indicated particular interest 
in the merit pay system currently being adopted in 
other Federal agencies.  She also expressed interest in 
State's merit based promotion system. 
 
¶3.  Dufresne-Klaus asked if it would be possible to 
have an HR expert from the USG seconded to UNESCO for 
three to six months to work on basic HR reform.  Charge 
was non-committal but promised to forward the request. 
 
¶4.  On a separate matter, Dufresne-Klaus also asked for 
U.S. input on the terms of reference of the human 
resources review that will be carried out starting in 
January. 
 
¶5.  Finally, the Charge urged Dufresne-Klaus to change 
a P5 that is currently being recruited internally in 
the Division for Freedom of Expression, Democracy and 
Peace into an external recruitment .  She was not aware 
of the position but agreed to look into it. 
 
¶6.  Action requested:  Please let Mission know how to 
respond to the request in para. 3.
