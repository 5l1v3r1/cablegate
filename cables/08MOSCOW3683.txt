Deputy Administrator of  USDA FSIS 
Mr. Ronald K. Jones 
 
Dear Mr. Jones: 
 
Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance 
Service (VPSS) extends its regards to FSIS, USDA 
and informs you about the following. 
 
VPSS experts have carried out tests of the 
materials taken during audit conducted from 
October 24 to 29, 2008, of the U.S. meat 
processing facilities (MPF) and cold storages for 
pork, that are approved for export their products 
to the Russian Federation. The results of the 
tests indicated that 5 facilities (# 199, 1620, 
2029, 5813 and 31681) out of 10 MPF audited 
during the inspection do not comply with the 
Russian requirements. As a result, starting from 
January 1, 2009, these facilities are delisted 
from the list of approved facilities for export 
of pork and raw pork products to the Russian 
Federation. 
 
Also as the result of the audit tests, VPSS lifts 
temporary restrictions from facilities MPF #717M, 
717CR for export meat and meat products from the 
U.S to the Russian Federation. 
 
We would like to make clear that the products 
that have been produced during the period when 
the restrictions were in place, are not allowed 
for entry to the Russian Federation. 
 
 Dr. Jones, let me assure you of my highest 
esteem, 
 
Deputy Head   A.I. Saurin
