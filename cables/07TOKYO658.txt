SUBJECT: JAPAN: NO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR UN MIDDLE RING 
SECURITY AT THIS TIME 
 
REF: STATE 17022 
 
¶1. (SBU) Japan is not in a position at this time to make 
additional contributions to the Distinct Entity Trust Fund 
for UN middle ring security, MOFA Deputy Director for Second 
Middle East Division Masaki Yasumatsu told Embassy Tokyo 
Political Officer February 14.  According to Yasumatsu, Japan 
greatly appreciates the critical role the United Nations 
plays in Iraq, and is also grateful for the fact that the 
United States is seeking to solicit financial support to 
provide continued security for this effort.  However, he 
pointed out, Japan contributed over one third of the original 
fund, its Air Self Defense Forces are providing airlift for 
UNAMI, it has deployed Ground Self Defense Forces in Iraq, 
and it has made over 5 billion USD in financial assistance 
available to Iraq for reconstruction assistance.  Most 
recently, a budget supplemental of 100 million USD was passed 
to enable Japan to channel additional aid to Iraq through UN 
organizations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Yasumatsu questioned why the UN requires a distinct 
budget entity to fund security and why steps were not taken 
earlier to replenish the fund.  He said he understands it was 
impossible to discuss funding until the UNSCR enabling 
continued UN presence in Iraq was passed, but observed that 
if steps had been taken earlier, Tokyo might have been able 
to take the need for such funds into consideration in its 
budget cycle and a contribution might have been possible.  As 
things stand now, Tokyo is not in a position to make 
additional contributions at this time.
