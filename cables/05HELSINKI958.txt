¶1. On Sept. 1, the Embassy received general offers of 
assistance from the GOF in support of the victims of 
Hurricane Katrina (ref B).  Following up, Charge spoke 
several times over the weekend with senior officials from the 
PM's office and the MFA.  Based on Charge's requests, Finland 
committed to providing an as-yet undetermined cash donation, 
the amount of which will be communicated to us this week.  In 
all likelihood, the Finnish government's response will be 
channeled through the the Finnish Red Cross to the American 
Red Cross, in response to the latter's appeal for funds to 
arrange temporary housing.  Separately, a 3-person logistics 
and management team from the Finnish Red Cross arrived in the 
U.S. on Sept. 2, in response to a request from the American 
Red Cross and the IFRC.  (We also understand from press 
reports that Finnish telecom giant Nokia plans to donate $1 
million to the American Red Cross.) 
 
¶2.  On Sept. 1, the Ambassador received the following letter 
from Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja confirming Finland's 
willingness to assist:
