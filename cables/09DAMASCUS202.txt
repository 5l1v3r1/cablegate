SUBJECT: NEW LEBANESE EMBASSY PERCHED ABOVE OUR COMPOUND 
 
¶1. (SBU) The March 15 placement of a sign embossed with a 
cedar tree and Arabic lettering denoting the "Embassy of the 
Republic of Lebanon" paved the way for the official opening 
of Lebanon's "temporary" embassy on Monday, March 16.  RSO 
locally employed staff (LES) learned the Lebanese Charg 
d,Affaires will be participating in a brief press event at 
an noon outside the Lebanese Embassy's temporary chancery. 
This office space, formerly held by the Lebanon/Syria liaison 
office, is housed in a building that essentially sits on our 
compound, directly above our GSO offices on Ata al-Ayoubi 
Street.  We understand a permanent embassy will be built in 
the neighborhood but have no information on a specific 
location. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to local security contacts, pending 
security enhancements to the temporary embassy include 
permanent installation of a Police booth (currently, there is 
a working-hours police post established at our request) and 
possible construction of an entrance gate to the building's 
street entrance.  Both features will serve to enhance the 
security of our own compound.  Though it is to early to say 
whether those enhancements will offset the addition of a new 
potential yet separate target to our cramped and inadequate 
facility.  Syria's Political Security service is reportedly 
providing a temporary protective detail to the Lebanese 
Charg.  Needless to say, we look forward to welcoming the 
Lebanese diplomatic corps to the neighborhood.
