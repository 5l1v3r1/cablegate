SUBJECT: SANTA CRUZ MINISTERIAL ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
DEMARCHE:  CANADA PRESENTS FORMAL COMMENTS 
 
REF: A. STATE 191887 
 
     ¶B. OTTAWA 3503 
 
¶1. (U)  This afternoon the Economic Minister received a 
formal Canadian response to the demarche he delivered to 
Canadian officials on the Santa Cruz Ministerial on November 
30 (ref B).  The reply was sent by Jenna MacKay-Alie, 
Director General, Americas Directorate, Environment Canada. 
 
¶2. (U)  Begin text:  Canadian Response to United States 
Demarche on the Inter-American Ministerial on Sustainable 
Development (December 4-5, Bolivia) 
 
Canada believes that a Declaration is important for the 
success of the Inter-American Ministerial on Sustainable 
Development.  A Declaration would provide policy guidance on 
sustainable development in the Americas and would contribute 
to preparations for the 2009 Summit of the Americas.  Canada 
supports a Declaration which represents the consensus of OAS 
Member States. 
 
Canada acknowledges the significant effort that OAS Member 
States have contributed to drafting the Declaration. 
Further, throughout the drafting of the Declaration we have 
strived to promote common ground among the different views of 
Member States.  However, cognizant of the limited time 
remaining to complete the Declaration, Canada welcomes the 
initiative by the United States and agrees that a 
streamlined, focused Declaration would be preferable and 
achievable. 
 
In the event that climate change language is necessary to 
achieve consensus, Canada suggests grouping climate change 
statements into one paragraph that reaffirms items from the 
UNFCCC agenda of particular interest to OAS Member States. 
While the UNFCCC is the appropriate forum for discussion of 
international measures to address climate change, the OAS can 
lend support to these measures. 
 
Canada will continue to work to achieve a consensus 
Declaration.  In support of this objective, we do not favor 
the introduction of new additional text proposals at this 
late stage.  Our intention is to advocate the closing of the 
Declaration at the end of the Working Group on December 3rd. 
 
We look forward to working with the United States to achieve 
a successful outcome in Santa Cruz.  End text.
