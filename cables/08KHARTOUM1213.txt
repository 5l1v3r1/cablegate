SUBJECT: LRA LEADER KONY CONTACTS CHISSANO 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to United Nations Mission In Sudan (UNMIS), a 
representative of Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony 
has been in telephone contact with United Nations Special Envoy 
Joaquim Chissano and allegedly communicated that Kony will sign a 
peace agreement on August 15, 2008 at Rikwamgba in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo.  Chissano was also told that LRA members were in 
dire need of food and medicine.  UN sources do not believe, however, 
that the signing of the peace agreement is contingent on receiving 
these items.  UN officials are skeptical that the peace agreement 
will be signed (or that the meeting will even occur,) yet are still 
treating this communication as a legitimate effort. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Kony has been in communication with UNMIS and GOSS 
Vice President Machar by phone for the last several weeks, and this 
is the latest in a series of proposed meetings.  While we hope that 
Kony will finally show, we will believe it when we see it.  There 
are consistent reports, however, that the LRA is desperately short 
of food and supplies, which gives some little hope that maybe this 
time Kony will come out of the woods.
