SUBJECT: Liu Yubu Named New Shenzhen Party Secretary 
 
 
(U) THIS DOCUMENT IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  IT SHOULD NOT BE 
DISSEMINATED OUTSIDE U.S. GOVERNMENT CHANNELS OR IN ANY PUBLIC FORUM 
WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONCURRENCE OF THE ORIGINATOR.  IT SHOULD NOT BE 
POSTED ON THE INTERNET. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Former Guangdong Deputy Party Secretary Liu Yubu was 
appointed Shenzhen Party Secretary January 2, according to official 
news reports.  Though the assignment is not a promotion for Liu -- 
both positions carry equivalent rank -- his installation as a 
long-time colleague of Hu Jintao in a position held in recent years 
by those sympathetic to Jiang Zemin could signal Hu's expanding 
political influence here in south China. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Unless Liu makes the jump to Politburo member in the next 
few years, regulations requiring retirement from Party leadership at 
age 65 will make the Shenzhen assignment his last.  A local 
journalist who follows south-China politics told us he was surprised 
by Liu's appointment, noting that Liu's previous work has all been 
at the provincial or national level -- he has never before been 
responsible for an entire municipality.

Province, and joined the Communist Party in 1971.  After studying 
electric metallurgy at the Steel Metallurgical Department of the

¶4. (U) Liu's political rise began with his selection as a member of 
the Standing Committee of the Communist Youth League Central 
Committee and as the Secretary of the Central Agencies Committee of 
the Central Communist Youth League from 1982 to 1986.  During this 
period Liu developed a relationship with Hu Jintao, who also served 
on the CYL Central Committee.  After a brief stint at the Central 
Party School (August 1985-Januarary 1986), Liu worked first as a 
member, then as director of the Office of the Central Agencies Work 
Committee (1986-1995). 
 
¶5. (U) From 1995 to 2000, Liu served in government and Party 
positions in Shaanxi Province, including as Vice Governor, 
Director-General of the Provincial Planning Commission, and member 
of the Shaanxi Communist Party Standing Committee.  He was then 
transferred to Guangdong Province, where he was a member of the 
provincial Standing Committee and Director-General of the 
Organizational Department of the provincial Party committee 
(2000-2004).  From 2004 to 2008 Liu served as the Guangdong Party 
Committee's Deputy Party Secretary and as President of the Guangdong 
Party School, where he was also Secretary of Politics and Laws.
