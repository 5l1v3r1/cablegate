REF: SECSTATE 62909 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D)
1.(S) Ambassador conveyed objectives in reftel to Egyptian FM Aboul Gheit June 18, noting that we were following up his recommendation that the US reach out to AL capitals in advance of the June 24 Follow Up committee. She said the goal was to urge member states to come prepared to help create an atmosphere that would facilitate the relaunching of negotiations. He listened carefully and cautioned that the U.S. couch references to Arab actions and gestures in a manner that makes clear we understand any such action would be reciprocal.

2.(S) The Ambassador drew Aboul Gheit's attention to the positive elements of the Netanyahu speech that had apparently been overlooked by the Arabs: negotiations without preconditions, acceptance of previous commitments, and acceptance of a future Palestinian state. Aboul Gheit observed that Netanyahu had placed conditions on the negotiations; Ambassador countered that we did not hear preconditions that had to be met before negotiations could resume. As a result of the speech the U.S. sees that both sides are now committed to a common objective: a two state solution and comprehensive peace. Aboul Gheit promised to reread the text of Netanyahu's speech. SCOBEY
