SUBJECT: PENDING TELEPHONE NUMBER CHANGES FOR AMEMBASSY MANAGUA
 
¶1.  AmEmbassy Managua has been notified by Nicaraguan post and 
telecommunications (ENITEL) that effective April 1, 2009, 
dialing procedures for Nicaragua will change. 
 
¶2.  ENITEL will affix a "2" to the beginning of landline phone 
numbers and an "8" to the beginning of cell phone numbers. 
This change will affect all incoming telephone calls for the 
country of Nicaragua. 
 
Due to a national system change, dialing Embassy Managua from 
the United States, via commercial landline, will be: 
 
Embassy 011 505 2 252-7100 
Embassy fax - 011 505 2 252-7300 
 
¶3.  Following implementation of these changes, local callers, 
plus incoming international callers dialing into Nicaragua, 
will hear a recorded message (in Spanish) stating that the 
numbers have changed.  Please note this is just an advisory 
message and the call will not automatically be forwarded to 
the new number.  The caller must hang up and redial the 
correct number. 
 
¶4.  IVG prefix remains 746. 
 
¶5.  Post profiles, found on the Department's intranet site, as 
well as the respective intranet homepage for the mission, will 
be updated accordingly. 
 
¶6.  Minimize considered.
