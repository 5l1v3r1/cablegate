 On May 06, Econoff delivered reftel points to both Pablo 
Montesino, Subdirector General of Air, Land and Sea 
Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and to 
Eugenia Llorens, Subdirector General of International 
Cooperation at the Civil Aviation Ministry.  Montesino 
replied to Econoff on June 01, stating that Spain would 
likely support the imposition of two-year term limits on the 
positions of Secretary General and Council President.  In 
addition, Montesino said that the GOS would also likely 
support changes that would provide the Secretary General with 
greater competency in regard to management of the 
Secretariat.  Finally, Montesino said that Spain has not yet 
 
SIPDIS 
formulated a position in regard to candidates for the 
position of Secretary General.  However, Montesino did say 
that the GOS would consider supporting a candidate from Latin 
America, with Mexico being named specifically, or Europe, 
should one be presented. (Comment: The GOS does not seem to 
have established a strong position in regard to these issues 
at this early stage.  Econoff does not believe that Spain 
will vigorously support the re-election of Dr Cherif, but 
they are also unlikely to strongly oppose him.  Econoff 
believes that Spain's position will develop over the next 
year and that a more accurate gauge of GOS views can be 
obtained closer to the election date.  End Comment)
