REF: TOKYO 1552 
 
Sensitive but unclassified - not for internet distribution. 
 
¶1. (U) The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) 
signed a loan agreement June 16 with the Sakhalin Energy 
Investment Company Ltd. to provide up to $3.7 billion in 
financing for the second phase of the Sakhalin 2 natural gas 
project according to a JBIC press release.  A syndicate of 
private sources will provide an additional $1.6 billion, 
bringing total financing for the project to $5.3 billion. 
 
¶2. (U) Sakhalin 2, in which Mitsui & Company Ltd, Mitsubishi 
Corporation, Shell Oil and Russia's state-owned Gazprom have 
equity shares, is expected to yield 9.6 million tons of 
liquid natural gas (LNG) annually.  More than 50% of this 
amount will be delivered to Japan, accounting for 8% of the 
country's total LNG imports.  In addition, according to the 
press release, Japan will receive a "substantial percentage" 
of the 150,000 barrels of crude oil per day pumped from the 
project.  The loan will be used to construct a marine 
platform, oil and gas pipelines and an LNG plant. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment. Japan imports nearly 80% of its energy 
needs and energy security is a long-standing and high-profile 
issue.  The JBIC financing of Sakhalin 2 is part of the 
long-term energy strategy the GOJ announced in 2006 to reduce 
Japan's overwhelming exposure to global energy markets by 
pursuing ownership of overseas projects.  Despite numerous 
delays, cost overruns and environmental challenges, Sakhalin 
2 will help Japan lock-in a steady supply of LNG and, to a 
lesser extent, crude oil.
