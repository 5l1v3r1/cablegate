SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.   Most Argentine reporting on the ten U.S. citizens arrested on 
charges of child trafficking in Haiti was objective. Several cited 
the State Department spokesperson's remarks that the U.S. is 
offering assistance aimed at ensuring a fair and transparent trial, 
noting that the ten Americans have "unlimited consular support." 
The notable exception was left-of-center, pro-government P????gina 
12, 
which questioned whether the trial would be free from U.S. 
influence.  P????gina 12 also reprinted an article claiming that the 
TPS (Temporary Protected Status) is not enough for Haitians, urging 
the U.S. to allow compassionate entry.  Two dailies picked up 
opinion articles written in the U.S. urging more U.S. financial aid 
to Haiti and a reforestation program.  End summary. 
 
 
 
"U.S. 'MONITORS' SITUATION OF 
 
AMERICANS ARRESTED IN HAITI" 
 
--------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.   Most Argentine reporting on the ten U.S. citizens arrested on 
charges of child trafficking was objective. Centrist Cr????tica de la 
Argentina and left-of-center, pro-government P????gina 12 picked up a 
factual report printed by the state-owned T????lam wire service 
agency, quoting the State Department's spokesperson Philip Crowley 
as saying the U.S. offered assistance to the Americans in order to 
ensure thQ have a fair and transparent trial.  Both papers note 
that the U.S. is "monitoring" the situation, although the case 
remains in the hands of Haitian authorities.

¶3.   Second largest daily La Naci????n published a news release from 
the Associated Press (AP) and Spanish news agency EFE describing 
the "vulnerability of children" and the large number of orphans in 
Haiti.  The article also noted the ten Americans arrested in Haiti 
for child trafficking and the conflicting reports over whether the 
children are orphans.

"AN ACCUSATION PRESSURED 
 
BY THE EMPIRE" 
 
------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶4.   Pro-government P????gina 12 ironically headlines "An accusation 
pressured by the Empire," with the subheadline "Although there is 
no discussion that the local judiciary will be in charge of the 
lawsuit, some insinuated the trial could take place in the U.S." 
Whereas the headlines imply that the trial will not be free from 
U.S. ("the Empire") influence, the underlying article is factual 
and objective. 
 
 
 
TPS NOT ENOUGH 
 
-------------- 
 
 
 
¶5.   P????gina 12 reprinted an article from La Jornada de Mexico 
written by Amy Goodman, who argued that the TPS (Temporary 
Protected Status) is not enough and urged the U.S. to immediately 
authorize the legal and compassionate entry of Haitians.  Goodman 
stresses that the U.S. should authorize the entry of 70,000 
Haitians whose applications have been approved but are still on a 
waiting list, and that they could wait for several more years to 
move to the U.S.   Goodman observed that National Nurses United, 
the largest nurses' union in the U.S. with 12,000 registered 
members who are willing to travel to Haiti, claimed they cannot 
obtain help from the Obama administration.

URGING INCREASED U.S. 
 
FINANCIAL AID AND REFORESTATION 
 
------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶6.   Two local dailies picked up opinion articles printed in U.S. 
media.  Business-financial El Cronista published an opinion article 
by Alejandro Tagliavini, a member of the Advisory Council of the 
Center on Global Prosperity, from Oakland, California, who claimed 
the U.S. could grant more financial aid to Haiti, since it has 
spent USD 6 billion on Sudan, "the worst dictatorship in the 
world."  La Naci????n printed an opinion article by Andr????s 
Oppenheimer, from The Miami Herald, stating that Haiti needs to not 
only rebuild its buildings and urban infrastructure, but also 
create a reforestation program.
