REF: STATE 112229 
 
(SBU)  On October 27 ESToff delivered reftel non-paper 
regarding Iran's upcoming international conference on nuclear 
energy, the environment and sustainable development to MFA 
Head of the Iranian Desk Maxim A. Baranov.  An experienced 
regional expert on Iran and Afghanistan, Baranov remarked 
that he had heard nothing about this conference, but that he 
would report the information to his superiors.  He commented 
that as no one had been invited, he could not say what 
influence the GOR might have on any potential attendee. 
Baranov said that based on his years living in Tehran as a 
Russian commercial expert and diplomat, he was not surprised 
that the Iranians would hold such a conference.  "The 
Iranians love conferences" he said.  He indicated that often, 
these conferences are arranged by universities as a mechanism 
for the more advanced students to organize and manage such 
events, not necessarily for what actually comes out of the 
conference itself.
