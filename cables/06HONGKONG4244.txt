REF: A) USDOC 05073 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), conducted 
a pre-license check at Ka Shui Manufactory Co. Ltd., 3/F EW 
International Tower 120 Texaco Road, Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong (Ka Shui). 
The purpose of the visit was to determine the suitability of Ka Shui 
to be a recipient of a nanoform 00 two-axis CNC contouring machine 
that is the subject of export license application D363135.  The item 
(ECCN 2B001) is valued at USD $237,000 and is controlled for nuclear 
nonproliferation (NP) reasons. The license applicant is Precitech, 
Inc. of Keene, New Hampshire (Precitech). 
 
¶3. On August 25, 2006, the ECO visited Ka Shui at the address above 
and met with Norman Chan, Director of Sales and Marketing and Olivia 
Chan from Ka Shui's purchasing department.  Ka Shui is a well-known 
die casting company in Hong Kong and has been in operation since 
1980 (see further information at www.kashui.com).  The corporate 
headquarters are located in Hong Kong although production for 
various Ka Shui products presently occurs at two locations in China. 
 The company makes a range of products including the casings for the 
IBM Thinkpad laptop computer and the exterior shell of various types 
of cell phones. 
 
¶4.  According to Mr. Chan, the contouring machine would be used to 
make lenses, principally for cell phones.  Mr. Chan explained that 
Ka Shui customers have indicated that they would like components 
suppliers like Ka Shui to produce a greater proportion of the final 
product.  The contouring machine would allow Ka Shui would satisfy 
this need of existing and prospective customers by, for example, 
using the machine to create lenses that Ka Shui could incorporate 
into the exterior shells of cell phones. 
 
¶5. The actual production of the lenses is set to occur in Hong Kong 
at a facility owned by Ka Shui that is not presently being used.  At 
the request of the ECO, Mr. Chan took the ECO to the proposed 
production site, which turned out to be former offices of Ka Shui. 
The proposed production site is located in an industrial building 
near to Ka Shui's corporate headquarters.  The site included Ka Shui 
logos on the door and walls but was clearly not presently in use. 
Mr. Chan stated that once he has a clearer idea when Ka Shui will 
obtain the machine, he will prepare the location for use in 
production of lenses (the space was modest -perhaps 500-1000 square 
feet). 
 
¶6.  Mr. Chan stressed that he understood well the requirement that 
the machine remain in Hong Kong and offered to allow the ECO to 
conduct a site visit after the machine had been delivered. 
 
¶7. At the time visited, Ka Shui appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the subject controlled items since it cooperated fully with the 
PLC and provided substantial information on Ka Shui's proposed use 
of the item in Hong Kong.  In addition, Ka Shui operates a line a 
business that is consistent with the potential use of the ordered 
item.  The ECO recommends that this PLC be classified as Favorable.
