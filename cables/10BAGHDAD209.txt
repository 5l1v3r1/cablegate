     ¶B. BAGHDAD 2381 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Deputy Minister of Environment Kamal Latif Hussein 
marked the completion of a humanitarian landmine clearance 
project in Baghdad's "Army Canal" January 23 with leaders of 
the Iraq Mine and UXO Clearance Organization (IMCO), an Iraqi 
NGO and U.S.-grantee.  National television networks covered 
the event and, taking cues from IMCO and Deputy MinEnv, 
hailed the release of the cleared land as a successful 
example of public-private partnership that would "save 
children's lives" as well as draw investors to the area. 
IMCO assisted the Iraqi Army with the project and continues 
operations at three other sites.  PM/WRA helped create IMCO 
in 1993 and has since supported it and a handful of other 
mine action organizations in Iraq. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Today, IMCO is conducting demining operations under 
the direction of the MOEnv's Directorate of Mine Action 
(DMA), which exercises full legal authority.  The change has 
been dramatic: IMCO, only six months ago, faced legal action 
to jail its director, Zahim Mutar.  Furthermore, an Iraqi 
injunction on demining activity had barred IMCO and other 
humanitarian as well as commercial organizations from 
conducting demining operations (ref B).  This month, however, 
demining resumed in earnest, and the GOI has publicly 
embraced IMCO.  Topping it off, the media trumpeted IMCO's 
"civil society" leadership as a boon to both the Iraqi 
people's safety and the country's economic development. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT: In terms of the Embassy's and PM/WRA's 
goals, this public ceremony also marked the completion of the 
180-degree turn-around that we set for mine action in Iraq 
(ref A).  When Post reported on the resolution of the 
demining ban and on IMCO's approval to operate, we noted that 
the final benchmark of progress would be met when IMCO once 
again was able to remove landmines or unexploded ordnance 
(UXO) in the course of a humanitarian project, which it now 
has done.  END COMMENT.
