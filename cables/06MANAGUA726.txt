The International Organizations Section of the Ministry of 
Foreign Relations of the Republic of Nicaragua presents its 
compliments to the Honorable Embassy of the United States of 
America and takes the opportunity to inform the Honorable 
Embassy that the Government of Nicaragua has decided to 
present the candidacy of Doctor Alejandro Montiel Arguello to 
be a member of the International Law Commission, for the 
period 2007-20011.  Elections to the Commission will take 
place during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly 
of the United Nations in New York in September 2006. 
 
Doctor Montiel Arguello, whose resume is attached, is the 
former Minister of Foreign Relations of the Republic of 
Nicaragua (1957-1961 and 1972-1978), and is a prominent 
lawyer with over six decades of experience in legal and 
political matters that has given him a deep understanding of 
international law. 
 
Additionally, on the hemispheric level, Doctor Montiel has 
been a member of the Inter-American Judicial Committee 
(1970-1972) and a judge on the Inter-American Human Rights 
Court (1991-1997), experience that, along with his extensive 
qualifications, would be useful in the International Law 
Commission to promote knowledge of Latin American legal and 
judicial norms as they relate to matters of international law. 
 
Nicaragua places great importance in the laudable work of the 
Commission in the development and codification of 
international law in the United Nations.  Because of this, 
and taking into account the wide experience of Doctor Montiel 
Arguello, it expects that if the Nicaraguan candidate is 
elected, he will contribute to the strengthening of the rule 
of law in international relations. 
 
Taking into account the close ties of friendship between the 
illustrious Government of the United States and the 
Government of Nicaragua, we ask for your valuable support for 
the Nicaraguan candidate. 
 
The International Organizations Section of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua takes the 
opportunity to assure the Honorable Embassy of the United 
States of America of its highest consideration.
