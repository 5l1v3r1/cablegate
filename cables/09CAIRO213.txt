¶1.  (U) Cairo is abuzz with talk of a serious investment fraud 
allegation.  Earlier this week, businessman Nabil Al-Boushi was 
charged with: (i) operating as a stockbroker without the authority 
to do portfolio management and (ii) breaking contractual 
obligations.  The Egyptian Public Prosecutor (Attorney General) has 
ordered the freezing of his holdings.  Al-Boushi is currently 
reported to be in Dubai where he has been arrested for similar 
crimes and the Public Prosecutor has requested Al-Boushi's return 
from Dubai.  It is reported that he is also being investigated for 
money laundering. 
 
¶2.  (U) Forty-eight Egyptians filed claims to the Public 
Prosecutor's Office against Al-Boushi for defrauding them of their 
investments.  Estimates range on the amount he allegedly stole, 
between $37 - $200 million.  Al-Boushy used his brokerage company, 
Global Optima, as a venue for taking investments in securities.  He 
signed contracts with clients obliging him to pay at least 30% 
annual interest plus a commitment to return principal at any time 
upon the depositor's request.  According to press reports, he 
started his activities in Egypt in 2003 and started his Dubai 
operation in 2005.  He was apparently paying interest regularly to 
depositors until 2006, but then refused to provide clients' 
principal at their request, noting that the funds were invested 
overseas and would lose much if they were withdrawn. In December 
2008, he reportedly sent correspondence to his clients showing 
earnings amounts, and all accounts were deemed profitable.  It was 
shortly after that that he disappeared and concerned clients alerted 
the authorities.  He was arrested in Dubai recently for taking $34 
million from four Emiratis for investment, and also for issuing four 
checks worth $13 million without adequate balance. 
 
¶3.  (U) As this story broke in Cairo, the Egyptian stock market 
slumped a total of 6% on February 2 and February 3, and market 
participants cited the scandal as one of the main contributors to 
the fall.  According to Sherif Henry, a large informal portfolio 
manager, individuals who invested their money with informal 
portfolio managers like Al-Boushi began showing nervousness and 
there was a wide selling spree as individuals sought to be sure that 
their funds still existed.  Of the 48 individuals who filed cases 
against Al-Boushi, there are actors, sports stars, relatives of high 
officials, and leading businessmen.  The Egyptian Stock Exchange has 
been performing poorly so far this year, continuing its poor 
performance since May 2008.  The index has lost 65% in the past 12 
months. 
 
¶4.  (U) COMMENT: Cases of fraudulent money managers are increasingly 
common in Egypt, not only in Cairo, but in other parts of the 
country as well.  Analysts link this to Egyptians' desire for quick 
money in the face of higher inflation.  As middle income individuals 
see the wealthy getting richer, there is a desire to quickly narrow 
the gap, leading many to make bad or risky investment decisions.
