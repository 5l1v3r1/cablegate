SUBJECT: CODEL BIDEN MEETS WITH FM BABACAN 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  CODEL Biden discussed with Turkish FM Babacan 
ongoing U.S.-Turkey cooperation and efforts to promote stability in 
the region, notably in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, during a 
February 22 meeting.  Babacan described the EU accession process as 
integral to Turkey's ongoing democratic transformation.  He said 
Turkey will continue its efforts to promote stability in Afghanistan 
and Pakistan, namely through humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan 
and by continuing the trilateral summit process, probably in April. 
He underscored Turkey's support for a prosperous, stable and 
multicultural Iraq, secure in its borders, looked toward progress on 
Cyprus and Armenia in 2008, and said Turkey's approach on the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate should be seen in the context of efforts to 
expand religious freedom in the country.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TRANSFORMING TURKEY 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Babacan welcomed CODEL Biden and emphasized the broad 
scope of U.S.-Turkey cooperation.  Turkey embraces U.S. values of 
democracy, rule of law, pluralism and multiculturalism.  The EU 
accession process is key to Turkey's future; it's not about one more 
EU member, but about transforming Turkey and the EU.  Such a Turkey 
will negate arguments that Islam, democracy and secularism cannot 
coexist.  From Morocco to Indonesia, Babacan said, the Muslim world 
is following Turkish reform efforts, thus contributing to democracy 
in the region. 
 
STABILIZING PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Senators Biden, Kerry and Hagel briefly described their 
visit days earlier to Pakistan and Afghanistan.  They praised 
Turkey's effort to bring together Presidents Karzai and Musharraf, 
as well as President Gul's pre-election engagement with Pakistan's 
opposition and Turkey's contributions to NATO/ISAF. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Babacan reviewed Turkey's help to win hearts and minds in 
Afghanistan.  He cited the PRT in Wardak.  Turkey has built 24 
schools -- now transferred to Afghan authorities -- and Turkish NGOs 
continue to operate six or seven other schools.  Over 40,000 
students have benefited from these schools.  Turkey has also 
invested in health care facilities.  Afghan perceptions of a foreign 
occupation create a fertile ground for terrorists; Turkey thinks 
more should be done on the development side, Babacan maintained. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Turkey plans to bring Presidents Karzai and Musharraf 
together again in Turkey, probably April 8, according to Babacan. 
President Karzai has agreed; confirmation from the Pakistan side is 
pending.  Babacan said he had been the one to ask President Gul to 
visit Pakistan, and Gul's messages to all political parties there 
were clear:  do not damage the stability of the country and 
participate in the political process.  Bhutto's assassination had 
changed the mood, but Turkey will continue to do what it can to 
ensure Pakistan's stability.  Babacan noted his recent visit to 
India, and said he found New Delhi also focused on Pakistan's 
stability.  FM Babacan said he and his Indian counterparts had 
agreed to remain in closer touch on the situation in both Pakistan 
and Afghanistan. 
 
SUCCEEDING IN IRAQ 
------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Senator Kerry solicited Babacan's views on Iraq. 
Referring to Turkey's just-announced, limited incursion in northern 
Iraq against the PKK, Kerry urged Babacan to keep the Iraqi 
government in the loop and not complicate what we are trying to get 
done there.  Babacan said Turkey is mindful of the concern Senator 
Kerry noted.  He described Iraq as a neighbor and brother.  Turks 
share ethnicity with the Iraqi people and care deeply about the 
country's stability and prosperity.  Turkey has channels to every 
Iraqi group, without discrimination.  It supports a multicultural 
Iraq, secure in its borders. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Asked by Senator Kerry where we are in the process of 
reaching that objective, FM Babacan said the situation there is 
better than a year ago.  The surge has helped, as have efforts to 
engage Sunni groups in the Iraqi government and parliament.  More 
local ownership of Iraq's future is the key.  FM Babacan appealed 
for more predictability in the future U.S.-Iraq relationship. The 
strategic framework agreement to be negotiated between the USG and 
GOI is crucial.  Predictability will lead the Iraqi people to 
support the central government.  Babacan also noted progress

reflected in recent laws passed by the Iraqi Parliament.  He noted 
Turkey's role in promoting the Iraq neighbors process.  The 
comprehensive communique issued at the Istanbul ministerial 
reflected international consensus on the future of Iraq.  He said 
the future status of Kirkuk is important and requires consensus from 
all sides.  Turkey supports a special status for Kirkuk.   If there 
is a referendum, we should be clear what it is about, who will vote, 
and what size majority will be acceptable. 
 
OPPORUNTITIES FOR PROGRESS ON CYPRUS AND ARMENIA 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) While emphasizing a shared approach on many issues, 
Senator Biden pointed out two "irritants" in the relationship: 
Cyprus and the Ecumenical Patriarchate.  While not defining issues 
in U.S.-Turkish relations, there is an inconsistency between 
Turkey's current, positive direction and the continued obstacles 
faced by the Patriarchate, such as the closure of the Halki 
Seminary.  Senator Kerry opined that it is time to get something 
done on Cyprus and asked for FM Babacan's views.  Senator Biden 
described as "historic" President Gul's congratulatory message to 
Armenian President-elect Sargsyan. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) FM Babacan said the biggest obstacle to progress on Cyprus 
was Papadopoulos.  Sincere willingness on all sides to make progress 
is the key.  He observed that the status quo has suited the Greek 
Cypriots.  Nominally representing the whole island, the Greek 
Cypriot government has enjoyed a monopoly on EU funds, 
representation in the European Parliament, trade and tourism. 
Meanwhile, the Turkish Cypriots are isolated.  Turkey would like to 
see more international pressure on Cyprus to solve the problem, 
through a comprehensive -- not piecemeal -- solution, based on the 
existing UN parameters.  On Armenia, FM Babacan reiterated the GOT's 
offer to convene a historical commission to look at the shared 
histories of Turks and Armenians.  Quoting Israeli President Shimon 
Peres, he said politicians should look to the future and historians 
to the past.  Turkey has opened its archives, but this has not been 
reciprocated by Yerevan or by Armenian diaspora groups.  However, 
the Greek, Cypriot, Armenian and Turkish governments have all fresh 
mandates, making 2008 a year of possibility to work toward 
solutions. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) FM Babacan identified the Patriarchate issue as part of 
Turkey's trend toward religious freedom -- evidenced by the 
headscarf reform.  He said the GOT wants to see European and 
American freedoms in Turkey.  It is a process, but Turkey recognizes 
its responsibility.  What Turkey does, he said, has an impact 
throughout the region, and even globally. 
 
¶11.  (U) CODEL Biden has cleared this message.
