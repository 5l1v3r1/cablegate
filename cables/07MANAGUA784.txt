SUBJECT: CENTAM CHIEFS OF MISSION BEWILDERED BY ORTEGA'S 
"DOUBLE DISCOURSE" 
 
REF: MANAGUA 0140 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Central American COMs in Nicaragua agree that 
the Ortega administration is pursuing a "double discourse" in 
foreign and economic policy, which makes predicting a future 
trajectory difficult.  They have also been perturbed by 
protocol irregularities, including a delay in the 
accreditation of the new ambassador from Costa Rica. 
Nevertheless, Costa Rica in particular is prepared to assist 
Nicaragua if the administration proves that it is serious 
about development and poverty reduction.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Ambassador Trivelli hosted a second breakfast for a 
group of Central American COMs on March 22 to discuss 
developments in the progress of President Daniel Ortega's 
administration.  The following Chiefs of Mission attended the 
breakfast: 
 
- Costa Rica: Antonio Tacsan Lam 
- El Salvador: Jose Roberto Lasala (Charge) 
- Honduras: Jorge Milla 
- Guatemala: Jorge Echeverria 
- Panama: Miguel Lecaro 
 
¶3. (C) The ambassadors admitted that they are confused by and 
skeptical over the Ortega administration's often conflicting 
messages and signals.  For example, President Ortega hosts 
Hugo Chavez and lambastes the U.S. while Foreign Minister 
Samuel Santos exalts a "positive, respectful, and healthy" 
relationship with the same country.  In the case of Honduras, 
Ortega spoke of Central American brotherhood privately with 
President Zelaya, but now attacks Honduras regularly over 
border disputes and military procurements.  The ambassadors 
concurred that Ortega is merely paying lip service to 
regional integration.  Guatemalan Ambassador Echeverria 
mentioned that Ortega has sent lower-ranking officials or 
abstained from recent summits on Central American 
integration, despite official declarations supporting the 
project. 
 
¶4. (C) Several of the Ambassadors reported that the Foreign 
Ministry is often woefully ignorant of Presidential 
activities and noted protocol irregularities committed by the 
government.  Costa Rican Ambassador Antonio Tacsan Lam, who 
has been present in Nicaragua for two months, has yet to 
receive his accreditation.  (Note: Tacsan Lam indicated that 
Costa Rica was quietly holding back on accreditation on 
Nicaragua's new ambassador in San Jose until the issue is 
resolved.  End Note.)  In contrast, the Cuban and Libyan 
ambassadors were in country for less than a week before being 
accredited.  Both the Panamanian and Guatemalan ambassadors 
have received "confidential" requests for agrement for the 
new ambassadors that Nicaragua is proposing to send to their 
countries -- and these "secret" designates have shown up on 
their doorsteps seeking advice on their new posts. 
 
¶5. (C) Ambassador Tacsan Lam commented that Ortega is "a 
reality that we must live with," and that Costa Rica is 
prepared to assist Nicaragua if Ortega is "truly interested 
in development."  According to Tacsan Lam, improving primary 
education is key to reducing poverty in Nicaragua.  Depending 
on the future context of bilateral relations, he may propose 
exchanging Nicaraguan debt to Costa Rica for a matching 
investment in primary education and will also consider 
development assistance for the border area between the two 
countries. 
 
¶6. (C) Towards the end of the meeting, Panamanian Ambassador 
Lecaro mentioned the country-wide expansion of convicted PLC 
leader Arnoldo Aleman's medical parole and reminded the group 
that the Nicaraguans have an outstanding arrest order from 
his government.  Lecaro agreed with rumors that Aleman is 
rebuilding his base of support for a possible presidential 
run in 2011.  Shaking his head, Lecaro remark that "if Aleman 
is elected President, I will rip up my credentials and go 
home."  Nevertheless, Lecaro acknowledged that his government 
is unlikely to push for Aleman's incarceration or deportation. 
 
¶7. (C) Comment: After almost three months, there is no love 
lost between Ortega and the Central American ambassadors, 
regardless of their respective governments position on the 
ideological spectrum.  They regard the administration as 
disorganized and increasingly obedient to the whims of Chavez 
and his Bolivarian Revolution.  They nevertheless concede the 
necessity of working with their neighbor on regional security 
and development.
