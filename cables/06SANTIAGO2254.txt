SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION -UNSC VOTE 
 
 
On October 25, conservative, afternoon "La Segunda" (circ. 33,000) 
ran an editorial entitled "Chavez's Surprising Diplomacy."  Quote: 
 
"The Bolivian president's announcement that his colleague (Chavez) 
had offered to 'leave' him the candidacy came as a surprise....  It 
also reflects Hugo Chavez's peculiar concept of diplomacy, where he 
not only attempts to get Evo Morales involved, but shows that he is 
aggressive, inclined to personal alliances, and does not follow 
traditional practice.  In this context, Chile's role...in seeking a 
consensus (candidate)...that can truly represent the region has 
become stronger....  The race could even favor Bolivia...but judging 
from the region's image, we need not only a political 
representative, but also one that has respect for professional 
diplomacy." 
 
On October 26, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 
101,000) ran an editorial entitled "UN Security Council Vote." 
Quote: 
 
It is a bad sign that the Group of Nations of Latin America and the 
Caribbean (Grulac)...has been unable to come up with a consensus 
candidate....  Whether or not this candidate turns out to be 
Bolivia, the relevant issue here is that the country that represents 
the region should create unity rather than divisiveness.... 
Unquestionably, the country that ultimately occupies the UNSC seat 
will proceed based on its own national interests....  But it would 
also be praiseworthy if it could take actions based on some shared 
regional objectives and views....  Regardless of who occupies the 
seat...(it) cannot and must not represent a government that for 
whatever reason generates new divisions or exacerbates those that 
already exist in the region.  It would be good for everyone to 
understand this."
