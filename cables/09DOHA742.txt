COMMUNIQUE 
 
¶1. (U) Below is the English-language communique provided to 
Embassy Doha by Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 
outcome of the December 27 talks with Sudanese officials on 
Darfur. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin Communique: 
 
In the framework of the Inclusive Peace Talks in Darfur, 
which were officially launched in Doha on 18 November 2009, 
His Excellency Mr. Ahmed bin Abdullah Al-Mahmoud, Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar, and Mr. 
Djibrill Bassole, the AU/UN Joint Chief Mediator for Darfur, 
held a working session in Doha today with Dr. Ghazi Salah 
Al-Din Attabani, Advisor to the President of the Republic of 
Sudan, and his high level delegation. 
 
The meeting was held in order to exchange views on the peace 
process, in preparation for the next round of negotiations 
between the Government of National Unity of Sudan and the 
Darfuri Armed Movements, which is scheduled to begin on 24 
January 2010. 
 
Considering the necessity to involve the Darfur population in 
the search for durable peace, the Mediation thanked the 
Sudanese Government for facilitating the successful holding 
of the first civil society forum in Doha from 17 to 21 
November 2009.  The Mediation presented the outcomes and 
recommendations of that forum to the Sudanese Government 
delegation.  In anticipation of holding a broader civil 
society forum in Doha, which would adopt a global consensus 
on peace, social reconciliation and socioeconomic development 
in Darfur, the Mediation urged the Government to take into 
consideration the aspirations expressed by the people of 
Darfur. 
 
Ahead of the planned peace negotiations between the 
Government of National Unity of Sudan and the Darfuri Armed 
Movements, the Mediation informed Dr. Ghazi Salah Al-Din 
Attabani of the initiatives underway to unify the various 
factions.  The Mediation also updated the government 
delegation on the ongoing efforts to unify the negotiating 
positions of the Movements, which would allow for more 
efficient and constructive negotiations and create the 
conditions for a cessation of hostilities.  The Mediation was 
briefed on the efforts of the Government to improve the 
security and humanitarian situations.  In this respect, the 
Mediation strongly recommended that the Government do 
everything possible to create a climate of trust and a 
conducive environment for reaching a lasting settlement of 
the conflict, particularly in the areas of security and 
freedom of movement, as stipulated in UNSC resolution 1769 
and the Goodwill and Confidence Building Agreement signed in 
Doha on 17 February 2009. 
 
Regarding the normalization of relations between Sudan and 
Chad, Minister Al-Mahmoud and Mr. Bassole welcomed the visits 
of the Sudanese Presidential Adviser, Dr. Ghazi Salah Al-Din 
Attabani, to N'djamena on 10 October and the Chadian Foreign 
Minister, Moussa Faki Mahamat, to Khartoum on 26 December 
¶2009.  The Mediation urged the Sudanese Government delegation 
to continue these efforts to restore confidence and to 
promote the normalization of relations with Chad, in the 
spirit of the agreement concluded in Doha on 3 May 2009 
between Chad and Sudan. 
 
After being informed by the Sudanese Delegation about the 
ongoing electoral process, the Mediation expressed the hope 
that the ongoing peace negotiations will continue so as to 
enable all the Darfur populations to partake in the April 
2010 elections in a free and democratic manner.
