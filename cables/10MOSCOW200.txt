¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche orally to Aleksey 
Ubeyev, Deputy Director of International Cooperation 
Department, at Rosatom on January 14. After consulting with 
the Department (ref B), post delivered slightly abridged 
written talking points also to Ubeyev on Jan 19.  As Ubeyev 
is currently out of the country, post followed up with 
Rosatom contact Aleksandr Zhgutov, Director of Office of 
Relations with International Organizations, (one level below 
Ubeyev) on January 22.  Zhgutov informed us that Rosatom is 
"working on the issue".  He noted that Olli Heinonen, Deputy 
Director General of IAEA, visited Rosatom in mid-January and 
raised the Helium-3 shortage issue. Post will continue to 
follow up.
