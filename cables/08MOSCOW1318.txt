SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED:  FRENCH UNSC RESOLUTION ON 
BURMA 
 
REF: A. STATE 49813 
 
     ¶B. RANGOON 349 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to MFA Senior Counselor 
for International Organizations Petr Ilichev on May 12. 
Ilichev said that owing to the long Russian holiday weekend, 
the MFA was unaware of the French draft resolution on Burma. 
After reading a copy of the draft we provided, Ilichev 
thought the GOR could support the resolution with the 
exception of Operating Paragraph 2's call for the Burmese 
government to "grant full and immediate access" to foreign 
aid workers, which imposed upon Burmese sovereignty.  Ilichev 
also questioned the efficacy of such a demand considering 
that Burma was run by a military government that thought 
itself capable of handling an emergency and was unlikely to 
allow extensive access by foreigners. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MFA Myanmar desk officer Aleksey Semenikhin told us 
that two planes from the Russian Ministry of Emergency 
Situations had landed in Burma and off-loaded relief 
supplies.  Semenikhin believed that emergency response 
experts traveling on the planes had been allowed to remain in 
the country.  He was unaware of reports that the Burmese 
government denied visas to Russian aid workers (ref B).
