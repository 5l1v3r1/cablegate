¶1. (C) Vice Minister of Defense Sergio Jaamillo told us on 
September 10 that the International Institute for Strategic 
Studies (IISS) in London plans to publish the contents of the 
hard drives belonging to deceased Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia (FARC) Secretariat member Raul Reyes.  The 
laptops and hard drives were recovered by the Colombian 
military following the March 1, 2008 cross-border raid on the 
Reyes camp in Ecuador.

¶2. (C) Jaramillo noted that IISS originally sent analysts to 
Colombia to study the data in August 2008, but the project 
was subsequently delayed.  He said IISS plans to publish the 
results of their study in two phases:  an academic analysis 
of the information followed by the posting of a searchable 
archive.  He lamented the project has been delayed by eight 
months, but noted that phase one should be ready by the end 
of this year.  Jaramillo said he secured private funding for 
the project in order avoid any connection with the Government 
of Colombia.
