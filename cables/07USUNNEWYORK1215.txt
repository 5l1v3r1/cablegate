¶1. (U) The U.N. General Assembly December 17 adopted 27 draft 
resolutions on the recommendation of the Fourth Committee 
(Special Political and Decolonization Committee). 
Resolutions and Plenary votes are in paragraph three. 
 
¶2. (U) The only notable aspect of the voting was a 
spontaneous applause at the adoption, by consensus, of the 
"Commemoration of the Two-hundredth Anniversary of the 
Abolition of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade."  On the issue 
of Gibraltar, Spain delivered an explanation of vote wherein 
it expressed eagerness to "listen to the aspirations of the 
people of Gibraltar."  The U.K. responded by saying that it 
"does not accept that any controversy exists" on the issue of 
Gibraltar.
