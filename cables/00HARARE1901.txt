GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE (GOZ) ON THE IMPACTS AND NEEDS RESULTING 
FROM THE RECENT FLOODING DISASTER IN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN 
ZIMBABWE.  THIS INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IN A DRAFT REPORT BY 
THE GOZ'S CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT RECENTLY OBTAINED BY THE 
MISSION ENTITLED "THE OVERVIEW SITUATION REPORT: THE IMPACT OF 
DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY CAUSED BY CYCLONE ELINE FLOODS AND STORMS 
AND THE WAY FORWARD".  ALTHOUGH NOT YET OFFICIALLY RELEASED BY 
GOVERNMENT (THE FINAL OFFICIAL REPORT IS EXPECTED TO BE READY 
WITHIN "ABOUT TWO WEEKS TIME"), THE MISSION BELIEVES THESE 
NUMBERS WILL REMAIN CLOSE TO THE FINAL OFFICIAL ESTIMATES ON 
THIS SUBJECT.  AN EDITED VERSION OF THIS ENTIRE REPORT IS 
PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS.  NOTE: ALL FIGURES ARE 
PRESENTED IN ZIMBABWE DOLLARS (Z$) WITH A CURRENT U.S. EXCHANGE 
RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 40:1. END NOTE. 
 
PREAMBLE 
 
¶3. TROPICAL CYCLONE ELINE ORIGINATED, AS OTHER CYCLONES DO, IN 
THE INDIAN OCEAN, REACHING ZIMBABWE ON FEBRUARY 21, BEFORE 
ENDING OVER BOTSWANA AROUND MARCH 1.  IN ITS WAKE, ELINE LEFT A 
TRAIL OF DEATH AND DEVASTATION THROUGH THE STORMS AND FLOODING, 
THE EXTENT OF WHICH IS UNPRECEDENTED IN LIVING MEMORY. 
 
THE MAJOR AREAS WHICH BORE THE BRUNT OF THE STORMS AND THE 
SUBSEQUENT INUNDATION ARE CHIPINGE AND CHIMANIMANI DISTRICTS IN 
MANICALAND PROVINCE; CHIREDZI AND MWENEZI DISTRICTS IN MASVINGO 
PROVINCE; AND ALL THE SIX DISTRICTS IN MATABELELAND SOUTH 
PROVINCE, NAMELY, BEITBRIDGE, GWANDA, FILABUSI, ESIGODINI, 
PLUMTREE AND KEZI.  MARGINAL DAMAGE, MAINLY THROUGH 
EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH RAINFALL, LANDSLIDES AND DAM FAILURES WAS 
ALSO EXPERIENCED IN ZAKA DISTRICT IN MASVINGO PROVINCE, AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  01901  01 OF 07  070743Z 
MBERENGWA AND MVUMA DISTRICTS IN MIDLANDS PROVINCE. CONSEQUENT 
UPON THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS AND IN VIEW OF THE LIMITED CAPACITY 
IN THE ARE 
AS AFFECTED TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION AT HAND, HIS 
EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT DULY PROMULGATED THE DECLARATION OF A 
STATE OF DISASTER IN ALL THESE DISTRICTS IN TERMS OF THE 
PROVISIONS OF THE CIVIL PROTECTION ACT (CHAPTER 10:06) ON 
FEBRUARY 24. 
 
ECONOMIC AND TRADE IMPLICATIONS 
 
¶4. ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS FROM THE MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY 
AND COMMERCE, THE EFFECTS OF CYLONE ELINE WILL ADVERSELY 
PERVADE THE ENTIRE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY.  LOSS OF JOBS WILL OCCUR 
IN THE CHIMANIMANI PLANTATIONS, WHICH HOST 92% OF ZIMBABWE'S 
TIMBER PLANTATIONS AND SAWMILLS AND PRODUCE 52% OF THE NATIONAL 
SAWN TIMBER.  CURRENTLY, THE SAWMILLS EMPLOY 3,650 WORKERS, 
MOST OF WHOM ARE LIKELY TO WORK REDUCED HOURS.  TIMBER EXPORTS, 
AFTER VALUE ADDITION, AMOUNT TO SOME Z$30 MILLION A MONTH IN 
FOREX.  THE SHORTAGE OF ZESA (ZIMBABWE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY 
AUTHORITY) POWER AND FUEL WILL CONSIDERABLY REDUCE THE EXPORT

POTENTIAL.  AN ESTIMATED TOTAL OF 4,400 HECTARES OF PINE TREES 
WERE DESTROYED, REPRESENTING A LOSS TO INVESTMENT OF SOME Z$498 
MILLION.  WATTLE TREES, WHOSE BARK IS USED IN THE LEATHER 
TANNING INDUSTRY, ALSO EXPERIENCED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE AMOUNTING 
TO SOME Z$138 MILLION. 
 
-SUGAR OUTPUT, AS WELL AS THAT OF COTTON WILL REGISTER A 
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AS A RESULT OF WATER-LOGGING. 
 
-THE DISTRIBUTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES WILL BE SERIOUSLY 
AFFECTED SINCE THE MAJOR ROADS AND BRIDGES LEADING OUT OF THE 
EASTERN HIGHLANDS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED. ZIMALLOYS AND ZISCO IN THE 
MIDLANDS (MAJOR ZIMBABWE NATIONAL STEEL/METAL MANUFACTURERS) 
HAVE HAD THEIR OPERATIONS AND EXPORT PROSPECTS SERIOUSLY 
REDUCED, DUE MAINLY TO THE UNSERVICEABLE ROAD AND RAIL LINKS 
WITH BEIRA AND MAPUTO IN MOZAMBIQUE. 
 
-DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRY, SUCH AS FURNITURE MANUFACTURING, WILL FEEL 
THE IMPACT OF THE CYCLONE THROUGH A REDUCTION IN THE SUPPLY OF 
TIMBER.  THIS WILL ALSO AFFECT THEIR EXPORT PERFORMANCE.  THE 
RE-ROUTING OF EXPORTS THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA AND BOTSWANA WILL 
LEAD TO LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS WHICH MIGHT AFFECT THE SCHEDULING OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

GENERAL SCOPE OF THE PROBLEMS 
 
¶5. GENERALLY, THE ENTIRE POPULATION IN THE DISTRICTS UNDER THE 
DECLARATION WAS AFFECTED IN VARYING DEGREES. THE DISRUPTION OF 
THE ROAD NETWORK AND DAMAGE TO AND LOSS OF BRIDGES CUT OFF THE 
POPULATION'S LIFE-LINE OF SUPPLIES, SUCH AS FOOD, FUEL AND 
SERVICES.  THE FELLING OF TREES BY THE STORMS SEVERED PTC 
(POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION PARASTATAL) AND ZESA 
LINES, RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONTACT WITH THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY AND POWER FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. 
 
-SIMILARLY, THE ENTIRE AFFECTED POPULATION SUFFERED AND, INDEED, 
CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE DAMAGE TO THE 
ENVIRONMENT.  THE MASSIVE LOSS OF TOPSOIL WILL HAVE FAR-REACHING 
IMPLICATIONS ON AGRICULTURE IN THESE DISTRICTS.  THE DAMAGE TO 
THE FLORA AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, THE FAUNA WILL LEAD TO SCARS 
ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL LANDSCAPE WHOSE COST TO THE COUNTRY IS 
INCALCULABLE. 
 
-MORE THAN 200,000 OF THE PEOPLE IN THE AFFECTED AREAS ARE 
CONSIDERED VULNERABLE (THE OLD, THE YOUNG AND THE INFIRM OF BOTH 
GENDERS), OUT OF A TOTAL ESTIMATED POPULATION OF SOME 2.7 
MILLION PEOPLE.  THE PERSONAL AND COLLECTIVE LOSSES RANGE FROM 
LOSS OF LIFE OF IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, TO LOSS OF HOUSEHOLDS, 
CROPS AND LIVESTOCK, TO (ANTICIPATED SUBSEQUENT) LOSSES OF BOTH 
LIFE AND LIVESTOCK TO DISEASES AFFLICTING THE SURVIVING 
POPULATIONS. 
 
-DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION TO CLINICS, SCHOOLS, DRINKING WATER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  01901  02 OF 07  070744Z 
SOURCES, SUCH AS WELLS AND BOREHOLES, AS WELL AS IRRIGATION 
SCHEMES, SERIOUSLY DISRUPTED THE LIVES OF THIS SEGMENT OF THE 
POPULATION. 
 
-ON THE INFRASTRUCTURAL FRONT, MINOR REPAIRS TO ROADS AND 
BRIDGES WERE PERFORMED TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY.  THE ARMY 
ERECTED 'BAILEY' BRIDGES ON MAJOR ROADS, SUCH AS THE CHANGAZI 
AND NYANYADZI BRIDGES, TO IMPROVE ACCESS INTO THE HINTERLAND, 
AND FARM LABOURERS WERE USED TO CLEAR ROADS OF TREES IN 
CHIMANIMANI AND CHIPINGE DISTRICTS.  IN MATABE 
LELAND SOUTH 
PROVINCE, JOINT EFFORTS INVOLVING THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES, 
COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION AND GOVERNMENT LED TO THE RE-OPENING OF 
THE UMZINGWANE BRIDGE AND OTHER SMALL BRIDGES IN THE AREA. 
 
-THE ZIMBABWE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AUTHORITY (ZESA) SPENT SOME 
Z$27 MILLION TO REPAIR AND REHABILITATE THEIR LINES IN THE FOUR 
PROVINCES.  WHILE THE REHABILITATION IS STILL ONGOING, AN 
ADDITIONAL Z$30 MILLION IN COSTS HAS BEEN INCURRED DUE TO 
REVENUE LOSSES.  SIMILARLY, THE POST AND TELECOMMUNICATION 
CORPORATION (PTC) HAS REGISTERED LOSSES AMOUNTING TO Z$30

MILLION IN REPAIRS AND LOST REVENUE DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF THE 
STORMS AND FLOODING. 
 
-THE DISTRIBUTION OF RELIEF ITEMS OF FOOD, CLOTHING, BLANKETS, 
TENTS AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES CONTINUES.  AN APPEAL HAS BEEN MADE 
TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS AND UNDP, AND A NUMBER OF ENQUIRIES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED 
FROM FOREIGN MISSIONS, NOTABLY FROM CANADA AND ITALY. 
 
SYNOPSIS OF THE RELIEF, RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION 
STRATEGY 
 
¶6. FROM THE OUTSET, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT PRIORITIES HAD TO BE 
SET AND STRATEGIES AGREED UPON TO EFFECTIVELY TACKLE THE SUPPLY 
OF RELIEF AND GUIDE THE RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION 
PROGRAM. 
 
-THE FIRST PRIORITY WAS TO CONDUCT INITIAL DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS 
IN TANDEM WITH THE RESCUE OF MAROONED PEOPLE.  ACCESS BY ROAD 
WAS GROSSLY LIMITED DUE TO DAMAGE TO ROADS AND BRIDGES.  THE 
ZIMBABWE FORCES WERE THEN INVITED TO FLY SORTIES INTO THE 
AREAS.  SIX HELICOPTERS WERE PUT AT (THE DEPARTMENT'S) DISPOSAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  01901  03 OF 07  070744Z 
TOGETHER WITH TWO FIXED-WING PLANES.  THE ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC 
POLICE'S FIXED-WING SECTION ALSO PROVIDED SIX PLANES WHICH WERE 
USED BOTH FOR RECONNAISSANCE AND AIRLIFTING OF FOODSTUFFS FROM 
HARARE TO AERODROMES IN THE AFFECTED AREAS.  HELICOPTERS 
RESCUED 605 TRAPPED PEOPLE AND ALSO FERRIED FOOD AND OTHER 
RELIEF ITEMS FROM AERODROMES TO INACCESSIBLE AREAS. 
 
-ACCESS TO MOST AREAS IN THE AFFECTED DISTRICTS IS NOW POSSIBLE 
BY LIGHT FOUR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES, ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION 
REMAINS FLUID WITH THE CONTINUING RAINFALL.  SATELLITE DEPOTS 
HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN AREAS WHERE PEOPLE FROM INACCESSIBLE 
AREAS CAN COME BY SCOTCH-CARTS, DONKEYS OR ON FOOT TO RECEIVE 
RELIEF.  ALTERNATIVELY, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUT IN CAMPS TO ENSURE 
EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF RELIEF SUPPLIES AND SUSTENANCE. 
 
-MEANWHILE, DONATIONS IN CASH AND KIND HAVE CONTINUED TO POUR 
INTO THE COFFERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL PROTECTION AND THE 
ZIMBABWE RED CROSS SOCIETY.  TO DATE, THE DEPARTMENT HAS 
RECEIVED SOME Z$10,850,000 IN CASH, IN ADDITION TO DONATIONS OF 
20 TONS OF MAIZE, 3 TONS OF MEALIE (MAIZE) MEAL, 5.8 TONS OF 
MILK, BEANS, SUGAR, KAPENTA (FISH) AND OTHER FOOD ITEMS.  OTHER 
ITEMS SUCH AS APPROX. 6,000 BLANKETS, 240 PLASTIC ROLLS, 110 
TENTS, SOAP AND USED CLOTHING WERE ALSO DONATED.  THE ZIMBABWE 
RED CROSS SOCIETY HAS RECEIVED Z$11.3 MILLION IN CASH, AS WELL 
AS VARIOUS DONATED COMMODITIES, SUCH AS 5 TONS OF SUGAR, 60 TONS 
MEALIE-MEAL, KAPENTA, KITCHEN UTENSILS, PLASTIC SHEETING AND 
BLANKETS.  OTHER ITEMS WERE DONATED DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED 
AREAS BY NGOS AND CIVIC GROUPS.  HOWEVER, AS A CONTROL MEASURE, 
MEASURES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE WHICH ENABLE THE DISTRICT 
ADMINISTRATORS AND PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATORS TO COMPILE 
AGGREGATE CHARTS OF ALL DONATIONS DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THEIR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  01901  03 OF 07  070744Z 
RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS TO DATE. 
 
-THE APPEAL FOR RELIEF ITEMS CONTINUES, SINCE THE BULK OF THE 
VULNERABLE POPULATION HAVE NO MEANS TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES WELL 
INTO NEXT YEAR.  THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL WELFARE, WHICH HAS 
SOME Z$12 MILLION IN THEIR (BUDGET) ALLOCATION, HAS BEEN 
REQUESTED TO ASSESS THE FOOD REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE IN NEED FOR 
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 
 
-IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM, THE STRATEGY ENVISAGES THE 
RECONSTRUCTION OF HOMESTEADS, GRANARIES AND BLAIR TOILETS 
DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BY THE FLOODS.  A NUMBER OF DESIGNS FOR 
MORE ROBUST HOMES ARE BEING DEVELOPED BY TECHNICAL STAFF FROM 
VARIOUS AGENCIES.  IT IS HOPED THAT BOTH GOVERNMENT AND NGOS 
WILL USE THESE DESIGNS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HOMESTEADS IN 
THE AFFECTED AREAS.  THESE STRUCTURES WILL REPLACE THE PLASTIC 
SHEETING AND TENT SHELTERS THAT WERE ERECTED AS A TEMPORARY 
MEASURE. 
 
-IN THE RECONSTRUCTION PHASE, SOME OF THE HOMES WILL HAVE TO BE 
RELOCATED TO HIGHER AND FIRMER GROUND AWAY FROM THE FLOOD

PLAINS.  OF NECESSITY, THE PROCESS OF RELOCATION WILL DOVETAIL 
WITH THE REORGANISATION OF VILLAGES AND THE RESETTLEMENT 
PROGRAMME.  IN CHIMANIMANI, ESPECIALLY, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED 
TO ACQUIRE PLANTATION LAND TO ACCOMMODATE RURAL COMMUNITIES 
LANGUISHING IN THE CROWDED VALLEYS. 
 
-THE REHABILITATION PHASE MUST, OF NECESSITY, TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
THE NEED TO SUPPLY COMMUNITIES WITH SEED, FERTILIZERS, CHEMICALS 
AND TILLAGE.  THIS WILL LESSEN THE ELEMENT OF DEPENDENCE WHICH, 
PARADOXICALLY, THE RELIEF PHASE PROMOTES.  GOVERNMENT, WITH 
SUPPORT FROM THE UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES AND OTHER NGOS, WILL 
NEED TO UNDERTAKE AN AGGRESSIVE AND WELL-COORDINATED EFFORT TO 
THIS ASPECT OF THE STRATEGY. 
 
-APART FROM THE PHASES OF THE STRATEGY ADDRESSED ABOVE, HEALTH 
CONSIDERATIONS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED SINCE THEIR POTENTIAL 
EFFECTS TRANSCEND ALL THE IMPACTS DISCUSSED ABOVE. 
 
-DURING THE RESCUE PHASE, MANY PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED BY EXPOSURE 
TO THE ELEMENTS, THEREBY INCREASING THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO 
ILLNESS; HENCE THE NEED FOR CLOTHING AND TEMPORARY SHELTER. 
THIS SITUATION WAS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY DELAYS IN AIRLIFTING 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  01901  04 OF 07  070744Z 
FOOD RATIONS AND THE SUPPLY OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO THE 
AFFECTED AREAS/PEOPLE - BOTH OF WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO GOOD 
HEALTH.  BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE FEEDING REQUIREMENTS, THERE IS 
NEED TO SUSTAIN LIVES IN THE LONG-RUN THROUGH CONTINUED 
SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING PROGRAMS. 
 
-CURRENTLY, THERE IS IMMEDIATE NEED FOR WATER PURIFICATION 
TABLETS AND EQUIPMENT TO PREVENT THE OUTBREAK OF DIARRHOEAL 
DISEASES, SUCH AS CHOLERA, WHICH THRIVE ON THE ABSENCE OF CLEAN 
DRINKING WATER AND GOOD SANITATION.  WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF 
STATIC WATER PONDS, MALARIA OUTBREAKS HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPORTED 
IN ALL THE AFFECTED AREAS AND BEYOND.  IF INTERVENTIONIST 
STRATEGIES ARE NOT ADOPTED, MALNUTRITION WILL ALSO OCCUR OVER 
TIME, FURTHER COMPLICATING THE HEALTH PROFILE. 
 
-WHILE THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE, WITH THE 
ASSISTANCE OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO),  HAS MADE 
SOME INROADS IN INTERVENTION, THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED FOR 
FURTHER ASSISTANCE FROM INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCES TO IMPROVE 
THEIR PREPAREDNESS IN THIS REGARD. 
 
-ANOTHER AREA WHICH NEEDS TO BE HIGHLIGHTED IS THE NEED FOR 
APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT TO COUNTER THE EFFECTS OF DISASTERS, IN 
GENERAL.  IDEALLY, THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE EASTERN 
HIGHLANDS NEED TO ACQUIRE CHAIN-SAWS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
VEHICLES.  IN THE AFTERMATH OF CYCLONE ELINE, THE ABILITY OF THE 
EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES IN MUTARE DISTRICT TO REACT WAS 
COMPROMISED BY INACCESSIBILITY OF THE ROADS CAUSED BY FALLEN 
TREES.  THE SAME CONSTRAINTS WERE EXPERIENCED IN CHIPINGE 
DISTRICT.  CHIMANIMANI DISTRICT DOES NOT HAVE ANY TYPE OF 
EMERGENCY VEHICLES, HENCE THE IMMENSE DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  01901  04 OF 07  070744Z 
IN THE INITIAL REACTION STAGES.  THERE IS ALSO A NEED TO 
ESTABLISH DISASTER WAREHOUSES, PREFERABLY AT THE PROVINCIAL 
LEVEL, WHERE ITEMS SUCH AS MOBILE KITCHENS, TENTS AND OTHER NON-

REGIONAL AND BILATERAL COOPERATION 
 
¶7. MEETINGS ON REGIONAL AND BILATERAL COOPERATION HAVE RECENTLY 
TAKEN PLACE.  ON MARCH 3, THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND 
NATIONAL HOUSING AND HIS COLLEAGUES FROM BOTSWANA AND 
MOZAMBIQUE WERE HOSTED BY THEIR COUNTERPART, THE MINISTER OF 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION IN PRETORIA. 
THE DELIBERATIONS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO OFFER 
ASSISTANCE TO MOZAMBIQUE WHICH IS REELING UNDER THE EFFECTS OF 
CYCLONE ELINE.  FOUR MAJOR RESOLUTIONS RESULTED FROM THE 
DISCUSSIONS: 
 
-THAT A TEAM OF EXPERTS BE CONSTITUTED TO DEAL WITH THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF THE RECENT DISASTERS ON THE ECONOMY, TRADE, 
AGRICULTURE, THE GENERAL LIVELIHOOD OF THE CITIZENS OF OUR 
RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, ETC., AND SUBMIT PROPOSALS THEREON AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE;

PAGE 03        HARARE  01901  05 OF 07  070745Z 
 
-THAT WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO PROMOTING COORDINATION IN THE 
HANDLING OF THE CURRENT AND ALL FUTURE DISASTERS, AND TO 
ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE STRUCTURES IN ORDER TO 
REALIZE THIS OBJECTIVE; 
 
-THAT THE DISASTER MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS FROM OUR COUNTRIES 
SHOULD ANALYSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT WITH A 
VIEW TO ENHANCING OUR CAPACITY TO RESPOND AND PREVENT/MITIGATE 
DISASTERS, AND ALSO CONSIDER THE POSSIBLE ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
 
SADC DISASTER MANAGEMENT UNIT; AND 
 
-THAT OUR COUNTRIES SHOULD MOVE TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF OUR 
WEATHER MONITORING, AND JOINT TRAINING OF STAFF. 
 
OFFICIALS FROM PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES ARE EXPECTED TO MEET SOON 
TO DISCUSS IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE MINISTERIAL RESOLUTIONS. 
 
¶8. WITH RESPECT TO BILATERAL INITIATIVES, ZIMBABWE HAS PLEDGED 
TO ASSIST MOZAMBIQUE ON SEVERAL FRONTS: 
 
-THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE HAS ALREADY VISITED 
MAPUTO WITH HIS DELEGATION WHERE BILATERAL AND SUB-REGIONAL 
COOPERATION DISCUSSIONS TOOK PLACE. 
 
-A SADC ACTION PLAN HAS BEEN PRODUCED. 
 
-DEFENCE CHIEFS FROM THE TWO COUNTRIES ALSO ENGAGED IN 
DISCUSSIONS LEADING TO JOINT OPERATIONS IN RESCUE AND LOGISTICAL 
SUPPORT ACROSS OUR COMMON BORDER.

-CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION FORMALITIES HAVE BEEN RELAXED TO ALLOW 
DISTRESSED MOZAMBICANS NEAR THE BORDER TO ENTER ZIMBABWE FOR 
RELIEF. 
 
GOVERNMENT AWAITS FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS FIELD OF 
COOPERATION BEFORE REVIEWING ITS ASSISTANCE.

OTHER SOURCES ON THIS SUBJECT.  THE ESTIMATES ALSO AGREE FAIRLY 
WELL WITH THE MISSION'S PRIOR PRELIMINARY DAMAGE/NEEDS 
ESTIMATES.  FOR THESE REASONS, WHILE NOT YET OFFICIALLY 
RELEASED, THE MISSION BELIEVES THAT THESE FIGURES WILL REMAIN 
CLOSE TO THE FINAL OFFICIAL ESTIMATES FOR THIS DISASTER.  THE 
TOTAL MAGNITUDE OF THESE ESTIMATES (APPROX. US$27.5 MILLION) 
LENDS STRONG CREDENCE TO THE MISSION'S PRIOR ASSESSMENT 
REGARDING THE RELATIVELY MORE MODERATE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF 
THE IMPACTS FROM THIS DISASTER IN ZIMBABWE (VS. NEIGHBORING 
MOZAMBIQUE). END COMMENT.
