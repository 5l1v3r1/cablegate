SUBJECT: NEW AFGHAN MINISTER OF REFUGEES AND REPATRIATION 
SHEER MOHAMMAD ETEBARI 
 
REF: A. KABUL 3520 
     ¶B. KABUL 3414 
 
¶1. (SBU) On November 17, the Afghan Parliament confirmed 
Sheer Mohammmad Etebari as the new Minister of Refugees and 
Repatriation, replacing the ineffectual Akbar Akbar.  UNHCR 
and the Kabul Refugee Section both see Etebari as a less than 
perfect but acceptable alternative to Akbar and have worked 
quietly behind the scenes to support and encourage his 
confirmation.  Etebari was confirmed as part of the package 
(Governor of the Central Bank and Supreme Court nominee) 
considered by the Walesi Jirga.  All were confirmed. 
 
¶2. (SBU) UNHCR had urged Speaker Qanooni to unblock Etebari's 
confirmation, which had been held hostage by the disagreement 
between Speaker Qanooni and President Karzai over Foreign 
Minister Spanta's future.  The Refugee Secton encouraged 
Etebari's low-key lobbying of important members of 
parliament.  Etebari did not give a strong presentation at 
the hearing and received only 95 votes out of 168, only ten 
votes over the 85-vote minimum.  Etebari is currently on the 
National Security Council (NSC) and rumored to be a close 
friend of the Karzai family.  He is not a member of the 
Itahad-i-Islami party but reportedly has the support of Ustad 
Abdurab Rasoul Sayyaf, a powerful former warlord and member 
of parliament who heads the party. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We will need to help Etebari shape a coherent 
strategy to create sustainable repatriation and resettlement 
policies.  In conversations with the Refugee Section, his 
enthusiasm has been encouraging but his ideas unrealistic. 
As he did in his confirmation hearing, he makes sweeping and 
improbable statements about taking back government-owned 
agricultural land from local warlords and giving it to 
returning refugees.  He was open to UNHCR and Embassy advice 
as he prepared for his hearing and said he welcomes continued 
close collaboration. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Etebari spent some years in Peshawar as a refugee 
but frequently returned to Afghanistan throughout the 
conflict years.  He worked as a geography teacher, UN and NGO 
field representative, paramedic, mujahadeen guide, and 
television cameraman before joining the NSC.  He speaks 
passable (and colorful) English.
