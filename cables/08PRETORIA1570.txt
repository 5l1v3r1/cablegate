¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  Mugabe biographer Heidi Holland doubts that 
the Zimbabwean leader is serious about the South African-led 
talks.  Mugabe will continue to "run rings" around South 
African President Mbeki, as he has done for years.  She fears 
a vengeful Mugabe is intent on destroying the Zimbabwean 
opposition.  In her view, only direct U.K. talks with Mugabe 
could possibly lead to his departure from office, a point she 
recently made to U.K. Foreign Secretary Miliband.  Holland 
recommends using former Zimbabwean Minister Denis Norman, one 
of the few people Mugabe trusts, as the link between Harare 
and London.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) PolOff met on July 15 in Johannesburg with Heidi 
Holland, author of the recently-published biography of 
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe entitled "Dinner with 
Mugabe."  Working through Mugabe confidante Father Fidelis 
Mukonori, Holland secured a 2 1/2 hour interview with Mugabe 
in January 2008 (Mugabe's last interview with Western media 
was three years earlier).  Holland also interviewed dozens of 
people who know Mugabe well, and worked closely with 
psychologists to flesh out the portrait of Mugabe.

Mbeki Will Fail

¶3. (C) Holland painted a picture of a paranoid, sad, lonely 
and vengeful Mugabe, intent on holding onto power at all 
costs.  Holland doubts that Mugabe is serious about the South 
African-led negotiations with the opposition Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC), noting that Mugabe has no respect 
for the MDC and regards Mbeki as little more than a "boy." 
As he has done since 2000, Mugabe will run circles around 
Mbeki, buying time to destroy the political opposition.

Only U.K. Can Succeed 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) According to Holland, Mugabe continues to believe 
(however falsely) that his real problem is the United 
Kingdom.  This reflects Mugabe's deep-seated belief that the 
British failed to hold up their end of the Lancaster House 
bargain.  Despite his harsh anti-U.K. rhetoric, Mugabe 
idealizes the British and craves their respect.  In Holland's 
view, the only possibility of getting Mugabe out of power 
before he dies -- which could be a long time, Holland said, 
noting that his mother lived to be nearly 100 -- is direct 
British engagement with Mugabe.  Holland met with U.K. 
Foreign Secretary Miliband during his July 6-8 trip to South 
Africa to make her pitch for direct talks with Mugabe.  She 
says Miliband listened to her arguments, although was 
skeptical. 
 
¶5. (C) The ideal person to serve as the link between the U.K. 
and Mugabe, Holland suggested, is Denis Norman, the white 
Zimbabwean who served as a minister in Mugabe's government 
and now lives the U.K.  Holland said that Mugabe has 
confidence in Norman, one of only a few people he trusts (she 
also mentioned Father Mukonori and former EU advisor Tim 
Sheehy).  Holland did not see a major role for the USG in her 
proposed outreach to Mugabe, but noted that Mugabe respected 
former Secretary of State Kissinger. 
 
¶6. (C) Holland suggested that Mugabe might be willing to 
accept a "best person government," with Mugabe as Head of 
State but "technocrats" running the ministries.  This is much 
QState but "technocrats" running the ministries.  This is much 
more palatable than a "government of national unity" or 
"transitional government," and could be sold to Mugabe as 
resembling his first term as president (1980-85), a period 
Mugabe remembers fondly. 
 
--------------------- 
Sad, Lonely, Vengeful 
--------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Zimbabwean president is isolated and lonely, 
Holland suggested, and has been much of his life.  Mugabe was 
abandoned by his father at a young age; as a child, "books
