SUBJECT: MONTEALEGRE TO DAS MADISON: A VOTE FOR RIZO IS A 
VOTE FOR ALEMAN . . . AND ORTEGA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Eduardo Montealegre of the National Liberal 
Alliance (ALN) predicts that at least four presidential 
candidates will compete in November's presidential race.  He 
told visiting DAS Kirsten Madison, USAID DAA Mike Magan, and 
Ambassador that ultimately Nicaraguans must vote for or 
against Sandinista Party (FSLN) candidate Daniel Ortega, and 
for or against the Aleman-Ortega Pact.  He believes that high 
voter turnout will work in his favor and that Nicaraguan 
youth will support him.  Montealegre suggested the U.S. can 
best help by supporting vote promotion efforts to encourage 
high voter turnout and bolster observation to stem fraud.  To 
Montealegre, the fear factor continues to work in Rizo's 
favor, as most Nicaraguan financiers believe Rizo is a "safer 
bet" than Montealegre to beat Ortega.  He continues 
negotiations with Jose Antonio Alvarado and may reach an 
agreement.  According to Montealegre, Venezuelan President 
Chavez's fertilizer, oil, and medical support initiatives are 
designed to help 
Ortega win the election, but notes that the fact Chavez has 
singled him out as Ortega's competition might work in 
Montealegre's favor.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A TWO-ISSUE CAMPAIGN 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  (C) On April 21, Eduardo Montealegre shared with DAS 
Kirsten Madison, USAID DAA Mike Magan, and Ambassador, his 
prediction that at four major candidates will compete in 
November's presidential race.  He opined that ultimately, 
Nicaraguans will be faced with voting for, or against, FSLN 
candidate Daniel Ortega, and for, or against, the 
Aleman-Ortega Pact.  Montealegre was optimistic that 
Nicaraguans will be savvy enough to realize that a vote for 
PLC candidate Jose Rizo is tantamount to voting for PLC 
leader/convicted money launderer Aleman, and a thus vote for 
the Pact.  In Montealegre's view, his most pressing challenge 
is convincing voters -- especially anti-Ortega and 
anti-Aleman independents -- that he is the candidate most 
able to beat Ortega. 
 
GETTING OUT THE VOTE BEST WAY TO BEAT ORTEGA 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶3.  (C) Montealegre remarked that traditionally high voter 
turnout has disadvantaged Ortega, while a low turnout favors 
him.  The challenge is to convince independents to vote, as 
most of these voters are anti-Sandinista.  A four-way race, 
while nerve-wracking, could also play in Montealegre's favor 
and against Ortega because if Ortega does not win on the 
first round (requiring he receive 35% of the voters and lead 
his nearest competitor by 5%), Ortega is sure to lose in a 
runoff, unless he were pitted against Rizo (the polls support 
Montealegre's assertion). 
 
ALEMAN CHOSE RIZO TO APPEASE THE AMERICANS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- 
 
¶4.  (C) Montealegre believes Aleman chose Rizo because he 
thought Rizo is the most palatable option for the U.S. 
government.  Similarly, Aleman chose Gilberto Wong to run 
Rizo's campaign because Wong is a friend of Jeb Bush. 
 
PEOPLE VOTE FOR CANDIDATES -- NOT PARTY MACHINERY 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5.  (C) Dispelling common concerns that the ALN-PC does not 
possess the party machinery to compete against Ortega or 
Rizo, Montealegre argued that people will vote for the 
candidate, not party machinery.  While his alliance already 
enjoys considerable backing and organizational structure, 
marketing the candidate and crafting the message pose the 
real challenges, challenges that require financial backing, 
asserted Montealegre.  Montealegre explained that he will 
draw on support not only from disaffected PLC members, but 
also from Nicaragua's sizable independent vote (estimates 
range from 40% to 50% of the population).  And, as the 
youngest among the presidential candidates, Montealegre will 
appeal to Nicaraguan youth (about 70% of Nicaraguans are 
under 30).  He predicted that the youth vote, which is more 
change oriented and less risk adverse, will be a determining 
factor in November. 
 
PRIMARIES 
- - - - - 
 
 
¶6.  (C) Montealegre, who voiced appreciation for U.S. efforts 
to support multi-party primaries, lamented that the 
initiative had not succeeded.  With irony, he noted that Rizo 
contradicted himself by claiming there is no time to hold 
primaries to select a president, but there is time to hold 
multi-party primaries to select his VP and departmental 
deputies. 
 
PLAYING THE U.S. CARD 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7.  (C) Montealegre ventured that most Nicaraguans are 
pro-U.S. and expect the U.S. to "twist their arms" on 
occasion.  He suggested the most effective way for the U.S. 
to lend its support is through deeds rather than words.  For 
example, supporting vote promotion efforts to encourage high 
voter turnout and to bolster observation to stem fraud would 
be enormously helpful. 
 
PROS AND CONS OF BOLANOS SUPPORT 
- - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - 
 
¶8.  (C) On the subject of President Bolanos, Montealegre 
ventured that Bolanos can best support him through indirect 
means, out of the reach of the public eye.  Bolanos himself 
is not popular, so a too-obvious endorsement could backfire, 
explained Montealegre.  (Note: President Bolanos has been 
working behind the scenes to garner support for Montealegre, 
in talks with fellow Central American presidents and regional 
capital, as well as with Nicaraguan politicians and 
financiers.  End Note.) 
 
PRIVATE SECTOR CONTINUES TO HEDGE ITS BETS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - -- - 
 
¶9.  (C) To Montealegre, the fear factor continues to work in 
Rizo's favor, as most of Nicaragua's risk-adverse financiers 
believe Rizo is a safer bet than Montealegre, and easier to 
manipulate.  They also refuse to accept that Aleman is 
capable of handing Ortega the presidency in exchange for his 
freedom.  Despite their reluctance, however, following a 
recent meeting that he, Alvarado, and Rizo held with 
Nicaraguan capital, Nicaraguan business leaders have decided 
to contract a poll to determine whether Montealegre or Rizo 
draws the most support (reportedly they will use a Salvadoran 
polling firm).  The poll could clear up their doubts, opined 
Montealegre.  He ventured that ultimately, Nicaraguan capital 
might resort to the same tactic it has always employed, 
hedging its bets by supporting all candidates, even Ortega. 
(Note: This assessment coincides with what we are hearing 
from the private sector.  End Note.) 
 
FICKLE ALVARADO CONTINUES TO PLAY BOTH SIDES 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶10.  (C) According to Montealegre, an unknown element is 
which way APRE presidential aspirant Jose Antonio Alvarado 
will swing -- towards Montealegre, or Rizo.  Montealegre 
confirmed that he continues to negotiate with Alvarado, but 
Alvarado's demands are unreasonable, e.g., insisting that in 
addition to being his running mate, which Montealegre would 
accept, Alvarado seeks at least 12 National Assembly seats 
for his APRE followers -- an untenable proposition. 
Nonetheless, Montealegre was optimistic that ultimately 
Alvarado will side with him, noting that Aleman will at best 
offer Alvarado to serve as Nicaragua's ambassador to the 
United States.  (Comment:  Alvarado adviser Ariel Granera 
shared with us last week that if a broad Liberal alliance 
does not materialize, Alvarado will risk his fate with 
Montealegre.  On April 25, Granera commented that 
negotiations between Alvarado and Montealegre continue and 
that Alvarado is inclined to run as the first Assembly deputy 
on Montealegre's ticket if he can persuade Montealegre to 
allow him enough Assembly seats for his supporters.  End 
Comment.) 
 
MIXED SIGNALS FROM NEIGHBORS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -- 
 
¶11.  (C) Montealegre regretted that Salvadoran President Saca 
is risk adverse and believes Rizo is the safer bet.  However, 
he was encouraged that Guatemalan President Berger favors 
Montealegre.  According to Montealegre, Costa Rican President 
Arias is likely to tacitly endorse Ortega because Ortega has 
signaled to Arias that he will be "flexible" with Costa Rica 
 
in its bid for greater access to the San Juan River. 
 
MONTEALEGRE-HERTY POISED TO SIGN GOVERNANCE ACCORD 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶12.  (C) Montealegre shared that his relations with 
Sandinista dissident Herty Lewites are generally positive and 
that they might sign a governance alliance shortly before 
November.  He explained that if either candidate wins the 
presidency, the accord would commit both parties to 
collaborate on the other's governmental priorities. 
 
THE CHAVEZ FACTOR 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶13.  (C) To Montealegre, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's 
fertilizer, oil, and medical support initiatives are designed 
to help Ortega win the election, both in terms of drawing 
public sympathy and in channeling funds to Ortega's campaign. 
 (Comment:  On April 25, Montealegre commented to polcouns 
Chavez' televised attack against him during the April 25 oil 
cooperation signing ceremony between Chavez and 153 
Nicaraguan mayors will play in Montealegre's favor.  He 
explained that during the ceremony, Chavez defined 
Montealegre as Sandinista (FSLN) leader Daniel Ortega's 
presidential competitor, not Liberal Constitutional Party 
(PLC) candidate Jose Rizo.  (Note: Chavez, who openly 
endorsed Ortega (exclaiming, "Daniel, how is the campaign 
going over there?  I hope you win"), lambasted Montealegre 
after reading a La Prensa article featuring Montealegre's 
criticism of Chavez's interventionism in Nicaraguan affairs.)
