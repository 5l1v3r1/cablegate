SUBJECT: EXBS: UPDATE OF NP COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE 
AGREEMENT 
 
REF: ANKARA 3358 
 
¶1.  This is an action cable.  See para 5. 
 
¶2.  We received a diplomatic note from the MFA dated December 
14, 2005 concerning the Agreement Between the Government of 
the Republic of Turkey and the Government of the United 
States of America Regarding Cooperation to Facilitate the 
Provision of Assistance for Non Proliferation Purposes (the 
EXBS Agreement).  This Agreement was signed on June 14, 2005 
and sent to the Turkish Parliament for ratification.  The MFA 
note states that the Foreign Relations Committee of the 
Turkish Grand National Assembly wants a change in the title 
of the Agreement with a view to ensuring a better 
understanding by the Turkish public, by the inclusion with 
Turkish text, the words "Weapons of Mass Destruction".  The 
new suggested title for the Agreement would be "Agreement 
Between the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the 
Government of the United States of America Regarding 
Cooperation to Facilitate the Provision of Assistance for 
Weapons of Mass Destruction Non Proliferation Purposes". 
 
¶3.  The note states that the change of title could be 
accomplished by replacing the first page of the Agreement, 
since the text of the Agreement remains the same.  This 
change could take effect with the exchange of diplomatic 
notes.  Finally, if we agree, the received note is to be 
considered as consent by the GOT to the proposed amendment in 
the Turkish and English titles of the Agreement.  We have 
faxed the note to the Department (EUR/SE and ISN/ECC). 
 
¶4.  Comment: Parliament was concerned about the ambiguity of 
the Turkish translation of "nonproliferation."  This 
suggested title change does not effect the text or the focus 
of the Agreement.  We recommend accepting the requested 
change. End comment. 
 
¶5.  Action requested: Post requests instruction as to whether 
we can accept the change to the Agreement title and 
substitute title pages as suggested by MFA or do we need to 
produce a new document with new original signatures.
