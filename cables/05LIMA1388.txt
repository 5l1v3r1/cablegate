SIPDIS 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV PINS PHUM ASEC PE
SUBJECT: GOP EXTENDS STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR 60 MORE DAYS 
 
 
¶1.  Via a Supreme Decree signed by President Toledo on March 
18, the Government extended for two more months the State of 
Emergency first declared in May of 2003.  The Presidential 
Decree carried over the State of Emergency in the same 
geographic area covered by the most recent extension, dated 
January 19.  The areas affected are six provinces and 
districts located in the departments of Ayacucho, 
Huancavelica, Cusco and Junin.  An accompanying Supreme 
Resolution, also signed by the President, carried the 
determination that the Armed Forces would be responsible for 
maintaining internal order in the affected locations, and 
that the National Police would support the military's efforts. 
 
¶2.  The area where the State of Emergency continues to exist 
includes some of Peru's most remote regions, where there is 
little official presence.  The four departments affected have 
large areas dedicated to coca cultivation, and in some 
locations continue to witness sporadic activity on the part 
of Sendero Luminoso.
