SUBJECT: CHILE MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ 
 
Â¶1. On December 18, business and financial "Diario Financiero" (circ. 
30,000) carried a column by international commentator Libardo 
Buitrago entitled "Iraq: Peace Options."  Quote: 
 
"It took President Bush three years...to realize that the war in 
Iraq cannot be separated from the regional context....  The Baker 
Commission concluded that the complex equation today must include 
Syria and Iran.... To realists, Iran and Syria are potential allies 
in the stabilization of Iraq; to many Republicans that would mean 
yielding to terrorists.  Bush does not need to implement what the 
(commission) report recommends, but it does offer him a chance to 
correct the path of his unsuccessful war strategy -- one that 
already has cost him an unprecedented decrease in popularity and a 
tough electoral defeat in Congress, and could cost his party the 
2008 Presidential election."
