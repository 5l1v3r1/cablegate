¶1. There follows below in para.2, Embassy Madrid's assessment 
of U.S. services market priorities in Spain and market 
openness.  This analysis was largely conducted by the USCS 
based on experiences with American firms doing business in 
Spain.  We found the market openness rating difficult to 
make.  In most cases, where a category was ranked "low", it 
was due to informal, non-transparent barriers, rather than 
transparent regulations.  For example, there are no 
legal/regulatory barriers for U.S. construction service 
companies, but the likelihood of non-Spanish firms winning 
construction contracts in Spain is virtually nil.
