REF: A. BEIJING 331 B. STATE 4837 (NOTAL)

Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission David S. Sedney. Reasons 1.4 (a , b, d, e and g)

¶1. (S) Delivering the Chinese Governments formal response to our January 15 demarche on Chinas ASAT test, Assistant Foreign Minister He Yafei told Assistant Secretary Hill January 21 that the test poses no threat to any other nation, targeted no third country and that "for the time being, China has no plans for further tests." AFM He provided this information during a wider meeting on overall bilateral issues at the Diaoyutai State Guest House (other discussions reported septel). AFM He added that China continues to support the peaceful use and non-weaponization of outer space and never has and never will participate in an arms race in space. To implement the consensus President Bush and President Hu reached regarding civil use of outer space, the Chinese side remains ready to enhance coordination and communication, AFM He said. A/S Hill pressed AFM He to elaborate on what kind of test China conducted and its purpose, but AFM He said he has no authorization to discuss details.

¶2. (S) A/S Hill, underlining the significance of the issue, stressed that our information indicates Chinas action constituted a military test of an anti- satellite system. Our concern is that the test is at odds with the constructive relationship President Bush and President Hu pledged to pursue on civil space cooperation. In addition, the United States is concerned that the test created a debris field that could affect other satellites using that orbit. The debris field could also endanger human space flight and harm scientific research. Pointing out that AFM Hes comments are the first official response we have heard on the matter, A/S Hill emphasized that the explanation does not square with Chinas stated position of not wishing to embark on any kind of arms race in outer space. A/S Hill cautioned AFM He that the United States knows what happened and that we remain concerned that China has not adequately explained the true purpose of the test.

¶3. (S) A/S Hill stated that the last thing the United States wants is to have an arms race in outer space with China. He pointed out that the provocative nature of the test raises questions that China will have to answer. Taking note of the position and concerns of the United States, AFM He said he had no further information but promised to report "to the relevant authorities."

¶4. (S) A/S Hill also raised our concerns about the ASAT test with Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei at a subsequent dinner on January 21, noting that AFM Hes explanation was unsatisfactory. A visibly uncomfortable VFM Wu said that the Australian and Japanese Ambassadors had raised the test with him. Wu said he and others at the MFA knew nothing about the test and deflected further questioning by claiming that "this is outside my portfolio."
