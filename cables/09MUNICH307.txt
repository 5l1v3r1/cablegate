SUBJECT: GERMANY/MUNICH SECURITY CONFERENCE:  SCENE SETTER 
FOR THE FEBRUARY 5 - 7, 2010 CONFERENCE 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 
¶13.  The 46th annual Munich Security Conference (MSC) runs 
from Friday afternoon, February 5, 2010 to mid-day Sunday, 
February 7, 2010, at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich. 
The draft agenda, which follows at paragraph 9 (NOTE: please 
protect, subject to change) promises discussions on resource 
security, European security, arms control and the NPT, 
prospects for Middle East peace, and the future of NATO.  The 
annual Munich Security Conference is famous for its informal 
atmosphere, unofficial character, and high-level participants 
from government, the military, the diplomatic corps, the 
media and academia in over 45 countries and five 
international organizations.  More than 70 heads of state or 
government and foreign and defense ministers normally attend. 
 Nevertheless, the MSC is not a Summit.  An informal and 
exclusive setting, it promotes lively debate and dialogue and 
creates rich opportunities for bilateral consultations at any 
time on the margins.  The organizers have invited a range of 
USG leaders, including Vice President Biden, Secretaries 
Clinton, Gates, and Chu, as well as Senators McCain, 
Lieberman, Lugar and Kerry, among others.  End Summary. 
 
The US has a Special Relationship to the MSC 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The German MSC organizers, now chaired by 
Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger, acknowledge repeatedly the 
special US-German relationship at this conference and they 
will maintain it even as the MSC agenda broadens.  Since the 
beginning -- 46 years ago -- the German hosts have worked 
closely with the United States as a partner in producing the 
conference.  Seeing us as the "first delegation among 
equals," they have ensured us prime speaking slots, ample 
seats in the Plenary hall, and accommodation of special 
requests.  In exchange, subject to the guest list drawn up by 
the organizers, the United States has always proven its 
importance by sending a high-level delegation, composed of 
Cabinet officers, prominent politicians, senior diplomats, 
and military leaders, as well as academics, media 
representatives, and private Americans representing 
themselves or non-governmental organizations.  Ambassador 
Ischinger, former German Ambassador to Washington and London, 
believes that Senators McCain and Lieberman will organize a 
CODEL in 2010 as they have in past years.  The MSC has 
invited UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon; NATO Secretary 
General Rasmussen has already accepted. Chancellor Merkel 
will participate, joined by leaders from the European Union 
and from other regions.  The MSC believes Russia's delegation 
could be the prelude to President Medvedev's coming in 2011. 
The organizers expect high-level USG speakers will address 
the MSC at appropriate, prominent places in the program. 
These speaking opportunities will emerge in bilateral 
discussions as the conference plans mature. (NOTE: Ambassador 
Ischinger bio: https://www.intelink.gov/diplopedia/ 
 index.pthp?title=Category:Germany Biography.) 
 
 
The Traditional Conference Rejuvenates 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) US Invitees: 
 
In addition to official representatives of the Administration 
and Congress, the MSC regularly invites other influential 
Americans.  Private participating Americans, such as former 
Secretaries of State Kissinger and Albright, former National 
Security Advisors, and former members of Congress can be 
affiliated with the CODEL or USDEL, making this event unique 
 
MUNICH 00000307  002 OF 004 
 
 
in many respects.  Other delegations are similarly rich with 
notable participants in the security and foreign policy 
fields. Though the conference itself is closed to press, 
there is a rich media presence reporting from the margins. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) To stimulate fresh thinking and with an eye to the 
future, Ambassador Ischinger continues work begun last year 
on rejuvenating the MSC while retaining its exclusive, 
informal character.  He is considering how to shake up the 
roster of habitual participants somewhat by including new 
faces and more younger leaders from a wider variety of 
backgrounds while still including the most important security 
policy leaders who have come for years. We understand that 
his approach has already resulted in some disappointment on 
the part of former participants who have not been invited 
this year.  He is also widening the focus from transatlantic 
and European security issues to include other global issues 
affecting international peace and stability, such as energy. 
He has secured financial support from Linde and BMW and seeks 
other corporate sponsors.  Finally, to broaden the exposure 
of the MSC to the fresh ideas, he will continue with the 
Young Leaders Roundtable on Security Policy that will convene 
a day earlier, on February 4, and run through the MSC. 
 
 
¶5. (U) Bilateral Consultations for USG Principals: 
 
The MSC presents many opportunities for bilateral 
consultations between members of the USDEL and members of 
other delegations. ConGen Munich will make appropriate 
logistical arrangements to facilitate these meetings, 
including opportunities for social networking and internet 
presences, as appropriate. 
 
¶6. (SBU) SecDef Cocktail Reception: 
 
Mission Germany recalls the successful cocktail reception 
hosted in the past by the Secretary of Defense for Members of 
the German Bundestag (Parliament) and suggests repeating it 
this year, if time permits, and considering adding other 
selected guests, as appropriate. 
 
¶7. (SBU) High-Level Meeting with the Bavarian CSU: 
 
The MSC organizers and the Bavarian Christian Social Union 
(CSU) political party are already planning a repeat of the 
popular meeting between CSU representatives and senior 
members of the US Delegation on the Friday morning, before 
the official opening of the conference.  The CSU is a member 
of the Federal coalition government.  This has become a 
sold-out event since first instituted in 2006.  Defense 
Minister General Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, of the CSU, has 
been invited to lead the discussion. (Zu Guttenberg's 
unclassified bio: http://intelink.gov/diplopedia/ 
index.php?title=Karl Theodor Freiherr zu Guttenberg) 
 
High-Level Invitees from Other Countries 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) In addition to German Chancellor Merkel, German 
Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle and Defense Minister 
Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg could be expected to lead the 
German delegation.  The MSC organizers (please protect) 
believe that the Russian Federation is signaling that 
President Medvedev will come next year, in 2011, in the 
run-up to the Russian presidential elections, and that this 
year the Russian delegation would be led by a prominent 
member of the government.  Russian PM Putin has not been 
invited.  Afghan Foreign Minister Spanta is invited. 
Georgian President Saakashvili has not been invited. Iranian 
participation is not yet clear.

¶10.  (SBU) Conference Facilities 
 
The MSC will again use the Bayerischer Hof Hotel as its 
headquarters and main conference venue.  Seating, and 
therefore invitations to participants in the conference, will 
be extremely limited again this year as the conference 
organizers intend to maintain the intimate character of the 
MSC and they must also respect the size limits of the venue. 
There are 300 seats for participants this year, down from 
¶350.  (Note: The MSC will not use public conference rooms for 
meetings outside the hotel as it did last year but will use 
that space to house the press.) Conference organizers consult 
closely with the Bavarian and German authorities on security 
arrangements and work closely with the RSO and Consulate 
staff. 
 
¶11.  (U) Munich Young Leaders Round Table on Security Policy 
(YLR), February 4 - 7: 
 
For a pre-conference event, the MSC has again invited 25 
young leaders (from Germany, NATO member states, Partnership 
for Peace Member States, Member States in the Mediterranean 
Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative) to come to 
Munich one day earlier for a program and debate forum 
designed especially for them.  On the morning of February 5, 
the MSC hopes that a high-level member or members from the US 
Delegation will address the Young Leaders before the formal 
opening of the MSC that afternoon. The Young Leaders then 
join the MSC as Observers after their own program ends.  The 
Koerber Foundation is organizing the YLR (Official link to 
the Young Leaders Roundtable: 
www.koerber-Stiftung.de/en/international-affa irs/ 
munich-young-leaders.html). 
 
¶12.  (U)  Planning Ahead for Funding for MSC costs: 
Supporting a large, complex conference like the MSC with many 
high-level USDEL members comes with unique costs for the USG. 
Fund cites for travelers and normal program funds cover most 
of the additional costs.  However, Mission Germany wishes to 
draw the attention of the Department that there will be new 
costs this year for bilateral consultation and delegation 
control rooms.  In the past, the MSC provided these free of 
charge, but no longer.  This year, these rooms will cost 
approximately USD 6000 (five converted hotel rooms for three 
nights at USD 400 per night). 
 
¶13.  (U)  Action request:  Mission Germany strongly favors 
early decisions on participation by a strong US Delegation 
lead by senior Administration and Congressional officials. 
We note that the MSC falls one week after the London 
Afghanistan conference and could be a prime venue for follow 
up and nailing down support. 
 
¶14.  (U)  Consulate General Munich coordinated this cable 
with Embassy Berlin.
