SUBJECT: GERMANY H1N1 FLU UPDATE: 527 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 808, B) Berlin 795 and previous. 
 
¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: The net number of H1N1 infections in 
Germany rose by 57 cases over the weekend to a total of 527 on 
July 6. We are hearing our first reports of Amcit infections 
in Germany.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its press briefings 
over the weekend a total of 61 new laboratory-confirmed cases 
of H1N1, and subtracted four previously confirmed cases.  This 
net increase of fifty-seven cases brings the total number of 
virus cases in Germany to 527. Four H1N1 infections previously 
confirmed in the states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Bavaria 
were rescinded. 
 
 
New Infections in Berlin involving Amcits 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU)  On July 6, RKI confirmed H1N1 in one 17-year old 
German girl and three US students from Texas, who are 
currently on an exchange program at the Alexander-von-Humboldt 
Gymnasium in Koepenick (Berlin). This raises the total number 
of confirmed infections in the city to nine.  The students 
first showed flu-like symptoms on July 2.  They were sent home 
and treated with the antiviral medication, Tamiflu. Media 
reports indicate that the US students caught the flu in 
Germany. They were reportedly scheduled to return to the US 
this weekend, but their travel has been postponed until 
further notice. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Berlin health authorities also reported on July 6 
that an additional four students from the same high school are 
infected with the new flu. These cases have not yet been 
confirmed by RKI.  All students are under quarantine at home 
and are being treated with Tamiflu.  After meeting with 
doctors and school leaders, Berlin health officials reportedly 
decided to temporarily close the school as a precautionary 
measure.  Parents were informed about the measures in a letter 
published on the website of the school, which has 
approximately 660 pupils. Berlin health officials expect 
further virus cases. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The Mission Consular Section is actively following 
up on reports of further H1N1 infections in Germany involving 
Amcits.  A group of 50 students is reportedly quarantined in a 
hotel in Heidelberg because five of them were tested positive 
for H1N1.  Of that group, two are reportedly showing 
symptoms.  German authorities believe that the group will be 
able to start their European tour up again in a week, assuming 
everyone tests negative. In addition, some Amcit students 
traveling with a tour group to Ludwigshafen have reportedly 
also been tested positive for the new flu.  The students are 
currently under quarantine at their hotel.
