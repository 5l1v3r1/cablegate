     ¶B. MCGANN/POLASCHIK E-MAIL OF 3/15/04 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1.  As requested, refcoord phoned UNHCR Iraq Head of Mission 
Yacoub El Hillo (resident in Amman) on March 14 to deliver 
ref a points regarding a follow-on meeting to the February 
15-16 UNHCR strategic planning meeting for Iraq.  El Hillo 
confirmed that he intends to convene a follow-on meeting in 
the first half of April in Amman.  El Hillo is planning a 
small, expert-level meeting, with participation limited to 
members of the UN's "Cluster 8," NGO representation, Iraqi 
authorities and key donors, including PRM.  He does not 
intend to include Iraqi Minister of Displacement and 
Migration Al Otbee in the meeting.  El Hillo acknowledged he 
also needs to schedule a briefing of interested donors to 
present funding needs related to the strategy and agreed with 
refcoord's suggestion that the briefing would reach a wider 
audience if it were held in Geneva instead of Amman.  El 
Hillo will discuss the donor briefing with Minister Al Otbee 
on March 17. 
 
¶2.  Per ref b, we understand that USG participation in this 
meeting will be limited to two PRM officials (one from 
Washington and one from CPA Baghdad).  Due to the high volume 
of visitors expected in the first half of April, we are able 
to accommodate this meeting only during the week of April 5. 
Refcoord has conveyed our scheduling requirements to 
UNHCR-Iraq. 
 
¶3.  Per ref b, we understand PRM will raise this issue with 
UN SRSG a.i. Ross Mountain in Washington later this week. 
 
¶4.  CPA Baghdad minimize considered.
