E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/11/2016 
TAGS: PGOV PHUM PREL PTER
SUBJECT: CLARIFYING DECREE ON JUSTICE AND PEACE LAW 

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 

¶1.  (C) Ambassador Wood raised U.S. concerns with the GOC,s
draft implementing decree clarifying the Constitutional 
Court,s July 13 ruling on the Justice and Peace Law (JPL) in 
an August 8 meeting with GOC Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos 
Restrepo and an August 9 session with former Foreign Minister 
and Ambassador Designate to the United States Carolina Barco. 
 In both meetings, the Ambassador stressed the regulations 
should: 

-- maintain the Constitutional Court,s ruling that 
demobilized paramilitaries would receive no benefits under 
the JPL for any crime for which they are subsequently 
convicted in an ordinary court that they did not disclose; 
--require demobilized paramilitaries to turn over all of 
their illicit assets to qualify for JPL benefits and to 
surrender licit assets, if their illicit assets are 
insufficient, to satisfy a judicial determination of the 
amount they owe in reparations; 
--not address the issue of where demobilized paramilitaries 
should serve their alternative sentences; and 
--not preclude or jeopardize the possibility of extradition 
in any way. 

¶2.  (C) Restrepo and Barco appreciated the Ambassador,s
input and promised to forward them to the GOC officials 
working on the draft.
