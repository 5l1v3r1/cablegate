SUBJECT: BASHIR LASHES OUT AGAINST WEST IN GEDARIF RALLY 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a November 6 rally in Gedarif State, President Bashir 
lashed out against the West and accused it of trying to "destroy" 
Sudan, according to Sudanese media reports. "Money and power are not 
in the hands of the U.S, Britain and France," the President was 
quoted as saying. Using an insult that in this part of the world 
signifies absolute contempt, he added: "They are all beneath my 
shoes." He continued that Sudan would not bow down to anyone, and 
"whoever wants to fight us can go ahead and lick his elbow" (a 
metaphor for an act of futility.)  Bashir also accused Western 
countries of conspiring to hinder Sudan's development, and asserted 
that "everyday, we will respond with a new development project in 
water services, education, health and dams." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bashir railed against the ICC and dismissed its Chief 
Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, as a stooge for western powers. "Do 
not worry about what Ocampo says. He is weak, and his decisions are 
made by his masters in the United States, Britain and France," said 
Bashir. "These are the people we target, and they target us too," he 
added. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Influential Presidential Advisor Dr. Nafie Ali Nafie had a 
slightly different take on Sudan's relationship with the West in a 
recent interview with Tunisian newspaper Al Sabah. Nafie accused the 
Bush administration of trying to impose its will on Sudan, and 
stated that "we hope the new US administration will pursue the 
language of mutual respect [in dealing with Sudan] rather than 
hegemony," adding that "if Obama's administration pursues this 
track, we believe relations can improve." Like Bashir, Nafie also 
refuted what he said were allegations of a lack of development in 
Darfur, characterizing them as falsehoods perpetuated by the media. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) CDA Fernandez spoke on November 10 to Presidential Advisor 
Mustafa Othman Ismail about Bashir's comments. The smooth-talking 
Ismail discounted the remarks as "the President speaking to his 
base," and added, "look at what we are doing not what words may be 
used in one speech." He highlighted Sudan's current phase of 
cooperation with UNAMID, willingness to cooperate with the U.S., a 
quiet spell in CPA cooperation, and efforts to forge a peace process 
in Darfur through the widespread consultation of the Sudan People's 
Initiative (SPI) and possible talks in Doha with the Darfuri rebels. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: President Bashir often makes fiery speeches at 
mass rallies that do not reflect his more considered views, and 
those close to him admit privately that he often gets carried away 
in front of a crowd (Dr. Ismail is always ready with this 
explanation). In this context, the Gedarif speech would seem less 
menacing than it might appear, but post will continue to monitor 
public forums for similar comments made by senior government 
officials, especially as the likely ICC indictment approaches.  The 
regime has been surprisingly understated lately in its rhetoric.  At 
least for now, it is generally taking a conciliatory and pro-active 
approach in trying to portray an image of progress and forward 
motion towards peace in Darfur and CPA implementation, while at the 
same time leaving ample space for escalation, should a harder line 
be necessary after an ICC indictment.
