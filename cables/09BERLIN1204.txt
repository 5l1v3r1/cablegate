(SBU)   EconOff delivered reftel points to Simon Koppers, 
head of the office responsible for health, economic 
cooperation and development at the German Ministry for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).  According to 
Koppers, Germany's 20 million euro donation to assist 
developing countries in fighting H1N1 is part of the BMZ 
budget,not that of the Ministry of Health. The donation will 
fund logistical support. Germany is not providing H1N1 
vaccine because it was told that the World Health 
Organization (WHO) has a sufficient vaccine supply.  Mr. 
Koppers can be reached at simon.koppers@bmz.bund.de or
