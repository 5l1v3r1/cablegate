SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. (C) In a meeting on January 24 with LABOFF, leaders from 
Colombia's largest banker's union and its labor confederation 
claimed that exiled labor leaders with guerrilla affiliations 
are behind a Danish T-shirt sales campaign, whose proceeds 
reportedly are destined for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (PFLP). End Summary.

PRO-FARC EXILED LABOR LEADERS TAKE STRUGGLE TO EUROPE

¶2. (S) On January 24, LABOFF met with four prominent union 
leaders, who said extremist elements of the Colombian labor 
movement are using their asylum status in Europe to promote 
and raise funds for the guerrilla movement.  The union 
leaders (XXXXXXXXXXXX) claim that many of these 
asylees were affiliated with the United Confederation of 
Workers (CUT), Colombia's largest labor confederation. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that the CUT is heavily penetrated by 
extreme leftist unions and elements affiliated with both the 
FARC and the National Liberation Army (ELN).

¶3. (S) According to the labor leaders, these exiled 
extremists are behind a T-shirt sales campaign, whose 
proceeds are reportedly destined for the FARC. In early 
January, a Danish firm, Fighters and Lovers, announced it 
would donate 5 euros (approximately USD6)to the FARC and the 
PFLP from each T-shirt sold, to help finance radio stations 
and graphics workshops run by these groups.  The FARC 
T-shirts contain FARC initials and the image of an AK-47. 
The PFLP T-shirts also contain that group's initials and two 
hands pointing an automatic weapon.  The website explains 
that the company is "greatly in debt to the funky outrageous 
style of Colombian guerrilla commander Jacobo Arenas," states 
that "young people, unionists, teachers, and even priests 
have taken up arms to join the biggest guerrilla army Latin 
America has ever seen: the FARC," and asks, "When was the 
last time someone told you what you could not wear?"

CTC LEADER IMPLICATES OIL WORKER'S UNION EX-PRESIDENT 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 

¶4. (S) In a follow-up meeting with LABOFF on January 25, XXXXXXXXXXXX said Cesar Carrillo, 
former president of Ecopetrol's labor union, the Syndicated 
Union of Workers (USO), was the main driver of the T-shirt 
campaign.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said ELN members allegedly founded USO, 
and according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the union still has both ELN and 
FARC influences.  XXXXXXXXXXXX explained that Carrillo sought 
asylum in Norway approximately five years ago because he had 
been jailed, and later wanted, by Colombian authorities for 
terrorist associations.  When asked how he knew Carrillo was 
leading the campaign, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the information had 
come from a Dutch labor contact and NGO leader, Lulu de Ven, 
but said that "many have long known" that exiled labor 
leaders in Europe actively run a propaganda campaign there 
against the Government of Colombia.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said although 
ACEB is one of the most leftist-oriented unions in the CTC, 
it strongly opposes violence and has no sympathy toward its 
more radical brethren in the CUT.

EUROPE: AN ATTRACTIVE DESTINATION FOR LABOR EXTREMISTS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 

¶5. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX described Europe as a haven for labor 
leaders with guerrilla sympathies and/or involvement because 
the "Europeans are well-intentioned, but very gullible." 
XXXXXXXXXXXX said separately that since Norway granted Carrillo 
asylum, he has been traveling throughout Europe, particularly 
in Benelux countries, using his "visibility" and "eloquence" 
to rail against imperialism and for the nationalization of 
oil in Colombia, drumming up support for the FARC and ELN.

COMMENT

¶6. (S) The charges against the ex-labor leaders in Europe are 
difficult to confirm.  But it is rare for these ideologically 
diverse leaders to agree.  End Comment
