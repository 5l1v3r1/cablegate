Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The local press runs prominent coverage of the first meeting of the 
newly elected Fatah Central Committee and Revolutionary Council in 
Ramallah on August 16. Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud 
Abbas reiterated that the Palestinian Authority and Fatah are 
committed to pursuing a national unity dialogue with Hamas and will 
work hard towards establishing an independent Palestinian state on 
the 1967 borders. Abbas noted that an extraordinary session of the 
Palestinian National Council will be held in Ramallah on August 
26-27 to elect 6 new members to fill the current vacancies of the 
Central Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). 
Abbas also stressed that the PA is ready to immediately pursue 
negotiations with Israel if the latter completely halts settlement 
activity. 
 
News on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's visit to Washington on 
August 18 receives front page coverage in the three dailies. The 
reports quote Egyptian Presidency Spokesperson Sulaiman Awwad saying 
that Mubarak will communicate the Arab vision for achieving peace in 
the Middle East with President Obama so that he can take it into 
consideration prior to announcing the anticipated US peace plan next 
month. 
 
Al-Quds runs front page news citing a CNN interview with the Israeli 
Ambassador to the US Michael Oren during which he noted that any 
land exchange deal with the Palestinian Authority "within the final 
status settlement" will likely include exchanging Arab areas located 
inside Israel.

Weekend Stories: 
------------- 
 
Sunday, August 16: 
 
All dailies front page stories on the clashes in Rafah during which 
28 were killed and more than 130 were injured. The PA announced that 
it was following the events in the Gaza Strip with great concern. 
Reports note that the PA stressed that these clashes were a natural 
result of the Hamas takeover in Gaza that divided the homeland and 
led to the absence of a legitimate authority. The PA also stated 
that Hamas has adopted policies that create an atmosphere conducive 
to the emergence of fundamentalist groups that do not represent true 
Islam and the real values and ideals of the Palestinian people. 
 
All dailies front page news that President Abbas closed the 
proceedings of the sixth Fatah party conference in Bethlehem 
following the announcement of the 81 winners of the election for the 
movement's Revolutionary Council on August 15. 
 
All dailies also front page news on the PLO Executive Committee's 
meeting August 15 chaired by President Abbas. The Executive 
Committee made a statement following its meeting denouncing the 
killings and destruction in Gaza by Hamas that are increasing the 
suffering of the people and dividing the unity of the homeland. The 
Committee also stressed that the only option for the success of the 
national dialogue is to hold legislative and presidential elections, 
as well as elections for the Palestinian National Council, at the 
beginning of next year. Furthermore, the Executive Committee stated 
that it is seriously considering calling for a UN Security Council 
 
JERUSALEM 00001443  002 OF 003 
 
 
session to address the "on-going Israeli violations" in Jerusalem 
and throughout the Palestinian Territories. 
 
Saturday, August 15: 
 
All dailies front page news on fierce armed clashes that broke out 
August 14 in Rafah governerate between Hamas security forces in Gaza 
and armed militants from the "Jund Ansar Allah" (Army of the 
Partisans of God), a Salafist group. According to different sources, 
the clashes broke out following the Friday sermon by the Imam of Ibn 
Taimiyyah mosque Sheikh Abdul Latif Mousa, during which he attacked 
Hamas and declared the establishment of an Islamic principality in 
Gaza. Hamas Spokesperson Taher Nounou held Abdul Latif Mousa and his 
followers responsible for what happened as a result of his 
irresponsible declaration during the Friday sermon. Nounou added 
that "we will not allow the state of lawlessness to return under any 
circumstances." Nounou demanded all followers of this group to hand 
over their weapons and surrender to the police. Ismail Haniyyeh, 
head of Hamas in Gaza, denied reports that his government is taking 
an extremist Islamist approach to govern Gaza and added "the Hamas 
movement in Palestine is a centrist and moderate movement with clear 
and defined objectives." Haniyyeh also stressed the need for 
reconciliation and agreement prior to Palestinian general elections, 
but added "our movement does not trust the Fatah leadership to 
conduct fair elections in the West Bank." 
 
All dailies run front page coverage on PA Prime Minister Salam 
Fayyad stating in an interview with Israeli newspaper Haaretz that 
the character of the State of Israel is an Israeli affair and not 
for Palestinians to define. Fayyad's statements came in the context 
of responding to demands by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu for the PA to recognize Israel as a Jewish state as a 
pre-condition for resuming negotiations. Fayyad added "the way 
Israel wants to define itself is an Israeli matter; it can describe 
and define itself in the manner that it pleases." Fayyad also said 
"the Oslo agreements did not include this condition and I do not see 
any space for adding new conditions or pre-conditions for 
negotiations now." Additionally, Fayyad stressed that he is seeking 
to prove to the world that the Palestinian people are capable of 
building their own state. 
 
All dailies also run front page coverage on Israeli sources stating 
that secret negotiations took place recently between senior US and 
Israeli officials to reach an agreement for freezing settlement 
activities. The sources said that the main disagreements were the 
length of the freeze and the conditions under which Israel can 
resume construction. Reports note that the US wants an Israeli 
commitment to freeze settlement activities for two years, with the 
understanding that this would be the period during which 
negotiations over final status issues will be conducted. Netanyahu 
reportedly refused this idea and said Israel will only agree to 
freeze settlement activities for three months and if the Arab side 
fails to fulfil their commitments to normalize relations with 
Israel, Israel would be absolved of its commitments and will resume 
settlement activities.------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"Towards a new phase of national unity" (08/17):  "All Palestinian 
factions including Hamas and Fatah must realize how valuable it is 
at this stage to end the division and to prioritize the interests of 
their people. They should understand that it is extremely important 
 
JERUSALEM 00001443  003 OF 003 
 
 
that we appear united to the international community, with a unified 
position and unified power. Only then will we stand a chance to 
achieve our goals to have our state." 
 
2) Atef Abu Seif opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
headline "Fatah mission has started" (08/17): "Fatah has 
successfully concluded its sixth conference, but the real work has 
s 
only started ... it has to work on many difficult issues. It has to 
regain people's trust and confidence. It needs to not only make 
statements but do real work. If it fails to do so right away, it 
will be lost forever."
