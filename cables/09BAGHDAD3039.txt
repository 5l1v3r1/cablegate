The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton

Dear Madam Secretary, 
 
On behalf of the Iraq National Investment Commission (NIC) 
and the business community of Iraq, I would like to thank you 
for joining us at last week's U.S. - Iraq Business and 
Investment Conference in Washington, D.C., for your address 
to the many participants, and for your manifest support for 
our mission. 
 
I appreciate in particular your very positive focus on Iraq's 
potential across the board.  I feel that your emphasis set 
exactly the right tone and perspective for the audience and 
for the moment.  Our progress in establishing a stable 
environment for investment has been very broad, as you 
pointed out.  Our way forward is also quite clear, and your 
encouragement was telling and on target.  Your message rang 
very true: With the necessary work proceeding on all these 
fronts, Iraq is truly open for business and full of 
opportunities.  We are at a crossroads in our journey to an 
Iraq that is a peaceful and productive member of the 
community of nations. 
 
Please allow me as well to express to you personally my 
thanks for your support for the priorities and opportunities 
that we discussed at the conference.  It is very heartening 
to know of your personal interest in what we plan and hope to 
do in both the near and longer term, especially the housing 
project.  Undersecretary Hormats phoned me and relayed your 
support for us to realize this project, and I am grateful for 
it. 
 
Please accept my warmest regards, 
 
Very truly yours, 
 
Dr. Sami Al-Araji, Chairman 
Iraqi National Investment Commission
