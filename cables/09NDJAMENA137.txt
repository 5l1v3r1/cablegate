     ¶B. EMBASSY-DESK 04/20/2009 EMAIL 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In order to help the Chad Government to avoid 
sanctions because of TIP provisions, we are engaged in 
executing an action plan, which we first informed Department 
in REF A. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Background:  GOC Actions to Date:  The most recent 
in the GOC's efforts to address trafficking in persons issues 
in Chad are: 
 
--The Council of Ministers adopted the "Palermo Convention 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children," on April 9.  The 
protocol will be sent to the National Assembly for 
parliamentary adoption. 
 
--The Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime will 
be presented to the Council of Ministers for adoption April 
23 and will follow the same path as the Palermo Protocol. 
 
--The Ministry of Justice and UNICEF are planning an April 
28-30 seminar for parliamentarians to raise awareness of the 
draft legislations and garner support for their passage. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Embassy TIP Compliance Action Plan has two tracks: 
 
------- 
Track I 
------- 
 
-- This involves a concerted effort by Embassy officers with 
relevant GOC ministries and agencies, in coordination with 
our partners (MINURCAT, UNICEF and ICRC). 
 
--The Ambassador has already requested to see the President 
of the Republic to brief him on the importance of meeting TIP 
criteria, especially regarding Child Soldiers.  The 
Ambassador pre-briefed the President's chief Advisor on 
International Relations and Cooperation on April 20. 
 
--Prime Minister:  DCM briefed PM Diplomatic Advisor Ramadan 
Barma April 16 on issuing popular decrees and speeding up 
ongoing work within other Ministries. 
 
--Ambassador met with SRSG for MINURCAT Victor Angelo April 
20 to request coordinated UN system action on child soldiers 
and to explore ways the international community's efforts in 
general could be coordinated (French, Germans, Swiss). 
 
--Foreign Minister:  Ambassador met Foreign Minister Moussa 
Faki Mahamat April 10 to press for accession to international 
protocols and conventions on child welfare and 
anti-trafficking, lack of which is one factor preventing 
progress on the child protection code. 
 
--Ministry of Justice:  Embassy has begun to hold regular 
meetings to refine goals with respect to revising Chad,s 
penal code, and will devise a schedule for visits by 
U.S.-based experts who can work with Chadians to establish a 
new and more suitable list of benchmarks on trafficking. 
 
--National Assembly:  Embassy will meet regularly to press 
for progress on legislative steps, including passage of 
amendments to Chad,s Penal Code and passage of a code on 
child protection. 
 
--Ministry of Labor:  Embassy will coordinate on initiatives 
to tighten enforcement on existing laws prohibiting child 
labor. 
 
--Defense Ministry:  Ambassador has requested a meeting with 
the Minister to call for issuance of a decree announcing 
strict enforcement of existing laws prohibiting child 
soldiers. 
 
--Ministry of Social Affairs:  Poloff met with newly 
appointed Secretary General Saklah Djimadoungar April 20 to 
press for more GOC support to victims of trafficking. 
 
--Key Partners:  Embassy will coordinate with MINURCAT, 
UNICEF and ICRC to cosponsor education events, seminars and 
public awareness campaigns.  Embassy will propose regular 
coordination meetings at COM or DCM level with MINURCAT, 
UNICEF, and ICRC on TIP-related issues, especially child 
soldiers. 
 
-------- 
Track II 
 
-------- 
 
Track Two:  This would involve visits by USG experts, and if 
possible provision of financial assistance, to help Chad make 
progress on mutually-defined goals, and to allow more 
targeted assistance from UNICEF and ICRC.
