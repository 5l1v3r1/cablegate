SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - APPROACHING THE EU IN ADVANCE 
OF THE MARCH 5-6 FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING (GAERC) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 23592 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolChief discussed subject demarche with European 
Correspondent Jarno Syrjala Feb. 28.  Syrjala thanked us 
for sharing US viewsand highlighted the following: 
 
¶2. (C) ISRAEL/PAESTINE: Syrjala said that there is still 
strong ember-state (MS) consensus around the need for the 
Nationa Unity Government (NUG) to commit unequivcally to 
the Quartet's three basic principles, ad that the EU will 
judge the NUG based on its actions.  However, discussions 
at the GAERC may reveal some divisions regarding approach. 
Syrjala said that most member states are increasingly 
skeptical that President Abbas will really be able to 
convince Hamas and deliver a NUG that truly commits to the 
Quartet's principles.  A smaller group of MS (including 
Finland) are inclined to support the NUG somewhat more 
unconditionally.  He predicted that the GAERC will 
ultimately issue a statement that fully supports the need 
for adherence to the Quartet's principles, but that 
internal debate on the details could prove interesting, 
"depending on who speaks up."  Regarding the overall peace 
process, Syrjala noted that the EU appreciated Secretary 
Rice's recent efforts in the region and the briefings she 
provided the German Presidency.  The EU is very supportive 
of the positions she outlined during her most recent trip, 
he added. 
 
¶3. (C) UZBEKISTAN: Syrjala downplayed suggestions that the 
EU may be looking to lift its sanctions on Uzbekistan in 
May and said that Finland at this point would oppose any 
such move.  (During its EU Presidency, Finland was 
instrumental in November 2006 in ensuring that the 
sanctions be extended.)  The Uzbeks have engaged in a real 
dialogue with the EU and "basically responded adequately" 
to EU concerns about Andijan, Syrjala noted; however, much 
remains to be done to improve the country's overall human 
rights record and the EU is unlikely to lift sanctions 
until it sees meaningful improvements in several areas. 
 
¶4. (U) AFGHANISTAN: Although not on the GAERC agenda, 
PolChief thanked Finland for announcing that it will 
contribute 10 trainers to the EU's forthcoming Afghanistan 
police training mission, approved at the Feb. GAERC.  Some 
technical details remain to be worked out, but Syrjala said 
that all political hurdles have been cleared and the 
mission should indeed be operational by June, as planned.
