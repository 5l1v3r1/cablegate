Ambassador Ahmet Okcun, confirmed that Turkey will attend the 
Berlin meeting.  He said Foreign Minister Gul hopes to lead 
the Turkish delegation but faces some scheduling conflicts. 
Okcun was pleased to hear that Secretary Powell would be in 
Berlin and said the Secretary's attendance would be a strong 
incentive for Gul to attend.

Bonn Roadmap and the position of the U.S. that the Roadmap 
will not automatically expire after the June 2004 elections. 
Turkey will support the U.S. position in Berlin. 
 
 
¶3.  Turkey will confirm its USD 10 million pledge to 
Afghanistan's reconstruction.  Turkey has already disbursed 
over USD 5 million.
