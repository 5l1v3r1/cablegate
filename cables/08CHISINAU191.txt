We delivered reftel talking points on February 24 to Gheorghe 
Aparece, the acting head of the Americas Division at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and European Integration.  Mr. Aparece said that he 
would pass the information to his superiors at the ministry.  He 
doubted that Moldova would do anything more than issue a pro forma 
congratulatory note to Raul Castro.
