HEADLINES AND EXCERPTS: 
 
¶1. ASEAN 
 
"This time, Asean must turn words into action" 
 
The independent English-language South China Morning Post remarked 
in an editorial (3/2):  "Southeast Asian leaders are making the 
right noises about the global economic crisis.  They ended their 
annual summit yesterday by pledging a firm commitment to free trade 
and fighting protectionism in their bid to form a single market by 
¶2015. There could be no wiser sentiments to tackle the downturn and 
ensure the region's development.  For all the comforting words, 
though, a huge question mark remains; the nations have a poor record 
of turning rhetoric into action....  Asean is capable of landmark 
deals - it struck a free-trade agreement with Australia and New 
Zealand in Thailand and pacts with China and India are in the 
pipeline.  The grouping, China, Japan and South Korea decided last 
month to expand by half an emergency currency fund likely to be set 
up later this year.  These are positive signs, but Asean's record 
does not inspire optimism.  Nonetheless, its leaders have recognized 
the need to take the crisis seriously and have signed the necessary 
agreements to tackle it.  For the sake of their people, they now 
have to set aside past practices and adhere to the principles of 
free trade.  They must realize that a beggar-thy-neighbor approach 
will only make things worse." 
 
¶2. Economic stimulus package 
 
"Obama must be careful to not mess up the order of priority" 
 
The independent Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily News had an 
editorial (3/1):  "...While Obama was still enjoying high popularity 
ratings when he delivered his speech to the Congress last week, 
newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic expressed their doubts. 
The liberal Washington Post bluntly reminded Obama in its editorial 
'The President's priorities' on Wednesday that he must set 
priorities, the order of which cannot be altered.  The next day, 
Financial Times said in its editorial, 'Obama's first State of the 
Union' that Obama's remarks to the Congress were a 'fine speech' but 
it is time to follow up with details.  These two editorials 
highlight the worries of Europe and the U.S.  Although Obama is 
charismatic, no achievement has been seen from the economic rescue 
measures.  Saving the economy is as urgent as putting out a fire; 
people cannot wait any longer....  Obama is not a profligate son of 
rich parents who rises to the White House easily.  Instead, he has 
ascended step by step to the peak of politics from an Illinois 
representative to U.S. Senator and eventually won a landslide 
victory in the presidential election.  Thus, Obama should be able to 
understand the feelings of the general public.  When families have 
no money and their jobs are uncertain, people can only place their 
hopes on the economic stimulus plan.  Healthcare, energy and 
education are all important issues but they are not as pressing as 
rescuing the economy.  Only when the economy recovers, can the 
country have more resources to better develop the above three 
issues.  The two papers criticized Obama for fear that he may not 
know how to set his priorities and miss the opportunity."
