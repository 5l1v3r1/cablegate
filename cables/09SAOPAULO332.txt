¶1.  Summary: A validation study of all 1,333 short-term visitor 
visas issued during FY2008 under Consulate General Sao Paulo's 
referral program found only one overstay and one other problematic 
referral, both Class "B" referrals.  In order to further strengthen 
the integrity of its referral program, post is instituting a 
newly-revised referral school for all current and incoming officers. 
 End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Procedures 
---------- 
 
¶2.  Sao Paulo's Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) pulled data on all Class 
"A" and "B" referrals issued by post during FY 2008 (Sept. 1, 2007 - 
Oct. 30, 2008).  During that time period, post issued 189 Class "A" 
referrals, with no refusals, and 1,428 Class "B" referrals, with two 
refusals.  The data was sorted to eliminate all but short-term 
visas, leaving a total of 107 Class "A" and 1,226 Class "B" 
referrals.  Each case was then run against the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS)'s Arrival-Departure Information System 
(ADIS) database to determine entries, exits, and possible 
overstays.

Results

¶3.  ADIS checks showed that of the 107 Class "A" referrals, 82 (77 
percent) have traveled and returned, 20 (19 percent) have not yet 
traveled, and five (five percent) are in the United States "in 
status," having recently traveled.  The checks for Class "B" 
referrals initially showed that, of the 1,226 cases, 969 (79 
percent) have traveled and returned, 230 (19 percent) have not 
traveled, 16 (1.3 percent) are in the United States "in status," ten 
UCO ("Unconfirmed overstays") and one ERR (expedited removal) at 
port-of-entry.  FPU then called each of the ten UCO's.  Seven were 
located back in Brazil, two contacted are currently living in Spain, 
and one was contacted and confirmed to still be in the United 
States. 
 
¶4.  The two problematic referrals, both Class "B," originated from 
the same officer in the Political Section.  (Note: The officer in 
question left post almost one year ago.  End note.)  The first case, 
the ERR, was for a Lebanese restaurant owner, legally resident in 
Brazil for 10 years.  The visa was issued based on a request from an 
Atlanta church for the individual to participate in an ecumenical 
choir aimed at bridge-building between the Muslim and Christian 
communities.   On arrival in Atlanta, Customs and Border Protection 
contacted the U.S. church, which denied having invited the 
individual and stated that no such concert was planned.  The one 
confirmed overstay was for the mother of a 15-year-old model to 
accompany the daughter to a contest in the United States.  The 
daughter returned, but the mother stayed. 
 
¶5.  Comment:  The results of the study demonstrate that Sao Paulo's 
high-volume referral program is fundamentally sound.  In order to 
further strengthen the program, however, the nonimmigrant visa unit 
is instituting a revised Referral School program for all current and 
incoming officers, in accordance with 9 FAM Appendix K, 203.
