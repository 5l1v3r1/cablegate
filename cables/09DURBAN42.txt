REF: Durban 39 
 
¶1.   (SBU)  Summary.   Although late complaining from Inkatha 
Freedom Party (IFP) officials about an unfair election 
environment indicated that the party might contest the vote 
count in KwaZulu Natal (KZN), intervention by former Nigerian 
President Olesun Obasanjo seems to have persuaded the IFP 
otherwise.  IFP is humbled by defeat but hopes to rebuild.  End 
Summary. 
 
Elections not Free and Fair, says IFP 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In the final days of their campaign, IFP leaders 
accused the ANC of electoral foul play.  At the launch of the 
African Election Observer Team hosted by The African Center for 
the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD) on April 17, 
former IFP KZN Premier Lionel Mtshali decried the unfair 
political environment in which the ANC, in his estimation, acted 
with impunity.  He also noted that the Independent Electoral 
Commission (IEC) had not responded to the IFP's written 
complaints of political intimidation and abuse of police 
authority in Nongoma and elsewhere.   In IFP press releases, IFP 
parliamentarians said that the recent hand-over of houses to 
former soldiers of uMkhonto weSizwe amounted to vote buying and 
also that the IFP is considering legal action against the 
state-owned South African Broadcasting Company (SABC) because of 
a pro-ANC bias, which the IFP claims has `ruined any chance of a 
free and fair election.' 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  In response to the arrest of an election official who 
allegedly stuffed a ballot box with ballots marked in favor of 
the IFP, Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi, IFP KZN Premier candidate, 
accused the African National Congress (ANC ) and the IEC of 
`conniving to discredit the name of the IFP'  and claimed that 
the accused is actually a member of the ANC.   IFP President 
Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi further alleged that the ballots 
marked in favor of the IFP had been printed in the 
ANC-controlled KZN Premier's office and then distributed in KZN 
and Mpumalanga Province. 
 
Obasanjo Intervenes 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Sean Callaghan and Vasu Gounden of ACCORD reported to 
CG and P/E Officer on April 23 that Obasanjo had counseled 
Buthelezi to accept the election results and not contest the 
vote outcome.   Indeed, Obasanjo promised to return to South 
Africa and intervene should there be a vote-results dispute in 
KZN.  ACCORD reps also said that Obasanjo had met with senior 
ANC officials in the province, both Premier Sibusiso Ndebele and 
Premier-in-Waiting Zweli Mkhize, to urge them not to pursue a 
legal case of defamation against Prince Buthelezi regarding his 
allegations that ballots had been printed in the Premier's 
office.  Local media reported on April 24 that Ndebele told 
reporters that he would put the lawsuit on hold. 
 
¶5.  (U) In a press conference attended by P/E Officer and P/E 
Assistant on April 24, a defeated-looking Buthelezi reiterated 
his concerns about election irregularities but said that he 
accepted, `that the people of South Africa have spoken.' 
Buthelezi often trailed off when speaking and seemed unusually 
emotional.  He promised to keep campaigning on behalf of his 
party, but said that the IFP must rebuild itself.   Buthelezi 
still showed sparks of his old self, however, when asked about 
the future of the IFP.   When pressed by a reporter if the IFP 
could recover from this defeat, Buthelezi  declared, `Why not? 
I've been at this longer than you!' 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Comment:  Although Buthelezi would not confirm 
outright that the IFP had foregone contesting the final results 
in KZN, his demeanor at the April 24 event suggested that he 
will take Obasanjo's advice and not file a formal complaint with 
the IEC.  It is unclear from Buthelezi's responses if the IFP 
expects to find a place within an ANC-controlled provincial 
legislature or even if the IFP would be able to stomach a 
handout from the ANC.  Buthelezi did, however, sheepishly remind 
the audience that the IFP had reached out to the ANC when the 
IFP took power in KZN in 1994, suggesting that the IFP is hoping 
that the ANC will not deal them a final blow.
