¶1. (SBU) Chief Operations Officer Colonel Ajay Sah at the UN Mission 
In Sudan (UNMIS) told poloff January 3 that as of January 2, no 
Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) units have redeployed and none of the 
3,600 SAF troops show signs imminent movement either.  He said that 
some of the 50,000 Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA) north of the 
1/1/56 border have moved but then abruptly stopped about halfway to 
the southern border. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sah said that the UN offered to airlift some 1,800 SPLA 
troops to the south during the holiday season that started 19 
December.  He said that the UN received no reply from the SPLA and 
that as of January 1, the UN no longer has surplus airlift capacity 
to move SPLA soldiers. 
¶3. (SBU) Separately, Joint Defense Board (JDB) spokesman Abdelrahman 
Mohamed Zayn told poloff that the JDB agreed on January 5 that 
northern Sudan troops would pull out of oil areas by January 9, and 
that Joint Integrated Units (JIUs) would take their place.  However, 
Zayn acknowledged that the lack of transport assets, lack of 
funding, and insufficient joint integrated units will also create a 
delay in redeployment.  Zayn said that the JDB has plans to start 
JIU training in March in order to address the lack of JIUs. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sah said that given the preparations he has witnessed, 
troops for both sides will not be able to redeploy in time to meet 
the January 9 deadline (Ref A).  He opined that they would probably 
not move their troops at all and even if they started immediately, 
they would be hard pressed to move them to their respective borders 
even if the deadline is extended another month. 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Despite several JDB resolutions that SPLA and SAF 
forces will redeploy, post has no reason to believe that the January 
9 deadline will be met.  As we noted in Ref A, neither the SAF nor 
the SPLA wants to move their troops first.  SPLA officials have 
acknowledged openly to CG Juba officers that there is no way the 
SPLA can possibly meet the deadline, though more 
politically-oriented SPLM and GoSS officials continue to insist that 
the South will meet the redeployment deadline (now only one day 
away).  We suspect that despite the public and private posturing, 
neither side is in any rush to redeploy and is unlikely to do so due 
to the critical lack of trust between the CPA partners.
