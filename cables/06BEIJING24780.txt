¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Sinopec Director-General for Foreign 
Affairs Tang Suxin stated that contrary to Iranian press 
reports, Sinopec,s business cooperation with Iran on the 
Yadavaran Oilfield is currently at the contract negotiation 
stage.  Iran was making propaganda to suit its own purposes, 
he added.  Tang went on to say that Sinopec, in general, is 
not interested in product sharing agreements (PSA) with Iran 
as they are considered too risky.  End summary. 
 
No Sinopec-Iran Deal Completed, but Negotiations Continue 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a December 21, 2006 meeting, Sinopec 
Director-General for Foreign Affairs Tang Suxin told Economic 
Minister-Counselor that he was aware of press reports as far 
back as three weeks ago concerning a potential deal between 
Sinopec and Iran.  He consulted with several offices within 
Sinopec and concluded that Iran was &making propaganda to 
suit its purposes.8  Sinopec,s position is largely 
different from these Iranian reports, he continued.  While 
there is business cooperation with National Iranian Oil 
Company, any further cooperation on full-scale investments in 
Iran's Yadavaran Oilfield is still at the contract 
negotiation stage.  The discussions have not been finalized, 
he emphasized. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Econ M/C asked whether Sinopec was now considering 
going beyond the services contracts described by Vice 
President Zhang Yaocang in ref. b.  Tang said that he did not 
have total investment figures on hand and noted that it is 
hard to know what constitutes an investment an even harder to 
quantify the total.  The Gamsar project is just a services 
contract and Sinopec is not interested in the more risky 
product sharing agreements (PSAs), he added. 
 
Yadavaran Oil Field Deal and LNG Projects ) Linkage Unclear 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Econ M/C asked about the status of Sinopec,s 
possible purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Iran. 
Tang stated that he is not involved in the LNG negotiations 
and didn't know exactly how this fit into the broader 
Yadavaran negotiations.  However, he stated his view that 
developing LNG capacity in Iran would benefit China and all 
other consuming nations. 
 
UNSCR and Sinopec Negotiations 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Responding to Econ M/C,s talking points addressing 
United States, concerns that a Sino-Iranian oil deal at this 
point in time would be especially unfortunate considering 
pending action in the United Nations and the signal it would 
send Iran, Tang noted that Sinopec is a responsible member of 
the international community and would abide by relevant 
international laws and decrees.
