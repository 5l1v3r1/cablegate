SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL BRIEFINGS ON IRAQ/KUWAIT, DFI/IAMB 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On April 16, the Security Council received 
two Iraq-related briefings.  The first briefing, by 
high-level coordinator for Kuwaiti missing persons/archives 
Gennady Tarasov, focused on the lack of real progress on this 
issue over the past year.  Tarasov asked for an additional 15 
months to continue confidence-building measures.  The 
Security Council approved a 6-month extension of funding for 
Tarasov,s mandate but made clear that it was open to future 
extensions if there was still no progress.  Separately, A/SYG 
and Comptroller Jun Yamazaki briefed on the activities of the 
International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB).  Yamazaki 
noted that the IAMB "believes COFE (the Iraqi Committee of 
Financial Experts) is ready to assume oversight of the DFI 
(Development Fund for Iraq)", although he added that Iraq 
still needed to improve internal controls and overcome 
corruption challenges.  End summary. 
 
KUWAIT MISSING PERSONS/ARCHIVES 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following issuance last week of a comprehensive 
report on Kuwaiti missing persons/archives, high-level 
coordinator Gennady Tarasov briefed the Council on April 16. 
He outlined several positive developments: Iraqi agreement 
for Tarasov,s earlier visit to Baghdad, as well as the 
return from Iraq to Kuwait of Kuwaiti audio and videotapes. 
Despite this progress, the overall objectives - to make 
progress in identifying the remains of missing Kuwaitis and 
to find any trace of the Kuwaiti national archives - are no 
closer to completion, said Tarasov.  He called on both 
parties to be more "results oriented" and urged Council 
acceptance of a 15-month confidence building period.  He 
specifically suggested focusing on 1) interviewing former 
Iraqi leaders for any information about the archives; and 2) 
ensuring that Kuwaiti teams have access to mass gravesites in 
Iraq.  Noting the Council,s broad agreement for a 6-month 
extension, Tarasov said progress during this shorter period 
was highly unlikely because of the heat in Iraq and the 
general lack of momentum from both sides. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Council members had similar reactions to Tarasov,s 
briefing.  They expressed disappointment at the lack of 
progress over the last year and called on both sides to turn 
their words into actions.  The UK, U.S. and France noted the 
upcoming review of all Security Council resolutions related 
to Iraq, and said this would be another opportunity to review 
progress in this particular issue.  Tarasov and Russian PR 
Churkin emphasized that Tarasov,s mandate was purely 
humanitarian and therefore should not be linked to any 
broader review.  Churkin further noted that Russian 
acceptance of a six-month extension was a compromise on 
Russia,s part; without real progress, "the mandate will 
continue." 
 
DFI/IAMB 
 
¶4. (SBU) UN Comptroller Jun Yamazaki briefed on the 
activities of the IAMB.  He noted the IAMB,s determination 
that the COFE is ready to "assume the oversight 
responsibilities and conduct competent and independent 
oversight of the DFI."  The IAMB also considered the 
preliminary results of the 2008 audit of the DFI, which 
highlighted concern regarding controls over oil extraction 
and use of oil resources.  The IAMB also noted that more work 
needs to be done by the government of Iraq to implement 
earlier IAMB recommendations and to strengthen Iraq,s system 
of internal controls.  Regarding oil metering, the IAMB 
strongly urged the Iraqi government to develop a time-bound 
action plan, endorsed by the Council of Ministers, to ensure 
completion of this project. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Russian PR Churkin criticized the closed and opaque 
process of the DFI and said nothing is being done to address 
the DFI,s shortcomings in this regard.  He voiced 
disappointment that the IMF and World Bank did not respond to 
the Security Council,s request for a briefing from them.  He 
added that the work of the DFI/IAMB should be considered in 
the context of the upcoming overall review of Iraq-related 
Security Council resolutions.  China and France urged 
continued Council review of the DFI/IAMB, and said the 
Comptroller,s briefing was helpful.  Ambassador DiCarlo 
noted U.S. concern regarding the COFE, and said the U.S. was 
working with Iraq to alleviate the need for Iraqi/DFI 
immunities past 2009.
