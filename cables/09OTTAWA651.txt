Â¶1. (U)  Canadian interlocutors expressed thanks for the 
information on the upcoming BMENA Forum for the Future, which 
they also received from the Italians and Moroccans, according 
to Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
Algeria, Libya, and Morocco Desk Officer Denys Laliberte.  He 
added that DFAIT has taken note of U.S. representations on 
the importance of foreign ministerial attendance, but 
cautioned that last year Member of Parliament Deepak Obhrai, 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, represented Canada and was likely to do so again. 
He queried whether Secretary Clinton would attend given U.S. 
representations.  Poloff used reftel language to respond. 
Laliberte underscored that Minister Cannon will decide "in 
late September" about his possible participation.
