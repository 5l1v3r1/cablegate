¶1. (SBU) Summary.  During the October 15 India-Brazil-South 
Africa summit in New Delhi, the three countries: 
 
-- emphasized their solidarity by pledging to work together 
to meet shared challenges of the global financial crisis, 
while criticizing rich countries for the crisis; 
-- signed seven agreements and two action plans, including 
a memorandum to facilitate trilateral trade, an accord to 
increase tourism between the three countries, and action 
plans for better cooperation on sea and air transportation. 
-- issued a lengthy "Delhi Summit Declaration," covering 
shared views on a multitude of issues, ranging from global 
governance to UN reforms to climate change to Doha 
Development Round to Iraq to food security and even the 
Indian Diwali festival of light; 
-- set a target for trilateral trade of $25 billion by 
2015; and 
-- congratulated themselves for the progress made in the 
first five years of the IBSA Dialogue Forum and committed 
to begin a second cycle of IBSA summits in Brazil next 
year. End Summary. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh welcomed 
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and South 
African President Kgalema Motlanthe to New Delhi October 15 
for the 3rd Summit of the India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) 
Dialogue Forum.  IBSA has gained in significance for the 
Indian 
government, evidenced by PM Singh's remarks in the 
inaugural address which described a unique relationship 
based on common interests in multilateral fora such as 
GATT/WTO and the G-20 group of developing countries, as 
well as the potential that their trilateral relationship 
holds for South-South cooperation and as leaders of 
developing countries.  PM Singh, in a theme repeated by the 
leaders throughout the summit and widely noted in media 
coverage, was quick to assert that IBSA had a role to play 
in expediting reform of the international financial 
architecture for "a more development-friendly world 
trading system," noting that turmoil in global markets 
further enhanced the imperative of South-South 
cooperation.  Singh also described how India, Brazil and 
South Africa, as leading economies of their respective 
continents, also had a responsibility to other developing 
countries. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The summit produced seven agreements: a 
Tripartite Agreement on Tourism, an MoU on Trade 
Facilitation for Standards, Technical Regulations and 
Conformity Assessment, an MoU on Environment, an MoU on 
Human Settlements Development, a Five Year Action Plan for 
Maritime Development, a Five Year Action Plan for Civil 
Aviation, and an MoU on Women's Development and Gender 
Equality Programs.  The leaders also agreed to direct 
their Ministers of Finance, Governors of Central Banks, and 
Ministers of Trade and Industry to work together to develop 
a response to the financial crisis. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The summit focused on development issues, with the 
leaders calling for "the need to make the structures of 
global governance more democratic, representative and 
legitimate by increasing the participation of developing 
countries in the decision-making bodies of multilateral 
institutions."  The leaders reaffirmed their support for UN 
reforms, especially expansion of Security Council 
membership.  The leaders also reiterated their support of 
efforts to achieve the Millennium Development goals, calling 
on developed countries to "fulfill their commitments in the 
global partnership...including increasing Official 
 
NEW DELHI 00002763  002 OF 002 
 
 
Development Assistance (ODA) to 0.7% of their GNI." 
 
¶5. (SBU) The "Delhi Summit Declaration" was an expansive 
document covering many topics.  The Declaration highlighted 
shared commitments to Global Governance goals, sustainable 
development, negotiation of an international regime of 
Access Benefit Sharing (ABS) for genetic resources, 
protection of human rights, cooperation on an intellectual 
property regime, disarmament, non-proliferation, peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy, and combating terrorism.  It 
welcomed resumption of the multilateral WTO process, 
especially calling for finalization of modalities in 
agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA), and 
noting that many Doha Round issues left unresolved were 
issues critical to developing countries. The leaders agreed 
to collaborate on policy and technology to strengthen energy 
security in the three countries, and called on developed 
countries to facilitate access to renewable energy technology 
by developing countries.  The Declaration also called on 
countries to deliver promised funding to address food 
security 
issues.  Other topics touched on were regional issues from 
the 
New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) to the 
Middle 
East Peace Process, and, somewhat surprisingly, a section 
wishing the government 
and people of India well on the occasion of Diwali (the 
celebration of light). 
 
¶6. (SBU) Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in his 
press conference at the end of the summit that the IBSA 
countries expect to meet the $15 billion target for 
trilateral trade by 2010, and accordingly have set a goal 
of $25 billion in trilateral trade by 2015. Brazil will start 
the second round of IBSA summits by hosting the 4th IBSA 
summit 
on 8 October, 2009. 
 
¶7. (C) Comment.  The IBSA Summits have demonstrated the three 
governments' commitment to the idea of closer engagement, but 
their trade levels still lag.    Their $15 billion trade 
target is less than 2 percent of their world trade.  However, 
although India and Brazil have been prominent players in the 
Doha Round, both individually and as co-leaders of the G20, 
their interests diverge substantially.  Brazil appears to 
have significant offensive interests in agricultural exports 
while India is highly defensive on agricultural market 
access. Indeed, India was one of the main barriers to 
achieving a deal during the WTO Ministerial in July while 
Brazil appears to have played a constructive role in joining 
with the EU and US in trying to forge a consensus.  Perhaps 
these governments can play a more constructive role in the 
planned global financial summit, which anticipates expanding 
from a narrow G-8 representation to include the governments 
of India, Brazil and South Africa.
