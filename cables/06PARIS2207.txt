SUBJECT:  UNESCO: EXECUTIVE BOARD CONSIDERS DG'S PLANS 
FOR "REORIENTATION" OF TROUBLED BRASILIA OFFICE 
 
 
¶1.  THIS IS A GUIDANCE REQUEST, SEE PARA 2. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  AT THE MARCH 29-31 
MEETING OF THE FINANCIAL AND ADMMINSTRATIVRE EXPERTS' 
GROUP, A MEMBER OF UNESCO'S LEGAL OFFICE SAID THAT HIS 
OFFICE HAD ADVISED THE SECRETARIAT THAT CERTAIN 
ACTIVITIES IN WHICH UNESCO IS SUB-CONTRACTING WORKERS 
FOR BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES MIGHT CONSTITUTE A 
LEGAL RISK FOR THE ORGANIZATION, GIVEN THE FACT THAT 
SUCH SUB-CONTRACTING PRACTICES HAVE GIVEN RISE TO 
CHARGES BROUGHT BY A BRAZILIAN PROSECTOR AGAINST THE 
HEAD OF THE UNESCO OFFICE AND THE UNESCO DG.  THE 
SECRETARIAT REPORTED THAT UNESCO PLANNED TO CONTINUE 
 
SIPDIS 
SUCH ACTIVITIES THROUGH 2007, GIVEN THE LIMITED 
CAPACITY OF THE BRAZILIAN GOIVERNMENT TO FULFILL THESE 
FUNCTIONS.  ANOTHER MEMBER OF UNESCO'S LEGAL STAFF 
CONFIDED TO THE U.S. DELEGATION THAT THE CONTRACT 
CONDITIONS AND CONTRACTING PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE 
CONTINUING ACTIVITIES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT 
HAVE GIVEN RISE TO LEGAL CHARGES, WITHOUT SPECIFYING 
HOW, EVEN WHEN PRESSED; BUT HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
HIS OFFICE HAD ADVISED THE SECRETARIAT TO LIMIT RISK BY 
DISCONTINUING THE CONTRACTS. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MISSION REQUESTS GUIDANCE ON WHETHER IT IS 
ADVISABLE TO PRESS THE ISSUE at the executive board OF 
WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS PRESENT A LEGAL RISK AND SHOULD 
thus BE DISCONTINUED; AND IF SO, WHEN.  IF THIS IS 
DESIRABLE, MISSION REQUESTS LANGUAGE TO AMEND THE 
CURRENT VERSION OF THE DRAFT REOSLUTION (174 EX/21, 
CURRENT VERSION IN LAST PARA OF THIS MESSAGE.)  ANY U.S 
ATTEMPT TO INSERT SUCH LANGUAGE LIKELY WILL BE 
FORCEFULLY COUNTERED BY BRAZIL.  AN AMERICAN, 
RREPORTEDLY ONE OF THE TWO CANDIDATES STILL IN THE 
RUNNING FOR THE POST OF DIRECTOR OF THE BRASILIA 
OFFICE, WOULD BE IN AN IDEAL POSITION TO EVALUATE THE 
SITUATION AND ENACT REFORMS - IF HE WERE TO BE CHOSEN. 
THIS APPOINTMENT WOULD PROBABLY REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF 
THE BRAZILIAN DELEGATION TO UNESCO, CHARY OF ANY MAJOR 
CRITICISM OF THE BRASILIA OPERATION.  END SUMMARY AND 
INTRODUCTION. 
 
U.S. PRESSES FOR ACCOUNTING/REFORMS AT BRASILIA OFFICE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶4.  (U) THE CURRENT SESSION OF UNESCO'S EXECUTIVE BOARD 
WILL TACKLE THE ISSUE OF UNESCO'S TROUBLED BRASILIA 
OFFICE; AGENDA ITEM 19 PRESENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
DEBATE "THE REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL ON THE 
ACTIVITIES AND THE RESULTS OF THE UNESCO OFFICE IN 
BRASILIA" (174 EX 21). THIS ITEM HAS ALREADY BEEN 
DISCUSSED AT THE F/A EXPERTS' GROUP MEETING (MARCH 29- 
31) AND IS ON THE AGENDA OF THIS WEEK'S FINANCIAL AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE (F/A) COMMISSION AND PROGRAM AND 
EXTERNAL RELATIONS (P/X) COMMISSION AS WELL. 
 
¶5.  (U) IN ADVANCE OF THE FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
(F/A) EXPERTS' MEETING, THE U.S AND ITS GENEVA GROUP 
PARTNERS DECIDED TO PRESS OTHER MEMBER STATES TO ADD 
SUBSTANCE TO THE DRAFT DECISION PROPOSED BY THE 
SECRETARIAT (PARA 40 DOCUMENT 174/EX 21), INCLUDING TO 
 
SIPDIS 
EXPRESS "CONCERN WITH ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND 
OTHER WEAKNESSES" AND TO REQUEST THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 
TO REPORT BACK ON BRASILIA OFFICE REFORM EFFORTS AT THE 
FALL 2006 EXECUTIVE BOARD.  THE GENEVA GROUP SUCCEEDED 
IN INCLUDING SUCH LANGUAGE IN THE VERSION OF THE DRAFT 
RESOLUTION THAT WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE F/A AND P/X 
COMMISSIONS THIS WEEK (APRIL 6-11), ALONG WOITH 
LANGUAGE RECOMMENDING THAT THE DECENTRALIZATION PROCESS 
AND THE SECRETARIAT'S ACTION PLAN ON EXTRA-BUDGETARY 
FUNDS BE INFORMED BY LESSONS LEARNED VIA THE BRASILIA 
OFFICE.  (TEXT AT LAST PARA OF THIS MESSAGE) HOWEVER, 
THE BRAZILIAN OBSERVER TO THE F/A EXPERTS' GROUP 
SIGNALED THAT HE WOULD PRESS FOR A MORE "BALANCED" 
RESOLUTION AT THIS WEEK'S F/A AND P/X COMMISSIONS THAT 
WOULD HIGHLIGHT WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS PRAISEWORTHY 
PROGRAMS INITIATED BY UNESCO'S BRASILIA OPERATION. 
 
AS SOME THORNY LEGAL ISSUES PERSIST 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) AT THE MEETING OF THE F/A EXPERTS' GROUP, LEGAL 
ISSUES  AROSE THAT HAD NOT BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE  DG'S 
REPORT ON THE BRASILIA OFFICE. AS THE PELIMINARY REPORT 
OF  THE F/A EXPERTS' MEETING HIGHLIGHTS:  "SOME MEMBERS 
ASKED  THE LEGAL ADVISOR ABOUT THE COURT CASE  REFERRED 
TO  IN THE REPORT. THE LEGAL ADVISOR INFORMED THE GROUP 
THAT   THERE  IS  A  CIVIL  ACTION  ALLEGING  ACTS   OF 
ADMINISTRATIVE  IMPROPRIETY THAT SEEKS  APPLICATION  OF 
SANCTIONS  AGAINST HIGH RANKING FORMER OFFICIALS  OF  A 
PUBLIC  AGENCY  IN BRAZIL, AS WELL AS  UNESCO  AND  ITS 
FORMER  REPRESENTATIVE  IN THE COUNTRY,  FOR  ALLEGEDLY 
CAUSING  EXTENSIVE  LOSSES TO  THE  PUBLIC  COFFERS  OF 
BRAZIL. THE CIVIL ACTION HAS BEEN SUSPENDED, PENDING  A 
DETERMINATION BY BRAZIL'S SUPREME COURT AS  TO  WHETHER 
UNESCO  HAS  IMMUNITY FROM LEGAL PROCESS IN  THIS  CASE 
(NB:   THE PROSECUTOR IS ARGUING THAT UNESCO'S IMMUNITY 
DOES NOT APPLY, AS IT WAS ACTING IN A FIELD OUTSIDE  OF 
ITS  MANDATE). ANOTHER MEMBER ASKED IF IT  WOULDN'T  BE 
OPPORTUNE  IN  THIS  CONTEXT  TO  END  IMMEDIATELY  ALL 
ONGOING  PROJECTS OUTSIDE OF UNESCO'S COMPETENCES.  THE 
LEGAL ADVISOR STATED THAT THE LEGAL OFFICE ADVISED THAT 
ANY  PROJECTS THAT WOULD NOT COMPLY WITH THE  BRAZILIAN 
LEGISLATION    BE    TERMINATED   EXPEDITIOUSLY.    THE 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL (HEAD  OF  FIELD 
OFFICES)  INDICATED  THAT  A  TRANSITION  STRATEGY   IS 
NECESSARY  TO  PERMIT  A  PROGESSIVE  TRANSFER  OF  THE 
ACTIVITIES  OF  THE PROJECTS IN QUESTION  TO  CONCERNED 
AUTHORITIES, IN ORDER NOT TO DETRACT FROM  PROGRAMS  OF 
NATIONAL IMPACT. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) U.S. MISSION OFFICERS QUESTIONED ANOTHER 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LEGAL ADVISOR'S OFFICE ON THE 
LEGAL RISK POSED BY CONTINUING THE SUB-CONTRACTING 
ACTIVITIES IN AREAS OUTSIDE OF UNESCO'S MANDATE 
(INCLUDING HEALTH).  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HIS OFFICE 
HAD ADVISED THE SECRETARIAT TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO 
RISK BY DISCONTINUING THE CONTRACTS, BUT SAID THAT THAT 
THE CONTRACT CONDITIONS AND CONTRACTING PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE CONTINUING ACTIVITIES ARE DIFFERENT 
FROM THOSE THAT HAVE GIVEN RISE TO LEGAL CHARGES.  WHEN 
PRESSED, HOWEVER, HE DID NOT OFFER MORE DETAIL ON HOW 
THESE CONTRACTS DIFFERED. 
 
¶8.  (U) AT A SUBSEQUENT SESSION OF THE F/A EXPERTS' 
MEETING, THE LEGAL ADVISOR WHO IS MOST CLOSELY 
FOLLOWING THE BRASILIA DOSSIER CLARIFIED HIS POSITION. 
HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO CHARACTERIZE 
BRASILIA OFFICE ACTIVITIES AS "ILLEGAL" - THE TERM 
"CONTRARY TO BRAZILIAN LAW" WOULD BE MORE EXACT, HE 
SAID.  IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT AN APPROACH THAT 
MINIMIZES RISK IS IMPORTANT: "WE CANNOT JUDGE WHETHER A 
WINDING DOWN OF CURRENT OPERATIONS WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE 
TO A BRAZILIAN PROSECUTOR." 
 
¶9.  (U)  TEXT OF RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE F/A EXPERTS' 
GROUP: 
 
THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, 
 
HAVING  CONSIDERED DOCUMENT 174 EX/21, IN THE LIGHT  OF 
DOCUMENTS 174 EX/27, 174 EX/29 AND 174 EX/INF.4 
 
NOTING  THE  SCALE  AND  IMPORTANCE  OF  THE  OPERATION 
MANAGED BY THE UNESCO BRASILIA OFFICE 
 
CONCERNED   WITH  THE  ADMINISTRATIVE,  FINANCIAL   AND 
PLANNING   WEAKNESSES   OF  THE   MANAGEMENT   OF   THE 
EXTRABUDGETARY ACTIVITIES BY THE UNESCO BRASILIA OFFICE 
AND  IN  PARTICULAR  WITH  THE INADEQUACY  OF  INTERNAL 
CONTROLS  AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH HEADQUARTERS  RECALLS 
THE  IMPORTANCE FOR ACTIVITIES AT FIELD LEVEL TO BE  IN 
LINE  WITH UNESCO'S OBJECTIVES DEFINED IN THE  C/4  AND 
C/5 
 
TAKES  NOTE  OF  THE ACTIONS TAKEN AND PLANNED  BY  THE 
DIRECTOR-GENERAL  TO  REORIENT THE  OPERATIONS  OF  THE 
UNESCO   OFFICE   IN  BRASILIA  AND   TO   REMEDY   THE 
DEFICIENCIES  IN  THE  MANAGEMENT  OF  THE  OFFICE  AND 
MONITOR THE SCOPE OF THE OPERATIONS; 
 
INVITES  THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL TO CONTINUE TO  IMPLEMENT 
HIS  ACTION  PLAN FOR THE REORIENTATION OF  THE  UNESCO 
OFFICE  IN  BRASILIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH  DECISIONS  174 
EX/.  AND 174 EX/.  AS WELL AS THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM 
BOTH IOS AND THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR AND TO REPORT BACK TO 
ITS 175TH SESSION. 
 
REQUESTS  THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL TO ENSURE THAT PROPOSALS 
FOR  UNESCO'S ACTIVITIES IN BRAZIL ARE CONSISTENT  WITH 
AN  OVERALL STRATEGY FOR DECENTRALIZATION, AS  PART  OF 
THE  RATIONAL  DELIVERY OF PROGRAMMES AGAINST  UNESCO'S 
PRIORITY OBJECTIVES; AND THAT LESSONS LEARNED FROM  THE 
EXPERIENCE IN BRASILIA SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT  IN 
FURTHER DEVELOPING THE DECENTRALIZATION STRATEGY. 
 
ALSO REQUESTS THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL TO TAKE FULL ACCOUNT 
OF  THE LESSONS DERIVED FROM THE EXPERIENCE IN BRASILIA 
INCLUDING  THE  SPECIFIC  RISKS  INVOLVED  WITH   SELF- 
BENEFITING FUNDS WHEN DEVELOPING THE OVERALL  STRATEGIC 
VISION AND ACTION PLAN CALLED FOR IN DECISION 174  EX/.
