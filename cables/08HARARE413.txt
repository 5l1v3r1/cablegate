¶1. (SBU)  Embassy Harare's EAC met on May 8 to review the 
political situation and the Mission's security posture.  The 
Ambassador chaired the meeting.  In attendance were 
representatives from RSO, POL/ECON, CONS, USAID, MGT, R/POL, 
CDC, GSO, IMO, CLO and MSG. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The Ambassador explained that the political 
situation continues to evolve and the Embassy continues to 
receive shocking reports of targeted violence directed 
against opposition members and suspected opposition 
supporters.  Credible reports of human rights abuses, 
targeted incidents of torture, and rural homes being 
destroyed in many parts of the country are being obtained on 
a daily basis. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Pol/Econ concurred that these reports of violence 
in the rural areas continue unabated.  R/POL agreed, adding 
that the ruling party will do anything to win the election. 
Within the Mission, those most at risk are representatives of 
US AID and NGO organizations who might happen to be in the 
wrong place at the wrong time in rural areas. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  EAC members agreed that Embassy business has 
remained largely unaffected by the current political 
situation, especially in and around Harare.  RSO commented 
that there are no reports of Americans being specifically 
targeted for crime or harassment in Harare, and recent trips 
to Victoria Falls, Great Zimbabwe, and the Nyanga resort 
areas by mission travelers have been incident free.  Overall 
crime in Harare has remained at routine levels, with 
smash-and-grab attacks and attempted burglary events 
continuing to happen with some regularity. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  EAC members agreed that the Mission's current 
security posture, which includes continued case-by-case 
review of in-country travel requests, remains appropriate. 
The Ambassador directed CONS and RSO to prepare a security 
message and warden message to notify communities that the 
situation remains somewhat volatile and that the expected 
return of MDC opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai this 
weekend may spark increased violence between the ruling party 
and opposition supporters.
