¶Q. EVIDENCE OF FLUENCY IN WRITTEN AND ORAL ENGLISH (E.G.

  NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER 
 
¶R. NARRATIVE: 
 
  MR. VAN DER KROGT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY BOTH THE MISSION 
  AND HIS HOME INSTITUTION AS A POLICYMAKER OF OUTSTANDING 
  PROMISE.  HE HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A HIGHLY 
  REGARDED MEMBER OF NEW ZEALAND'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND 
  DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT. 
 
  THE PROGRAM IS AN ESPECIALLY GOOD FIT FOR VAN DER KROGT, 
  AS HE IS ABOUT TO TRANSFER TO THE INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE 
  RELATIONS SECTION AS A DESK OFFICER, WHERE HE WILL 
  CONCENTRATE ON THE NEW ZEALAND-UNITED STATES DEFENSE 
  RELATIONSHIP.  IN THIS CAPACITY HE WILL PLAY A CENTRAL 
  ROLE AS A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE AND ADVICE ON US POLICY AND 
  PERCEPTIONS OF SECURITY, WHICH IS CRITICAL WHENEVER US 
  VIEWS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED.  AN IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF US 
  POLICY AND HOW IT IS ARRIVED AT IS CRUCIAL FOR VAN DER 
  KROGT'S PROFESSIONAL DUTIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS 
  INSTITUTION'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS. 
  AS A POLICY CONCEPT, NATIONAL SECURITY IN NEW ZEALAND IS 
  CURRENTLY AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE.  THE MINISTRY IS A 
  CORE MEMBER OF NEW ZEALAND'S SECURITY COMMUNITY AND ACTS 
  AS A LEADING AGENCY IN A MULTI-AGENCY EFFORT TO SERVE NEW 
  ZEALAND'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS.  AS 
  A LEADER IN A FIELD OF EMERGING POLICYMAKERS, VAN DER 
  KROGT IS RECEPTIVE TO NEW IDEAS AND CHANGE AND IS AN 
  EXCELLENT CANDIDATE FOR THE PROGRAM.  HIS PARTICIPATION 
  WILL FURTHER ENHANCE HIS ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADVICE IN 
  DEVELOPING NEW ZEALAND'S FLEDGLING NATIONAL SECURITY 
  POLICY. 
 
  VAN DER KROGT'S NOMINATION WILL HELP TO SATISFY THE 
  COUNTERTERRORISM AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY PORTIONS OF THE 
  MISSION PERFORMANCE PLAN (MPP).  HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE 
  PROGRAM WILL HELP STRENGTHEN NEW ZEALAND'S 
  COUNTERTERRORISM CAPABILITIES AND IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING 
  AND COLLABORATION IN THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  IN 
  ADDITION, HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAM WOULD HELP 
  IMPROVE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING, COUNTER MISPERCEPTIONS, AND 
  HELP STRENGTHEN LONG-TERM POLICY GOALS THAT WILL BENEFIT 
  BOTH THE US AND NEW ZEALAND. 
 
¶S. STATEMENT BY CANDIDATE INDICATING WHY HE IS INTERESTED IN 
  PARTICIPATING AND WHAT HE EXPECTS TO GET OUT OF THE 
  PROGRAM: 
 
  I AM AN INTERMEDIATE-LEVEL POLICY ANALYST IN THE 
  INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE RELATIONS (IDR) BRANCH OF THE NEW 
  ZEALAND MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.   THE IDR BRANCH IS 
  RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING NEW ZEALAND'S BILATERAL DEFENSE 
  RELATIONSHIPS AND PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN ADVISING GOVERNMENT 
  ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE NEW ZEALAND DEFENSE FORCE. 
 
  WITHIN THE IDR BRANCH I AM THE DESK OFFICER FOR THE NEW 
  ZEALAND-UNITED STATES DEFENSE RELATIONSHIP.  THE UNITED 
  STATES IS OFTEN A KEY OPERATIONAL PARTNER FOR NEW 
  ZEALAND, AND WE OFTEN FIND COMMON CAUSE ON INTERNATIONAL 
  ISSUES.  MORE BROADLY, UNITED STATES FOREIGN AND SECURITY 
  POLICY HAS A PERVASIVE GLOBAL INFLUENCE ON STRATEGIC 
  MATTERS. 
 
  I HAVE A BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, AND 
  CONTEMPORARY SECURITY MATTERS, BUT MY KNOWLEDGE OF US 
  PERCEPTIONS OF SECURITY AND THE PROCESS OF POLICY 
  FORMULATION IS RELATIVELY MODEST. 
 
  THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
  FOUNDATIONS AND FORMULATION OF US NATIONAL SECURITY 
  POLICY IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA WOULD THEREFOR BE 
  INVALUABLE TO ME, THE MINISTRY, AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS 
  ACROSS GOVERNMENT. 
 
  LEARNING ABOUT THE US POLICY PROCESS WOULD BE 
  PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AT THIS TIME SINCE THE ROLES OF NEW 
  ZEALAND'S NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCIES -- AND THEIR 
  RELATIONSHIPS TO EACH OTHER -- ARE CURRENTLY EVOLVING IN 
  RESPONSE TO CONTEMPORARY RISKS AND CHALLENGES. 
 
  PRIOR TO JOINING THE IDR BRANCH LATE IN 2005, I WORKED 
  FOR TWO YEARS IN THE MINISTRY'S STRATEGIC POLICY (SP) 
  BRANCH.  THE SP BRANCH ANALYZES STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENTS 
  AND TRENDS AND LINKS MILITARY CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS TO 
  POLICY SETTINGS.  I EXPECT TO REMAIN IN THE DEFENSE AND 
  SECURITY FIELD FOR THE LONG TERM. 
 
  I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH A MULTI- 
  NATIONAL GROUP OF PRACTITIONERS AND ACADEMICS; A MULTI- 
  NATIONAL GROUP PROMISES A RICH AND ROBUST EXCHANGE OF 
  IDEAS.  I AM HIGHLY MOTIVATED, AND I AM COMFORTABLE WITH 
  CAMPUS LIFE AND AN ACTIVE SCHEDULE.  I HAVE THE CAPACITY 
  TO PERFORM UNDER PRESSURE, TO REVIEW LARGE QUANTITIES OF 
  INFORMATION, AND TO DISTILL AND CRITIQUE KEY CONCEPTS.
