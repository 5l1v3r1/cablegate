DAYS HAD "TESTED" HIS HOPES FOR PEACE IN THE REGION. HE 
URGED THE BISHOPS TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO KEEP CATHOLICS FROM 
LEAVING THE REGION. HE PARTICULARLY STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE 
OF MAINTAINING A CHRISTIAN PRESENCE IN JERUSALEM AND

NECESSARY TASK. IN HIS CONCLUDING REMARKS, THE POPE 
MENTIONED SO-CALLED TRAGIC SITUATIONS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES 
IN THE REGION INCLUDING IRAQ WHERE "THE EMBARGO CONTINUES TO 
CLAIM VICTIMS." HE SAID TOO MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE PAYING 
THE CONSEQUENCES FOR AN "ILL-FATED" WAR, WHOSE EFFECTS 
CONTINUE TO FALL ON THE WEAKEST AND THE DEFENSELESS. THE 
POPE ALSO CALLED ON ARAB STATES IN NORTH AFRICA TO SHOW 
HOSPITALITY TOWARD REFUGEES FLEEING THE CIVIL WAR AND FAMINE 
IN SUDAN.

ITS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. (COMMENT: THE VATICAN HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY SENSITIZED TO INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY
