The Most Appropriate Decision 
 
 
 
Rio-based center-right daily O Globo writes: "President Barack 
Obama made the painful decision to send 30,000 additional troops to 
Afghanistan in 2010, increasing the number of American military in 
the country to almost 100,000. However, it is a measure coherent 
with the U.S. President's diagnosis regarding the situation in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. (...) In the latter, the initial advances have 
been cancelled out due to the extent which the Taliban dominate 
vast areas and, together with al-Qaeda, have transformed the 
frontier region between the two countries into a jihadist's nest. A 
nuclear arsenal is housed with Islamic extremist groups in 
Pakistan, a situation that maximizes the risk of devastating 
terrorist attacks throughout the world. Obama responded to the 
request of the American Commander in Afghanistan, for whom the 
current situation is unsustainable. However (...) has already set 
the return date of the American troops: July 2011 (the President 
wishes to withdraw the troops from Iraq until the end of that 
year). (...) In his speech at West Point Academy, Obama sent a 
message to President Hamid Karzai (...) The U.S. wants to see an 
Afghan government that is effective and decisive in combating 
corruption. There is no guarantee of success in the new strategy. 
Even so, it is the most appropriate step under the circumstances."
