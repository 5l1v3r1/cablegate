REF: 06 LIMA 2942 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Roy LeTourneau confirmed that he received a final 
payment of USD 36,023.36 on January 8, 2007, from the 
Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture.  He thanked post and the 
USG for helping him resolve his dispute (over compensation 
for construction of a road from 1954 to 1968), and said he 
now considered his case fully closed.  Post worked hard to 
ensure that the new Garcia Administration honored the 
commitment made by the previous Toledo Administration to 
LeTourneau. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  LeTourneau received over USD 10 million on July 26, 
2006 as a settlement to his dispute.  The Toledo 
Administration had agreed to resolve this dispute in 2002 as 
part of negotiations for USG extension of Andean trade 
preferences (ATPDEA).  The payment should have been made on 
June 30, 2006, so LeTourneau requested interest for the 
period July 1-26, 2006, which a Peruvian consulting company 
calculated to be just over USD 36,000.
