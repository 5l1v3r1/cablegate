SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: TAIWAN REFERENDUM ON UN MEMBERSHIP 
 
¶1. Summary:  News coverage of Taiwan's major Chinese-language 
dailies October 25 focused on American Institute in Taiwan Director 
Stephen Young's remarks that the United States does not support 
Taiwan's bid for UN membership.  Two other topics were the 
resignation of Jaw Shaw-kong, chairman and president of the 
Broadcasting Corporation of China, which was once owned by the KMT, 
accusing government agencies of persecution; and Taiwan government's 
lifting a ban on local funds investing in China's stock market. 
Commenting on Director Young's remarks, the pro-independence 
"Liberty Times" said in a column that the DPP will push through 
Taiwan's UN membership regardless of any taunts or jeers.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. "Demons and Bedevilment" 
 
The Free Talks column of the pro-independence "Liberty Times" 
[circulation: 720,000] said (10/25): 
 
"... The Green camp is now firmly determined to push for UN 
membership.  It is not afraid of any demons and ghosts.  Despite all 
the sarcasm, the camp will continue running the UN bid torch relay, 
even if the most important ally, the United States, has repeatedly 
made harsh remarks, and even though American Institute in 
Taiwan/Taipei Office Director Stephen Young ridiculed the relay on a 
[recent] occasion, saying that because he has weak knees, he does 
not jog anymore and can only climb the Taipei 101 tower, which is an 
'upward' course. ..."
