¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 3-5 
activities since the last report:: 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Somalia Unit met with the Minister of Information to 
review progress on the Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) 
outreach efforts.  We emphasized the need to react quickly and 
strongly to events like the recent hospital shelling, even using 
low-budget tools like emailed press releases. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) PAO met for an off-the-record discussion with a freelance 
journalist who writes for TIME Magazine to discuss an extremely 
negative blog article the journalist wrote on one of the PD 
section's small grants in Mogadishu.  The writer appeared to 
appreciate the outreach, and was very interested in the PD work 
being done by the Somalia Unit as part of the overall policy 
engagement on Somalia. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) MIST activity: Continued audience analysis for a planned 
Islamic lecture series, possibly on Radio Mogadishu.  Also began 
developing a robust set of themes around which to base future 
programming.  The team also added a staff member, to be dedicated 
to Somalia, on January 26.
