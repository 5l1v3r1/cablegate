PLEDGE 
 
REF: STATE 3592 
 
(SBU) On January 11, Charge d'Affaires and Pol/Econ Chief 
discussed reftel guidance on Iraq policy with Dermot 
Gallagher, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Secretary 
General, and Michael Gaffey, DFA Middle East and North Africa 
Division Director.  Gallagher cited a January 11 announcement 
by Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern that Ireland had pledged an 
additional euro 3 million in emergency humanitarian 
assistance to Iraq, which would be channeled through the UN, 
the Red Cross, and NGOs to externally and internally 
displaced families.  The pledge, he added, represented a 
significant increase on the euro 7.9 million that Ireland had 
already provided for humanitarian relief in Iraq.  (Comment: 
The timing of Ireland's assistance pledge can probably be 
taken as a signal of GOI support for the overall thrust of 
the new U.S. strategy in Iraq.)  Gallagher observed that the 
GOI would continue to follow the new U.S. strategy as it 
unfolded, particularly the level of support offered by the 
U.S. Congress.
