¶1. (C)  The Finnish Foreign Ministry effectively turned 
off Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki's 
proposed June visit Helsinki, which apparently was 
intended as part of an Iranian public relations trip 
through the Nordics.  According to MFA officials and 
other diplomatic contacts, Mottaki hoped for a big 
welcome in Helsinki, requesting meetings with Prime 
Minister Vanhanen, Foreign Minister Kanerva, and array of 
business leaders, as well as a joint Iranian-Finnish 
press conference and additional public speaking 
opportunities. 
 
Thanks, but No Thanks 
--------------------- 
¶2. (C) Initially, FM Kanerva reluctantly agreed to a 
short, private meeting with Mottaki, but drew the line on 
setting up any other events.  Kanerva also expressly 
ruled out both a PM meeting and any sort of joint press 
conference.  The Iranians were clearly hoping to turn the 
event into a charm offensive, but Kanerva had no interest 
in furthering that agenda, one Finnish diplomat told us. 
The Israeli Ambassador to Helsinki, who is highly 
regarded and has gotten off to a good start with the new 
government, also got wind of the potential visit and 
lobbied hard against it.  When the MFA told the Iranians 
that a visit, if it were to occur, would be a decidedly 
low-key affair with no press and no PM -- Mottaki 
apparently withdrew the request altogether. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶3. (C) Our local contacts are not quite sure what to make 
of the aborted Iranian visit.  Last year, Iran's Deputy 
FM traveled through the region (meeting here with then-FM 
Erkki Tuomioja), and some believe that Mottaki's proposed 
trip was year part of an effort to capitalize on last 
year's trip and raise the bar a notch.  Others believe it 
could be part of a charm offensive aimed at trying to 
defuse European support for any further international 
sanctions discussions.  Either way, the Finns' "no thank 
you" is a welcome result.  End Comment.
