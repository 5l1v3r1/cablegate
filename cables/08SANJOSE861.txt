REF: STATE 109135 
 
¶1. (U) Econoffs met with officials of the Direccion General 
Aviacion Civil (DGAC) on October 28 to urge the GOCR to 
ratify the Montreal Convention (reftel).  DGAC officials, led 
by DG Jorge Fernandez Chacon, affirmed the GOCR's commitment 
to the principles of the Convention and their interest in 
ratifying it. 
 
¶2. (U) However, Chacon maintained that the DGAC had completed 
its role last year by recommending that the Convention be 
ratified.  Action had passed to the Casa Presidencial (where 
the Convention is still under review) and would ultimately 
move to the Legislative Assembly (national legislature) for 
ratification.  Given the Legislative Assembly,s arcane rules 
and plodding pace, however, ratification may not come soon. 
According to Chacon and his team, the DGAC can only follow-up 
its request and push to have the Convention sent quickly from 
the Casa Presidencial to the Legislative Assembly.  Once the 
legislature takes up action, the Executive branch,s ability 
to speed ratification is limited. 
 
¶3. (U) Chacon said he had contacted Casa Presidencial in May 
to determine the progress on the request to ratify the 
Montreal Convention.  Casa Presidencial told him then that 
completing the Central American Free Trade Agreement 
(CAFTA-DR) was the GOCR's top legislative priority; other 
issues would be addressed after CAFTA-DR implementing 
legislation was completed. 
 
¶4. (U) The DGAC officials assured Econffs they would try to 
speed up the ratification of the Montreal Convention in two 
ways.  First, they would remind the Casa Presidencial that 
ratification is also of interest to the USG.  Second, the 
DGAC would work with Diputado Luis Carlos Araya (PLN) of the 
Legislative Assembly, a key supporter of aviation issues. 
Araya is a pilot by trade and has previously assisted the 
DGAC in getting legislation passed and treaties ratified. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: The GOCR may seem to be moving at a 
snail,s pace toward ratification of the Montreal Convention, 
but Chacon and his DGAC team accurately describe the 
challenges.  Until the end of this year, the Arias 
administration is likely to remain focused on implementing 
CAFTA-DR.  All other legislative priorities, including those 
far more politically important than the Convention (such as 
fixing the nation,s outmoded crime laws or funding the 
crumbling national infrastructure), will be delayed.  In 
addition, with the next national elections scheduled for 
early 2010, the legislative process here may be even more 
complicated (and slower) than usual during 2009, which will 
be dominated by the (already started) political campaign. 
Thus, although we will continue to follow this issue and urge 
ratification of the Montreal Convention, we do not anticipate 
fast action.
