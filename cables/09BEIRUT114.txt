with the police package of lights and sirens, allow the ISF to 
perform its mission in a more reliable and professional manner, 
reaching a broader spectrum of the populace throughout the country. 
The Lebanese public is aware of these vehicles, and who donated 
them, and is becoming cognizant of the increased professional 
capabilities and capacity of the ISF. 
¶I.  Other 
 
PROBLEMS & CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN (CAP) 
 
¶A. Unmonitored resources 
The ISF has all of the donated vehicles recorded and accounted for 
in its database.  These vehicles can be checked throughout the year. 
 
¶B.  Repair and Maintenance of commodities 
¶1. ISF had some initial difficulty in establishing a repair and 
maintenance plan for the Ford Explorers. However, INL Beirut and its 
Police Team worked with the local Ford dealership and Ford Motor 
representatives, and, with their assistance, the ISF has overcome 
these iQues.  It appears that the regular maintenance is helping to 
 
keep these vehicles in good operation. 
¶2. ISF's mechanical personnel do not have the appropriate training 
to maintain American vehicles once they are no longer under new car 
warranty.  They also lack the specific equipment and/or parts for 
this maintenance.  They do not have the ability to monitor and track 
their total fleet, or document vehicle history, except manually, 
which proves cumbersome and inefficient. INL Beirut is looking into 
setting up training in U.S. vehicles for ISF mechanics and providing 
parts and accessories needed to repair the vehicles and track their 
inventory and repair history. 
¶C.  Lack of Use and Misuse of Commodities 
¶1.  The majority of Level II and Level III ballistic vests and 
pepper spray have not been issued to ISF personnel. Most of the 
equipment is still in ISF main warehouses in Beirut. Many commanders 
were not issuing the pepper spray because the police personnel under 
their command had no training on the proper use of the spray.  INL 
has met with ISF Administrative staff to ensure that commodities are 
properly distributed and to arrange U.S. training in use of U.S. 
donated equipment, where necessary.
