REF: A. 08 BAGHDAD 2658 
     ¶B. BAGHDAD 553 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Although tensions have escalated at the 
Mujahedin e-Khalq (MEK) Camp Ashraf in Iraq, press reports 
may exaggerate the situation on the ground.  After failure to 
resolve a three-week long discussion, Iraqi Army (IA) 
elements at Camp Ashraf moved to seize control of a building 
on the edge of the camp on March 13.  Approximately 100 Camp 
Ashraf Residents (CAR) created a human shield to thwart the 
takeover.  Although a confrontation continues and the GOI 
reportedly plans to arrest the demonstrators if they do not 
disperse and allow the IA forces to take control of the 
building, no violence has occurred.  The move results from 
increased GOI frustration at activities by MEK in Iraq and 
its inability to find a quick solution to the issue of the 
continued presence of the MEK in Iraq and, notably, is taking 
place while the Prime Minister is out of the country.  SEPTEL 
will address steps the Department may consider in response to 
this situation.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) For the past three weeks, the GOI and MEK at Camp 
Ashraf have been trying to resolve how to set up space to 
conduct a GOI survey of all the residents of the Camp.  The 
MEK provided trailers for the survey, but the GOI wanted a 
building in which the survey workers could reside as well as 
work.  The MEK previously offered an unoccupied building on 
the periphery of the city of Ashraf, but within the confines 
of the camp, called the Lord Slynn Building, twice to the GOI 
for use by the GOI Ashraf Committee while at Camp Ashraf and 
for family visits.  The Committee wants to use this building 
for the surveys and demanded sole access but the Camp Ashraf 
leaders refused.  IA battalion (BN) elements providing 
security for Camp Ashraf, home to approximately 3400 MEK 
members, first attempted to take control of the Lord Slynn 
Building during the evening of March 13. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The entrance to the building, which is now occupied 
by an unknown number of female residents, has been blocked by 
an estimated 100 CAR forming a human shield.  Even though the 
IA BN could easily have overreacted to the situation, their 
actions thus far have shown their efforts to adhere to the 
spirit of their assurances of humane treatment.  Even though, 
the GOI has presented an ultimatum to the demonstrators to 
either vacate the premises or be arrested.  Although the 
protesters have refused, the IA BN has yet to proceed with 
any arrests.  The GOI Committee insists that the building was 
built by the IA prior to 2003 and that the GOI has every 
right to take possession of it.  Camp Ashraf leaders refute 
these claims and contend that the MEK paid for and 
constructed the building, and, therefore, should have sole 
use. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The U.S. Military Police (MP) BN located at an 
adjacent Forward Operating Base - FOB Grizzly - continues to 
monitor the situation for any actions that could be seen as 
violations of the humane treatment assurances provided by the 
GOI to the USG (REF A).  Although the Camp Ashraf leaders 
contend that one resident had been handcuffed and another 
beaten with a baton, the MP BN reports no such incident took 
place, as far as its personnel can tell.  Reports suggesting 
an individual outside the camp, likely a vendor seeking to 
deliver goods to the camp, had been hit with a taser "20 
times" by an IA soldier during the morning of March 15 were 
Qtimes" by an IA soldier during the morning of March 15 were 
determined to be unsubstantiated by the MP BN. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Initial press statements emanating from the MEK's 
umbrella organization based in Paris, the National Council of 
Resistance of Iran, have exaggerated the situation.  One 
statement noted that "Iraqi forces have stormed Camp Ashraf." 
 These statements are likely to be picked up by international 
press outlets without verification of their veracity. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  The GOI is increasingly frustrated at the 
slow pace of its efforts to find a solution to the problem of 
the presence of 3400 Iranians it does not want on its 
territory.  It also is focused on perceived anti-government 
activities by the MEK from within the camp.  We will continue 
to monitor for any violation of the GOI's humane treatment 
assurances and press the GOI to honor its commitments.  Given 
the increased pressure on the MEK by the GOI, SEPTEL will 
address building on the posture laid out ion REF B.
