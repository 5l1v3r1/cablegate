REF: STATE 140757 
 
 (SBU) In an August 31 meeting, Hamit Osman Olcay, MFA Head 
of Border Issues Department, who covers maritime and 
aerospace issues, expressed appreciation for reftel demarche 
in support of U.S. candidate Steven Lett to head the 
International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO), including 
diplomatic note, talking points, and color campaign 
materials.  He said that Turkey would give the U.S. 
candidature due consideration, but the GOT had already 
promised to support another candidate, and he was not 
authorized to reveal the name of that candidate.  Olcay said 
Turkey would consider supporting Mr. Lett in later rounds of 
balloting if that came to pass.  The Ministry of 
Transportation and Communication will lead Turkey's 
delegation to the IMSO Assembly, but MFA has the lead for 
determining voting on the IMSO Director.
