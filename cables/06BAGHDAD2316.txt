BIRTHDAY BALL 
 
REF: STATE 107773 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel, Embassy Baghdad is planning a 
ceremony on the Embassy Annex compound to celebrate the 231st 
birthday of the United States Marine Corps.  Due to the 
current threat environment at post, our security posture 
remains high.  Post has significant COM and DOD assets 
deployed in and around the compound that will more than 
adequately provide security for the ceremony.  Post 
leadership remains vigilant in this high-threat environment.
