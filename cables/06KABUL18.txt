¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  The tone of the second week for 
Afghanistan's National Assembly (NA) has been positive, with 
members of parliament open to new ideas and mostly 
constructive debate.  The NA spent the week finalizing its 
leadership and discussing its rules of procedure.  The 
formation of caucuses and committee assignments - informally 
already in progress - will be discussed next week prior to an 
approximately 10-day break for the Muslim Eid al-Adha 
holiday.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Internal Organization Dominates Business 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The business of parliament remained focused on 
internal organization.  The leadership of both houses of 
parliament was completed with the election of secretaries 
(see para 6 for complete list of leaders).  Overall, the 
leadership of both houses lies politically in the center and 
has been working well together. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MPs have made some changes to parliamentary rules 
of procedure previously drafted by the Parliament's 
professional staff with the assistance of international 
advisors.  MPs expanded the number of committees in each 
house to match the number of ministries, and adjusted the 
numbers required to form a caucus ("political group," renamed 
"parliamentary group" in the Wolesi Jirga (WJ)), but accepted 
rules governing the civility of debate.  The desire of MPs in 
the WJ to debate the rules of procedure article-by-article 
may slow up the next agenda items of the formation of 
caucuses and committees, although informal discussions have 
already begun. 
 
Ambassador Offers Congratulations to Speakers 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) In separate meetings with WJ Speaker Yunus Qanooni 
and Meshrano Jirga Speaker Sebghatullah Mojaddedi, Ambassador 
Neumann stressed the US commitment to continued support for 
the institution of the National Assembly, and continued 
policy of non-interference in its internal politics.  Both 
Mojaddedi and Qanooni expressed their interest in US aid and 
training, and stated that business was proceeding smoothly, 
if sometimes slowly, in parliament.  Both also agreed that 
training programs should come after the selection of caucuses 
and committees and that international visits by MPs should 
not occur until more time has passed.  Qanooni reiterated his 
renunciation of his self-appointed position as head of the 
opposition and stated in believable terms that he hopes to 
work well with President Karzai and the executive branch. 
Mojaddedi stated that he intends to continue in his role as 
head of the Taliban reconciliation program (PTS), and was 
positive about its progress and acceptance by former Taliban. 
 He will be in Turkey for medical treatment for two to three 
weeks beginning January 3. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Observers within and outside the National Assembly 
were unanimous in their optimism about the first weeks of 
business.  While Malalai Joya made headlines on the first day 
of debate for a poorly received statement attacking the human 
rights abuses committed by various MPs in the past, debate 
overall has been constructive, with positive contributions 
from sometimes unexpected sources.  In a separate meeting 
with Poloffs, one Secretariat Office Director said that he 
was very surprised at how well the MPs were working together. 
 The Assembly has yet to stumble on any notable political 
issues, but has yet to truly address policy matters.  The 
constructive attitude displayed by many MPs, however, bodes 
well for the future. END COMMENT.
