1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Chemical Industries 
(Far East) Ltd., No. 3, Jalan Samulun, Singapore (Chemical 
Industries).  The items in question are five valves exported on or 
about August 29, 2006 and valued at USD 2,900.  On the applicable 
shippers export declaration (SED), the items are classified as 
2B350.  This ECCN is controlled for chemical/biological weapons (CB) 
reasons.  The exporter was Flowserve Corporation of Cookeville, 
Tennessee. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, Chemical 
Industries has been in existence since 1962.  Its paid-up share 
capital is the Singapore equivalent of USD 50 million.  Singapore 
nationals, Lim Yew Tou Eric, Lim Soo Peng, Chua Sui Leng, Wan Soon 
Bee and Ong Choo Lin Valerie are listed as directors.  The company 
is publicly traded. 
 
¶4.  On June 22, 2007, the ECO met with Mr. J. Immanuvel Raj, Head, 
Control and Instrumentation, Mr. Lim Yi Yung, Operations Manager, 
Mr. Lim Yew Tee Collin, Deputy Plant Manager and Mr. Manickam 
Venkatesan, Maintenance Leader.  According to Mr. Lim Yi Yung, 
Chemical Industries produces industrial chemicals for use in 
Singapore and abroad.  For example, it provides chlorine gas to 
water treatment facilities in Singapore.  The facility where the PSV 
occurred is clearly a chemicals production facility and is located 
in a secure area of Singapore restricted to chemicals and related 
industries. 
 
¶5.  Mr. J. Immanuvel Raj provided the ECO with documentation 
verifying that the company had received all the valves.  The ECO 
inspected four of the five valves that were the subject of the PSV. 
They were located in the company's storage area and are spares. 
The final unit was in the production line and could not be viewed. 
 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Chemical Industries appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the commodities shipped since Chemical 
Industries cooperated with the PSV, provided ECO with access to the 
items and operates a line of business consistent with the use of the 
items.  The ECO recommends that this PSV be classified as Favorable.
