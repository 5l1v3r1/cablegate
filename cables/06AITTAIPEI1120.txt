SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: DPP PARTY REFORM CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1. Summary: Taiwan dailies March 31 focused on KMT Chairman Ma 
Ying-jeou's meeting with President Chen Shui-bian slated for April 
3, and junior DPP legislators' plan to hold a conference to discuss 
party reforms. 
 
¶2. The editorials March 31 all commented on DPP legislators' call 
for a party reform conference.  The editorial in the 
pro-independence "Liberty Times," Taiwan's largest daily, suggested 
that the DPP government carry out reforms and pay attention to 
mainstream public opinion.  The pro-independence "Taiwan Daily" ran 
an editorial calling upon the DPP government to conduct reforms, and 
upon the Taiwan people to protect the grass-roots regime.  The 
centrist, pro status quo "China Times" editorialized that President 
Chen Shui-bian's attitude toward the party's reform conference could 
easily determine the forum's outcome.  The editorial in the 
pro-unification "United Daily News" urged the DPP to draw a 
demarcation line between President Chen Shui-bian and the party. 
The pro-independence "Taiwan News" editorialized that the DPP 
leadership could help revive the party.  End summary. 
 
A) "To Remain a Grass-Roots Ruling Party, the DPP Should Carry out 
Reforms and Pay Attention to Mainstream Public Opinion" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 600,000] said in 
an editorial (3/31): 
 
"... It is such a myth that 'Ma Ying-jeou is impeccable.'  If the 
DPP wants to defeat Ma in the 2008 presidential election and remain 
as the ruling party, high-ranking DPP officials must learn the 
lessons [of the previous elections and recent polls] and have the 
resolve for party reforms.  They must also present a performance 
that is in accordance with mainstream public opinion." 
 
B) "The DPP Must Reflect on Itself and Carry out Reforms; Taiwan 
People Should Attend a Nation-Wide Movement to Protect the 
Grass-Roots Regime" 
 
The pro-independence "Taiwan Daily" [circulation: 100,000] 
editorialized (3/31): 
 
"... In terms of protecting the grass-roots regime, the ruling DPP 
should shoulder the greatest responsibility, and actually carry out 
reforms.  The party should also earn back people's trust and support 
by non-corrupt behavior and substantive performances.  None of the 
Taiwan people should be bystanders; they should support the 
government through public opinion and protect the regime by 
ballots." 
 
C) "The Ruler's Mentality is Critical for the Success of the DPP 
Party Reform Conference" 
 
The pro-status quo "China Times" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (3/31): 
 
"... Currently, the DPP faces not only a 'crisis' created by lower 
and lower approval ratings, but also a 'difficult situation' 
confronts the ruling elites and DPP supporters. ..." 
 
"However, the fact that junior legislators dare to collectively 
speak out against high-ranking DPP officials shows that the party 
still has vitality in terms of democracy. ... 
 
"... If high-ranking DPP officials, such as President Chen 
Shui-bian, would be willing to hand over power, share their power 
with others, and listen to peoples' voices, that would be the key to 
enable the DPP to walk away from the [party's] low-popularity. 
 
D)  "Abandon A-bian and Protect the Party: the DPP Must Appoint 
Another Character to Speak for the Party." 
 
The pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] said 
in its editorial (3/31): 
 
"... No matter through a party reform conference or an interim party 
assembly, the DPP must democratically re-construct its policy 
statements and ethics.  The DPP must also appoint other political 
figures to promote its policy as well as ethics in order to reveal 
to the public that Chen Shui-bian is Chen Shui-bian, and the DPP is 
the DPP. ..." 
 
E)  "DPP Can Revise Only by Leadership" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" [circulation: 
20,000] opined in an editorial (3/31): 
 
"... In the wake of these events, the process of party affairs and 
organization re-examination and reform promised by DPP Chairman Yu 
Shyi-kun in his January campaign for the party chairmanship post can 
no longer be delayed. ... 
 
"We strongly urge that party leaders and factions do not fall into 
the temptation of using this process to 'settle accounts' or to make 
displays of political purity or treating it as a platform for 
jockeying for position in the run-up tit e year-end Taipei and 
Kaohsiung mayoral polls or the upcoming legislative or presidential 
elections. ..."
