¶1.  Summary:  Syrian papers on June 27 marked the 33rd anniversary 
of the liberation of Al-Qunaytirah with reports and articles 
glorifying the "heroism" and sacrifices of Syrian forces during the 
October 1973 war and stressing that the occupied Golan will 
definitely return to Syria.  Papers cited a lecture by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Dr. Faysal al-Miqdad in Al-Qunaytirah on June 26 in 
which he said that "the liberation of the occupied Arab territories, 
headed by the Syrian Golan, is the top priority of President Asad's 
policy."  Al-Miqdad added, "the Syrian people and their leader 
Bashar al-Asad strongly believe that the Golan will return to the 
motherland, Syria." 
 
Independent al-Watan quoted a well-informed diplomat as saying that 
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will visit the Palestinian 
Territories, with "an amended Roadmap."  The visit will be within a 
larger tour that Rice is going to take in the region in a couple of 
weeks, the source said.  The tour will include Egypt, Saudi Arabia, 
Jordan and other countries.  The source added that Rice's goal will 
be to put together the two quartets:  the Arab one and the 
international one. 
 
Independent al-Watan cited a report that the number of Iraqi 
refugees in Syria has risen by 200,000 since the last estimate ten 
weeks ago, to reach 1.4 million.  The report said that the Syrian 
government is in need of $60 million to provide medical and social 
assistance to these refugees, but has so far received only $12 
million. 
 
All papers featured a statement by Syrian Ambassador in Tehran Hamed 
Hassan made during a celebration at the Syrian embassy in Tehran on 
the occasion of the formation of the Syrian-Iranian Friendship 
Association on June 26.  Hassan confirmed the strength of historic 
Syrian-Iranian relations, adding, "the two countries are determined 
to enhance their relations in all fields, which would benefit them 
both and benefit the entire region."

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
--------------------------- 
 
"It Is a Policy of Killing" 
 
--------------------------- 
 
Umar Jaftali, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, wrote 
(6/27):  "The Bush administration wants the world to be a 
subservient follower of its policies, and it does not mind violating 
all ethical values and divine precepts to realize this objective. 
 
"What proves this is US practices in Iraq and Afghanistan.... 
 
"Washington is pursuing a policy of killing, promotion of terrorism, 
and pleasure in torturing people in Abu Ghurayb, Guantanamo, and 
secret prisons.... 
 
SIPDIS 
 
"Don't neoconservatives in the Bush administration, who claim to be 
advocates of law and freedom, feel ashamed when they bless the 
culture of violence and killing, support Israel's crimes, and bring 
mercenaries like Black Water to persist in human rights violations? 
 
"The United States has lost its credibility in the Arab region and 
the rest of the world...." 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
"Why Are All the Events in Lebanon and Palestine Happening?" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
Dr. Issa al-Shammas, a columnist in government-owned Al-Ba'th, wrote 
(6/27):  "What is happening in Lebanon and the Palestinian 
territories is an extension of what is happening in Iraq within the 
framework of the American policy to build a new Middle East based on 
blind chaos, division, and conflict among sons of the same 
country.... 
 
"All leaders in Palestine and Lebanon must shoulder their national 
and historical responsibilities.... Either preserving the land, the 
identity, and the country or losing everything and falling into the 
trap of the American plan of capitulation and hegemony...." 
 
------------------------------ 
 
"Mere Questions about Lebanon" 
 
------------------------------- 
 
Ibrahim Darraji, an editorialist in independent al-Watan, wrote 
(6/27):  "The security breaches in Lebanon, which are accompanied by 
an escalating political crisis, are part of the American plan to 
spread chaos in the region.... 
 
"The pro-government team in Lebanon is providing cover for those 
involved in the bombings and assassinations, which serve the 
purposes of known forces and countries...." 
 
-------------------- 
 
"The New Assignment" 
 
-------------------- 
 
Dr. Sa'id Musallam, a commentator in government-owned Al-Thawra, 
wrote (6/27):  "The British people, who forced Blair to resign, will 
not be happy with his appointment as envoy to the International 
Quartet, which has so far offered nothing other than doses of 
despair and frustration and response to Israeli demands, with 
blessings from the American master, and which promises further 
concessions in Blair's new era.... 
"Countries of the region, where Bush and Blair bet on polishing 
their images through the colors of death and chaos and symphonies of 
sectarian violence and civil infighting, did not, and will not, get 
from these peace activists anything other than deterioration, 
division, and one storm after another...."
