Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Ukrainian Ambassador to Ashgabat Viktor Mayko 
will travel to Kabul in mid-June to present his 
credentials to President Karzai.  Ukraine previously had 
been represented by its ambassador in Tashkent.  Mayko 
will be a valuable interlocutor on energy issues and also 
on the trials and tribulations of trying to do business 
with President Niyazov.  Mayko is an excellent diplomat 
and is interested in having a productive relationship 
with Embassy Kabul.  End Summary. 
 
Mayko to Kabul 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On May 24 Charge met with Ukrainian Embassy 
Economics Counselor Olga Timush, and Political First 
Secretary Igor Roman to discuss Ambassador Mayko's plans 
 
SIPDIS 
to present his credentials to Afghanistani President 
Karzai in June.  According to Roman, Yushchenko has 
invited Karzai to visit Ukraine in the second half of 
¶2006.  (Timush and Roman also provided the current state 
of play on gas negotiations reported ref A.)  Timush said 
that Mayko was anxious to establish strong ties to the 
U.S. Embassy in Kabul and hoped to be able to call on 
Ambassador Neumann during his visit.  Timush and Roman 
plan to travel to Kabul June 8 to lay the groundwork for 
Mayko's visit.  They noted that in addition to discussing 
policy, they were interested in discussing logistics, in 
particular communications.  Charge offered to forward the 
request and provide Mayko's biography to Embassy Kabul 
(Ref B). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Timush and Roman avoided answering Charge's 
question about why accreditation was being shifted from 
Tashkent to Ashgabat, but agreed that Ukraine's expertise 
in the pipeline construction sector could assist any 
eventual Trans-Afghan Pipeline (TAP) project.  To this 
end they emphasized Maykos' prior job as Deputy Director 
of Ukrainian construction giant "Interbudmontazh." 
(http://www.interbudmontazh.com/eng/home.php) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Charge reviewed the current state of play on 
the TAP, noting the triumvirate of unknowns: 
 
-- volume of gas supplies in Turkmenistan, 
 
-- security in Afghanistan, and 
 
-- volume of demand from Pakistan/India. 
 
Charge also noted that though the USG thought the idea of 
a TAP had considerable merit, U.S. companies were not 
showing significant interest in this project because of 
these unknowns. 
 
Mayko's Biography 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ambassador Mayko is well and favorably known to 
the embassy.  He is eager to cooperate with the United 
States and exchange views and information.  Since his 
arrival in 2005 (and following the election of 
Yushchenko) his entire mission has been on a bit of a 
friendship offensive with us.  Mayko speaks excellent 
English and has an acerbic wit which, to the delight of 
the diplomatic corps, he regularly deploys at the expense 
of his Russian colleagues. 
 
¶5.  (U) Following is the biography the Ukrainian Embassy
