¶1. (U) Post discussed reftel points with DFA Office of United 
Nations and Other International Organizations (UNIO) Director 
Leah Ruiz regarding the October 1 P5 1 talks with Iran.  Post 
emphasized that the discussions were a constructive 
beginning; that they must now be followed by positive action; 
and that the U.S. sidebar meeting with Iranian 
representatives was direct and candid.  Post informed 
Director Ruiz of our concerns over Iran's nuclear program and 
the need for Iran to take concrete steps to meet 
international obligations.  Post explained the serious 
international concern over the clandestine enrichment plant 
near Qom and the need for Iran to cooperate fully with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in allowing 
unfettered access to facilities, personnel, and documents. 
Post also informed Director Ruiz that Iranian representatives 
agreed to a further meeting in Vienna on October 18. 
 
¶2. (U) Director Ruiz assured Post that the DFA would 
carefully consider the U.S. position and, in future meetings 
with Iranian officials, would urge them to continue 
constructive dialogue with the IAEA regarding these issues.
