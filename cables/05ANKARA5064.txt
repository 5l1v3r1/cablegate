SUBJECT: SECOND THREAT LETTER RECEIVED BY EMBASSY OFFICER 
 
REF: ANKARA 4939 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On August 29, 2005 Embassy Deputy Political 
Officer Charles Blaha received a threatening letter, written 
in Arabic, similar to the letter received by post's Political 
Military Counselor (then Acting DCM) (reftel) on August 22, 
¶2005.  The letter was received by Blaha through the embassy 
mail room on August 24 or 25, but was not opened until August 
¶29.  The letter was post marked August 20 from Ataturk 
airport in Istanbul.  The letter was sent using an envelope 
from the "Swiss Hotel - The Bosphorus", in Istanbul. The 
letter was addressed to: 
 
Mr. Charles BLAHA 
Ataturk Bulvari. No.110 
Kavaklidere 
Ankara 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The following is a translation of the letter. 
 
In the Name of God the Beneficent and Merciful 
 
"Kill them and God will punish them with your hands.  He will 
bring dishonor to them and let you triumph over them.  The 
legions of believers will see (this happen) and the wrath of 
their hearts will go forth.  God will forgive those he deems 
worthy, and God is just to them." 
 
"For the flag of Jihad will be raised, waving over Turkey, to 
marshal you one by one in city after city...and the martyrs 
have actually prepared for you this time especially...they 
will hunt down your wives and your children (sons) in their 
homes and in their schools wherever they are...and there will 
be no safe place for you in this country or in any other 
country in the world..." 
 
"And our date (date of the Mujahidin to take action) is 
(coming) soon...very soon". 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The letter was in Kufi type written font using 
Modern Standard Arabic.  The dialect appears to be someone 
native to Saudi-Gulf Arabic.  As in the first letter, the 
author appears to be someone who has a religious vocabulary 
and studies the Quran. 
 
¶4. (SBU) RSO has forwarded the envelope and letter to the 
Turkish National Police Intelligence Division for further 
investigation.  Because of the reference to the school the 
Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) has been 
briefed on the threat. The DODDs school which is located on 
Balgat base opened today for the new school year.  RSO will 
also brief other schools where Embassy children are enrolled 
in the coming days. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Point of contact is RSO Janet Sabo at 
90-312-455-5555 ext. 2348.
