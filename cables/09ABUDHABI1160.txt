REF: KABUL 3993; ABU DHABI 745 
 
(SBU) Post supports Embassy Kabul's suggestion (Ref A) that 
relevant USG officials engage the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development 
(ADFD), which is tasked with programming UAEG financial support for 
Afghanistan (as well as its $300 million pledge for Pakistan).  As 
reported in Ref B, ADFD has repeatedly expressed interest in 
cooperating with the USG on implementation of this funding.  While 
post can support visitors on the margins of the January SRAP 
meeting in Abu Dhabi, ADFD Acting Director General Mohammed Saif Al 
Suwaidi has also expressed an interest in traveling to Washington 
in early 2010 to meet with USAID and other USG officials.  Al 
Suwaidi told EconOff he hopes to improve ADFD coordination with and 
support for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other 
countries, including Latin America.  If USG officials are available 
to travel to the UAE, the newly established federal Office of 
Foreign Aid Coordination may also be able to gather other relevant 
humanitarian organizations, such as the Red Crescent Authority, 
Sheikh Zayid bin Sultan Charitable Organization, and other 
prominent groups.
