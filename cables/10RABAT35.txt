The Government of Morocco has informed the Embassy verbally 
and via diplomatic note (e-mailed to NEA/MAG) of its 
intention to present itself as a candidate for a seat on the 
United Nations Security Council for 2012-13.  The GOM has 
requested early notification of support for its candidacy, 
noting that it seeks to represent the Maghreb in accordance 
with a rotational schedule worked out previously among the 
six regional states.  Thus far, 35 countries have confirmed 
their support for Morocco's candidacy, according to the MFA. 
Please advise how the Embassy should respond.
