¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "China declares anti-missile interception successful" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/12)(pg 1): "Experts said that this is the 
first time that China has announced its anti-missile experiment 
results to the world.  A Global Times poll revealed that 99% Chinese 
netizens are supportive of China's anti-missile system.  Yang 
Chengjun, a missile expert, said that China's actions are not 
directed against any country.  However, the actions of some 
countries, whose actions undermine China's peaceful reunification, 
are also noteworthy.  China's timely showcase of some of its 
strength sends the signal that China is not only determined, but 
that it also has the ability and means to protect its national 
security and core interests.  Professor Jin Canrong at People's 
University of China said that he thinks China's anti-missile 
interception experiment is irrelevant to U.S. sales of Patriot-3 
missiles to Taiwan because that missile is defensive, not offensive. 
 He also said that China has the right to develop an anti-missile 
system, which is a necessary step for its military modernization. 
China always advocates for a defensive military strategically.  The 
anti-missile system doesn't change this; it strengthens it." 
 
b. "U.S.-China relations need to overcome trade frictions" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(01/12)(pg 2): "A trade war between the United 
States and China would be a catastrophe for international trade and 
the two countries.  This is the biggest concern of the 'post 
financial crisis' era.  If China retaliates, U.S. companies within 
China will complain, which will be too hard for Obama to handle. 
Therefore, the United States should not be too complacent or too 
demanding when trading with China.  Under these circumstances, 
mainstream scholars should not take actions which are against the 
general trend, such as stating one's irrational opinions on the 
issue.  Meanwhile, Sino-U.S. relations are not so easily talked ill 
of by one or two scholars.  No matter what, the relationship needs 
to overcome its trade frictions." 
 
¶2. WAR ON TERROR 
 
"A large-scale encirclement and suppression of Al Qaeda in Yemen: at 
present the U.S. government has no intention of sending U.S. troops 
to Yemen" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(01/12)(pg 
3): " Giving up on sending troops to Yemen meets the U.S. 
counterterrorism strategy's new requirements.  Since Obama took the 
office, he made a major adjustment to the previous U.S. 
counterterrorism strategy of President Bush's time, withdrawing 
troops from Iraq and emphasizing the improvement of the U.S.' image 
in the Islamic world.  Sending troops to Yemen will undoubtedly 
influence the global counterterrorism deployment of the U.S.  What's 
more, regarding Yemen's complicated geographic situation, by not 
sending troops to Yemen the United States can avoid another 'Afghan 
War'.  Not sending troops also shows that, due to the lack of 
counterterrorism resources, the United States does not have very 
many choices." 
 
¶3. NORTH KOREA 
 
"The economy of the DPRK remains slow; sanctions urgently need to be 
lifted" 
 
The Beijing-based newspaper sponsored by official intellectual 
publication Guangming Daily and Guangdong Provincial official 
publication Nanfang Daily The Beijing News (Xin Jing Bao)(01/12)(pg 
A24): "Jin Canrong, the Deputy Dean of the School of International 
Studies at Renmin University, said there are three reasons that the 
DPRK expressed willingness to rejoin the Six-Party Talks.  First, 
the DPRK leaders need the international community to lift sanctions 
so that the DPRK economy can recover.  Second, the attitudes of the 
United States toward the DPRK have changed and the two countries may 
privately make mutual promises.  Third, China, as a mediator, has 
made great efforts to coordinate with the United States and the 
DPRK.  Professor Jin also said that more sincerity from the United 
States is needed if substantial results are expected to be achieved 
from the Six-Party Talks.  The current, temporary, truce agreement 
between North and South Korea doesn't have legal binding power. 
Only when North Korea signs a peace agreement with South Korea, can 
the U.S. consider it official."
