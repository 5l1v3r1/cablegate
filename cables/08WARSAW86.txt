¶1. (U) Summary.  January 17, Ambassador Victor Ashe presented an 
award to Professor Henryk Jasiorowski, acknowledging his scientific 
work and leadership to develop Polish and global agriculture.  The 
award, a post-initiated project of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), recognizes Jasiorowski, an animal scientist 
specializing in cattle breeding, for his support for sound 
scientific practices and his agricultural leadership. Jasiorowski 
was Chancellor of Warsaw Agricultural University (SGGW) and 
Assistant Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
in Rome, among other leadership posts.  In remarks, Jasiorowski 
thanked America for its long term assistance to develop Poland.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Professor Henryk Jasiorowski's accomplishments range from 
ground-breaking scientific research on livestock genetics to 
leadership positions as Chancellor of the Warsaw Agricultural 
University (SGGW), Assistant Director General of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and a board member of 
the international charitable organization, Heifer Project 
International.  Professor Jasiorowski's dedication to international 
agriculture and science began as a student at the Warsaw 
Agricultural University.  In 1948, while an undergraduate student, 
he had the opportunity to spend almost a year working on American 
farms and studying at the University of Wisconsin.  Benefitting 
America, when Jasiorowski was chief of FAO animal research in the 
1970's he led a landmark feed trial that culminated in recognition 
in Europe of the American Holstein as one of the globe's top dairy 
breeds.  Jasiorowski was a USDA Cochran Fellow, later in his career. 
 In Poland, generations of students in the animal sciences have been 
influenced by Jasiorowski. Jasiorowski, at age 84, currently manages 
a successful grain, horticulture and beef cattle farm in Poland 
along with his daughter and grandson.  He writes frequently and 
retains his influence as an advocate for close relations with the 
United States. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Accepting the award, Jasiorowski commented that his 
experience sixty years ago in Wisconsin was the opportunity that 
shaped his career.  He said that cultural, economic, and scientific 
exchanges with the United States have been a cornerstone of Poland's 
movement to freedom and economic success.  While an ardent supporter 
of Poland's membership in the European Union and its Common 
Agricultural Policy, Jasiorowski repeated several times that for a 
successful business and economic model, Poland must follow the 
example of the United States.  He said that he shouldn't be 
receiving an award, but America should. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In remarks, Ashe said that Jasiorowski was due the honor 
and gratitude of the United States as an agricultural scientist, 
mentor, leader, and friend.  Ashe added that the professor's life 
should inspire us all to learn more, travel more and contribute more 
to humanity.  Ashe said that it can't have been easy for Jasiorowski 
to visit the United States in 1948 and to have been so active in 
promoting strong relations with the United States over his career. 
Jasiorowski received a plaque and small honoraria paid by USDA. 
 
¶5.  (U) The event, hosted at the CMR, was attended by nearly 200 
guests, representing key contacts from the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Parliament, business, associations, research institutes, 
universities, media, family and friends of Jasiorowski.  Heifer 
Project, International sent a representative from the United States 
and representatives of U.S. animal breeders attended.  AgMinister 
Sawicki earlier expressed his regret to AgCounselor for not 
attending, but congratulated USDA and the embassy on its choice of 
the Professor.  The Ministry was represented by an Under Secretary, 
Artur Lawniczak.  The idea, award and program, were developed by 
USDA's Agatt Kathryn A. Snipes.  Embassy PA supported the event and 
Country Team attended including Exec, Econ, FCS, and ODC.  Photos 
and details are available at http://poland.usembassy.gov/ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment. The event succeeded in highlighting to contacts 
and media the long-term, positive U.S.-Poland relationship.  In 
agriculture, Poland's policy is more influenced by Brussels than 
Washington today.  The United States is admired for its achievements 
in business and scientific research.  The mission's plan to 
influence Poland in agricultural policy development for such issues 
as a Doha Round agreement, CAP reform, biotechnology, animal 
cloning, and other issues will be to emphasize these strengths. 
Agricultural scientists in Poland frequently can be overruled in 
policy debates on the issues above and deserve support for their
