SUBJECT: VENEZUELA: NO RESPONSE ON VIOLATION OF U.S. 
AVIATION REGULATIONS 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Venezuelan government has not responded to the 
March 19 EEB/TRA/OTP Memorandum on FAA Case Number 
2008EA250055, the "Violation of Federal Aviation 
Regulations."  The FAA documents detail the case against a 
pilot for Venezuelan government-owned petroleum company 
PDVSA.  The violations included operating an aircraft in the 
United States "in a careless or reckless manner so as to 
endanger the life or property of another." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post transmitted the FAA documentation to Venezuelan 
Civil Aviation Authority INAC on April 28.  Prior to the 
response deadline of June 19, Post contacted INAC to inquire 
about the status of the case.  INAC initially denied receipt 
of the package.  After multiple follow up calls, on June 22 
INAC acknowledged that it had in fact received the package on 
April 28, but told Econoff there was no response as of yet 
from INAC President Jose Martinez.  As instructed in the 
memorandum, Post will give INAC an additional 90 days (until 
September 19, 2009) to respond.
