Ref: State 28744 
 
 
¶1.    On March 4, 2004, Chief of Section met with Haluk Aca, 
Head  of  the  Visa  Department at the MFA  to  discuss  GOT 
acceptance   of  Iraqi  diplomatic  and  service  (official) 
passports and the Interim Travel Document for visa issuance. 
She also provided him a copy of the revised CPA Order 16. 
 
 
¶2.   Mr. Aca explained that the GOT currently accepts all 
Iraqi passports and, on rare occasion with advance 
permission from the MFA, will accept the Interim Travel 
Document.  When MFA authorizes travel with the Interim 
Travel Document it is equal to the US passport waiver.  The 
entry visa and stamps are placed on a different paper, not 
the interim travel document. 
 
 
¶3.   The GOT does not plan to ever accept the Interim Travel 
Document on a regular basis but will continue to accept all 
Iraqi passports.  The GOT is looking forward to a secure 
ICAO compatible regular, official and diplomatic Iraqi 
passports, and refugee travel documents.
