¶4.  Post requests Department guidance regarding the most efficient 
process for approving short annual leave travel out of Sudan for 
essential staff.  Some of these staff members have had put off their 
R&R travel due to demands following the ICC announcement and 
expulsion of 13 NGOs.  It is important that essential staff get 
breaks to allow for those who stay behind to address demands here.
