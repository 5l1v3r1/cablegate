DEPLOYMENT 
 
REF: STAVRIDIS-USMAAG PERU EMAIL OF 9/27/07 
 
(SBU) In the absence of established status of forces 
protections, Post, after reviewing current circumstances and 
potential risks, concurs with SOUTHCOM's recommendation (ref) 
to extend to October 15, 2007, the current deployment to Peru 
of six (6) U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers.  The troops' 
current clearance will expire September 30, 2007.  The 
soldiers will continue their counter-narcoterrorism mission 
if and when the GOP approves an extended diplomatic 
clearance.  Until that time, the troops will stand down in 
Lima under MAAG administrative control.  Note: U.S. Southern 
Command Operations (J3) recommends redeployment of the team 
to CONUS if the extension is not approved by October 14, 2007.
