INVITATION TO BURMESE FM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 124139 
 
(SBU) CDA discussed reftel points with MFA Deputy Political 
Director Stephan Muller on August 7. Muller suggested that 
Burma poses the same problem to EU dialogue with ASEAN 
members as Zimbabwe poses to EU-AU discussions. The concern 
exists that withholding an invitation to Burma could dissuade 
other regional leaders from attending ASEM and dilute the 
meeting's importance. Muller indicated that any EU engagement 
with Burma would focus on discussing Burmese human rights 
abuses and pushing for change and improvement.
