 ¶1.  This is an action message -- see para 8. 
 
¶2.  (U) The UK FCO has renewed its request to us to provide 
work space and services to a UK diplomat to be deployed here 
for an undetermined length of time (REF A). 
 
¶3. (SBU) We strongly support a UK diplomatic presence in Chad 
on a permanent or semi-permanent basis (REFS B and D). 
 
¶4. (SBU) In view of our current Embassy facilities, we would 
have difficulty providing space for a UK diplomat.  There 
will be security issues to consider as well, although we 
understand that those have been worked out in other locations 
where the USG has hosted UK officials on a long-term basis. 
 
¶5. (SBU) We have discussed both our desire to see a UK 
diplomatic presence here in Chad, and the space-related 
difficulties that we envision with hosting a UK diplomat, 
with visiting UK delegations.  We have recommended that HMG 
seek space from the EU Commission Delegation or from the 
French or German Missions here, among other possibilities 
(REF D). 
 
¶6. (SBU) We suspect that there may be political factors 
involved in the UK's failure to secure, or unwillingness to 
accept, space and services from a European partner. 
 
¶7. (SBU) We therefore request that this issue be addressed in 
Washington and European capitals.

ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) That the Department address this matter with EU, UK 
and French officials, with the goal of satisfying the UK's 
stated desire to establish a diplomatic presence in Chad on a 
permanent or semi-permanent basis in a location acceptable to 
all concerned.
