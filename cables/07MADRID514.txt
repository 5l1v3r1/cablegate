¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA 
Sub-director General for Human Rights Fernando 
Fernandez-Arias on March 19.  Fernandez-Arias said that Spain 
is appalled by the abuses in Zimbabwe and he noted that Spain 
has issued a strong condemnation of the abuses on March 15. 
(NOTE: Text of communique follows. END NOTE.)  If a 
resolution surfaces in the UNHRC, he said Spain would 
definitely support it, although he underscored that Spain 
would not take a leadership role, as Spain is not a member of 
the UNHRC.  Fernandez-Arias was pessimistic about such a 
resolution's chances for success, noting that the African 
group is currently the most powerful voting block in the 
UNHRC. The group would be hard pressed to support a 
resolution condemning Zimbabwe.  He added that it would be 
worse to propose a resolution and be defeated than to have 
done nothing. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Furthermore, Spain does not feel that the UNHRC 
should be used as a tool to address the abuse-du-jour with 
country specific resolutions, which it views as the downfall 
of the previous Human Rights Committee.  The Council should 
be an instrument for long term analysis and action.  As a 
non-member, Spain has practiced restraint in its interactions 
with the Council, but its goal remains the establishment of a 
"universal periodic review mechanism." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fernandez-Arias acknowledged that groups are already 
using the Council for country specific resolutions, such as 
the Arab group's proposal of a new resolution on the 
excavations at the Maghreb Gate in Jerusalem.  He underscored 
that responsible members ought not support such practice.  He 
said the UNHCR is increasingly being viewed as a "B-chamber" 
for causes that cannot gain UNSC support, such as resolutions 
on Israel.  Spain would rather see it used for more profound 
investigation and long-term work on human rights. 
 
¶4. (U) (BEGIN TEXT OF MARCH 15 COMMUNIQUE:) 
 
The Spanish Government expresses its condemnation of the use 
of violence by the Government of Zimbabwe to repress, last 
March 11, 2007, a peaceful meeting convoked by the Council of 
Churches of Zimbabwe which was attended by leaders of the 
political opposition with parliamentary representation and 
members of civil society.  The government also condemns the 
violence against detainees while they were in police custody. 
 
The Government offers its condolences to the family of the 
member of the MDC opposition party killed by gunshots from 
the forces of public order during the repression of the 
Sunday meeting. 
 
The Spanish Government demands the Zimbabwean authorities 
bring to a close the appropriate investigations with the 
greatest speed and diligence, and that the parties 
responsible for these actions be identified.  It also demands 
of the Zimbabwean government that appropriate measures be 
taken to avoid the commission of similar actions in the 
future. 
 
The Government is pleased by the fact that the opposition and 
civil society leaders have been released today March 14 by 
the judicial authorities of Zimbabwe due to the lack of 
charges against them. (END TEXT.)
