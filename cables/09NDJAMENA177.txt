SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Chadian President Idriss Deby Itno held a rally 
May 13 in N'Djamena to protest against "Sudanese aggression," 
given the May 4-7 incursion by Chadian rebels from Sudan. 
Five times during the President's 15-minute speech, he 
focused specifically on Sudanese President Omar El Bashir, 
saying that the GOS leader's regime was continuing efforts to 
destabilize Chad, that it was still supporting Chadian 
rebels, and that it was ignoring the many accords signed 
between Chad and Sudan.  Deby said that he was still 
reviewing ties with Sudan but that Chad would no longer 
participate in mediation efforts in which Sudan was a part. 
Deby expressed his disappointment with the international 
community, and specifically with the African Union  and other 
regional organizations, saying that he wanted the UN and not 
the AU to resolve the Darfur crisis.  GOS military operations 
to mop up rebels continue in the east, including a brief 
cross-over into Sudan.  Rebel atrocities against Chadian 
military and civilians are coming to light.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
RALLY AGAINST SUDAN 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Chadian President Idriss Deby Itno held a rally 
May 13 in N'Djamena to protest against "Sudanese aggression," 
given the May 4-7 incursion by Chadian rebels from Sudan. 
Estimates put the well-mannered crowd -- a mix of civilian 
and military personnel -- at over 5,000.  Various unions and 
groups paraded into Independence Place, across from the 
Presidential Palace, bearing anti-Sudan and anti-Bashir signs 
as well as pro-Deby signs.  Pro-government party members were 
present; the coalition of opposition parties did not attend, 
despite the President's direct invitation on May 9.  A 
similar rally took place simultaneously in the eastern town 
of Abeche. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Deby headlined the 45-minute event.  Five times 
during his 15-minute speech, he focused specifically on 
Sudanese President Omar El Bashir, saying that the GOS 
leader's regime was continuing efforts to destabilize Chad, 
that it was still supporting Chadian rebels, and that it was 
ignoring the many accords signed between Chad and Sudan. 
Deby again proclaimed that Chad was reviewing its relations 
with Sudan and mulling severing diplomatic ties.  He said 
that Chad would no longer take part in mediation efforts with 
Sudan, such as the Dakar Contact Group or the Doha Accord, 
and promised that Chad would collaborate fully with the 
International Criminal Court regarding the case against 
Bashir. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Deby expressed his disappointment with the 
international community, and specifically with the African 
Union and other regional organizations.  He said those 
organizations were incapable of resolving the crisis in 
Darfur.  He added that Chad wanted the UN, and not the AU, to 
resolve Sudan's crisis.  Deby thanked Chad's "friends" for 
their support of Chad and condemnation of Sudan, singling out 
the UN Security Council, France, the United States, and 
Senegal. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The President also reached out to Chadian rebel 
groups, saying that both the government and he personally 
welcomed those who wished to return to their mother country. 
 
--------------------- 
ON-GOING MILITARY OPS 
--------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  GOC continues operations in the east to mop up 
fleeing rebels.  The French confirmed that a Chadian National 
Army (ANT) column crossed into Sudan May 13 in the vicinity 
 
NDJAMENA 00000177  002 OF 002 
 
 
of the Chadian town Koukou Angarana and the Sudanese town of 
Babil in pursuit of Chad rebels.  The column went about 20 
kms into Sudan and made some contact with rebels, but there 
was no fighting.  The rebels fled deeper into Sudan, and the 
ANT column returned back into Chad early May 14.  This 
incident, at least, is finished. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
DEVELOPING PICTURE OF REBEL ATROCITIES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  French doctors told us that they had treated ANT 
troops injured in the fighting and that one of the ANT troops 
had had his eyes gouged out.  Other reports say that rebels 
killed anyone on any means of transport -- car, bicycle, 
motorcycle, horse, etc. -- during their advance into Chad to 
prevent witnesses from raising alarms.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Deby continues to stir up anti-Sudanese sentiment 
and denounce lack of action on the part of regional players 
in response to last week's rebel incursion.  Given Deby's and 
Chad's close relationship with and dependence on neighbors, 
most of the President's comments are rhetorical and perhaps 
designed to try to burnish Chad's image in the eyes of the 
international community and set the stage for envoys he 
intends to dispatch to other African capitals for a more 
heart-felt retelling of this chapter in Chad's recent 
history.  END COMMENT.
