¶1. (SBU) BOCOG officials reported at a July 23 press conference that 
the Beijing Public Security Bureau has designated specific areas to 
be used for demonstrations, complaints and protests during the 
Olympic Games.  Protesters will need to apply and receive approval 
in advance to hold demonstrations at the designated locations, as 
required under Chinese law, BOCOG Security Director Liu Shaowu told 
journalists.  Liu said that the protest zones would be located in 
World Park (Fengtai District), Zizhuyuan Park (Haidian District), 
and Ritan Park (Chaoyang District).  The specific locations were 
deleted from the transcript released after the press conference. 
Liu said he was not prepared to offer details on specific 
application procedures but added that relevant government agencies 
would provide this information separately.  Ritan Park is very close 
to U.S. Embassy facilities and the Ambassador's Residence. 
 
¶2. (U) Chinese news website www.sohu.com carried a Xinhua News 
Service article July 23 that noted that during the 1995 UN Women's 
Conference in Beijing, the city government set up similar protest 
zones.   However, those zones were in Huairou town, more than 40 
miles from Beijing.
