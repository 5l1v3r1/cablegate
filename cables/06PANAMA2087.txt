SUBJECT: PANAMA RESPECTS U.S. POSITION BUT CAN'T COMMENT ON 
OAS DECLARATION 
 
REF: STATE 176810 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Panama cannot comment on Mexico's proposed OAS 
declaration on U.S. border security because it has not yet 
seen the text, MFA Sub-Director for Exterior Politics 
Vladimir Franco told Poloff October 24.  However, Franco 
stated that Panama understood and respected the sovereign 
right of countries, including the United States, to control 
the security of their borders.  Franco added that Panama 
supported the right of the United States to construct a 
border wall as long as it remained on U.S. territory, saying 
that Panama took the same position on the Israeli separation 
barrier. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Overall, Panama supports "legal, secure, and 
orderly" international migration as well as integrated 
reforms to U.S. and other countries' immigration policies, 
said Franco.  He agreed to relay the U.S. position to 
Panama's OAS delegation but emphasized that Panama cannot 
take a position on the proposed declaration until it has seen 
the text.
