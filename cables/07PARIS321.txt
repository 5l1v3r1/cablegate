¶1.  Summary:  Ref A calls for posts to supply the names of 
influential women to be included in a roster of women leaders 
worldwide.  We at the U.S. Mission believe that UNESCO can act as an 
effective multiplier on global issues, including those involving 
women's empowerment.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  At present, there are approximately 37 female ambassadors 
accredited to UNESCO.  A recently published book "Sixty years of 
Women at UNESCO" describes the important contribution that female 
ambassadors and secretariat members have made to the organization. 
Many of the women currently serving as ambassadors to UNESCO have 
played prominent roles in their home countries.  For example, the 
Ambassador of Spain to UNESCO, Maria Jesus San Segundo, is a former 
minister of Education and Science. 
 
¶3.  The Ambassador of Mauritius -- herself a former Minister for 
Women, Family Welfare, and Child Development -- recently invited 
Ambassador Oliver to help establish a "Group/Network of Women 
Ambassadors for UNESCO."  The goal is to assist UNESCO to "enhance 
its actions in the field of gender equality and women's 
empowerment."  This group, which will remain an informal caucus for 
now, met in December for a second time to discuss specific 
priorities.  Participants included Australia, Uganda, Ethiopia, 
Egypt, Kenya, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Ivory Coast, 
Lithuania, and Spain.  Many present voiced support for programs 
promoting peace education for women, with many noting that women 
have a special role to play in educating the younger generation. 
Guatemala observed that peace education is a building block for 
democracy. The group of female UNESCO ambassadors now plan a launch 
event in conjunction with the UNESCO March 8 (International Women's 
Day) roundtable on "Women as Peacemakers." 
 
¶5.  On January 25, Ambassador Oliver organized a dinner at her 
residence attended by women ambassadors from Spain, Mauritius, South 
Africa, Sri Lanka, Poland, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Morocco, 
Lebanon, and Gabon.   The dinner -- which lasted five hours, fueled 
by the group's enthusiasm  -- focused on means of working as an 
informal caucus to promote goals including peace education. 
Participants evoked a variety of potential projects.  South Africa 
proposed that the ambassadors provide support for a girl's school in 
Liberia; the Liberian President was guest of honor at UNESCO's 2005 
event marking International Women's Day.  Another idea was to 
establish an "Ambassadors' Prize" to be awarded to winners of an 
annual essay competition for girl students.  The Ambassadors all 
expressed the readiness to serve as role models for girls and young 
women.  In their efforts, the UNESCO secretariat would play an 
important support role, the Ambassadors agreed. 
 
¶6.  This theme of "Women as Peacemakers" could perhaps be expanded 
to include democracy building and counter-terrorism education, key 
transformational democracy themes, key priorities of this Mission 
(Ref B).  If the State Department organizes "follow-on strategy 
sessions for Women's empowerment with government and civil society" 
on this or other issues, it should consider engaging UNESCO.  Not 
only might the U.S. Mission help in recruiting appropriate 
participants for events, but the UNESCO secretariat might be able to 
provide expertise and networking assistance. 
 
¶7.  UNESCO has experience in several areas relating to women's 
empowerment.  First Lady Laura Bush is a UNESCO Honorary Ambassador 
for Literacy, supporting educational programs including those that 
promote women and girls' education.  UNESCO has also launched 
several programs to enhance the role of women in science, as well as 
in media and communications.  And, with an eye to popular appeal, 
UNESCO is concluding an agreement with the WTA to encourage women as 
leaders in sport.  Three tennis players, including Venus Williams, 
will promote gender equality.
