SUBJECT: RABAT'S COUNTERTERRORISM ACTION GROUP MEETS IN 
PREPARATION FOR KYOTO MEETING 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On October 16, the Japanese DCM convened the only 
G-8 Counterterrorism Action Group (CTAG) meeting during 
Japan's presidency.  Representatives of Canada, Germany, 
Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States participated, as did representatives of the European 
Union, Spain and Switzerland.  France was conspicuous by its 
unexplained absence.  The Japanese DCM explained that the 
meeting was scheduled to lay the groundwork for a November 6 
CTAG meeting in Kyoto. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During the discussion of each country's 
counterterrorism efforts in Morocco, the DCM described U.S. 
Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA), EXBS, Coast Guard, Customs, 
border control, bio-security, dual-use, export control and 
anti-money laundering programs in Morocco and for Moroccans. 
The German Police Attache described police training and 
training on Internet crimes; the Canadian DCM talked about 
anti-money laundering and chem.-bio training.  The EU DCM 
also described anti-money laundering training and upcoming 
training for magistrates on UN anti-terrorism conventions. 
The Spanish Police Attache discussed police and border 
control training.  The British representative described the 
UK's focus on aviation and maritime security, including 
training to counter MANPADS.  He also discussed explosive 
detection training.  The representatives of Italy, Japan, 
Russia, and Switzerland noted that they do not currently have 
any counterterrorism cooperation with Morocco.  The British 
suggested that we create a password-protected website to 
share information on training and equipment donations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Participants agreed that the Moroccan security 
forces have sufficient counterterrorism capacity in general. 
However, we also agreed that the Al Qaeda in the Lands of the 
Islamic Maghreb is becoming more organized, and the danger of 
terrorism in Morocco remains high, as evidenced by the arrest 
of almost 100 suspected terrorists thus far in 2008.
