¶1. On Thursday, December 8, post received a letter from the 
Costa Rican Foreign Ministry regarding the December 7 
shooting death of Costa Rica-born Rigoberto Alpizar in Miami 
International Airport.  Alpizar reportedly is a dual U.S. and 
Costa Rican national. 
 
¶2. Translated text of the letter follows.  Begin text: 
 
San Jose, December 8, 2005 
DVM 219-05 
 
Excellency, 
 
I have the honor to address Your Excellency to refer to the 
death of a Costa Rican citizen, Rigoberto Alpizar-Medina, who 
passed away yesterday in Miami, Florida, as a consequence of 
an action by the security staff assigned to the city's 
international airport. 
 
This event has caused grief to the Costa Rican public; on 
behalf of the Government of the Republic, I request, 
Excellency, official information on the circumstances of the 
tragedy.  Likewise, the Government of Costa Rica expects that 
the proper procedures will take place to establish what 
happened and to assign responsibilities. 
 
I thank you for Your Excellency's attention to this note, and 
avail myself of this opportunity to renew the assurances of 
my distinguished consideration and esteem.

¶3. The shooting featured prominently in all local media, 
including front-page coverage in four of the five national 
daily newspapers.  Costa Rican press has been objective in 
its coverage of the shooting, so far sticking to reported 
facts and interviews with family members resident in southern 
Costa Rica.  Post will continue to monitor local media for 
editorial and/or critical commentary on the event. 
 
¶4. Late Thursday morning, President Abel Pacheco, a 
psychiatrist by training, was quoted on the Web site of the 
leading daily newspaper, La Nacion, as saying he would seek 
an investigation into Alpizar's death.  He is quoted as 
saying that Alpizar's death could be attributed to 
"collective paranoia" in the United States.
