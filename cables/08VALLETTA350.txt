WITHDRAWAL FROM GORI 
 
REF: SECSTATE 87098 
 
¶1. (SBU) On the afternoon of August 13, Ambassador Bordonaro 
raised reftel points with Maltese FM Tonio Borg, urging Malta 
to engage the Russian government about continued reports of 
Russian military activity around Gori, and to urge Russia to 
investigate and end any possible ongoing atrocities in South 
Ossetia and Gori, and to allow international inspections of, 
and assistance to, both areas. 
 
¶2. (SBU) FM Borg said he fully concurred with the message, 
particularly the need to end any atrocities and allow 
immediate access.  Noting that EU FM's would meet in two 
weeks' time in Avignon, he said he had already heard that 
Georgia would be the top agenda item.  When the Ambassador 
asked whether FM Borg planned to press the Russian Ambassador 
to Malta on these points he was non-commital but generally 
positive, reiterating the importance of the matter to Malta 
and to the E.U.
