SUBJECT: CAIRO-BASED ARAB DARFUR REBEL GROUP SENDS LETTER 
TO PRESIDENT BUSH 
 
 
Sensitive but unclassified, please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Democratic Popular Front (DPF), a 
mostly Arab Darfur group with representation in Cairo, 
recently gave an Arabic-language letter to pol LES for 
delivery to President Bush, requesting U.S. support for the 
DPF to fulfill its "responsibilities" in the coming phase of 
the peace process in Darfur.  The letter proposes building a 
"strategic relationship" between the DPF and the U.S. 
Specifically, the DPF requests financial support, opening a 
DPF media bureau in Washington to "direct public opinion," 
U.S.-based professional training for DPF members, "military 
support," and infrastructure and humanitarian assistance in 
Darfur.  Complete translated text of the letter is in 
paragraph 3.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 20, Pol LES met Cairo-based DPF President 
Siddique Ander and DPF Secretary General Osama Mohamed El 
Hassan to discuss Sudanese refugees and expatriates in Egypt. 
 Ander and El Hassan claim the DPF represents the interests 
of "Arab tribes" in Darfur (nfi), and passed pol LES a letter 
for President Bush during an August 20 meeting.  (Note: The 
DPF is part of the United Revolutionary Forces Front, an 
umbrella group purporting to represent the interests of 
marginalized Arabs in Darfur.  End note.)  We have little 
other information on this group in addition to an August 13 
Reuters story, which reported that the Democratic Popular 
Front Army kidnapped 12 Sudanese soldiers in Darfur in an 
attempt to force the Sudanese government to cease using 
militias to counter Darfur rebels, and which quoted El Hassan. 
 
¶3. (U) Begin text of translated letter to President Bush: 
 
To His Highness President George Bush 
President of the United States of America 
Through His Excellency the Ambassador of the United States of 
America 
 
Greetings 
 
The Democratic Popular Front appreciates your efforts to 
establish security and peace in Darfur.  The great people of 
Sudan in general, and the people of Darfur in particular, 
will not forget your positions in support of humanity, the 
weak, and those demanding freedom and dignity. 
 
Complementary to your great efforts and to prepare us to bear 
the responsibility in the coming phase, we would like to 
propose to Your Highness some demands for which we hope we 
find some appreciation and response. 
 
First: Build a strategic relationship based on cooperation, 
respect, and shared economic, political, and social interests. 
 
Second: Financial support to facilitate work and improve 
performance. 
 
Third: Media support represented by opening a Democratic 
Popular Front bureau in Washington and a local radio station 
and satellite channel that can direct public opinion. 
 
Fourth: Qualifying our cadres to increase their ability to 
negotiate, and open opportunities for professional training, 
university education, and post-graduate studies for our 
members in your country supportive of human development. 
 
Fifth: Military support represented by a number of equipped 
ambulances, qualifying and training military cadres in 
different specializations, and a number of 2 (sic) 
helicopters. 
 
Sixth: Establishing roads connecting Darfur with Central 
Africa, Chad, Libya, and South Sudan. 
 
Seventh: Implementing a program for development, based on 
constructing villages, digging drinking water wells, and
