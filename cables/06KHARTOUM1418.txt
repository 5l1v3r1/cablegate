SUBJECT:  LITTLE PROGRESS WITH REMAINING OTHER ARMED 
GROUPS IN SOUTH SUDAN 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  GoSS Minister of Parliamentary 
Affairs Gabriel Changeson reported that there has been 
little progress in dealing with the remaining other armed 
groups (OAGs) in Southern Sudan, with no definitive 
breakthrough to date.  Two of three warlords have visited 
Juba, and Vice President Machar spoke with a third in 
Khartoum.  Southerners in the Khartoum Government of 
National Unity (GoNU) reportedly have sought to stop 
further rapprochement between the GoSS/SPLM and the OAGs. 
End summary.

GoSS Coaxing OAGS to Join the Fold

¶2.  (SBU) Gabriel Changeson, a Nuer with close ties to 
former SSDF and current Deputy SPLA Commander Paolino 
Matiep, told CG that the GoSS continues to try to 
convince remaining OAGs to comply with the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement (CPA).  There has been some progress; 
Changeson said that he had met with Colonel Gordon Kong 
of Pangjak in Juba, as did Machar.  Kong was chosen 
fairly by the people of Pangjak as their commissioner, 
Changeson said.  Also, Changeson told Major General 
Gabriel Tong Chan that while it is not GoSS policy that 
all militias must affiliate with the SPLM, it was 
important that Tong sever his ties with the Sudanese 
Armed Forces (SAF) and Khartoum.  Tong has not yet 
revealed his intentions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Changeson was dismissive of Gordon Kong, who he 
said was afraid to leave Khartoum and return to his 
former base in Nasir.  Machar also met with Kong in 
Khartoum during the first week of June, but had not 
succeeded in convincing Machar's former ally to make his 
peace with the GoSS.  Changeson said that this would be a 
desirable outcome, but Kong's lack of popular support did 
not make this imperative.

Changeson Warns Murle Not to be Integrated into SAF

¶4.  (SBU) Changeson said that Ishmael Konyi and his Pibor 
(Murle) militia posed a greater threat.  Konyi had 
visited Juba, but had not agreed to sever his ties to the 
North and had recently said he would affiliate with the 
SAF rather than the SPLA.  Changeson said that this was 
acceptable, but Konyi had refused to honor the CPA 
provision that required his militia to withdraw from the 
South with the SAF as it withdrew.  Changeson said that 
he had warned Konyi that Khartoum would never integrate 
his Murle forces into the SAF - he was useful only as a 
disruptive proxy force operating in the South, with 
Khartoum able to deny that it was responsible.

¶5.  (SBU) Changeson said that two Southerners in the GoNU 
had done their utmost to prevent the remaining OAGs from 
coming to terms with the GoSS.  Dr. Riek Gai, the 
Political Advisor for President Bashir, and Brigadier 
Gatluak Deng, Minister of Animal Resources and Fisheries, 
remained the most significant impediments to resolving 
the OAG problem.
