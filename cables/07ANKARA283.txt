SUBJECT:  Cases of H5N1 Avian Influenza Confirmed in Poultry in 
Batman 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary. In a press release, the Ministry of Agriculture 
(MARA) confirmed that 170 birds died of Avian Influenza (AI) on a 
small farm in the village of Bogazkoy in the province of Batman.  On 
Feb. 9, MARA confirmed that the birds were indeed infected with the 
H5N1 strain of AI.  All precautionary measures have been taken. 
Four children with flu-like symptoms from that province are being 
examined and samples are also being sent to Ankara for testing. 
End summary.

Avian Influenza Cases in Poultry Confirmed 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) On February 8, MARA announced that 170 poultry had died of AI 
since February 5 in the village of Bogazkoy in Batman province. 
Samples were sent to Ankara's Etlik laboratory to determine the AI 
strain.  On Feb. 9, MARA confirmed that the birds were indeed 
infected with the H5N1 strain of AI.  These are the first cases of 
AI in poultry since March 31, 2006.  Since that time, through 
monitoring and continual surveillance, MARA had collected 700 
samples of suspicious AI cases, which all tested negative. 
 
¶3. (U) MARA immediately began implementing the National Emergency 
Action Plan for AI.  As part of this plan, MARA's General 
Directorate for Protection and Control (GDPC) established a National 
Disease Control Center at its headquarters in Ankara and also a 
regional control center in Batman. These centers serve to coordinate 
all activities related to this particular incident. 
 
¶4. (U) In accordance with standard response measures, a 3 kilometer 
quarantine zone and 7 km. radius active surveillance zone have been 
established. On Feb. 9, MARA confirmed that all 790 birds in the 3 
km quarantine zone had been culled and that all disinfection 
procedures had been completed.  MARA reported that there was no 
evidence that birds had died of AI in the two other villages 
(Ruzgarli and Aydinli) within the 3 km quarantine area.  Authorities 
have banned all movement and selling of live avian products in 
Batman until further notice. In addition, since it is suspected that 
this outbreak was caused by migratory birds, measures are being 
taken to control the area around Kirkat Lake in the region.  MARA is 
carefully monitoring this area for other signs of the disease. Ag 
Minister Eker is on his way to Batman to assess the situation and 
show the government's support for the villagers affected by the 
outbreak. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The GOT, with assistance from international organizations, 
such as USAID, WHO, FAO and UNICEF, started a intensive public 
awareness campaign in the Fall of 2006 to educate those living in 
rural areas about AI symptoms, safe poultry handling and 
precautionary measures.  As a result, the farmers in Batman reacted 
very quickly and properly during this outbreak. 
 
--------------------- 
Human Cases Suspected 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed that four children 
from Batman who had been playing with birds were admitted to a local 
hospital with flu-like symptoms.  After close examination, it was 
determined that three of the children simply had human influenza and 
were released from the hospital and sent back to Bogazkoy village 
today.  However, the fourth child (2 yrs old) was sent to a hospital 
in another province (Diyarbakir) for further testing since he was 
diagnosed with pneumonia.  Although these children do not/not seem 
to have AI, samples of all four children were sent to Ankara for 
testing.  Results are expected to be announced in a press conference 
this evening.  The MOH sent a group to conduct further research and 
take surveillance measures in all of the villages in Batman and some 
in Mardin. In addition, the MOH has sent tamiflu to the Provincial 
Health Directorates of Batman and other provinces in the region for 
precautionary measures.

¶7. (U) US Embassy offered assistance to both MARA and MOH in this 
case.  They thanked us for the offer and said that at this time 
there is no need but they will consider our offer and if the need 
arises, they will notify us. 
 
¶8. (U) USDA has funded participation for Turkish veterinarians in 
two AI-related training courses since September 2006 and is 
currently exploring other opportunities to provide training to 
Turkish vets and poultry experts both in Turkey and abroad.  In 
September 2006, two vets attended the Poultry Improvement Plan 
conference in Portland, Oregan, and this week, veterinarians from 
the Elazig, Samsun, and Istanbul State labs are participating in an 
HPAI diagnostics course in Ames, Iowa. 
 
¶9. (S) USDA plans to nominate and fund participation for a high 
level Turkish government vet in the OIE and FAO sponsored AI 
vaccination meeting to be held in Italy in March 2007.  FAS Ankara 
hopes to be able to send more Turkish vet and poultry experts to a 
USDA-sponsored epidemiology course in May in Vienna, Austria.  If 
successful, USDA is considering offering a two-week long follow-up 
lab training in Ankara for about 25 Turkish and Azeri participants 
sometime this summer.  The Turkish and Azeri Ag Ministries have 
expressed interest in such training.
