(SBU) On November 19, the Ambassador pressed Mourad 
Belhassan, Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry's Americas 
Desk, on the Embassy's outstanding request for a meeting with 
the Ministry of Justice's Coordinator General, Rida 
Khemakhem, whom the Justice Minister had previously named as 
a point of contact on TIP (ref c).  Belhassan reiterated the 
GOT's view that Tunisia's placement on the Tier II Watchlist 
was not in line with realities in the country, but accepted 
the Ambassador's argument that regularizing our bilateral 
dialogue on TIP was key to reconciling our different 
perspectives on trafficking in Tunisia.  The Embassy will 
continue to press for this and other opportunities for 
substantive engagement with the GOT on TIP.
