------------------------------------------ 
President Asad's Meeting with U.S. Senator Arlen Specter 
------------------------------------------ 
The Syrian Arab News Agency reported that during Senator Arlen 
Specter's 12/30 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad 
Tuesday, the President stressed the importance of halting "the 
Israeli massacres which are being committed against the unarmed 
Palestinian people, lifting the unjust siege on them, and opening 
all crossings permanently." 
------------------------------------------ 
Foreign Minister Mouallem Receives phone calls from his European 
Counterparts 
------------------------------------------ 
All papers reported that Foreign Minister Mouallem received phone 
calls from the French, Norwegian and Spanish foreign ministers. 
Their calls focused on the dangerous developments in Gaza and the 
need for Arab and international efforts to pressure Israel to halt 
its "aggression" immediately, as well as the need to reach a 
humanitarian truce to allow medical relief and food aid to enter 
Gaza through all crossings. 
------------------------------------------ 
Turkish Foreign Minister Erdogan to Begin Tour of the Region to 
discuss Gaza 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Papers on December 30 reported that Turkish FM Erdogan will begin a 
tour of Syria, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia in connection with 
the Israeli air attacks against the Gaza Strip.  Turkish PM Erdogan 
will meet President Asad today to discuss developments in Gaza. 
All papers reported Turkish President Gul's statement that Turkey's 
first priority is to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and extend 
humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people.  Gul also warned against 
the danger of the conflict's expansion beyond Gaza, which would 
jeopardize the whole region. 
------------- 
Arab Summit: 
------------- 
Al-Watan on December 30 quoted informed diplomatic sources as saying 
that so far only ten Arab countries have committed to attend the 
Arab summit, and that it is not yet clear whether enough countries 
will commit to attend. 
------------------------------------------ 
Damascus-Based Palestinian Factions Reject 
Abbas' Call for Meeting on Gaza 
------------------------------------------ 
Al-Watan reported on December 30 that Damascus-based Palestinian 
factions categorically rejected Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' 
call for a meeting on Gaza. 
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command 
[PFLP-GC] described Abbas's call as confused and "too late." 
Palestinian Islamic Jihad rejected the call, calling it 
"promotional." 
In a telephone interview with Al-Watan, PFLP-GC media officer Anwar 
Raja said Abbas's call is "unacceptable." Raja stated that any 
meeting "must have a very clear agenda within natural and positive 
climates." He said Abbas is trying to "seize the opportunity to mend 
his image and make some nominal gains." 
While HAMAS made no official statement on its position toward the 
proposed meeting, Raja stressed that the Islamic movement "is moving 
in the same direction" and rejects Abbas' call. 
Raja strongly criticized Abbas for holding the resistance 
responsible for the "holocaust" in Gaza. This, he said, "provided 
excuses for the Zionist killing machine." He added: "Through his 
participation in the siege, pressure, and political incitement 
against the resistance in general and HAMAS in particular, Abbas is 
involved in the Gaza massacre."

Selected Headlines:

"President Asad discusses developments in the region with U.S. Arlen 
Specter.  President Asad reiterates the importance of halting 
Israeli massacres against the Palestinian people and removing unjust 
siege and opening all crossings" (Government-owned Tishreen, 
December 31) 
 
"An Egyptian source: A meeting between Mahmoud Abbas' officials and 
Israeli officers to discuss 'horizons for hitting Gaza'" 
(Independent al-Watan, December 31) 
 
"Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic countries will 
hold an exceptional meeting on Gaza in Jeddah on Saturday" 
(Government-owned Al-Thawra, December 31)

Selected Editorial: 
------------------- 
 
"Rafah: the Arabs' Agony" 
Samira Masalmeh, Chief Editor of government-owned daily Tishreen, 
commented on Dec. 30: "In an attempt to divide the (Arab) nation and 
its countries, some are tendentiously talking about a campaign 
against Egypt...Egypt can do what no other Arab country can do to 
pressure Israel, such as break off diplomatic relations, recall its 
ambassador, sever economic and trade relations, or take all these 
measures together and open the crossings..." 
"This is a turning point in the history of the Palestinian cause. It 
is extremely dangerous, as some are pushing things to the stage of 
final defeat. It is perhaps right to say now that no harm to the 
Palestinian cause is worse than this harm, which reaches the point 
of conspiracy and betrayal of the resistance if Arab silence remains 
the dominant factor."
