SUBJECT: DIPLOMATIC NOTE DELIVERED TO RUSSIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTRY ON HOTLINE CONSOLIDATION AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 60234 
 
¶1.  We delivered reftel diplomatic note to Aleksandr Zakharov 
in the Foreign Ministry's North America Department May 11. 
We restated the US position and requested a formal response 
from the GOR to our December 2006 diplomatic note.  We will 
also raise the issue separately with the Presidential 
Communications Directorate (PCD). 
 
¶2.  Zakharov explained that the GOR would like to conclude 
the draft agreement as quickly as possible, but recently 
enacted legislation on the "Protection of Government Secrets" 
required inclusion in all such bilateral agreements of a 
provision outlining procedures for protection of classified 
information.  Zakharov said the Federal Security Service 
(FSB), as the legislation's designated executive agency, was 
insistent that the hotline agreement could not go forward 
without the provision.  The PCD did not think the provision 
was necessary for implementation but was unable to bypass the 
law or the FSB.  He noted that both France and the UK had 
signed similar agreements with Russia, which would make it 
difficult to grant an exception to the US.  Zakharov 
promised, however, that he would raise the issue with legal 
experts in the Ministry to determine whether a creative 
solution could be found before the next round of bilateral 
talks.  He added that an agreement, once concluded, would 
have to be ratified, which might take considerable time in 
the current electoral environment.
