REF: KHARTOUM 103 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Despite a number of pleas to local and international 
audiences by the Popular Congress Party (PCP), the organization's 
leader, Hassan al-Turabi, remains imprisoned by the Sudanese regime. 
 Formerly a leading member of the Sudanese regime that came to power 
in 1989, Turabi's arrest allegedly resulted from his comments 
supporting the ICC process against President Bashir and for is 
alleged plans to meet with members of the JEM rebel movement in 
London (reftel). END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On February 24, the PCP-run "Rai al-Shaab" newspaper 
published a story quoting PCP Assistant Secretary General Ibrahim 
al-Sanousi as having said that the NCP delivered "contradictory 
statements" in claiming that Turabi was both arrested "for his own 
protection" and also that his detention was "because of his support 
of the rebel Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Meanwhile, Turabi's son, Siddiq, told PolOff on February 24 
that his family is still permitted only one 15-minute visit per week 
at the prison in Port Sudan.  According to Siddiq al-Turabi, 
Sudanese authorities have not yet charged the elder Turabi with 
anything, nor have they filed an extension of detention as is 
required by Sudanese law for all national security detentions 
lasting more than 30 days.  Turabi's son accused the GOS of 
continuing to interfere with PCP members, noting that two buses of 
Turabi supporters were intercepted by National Intelligence and 
Security Service (NISS) officers when the former attempted to visit 
Port Sudan prison on February 17.  En route from Kassala in eastern 
Sudan, the buses were forced to return, with two party members 
detained and questioned for several hours.  Siddiq al-Turabi said 
the party remains concerned that more members will be targeted by 
the GOS following the February 15 arrest of PCP Deputy Secretary 
General Kamal Omer. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The family of Kamal Omer told PolOff on February 24 that 
they believe Omer's arrest was likewise politically-motivated. 
Arrested after writing an article deemed "sensitive," the prominent 
legal advocate was sentenced to six months in prison, a decision 
that  surprised his family, as authorities generally follow the 
standard practice of fining violators for such offenses  rather than 
imprisoning them.  The family did note optimistically that they 
currently have regular open visits with Omer, who is appealing the 
verdict in Khartoum. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: It is ironic that at a time when the Government of 
Sudan and the Justice and Equality (JEM)  Doha Memorandum of Good 
Will calls for the release of armed conflict prisoners from both 
sides, the PCP opposition party's Turabi and Omer remain jailed for 
having made public statements.  While pro-Islamist forces inside and 
outside of Sudan will likely ensure Turabi's eventual release, the 
timing for the NCP to do so may become tricky as a consequence of 
the pending ICC arrest warrant against President Bashir.  Given 
Turabi's statements in support of the ICC process, the regime may 
become more intransigent on releasing Turabi if an arrest warrant 
for President Bashir is issued by the ICC next week.
