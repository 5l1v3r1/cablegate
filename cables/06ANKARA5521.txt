National Security Council Convenes 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶1. Turkey's National Security Council (NSC) held its bi-monthly 
meeting on August 21.  National security issue and the fight against 
terrorism topped the agenda of the meeting.  Recent developments in 
the Middle East, humanitarian assistance to Lebanon and Palestine, 
Turkey's policy on Black Sea security and regional developments were 
among the other issues discussed. 
 
Turkish Defense Undersecretariat Re-Structuring 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. Established in 1985 to develop modern defense industrial 
infrastructure in Turkey, Turkish Defense Undersecretariat (SSM) 
restructured its organization.  Six additional heads of departments 
were added: Research & Development and Technology Management, 
Quality-Test Certification, International Cooperation, Naval 
Platforms, Electronic Warfare and Sensors, and Rocket-Missile and 
Ammunition.  All of these positions were filled by employees 
promoted from within the organization. SSM will also hire a number 
of new personnel by the end of the year.  According to one 
government contact, further personnel assignments at the level of 
chief of section and heads of department are expected by the end of 
the year. 
 
Turkey's Security Relations with Other Countries 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. Afghanistan: Turkish Defense Minister met with his Afghan 
counterpart Gen Abdurrahim Wardak during his official visit to Kabul 
on August 6.  During his visit, Gonul said Turkey will continue its 
assistance program to support rebuilding the country and developing 
the national army, as reported by Peshawar-based Afghan Islamic 
Press (AIP).  This visit was not reported by Turkish media. 
 
The ISAF Kabul Regional Command Center started operations under 
tripartite command of Turkey-France-Italy on August 6.  As part of 
its participation in this command, Turkey will increase its troop 
contribution in Afghanistan to the level of battalion, according to 
the semi-official Anatolian News Agency (ANA). 
 
¶3. Bosnia-Herzegovina: Turkey signed a military cooperation 
agreement with Bosnia on August 14.  The agreement was signed in 
Sarajevo by Turkish Military Attach Col Osman Aksakal and Bosnian 
Deputy Defense Minister Enes Becirbasic.  The agreement covers 
cooperation in the fields of training, technology and science 
including the exchange of personnel, material, equipment, 
information and experience, as reported by the Bosnian Independent 
News Agency. 
 
Defense Industry Activity 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. Turkey is planning to buy a new squadron of F-16 fighter jets 
worth at least $ 1.5 billion as a stop-gap solution until 
new-generation fighter aircraft join its Air Force in the next 
decade.  Air Force Chief General Faruk Comert said on August 30 that 
Turkey was planning to purchase 30 F-16s by 2011.  Turkish military 
officials expect final agreement on the purchase before the end of 
this year if all technical and financial talks with Lockheed Martin 
go smoothly, according to the Turkish Daily News. 
 
¶5. Procurement officials are to finalize the multibillion dollar 
ATAK helicopter tender this year.  Four companies submitted bids 
(South Africa's Denel, Italy's Augusta Westland, German/French 
consortium Eurocopter, and Russia's Kamov) in the tender which was 
issued in February 2005, following the cancellation of an initial 
 
ANKARA 00005521  002 OF 002 
 
 
tender in the mid 1990s which had been awarded to Bell-Textron. 
Denel and Agusta Westland were named as the two finalists in this 
second tender.   According to a defense analyst, it is possible that 
the military, under new Chief of the General Staff GEN Yasar 
Buyukanit (former Chief of the Turkish Land Forces) who took office 
on August 30, may push for a review as none of the two remaining 
options fully satisfies the command from operational and technical 
viewpoints (Ankara Turkish Daily News).  However, according to a 
government contact announcement of a new tender with revised terms 
of condition cannot take place before general elections of 2007 in 
Turkey. 
 
. Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul said on August 9 that Turkey 
reached an agreement with the US for purchasing 50 Slam-ER missiles 
(Standoff Land Attack Missiles-Expanded Response) for $ 139 million 
from the US through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.
