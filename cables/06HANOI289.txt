¶1. (SBU) During a meeting February 10, Charge delivered 
reftel points to Assistant Foreign Minister and Americas 
Department Director General Nguyen Duc Hung.  Hung had no 
substantive response, but promised to report our points to 
his leadership. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  We will follow-up with the MFA, but if 
past conversations on the subject are a guide, we will 
likely hear that Vietnam supports the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy and a diplomatic resolution of the matter at 
hand.
