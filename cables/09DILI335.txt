Dear Ambassador, 
 
 
 
I refer to your letter dated 2 December 2009 and thank you for 
providing information on the President of the United States of 
America's decision on the way forward in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan. 
 
 
 
The Government of Timor-Leste supports the engagement of the 
United States of America, and the broad coalition of a further 
43 nations, in fighting al Qaeda and restoring peace and 
security in Afghanistan.  Timor-Leste understands well the 
terrible costs of war.  After the abhorrent attacks on the 
United States of America on September 11, 2001, however, it was 
clear that the resort to force was necessary in Afghanistan. 
 
 
 
The Government of Timor-Leste gives its full support to 
President Obama's strategy on the way forward in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan.  We hope, and we trust, that this strategy, including 
the commitment of additional military personnel, will hasten the 
achievement of peace in that region.  And we encourage the 
United States of America, consistent with this strategy, to 
ensure that the full responsibility for security and governance 
is transferred to the people of Afghanistan at the earliest 
opportunity. 
 
 
 
Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration. 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao 
 
Prime Minister
