"US's Historical Mistake" 
 
Former Brazilian Ambassador to the US, Rubens Barbosa, commented in 
center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo (2/13): 
"The invasion of Iraq has been perhaps the biggest US foreign policy 
mistake since the Vietnam War.... The current US administration has 
a particular view of the conflict.... There is no doubt that the end 
of the war in Iraq depends on the withdrawal of US occupation 
troops.... Despite all the pre-election rhetoric, the US is expected 
to remain in Iraq for the next five or ten years.  The US can 
neither lose the war nor leave the Middle East. As a result of that, 
depending on Washington's foreign policy initiatives, the threat of 
terrorist actions in the US will hardly be reduced and the other 
serious problems in the region will become much more difficult to 
handle.... If such a picture is confirmed over the next two years, 
the price of oil will continue unstable, thereby increasing the 
vulnerability of medium and small economies, and global instability 
and insecurity will persist as a result of the Islamic population's 
reaction. Terrorism, which has its base of action in Afghanistan and 
now Iraq, will increase its threat to the international community. 
Washington's support to Israel in the conflict with the Palestinians 
and the US military presence in the Middle East are the main causes 
of the low prospective of peace and political stability in the 
region.... Even a possible US Democratic administration will hardly 
be able to promote a military withdrawal in Iraq without a profound 
transformation of the international scenario in the region."
