IRAN ELECTIONS EU ISSUES - EU SUMMIT 
PARIS - MONDAY, JUNE 20, 2005 
 
 
A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY'S REPORT: 
 
¶1. SECRETARY RICE TO MIDDLE EAST 
¶2. IRAN ELECTIONS 
¶3. EU ISSUES - EU SUMMIT 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
THE RISING PRICE OF OIL AND THE FAILED EUROPEAN SUMMIT ARE TWO 
OF TODAY'S MAJOR FRONT-PAGE STORIES. FOR LEFT-OF-CENTER LE 
MONDE "THE EU-25 `FREEZE' THE EU CONSTITUTION;" LIBERATION 
HEADLINES "THE EU KO STANDING;" AND LA CROIX "THE EUROPEANS IN 
SEARCH OF A SECOND WIND." COMMENTARIES ABOUND ON THE FAILED EU 
BUDGET AND COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, WITH LE MONDE WRITING 
ABOUT "TWO FAILURES" WHICH ARE TURNING INTO "BLAIR'S TWO 
VICTORIES." (SEE PART C) IN A COMMENTARY IN LE FIGARO THE 
BLAIR-CHIRAC ANIMOSITY IS ANALYZED, EVEN IF COMMENTATOR 
PHILIPPE GOUILLAUD WRITES: "BLAIR DID NOT MANAGE TO SPLIT THE 
CHIRAC-SHROEDER TANDEM. AND JUNKER MADE VERY HARSH REMARKS 
AGAINST BLAIR. NOW THAT THE PERSONAL RELATIONS BETWEEN BLAIR 
AND CHIRAC HAVE REACHED A GLACIAL ERA, BLAIR WILL BENEFIT FROM 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S AID AT THE NEXT G8 SUMMIT FROM JULY 6 TO 8." 
LE FIGARO CARRIES AN OP-ED BY BENITA FERRERO-WALDNER, EUROPEAN 
COMMISSIONER IN CHARGE OF FOREIGN RELATIONS, ON EUROPE'S 
POLITICAL ROLE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE. (SEE PART C) 
 
A POLL FOR LE JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE SHOWS THAT PRESIDENT CHIRAC 
CONTINUES TO FALL IN POPULARITY, WITH ONLY 28 OF RESPONDENTS 
SUPPORTING HIS POLICIES. THE COMMENTARY READS: "THE BAROMETER 
SHOWS THE OPPOSITE OF A POLL OF FEELINGS TRIGGERED BY A 
SPECIFIC EVENT OR ANNOUNCEMENT. IT REFLECTS A DEEPLY GROUNDED 
POPULAR TREND." 
 
LE JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE ALSO CARRIES A REPORT ALLEGING THAT 
FRENCH HOSTAGE FLORENCE AUBENAS WAS LIBERATED FROM IRAQI 
CAPTORS FOLLLOWING PAYMENT OF A 15 MILLION DOLLAR RANSOM. THE 
PAPER'S INFORMATION IS ALLEGEDLY CORROBORATED BY ROBERT 
MENARD, PRESIDENT OF JOURNALISTS WITHOUT BORDERS." GILLES 
DELAFON REPORTS THAT THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES HAVE DENIED PAYING 
A RANSOM, "BUT WERE NOT CONVINCING." 
 
IN INTERNATIONAL NEWS SECRETARY RICE'S VISIT TO THE MIDDLE 
EAST IS FACTUALLY REPORTED WITH LIGHT COMMENTARY, WHILE THE 
ELECTIONS IN IRAN ARE WIDELY COMMENTED. (SEE PART C) 
 
WITH THE PARIS AIR SHOW HAVING CLOSED ITS DOORS ON SUNDAY, THE 
LATEST FIGURES INDICATE THAT AIRBUS IS IN THE LEAD WITH 280 
REGISTERED ORDERS 146 FOR BOEING. A RELATED ARTICLE IN LE 
FIGARO ECONOMIE REPORTS: "THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY IS WORRIED 
ABOUT AN `ANTI-AIRBUS' TREND IN AMERICAN POLITICAL CIRCLES. 
MANY ARE THOSE WHO FEEL THAT THE ANTI-AIRBUS AMENDMENT WILL 
KEEP AIRBUS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE PENTAGON'S BID FOR 
TANKER AIRCRAFT. THE FEELING IN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC 
IS GENERALLY ANTI-EUROPEAN AND EVEN ANTI-FRENCH. BUT THE `ANTI- 
AIRBUS' BILL WILL BE FACING SENATOR MCCAIN WHO IS EAGER TO 
CHANGE HOW BOEING DOES THINGS. IN HIS VIEW, THE AMERICAN 
AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURER MUST STOP FUNCTIONING IN A POSITION OF 
MONOPOLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO TANKER AIRCRAFT. MCCAIN 
IS TEMPTED TO USE AIRBUS TO SHAKE BOEING AND FORCE IT TO LOWER 
ITS PRICES." 
 
LE FIGARO REPORTS A PARIS "COLLABORATIVE" MEETING BETWEEN U.S. 
AND FRENCH JUDICIAL REPRESENTATIVES ON THE HALLIBURTON 
CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION. THE PRESENCE IN PARIS LAST WEEK OF 
"A HIGH U.S. OFFICIAL," MARK MENDELSON, IS NOTED. 
 
A POLL CONDUCTED SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE U.S. AND FRANCE FOR LE 
MONDE SHOWS THAT "THE FRENCH AND THE AMERICANS HARBOR NEGATIVE 
VIEWS OF ONE ANOTHER. PUBLIC OPINION ON BOTH SIDES APPEARS TO 
BE LESS INCLINED TO DO AWAY WITH THE ACRIMONY THAT HAS 
DOMINATED THE FRANCO-AMERICAN DIALOGUE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. 
OBVIOUSLY WHAT IS TRUE OF DIPLOMACY IS NOT TRUE FOR PUBLIC 
OPINION." 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
SECRETARY RICE TO MIDDLE EAST 
 
SIPDIS 
 
"A JARRING NOTE" 
PATRICK SAINT-PAUL IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (06/20): "THE 
ISRAELI PRESS PRESENTED SECRETARY RICE'S VISIT AS A 
`MAINTENANCE VISIT,' WITH THE SECRETARY TRAVELING TO ENCOURAGE 
BOTH SIDES. BUT SECRETARY RICE WAS TREATED TO A DISPIRITING 
DIGEST OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST BE OVERCOME." 
 
"EGYPT, AN ESSENTIAL REGIONAL ALLY" 
CLAUDE GUIBAL IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (06/20): "WHILE IN 
CAIRO, SECRETARY RICE WILL ENCOURAGE DEMOCRATIZATION AS SHE 
RAISES HER VOICE AGAINST REPRESSION. SHE WILL CONGRATULATE 
WITH ONE HAND, ALL THE WHILE USING THE STICK WITH THE OTHER. 
THESE PAST FEW MONTHS, RELATIONS BETWEEN EGYPT AND THE U.S. 
HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY CHAOTIC. A CRISIS THAT CULMINATED IN THE 
CANCELLATION OF SECRETARY RICE'S TRIP IN MARCH. JUST AS 
WASHINGTON EXPRESSED ITS DESIRE TO MAKE EGYPT A MODEL OF ITS 
POLICY OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT WASHINGTON 
CANNOT AFFORD TO BE TOO CRITICAL OF EGYPT, WHICH IS PLAYING A 
ROLE IN THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATIONS. AND SO THE U.S. 
MUST ALL AT ONCE STAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF CAIRO EVEN AS IT 
RAISES ITS VOICE. A DOUBLE LANGUAGE THAT HAS ELICITED MUCH 
CRITICISM." 
 
IRAN ELECTIONS 
 
"IRAN'S CALL" 
PIERRE ROUSSELIN IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (06/18): "THE 
IRANIANS ARE PROVING THEY HAVE LOST NONE OF THEIR ASPIRATIONS 
FOR CHANGE. THE ELECTIONS IN IRAN DO NOT CORRESPONDENT TO THE 
IDEA WE IN THE WEST HAVE OF A DEMOCRACY. PRESIDENT BUSH DID 
NOT FAIL TO RECALL THIS FACT SO THAT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF 
IRAN IS NOT TAKEN AS THE MODEL OF DEMOCRATIZATION HE WANTS FOR 
THE `GREATER MIDDLE EAST.' BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT MANY OF 
AMERICA'S ALLIES IN THE REGION, STARTING WITH PAKISTAN, COULD 
WELL FIND THEIR INSPIRATION IN IRAN'S ELECTION. THIS DOES NOT 
MEAN THAT IRAN'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARE USELESS. EVEN IF 
THE REFORMISTS ARE NO LONGER IN THE LEAD, THEY HAVE MADE THEIR 
MESSAGE HEARD AND THE REGIME, HOWEVER MUCH THEOCRATIC, WILL 
HAVE TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT. IRANIANS HAVE FEW ILLUSIONS. 
POLITICAL FREEDOM WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. ASPIRATIONS FOR 
CHANGE CONCERN ESSENTIALLY THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND A DESIRE 
TO LOOK TO THE WEST. THE FAVORITE, RAFSANDJANI, WHO HAS 
CAMPAIGNED IN FAVOR OF A RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE U.S., HAS 
NOTHING OF A REFORMIST. WHOEVER IT IS THAT SUCCEEDS KHATAMI, 
THE WEST WILL HAVE TO ANSWER IRAN'S CALL, ALL THE WHILE 
KEEPING FROM CONSOLIDATING THE MULLAH'S REGIME." 
 
"BUSH'S ROLE" 
GEORGES MALBRUNOT IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (06/20): "THE 
ATTACKS PRESIDENT BUSH MADE ON THE EVE OF THE IRANIAN 
ELECTIONS AGAINST `A DEMOCRACY OF FAADE' MAY HAVE INCITED 
SOME TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS." 
 
EU ISSUES - EU SUMMIT 
 
"EUROPE, A PLAYER WITH A WORLDWIDE DIMENSION" 
BENITA FERRER-WALDNER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER IN CHARGE OF 
FOREIGN RELATIONS IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (06/20): 
"TODAY'S EU-U.S. SUMMIT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THAT 
WHATEVER OUR INTERNAL DIFFERENCES, WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS 
SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE. THE SUMMIT'S AGENDA ALREADY PROVES 
THAT EUROPE IS FULLY ABLE TO HOLD ITS RANK ALONGSIDE THE U.S. 
THIS WEEK, THE EU AND THE U.S. WILL JOINTLY ORGANIZE AN 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IRAQ. THIS IS THE RESULT NOT OF A 
NEW TREATY BUT OF A RESOLUTE POLITICAL WILL. THE BRUSSELS 
CONFERENCE WILL PROVIDE THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT WITH THE SUPPORT 
IT NEEDS TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES IT IS FACING. AS PART OF 
THE QUARTET, WE ARE HELPING THE ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS TO 
RESOLVE THEIR CONFLICT. OUR BIGGEST SUCCESS IN MATTERS OF 
FOREIGN POLICY IS PROBABLY WHAT THE EU EXPANSION HAS BROUGHT 
THE WORLD IN TERMS OF PEACE AND SECURITY ON THE EUROPEAN 
CONTINENT. IN THE EYES OF THE U.S., THIS PROBABLY REPRESENTS 
OUR MOST MARKED IMPACT ON INTERNATIONAL STABILITY AND 
PROSPERITY. TODAY WE ARE LAUNCHING A NEW TRANSATLANTIC 
INITIATIVE FOR ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND GROWTH, MEANT TO 
STRENGTHEN TRADE AND INVESTMENT BETWEEN THE EU AND THE U.S. . 
OUR FOREIGN POLICY AROUND THE WORLD PROMOTES PEACE, PROSPERITY 
AND SECURITY. IN ALL SECTORS WE WORK HAND IN HAND WITH OUR 
AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVING OUR SHARED OBJECTIVES." 
 
"BLAIR TAKES THE UPPER HAND" 
LEFT-OF-CENTER LE MONDE IN ITS EDITORIAL (06/20): "THE DOUBLE 
FAILURE OF BRUSSELS, NEGOTIATING THE BRITISH `REBATE' AND THE 
COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, HAS RESULTED IN A DOUBLE VICTORY 
FOR BLAIR. HELPED BY HIS RECENT RE-ELECTION AND THE WEAKENED 
FRANCO-GERMAN COUPLE, BLAIR WAS ABLE TO IMPOSE HIS VIEWS. WITH 
TWO WEEKS TO GO BEFORE HE TAKES OVER AS PRESIDENT OF THE EU, 
BLAIR HAS TAKEN THE UPPER HAND. THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
REJECTS THE NOTION THAT HIS INTENTION IS TO ERODE EUROPE'S 
SOCIAL MODEL, BUT THE FACT IS THAT HIS PROGRAM IS NOTHING MORE 
THAN A LIBERAL PROGRAM. EUROPE IS STALLED." WOLFF
