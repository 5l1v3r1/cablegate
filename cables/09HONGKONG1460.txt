¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for 
Internet Distribution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Hong Kong Trade and Industry Department (HK TID) 
Deputy Director General Vivian Lau told Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) Secure Freight Initiative Director 
Rich DiNucci on July 23 that Hong Kong remains committed to 
cooperation with the United States on trade security and 
export controls.  She stressed that the successful completion 
of the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) pilot program at 
Modern Terminal should not be interpreted as Hong Kong's 
backing away from its partnership with the U.S. on these and 
other issues.  Lau said she had seen a recent statement by 
DHS Secretary Napolitano that incorrectly asserted that Hong 
Kong had withdrawn from the SFI program.  DiNucci assured her 
that the U.S. shares her regard for our partnership with Hong 
Kong and looks forward to continued cooperation on issues of 
mutual concern.  He promised to speak to Secretary 
Napolitano's staff to clarify any misunderstandings. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) DiNucci outlined DHS plans to focus SFI 
implementation efforts first on strategic ports.  He noted 
that the requirements of the SAFE Ports Act for 100 percent 
scanning of U.S. bound cargo currently appear unlikely to be 
amended, but acknowledged that it will not be possible to 
meet the 2012 implementation target.  DHS has learned much 
from its implementation efforts in Southampton, Salalah, Hong 
Kong and other SFI venues and will continue to work to ensure 
that the SFI program not only increases security, but also 
facilitates trade. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Lau noted that the SFI operation in Karachi, 
Pakistan appeared to have real trade facilitation benefits 
for shipments originating there, but that in a safe, high 
volume port like Hong Kong, the trade facilitation benefits 
are less clear.  Of the more than 20,000 containers scanned 
in the SFI pilot program in Hong Kong, less than one percent 
triggered an alarm and all of these were able to be resolved 
without finding any radioactive materials or weapons 
components.  Yet the containers scanned in Hong Kong were 
inspected at roughly the same rate in U.S. ports as unscanned 
containers.  DiNucci agreed, and added that DHS would welcome 
input from shippers about how SFI affected their operations 
in Hong Kong and how it could be improved to provide 
additional benefits to them. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) SFI Director DiNucci has seen and cleared this 
message.
