SUBJECT: 59TH UNGA: TURKEY LOOKING FOR WEOG CONSENSUS ON 
"NEW AGENDA" RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 220896 
 
Deputy PolMilCouns shared reftel points with MFA Arms Control 
and Disarmament Affairs Department Chief Bulent Meric on 
October 19 and urged Turkey to oppose the UNGA draft "New 
Agenda" resolution when it comes to a vote.  Meric said that, 
while Turkey had abstained from voting on the 2003 resolution 
because it was not balanced, this year's resolution had been 
significantly improved.  The GOT welcomed the shorter length 
and supports both the underlying principle of the resolution 
- a total ban on nuclear weapons - and the substance.  Bulent 
noted that the GOT attaches importance to early universality 
of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and to 
resumption of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-Off 
Treaty.  However, the GOT supports solidarity within the 
Western and Other Group (WEOG).  For that reason, while 
Turkey could support the resolution, the GOT is watching the 
WEOG deliberations and is prepared to support a consensus 
position.
