--  The Embassy switchboard number is (39) 06-4674-1, 
and is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 
-- Nextell world cell phones generally work in Italy, 
but post recommends checking with the provider prior 
to departure.  In Italy, callers must dial 00 plus country 
code (1 for the U.S.) to make international calls.  The 
country code for Italy is 39. 
 
-- Calling within Italy:  To call from one city to the 
next, dial the city code (06 for Rome; 02 for Milan) plus the 
number. 
To dial any cell number in Italy, dial the number without 
the city code. 
 
-- Money exchange:  The unit of currency throughout Italy 
is the Euro.  Dollars or travelers checks can be legally 
exchanged for Euros at local exchange offices, hotels and 
the airport.  Most major credit cards are accepted throughout 
Italy.  ATM machines will accept many U.S. bank cards. 
 
¶5.  Security/Threat Assessment 
 
Due to many factors, including the ongoing global war on 
terrorism, American diplomatic facilities in Italy operate 
under a state of heightened security. 
 
The Department of State remains concerned about the 
continued threat of terrorist attacks, demonstrations 
and other violent actions against U.S. citizens and 
interests overseas. 
 
The July 2005 bombings in London have resulted in 
additional attention to security.  Travelers should 
continue to monitor public announcements regarding 
worldwide caution.  There have been several high-profile 
arrests in Italy of alleged terrorists with links to 
Al-Qaeda.  Several groups including the Red Brigades, 
who flourished in Italy during the late seventies and 
early eighties, and later the Autonomists, have 
claimed responsibility for violent crimes in the past. 
Members are mostly radical students and disruptive youths. 
 
Workers' strikes can also affect transportation, and are 
sometimes called with as little as 24 hours notice. 
These strikes often result in the cancellation of 
local airline flights, and disruptions in local train, 
bus and metro operations.  The U.S. Embassy advises 
citizens traveling or residing in Italy to avoid areas 
in which crowds are expected to gather, take common sense 
precautions, and follow news reports carefully.  Italy 
continues to be under heightened public threat by al-Qaida 
and other Isalmic extremists for its continued participation 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, which may increase the potential 
for terrorist activity. 
 
We monitor the security environment closely and issue 
updated assessments, as warranted.  Travelers should 
maintain a low profile; stay alert for unusual activity, 
for example surveillance; and avoid repetitious patterns 
and habits, i.e., vary routes and times of departures and 
arrivals.  Visitors to U.S. diplomatic and military 
facilities should be aware that increased security 
measures are in effect at these locations.  While there 
is presently no information available that indicates 
targeting of a specific individual, all visitors and 
resident USG personnel are encouraged to maintain a 
heightened state of security awareness.  Unusual or 
 
suspicious incidents should be reported immediately 
to the RSO. 
 
Street crime occurs frequently, especially in large cities 
and at tourist locations.  Visitors are warned to safeguard 
their valuables at all times, especially while walking 
along streets and when using public transportation. 
Extra care should be taken while in crowded tourist areas. 
Pickpockets usually work in teams and target tourists. 
Traveling on the Autostrada throughout Italy can be 
hazardous.  Rest stops are often hangouts for thieves. 
 
For the latest security information, U.S. citizens 
traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Department 
of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs internet web site at 
http://www.travel.state.gov.  The "Worldwide Caution" 
Public Announcement, dated October 11, 2006, is 
available on that web site.  The Consular Information 
Sheet provides additional general information on safety 
and security in italy. 
 
In addition to information on the Internet, travelers 
may obtain up-todate information on security conditions 
by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the U.S. or 
outside the U.S, on a regular toll line at 1-202-510-4444.
