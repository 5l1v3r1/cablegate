SUBJECT: MARCH 22 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: SIX-PARTY TALKS, 
BANCO DELTA ASIA, OLYMPICS BOYCOTT OVER DARFUR, JAPAN 
 
 
¶1. Key points made at the March 22 MFA press conference were: 
 
-- The Six-Party Talks continued with bilateral meetings 
despite reports that DPRK VFM Kim Kye-Gwan was at the airport 
ready to depart Beijing. 
 
-- The Talks have run into "unexpected" technical and 
procedural problems regarding the transfer of funds in 
resolving the Banco Delta Asia issue. 
 
-- The Spokesman refuted questions about the feasibility of 
meeting deadlines from the February 13 Initial Action 
Agreement, stating that there was no reason to lose 
confidence. 
 
-- French groups that have proposed a boycott of the 2008 
Olympics over Darfur do not understand China's position on 
the issue. 
 
-- Premier Wen's upcoming visit to Japan will be 
"ice-thawing" in that it will help China and Japan push 
forward cooperation, even though some difficult issues 
linger. 
 
6PT: Talks Continue Despite Reports About DPRK 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  MFA Spokesman Liu Jianchao announced at the opening of 
the March 22 regular press briefing that the Six-Party Talks 
are continuing with bilateral meetings involving all six 
parties, despite media reports that DPRK lead negotiator Kim 
Kye-Gwan had been seen at the airport ready to depart Beijing. 
 
¶3.  The spokesman said the Six-Party Talks have run into 
"unexpected" technical and procedural problems regarding the 
transfer of funds in resolving the Banco Delta Asia issue. 
However, Liu said consensus has been reached between the DPRK 
and United States from a political perspective, adding that 
the resolve of all parties on commitments made in the Joint 
Statement and February 13 agreement remains unchanged. 
Further, he refused to place blame for the hold-up on any 
party, maintaining that all sides must consider some 
reasonable concerns of all other parties.  Asked if China 
would handle the BDA issue outside the framework of China's 
new anti-money laundering law in the interests of pushing 
forward the Talks, Liu said the solution must be in 
accordance with law and reasonable to all parties. 
 
¶4.  Liu deflected questions on the feasibility of meeting 
deadlines determined in the February 13 agreement, stating 
there was no reason to lose confidence and that all goals are 
expected to be met sooner or later.  All parties should 
continue their positive, joint efforts and honor commitments 
made in the February 13 document.  Asked if China would 
handle the BDA issue outside the framework of China's new 
anti-money laundering law in the interests of pushing forward 
the Talks, Liu said the solution must be in accordance with 
law and reasonable to all parties. 
 
¶5.  Progress has been made at this round of Talks, Liu said, 
noting that the first of three unspecified items that VFM Wu 
Dawei outlined at the opening of this round of Talks has been 
"finished."  There has been an initial exchange of views on 
the other two items and parties are treating these sensitive 
issues seriously, even though the items have yet to be 
discussed in depth. 
 
French Athletes to Boycott Olympics, Protest Darfur 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶6.  Asked about recent reports that French athletes preparing 
for the 2008 Olympics may boycott the games to protest 
China's inaction on Darfur, Liu said China welcomes all 
nations to participate in the Olympics and believes the 
French parties do not have a clear understanding of China's 
position on Darfur.  All parties concerned should work 
through dialogue and consultation to solve the Darfur issue 
while maintaining Sudan's sovereignty and territorial 
integrity.  China is playing a constructive role in the 
issue, including the Four-Point Proposal President Hu 
outlined after talks with President al-Bashir.  China hopes 
Sudan will actively discuss the Darfur issue, Liu said. 
 
Premier Wen's "Ice-thawing" Visit to Japan 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  China attaches great importance to PM Wen's upcoming 
visit to Japan and sees bilateral relations developing in a 
positive direction, said Liu.  An increase in Chinese news

reports about Japan is normal and unrelated to a change in 
government policy, Liu responded when asked about the recent 
trend by a Japanese reporter.  Liu characterized PM Abe's 
recent visit to China as "ice-breaking" and Wen's planned 
visit as "ice-thawing."  Despite some lingering issues, both 
sides must push forward cooperation in all areas to promote 
the long-term stable development of bilateral relations.
