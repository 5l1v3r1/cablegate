Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "There is no doubt that Blair did not leave 
10 Downing Street and his place in the front row of world leaders 
only to take care of repairing Ramallah's sewage system ... The man 
who has repeatedly declared that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is 
the source of the problems between Islam and the West, and that this 
dispute can only be solved if a suitable mediator is found, will try 
his luck at concocting an agreement." 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: "It is 
pointless for the Arab states to continue to wait for the 
Palestinians to lead.  It is the Arab states that led the 
Palestinians into war, before Israel's establishment and since, and 
it is the Arab states that must lead them to peace."

Â¶I. "Blair the Rock Star" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (07/27): "Blair's visit left no doubt about it 
-- an international rock star is now dealing with the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  None of the previous 
personalities or emissaries enjoyed a similar standing, or the 
prestige and political savoir faire that Blair has brought with him 
to the position.... The major question that accompanied Blair's 
meetings with Israel's top political echelon concerned his 
intentions. Will he stick to the limited mandate he has been given 
by the Quartet ... or will he be pushed into genuine mediation 
between Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the leaders pf the 
Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas and Salem Fayad, on the way to 
a final status solution -- and perhaps also Nobel Peace Prize?.... 
There is no doubt that Blair did not leave 10 Downing Street and his 
place in the front row of world leaders only to take care of 
repairing Ramallah's sewage system ... The man who has repeatedly 
declared that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the source of the 
problems between Islam and the West, and that this dispute can only 
be solved if a suitable mediator is found, will try his luck at 
concocting an agreement." 
 
II. "Arabs Must Lead" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (07/27): 
"With the important exceptions of the Egyptian and Jordanian peace 
treaties, and Mauritania's recognition of the Jewish state, the Arab 
states have been unwilling to lead the Palestinians towards peace 
with Israel.  That example is obviously no longer enough.  The 
Palestinians are weaker and more radicalized than ever.... It is 
pointless for the Arab states to continue to wait for the 
Palestinians to lead.  It is the Arab states that led the 
Palestinians into war, before Israel's establishment and since, and 
it is the Arab states that must lead them to peace.... The West 
should be pushing all the Arab states, not just Egypt and Jordan, to 
begin normalizing relations with Israel and to abandon positions 
inconsistent with Israel's right to exist.  It should go without 
saying that the West itself should be unabashedly rejecting such 
positions as well."
