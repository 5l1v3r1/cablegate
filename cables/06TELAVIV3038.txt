SUBJECT: ICRC: BATTLE OPERATIONS LIMITING ACCESS TO 
CIVILIANS 
 
 
(SBU) ICRC Head of Delegation Dominik Stillhart and Deputy 
Head of Delegation Paul Conneally told the Political and 
Economic Counselors August 3 that the mechanism for 
deconflicting ICRC convoys and IDF attacks in Lebanon is 
functioning satisfactorily in those areas where combat is not 
intense.  Stillhart said that the IDF has expeditiously 
approved ICRC requests for access to areas where the level of 
combat allows any degree of modification to deconflict 
humanitarian operations.  Stillhart asserted, however, that 
extensive fighting across a broad swath of southern Lebanon 
currently prevents ICRC from accessing the civilian 
populations that most require -- and have required for three 
weeks -- emergency assistance.  Absent a cease-fire or major 
reduction in battle operations, Conneally added, ICRC will 
not be able to provide adequate relief to thousands of 
Lebanese civilians who have remained in conflict zones.
