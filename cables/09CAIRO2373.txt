MOHAMED DABBUR - CASE NO.2677 
 
REF: STATE 99497 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Pol Off met with 
registered broker Mohamed Dabbur. He confirmed that he was 
authorized by the Egyptian Ministry of Defense to conduct 
brokering activities in Egypt.  Dabbur operates out of a 
one-man office without any partners or employees.  He 
provides consulting services only for sensitive items, so he 
does not physically handle or store any items on the United 
States Munitions List on behalf of his clients.  He started 
his private consulting business in 2007.  Dabbur is a retired 
Egyptian Air Force officer, who spent 34 years in the 
military.  Dabbur confirmed that he was familiar with 
restrictions on USML items, including the unauthorized 
re-transfer and re-export of items. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Dabbur said his sole business is to provide 
consulting services for the American company Pratt and 
Whitney and their program to supply engines and parts for the 
Egyptian Air Force's F-16 program, which is financed by 
Foreign Military Financing.
