Â¶1. (SBU)  PolOff delivered Reftel demarche talking points to 
MFA Deputy International Organizations and Commissions 
Director Nubia Lezcano on August 2, stressing the U.S. desire 
for Panama's continued support in creating a new UN Human 
Rights Council.  PolOff emphasized the need for an 
action-oriented council that can help improve human rights 
situations on the ground.  PolOff reiterated the U.S. desire 
to have a small number of members on the council enabling it 
to operate quickly and with more efficiency.  Lezcano said 
she would discuss the matter with MFA Human Rights Director 
Janio Tunion when he returns from his vacation on August 15. 
Embassy will report any further developments to the 
Department.
