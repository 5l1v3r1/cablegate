¶1. PolOff delivered reftel talking points including elements 
of a USG-supported action plan to combat TIP, to Carlos 
Jativa, the Minister of Government Raul Baca's assistant, on 
September 16.  In a follow-up meeting with PolOff on 
September 20, Baca and Jativa concurred with the Tier 2 Watch 
List action plan requirements.  PolOff informed the Minister 
that the Embassy is required to provide the Department a 
report of Ecuador's actions by November 15. 
 
¶2. Baca described his Ministry's proposal to open new 
shelters for TIP victims in Guayaquil and Quito and requested 
USG financial support.  (The proposal was faxed to WHA/PPC on 
September 22.)  He said he will also solicit support from 
other international donors, including UNICEF.  Baca told the 
PolOff he was working with Congress to ensure 
anti-Trafficking in Persons (TIP) legislation is passed; 
President of Congress Landazuria assured him TIP legislation 
would be among Congress' priorities.  The Ministry is also 
working with the police to develop an online method of 
reporting crimes of child pornography. 
 
¶3. On September 21, PolOff delivered refel talking points to 
Denys Toscano in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   Toscano 
said the MFA would strive to provide input on GOE progress on 
items in the action plan before November 15.  He is concerned 
the Ministry of Government's anti-TIP legislation is too 
narrow and that it does not make sufficient reference to the 
Palermo Convention and international protocols.  We are 
reviewing the legislation to ensure it meets international 
standards.
