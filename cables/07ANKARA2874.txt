SUBJECT: TURKEY: POSITIVE REACTIONS TO DECEMBER 1 
CROSS-BORDER ARTILLERY STRIKE 
 
REF: ANKARA 2867 
 
¶1. (U)  Summary:  There has been no subsequent military 
action following artillery strikes against PKK positions in 
northern Iraq on December 1.  However, senior GOT officials 
have publicly reaffirmed Turkey's readiness to make 
additional hits on PKK bases across the border and have said 
it is now up to the military leadership to decide on the 
timing and scope of future operations.  Local media credit 
the U.S. role in providing the intelligence for the attack. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) President Gul told reporters December 2 that the 
military had been granted a mandate to conduct operations 
against the PKK, and that it would exercise its mandate when 
it deems necessary.  In a December 2 TV interview, Government 
Spokesman and Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek emphasized 
the same point and stated that the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) would decide on the timing and scope of future 
operations according to need.  He stated that there is very 
careful planning to ensure that any actions taken across the 
border would be "free from error." 
 
¶3. (U) Several dailies credit the Turkish Army's "heavy blow" 
to PKK terrorists to the intelligence supplied by the U.S. 
The December 3 "Radikal" states that the U.S. had extended 
support to the Turkish operation and quotes the Pentagon 
spokesman's statement that "Turkey has the right to defend 
itself."   It also underscores a quote from NSC spokesperson 
Gordon Johndroe in Washington that, "close cooperation 
between the U.S. and Turkey will continue." The December 3 
"Hurriyet" notes that Saturday's strike was the first result 
of the new cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey in the 
fight against terror.
