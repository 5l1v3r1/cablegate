SUBJECT: Sudan's GNU Extends GMO Waiver for Six Months 
 
 
¶1.  Background:  Sudan's Government of National Unity 
(GNU) requires certification that U.S. food assistance to 
Sudan does not contain genetically modified organisms 
(GMO).  The primary food commodities affected by this 
requirement are U.S. donations of wheat and corn-soy 
blend (CSB).  Though U.S. wheat is not genetically 
modified and U.S. CSB poses no threat to local 
agriculture, the GNU regularly blocks onward movement of 
food commodities through Port Sudan pending semi-annual 
 
 
 
verification of compliance with its GMO certification 
policy.  As of April 26, 2006, bureaucratic delays in 
obtaining official signature approving the renewal of the 
U.S. food commodity GMO certification waiver had stalled 
the shipment of 45,000 MT of food assistance through Port 
Sudan and an additional 6,000 MT through El Obeid. 
 
¶3.  On April 27, 2006, the GNU Ministry of Humanitarian 
Affairs sent an official letter to the USAID mission in 
Khartoum informing the USG that the Council of Ministers 
had issued a decree granting a six-month waiver for USAID 
to import GMO food commodities into Sudan for 
humanitarian purposes.  Receipt of this letter should 
authorize immediate movement of U.S. food assistance from 
Port Sudan and El Obeid to Darfur. 
 
¶4.  Sudan's Council of Ministers issued Decree Number 136 
on April 27, 2006.  By signing the document, Sudanese 
President Omar Hassan El-Bashir called for the Ministries 
of Cabinet Affairs, Finance and National Economy, Foreign 
Affairs, Science and Technology, and Humanitarian Affairs 
to act on the basis of the decree. USAID shared a copy of 
the letter outlining the decree with the U. N. World Food 
Program (WFP).
