Â¶1.  (SBU) Acting EconPol Counselor met on June 15 with Silvia 
Maca, Head of the Ministry of Finance's Export Financing and 
Promotion Department to deliver reftel points.  Maca 
acknowledged that the Kontrollbank, Austria's export credit 
agency, remained open for issuing new commitments to the 
Government of Iran.  However, Maca stressed that any 
potential credits would be strictly on a commercial basis. 
Maca added that the Kontrollbank was now reviewing "very 
carefully" all requests from Austrian businesses for new 
export or financing guarantees to do business in Iran.  The 
political risk of doing business in Iran had, in the 
Kontrollbank's calculations, increased significantly.
