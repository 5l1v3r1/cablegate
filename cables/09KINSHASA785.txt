¶1.   (U) Ambassador Garvelink was received August 25 by Foreign 
Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba in the context of an appointment the 
ambassador had requested to discuss a broad range of issues.  Also 
present were diplomatic advisor Clementine Shakembo and Americas 
director Louis Lokosu Nkulufa.  Ambassador was accompanied by DCM. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador noted that a person of interest to the GDRC 
(Bout), someone who had broken Congolese law, was being held by Thai 
authorities pending resolution of an extradition request from the 
U.S.  The U.S. wanted him extradited where he would be duly tried 
for his crimes.  Ambassador asked Thambwe if the GDRC could help by 
approaching the Thai government in support of the U.S. extradition 
request. 
¶3.  (SBU) Thambwe expressed interest in doing this, noting that the 
DRC would also like to see Bout behind bars.  He asked his staff if 
the RTG has an ambassador accredited to the GRDC.  Their response 
was negative, although the RTG may have asked to have its ambassador 
in Nairobi accredited here. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The foreign minister then turned to his staffers and asked 
that they request a meeting for him with the Thai foreign minister 
during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting in New 
York, where Thambwe Mwamba will head the Congolese delegation.
