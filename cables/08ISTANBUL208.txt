SUBJECT: MAY DAY 2008: POLICE DISPERSE DEMONSTRATORS, 
PREVENT ON MARCH ON TAKSIM

¶1. (U) The Istanbul police were out force to prevent 
pro-labor demonstrators from marching to Taksim Square for an 
unauthorized May Day rally.  Union supporters originally 
intended to defy Istanbul Governor Guler's ban on the march 
(ref A), yet turned back after clashing with police. 
Suleyman Celebi, Chairman of the Confederation of 
Revolutionary Workers' Union (DISK), called off the march 
citing "common sense" as his reason. 
 
¶2. (U) City authorities were better prepared for this year's 
May Day demonstrations, seeking to avoid the violence and 
massive traffic disruptions that caught many off guard one 
year ago (ref B).  Thousands of police were positioned around 
Taksim Square, blocking all roads into the historic square. 
Police quickly reacted to the unsanctioned march, using water 
cannon and tear gas to disperse the crowd.  By mid-afternoon 
505 people had been arrested and 6 police officers had been 
injured. 
 
¶3. (U)  In addition to the attempted march on Taksim, tens of 
thousands of labor supporters demonstrated at three 
authorized locations in Istanbul. Relatively peaceful rallies 
occurred in areas in the Zeytinburnu, Kadikoy, and Caglayan 
districts where rallies and marches are typically held. Guler 
also reportedly agreed to permit labor union leaders to lay a 
wreath at Taksim square.  Due to conflicts between labor 
leaders and police at the scene the wreath laying did not 
take place. 
 
¶4. (U) Tensions over the May Day rally this year were high in 
part due to the recent passage of a Social Security reform 
law (ref C) that will reduce some worker benefits including 
significantly raising the retirement age.  A sharp exchange 
between union leaders and government officials, including the 
Prime Minister, also served to raise expectations of a 
confrontation. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Comment.  May Day 2008 was not a repeat of the 
violent, chaotic events of 2007 as many had feared.  Better 
planning and greater outreach on the part of municipal 
transit and police authorities enabled local residents to 
work around illegal protests -- that although disruptive, 
were not out of the realm of the expected by Turkish 
standards.  End Comment.
