Title- "The Power of Drugs in Mexico" 
 
Main Editorial in center-right Estado de S. Paulo (3-29) states: 
"....The country [Mexico] is going through its most severe crisis 
since the 1910 Revolution.  Organized crime and corruption have 
reached amazing levels...At the other side of the border, official 
documents and at least one high-level military official warned that 
Mexico, the 12th largest economy in the world, may represent a risk 
to U.S. national security.....Seemingly aware of [Merida] initiative 
limitations, Obama has anticipated that if 'measures adopted are not 
sufficient, then we will do more.  The amount to be spent his year 
is equivalent to the U.S. annual expenditures, between 2006 and 
2008, for Colombia Plan......the plan had more success against 
terrorism than against drugs....'
