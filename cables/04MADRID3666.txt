other large cities in Spain attract a number of 
criminals and pickpockets and frequent incidents of 
crimes of opportunity against the unwary occur.  Carry 
only essential items, including a photocopy of your 
passport.  Visitors can protect themselves from crime 
by being street-smart, alert, and aware of their 
surroundings.  In the event you are victimized by 
crime, or experience any other security-related 
incident, please contact the Embassy's Regional 
Security Office at (91) 587-2550.  Additional 
information regarding safety and security in Spain is 
available on the U.S. Department of State's website 
(http://www.state.gov). 
 
¶8.  Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent 
Worldwide Caution issued by the Department of State. 
As the Department of State continues to develop 
information on any potential security threats to 
Americans overseas, it shares credible threat 
information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information 
on the Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded 
information by calling the Department of State in 
Washington, D.C. at 202-647-5225 from their touch-tone 
telephone, or receive information by automated telefax
