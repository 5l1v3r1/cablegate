START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
The cooperative work Bertolotti performs with US Embassy Paris 
officers and our counterparts in Washington is vital to our 
ability to achieve key USG objectives as set out in Embassy 
Paris' Mission Performance Plan (MPP).  Bertolotti is the 
French government point of contact on key issues relating to 
nonproliferation generally and specifically to our bilateral 
and multilateral efforts at stopping the spread of missile 
technology and materials to nations of concern, such as Iran, 
North Korea and Syria.   He is most often the French MFA 
representative to whom Embassy officers present demarches 
concerning illegal transfers of controlled technology and 
parts destined for use in the ballistic weapons programs of 
states involved in potentially dangerous proliferation 
activities, and his active cooperation in these matters is an 
important factor in our ability to successfully stop these 
transfers.  Bertolotti also plays a crucial role in our 
efforts at enhancing the activities of the multilateral 
missile control group MTCR, Australia Group (AG), and Nuclear 
Suppliers Group (NSG). 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Based on U.S. Embassy recommendations, suggestions from the IV 
nominee, and in coordination with our counterparts in 
Washington, we propose the following general program for 
Bertolotti: 
--Meetings with the Director and Deputy Director of the 
Department of State's Office of Chemical, Biological, and 
Missile Nonproliferation (NP) 
--Meetings with Department of Defense (OSD/ISP/NPP) experts in 
the field of nonproliferation 
--Meetings/tour at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency 
(NIMA) 
--Meetings/tour at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) 
--Meetings with National Security Council (ProStrat) 
nonproliferation experts 
--Meetings at the Department of Energy (NNSA) 
-- Meetings at the Department of Commerce (BIS/NCTC) 
--Meetings at the Central Intelligence Agency (WINPAC) 
--Meetings with key Non-governmental Organizations/Think-tanks 
in the field of strategic studies such as the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies, the Monterey Institute, 
Carnegie Foundation, University of Georgia Export Controls 
Center, etc. 
--Per candidate's special request, a visit to a local 
government office in Washington D.C. or one of the surrounding 
cities/towns to see first hand how local communities operate 
in terms of urban planning, policing, and general 
administration.  Bertolotti worked on some of these issues 
while at ENA, and noted that "decentralization" is a very 
topical issue in France, and of great interest to him as a 
civil servant.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Bertolotti is in many ways a perfect candidate for the 
International Visitors program.  He is a product of the 
prestigious French National School of Public Administration 
(ENA), and before joining the French Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA), worked in the Ministry of Defense's Office of 
Strategic Affairs.  In his current capacity as the Deputy 
Director of the MFA's Directorate of Disarmament and 
Nonproliferation, he has the critical responsibility of 
serving as the chief coordinator and point of contact for the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), a Paris-based 
multilateral group of like-minded countries dedicated to the 
control of missile technologies.  The work of the MTCR is of 
extremely high-interest to U.S. policymakers from a wide-range 
of government agencies and departments.  Bertolotti has proven 
a highly articulate (in both French and English), competent, 
and responsive interlocutor on MTCR issues and on bilateral 
nonproliferation matters of great concern to the U.S. 
government.  While Bertolotti has traveled to the U.S. on 
personal visits to friends and family (he has an aunt and 
uncle living in New Jersey), he has not had the opportunity to 
make a professional visit to the U.S.  The nominating officer 
believes that Bertolotti would benefit greatly from his 
participation in the IV program, returning from it a more 
knowledgeable, well-rounded diplomat, with a deeper 
understanding and appreciation of U.S. foreign policy. 
Bertolotti is only twenty-seven years old, and is just 
beginning his career in the French MFA.  Despite his age, 
Bertolotti has already been given a position that carries with 
it considerable responsibility on issues of great import to 
the French government, and will likely continue to serve in 
positions that will keep him involved in sensitive matters of 
concern to the both the French and U.S. governments.  He is 
highly regarded by superiors and colleagues within the MFA. 
Familiarizing him with the U.S. government's policymaking 
structure and providing him with a deeper knowledge of 
nonproliferation issues can only serve to make him an even 
more valued diplomatic partner in the future.  In sum, 
Bertolotti is an impressive young French diplomat with a very 
bright future, and is someone with whom U.S officials at this 
post and in Washington will likely be cooperating on issues of 
vital concern for many years to come.

An invitation to the U.S. will permit our candidate to 
identify and develop proactive initiatives with GOF 
counterparts engaged in  terrorist attacks. It will help 
enhance intelligence sharing and encourage links and 
professional exchanges. 
We recommend that Nivaggioli be exposed to the changes of 
performance indicators after September 11, so that he can 
identify trends and changes in intelligence methodologies and 
be able to harmonize joint intelligence programs.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Josette Steinbach 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
According to Intelligence Director Nivaggioli, Marseille, the 
second largest city in France with an "unofficial count of 30% 
immigrants" is a "powder keg" where massive shifts of 
population have never been as important and worrisome. The 
recent enormous trans-border circulation taking place in the 
PACA region is highly scrutinized by the RG (the Secret 
Services) searching for organized crime related to drug 
traffic and money laundering, an historical fact in a port 
city that has traditionally drawn waves of immigrants from the 
entire Mediterranean basin. 
The 60,000 Comorians out of the 500,000 worldwide who moved to 
Marseille during the last decade have substantially increased 
in  recent years the Muslim population in Marseille to the 
record number of almost a third of the entire population. 
Nivaggioli, a prime source of information for this Consulate 
General has been helpful in analyzing the sometimes difficult 
adjustment that the younger generation of Muslims has to make 
in dealing with French secular society and how some are easily 
wooed by Middle East fanatics.  For example, Nivaggioli was 
instrumental in the success of the US Navy aircraft carrier 
USS Roosevelt's visit to Marseille in 2002. He provided frank 
and honest analysis of potential threats, that helped US 
military officials make their decisions to send the carrier to 
Marseille. During the visit, with his ears to the ground, he 
kept the US Consulate apprised of security issues. 
In the GWOT, Nivaggioli has never faltered in his dedication, 
willingness and cooperation to keep the Consulate and its 
staff safe. He maintains regular liaison with the US 
Consulate's sole US Law Enforcement representative. Through 
this conduit the Consulate is made aware of event/issues that 
could impact on the staff safety. 
At age 43, Nivaggioli heads one the most active intelligence 
services in southern France. A scrupulous professional, 
Nivaggioli needs now to move a step ahead in his promising 
career by being exposed to a good overview of the U.S. counter 
terrorism policy, gaining insight especially into U.S. 
methodologies that promote Franco-American cooperation in this 
crucial area.
