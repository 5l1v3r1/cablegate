Global Sell-off Hits Egypt 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Following a decline of 2.1% on January 20, Egyptian stocks 
had their weakest day in 18 months on January 21, when they plunged 
4.2%, the largest one-day decline since July 2006.  The sell-off 
continued January 22, with the CASE falling another 3.29% toward the 
end of trading.  The three day loss (January 20-22) totals 10.44%. 
On January 21, the market traded 81 million shares valued at LE 1.7 
billion ($314 million), 23% above the average for the last 90 days. 
Foreign institutional investors have been selling heavily in large 
caps like Orascom Telecom, Orascom Construction Industries, 
EFG-Hermes, Telecom Egypt and Commercial International Bank. 
Orascom Telecom led the plunge on January 21, dipping 7.0% to LE 
78.12 ($14.46). MobiNil followed that day, losing 6.8% to end the 
session at LE 205.00 ($37.96).  Domestic and Gulf institutional 
investors also sold heavily in mid and small caps.  The sell-off was 
triggered largely by foreign institutional investors reacting to 
falls across global markets. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange (CASE) was in the 
midst of a rally that had been underway for some time, but had 
accelerated in July 2007, when the Fed cut rates and foreign 
investors began pouring into Middle Eastern markets, especially 
Egypt's.  Heavy trading followed the December 2007 announcement of 
the sale of Orascom Construction to France's Lafarge (reftel).  The 
CASE hit an historic high on January 13 (reaching 11,035), prompting 
local analysts to begin predicting a correction, as the Lafarge deal 
had lead to overvaluing of all stocks in the Orascom Group, 
including Orascom Telecoms. 
 
¶3.  (U) EFG-Hermes Investment Bank analyst Simon Kitchen told us 
that he expects the CASE to continue downward for a while, but was 
optimistic about market recovery.  Egypt's macroeconomic indicators 
are still strong, and high liquidity in Gulf countries, combined 
with increased interest from Western investors in emerging markets 
is likely to make Egypt a prime destination for foreign portfolio 
investment in the medium to long term.  Kitchen was especially 
optimistic about the new "MENA" funds created by some large firms 
(Schroeder's, T. Rowe Price).  These funds will focus on diversified 
large caps, such as the Orascom Group, and are expected to bolster 
markets across the MENA region.
