SUBJECT: SADC TRIBUNAL RULES AGAIN IN FAVOR OF ZIMBABWEAN FARMERS 
 
REF: WINDHOEK 380 
 
¶1.  (U) This report was coordinated with Embassy Harare. 
 
¶2.  (U) On June 6, the SADC Tribunal again sided with the Zimbabwean 
farmers who are seeking an order to stop the Government of Zimbabwe 
(GOZ) from expropriating their farms.  The court ruled unanimously 
that the GOZ was in contempt of the Tribunal's November 2008 ruling, 
which called for an end to Zimbabwe's land reform program, and it 
referred the case to the SADC Summit for its consideration.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶3.  (U) On June 6, Poloff attended the ruling of the Windhoek-based 
SADC Tribunal in the case of Michael Campbell and 77 other 
Zimbabwean farmers, who are continuing their legal battle with the 
Government of Zimbabwe to stop its controversial land reform 
program.  Last November, the Tribunal ruled in favor of the farmers. 
Citing the policy as racist and illegal, the four-member panel of 
judges at that time ordered the GOZ to pay compensation to the white 
farmers no later than June 2009 as well as "to protect the 
possession of ownership of the land" (Reftel).  The decision, 
however, has been repeatedly violated. 
 
¶4.  (U) After court came to order on June 6, Deputy Attorney General 
of Zimbabwe Prince Machaya filed a last-minute appeal to postpone 
the contempt application by the farmers, claiming the GOZ had not 
been given adequate time to prepare its case.  President of the 
Tribunal Justice Ariranga Govindasamy Pillay of Mauritius declined 
the application, to which Machaya replied that he lacked 
instructions to proceed with the case.  The hearing continued, with 
the Tribunal hearing only the petition of the farmers. 
 
¶5.  (U) In handing down the Tribunal's ruling, Pillay criticized 
statements made by President Mugabe at his eightieth birthday party 
at which he dismissed the November ruling as "nonsense" and "of no 
consequence".  Pillay also cited statements made by Zimbabwean 
Attorney General Johannes Tomana, who had announced that the GOZ 
would defy the Tribunal's ruling.  Furthermore, the judges referred 
to the speech that Zimbabwean Deputy Chief Justice Luke Malaba 
delivered at the opening of the 2009 legal year, in which he stated 
that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction whatsoever over the Campbell 
case.  Pillay then ordered the GOZ to compensate the farmer's legal 
fees, at an amount to be agreed to by both parties.  Barring 
agreement, he ordered the SADC registrar to step in and determine 
the financial compensation.  In addition, the Tribunal referred the 
issue of Zimbabwe's refusal to comply with the November ruling to 
the SADC summit for consideration and appropriate action. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In accordance with the SADC Tribunal procedures, judicial 
decisions are expected to be enforced by the SADC Summit.  There was 
skepticism among the observers in the courtroom, however-- which was 
comprised of members of the diplomatic community and prominent civil 
society organizations-- that SADC would be inclined to take up the 
issue with much gusto.
