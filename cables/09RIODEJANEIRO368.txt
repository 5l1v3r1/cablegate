Rio-based center-right daily O Globo writes: "It is as bad for 
Brazil to land in Copenhagen without a target for reducing its 
emissions as to set an unrealistic one... There is the fear that 
this might happen though, based on the strange suppression of the 
internal debate of the issue by the Ministry of Agriculture - the 
sector that directly and indirectly contributes the most to the 
emissions. This raises questions about the quality of the decision 
to be made."  (Nov 5, page 38)
