SUBJECT:  Hamas in Sudan for Pan-Arab Support 
 
¶1.  (U) Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal was in 
Khartoum February 12-14 for high-level meetings as part 
of his tour to solidify Pan-Arab support.  According to 
local pmedia, Meshaal also confirmed his attendance the 
Arab League Summit to be held in Khartoum at the end of 
March.  Sudan is a longtime supporter of the Palestinian 
movement in general and Hamas in particular.  Meshaal 
held separate meetings with First Vice President Salva 
Kiir, Vice President Ali Osman Taha, and State (Deputy) 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Al-Karti.  Meshaal then 
held meetings with Islamic party leaders, including 
Professor Abd Al-Rahem Ali, Shura Council Chairman of the 
ruling National Congress Party (NCO), and leaders from 
Sadiq Al-Madi's Umma Party and Hassan Al-Turabi's Popular 
Congress Party (PCP).  Meshaal finished his visit by 
having discussions with civic organizations, most notably 
the Organization for Defense of Faith and Nation. 
 
¶2.  Local press accounts state that the Hamas leader 
consistently delivered a message of thanks to the 
government and people of Sudan for the continuing support 
in the battle to end the "Zionist occupation," and asked 
Sudan to assist in Hamas' formation of a national 
coalition government.  Meshaal called on the 
international community to support the will of the 
Palestinian people, and said that Hamas would respond to 
the challenge of governing within a coalition.  In 
separate meetings, he said that Israel should recognize 
Hamas, but reiterated that Hamas would not recognize 
Israel.  Meshaal also emphasized the importance of his 
upcoming trip to Russia to break the United States' 
aggressive stand against the party.
