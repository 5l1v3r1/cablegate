¶1. (SBU) Based on Embassy's ongoing dialogue with the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's 
(DFAIT) Latin America and Caribbean officials, Embassy's 
assessment is that Canada has consistently worked to 
promote the advancement of democracy, good governance, and 
human rights in Cuba. Canada shares the U.S. goals of 
promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba, while 
maintaining its own policy of "principled engagement" 
with both the Cuban government and dissident elements. 
Canada believes its approach allows it to have a 
positive impact on human rights and democracy in Cuba. 
Canada maintains a diplomatic presence in Havana and 
conducts aid programs worth about C$10 million/year. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Canada has engaged and intervened on 
behalf of human rights and the advancement of 
democratization in Cuba a number of times over the past six 
months: 
 
-- Canadian and Cuban officials met regularly to discuss 
the harsh treatment of dissidents.  Conversations were 
reportedly "firm and frank;" 
 
-- the Canadian Embassy sponsors Canadian Studies Centers 
in several locations in Cuba to inform the general populace 
about life in a democratic country with a market-based 
economy.  A wide range of literature on human rights and 
democracy is available in these centers.  The Canadian 
government also regularly sends speakers to these venues, as 
well as funds economics professors teaching modern economic 
theory at the University of Havana; 
 
-- the Canadian Foundation for the Americas (FOCAL), a 
Canadian government-funded think tank, maintains an active 
series of programs on Cuba that focus on support for 
dissidents and democratization.  It has a comprehensive 
program for documenting all Cuban government actions 
against dissidents, supports an active dialogue on planning 
for the post-Castro area, and assists civil society programs 
on 
human rights and democracy; 
 
¶4. (SBU) High-level diplomatic visits between Cuba and 
Canada over the past six months have included: 
 
-     Canadian Assistant Deputy Minister (Americas) of 
Foreign Affairs Alexandra Bugailiskis represented Canada 
at the Havana International Trade Fair on November 3; 
 
-     Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade Raul de la Nuez 
visited Canada on November 28, and met with Canadian 
Minister of International Trade Stockwell Day and Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food Gerry Ritz; and, 
 
-     Canadian Assistant Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs 
for Global Issues Keith Christie visited Cuba on December 1. 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to DFAIT, Canada offered 
over C$1 million (approximately USD 830,000) in 
humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people in the wake of 
Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.  The aid went through 
the Red Cross and other NGOs.  The government is still 
considering providing additional aid to the Cuban people 
through the United Nations. 
 
¶6. (SBU) DFAIT confirmed that Canadian businesses 
participated 
in the November 3 Havana Trade, but declined to disclose the 
names of the companies.  Media reports have indicated Canada 
remains Cuba's third largest trade partner, with a 9.4% 
growth 
in trade over 2007.  Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade de la 
Nuez 
said publicly that trade between Canada and Cuba amounted to 
USD $1.4 billion so far in 2008.  The media also reported 
that 
the Canadian Wheat Board and Cuba's Alimport signed an 
agreement 
at the Havana Trade Fair for the sale of 150,000 tons of 
Canadian 
wheat to Cuba.  Canada is also one of the largest foreign 
Qwheat to Cuba.  Canada is also one of the largest foreign 
investors 
in Cuba.  Canadian natural resources company Sherritt 
International, 
the largest and most established Canadian firm in Cuba, 
engages in

mining, oil, and gas production as well as electricity 
generation, and 
soybean processing.  Canadian companies operate in a variety 
of 
sectors of the Cuban economy, including tourism, 
construction, 
agriculture, bio-technology, and mining.  Canadian exports to 
Cuba 
in 2007 were estimated at C$ 563 million (USD 524 million). 
Main 
exports are machinery, electronic equipment, motor vehicles, 
as 
well as copper, iron, and steel products.  Canadian imports 
from 
Cuba were worth about C$1.06 billion (USD 988 million) in 
¶2007. 
Primary imports are tobacco, books and newspapers, and 
seafood. 
Canadians represent close to one third of Cuba's foreign 
tourists. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Canada has no bilateral trade agreements with 
Cuba.  According to DFAIT, Canada and Cuba are set to begin 
negotiations on a Foreign Investment Protection Agreement 
(a bilateral investment treaty) in 2009.  During his April 
visit to Cuba, Canadian Agriculture Minister Ritz and his 
Cuban counterpart renewed an existing MOU on technical 
cooperation in 
agriculture. 
 
¶8. (U) Canada does not have any formal exchange programs 
specific to Cuba.  The Canadian government maintains a 
Canada-Caribbean Community Leadership Scholarship Program 
offering university students scholarships for short-term 
research exchanges, for which students from across the 
Caribbean -- including Cuba -- are eligible to apply.  In 
addition, many exchanges occur informally between 
organizations such as high school sports teams and cultural 
groups.
