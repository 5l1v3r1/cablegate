SUBJECT: TURKMEN GAS TO RUSSIA TO RESUME IN JANUARY 
 
REF: 09 ASHGABAT 1654 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On December 31, 2009, several Russian media outlets cited 
a Gazprom spokesman saying that Gazprom will resume imports of 
Turkmen gas on January 9, 2010 at 10 a.m.  Turkmengaz and Gazprom 
agreed to resume gas supplies during President Medvedev's December 
visit to Ashgabat (reftel).  Gazprom originally announced that the 
supplies would restart between January 1 and January 10.  To date, 
no information has been officially disclosed by Turkmen authorities 
as to the price and volume of Turkmen gas deliveries to Russia, or 
the exact date that gas supplies will resume. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An official at the Turkmen Oil and Gas Ministry refused to 
confirm the date gas exports to Russia would resume, but mentioned 
that Turkmenistan's gas export facilities are ready for the 
resumption of deliveries, adding that Turkmengaz is prepared to 
re-start gas imports at any time.  The official also mentioned that 
most of the Russia-bound gas will originate from the Dowletabat gas 
field, as was the case before the April pipeline explosion. 
Although media reports continue to speculate that Russia plans to 
purchase only 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Turkmen gas in 2010 
(in 2008 Gazprom reportedly purchased 49 bcm), Gazprom and 
Turkmengaz officials have stated that Russia has the option to 
purchase up to 30 bcm of gas per year. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The resumption of gas deliveries to Russia has 
received scarce mention in Turkmen media.  It is possible that the 
price and/or volume are not as high as the Turkmen would like.  At 
the same time, both parties have left the door open for additional 
volumes, should Russia see a need for more gas in 2010.  END 
COMMENT.
