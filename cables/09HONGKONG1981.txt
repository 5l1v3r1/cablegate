SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: PRE-LICENSE CHECK: TAL APPAREL LIMITED 
 
REF: A) BIS e-mail PLC request dated October 14, 2009 B) D425104 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), conducted 
a pre-license check at Tal Apparel Limited, Tal Building, 4th Floor, 
49 Austin Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong (Tal). The purpose of the visit 
was to determine the suitability of Tal to be the ultimate consignee 
and end user of a Flir systems thermovision mounted thermal camera 
that is the subject of license application D425104.  The item (ECCN 
6A003) is controlled for national security (NS) reasons. The license 
applicant is Trek Equipment of Sausalito, California. 
 
¶3.  A search of the Hong Kong Companies Registry reveals that Tal 
has been in existence since 1983. Its registered capital is the Hong 
Kong equivalent of USD 80 million. 
¶4. A review of the company's web site (www.talgroup.com) reveals 
that the Tal Group is a world leader in the production of clothing. 
The Tal Group manufactures (at locations throughout Asia) 1 out of 
every 6 dress shirts sold in the U.S. Its headquarters are in Hong 
Kong. 
 
¶5.  On October 23, 2009, ECO and FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie 
Chan visited the company and met with Eugene Lee, Human Capital 
Management, Cherry C.K. Tang, Senior Executive and Franky C.K. Lam 
Department Manager.  Mr. Lee explained that Tal is purchasing 15 
Flir cameras for use in the company's production facilities 
throughout Asia.  They are intended to be used for rapid body 
temperature checks of employees entering production facilities to 
minimize the potential spread of flu among employees.  Presently, 
the company uses low tech hand held devices to check employee 
temperatures and the Flir cameras will allow them to test employees 
much more rapidly and in a less invasive way. 
 
¶6.  As to the specific camera that is the subject of license 
application D425104, Mr. Lee stated that it would be held as a spare 
in Hong Kong (where there are no production facilities).  In the 
event any of the other cameras needed replacement, the Hong Kong 
unit would be sent to the location in question.  Mr. Lee stated that 
he did not believe application D425104 made this point clear.  ECO 
found Tal employees to be open and credible in their explanations. 
 
¶7.  Based on the information detailed herein, ECO believes Tal to be 
a suitable recipient of controlled U.S. origin technology.
