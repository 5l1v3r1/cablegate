SUBJECT:  NCP POLITICIANS:  "CLOSE U.S. MISSION" 
 
 
¶1. (U) During an annual conference of military conscripts on September 
23, several pro-National Congress Party (NCP) politicians said that 
proposed UN intervention in Darfur was a ruse to steal Sudan's 
resources and called on the Sudanese government to close the U.S. 
Mission for violating Sudanese law. 
 
¶2. (U) Fathi Khalil, the chairman of the Sudanese Bar Association, 
described the presence of the U.S. Mission in Sudan as a threat to 
national security and accused it of espionage.  He said that the 
U.S. Embassy's activities did not strengthen relations between Sudan 
and the USG. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Badereldin Taha, a prominent NCP politician, said that UN 
Security Council Resolution 1706 represented a Western strategy to 
dominate Arab and Islamic countries and make them a "toy in the 
hands of the U.S."  He declared his support for countering 
international intervention with force, characterized the conflict 
between the Sudanese government and the international community as 
religious, and called on the Sudanese people to practice jihad 
against the "Crusaders."  "We are neither terrorists nor 
fundamentalists, but we are against the Pope's analysis and his 
abuses of Islam," said Taha.  (Note:  Taha was a luminary in the 
National Islamic Front, a former governor of Khartoum, and a former 
Minister of Trade.  He recently resigned from the Popular Congress 
Party to join the NCP.  End note.) 
 
¶4. (U) National Assembly Member Fadul Jadeen lauded the Sudanese 
government's humanitarian programs in Darfur.  He also claimed that 
international non-governmental organizations inflated their 
contributions to relief efforts, claiming they provided no more than 
30 percent of the needs of internally displaced persons.  He said 
that the UN has no legal basis to intervene in the internal affairs 
of Sudan, and blamed the Darfur crisis on a diplomatic and 
intelligence effort, in cooperation with international media, to 
capture Sudan's wealth.
