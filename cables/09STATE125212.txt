CONSULTATIONS 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request:  USUN is instructed to draw 
from the points below during UN Security Council 
consultations on Cyprus scheduled for December 9, 2009. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin points: 
 
I would like to thank Special Advisor Downer and Special 
Representative Zerihoun for your briefings and welcome you 
back to the Council.  I would also like to thank you for your 
efforts on behalf of the UN to assist the Cypriot people in 
their pursuit of a comprehensive settlement.  I would like to 
make the following four points: 
 
First, the United States fully supports the settlement 
process.  We agree that this process must continue to be 
Cypriot-led.  However, the UN plays a critical support role 
in the process,through the Good Offices Mission, and we 
welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to facilitate 
reunification into a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation.  The 
parties also need strong Council and international support 
where possible as they prepare to make what will surely be 
difficult compromises.  We commend the work of Mr. Downer and 
his team to facilitate this process.  We are behind you. 
 
Second, UN involvement will be especially important as the 
negotiations enter their more difficult stages in the coming 
weeks and months.  We commend Mr. Downer,s recent 
intensified involvement on the island and would welcome a 
push for an additional series of back to back negotiating 
sessions to fully exploit the window of opportunity at hand. 
The increased frequency of talks has contributed to the 
achievement of convergence in some areas, but also to 
agreements on a schedule for future meetings, which help to 
ensure that the current momentum can be maintained. 
 
Third, we agree with the Secretary-General that the 
negotiations cannot be viewed as a zero-sum game if they are 
to be successful ) both sides will gain in a united Cyprus. 
An informed public can more easily lend its support to the 
settlement negotiations and the later implementation of a 
peace agreement.  Public participation and engagement 
regarding efforts to reach a solution are crucial.  The 
Council can show its support by welcoming progress such as 
was achieved with the June 26, 2009 agreement to open the 
Limnitis/Yesilirmak crossing.  The United States has pledged 
$900,000 in support of the implementation of this agreement 
and urges other member states to lend their support, as well. 
 
Fourth, the United States fully supports an extension of 
UNFICYP,s mandate for six months.  UNFICYP plays an 
important role on the island, especially through its 
confidence building activities which contribute to the 
stability of the buffer zone and to overall UN efforts in 
support of the settlement negotiations. We look forward to 
the next reports of the Secretary-General, including as the 
Council noted in its previous resolution, contingency 
planning in relation to the settlement talks. 
 
Mr. President, the United States continues to stand ready 
with the international community to assist in whatever way we 
can in support of the parties, efforts to reach a just and 
lasting settlement that reunifies Cyprus into a bi-zonal and 
bi-communal federation.
