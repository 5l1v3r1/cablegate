SUBJECT: GUIDANCE FOR UNSC CONSULTATIONS ON ZIMBABWE JULY 
29 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  USUN may draw from the 
talking points in para 2 during the July 29 UNSC 
consultations on the situation in Zimbabwe and briefing by UN 
Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs Haile 
Menkerios.  USUN should also draw on these points in speaking 
to the press after the meeting. 
 
¶2.  Begin talking points: 
 
-- I would like to thank Assistant Secretary General for 
Political Affairs Haile Menkerios for his briefing on the 
situation in Zimbabwe.  We continue to be concerned about the 
welfare of the Zimbabwean people as a result of 
ongoing government-sanctioned violence and government 
restrictions on humanitarian operations.  With that in mind, 
I would like to make four points. 
 
-- First, the United States hopes that the talks that began 
last week in South Africa between Zimbabwe Africa National 
Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and the Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC) result in a new government that 
reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people as expressed on 
March 29.  Should that occur, the U.S. stands ready to 
provide a substantial assistance package, development aid, 
and further help through international financial 
institutions.  While we continue to support the South 
African-led Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
mediation we also believe that a strong UN and AU role during 
the negotiations is critical. Assistant Secretary General 
Menkerios has demonstrated the ability to contribute 
positively to the ZANU-PF/MDC mediation, and we encourage the 
UN to select him as its representative to the negotiations in 
Pretoria.  We hope that he can return to South Africa 
immediately, to continue to play an active role in those 
negotiations and help the parties reach an agreement on a 
solution to the political crisis in Zimbabwe. 
 
-- Second, we continue to be concerned with the ongoing 
state-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe.  Targeted attacks by 
the Mugabe regime against MDC officials and their families 
continue, and pockets of violence still exist in northern and 
eastern provinces.  Many MDC parliamentarians have been 
arbitrarily arrested or detained and others have been forced 
into hiding in a deliberate attempt by the Mugabe regime to 
impede the opposition's ability to function effectively. 
 
--While perpetrators of violence enjoy impunity, tens of 
thousands of displaced Zimbabweans are afraid to return 
home for fear of reprisal; and others have no homes to return 
to as a result of ZANU-PF destruction.  Additionally, 
Zimbabweans continue to struggle to survive in a ruined 
economy.  With inflation at over 2 million percent, a record 
high, many residents and businesses have resorted to the 
barter system.  Unemployment is the norm.  Compounding the 
problem is the government's ongoing ban on NGO activities, 
which prevents desperately needed aid from reaching millions 
of people at risk following a poor harvest. 
 
-- Third, both the European Union and the U.S. have recently 
announced expanded, targeted sanctions.  Last week the U.S. 
signed a new Executive Order that expands our sanctions 
against those who have and continue to support violence and 
oppose democracy in Zimbabwe and against state-controlled 
entities from which they profit.  These new sanctions build 
upon existing sanctions placed on more than a hundred 
individuals in the inner circle of the Mugabe regime who have 
contributed to the undermining of democratic processes and 
institutions in Zimbabwe.  The U.S. is 
also expanding travel restrictions on immediate family 
members of responsible government officials, so that no 
one connected to Mugabe's regime will have the privilege of 
traveling to the U.S. while millions of Zimbabweans 
suffer as a result of their actions.  These are targeted 
sanctions that focus on the regime and its supporters, not on 
the people of Zimbabwe or the broader economy. 
 
-- Fourth, as part of our commitment to help the people of 
Zimbabwe in their time of greatest need, we have provided 
over $120 million in food aid and other support inside 
Zimbabwe.  In addition, we will be providing $2.5 million in 
U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance for refugees 
and asylum seekers in neighboring countries. 
 
-- The political commitment of the entire international 
 
STATE 00081253  002 OF 002 
 
 
community will be needed to help Zimbabweans move to a more 
secure and democratic future.  We thank UN Assistant 
Secretary General for Political Affairs Haile Menkerios for 
keeping the Council informed of developments in Zimbabwe.
