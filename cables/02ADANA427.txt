¶2.  ANTI-WAR RALLY IN ADANA 
(Evrensel/Milli Gazete/Bolge)  On December 22, nearly 
500 workers, laborers and youths who were members of 
the Labor Party (EMEP), the Freedom and Solidarity 
Party (ODP), the TKP (Turkish Communist Party) and the 
Public Training Centers, all components of the Adana 
War Opponents Platform, gathered in Adana's Ugur Mumcu 
Square to protest the December 19 decision by the 
Adana Governor's Office to postpone until February the 
proposed anti-war rally the Platform wanted to 
organize on December 22.  "We do not want to become 
U.S. puppets," the protestors said.  Yasin Aytac of 
the Haber-Sen in Adana read a press release on behalf 
of the platform characterizing the postponement as 
"the throwing backward of humanitarian values."  Aytac 
said he did not want the Governor's Office and the 
Incirlik Air Base to become the center of war and the 
U.S. Consulate a war representation.  Aytac added the 
U.S. did not have the right to teach anyone the lesson 
of human rights and democracy because none of the 
Middle Eastern administrations which the U.S. 
supported were democratic.  He also criticized the 
U.S. stance on Israel's attitude toward Palestine. 
"We reject a war decision by the government, which 
acts like a satellite or a colonial governor of the 
U.S., on our behalf," he indicated.  A similar 
demonstration was held in Izmir, where hundreds of 
thousands of people protested government practices 
thus far and its pro-war attitude.  Turkiye reported 
nearly 1,500 people, including children, attended the 
anti-war rally in Adana, carrying banners and shouting 
slogans that were critical of war and the U.S. 
[Consulate personnel observed only 150-200 people.] 
 
 
¶3.  NINE KADEK MEMBERS ARRESTED IN MARDIN 
(Turkiye)  Mardin police arrested nine KADEK (PKK) 
members who admitted having come from Istanbul to 
carry out KADEK activities in rural Nusaybin (Mardin). 
A pistol, a cartridge clip and ten rounds of 
ammunition were seized in the search of one arrestee's 
home. 
 
 
¶4.  THREE SUSPECTS ORDERED HELD FOR MEMBERSHIP IN PKK 
(Evrensel)  The Van State Security Court ordered three 
of the six people arrested in an anti-KADEK (PKK) 
operation in Van for preparing to join the PKK to 
remain in custody for "membership in the 
organization."  The remaining three arrestees, all 
under 18 years of age, were sent to the Van Security 
Directorate's Children's Department to be handed over 
to their families. 
 
 
¶5.  PETITION DRIVE FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION 
(Evrensel)  The Adiyaman Democracy Platform launched a 
"Hand in Hand for a New Constitution" petition drive, 
claiming the 1982 Constitution fails to meet the needs 
of the Turkish society.
