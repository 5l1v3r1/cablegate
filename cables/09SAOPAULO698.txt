"And Brazil Abstains [from voting at IAEA on censuring Iran]" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-28) states:  "Four days 
after Iran's leader, Mahmud Ahmadinejad, departed Brazil, Brazil's 
Foreign Ministry had the first opportunity to apply the principles 
of its foreign policy enunciated by President Lula before his 
Iranian counterpart.  The result was frustrating....On Monday, 
before Ahmadinejad, President Lula reiterated his repudiation of 
atomic weapons, as inscribed in Brazil's Constitution.  He defended 
the use of nuclear energy for peaceful ends, guided by 
international treaties.  Apparently those were words thrown into 
the wind -- while Iran deviates from this route, Brazil's Foreign 
Ministry just omits it."
