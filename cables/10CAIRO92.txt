SUBJECT:   Update on Baby Trafficking Case in Alexandria 
 
REFS: (A) CAIRO 2291 (B) CAIRO 1828 and previous 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Egyptian authorities in Alexandria are quickly 
progressing with the investigation of the case described in ref (A). 
 In addition, to the American citizen husband, the alleged Egyptian 
birth mother has been arrested and detained. Arrest warrants have 
also been issued for a doctor and an individual identified as the 
facilitator in the case. A Coptic priest is also wanted for 
questioning. Egyptian State Security Investigative Services (SSIS) 
is looking at several other cases in Alexandria that may also 
involve illegal adoption and baby trafficking. End Summary. 
 
Some Questions Answered 
----------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Through an examination of the available evidence to include 
cell phone numbers, SSIS determined the identity and location of the 
alleged Egyptian birth mother in Cairo. Subsequent questioning 
revealed she had become pregnant out of wedlock and had been urged 
to keep the child by her work supervisor. The woman worked at a 
large, well-known cosmetic company in Cairo and her supervisor was 
the head of the Human Relations Office. Her supervisor allegedly 
arranged for her to have a Cesarean in a hospital in Alexandria when 
she was eight months pregnant and paid all subsequent bills. In 
addition, the detained American admitted to the Egyptian prosecutor 
that he had frequent contact with a Coptic priest in the period 
leading up to receiving the premature infant. 
 
Fugitives 
--------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In addition to the doctor described in ref (A) who 
continues to be a fugitive, SSIS has been attempting to locate the 
above supervisor and the Coptic priest at their respective habitual 
places of residence. With regards to the latter, the Coptic priest 
appeared at the U.S. Embassy to apply for a visa the day after a 
subpoena was issued by the prosecutor. He withdrew his application 
before he was finger-scanned and interviewed.  He appeared at the 
Canadian Embassy the following day to apply for a visa. The visa was 
issued, but subsequently cancelled when post informed the FPM at the 
Canadian Embassy that the Coptic priest is wanted by the Egyptian 
authorities for questioning. 
 
FPU and SSIS Cooperation 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) SSIS in Alexandria requested a briefing by the Fraud 
Prevention Unit (FPU) on the baby trafficking network that was 
uncovered in Cairo and described in ref (B). During a three hour 
meeting in Alexandria with senior SSIS officers, the FPM presented 
the profile developed by the FPU with regards to the Cairo cases. In 
addition, the FPM alerted SSIS of two cases that had been confirmed 
to involve newborns given by the Coptic Church to couples seeking 
children.  One of the cases concerned an elderly Egyptian couple who 
had applied for visas with a young boy they claimed as their 
biological child. The man subsequently admitted to the FPM that they 
had been given the child by a Coptic priest in Alexandria. CCD 
checks revealed that the Coptic priest and his wife are U.S. Legal 
Permanent Residents. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) SSIS in Alexandria is actively pursuing all leads in this 
case in an attempt to fully uncover any other potential baby 
trafficking networks.  The most senior SSIS general in Alexandria is 
following the investigation and has solicited the cooperation of the 
FPU. Post will continue to report on this case as information is 
developed.
