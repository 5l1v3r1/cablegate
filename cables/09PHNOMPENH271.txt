SUBJECT: ENVIRONMENTAL OUTREACH FOR EARTH DAY 2009 AND BEYOND 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  Embassy Phnom Penh celebrated Earth Day 2009 through 
two outreach events that promoted environmental awareness and 
conservation and celebrated Cambodia's biodiversity.  On April 22, 
the DCM discussed environmental challenges and participated in a 
community cleanup event with university and high school students in 
Kampong Cham.  On April 25, the Ambassador hosted about 80 
elementary school students for an Earth Day celebration at the 
embassy, where the students unveiled murals based on environmental 
drawings they had created.  Outreach activities like these help to 
address the relatively low awareness of environmental issues in 
Cambodia and the impact that individuals can have on their 
surroundings.  The embassy plans to continue reinforcing the 
important messages delivered in recognition of Earth Day through 
ongoing and future outreach activities.  END SUMMARY. 
 
STUDENTS DISCUSS CONSERVATION IN KAMPONG CHAM 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On April 22, the DCM met with a group of approximately 60 
university and high school students at the University of Management 
and Economics' American Corner in Kampong Cham Province to discuss 
environmental challenges and awareness in Cambodia.  The students 
represented a mix of English Access Microscholarship recipients and 
members of the local English language club.  The DCM, switching 
freely between English and Khmer, fielded questions about the 
importance of conservation, USG environmental programs in Cambodia, 
and how other countries were addressing environmental challenges. 
The DCM noted that as Cambodian citizens, the students were the 
owners of the country's natural resources, and he encouraged them to 
think about ways that they could help to protect those resources. 
Following the session, the DCM accompanied the students to Wat Nokor 
Bachey, an Angkorian-era temple outside of Kampong Cham town, to 
pick up litter and continue their discussions. 
 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS CELEBRATE CAMBODIA'S BIODIVERSITY 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3.  On April 25, the Ambassador hosted almost 80 students from two 
local elementary schools and an NGO program for AIDS orphans and 
children suffering from HIV/AIDS at the embassy for a second Earth 
Day event celebrating Cambodia's biodiversity.  Several weeks before 
the event, the students submitted drawings of Cambodian 
environmental scenes, which a non-profit Cambodian art school then 
converted into large, colorful murals using oil paints on tin 
roofing material.  The Ambassador and the students unveiled the 6' X 
6' murals at the event. 
 
¶4.  The students discussed their paintings with the Ambassador, 
played games with American and Cambodian embassy staff, and received 
Cambodia-U.S. friendship backpacks supplied by ODC with art supplies 
supplied by PAO in appreciation for their participation.  Local 
journalists attended the event and interviewed the Ambassador on 
environmental challenges in Cambodia.  The event received positive 
coverage in all the major Khmer-language newspapers and was featured 
on the highest-rated Cambodian television network. 
 
MOVING BEYOND EARTH DAY 
----------------------- 
 
¶5.  COMMENT:  Environmental issues in Cambodia stem from RGC 
prioritization of development over conservation, lack of funding for 
basic services like trash removal, and low public awareness of 
environmental issues and the impacts, both positive and negative, 
that individuals can have on their surroundings.  While the first 
two challenges are more difficult to tackle, promoting interest in 
environmental issues is a relatively simple and effective activity 
in Cambodia. 
 
¶6.  Embassy Phnom Penh plans to continue promoting the messages of 
environmental conservation and stewardship introduced in our Earth 
Day activities.  For example, we are working with the Ministry of 
Environment to develop activities for Cambodian Environment Week May 
31 - June 5. 
 
¶7.  The embassy also recently formed a Green Team to explore ways 
the mission can improve its own environmental footprint.  Green Team 
members take turns writing environmentally-themed articles, which 
are posted on the embassy's website in English and Khmer.  Ripple 
effects from this initiative have already been seen as one article 
on plastic bottle use has been featured in the country's highest 
circulation daily.  END COMMENT.
