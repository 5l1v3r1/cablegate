¶1. (U) PolOff delivered reftel points to MFA Deputy Iraq Task 
Force Director Damiano Francovigh.  The MFA had already 
issued a statement on the formation of the Iraq Transitional 
Government.  An informal translation of the statement is 
provided below. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin text.  The expected confidence vote of the Iraqi 
parliament for the transitional government formed by Ibrahim 
Ja'afari was registered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
with great appreciation, in that -- underscored Minister Fini 
-- the Iraqi people, for the first time in decades, will 
finally be led by a legitimate, representative, and 
democratically elected government. 
 
Iraq has now completed the important phase of perfecting its 
institutions.  Now the list of ministers needs to be 
completed as soon as possible, based on the principle of 
inclusion, and then immediately the drafting of the 
constitutional charter, in view of the close deadlines, in 
which the union and collaboration on the part of all Iraqis 
will have a hand. 
 
In formulating his best wishes for good and successful work 
to the confirmed FM Zebari, Minister Fini underlined that the 
new executive could rely on the concrete and enduring support 
of the Italian government. 
 
Iraq, he added, knows it can also count on the cooperation of 
the international community, and Italy will continue to 
engage in the upcoming weeks to strengthen the unity of 
intentions that is necessary in Europe and on the 
transatlantic front to complete the path of liberty and 
independence of the country.
