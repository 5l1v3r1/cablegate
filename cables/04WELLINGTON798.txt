SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND'S VIEWS ON WORLD HUNGER SUMMIT 
 
REF: STATE 197337 
 
¶1. Post on September 16 delivered reftel demarche regarding 
the World Leaders Meeting on Action Against Hunger and 
Poverty to Phillip Taula of the New Zealand Agency for 
International Development (NZAID).  The demarche shared U.S. 
concerns about a draft declaration and a technical paper 
released by the summit's sponsors. 
 
¶2.  Taula said that, although the New Zealand government 
still is considering its position ahead of the meeting, it 
shares a number of the United States' concerns, including 
the papers' lack of a balanced view of development and the 
lack of other important aspects embodied in the Monterrey 
Consensus. 
 
¶3.  The New Zealand government has not studied the technical 
report in detail, although it does not have problems with 
its general language.  Taula said New Zealand was taking a 
cautious approach to the U.K.-proposed International Finance 
Facility.  Before taking a position, it is awaiting 
additional information, particularly the results of World 
Bank studies. 
 
¶4. New Zealand will be represented at the summit by its 
permanent representative to the UN, Don McKay.
