SUBJECT: Toronto's Cocaine Trade Takes a Hit 
 
¶1. In a one day sweep on Wednesday, February 27, Toronto Police 
arrested 23 suspects in an undercover street-level drug dealing bust 
that focused on Toronto's downtown Yonge Street strip.  Toronto 
Police have charged 19 people with 61 different offenses ranging 
from drug dealing to conspiracy.  Responding to citizens' concerns, 
the Toronto Drug Squad, Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy 
(TAVIS), and 52 Division's Community Response Unit and Vice units 
undertook a two-week long probe, dubbed "Project Take the Money and 
Run," which targeted drug transactions concentrating on Yonge-Dundas 
Square, arcades along Yonge Street, nearby College Park, and the 
Atrium on Bay.  Police allege that undercover officers were able to 
purchase quantities of drugs, primarily crack cocaine, from the 
accused; the accused were selling drugs in locations frequented by 
young people; and there was a hierarchy within the dealers, who were 
using people with substance-abuse problems to move the drugs around 
town for them.  Thirteen other individuals are reportedly still 
being sought in connection with this project. 
 
¶2. One day before the street sweep in downtown Toronto, on Tuesday, 
February 26, 2008, Canadian customs officers seized C$3.1 million 
worth of cocaine at the Ambassador Bridge linking Detroit and 
Windsor.  The officers found about 25 kilograms of drugs inside a 
tractor trailer headed for Toronto with a shipment of foam plates, 
according to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).  The cocaine 
was divided into 20 cellophane-wrapped bricks and stashed inside two 
duffle bags.  A Kitchener, Ontario man is charged with importing a 
controlled substance and possession of controlled substances for the 
purpose of trafficking.
