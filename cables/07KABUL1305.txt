SUBJECT: PRT KUNDUZ: TALIBAN LAUNCHES SUCCESSFUL ATTACK IN 
THE NORTH 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  Taliban have claimed responsibility 
for what may be the first successful suicide bombing 
in Afghanistan's northeastern provinces on April 16. 
A suicide bomber blew himself up among some 60 
provincial police officers who were doing morning 
exercises in downtown Kunduz City at about 8:30 am. 
Initial accounts report at least nine police 
officers killed, and over 20 injured.  No civilians 
or international forces were affected.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) At approximately 8:30 am on April 16, a 
suicide bomber reportedly exited a red Toyota Corolla, 
ran into the area where police where gathered, and 
detonated his bomb.  According to press reports, 
Taliban commander Hayatullah Khan claimed 
responsibility and said there would be more attacks. 
"All of our suicide bombers are Afghans, and they are 
present in all Afghan cities and waiting for 
orders," he said.  (Note: At this time we cannot 
confirm whether the bomber received any support from 
local sources.  His leg and one ear were reportedly 
the only remains found on site.  End note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) While Kunduz has seen other types of 
attacks, this incident may mark the first successful 
suicide bomb mission carried out by Taliban in the 
area.  (Note: There was a February 2006 attack near 
an ISAF convoy that killed one person other than the 
bomber, but officials remain unsure whether it was a 
suicide attack or whether the bomber's bicycle was 
rigged, unbeknownst to him.  End note.) Occasional 
small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attacks have 
been waged against ISAF convoys and Afghan National 
Security Forces (ANSF) in Kunduz and surrounding 
provinces.  There have also been periodic IED 
attacks against security forces, and several small 
IEDs have been planted near NGO or other 
international or Afghan civilian facilities.  So 
far, the latter have been assessed as related to 
local disputes rather than organized by outside 
terrorist groups. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The province has periodically received 
warnings of suicide bombers in the past.   Two car 
bombs were discovered in Kunduz and successfully 
defused on August 15, 2006.  At least one other 
intended car bomb has since been seized.  Acting on 
tips and using checkpoints and searches, the local 
security forces (ANSF and NDS) have arrested several 
individuals and groups over the past six months. 
Security forces have also intercepted several loads 
of remote control devices and other bomb-making 
materials, as well as Korans and other innocuous 
items used to camouflage those materials. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: This incident marks the worst 
insurgent attack in the northeast since the ouster 
of the Taliban government in 2001.  The Taliban has 
long tried to extend its terrorist campaign into the 
north (often reaching out to sympathizers among the 
local Pashtun communities) but with only marginal 
success until now.  Bolstered by minimal support for 
Taliban in the region, the ANSF and NDS are 
proactive in following leads on planned attacks, 
making it difficult for outsiders to operate. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment continued: This first successful 
suicide bombing undoubtedly will encourage others. 
References to the attacks being carried out by 
Afghans rather than foreigners reflect the Taliban's 
awareness that infiltration from outsiders will be 
less tolerated in the north than it has been in the 
south.
