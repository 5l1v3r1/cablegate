Beirut 
22 February 2008 
 
The Honorable Dr. Condoleeza Rice 
United States Secretary of State 
 
Dear Madame Secretary, 
 
The recent attack against the embassy of the United States of 
America in Belgrade is an act of terror which we greatly 
condemn.  The United States diplomatic missions as all other 
nations is a means of communication between the people of the 
world and such an attack is in fact a targeting of the 
international community as a whole and an attempt to thrwarts 
our joint effort to make this world a better place. 
 
The United States commitment to democracy and the promotion 
of liberty is undeniable and your support to the people of 
Lebanon and all other nations who are strugglng to preserve 
their freedom and liberty is more than commendable.  We 
salute your efforts to making the world a safer and more 
peaceful, and hope that such heinous acts do not recur. 
 
Best Regards, 
/s/ 
Walid Joumblatt
