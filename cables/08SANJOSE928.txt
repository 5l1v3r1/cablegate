SUBJECT:  COLD FRONT AFFECTING CARIBBEAN COAST OF COSTA RICA AND 
PANAMA: DECLARATION OF DISASTER 
 
¶1. As result of flood damage caused by the interaction of a high and 
low pressure systems on the Caribbean Coast of Costa Rica from 
November 22-26, 2008, the Chief of Mission has determined that the 
disaster is of sufficient magnitude to warrant US Government 
assistance.   The damage has exceeded the effective capacity of the 
Costa Rican Government to respond, the Government of Costa Rica is 
willing to accept USG assistance, and it is in the best interest of 
the US Government to respond. The Chief of Mission is therefore 
exercising his Disaster Assistance Authority. 
 
¶2. Serious flooding has occurred in the Atlantic Coast Region of 
Costa Rica as a result of non stop heavy rains.  The low tropical 
depression caused flooding in the Provinces of Limon, Heredia and 
San Jose.  The most affected areas of Limon are Siquirres, Pococi, 
Matina, Carrandi, Batan and in Talamanca: Sixaola, Bratsi,  Cahuita. 
 In Heredia: Heredia, Barva, Sarapiqui, and San Isidro.  According 
to the latest report from the National Emergency Commission (CNE), 
4890 people are living in 68 shelters as result of the floods caused 
by four continuous days of heavy rain.  The CNE estimates that 1,200 
houses have been affected.  In addition, seven bridges, thirty two 
sections of roads, one potable water system, and three dikes have 
been affected.  The Turrialba road is the only road open that 
connects San Jose with Limon.  This road is being used for emergency 
purposes only. 
 
¶3. The Ambassador's Authority of $50,000 will be used to cover the 
costs of local transport and procurement of emergency supplies to 
the CNE.  The CNE is requesting assistance from the Chief of Mission 
to provide air support to transport medical personnel and medical 
supplies to the affected area until the flood waters subside and 
more roads are open.  In addition, the following relief supplies are 
being requested based on humanitarian gaps identified by the 
USAID/OFDA assessment team on the ground. 
 
100 Boxes of Plastic Sheeting 
5,000 Hygiene Kits 
5,000 Blankets 
5,000 Water Containers 
12 Chain Saws 
 
The relief assistance is likely to be channeled through the National 
Emergency commission and the Costa Rica Red Cross. 
 
¶4. President Arias has declared the affected area a disaster zone as 
a direct result of the floods. CNE Director Mr. Daniel Gallardo, has 
expressed GOCR appreciation and willingness to accept assistance. 
 
¶5. Additional funds and relief supplies may be requested based on 
humanitarian gaps identified by the USAID/OFDA assessment team on 
the ground.  Relief assistance is likely to be channeled through the 
National Emergency Commission and the Costa Rica Red Cross.
