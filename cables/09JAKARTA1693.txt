SUBJECT: PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESPERSON ON COMPREHENSIVE PARTNERSHIP AT 
USINDO CONFERENCE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Presidential advisor and Spokesperson for 
International Affairs Dino Patti Djalal described U.S.-Indonesian 
relations as "at an interesting place" in public remarks delivered 
at a lunch hosted by USINDO on the Comprehensive Partnership on 
October 6th.  He described the recent increased alignment of 
interests between the U.S. and Indonesia as "unprecedented" and 
called for an open-minded, long-term approach toward crafting the 
proposed Comprehensive Partnership.  Djalal posited a direct 
correlation between the quality of the Partnership and the 
willingness of officials on both sides to ask "honest, hard 
questions" and adopt a long-term vision in answering them.  End 
Summary. 
 
Finding the "Soul" of the Relationship 
-------------------------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) Djalal contended that the U.S. and Indonesia need to find 
the "soul" of their bilateral relationship in order to craft a 
partnership relevant to one another.  He said that the past few 
years have brought about a degree of convergence and confluence 
among U.S. and Indonesian policy interests on a number of issues, 
including terrorism, human rights and climate change.  Now, he 
added, the United States and Indonesia have the chance to change the 
world together.  The challenge, therefore, is not to develop a 
Comprehensive Partnership that describes where we are today, but 
rather one that projects where we want to be together in ten years. 
 
 
Health Issues an Area for Cooperation 
-------------------------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) Djalal cited the health sector as an example of where the 
U.S. and Indonesia could further develop cooperation.  He said we 
now have a chance to get beyond an issue that has been burdened with 
nationalism and conspiracy theories and move to a new level where 
debates over NAMRU and avian influenza are behind us. 
 
On Kopassus: "Get Over It" 
------------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) Djalal encouraged both sides to overcome stereotypes in 
order to understand one another.  He explained that on the 
Indonesian side, many foreign affairs professionals harbor the 
mistaken belief that the U.S. seeks the dissolution of Indonesia as 
a single nation.  On the U.S. side, he emphasized the importance of 
understanding Indonesia's desire for a partnership between equals 
and affirmed that his country would never compromise its 
independence.  He said both sides needed to understand each others' 
political realities.  For example, he hoped that U.S. officials 
would understand that Kopassus - Indonesian Army Special Forces- is 
a reformed institution ("Prabowo doesn't run it anymore," he 
quipped, referring to the former Kopassus commander and one-time 
Vice Presidential candidate who is widely accused of involvement in 
human rights violations.)  Djalal urged the U.S. to move forward 
with training for soldiers in Kopassus. 
 
Let's Get To Work 
----------------- 
¶5.  (SBU) Djalal's remarks were upbeat and positive;   however he 
did warn that failing to ask the hard questions could mean that "We 
won't get a great partnership, and maybe not even a good one." 
While his comments offered little in terms of new, substantive 
ideas, Djalal reaffirmed Indonesian commitment to developing a 
Comprehensive Partnership.  His speech also signaled key themes 
important to the Indonesian side: partners as equals, a long-term 
outlook, and a sense mutual understanding.
