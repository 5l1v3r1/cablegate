¶2.  Scheide expressed appreciation for our clarification of 
the key elements of UNSCR 1737.  Regarding Aerospace 
Industries Organization (AIO), Scheide said a decision to 
list would have to come at the EU level, not at the member 
state level.  However, he acknowledged the need for vigilence 
concerning dealings with AIO.
