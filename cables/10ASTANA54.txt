¶3.  (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF LETTER: 
 
Astana, December 15, 2009 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
It gives me a great pleasure to extend my highest consideration and 
best regards to you on behalf of the Parliament of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. 
 
I am following with keen interest your activities as United States 
Special Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan and wish you success in 
bringing stability in that region. 
 
As you are well aware, next year Kazakhstan will assume the 
presidency in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. It's a huge privilege and great responsibility for my 
country since Kazakhstan is the first among CIS member-states, also 
Asian countries and the Muslim world, to lead this huge 
Organization. 
 
In its new capacity Kazakhstan will remain strongly committed to the 
principles and objectives of the OSCE that we have always been 
adhering to.  At the same time we are of a view that it is extremely 
important to enhance OSCE involvement in the Eurasian security 
architecture.  There can be no doubt that the regional stability and 
fight against terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking, organized 
crime and trafficking in human beings will gain full support of all 
the OSCE countries and our Asian and Mediterranean Partners. 
 
To continue full-pledged assistance to Afghanistan in its economic 
reconstruction in close cooperation with local authorities and 
international community is a matter of primary importance for 
Kazakhstan. 
 
Engagement of OSCE will become an additional and efficient way to 
coordinate the joint efforts to ensure security and stability in 
Afghanistan. Thus during its Presidency of the OSCE, Kazakhstan is 
determined to make sure that every effort is undertaken to 
respectively respond to those challenges. 
 
In light of Kazakhstan's OSCE Chairmanship in 2010, our Parliament 
in cooperation with the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly will host in 
Almaty on 14-15 May 2010 the Second Trans-Asian Parliamentary Forum 
entitled "The OSCE Eurasian Dimension." 
 
Parliamentary delegations from the OSCE participating States, Asian 
and Mediterranean Partner countries, including Afghanistan, and also 
parliamentarians from China, India and Pakistan are invited to this 
conference to discuss pressing issues on regional security, economic 
and environmental developments as well as human dimension. 
 
Taking into consideration your rich experience as a prominent 
politician and expert on Eurasian affairs who has a view and 
understanding of various regional security aspects, I have the honor 
to invite you to participate in this forum as a keynote speaker. 
 
I am confident that your presentation and analyses will be of great 
interest for the delegations of the parliamentary conference and 
contribute to the lively discussion on regional issues. 
 
ASTANA 00000054  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
Please be advised that your travel by business-class flight and 
accommodation expenses will be borne by the Kazakh Parliament. 
 
I look forward to welcoming you in Almaty next May. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.
