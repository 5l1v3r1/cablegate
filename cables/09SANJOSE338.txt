SUBJECT: COSTA RICAN AIRPORTS: NO EVIDENCE OF A 
DISCRIMINATORY BIDDING PROCESS 
 
REF: STATE 34118 
 
¶1.  Post confirms that there is no discernible evidence of 
discrimination confronting U.S. suppliers or bidders 
regarding airport construction projects.  Currently, the GOCR 
is working with the Airport Development Corporation/Houston 
Airport Systems (ADC/HAS), an American, Canadian, and 
Brazilian airport operator consortium and the bidder for the 
management and development rights for San Jose's 
international airport.  If successful, then the airport's 
management and development rights would transfer from the 
current operator -- Alterra -- to ADC/HAS. 
 
¶2.  The ADC/HAS consortium consists of three entities: 
 
-- A subsidiary of Houston Airport Systems (HAS) of Houston, 
Texas (for finance, operations, and development); 
 
-- Airport Development Corporation (ADC) Management of 
Toronto, Canada (for management); and 
 
-- Andrade Gutierrez Concesiones of Belo Horizonte, Brazil 
(for concession management/construction). 
 
¶3.  In addition to the bid for San Jose's international 
airport, ADC/HAS won the rights for the management and 
development of Costa Rica's only other international airport 
located in Liberia, a gateway to popular resort destinations 
in northwest Costa Rica. 
 
¶4.  If the ADC/HAS bid fails, Post will report on any 
possibility of discriminatory practices on the part of the 
GOCR.
