SUBJECT:  Juba: UNMIS Driver Seriously Injured by UXO 
 
¶1.  On August 8, an UNMIS driver from Bangladesh was injured when he 
stepped on a grenade that UNDSS believes remained from the war.  The 
site of the accident was an open field directly across the road from 
the John Garang grave site and memorial, just a few hundred yards 
from the seat of the Government of Southern Sudan.  The field had 
been used as parking for SPLA soldiers that were living in a nearby 
encampment.  It also served as parking for the frequent events at 
the memorial.  No previous injuries from unexploded ordinance (UXO) 
had occurred in the area. 
 
¶2.  The UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) officer 
investigating the incident reports that the car was parked about 10 
yards off the road, and that the grenade was less than a foot from 
the right rear tire.  The driver stepped on the grenade while he was 
waiting by the car and was blown backward.  The explosion also 
flattened both tires of the car, a Nissan Patrol, and blew out the 
right-rear window.  The Bangladeshi driver will survive, but both of 
his legs have been amputated and he may lose his left arm.  The car 
remained at the site as a Joint Integrated Unit (JIU) demining team 
cleared the area. 
 
¶3.  The UNDSS officer wondered why neither the SPLA nor any of the 
demining agencies had identified this site as potentially dangerous 
considering it was home to a large Sudanese Armed Forces encampment 
during the war.  Other sources note that the area was once cordoned 
off, but that locals had removed the barriers and markers so they 
could use the land.  The UNDSS officer said that a quick visual 
inspection of the area during his investigation revealed several 
other UXOs.  He was also surprised that no one had been previously 
hurt in the field, considering its level of use.  He commented that 
this shows how dangerous an environment Southern Sudan can be and 
said it was a good reminder why they caution people to not stray too 
far off the road.
