¶1. (SBU) Emiratis have been slow to comment on the November 5 
announcement of Saddam's verdict and sentencing.  One Dutch 
diplomat summed up his extensive efforts to glean UAE views 
on the verdict as "justice is justice," with few Emiratis 
offering explanatory comment.  An Emirati academic told 
PolChief that people here had little reaction to the verdict 
itself, which was consistent with the actions of Saddam. 
However, he had heard many people talking about the potential 
political implications of the trial process and the 
coincidence of the verdict with U.S. elections (noting that 
all sides would/could use the verdict to their own political 
ends).  At an evening gathering involving dozens of senior 
Emirati businessmen and UAE officials on November 7, 
Ambassador noted that no one brought up either Saddam or the 
verdict--a further indication of the importance of the issue 
in the UAE. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The announcement of Saddam's sentencing produced 
little public reaction in either the Arabic or English press, 
and no reaction at all by the UAEG.  On November 6, although 
all major dailies carried headlines of Saddam's sentence, 
only the Arabic-language dailies "Al-Khaleej" and "Al-Bayan" 
ran editorials on the announcement finding the sentence "not 
surprising" and "a remarkable station in the history of 
Iraq," respectively.  The "Al-Khaleej" piece went on to note 
that the strife in Iraq today "is larger than Saddam's 
destiny,"  and called for re-unification and a commitment 
from all sides to place Iraq "on the right track." 
 
¶3. (SBU) On November 7, most dailies reported news of 
Saddam's defense appeal on the front-page, but the articles 
were short (less than six inches), and often ran below the 
fold.  Only the English-language "Gulf News" ran an 
additional Op-Ed piece on the verdict--a harsh criticism of 
suspected U.S. involvement in the outcome (written by a 
British journalist.)  The UAEG's official Emirates News 
Agency (WAM) remained completely silent on the announcement 
with no mention of either Saddam or his trial anyplace on its 
website.
