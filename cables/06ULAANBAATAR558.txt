¶1.  (SBU) On July 20, E/P Chief called MFA Multilateral 
Relations Director General Enkhtsetseg to ask whether 
the July 3 announcement of the establishment of formal 
diplomatic relations between Mongolia and Guatemala had 
resulted in any movement in Mongolia's decision on this 
year's UNSC vote.  (Note: MFA has told us previously it 
intended to tie agreement to establish diplomatic 
relations to conclusion of an agreement for mutual 
support in elections in international organizations. 
Effectively, this is Mongolia's effort to win 
Guatemala's promise to vote for Mongolia in a tough 
2008 UNSC election contest versus Iran, in exchange for 
Mongolia's vote this year.  End note.)  Enkhtsetseg 
replied that the ball remains in Guatemala's court on 
the mutual support agreement, failing which Mongolia 
would decide how to vote in August as part of its 
general pre-UNGA review. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During a July 20 meeting, DCM noted to the 
Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Advisor, Davaasuren, 
and MFA Director General for the Americas, Middle East 
and Africa Jambaldorj that the U.S. continued to hope 
Mongolia will declare its support for Guatemala.  He 
noted, for instance, that Secretary Rice would likely 
raise the subject with Foreign Minister Enkhbold, 
should schedules permit a brief pull aside on the 
margins of the ARF meeting in Kuala Lumpur, as Mongolia 
had requested. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  Clearly, Guatemala has not told 
Mongolia it has already pledged to support Iran in 
2008, and therefore does not feel it can "oversell" its 
vote by making a conflicting promise to the Mongolians 
(ref a).  We remain optimistic that the Mongolians will 
opt to vote for Guatemala but, while waiting for a 
"yes" answer on support in 2008 which will never come 
from the Guatemalans, MFA may not declare its position 
much before the UNSC vote is held this fall.
