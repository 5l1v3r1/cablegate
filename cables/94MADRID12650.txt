SUBJECT: 1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT - SPAIN 
 
REF:  STATE 286744 
 
¶1.  THE TERRORIST SITUATION IN SPAIN IS NOT MARKEDLY 
DIFFERENT FROM THAT DESCRIBED IN "PATTERNS OF GLOBAL 
TERRORISM - 1993".  EMBASSY PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING FOR 
INCLUSION IN THE 1994 TERRORISM REPORT, REQUESTED REFTEL: 
 
¶2.  DURING 1994 SPANISH AND FRENCH AUTHORITIES ENJOYED 
CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS AGAINST THE BASQUE FATHERLAND AND 
LIBERTY (ETA) TERRORIST GROUP.  SEVERAL IMPORTANT ARRESTS 
WERE MADE, INCLUDING THAT OF THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF ETA'S 
MILITARY WING.  SIGNIFICANT CACHES OF WEAPONS AND RECORDS 
IN FRANCE, INCLUDING A COMPUTER HARD-DISK OF BANK ACCOUNTS 
AND PHONE NUMBERS, WERE ALSO SEIZED.  NEVERTHELESS, ETA 
REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST THREAT IN SPAIN.  ON JULY 
29 THE THIRD RANKING OFFICIAL IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL FRANCISCO VEGUILLAS, WAS KILLED BY A CAR 
BOMB IN DOWNTOWN MADRID.  DESPITE ITS PROGRESS IN 
NEUTRALIZING ETA, THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR RECOGNIZES THAT 
A SIGNIFICANT COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORT MUST BE SUSTAINED. 
THE LEFTIST GRAPO TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY INSIGNIFICANT.  IN 1994 GRAPO'S OPERATIONS 
WERE LIMITED TO OCCASIONAL ROBBERIES AND SMALL SCALE 
BOMBINGS.
