SUBJECT: BULGARIA'S RESPONSE TO THE INDEPENDENT INQUIRY 
COMMITTEE FINDINGS 
 
Ref:  STATE 40595 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, we are submitting information on the 
actions of the Bulgarian government as a result of the 
information discovered by the Independent Inquiry Committee 
(IIC). 
 
¶2. (U) In response to the release of the USG's "Duelfer 
Report," the 39th Parliamentary Assembly of Bulgaria (2001- 
2005) established a temporary Parliamentary committee on 
February 25, 2004.  The committee was charged with 
collecting and examining information relating to allegations 
of illicit financing of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) 
by the Iraqi government through the Oil-for-Food program. 
The Committee was comprised of 17 Members of Parliament and 
led by Borislav Ralchev from the National Movement Simeon 
Second (NMSS).  While the committee was initially supposed 
to exist only for a month, its activities continued for 15 
months, and the number of its members grew from 17 to 21 MPs 
due to the size and complexity of the work.  The Bulgarian 
government decided that, given the work and findings of the 
Committee, there was no need to open a wider investigation 
when the U.N.'s IIC report was subsequently released. 
 
¶3. (U) During the course of its work, the Committee obtained 
extensive documentation from various official and unofficial 
institutions, and conducted interviews with 14 officials. 
It issued its final report on May 17, 2005, and confirmed 
that four Bulgarian companies had participated in the Oil- 
for-Food program, but found no legal justification for 
pursuing charges against them "simply because they were 
involved in the program."  To date, the Bulgarian government 
has taken no legal actions against the named companies.  The 
report determined that BSP was registered as a beneficiary 
of oil vouchers on the lists of the Iraqi oil company SOMO, 
but found no evidence that BSP was financed by the regime of 
Saddam Hussein through the Oil-for-Food program. 
 
¶4. (SBU) At the Bulgarians request, we provided a 
substantial number of source documents from the Duelfer 
report, but these failed to shed any additional light on the 
specific transactions of BSP related to the Oil-for-Food 
program.
