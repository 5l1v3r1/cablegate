¶1. (SBU) On August 26, 2007 the Afghan Ministry of Energy and Water 
(MEW) sent a letter to USAID officially allocating a suitable site 
for the 100 MW Power Plant for Kabul.  The site, designated landsite 
number #1130, (previously internally referenced as the "8/20" site 
as it was identified on August 20) is larger than previously 
proposed sites and close to existing power lines.  Official title to 
the land is "in the works." 
 
¶2. (SBU) As explained to USAID officials, a Ministry of Urban 
Development (MUD) committee must meet to approve the allocation of 
land to the project, determine that the allocation is for the good 
of the nation, and thereby nullify any physical claims on the land. 
Should landowners present themselves, the IRoA is then responsible 
for compensating them.  The minutes of the relevant MUD meeting have 
been published in Dari and shown to EmbOffs.  An English translation 
is pending.  The land issue now appears to be closed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The MEW has appointed a project liaison officer within the 
Ministry to work with contractor LBG/BVI.  The ministry also 
encouraged the contractor to begin moving equipment to the site. 
With this move, official police protection can be arranged for the 
project site.  Based on the Ministry's suggestions, LBG/BVI has 
begun site preparation work.  The government began site survey work 
September 18.  The survey is expected to be completed by COB 
September 19.  Once this work is complete, the contractor can begin 
de-mining and erecting a perimeter fence. This preparation work is 
expected to take three weeks to one month to complete. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Despite the various difficulties the 100 MW Power Plant has 
encountered over the past year (reftels) the project appears to be 
only one week behind schedule.  Adjustments may be possible once the 
site has been prepared and the contractor can review/revise work 
schedules and project officers expect to be able to make up the 
time.  All three gensets have been ordered by the contractor and the 
first 67 MW of power from the plant (the first two gensets) is 
expected to begin flowing into the Kabul grid in January 2009.
