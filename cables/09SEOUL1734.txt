(SBU) Deputy Economic Counselor accompanied by Richard Cowin, 
Poloff from the British Embassy, met with Director Yeo 
Sung-Jun, Middle East Division I of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade on October 28 to deliver reftel demarche 
and nonpaper.  Director Yeo said the Republic of Korea takes 
seriously its international obligations with regard to Iran. 
Although he was not aware of any Korean companies providing 
insurance services to Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines 
(IRISL), Song said he appreciated being apprised of the risk 
that IRISL would seek new insurers following the UK's October 
12 ban.  He offered to share this information among the ROKG 
ministries and with Korean insurers as appropriate.  North 
America Division I First Secretary Song Si-jin and Middle 
East Division 1 Second Secretary Choi Young-joon were also 
present.
