¶1.  (SBU) In response to Blue Lantern post-shipment check on 
license 050117142, International Spares Services (ISS) GmbH 
Business Director, Albrecht Schwecht, confirmed to EconOff 
that the International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled 
tachometers purchased from MPS Logistics, Inc. are for the 
German Navy and not/not for the German Air Force. 
Specifically, Schwecht said the tachometers  will be used in 
the Westland Sea Lynx MK88/MK88A, operated by the German Navy. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Schwecht was very helpful and promptly responded to 
all inquiries regarding this case.  It appears to us that the 
end-use statement designating the German Air Force as the 
operator was in error and should have read "operated by the 
German Navy."
