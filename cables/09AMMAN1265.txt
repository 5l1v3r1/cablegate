Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Deputy Americas Director 
Samer Naber at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on June 3. 
Naber indicated Jordan's interest in attending the Oslo 
meeting.  Naber said that Jordan would be "very supportive" 
of efforts to solicit further aid for the PA and encourage 
donors to honor their pledges.  He noted that the King 
encountered "negativity" on this topic during recent visits 
to Arab states.  The leaders of several Gulf states 
reportedly told the King they had no plans to contribute more 
than the quota amounts agreed to in the Arab League.
