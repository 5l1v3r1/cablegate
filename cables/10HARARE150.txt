SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: CHANGES TO RECIPROCITY SCHEDULE 
 
THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE.  See paras 2 and 5. 
 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Post recommends two changes to the Zimbabwe reciprocity 
schedule as outlined below.  The intent of the changes is to 
streamline visa processing for Zimbabwean government officials not 
subject to Presidential Proclamation 7524, which restricts travel 
of certain individuals to the U.S., and to simplify the visa 
schedule for Zimbabwean crewmembers by creating a combined C-1/D 
visa. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Recommendation 1.  Under Special Clearance and Issues 
Procedures, remove the following requirement:  "A Visas Bear 
telegram must be submitted on all A, C-3, and G (except G-4) visa 
applications from citizens of Zimbabwe." 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) This stringent requirement originates from Presidential 
Proclamation 7524 of February 22, 2002, which restricts travel of 
persons responsible for actions that threaten Zimbabwe's democratic 
institutions and transition to a multi-party democracy.  Although 
the enforcement of this travel restriction has become 
institutionalized in the ensuing eight years, the requirement for 
submitting SAOs for all A and G applications has transitioned from 
a vehicle of enforcement into a significant impediment to visa 
issuance for officials whose travel is in the U.S. interest. 
Today, every Zimbabwe official on the U.S. Treasury Department's 
OFAC list has been entered into CLASS, and Post has entered P212F 
hits for all other Zimbabweans who are the subject of adverse 
information kept at Post.  Of note, the remaining guidance 
contained in the "Special Clearances and Issues Procedures" section 
still requires an SAO (regardless of visa class) for all applicants 
potentially subject to the restriction and for all those with a 
CLASS "00" or "212(f)" match. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The former opposition party, the Movement for Democratic 
Change (MDC), is now part of government, but under current 
procedures we must send SAOs for MDC ministers who wish to travel 
to the U.S.  This has occasionally resulted in hardship for both 
Post and the Department in trying to get approvals when visa 
applications were made late; on at least one occasion an MDC 
minister was unable to travel to the U.S. The lifting of this SAO 
requirement is not meant to signal any decrease in vigilance or 
loosening of Department efforts to enforce the travel restriction. 
Instead, it is aimed at eliminating approximately 100 unnecessary 
SAOs yearly, while allowing the Department to issue timely official 
and diplomatic visas to Zimbabweans whose travel is in the U.S. 
interest. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U) Recommendation 2.  Create a new combined transit and 
crewmember visa (C-1/D) with a validity of 36 months.  Zimbabwean 
crewmembers (cruise ship and airline employees) currently require 
separate transit (C-1) and crewmember (D) visas.  Crewmembers have 
one of our lowest rates of fraud and the current schedule places a 
significant burden on these regular travelers by requiring them to 
renew their D visa every 24 months.  Given the large percentage of 
Zimbabweans working in the hospitality industry, we recommend 
easing the financial and bureaucratic burden on them by creating a 
combined C-1/D visa with a validity period of 36 months.
