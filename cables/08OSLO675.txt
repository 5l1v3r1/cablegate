SUBJECT: NORWAY HESITATES ON PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SECURITY 
FOR AFGHAN ELECTIONS, BUT COULD BE CONVINCED 
 
REF: STATE 131480 
 
¶1. (SBU) The underdirector of the MFA Pakistan/Afghanistan 
section of the Norwegian MFA, and the special advisor on 
Afghanistan in the Ministry of Defense, were unwilling to 
commit at this stage to additional Norwegian military 
elements to provide security for the upcoming Afghan 
elections.  Post believes that the Norwegians understand the 
importance of the elections and might be willing to 
participate with some additional forces, but that this 
decision would require time to analyze and prepare any 
elements which could be offered.  Post also believes that 
unless pushed by Afghan and ISAF officials, the GON will 
avoid any decision on additional contributions, believing 
that their existing efforts are sufficient. 
 
¶2. (U) Norway's Afghanistan commitment is its top 
international commitments, militarily and in humanitarian 
aid.  The GON considers the Afghan election in 2009 to be a 
milestone in the development and consolidation of democracy 
in Afghanistan.  Norway's current support for the elections 
includes: 
 
-- 15 million kroner (approximately 2.5 million dollars) for 
voter registration. 
-- Coordination of joint Nordic efforts in support of the 
elections, including efforts to build capacity among Afghan 
officials, encouraging more awareness on gender equality and 
its role in elections, and working on communication 
initiatives. 
-- Norway's embassy is also actively involved with the Afghan 
government and the UN in planning for the elections.
