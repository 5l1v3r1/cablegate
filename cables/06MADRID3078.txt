¶1. (SBU) The DCM and Embassy officers met with Eugenio 
Pereiro, Director of Spain's "National Center for 
Antiterrorist Coordination" (CNCA) on December 19 to discuss 
a broad range of security cooperation issues.  Much of the 
discussion focused on the establishment of a mechanism to 
share terrorist lookout information on a bilateral basis. 
The DCM discussed the November visit of CA A/S Harty and her 
agreement with Secretary of State for Security Antonio 
Camacho to develop such an information exchange (REFS A and 
B).  The DCM thanked Pereiro for his role in achieving this 
agreement and said that the Embassy was prepared to work 
closely with his team on the technical details of 
implementing the HSPD-6 mechanism.  The DCM emphasized that 
the USG wanted to establish the information exchange on a 
collaborative basis and noted that the Terrorist Screening 
Center (TSC) and other USG entities would be pleased to host 
a visit by CNCA officials to provide additional briefings. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Pereiro thanked the DCM and said that he looked 
forward to working with the USG on the implementation of the 
agreement.  He requested a detailed description of how an 
exchange would actually be carried out so that he could 
assign the appropriate members of his team to oversee this 
project.  Emboffs said that a written proposal would be 
forthcoming very soon that would include the USG's proposed 
protocol.  The DCM noted that we viewed this as a very 
flexible document that was intended to launch the process; 
the final agreement would be a product of the CNCA and 
Embassy working groups assigned to work out the details of 
the exchange.  Embassy officers discussed several of the 
practical aspects of the proposed information exchange and 
some of the issues that would have to be worked out, such as 
specific instructions regarding how Spanish data could be 
employed by the TSC and how the two sides could obtain 
detailed information on a subject in the event of an 
encounter by our authorities.  The DCM and Pereiro agreed to 
attempt to secure an agreement by the end of January and to 
launch the information exchange as soon as possible 
thereafter. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post appreciates the continual information from the 
Department and TSC regarding HSPD-6 implementation.  Pereiro 
clearly understands the potential value of fully implementing 
the Madrid Model, which would give the CNCA a useful tool to 
aid its mission of building up interagency cooperation among 
Spanish security agencies to confront the terrorist threat. 
We would like to make implementation as easy as possible for 
the CNCA, which is a small and relatively new institution, 
but one we would like to see succeed.  Political Officer 
Ricardo Zuniga will serve as the Embassy's operational 
coordinator in terms of negotiating with Spanish counterparts 
the specific protocols that will govern this information 
exchange.  The full Embassy Working Group includes Consular, 
Legat, and ORA representatives.  The Ambassador and the DCM 
will cintinue to engage on a policy level to assure that this 
initiative moves forward in the most expeditious manner 
possible.
