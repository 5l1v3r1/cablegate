REF: STATE 83239 
 
¶1. (SBU) Senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials have 
been completely tied up with the visit of UN Secretary 
General Kofi Annan, so Poloff delivered reftel demarche 
January 20 to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arms 
Control Expert Vu Van Mien.  Mien is responsible for 
drafting the papers on Iran for Foreign Minister Nguyen Dzy 
Nien's use at the upcoming NAM Ministerial in Kuala Lumpur. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mien made two points: Vietnam's policy on opposing 
proliferation of nuclear weapons has not changed, but the 
United States should be careful in how it describes the 
IAEA's conclusions.  True, Mien said, the IAEA has 
documented Iran's failure to cooperate, but failure to 
cooperate is a significant step short of concluding that 
Iran is developing a nuclear weapons program. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mien said that he will put the U.S. demarche on FM 
Nien's desk today, and that the United States can expect 
that the GVN will consider its position on Iran carefully. 
Iran has proposed a resolution for consideration by the NAM, 
Mien noted, but the GVN's assessment of Iran's resolution is 
that "its chance of passing is slim."
