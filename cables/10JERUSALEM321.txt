SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/23): The Europeans start to 
take a more active role in the peace process 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------The dailies lead with news on Palestinian Authority 
(PA) President Mahmoud Abbas' meeting with French President Nicolas 
Sarkozy in Paris yesterday. The reports note that both Presidents 
agreed that peace in the region cannot be attained without 
negotiations. Leading headlines in Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
quote Sarkozy noting that he agreed with Abbas on goodwill gestures 
to support pushing the peace process forward. Abbas is quoted in 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's headline stating that negotiations come first 
and then a declaration of the state. Abbas and Sarkozy noted that 
the two state solution is the best mechanism to ensure a Palestinian 
state that lives side by side with Israel in peace and security. 
Al-Quds runs a headline quoting Sarkozy warning of a third intifada 
in the Palestinian territories if the situation doesn't improve. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page news on an article published by the French 
newspaper Le Monde reporting that both the French and Spanish 
Foreign Ministers stated that Europe must bear some responsibilities 
for the peace efforts (in addition to the US) and must set a clear 
timeframe for resuming negotiations. Both Ministers also suggested 
that the EU hold a peace summit. 
 
The dailies continue to report on the Palestinian condemnation of 
the Israeli decision to add two holy sites in the West Bank to a 
list of national heritage sites within its "Plan to Rehabilitate and 
Strengthen Israel's National Heritage Infrastructure." Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida reports that the PA cabinet condemned the Israeli 
announcement during its weekly meeting yesterday. Reports note that 
a number of Palestinians protesting the decision in Hebron were 
injured yesterday during confrontations. 
Reports note that one Israeli soldier was injured during the 
confrontations. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam report that Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton called President Abbas yesterday to reiterate the US 
commitment to reach a fair solution to the Palestinian cause through 
negotiations which will lead to 2 states living side by side in 
peace and security. 
 
The Palestinian press reports that the European Commission allocated 
52 million Euros for immediate humanitarian aid to the Palestinian 
territories.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------Editor-in-Chief of Al-Hayat Al-Jadida Hafeth 
Al-Barghouti opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida today under the title "The 
European Position" that the recent European (Spanish-French) 
initiative to recognize the Palestinian state comes as a response to 
the US retreat from its commitments and pledges. Al-Barghouti 
believes that this initiative is a threat to the US and Israel and 
proof that the Palestinian state can be established even with 
Israeli stubbornness and the US retreat
