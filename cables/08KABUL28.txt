SUBJECT:  Afghanistan Aids Pakistanis Fleeing Kurram Violence 
 
¶1. (U) Afghan media reported January 2 that President Karzai had 
ordered an inter-ministerial humanitarian needs assessment in 
anticipation of more Pakistani refugees fleeing Sunni-Shia fighting 
in Kurram Agency.  The Minister of Refugees and Repatriation is 
leading an assessment team to the Terzai/Ali Sher, Bak and Jaji 
Maidan districts of Khost province and to Jaji Aryoub and 
Dand-wa-Patan districts in Paktia province.  The Paktia Department 
of Refugees and Repatriation has already provided shelter and 
blankets to 111 Pakistani refugee families.  Paktia's governor 
estimates 1000 families may cross the border from Pakistan into his 
province alone.  Among these are likely to be Afghan families who, 
years ago, fled war in their home country and settled among tribal 
kinsmen in Pakistan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan 
(UNAMA) and the Kabul office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) have dispatched a joint assessment team to the 
affected areas.  Both agencies are concerned harsh winter conditions 
and high refugee volumes will strain Afghan central and provincial 
humanitarian assistance capabilities; however, many of the Pakistani 
refugees are likely to be absorbed by tribal relatives on the 
Afghanistan side of the porous border. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  An Afghan government providing assistance to 
Pakistani refugees is a dramatic reversal of the pattern that has 
prevailed for most of the last thirty years.  The government's 
prompt response to a developing humanitarian crisis suggests the 
nascent professionalism and growing capability of Afghan government 
emergency response agencies.
