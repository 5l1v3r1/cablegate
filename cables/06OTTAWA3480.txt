SUBJECT: CANADA APPLAUDS WTO RULING ON GMO IMPORTS 
 
¶1. (U) On November 22, Canadian Agriculture Minister Chuck 
Strahl and International Trade Minister David Emerson 
welcomed the WTO's adoption of a ruling against the European 
Union's (EU) treatment of imports of genetically modified 
organisms (GMOs).  Emerson said that "the (Canadian) 
government has long argued that there was no scientific basis 
for the EU to delay GMO imports, which created an unjustified 
barrier to trade.  This ruling will enable Canadian producers 
to access European markets and effectively market their 
products."  Stahl described the ruling as a "big win" for 
Canada's agricultural industry, particularly the 
biotechnology sector.  He said that "Canadian developers, 
producers, processors and exporters are at the forefront of 
the industry, and can now export their innovative 
technologies and products to European markets." 
 
¶2. (U) Canada had argued to the WTO panel that the EU had 
imposed an unjustified moratorium on the approval of 
biotechnology products between June 1999 and August 2003, 
which amounted to an effective ban on the import of these 
products.  The GoC sees this as a timely victory as the 
demand for oilseeds in Europe is growing as a result of EU 
policy to promote the use of bio-diesel.  The WTO decision 
has the potential to significantly benefit Canadian 
producers, who grow a number of grain and oilseed varieties 
that were not approved under the EU's GMO moratorium.
