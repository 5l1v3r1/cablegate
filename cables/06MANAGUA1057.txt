¶1. (SBU) Summary: The deadline to register political 
alliances for Nicaragua's national elections in November came 
and went on May 11 without a deal to unite the Liberal 
Constitutional Party (PLC) and the Nicaraguan Liberal 
Alliance (ALN).  The big surprise of the day was APRE's 
decision to break negotiations with the PLC and join the 
ALN's alliance, while APRE's presidential candidate, Jose 
Antonio Alvarado, remained in the PLC fold.  Previously, a 
large segment of Yatama renounced Brooklyn Rivera's decision 
to join with the FSLN and instead signed an alliance with the 
ALN, and the Alternativa Cristiana (AC) deserted Sandinista 
dissident Herty Lewites' group to register independently. 
Ultimately, five groups registered with the Supreme Electoral 
Council (CSE) to compete in the national elections: the PLC, 
FSLN, ALN, MRS (Lewites' alliance), and the AC.  End Summary. 
 
APRE SPLITS WITH ALVARADO TO JOIN ALN 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2. (SBU) The rifts between the "Amigos de Alvarado" and the 
Alliance for the Republic (APRE), the party that had 
nominated Jose Antonio Alvarado as its presidential 
candidate, came to a head on May 11 when APRE split with 
Alvarado to join an alliance with the ALN.  APRE leaders, led 
by party president Miguel Lopez Baldizon became increasingly 
frustrated with Alvarado's flirtation with PLC leader Arnoldo 
Aleman and lack of coordination in negotiations with the APRE 
directorship.  Alvarado was likewise angered when APRE 
refused to include Ariel Granera and other close advisors in 
its list of departmental deputies to negotiate with the 
Liberal alliances.  As a result, Alvarado signed on with the 
PLC in his "personal capacity" and with expectations for the 
PLC vice presidential nomination, and Lopez Baldizon signed a 
last-minute alliance with the ALN at 7:00 p.m. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: The reasons for the APRE/Alvarado split are 
legion.  Lopez Baldizon feels, with some justification, that 
Alvarado usurped APRE to further his personal ambitions.  He 
was also uncomfortable with the PLC's insistence that the 
APRE National Assembly deputies (Lopez Baldizon and Assembly 
president Eduardo Gomez) sign a letter supporting amnesty for 
Aleman.  Poloffs kept in frequent touch with Lopez Baldizon 
on May 10 and 11 to remind him that Alvarado's stock has 
fallen precipitously since his public rapprochement with 
Aleman and that he would do better to negotiate a separate 
deal with Montealegre.  Polcouns especially worked the phones 
on May 11 to "herd the cats" and encourage APRE to commit to 
the ALN.  End Comment. 
 
¶4. (C) At around 4:00 p.m. on May 11, Eduardo Montealegre 
registered his Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance with the Supreme 
Electoral Council.  During a May 8 meeting with poloffs, 
Montealegre advisors Edmundo Leal and Pepe Matus explained 
that the alliance would register as "ALN" and not "ALN-PC" 
(Conservative Party) to avoid alienating Liberal and 
Resistance voters.  In addition to APRE, the parties with a 
legal inscription (personeria jurdica) that registered with 
the ALN are the Conservative Party (PC), Nicaraguan 
Resistance Party (PRN), and the Liberal Independent Party 
(PLI).  Montealegre did not announce his vice presidential 
running mate, but Leal and Matus reported to poloffs that 
Conservative Cristiana Chamorro is the likely choice, if she 
accepts. 
 
YATAMA LEADERS BREAK WITH RIVERA TO JOIN MONTEALEGRE

¶5. (C) A Yatama splinter group, led by Yatama Board of 
Directors President Adolfo Smith and Yatama Resistance leader 
Osorno Coleman ("Comandante Blas"), signed a political 
alliance with the ALN on May 10.  Also joining the accord was 
PAMUC leader Mario Cordoba.  Smith lambasted 
rival/pro-Sandinista Yatama leader Brooklyn Rivera for having 
made a "personal decision" to ally with Daniel Ortega, and 
announced that Yatama will hold a special assembly on May 
13-14 to condemn Rivera,s actions.  Coleman stated that the 
Miskitos will soon file a suit against Daniel Ortega and a 
number of his inner circle for crimes against humanity 
committed against the Miskitos during the Sandinista regime. 
(Comment: Embassy has encouraged both Smith/Coleman and 
Montealegre,s advisors to negotiate an alliance to break 
 
Ortega,s influence over Yatama.  Also, Coleman is one of the 
Embassy's main contacts for CPDH,s project to reveal 
Sandinista Era abuses against the Miskito population.  End 
Comment.) 
 
PLC LEFT WITH CAMINO CRISTIANO AND MICROPARTIES 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6. (SBU) Despite the public displays of camaraderie between 
PLC presidential candidate Jose Rizo and Jose Antonio 
Alvarado, the defection of APRE to the ALN took the wind out 
of the PLC's sails.  Alvarado continued to repeat his mantra 
of "Liberal unity," disregarding the evident failure of the 
PLC and ALN to reach an accord, and commented that his 
friends in APRE would follow him to the PLC.  The 
always-petulant Maria Dolores Aleman (Arnoldo's oldest 
daughter and PLC Assembly deputy) complained that the Embassy 
had pressured Alvarado to desert the PLC and pledged that the 
party would work "tooth and nail" to win the elections.  The 
only legally inscribed parties left with the PLC are the 
Camino Cristiano (those that did not leave with Delia 
Arellano to join Montealegre -- see ref B) and the tiny 
Multiethnic Indigenous Party (PIM). 
 
FSLN REGISTERS EARLY 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7. (U) The FSLN was the first party to inscribe its electoral 
alliance with the CSE.  On May 8, FSLN leader Daniel Ortega 
formally registered the alliance under the name "Nicaragua 
Triumphs" ("Nicaragua Triunfa").  Ortega announced that the 
alliance would announce the nomination of its vice 
presidential candidate on May 28.  A number of small parties 
registered under the alliance including, notably, Yatama, the 
principal party representing the indigenous peoples of the 
Atlantic Coast.  Splinter groups of Liberals, Conservatives, 
evangelicals, and Resistance (ex-contras) also joined the 
alliance. 
 
THE "TIGER" IS READY TO FIGHT 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶8. (SBU) Sandinista dissident Herty Lewites registered his 
Movement to Rescue Sandinismo (MRS) alliance on May 10, 
quipping that he, the "tiger" (he sometimes calls himself the 
"Jewish Tiger," in memory of his Jewish father), is now ready 
to "hunt ducks (Rizo), rats (Montealegre), and roosters 
(Ortega)" -- referring to the animal caricatures popularly 
associated with those candidates.  Despite rumors that 
Lewites, health has deteriorated, according to most reports, 
he appeared to be his spry, energetic self during Costa Rican 
President Arias, inauguration.  According to Montealegre, 
who was on the same turbulent return flight home, Lewites 
half joked that they should not fly together, because if the 
plane were to go down with the two of them aboard, Nicaragua 
would loose its chance to reform. 
 
¶9. (U) Lewites ran into trouble at the last minute when the 
CSE insisted that the MRS had to formally dissolve its 
previous alliance with Alternativa Cristiana (AC) in order to 
inscribe its new alliance.  Lewites frantically called MRS 
president Dora Maria Tellez and AC leader Orlando Tardencilla 
to sign the dissolution documents at the CSE on May 11. 
 
ALTERNATIVA CRISTIANA ENTERS THE FRAY ALONE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶10. (U) Orlando Tardencilla's Alternativa Cristiana (AC) 
decided to register independently after a public break with 
Lewites over campaign strategy following the March 5 regional 
Atlantic Coast elections.  AC chose flamboyant former 
Sandinista and Contra commander Eden Pastora as its 
candidate.  (Note: Pastora was the Managua mayoral candidate 
for the PLI in the 2004 municipal elections and won less than 
five percent of the vote.  The Nicaraguan public now seems to 
view him more as a wacky celebrity than a leader.  End Note.) 
 
COMMENT: ALVARADO'S STAR HAS FALLEN 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶11. (C) After emerging a year ago as a prominent "Third Way" 
Liberal candidate, Jose Antonio Alvarado has finally -- 
following innumerable meetings with all Liberal factions -- 
decided to return to the PLC fold.  Montealegre, though 
frustrated with Alvarado's incessant bed hopping, was open to 
a deal until the end, but ultimately was unwilling to sweeten 
 
the pot enough to entice Alvarado away from the PLC.  The 
loss to Montealegre may not be great, however, as Alvarado's 
poll numbers have slipped from around five percent to less 
than one percent following his rapprochement with the PLC. 
At this point, many anti-pact voters appear to be fed up with 
Alvarado, who would probably prove more a liability to 
Montealegre's campaign than an asset.
