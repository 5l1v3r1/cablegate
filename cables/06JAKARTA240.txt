2005 
 
¶1. Summary. Indonesian financial markets reacted favorably 
to a December 6, 2005 cabinet reshuffle, with the rupiah 
gaining two percent through the end of December to close at 
9,840/USD.  The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index also 
rose six percent after the reshuffle to close at 1,162 on 
December 29.  Indonesia's year-on-year (YoY) consumer price 
inflation rate fell in December 2005 for the first time in 
seven months after state oil company Pertamina cut fuel 
costs and food prices stabilized.  Indonesia's non-oil and 
gas exports increased 18.3 percent in the first eleven 
months of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004, with 
machinery/electrical tools, fats and palm oils, and coal as 
leading export categories.  As part of its debt re-profiling 
efforts, on December 8 the Government of Indonesia (GOI) 
swapped USD 579 million worth of high yield bonds maturing 
in 2007-9 with bonds maturing in 2020.  The Ministry of 
Trade announced on December 27 that the GOI would extend a 
shrimp import ban initially scheduled to expire on December 
28, 2005.  Coordinating Minister for the Economy Boediono 
agreed on December 21 to implement a five percent tax on all 
coal exports.  State power company PLN signed an MOU with 
Korea's KEPCO on December 13 to conduct a nuclear power 
feasibility study.  On December 16, the Indonesian energy 
firm EMP Kangean signed four gas sales agreements with PLN, 
state oil company Pertamina, state gas company PGN and 
private Indonesian gas supplier Indogas Kriya Dwiguna.  In 
the wake of three rounds of national immunizations, new 
polio cases in Indonesian have fallen from an average of 10 
a month from April to August to an average of two per month 
from October to December.  On December 20, State Minister of 
Environment Rachmat Witoelar announced that the GOI would 
provide USD 11 million in "Special Allocation Funds" (DAK) 
for 330 regencies and cities for environmental programs. 
During the December 12-14 ASEAN Business Forum, President 
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Russian President Vladimir 
Putin agreed to develop a commercial satellite launch 
facility in Biak, Papua.  The Indonesian subsidiary of the 
U.S. company Sara Lee announced on December 19 that it would 
move production of its well-known Kiwi brand shoe polish 
from France to Indonesia to reduce labor costs.  End 
Summary. 
 
Markets Strengthen after Cabinet Reshuffle 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. The Indonesian rupiah strengthened in December following 
a December 5 cabinet reshuffle that included the appointment 
of former Finance Minister Boediono as the new Coordinating 
Minister for the Economy and the promotion of State Minister 
for National Development Planning Sri Mulyani Indrawati to 
the Finance Ministry.  Analysts said the rupiah benefited 
from capital inflows into the bond and stock markets 
following the appointment of the two well-respected 
technocrats.  From December 6-30, the rupiah strengthened by 
2 percent to close at Rp 9,840/USD on December 29. 
Jakarta's benchmark stock index rallied strongly in the wake 
of the reshuffle, rising 6 percent from December to the end 
of the year, closing at 1,162 on December 29. 
 
Inflation Down Slightly In December 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. Indonesia's inflation rate fell in December for the first 
time in seven months after the state oil company Pertamina 
cut fuel costs and food prices stabilized.  The Central 
Bureau of Statistics (BPS) announced on January 2 that 
consumer prices fell 0.04 percent month-on-month (MoM) in 
December, with the YoY increase remaining at a very high 
17.1 percent.  Food prices showed the greatest MoM decline. 
On December 6, Bank Indonesia (BI) raised the target rate 
for the benchmark 1-month SBI by 50 bps to 12.75 percent in 
a move to dampen inflationary pressures.  The hike was 
smaller than many analysts expected, prompting speculation 
that BI may opt for smaller but more frequent rate 
increases.  BI Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah said on 
December 6 that BI would likely maintain a tight monetary 
 
 
policy bias until 2007.

total exports, expanded 12.7 percent YoY to USD 50 billion 
from January through November.  Machinery/electrical tools, 
fats and palm oils, and coal, were Indonesia's top three non- 
oil and gas exports for the period, comprising 11.1, 7.4 and 
6.8 percent respectively.  Japan edged out the United States 
as Indonesia's largest non-oil and gas export destination 
for January-November 2005, followed by Singapore.

Government Swaps High-Yield Bonds 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. On December 12, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) took 
advantage of renewed foreign investor interest in rupiah 
bonds by swapping Rp 5.7 trillion (USD 579 million) of bonds 
maturing in 2007-9 and yielding 10-14 percent into 15-year 
bonds yielding 14.5 percent.  The MOF has been gradually 
reprofiling its bond portfolio since 2002 through buybacks 
and swaps for longer duration bonds.  Twenty eight percent 
of Indonesia's Rp 400 trillion (USD 40 billion) rupiah bond 
portfolio matures between 2007 and 2009.  Under a similar 
program in 2002, the MOF extended by about 10 years the 
maturity of Rp 170 trillion (USD 17 billion) in bonds, a 
third of outstanding domestic government debt at that time. 
Unlike the 2002 reprofiling, done on a bilateral basis with 
mostly state banks, the MOF conducted the December 2005 
through the market. 
 
GOI Extends Shrimp Import Ban 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7. Ministry of Trade (MOT) Director General for 
International Trade Diah Maulida announced on December 27 
that the GOI would extend a shrimp import ban initially 
scheduled to expire on December 28, 2005.  The Ministry 
announced the decision was made following a December 26 
meeting between the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of 
Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) and Marine Affairs and 
stakeholders in Jakarta. on December 26.  The GOI MOT first 
instituted the shrimp import ban on December 28, 2004 to 
prevent contaminated shrimp and shrimp disease from entering 
into Indonesia.  The MOT later renewed the ban was later 
renewed on January 26, 2005  and specifically limited its 
 
 
application to three species of shrimp: frozen and non- 
frozen shrimp of the vaname, monodon, and stylirostris 
species (HS codes 0306.13.00.00, 0306.23, and 
0306.23.30.00).  Press reports suggested that the move was 
part of a GOI government effort to combat rampant shrimp 
transshipments through Indonesia to the United States. 
 
GOI Implements Coal Export Tax 
------------------------------ 
 
¶8. Coordinating Minister for the Economy Boediono agreed on 
December 21 to implement Ministry of Finance Decree 
No.95/2005 on a coal export tax.  Under the decree, the GOI 
will subject all coal exports to a five percent tax (on an 
ad valorem basis) regardless of export price.  Boediono also 
recommended that the MOF implement the coal export tax in 
combination with an accelerated VAT reimbursement program. 
The Indonesian Coal Mining Association (ICMA) expressed 
disappointment with the decision but said that it would not 
influence its 2006 production target of 175 million tons. 
The ICMA foresees continued strong demand next year with 
prices ranging between USD 45 to 50 per ton. 
 
Indonesia's First Nuclear Power Plant? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. State electricity company PLN signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) on December 13 with Korea Electric Power 
Corporation (KEPCO) and Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co. 
(KHNP) to conduct a feasibility study for a nuclear power 
plant in Indonesia.  The study will assess the cost, 
location, licensing and security for a 1000 megawatt nuclear 
plant.  The National Nuclear Energy Agency (BATAN) conducted 
its own feasibility study of nuclear plant sites in 2000- 
2005 and determined possible plant locations near Java's 
five major cities (Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Jogyakarta, 
and Semarang).  Indonesia's National Energy Blueprint calls 
for the inauguration of nuclear power generation by 2017 and 
sets the goal of deriving almost 2 percent of Indonesia's 
energy from nuclear sources by 2025.  Separately, Minister 
of Energy and Mineral Resources Purnomo Yusgiantoro visited 
France earlier in the month to observe operations at the 
Penly nuclear facility. 
 
Gas Supply Contract Signing 
--------------------------- 
 
¶10. EMP Kangean Ltd., a subsidiary of the Indonesian oil and 
gas firm Energi Mega Persada (EMP), signed Gas Sales 
Agreements with PLN, Pertamina, state gas company PGN, and 
the private Indonesian gas supplier PT Indogas Kriya Dwiguna 
on December 16.  The total contract volumes are 642.3 
trillion British Thermal Units (BTU) over a 2 to 16 year 
period with a combined value reportedly worth at least USD 
1.9 billion.  EMP Kangean Ltd. Operates the Kangean block 
offshore East Java.  Once at full production in late 2007, 
the block will supply the East Java market, including PLN's 
Gresik and Grati power plants.

Polio Infection Rates Decline 
----------------------------- 
 
 
¶11.  The incidence of polio infections in Indonesia declined 
noticeably since the first case in April 2005, following 
three rounds of National Immunization Days (NID).  The 
number of new polio cases fell sharply, from an average of 
10 per month in the April-August time period to an average 
of two per month from October to December.  The two new 
cases in December occurred in Tanggamus, Lampung, and 
Sumenep, East Java.  The MOH reported no new cases in West 
Java and Banten provinces, both of which had been the sites 
of significant outbreaks in April and May 2005.  The 
Ministry of Health (MOH) reported in December that there 
were 295 cases of polio from April to December 2005 in 10 
provinces: Banten (161), West Java (59), Lampung (25), 
Central Java (20), North Sumatra (10), South Sumatra (5), 
East Java (5), Jakarta (4), Aceh (3), and Riau (3).  The 
latest onset was on November 10, 2005. 
 
¶12. Many observers consider the third NID on November 30, 
2005 a success since they reached an estimated 98 percent of 
targeted children (those under five years old).  However, 
there were low vaccination rates in the remote provinces of 
Papua (50.3 percent of 144,000 targeted children), West 
Irian (73.8 percent of 65,000), and North Maluku (86.4 
percent of 84,000).   Nonetheless, there have been no 
reports so far of polio cases in these areas.  Minister of 
Health Siti Fadilah Supari explained December 16 that the 
MOH finds it difficult to access these remote areas due to a 
lack of funding for transportation.  The GOI plans to hold 
an immunization mop up on January 30th in the Provinces of 
Banten, East Java, Lampung, North Sumatra, and South 
Sumatra.  In addition, at the WHO's urging, the GOI plans a 
fourth NID for February 27, 2006. A fifth NID has been 
proposed for April 2006, but the MOH has not yet confirmed 
it. 
 
¶13.  President Director of PT Bio Farma Marzuki Abdullah 
said that in line with a World Health Organization (WHO) 
recommendation, the MOH used monovalen vaccines in polio 
endemic areas in the third round.  Endemic areas include the 
island of Java, and Lampung and South Sumatra provinces.  PT 
Bio Farma provided 19.8 million doses of monovalen polio 
vaccines for the third round. 
 
GOI Launches Environment Fund for Regions 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶14. On December 20, State Minister of Environment Rachmat 
Witoelar announced that for the first time, the GOI would 
provide "Special Allocation Funds" (DAK) in the 2006 budget 
to help selected local governments in 30 provinces conserve 
their natural resources and implement environmental 
programs.  Witoelar said the Ministry of Finance would 
allocate a total of Rp 112.5 billion (USD 11.2 million) in 
2006, and would distribute the funds to 330 cities and 
regencies that allocate less that Rp 50 million (USD 5,100) 
each for the environment.  The funds are intended to enhance 
the capacity of cities and regencies to implement 
sustainable development principles. 
 
¶15. Ministry of Environment Executive Secretary Arief Yuwono 
explained that in FY 2006, the MOE would prioritize 
improving river water quality.  Each of the eligible cities 
or regencies would receive between Rp 300 million (USD 
30,000) and Rp 1.7 billion (USD 173,000) for the restoration 
and monitoring of rivers.  Yuwono noted that around 100 
municipalities and three provinces (Jakarta, Riau, and East 
Kalimantan) would not receive any funds since they have 
sufficient funds for environmental management.  Some 
observers stated that they believe the amount of the funds 
is inadequate for rehabilitating the significant percentage 
of Indonesia's rivers considered heavily polluted (as much 
as 89 percent according to one environmental NGO).  The 
environmental funds represent only one percent of the Rp 10 
trillion (USD 1 billion) Special Allocation Funds designated 
for education, agriculture, health, maritime, fisheries, and 
infrastructure construction in FY 2006.  According to press 
 
 
reports, the MOF disbursed the funds on January 2, 2006. 
 
Indonesian-Russian Satellite Launch Facility 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶16.  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Russian 
President Vladimir Putin reportedly agreed to develop a 
satellite and commercial rocket launch services facility in 
Biak, Papua, during a meeting on the margins of the December 
12-14 ASEAN Business Forum in Kuala Lumpur.  The two 
presidents agreed to sign an MOU in January 2006 calling for 
a first satellite launch in 2007 and establishing a joint 
venture to operate the launch facility.  Director of Central 
and East Europe at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hazairin 
Pohan, told the press that Indonesia and Russia plant to 
locate the launch facility at Frans Kaisieppo Airport in 
Biak.  Pohan estimated the project would cost USD 120-130 
million.  During two meetings in 2003, the Indonesian 
National Institute of Aeronautic and Space (LAPAN) and the 
Russian Federal Space Agency (RFSA) agreed to accelerate 
technology cooperation and signed a Memorandum of Intent for 
technology cooperation. 
 
LAPAN is inter-departmental coordinator for the project had 
been working to prepare supporting regulations.   RFSA will 
appoint ALAC and Indonesia (LAPAN and Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs) will appoint one local partner company for 
project.Sara Lee to Relocate Business to Indonesia 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶17. Sara Lee Indonesia President Director Amitava Chattejee 
announced on December 19 that his company will expand 
production of its well-known Kiwi brand shoe polish from 
France to Indonesia to reduce labor costs.  Chattejee said 
Sara Lee Corporation, a U.S. based company, would also 
relocate operations to China and India.  Sara Lee Indonesia 
currently exports 20 percent of the Kiwi shoe polish it 
produces.  Chattejee said he expects that figure will rise 
to 50 percent following the production expansion.
