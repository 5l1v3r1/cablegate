SUBJECT: HAITI'S QUAKE PUTS CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM ON HOLD 
 
¶1.       (SBU) The January 12 earthquake has taken February 2010 
elections off the table and put an end to plans of securing 
constitutional reform before the May 12 deadline.  Haiti's 1987 
constitution requires that two consecutive legislatures approve 
constitutional amendments prior to their entry into vigor.  For 
constitutional reforms to apply to President Preval's successor, 
the final reading by a separate legislature must occur prior to May 
¶2010.  With the failure to elect a new legislature in February 
because of the post-quake cancellation, the current constitutional 
process will not be fulfilled by the May 2010 deadline, and reforms 
would have be reintroduced and in the best case scenario only 
become effective by 2016. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (SBU) The constitutional reform unifying the electoral 
calendar would have made elections more manageable and reduced 
costs to the cash-strapped state.  Equally important is the 
constitutional reform's elimination of the prohibition of dual 
nationality, which has marginalized Haiti's dynamic diaspora 
community from the political and economic development of their 
homeland.  Given that the organization of elections in the 
short-term is impossible, only two real options exist.  Either the 
GOH delays reforms until 2016, with significant political and 
economic implications, or it comes up with a formula for reform not 
contemplated in the current constitution.  During the national 
crisis following the departure of Baby Doc, a consensus emerged 
among the Haitian political class that this was the appropriate 
course of action.  In the present crisis, it is possible that such 
a consensus could be forged again. 
 
 
 
¶3.       (SBU) Comment:  Both the Government and the opposition 
share the view that constitutional reform is important.  Once the 
immediate crisis subsides enough to allow a focus on needed reforms 
to resume, we expect Preval and the opposition to define a way 
forward for constitutional reform.
