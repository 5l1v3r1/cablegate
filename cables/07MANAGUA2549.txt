SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  In November of the 2007-2008 waiver year, an American citizen 
claimant informed us that the GON had resolved two claims in 1999 
that were still registered as active cases in the Embassy's Property 
Office database. 
 
¶2. Since January 1995, the GON has resolved 2,518 Embassy-registered property claims belonging to 657 American citizens (Amcits). The Property Office database now includes 675 registered property claims belonging to 295 American citizens. Including American citizen claims not registered with the Embassy, the GON has resolved a total of 4,538 American citizen claims since January 1995. Most have involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). As of December 1, 2007, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of $321,400,500 to Embassy-registered claimants. With the inclusion of the claims resolved in 1999, the GON has resolved nine cases during CY07 and four this waiver year. End Summary.

¶4. On November 27, American citizen Jose Arguello provided a written statement to the Property Office attesting that he was compensated with indemnification bonds (BPIs) in July 1999 for two urban lots in Leon, confiscated by the Sandinistas in July 1979. Mr. Arguello reached a settlement with the GON for approximately USD 105,000. We have updated our database to reflect this settlement.
