SUBJECT: POLICY PLANNING TALKS WITH TURKEY ON FOR OCTOBER 19 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  We met with Turkish Deputy Director General (DAS 
equivalent) for policy planning Atilla Gunay, who reconfirmed 
that the Turks are looking forward to the October 19 visit of 
S/P director Stephen Krasner and EUR DAS Matt Bryza for the 
inaugural set of U.S.-Turkey policy planning talks. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Gunay explained that the Turkish Embassy in 
Washington has been instructed to approach the Department 
with the Turkish proposal.  Modelled on their policy planning 
talks with a number of other countries, they will propose 
starting at 10 a.m., moving to a working lunch at 1 p.m., and 
continuing in a relatively free-wheeling form for as long as 
needed. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Their preference is also for an open agenda.  Their 
intent is that discussions not focus on bilateral issues, but 
rather look at areas of mutual interest -- for example, Iran, 
Iraq, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Middle East or the EU, 
to name a few.  They would prefer a "flexible" approach that 
would allow for discussion of a number of foreign policy 
priorities and enrich both sides' understandings of a variety 
of issues of the day without being pinned down to a specific 
agenda.  They may or may not pull in other MFA officials; it 
would depend on how the discussions progress. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  We promised to forward their proposal and respond 
with Washington's comments.  This is an excellent opportunity 
to start to put some meat on the bones of the Strategic 
Vision document.  We would propose adding a bit more 
structure, so that we have a chance jointly to examine trends 
and tease out Turkish thinking on a number of issues. 
Depending on the planned arrival and departure times of 
Messrs. Krasner and Bryza, we propose as well that they meet 
separately with FM and PM adviser Ambassador Ahmet Davutoglu. 
 We would also hope to organize a small dinner with several 
thoughtful think tank and media representatives to round out 
the visit.
