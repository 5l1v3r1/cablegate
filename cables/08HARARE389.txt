¶1. (SBU)  Embassy Harare's EAC met on April 30 to review the 
situation and the mission's security posture.  The DCM 
chaired the meeting;  In attendance were representatives from 
RSO, DAO, CONS, USAID, MGT, R/POL, CDC, GSO, MED, CLO and MSG. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  DCM explained that the Zimbabwe Electoral 
Commission (ZEC) has invited representatives of candidates 
for the presidency to participate in a process of 
verification of election results.  This will begin on May 1, 
but it could take days to reach a conclusion.  It appears 
increasingly likely that the ZEC will announce that no 
candidate won 50% of the vote and that a runoff will be 
required within 21 days.  Such an announcement, however, will 
not preclude further negotiations or implementation of other 
strategies, since there is widespread concern that conditions 
throughout the country are not propitious for a free and fair 
runoff election. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  DCM said that reports of violence in rural areas 
and, to a lesser extent, in high density suburbs continue, 
with increasing numbers of deaths reported.  DAO, RSO and 
R/POL agreed.  Some reports suggest an acceleration of 
violence, though others suggest that increasing brutality is 
associated with tighter targeting; instead of an entire 
village being beaten, activists are singled out for more 
severe abuse. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  USAID reported that partners operating in rural 
areas have received conflicting messages.  Central government 
authorities and some local officials are encouraging NGOs to 
resume humanitarian operations, such as school feeding 
programs.  In other areas, however, international NGOs are 
accused of using humanitarian assistance to undermine the 
ruling party.  War veterans and local authorities in some 
areas are ordering NGOs to cease operations and threatening 
violence if activities continue.  DCM noted that the EAC 
should be attentive to cases in which partners are accused of 
acting as proxies in what ZANU-PF perceives as a USG effort 
to effect regime change in Zimbabwe.  The local organization 
that deployed election monitors country-wide is under 
investigation for this alleged offense as well. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  EAC members agreed that Embassy business has 
remained largely unaffected by the current political 
situation.  CDC noted that government offices are operating 
at minimal levels, which has slowed down CDC programs. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  EAC members agreed that the mission's current 
security posture, which includes case-by-case review of 
in-country travel requests, is appropriate.  The EAC decided 
to recommend to the Ambassador that the prohibition on 
lodging visitors at the Meikles Hotel be lifted, since the 
Meikles is no longer the locus of MDC activities.  CONS 
reported that American citizens have not reported any 
problems, but remain very interested in receiving regular 
communications from the Embassy.  The EAC discussed whether 
special guidance was required for the Harare International 
Festival of the Arts, which began April 29.  The EAC directed 
CONS and RSO to prepare a security message and warden message 
to notify communities that the situation remains somewhat 
volatile and continued vigilance is necessary. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  The Ambassador concurred with the EAC's 
recommendations.
