¶I.  BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY MANAGERS: 
 
(U) On January 28, 2010, an online Chinese-language Central News 
Agency article reported that a Taiwan customs broker and an exporter 
were prosecuted for violating Taiwan's export control laws. 
 (U) Sales Manager Wu Yi-wu of LSA Cargo Forwarding Co. Ltd. (the 
Chinese name of the company is Chia-Yu Forwarding Co. Ltd.) was 
indicted for aiding Taiwan-based Axiomtek Co. Ltd. (the Chinese name 
of the company is Ai-Xun Co. Ltd.) to illegally export a controlled 
Strategic High Tech Commodity to Iran. The Taipei Prosecutor's 
Office concluded the investigation today. 
 
(U) The Prosecutor's Office deferred prosecution and imposed NTD 
600,000 (approximately USD 18,750) in fines against Axiomtek. 
Prosecution against Axiomtek's Area Sales Manager Lu Wen-juan, Sales 
Representative Hsu Li-lan, and Shipping Specialist Wu Lin-yu, were 
also deferred with fines of NTD 80,000 (approximately USD 2,500) 
against Lu, and NTD 50,000 (approximately USD 1,562) against Hsu and 
Wu. 
 
(U) According to the Prosecutor's Office, Axiomtek agreed to export 
controlled SHTC, including computer CPUs and industrial panel PCs, 
during the period from January 2007 to May 2008.   The items were to 
be delivered directly via air freight from Taiwan to Iran, but 
Axiomtek was unable to do so.  Axiomtek then hired LSA Cargo 
Forwarding to ship the goods from Taiwan to Hong Kong and then to 
Iran. 
 
(U) The Prosecutor's Office indicated that lenient penalties were 
imposed against Axiomtek employees because this was their first 
offense and they cooperated with the investigation.
