¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  In an October 2 meeting with the 
Ambassador, opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) parliamentarian 
Mu Sochua expressed confidence in her personal safety.  Mu 
reiterated her desire to resolve her dispute with the Prime 
Minister and return to her duties in Kampot Province.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
A WAY OUT? 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mu met with the Ambassador October 2 and stated that 
she feels "100 percent confident" of her safety since 
returning from testifying at the Tom Lantos Human Rights 
Commission hearing in Washington on September 10.  Although 
she stated she had not been threatened by anyone since her 
return, she noted that in the past women in Cambodia had 
suffered acid attacks without warning. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mu had earlier met with Appeal Court Prosecutor 
General Ouk Savuth concerning her appeal of the dismissal of 
her defamation suit against the Prime Minister.  According to 
Mu, Ouk did not take her case seriously and instead spent the 
time "flirting" with her.  Mu stated that Ouk told her to 
"make it smooth for yourself" and attempted to convince her 
to drop the suit.  Mu, however, stated that her honor and 
reputation were at stake, and requested that he "use the 
law."  Under the circumstances, Mu believes that her appeal 
will be dismissed and the prosecutor will close the case 
instead of sending it back to the lower court for 
reconsideration. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In relation to the Prime Minister's suit against her 
(originally filed as a countersuit to her own) (Ref A), Mu 
stated that she will not pay the fine and is preparing 
herself mentally and emotionally to go to jail, which had 
caused her a lot of "personal stress."  Based on Mu's 
favorable history with the PM when she was Minister of 
Women's Affairs, the Ambassador queried whether they could 
reconnect to reslove their dispute.  Mu replied that she 
would like to "find a way out, to talk, have peace."  But, 
she also stated that, while the SRP is determined to work 
more cooperatively with the CPP, she will not be quiet and 
will continue to fight for the vulnerable. 
 
ROLE OF THE OPPOSITION 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mu stated that she wants to fulfill her duties as an 
elected official and return to Kampot Province to give voice 
to her constituents concerns without fear of prosecution (Ref 
B).  However, she stated that SRP members and grassroots 
human rights workers are being singled out in land and other 
disputes and called in for questioning or arrested.  Mu 
expressed concern that she or other SRP officials could be 
accused of defamation or incitement in their work with 
villagers involved in disputes. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mu also discussed her frustration with the 
CPP-dominated National Assembly, where the draft Penal Code 
is now being debated (Septel).  SRP has requested changes to 
several of the articles, specifically asking that the 
articles which criminalize defamation be removed, but Mu 
stated that they do not expect to prevail.  She did, however, 
agree that a public discussion of these issues is important. 
Mu expressed her intent to continue to represent the voice of 
the people, intimating that she will run again during the 
next election. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT:  Mu Sochua's interest in reconciling with 
the Prime Minister is indicative of the SRP's previously 
stated intent to focus on the issues and consolidate their 
message and voter base in preparation for the next election. 
Mu and the SRP appear to understand the need to work 
constructively with the ruling party in order to advance 
their human rights goals and become a more effective 
opposition party.  This type of increased focus and 
cooperation may result in reduced exposure to charges of 
incitement and defamation in the future.  However it turns 
out, the Embassy will continue to support a visible role for 
the opposition, and monitor the potential implications of 
defamation provisions in the new Penal Code.  END COMMENT.
