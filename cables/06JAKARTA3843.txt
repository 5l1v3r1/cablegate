¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Metropolitan Jakarta police conducted 
more than 200 raids on optical disc vendors in February 
2006, arresting 145 individuals and seizing large quantities 
of pirated optical disks.  While Jakarta police have not 
detained most small street vendors very long, 18 individuals 
remain in custody, including one factory owner.  The 
Ministry of Industry is producing what it hopes will be a 
more comprehensive report on Government of Indonesia (GOI) 
IPR enforcement and awareness efforts, hopefully the week of 
March 27.  Our IPR The police's recent enforcement actions 
demonstrate the most serious and sustained IPR enforcement 
effort in many years in Indonesia.  End Summary. 
 
Police Step up IPR Raids 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A local Motion Picture Association (MPA) 
representative provided us on March 21 with detailed 
Indonesian police reports of 211 pirate optical disk mall 
and street vendor raids the Jakarta police conducted during 
February 2006.  During the raids, police arrested 145 
individuals and seized more than 200,000 pirated film and 
music DVDs, CDs, VCDs and MP3s.  Details are as follows: 
 
-- Jakarta Metro: 9 raids, 10 arrests, 48,600 seized ODs; 
-- Central Jakarta: 11 raids, 11 arrests, 9,300 seized ODs; 
-- North Jakarta: 16 raids, 30 arrests, 43,200 seized ODs; 
-- West Jakarta: 7 raids, 6 arrests, 5,700 seized ODs; 
-- South Jakarta: 15 raids, 22 arrests, 23,300 seized ODs; 
-- East Jakarta: 37 raids, 31 arrests, 13,700 seized ODs; 
-- Tangerang: 16 raids, 17 arrests, 4,500 seized ODs; 
-- Bekasi: 18 raids, 39 arrests, 28,100 seized ODs; 
-- Depok: 18 raids, 45 arrests, 25,900 seized ODs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Jakarta Metropolitan Police (Metropolda) Special 
Crimes Chief Investigator Umar Surya Fana, a UPSTO0-trained 
Embassy contact, told us that in many cases police only 
detain small vendors for one evening to frighten them, but 
hold larger vendors longer while the police review their 
cases for possible submission to the prosecutors.  He said 
Metropolda currently is detaining 18 persons for IPR 
violations, including the owner of factories raided on 
February 9 (Ref A) and March 8 (see para 4). He added that 
the impetus behind recent raids is Indonesia Police Chief 
Sutanto's late December directive to all regional police 
chiefs to step up IPR enforcement. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A regional IFPI recording industry representative 
now working in Jakarta informed us on March 23 that police 
raided a registered factory on March 8 in Tangerang where 
they found evidence that its 1 DVD and 2 CD lines were 
producing pirated material.  The industry representative was 
reluctant to share too many details, as an investigation 
continues into links to exports to Australia and a regional 
crime syndicate.  The representative told us that as far as 
he was aware, police have closed and sealed off the factory. 
 
GOI Compiling IPR Progress Report 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Meanwhile, Ministry of Industry Director and 
Optical Disc Factory Monitoring Team Head Tony Tanduk told 
us he is compiling a report of all recent GOI IPR 
enforcement and awareness programs.  He said he hoped to 
present it to the Embassy early the week of March 27. 
According to Tanduk, the GOI has much to report, including 
the recent police raids.  He admitted that he finds it 
difficult to obtain information from other agencies, 
especially when they did not have it readily available. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  Although much remains to be done, our 
contacts in the IPR industry believe the Jakarta police 
reports demonstrate the most serious and sustained IPR 
enforcement campaign in many years.  They agree that the 
prime motivating factor has been General Sutanto's December 
directive.  Of particular note is the breadth of the raids, 
which are apparently also occurring in other areas of 
Indonesia, and are not just occurring at the three Jakarta 
shopping malls listed in the USG May 2005 IPR action plan.
