SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050133912 
 
REF: SINGAPORE 488 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests AIT Taipei's assistance in 
conducting a pre-license check on application 050133912 for 
the export of an Emission Microscopy Camera to Taiwan.  Post 
is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 
days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect 
pending and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Confirm that proposed end-user, 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) ordered an 
Emission Microscopy Camera from foreign consignee, Semicaps 
Pte. Ltd (Semicaps).  Semicaps was the subject of a previous 
unfavorable Blue Lantern determination involving the same 
commodity (See reftel for further details).  DTC wishes to 
establish the bona fides of this transaction and gain 
assurances of the company's familiarity with ITAR 
restrictions, especially those that prohibit the unauthorized 
re-transfer and re-export of USML items. 
 
¶4. ACTION AIT TAIPEI: Post is requested to make inquiries 
with TSM officials to determine if the company ordered an 
Emission Microscopy Camera from foreign consignee, Semicaps 
Pte. Ltd. and if so, confirm that the article will be used 
for the purpose stated on the license.  POC is TSM Principal 
Engineer, Kenneth Lin, Tel. 886-3-5773628 
END ACTION.

PURPOSE: 
 
Goodrich SUI will be selling the Emission Microscopy Camera 
to Semicaps for integration into their Photon Emission 
Microscope for ultimate end-use by Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Co. Ltd.  The camera will be used in 
conjunction with microscope optics to detect near-infrared 
photon emissions in the wavelength band of 900-1700nm for 
integrated circuit faults.  Localizing the faults is a key 
part of the integrated circuit failure analysis process used 
to design, debug, for product engineering, yield enhancement 
and customer returns.
