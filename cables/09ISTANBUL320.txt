SUBJECT: SESAME SEES ITSELF AS A MODEL CENTER FOR 
"SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE", SEEKS ADDITIONAL FUNDING 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: The fourteenth meeting of the Council of 
Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications 
in the Middle East (SESAME) was held in Istanbul in July. 
The SESAME project is a scientific initiative currently under 
construction in Jordan that currently fosters positive 
international relations between many unlikely entities in the 
Middle East.  Developed under the auspices of UNESCO, SESAME 
is a major international research facility that will enable 
world class research to be conducted by scientists from the 
Middle East.  Representatives from Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, 
Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and Turkey 
discussed the direction of the program and how to overcome 
SESAME's financial challenges.  Represented by CG Istanbul 
poleconoff, the United States attended as an official 
observer.  All the representatives cast SESAME as an ideal 
example of the kind of institution President Obama had in 
mind when he called for establishing "centers of scientific 
excellence" in the Middle East.  END SUMMARY.

SESAME -- A World-Class Science Center for the Middle East 
 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Modeled after the European Organization for Nuclear 
Research (CERN), the SESAME project is jointly governed by a 
diverse Council of nine members --  Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, 
Iran, Israel, Jordan Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, and 
Turkey.  Negotiations for Council membership are underway 
with Iraq.  The Council members have transcended political 
differences to collaborate on SESAME's design, development, 
and scientific program.  Observers of the Council include 
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Portugal, 
Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Following the recommendation of an expert European 
Commission panel, which reviewed this design in 2002, a truly 
world-class facility is now under construction.  However, 
while the EU has provided 1.2 million Euros, and Jordan has 
made generous contributions (3.3 million USD in addition to 
land, buildings, and infrastructure), more funding is needed 
to purchase important technical components.  While the major 
elements are in place, (SESAME conducted a successful use of 
the synchrotron a few weeks ago), without remaining funds, 
SESAME's completion is in jeopardy. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  While there are over 60 synchrotron facilities 
around the world, SESAME is the first in the Middle East. 
Researchers will work in many disciplines, including 
addressing biomedical and environmental issues.  For example, 
researchers using a synchrotron developed antiretroviral 
drugs used to combat HIV.  The international scientific 
community has strongly endorsed SESAME's diplomatic and 
scientific objectives.  The SESAME project has garnered the 
support of international organizations such as UNESCO and the 
International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (representing 
more than 59 member countries).

¶5. (SBU)  Representatives from Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, 
Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and Turkey met in Istanbul 
to discuss SESAME's progress and plan how to get the 
resources to complete the research center.  SESAME 
researchers told the Council 2014 was the target date SESAME 
will be operational. More importantly, SESAME officials 
deliberated opportunities to raise the 15 million USD to 
ensure at least the minimum level of construction needed to 
make SESAME fully operational.  Council President Chris 
Llewellyn Smith said SESAME could possibly borrow the 
additional funds, either from the Jordanian royal family or 
the European Investment Bank.  Smith, however, was concerned 
that the Jordanian well might soon go dry. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The Council was optimistic that recent events have 
opened two funding opportunities from the U.S.  Smith and 
many members pointed to President Obama's Cairo speech where 
the U.S. committed itself to open "centers of scientific 
excellence" in the region.  The members saw SESAME as an 
ideal model to make the President's statement into a reality. 
 Moreover, Israel representative Elizer Rabinovici reported 
he personally discussed the scientific and diplomatic 
benefits of SESAME with Congressperson Rush Holt, who is now 
a supporter of SESAME and is seeking ways to encourage a U.S. 
financial contribution.  Smith asserted that a financial 
contribution from the U.S. would not only enable construction 
to continue, but would likewise encourage other nations to 
provide additional necessary funding. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  The members were optimistic that Iraq would soon 
join SESAME.  Smith told the Council that his discussions 
with the government of Iraq were going well.  However, no 
representatives from two SESAME members --  Bahrain and 
Pakistan -- attended the Istanbul meeting.  Smith said he 
would contact representatives from these two countries to 
ensure their participation in subsequent SESAME meetings. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT:  SESAME is a rare organization where Middle 
East nations participate in an unlikely working partnership. 
Representatives from Iran, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, 
Cyprus, and Turkey work together towards advancing the body 
of science.  The Middle East is sadly lacking such 
world-class research facilities and SESAME could be a model 
center of excellence" as envisioned by President Obama for 
the region.  SESAME can benefit both science and diplomacy, 
yet additional funding is needed to make both these goals a 
reality.  A poorly funded SESAME that simply houses 
researchers from diverse nations would fall short of 
achieving either goal.  Council President Smith stressed that 
"if the science is successful, political success will 
follow."  However, the delay in establishing a true 
world-class synchrotron jeopardizes the chances the science 
will be successful.  SESAME needs additional funding to make 
the science a success.
