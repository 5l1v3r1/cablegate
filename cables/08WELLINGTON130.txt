SUBJECT: Request for Two Management DVCs in June 
 
 
¶1. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Post requests two Management/Business DVCs 
in June with experts suggested in paragraph 6 below. 
 
¶2. Preferred Activity Dates, Fiscal Year, and Quarter: FY08 
programs, Monday, 9 and 16 June; 3rd quarter; Washington time, at 
5:00pm.  This is 10 and 17 June at 9:00am NZ time. 
 
¶3. PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: We have been approached by the New Zealand 
Institute of Management (NZIM) to provide two videoconferences in 
June.  Reaction to our DVCs with this organization in the past has 
been excellent, with standing room only in the embassy auditorium, 
along with very good interest from four regional offices, which also 
linked in and participated in the dialogs. Post sees this activity 
as a cost-effective way of contributing to the embassy's commitment 
to best practice in the workplace. The videoconferences provide a 
forum for the exchange of ideas, the establishment of ongoing 
relationships, and opportunities to promote the ideas presented by 
the interlocutors to New Zealand managers in business and 
government. NZIM has over 4,000 members nationwide, and media 
coverage is likely. 
 
¶4. Audience Expected:  NZIM members and also members of the wider 
business community, economists, AND representatives from government 
organizations and at least 3 cities where NZIM members will be 
online.
