¶1.  (SBU) MFA Assistant Under Secretary Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin 
Mubarak Al Khalifa March 22 strongly promoted the candidacy 
of Bahrain's Houda Nonoo for a seat on the board of the 
Foundation for the Future.  He understood there were 22 
candidates for 12 board seats.  In some cases, there were 
three or four nominees from the same country, whereas only 
one Bahraini had been nominated.  In Shaikh Abdul Aziz's 
view, there should be only one representative per country, 
they should come from countries with an active civil society, 
and there should be diversity among the board members.  Nonoo 
meets all of these qualifications. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Shaikh Abdul Aziz had learned from the Qatari 
Ambassador in Bahrain that Yemen had voluntarily withdrawn 
its offer to host the Foundation headquarters, leaving only 
Jordan and Qatar.  While stating that Bahrain had not yet 
decided who to support, he said that Qatar is giving more 
money to the Foundation than any other member except for the 
United States, and "not everything" should be in Jordan. 
Qatar was actively lobbying to receive Bahrain's support.  He 
said that the decision-making process on where to locate the 
headquarters must be transparent and based on objective, 
previously announced criteria.
