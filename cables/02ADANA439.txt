¶2.  MILITARY BUILD-UP ALONG IRAQI BORDER 
(Cumhuriyet)  Deployment along the Turkey-Iraq 
border continues prior to the possible U.S. 
operation against Iraq.  Turkish military continues 
with infrastructure works in the region in 
preparation for the operation.  Within this 
framework, additional materials and equipment are 
being transferred to both sides of the border. 
Military units sent to the border area have settled 
in trailer parks and pilgrimage facilities near 
Silopi's (Sirnak) Habur border gate.  In addition, 
civil defense directorates in Sirnak and Hakkari 
provinces are working on measures to be taken 
against a possible influx of refugees (from Iraq). 
Evrensel quoted the Elazig Civil Defense Director, 
Celal Cihan, as stating that (Elazig's) underground 
shelters were not secure against chemical and 
biological weapons (attacks). 
 
 
¶3.  INCREASED DISTURBANCE IN THE SOUTHEAST 
(Milli Gazete)  Disturbance among people in 
Hakkari, a Turkish province on the Iraqi border, 
has reached a peak due to the possible U.S. attack 
against Iraq, with residents taking intense anti- 
war security measures.  Some residents have sealed 
their windows and doors with nylon against chemical 
weapons attacks.  Hakkari people are concerned 
about their relatives in Iraq as well. 
 
 
¶4.  AKGUNDUZ CAN NO LONGER BECOME MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT 
(Hurriyet)  Fadil Akgunduz, who was elected a 
Member of Parliament from Siirt in the November 3 
parliamentary elections, lost his eligibility to 
run for parliamentary elections because the Supreme 
Court upheld a two-year prison term and a fine of 
TL 750 million (approx. USD 455) given to him by an 
Istanbul court for violation of the "Capital Market 
Law."  Sought for swindling for a long time, 
Akgunduz entered the Parliament after November 3, 
gaining parliamentary immunity.  However, he lost 
his standing and immunity when the elections in 
Siirt were cancelled.  Then, he was arrested and 
ordered to remain in custody. 
 
 
¶5.  INVESTIGATION AGAINST ELECTRICITY THIEVES 
(Turkiye)  The Turkish Electricity Distribution 
Corporation (TEDAS) Diyarbakir Directorate launched 
an investigation against 13 TEDAS employees who had 
been using electricity illegally.
