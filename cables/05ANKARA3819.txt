SUBJECT: ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BOMBING AT TURKISH MINISTRY OF 
JUSTICE IN ANKARA 
 
¶1. (SBU) On Friday, 1 July 2005 at approximately 0930 hours 
(Local), a male subject, 25-30 years old, attempting to enter 
the Turkish Ministry of Justice in Ankara repeatedly set off 
the magnetometer he passed through to gain entrance to the 
building.  As the Turkish National Police (TNP) prepared to 
search him, the subject attempted to detonate an explosive 
device on his body.  The TNP reports that the fuse failed to 
detonate the explosives and the TNP immediately placed 
handcuffs on the subject.  Despite being handcuffed, the 
subject fled the Ministry of Justice Building in the 
direction of the Old Prime Ministry Building approximately 
one hundred meters away.  The TNP officers fired warning 
shots, but when the subject failed to stop, the TNP shot the 
subject.  A TNP EOD team responded to the scene and 
reportedly removed two explosive devices from the subject's 
body.  Multiple news reports also state that an 
identification card with the name Muharrem Akyurt was found 
on the body of the subject.  At this time, there is no 
further information on the identity of the subject, nor on 
the explosive devices.  There are no reported casualties 
other than subject who was shot by the TNP.  Media report 
that the subject was killed, but this has not been officially 
confirmed. 
 
¶2. (SBU) RSO Ankara suspects that the target of the suspected 
suicide bomber was the Turkish Ministry of Justice.  It has 
been reported that the Justice Minister was in the building 
at the time.  At this time, no terrorist organizations have 
claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing.  Two 
AmEmbassy Ankara employees (one American FSO and one FSN) 
were at the Ministry of Justice when this incident occurred. 
Both employees have safely returned to the Embassy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The DS Command Center and State Department 
Operations Center were notified of this incident via 
telephone at approximately 0945 hours (Local).  RSO Ankara 
will closely follow the TNP's investigation of this incident 
over the coming days.  Point of contact is ARSO Jason Griffin 
at 90-312-455-5555 ext. 2599.
