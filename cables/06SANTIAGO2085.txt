BASES NEAR ITS BORDER? 
 
¶1. Two Santiago dailies cited UDI Members of Congress who denounced 
Venezuela for providing assistance to Bolivia to build 26 military 
bases along its border with Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, and Peru. 
Excerpts follow: 
 
¶2. On October 4, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 129,000): 
 
"The House Foreign Relations Committee accepted the request filed by 
UDI Congressman Ivan Moreira, and summoned Foreign Minister

television that Hugo Chavez was financially assisting him to build 
26 military bases in the triple frontier of Bolivia with Brazil, and 
Paraguay, and on the frontier with Chile and Peru." 
 
¶3. On October 3, conservative, afternoon daily "La Segunda" (circ. 
33,000): 
 
"UDI Members of Congress Ivan Moreira and Angelica Cristi denounced 
the presence of Venezuelan troops in Bolivia and the construction of 
military bases in that country.  They said this would 'raise 
tensions in the region and leads again to the question of whether 
Hugo Chavez should be trusted and Chile should support Venezuela in 
the UNSC.  Congressman Moreira said this development 'makes Latin 
America a geopolitical risk and is dangerous for Chile...."
