SUBJECT: Iran Encourages IRoA to Employ Refugee Returnees 
 
Ref: Kabul 579 
 
¶1. (SBU) Iran and Afghanistan recently concluded a draft memorandum 
of understanding (MOU) that obliges the latter to accept set numbers 
of Afghan refugee graduates of Iranian universities into civil 
service employment (REFTEL).  Iran's ostensible goal for the MOU is 
to encourage the return of refugees to Afghanistan.  The UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) gave us a copy (salient points 
summarized below).  UNHCR has declined an IRoA request that it act 
as a third-party guarantor.  Suspicious IROA officials are concerned 
the Iranian government may exploit the arrangement to increase its 
already considerable influence in Afghanistan; nevertheless, they 
acknowledge their country desperately needs educated human capital 
from whatever source. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin summary of MOU's salient points (unofficial 
translation): 
 
Introduction: 
 
-- Notes Iran has hosted large numbers of Afghan refugees, many of 
whom have attended Iranian universities. 
-- Asserts these educated Afghans could helpfully contribute to 
their country's reconstruction. 
-- Expresses hope that, as returnees, these educated Afghans will 
lay the foundation for "better friendship and sincerity" between 
Iran and Afghanistan. 
 
Obligations of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
-- Establish a "Human Requirements Database" that lists private 
sector and government ministries' employment needs; the database is 
to be accessible from employment centers. 
-- Institute a process by which Iranian educational credentials can 
be certified. 
-- Pay $300/month salary for one year to 80 returnees. 
 
Obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
-- Give the IRoA complete information on the Afghan graduates 
residing in Iran. 
-- Pay for the release of individual educational documents from 
Iranian universities (Comment:  Apparently, Iranian university 
transcript fees can be prohibitively expensive.) 
-- Grant a one-year Iranian residence visa to the family members of 
those Afghan graduates who choose to return to their homeland. 
(Comment:  This visa would allow the program participant time to 
find a job and prepare for his family's later return to 
Afghanistan.) 
-- Give program participants one-year Iranian multiple entry visas. 
-- Pay $500/month salary for one year to 80 returnees and give them 
housing loans. 
 
Obligations of the Iranian-Educated Afghan Returnees 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
-- Be prepared to work in Kabul or major provinces of Afghanistan. 
-- Try to bring families back to Afghanistan from Iran within one 
year. 
 
Obligations of the United Nations 
--------------------------------- 
 
-- Solicit financial support for the execution of the returnee 
program from the international community. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Though UNHCR does not plan to sign the MOU, it supports the 
document's intent.  UNHCR officials note, and their IRoA 
counterparts often complain, because Afghan refugee returnees 
educated in Pakistan often speak English, their services are denied 
the IRoA, which cannot compete against western embassies and NGOs' 
higher salaries.  Since non-English-speaking Iranian university 
graduates are less competitive, they should be more readily 
available to the IRoA as prospective civil service hires.
