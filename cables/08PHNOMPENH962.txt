CHHAY WHEN HE DIED 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On August 21, 2007, OUM Chhay, former advisor to 
National Assembly President Heng Samrin, died under 
suspicious circumstances while in the custody of Ministry of 
Interior (MOI) Cambodian National Police Anti-Drug Department 
officials.  Oum Chhay appeared to have fallen to his death 
out of a second story window at the Department's Phnom Penh 
office.  The Ministry of Interior maintains the death was a 
suicide.  However, human rights groups claimed foul and 
suspected that the man was pushed to his death.  Oum Chhay 
was found on his back on the ground beneath the second story 
window, apparently having fallen directly on the back of his 
head.  Doubters of the suicide story have argued that this 
position is unlikely for someone who willingly jumped to his 
death.  The low height of the window -- estimated to be about 
15 feet off the ground -- also made the suicide claim suspect. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Soon after the death, the MOI established an 
investigating committee that included the prosecutor of the 
Phnom Penh Court, police officials, a doctor, and Oum Chhay's 
wife.  The investigating committee determined that the death 
was suicide.  The committee also reported that three police 
officers were on duty in the room with Oum Chhay when he 
died, and those three officers were suspended.  (Note:  We 
are checking on their current status.  End note.)  Their 
names and titles are: 
 
Police Lieutenant Colonel CHEA Leng, Anti-Drug Department 
Anti-Counterfeit Investigation Office Chief; 
 
Lieutenant CHAN Phanny, Anti-Drug Department Anti-Counterfeit 
Investigation Office Deputy Chief; and, 
 
Lieutenant KHUN Vannak, Anti-Drug Department Anti-Counterfeit 
Investigation Office Deputy Chief. 
 
¶3.  (U) Sub-units of the Anti-Drug Department are: 
Administrative Office, Investigation/Research Office, 
Anti-Drug Trafficking Office, Anti-Consumption Office, 
Anti-Counterfeit Office, Technical Office, Legal Office, 
Intervention Office, and Education Office. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Background on OUM Chhay:  OUM Chhay was 51 years 
old, reportedly an army general, and held the prestigious 
Cambodian title of "Oknha."  He was owner of Chhay Chay 
Investment Company located in the Poipet Special Economic 
Zone.  OUM Chhay was arrested in connection with a 
high-profile meth-amphetamine precursor lab bust in Kampong 
Speu province in August 2007.  MOI officials reported OUM 
Chhay's transportation company had helped to transport 
chemicals to make amphetamine precursors.
