SUBJECT: QUAD DEMARCHE ON GEORGIAN SHIP SEIZURES 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary and Action Request:  Recent ship seizures by 
Georgian authorities in international waters off the coast of 
Abkhazia have provoked strong rhetoric from both Russian and 
Abkhaz de-facto officials. Quad members (U.S., France, 
Germany, and the UK), while not yet in total agreement on the 
legal issues surrounding the interdictions, all agree that 
Georgia's actions are legally highly questionable as well as 
that further actions of this nature by Georgia could 
destabilize the region.  Tbilisi is requested to deliver the 
points in paragraph 3 at the Ambassadorial or Charge level, 
together with your Quad counterparts, before COB September 
¶16.  Moscow is requested to deliver the points in paragraph 4 
at an appropriate level, also in conjunction with Quad 
counterparts, no later than COB September 16.  Quad members 
have all approved the following language. 
 
¶3. (SBU) 
 
BEGIN POINTS FOR EMBASSY TBILISI 
 
-- Expressly reiterate support for Georgia's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity within its internationally recognized 
borders. 
 
-- Express concern about Georgia's recent actions in 
arresting in international waters non-Georgian flag ships 
that are coming from or heading for ports in the Georgian 
region of Abkhazia. 
 
-- According to our evaluation the legal grounds for the 
Georgian practice are highly questionable.  We have very 
serious doubts regarding the seizure of foreign-flag vessels 
in international waters on the bases cited by Georgia. 
 
-- More importantly, and apart from the legal situation, we 
consider the Georgian actions to be politically problematic 
and have the potential for escalation.  The actions have 
already provoked strong rhetoric from the Russian and the 
Abkhaz side, and may provoke responses that lead to renewed 
military confrontation, destabilize the region and prove 
highly detrimental to international efforts of conflict 
settlement.  Legal action taken against crew members of these 
ships has also endangered Georgia's relationships with some 
of its international supporters. 
 
-- Express relief that the previous cases did not provoke 
violent incidents, but urge Georgia strongly to refrain from 
such actions in the future and discuss the problem within the 
international fora established for the conflict ) especially 
in the framework of the Geneva talks - as well as within the 
Incidents Prevention and Response Mechanism. 
 
-- We continue to recognize Georgia's rights as an 
independent and sovereign state.  We underscore our continued 
support for Georgia's territorial integrity. 
 
-- We offer our support and expertise to Georgia in order to 
find solutions to the many serious practical problems which 
arise from the difficult political environment. 
 
END POINTS 
 
¶4. (SBU) 
 
BEGIN POINTS FOR EMBASSY MOSCOW 
 
-- Express concern at the potentially dangerous developments 
regarding the arrest of ships in the Black Sea that come from 
or are heading towards Abkhaz ports. 
 
-- We consider that this situation has a high potential for 
political escalation that could further destabilize the 
region. 
 
-- We are urging all parties, including the Russian 
Federation, to exercise restraint and discuss the matter 
within the international fora established for the conflict - 
especially Geneva - as well as within the Incidents 
Prevention and Response Mechanism. 
 
-- Encourage you to use your influence with the Abkhaz side 
to urge calm. 
 
-- We are also bringing our concerns directly to the 
attention of Georgian authorities regarding the importance of 
observing the provisions of international maritime law and 
the need to avoid action that might prove highly detrimental 
to regional stability and international efforts of conflict 
settlement.
