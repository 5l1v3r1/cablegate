¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified; 
please handle accordingly.  Please see Action Request 
in paragraph 6. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Senior Indonesian officials have 
responded positively to our proposal that Indonesia 
help train the Afghan National Police (ANP).  In 
addition to helping bolster the security situation in 
Afghanistan, doing so will further strengthen U.S.- 
Indonesia relations, and enhance Indonesia?s global 
leadership role.  This message outlines initial steps 
to transform Indonesia?s inchoate interest into 
concrete steps forward.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INDONESIA WILLING 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Indonesian officials have responded 
positively to our suggestion that Indonesia provide 
assistance to the Afghan National Police (see 
reftel).  Doing so would strengthen U.S.-Indonesia 
security ties and enhance the overall bilateral 
relationship.  It would help the GOI build law 
enforcement and counterterrorism contacts in a 
critical region.  And it would bolster Indonesia?s 
claim to leadership in Muslim world and among 
developing countries. 
 
WHAT INDONESIA CAN OFFER 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Indonesian training can benefit 
Afghanistan.  Bringing ANP officers to Indonesia will 
familiarize them with the workings of a developing 
Muslim-majority democracy.  It will also acquaint 
them with Indonesia?s ongoing--and successful-- 
process of police and military reform.  The 
Indonesian National Police (INP) can offer valuable 
training in basic policing skills, police-civilian 
relations, local or intra-communal conflict 
resolution, and other areas where the INP already has 
an established record.  The exact training proposed 
would depend on specific ANP needs. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Initially, we recommend that all training 
would be done in Indonesia, possibly at the Jakarta 
Center for Law-enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC) in 
Semarang, Central Java.  As that training succeeds, 
and Indonesian police build stronger relationships 
with their Afghan counterparts, we would encourage 
the GOI to conduct some training in Afghanistan.  A 
first step in this direction could be to send INP 
mentors to Afghanistan on a short-term basis to 
follow up on training conducted in Indonesia. 
 
MOVING FORWARD 
 
¶6.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  To move forward, Mission 
requests Department assistance in three key areas? 
assessing Afghan needs, identifying funding and 
making initial contacts: 
 
--AFGHAN NEEDS:  To further engage the INP on this 
matter Mission requests that the Department provide 
information regarding Afghan law enforcement training 
needs.  Key questions include: 
 
     -What are the key training needs of the ANP? 
 
     -What level and number of ANP officers are to be 
trained? 
 
     -What level of education and professional 
training do the ANP trainees already possess? 
 
     -What level of proficiency should be achieved at 
the conclusion of the training? 
 
     -How long would the GOA need to select 
candidates for training? 
 
--FUNDING:  Any Indonesian support would require USG 
support.  Mission requests that the Department 
forward information regarding what funding might be

available. 
 
--INITIAL CONTACT:  Mission will work to identify 
appropriate INP and USG officials who will travel to 
Afghanistan in the near-term for initial 
consultations with Afghan counterparts.  We request 
that the Department, in cooperation with Embassy 
Kabul, work with us to facilitate this vist. 
 
END ACTION REQUEST.
