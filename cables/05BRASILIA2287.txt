SUBJECT: FARC SPOKESMAN ARRESTED IN BRAZIL 
 
REF: BRASILIA 785 
 
 ¶1.  On August 24, Brazilian Federal Police, in cooperation 
with Interpol agents in Brazil, arrested Colombian 
Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) "spokesman" Francisco 
Antonio CADENAS at a Sao Paulo bus station under an 
international order for his capture.  The Colombian 
government has accused Cadenas of maintaining links with the 
FARC, "practicing homicidal terrorism," and inciting 
rebellions.  Cadenas is being held at the Federal Police 
Regional Headquarters in Sao Paulo under the authority of the 
Brazilian Supreme Court (STF).  The STF will make a decision 
on Cadenas' extradition after a formal request from the 
Colombian Government is received.  (Note:  Cadenas is also 
known as Francisco Antonio COLLAZZOS, Oliveirio MEDINA, 
Camilo LOPEZ, and "El Cura." End Note) 
 
¶2.  Cadenas, a former Catholic Priest and FARC "Ambassador to 
Brazil, Argentina, and Chile," is known in the region for his 
ties to leftist paramilitary groups.  In March 2005, 
Brazilian weekly news magazine "VEJA" accused Cadenas of 
creating a plan to funnel US$ 5 million to Worker's Party 
(PT) representatives in support of President Lula da Silva's 
2002 presidential campaign (reftel).  In 2000, Cadenas was 
detained in Brazil for using fake documents and an expired 
visa.
