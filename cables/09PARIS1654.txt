COMMITTEE 
 
REF: STATE 122725 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a December 7 meeting, MFA UNSCR 1540 Officer 
Paul Furia said France is strongly in favor of the U.S. 
proposal to establish a Voluntary Fund, as detailed in 
reftel, to provide resources to the UN's 1540 Committee to be 
used for technical assistance to UN member states in 
fulfilling the WMD non-proliferation obligations of UNSCR 
¶1540.  Furia added that the projects to be supported through 
a Voluntary Fund as suggested in the U.S. paper also 
correspond with French priorities.  He added that France was 
especially interested in maximizing the effectiveness of 
country missions and was looking to the upcoming mission to 
the Democratic Republic of Congo as a test case for the 
program. 
 
¶2. (SBU) However, despite French support for the 
establishment of a Voluntary Fund, Furia said current budget 
constraints would make it difficult for France to make a 
meaningful contribution.  Instead, France was hoping for 
funds to be made available through the EU.  These could come 
either directly from the Commission, which Furia believes has 
sufficient funding to meet at least part of the approximately 
$10 million required for the projects outlined in the U.S. 
paper, or through combined member state action through the 
European Council.
