¶1.  Ambassador Nolan discussed reftel points with Foreign 
Minister Kenneth Tsekoa during a meeting on October 24 at United 
Nations Day.  Minister Tsekoa stated that the government of 
Lesotho continues to strongly support the SADC's lead on the 
subject of Zimbabwe.  He referred the Ambassador to a speech 
that he gave on 27 September 2008 at the UN General Assembly 
plenary session.  In that speech, he congratulated the people of 
Zimbabwe and stressed the importance of democracy, respect for 
human rights and the rule of law. 
 
¶2.  Text of Minister Tsekoa's UNGA speech:  "A few days ago, we 
witnessed a positive development in the Southern Africa 
sub-region when the leaders of the people of Zimbabwe put aside 
their political differences and joined hands to form a 
government of national unity.  We congratulate the people of 
Zimbabwe for this historic feat.  We urge the international 
community to support the people of Zimbabwe to rebuild the 
economy of their country and to determine their destiny under 
the atmosphere of national harmony and peace.  We also urge the 
leadership of Zimbabwe to ensure adherence to the principles of 
democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law as such 
adherence will have a catalytic effect on socio-economic 
development.
