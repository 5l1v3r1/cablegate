¶1. (U) South Africa condemned "till the cows come home" the 
new U.S. targeted sanctions against Zimbabwe.  During a 11 
December press conference, DepForMin Aziz Pahad said that 
imposing sanctions on the children of Zimbabwean leaders is 
"collective punishment of a non-sensical nature" which will 
not help the process.  On the addition of new ZANU-PF 
officials to the targeted sanctions list, Pahad suggested 
this step will not "take us, at this crucial stage, any 
further."  He added that public criticism of the Government 
of Zimbabwe is ineffective, arguing that "the world of 
politics would be very easy if all that was required was 
condemnation." 
 
¶2. (SBU) During Pahad's press conference, he highlighted the 
progress by the Mbeki-led Southern African Development 
Community (SADC) Zimbabwe facilitation, claiming 
optimistically that "sooner rather than later, annnouncements 
will be made that at last the Zimbabweans . . . are helping 
themselves to find a Zimbabwean solution which can be the 
ONLY lasting solution" (highlight in Department of Foreign 
Affairs transcript of remarks).  (NOTE: Pahad and other SAG 
officials have similarly predicted the positive conclusion of 
the SADC talks for months (see for example ref C).  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3. (U) On the recently-concluded European Union-Africa Summit 
in Lisbon, Pahad attempted to portray the discussion of 
Zimbabwe as healthy, with both sides putting forward their 
perspectives.  He noted that nearly all the European leaders 
expressed support for President Mbeki's facilitation efforts. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT:  Pahad's reaction to the new U.S. targeted 
sanctions is predictable, albeit frustrating.  As a matter of 
policy, South Africa rejects sanctions as a foreign policy 
tool.  Announcement of new sanctions during -- what they 
optimistically hope is -- the sensitive, final days of their 
SADC facilitation effort in Zimbabwe is not welcomed.  END 
COMMENT.
