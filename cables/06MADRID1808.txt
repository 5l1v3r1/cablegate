(SBU) Poloff discussed ref A points with MFA Deputy Director 
General for Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean Carmen 
Diez on July 17.  She noted Spain's strong commitment to 
reconstruction and stabilization in Haiti, which the nearly 
16 million euros that Spain contributed to Haiti in 2006 (ref 
B) has clearly demonstrated. (NOTE:  Spain has pledged a 
total of 16 million euros for 2006, and has so far disbursed 
10 million of that pledge.) Diez said that during the 
upcoming conference Spain intends to announce a similar 
contribution for next year.  In addition, Diez said that 
Spain is willing to host a follow-up donors' conference in 
Madrid on November 30.
