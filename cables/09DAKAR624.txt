SUBJECT: GUINEA-BISSAU SUPREME COURT NARROWS LIST OF 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 
 
On May 13, the Supreme Court of Guinea-Bissau issued its 
ruling on the eligibility of the twenty official candidates 
contesting the June 28 presidential election.  In a surprise 
decision, the Court allowed the candidacy of businessman and 
former President Henrique Rosa.  (Note: Observers had 
speculated that the 63-year-old Rosa, of mixed Portuguese and 
African heritage, would not meet the legal requirement that 
at least one of his grandparents must have been born in 
Guinea-Bissau and must have been of Bissau-Guinean 
nationality.)  The Court disallowed eight candidates, 
including former Prime Ministers Francisco Fadul and 
Aristides Gomes.  The other disallowed candidates were Joao 
Tatis Sa, Pedro Infanda, Cirilo Oliveira, Ibraima Laf Djalo, 
Serifo Balde, and Abdulai Djibril Balde.  The Court offered 
no immediate explanation for its decision.  Septel to follow.
