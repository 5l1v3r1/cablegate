¶2.  Begin Text: 
 
H.E. Mr. Barack Obama 
President-elect of the United States of America 
 
Excellency: 
 
On behalf of the Lebanese National Assembly and on my own 
behalf, I extend to you my warmest congratulations on the 
occasion of your landslide victory in the US presidential 
elections.  It is indeed a victory that goes beyond the 
borders of your country to the whole world which has 
impatiently waited for the triumph of democracy in your 
country over the unipolar concept. 
 
We, in the Middle East in general, and in Lebanon in 
particular, are waiting for a just and comprehensive peace 
and for Lebanon to restore Shebaa Farms and Kfar Shuba Hill 
and the Lebanese village of Al Ghajar, and are looking 
forward to clearing the Lebanese territory of cluster bombs 
and mines and to bringing an end to aggressions against its 
sovereignty and violations to its airspace and regional 
waters. 
 
We hope that you bring justice, peace and stability, for 
these are also elements of victory in the international 
combat against terrorism. 
 
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
/s/ Nabih Berry 
President of the Lebanese National Assembly 
 
Beirut, November 6, 2008
