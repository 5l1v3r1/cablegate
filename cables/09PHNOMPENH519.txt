SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN MEDIA REACTION TO THE SECRETARY'S LOWER MEKONG 
MEETING 
 
¶1. SUMMARY:  All print and broadcast media outlets in Cambodia 
covered the Lower Mekong Ministerial of July 23 hosted by the 
Secretary and the Foreign Ministers from Cambodia, Thailand, Laos 
and Vietnam.  The articles and television segments were 
overwhelmingly positive and highlighted the Secretary's proposal to 
hold such a meeting annually.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. Over the weekend all major media outlets in Phnom Penh covered 
the Lower Mekong Ministerial.  One of the top dailies carried a 
front page photo of the Secretary and Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor 
Namhong above the fold followed by the Ministerial Fact Sheet which 
was issued by PA Washington following the meeting.  The fact sheet 
was printed in its entirety along with portions of the joint press 
statement.  Both of the documents were issued as press releases by 
Embassy PA and posted on the website on the morning of the July 24. 
The remaining papers carried the same photo and fact sheet but did 
not feature them as prominently. 
 
¶3. In order to capitalize on the positive coverage generated by the 
Ministerial the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also took out a quarter 
page advertisement in Sunday's copy of the country's top newspaper 
"Rasmei Kampuchea". The advertisement highlighted the Ministerial 
and detailed the topics of discussion including the proposed annual 
meeting, a partnership between the Mekong and Mississippi river 
commissions and regional environmental concerns.
