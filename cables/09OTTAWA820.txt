¶1.   (SBU) According to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) human rights officials, Canadian 
priorities for this year's Third Committee echo those of U.S. (refs 
a and b).  Canada's main priorities are the adoption of the Iran 
resolution and other country-specific resolutions and the defeat of 
"no-action" motions to permit open debate.  Canada's resolution on 
the Iranian human rights situation is so that "human rights 
defenders and victims of human rights violations in Iran know that 
they have not been forgotten by the international community." 
DFAIT's assessment is that adoption of this resolution will require 
an intense global lobbying campaign in close coordination with the 
U.S.    Canada will also strongly support the EU-led resolutions on 
the human rights situations in Burma and DPRK. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Canada shares U.S. concerns with the concept of 
"defamation of religions" and agrees with the U.S. approach of 
seeking deferral or, failing that, voting against the resolution. 
Canada is urging moderates that traditionally abstain on this 
resolution to take a stronger stand in defense of human rights. 
Canada has co-sponsored the Genuine Elections resolution and 
anticipates its early adoption.  Canada is pleased to see renewed 
U.S. engagement on the Rights of the Child resolution.   Canada 
agrees with the U.S. analysis that the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women resolution is unlikely to come up at 
this year's General Assembly, but Canada will continue to work with 
the U.S. "to move this issue forward."
