¶1. Embassy contacted Indonesian Air Force (IAF) Aircraft 
Combat Division Lieutenant Colonel Udin Wahyudin on November 6 to 
verify reftel transaction.  Wahyudin claimed that his office has 
never dealt directly with the foreign party, Singapore Falcon 
International Aviation (Falcon).  The majority of IAF supply 
transactions utilize an Indonesian based company, which in turn 
contracts with foreign suppliers.  Wahyudin said it was possible 
that Falcon purchased parts on behalf of an Indonesian firm that is 
a registered IAF supplier. 
 
¶2. On November 16, Wahyudin told us IAF ordered some F5 spare parts 
through direct commercial sales, including AWP Engine J-85 type. 
However, IAF did not/not request the Stage 1 Turbine Blade detailed 
in reftel due to adequate stocks for fiscal year 2006/2007. 
Wahyudin also said the local agent for Falcon is PT Bersari and that 
IAF has not/not placed the supply order with the company as detailed 
in reftel.
