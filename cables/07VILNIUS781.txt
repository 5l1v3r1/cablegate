REF: STATE 148531 
 
We delivered reftel points and nonpaper to Nida Lubertiene, 
First Secretary of the MFA's Threat Analysis, Crisis 
Management and International Operations Division, on October 
Â¶26.  She said the GOL had received a report from the EU, 
prepared by the Government of Turkey, which detailed the 
actions of the PKK.  When asked about the existence of PKK 
financing in and transit through Lithuania, Lubertiene 
replied that such vulnerabilities do not currently exist in 
Lithuania, but the GOL will continue to monitor the domestic 
situation for developments in the future.
