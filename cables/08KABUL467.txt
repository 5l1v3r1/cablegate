SUBJECT: KUNDUZ PROVINCIAL SECURITY: IMPROVING COORDINATION AND 
DEVELOPING CAPACITY 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: PRT Kunduz has successfully instituted several 
coordination mechanisms for the Afghan National Security Forces 
(ANSF) and ISAF in the province.  The measures have improved 
cooperation within the ANSF, as well as between ANSF and ISAF.  The 
successful re-launch of Kunduz's Joint Provincial Coordination 
Center (JPCC), greater ANSF involvement in operational planning, and 
the transition of responsibility for coordination to Afghan actors 
will further improve performance on security issues. 
 
Coordination Mechanisms: Police, Provincial and Tri-provincial 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶2. (SBU) The United States, Germany and the European Union are all 
engaged in police assistance in Kunduz.  PRT Kunduz instituted a 
weekly police coordination meeting in summer 2007 to de-conflict 
efforts and ensure that Afghan police receive necessary training, 
mentoring and equipment.  Participants include German military 
police, German Police Project Office, U.S. Army Police Mentoring 
Teams (PMT), DynCorp police trainers, EU Police Mission (EUPOL), 
United Nations Assistance Mission Afghanistan (UNAMA), U.S. PRTOff, 
and Afghan National Police (ANP).  The German military police 
currently host the weekly meeting, but the German PRT leadership 
would like EUPOL to assume responsibility for coordination. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Governor, Chief of Police, National Directorate of 
Security (NDS) and Commander of the Afghan National Army (ANA) 2nd 
Kandak meet with the PRT, U.S. Army PMT and UNAMA every week to 
discuss Kunduz's security situation.  In addition to a weekly report 
of incidents and activities, the meeting is an opportunity to reach 
agreement on programs and emphasize the linkages between security, 
governance and development.  NDS hosts the meeting and the Governor 
chairs it, while the PRT sets the date and ensures attendance. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) PRT Kunduz launched a tri-provincial security meeting in 
summer 2007 for Kunduz, Takhar and Baghlan provinces to address 
cross-border security.  Every other month, participants from Takhar 
and Baghlan travel to Kunduz for the meeting.  The meetings have 
addressed issues such as criminal groups in Bangi district (Takhar 
province), re-integration of insurgents, and the JPCC.  The meeting 
gives officials in the three provinces access to ANSF elements, such 
as ANA and Afghan Border Police, and international elements, such as 
UNAMA, which are not physically located in their provinces. 
 
Goals for 2008: Operational JPCC, Joint Operational 
Planning, Afghan Ownership 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
¶5. (SBU) During the tri-provincial meeting on January 20, 2008, 
participants from all three provinces endorsed the concept of the 
JPCC.  Kunduz will soon inaugurate a new building built by the 
provincial police with assistance from the PMT.  The remaining 
challenges are to identify ANSF liaison personnel and, with the 
assistance of a DynCorp mentor, to develop the Center's operational 
capabilities.  Takhar and Baghlan have also expressed interest in 
having JPCCs. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Joint operations with ANSF have played a key role in recent 
PRT operations.  The ANA with the German Operational Mentoring 
Liaison Teams (OMLTs) and the ANP with the German military police 
have recently operated in Khanabad and Aliabad districts of Kunduz 
province.  In 2008, the PRT will try to expand participation to 
other international actors and involve ANSF even more in the 
planning process. 
 
¶7. (SBU) A third priority is transitioning responsibility for the 
security coordination mechanisms from the PRT to the ANSF.  This 
change will improve the operational capabilities of the ANSF and the 
governance capabilities of provincial officials.  Through these 
security mechanisms, ANSF and ISAF are better able to address 
insurgent threats.
