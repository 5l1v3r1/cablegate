SUBJECT: Dozens Feared Dead in Massive North Sumatra Floods 
 
¶1.  (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Jakarta. 
 
¶2.  (U) Widespread flooding caused by heavy rains in the Mandaling 
Natal Regency in the interior of the province of North Sumatra on 
September 15 resulted in at least 15 deaths with at least 38 more 
people missing and feared dead. Flash floods caused mainly by soil 
erosion resulting from intensive logging impacted over 2,000 persons 
in six villages in the area. Observers in the environmental NGO 
community contacted by Consulate Medan on September 16 recounted 
years of mismanagement in this area, shared by Taman Gadis National 
Park, a logging concession, and production forest. A history of 
dumping of timber byproduct upstream contributed to the inability of 
the river flow to absorb added water after recent rains, local NGOs 
added. 
 
¶3.  (U) Many former logging concessions have closed in recent years, 
including one partly owned by fugitive Indonesian timber baron 
Adelin Lis. (Lis was previously acquitted on charges of large-scale 
illegal logging in 2007 in a controversial decision and remains on 
the run charged with money laundering) This has resulted in a 
deterioration of logging access roads that further complicates the 
relief effort. 
 
¶4.  (U) Local officials have responded by sending disaster relief 
teams including the Indonesian Red Cross and local disaster 
management and social welfare authorities. They stated to Consulate 
Medan on September 17 that the majority of the 2,000 people impacted 
remain cut off from assistance and communication due to poor 
infrastructure in the area. Small amounts of aid have reached the 
area but much more is needed. It is still unclear how many of the 
local residents are injured or missing. 
 
¶5.  (U) North Sumatra police admit publicly that their 
first-responders have no means to access the area due to the lack of 
road network and flooding of the rivers. Heavy equipment needed for 
rescue work is also unable to traverse the road network and 
helicopter support to drop relief supplies remains an option being 
explored by local authorities. The impact of the logging concessions 
and years of mismanagement is clear in the disastrous consequences 
for local residents. Some local aid was reported on local TV 
arriving via the port city of Sibolga by ship and directly by police 
helicopter on the afternoon of September 17. The Indonesian 
government has not requested international aid as of this time.
