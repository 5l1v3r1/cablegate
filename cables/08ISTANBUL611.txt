TAGS: PHUM PREL TU
SUBJECT: NO QUICK END IN SIGHT FOR ERGENEKON TRIAL

Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL SHARON A. WIENER FOR REASONS 1.4(B,D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Because of the peculiarities of the Turkish 
judicial system, the Ergenekon trial of 85 defendants 
suspected of plotting to overthrow the Turkish state is 
expected to last at least a year, and perhaps much longer. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  We recently interviewed three prominent lawyers who 
have been following the Ergenekon case including:  Tugrul 
Ansay, former Dean of Koc University Law School; Muammer 
Aydin, president of the Istanbul Bar Association; and Ergin 
Cinmen, human rights lawyer.  All said they expect the trial 
to be quite lengthy, even by Turkish standards, but 
reasonably fair. 
 
¶4.  (U) The trial commenced on October 3.  It is being 
conducted in a makeshift courtroom at the Silivri prison 
complex near Istanbul, which is inadequate to hold all of the 
defendants, their attorneys and families, and press 
representatives.  In an attempt to ease the overcrowding, 
early in the case the court issued an order directing that 
the 47 detained defendants be tried separately from the 39 
who are free on bail.  That order was quickly rescinded when 
various defendants argued that its effect would be to deny 
one group of defendants the right to witness testimony given 
by the other group.  Reportedly, Justice Minister Sahin has 
now directed the construction of a new mixed-use facility, 
that would serve as a courtroom during the week and a sports 
hall on weekends.  (Comment: It is some measure of the 
anticipated length of the trial that the construction of an 
entirely new facility while the trial is ongoing could be 
considered a plausible solution to the problem of 
overcrowding.  End Comment.) 
 
¶5.  (U) On the third day of the trial, prosecutors began an 
oral recitation of the 2500 page indictment, which required 
nine days of hearings. On November 12, examination of the 
defendants began. 
 
¶6.  (U) Turkey's judicial system is "Napoleonic" or 
"Continental" in nature.  In Turkey (as is typical in 
Continental Law countries), juries are not utilized; rather, 
a three-judge panel decides both the law and the facts. 
Accordingly, cases normally do not proceed day-to-day. 
Indeed, said Cinmen, Turkey's criminal procedure code 
requires a court to hold only one session per month, which 
may last only a few minutes. 
 
-- In Turkey, the Court reporter normally does not make a 
simultaneous and verbatim transcript of testimony; rather, 
the judge will periodically stop the proceedings in order to 
dictate to the reporter a summary of what was said. 
 
-- While Turkey recognizes a defendant's right against 
self-incrimination, a negative inference can be drawn from a 
defendant's failure to testify.  Accordingly, Cinmen said, he 
and most other defense attorneys normally have their clients 
Testify, since otherwise the court will conclude that the 
defendant is hiding something.  Cinmen thinks that the 
Ergenekon defendants will similarly choose to testify, and at 
great length, using the opportunity to deliver political 
speeches. 
 
-- The Turkish judicial system permits testimony by "secret" 
witnesses, whose names are not divulged to defense attorneys. 
 (However, said Cinmen, no conviction can be based solely 
upon the testimony of a secret witness.) 
 
¶7.  (U) As a result, in Turkey the average length of a 
criminal trial is about one year, according to Cinmen.  The 
Ergenekon trial, with its extraordinarily long indictment and 
large number of defendants, is expected to take much longer 
than the average Turkish criminal trial.  In order to reduce 
its length, Cinmen said  a number of unusual procedures have 
been put in place.  First, the judges and prosecutors have 
all been relieved of other responsibilities, so that they can 
concentrate on this case alone.  Second, the proceedings are 
being electronically recorded.  Finally, the case is to 
proceed on a day-to-day basis.  Thus, said Cinmen, although 
the case will involve much more courtroom time than the 
average case, it could be concluded within the normal one 
year period.

¶8.  (U) Aydin is not as optimistic.  He thinks it would 
neither be proper nor possible for the case to go day by day, 
as it would place too much pressure on the court and 
litigants.  (Silivri is located some 40 miles from downtown 
Istanbul, where most of the attorneys maintain their 
offices.)  And, in fact, since the trial began, hearings have 
been held 2-3 times per week, a decent pace for a Turkish 
criminal trial, but one which implies that it will 
take substantially longer than a year to conclude. 
 
¶9.  (U) The court will declare its verdict within a week or 
two of the end of the trial, and sometime thereafter submit a 
written explanation.  An appeal must be lodged within seven 
days of the verdict.  A guilty verdict can be reached only if 
the judge has a "certain conviction" of guilt which, 
according to Cinmen, judges interpret as requiring 100 
percent certainty.   A conviction does not require unanimity 
among the judges, and can be based on a majority vote. 
 
¶10.  (C) The three attorneys conceded that Turkey's judiciary 
views its primary task to be the protection of the state, 
rather than the even-handed administration of justice. 
Cinmen acknowledged that Turkish judges often are seen as 
pro-prosecution, and that this calls into question their 
independence.  However, he noted that acquittals do occur, 
and expressed confidence that in the Ergenekon trial the 
rights of the defendants are being observed.  Our other 
interlocutors similarly predicted  that justice would be 
done.  Aydin did acknowledge, however, that if political 
pressure is put on the judges (a possibility he would not 
discount), he does not expect they would be able to resist, 
nor does he expect them to "do the right thing" and resign.
