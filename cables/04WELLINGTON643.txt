REF:  STATE 163418 
 
¶1.  Embassy grants country clearance to Thomas Ramsey, Desk 
Officer for NZ and Samoa, and Ed Rindler, INL, to transit 
New Zealand as part of the delegation attending the U.S. 
Post-Pacific Islands Forum Dialogue in Apia, Samoa.  Mr. 
Ramsey will be in Auckland on August 7th, and Mr. Rindler 
will be in Auckland on August 13. 
 
¶2.  Embassy understands that no assistance is required for 
Mr. Ramsey.  For Mr. Rindler, hotel reservations have been 
made at the Hilton Auckland, Princes Wharf, 147 Quay St. 
Tel: +64-9-978-2000; Fax: +64-9-978-2001.  Reservation

Office:  +64-9-303-2724, ext. 295 
Fax:     +64-9-366-0870 
Cell:    027-434-3140 
E-mail:  LopezSR@state.gov 
 
¶4.  All official visitors to the Embassy are required to 
report to the Regional Security Office for a TDY security 
briefing. 
 
¶5.  Visitors should use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent.  Taxi fare from the 
airport to downtown Auckland hotels is approximately NZD60. 
 
¶6. Travelers can exchange currency at the airport upon 
arrival and ATM machines are readily available throughout 
New Zealand. 
 
¶7.  Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZ$200 (US $150).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be administered 
immediately and without warnings. 
 
¶8.  Security Assessment: 
 
a.  There are no local terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the regional security office. 
 
b.  Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat mail 
have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions in New 
Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, various 
groups in New Zealand have demonstrated occasionally at the 
embassy in Wellington and at the consulate in Auckland. 
These demonstrations were of a small scale and were 
peacefully conducted.  During these demonstrations, the host 
country police and protective services provided adequate 
protection to the embassy and consulate. 
 
c.  While New Zealand is considered a low threat crime 
environment, Wellington and Auckland have experienced an 
increase in violent and petty crimes.  Home invasion 
robberies and assaults, once very rare, are becoming more 
frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur countrywide. 
Visitors should be aware that street crime is a daily 
occurrence in the larger cities, including Wellington and 
Auckland.  Common sense precautions should be taken, 
especially at night, to avoid becoming a target of 
opportunity. 
 
d.  All forms of public transportation are generally safe at 
all times of the day.
