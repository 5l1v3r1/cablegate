SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS MINISTER REQUESTS TRANSITION FROM 
EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOPMENT AID 
 
¶1. (SBU) CDA Fernandez paid a courtesy call January 21 on the 
newly-appointed Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Haroun Ron. 
Minister Ron is a respected and loyal member of the SPLM who assumed 
this post when the SPLM allowed its ministers back into the 
government earlier this month. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With hardline NCP-member and Commissioner General for 
Humanitarian Aid Hassabo Abdel Rahman in attendance as a regime 
minder, Minister Ron made a special point of thanking CDA Fernandez 
for U.S. treatment of Sudan over the years, highlighting in 
particular the "decades of support from USAID."  In reference to the 
CPA, Minister Ron commented that "the key is to make sure these guys 
(the NCP) not only sign the paper but also ensure that the agreement 
works."  The Minister pointed out that the regime's job now is to 
make unity attractive. 
¶3. (SBU) The Minister and Hassabo both requested that more USAID 
funding go toward development activities.  Hassabo said that what 
Sudan needs now is "early recovery" and "recovery" activities.  He 
noted that currently only 30 percent of donor money goes toward 
early recovery and 19 percent goes toward recovery, while 51 percent 
goes toward humanitarian assistance.  CDA replied that over a 
million people are now dependent on food aid, so we cannot abandon 
them.  However, he noted that USAID is now evaluating all of its 
programs and reported that there is a growing emphasis on the 
transition from humanitarian assistance to development. This is 
something the Ministry should further discuss with USAID. 
 
¶4. (SBU) CDA highlighted the recent Development Alternatives, 
Incorporated (DAI) incident in El Fasher and said that our people 
had felt threatened and mistreated by GOS officials and that should 
not be the case, even if the law currently allows for equipment to 
be taken by the government when a project ends.  Without making any 
apology, Hassabo noted that "often there are suspicions in war 
areas."  He said this incident underlines the need to establish 
technical agreements before initiating programs to define clearly at 
the outset what will happen to equipment at the end of a project. 
 
¶5. (SBU) CDA noted that the GOS often does the right thing 
eventually, but does not get credit for it because of the way it 
does it - giving the impression that it is being forced to do it - 
and doesn't like it.  "You are misers in your cooperation," he noted 
"and nobody likes that."  In this regard, CDA urged that the 
moratorium on restrictions for humanitarian access be extended 
immediately and not at the eleventh hour on January 31, which would 
make it appear once again as if the GOS is not cooperative. 
Minister Ron promised that a memo will be provided to President 
Al-Bashir this week seeking approval for the extension.  Hassabo 
also promised that the moratorium will be extended.  CDA again urged 
that this not happen at midnight on January 31. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: Minister Ron, like his SPLM colleagues in other 
ministries, finds himself in an incredibly difficult position - 
attempting to exert control over regime hardliners like Hassabo and 
State Minister of Humanitarian Affairs (and indicted ICC war 
criminal) Ahmed Haroun.  Although he will not be able to control 
them, his presence should provide some small openings to advance our 
aims with the GOS in regard to humanitarian assistance.  We expect 
that President Al-Bashir will extend the moratorium on restrictions 
to humanitarian access, but only at the last minute or possibly 
after the deadline has passed, with the ill grace so typical of the 
Khartoum regime.
