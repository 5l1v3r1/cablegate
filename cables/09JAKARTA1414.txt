INDONESIA ON BOARD 
 
REF: STATE 86139 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) Indonesia is on board with our reftel demarche and 
invitation package for the 9th ARF Inter-Sessional Meeting 
(ISM) on Disaster Relief Sept. 16-18.  In response to our 
presentation, Kristanyo Hardojo of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DEPLU) Directorate of Intra-Regional Cooperation 
said the GOI looks forward to sending a full delegation to 
the ISM and to the initial planning discussions for a future 
ARF disaster relief exercise. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Indonesia hopes to use the ISM and side meetings in 
Honolulu to begin concrete planning for the next ARF 
Voluntary Disaster Relief (VDR) exercise proposed for 
Indonesia.  Hardojo noted that while Japan is the anticipated 
co-chair of the VDR with Indonesia, he expected both 
countries would welcome additional co-chairs.  He said the 
title of co-chair did not necessarily have to be linked to 
any specific level of financial or other support, but 
welcomed the idea of USG planning assistance. 
 
¶4.  (U) Continuing, Hardojo said the GOI understands that the 
August 26 deadline for delegate registration and the August 
28 deadline for requesting funding assistance, but noted that 
Indonesia may be slightly late in submitting its full 
delegation.  He anticipated that the delegation would include 
three or four members from DEPLU, one from the Indonesian 
military, and one or two from other agencies, such as the 
Department of Health.  Hardojo added that Indonesia's 
representation at the ISM would overlap significantly with 
its delegation to the Asia-Pacific Conference on Military 
Assistance to Disaster Relief Operations that immediately 
precedes it. 
 
¶5.  (U) Pangeran Ibrani Situmorang of Hardojo's office 
pledged to forward Indonesia's delegate registrations to 
Washington as soon as the delegation is set.
