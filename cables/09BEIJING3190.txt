SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.   (U) Following the CERC Signing ceremony, State Councilor LIU 
Yandong hosted a lunch. During lunch, Madam Liu highlighted the 
importance of U.S.-China cooperation on electric vehicles (EVs) and 
said she believes that this collaboration has a promising future. 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu also expressed his wish to 
extend cooperation on clean energy, such as new battery technology, 
clean coal, and joint efforts to tackle climate change. Both agreed 
that industry's involvement is key to effective and efficient 
cooperation. The Clean Energy Research Center (CERC) can serve as a 
good basis for expanding cooperation, said Liu. Chinese officials 
who participated in the lunch included: WAN Gang, Minister of 
Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), LIU Qi, Deputy 
Administrator of the National Energy Administration (NEA), ZHANG 
Shaochun, Vice Minister of Ministry of Finance (MOF), CHEN Xi, Vice 
Minister of Ministry of Education (MOE), TAN Tieniu, Assistant Party 
Secretary of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) as well as 
several director general-level officials from MOST, NEA and the 
Ministry of Housing and Urban and Rural Development (MOHURD).  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
CLEAN ENERGY COOPERATION 
------------------------ 
¶2.  (U) Madam Liu stated that several cities and provinces across 
China are enthusiastic about clean energy development. The Chinese 
government is offering great support to enterprises, research 
institutes, and universities involved in this development, said Liu. 
Secretary Chu said he shared the same view and noted that the U.S. 
government is making efforts to assure companies and enterprises of 
the importance the government attaches to climate change. 
 
ELECTRIC VEHICLES 
------------------ 
¶3. (U) Madam Liu praised the success of the U.S.-China Electric 
Vehicle Forum held in late September (REFTEL) and asked Chu whether 
the U.S. will attach more importance to development of the electric 
vehicle or the hybrid vehicle. Chu answered that the United States 
is very serious about EV development, especially as the U.S. has 
invested a lot of money on battery development and has made 
significant progress. Madam Liu acknowledged that focusing on EV 
development is a good way to reduce both nations' dependence on oil. 
 
 
¶4.  (U) Madam Liu also elaborated that Beijing possesses over 3 
million vehicles and that the even-odd number traffic control 
measure during the Olympics not only helped with the heavy traffic 
situation, but reduced greenhouse gas emissions. [NOTE: During the 
 
BEIJING 00003190  002 OF 002 
 
 
Olympics, Beijing authorities implemented a system based on the 
license plate end-number, which ensures a given vehicle will not be 
driven at least one day a week to reduce pollution associated with 
Beijing's heavy traffic. This system remains in place. END NOTE.] 
Minister Wan also mentioned that the government initiated a 
favorable policy on low-emission vehicles resulting in sales of 
nearly 11 million low-emission vehicles in China last year. Madam 
Liu and Secretary Chu agreed that the two nations should enhance 
cooperation on EV development, and that the scientists from both 
countries can work together. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Assistant Secretary (A/S) 
David Sandalow suggested that DOE outline specific recommendations 
for EV cooperation within the next two months. DOE noted that it 
already has plans to invite 10 cities from the U.S. to participate 
in EV demonstration projects, while China will identify 10 sister 
cities to be paired with the U.S. cities. Minister Wan also said 
that that both the United States and China already have agreed on 
how to implement the sister city projects, noting that the EV 
industry will serve as the main implementing body, while the role of 
provincial and city governments will also be strengthened. 
 
OTHER AREAS 
------------ 
¶6. (U) CAS' Tan Tieniu, introduced the agreement that has just been 
signed between Tsinghua University and MIT, focusing on cultivating 
talents in the energy field. He also expressed his wish to further 
enhance student exchange programs between the United States and 
China.
