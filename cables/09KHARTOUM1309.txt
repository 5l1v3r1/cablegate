SUBJECT:  NCP REMOVE GOVERNOR OF UPPER NILE STATE, CREATING NEW 
TENSIONS BETWEEN DINKA AND SHILLUK 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On November 14, the Government of Southern Sudan 
(GOSS) announced the removal of Upper Nile Governor Gatluak Deng 
Garang and the new National Congress Party (NCP) nomination of 
William Othwong Awer.  While the NCP maintains control of the 
governor's seat of Upper Nile State, any changes in Southern Sudan 
must be approved and announced by the GOSS.  The change in 
governors, and the timing, is causing new tensions between Dinka and 
Shilluk communities already poised for a new round of conflict in 
the area.  Speculation abounds on why the NCP is replacing the 
incumbent Nuer governor with a Shilluk, however, some believe that 
it is another attempt by the NCP to create divisions in an already 
contentious political environment.  GOSS officials remain hopeful 
that the new governor will be able to reestablish calm in the area 
and exercise influence over the restive Shilluk community.  End 
Summary.

NCP Remove Governor of Upper Nile 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 14, the National Congress Party (NCP) 
nominated, and the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) approved, a 
new governor for Upper Nile State, William Othwonh Awer, a Shilluk, 
vice Gatluak Deng Garang, a Nuer.  While there had been rumors in 
the week leading up to the announcement, it took everyone by 
surprise, and the incumbent governor in particular.   A USG team 
visiting Malakal, the capitol of Upper Nile State, met with the 
incumbent governor, Gatluak, on Saturday, November 14, and only 
learned afterwards of the announcement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Gatluak has refused to accept the NCP decision to remove 
him.  Gatluak claims he was not properly notified about his removal 
from President Omar Beshir or the GOSS.  He has also enlisted the 
support of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) Joint Integrated Units (JIU) 
in Malakal to block the airport so that the incoming governor cannot 
land and take office.  The SAF JIU in Malakal consists mostly of 
former Nuer militia from the area.  Sources close to the governor 
told us that the governor is now wearing a military uniform and 
staying in his office. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Dinka/Shilluk Tensions Intensify 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) before the announcement was made, there were reports of 
Dinka and Shilluk tribesmen massing and arming around Canal in Upper 
Nile State.  Since the announcement, tensions between the two 
communities in and around Malakal have increased.  On November 15, 
local government officials told us that Shilluk had celebrated in 
the markets following the announcement of a Shilluk governor on 
Saturday night, provoking a number of small incidents between Dinka 
and Shilluk.  The Dinka community is refusing to accept the new 
appointment of a Shilluk governor. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Some Malakal residents see the NCP decision to replace the 
governor as further proof of the NCP trying to increase political 
tensions in Upper Nile State.  Many believe the NCP is trying to 
sideline Nuer representation in the NCP by replacing the governor, 
in line with other recent decisions on Riek Gai and Nuer positions 
in the SAF.  Others believe the NCP is possibly trying to support 
the Shilluk and Lam Akol's SPLM-DC, who enjoy considerable support 
in Malakal.   While there are some differences of opinion about why 
the NCP removed the incumbent governor and replaced him with a 
Shilluk, it is clear that the decision will exacerbate tensions 
between the Dinka and Shilluk communities in the state and probably 
create new tensions between the Shilluk and Nuer.

GOSS Officials Remain Hopeful 
----------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) Deputy Secretary 
General Anne Itto and Undersecretary for Presidential Affairs Cirino 
Hiteng Ofuho spoke optimistically about the new governor on November 
¶17.  Cirino told us that while the new governor is a Shilluk who 
split from the SPLM along with Lam in 1991, he subsequently fell out 
with Lam later and joined the NCP.  They are not believed to be 
allies currently.  The new governor is also reportedly a member of 
the Shilluk royal family.  Gatluak told us during our visit to 
Malakal that the Shilluk king recently came out against Lam and the 
SPLM-DC militia, and 
Itto reported that both Minister of Internal Affairs Gier Chuang 
Aluong and Minister of Regional Cooperation Oyai Deng Ajak --the 
former a Shilluk-- have spoken with the new governor and believe he 
will work to resolve some of the tensions between the Shilluk and 
 
KHARTOUM 00001309  002 OF 002 
 
 
Dinka and use his influence over the Shilluk community of Upper 
Nile. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Cirino explained that there is usually a balance of power 
in Upper Nile State between the three major tribal groups.  Recently 
the balance was maintained as follows: governor - Nuer, the deputy 
governor - Dinka, and the speaker of the state parliament - Shilluk. 
 Since the new governor is Shilluk, most believe the deputy governor 
will be replaced by a Nuer and the speaker of the parliament by a 
Dinka.  No such nominations have yet been made, and the newly 
nominated governor has yet to take his seat in Malakal. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment: Although the reasons behind the removal of the 
incumbent governor are still not clear, the nomination of William 
Othwonh Awer, a Shilluk, will increase tensions in the already 
volatile Upper Nile area.  The UN and others are preparing for 
possible clashes between the two communities which have been locked 
in a cycle of tribal conflict since January 2009.  Additionally, the 
involvement of the SAF JIU in defending the incumbent governor could 
trigger new problems between the SAF and SPLA JIU units in the area 
if the SPLA are asked to intervene.  End Comment.
