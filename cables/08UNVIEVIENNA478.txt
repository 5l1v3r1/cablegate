SUBJECT: FRIENDS OF AFGHANISTAN TAKES SHAPE IN PREPARATORY MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 091864 
 
¶1.  (U) Representatives from Afghanistan, France, Italy, U.K., and 
U.S. met at the Italian mission in Vienna on August 27 to discuss 
the structure and format of the proposed "Friends of Afghanistan" 
group.  Charge delivered guidance points from reftel, which were 
well received across the board. 
 
¶2.  (U) All participants agreed with our position that the Friends 
should be an informal forum with no secretariat or rotating 
officers, and all accepted the membership of Sweden, given its role 
as co-chair of the Working Group on Finance and Governance and 
status as a Major Donor. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Afghanistan Charge Wahid Monawar noted his desire to limit 
membership to major donors and troop-contributing countries.  The 
U.K. agreed that initial discussions should focus on supply 
reduction, but wants to leave the door open to discuss demand 
reduction and other issues as needed in future sessions.  France 
again pressed to expand the scope of the group's discussions beyond 
UNODC to the activities of other Vienna-based organizations active 
in Afghanistan, but their proposal was not accepted by the others. 
All agreed that the involvement of Russia would be a distraction at 
this stage. 
 
¶4.  (U) Italy was tasked to develop a short terms of reference to be 
shared with others in the group.  The first meeting of the Friends 
of Afghanistan will take place on Sept. 17 at the UN with 
participation by UNODC Executive Director Costa.
