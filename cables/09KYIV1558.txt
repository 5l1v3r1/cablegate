¶1. (SBU) Embassy delivered reftel demarche on U.S. priorities 
for the Human Rights Council 12th Session on September 11. 
The recipient was the MFA desk officer responsible for the UN 
Human Rights Council, Sviatlana Tereverten.  She thanked us 
for providing this information to the GOU in advance of the 
meeting.  She could not commit the GOU's support to our draft 
resolution on freedom of expression, but promised to have it 
reviewed and send comments during the week of September 14. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Tereverten underscored that Ukraine does not, as a 
policy, co-sponsor country-specific resolutions in the UNHRC. 
 The EU has also solicited GOU support for the resolutions on 
Somalia, Burundi and Cambodia. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Tereverten informed us that the GOU will not sponsor 
resolutions during the meeting.  It too is committed to 
strengthening the HRC and will focus most attention on 
measures to build the capacity of the institution.
