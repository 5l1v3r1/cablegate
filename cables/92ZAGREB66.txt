FOLLOWING IS A LETTER FROM CROATIAN PRESIDENT FRANJO 
TUDJMAN TO EDGAR BRONFMAN, PRESIDENT OF WORLD JEWISH 
CONGRESS.  BEGIN TEXT: 
 
DEAR MR. BRONFMAN, 
 
I AM ADDRESSING YOU ON BEHALF OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
CROATIA, CURRENTLY THE YOUNGEST EUROPEAN STATE, BUT 
A STATE WITH A CENTURIES-LONG TRADITION OF 
STATEHOOD.  CROATIA NOW SEEKS THE RECOGNITION OF HER 
INDEPENDENCE AS EXPRESSED BY THE WILL OF HER 
CITIZENS AT THE REFERENDUM OF MAY 15, 1991.  AT THE 
REFERENDUM, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CROATIAN 
CITIZENS CHOSE TO LIVE HENCEFORTH IN THE INDEPENDENT 
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, A DEMOCRATIC STATE ASSURING ALL 
ITS CITIZENS EQUAL RIGHTS, REGARDLESS OF RELIGIOUS, 
NATIONAL OR POLITICAL AND OTHER AFFILIATIONS, AND 
REGARDLESS OF ANCESTRY OR SOCIAL STATUS.  THE 
CROATIAN PEOPLE WISH TO ACHIEVE THE BASIC RIGHT OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

EVERY NATION TO SELF-DETERMINATION. 
 
I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE 
AND SUPPORT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FREELY 
EXPRESSED WII) 9| 5#3 :858"3, 9| 5#3 4307?)8: 9| 
:49-58-, HAVING IN MIND YOUR INTERNATIONAL STATURE 
AND YOUR POSITION, AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD 
JEWISH CONGRESS, THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF 
THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN ALL COUNTRIES WHOSE CITIZENS 
INCLUDE JEWS.  I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE JEWISH 
PEOPLE WILL SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT OUR 
EFFORTS, WHICH ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE 
LONG-STANDING STRUGGLE OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE TO 
REALIZE THEIR NATIONAL RIGHT TO STATEHOOD, A RIGHT 
AFFIRMED BY THE WORLD IN 1948 WHEN THE STATE OF 
ISRAEL WAS PROCLAIMED. 
THE MILLENNIAL DREAM OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, REALIZED 
IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL, WAS 
ASSOCIATED WITH HORRIBLE SUFFERING AND PERSECUTION, 
CULMINATING IN THE TRAGIC EVENTS DURING THE SECOND 
WORLD WAR.  AS IN MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THE 
CROATIAN JEWISH COMMUNITY, WHOSE CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
CULTURAL, PUBLIC, ECONOMIC AND SPIRITUAL LIFE OF 
CROATIA HAS BEEN INVALUABLE, SUFFERED TRAGIC LOSSES 
DURING THE WAR.  ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
CROATIAN CITIZENS- CROATS, SERBS, JEWS AND OTHERS - 
FELL IN THE ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE AND AS VICTIMS OF 
FASCISM AND NAZISM.  THE USTASHA REGIME OF THE 
INDEPENDENT STATE OF CROATIA COMMITTED COUNTLESS WAR 
CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.  THAT WAS A 
REGIME WHICH, UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE NAZI AND

THESE CRIMES, IT IRREVOCABLY JOINED ITS PATRONS, 
SHARING THEIR HISTORICAL FATE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, A 
VAST NUMBER OF CROATS - MYSELF AMONG THEM - TOOK UP 
ARMS AGAINST THE USTASHA REIGN OF TERROR AND THE 
NAZI AND FASCIST OCCUPATION. 
 
WE DEEPLY REGRET THE FACT THAT THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN 
CROATIA SUFFERED THE TRAGIC FATE OF THE HOLOCAUST 
DURING THE WORLD WAR II.  HOWEVER, DURING THIS GRAVE 
ORDEAL, THE CROATIAN PEOPLE SHOWED SOLIDARITY WITH 
THE VICTIMS OF THE USTASHA REGIME.  THIS IS 
INDISPUTABLY EVINCED BY EXAMPLES OF DIRECT 
ASSISTANCE WHICH THE POPULATION AND THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH IN CROATIAN RENDERED TO THE JEWS IN CROATIA. 
A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE 
PERSECUTED JEWS WAS THE ACTION OF THE SCHOOL YOUTH 
OF ZAGREB.  BROUGHT TOGETHER AT THE STADIUM WHERE 
YOUNG JEWS WERE TO BE SINGLED OUT, ALL THEIR 
CROATIAN FELLOW STUDENTS STEPPED OUT TO JOIN THEM.

THIS IS ONE OF NUMEROUS CASES INDICATING THAT 
ANTI-SEMITISM DURING THE USTASHA REGIME WAS THE 
PRODUCT OF HITLER'S NEW EUROPEAN ORDER. 
 
AS AN HISTORIAN, I HAVE DEVOTED MANY PAGES OF MY 
BOOKS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE HORRORS OF VIOLENCE 
SUFFERED BY THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN RECENT HISTORY.  TO 
MY GREAT REGRET, PARTS OF MY BOOK "WASTELANDS OF 
HISTORICAL REALITY" HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED EITHER 
AS HISTORICAL REVISIONISM OR AS ANTI-SEMITISM.  AS A 
FORMER ANTI-FASCIST FIGHTER AND A COMMITTED 
DEMOCRAT, I REFUTE ALL INTENTIONS OF THE KIND. 
 
THE OBJECTIVITY OF MY CONVICTION IS CONFIRMED TODAY 
BY RELATIONS BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC CROATIA WITH THE 
JEWISH COMMUNITY, BY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE JEWISH 
COMMUNITY TO THE CREATION OF A NEW DEMOCRATIC AND 
INDEPENDENT REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, AS WELL AS BY ITS 
PARTICIPATION IN THE MANY EFFORTS INTENDED TO EASE 
AND ELIMINATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BLOODY WAR 
AGAINST MY COUNTRY.  IT IS ALSO CONFIRMED BY THE 
EVER GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THE WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT OF 
SUCH DISTINGUISHED JEWISH INTELLECTUALS AS ALAIN 
FINKIELKRUT AND ANDRE GLUSKSMAN, REGARDING 
CROATIA'S INALIENABLE RIGHT TO INDEPENDENCE, AS WELL 
AS THE AID THAT MANY JEWS AND JEWISH ORGANISATIONS 
HAVE OFFERED AND GIVEN TO WAR-TORN CROATIA.

TUDJMAN TO EDGAR BRONFMAN, PRESIDENT OF WORLD JEWISH 
CONGRESS.  BEGIN TEXT: 
 
NATIONAL MINORITIES GUARANTEE THE COMPREHENSIVE 
DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESS OF MINORITIES AND CITIZENS, 
AND THEIR COMPLETE PROTECTION.  THE JEWISH COMMUNITY 
IN CROATIA WILL CONTINUE TO ENJOY, AS IT HAS IN THE 
PAST, ALL THE RELIGIOUS AND NATIONAL RIGHTS ENJOYED 
BY OTHER COMMUNITIES, AND THIS IS ALSO EVINCED BY 
THE INITIATIVE TAKEN BY THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT AND 
MYSELF TO REBUILD THE ZAGREB SYNAGOGUE, WHICH WAS 
DESTROYED BY THE USTASHA REGIME. 
 
MANY JEWS HOLD POSITIONS OF IMPORTANCE IN CROATIAN 
PUBLIC LIFE, AND WE WISH, BY THE SAME TOKEN, TO 
ESTABLISH COMPREHENSIVE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WITH 
THE STATE OF ISRAEL.

BUIDING OF A NEW AND BETTER UORLD.  WITH THIS

OF PEACE, FREEDOM, INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY.
