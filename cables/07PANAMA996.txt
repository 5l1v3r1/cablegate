SUBJECT: PANAMA: FM SATISFIED WITH TIP REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 78794 
 
¶1.  (SBU) "The 2007 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report does 
not look too different from last year's report.  That is good 
to see," said First Vice President and Foreign Minister 
Samuel Lewis after Ambassador delivered reftel demarche on 
June 11.  Ambassador noted the report acknowledged positive 
steps Panama had taken to fight trafficking, including the 
first conviction of a TIP-related offender and an ongoing 
public awareness campaign.  Lewis said it was good to see 
that Panama received a Tier Two rating again this year. 
(Note: Panama first appeared in the TIP report in 2004 and 
has received a Tier Two rating since then.  End note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador discussed ways Panama could continue to 
improve its anti-trafficking record, including dedicating 
additional resources and ending the alternadora visa program. 
 Lewis did not comment on these ideas.  He said he 
appreciated receiving an advance copy of the report, and 
anticipated there would be significant press coverage of it. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: Trafficking continues to be a sensitive 
subject for Panama.  Lewis' relief at having missed Tier Two 
Watchlist status was apparent.  Post will continue to engage 
with the GOP on this issue, using the progress noted in the 
2007 report as a departure point for additional efforts and 
cooperation.
