¶1.  (U) Mission France received December 1 a letter (pouched to 
EUR/ERA) from Council of Europe (COE) Parliamentary Assembly 
(PACE) President de Puig asking us to forward a letter from de 
Puig to President Obama regarding Copenhagen. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin text: 
 
Strasbourg, 30 November 2009 
 
Dear President, 
 
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has been 
deeply committed for many years to discussions on mitigating 
climate change.  Our unique membership of 47 European states, 
including the Russian Federation, meant that during the 
negotiation on the Kyoto Protocol, we were able to exert 
valuable influence on the settlement that finally led to the 
Protocol's entry into force. 
 
This December in Copenhagen the world is facing a new challenge. 
 We all know what is at stake for the future of our planet and 
it is therefore of major importance for the First World 
countries to lead the way. 
 
For this reason, at its meeting on 23 November 2009, the 
Committee on the Environment, asked me to write to you to 
respectfully urge you, above all, with your unique position, to 
take the lead and help to maximize the likelihood of an 
agreement by personally attending the Copenhagen Summit and 
giving your full support to the difficult but critical decisions 
that hopefully will be made in Denmark. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
/ s / 
 
Luis Maris de Puig 
 
H.E. Mr. Barack Obama 
President of the United States of America
