SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN CHECK ON LICENSE APPLICATION 
050128842 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in contacting 
appropriate GOE officials regarding a proposed export of 
torpedo parts to the Ecuador Navy (DDTC license 050128842). 
Post is requested to deliver this action message within 14 
days, or as soon as possible. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: license application 050128842 was 
denied on 26 November 2008 because of the Foreign 
Intermediate Consignee involved in the transaction, Spanish 
company Commerce International Group Ltd. (CIG Ltd.).  Based 
upon credible information, the Department concluded that CIG 
Ltd. is not a reliable recipient of United States Munitions 
List (USML) items and may not be a party to any defense trade 
transaction subject to control under the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  It needs to be 
clarified, however, that the proposed sale of torpedo parts 
to the Ecuador Navy is not problematic.  Without the 
involvement of CIG Ltd., the license application would most 
likely have been approved.  PM/DTCC is therefore requesting 
post assistance to inform the Ecuador Navy about this 
clarification.  U.S. applicant Ordnance Technology Service 
Inc. has already been informed of this matter. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Ecuador Navy, or other 
appropriate Ecuador military officials, and inform them about 
the reason why this license application was denied.  Post 
should advise the Ecuador Navy that an export request for the 
same commodities would be favorably considered if supported 
by a direct purchase order with the U.S. applicant of the 
denied case, or another U.S. supplier.  The use of Foreign 
Consignees other than CIG Ltd. is also acceptable.  Finally, 
post may wish to recommend the Ecuador military to exercise 
caution in any future contact with CIG Ltd., and make clear 
that any U.S. defense exports to Ecuador involving CIG will 
likely be denied.  END ACTION.
