¶1.  On June 24 the Embassy presented the movie ""Human Trafficking,"" in cooperation with the International Organization of Migration (IOM) and Chile's Investigative Police (PDI).  The film was shown at the Police Academy as part of the PDI's annual anniversary activities.  The audience consisted of about 750 police officers, human rights workers, prosecutors, academics and social workers. Prior to the start of the movie, Ximena Castillo, the PDI's Director of the National Office of Crimes Against the Family explained the crime of trafficking in persons (TIP).  The DCM then highlighted the 	USG commitment to fighting TIP, and the crucial rule of international and inter-agency cooperation.  IOM's VivianaMellado echoed the DCM's words on the importance of international cooperation.  IOM and the PDI followed the film with a forum on the problem of TIP in Chile that included a lively question and answer session. 

Comment 
------- 

¶2.  Over the past three years, IOM, PDI, and Chilean Congresswoman Saa, with the support of local NGOs, Post, and a few proactive prosecutors, have diligently pursued education programs, victim rehabilitation and TIP investigations.  Two years ago an event like this would have drawn about 15 individuals, but now the issue has received enough attention that people are beginning to wonder what TIP is and how best to combat it.  The PDI sent their entire class of 400 new recruits and numerous detectives from across different crime bureaus.  The event has generated interest from other institutions that would like to show the film in-house, such as Gendarmeria (national prison guards), Carabineros (national uniformed police), and several NGOs.  While Chile still lacks a law that criminalizes all forms of TIP, individual agencies and NGOs are seeking to equip the country to do what it can to combat the problem.
