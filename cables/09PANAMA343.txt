Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)  Panamanian President Martin Torrijos has agreed 
to allow U.S. Navy assets to patrol Panama's territorial 
waters on counter-narcotics missions. Torrijos asked the 
Ambassador April 15 for Embassy assistance organizing a 
DEA-funded "Operation Together" (Operacion Conjuntos) 
featuring U.S. Navy vessels and National Aero-Naval Service 
(SENAN) vessels operating off the Pacific coast S/E of the 
Darien village of Jaque beginning some time after the May 3 
elections until the end of Torrijos' administration on June 
¶30. Torrijos told the Ambassador that he wanted to conduct an 
operation before the end of his administration, in part to 
underscore the close cooperation with the U.S. he sees as one 
of the major achievements of his administration, and in part 
to create a precedent that will allow the operations to 
continue under the incoming administration without a major 
decision having to be taken. We welcome his decision on both 
counts. The immediate aim of the mission would be to close 
the coastal drug trafficking corridor near the Colombian 
boarder, a point where the FARC's 57th Front is active. This 
would simultaneously reduce the flow of drugs to Mexico and 
the U.S., while putting financial pressure on the FARC 57th 
elements in Panama engaged in drug trafficking. The latter 
would support moves by the GOP to reduce the FARC's operating 
space in the Darien, and encourage the growing demobilization 
trend among 57th Front members in Panama (septel).

Torrijos Authorizes Gray Hulls 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  President Torrijos told the Ambassador April 15 
that he was prepared to allow U.S. Navy (gray hull) frigates 
with Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) embarked aboard, to 
enter Panama's territorial waters (TTW) to engage in 
counter-narcotics patrols under the terms of the Salas-Becker 
Agreement (SBA). Under the terms of SBA, only USCG cutters 
(white hulls) are allowed to enter Panama's TTW to performs 
counter-narcotics patrols, but the agreement contains a 
clause, Article 20, which allows U.S. Navy assets to be used 
in the same role if the GOP so requests. Up to now the GOP 
has always declined to make that request, arguing that 
sensitivities among some Panamanians towards operating with 
the U.S. military would make such a move controversial (see 
REFTEL A). Torrijos told the Ambassador that he would 
instruct the Minster of Government and Justice, Dilio Arcia, 
to write a letter to the Embassy formally requesting the 
assistance. The stated reason would be to help Panama's 
National Aero-Naval Service (SENAN) "develop the capacity to 
protect Panama's territorial waters and to prepare for 
PANAMAX ALPHA." (Note: PANAMAX ALPHA is a GOP interagency 
crisis coordinating exercises carried out at the same time as 
the PANAMAX exercise. End Note) 
 
------------------ 
Taking on the FARC 
------------------ 
 
¶3.  (S//NF)  Torrijos told the Ambassador that he was taking 
this decision because he wants to cut off FARC 57th Front 
ring-leader Luis Fernando Mora's (AKA Silver) access to 
profits from drug trafficking on the Darien's Pacific Coast. 
Torrijos believes, as do we, that the 57th Front is under 
pressure from desertions and bad morale. He wants to 
capitalize on this opening to weaken the 59th Front, with the 
goal of ridding the Darien of FARC elements. 
 
------------------------ 
Importance of Gray Hulls 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (S//NF))   The Joint Inter-Agency Task Force - South's 
(JIATF-S) ability to use U.S. Navy assets in Panama's TTW 
remains key to its ability to patrol Panama's coastal waters 
due to a shortage of USCG cutters. The Navy ships patrol 
under JIATF-S's command with embarked USCG Law Enforcement 
Detachments (LEDETs). When USCG cutters patrol Panama's TTW, 
they usually do so with Panamanian SENAN officers on board as 
"ship riders." Under the Salas-Becker Agreement, these 
officers are nominally in control of the ship while in 
Panamanian TTW, though they in fact usually just observe. 
Torrijos specifically agreed to the idea that the U.S. Navy 
ships have LEDETs and "ship riders" on board when patrolling 
Panama's TTW. This will be the first time the GOP has 
authorized SENAN officers to act as "ship riders" on U.S. 
Navy assets.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  Torrijos' decision is another clear indication 
that the GOP is serious about taking steps to weaken the FARC 
presence in Panama. As with the recent hand-over of three 
FARC members to the U.S. under charges of "providing material 
support to a terrorist organization," (see REFTEL B), this 
agreement is the product of the Ambassador's ongoing 
discussions with VP/FM Samuel Lewis and President Torrijos on 
improving the security situation in the Darien. These changes 
in policy, and more that will be reported septel, are the 
result of the trust the GOP has that the USG is a good faith 
partner in Panama's struggle to improve the security 
situation in the Darien without violating Panamanian 
sovereignty or ignoring its stated policies. Post believes 
that Torrijos' decisions are laying the basis for continued 
enhanced cooperation with the next government, and that 
together with Post's "whole of government" approach to 
improving governance in the Darien, can make a real 
difference in the security situation by denying the FARC and 
DTOs safehaven in the Darien. Bringing the "gray hulls" in 
before the end of the Torrijos administration is particularly 
important, to avoid forcing an early and potentially divisive 
discussion over this issue in the incoming administration. We 
intend to present the presence of U.S. Navy gray hulls in 
Panamanian TTW to the new government as established practice. 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  Additionally, by overcoming a major Panamanian 
taboo over allowing U.S. military ships patrol Panama's 
waters, Torrijos is giving the USG a valuable new tool that 
could lead to the disruption of the Central American coastal 
drug trafficking route, the most important drug trafficking 
route today. With the added assets that the "gray hulls" will 
give JIATF-S, we have a real chance to ease pressure on 
Mexico and the other Central American countries that are 
suffering under the secondary effects of the coastal route. 
Coastal drug trafficking is increasing the presence of 
organized crime in Panama and throughout Central America 
because it requires the establishment of support networks 
throughout the region. Post will work with JIATF-S and DEA to 
pressure the cartels to abandon a drug trafficking route that 
is putting in jeopardy the stability of several Central 
American countries.
