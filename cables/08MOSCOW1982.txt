The MFA informed us that FM Lavrov would attend the 63rd 
session of UNGA but that no decision had yet been made 
whether Medvedev would attend.  We will provide Lavrov's 
arrival and departure dates and alert the Department to other 
high-level Russian attendees as this information becomes 
available.
