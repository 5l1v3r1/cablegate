Poloff conveyed reftel points on 9/1 to MFA Subdirector 
General for the Middle East Alberto Moreno.  Moreno said that 
he understood that the September 10 Preparatory Group meeting 
in Abu Dhabi had been cancelled, but if it were to take place 
Spain would be represented by the Spanish Ambassador to the 
UAE and a working level representative from the MFA. 
Regarding the 9/18 Iraq Compact briefing on the margins of 
the UNGA, Moreno said FM Miguel Angel Moratinos would 
represent Spain if he arrived in time to attend (Moratinos is 
scheduled to travel to New York that day, but his precise 
arrival time is not certain).  Moratinos will be accompanied 
by MFA Director General for the Middle East and Africa Alvaro 
Iranzo.  If Moratinos does not arrive in time to attend the 
briefing, Spain will be represented by the Spanish permanent 
representative to the UN Juan Antonio Yanez Barnuevo.  Moreno 
said he had been unaware of the 9/18 meeting in Singapore on 
the margins of the IMF/World Bank.  Econoff contacted the 
Ministry of Finance and was informed that Finance Minister 
Pedro Solbes and Bank of Spain President Miguel Angel 
Fernandez Ordonez would be leading a large Spanish delegation 
to the IMF/World Bank meeting.  It is not yet certain who 
would represent Spain at the Iraq Compact meeting in 
Singapore, but Finance Ministry contacts promised to provide 
that information as soon as it was available.  Post will 
relay any further information as it develops.
