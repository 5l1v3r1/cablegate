"Third Defeat" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (7/3) 
editorialized: "In a victory for the rule of Law and democracy, the 
US Supreme Court declared illegal the military courts created by 
President George W. Bush to judge suspects of terrorism in 
Guantanamo.... It is the third consecutive defeat the Bush 
administration has suffered on this issue in the Supreme Court, 
which had already determined that those arrested [in Guantanamo] 
have the right to be heard in US courts and cannot be indefinitely 
kept imprisoned without formal accusation.... The Supreme Court's 
decisions regarding the prisoners have once again proved the vigor 
of democracy in the US, a regime that can survive ignominies such as 
the September 11 attacks and Bush's excesses."
