SAYS WHO 
 
REF: SANAA 1304 
 
On May 31 UN officials announced that the number of polio 
cases in Yemen has risen to 179, including 71 new cases in 
less than a week.  A vaccination campaign was launched on May 
30 and should bring the outbreak under control, says the UN. 
Dr. David Heyman, the World Health Organization's polio 
chief, said the agency had anticipated a jump in cases.  The 
WHO called the Yemen outbreak a major epidemic on May 25, 
when it said the number of polio cases had risen to 108.  It 
is investigating hundreds of more suspected cases.
