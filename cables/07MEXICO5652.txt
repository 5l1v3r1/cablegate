SIPDIS 
Security and Legal Issues Julian Juarez Cardenas. Juarez said 
that while Mexico respects the U.S. position, the GOM will 
support the UNGA resolution condemning the U.S. economic 
embargo against Cuba and plans to offer an intervention 
backing this position.  The GOM believes the embargo has a 
negative impact on Cuba's economy and society without 
achieving its stated objectives.  Mexico objects to bilateral 
sanctions and the extraterritorial nature of the embargo, 
which he said can negatively impact Mexican companies. 
Juarez added the GOM would not issue an Explanation of Vote, 
and concluded by saying that Mexico does not vote for or 
against countries, but rather on the merits of resolutions.
