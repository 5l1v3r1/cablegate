Â¶1.  (U)  In response to reftel demarche on the draft revised terms 
of reference for the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
(GICNT), David McDuff, Senior Policy Officer in the 
Nonproliferation and Nuclear Disarmament Division of the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), expressed 
appreciation and noted that Canada had also received the draft from 
the Russian Embassy in Ottawa.   McDuff observed that the revised 
Terms of Reference should help to clarify the structure of the 
initiative.  McDuff said that he and his DFAIT colleagues were 
looking forward to the report from the Canadian representative to 
the Exercise Planning Meeting that took place on January 19 in 
Budapest, which should help DFAIT shape Canada's approach to the 
initiative and determine what expertise Canada can offer.
