SUBJECT: ANOTHER ANC DEFECTION TO COPE IN KWAZULU NATAL 
 
REF: DURBAN 9 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Another senior African National Congress 
member in KwaZulu Natal announced his defection to the Congress 
of the People.   Siyanda Mhlongo -- until yesterday the head of 
policy for the ANC in KwaZulu Natal and former Mayor of 
KwaDukuza -- announced his resignation from the ANC, citing 
"high levels of corruption" and "moral decay" in the party as 
his main motivation.  The move was not surprising: Mhlongo is a 
known Thabo Mbeki supporter and has been an outspoken critic of 
current ANC leadership.   End summary. 
 
Announcement at Packed News Conference 
 
¶2. (U) Mr. Siyanda Mhlongo, head of policy for the ANC in KZN, 
announced his resignation from the ANC and move to COPE at a 
well-attended press conference in Durban on January 22, 2009. 
Mhlongo cited "high levels of corruption" and "moral decay" in 
the ANC as the main reasons for his decision, but noted that the 
ANC's determination to help Jacob Zuma "dodge his day in court" 
also was a factor.  Mhlongo said that Zuma must "answer many 
questions" either in court or in public. 
 
¶3. (U) Mhlongo told the press conference, "there is no permanent 
marriage in politics and sentiments are secondary to 
principles."  He said that he "had a conversation with his moral 
conscience" and decided that he could no longer identify with 
the ANC.  Mhlongo added that he was targeted by senior leaders 
of the ANC in KZN because he spoke out against corruption.  As a 
result, he was persecuted by the ANC, through disciplinary 
actions and a brief expulsion from the party, he alleged. 
 
¶4. (U) Mhlongo also revealed that the ANC this week recalled 
Sduduzo Gumede, the Mayor of his hometown, KwaDukuza--because 
the ANC suspected Gumede of being a member of COPE.  Mhlongo 
defended the mayor, saying he was hard-working and a 
"corruption-buster" in a municipality that suffered from 
mismanagement and financial irregularities under its previous 
municipal manager.  He claimed that the mayor's sacking was 
further evidence of ANC resolve to "purge all those who are 
fighting corruption" and who supported Mbeki at the Polokwane 
ANC conference. 
 
¶5. (U) Mlungisi Hlongwane, COPE's National Head of Elections, 
and Lucky Gabela, Provincial Chairperson of COPE in KZN (Reftel) 
welcomed Mhlongo's defection to COPE. Mr. Gabela announced that 
Mr. Mhlongo will be the new spokesperson for COPE in KZN. 
 
ANC Unconcerned 
 
¶6. (SBU) ANC Provincial Spokesperson Nomfundo Mcetshwa told 
Pol-Econ Assistant that the ANC is not surprised by Mhlongo's 
resignation and his departure is not a cause for concern.  The 
party had suspected him of working underground on behalf of 
COPE, she explained.  She also revealed that Mhlongo was 
expected to face a disciplinary hearing January 23, 2009 for 
"absconding from work" for several months without a valid 
reason. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment.  Despite the ANC's posture, Mhlongo's 
resignation from the ANC to join COPE was an embarrassment, 
given that KZN province is considered the most united behind 
Zuma.  Although Mr. Mhlongo was an outspoken and experienced 
member of the ANC, he was disliked by many ANC members because 
of his support for Mbeki at Polokwane (his local branch of the 
ANC was the only one in KZN to support Mbeki over Zuma) and his 
continued public criticism of ANC leadership for not addressing 
corruption.  For these reasons, and as the ANC noted, his 
defection comes as no great surprise.  It will be interesting to 
see whether he will be able to bring other senior members of ANC 
in the province over to COPE's side.
