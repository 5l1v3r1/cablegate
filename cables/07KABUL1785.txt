SUBJECT: REGULATING PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES: NEED  FOR 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT 
 
REF: KABUL 1679 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following the recent DIAG meeting at which 
President Karzai highlighted perceived problems with 
unlicensed Private Security Companies (reftel), the 
Policy Action  Group on May 17 further reviewed the 
situation with the international community.  Deputy 
Minister of Interior Khalid and head of the DIAG 
Disarmament and Reintegration Commission Stanekzai 
argued that although there are 59 PSCs registered with 
the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency, many of 
these are not actually legitimate businesses.  At the 
moment there is no procedure for registering weapons, 
completing background checks on individuals, or even 
verifying the bona fides of the companies, they said. 
Former Minister Stanekzai added that the GOA 
recognizes the need to provide adequate protection for 
persons and property at a level higher than that which 
the Afghan National Police is capable of providing. 
However, he argued the need to ensure accountability 
and transparency through appropriate licensing and 
regulation of these companies. The representative of 
the National Directorate of Security (NDS) told the 
PAG that in his agency,s view many of these companies 
are controlled by drug smugglers, criminals, or 
warlords.  The NDS estimates that 70 percent of the 
crimes committed in Kabul involve these companies. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Wood commented that it is 
important for public safety and order to know who has 
weapons.  It is also the case that there is a 
legitimate demand by banks and foreign investors who 
need robust security.  Regulation is necessary but a 
balance must be kept so that these companies are not 
forced out of operation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) After further discussion and interventions by 
the UK Ambassador and COMISAF that generally supported 
Ambassador Wood,s points, it was decided that the 
issue should be referred to a Working Group, to 
include relevant Ministries and international 
community members.  That group met on May 27. 
Attendees were presented with a draft regulation that 
had been put together by a previous working group. The 
international representatives quickly determined that 
the document, while a good first step, lacked 
essential provisions and needed revision of most 
others to protect the impartiality, transparency, and 
accountability of the regulatory process.  It was 
decided that after an official translation has been 
prepared and circulated, comments would be submitted 
in writing and the Working Group would meet again 
within a short period to finalize a revised draft. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Separately, polmiloff and RSOs met with 
representatives of two Private Security Companies who 
described the difficulties they have encountered 
operating in Afghanistan.  They described an 
environment in which foreign-owned PSCs have trouble 
getting licenses without paying fees far in excess of 
prescribed amounts, companies are unable to gain 
permission for the use of weapons that are needed for 
their mission (especially in the South), and 
legitimate locally-engaged security guards have been 
arrested and remain in jail because the documents 
issued by one part of the MOI are not recognized by 
another part.  The company representatives said they 
strongly support a new regulation, but it must be 
transparent, clear, and non-discriminatory. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  Clearly there is a vital need for 
regulation, but it must be carefully drafted so that 
it will protect legitimate businesses while

forestalling the criminal elements and political power 
brokers who use PSCs as their own militia forces. 
Post, in coordination with CSTC-A and other members of 
the international community, will engage closely with 
the GOA in revising the draft regulation until it 
reaches an acceptable standard.  Since President 
Karzai is seized with the need to solve this issue and 
it has been tasked by the PAG, we are hopeful that we 
can fairly quickly reach agreement on an acceptable 
draft.  While difficulties in implementation will 
remain, approving the regulation will be an important 
step forward in resolving this problem.
