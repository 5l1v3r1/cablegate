AFGHANISTAN, INCREASE CIV SUPPORT 
 
REF: STATE 6355 
 
¶1. (SBU) Latvian MFA Security Policy Director Kaspars Ozolins 
confirmed that Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins will attend 
the London Conference on Afghanistan, January 28, where he 
will formally announce an increase of two additional Latvian 
police officers (supplementing one already deployed) and the 
provision of a small civilian development contribution of 
10,000 Latvian lats (about 20,000 USD). He said the funds 
will likely be used to provide training to criminal 
investigators or judges, following up on the Latvian 
construction of three courthouses in Faryab province. 
Ozolins appreciated receipt of reftel points, and said that 
Latvia would continue to strongly support the U.S. position 
on Afghanistan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  In spite of Latvia's severe economic 
contraction (the loss of over 20% in GDP over the last two 
years), the government remains committed to sustain its 
existing contribution of 170 troops who serve without caveats 
both in Faryab and Jalalabad.  Despite squabbles within the 
ruling coalition government over the budget and agreements 
with foreign lenders, the Foreign Ministry and Defense 
Ministry share a strong desire to demonstrate international 
responsibility and continued solidarity with the United 
States on Afghanistan.
