SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING-LEBANON 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning updates information on security 
threats and ongoing political violence in Lebanon and 
informs U.S. citizens of current safety and security 
concerns.  The Department of State continues to urge that 
Americans avoid all travel to Lebanon.  Americans who live 
and work in Lebanon presently should understand that they 
are accepting risks in remaining and should carefully 
consider those risks, especially those in Tripoli.  This 
supersedes the Travel Warning for Lebanon issued on May 30, 
¶2008. 
 
¶2.   Recent clashes in the northern city of Tripoli have 
resulted in more than twenty deaths and numerous injuries. 
Additionally, a bomb exploded next to a city bus in Tripoli 
on August 13, 2008 and killed fourteen people.  The U.S. 
Embassy advises U.S. citizens against all travel to 
Lebanon, and recommends that U.S. citizens presently in 
Lebanon consider the risks of remaining, particularly in 
Tripoli in light of recent incidents there. 
 
¶3.  On May 7, 2008, Hizballah militants blocked the road to 
Rafiq Hariri International Airport.  The action rendered 
the airport inaccessible and travelers were unable to enter 
or leave the country via commercial air carriers.  Armed 
Hizballah and other opposition members proceeded to enter 
areas of Lebanon not traditionally under their control 
resulting in heavy fighting and a number of casualties. 
While there is now full access to the airport and 
widespread hostilities have subsided, the United States is 
concerned about Hizballah's willingness to use violence to 
achieve political ends with little or no warning. 
¶4.  The threat of anti-Western terrorist activity exists in 
Lebanon; groups such as Al-Qaeda and Jund al-Sham are 
present in the country and have issued statements calling 
for attacks against Western interests in the past. 
¶5.  U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon or resident in 
Lebanon should be aware that the U.S. Embassy has limited 
ability to reach all areas of Lebanon.  The Embassy cannot 
guarantee that Embassy employees can render assistance to 
U.S. citizens in all areas of the country.  Furthermore, in 
the event that the security climate in the country worsens, 
American citizens should be aware that they will bear the 
responsibility of arranging their own travel out of 
Lebanon.  American citizens with special medical or other 
needs should be aware of the risks of remaining given their 
condition and be prepared to be treated in Lebanon if they 
cannot arrange for travel out of the country. 
¶6.  U.S. Government-facilitated evacuations such as took 
place in 2006 occur only when no safe commercial 
alternatives exist.  Evacuation would be provided on a 
cost-recovery basis, which means the traveler must 
reimburse the U.S. government for the cost of the travel. 
The lack of valid travel documents (U.S. passport or U.S. 
visa, as appropriate) will slow the U.S. Embassy's ability 
to provide assistance.  Further information on the 
department's role during emergencies is provided at 
http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/emergenci es/emergen 
cies_1212.html 
¶7.  Landmines and unexploded ordnance continually pose 
significant dangers throughout southern Lebanon, 
particularly south of the Litani River, as well as in areas 
of the country where civil war fighting was intense. More 
than a dozen civilians have been killed and over 100 
injured by unexploded ordnance following the armed conflict 
in July-August 2006.  Travelers should watch for posted 
landmine warnings and strictly avoid all areas where 
landmines and unexploded ordnance may be present. 
¶8.  The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. 
government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to 
require them to live and work under strict security 
restrictions.  These practices limit, and may occasionally 
 
STATE 00097030  002 OF 002 
 
 
prevent, access by U.S. Embassy officials to certain areas 
of the country.  Unofficial travel to Lebanon by U.S. 
government employees and their family members requires 
prior approval by the Department of State. 
¶9.  The Embassy is located in Awkar, near Antelias, Beirut, 
Lebanon.  Public access hours for American citizens are 
Monday through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.; however, 
American citizens who require emergency services outside of 
these hours may contact the embassy by telephone at any 
time.  The telephone numbers are (961-4) 542-600, 543-600, 
and fax 544-209. 
¶10. American citizens may register with the embassy online 
by visiting https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/ui 
Americans are strongly encouraged to update their 
registration information if it is no longer current. 
Information on consular services and registration can also 
be found at http://lebanon.usembassy.gov or by phone at the 
above telephone numbers between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., 
Monday through Friday local time. 
¶11.  Updated information on travel and security in Lebanon 
may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1- 
888-407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, from 
overseas, 1-202-501-4444. Additional details can be found 
in the Department of State's Country Specific Information 
for Lebanon, and the Worldwide Caution, which are available 
on the Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶12.  Minimize considered.
