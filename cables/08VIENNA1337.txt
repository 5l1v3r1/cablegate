REF: STATE 96598 
 
¶1. (SBU) Polchief disussed reftel points September 10 with 
Klaus Famia, MFA European correspondent.  Famira offered the 
following views on the agenda items for the September 15-16 
GAERC: 
 
-- Georgia: EU members hope to approve the deployment of an 
ESDP mission to Georgia at the GAERC.  The mission could be 
up and running by October 1.  GAERC participants will also 
discuss the appointment of an EU special representative for 
Georgia. 
 
-- Somalia: GAERC participants will discuss both an ESDP 
mission to combat piracy off the Somali coast and the tense 
political situation in Somalia.  EU member states hope to 
reach a final decision on an ESDP mission by October or 
November.  The mission would provide naval escort for ships 
carrying World Food Program aid and other commercial vessels. 
 
-- Zimbabwe: Member states will agree to expand the list of 
individuals and enterprises  subject to sanctions including 
visa bans, travel restrictions, and the freezing of assets. 
There will also be a discussion of the political situation. 
The EU will welcome the resumption of talks and encourage the 
mediation effort being carried out by SADC.  The EU will also 
emphasize that any long-term solution will depend on African 
institutions. 
 
-- Serbia: Famira noted that ICTY Chief Prosecutor Brammertz 
was in Belgrade to evaluate Serbia's cooperation with the 
Tribunal.  If Brammertz issues a positive report, GAERC 
participants will consider whether to move forward on an 
interim SAA agreement on trade. 
 
-- Belarus: Famira said GAERC participants were scheduled to 
adopt conclusions on Belarus without holding a discussion. 
Nevertheless, he said there was increased interest in EU 
relations with Belarus in the wake of the Georgia conflict. 
There has been discussion in EU circles of a possible EU 
troika meeting with the Belarusian FM. 
 
-- Turkey: Famira said Turkey was not on the agenda. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Polchief also asked Famira about the outcome of the 
September 5-6 Gymnich.  Famira said there was considerable 
discussion on transatlantic relations.  The French submitted 
an eight-page paper outlining areas where U.S.-EU cooperation 
could be strengthened.  The Austrian view is that the Balkans 
-- which the French did not highlight in their paper -- 
provides the best example of transatlantic cooperation, and 
should serve as a model.  The full range of relevant 
institutions on both sides of the Atlantic have worked 
closely together throughout the Balkans crises, he said.
