SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In September 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of five Embassy registered property claims.  Three 
claimants also withdrew a total of six claims from the Embassy's 
database.  To date, the overwhelming majority of resolutions have 
involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds 
("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of September 30, 
2009, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of $359,823,109 to 
Embassy-registered claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, 
the Ortega administration has resolved 101 claims, six during the 
2009-2010 waiver year. 
 
EMBASSY REGISTERED CLAIMS RESOLVED IN SEPTEMBER 
--------------------------------------------- -- 

¶2. On September 24, 2009, the Attorney General's Office provided the 
Embassy a copy of the final settlement document or "finiquito" 
signed by the family of Octavio Bustamante on September 9, 2009. 
The heirs of Mr. Bustamante received BPIs worth 945,000 cordobas, 
approximately $45,899, to settle one claim.  We have updated our 
database to reflect this settlement.  Mr. Bustamante's claim had 
been previously dismissed under Decree 38 (1979), which authorized 
the GON to confiscate property belonging to the allies of the Somoza 
family.

cordobas, approximately $54,943, to settle two claims.  We have 
updated our database to reflect this settlement.  Mrs. Montoya's 
claims had been previously dismissed under Decree 38 (1979), which

the Somoza family.

cordobas, approximately $13,114, to settle one claim.  We have

Vanegas on September 1, 2009.  Mr. Vanegas received BPIs worth 
1,380,600 cordobas, approximately $67,056, to settle one claim.  We 
have updated our database to reflect this settlement.  The Consular 
Section revoked the U.S. nonimmigrant visa of the occupant of Mr. 
Vanegas' property, Francisco Lacayo Carajon (reftel), under Section 
2225 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998.

WITHDRAWN CLAIMS 
---------------- 

¶6. On September 24, 2009, U.S. citizen Paul Henry Gulke asked the 
Property Office to withdraw one claim from the list of Section 527 
claims kept by the Embassy Property Office.  Mr. Gulke withdrew the 
claim for stocks in a company known as CAISA because his shares were 
never confiscated. 
 
¶7.  On September 28, U.S. citizen Julio Montealegre asked the 
Property Office to withdraw four claims from the list of Section 527 
 
claims kept by the Property Office.  Mr. Montealegre withdrew three 
claims because the debt attached to the properties was higher than 
the compensation offered by the GON.  The fourth claim was withdrawn 
because it was never filed with the National Confiscations Review 
Commission. 
 
¶8.  On August 20, Jairo Poveda, legal representative of U.S. citizen 
claimant Jose Poveda, asked the Property Office to withdraw one 
claim from the list of Section 527 claims kept by the Property 
Office.  Mr. Jose Poveda acknowledged that he did not own the 
property.
