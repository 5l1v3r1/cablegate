SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON INTERNATIONAL 
WHALING COMMISSION (IWC) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 57020 
 
¶1. (U) On June 9, Econoff delivered reftel demarche to 
Steadman Fagoth, Nicaragua's International Whaling Commission 
(IWC) Commissioner and Executive President of the National 
Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture (INPESCA).  Fagoth has 
not decided if he will attend the IWC's 2009 annual meeting 
(IWC61), June 22-26 in Madeira, Portugal.  Sandinista (FSLN) 
National Assembly Deputy Edwin Castro is Nicaragua's 
Alternate Commissioner. 

¶2. (SBU) Fagoth was unprepared to discuss IWC business and 
was unaware of the dates of IWC61.  He did not have answers 
to reftel questions and stated that he planned to meet with 
Alternate Commissioner Edwin Castro within one week to 
discuss Nicaragua's positions.  At this time, Nicaragua does 
not have a suggestion as to who the next IWC Chair and 
Vice-Chair should be. 

¶3. (U) Fagoth said that Nicaragua opposes whaling, except for 
aboriginal subsistence.  At last year's IWC in Chile, 
Nicaragua did not support the Japanese pro-whaling position 
as it had in the past.  As a result, Fagoth added, Japan cut 
its aid to Nicaragua's fisheries sector.  When asked 
specifically about his voting plans for IWC61, he admitted 
that Nicaragua's position remained undecided and that it 
could change if political considerations dictated. 

¶4. (U) Fagoth added that Nicaragua is interested in promoting 
tourism and is seeking guidance from the IWC regarding 
whale-watching.
