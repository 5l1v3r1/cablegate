¶1.  (U)  This is an action request, please see paragraph 2. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassadors are asked to approach host governments 
at the highest appropriate level to pursue the following 
objective: 
 
-- Establish firm host government commitments to deploy an 
(additional) battalion to reinforce the African Union Mission 
in Somalia (AMISOM) in the wake of Ethiopia's withdrawal from 
Somalia, tentatively planned for January 5, 2009. 
 
-- Determine the level of equipment and other logistical 
support that will be necessary in order for host government 
to deploy to Somalia. 
 
-- Inform host government of the USG timeline necessary to 
provide equipment to forces deploying to Somalia. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶3. (U) On December 22, the African Union's Peace and Security 
Council (PSC) agreed to extend AMISOM's current mandate for 
two months, effective 16 January, 2009, and also asked the AU 
Commission to work closely with the Government of Ethiopia to 
ensure that the planned withdrawal of Ethiopian forces from 
Somalia is closely coordinated with AMISOM to avoid a 
security vacuum.  Council members noted the readiness of 
Uganda, Burundi, and Nigeria to deploy one battalion each to 
AMISOM, subject to salary support, equipment, and logistical 
support.  While the USG could provide equipment and 
logistical support, it does not pay salaries.  The Department 
is currently working with the EU to support the salaries of 
the three additional battalions.  It was also reported in an 
earlier donors, meeting that Algeria had offered 10 aircraft 
to assist AU troop contributors with deploying their 
contingents to Mogadishu. 
 
 
TALKING POINTS 
-------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassies Kampala and Bujumbura may wish to draw 
from the following suggested talking points: 
 
-- We have been following closely the events in Addis over 
the past several days and wish to coordinate with you over 
the reinforcement of AMISOM. 
 
-- Your government has indicated its willingness to deploy a 
trained 850-man battalion to AMISOM.  We commend your offer 
to send (additional) troops and are ready to assist your 
government by providing urgent equipment items and logistical 
support to this battalion.  Our equipment funds are limited, 
and the USG may not be able to provide all of the requested 
equipment. 
 
-- Providing equipment for your designated battalion prior to 
the Ethiopian withdrawal date of 5 January will be 
problematic for us.  Our contractors require 3-4 months to 
procure many types of peacekeeping equipment.  Vehicles, in 
particular, are difficult for our contractors to procure 
quickly. 
-- We are prepared, however, to deploy any forces that your 
government is willing to deploy before the full delivery of 
all USG-procured equipment.  While this is not an optimal 
solution, we believe that our contractors may have sufficient 
contract aircraft available to move your troops into 
Mogadishu beginning the first week of January.  Equipment for 
the partially equipped battalion can be delivered to 
Mogadishu piecemeal over the following 4 months. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Embassy Abuja may wish to draw from the following 
suggested talking points: 
 
-- We have been following closely the events in Addis over 
the past several days and wish to coordinate with you over 
 
STATE 00134421  002 OF 002 
 
 
the reinforcement of AMISOM. 
 
-- Your government has indicated its willingness to deploy a 
trained 850-man battalion to AMISOM.  We commend your offer 
to send troops to AMISOM and are ready to assist your 
government by providing up to $3 million in urgent equipment 
items, as well as logistical support, to this battalion. 
 
-- Providing equipment for your designated battalion prior to 
the Ethiopian withdrawal date of 5 January will be 
problematic for us.  Our contractors require 3-4 months to 
procure many types of peacekeeping equipment.  Vehicles, in 
particular, are difficult for our contractors to procure 
quickly. 
-- We are prepared, however, to deploy any forces that your 
government is willing to deploy before the full delivery of 
all USG-procured equipment.  While this is not an optimal 
solution, we believe that our contractors may have sufficient 
contract aircraft available to move your troops into 
Mogadishu beginning the first week of January.  Equipment for 
the partially equipped battalion can be delivered to 
Mogadishu piecemeal over the following 4 months. 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Embassy Algiers may use the following: 
 
--  It has been reported to us that your government has 
offered to assist with the airlift of additional troop 
contingents to AMISOM. 
 
--  We are currently engaging the Governments of Uganda, 
Burundi, and Nigeria to each send an additional 850-man 
infantry battalion. 
 
--  We request that you make available the required number of 
aircraft, aircrew, and fuel to move these additional 
battalions to Mogadishu as early as the first week of January.
