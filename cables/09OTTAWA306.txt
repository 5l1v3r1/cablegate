¶1. (SBU) Further to reftel, Canada will decide in the next 
few weeks which candidate it will support for the 
Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC), according to 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
human rights senior policy advisor Cyndy Nelson.  Nelson told 
acting Pol/C on April 17 that most of the key DFAIT decision 
makers are currently away on travel related to the Summit of 
the Americas, as well as follow-on travel in the region with 
Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon.  She added that DFAIT will 
be begin preparing in earnest for the OAS General Assembly in 
the next two weeks, including deciding which IAHRC candidate 
to support. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Nelson was effusive in her praise for Dr. Shelton, 
saying that Canada "looked very favorably on her candidacy." 
She added that her credentials are "very impressive with lots 
of professional and academic experience" in the subject 
matter and region.  She commented as well that it was good to 
see the U.S. nominate a woman for the first time for the 
IAHRC.  Nelson promised to provide an official reply by the 
end of April, if not sooner.
