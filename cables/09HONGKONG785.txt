SUBJECT: HONG KONG H1N1 UPDATE - NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE 
 
REF: HONG KONG 0768 
 
¶1. (SBU) Hong Kong's preparedness level remains unchanged at 
an elevated Tier 2 or "Serious" response level for Pandemic 
Influenza (PI) (REFTEL) and Hong Kong health authorities 
continue to closely monitor arrivals at all border crossings 
and international terminals.  All arriving passengers transit 
passive infra-red screening for signs of elevated temperature 
or other illness.  There have been no reported confirmed or 
suspect cases of H1N1 in Hong Kong to date. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Hong Kong health authorities designated H1N1 as a 
reportable illness on April 27 and since then have placed 
seven individuals meeting the initial criteria in isolation 
pending further tests. Three of these individuals have been 
cleared, one of which was positive for human influenza 
subtype H3; four individuals remain in isolation pending H1N1 
test results.  Hong Kong authorities openly speculate the 
H1N1 outbreak will reach Hong Kong and are preparing the 
public for its arrival.  On April 28, Secretary for Health 
York Chow announced that if a student is found positive for 
H1N1, public schools will close.  He also noted that 1,400 
public hospital isolation beds have been prepared. Hong Kong 
media outlets are widely monitoring and reporting progress of 
the H1N1 outbreak and an advisory remains in effect 
recommending residents avoid non-essential travel to 
confirmed H1N1-reported areas. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.74% on Monday 
(April 27) and another 1.92% on Tuesday (April 28) as 
investors reduced exposure to the Hong Kong market.  These 
drops were in line with recent activity, however, and the 
market recovered some of the lost ground on Wednesday (April 
29) gaining 2.76%. Consulate General Hong Kong notes only 
limited anecdotal evidence that some Hong Kong residents are 
delaying or reconsidering travel to the U.S.; there has been 
no drop in visa or ACS services. Post will continue to 
closely monitor developments, and will remain in close 
contact with HKG officials and the local medical community.
