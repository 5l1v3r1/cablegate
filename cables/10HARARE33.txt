SUBJECT: IATA MEETING WITH SEC NAPOLITANO 
 
¶1. (SBU) Air Zimbabwe CEO Dr. Peter Chikumba requested a meeting 
with conoff on January 20 to relay his agenda in advance of a 
planned meeting at the International Air Transport Association's 
(IATA) offices in Geneva on January 22 with DHS Secretary 
Napolitano.  Chikumba, an aircraft engineer with 30 years of airline 
experience with Air Zimbabwe, Ethiopian Airlines, Air Namibia, and 
IATA, was invited by IATA Director General Bisignani to participate 
as an African representative in a meeting between airline CEOs and 
Secretary Napolitano to discuss the security challenges arising out 
of the December 25 attempted bombing of flight NW 253. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Foremost, Chikumba will stress the global, international 
scale of the issues.  In his opinion, passenger pre-screening and 
air transport security are international issues that require 
stronger international standards.  He said security issues affect 
all flights, not just those originating or departing from the U.S., 
and that he would support any effort to bolster ICAO regulations and 
IATA standards/practices.  He emphasized that stricter U.S. security 
standards were not the problem, rather the problem was that current 
international standards inadequately addressed U.S. concerns. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Chikumba remarked that the world must cease its practice of 
having different security practices for international, vice 
domestic, flights.  He said air travel had become so intertwined and 
international in nature that it no longer made sense to have two 
separate security standards.  He said he would support formulation 
of a single set of standards that covered both international and 
domestic flights.  In addition, he called on international adoption 
of a passenger pre-screening tool, such as the Advanced Passenger 
Information System (APIS). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Although Chikumba voiced support for more robust 
international security standards; he also voiced the need for 
additional funding.  He commented that the airlines did not have the 
resources to fund and operate effective security screening systems; 
rather, security screening should be the responsibility of 
individual (national) civil aviation authorities.  He called on 
aviation leaders (read U.S.) to lead the funding for more robust 
international processes and standards. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  Secretary Napolitano can expect flak from airline 
CEOs in regards to the U.S. emergency orders that arose following NW 
¶253.  In particular, Chikumba mentioned that many CEOs felt they 
could not support 100 percent pat-down searches over a long-term 
period.  That said, Chikumba's remarks reflect an international 
recognition of the global issues involved and an opportunity for the 
U.S. to press for tighter international screening standards and 
increased sharing of passenger data.  END COMMENT.
