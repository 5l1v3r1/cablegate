Mister President, 
 
It is a pleasant duty for me to extend to you my most 
heartfelt congratulations for your brilliant election to the 
highest office of the United States of America and to extend 
to you my best wishes for success as you carry out your 
future duties. 
 
Your resounding success the evening of November 4, 2008 
reflects both your exceptional qualities as a statesman and 
the exemplary character of American democracy.  It proves 
that the American dream is not an illusion, and that it can 
serve as a point of reference for all peoples who aspire to 
greater justice and equality. 
 
I am convinced that the entire world celebrated the American 
elections because you were a candidate and that your 
prospective victory could give rise to hope for legitimate 
change not only in the United States of America, but also for 
the advancement of  international relations. 
 
Will you accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Charles Konan Banny
