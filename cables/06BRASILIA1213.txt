Â¶1. Poloff delivered reftels' talking points to Marcelo Bohlke of the 
MFA's United Nations Division on June 16.  Bohlke, who will 
participate in the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red 
Crescent, reiterated that the GoB has already signed the third 
protocol and intends to support amending the Movement's statutes to 
include the Red Crystal and the Palestinian Red Crescent.  He added 
that the GoB prefers to include the amendments by consensus, as 
opposed to vote, as this will affect both the implementation and 
overall effectiveness of the new measures.  In spite of this 
support, Bohlke was unable to respond to the adjournment issue 
because the GoB, unaware of this potential scenario, did not have 
policy in place.  He did, however, highlight that "the GoB favors a 
decision, now".  He also, noted that he would bring the issue of 
adjournment to the attention of the GoB delegation.  Bohlke 
concluded by restating that the GoB wants to conclude the amendment 
process in accordance with the outcomes of the Geneva Conventions.
