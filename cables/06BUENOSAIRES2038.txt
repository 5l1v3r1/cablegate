 REF: STATE 147037 
  
 ¶1. (U)  Post delivered reftel talking points to Foreign 
 Ministry North America Director Ambassador Vicente Espeche 
 Gil, to Ministry of Economy Director for International 
 Organization Projects Gerardo Hita and to the Foreign 
 Ministry's CONAE (NASA-equivalent) Executive Director Conrado 
 Varotto. Prior to the IDB vote, the gist of these points had 
 been conveyed by Charge to Deputy Foreign Minister Roberto 
 Garcia Moriton. 
  
 ¶2. (SBU)  GoA officials took on board our points that the 
 U.S. no vote on the IDB satellite project does not/not 
 reflect a change in U.S. policy towards Argentina but rather 
 a belief that MDBs should focus their resources on countries' 
 more immediate development needs.  The GoA, however, appeared 
 not to accept this argument.  The Foreign Ministry took the 
 unusual step of issuing a September 6 public statement 
 expressing satisfaction with the IDB decision; regretting 
 views expressed by ""certain"" BID member countries; hoping for 
 an ""evolution"" in these member countries' views to recognize 
 the significant impact high technology efforts can have on 
 broad social and economic development objectives; and casting 
 the satellite project as an ambitious joint effort with Italy 
 that will contribute to the global catastrophe early warning 
 and prevention system.  CONAE's Varotto told Emboff the U.S. 
 vote ""will make my life difficult.""  He explained that, while 
 all of Argentina's space projects are designed to promote 
 economic and social development, this development message 
 will now be more difficult to convey to those in the GoA who 
 determine the space agency's budget. 
  
 ¶3. (SBU)  The media has uniformly cast this as a negative 
 vote and a negative signal from the United States to 
 Argentina, the result of tensions in the bilateral 
 relationship. Journalists clearly obtained and noted official 
 U.S. statements, but lent them little weight as the real 
 rationale for the decision.
