SUBJECT:  TERRORIST LISTS - TURKEY 
 
REF: STATE 193615 
 
¶1. (SBU) Turkey does not maintain a national list of banned 
terrorist entities: there is no national designations system.  The 
Turkish authorities circulate all 1267-designated and 
U.S.-designated names to government agencies, financial institutions 
and to other legal entities with reporting requirements under 
Turkey's anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism statutes. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The list is not made public, however, nor does the 
inclusion on the list necessarily mean the listed name is subject to 
freezing or other sanctions.  If assets are found in Turkey, and the 
listed name is on the 1267 list, the assets can be frozen by a 
Council of Ministers decree, although the authority of the Council 
of Ministers to freeze is currently undergoing a legal challenge.
