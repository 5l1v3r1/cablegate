¶1. (SBU) Czech MFA officials in the Department of the 
Americas and the Department of Human Rights and Transition 
Policy, confirmed and thanked Embassy officials for our 
points on the current situation in Cuba.  On February 19, the 
Czech MFA released a statement (similar to Secretary Rice's 
subsequent statement of February 24), expressing the hope 
that Cuba will now begin to implement necessary reforms, 
while also urging Cuba to release all political prisoners, 
open dialogue with the opposition and hold a free election. 
The Czech MFA has no plans at this point to release another 
statement.  The full statement dated February 19 is listed 
below in paragraph 2. 
 
¶2. (U) Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Czech Republic on the resignation of Fidel Castro from the 
highest state positions 
The Cuban media announced today that Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro has resigned the position of the Chairman of the 
National Council and the Supreme Commander of the Cuban Armed 
Forces.  Since July 2006, these positions had been 
temporarily held by his brother Raul Castro due to Fidel 
Castro's deteriorated health condition.  According to 
accessible information, Raul Castro will lead the country 
even after Fidel Castro's resignation.  This development has 
been expected because Fidel Castro has indicated his plan 
before. 
 
Although it is just a formal confirmation of the status quo, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic 
expresses the hope that Cuba will thus set on a path of 
necessary reforms of the political and economic system that 
would lead this beautiful country out of the stagnation of 
the past long years.  The future development should be aimed 
at releasing all political prisoners, opening a dialogue with 
the political opposition, and holding a free election.
