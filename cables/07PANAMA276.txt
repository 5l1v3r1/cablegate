(SBU) POLCHIEF delivered reftel demarche to Panamanian MFA 
Senior Advisor Nils Castro informing the GOP of U.S. views 
regarding the IAEA's report on Iranian compliance with UNSCR 
1737 and next steps. Castro, who heads Panama's UNSC team, 
noted that the situation in Iran would be discussed on 
February 26 among UNSC members and said that Panama would 
note carefully the views of other Council members and consult 
with its hemispheric neighbors, but had not yet developed its 
own position.  Favoring an incremental and gradual approach, 
Embassy believes Panama wait until China's and Russia's 
positions become clearer before staking out its own position.
