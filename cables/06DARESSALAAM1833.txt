On November 17, Mawazo Kaducha, Head of UN Systems in the 
Multilateral Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
agreed with the USG position that the Emergency Special 
Session draft resolution regarding Israeli was skewed.  While 
Kaducha did not reveal whether Tanzania would vote "No" or 
abstain, Kaducha emphasized that the Ministry understood U.S. 
concerns and would forward the USG position to the Permanent 
Representative in New York immediately.
