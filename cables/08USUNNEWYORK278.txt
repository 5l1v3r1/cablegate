SUBJECT: LEBANON TRIBUNAL: UAE CONTRIBUTION RECEIVED 
 
 
(SBU) The UN Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) has advised USUN 
that the UN received a contribution of USD 4,999,975 to the 
General UN Trust Fund on March 17 from the Abu Dhabi Finance 
Department.  After trying unsuccessfully for the past week to 
contact the UAE Mission to confirm that the deposit was 
intended for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, OLA told USUN 
on March 27 that UNSCR 1559 envoy Terje Roed-Larsen was able 
to contact the UAE Foreign Minister directly to confirm that 
fact.  The UAE Foreign Minister also reportedly told Larsen 
that the UAE wants the contribution to remain anonymous or 
characterized as a contribution from a state "in the region" 
for at least the time being.
