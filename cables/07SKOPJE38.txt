(SBU) Drawing on reftel points, P/E Chief briefed MFA State 
Secretary Igor Ilievski on January 12 on the President's new 
 
SIPDIS 
Iraq strategy.  Ilievski welcomed the update and said 
Macedonia remained committed to its troop contributions to 
coalition operations in Iraq.  He said the GOM also was still 
considering opening a diplomatic mission in Baghdad, but that 
high security costs prevented them from doing so at present. 
He added that the government would be able to make a stronger 
case to the public for a diplomatic presence in Iraq if 
Macedonian construction firms, which had operated in Iraq 
before 1991, were able to participate in reconstruction 
projects there.
