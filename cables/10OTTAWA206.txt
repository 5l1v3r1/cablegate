SUBJECT: Canada To Vote No On UNGA Goldstone Resolution 
 
REF: STATE 15722 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  Canada will vote against the Palestinian-drafted 
resolution in the UN General Assembly on the Goldstone Report, 
according to the Human Rights Policy Division of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  Canada voted against the 
draft resolution tabled in the UNGA in November 2009.  Canada 
opposes "counter-productive resolutions" on this issue and believes 
that the UN Human Rights Council is the proper venue for further 
discussion.
