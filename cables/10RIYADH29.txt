¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph five. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador met Assistant Minister for Petroleum 
Affairs Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman January 4 at the Prince's 
request.  Prince Abdulaziz gave Ambassador a copy of the 
report of the International Energy Forum (IEF) Expert Group 
(ref A), the work of which was noted in the Leaders Statement 
of the G-20 Pittsburgh summit.  The Prince said he was 
focused on the upcoming January 10 IEF High Level Steering 
Group (HLSG) meeting in Paris that we understand USG reps 
also plan to attend.  Prince Abdulaziz said he hoped for a 
successful meeting there, and he requested Embassy assistance 
to work with EEB and DOE to ensure he would not be 
"blindsided" by U.S. or other views put forward at the HLSG 
meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Additionally, Prince Abdulaziz requested U.S. 
support for IEF reform which in his view boils down to 
regularizing funding mechanisms and establishing clearer 
membership guidelines.  The Prince said he concurs with the 
Expert Group recommendation to establish a new minimum legal 
framework for the IEF, but he signaled repeatedly to the 
Ambassador that he looks forward to working with the USG to 
find a solution acceptable to the United States and Saudi 
Arabia to preserve the informal nature of IEF deliberations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  As of DOE DepSec Poneman's December 6-8 
visit to Saudi Arabia, and from what we have heard of 
subsequent discussions in Washington on this issue, we 
understand the USG position remains not to support the Expert 
Group recommendation to establish a minimum legal framework 
for the IEF but that we could accept reforms that result in 
regularizing funding streams and establishing clearer 
membership guidelines for the IEF.  Both of these steps would 
increase the organization's effectiveness.  We have heard 
Washington officials say they also conceivably could support 
the U.S. taking a more active role in the IEF, perhaps 
joining the organization's executive board.  As we have 
reported previously, with the IEF secretariat headquarters 
located in Riyadh, U.S. Mission Saudi Arabia is aware of some 
of the organization's historical weaknesses, but we also see 
opportunities to help reshape the IEF into an organization 
that much more strongly supports U.S. energy policy goals and 
promotes President Obama's outreach efforts to the Muslim 
World.  The result would be an organization that is much more 
valuable to the United States than it has been in previous 
years. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action request:  Embassy requests Department 
guidance as soon as possible about the U.S. position on the 
expert group report and that we can share with Prince 
Abdulaziz and ideally the IEF Secretary General prior to the 
January 10 HLSG meeting.
