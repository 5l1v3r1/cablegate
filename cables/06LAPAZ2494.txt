(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to First Secretary 
Eduardo Gallardo of the Office of Multilateral Relations in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs September 20.  Gallardo noted 
our concerns, especially regarding our desire for the GOB to 
speak with the Guatemalan delegation about its UN Security 
Council candidacy.  Gallardo expressed GOB solidarity with 
the U.S. position that lethal attacks which target civilians 
to intimidate a population or compel government action cannot 
be excused or justified, but said the GOB would have a 
difficult time at the NAM building consensus on that issue. 
Gallardo said the GOB would consider our request for more 
balanced language on Israel, but again noted that consensus 
would be difficult on such a "complex" topic.
