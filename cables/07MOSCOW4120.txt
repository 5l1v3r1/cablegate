SUBJECT: RUSSIA NONCOMMITTAL ON UNSCR 1540 SOUTH 
AFRICA-INDONESIA DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 116085 
 
(U) We delivered reftel demarche August 22 to Alexander 
Deyneko, Senior Counsellor in the MFA Department of 
Disarmament and Security Issues.  We stressed that efforts to 
delete the language permitting the UNSCR 1540 Committee to 
post the matrices on its website would undermine the 
transparency of the Committee and its efforts to help states 
build their capacity to implement the obligations in UNSCR 
Â¶1540.  Deyneko said he was not aware of the proposal to 
delete the language but would convey our concerns to his 
superiors.
