¶1.  Summary: On February 18-19 Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chair of the 
Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, led a 
congressional delegation to Rio de Janeiro to learn more about the 
market aspects of Brazil's sugarcane ethanol industry, renewable 
energy policy, flexfuel automobile technology, and next steps in 
biofuel research.  Other members of the delegation were: Rep. Thomas 
Davis (R-VA), Rep. Lois Capps (D-CA), Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-WY), 
Rep. Michael Ferguson (R-NJ), and Ref. Jeff Flake (R-AZ).  The 
delegation met with representatives of the Sao Paulo Sugarcane 
Agroindustry Union (UNICA), Brazil's Energy Planning Office (EPE), 
the Brazilian National Association of Automakers (ANFAVEA), and 
Petrobras' Research and Development Center (CENPES).  End Summary. 
 
THE ARGUMENT FOR SUGARCANE ETHANOL 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Sugarcane production does not pose an environmental or 
deforestation threat in Brazil, said Dr. Mauricio Tolmasquim, 
Director of Brazil's Energy Planning Office (under the Ministry of 
Mines and Energy).  Current sugarcane and ethanol production is 
predominantly concentrated in the center-south region around the 
state of Sao Paulo.  To meet increased demand for ethanol, Brazil 
plans to use degraded pasturelands for sugarcane production. 
According to industry analysts, an additional 200 million acres of 
pastureland could be shifted relatively quickly for sugarcane 
production.  This estimated area lies outside of the Amazon Biome 
Region. 
 
¶3.  In addition to being a renewable source of energy, ethanol is a 
low-pollutant fuel and actually reduces overall greenhouse gas 
emissions.  According to Marcos Jank, CEO of the Sao Paulo Sugarcane 
Agroindustry Union (UNICA), sugarcane is the most competitive 
feedstock to produce ethanol because of its higher yield and low 
cost (competitive at US$ 40 the barrel of crude).  It also has very 
positive energy and environmental balances. UNICA represents 108 
members, which are responsible for 50% of the Brazilian alcohol 
production and 60% of the Brazilian sugarcane and sugar production. 
UNICA urged CODEL Markey to consider commoditization of ethanol 
markets, increased technical and scientific cooperation, and common 
standards.  Although the U.S. and EU have set up new governmental 
incentive programs on biofuels, UNICA argued that the global ethanol 
market continues to be small and very volatile in the short term due 
to high tariff and non-tariff barriers. 
 
¶4. Rep. Capps was particularly interested in the idea that biofuels 
represent an opportunity for developing countries.  By growing 
sugarcane, nearly 100 countries could potentially become biofuel 
suppliers as opposed to the current 20 oil producers who provide 
fossil fuels to the rest of the world.  Brazil is already reaching 
out to Angola and Mozambique because these countries have excellent 
conditions for sugarcane production, according to UNICA. 
 
BRAZILIAN CONSUMERS CHOOSE FLEXFUEL CARS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  CODEL Markey was interested in learning more about the 
popularity of flexfuel cars in Brazil and what, if any, specific 
government policy decisions were made to provide an incentive for 
the Brazilian public to purchase flexfuel cars.  Flexfuel cars were 
first introduced in Brazil in 2003 (by an American automaker).  Now, 
there are 10 brands and 63 models on the Brazilian market.  Eduardo 
Feijo of the Brazilian National Association of Automakers (ANFAVEA) 
explained that these vehicles run on gasoline, ethanol (E100), or 
any blend of gasoline and ethanol (from E22 to E100).  Through 
special electronic sensors, the on-board computer recognizes the 
fuel and properly adjusts the engine combustion parameters without 
any action required from the driver. 
 
¶6.  Dr. Tolmasquim, who was Deputy Minister of Energy from 2003-05 
(when flexfuel cars were introduced in Brazil), recalled that no 
specific government action was taken to support flexfuel cars. 
Rather, the push came from the automakers themselves.  Feijo added 
that the popularity of the flexfuel car in Brazil is a phenomenon 
that is entirely attributed to consumer choice.  The delegation was 
able to see several models of flexfuel vehicles at the Petrobras 
Research and Development Center (CENPES), where cars were being 
tested for biofuel efficiency.

BIOFUELS RESEARCH 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  In addition to visiting a flexfuel automobile testing lab, CODEL 
Markey visited an ethanol from sugarcane bagasse pilot plant at 
CENPES.  Bagasse, the leftover sugarcane biomass after juice is 
extracted, is currently burned to produce heat energy to power sugar 
mills.  Petrobras hopes to develop commercially a viable method to 
process excess bagasse into ethanol.  According to Carlos Thadeu 
Fraga, CENPES Director, Petrobras estimates that bagasse can yield 
an additional 40 percent more ethanol per unit of sugarcane than 
current methods.  Other biofuel-related R&D projects at CENPES 
include biodiesel, HBIO (vegetable/animal oil hydrogenation, and 
non-conventional bioethanol (lignocellulosic bioethanol, castor seed 
cake bioethanol and synthetic biofuel).
