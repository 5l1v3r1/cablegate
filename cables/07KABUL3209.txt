REF: STATE 130775 
 
¶1. (1. (U) Per Reftel, on September 20, Post delivered the 
U.S. priorities for the 62nd UN General Assembly debate to 
the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶2.  (U) Deputy Director of the UN and International 
Conferences department G. Seddiq Rasuli told Poloff 
that he understood how important the U.S. priorities were in 
UNGA and that we could assume that Afghanistan would 
"generally" support U.S. goals at UNGA and in the UN 
committees.  Rasuli said he would forward the non-paper 
containing the U.S. priorities to the Director of United 
Nations Affairs, Ayoub Erfani, who was in New York 
accompanying the delegation from Afghanistan to UNGA.  We 
will follow up with the MFA and forward responses we receive 
to the specific items.
