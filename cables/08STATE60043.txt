Acting Under Secretary of State John C. Rood and Deputy 
Foreign Minister Sergey Kislyak have discussed the future of 
the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC). 
Deputy Foreign Minister Kislyak has said that Russia believes 
the ISTC is useful as a means for scientific exchange and 
collaboration and agrees with the U.S. that the mission of 
the ISTC needs to evolve.  Deputy Foreign Minister Kislyak 
agreed that there could be bilateral discussions in the 
future. 
 
U.S. Department of State representatives met with officials 
of the Russian Embassy in Washington informally to discuss 
the U.S. interest in conducting bilateral meetings at the 
expert-level to follow-up on the Kislyak and Rood 
discussions.  An informal consensus was reached that the U.S. 
would develop this non-paper to begin the bilateral 
discussion and that multilateral meetings would follow with 
all the ISTC stakeholders. 
 
In 2006, ISTC Governing Board members revisited the question 
of how to transform the original ISTC mission of redirecting 
former weapons scientists to one that furthers members, 
joint WMD nonproliferation efforts; the Board discussed a 
future ISTC that effectively tailors project and programmatic 
activities towards nonproliferation, and also seeks to 
advance partnerships on key scientific challenges of 
interest.  The Secretariat developed a paper that was 
discussed at many ISTC meetings, including at a working group 
dedicated to the issue. 
 
The U.S. sees great value in holding bilateral discussions on 
ways to transform the ISTC that would strengthen important 
U.S.-Russian nonproliferation collaborative efforts. 
Russia,s ideas and proposals on transformation are critical 
for the ISTC to remain a successful tool for nonproliferation 
and scientific exchange.  The U.S. proposes that a bilateral 
discussion on the ISTC's future include: 
 
--    Transforming the ISTC to be a focal point for 
international cooperation on WMD nonproliferation, and 
counterterrorism by: 
 
-- expanding ISTC participation beyond the states that 
formerly comprised the Soviet Union 
 
-- broadening the strategic priorities to foster both 
international and regional partnerships and addressing both 
global proliferation and terrorism challenges 
 
-- Exploring multiple funding mechanisms to advance strategic 
nonproliferation goals 
 
-- Assessing the current and future economic circumstances of 
scientists, technicians, and engineers with WMD and missile 
expertise in Russia and the the states that formerly 
comprised the Soviet Union 
 
-- Assessing the evolving economic circumstances of ISTC 
funding parties and discuss the prospects of increased joint 
funding 
 
-- Coordinating ISTC efforts with other ongoing scientific 
and technical cooperation between the U.S. and Russia 
 
The U.S. proposes to hold bilateral, expert-level meetings in 
Washington or Moscow to include multiple Russian agencies, 
including the Ministry of Education and Science, the Russian 
Academy of Science, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and 
ROSATOM, and their American counterparts such as the 
Department of State, the Department of Energy, the U.S. 
National Academy of Sciences, and other USG ISTC partners.
