     Â¶B. (B) STOCKHOLM 1745 
 
(SBU) Answers to questions in paragraph 7 of Ref A are as 
follows: 
 
(a) Embassy Ankara TFCO: 
Name:  Thomas Goldberger 
Title: Economic Counselor 
Phone: 90-312-455-5555 ext. 2541 
Email: GolbergerTH@state.gov 
 
(b) Embassy Ankara Deputy TFCO: 
Name:   Katie Stana 
Title: Economic Officer 
Phone: 90-312-455-5555 ext. 2253 
Email: StanaMK@state.gov 
 
(c) We would welcome greater communication and coordination 
between TFCOs in EU member states and accession countries, 
particularly when many countries are grappling with the same 
issues.  An annual meeting of Deputy TFCOs from the region 
with representatives from State/EB and Treasury would assist 
in this endeavor. 
 
(d) Post understands that compliance with FATF Special 
Recommendation III.2 is a generalized problem.  Building on 
Ref B, Post recommends that Washington consider a group 
International Visitor program for EU member states and 
accession countries to learn how the US designation process 
works.  Creating a group IV program would provide an added 
benefit, as it would foster information sharing and support 
networks between countries as they work to implement the FATF 
recommendations. 
 
(e) Post appreciates the support it receives from Washington 
and would welcome the visit of a CTF officer from either EB 
or Treasury.  Deputy TFCO found the three-day FSI course very 
useful and would encourage a similar course for FSNs working 
this issue.
