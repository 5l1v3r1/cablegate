Â¶1.  (U) On November 3, Poloff presented reftel demarche 
concerning Morocco's support for the U.S. request and draft 
decision document to extend the 100 percent destruction 
deadline to MFA Chief of the United Nations Division Azzedine 
Farhane.  In response, Farhane said he did not envision any 
problems with Morocco supporting the U.S. request, but noted 
that Morocco must examine our request in more detail before 
he could provide a definitive response.  Farhane added that 
Morocco believes it is important to coordinate its position 
on this issue with other Executive Council members.  He 
pledged to keep the Embassy informed of Morocco's views on 
this issue.  Per reftel, Poloff gave Farhane the talking 
points as a non-paper and a copy of the U.S. draft decision.
