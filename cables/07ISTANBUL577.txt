SUBJECT: OPENING SESSION OF DINK MURDER TRIAL

¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The much anticipated trial of 18 suspects 
in the January 19 murder of Turkish Armenian human rights 
activist Hrant Dink (ref A) began on July 2 in a closed-court 
session because the murder suspect is a minor.  Following 
accusations of police complicity in the murder and questions 
about the conduct of the subsequent investigation, the case 
is viewed by many observers as a litmus test for the 
judiciary and Turkey's commitment to the rule of law, while 
bringing international attention to the concept of a Turkish 
"deep state."  The trial continues October 1.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Hrant Dink murder trial began on July 2 at the 
Istanbul 14th Penal Court in Besiktas.  Amidst heavy security 
(press reported more than 500 policemen), over 1,000 
protesters gathered outside the courtroom, which was closed 
to observers because one of the defendants -- suspected 
gunman Ogun Samast -- is a minor (ref B).  According to the 
Dink family lawyer, the 12-hour hearing featured the 
identification of plaintiffs and defendants along with their 
opening statements.  The court released four defendants and 
gave procedural orders including demands for the presentation 
of key evidence.  The trial is set to convene again on 
October 1. 
 
¶3.  (U) The case has drawn widespread attention, not only 
because of Hrant Dink's high profile as a human rights 
activist but also because of the intrigue and controversy 
associated with the subsequent investigation which brought to 
question government complicity in the failure to protect 
Hrant Dink despite awareness of the threats against him.  The 
investigation also implicated a retired general and the 
Trabzon leadership of the extreme nationalist Great Union 
Party (BBP), and cost the jobs of Trabzon's governor and 
chief of police who were removed from office on claims of 
negligence and failure to perform their duties. 
 
¶4.  (U) Many observers view this trial as a test for the 
judiciary.  All sides claim undue influence on the 
proceedings.  Lawyers for the defense complained the 
prosecutor was pressured into charging the defendants with 
"gang membership" while attorneys for the Dink family have 
appealed a government decision not to pursue a criminal 
investigation into Istanbul Chief of Police Celalettin 
Cerrah's statements immediately following the murder, 
suggesting Samast acted alone. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment: The Hrant Dink murder case joins the ranks 
of the 2005 Semdinli bombing and the 1996 Susurluk incident 
in putting the theory of a Turkish "deep state" on trial. 
While the latter two cases played out largely before a 
domestic audience, the Hrant Dink trial brings international 
attention to the concept.  We will continue to monitor this 
case closely.  End comment.
