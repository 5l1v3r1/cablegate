¶1. Poloff raised ref A points regarding resolutions on Israel 
debated in the UN General Assembly (UNGA) each fall with 
Jacques Renand Cherduville, Political Director of the Haitian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on November 21.  (Note: Haiti 
voted for the three U.S.-opposed resolutions referenced in 
the demarche last year.  End note.)  Cherduville said he 
could not guarantee the Haitian delegation would vote against 
the three resolutions concerning anti-Israel UN bodies, and 
added that Haiti's votes on the resolutions would be 
determined by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in consultation 
with the President and Prime Minister.  He promised to relay 
USG concerns regarding the resolutions to the Minister and to 
the Haitian delegation in New York. 
 
¶2. Poloff also thanked Cherduville for Haiti's co-sponsorship 
of the resolution on compliance (ref B) in UNGA's First 
Committee this year.
