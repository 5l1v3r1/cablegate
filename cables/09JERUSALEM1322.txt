 ¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  The PA reaffirmed its commitment to the 
Red Sea - Dead Sea project (RDS), expressed hesitation about 
taking a position on the Jordanian Red Sea Development 
Project (JRSP) until technical studies were completed, and 
requested a meeting with USG officials at the upcoming World 
Water Week in Stockholm.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Fuad Bateh, Advisor to the Head of the Palestinian 
Water Authority, reaffirmed the PA's commitment to the RDS 
project (reftel). He noted that PM Fayyad's comments in the 
press were mischaracterized and possibly misquoted; Fayyad 
had expressed reservations about expropriation of Palestinian 
land, not the RDS.  Bateh said that Dr. Shaddad al Attili, 
Head of the PWA, had publicly expressed PA support for the 
RDS after the inaccurate press reports. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  On the JRSP, Bateh said that the Jordanian project 
might present technical problems for the RDS.  He stressed 
that the feasibility studies could not be looked at in 
isolation, particularly as they related to the water intake 
at Aqaba, the impact on marine life, and seismic activity. 
Bateh added that the JRSP would possibly impact the Jordan 
Valley, and thus needed the consensus of the other riparians 
before moving forward.  If the GOJ did not seek consensus, 
then the project could violate international law, he said. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Bateh will be in Stockholm in mid August for World 
Water Week and offered to meet with USG officials for 
bilateral discussions on the RDS and JRSP.
