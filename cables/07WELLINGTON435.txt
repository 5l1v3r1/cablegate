¶1. (C) ADCM and A/P-E Counselor delivered demarche points in 
Ref A and B on June 13 to Darryl Dunn, Director of Middle 
East and African Division at New Zealand's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT). Mr. Dunn expressed 
appreciation for the background and indicated he understood 
the importance of this issue to the United States and would 
disseminate our concerns among MFAT officials and their 
Mission in Tehran. Mr. Dunn further informed us that Iran's 
Deputy Foreign Minister Safari will be in Wellington on June 
26 -27 for meetings with GNZ officials. As part of the 
scheduled topics for discussion, New Zealand will continue 
their ongoing Human Rights dialogue with Iranian officials 
and will raise the issues the Embassy has brought to his 
attention. Embassy will follow-up with MFAT to learn of any 
response from their Iranian interlocutors, and seek 
opportunities to discuss this issue further with appropriate 
GNZ officials. 
 
¶2.  (C) Dunn also said that he had recently visited Tehran, 
mostly to check on the well-being of the two NZ diplomats 
stationed there.  While there, Deputy General Ezadi, who 
works under Dep FM Safari told him that Iran believes New 
Zealand has hardened its position on Iran's nuclear policies. 
 Dunn countered that there has been no change: while New 
Zealand respects Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy the 
GNZ and the rest of the international community  remains 
concerned about Iran's nuclear research.  Dunn stressed the 
need for Iran to comply with the UNSC and IAEA. 
 
¶3.  (C) Dunn told us that he also had lunch in Tehran with 
the former Iranian Ambassador to Wellington, Kambiz 
Sheikh-Hassani.  The Ambassador seemed subdued, which Dunn 
took as a sign that the relatively liberal Foreign Ministry 
is feeling pressure from the GOI.  Dunn also said that the 
Ambassador seems to have told his superiors that Dunn was an 
old friend from Wellington in order to be able to have lunch 
with him.  The Ambassador does not normally attend NZ 
diplomatic events in Tehran.
