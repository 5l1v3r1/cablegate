ZEALAND'S RESPONSE

     ¶B. STATE 50398 
     ¶C. STATE 41362 
     ¶D. STATE 40404

(U) Classified by Acting DCM Katherine B. Hadda.  Reasons: 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (S) The New Zealand government has decided to co-sponsor a 
request to the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee to list four 
Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leaders: Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, Gun Gun 
Rusman Gunawan, Taufik Rifki and Abdullah Anshori (ref C and 
F). 
 
¶2. (C) Taha McPherson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade's Security Policy Division informed post April 13 of 
the decision made by the government's ministers.  McPherson 
said the decision also would be conveyed to New Zealand's UN 
mission and to the Australian government.  Australia's High 
Commissioner in New Zealand, John Dauth, on April 11 met with 
Ministry officials and urged them to co-sponsor the 
submission to the UN committee. 
 
¶3. (C) McPherson noted that the delay in the request to the 
UN committee (ref B) gave New Zealand officials the time they 
needed to run the issue through their interagency process. 
Particularly since New Zealand co-sponsored the UN request to 
designate JI itself, the officials considered from the 
beginning the co-sponsorship of the JI leaders' listing to 
have merit, McPherson said.  He added that the month taken to 
respond to our request for co-sponsorship (ref F) reflects 
New Zealand's cumbersome interagency process. 
 
¶4. (C) Post is especially grateful to Treasury for providing 
additional information that helped the New Zealand government 
officials reach their decision.
