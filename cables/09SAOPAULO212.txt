Title- Attention on China 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-6) states: "....On Friday 
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took a dangerous step.  He 
proposed to his Chinese colleague, Hu Jintao, the utilization of 
their currencies - Real and Yuan - for bilateral trade, replacing 
the [US] dollar....Brazil, to the contrary of what President Lula 
proposes, should lead the resistance to the excessive penetration - 
and many times based on unfair trade practices - of Chinese 
interests in South America." 
 
Title- The Death of the Consensus 
 
Op-ed in liberal business oriented Valor Econtmico (4-6) by Sergio 
Leo states: "...The death declared by British Prime Minister Gordon 
Brown was not of the Washington Consensus, but rather the 
fundamentalist belief in just one of its 10 items: deregulation as 
the best tool for promoting the allocation of resources and 
development.  The new global consensus establishes that the 
post-crisis world will have stronger and more active institutions to 
control market agents.  As with every international economic 
consensus, the new consensus is not entirely followed by the most 
powerful countries when they make their policies....A good part of 
President Lula's success at the G-20 comes from the Brazilian 
government's respect for the principles enshrined in the Washington 
Consensus....He knows that his credibility would be dead if he 
believed that the era of fiscal discipline for the dark skinned 
countries is over [in a allusion to the contrary of blue-eyed 
people, which Lula said were to blame for the crisis] ."
