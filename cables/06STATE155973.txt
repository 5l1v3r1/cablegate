SUBJECT: CIVILIAN INVITATION TO CENTCOM CONFERENCE ON IRAQ 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  See para. 7. 
 
¶2. SUMMARY.  An Iraq Coalition Conference will be held in 
Warsaw, Poland 3-5 October, 2006, sponsored by CDRUSCENTCOM. 
Invitees include military representatives (all addressee 
posts already invited by CENTCOM) and civilian political 
representatives from Coalition partners and prospective 
partners.  This cable solicits civilian political 
participation as symbolic of a transition for Coalition 
forces from boots on the ground to a supporting role for the 
Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), with an increasing emphasis on 
political and economic development.  This conference 
provides an opportunity for countries to engage with each 
other on the nature and vision of the international 
community's assistance to Iraq.  Key conference speakers 
will include Iraqi National Security Advisor Muwaffaq al- 
Rubaie, GEN John Abizaid, CDRUSCENTCOM, GEN George Casey, 
COMMNFI, State Department Senior Coordinator for Iraq 
Ambassador David Satterfield, and the Secretary of Defense's 
Special Counselor for Coalition Affairs, Ms. Debra Cagan. 
Embassies are requested to extend invitations to appropriate 
civilian representatives, noting when appropriate Amb. 
Satterfield's desire for bilateral and trilateral 
(w/Government of Iraq) consultations with specific key 
countries: El Salvador, Mongolia, Poland, Slovakia, South 
Korea, Turkey, and the UK.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶3. The United States Central Command has announced it will 
host a Coalition Conference in support of the Multi-National 
Forces-Iraq (MNF-I) in Warsaw, Poland on 3-5 October, 2006. 
The conference theme is Ma'an ila Al-Aman (Together 
Forward).  The conference purpose is to inform Coalition 
partners on the progress being made by the Iraqi Government 
and Security Forces, to review the updated Campaign Plan, 
requiring change in the nature of coalition partner 
missions, and to ensure that coalition partners understand 
the overall plan for the next 12 to 18 months. 
 
¶4. While the focus of the conference will be Coalition 
contributions to Iraq's security and stability, the close 
relationship between the security environment and Iraq's 
political and economic development suggest coordination at 
the both the Mil-Mil and Pol-Mil levels will provide the 
best opportunity for Coalition success.  Key conference 
speakers will include Government of Iraq National Security 
Advisor Muwaffaq al-Rubaie, General John Abizaid, Commander 
USCENTCOM, General George Casey, Commmander, MNF-I, State 
Department Senior Coordinator for Iraq Ambassador David 
Satterfield, and the Secretary of Defense's Special 
Counselor for Coalition Affairs.  This invitation seeks a 
single civilian participant, well versed on Iraq issues and 
of commensurate stature with the nation's military attendee. 
Simultaneous conference invitations have been extended to 
Coalition Flag/general officers at the two and three star 
level through military channels.  While many addressee 
countries have no current involvement in Iraq, CENTCOM wants 
to make the conference as inclusive as possible and approach 
potential capability contributors. 
 
¶5. RSVPs and registration information should be submitted 
via nation's military Senior National Representative (SNR) 
at CENTCOM's Coalition Village in Tampa, FL. In the case of 
no CENTCOM SNR, Embassy staff can contact the CENTCOM POC 
(para. 8) or directly register participants by accessings 
CENTCOM's SIPRNet website: 
http://hqsweb03.centcom.smil.mil/CCJ5/J5CCC/M NFI Conference/ 
index.asp.  Required registration information includes name, 
title, contact information, security clearance data and 
travel details.  Conference details, including a tentative 
conference agenda and hotel information can also be found at 
the website. 
 
¶6. For reference, the following is the text of the 
invitation already sent to military representatives: 
 
Dear General X, 
 
United States Central Command is pleased to announce it will 
host a Coalition Conference in support of Muli-National 
Forces-Iraq in Warsaw, Poland on 3-5 October, 2006.  We 
request that a military representative from Poland at the 
general officer level attend this important and historic 
conference.  Separately, the United States State Department 
will be contacting your government to ask a civilian 
political representative also be named. 
 
      We hope both a military and civilian political 
representative from your country will be able to join us for 
this vital gathering.  I believe you will find the time with 
the United States Central Command and Multi-National Forces- 
Iraq Coalition team well spent. 
 
      The two-day conference will be held in Warsaw, Poland, 
with approximately 150 attendees.  Participants will include 
Two and Three Star Flag/General Officers and equivalent 
civilian-level political representatives of current and 
prospective Iraq coalition members, as well as, 
distinguished US and Iraq Government officials.  The 
conference's purpose is to inform coalition partners on the 
progress being made by the Iraqi Government and Security 
Forces, to review the updated Campaign Plan requiring change 
in the nature of coalition partner missions, and to ensure 
that coalition partners understand the plan for the next 12 
to 18 months. 
 
      Enclosed you will find some important conference 
details.  The United States Central Command staff and I look 
forward to seeing and spending time with your 
representative.  My staff is prepared to assist you in any 
way possible to make this a memorable and successful event. 
 
                                       Sincerely, 
 
 
 
 
Encl                                   JOHN P. ABIZAID 
as                                     General, USA 
 
¶7. Action: request post deliver the following civilian 
conference invitation to the appropriate host government 
representative: 
 
      United States Central Command will host a Coalition 
Conference in support of Muli-National Forces-Iraq in 
Warsaw, Poland on 3-5 October, 2006.  Indicative of the 
wider international engagement beyond security and stability 
necessary to assist Iraq in its political, economic and 
security development, the Department of State would like to 
invite one civilian representative as well from your 
country.  We request that a representative of senior rank 
(Ambassadorial or Political Director or other commensurate 
representative) well versed in Iraq issues attend. 
 
      The purpose of this two-day conference is to inform 
international partners of the progress being made by the 
Iraqi Government and its Security Forces; I intend to join 
my military colleagues in sharing with you a vision for Iraq 
over the next 12 to 18 months in its political, economic, 
and security development. 
 
      I encourage a representative to attend what I believe 
will be an important and unifying event.  Over 150 
participants are expected to attend, including Iraqis, as 
well as participants of countries which are not yet involved 
in the international effort to rebuild Iraq. 
 
(LONDON, SEOUL, WARSAW --please insert the following 
additional paragraph: The leadership of a Multi-National 
Division is a vital function for MNF-I.  In particular I 
would like to have a separate meeting with your 
representative to discuss how we can together take advantage 
of your leadership to most effectively help Iraq transition 
to security self-reliance.) 
 
(BRATISLAVA, SAN SALVADOR, ULAANBAATAR-please insert the 
following additional paragraph: In particular I would like 
to have a separate meeting with your representative to 
discuss how we can together take advantage of your unique 
contribution to most effectively help Iraq transition to 
security self-reliance.)

particular I would like to have a separate bilateral meeting 
with your representative to discuss several regional 
issues.) 
 
Please coordinate with your military representative to 
submit your registration information (personal contact and 
travel details).  Of course you may consult our Embassy 
staff on any problems you encounter.  I look forward to 
seeing you and working with your country to help build Iraq 
a better future. 
 
                                 Sincerely, 
 
 
 
 
                                 David M. Satterfield
