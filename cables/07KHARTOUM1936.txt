SUBJECT: SWEDISH SPECIAL ENVOY FOR SUDAN ON SUPPORTING CPA 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Michael Fruhling, Swedish Ambassador and Special 
Envoy for Sudan, called on CDA Fernandez December 6 to discuss 
issues relating to Southern Sudan.  He said his Government is 
looking for ways to be more active, "as a smaller country," on 
helping to advance the CPA process.  He proposed enhanced 
collaboration with the EU, UNMIS, the UNSC, and the Sudan 
Consortium.  The Swedes are also proposing to have international 
election observers on the ground one year before 2009 elections (by 
summer 2008) to monitor the entire election cycle.  Stockholm is 
also willing to provide personnel to the AEC secretariat.  Fruhling 
was gratified to learn that the USG would continue its financial 
support to the AEC.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Ambassador Fruhling (previously Swedish Ambassador to Cuba) 
said he has been Sweden's special envoy to Sudan, with a focus on 
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), since April.  His 
government has believed for some time that the North/South situation 
in Sudan was being neglected by the international community with its 
focus on Darfur.  CDA suggested to Fruhling that Sweden consider 
additional development assistance, particularly to the Three Areas, 
which would serve as a bridge between North and South Sudan. 
 
AEC Strategy consonant with Coordinators 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On the subject of the AEC Chairman, CDA told Fruhling that 
the AEC Coordinators had informally agreed first to nominate a 
Chairman, and then to press the new Chairman to be as activist and 
independent as possible under the current AEC rules of procedure. 
Fruhling said this matches the Swedish Government's analysis as to 
how best to proceed.  CDA stressed that an attempt to revise the 
rules of procedure could "open a Pandora's box," as Khartoum would 
push for concessions in other areas that would leave the 
Chairmanship as weak as it is now. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Fruhling said the GOSS/SPLM should be encouraged to send 
its best people to AEC meetings, as this lack of commitment has been 
a major factor in hampering the AEC.  CDA agreed, but noted that 
"the number of really good people in the SPLM is very small and they 
are stretched thin."  The SPLM delegates to the AEC chronically lack 
staff support, and often show up at meetings unprepared for dealing 
with the much better staffed NCP. The international community needs 
to help train new SPLM cadres to strengthen their performance. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The European Union (EU) and the UN are currently 
"non-players" in the CPA process, and both need to be more active, 
Fruhling said.  Brussels is slowly waking up to the realization that 
the North/South peace process should not be neglected in favor of 
Darfur. 
 
Energizing UNMIS, especially on Elections 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Fruhling turned the conversation to UNMIS, saying his 
Government believed that UNMIS and the AEC should have a more 
fruitful working relationship.  CDA replied that the USG was in 
broad agreement, and that he had recently spoken to SRSG Ashraf Qazi 
on this.  Fruhling said his Government believes the 2009 elections 
are one of the most important issues in the North/South peace 
process.  Time is short, and the UNMIS could step up its involvement 
in preparations.  CDA replied that UNMIS is beginning to get more 
involved.  He said too many people are focused on the difficulties 
in preparations for the census, and not enough on the fact that 
credible elections can be held on fairly short notice. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Fruhling said UNMIS should be more active helping draft 
the country's election law, especially to ensure that foreign 
observers are permitted during elections, as mentioned in the CPA. 
Further, he suggested, election observers should be on the ground to 
observe the entire election process one year before the elections. 
CDA responded that this was an excellent idea, and encouraged the 
Swedes to pursue it. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) When UNMIS's mandate comes up for renewal before the UN 
Security Council, Fruhling said, the Swedes propose requiring a 
report on UNMIS and CPA implementation monthly, instead of every 
three months as is required now.  This would help to keep 
international attention focused on the CPA during the important 
pre-election period. The monthly report would not have to be long 
but it could serve as a useful monitoring tool. 
 
Sudan Consortium:  Tell us what needs doing 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Amb. Fruhling said the Sudan Consortium should also be 
enlisted in the service of CPA implementation.  The second half of 
March 2008 is the best target date for a donor's conference, to 
focus on assisting the CPA process.  The World Bank and the UN 
should be involved.  Specifically, Fruhling said, the World Bank 
would need time to prepare a non-paper listing for prospective 
donors "the work that needs to be done" in the South and to advance

the CPA. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The discussion with Fruhling revealed that the 
USG and the Government of Sweden are generally on the same page in 
working together to advance the CPA process.  We welcome the Swedes 
stepping up with an offer to provide personnel to the AEC office, 
particularly since current donors Germany, Italy and Norway have not 
yet committed to renewing their contributions.  Along with the other 
AEC Coordinators, we have been exploring ways to focus international 
attention and drum up support on the CPA process.  The Swedes' 
offers of assistance should be welcomed.
