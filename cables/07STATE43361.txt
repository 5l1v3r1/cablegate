SUBJECT: GUIDANCE:  STATEMENT FOR UNSCR 1701 
CONSULTATIONS, APRIL 5 
 
¶1.  (U)  USUN is authorized to draw from the points in para 2 
below during consultations on UNSC resolution 1701 currently 
scheduled for April 5. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin points. 
 
--  We welcome the Secretary General's report on progress in 
the implementation on UNSC resolution 1701 and express our 
appreciation to the Special Representative and his staff. 
 
--  We applaud the efforts of UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed 
Forces to implement key provisions of 1701, including the 
arms free area south of the Litani River.  The speed of this 
historic deployment and UNIFIL's robust rules of engagement 
set a new standard for UN peacekeeping operations.  We remain 
encouraged by Israeli and Lebanese cooperation with UNIFIL 
and look forward to further coordination agreements with 
UNIFIL through tripartite meetings. 
 
--  We remain deeply concerned about arms transfers across 
the Lebanese border that are not authorized by either the 
Government of Lebanon or UNIFIL.  Arms transfers to Hizballah 
- as the initiator of the conflict that led to UNSC 
resolution 1701 - requires particular scrutiny.  As the 
report notes, Hizballah's public announcement that it has 
rearmed and is operating in southern Lebanon is an "open 
admission of activities that constitute a direct violation of 
relevant provisions of resolution 1701." 
 
--  In this context, we strongly support the Secretary 
General's intention to dispatch an independent mission to 
evaluate the security of Lebanon's entire border with Syria, 
to deliver its report and recommendations to strengthen the 
embargo before the next UNSCR 1701 report due in June. 
Additionally, we encourage this mission to evaluate the 
efforts of key regional neighbors, namely Syria and Iran, to 
comply with this embargo. 
 
-- We appreciate the Secretary General's appeals for proof of 
life of the two abducted Israeli soldiers; however, while we 
encourage this humanitarian gesture, we urge Hizballah to 
immediately and unconditionally release Eldad Regev and Ehud 
Goldwasser and allow them to return to their families. 
Hizballah's public refusal to immediately release the 
soldiers is a rejection of this Council's clear message in 
resolution 1701. 
 
--  Recognizing the importance of a permanent solution to the 
Sheba'a Farms issue, we reiterate resolution of this issue 
remains contingent upon the delineation of the entire border 
between the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon.  We note the 
Security Council has authorized the Secretariat to review 
relevant material and develop an accurate territorial 
definition of the area in dispute -- the Sheba'a Farms area, 
not to revisit the accuracy of the Blue Line determination in 
2000 or to determine the sovereignty of Sheba,a. 
Additionally, proposals on the Lebanese seven-point plan 
require careful consideration of the political and security 
needs of all parties. 
 
--  We reiterate our strong support for the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, unity, and political independence of 
Lebanon within its internationally recognized borders and 
under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of 
Lebanon and our full support for the legitimate and 
democratically-elected Government of Lebanon.  We remain 
concerned about the continued closure of the Lebanese 
Parliament which prevents the parliament from fulfilling its 
legislative responsibilities and call for full respect of the 
democratic institutions of the country, in conformity with 
its constitution. 
 
End points.
