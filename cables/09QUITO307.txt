SUBJECT: ECUADOR'S INITIAL RESPONSE TO H1N1 FLU 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) In response to global outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, the GOE 
has declared a national "State of Exception."  The GOE response is 
continuing to take shape, but as of today, it has implemented the 
following measures: 
 
--The GOE banned imports of pork and pork products from the United 
States and Mexico on April 28.  The Embassy understands that that 
ban was dropped on April 30, and replaced by a 30-day ban on the 
importation of live animals and genetic material, but we have not 
seen the decree.  The Embassy informed GOE agricultural officials 
that the ban on pork products was unjustified.  We will review the 
new decree and respond accordingly. 
 
--The GOE has begun screening passengers at airports and seaports, 
and is restricting charter flights to and from Mexico.  It has also 
begun restricting passenger flight arrivals exclusively to Quito and 
Guayaquil, and cargo flight arrivals to Quito, Latacunga, and 
Guayaquil.  This has created complications for USG military planes 
arriving at the Manta Forward Operating Location (FOL), which DAO 
has not yet been able to resolve. 
 
--There were three suspected cases of H1N1 in Ecuador reported the 
week of April 27, but GOE officials say it appears that these were 
strains of common flu.  (Note: Ecuador does not as yet have H1N1 
testing materials, but hopes to have some by May 4.) 
 
--The GOE has a pandemic influenza response plan that was introduced 
in August 2008, but the Embassy does not believe that it has ever 
been implemented.  Questions remain whether the Government's level 
of preparedness matches what is outlined in the plan. 
 
--The Ministry of Health has requested 150,000 doses of Tamiflu from 
the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO).  It expects 5,000 of 
these doses to arrive on May 7.  It does not appear that the GOE has 
other stockpiles of Tamiflu. 
 
--The Mission is working in close coordination with Overseas Citizen 
Services in Washington, D.C. to keep the American citizen community 
apprised of recent developments.  Per Department guidance, an 
initial warden message was sent on April 27 to all wardens and 
registered Americans in Ecuador, providing the Department 
recommended websites for information pertaining to H1N1.  An 
additional message was sent to all wardens and registrants on April 
30 outlining the GOE response and preventative measures outlined 
above.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and inform 
the American citizen community accordingly. 
 
--The Ambassador will hold a town-hall meeting for Mission employees 
and family members on May 4 to discuss Mission preparations and 
necessary precautions.
