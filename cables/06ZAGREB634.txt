¶1. (U) Croatia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the 
following statement on May 22 (informal Embassy 
translation): 
-- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration 
of the Republic of Croatia expresses its satisfaction 
regarding the establishment of a new Iraqi government led by 
Nouri Kamil Al Maliki. 
 
-- The confirmation of the new Government constitutes an 
important step in building a safe, democratic, prosperous 
and integrated Iraq, to the benefit of all its citizens, as 
well as an important step in the stabilization of the whole 
region. 
 
-- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration 
especially welcomes the fact that representatives of all 
major ethnic and religious communities from Iraq are 
included in the new government of national unity, which 
should ensure the best prospects for meeting the challenges 
facing the country and the best foundations for its future. 
The Republic of Croatia expresses its most sincere 
congratulations to Prime Minister Al Maliki and his 
Government, wishes them much success, and uses this 
opportunity to reassert its desire to strengthen and advance 
the relations and cooperation between the two countries.

premises for its diplomatic mission in Baghdad. 
Efforts to co-locate within the Polish Embassy were 
unsuccessful due to lack of space.
