SUBJECT: UK SHARES U.S. OBJECTIVES FOR PALESTINIAN AHLC 
 
REF: STATE 55527 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The UK "very much" supports the U.S. objectives for 
the June 8 Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) of Palestinian 
donors, according to Alice Mann, Deputy Head of the 
Palestinian Program at the UK Department for International 
Development (DFID).  Responding to reftel points, she said 
the three main issues for the UK are: lobbying others, 
particularly Gulf States, to step up funding for the 
Palestinian Authority; pressing Israel for more details on 
how they plan to reduce movement and access constraints in 
the West Bank; and calling for full humanitarian access to 
Gaza. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mann said the UK plans to announce GBP 10 million 
(approx. $16 million) in direct budget support for the 
Palestinian Authority and asked that we keep this close hold. 
 The funds will be delivered immediately to the World Bank 
Trust Fund to help bridge immediate needs until other donor 
funds become available.  Melinda Simmons, DFID Deputy 
Director for Middle East (approximately equivalent to a DAS), 
will lead the UK delegation.
