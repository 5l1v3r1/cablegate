¶1. (SBU) As requested in ref A, post has been in contact with 
French firm "M.C.E." on numerous occasions.  As detailed in ref

details requested or arranging site visits to view the miniature 
integrated GPS/INS systems in question.

post blue lantern officer, the company manager wrote the 
following: 
 
begin informal translation 
 
MCE specializes in physical measurements with significant export 
activities.  We work with correspondents located in the 
following countries:  India, Pakistan, UAE. 
 
Our request is the following: To which of the above listed 
countries can we export material (originating from) BEI Systron? 
To date, we have no declared clients but numerous commercial 
contacts anticipate multiple sales possibilities.  It would be 
regrettable, if after an order is taken, that we might be 
refused an export license.  In order to avoid this situation, it 
seems indispensable to know with which countries we can work. 
 
end information translation 
 
¶3. (U) Post has faxed a copy of the original letter in French to 
PM/DTCC and EUR/WE.
