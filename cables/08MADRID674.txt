SUBJECT: SPAIN DISAPPOINTED REGARDING USG UNHRC DECISION 
 
REF: STATE 61034 
 
(SBU) On June 12, Poloff informed the Spanish MFA Director of 
Human Rights, Fernando Fernandez-Arias Minuesa, of the USG 
decision to disengage from the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) 
per reftel.  Fernandez-Arias indicated that the GOS was 
disappointed in the decision, but understood USG reasons, and 
indeed shared some of the frustration with the HRC, 
specifically citing the March 2008 amendment to the mandate 
of the Special Rapporteur.  He said, however, that the HRC 
was in its infancy, and as such, it would be premature to 
conclude that it was wholly ineffective.  Fernandez-Arias 
said USG involvement and support in the promotion of human 
rights was critical.  Poloff reiterated the USG's commitment 
to intensify its engagement on human rights protection and 
promotion in other venues, and specifically the General 
Assembly's Third Committee.
