SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON UNCHR RESOLUTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
IN CUBA, APRIL 13, 2004 
 
 
¶1. Op-ed by Julieta Castellanos in Tegucigalpa-based 
moderate daily "El Heraldo" on 4/13 entitled "The aggression 
towards Cuba."  "The last foreign policy move has placed our 
country in the disgraceful situation of becoming the 
backyard of a powerful country.  Public officials are losing 
credibility, and nobody in Honduras or abroad believes this 
decision is ours.  The presidential decision pleases 
Washington and the Cuban-American community, not the 
Honduran nor the Cuban people." 
 
"As the head of our foreign policy, the aggression towards 
Cuba is the responsibility of President Maduro and his 
government.  It shouldn't be understood as an aggression of 
the Honduran people towards Cuba." 
 
¶2. Op-ed by Gaspar Vallecillo in Tegucigalpa-based moderate 
daily "El Heraldo" on 4/13 entitled "The principles of 
Maduro and human rights."  "Maduro doesn't surprise us 
anymore with his acts, and his constant attempts to tarnish 
the international image of Honduras, confirming that we're 
not identified with him in any way." 
 
"The resolution on Cuba was the last reckless initiative of 
the President.  To say that he did it because of his 
`principles' is another attempt to justify his imprudent 
actions.  What principles is he talking about, when our 
human rights are being violated every day?" 
 
"If he had any principles, he wouldn't have talked in the 
name of the people he has persistently lied to.  Maduro's 
principles have offended us all."
