Pol/Econoff delivered ref A demarche on August 21 to MFA 
Disarmament Section Head Shafiq Mohammed Daleh. Daleh said he 
supports First Committee and UNGA reform in general.  In 
response to ref A asking the ROYG to submit its views to the 
UNGA First Committee and to share a copy with the USG, Daleh 
replied that while his section was familiar with aspects of 
UNGA resolution 58/41 as well as 58/126 and 58/316 (ref B), 
he would need to carefully study the reform issue and then 
submit it to senior MFA officials.
