CLOSURE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 62420 
 
¶1.  (SBU) RefCord and PolOff delivered reftel demarche on 
June 18 to Director of Refugees Judy Mtawali at the Ministry 
of Home Affairs (MHA), in the absence from Dar es Salaam of 
both the Minister and Deputy Minister of Home Affairs. In 
response to encouragement of a humane approach to the 
upcoming official closure of Mtabila, Mtawali stressed that 
the GOT is taking a flexible approach to the closing of the 
camp and understands that Mtabila will not be closed by the 
previously agreed deadline of June 30,2009. However, Mtawali 
also restated the GOT's firm intention to move forward with 
refugee repatriation as quickly as possible. RefCord also 
raised the issue of naturalization of the 1972 Burundian 
population.  Mtawali stated that guidance on this issue has 
come from President Kikwete.  Tanzania particularly wants to 
avoid having Burundian enclaves that might have an undue 
influence on local politics. Mtawali also said that the GOT's 
position is affected by the memory of having Rwandan refugees 
return to Rwanda after having been granted citizenship in 
Tanzania. 
 
¶2.  (U) RefCord and PolOff also met with UNHCR Representative 
Yacoub El Hillo and Deputy Representative Indrika Ratwatte, 
relaying the information from reftel.  El Hillo said that 
UNHCR continues to work behind the scenes with GOT officials 
to ensure that the repatriation and local integration of 
Burundian refugees adheres to international law and 
standards. El Hillo indicated that the number of refugees 
registering for repatriation convoys out of Mtabila continues 
to be low but that they will wait to see how the situation 
develops during the summer months, which are traditionally 
the peak period for return. In regards to local integration 
of the 1972 "Old Caseload" Burundian refugee population, El 
Hillo said that UNHCR anticipates 30 percent of the 
approximately 170,000 refugees will have their citizenship 
applications denied in the first review. He estimated that 
one-half to two-thirds of those cases will be approved on 
appeal and that UNHCR will need to seek alternative solutions 
(repatriation, resettlement) for the remaining population. 
 
¶3.  (U) UNHCR Deputy Director Ratwatte asked for USG 
assistance in processing refugees for resettlement out of 
Kanembwa Processing Center at an expedited pace. He expressed 
concern that Kanembwa is full, which will prohibit UNHCR from 
moving more individuals under resettlement consideration out 
of the camps and into the processing center. This is a key 
element of UNHCR's attempt to encourage repatriation - by 
reducing the temptation for refugees to stay in the camps in 
the hope of being accepted for resettlement consideration as 
their neighbors have been accepted.
