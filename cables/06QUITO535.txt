¶1.  (SBU) PolChief presented suggested RefTel points for 
Board member statements at the March 6 IAEA Board of 
Governors meeting to MFA U/S Mauricio Montalvo on March 3. 
Montalvo indicated GOE agreement that the DG report met 
conditions in the Board's earlier resolution to refer Iran to 
the UNSC, and also agreed that another IAEA resolution was 
not necessary.  Montalvo thanked PolChief for the points, 
saying the GOE would continue to support international 
pressure on Iran. 
 
¶2.  (U) PolOff on February 10 delivered RefTel points on the 
February 4 IAEA resolution reporting Iran to the UNSC in a 
diplomatic note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The MFA 
on February 23 responded by diplomatic note, below. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MFA Text: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador, Bureau of 
Multilateral Affairs and International Organizations, 
presents its compliments to the Honorable Embassy of the 
United States, and it is pleased to thank you for your 
diplomatic note No. POL 027/06 of February 10 of this year, 
through which you convey the U.S. position on the resolution 
adopted February 4, 2006 by the Board of Governors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on the nuclear 
program of Iran. 
 
In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bureau of 
Multilateral Affairs and International Organizations, is 
pleased to inform the U.S. that Ecuador voted in favor of 
said resolution upon considering it as an instrument that 
would strengthen multilateralism and nonproliferation 
objectives.  In addition, Ecuador reiterated its position of 
recognizing the inalienable right of all the countries to 
research and produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in 
accordance with the Treaty of Nonproliferation, the 
agreements of safeguards, and other instruments on the matter. 
 
Ecuador,s position is based on its belonging to the first 
area free from nuclear weapons, and its firm commitment to 
nonproliferation, and to the mission of the IAEA.  In this 
context, the government of Ecuador has always assigned the 
greatest importance to the process of diplomatic dialogue and 
consensus on all international conflicts, which is why as a 
member of the Board of Governors, Ecuador has supported the 
negotiations pushed by the EU3, and has expressed on several 
occasions its concern over Iran,s uranium enrichment 
activities. 
 
The lack of a global consensus on disarmament and 
nonproliferation, the threat of international terrorism, and 
Western--Middle Eastern intolerance, reveal the need for 
nations to support the agencies of the United Nations and 
demonstrate transparency in its actions. 
 
The international community cannot tolerate the proliferation 
and the adoption of unilateral measures that endanger the 
integrity of the world regimen and peace.  In this regard, 
Ecuador requests from Teheran that it reengage in 
negotiations, ratify the Additional Protocol, and reconsider 
its decision to suspend all the voluntary measures of 
confidence. 
 
The world looks with concern at the position of Iran and thus 
IAEA has taken an additional step to avoid the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons.  Iran needs to produce definitive proof 
that it has renounced its intent to enrich uranium. 
 
Ecuador considers that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, whose activities enjoy the complete credibility of 
the world, a fact proven by the awarding of the 2005 Nobel 
Peace Prize to Director General Mohamed ElBaradei and the 
IAEA, has the full ability to resolve this crisis through 
diplomatic channels, but that the United Nations Security 
Council be informed on this issue by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency.  The solution to this problem has to come from 
the framework of the multilateral relations. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador, General Bureau of 
Multilateral Policy and International Agencies, takes 
advantage of the opportunity to reiterate to the Honorable 
Embassy of the United States in Ecuador, the assurances of 
its highest and most distinguished consideration.  End MFA
