1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) of Acetone Solutions, 
Glendale Park, #02-12, Singapore (Acetone). The item in question is 
one gyrostabilized camera exported to AceTone on or about November 
21, 2007 and valued at USD 4,950.  The item is classified under 
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 7B994 and is controlled 
for anti-terrorism (AT) reasons.  The exporter was Cloud Cap 
Technology of Hood River, Oregon. 
 
¶3.  A review of the company's web site (www.acetone-solutions.com) 
reveals that the company is primarily a reseller of various 
electronics products.  It is not registered as a corporate entity 
with the Singapore companies registry. 
 
¶4.  On April 22, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs, met with Mr. Quentin Goh, owner of Acetone.  The 
meeting occurred at the United States Embassy.  Mr. Goh had 
requested not to meet at the business address of the company as it 
is a home based business and Mr. Goh indicated he did not wish to 
meet in his home.  Mr. Goh stated that he runs the company as a sole 
proprietorship and that he is a one-man show.  He operates primarily 
as a sourcing company and reseller of various products. His 
customers are primarily Singapore research institutes and so-called 
A-Star entities.  A-Star is the Singapore government Agency for 
Science Technology and Research.  Acetone is the exclusive 
representative of some companies and a reseller for some other 
companies (such as Cloud Cap).  Acetone reexports very few items (to 
date, only to Australia). 
 
¶5.  As to the particular item in question, Mr. Goh stated that this 
item was procured on behalf of Nayang Technological University in 
response to a public RFQ from the Univrsity.  Mr. Goh provided 
documentation confirmin receipt of the item and delivery to Nayang 
Techological University on November 28, 2008.  ECO alsoreviewed 
P.O. NTU000EP007010981 from Nanyang Tecnological University.  All 
the documents were cosistent with the information orally provided 
by r. Goh. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Acetone appeard to be a suitable recipient 
of the commodities shipped since Acetone cooperated with the PSV, 
provided ECO with access to documents showing final disposition of 
the items and operates a line of business consistent with the use of 
the items.  Also, Acetone was informed of applicable export control 
rules (especially those relating to reexports to sanctioned 
countries) and indicated its intent to comply with them.
