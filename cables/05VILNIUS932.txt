REF: SECSTATE 158420 
 
We delivered reftel points on the Iraqi constitution to 
Vaclovas Salkauskas, the new Head of the MFA's Africa and 
Middle East Division, on September 7, and urged him to 
recommend that the GOL issue a congratulatory statement to 
the Iraqi people.  Salkauskas said that he is still gathering 
the information he needs to be able to present such a 
recommendation to GOL leadership.  He said the Secretary's 
statement and the fact sheet on the constitution will be of 
great use in his efforts.  Salkauskas offered that the 
successful completion of the October referendum may be an 
opportune time for the GOL to make a new statement of support 
for the Iraqi people.  He also told us that the GOL is 
currently in discussion with the Iraqi government to 
establish diplomatic relations.
