¶1.  (SBU) During a meeting with FM Bruno Stagno on August 19, 
Ambassador Cianchette personally invited the GOCR to 
participate in the September 24 leaders, meeting on trade 
and prosperity in New York.  Stagno stated that the GOCR plan 
was for President Oscar Arias, Minister of Foreign Trade 
(COMEX) Marco Vinicio Ruiz, Costa Rican Ambassador to 
Washington Tomas Duenas, and Stagno to attend.  Stagno hoped 
the summit would take place in the morning, to accommodate 
President Arias, address to the UNGA that afternoon. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Separately, Poloffs and Econoff also delivered Ref 
A demarche to relevant staff-level contacts at the MFA and 
COMEX.  In addition, we provided the Costa Rican Embassy in 
Washington with the demarche documentation including the 
non-paper on the Alliance for Growth and Prosperity concept. 
Our interlocutors all expressed interest in commenting, but 
asked for a few more days to respond. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Stagno has supported the Leaders, 
Meeting idea since we first broached it, and the GOCR is 
proposing a heavyweight delegation.  This suggests that the 
GOCR will be an engaged and (hopefully) helpful participant. 
We are also pleased that the idea of a special CAFTA-DR event 
for Costa Rica seems to have been discarded (Ref B).  Stagno 
and none of our other interlocutors raised it.  We will 
forward any additional information or reaction to the AGP 
proposal that we glean.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶4.  (U) ACTION REQUEST:  Please advise timing/venue details 
for the summit as soon as available.  Other leaders may also 
have schedule issues to consider on September 24.
