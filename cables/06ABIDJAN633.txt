SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE:  UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS RESTART 
UNLIMITED STRIKE 
 
REF: A) ABIDJAN 589 B) ABIDJAN 616 
 
¶1.  (U) The group of university professors known as 
Coordination Nationale des Enseignants du Superieur et des 
Chercheurs (CNEC) has again commenced an unlimited strike 
after a two-week truce in which it considered the options put 
forth by the Council of Ministers (ref A).  On June 9, the 
members of CNEC voted against the offered research allowances 
and extended retirement conditions.  The leader of CNEC, Dr. 
Flavien Traore, acknowledged the government's effort but 
stated that what was offered didn't meet CNEC's most 
important demands, a wage and housing allowance increase. 
Traore added that during the two-week truce, CNEC had 
attempted to negotiate for these increases, but the 
government refused to include them in its final offer. 
 
¶2.  (U) Both university and secondary school students will be 
effected by the strike.  It is likely too late in the 
university academic year to recover time lost in the strikes 
and the year may therefore have to be repeated by students. 
University professors also administer the high school 
exit/university entrance exam, the baccalaureat (bac), 
scheduled for August.  If the strike is still in place at 
that time, students will be unable to proceed to university. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  The resumption of the strike seems 
certain to generate considerable ill will among students and 
their parents, who will raise the pressure on both professors 
and the Prime Minister to reach a settlement.  The rising 
frustration level will also create ready opportunities for 
the thuggish student association, FESCI (ref B), to try to 
undermine the Prime Minister by going back out on the streets 
in protest.
