¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Russian Federal Veterinary 
and Phytosanitary Surveillance Service (VPSS) 
advised via official letter dated December 5, 
2008, that it had delisted an additional 7 out of 
9 pork facilities that were recently inspected as 
part of a joint audit. These results immediately 
follow the findings of November 27, 2008, in 
which VPPS also delisted 7 out of 9 pork plants 
(REF A). The results of the remaining 11 pork 
facilities which were audited are still pending. 
Mirroring the November 27th letter, VPSS vowed 
that it will intensify border control on all pork 
products from the two establishments which were 
not delisted.  FAS Moscow received the VPSS 
letter on December 9, 2008, and transmitted it 
plus a courtesy translation to USDA headquarters 
on the same day.  END SUMMARY.

Acting Assistant Administrator 
Office of International Affairs

Dr. Ronald K. Jones 
 
Dear Dr. Jones, 
 
The Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary 
Surveillance Service (VPSS) extends its regards 
to the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), 
USDA and, in addition to the letter #FS-NV- 
2/12067 of November 27, 2008, informs you of the 
following: 
 
VPSSQ specialists completed analysis of the 
results of the audit of U.S. pork establishments 
that was conducted in the period from October 20 
until October 23, 2008. The results showed that 7 
establishments (# 3W, 687, 244 I, 6835, 20239, 
21898, and 31965) did not comply with the Russian 
requirements among 9 establishments inspected 
during that period. Therefore, the mentioned 
establishments are excluded from the list of U.S. 
establishments approved for the export of pork 
and pork by-products to the Russian Federation 
starting December 20, 2008. 
 
We also inform you that VPSS will intensify 
control on the products from establishments # 
3648 and #21059 in which the inspectors revealed 
insignificant violations of the Russian 
veterinary-sanitary requirements and norms. 
 
Dr. Jones, let me assure you of my highest 
esteem. 
 
Deputy Head 
 
N.A. Vlasov
