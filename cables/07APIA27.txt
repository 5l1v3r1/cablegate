¶1. (SBU) Post grants country clearance for Foreign Service 
National Investigator (FSNI) Raymond W. Millar for travel to 
Apia, Samoa, from February 19-25, 2007, in order to conduct 
background investigations and security interviews and to train 
FSNI Apia. 
 
¶2. (U) Post understands that no assistance from the Embassy is 
requested. If necessary the Embassy can be contacted during 
business hours at telephone 21631 and 21436 and at 21514, 
604221, or 7771776 after duty hours. Callers from outside Samoa 
should first dial country code 685. 
 
¶3. (U) American citizens visiting Samoa for 60 days or less (for 
either official or private travel) may enter the country without 
a visa. Immigration officials grant entry permits on arrival. 
All visitors are required to pay a 40-tala (approximately 15.50 
USD) tax at the airport upon departure from Samoa. 
 
¶4. (U) Samoa is considered a low threat environment. Theft and 
petty crimes sometimes occur, but are usually 
non-confrontational in nature. There are no terrorist groups or 
support groups believed to be operating in Samoa at this time. 
Visitors should remain vigilant with regard to their personal 
security and exercise caution during their stay. They should 
also be aware of the State Department's Consular Information 
sheet for Samoa and the most recent worldwide caution public 
announcements, which are available via the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov.
