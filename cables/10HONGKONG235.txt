REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated December 28, 2009 (01210102) 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment verification (PSV) at China Ocean Oilfields Services 
(HK) Ltd (China Ocean Services). The item in question for this PSV 
is an underwater robotic arm system exported to China Ocean Services 
on or about February 25, 2009.  According to information provided by 
OEA, this system is likely classified under Export Control 
Classification Number 8A002.i.2, meaning that it can be shipped 
license free to Hong Kong but would, in virtually all circumstances, 
require a license for export to mainland China.  The exporter was 
Shilling Robotics of Davis, California. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, China Ocean 
Services has been in existence since 1982.  Its paid up share 
capital is the Hong Kong equivalent of approximately USD 60 million. 
 The Hong Kong Companies Registry lists multiple mainland Chinese 
nationals as directors. 
 
¶4.  According to the company's web site, China National Offshore Oil 
Corporation (www.cnooc.com.cn) is the largest offshore oil and gas 
producer in China.  It is the parent organization of China Ocean 
Services. 
 
¶5.  On January 11, 2010, ECO and FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie 
Chan visited the company at the address noted above and met with Mr. 
Fu, Shuang Xi, Manager, BGCC Department.  Mr. Fu stated that the 
company is a freight forwarder that serves its parent company in 
Mainland China. 
 
¶6.  As to the specific shipment in question, Mr. Fu provided 
information only about a subsequent shipment from Shilling Robotics. 
 However, he called China Offshore Fugro Geosolutions (Shenzhen) Co. 
Ltd. (the customer listed on the Shilling documents provided by 
OEA).  That office provided documentation confirming that the item 
in question had been received by Fugro in Shenzhen using the 
services of another freight forwarder.  According to Mr. Fu, China 
Ocean Services does not typically apply for export licenses in Hong 
Kong. He stated that China Ocean Services applies for licenses when 
requested by the exporter or consignee. 
 
¶7.  Mr. Fu was open and forthcoming during the meeting.  ECO 
provided additional information on export controls to Mr. Fu by 
subsequent e-mail.  As to the particular shipment in question, ECO 
recommends an outreach be conducted at Shilling Robotics as it 
appears that this item may have been shipped to mainland China in 
violation of U.S. and (likely) Hong Kong law (assuming that the 
commodity is properly classified as 8A002.i.2).
