SUBJECT:  CG DISCUSSES FOREIGN AFFAIRS WITH SAG MP SKOSANA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On November 12, 2008 the CG, PolOff and PolAsst met with 
Moleeane Skosana, a member of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), and 
one of three House Chairpersons of the National Assembly as well as 
a member of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Foreign 
Affairs. Mr. Skosana has had a long parliamentary career and has 
been a member of parliament since 1994.  In 1998 he was appointed 
Minister of Correctional Services by President Mandela and continued 
to serve in President Mbeki's Cabinet until 2004. In 2007, Skosana 
was appointed one of three House Chairpersons of the National 
Assembly supporting the Speaker of Parliament. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) As a member of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on 
Foreign Affairs, Skosana discussed some of the topics dealt with by 
the Committee. Although Zimbabwe is a key issue that is discussed 
within individual political parties, Skosana said it is not widely 
discussed within the national government. He indicated that the SAG 
is primarily concerned with upholding the international principles 
of non-interference and sovereignty. He feels that one of the 
reasons the SAG is soft on Zimbabwe is because it fears any 
intervention will be opening the door for other African nations to 
act in a similar manner against South Africa in the future should 
the need arise. He continued by saying the only solution to the 
Zimbabwe crises is to involve civil society in the matter. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mr. Skosana was also critical of the Southern African 
Development Communities (SADC) appointment of Thabo Mbeki as sole 
mediator in the Zimbabwe crisis. He felt mediation efforts should 
have been undertaken by all SADC countries with a joint plan to deal 
with Zimbabwe. He also stated that Mbeki was never going to be 
successful in resolving the Zimbabwe crisis since Mugabe, the elder 
statesman, views Mbeki as his junior and would, therefore, not take 
instructions from him. One of the most important matters confronting 
SADC is devising an acceptable exit strategy for Robert Mugabe and 
his cabinet, but Skosana also felt that the only possible solution 
for Zimbabwe is for the U.S. to become involved in the matter and 
hopes that President-elect Obama will intervene in Zimbabwe. Mr. 
Skosana also indicated that the SAG will not give aid to Zimbabwe 
without stringent conditions being met. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Skosana indicated that South Africa was working closely 
with SADC to deploy more troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
He said the SAG feels a particular responsibility towards the DRC as 
it initially brokered the peace deal in the region. Skosana also 
mentioned that South Africa was relying on the African Union and the 
United Nations to help resolve the situation in Sudan. 
 
¶5. (SBU) When questioned about U.S.-SA relations, Skosana said he 
feels relations with the U.S. will strengthen following the election 
of President-elect Obama. He found it encouraging that Senator Obama 
expressed a desire to engage leaders in Cuba, other Latin American 
countries and the Middle East.  Skosana said in the past SA-U.S. 
relations on an international political level were shaped more by 
the U.S. attitude to and treatment of other countries especially the 
Middle East, than by its treatment of SA.  The Portfolio Committee 
on Foreign Affairs feels that the Bush Administration has done well 
with regards to aid for Africa, in fact far better than the Clinton 
Administration, but still feels that U.S. relations with the rest of 
the world is the most important factor in furthering SA-U.S. 
relations. Skosana hopes that President-elect Obama will have a 
Qrelations. Skosana hopes that President-elect Obama will have a 
greater willingness to listen to the opinions of and engage with 
other nations on a more open level. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Skosana said his party, the IFP, did not foresee any major 
loss in membership as a result of the new political party, which has 
broken away from the ruling ANC party. IFP members are mostly Zulu 
and based in the Kwa-Zulu/Natal province, a traditional Inkhata 
stronghold, and would, in all likelihood, remain that way. He said 
the IFP would not form any coalition before the elections, but did 
not rule out the possibility of a coalition with the new party after 
the election.
