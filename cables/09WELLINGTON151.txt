(C)  On June 12, Econoff delivered reftel demarche to Joe Ballard, 
Policy Officer, International Security and Disarmament Division of 
New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  In 
reaction to the delivered talking points, Mr. Ballard said that 
GNZ's position was similar to U.S. and agreed that a strong 
national statement would be delivered by New Zealand demanding that 
Iran and Syria comply with their international obligations. Mr. 
Ballard said that GNZ as a member of the Board of Governors of the 
IAEA takes compliance quite seriously.  Mr. Ballard said his 
Mission would also stress in their  statement, at the upcoming June 
15-19 IAEA meeting, that Iran should take every opportunity to work 
more closely with the EU 3 + 3 process.
