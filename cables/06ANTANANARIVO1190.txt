¶1. (SBU) On October 21, upon the return from Saudi Arabia of Ahmed 
Abdallah Sambi, President of the Union of the Comoros, DCM spoke to 
him by telephone to convey Ref A demarche regarding the vote for a 
non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Based on the most current information available, the DCM 
noted that the last vote had been the 35th round with Guatemala 
retaining the lead by 103 votes to 81 for Venezuela, and he 
expressed appreciation for the Comoros' steadfast support of 
Guatemala's candidacy.  He told President Sambi that voting had 
apparently been suspended until Wednesday, October 25, in an effort 
to break the impasse.  He noted that Venezuela's intransigence in 
being unwilling to withdraw, or even to back a compromise third 
candidate, showed just why Venezuela would be an irresponsible 
member of the UNSC.  The DCM sought Sambi's ongoing support of 
Guatemala on October 25 should the contest continue to pit that 
nation against Venezuela.  Sambi replied that this would not be a 
problem. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Sambi's support appears to be solid, but lines of 
communication between the Comoros and New York are far more fragile. 
 For this reason Post reiterates the suggestion in Refs B and C that 
USUN and/or AF pursue the lobbying effort locally with the Comoran 
PermRep.
