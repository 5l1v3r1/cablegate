SUBJ: CANADA: Views on Aviation Security, Diplomatic Pouch and VCDR 
 
Ref: State 112373 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Canada will attend the ICAO AVSEC meeting in Montreal 
in September.  As Canada shares U.S. concerns about inspection of 
the diplomatic pouch and believes strongly in its inviolability, the 
GoC will align itself with our interests. The Canadian position, 
however, is still being developed and officials are inclined at this 
juncture to consider pressing for explicit language in the ICAO 
Manual to prohibit use of "X-ray or other technological intrusion" 
of diplomatic bags.  The GoC intends to coordinate with USG and will 
shares its official position with us as soon as possible.  The GoC 
relayed its understanding that neither Australia nor New Zealand 
share the American/Canadian concerns, suggesting that little support 
can be expected from that quarter.  End summary. 
¶2.  Embassy provided demarche to Canada's Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) and to Transport Canada (TC) 
on July 13.  Initial discussions with Bernard Pilon, Chief of Issues 
Management at Transport Canada made it clear that the GoC shares USG 
concerns about inspection of the diplomatic pouch, and has had these 
concerns for some time.  Pilon asserted that Canada strongly 
supports our position that the VCDR prohibits any search that 
reveals the contents of the pouch.  Canada will attend the ICAO 
AVSEC Panel meeting in September. Pilon noted, however, that DFAIT 
has the lead in developing Canada's official position. 
¶3.  Emboff next spoke with Diane Germain, Director of Fleet Mail at 
DFAIT, and the principal for that department on this issue.  Germain 
seconded Pilon's position and reinforced the message that Canada 
believes strongly in the inviolability of the diplomatic pouch. 
Germain indicated, however, that her preference at this juncture is 
to seek to alter the ICAO Security Manual to insert an explicit 
prohibition of using "X-ray and other technological intrusion" with 
respect to the diplomatic pouch. Germain also expressed support for 
the establishment of a working group 
¶4.  A discussion on August 3 with Marc Richard, who is handling the 
issue at DFAIT while Germain is on vacation, revealed that the 
official GoC position for use at the September meeting is just now 
being drafted; DFAIT intends to provide the Canadian position to us 
as soon as possible, and likely well in advance of the meeting. 
Richard noted that his office has received indications from 
Australia and New Zealand that neither country shares the concern 
expressed by Canada and the United States; on the other hand, the UK 
apparently does share our concern on this matter.
