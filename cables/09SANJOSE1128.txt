SUBJECT: COSTA RICA SECURITY DIALOGUE 
 
REF: STATE 112900 
 
¶1.  Embassy San Jose reports that the United States does not have 
an established security dialogue with Costa Rica.  However, in the 
context of counter-narcotics and law enforcement cooperation, Post 
entities such as DEA and the Office of Defense Representative (ODR) 
work closely with their counterparts on counterdrug operations, 
training, and humanitarian support missions.  Additionally, via the 
Merida Initiative we have quarterly meetings to review progress 
towards achievement of project goals and objectives such as: 
Breaking the Power and Impunity of Criminal Organizations; and 
Assisting the Government of Costa Rica in Strengthening its Border, 
Air, and Maritime controls.  These meetings are relatively informal 
and are useful opportunities to exchange information. 
Additionally, we have a bilateral maritime agreement with Costa 
Rica to coordinate maritime seizures of illicit trafficking in 
Costa Rican waters. 
 
 
 
 
 
¶2. Costa Rica does not maintain a military, but does have a 
Ministry of Public Security that is charged with both domestic and 
national security.  Its largest formation of police officers is a 
10,000 person uniformed police force.
