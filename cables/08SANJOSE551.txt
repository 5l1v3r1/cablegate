¶1. (U) Following up on an official GOCR request, from June 
18-22 five U.S. Army engineers built a Bailey-type metal 
bridge just south of Quepos, Costa Rica, over the Guabo 
River.  The SOUTHCOM-allocated engineers also re-surveyed 
bridges and/or bridging sites located throughout the country 
that had been inspected last December (Ref A) as a result of 
devastating floods in October 2007.  The new surveys and 
actual bridge construction come in the immediate aftermath of 
the effects of Tropical Storm Alma in mid-May.  Using 
GOCR-supplied materials, the engineers worked hand-in-hand 
with two CNE (Costa Rica's FEMA-equivalent) engineers and 
local workers to construct the Guabo bridge, passing along 
valuable bridge-building techniques and best practices. 
 
¶2. (U) As a result of flooding from Tropical Storm Alma, four 
local Costa Ricans (including two children) were killed 
trying to cross the old bridge over the Guabo River.  The new 
Bailey-type bridge, 34 meters long, increases the height of 
the bridge by almost two meters and will allow light vehicles 
to cross the river such as cars, pick-ups and buses.  The new 
bridge will directly (and positively) affect the lives of 
nearly 4000 Costa Ricans in this community. 
 
¶3. (U) The CNE engineers who worked with our SOUTHCOM 
engineers told us they learned a lot and appreciated the 
training.  One of them, Jorge Fallas, said that this was the 
first time they had any instruction or practice in the 
construction of a Bailey-type bridge and would use that 
knowledge to construct further bridges in Costa Rica. 
 
¶4. (U) The Ambassador visited the Guabo bridge site on June 
20 and was interviewed by reporters from the leading daily La 
Nacion and from television channels 6 and 13.  The print 
interview appeared on June 21 and the television coverage on 
June 23.  Media coverage referenced other successful SOUTHCOM 
humanitarian assistance projects, such as last December's 
medical readiness exercise (Ref B) and May's suspension 
bridge material airlift (Ref C) in the Talamanca area.  All 
of the reporting was positive and highlighted the benefit of 
Costa Rican-U.S. teamwork to the local communities. 
 
¶5. (U) Although not yet scheduled, the SOUTHCOM engineers 
plan to return to Costa Rica later this year to assist in the 
construction of further Bailey-type bridges located in the 
communities of Santa Rosa, Perez Zeledon; Volcan, Puntarenas, 
and Sapoa, Guanacaste.

COMMENT 
======= 
 
¶6. (SBU) As noted, this bridge construction and new surveys 
came in the wake of a specific GOCR request for U.S. military 
assistance for humanitarian projects, and are another in the 
series of our recent joint efforts.  The construction of the 
Guabo bridge clearly demonstrates the continued willingness 
of Costa Rica to engage with our military-supplied assets. 
 
¶7. (SBU) By using soft military power, the construction of 
this Bailey-type bridge directly contributed to furthering 
two of our four Mission Strategic Plan goals for Costa Rica: 
investing in people and promoting prosperity.  Post thanks 
SOUTHCOM for its support and specifically the five U.S. Army 
engineers for their valuable work.  They worked very hard in 
hot, tropical jungle conditions and put forth a positive 
image of the U.S. government and military.
