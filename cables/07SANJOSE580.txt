SUBJECT: COSTA RICA:  HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL OIC RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 35404 
 
¶1.  On March 21, as instructed in reftel, we raised the OIC 
resolution issue with Guisella Sanchez, who handles human 
rights issues in the MFA,s foreign policy division.  We 
stressed USG concern that the review of mandates outside of 
the HRC working group dedicated for such reviews would 
undermine the HRC's efforts to ensure objectivity and 
non-selectivity and would further promote, not eliminate, 
double-standards. 
 
¶2.  On March 23, Sanchez responded that Costa Rica agrees 
that all mandate review in the HRC, without 
exception, should be reviewed by the working group created 
for this task.
