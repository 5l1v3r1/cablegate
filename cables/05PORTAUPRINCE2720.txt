¶1.  (SBU) Post continues to see scattered press reports 
indicating that Haiti is considering signing an agreement 
with the Government of Venezuela to obtain petroleum at a 
discount rate via PetroCaribe.  Econ Counselor spoke to an 
official with the Ministry of Finance, who spoke directly to 
Finance Minister Henri Bazin.  Bazin indicated that Haiti was 
far from any agreement with Venezuela, and that no one in any 
position of authority from the Interim Government of Haiti 
(IGOH) had even sat down to discuss the matter with the 
government of Venezuela.  Bazin added that instead 
discussions were ongoing with the Government of Mexico to 
obtain a special deal from them on petroleum imports. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Despite the Finance Minister,s continued 
reassurances, the pressure is still on the IGOH to strike a 
deal with Venezuela.  In addition to the press reports, 
organizations that have organized demonstrations in the past 
against high prices in Haiti have publicly called on the IGOH 
to accept Venezuela,s offer to negotiate on a concessional 
deal. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Post will continue to monitor movement, 
if any, on this issue.  The high price of oil has a strong 
impact on inflation in Haiti and the possibility of a special 
deal on petroleum imports is a tempting one, if not for the 
IGOH, then for the next government scheduled to take over in 
February 2006.  END COMMENT.
