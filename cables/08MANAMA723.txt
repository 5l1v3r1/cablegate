(SBU) A/DCM delivered reftel points to MFA Bilateral 
Relations Director Dhafer Al-Umran on October 21.  Al-Umran 
reiterated Bahrain's support for democratization in 
Afghanistan, noting that the success of the 2009-2010 
elections will be critical for that process.  While Bahrain 
would likely not be able to make a financial contribution, 
the GOB would look for opportunities to provide "in kind" 
support for the electoral process in Afghanistan.
