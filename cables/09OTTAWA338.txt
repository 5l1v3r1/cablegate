¶1. (SBU) Summary: One of the so-called "Toronto 18" alleged terror 
plot to attack federal targets in Ontario in 2006 pled guilty on May 
4 to one count of participating in a terrorist activity.  Along with 
the earlier conviction of another defendant in this case as well as 
the conviction under Canada's 2001 Anti-terrorism Law of a defendant 
in another case (ref a), Canada is making progress in the successful 
prosecution of terrorists.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Canadian authorities arrested eighteen individuals (fourteen 
adults and four youths) in June 2006 in an alleged terror plot to 
attack targets in Ontario.  Police subsequently stayed charges 
against three youths and four adults in this case (ref c).  The 
court convicted one youth (whose identity is protected under 
Canadian laws) in September 2008 of participating in a terrorist 
activity (ref b); he will face sentencing on May 22.  Authorities 
expect the trials of nine other adult males in the case to begin in 
¶2010. 
 
¶3.  (U) On May 4, twenty-two year old Saad Khalid surprised the 
media and well wishers by pleading guilty in an Ontario court to one 
count of participating in a terrorist organization "with the 
intention of causing an explosion or explosions that were likely to 
cause serious bodily harm or death."  The charge carries a maximum 
penalty of ten years imprisonment.  Khalid also faces two other 
charges of knowingly participating in a terrorist group and 
receiving training for the purpose of enhancing the ability of a 
terrorist group.  However, his lawyer said on May 5 that he believes 
that the Crown will withdraw these charges.  He also explained that 
Khalid's guilty plea resulted from negotiations with Crown 
prosecutors, adding that it will be "up to them" to decide whether 
to call Khalid as a witness in the cases against the remaining nine 
adults. 
 
¶4. (U) The Court has scheduled a sentencing hearing for Khalid for 
June 22.  Details of the case are still subject to a publication ban 
to avoid tainting the trials of remaining defendants. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Comment:  Canada continues vigorously to pursue 
prosecutions of suspected terrorists, leading so far to three 
convictions in two different cases.  However, the very deliberate 
pace of the judicial proceedings -- across the board -- continues to 
disappoint many observers.
