SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ 
 
 
¶1. On April 17, center-left "Diario Siete" (circ. 23,000, 4/17) 
carried an editorial entitled, "Military Criticism of Bush." 
Quote: 
 
¶2. "As President Bush's approval ratings continue to drop...seven 
retired generals have harshly criticized his management of the war 
on Iraq....  The generals have raised their voices to express what 
many in the U.S. military feel....  The bottom line is that the U.S. 
has no chance of winning the war in Iraq...because, despite its 
economic and military might, it has been unable to remake that part 
of the world according to Washington's design."
