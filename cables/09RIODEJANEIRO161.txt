Advances and Regressions (on drugs) 
 
On June 25, center-left Rio daily Jornal do Brasil writes, "Brazil 
is the country that consumes the most cocaine in South America, even 
though it is not a large global producer of the drug. This fact was 
included in the UN's global report on drugs that was released 
yesterday. In absolute figures, the Brazilian market leads the 
continent in cocaine consumption, with close to 890,000 users (the 
equivalent of .7% of the population between 12 and 65). A worrying 
increase when compared to 2001, when drug users represented .4% of 
the population. Based on questionnaires filled out by governments, 
the United Nations survey was released simultaneously in various 
cities throughout the world on the eve of the International Day 
Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. 
 
The number of drug seizures increased along with the rise in 
consumption. In the Southern Cone countries (Brasil, Argentina, 
Paraguay, Uruguay, and Chile), seizures went from 10 tons in 2000 to 
38 tons in 2007. According to the National Secretary for Drug 
Policy, Paulo Roberto Uchta, "Brazil doesn't bother the world in 
terms of production. It is a bother because of the drug transit that 
takes place in the country. In 2007, South America contributed with 
45% of the world's total drug apprehensions, the equivalent of 323 
tons. More than 60% of this amount comes from Columbia. 17 tons of 
cocaine were seized in Brazil- which places it 10th in the world 
ranking. 
 
The Secretary emphasized the fact that Brazil shares a border with 
the three largest worldwide producers of cocaine, but avoided 
speaking about failures in vigilance. According to the Federal 
Police, the main objective is not to intercept narcotics, but to 
break up the criminal organizations responsible for the illicit 
trade. According to Uchta, Brazil is fully compliant with 
international commitments regarding the drug trade. 
 
In spite of the official optimism, Brazil is one of the four 
countries with the most users of intravenous drugs (along with 
China, the United States, and Russia, they make up an estimated 45% 
of the world's users). This practice ends up pushing Brazil into 
another sad ranking: that of countries with the highest rate of HIV 
contamination on the planet. According to the report, 48% of those 
infected by AIDS virus in Brazil are users of intravenous drugs. 
Public policies directed towards these groups would be more than 
welcome... 
 
Another dark scenario is laid out [in the report] in relation to 
crack. Seizures in Brazil almost quadrupled from 2006 to 2007, going 
from 145.3 tons to 578 tons. In the time period covered by the 
survey, which starts in 2002, the year with the least seizures of 
crack was 2004, with 101 tons apprehended. Cheap and powerful, the 
drug became a favorite among the less-favored classes, with large 
penetration among youth and children. State support for addicts- 
when it exists- is still far from ideal. 
 
More than just a compilation of numbers and charts, the diagnosis 
laid out that in the 314 pages of the report could serve as a basis 
for governments' public policy towards the fight against drug 
trafficking and the prevention of addiction."
