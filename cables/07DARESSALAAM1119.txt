REF: ORTH (AF/RSA)- JOHNSON (EMB DAR) E-MAIL 07/18/2007 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Ambassador Patrick Mombo, has delivered to the 
Deputy Chief of Mission a formal request for USD 4.25 million 
in financial assistance to support the Tanzanian People's 
Defence Force (TPDF) training of 1,000 Somali officers (see 
para 8 for text of diplomatic note).  The DCM noted that the 
USG had previously received from the Ministry of Defense the 
same equipment and supplies request that was attached as an 
addendum to the diplomatic note, and assured Mombo the list 
had been forwarded to the Department.  In response, the USG 
had set aside USD 1.5 million for training of at least 250 
cadet officers, including uniforms, supplies and some 
vehicles.  However, the DCM stressed we would forward the 
Government of Tanzania's request for USD 4.5 million to 
Washington. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Asked when Tanzania expected to see a list with 
names of trainees, Mombo said that a State House advisor was 
in contact with his Somali counterpart pressuring him to 
provide names for the training.  Whatever support the USG 
could provide to accelerate  provision of the names would be 
welcome.  Mombo added that the TPDF remained confident that 
the list would be forthcoming and had prepared a training 
center, identified the instructors, and designated the 
training staff.  The TPDF's target is to begin the training 
in September 2007, yet were in need of further financial 
support from the international community to fund the 
training.  Mombo reiterated that USD 4.25 million would be 
required over a twelve month period. 
 
Cadets and senior officials to be trained simultaneously 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
¶3. (SBU) Mombo stressed that the training of the cadets and 
the senior officers would take place at the same time, in the 
same camp, with different course content.  In an "Aide 
Memoire" attached to the Diplomatic Note, the GOT noted that 
Tanzania wants to contribute to the AU effort to stabilize 
Somalia, but "in view of the enormous financial outlay 
required" has asked the USG and other members of the 
international community to assist financially in the 
burden-sharing.  The aide-memoire stated that the GOT's 
training of the cadet and senior officers is a "risky 
venture" that does not benefit the Tanzanian society. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Both Permanent Secretary Mombo and Vitus Njiku, Head 
of MFA's African Department Conflict Resolution Office, told 
the DCM and PolCouns informally that the GOT also requested 
assistance from the United Kingdom and the EU to train the 
Somali officers.  However, both the UK and EU missions in Dar 
es Salaam have told us that no formal request was made to the 
missions here.  Post assumes that if the GOT did request 
assistance from other donors, the discussions were on the 
sidelines of London meeting of the International Contact 
Group on Somalia. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Note:  The equipment list Permanent Secretary Mombo 
gave the DCM was the same list received by the DATT from the 
Ministry of Defense in February 2007 at the time of the 
International Contact Group on Somalia meeting in Dar es 
Salaam.  We forwarded this list to the AF Regional Security 
Affairs (AF/RSA) office at that time.  Full text of the 
Diplomatic Note below and the attached aide-memoire and 
equipment list have been forwarded to AF/RSA and can be 
e-mailed on request.  Contact: Skye Justice 
(justicess@state.gov) or Mary Johnson (johnsonmb@state.gov). 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶6. (SBU) The Tanzanian Government is anxious to move forward 
on this training to keep its word to the AU.  While fully 
aware the vetted name lists must first be produced by the 
Somali government, nevertheless, the TPDF has identified a 
training camp in Arusha, trainers and instructors.  Mombo was 
appreciative that the USG is ready to offer support to train 
the first batch of 250 cadets.  However, the TPDF wants to 
train the senior officers and cadets simultaneously and is 
clearly determined to complete training for all 1,000 
officers within 12 months.  Thus, the GOT is requesting USG 
support for the entire package, so that once in motion, there 
 
 
would be no delays or breaks in the training program. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Post recommends that the GOT's request to fully fund 
the Somali officer training be reviewed and considered. 
Tanzania's goal is to train these officers quickly and move 
them back to Somalia and into action.  However, this 
objective is dependent on a confirmed and reliable source of 
funding for the entire 12-month training plan. 
 
Text of Diplomatic Note 
----------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) Begin Diplomatic Note CHC 573/699/01, dated July 30, 
2007: 
 
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation of the United Republic of Tanzania presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America 
and has the honor to communicate the following: 
 
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania made an 
offer to train one thousand soldiers from Somalia at Cadet 
and Senior officers levels in Tanzania, following a request 
from the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union. 
Pursuant to this offer, the Transitional Federal Government 
of Somalia sent a technical team to Dar es Salaam in March 
2007 to discuss and agree on training modalities.  At this 
meeting, the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia 
agreed to submit a list of trainees before training 
commences.  The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania 
is still waiting for the Transitional Federal Government of 
Somalia to send the list of Cadets and Officers it intends to 
train. 
 
For its part, the Government of Tanzania has completed 
preparations of the training site, the identification and the 
training of the instructors, and the actual training is 
scheduled to start in September 2007.  The training period 
will be divided into the following phases: 
 
   ¶1.  At the cadet level, two batches of 250 Cadets each 
       will be trained for six months.  A total of 500 
       Cadets are expected to be trained in one year. 
 
   ¶2.  At the Senior Officers level, four batches composed 
       of 125 officers each will be trained for three 
       months per batch. It is expected that a total of 
       500 Senior Officers will be trained in four batches 
       in one year. 
 
As will be gauged from the enclosed attachment, the 
Government of the United Republic of Tanzania estimates that 
the financial resources required for the completion of this 
exercise amount to Tanzania Shillings 5,419,560 or 
approximately USD 4,250,000 over a twelve month period. 
 
This is an extremely burdensome load for the Tanzanian 
Government.  In the spirit of international solidarity and 
burden sharing, the Government of the United Republic of 
Tanzania has decided to approach the Government of the United 
States of America for financial assistance to enable Tanzania 
to meet this commitment. 
 
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania believes 
that the issue of peace in Somalia is an international 
responsibility.  While it is ready to play is part, the 
Government of the United Republic of Tanzania hopes that it 
would be able to count on the Government of the United States 
of America to give favorable consideration to this request. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation 
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of 
the United States of America the assurances of its highest 
consideration."  END TEXT
