¶1.  (SBU) On June 15, all Omani English and Arabic daily papers 
carried an official news agency (Oman News Agency) article stating 
that H.M. Sultan Qaboos congratulates Ahmadinejad on his re-election. 
 News of the Sultan's cable of congratulations appeared front page 
above the fold, standard placement for all his official messages. 
The acknowledgement of Ahmadinejad's win comes quickly after 
Ayatollah Khamenei's endorsement of the election results. The full 
text of the ONA article follows. 
 
¶2.  (U) Begin text: His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said has sent a 
cable of congratulations to Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, on his re-election for another presidential 
term.  His Majesty expressed sincere congratulations and best wishes 
to President Ahmedinejad in leading the Iranian friendly people 
towards further progress, prosperity and welfare.  His Majesty also 
affirmed the keenness to cement the existing strong relations between 
the two countries, as well as enhance cooperation in various fields 
in a way that serves the interest of Omani and Iranian friendly 
people.  End text.
