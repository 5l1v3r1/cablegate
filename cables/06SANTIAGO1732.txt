SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - VENEZUELA'S UNSC CANDIDACY 
 
 
On August 11, conservative, afternoon daily "La Segunda" (circ 
31,834) ran a column by former Chilean Foreign Affairs Minister 
Ignacio Walker entitled, "Chavez and the United Nations." Block 
quote follows: 
 
"Does it help our national interests to support a country that will 
spend two years on the Security Council ...that denounces 
imperialism (the United States) and has allies such as Byelorussia, 
Iran, Cuba, and North Korea?  Will Venezuela create a more complex 
and divided environment worldwide than the one we already have?.... 
Based on the answer to these questions and concerns, most European 
countries, almost all of Central America, Mexico, and Australia, 
among others, have already announced they will not vote for 
Venezuela.   And although for Chile this is a no-win situation, even 
if it chooses to abstain, the above questions are inevitable when it 
comes time to make a decision on how to vote."
