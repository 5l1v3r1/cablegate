¶1.  (SBU) PolCouns raised reftel request for Moroccan 
participation in the OSCE Tel Aviv Seminar with Directors 
General for Bilateral Affairs Yussef Amrani and for 
International Organizations Mohammed Azeroual (P-level) on 
December 13 and 14, stressing its importance to the 
partnership.  Amrani confirmed that Morocco places great 
importance on its participation in the OSCE, noting that 
there was an OSCE-sponsored seminar on migration in Rabat 
that very week (with USG/CSCE attendance), in which he 
participated.  There was also an Israeli delegation at the 
seminar, which Amrani met. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On December 18, Amrani regretted that Morocco would 
not be able to attend the Tel Aviv meeting, for reasons of 
agenda, not substance.  Moreover the seminar's topic was not 
of such critical importance as to require an official 
presence.  He thought some Moroccan NGO's might be 
participating.  Amrani underscored Morocco's openness to 
Israel.  He had seen a senior Israeli MFA official in his 
office earlier in the year, and the Minister had met FM Livni 
in Paris.  Morocco is open about its relationship and its 
strong support for the peace process, as noted in Annapolis. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post became aware of the seminar and its invitation 
to Morocco on receipt of reftel.  Given the importance the 
GOM attaches to partnership activities, we would appreciate 
being kept better informed.  Timely notice may enable us to 
be more persuasive with the GOM.
