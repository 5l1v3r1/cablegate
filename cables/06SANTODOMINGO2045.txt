¶1. Embassy on June 14 delivered text of points Ref A (minus 
the if-asked points) through the American Red Cross Caribbean 
representative here to the director general of the Dominican 
Red Cross, Arq. Gustavo Lara Tapia.  Lara said he was 
forwarding the points to Dominican Red Cross president Ligia 
Leroux and other members of the delegation, currently 
traveling in Spain prior to arrival in Geneva.  He said she 
and others in the delegation would meet with the Dominican 
Government delegate in Geneva to coordinate the country's 
position. 
 
2,  Also on June 14, Embassy delivered Ref A points by fax to 
Dominican vice foreign minister Alejandra Liriano and MFA UN 
director Michelle Cohen, with a request that the MFA instruct 
its delegate in Geneva.  Embassy sent a similar request with 
points Ref B on June 19. 
 
¶3. On June 19, an official of the Dominican Red Cross 
forwarded a message from the Dominican delegation, which had 
arrived in Geneva June 18.  The Dominicans had already 
coordinated with other delegates; the Dominicans and other 
Latin Americans were prepared to support amending the 
statutes of the Movement.  Political officer raised our 
concern of opposition by a few nations.  The Dominicans were 
aware of this opposition -- for example, from Iran -- but 
firm in their resolve to move ahead with the conference. 
 
¶4. Vice Foreign Minister Alejandra Liriano told political 
officer June 19 that she would consult with MFA Legal Adviser 
Miguel Pichardo -- the official Dominican delegate in Geneva 
-- and issue him instructions.  Political officer explained 
our concerns.  She declined to confirm the Dominican position 
pending the consultations.  Embassy will report any further 
substantive response.
