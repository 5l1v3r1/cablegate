REF: E. KONICK 1/16 EMAIL 
 
¶1. (SBU) European Correspondent Albin Otruba accepted USG points 
for the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on January 21 and 
expressed appreciation that the U.S. and EU are so close on the 
major issues. 
 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
------------------ 
¶2. (SBU) The single item on which Otruba saw a gap between 
Slovak and U.S. policy is the relationship of the Office of the 
High Representative (OHR) and the EU Special Representative 
(EUSR) offices in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Otruba said the EU member 
states are unanimously in favor of rolling the OHR into EUSR, 
since an independent OHR is an obstacle to Bosnia's EU 
integration. The question for EU member states "is not if this 
should happen, but when. And Slovakia is in favor of it 
happening as soon as possible." 
 
Afghanistan 
----------- 
¶3. (SBU) Otruba described Afghanistan's 2009 Presidential 
election as a "fiasco" and "ineffective." He couldn't imagine 
any EU member state or ISAF contributor being opposed to a delay 
in the Parliamentary elections, but said the Afghan government 
must propose, own and defend any proposal for delay. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Foreign Minister Lajcak will lead Slovakia's delegation 
to the London Conference. Otruba said the MoD State Secretary, 
Daniel Duchon, is still considering participating as well. 
 
Ukraine 
---------- 
¶5. (U) Ukraine will not be discussed at the January FAC. A 
conversation on Haiti has been scheduled instead.
