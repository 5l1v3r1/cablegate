¶2.    (SBU) IDF shelling in the vicinity of Khan Younis on 
August 22 killed three PIJ members, while injuring another 
seven Palestinians.  One IDF soldier sustained light wounds 
in northern Gaza when an anti-tank rocket struck an IDF 
outpost.  The PFLP and the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades claimed 
responsibility for the attack.  An Israeli operation into the 
Shijayah neighborhood in Gaza City overnight August 22-23 
resulted in the arrest of five Hamas members and the 
confiscation of ammunition, pistols, machine guns, and hand 
grenades.  One IDF soldier and three Palestinian gunmen were 
injured in the exchange of gunfire.  Palestinian militants 
overnight fired one Qassam rocket from northern Gaza toward 
the Western Negev, resulting in no injuries or property 
damage.  The IDF August 22-23 arrested 11 Palestinians in 
several localities in the West Bank. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) Israeli security forces issued a high alert 
August 23 for a possible suicide bomb attack in Jerusalem. 
The IDF and Israeli police set up flying checkpoints on main 
roads and arteries heading into Jerusalem, snarling traffic 
for the morning rush hours.  Yesha Council spokeswoman Emily 
Amrusi told ConGen Poloff that the IDF had instructed 
settlers located in settlements between Ramallah and 
Jerusalem to remain off the roads past 0800L to allow the IDF 
to check Palestinian vehicles.  The security forces canceled 
the alert during the hours of 0930-1200L, but resumed the
