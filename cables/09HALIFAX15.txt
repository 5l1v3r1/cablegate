SUBJECT: FILMMAKING IN NOVA SCOTIA 
 
¶1. Summary: The issue of intellectual property rights (IPR) does 
not rank high on the agenda of the Nova Scotia film industry. 
Rather, the key issue is attracting increased film production to 
the province. Film Nova Scotia is the provincially owned 
development corporation through which the province has been 
assisting and encouraging the development of a local filmmaking 
industry for almost twenty years. Successive provincial 
governments have seen this assistance--mainly in the form of tax 
credits and small production grants--as an economic development 
tool akin to those for any other industry. While these efforts 
have produced some positive results, Nova Scotia lags far behind 
the established Canadian film centers in Montreal, Toronto, and 
Vancouver. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. Consul General and Pol-Econ Specialist met with Anne 
MacKenzie, President and CEO of Film Nova Scotia on April 7 to 
discuss IPR issues concerning copyright legislation and the 
local film industry. On the former, MacKenzie noted that the 
issue was not a high priority and offered no opinion on the 
likelihood of the Harper government actually passing copyright 
legislation other than a brief comment that any development in 
this area would likely take a long time. 
 
¶3. MacKenzie then described the mandate of Film Nova Scotia, 
explaining that it was set up in 1990 as an economic development 
tool. Its mandate is to grow Nova Scotia's film, television and 
new media (CD, DVDs and internet) industry and also to promote 
the province and its worker force in global production markets. 
Through direct assistance the corporation annually invests in 
the range of C$15-20 million in programs for such things as 
training and loans and grants for would-be filmmakers. 
 
¶4. In addition to this assistance, the province offers a film 
tax credit that Film Nova Scotia administers on behalf of the 
provincial finance department. This provides for a fully 
refundable corporate income tax credit based on labor costs. The 
credit is designed to encourage the development, training and 
hiring of Nova Scotia film workers (which amounts to some 2,000 
to 3,000 individuals). The tax credit currently ranges from 50 
to 65 percent, with the higher percentage going to films shot 
outside the Halifax region.  In the province's 2007-2008 fiscal 
year, local producers received C$8.10 million in credits while 
visiting (i.e., non-resident) producers received C$2.64 million. 
MacKenzie pointed out that the various incentives have helped 
grow the industry to where it is now the fourth largest in 
Canada, coming in behind Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. In 
its 2006/07 fiscal year, the industry saw over C$100 million in 
production spending in the province, but that figure dipped to 
C$76 million in 2007/08 due to increases in the value of the 
Canadian dollar, labor unrest in the industry and increasing 
competiveness among other jurisdictions. 
 
¶5. COMMENT: While Film Nova Scotia has succeeded in carving out 
for local production companies a small niche in the Canadian and 
global film industry, the prospects of displacing Canada's 
traditional production centers remain remote. END COMMENT.
