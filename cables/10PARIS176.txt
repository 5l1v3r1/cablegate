AVRAM ALBERTO BUENO - CASE NO. K-2277 
 
REF: STATE 099505 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff contacted Avram Alberto Bueno, CEO and General 
Manager of of the French company Business Developmental Security 
Industries (BDSI) regarding BDSI's bona fides and registered broker 
activities under Case NO. K-2277 (ref). Bueno said the company 
consisted of himself and his wife Sophie Verbauwhede, Operations 
Manager. Bueno and his wife established BDSI in 2005 and have been 
operating in Brezolles, France since 2006 after moving their 
operations from Paris to Brezolles due to cost concerns. BDSI is a 
small two person outfit located in a 15th century farmhouse in rural 
France. Bueno and his wife decided to incorporate BDSI, after having 
been involved in the aerospace and air defense industry for decades 
in the United States. Bueno owned and operated three small companies 
in California during the 1980s and 90s and eventually sold them to 
L3. Bueno said they want to keep their business small for overhead 
and tax purposes and do not want to grow beyond their current 
structure. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bueno described BDSI as a representative and facilitator for 
small and large U.S. and France-based companies involved in the 
aerospace and air defense industry. Bueno said that BDSI is a conduit 
for introducing French and U.S. companies to each other. BDSI fosters 
business relationships between French and U.S. companies where 
eventual business transactions with USML items are conducted, and 
takes commissions from the resulting sales. 
 
¶3. (SBU) BDSI primarily brokers controlled product sales consisting 
of accelerometers, receivers, antennas, and transmitters. BDSI's U.S. 
suppliers of USML items usually include Herley Industries, 
Haigh-Farr, Honeywell and L3 and French customers include Airbus, 
EADS, MBDA, Eurocopter, Thales, Dassault, and the Delegation Generale 
pour L'Armement (DGA) of the French Ministry of Defense (MOD). 
According to Bueno, BDSI will sometimes broker transactions with 
other companies in the European Union or NATO, like Spain and 
Germany, but the majority of their transactions are for French 
companies in France. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Bueno said he understands the restrictions on USML items and 
the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export of 
USML items from his business days in California. Bueno indicated that 
he was aware that the physical infrastructure of his location is not 
authorized to handle or store USML items and that he can't physically 
store items on the premises. Bueno said BDSI is simply a broker, does 
not store products on premises, and the company has no tangible 
influence or interest on the development of the potential end 
product, the installation of the USML item purchased, modification of 
products, or the physical transfer of the USML items.  All 
transactions, according to Bueno, originate with a French/U.S. 
company and get shipped directly to the buyer and end-user. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post Blue Lantern Action Officer concludes that BDSI is an 
active business operating at the location indicated under its 
authorization address (per ref information). CEO Avram Albert Bueno 
says he understands the laws and regulations regarding handling and 
selling USML items.  Embassy uncovered no evidence or derogatory 
information that would suggest that BDSI has dealt or currently deals 
with disreputable businesses regarding USML import/export items. 
Bueno stated he avoids those companies or business transactions that 
might engage in such activity.
