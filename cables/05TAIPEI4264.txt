SUBJECT: AVIAN INFLUENZA SMUGGLED INTO TAIWAN FROM CHINA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) AIT received news late on October 20 from the 
Taiwan Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and 
Quarantine under the Council of Agricultural (COA) that of 
the 1500 birds being smuggled from China on a 
Panamanian-flagged vessel that were seized by Taiwan Coast 
Guard on October 14, all 46 birds in the sample tested for 
avian flu tested positive with H5N1 avian flu virus.  (COA 
routinely tests smuggled and imported birds for disease. 
This was the first time avian flu virus has been detected.) 
The test was done by the COA Animal Health Research Institute 
using the "RT-PCR" testing method.  The results did not 
become available until late on October 20.  COA has held a 
press conference to express gratitude to the Coast Guard for 
making the seizure.  The Coast Guard and the Taiwan CDC 
together destroyed and burnt the birds on October 15, and the 
area was disinfected.  All workers involved in the seizure 
and destruction of the birds are being monitored.  COA will 
continue testing all birds imported into Taiwan.  During the 
press conference COA urged public caution about contact with 
birds. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: This test result refutes China's denial of 
an ongoing avian flu problem.  The fact that smuggling from 
China to Taiwan is commonplace, and usually not intercepted 
by the Coast Guard, means there is a chance the disease is 
also present in Taiwan.
