¶1. U.S. POLICY 
 
Quote: 
 
"There is strength in Obama's soft-style diplomacy" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(05/04): "It's time 
to make some conclusions concerning Obama's diplomacy during his 
first 100 days.  Obama advocates "smart power diplomacy."  However, 
soft power is a more accurate term to describe his diplomacy. 
Subtleness is not the main characteristic of his diplomacy, instead 
it is soft power. Obama has made friendly gestures toward both 
allied and enemy countries.  Some have criticized him, stating that 
his diplomacy lacks principle. In fact, his soft power diplomacy is 
not the whole picture.  The U.S. has learned to "seek common ground 
while accepting existing divergences" on the Iran, China, and Russia 
issues.  In fact the Obama administration never forgets to bring 
requests to other countries. For example, the U.S. requested more 
coordination from Iran on the Afghanistan issue." 
 
¶2. A(H1N1) 
 
"Mexico should not complain about China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(05/04): "The WHO has prepared to upgrade the 
threat level to 6. The Mexican Foreign Minister has given an 
improper speech about China.  He said this because China isolated 
all the Mexican citizens who took a flight to China from Mexico that 
included one person who has a confirmed case of the flu.  The 
Mexican Foreign Minister has suggested that Mexican citizens should 
not travel to China.  Chinese experts maintain that isolation is a 
normal measure taken to prevent the spread of a virus and not a 
prejudicial act against Mexicans.  Mexico has forgotten that China 
is the first country, after the epidemic broke out, to send 
resources and assistance to Mexico.  80% of the Chinese netizens 
oppose the Mexican Foreign Minister's speech.  The U.S., Japan and 
several European countries have taken strict isolation measures as 
well but they are not receiving criticism.  Because China has a 
large and very mobile population, China should not relax its 
vigilance against the A(H1N1) virus.  The Chinese and the Mexicans 
obviously have different opinions on the influence of the disease. 
Because of the SARS experience during 2003, China has already had to 
work out the most effective prevention measures." 
 
¶3. U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
 
"U.S.-China economies are closely linked, they will play a duet" 
 
Economic Observer (Jingji Guanchabao), a weekly insightful economic 
newspaper (05/04): "The key to the U.S. and Chinese economies 
retaining their balance is that their currency must be changed. 
This doesn't mean that the U.S. dollar will deteriorate; the result 
is actually the opposite.  When the RMB joins the global economy, 
the future relationship between the U.S. dollar and the RMB will be 
more intimately connected.  This subtle change will promote the 
economy of China and the U.S., it will help them retain their 
balance and further promote the global economy.  The most important 
component in this balance is the attitude of the E.U., Japan, India 
and many other countries.  Are they willing to listen to this 
duet?" 
 
¶4. CHINA-JAPAN RELATIONS 
 
"Sino-Japan ties must step out of U.S. shadow" 
 
Global Times English (English-language daily published by the 
People's Daily)(05/04): "For too long, the U.S.' 'divide and rule' 
tactics in East Asia succeeded in widening the distance between 
China and Japan.  Both China and Japan should be aware of the agenda 
of the U.S. in East Asia and seek to prevent China-Japan relations 
from being obstructed by the U.S.  As the global financial crisis 
undermines the attraction of the Western model, many people turn 
their eyes to the East."
