¶B. STATE 163955 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On December 10 French Ambassador Bonneville 
informed Ambassador that Brunei had accepted his 
government's invitation to the Paris Donors Conference in 
support of Palestinian reform and capacity building.  The 
Bruneian delegation will be headed by Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade II Pehin Lim Jock Seng. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Bonneville expressed appreciation for the USG 
having encouraged the Government of Brunei to accept the 
French invitation.  He said that he had heard the GOB 
might prefer to donate to a World Bank trust fund rather 
than directly to the Palestinian Authority, for reasons 
noted in para 3 of ref A.
