SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #14 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
February 24, 2010. Please visit the following link for additional 
classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency U.S. Government (USG) Joint Operations Center 
can be contacted on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U//FOUO//LES) Canadian and USG authorities are currently 
unaware of any specific, credible threats to the Games. Though the 
frequency of organized demonstrations has diminished since February 
15, ad hoc protest activity at event and public locations remains a 
concern. Canadian security officials indicate anti-Olympics groups 
may stage limited demonstrations as the Games draw to a close. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) February 23 Protest Activity - No Olympics-related protests 
occurred February 23. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U) Current Protest Activity - Activists plan to stage a "Share 
the Gold" human chain protest in the Downtown East Side from 4:45 
to 5:15 p.m. today. Demonstrators hope to form a chain of 
individuals for three blocks along either side of East Hastings 
 
Street, between Carrall Street and Gore Avenue.  The demonstration 
will likely be peaceful, but minor traffic disruptions may occur. 
The protest is approximately .5 miles from Canada Hockey Place, the 
nearest Olympic venue. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U//FOUO//LES) Anticipated Protest Activity - An anti-Olympics 
demonstration at Grandview Park and subsequent march to the nearby 
Britannia Community Services Centre Rink is scheduled from 3:30 to 
6:30 p.m. February 25. A small number of activists will reportedly 
protest the use of the rink for Olympics practice, though it will 
not likely affect those scheduled.  This demonstration is being 
touted on the militant activist website   
www.no2010.com; however, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and 
Vancouver Police are monitoring the situation and have sufficient 
security measures in place. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (U) Bicyclists and skaters plan to participate in a "Critical 
Mass Bike Ride" departing from the Vancouver Art Gallery around 6 
p.m. on February 26. This recurring event is taking place as 
regularly scheduled and is not anti-Olympics in nature; however, 
the route is unknown and could affect the Men's Hockey Semi-Final 
game at 6:30 p.m. at Canada Hockey Place. Minor traffic disruptions 
are expected. 
 
 
 
¶7.  (U) A "Games Over! Resistance Lives!" demonstration is 
scheduled to occur from 1 to 3pm PST on February 28 at the 
intersection of Smithe and Cambie Streets. The event is advertised 
as a "noisy public festival to celebrate our communities and our 
resistance."  This demonstration is being advertised on 
www.no2010.com. 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶8.  (U)  No Olympics-related security incidents occurred during 
this reporting period.

Olympics-related security operations have transpired during this 
reporting period.

Napolitano, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, 
and US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice will visit Vancouver from

finals and the closing ceremonies.
