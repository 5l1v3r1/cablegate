Econoff delivered reftel points on August 1 to Concepcion 
Martinez Lope, GOS Subdirector General of Climate Change, who 
will review them with Alicia Montalvo Santamaria, Director 
General of Climate Change in the Ministry of Environment, 
Rural Development and Marine Affairs.  Post has not yet 
received a formal response from the Director General or the 
GOS regarding support for the U.S. candidate.  Although the 
Subdirector General is seeking to clarify the Spanish 
position with the Director General, the ministry has 
officially closed for vacation as of 14:30 on August 1. 
Therefore, we may not receive additional information or a 
formal expression of support for the USG candidate until the 
ministry reopens in late August.  Post will forward the GOS' 
formal response once received.  The GOS Subdirector General 
requested USG support for a Spanish candidate seeking 
membership in the same IPCC group, Working Group II.  Post 
has provided the name and details of the Spanish candidate, 
Professor Jose Manuel Moreno, to OES/EGC.
