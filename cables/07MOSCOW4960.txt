REFTEL: USDOC 08143 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, (A) 
and (B) Kalibr 2001, Vidnoe City, Moscow, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application (A) 
D382424 and (B) D382425 as the ultimate consignee of 
(A) Bushnell yardage pro 4-12X42 rangefinder and (B) 
Bushnell yardage pro 4-12X42 rangefinder and 12g 
shotguns 28 inches semi-auto. These items are 
controlled for foreign policy and crime control 
reasons under ECCN OA987. The licensee is RSR group, 
Inc., 20 Cedarfield Commons, Rochester, NY 14612. 
 
¶3. On September 18, 2007, Export Control Attaches 
Donald Pearce, Peter Liston and FSN Natalya Shipitsina 
conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of Inter Hunt Ltd. 17/2, Bakhrushina st., 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with 
Aleksander Krasovsky, Director-General, Alexander 
Bobovich, Commercial Director, and Kirill Ukraintsev, 
International Relations Manager. 
 
¶4. Inter Hunt Ltd. (IHL) was founded in 2004 as a 
distributor and retailer of hunting supplies and 
clothing.  Kalibr 2001, the retail shop referenced in 
the license application, is owned and operated by IHL. 
IHL originally brokered several deals for high-end 
shotguns for clients, and decided in 2006 to obtain a 
permit to sell firearms.  Currently IHL is a 
distributor for Verney Carron, a manufacturer of high- 
end hunting shotguns and rifles in France.  IHL would 
like to add to that line similar rifles and shotguns 
from U.S. manufacturers.  Most IHL clients spend 
approximately 25000 - 26000 Roubles (1000 USD) per 
gun.  IHL is in the process of opening a second store 
located closer to the city center.  IHL is hoping to 
become an exclusive dealer for rifles and shotguns 
from U.S. manufacturer Smith and Wesson.  The company 
currently employs 12, and will hire an additional 10- 
12 to run the new store. 
 
¶5. The fifteen shotguns referenced in reftel will be 
utilized for fire testing and certification for sale 
by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russian acronym 
MVD), and thereafter will be sold.  Under Russian 
firearms laws, a company may only import three of a 
particular model of rifle or shotgun prior to 
certification.  The fifteen shotguns covered by this 
license will be three each of the following:  Mossberg 
Model 935 12ga. 28in. Autoloader type 82035, Mossberg 
930 12ga. 28in. Autoloader all-purpose type 85110, 
Mossberg 930 12ga. 28in. Autoloader blued type 85115, 
Mossberg 930 camouflage type 85210, Smith and Wesson 
Model 1012 12ga. 28in. semiautomatic type 822300. 
Upon type acceptance by MVD, IHL plans to import 
larger quantities as demand requires.  The laser 
rangefinder riflescopes in reftel will be sold to 
ultimate end users in Russia for hunting and sporting 
use. 
 
¶6. Russian firearms laws require gun shops to build 
walk-in safe like facilites for the storage of 
firearms and ammunition.  Both IHL retail stores meet 
or exceed the requirements, including hardened doors, 
electronic surveillance and security systems, and 
direct 24 hour monitoring of security alarms by MVD 
Militsia.  Russian citizens are permitted to purchase 
a total of five rifles and/or five shotguns. 
 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Kalibr 2001, 
Vidnoe city, Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is requested 
that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
