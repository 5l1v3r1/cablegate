¶2.  (U)  Background:  On February 27, the President appointed 
Mr. Sada Cumber to be his Envoy to the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference (OIC).  While the U.S. is not a member of 
the OIC, we do want to increase our engagement with this 
influential organization.  Mr. Cumber was invited to the 11th 
OIC Summit in Dakar by the OIC Secretary General.  He will 
lead a delegation to the 11th OIC Summit in Dakar where he 
would like to meet with delegations to discuss issues of 
mutual interest.  He is particularly interested in meeting 
with the following delegations: 
 
--  Saudi Arabia 
--  Malaysia 
--  Turkey 
--  Pakistan 
--  Nigeria 
--  Azerbaijan 
--  Egypt 
--  Indonesia

--  Bahrain 
--  Kuwait 
--  Burkina Faso 
--  Sierra Leone 
 
¶3.  (U)  Department hopes that many of these meetings will be 
set up in advance of the Summit and seeks posts' assistance 
in arranging these meetings.  Therefore, Department requests 
that posts reach out to the host governments to find a point 
of contact (preferably English, French, or Arabic speaking) 
for their delegations traveling to Dakar, as well as contact 
information.  In order to ease communication at the Summit, 
Department requests that posts share USDEL point of contact 
Ambassador Christopher Ross' phone number 447-89-439-6616 
with host governments; additionally, Special Envoy Cumber's 
phone number, (202) 316-1942(this is an international cell 
phone). 
 
¶4.  (U)  Department also requests posts provide a short 
paragraph of background on host countries' involvement in the 
OIC, as well as any specific areas of collaboration with the 
OIC or possible future collaboration with the U.S. Special 
Envoy.  (Note:  Some posts have already provided this 
information, which does not need to be resubmitted.  End 
note). 
 
¶5.  (U)  For Embassies Cairo and Kampala:  According to OIC 
records the GOE and GOU have not yet confirmed attendance at 
the Summit.  Posts may wish to note this, in the course of 
seeking the information requested in paragraph three. 
 
¶6.  (U)  For ConGen Jeddah:  Following up on the Envoy's 
meeting in Jeddah with the OIC Secretary General, please 
share this list of proposed meetings with the OIC, as well as 
USDEL's contact information in para 4 above.  Please note 
that USDEL would appreciate any assistance that the OIC 
Secretariat could offer in facilitating these meetings.
