U.S. Satellite Destruction Closely Watched 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. During the February 21 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Liu Jianchao responded to a question about the successful 
destruction of an errant U.S. satellite saying that China was 
closely following the "possible harm caused by the U.S. action to 
outer space security and relevant countries."  Liu added that China 
requested that the United States fulfill its obligations in "real 
earnest" and provide data so that relevant countries might take 
precautions. 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶3. Liu confirmed that China recently had an "exchange of views" with 
Assistant Secretary Hill and DPRK VFM Kim Kye-Gwan.  Liu said all 
parties recognize that the Six-Party Talks has resulted in positive 
progress.  Liu admitted that there have been some "difficulties" 
recently but said that "all parties have the political will" to 
honor their commitments.  China is ready to continue to promote the 
denuclearization process and realize the goals of the joint 
statement. 
 
¶4. China, ROK and DPRK will hold an economic and energy working 
group on February 21 in Beijing.  This "association within the 
Six-Party Talks" will discuss the coordination of economic support 
to the DPRK. 
 
China in Africa 
--------------- 
 
¶5. Responding to a question regarding President Bush's comments 
concerning China's activities in Africa, Liu said that he could not 
comment on United States-Africa policy.  China's policy, Liu said, 
is responsible and conducive to Africa's development.  Liu said that 
the cooperation between China and Africa was "widely applauded by 
the African people" during the meeting between President Bush and 
the President of Ghana. 
 
Eighth China-Japan Strategic Dialogue 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Liu confirmed that the Eighth China-Japan Strategic Dialogue will 
take place from February 22-23 in Beijing.  The Chinese delegation 
will be led by VFM Wang Yi.  The two parties will "exchange views on 
how to increase cooperation" and will discuss the dumpling issue "if 
necessary."  Liu also said that it was irresponsible and 
unscientific for Japanese authorities to make judgments on the 
dumpling issue at this stage in the investigation. 
 
Secretary Rice Visit Announced 
 
SIPDIS 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7. Liu announced that Secretary Rice will visit China from February 
26-27. China hopes that the two sides can "exchange views in an 
in-depth way on issues of mutual interest" and implement the 
consensus reached by the two leaders.  Liu also said that China 
hopes to promote the development of the United States-China 
strategic cooperative partnership. 
 
Huawei Deal Rejection 
--------------------- 
 
¶8. When asked whether the recent ruling against the Huawei bid to 
purchase 3Com caused China to worry about protectionist practices, 
Liu responded that Huawei was a capable manufacturer of 
telecommunication technology and that China hoped U.S. authorities 
would act according to the law to ensure a fair environment.

¶9. Liu said in response to a question about Olympic related pledges 
to protect human rights that China began working to expand civil and 
political rights before the founding of the PRC and would continue 
its efforts after the Olympics.  Responding to a question about 
claims that China should do more to protect the Tibetan language, 
Liu said that the local government and schools in Tibet used 
Tibetan.  Such claims will not deceive those with an understanding 
of the region, he added.  Liu did not know whether Vatican 
representatives would attend the Olympics, but noted that China and 
the Vatican are in contact "toward the improvement of relations." 
Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua will visit China from February 
27-March 1.
