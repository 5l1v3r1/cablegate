SUBJECT: AU CHAIRMANSHIP DEMARCHE DELIVERED TO MADAGASCAR 
AND THE COMOROS 
 
REF: STATE 8022 
 
¶1.  (U) Madagascar:  Madagascar's Foreign Minister Marcel 
Ranjeva had already departed the country when reftel demarche 
was received.  After repeated attempts to reach him abroad, 
Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to Acting Secretary 
General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) who promised 
to convey our concerns to the Foreign Minister in Addis 
Ababa.  Due to the recent change in cabinet members of the 
Government of Madagascar (GOM), the Acting SecGen was the 
most senior GOM official available.  In addition, Ambassador 
will continue to try to reach Minister Ranjeva personally by 
telephone throughout the weekend. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comoros:  Pol/Econ Chief delivered talking points 
to Ambassador Hodhauer Inzouddine, Secretary General of the 
Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of the Comoros 
(GOC) who accepted the message but noted the GOC is 
preoccupied by the ongoing African Union mission in Comoros 
to settle the inter-island dispute.  He insinuated Comoros 
would likely follow South Africa,s lead, given their 
neighbor to the south had invested so much in the 2006 
Comoros Presidential election. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will report septel if any further substantive 
information is received.
