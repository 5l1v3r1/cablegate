SUBJECT: PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO ARLINGTON NATIONAL 
CEMETERY ANGERS SOME IRAQIS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Prime Minister Maliki's July 21-25 visit to the 
United States generally received factual and neutral coverage 
in the local press.  Iraqi media stories focused on the 
implementation of the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement 
(SFA) in addition to Maliki's meetings with U.S. and UN 
officials regarding Iraq's Chapter VII status.  Most 
political parties were mired in the rush of parliamentary 
activity in the final week before summer recess, as well as 
Kurdistan regional elections, and reserved judgment on the 
visit.  Echoing the sentiments of several contacts, MP Haider 
al-Suwaidi (Shi'a independent) told poloffs on July 26 that 
he was pleased to see the Prime Minister and U.S. officials 
promote "normalization of Relations."  He suspected that most 
Iraqis appreciated the discussion of expanded bilateral trade 
and economic assistance. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Prime Minister's visit to Arlington National 
Cemetery on July 23 to pay tribute to fallen U.S. service 
members was heavily criticized by the Sadr Trend and 
Sadr-affiliated clerics; the Tawafuq bloc leader also weighed 
in against the gesture.  On July 26, Sadrist MP Maha al-Douri 
bitterly condemned the visit in an interview with Iraqi 
media, characterizing it as an attempt by Maliki "to silence 
anti-occupation voices in Iraq."  Al-Douri accused the PM of 
dishonoring Iraq by visiting "the graves of those who killed 
and raped innocent civilians."  Imam Diya al-Shawki denounced 
the Arlington visit during his sermon on July 24 and called 
on Maliki to pay respect to the graves of "innocent Iraqis 
and members of the resistance" instead of U.S. military 
cemeteries.  MP Dhafer al-Ani, the new bloc leader of the 
(Sunni) Tawafuq coalition, accused Maliki of political 
posturing during his trip to the U.S. and criticized him for 
visiting the graves of "occupation soldiers," claiming that 
it was "an act that caused discontent 
and alarm amongst the Iraqi people."  (Note:  It is unclear 
if al-Ani was speaking for the bloc or for himself, since the 
official Tawafuq spokesperson is Selim al Jebori.  End Note.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As political leaders wrangle to form new coalitions 
and party lists for parliamentary elections in January 2010, 
most are trying to characterize themselves as anti-sectarian 
nationalists.  Tawafuq and the Sadr Trend may be speaking out 
on the Arlington visit to portray Maliki as being out of 
touch with the Iraqi public and to cast doubt on his 
nationalist credentials.  While there hasn't been widespread 
condemnation of the Arlington visit, neither has there been a 
strong show of support.  In the prelude to campaign season, 
it is unlikely that political leaders would want to back the 
PM's gesture publicly.
