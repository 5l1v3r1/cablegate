SUBJECT: LEBANON: SECURITY COUNCIL WELCOMES DOHA AGREEMENT 
 
¶1. (SBU)  The UN Security Council adopted a Presidential 
Statement (PRST) on May 22 welcoming the agreement between 
Lebanese leaders reached in Doha, Qatar one day earlier.  The 
text of the PRST is contained in paragraph 2.  Although USUN 
pushed hard for language calling for full implementation of 
the Doha agreement in conformity with UNSC resolutions 1559, 
1680, and 1701, Russia, China, Libya, and South Africa argued 
that a "selective" reference to "controversial" resolutions 
would undermine the Doha process, and was therefore 
unnecessary.  (They were supported in this view by the Qatari 
PermRep.)  USUN noted that UN member states are bound by the 
Charter to support all resolutions, whether or not they are 
controversial, and that 1559, 1680, and 1701 all address the 
same issues as Doha -- the restoration of Lebanon's political 
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and unity. 
Enumerating them in this PRST is no different than specifying 
resolutions 242, 338, and 1515 in UNSC statements on the 
Israeli-Palestinian issue.  Russia and the others refused to 
relent, and with the French and British, who initially 
supported the U.S. position, ready to concede the point, the 
PRST was adopted with a reference to "all relevant 
resolutions" on Lebanon.  The British PermRep, however, 
agreed to Amb Wolff's suggestion that he mention the three 
resolutions to the press when briefing them on the PRST. 
 
¶2.  Begin text of the Presidential Statement (PRST): 
 
The Security Council congratulates the leaders and people of 
Lebanon and welcomes and strongly supports the agreement 
reached in Doha on May 21 under the auspices of the Arab 
League, which constitutes an essential step towards the 
resolution of the current crisis, the return to the normal 
functioning of Lebanese democratic institutions, and the 
complete restoration of Lebanon's unity and stability. 
 
It commends the efforts of the Arab League, in particular of 
the committee of Foreign Ministers, under the leadership of 
the Emir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa 
Al-Thani, Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh 
Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al-Thani, and Secretary-General 
Amr Moussa, in helping Lebanese leaders reach an agreement. 
 
It welcomes the agreement to elect a President of the 
Republic, to establish a national unity cabinet and to 
address Lebanon's electoral law, in accordance with the Arab 
League initiative, as well as the decision to continue the 
national dialogue on ways to reinforce the authority of the 
state over all its territory, in such a way to guarantee the 
sovereignty and the safety of the state and the people of 
Lebanon.  It welcomes the agreement to ban the use of weapons 
and violence as a means to settle disputes, irrespective of 
their nature and under any circumstances. 
 
It calls for the implementation of this agreement in its 
entirety, in accordance with the Arab League initiative, and 
in conformity with the Taef Agreement and all relevant UN 
Security Council resolutions and statements of its President 
on the situation in Lebanon. 
 
The Security Council reaffirms its strong support for the 
territorial integrity, sovereignty, unity, and political 
independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized 
borders and under the sole and exclusive authority of the 
Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory.
