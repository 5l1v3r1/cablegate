of GOL officials and technical experts to guide 
implementation and consult with donor countries on the 
project's progress.  Donors, including the EU, U.S., Denmark, 
and Canada, believe that the involvement of and coordination 
among all donors with GOL political and security officials is 
a new organizational model for border security improvement. 
(Note:  Donors have agreed that the new effort will not give 
Germany the lead, as it now has with the NBPP, in order to 
avoid the managerial and structural problems that have 
bedeviled the NBPP.  End note.) 
 
¶6. (C) The initial stage of the plan covers the first 70 
kilometers of the northeaster border, with an implementation 
period between April 2009 and June 2010.  The LAF forecasted 
the need for about 1200 personnel from the LAF, Internal 
Security Forces, Customs, and General Security/Immigration in 
the first stage with a total of about 3200 personnel to 
control the entire eastern border from the northern Fisan 
Valley to Shebba'.  According to Zorrilla, the first stage 
will have a rough estimate cost of about $50 million.  A 
month-long terrain survey is scheduled (start date TBD) by 
security agencies and the LAF to bring more clarity to the 
current plan. 
 
UNSCOL WILLIAMS PESSIMISTIC 
ABOUT PROGRESS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) UNSCOL Michael Williams, Zorilla's Chief of Mission, 
told the Ambassador on April 23 that he believes progress on 
the eastern border security plan was unlikely before 
Lebanon's June 7 parliamentary election.  Williams said that 
during UN SYG Ban's January visit to Damascus, Syrian 
President Bashar Asad said he was finishing border issues 
with Jordan and then planned to tackle Syria's border issues 
with Iraq.  The Lebanon border was not Syria's priority, 
Williams assessed.  Prime Minister Siniora also expressed 
skepticism about Syria-Lebanon border security in his April 
23 meeting with Williams.  Although the Syrians had been 
helpful in cracking down on recent drug disputes in the 
Bekaa, Siniora suggested to Williams that the Syrians still 
maintained an open border policy. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (C) Past discussions on border matters indicated the issue 
was one PM Siniora had taken on personally.  All observations 
indicate that whatever momentum the issue had gained since 
Siniora's meeting with international donors in October 
(reftel B) has dissipated.  Nonetheless, UNSCOL and the 
donors intend to continue to promote enhanced border security 
and UNSCR 1701 with GOL interlocutors.  End comment.
