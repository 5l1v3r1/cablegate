SUBJECT: PANAMA: FM "VERY HAPPY" WITH PROGRESS ON PERSEUS V 
CASE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Barbara J. Stephenson for reasons 
1.4 (b) and  (d) 
 
------------------------------------------- 
FM "Very Happy" about Progress on Perseus V 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (C)  "I am very happy about the progress we are making 
resolving the Perseus V case," 1st VP and FM Samuel Lewis 
told the Ambassador and PolCouns on September 30. Lewis was 
referring to the case of the eight Panamanian sailors from 
the Perseus V now serving prison terms in the U.S. for drug 
smuggling.  GOP officials had "ceded" jurisdiction over the 
ship, something that in standard U.S. practice means ceding 
jurisdiction over the ship, cargo and crew.  However, ceding 
jurisdiction over Panamanian crew members contradicts the 
Salas-Becker Agreement (SBA) and Panama's constitution. This 
case has put the GOP under domestic political pressure for 
its cooperation with the USG in implementing the Salas-Becker 
Agreement (SBA) on maritime counter-drug cooperation. Lewis 
said he appreciated the September 12 visit of Brad Keiserman, 
NSC Director of Maritime Threat Reduction and U.S. Coast 
Guard (USCG) Chief of the Operations Law Group, to meet with 
MFA officials, convey official U.S. regret over the action, 
and propose new standard operating procedures (SOP) to avoid 
such problems in the future. He said he was particularly 
pleased that the GOP had the opportunity to present these new 
SOPs at the recent USCG conference in Key West. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Prisoner Exchange Key to Perseus Resolution 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  Lewis also specifically expressed his appreciation 
for the USCG efforts to facilitate the travel of an MFA 
delegation to the U.S. to visit the prisoners in various 
Federal prisons. The MFA is trying to convince the prisoners 
to request transfer to Panama to serve out their terms, under 
bilateral or multilateral prisoner exchange agreements. MFA 
Senior Advisor Adolfo Ahumada said the MFA expected a 
"significant number" of the prisoners would accept transfer 
to Panama (Note: Only two of the eight have so far indicated 
interest in transfer. End Note).  But he agreed to take a 
fresh look at the issue once Salas-Becker is healthy and no 
longer the subject of controversy. He asked, though, that we 
work the issue from the top (i.e. through him) down. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SBA Becomes a Political Football 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (S//NF)  Lewis told the Ambassador that opposition 
deputies had been calling on him to testify before the 
National Assembly on the Perseus V case, and the Salas-Becker 
Agreement in general. He said they were hoping to weaken the 
government by challenging its nationalist credentials. Lewis 
noted that the governing Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) 
majority in the National Assembly had blocked these requests, 
that occur weekly.  Pressed by the Ambassador on the 
operational advantages of using U.S. Navy (USN) ships (i.e. 
"grey hulls") with USCG Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETS) 
in Panamanian waters, Lewis said that given the current 
political environment, it would not be possible to consider 
such an expansion of the U.S. military presence in Panama 
(Note: Under SBA, only USCG ships (i.e. "white hulls") may 
operate in Panamanian waters, under the control of Panamanian 
officers. USN vessels are specifically prohibited from 
participating in this program, unless requested by the GOP. 
End Note). 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  Lewis's excellent mood and optimism on the Perseus V 
case and SBA in general indicate we are headed in the right 
direction. Post hopes that regardless of whether or not the 
Panamanians request transfer, the USG's openness and full 
cooperation on this issue will help put the Perseus V case 
behind us.  Even if this is true, however, the environment 
for the SBA is still politically sensitive. The USG cannot 
afford any further troubles with SBA related cases, nor is it 
the time to try to push the envelope by attempting to secure 
approval for grey hulls with LEDETS embarked. On the issue of 
the use of USN assets in Panamanian waters, Post understands 
that there are limited USCG assets to meet all maritime 
patrol needs, but our broader strategic assets are not served 
by pushing this issue right now. Post was encouraged by 
Lewis' willingness to consider the use of USN assets in 
theory, and Post will take the issue up again in the future, 
when the political situation is more conductive to host 
country acceptance.  The initiative to expand SBA cooperation 
to grey hulls must come from the top once Panama's political 
leadership is prepared and should not emanate from 
operational tensions originating at lower levels.
