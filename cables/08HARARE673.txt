SUBJECT: LITTLE EVIDENCE OF AGRICULTURAL CHEMICAL USE ON 
POLITICAL VICTIMS 
 
REF: HARARE 652 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Despite media reports that the pesticide paraquat 
has been used by ZANU-PF militia on political victims, there 
is no scientific evidence to substantiate the claims. 
Paraquat, an herbicide used on tobacco plantations in 
Zimbabwe, has reportedly been used in two ways: forced 
ingestion or on the skin, particularly in beatings. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a briefing with diplomats on July 22, Movement 
for Democratic Change (MDC) Social Welfare Secretary, Kerry 
Kay said that they believed there had been 30 incidents 
involving beatings with sticks soaked in paraquat.  There are 
other reports of MDC supporters being forced to ingest 
paraquat or other poisons.  But Dr. Frances Lovemore, the 
Counseling Services Unit (CSU) director, told diplomats on 
August 5 that there is no way to corroborate these 
allegations.  Zimbabwe does not have the equipment to perform 
the necessary toxicology tests.  She also noted that paraquat 
is expensive, not easily obtainable, and not widely used in 
rural areas.  While it is possible that agricultural 
chemicals have been used in torture cases, she said it is 
unlikely to have occurred on a large scale.  Dr. Lovemore's 
opinion substantiates the assessment by Dr. Douglas Gwatidzo, 
director of Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights, in a 
conversation with poloff in early July. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT: Reports of agricultural chemicals to 
poison or torture political victims are disturbing.  While 
they may have been used in isolated cases, usage in cases of 
political violence does not appear to have been widespread or 
systematic.  END COMMENT.
