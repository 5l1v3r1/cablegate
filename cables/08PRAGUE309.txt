On May 20, the eve of the Day of Solidarity with the Cuban 
people, Embassy Prague hosted a showing and discussion of the 
film "Damas de Blanco" with the NGO People in Need (PIN). 
Approximately 20 people attended the film event and engaged 
in a lengthy, wide-ranging discussion of conditions in Cuba. 
On May 21, "Mlada Fronta Dnes," the largest Czech daily 
newspaper, ran the op-ed piece prepared by post, under the 
Ambassador's name, regarding the Day of Solidarity. Post has 
highlighted this important issue with articles posted on our 
public website at: http://prague.usembassy.gov.
