SUBJECT:  Southern Sudan: Cattle Rustling Season Precedes 
Rains in Jonglei 
 
REF: Khartoum 00482 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  The end of dry-season migration in 
Jonglei has led to a series of cattle raids targeting 
herders throughout the state.  Cattle rustling is common 
in Southern Sudan, especially at the end of the dry 
season when water is the most scarce and herds must 
travel the furthest.  The SPLA has been unable to prevent 
these raids, and its recent attempts at disarmament have 
reportedly strengthened the ranks of Gordon Kong's South 
Sudan Defense Force (SSDF), which remains a threat to 
peace, stability, and the CPA.  End Summary.

A Resource Battle with an Ethnic Dimension 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Two Lou Nuer cattle herders are confirmed dead and 
there are unconfirmed reports of another 11 captured, 
with about 400 cattle stolen over the past two weeks. 
The SPLA said it would provide protection to the 
migrating Lou Nuer cattle herders as part of a peace deal 
following violent clashes in February (reftel). However, 
the SPLA has been unable to provide that protection due 
to problems with organization and capacity. 
 
¶3. (U) The Lou Nuer are not the only victims of rustling 
in Jonglei, as all cattle herding groups in the region, 
including Dinka and Murle, have explained that 
intertribal, and even interclan, cattle raids are a fact 
of life.  Cattle herders are unwilling to disarm largely 
because of a lack of confidence in the SPLA's ability to 
provide security, a general distrust of the SPLA, and 
because no one wants to be the first to disarm and leave 
themselves vulnerable to the other raiding groups.

SPLA Limitations and SSDF Threats

¶4. (SBU) In separate meetings over the past week, 
officials in the Jonglei county of Twic East; the 
Minister of Culture Youth and Sports John Luk Jok, a 
Dinka from Jonglei; and Member of Parliament Gatkouth 
Kuich, a Nuer from Waat, have said that the SPLA does not 
have the capacity to secure the region.  Jok explained 
that while there is a core group of good soldiers in the 
SPLA, most are undisciplined and unable to defeat the 
superior fighting forces of the raiding militia.  Jok 
would like to see a smaller group of locally recruited 
and professionally trained SPLA soldiers enforce order. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Both Minister Jok and MP Kuich separately 
explained that cattle raiders who do not want to be 
disarmed are joining the South Sudan Defense Forces 
(SSDF) that have declared with the Sudanese Armed Force 
(SAF) and are led by Gordon Kong.  They both said that 
even the groups that had been disarmed are making their 
way to Malakal and being re-armed by SAF-supported 
militias.  Jok believes the first priority of an 
effective SPLA would be to cut off this route to Malakal. 
Both officials also said they fear what this recruiting 
advantage will mean for the SSDF, which has already 
started several skirmishes in the past few weeks in Upper 
Nile (septel).  Jok feels that it would be a serious CPA 
violation if the SAF continues to provide support to 
these groups, including arms, without controlling them 
and integrating them into the SAF.
