¶1.  Costa Rica remains an outspoken critic of the Castro 
government and a faithful supporter of governmental and human 
rights reforms in Cuba.  Costa Rica severed diplomatic ties 
with Cuba in 1961, and has shown no signs that it would 
consider re-establishing formal relations with the Castro 
government.  In the interest of strengthening regional 
support for U.S. policies in Cuba, the USG should continue to 
waive the right to bring an action against Costa Rican 
entities under Title III of the Libertad Act. 
 
¶2.  During the latter half of 2005, Costa Rica continued its 
long-standing, mostly passive opposition to the Castro regime 
in Cuba.  Costa Rica's long-held democratic principles 
dictate that it oppose oppressive regimes generally; its 
proximity to Cuba demands that Costa Rica specifically oppose 
the Castro government.  Apart from the April session of the 
UN Commission on Human Rights, in which Costa Rica split from 
its Central American neighbors to co-sponsor a resolution 
condemning Cuba's human rights record, Costa Rica had few 
formal opportunities to address Cuba on the international 
stage. 
 
¶3.  As in past years, Costa Rica joined international calls 
for an end to the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba at both the 
UN General Assembly and at October's Ibero-American Summit in 
Salamanca, Spain.  This stance should not be read as support 
for the Castro regime, but rather a disagreement over tactics. 
 
¶4.  Costa Rica has continued to accept refugees from Cuba, 
both through direct applications and by participation in 
regional refugee resettlement programs.  By law, Costa Rican 
immigration officials are legally prohibited from returning 
travelers to Cuba against their will.  Once they arrive in 
Costa Rica, any Cuban national may claim asylum and petition 
for refugee status.  Costa Rican officials then work closely 
with the UNHCR to determine placement for the refugee. 
Through the first six months of 2005, the Office of 
Immigration had received 38 applications for refugee status. 
 
¶5.  Per instructions in reftel A, post attempted to identify 
any Costa Rican investments in Cuba.  All of our inquiries 
had negative results.
