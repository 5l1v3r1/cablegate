SUBJECT: PST BAGHDAD: KARADA DISTRICT COUNCIL CHAIRMAN 
HOSTS TOWN HALL RADIO TALK SHOW 
 
 
¶1.  Karada District Council Chairman Mohammed Jassim 
Al-Rubiey told a PST team member on March 11 that on 
that day and for the first time a Baghdad District 
Council chairman, namely himself, conducted a radio 
"town hall meeting" with the public to discuss local 
issues. 
 
¶2.  Al-Rubiey said he received 13 calls during the 90- 
minute session.  Topics discussed included security in 
the Karada District and Zafaraniyah neighborhood and 
essential services: water, electric power, and sewage 
and trash removal.  The status of water projects in 
Karada in anticipation of the summer season was also 
discussed. 
 
¶3.  The radio session was sponsored and carried by 
Radio Somar (phonetic).  Al-Rubiey plans to conduct 
the town hall radio show once a month.  Radio Somar is 
willing to give Al-Rubiey additional airtime. 
 
¶4.  During the call-in session, Al-Rubiey asked local 
citizens to "help us (district council) help you".  He 
is encouraging the residents of Karada to become more 
involved in their district by taking a stake in 
ensuring that Karada is as good a district as it can 
be.  At the end of the show, Al-Rubiey gave listeners 
the telephone number of the Karada District Council 
and asked people to call this number to share with it 
their comments, concerns, and suggestions.
