ELVIRA PRODUCTION CO., ZHELEZNODOROZHNY, RUSSIA, 
LICENSE NO. D390095 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 04948 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Elvira Production Co., Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow 
Region, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application D390095 as the ultimate consignee of 
sixteen (16) model no. HMC559, GAAS MMIC PHEMT 
distributed amplifier die which operates between DC 
and 20 GHZ. These items are controlled for national 
security (NS), anti-terrorism (AT), missile technology 
(MT), and nuclear proliferation (NP) reasons under 
ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Hittite Microwave 
Corporation, 20 Alpha Road, Chelmsford, MA 01824. 
 
¶3. On August 21, 2008, Export Control Attach Peter 
Liston and conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification with Elvira Production Co., 
Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow Region, Russia. The ECO 
Liston met with Anatoliy Belchikov, General Director, 
and Sergey Belchikov, Sales Director at their offices 
located at 10 Zavodsava Street, Zheleznodorozhny, 
Moscow Region, Russia. 
 
¶4. According to Sergey Belchikov, Elvira Products Co. 
was established in 1993, and specialized at that time 
in the development of surveillance and counter- 
surveillance equipment for Russian law enforcement. 
As that industry became saturated in Russia, Elvira 
moved to entry detection equipment with critical 
monitoring applications, primarily de-bugging 
equipment.  The vast majority of their customers were 
still Russian law enforcement.  However, Sergey 
Belchikov indicated that with the growth of the 
Russian private sector, also came the growth of 
economic espionage and the need protect "confidential 
information".  Elvira was able to bypass strict legal 
restraints on the sale of their equipment to the 
private sector by marketing their products as 
protecting confidential information, and not 
surveillance detection equipment.  Elvira still 
manufactures non-linear detection equipment, or NLJD, 
called the Lornet 24 and were clear in advising the 
ECO that no U.S. licensable technology goes into it. 
Elvira has approximately 110 employees all located at 
the complex visited by the ECO.  Elvira is moving to a 
brand new 300 square meters gated complex located 
adjacent to their current operations that is still 
under construction and which they will own. 
 
¶5. Elvira is also in the business of manufacturing 
Network Analyzers similar to those manufactured by 
Agilent Technology.  Elvira's Network Analyzers will 
accurately characterize components by measuring their 
effect on the amplitude and phase of swept-frequency 
and swept power test signals.  The 16 model HMC559, 
GAAS MMIC PHEMT distributed amplifier die will be used 
in the manufacture of the Elvira Network Analyzers. 
Sergey Belchikov presented the 16 Hittite amplifier 
die to the ECO for inspection, and stated that based 
upon the delivery schedule they were not sure that 
they would have had them in time for their last 
manufacturing schedule and that is why they have not 
utilized them as of yet.  Sergey Belchikov indicated 
that Elvira makes two different model Network 
Analyzers, one with the licensable Hittite amplifiers 
and one without.  Their target market are the Russian 
companies on budgets that cannot afford the higher end 
Agilent Technology type Network Analyzers. 
 
¶6.  Based upon the interview conducted by ECO Liston 
it is believed that Elvira Production Co. LTD will be 
utilizing the subject commodity for which it is 
licensed.  They were open and forthwith to all 
questions presented by the ECO and were not evasive. 
The entire shipment was accounted for and there is no 
indication of impropriety. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Elvira Production 
Co., Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow Region, Russia, Russia 
as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
