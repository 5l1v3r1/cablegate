¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  On September 8, Foreign Ministry officials 
confirmed that Nicaragua has not recognized Kosovo and has no 
plans to do so in the future.  This formal confirmation of 
the GON position on Kosovo comes eight months after our first 
inquiries (REF I) and stands in stark contrast to Nicaragua's 
lightning-quick recognition of the breakaway Georgian 
"republics" of South Ossetia and Abkhazia (REF B).  In a 
separate conversation with the Ambassador on the same day 
(REF A), Foreign Minister Samuel Santos drew a distinction 
between Nicaragua's opposing stances on Kosovo and the 
Georgian "republics" -- a position that differs greatly from 
the one he asserted to the Deputy Secretary in February. 
Nicaragua's formal, though not-public, statement on Kosovo 
may reduce the chance that other Central American nations 
will formally recognize Kosovo.  As early as February, 
Managua had actively worked to block a long-promised 
consensus decision by Central American countries to recognize 
Kosovo.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Ossetia "Si," Kosovo "No"

¶2.  (C) On September 8, we met with Rene Morales, Americas 
Division Director, to discuss positions on upcoming UNGA 
agenda items.  In response to our question from a previous 
meeting regarding Serbia's plan to request that the ICJ rule 
on Kosovo's status (REF C), Morales confirmed to us that the 
Government of Nicaragua (GON) had not recognized Kosovo and 
did not have any plans to do so.  This statement of GON 
policy came more than six months after we first inquired 
about this theme (REF J) and on the heels of Nicaragua's 
highly-publicized formal recognition of South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia (REF B).  On the same day, but in a separate 
conversation with the Ambassador, Foreign Minister Samuel 
Santos confirmed Nicaragua's non-recognition of Kosovo and 
drew a distinction between Kosovo and Nicaragua's 
lightning-quick decision to recognize the breakaway Georgian 
"republics" of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Santos asserted 
that Kosovo did not fall under United Nations norms, that 
Kosovo was an "unnatural division" of Yugoslavia that had 
damaged its territorial integrity, and so "different 
criteria" had been applied to the GON's non-recognition 
Kosovo.

¶3. (C) During a Valentine's Day meeting, Foreign Minister 
Samuel Santos assured the Deputy Secretary that Nicaragua was 
"studying the issue" of recognition for Kosovo.  By 
mid-February, it seemed that most Central American countries 
were poised to recognize Kosovo.  In fact, regional reporting 
indicated that a formal recognition statement had been in the 
works, perhaps in conjunction with a Heads-of-State meeting 
of the Central American Security Initiative (SICA), hosted by 
El Salvador (REFS H, I).  However, the statement never 
materialized.  Our contacts later told us that during the 
SICA meeting, almost at the moment Santos was meeting with 
the Deputy Secretary, the GON had actively blocked consensus 
in favor of Kosovo recognition.  By May, Guatemala, El 
Salvador and Panama had all backed away from recognition.

¶4.  (C) The principal basis for this decision may have been 
the question:  "Will it oppose the U.S. position?"  We also 
suspect that, as in the recognition of Ossetia and Abkhazia, 
Ortega may hope that aligning Nicaragua with Russia may 
somehow herald a return to the privileged position and 
accompanying largesse which it received in the 1980s from the 
Soviet Union.
