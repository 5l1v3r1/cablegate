¶1.  (SBU) PA General Intelligence (Mukhabarat) officers 
arrested PIJ militants Ra'ad Abu al-Rub and Yusif Kmayl in 
Jenin May 12, according to a PIJ spokesman, who said another 
militant, Ala'a Abu al-Rub, escaped a PA arrest attempt in 
Qabatiya also May 12.  National Security Forces (NSF) 
contacts said the two PIJ members, accused of firing at 
Jenin's police station, are in police custody at Jenin's 
hospital undergoing treatment for gunshot injuries.  NSF 
contacts said another PIJ militant, Salih Abu Zayyad, is in 
jail after his May 11 arrest (Ref A) pending a court hearing. 
 NSF contacts say the PA is still searching for al-Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigades leader Nasser Khzaymih.  They also said 
Khzaymih and the PIJ militants are wanted for offenses 
against the PA, and the GOI has not requested they be 
arrested.

Investigates "Fake Checkpoint"

¶2.  (SBU) In addition to villages reported Ref A, a 
Presidential Guard/NSF/police force patrolled through Umm 
al-Rihan, 'Arab al-Hamdan, and Nazlat Zayd (small villages 
west of Nablus near the separation barrier) late May 12. 
NSF/police contacts say they arrested 21 criminal suspects 
May 12-13 in these villages and Jenin.  Jenin NSF commander 
BG Sulayman Imran said May 13 that the NSF are investigating 
whether criminals set up a checkpoint and impersonated NSF 
soldiers in 'Arrana village (north of Jenin).
