SUBJECT: GERMANY SUPPORTS USG POSITION ON RETURN OF HEU TO 
RUSSIA 
 
REF: STATE 126518 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In the interest of enlisting German MFA support to 
expedite preparations for the return of Highly Enriched 
Uranium (HEU) from the Rossendorf Research Reactor in Saxony, 
Germany to Russia by the end of 2010, Berlin EMIN delivered 
the reftel DOE letter with cover letter to MFA Deputy 
Director General, Ambassador Viktor Elbling.  In a follow-up 
conversation on December 5, Elbling told EMIN that Germany is 
aware of the need to expedite delivery of the HEU to Russia 
and is in complete agreement with the letter's contents. 
However, Elbling stressed that in order to transfer the HEU 
to Russian, the MFA must first get the support of the German 
Environmental Ministry (BMU), who has yet to take a position 
on this matter. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a prior conversation, Dr. Joerg Polster, MFA 
Nuclear Energy Policy officer, told EconOff that his ministry 
intends to distribute the reftel letter up to the highest 
levels of the MFA, as well as to senior officials in the BMU. 
 Polster said that he is optimistic that this letter should 
"do the trick" and prompt the MFA to approach the Russians. 
However, Polster also said the possibility of delay exists 
due to associated political sensitivities within the BMU. 
Elaborating, he said the real issue is that the BMU may be 
wary that the Russians will not handle the HEU in accordance 
with German environmental Standards; BMU may also fear 
potential political backlash from environmentalists in an 
election year.  Pointing out Steinmeier's candidacy as 
Chancellor, Polster cautioned that the MFA may be inclined to 
drag their feet on the HEU transfer - which is why his office 
requested the letter in the first place. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) EconOff also spoke with Axel Groehner, the 
responsible desk officer on this issue from Ministry of 
Economics (BMWi), who confirmed that his ministry's views are 
aligned with the MFA.  Like Polster, Groehner emphasized that 
the BMU might pose difficulties.  Groehner also said that he 
understood that the HEU delivery would take place by air, and 
the BMU must agree before the delivery can take place. 
(COMMENT: Unlike the USG, German Ministries operate with 
relative autonomy.  The implication is neither the MFA nor 
even the Chancellery may be able to force the BMU,s hand on 
this matter.  END COMMENT).
