¶1. On November 21, 2006, AIT econoff delivered FAA requests for 
investigation and investigative enforcement reports on EVA Airways 
Flights BR635 and BR698 (refs A and B, docket numbers 2006AL030038 
and 2006AL030069, respectively) to Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics 
Administration (CAA).  Econoff met with CAA Flight Safety Division 
Director Lee Wan-lee and asked that CAA take appropriate action in 
the cases.  Within 90 days, AIT will inquire with CAA about what 
action has been taken and report back to State and FAA. 
 
¶2. During the meeting, Lee expressed frustration with the long delay 
in receiving case information for civil aviation violations.  He 
noted that the two incidents took place on January 23 and February 
5, 2006 and complained that enforcement action was less effective 
after such a long delay.  He pointed out that CAA's communications 
with other aviation authorities in the region on similar issues were 
much timelier.  He urged U.S. agencies to expedite the process or 
alternatively to provide preliminary, informal notification of this 
type of violation.  Lee offered to serve as a window for this type 
of notification, recommending that FAA notify him directly by 
e-mail. 
 
¶3. Lee also objected to the language used in the Summary of Facts 
for the BR635 incident.  The summary reads "EVA flight 635 
intentionally flew the ANC-3 departure instead of the assigned and 
acknowledged KNIK-6 departure."  Lee argued that it was inaccurate 
to use the word "intentionally" and believes that "incorrectly" 
would have been a better choice of words.
