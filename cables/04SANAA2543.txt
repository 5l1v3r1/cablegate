SUBJECT: YEMEN BLUE LANTERN ANNUAL UPDATE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 205022 
 
¶1.  POST BLUE LANTERN POC: Julie Kim Johnson, Economic and 
Commercial Officer; phone 011-967-303-155, extension 2719 
(IVG 469-2719); e-mail: JohnsonJK@state.gov; fax 
011-967-303-183; estimated departure date Summer 2006. 
 
¶2.  LOCAL CONDITIONS:  The various ROYG military branches and 
agencies react differently to Blue Lantern checks.  Some, 
such as the Air Force, are less likely to comply fully than 
others.  Poor inventory controls mean that some ROYG military 
agencies are not so much unwilling as unable to locate 
commodities in question.  Inventory, inventory control, and 
detailed, computerized record keeping are weak points in 
Yemeni military agencies. 
 
¶3.  EMBASSY RESOURCES: Post has appointed one econ/commoff as 
the lead on Blue Lantern checks.  Under normal conditions, 
thirty days are enough to comply with the checks.  However, 
if a military organization does not which to cooperate it 
will likely delay compliance rather than refuse the Blue 
Lantern check.  In such cases more than 30 days may be 
required to determine the ROYG's intentions.
