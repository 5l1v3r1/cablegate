China Hopes BDA Issue Resolved Properly 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  MFA Spokesman Liu Jianchao said at the March 20 
regular press briefing that China hopes the agreement 
reached regarding frozen DPRK accounts in Banco Delta 
Asia will be conducive to the overall goal of the 
Korean Peninsula's denuclearization.  The United 
States should work with the Macau SAR Government to 
fully resolve the situation while ensuring Macau's 
financial stability.  He declined to respond to a 
question asking whether the MFA had changed its 
position from last week that China "regrets" the 
handling of the issue. 
 
Six-Party Talks "Complicated" 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  Bilateral consultations were held this morning as 
part of the Six-Party Talks, Liu said.  VFM Wu opened 
the Talks by spelling out the mission and purpose of 
this round of Talks.  The process may be long and 
complicated, but China hopes all parties honor their 
February 13 agreements and solve issues of concern. 
On the issue of a possible meeting of foreign 
ministers, he said the parties need to consult 
further.  China announced no firm date for completion 
of this round of Talks. 
 
¶4.  Responding to a question on VFM Kim's remarks 
about the DPRK's relationship with the IAEA, Liu said 
China noticed Kim's remarks, realizes the DPRK is 
ready to shut down and seal the Yongbyon reactor and 
to accept monitoring and supervision by the IAEA. 
China hopes all parties will honor the "principle of 
action for action."  The Spokesman avoided answering 
questions about DPRK VFM Kim Kye-gwan's criticism of 
Japan as not eligible for participation in the Talks, 
but acknowledged that substantial differences remain 
between the DPRK and Japan. 
 
Iran: Russia Withholds Uranium 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  China is concerned about the Iran nuclear issue, 
 
BEIJING 00001887  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Liu said when asked to comment on Russia's decision to 
withhold shipments of enriched uranium to Iran.  China 
hopes the Iran nuclear issue can be resolved through 
diplomatic efforts.  Any UNSC action should be 
conducive to those effort.  Liu reaffirmed China's 
opposition to nuclea proliferation. 
 
Third Kidnapping in Nigeria 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Prompted byChinese news media, Liu announced that 
two more Chinese citizens have been abducted by 
unknown assailants in Nigeria.  The regularity of 
these cases prompted MFA to request the Nigerian 
government pay attention to this issue and take 
measures to prevent future kidnappings.  The MFA has 
released information about safety on its website and 
advises its citizens abroad to exercise more caution. 
Safety of citizens is a top priority for China and 
every effort will be made for the safe return of those 
kidnapped, said Liu. 
 
Wen's Japan Visit Still on Track 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Media reports that PM Wen's April visit to Japan 
will be shortened due to the furor over PM Abe's 
comfort women remarks was dismissed by Liu as 
"speculation."  China and Japan are consulting closely 
regarding the visit.  PM Wen will discuss China-Japan 
history issues during the visit.  Wen's visit to the 
ROK is not a new addition to the trip. 
 
Hu to Visit Russia 
------------------ 
 
¶8.  At the invitation of President Putin, President Hu 
will visit Russia from March 26-28 and attend the 
China Year in Russia opening ceremony. 
 
Visits: Norway PM, Chinese to Australia, Latin America 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶9.  At the invitation of PM Wen, Norway PM Stoltenberg 
will visit China from March 25-28.  Following up on a 
previous announcement that VFM Lu Guozeng will visit 
Australia and the Pacific soon, Liu said VFM Lu is 
visiting at the invitation of various nations in the 
region, will exchange views with his counterparts and 
will promote deeper cooperation in the region.  He 
ducked a question whether Lu would discuss mining 
investments in Papua New Guinea and Australian uranium 
exports to China. 
 
¶10.  Politburo Standing Committee member Li 
Changchun's visit to five Latin American countries 
from March 19 to April 5 is not confined to central 
government officials but includes provincial 
government officials from China and meetings with 
state and local officials in Latin America.  Liu 
referred reporters to the Communist Party's 
International Department for more information. 
 
Human Rights: Extradition Treaty, Vatican Talks 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶11. China and France are in close consultation about 
an extradition treaty, but will announce its content 
after it is finalized, Liu said in response to a 
question about the human rights implications of such a 
treaty.  Liu had no comment when asked about a 
reported meeting between Chinese and Vatican 
officials.
