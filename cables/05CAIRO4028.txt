¶1.  (SBU)  The Charge chaired the May 25 IDWG meeting, which 
was attended by the Acting DCM; USAID D&G staff; PA Counselor 
and PA staff; and ECPO staff.  IDWG participation was limited 
to cleared Americans only to permit discussion of the status 
of post's submission to the Department for use in developing 
the Democracy Reform Strategy to Support Freedom in Egypt. 
ECPO advised the IDWG members that the Department is 
currently reviewing post's submission and using elements of 
it to develop a coordinated strategy document to guide USG 
support for democracy in Egypt. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  USAID reviewed progress of grant applications made 
in response to its Annual Program Statement (APS).  USAID 
noted that in addition to the more than 50 applications 
received thus far, it was expecting an application in the 
next few days from NDI.  USAID did not have any additional 
information about a grant application by IRI.  USAID 
discussed the relative merits of briefing the next meeting 
(on May 31) of the joint US-Egyptian Consultative Group on 
direct funding of democracy support about the goal of getting 
NDI and IRI operational in Egypt. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Charge briefed the IDWG on an appeal from Mrs. 
Suzanne Mubarak to PDAS Cheney, during the latter's May 23-24 
visit to Cairo, for USG support for a training course for 
Egyptian librarians.  The Acting DCM undertook to follow up 
with Mrs. Mubarak's staff regarding the submission of a 
formal proposal requesting USG support for the librarian 
training initiative.  Public Affairs Counselor noted that IIP 
colleagues in the Department and at the Information Resource 
Center in the Embassy may be able to serve as resources for 
this project.
