¶1.  Summary:  Indigenous leaders met on March 31 in 
Tunguragua province to discuss future anti-FTA protest plans. 
 Leaders of the main indigenous organization, CONAIE, 
rejected an agreement signed by the GOE with other groups to 
begin greater education and dialogue on the FTA.  Indigenous 
in Imbabura province and the main evangelical indigenous 
group are also calling for greater dialogue on the costs and 
benefits of an FTA.  The evangelical indigenous organization 
FEINE and the campesino organization FENOCIN are planning 
anti-FTA marches from various provinces to reach Quito 
beginning April 4.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Approximately 200 indigenous leaders held an assembly on 
March 31 in Salasaca, Tunguragua province, to discuss 
possible protests for the following week.  The meeting was 
moved from Chimborazo province, which remains under a state 
of emergency suspending freedom of assembly.  GOE officials 
had threatened to enforce the ban, so the meeting was moved 
to neighboring Tunguragua province, where the state of 
emergency is not in effect.  Santiago de la Cruz, vice 
president of CONAIE, told PolOff on March 30 that he did not 
feel the government was responding adequately to CONAIE 
demands.  Protests, to be defined in the March 31 meeting, 
would continue until that perception changes.  De La Cruz was 
adamant that CONAIE did not seek to bring down the Palacio 
government. 
 
Dividing the Indigenous 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  Minister of Government Felipe Vega signed an agreement 
with some indigenous leaders, including Chimborazo provincial 
authorities, on March 29 in Riobamba.  In it, the GOE agreed 
to start a pilot program in Chimborazo province to publicize 
information on the free trade agreement.  The government 
would finance conferences with students and others to help 
provide information on the FTA.  CONAIE leaders rejected the 
agreement and refuse to dialogue with the GOE.  On March 31, 
Mercedes del Castillo, assistant to the Otavalo mayor (in 
Imbabura province), told PolOff that indigenous leaders in 
Imbabura had sent a resolution to the CONAIE meeting in 
Salasaca rejecting any more protest mobilizations, and 
instead proposing dialogue and education on the FTA. 
 
FEINE and FENOCIN To March To Quito 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Meanwhile, and independent of CONAIE's moves, evangelical 
indigenous organization FEINE and indigenous and campesino 
organization FENOCIN have announced they will join for 
anti-FTA mobilizations, arriving in Quito beginning April 4. 
Marco Murillo, head of FEINE, announced that members of his 
organization will mobilize the week of April 3, while also 
holding debates on the FTA in Otavalo and Latacunga.  FENOCIN 
leader Pedro de la Cruz has announced that his organization's 
protests will be peaceful and would not include road blocks. 
FENOCIN estimates that 7,000 of its members will march from 
various provinces to Quito.  An advisor to Marco Murillo of 
FEINE, told PolOff on March 31 that FEINE was calling for 
dialogue with various sectors, especially business, on the 
FTA. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  The impetus for protests will likely weaken should the 
current FTA round end inconclusively, and it remains to be 
seen if CONAIE can successfully turn out large numbers of 
protesters in the capital.  Calls for dialogue are a positive 
sign and offer the GOE an opportunity to inform the public 
about prospective FTA benefits.
