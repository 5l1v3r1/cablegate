¶1.  (SBU) On January 21, Iran cut its daily natural gas 
shipment to Turkey from almost 30 million cubic meters to 5- 
10 million cm (some daily fluctuation).  Coming on the heels 
of the Russian-Ukraine gas face-off, the current gas crisis 
in Georgia, and cold weather and concerns in Europe, the cut- 
off has generated broad concern about Turkey's natural gas 
situation.  Although on an annual basis, Iran provides 15% 
of Turkey's gas, the current short-fall is almost 20% of 
Turkey's daily requirement, because of winter variation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The GOT has faced strong criticism in the press 
for inadequate contingency planning and not taking timely 
steps to put in place sufficient gas storage capacity. 
Energy Ministry sources tell us Energy Minister Guler has 
been meeting with the Iranian ambassador in an attempt to 
resume shipment.  In a long television interview January 26, 
Guler said the GOT has sought high level assurances from 
Russia that it would increase gas supply and assured the 
public that residential consumers would not be affected. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In addition, BOTAS, the state-owned pipeline 
operator, cut gas supply to automobile producers and 
"interruptible" industrial and electricity generation plants 
-- most with fuel switching capacity.  However, the GOT 
backed off plans for more widespread cuts to industry.  For 
the longer term, Guler also reaffirmed plans to increase gas 
storage capability and to develop an LNG importing and 
processing capability. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment:  Like a comparable cut-off last year by 
Iran, the reasons for the cut-off are perceived as partly 
technical (cold weather causing problems with compressors), 
partly political, and partly winter energy requirements in 
Iran.  Turkey recently cancelled a technical visit to Iran 
to discuss gas supply issues and has taken the contract to 
international arbitration over gas price and quality issues. 
Although Turkish officials tell us they have grounds to 
pursue cancellation of the contract with Iran, they have 
been unwilling to pursue that step for energy supply 
diversification and political reasons. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The extent of the disruption is serious, but it 
appears be manageable.  The state pipeline company BOTAS has 
suffered personnel changes over the years, reducing 
experience and technical capacity, and reducing its capacity 
to confidently put in place technical algorithms for this 
kind of crisis.  The fact that the Energy Ministry and 
President Erdogan immediately stepped into the fray is an 
indication of BOTAS' institutional weakness.
