¶1. (U) On Dec. 11, the Finnish Parliament ratified the US-EU 
Agreements on Extradition and Mutual legal Assistance between 
the United States and the European Union, which had been 
signed in Washington on June 25, 2003.  Parliament also 
approved the implementing bilateral instruments.  Tuomo 
Antila, senior counsel to the Parliament's Legal Affairs (LA) 
committee, told PolChief that, technically, "Parliament has 
given its consent to ratification," and that the next steps 
now occur in Brussels.  However, he confirmed that the 
"Finnish portion" of the ratification process for both the 
agreements themselves and for the implementing bilateral 
instruments is now complete. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Finnish ratification had been held up since late 
2005 largely because of some MPs' concerns over US use of the 
death penalty; alleged CIA renditions in Europe; and the 
perceived impact these US-EU agreements might have on these 
two issues.  The Embassy has engaged in nearly a year of 
outreach with concerned MPs, including the chairs of the LA 
and Constitutional Law committees, in an attempt to allay 
their fears (reftels).  We are pleased to now be able to 
report the results of these positive efforts.
