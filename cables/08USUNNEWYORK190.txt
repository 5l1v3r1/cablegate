¶1. (SBU) USUN Poloff delivered reftel demarche on February 20 
to UN DPKO officials, Max Kerley and Fouzia Abass, requesting 
UNAMID formalize arrangements for medical assistance and 
emergency evacuation assistance to the American field 
officers deployed to Darfur. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 28, USUN Poloff contacted the UN 
Department of Field Support and the Darfur Integrated 
Operations Team to request follow-up on the initial request. 
Darfur IOT Director Mike Gaouette responded that the UN DPKO 
appreciated the assistance provided by the U.S. Field Office 
in Darfur and is eager to conclude an exchange of letters to 
formalize emergency support.  Gaouette said he would 
communicate the request to UNAMID Headquarters in Sudan and 
said AmEmbassy Khartoum should follow up with UNAMID HQ. 
Gaouette cautioned that UNAMID HQ could take several days to 
process the request, but that he would communicate the 
urgency. Gaouette said an official letter from USUN would 
help him expedite a response from UNAMID. 
 
¶3. (SBU) USUN Poloff drafted a letter detailing the request, 
cleared it with AF/SPG, and delivered it to IOT director Mike 
Gaouette on February 28.
