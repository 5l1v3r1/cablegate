¶2. (SBU) PolOff delivered ref A demarche urging China to 
support the circulated draft exception for India at the 
August 21-22 Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) Plenary to MFA 
Arms Control and Disarmament Department Nuclear Division 
Deputy Director Dai Huaicheng on August 13.  (Note:  More 
senior Chinese Government officials were not available to 
meet to discuss this issue.)  PolOff stressed the critical 
importance to the United States of completing the U.S.-India 
Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative this year.  Completion 
of the Initiative would bring significant gains to the global 
nonproliferation regime. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dai responded that China fully understands the 
importance of the Initiative to the United States, and said 
China is considering the NSG exception for India "very 
carefully."  China will consult with "appropriate parties if 
any questions arise."  Dai said China expects to be 
represented at the NSG Plenary by MFA Arms Control and 
Disarmament Department Director General Cheng Jingye.
