Classified By: CDA PETER BRENNAN REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (SBU) DCM Peter Brennan delivered reftel demarches on 
November 8 to Nicaraguan FM Nelson Caldera regarding the 
annual Cuban Embargo Resolution and the proposed Australian 
Human Rights Amendment. Amenable to receiving talking points 
on these issues, Caldera gave assurances that the Nicaraguan 
representative at UNGA would be absent during the votes. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Turning to the topic of reftel demarches on country 
specific human rights resolutions to be voted on during the 
UNGA third committee, DCM delivered talking points to FM 
Caldera outlining U.S. interest in garnering Nicaragua's 
support.  Caldera gave assurances that rather than voting in 
favor of U.S. position on resolutions, the Nicaraguan 
delegate would be absent during the votes.  Caldera further 
noted that Nicaragua had never severed diplomatic ties with 
Iran or DPRK. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment:  Caldera and his advisor Ariel Granera 
conveyed to DCM a sense of despair among colleagues in the 
wake of the FSLN victory, speculated about changes during the 
transition between the Bolanos and Ortega administrations, 
and lamented the finger-pointing among the Liberals that 
would ensue.  While  conceding that the FSLN had committed 
"no fraud" nor did "they need it to win," Granera echoed a 
common complaint that election returns from the "Liberal 
bastions" of the interior were delayed or "reported last." 
Regarding Daniel Ortega's decision to allow the 
constitutional reforms to go through, Caldera explained that 
since Ortega had already named his people for key regulatory 
institutions and will have named his ministers and 
ambassadors by January 20, the reforms will not be a major 
problem while he is in office, but will be a major hindrance 
to his successor. END COMMENT
