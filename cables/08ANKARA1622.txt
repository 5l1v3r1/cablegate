SUBJECT: DELIVERY OF AI DEMARCHE TO TURKISH GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: STATE 92335 
 
 Per REFTEL, we delivered a nonpaper to the Turkish Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, Turkish Ministry of Health, and Turkish 
Agriculture Ministry.  There has been no response as of yet 
from the Ministry of Health or the MFA. The Agriculture 
Ministry indicated that the Minister was considering 
attending the conference.  Due to a recent loss in the 
Minister's family, however, no travel plans have been made 
yet, and the decision regarding his attendance will be made 
upon his return to Ankara.  We will follow up with the other 
ministries and will advise once we get a definite answer.
