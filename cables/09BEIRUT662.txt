Atmospherics: 
------------- 
 
The press underscored the results of the presidential elections in 
Iran, concluding that Ahmadinejad's victory was a "political 
decision," meant to be a message to the United States. 
 
Media outlets gave second billing to Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu's speech, noting in particular his refusal to stop the 
settlements and his rejection of Palestinians returning to their 
home country.  The press noted that Netanyahu "blew" all peace 
initiatives and agreements reached during the last three decades, 
and seemed to "inaugurate a campaign against the Obama 
Administration and its policies in the Middle East."

"An Atomic Bomb," an editorial by Sateh Noureddine in Arab 
nationalist As-Safir (6/13): 
 
"Iran decided not to change: tt did not want to change its President 
or rhetoric at this point in time.  It decided to wait for the next 
American offer before it presents any concessions for free.  Iran 
believes that it has not been defeated in any of the battles it got 
involved in during the last four years, particularly its nuclear 
battle.  How and why Iran decided on this course, however, is not 
something the Iranians can be proud of...By this decision (to keep 
Ahmadinejad at his post), it looks as if Iran has decided not to 
meet President Obama half way, because in Iran's view, ...President 
Obama has not really given anything more than his predecessor. 
...In any case, there are those who believe that President Obama has 
opened up to the Sunni Islamic world, much more than he opened up to 
the Shi'a Islamic world..." 
 
"The Revolution Eats Its Sons," an editorial by Ghassan Jawad in 
pro-Sunni Al-Liwa' (6/14): 
 
"It is clear that the return of President Ahmadinejad to his post as 
the head of the Islamic Republic of Iran is in fact a radical 
political decision.  We can conclude then that the Iranian 
leadership has taken a decision to hold negotiations with the new 
American Administration in its capacity as a radical country. 
...Ahmadinejad's return to his post in this manner indicates that 
leaders in Iran want to send messages inside and outside Iran which 
say that there will be no change in Iran's policy..." 
 
"The Protector of the Dictionary," an editorial by Ghassan Charbel 
in pan-Arab Al-Hayat (6/14): 
 
"We are in Iran and not in England or Austria.  The democratic game 
is not open to its fullest limits.  It is a democracy that takes 
place under the pictures of the Imam Kohmeini. ... The Iranian 
President is neither a policy nor a decision maker.  The real 
decision maker is the Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  He has 
the final saying in foreign policy, defense, security, media, and 
even culture.  The president is only an implementer of Khamenei's 
policies...Iran chose to continue to exist in the shadow of 
Ahmadinejad' s dictionary, and this dictionary is very far from 
Obama's dictionary..."
