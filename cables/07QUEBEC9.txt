SUBJECT: WHTI -AIR IN QUEBEC CITY FULL COMPLIANCE ON DAY ONE 
 
¶1. Consular staff spoke with airline boarding chiefs at Quebec 
City's Jean Lesage Airport, who reported that things went 
smoothly during this first day of WHTI-Air.  No passengers were 
refused boarding, and none came unprepared. 
 
¶2. Quebec City, which is the only airport in the consular 
district with U.S.-bound flights, does not have CBP 
pre-clearance.  Direct U.S.-bound flights are offered by 
Continental (Newark), Delta (Boston) and Northwest (Detroit). 
Air Canada Jazz dominates the flight schedule, and all its 
U.S.-bound passengers are preinspected while transiting Montreal 
or Toronto, but document checks are done at Quebec City. 
 
¶3. When conoffs met last week with airline representatives and 
shared the guidance on CBP enforcement flexibility, all opposed 
using it lest it create confusion and doubts about 
implementation.  Continental and Northwest subsequently received 
instructions from headquarters to make use of it needed, but 
thus far there has been no need. 
 
¶4. Airline representatives repeatedly express their satisfaction 
with the new regulations, as it radically simplifies their 
document inspections. 
 
¶5. Neither of Quebec City's dailies covered WHTI this morning. 
Weekend stories focused on the long waits at Canadian passport 
offices.
