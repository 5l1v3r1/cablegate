SUBJECT: Guangdong's Migrant Worker NPC Delegate: Looking for 
On-the-Job Training 
 
REF: Guangzhou 27 
 
¶1. (U) Social security, education for migrant workers' children and 
the welfare of migrant workers in general are critical issues for 
South China's workers, according to Guangdong's migrant worker 
representative to the National People's Congress (NPC) Hu Xiaoyan. 
Hu, who was not among the original six migrant workers elected to 
the Guangdong People's Congress (reftel), told the Consul General 
February 28 that she would "try [her] best" to represent Guangdong's 
30 million migrant laborers and that she appreciated the trust 
placed in her by the government. 
 
"Things Always Change Faster than You Plan" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) With only a short period of training in Zhuhai and no staff 
to help her prepare for the NPC in Beijing, Hu understandably 
appeared somewhat overwhelmed by her new assignment.  Hu said she 
did not have a plan for her five-year term because "things always 
change faster than you plan," though she did intend to "work 
closely" with the other two NPC migrant delegates (from Shanghai and 
Chongqing, according to Xinhua) to promote migrant workers' 
equities.  Throughout the meeting, Hu generally resorted to talking 
points in response to substantive questions. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment: The appointment of Hu and two other migrant worker 
representatives to the NPC is a start -- perhaps more cosmetic than 
substantive -- in addressing the needs of China's floating labor 
population.  Although government media have celebrated the way she 
"often stays up late to collect requests and suggestions of fellow 
migrant workers," Hu told us that as of late February no workers 
from her company had approached her to discuss issues for 
representation.  Indeed, though Hu said she welcomed input from 
workers by phone, email, letter, or through the trade union, the 
extent of actual exchange was unclear. 
 
Biographical Data 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Hu Xiaoyan, 34, hails from Guang'an, Sichuan Province, (Deng 
Xiaoping's hometown and perhaps a symbolic reason for her selection) 
where she worked as a farmer before coming to Guangdong Province in 
¶1998.  Although Hu only has a middle-school education, she has 
proven herself an able worker and currently serves as a Deputy 
Supervisor at the Xin Ming Zhu (New Pearl) Ceramic Industrial 
Company, located in Foshan, where she was named one of the city's 
"Top Ten Migrant Workers" in 2006.  Hu's husband, Liu Jiaming, also 
works at the Xin Ming Zhu Company.  The two have twin daughters who 
live in Guang'an.
