¶1. (U) The Office of Agricultural Affairs (OAA) co-sponsored a 
Basics of Biotechnology conference with the Agriculture Genetic 
Engineering and Research Institute (AGERI) within Ministry of 
Agriculture from March 19-21, 2007.  The course focused on providing 
general awareness on agricultural biotechnology in Egypt, with an 
emphasis on biotechnology research, regulatory policy, technology 
transfer and commercialization, and communication. 
 
¶2. (U) The workshop was the third activity in a sequence of events 
that will take place under a 12-month project to expand acceptance 
of biotechnology in Egypt and to facilitate inter-ministerial 
cooperation in its application and advancement.  NOTE: The first 
activity was the kick-off of the project in September 2006 (sEE 
REFTEL).  The second activity consisted of consultations between 
ministry officials and a private consultant on procedural guidelines 
necessary to establish a national competent authority within the 
ministry. End note. 
 
¶3. (U) The conference lasted three days.  More than 100 attendees 
from the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Environment, and Foreign 
Affairs participated.  Topics included global perspectives on 
agricultural biotechnology, biotechnology regulation and research 
programs in Egypt, international treaties and agreements related to 
biotechnology and biosafety, environmental biosafety issues 
associated with biotechnology crops, the biotechnology regulatory 
system in the United States, and strategies for commercialization of 
biotechnology products.  World-renown experts demonstrated their 
vast knowledge of the subject matter:  a presenter from the 
Philippines spoke on her countrys approach to accepting 
biotechnology; a farmer from India spoke about the many benefits, 
especially financial, that his family now receives as a result of 
using biotechnology seeds. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ambassador addressed the conference and encouraged 
those in attendance to embrace change.  He stressed that Egypt is a 
great society, and there is one thing that all great societies 
throughout history have in common: they welcome change and use it as 
a tool to their benefit.  The Minister of Agriculture and the 
Minister of Environment also gave remarks to the assembly.  NOTE: 
Though the Minister of Agriculture gave an upbeat, progressive 
speech in favor of biotechnology,  the Minister of Environment was 
less enthusiastic, infusing a sense of negativity throughout his 
remarks by emphasizing the importance of working at a slow pace to 
protect the environment.  His remarks demonstrated his lack of 
awareness of the current biotech situation in Egypt.
