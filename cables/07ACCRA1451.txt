SUBJECT: PDAS THOMAS-GREENFIELD MEETS WITH PRESIDENT KUFUOR 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  On June 28, Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Africa Linda Thomas-Greenfield and the U.S. 
 
SIPDIS 
delegation to the Africa Union Summit met with Ghanaian 
President John Kufuor.  Kufuor agreed with the USG approach 
on Sudan but his staff thought the current draft UNSC 
resolution on Sudan required softening.  He reiterated the 
GOG's commitment of 350 troops to AMISOM.  End summary. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Sudan/UNSC Resolution:  P/DAS Thomas Greenfield 
pointed out that the U.S. welcomed the willingness of Ghana 
and the United Kingdom to co-sponsor the draft UNSC 
resolution authorizing the hybrid force.  P/DAS urged that 
Ghana as a member of the Security Council and Chair of the AU 
use its influence to seek buy-in from other African leaders. 
Kufour agreed with most of the content of the resolution. 
However, Special Advisor to the Chairman of the African Union 
Nana Effah Apenteng, who was in the meeting, said he thought 
some of the resolution required softening.  Kufuor was 
frustrated that neither Rwandan nor Ghanaian troops were 
being paid.  P/DAS and the President agreed that the U.S. and 
AU are on the same page on Sudan, stressing the need to apply 
continued pressure on Bashir. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Somalia:  Kufour and his Special Senior Advisor on 
the African Union Lt. General Seth Obeng indicated that Ghana 
was unable to contribute a full battalion to AMISOM but 
remained committed to providing 350 troops, who they said are 
already prepared to deploy with support from the 
international community.  The President agreed to draft a 
communique to the AU in this regard. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Cote de Ivoire:  P/DAS and President Kufuor both 
expressed satisfaction with the current state of peace in 
Cote de Ivoire.  They agreed the next important step is the 
voter registration exercise. (Note:  we heard reports that 
morning that there was an unsuccessful attack on Prime 
Minister Soro's plane. End note.) 
 
¶6.  (U)  Participants:  P/DAS was accompanied to the meeting 
by:  Pamela E. Bridgewater, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana; Cindy 
¶L. Courville, U.S. Ambassador to the Africa Union; Captain 
William S. Couch, Joint Task Force Horn of Africa; Jerry 
Lanier, Director, Office of Regional Security Affairs for 
Africa; Lauren Landis, Senior Representative on Sudan, Sudan 
Programs; and USAID/Ghana, Program Officer and AU Control 
Officer, Regina Dennis.  GOG participants included:  Special 
Advisor to the Chairman of the African Union, Nana Effah 
Apenteng; MFA Director of African Union Hanson Hall; and 
Special Senior Advisor to the AU Lt. General Seth Obeng.
