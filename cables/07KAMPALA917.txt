     ¶B. 2007 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) faction leader 
Ahmed Abdelshafi Toba returned to Uganda on May 26. On May 
27, P/E Chief met with Abdelshafi on May 27, who proudly 
showed off photographs of the Sudanese helicopter and pilot 
that his faction downed, and of meetings with U.S. and United 
Nations officials.  Abdelshafi supports efforts to bring the 
SLM together and prefers the facilitation of the Center for 
Humanitarian Dialogue (CHD).  He said he would prefer the 
meeting to be held in Kampala, but could accept Nairobi. 
(Note: Abdelwahid has strong ties to Nairobi.  End Note.) 
Members of Abdelshafi's faction are trying to put off San 
Egidio, which keeps calling them.  He is comfortable with 
Andrew Marshall and CHD.  He was not enthusiastic about the 
Sudan Peoples' Liberation Movement (SPLM) facilitation and 
Juba venue, but understands that it may be important to have 
SPLM involvement for strategic political reasons.  SPLM 
members had contacted him when he was in N'Djamena. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  According to Abdelshafi, many SLM commanders are 
ready to sit together and discuss uniting.  Since the Abuja 
talks, a number of commanders are  holding their home 
territories without any close factional affiliation. 
Abdelshafi is in contact with five of Abdelwahid's 
commanders, who disobeyed their boss to meet with him.  He 
said that the timing for a leadership conference with outside 
facilitation was good and would give a number of key leaders, 
such as Dr. Saleh, Ahmed Kubur, and Abdullah Yahiya, "a place 
to go."  According to Abdelshafi, once united, the SLM could 
discuss its views on the Darfur Peace Agreement.  Abdelshafi 
said that the African Union/United Nations and the U.S. 
needed to consider what to do about Minni Minnawi's position 
if the other SLM factions united.  He did not espouse any 
particular viewpoint on the issue, but said that Minni's role 
or relationship to the SLM dialogue and the DPA would need to 
be sorted out.
