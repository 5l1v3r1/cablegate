TRAINING MISSION IN IRAQ 
 
REF: USNATO 0054 
 
(SBU) Bulgaria will send four more trainers to take 
part in the NATO Training Mission - Iraq (NTM-I) 
bringing their total to five, the Intergovernmental 
Council for NATO Integration decided on February 2. 
Deputy Minister of Defense Ilko Dimitrov confirmed that 
if the Bulgarian Council of Ministers approves the 
decision as expected, the trainers could leave for 
Baghdad as soon as required by NATO.  However, due to a 
recent motion of no confidence in parliament, the 
Council of Ministers has not yet scheduled a vote on 
this decision. We will inform Washington when the 
trainers are approved.
