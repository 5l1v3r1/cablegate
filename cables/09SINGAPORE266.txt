REF: SECSTATE 24422 
 
(SBU) POLOFF strongly urged Singapore to attend, at the 
ministerial level, the March 31 "International Conference on 
Afghanistan" in the Netherlands (reftel) during a meeting 
with MFA Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia Assistant 
Director Stephen Lim March 20.  Lim said that MFA has not yet 
decided whether (and at what level) it will attend the 
conference, but that a decision will likely be made by early 
next week.  Lim noted that Foreign Minister Yeo will visit 
the United Kingdom March 23-25, although he was unaware how 
long the FM will remain in Europe.  Lim remarked that the GOS 
had also been approached by the United Kingdom, Canada, 
Australia and the Netherlands about attending this 
conference.
