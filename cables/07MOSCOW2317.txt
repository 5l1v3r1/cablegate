SUBJECT: RUSSIANS ALREADY DEMARCHING OSCE CAPITALS ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 62142 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On May 16 we delivered reftel demarche to Vladimir 
Andreyev, Deputy Director for the MFA's Department of New 
Challenges and Threats, regarding the proposal to conduct 
joint demarches to OSCE member states to solicit high-level 
participation in the May 31-June 1 Conference for 
Public-Private Partnership in Combating Counterterrorism. 
Andreyev told us that the GOR had on May 8 given instructions 
to their missions to deliver a similar demarche, and that 
most Russian missions had already completed the task.  He 
added that there was no need at this point to coordinate a 
simultaneous delivery.  He said the GOR agreed with the U.S. 
text, and that given the limited time before the conference, 
the U.S. should begin delivering the demarche. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Andreyev told us that the GOR's Rome Embassy had 
reported that the Italians were planning to send a low-level 
delegation to the conference, perhaps a member of their OSCE 
delegation in Vienna.  He noted the important role that Italy 
could play in fostering a public-private partnership in 
combating counterterrorism, and suggested both the U.S. and 
the GOR re-engage the Italians on the composition of their 
delegation.
