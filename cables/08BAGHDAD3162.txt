Home-Court Advantage 
-------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) The PRT played host to administrators, professors 
and students from Karbala University at an iftar (Ramadan 
fast-breaking meal) at sunset on Monday, September 15. 
Seventeen guests--including the Acting President, Vice 
President and the deans of several of the institution's eight 
faculties--attended.  The PRT's outreach to the university's 
7,000 students expects to raise awareness about the PRT, and 
inspire the province's best and brightest to assume the 
mantle of progress in a post-PRT Iraq. 
¶3. (SBU) Our guests only had a cursory understanding of the 
PRT's mission and were pleasantly surprised to learn of our 
activities and keen to enlist our support.  Three law 
professors and the PRT agreed on the need for improved 
commercial laws and legal training.  The professors elicited 
PRT support in identifying exchange programs and 
international seminars. 
¶4. (SBU) The History Department chairman seized on our 
explanation of QRF to request books, and the Dean of Science 
stressed his faculty's need for training and equipment.  The 
Media Section chief and an English professor were intrigued 
by the possibility of acquiring training in information 
technology and the prospect of TOEFL testing at the 
University.  The Dean of the Agricultural College voiced 
interest in the PRT's poultry-production project. 
Comment 
------- 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  Although western educated, our guests 
likened life in pre-liberation Iraq to being trapped in a 
time-warp and found the challenge of introducing modern 
pedagogical methods daunting.  By the iftar's end, the 
professors were excited about the prospect of working with 
the PRT to facilitate Karbala University's entry into the 
21st century.  The students are eager participants in Iraq's 
academic quest for world-class excellence.    End Comment.
