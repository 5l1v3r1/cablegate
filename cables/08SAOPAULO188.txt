¶1. 'Material Incentives' in Cuba 
Center-right  O Estado de S.Paulo (4/14) editorializes: "A 
resolution adopted in February [in Cuba] but only now made public 
establishes that a 'compaero' who is more productive than the other 
working the same job will receive a salary proportionally higher... 
. The intiative...was branded on state TV as ...an advance in the 
construction of socialism and not as the delayed acknowledgment of 
the key role competition and incentives play in the realm of 
production activities. ...President Ral Castro...[eliminated] the 
ban on the purchase of ...microwaves, DVD players, cell phones, air 
conditioning, toaster and...computers... . But freedom of speech and 
the right to vote on multi-party elections are still as much of a 
utopia in Cuba as Marx'vision of work and salary." 
 
¶2. Opening Cuba 
Liberal Folha de S.Paulo (4/13) says: "Although Cuba has overcome 
the worst part of the ruin that affected the country after the end 
of support it received from the Soviets in the early 90's, the 
situation is far from comfortable. The country...imports USD10.9 
billion a year and exports only USD3.3 billion. ...The remittances 
of dollars from Cuban-Americans to relatives who are in the island 
and the oil at prices subsidized by Chavez...help, but are not 
enough to cover the hole. It is, therefore, for survival that [Cuban 
President] Ral [Castro] deepens the Caribbean 'Perestroika...' 
There are also signs that the new leader flirts with a political 
depressurization, apparently, with the goal of easing tensions 
without changing the nature of the regime."
