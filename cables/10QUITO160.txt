¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  In a UNASUR summit meeting in Quito on February 
9, presidents and other representatives from member countries 
approved a $100 million UNASUR fund for Haiti and requested a $200 
million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank that would be 
repaid by UNASUR member states.  President Correa, in his role as 
interim president of UNASUR, called upon creditors to cancel 
external Haitian debt and on UNASUR member states to adopt special 
migratory procedures for Haitians and eliminate import duties on 
Haitian products.  These points were included in a joint statement 
issued following the meeting.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
SUMMIT MEETING 
 
 
 
¶2. (U)  In an emergency summit called by President Correa in his 
role as interim president of the Union of South American Nations 
(UNASUR), representatives met to coordinate humanitarian assistance 
from the region and design a mid- to long-term strategy for the 
physical, institutional and economic reconstruction of Haiti. 
Presidents from Colombia, Peru, Paraguay, Haiti and Ecuador 
attended the meeting, along with Bolivian Vice President Alvaro 
Garcia.  Venezuelan President Chavez apparently canceled his 
participation shortly before the meeting, and was represented by 
Foreign Minister Maduro.  The foreign ministers of Argentina, 
Suriname, and the Dominican Republic also participated, as did 
Brazilian President Lula's international affairs advisor and 
representatives from Guyana, Chile, and Uruguay.  In addition, OAS 
Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza and an Inter-American 
Development Bank representative reportedly attended the meeting. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U)  In his inaugural comments, President Correa said that 
UNASUR should support the reconstruction of Haitian infrastructure 
with human, physical and financial resources.  He called upon all 
creditors, in particular all multilateral organizations, to cancel 
all external Haitian debt, noting that it exceeded $1.3 billion. 
Correa also proposed that UNASUR member states study the 
possibility of supplying subsidized gas to Haiti, send a delegation 
composed of representatives of government planning entities, adopt 
special migratory regularization processes for Haitian citizens, 
temporarily eliminate import duties on Haitian products, and 
stimulate investment by South American companies with high 
potential for use of manual labor. 
 
 
 
¶4. (U)  Correa stressed that UNASUR should focus on South-South 
cooperation, saying that the immediate and massive assistance 
offered by more industrialized countries was not always the most 
effective.  He called development a "process of accompanying," but 
emphasized that it was necessary "to know how to accompany."  He 
said this process would be subject to the decisions of the Haitian 
public in the "framework of absolute respect of national 
sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention in internal 
affairs." 
 
 
 
¶5. (U)  UNASUR approved the formation of a $100 million fund for 
Haiti with the support of each member country, under a mechanism 
that is still to be defined.  In addition, the group asked the 
Inter-American Development Bank to invest $200 million in 
infrastructure, health and agricultural development, defined by 
Haitian President Preval as Haiti's greatest needs.  The loan would 
be paid by UNASUR member countries over a 20-year period. 
President Uribe stated that "we are ready to lend our help without 
any compensation."  President Garcia offered to donate $10 million 
for schools and potable water in the zones most affected by the 
tragedy.  At the close of the session, President Correa said that 
"a first conclusion is that (the assistance) should be through the 
Haitian government, strengthening state institutions." 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Prompted by the needs in Haiti, UNASUR members discussed 
the formation of a civil defense agency to coordinate civil defense 
matters.  President Correa suggested that this group be led by the 
South American Defense Council, but the Argentine representative 
thought that the Defense Council was not the appropriate venue for 
the proposed agency. 
 
 
 
JOINT STATEMENT 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Participating UNASUR members reportedly met in the 
afternoon to approve a joint statement summarizing the conclusions 
of the summit.  The joint statement without signatures was then 
posted on the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry website.  A 
non-Ecuadorian participant told the embassy that an initial draft 
of the joint statement included language that the U.S. would likely 
have found objectionable, but this language was excised early on. 
 
 
 
¶8.  (U)  The operative paragraphs of the joint statement focused on 
respect for Haitian sovereignty, continuation of bilateral aid, 
meeting Haiti's needs in its three stated priority areas, the 
UNASUR fund, and the Inter-American Bank credit (described above). 
They also mentioned cooperation in maritime and aerial transport of 
relief goods, supported the call of the UN Special Rapporteur on 
External Debt for debt forgiveness, stated that there would be a 
study of establishment of a UNASUR civil defense agency, and 
provided for delegates of the South American Defense Council to 
travel to Haiti, among other points.  The statement does not 
recognize any specific bilateral donors, only the work of MINUSTAH.

CORREA' CRITICISM OF WESTERN ASSISTANCE 
 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  Correa took advantage of a mid-afternoon joint public 
appearance with Haitian President Preval to expound a bit more on 
the importance of South-South assistance.  He criticized Western 
aid as "big at first, but then they forget you," alleging that the 
assistance goes through NGOs and the military and that the benefits 
accrue to those organizations. 
 
 
 
URIBE's VISIT 
 
 
 
¶10. (SBU)  The Ecuadorian press continued to play up the symbolic 
importance of Colombian President Uribe's attendance at the UNASUR 
meeting, saying that it represented a further step by Colombia in 
the process of rapprochement with Ecuador.  No bilateral meeting 
between Uribe and Correa was reported.  A group of protestors from 
the movement "DiablUma," which labels itself "a cultural/political 
(non-governmental) organization of the radical left," gathered in 
the square in front of the Presidential Palace to protest the 
arrival of Uribe.  The protestors denounced the GOC for the 
"Colombian tragedy of missing persons" and the March 2008 Colombian 
attack on a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia camp in northern 
Ecuador. 
 
¶11. (U) Minimize considered.
