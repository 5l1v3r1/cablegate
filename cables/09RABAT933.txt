REQUESTING MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (U) The Division of Legal Affairs of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (MFA) is responsible for 
granting authorization to conduct marine scientific research 
for foreign vessels.  The MFA has no formal written 
procedures or deadlines for requests.  However, Chief of the 
Division of Legal Affairs Abdelkarim Benselam told EconOff 
that the MFA prefers to receive requests in the form of a 
diplomatic note from the Embassy including the names of the 
persons and institutions requesting authorization, the 
technical details of the intended research, and the exact 
dates for the proposed activity.  The MFA will then consult 
with other agencies including the Ministry of Interior, the 
National Defense Administration, and the Department of 
Maritime Fisheries, before responding through the Embassy. 
Although the MFA does not set a minimum time for requests, 
Benselam stated that two to three months of advance notice is 
usually required to complete consultations and provide a 
clearance.
