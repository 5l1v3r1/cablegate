SUBJECT: UAE CENTRAL BANK STILL WILLING TO TRAIN IRAQ FIU 
 
REF: 06 ABU DHABI 4392 
 
¶1. (U) On June 21, 2007 OFAC Attache and Treasury 
Representative Erin English met with Abdulrahim Al Awadi, 
Head of the Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Cases Unit 
(AMLSCU), the financial intelligence unit (FIU) of the UAE 
Central Bank.  Mr. English, who was recently stationed in 
Baghdad, reported that the Iraqi FIU is still in its 
formative stages and in need of training.  Al Awadi 
reiterated (Reftel) that the UAE Central Bank has a firm 
commitment to support Iraq and will train the Iraqi FIU in 
the UAE, or Jordan.  The Central Bank would pay for 
accommodations and other costs associated with the training. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al Awadi also expressed concern that the Iraq FIU 
must be a unified institution and cannot be fragmented 
between Baghdad, Basra and Kurdistan.  The FIU cannot be a 
political institution and under Egmont rules there can only 
be one FIU per country.  Despite the Iraqi FIU not being an 
internationally recognized FIU, Al Awadi said the UAE was 
willing to informally take and respond to requests from the 
Iraqi FIU.
