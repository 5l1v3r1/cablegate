¶1. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"U.S. sways Iran to deal with Taliban" 
 
The official popular newspaper Beijing Youth Daily (Beijing 
Qingnianbao) (01/30): "Senior U.S. officials have recently extended 
an olive branch to Iran seeking cooperation on the situation in 
Afghanistan.  The two countries have common interests in containing 
Taliban forces in Afghanistan. Analysts believe that the possible 
cooperation is subject to a number of factors that make it difficult 
to realize.  The U.S.'s friendly gesture to Iran is closely related 
to the Afghanistan situation. U.S. Defense Secretary Gates takes the 
war in Afghanistan as the biggest military challenge for the U.S. 
military.  ...American analysts believe that even if Iran agrees to 
cooperate with the U.S., such cooperation will be based on Iran's 
own interests. Analysts also point out that President Obama is 
deliberately trying to change former President Bush's policies and 
adopt a new approach on Iran.  However, Obama will not be able to 
make substantial adjustments to Iran policy given U.S. strategic 
interests and limited cooperation with Iran." 
 
¶2. WEN JIABAO'S EUROPE TRIP 
 
"Wen Jiabao's visit to Europe conveys China's confidence to the 
world" 
 
The Beijing-based newspaper sponsored by official intellectual 
publication Guangming Daily and Guangdong Provincial official 
publication Nanfang Daily The Beijing News (Xin Jing Bao) (01/30): 
"The Premier's European trip has conveyed China's confidence to the 
world and China's opinion to restructure the world.  In the Davos 
Economic Forum, China has conveyed China's confidence to beat the 
global financial crisis.  China insists on 'first managing well its 
own economy.'  China's stance may have frustrated certain countries 
eager to seek money from China and sell goods to China. However, it 
is beneficial for slowing down the speed of financial crisis.  In 
mentioning China's opinion, Premier Wen stressed opposing trade 
protectionism, increasing developing countries' voices in 
international financial organizations and strengthening 
international financial supervision. In addition to China's 
confidence and opinion, Premier Wen has also had broad exchanges 
with various European leaders.  He has signed a series of 
cooperation documents.  This shows that China has started to 
actively promote a new global economic order and has tried to 
achieve a certain balance between its economic relations with Europe 
and its relations with the U.S.  The substance of the trip has 
transcended economic matters to include a political dimension."
