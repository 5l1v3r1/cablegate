Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C) Foreign Minister Norman Caldera has assured the 
Ambassador that the GON fully supports the EU-3 and USG 
positions on Iran and its nuclear program.  He promises to 
have the Nicaraguan delegation to the U.N. consult with their 
USG counterparts on any action that needs to be taken. 
During a meeting on January 20, Caldera also termed recent 
Iranian anti-Israel statements as, "beastly and 
unacceptable."  He reported that he had recently sent a note 
to the new Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, 
congratulating her on her appointment and voicing the hope 
that Nicaraguan-Israeli relations could return to their 
former high level, a reference to Nicaraguan disappointment 
at the GOI's support for Peru in the recent race for a 
non-permanent Latin American seat on the UNSC.  Caldera added 
that Nicaragua theoretically owes Iran some $300 million in 
old oil debt from the 1980s, so they may have to talk to Iran 
about the issue at some point.
