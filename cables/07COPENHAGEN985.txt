REF: SECSTATE 147667 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) MFA Security Policy Department UN Affairs Chief Kim 
Rosner Pedersen told us October 24 that Denmark is not able 
to supply the equipment requested in ref. Denmark does not 
have attack or utility helicopters (it currently has four of 
its eight Fennec helicopters in southern Iraq providing local 
reconnaissance support). Denmark has offered a C-130J 
capability for UNAMID for limited periods of up to 14 days 
(with specific windows still to be agreed upon) as well as an 
Air Movement Control Element (consisting of 9 persons) for 
the loading/offloading of aircraft and general cargo 
handling. Finally, Denmark has also offered maritime capacity 
for transport of UNAMID cargo for other troop contributors. 
Pedersen noted that Denmark is still consulting with DPKO 
regarding if, when, and how these assets might be accepted 
and used in theater.
