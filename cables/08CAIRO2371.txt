SUBJECT: REQUESTING DEPARTMENT ASSISTANCE TO RESTORE 
EGYPTIAN BLOGGER'S YOUTUBE ACCESS 
 
REF: A. CAIRO 2370 
     ¶B. DECEMBER 2007 CASTEEL-LEMPERT E-MAILS 
     ¶C. 07 CAIRO 3214 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request; please see para 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Prominent Egyptian blogger, human rights activist 
and winner of the 2007 Knight-Ridder International Journalism 
Award, Wael Abbas, contacted us November 17 to report that 
YouTube removed from his website two videos exposing police 
abuses -- one of Sinai bedouin allegedly shot by police and 
thrown in a garbage dump during the past week's violence (ref 
A), and the other of a woman being tortured in a police 
station.  Abbas told us that YouTube is also preventing him 
from posting new videos, and he asked us for assistance in 
urging YouTube to re-post his removed videos and reinstate 
his access to uploading new material.  Abbas said he has 
tried to contact Google, but has not received a response. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In December 2007, DRL and Embassy Cairo worked to 
convince Google to restore Abbas' YouTube access after a 
similar incident.  We believe that a similar Department 
intervention with Google representatives could help in 
restoring Abbas' access again.  Abbas is an influential 
blogger and human rights activist, and we want to do 
everything we can to assist him in exposing police abuse. 
Abbas' post of a video showing two policemen sodomizing a bus 
driver was used as the main evidence to convict the officers 
in November 2007 (ref C). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request:  We request that the Department 
please contact Pablo Chavez of Google to try to resolve this 
matter.  We have e-mailed Google contact information and the 
e-mail chain from the Department's December 2007 intervention 
to DRL/NESCA and NEA/ELA (ref B).
