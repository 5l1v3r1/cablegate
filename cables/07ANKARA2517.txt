GENOCIDE RESOLUTION AS IT MOVES TO THE HOUSE FLOOR 
 
REF: A. ANKARA 2500 
     ¶B. ANKARA 2509 
     ¶C. ANKARA 2510 
     ¶D. ANKARA 2504 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Initial GOT reaction to the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee (HFAC) October 10 decision to send 
Resolution 106 - the Armenian genocide resolution (AGR) - to 
the House floor reflects disappointment and anger, as well as 
appreciation for US Administration efforts and determination 
to continue to fight the measure in the full House.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U) PM Erdogan, in a CNN-Turk interview prior to the HFAC 
vote, recognized the scope of Administration efforts and the 
need to take a reasoned, long-term approach; the US was a 
democracy and no one could guarantee the outcome.  He noted 
that if it passed, the measure would serve only the Armenian 
diaspora, not the interests of the country of Armenia.  In 
the immediate aftermath of the HFAC vote, President Gul said, 
"Unfortunately, some politicians in the US turned a deaf ear 
to calls for common sense and once again attempted to 
sacrifice major issues for small domestic matters.  This is 
not a stance that befits the representatives of a major power 
such as the United States of America." 
 
¶3. (U) The MFA issued a formal statement in the name of the 
GOT, stating its regret and condemning the HFAC decision. 
"It is not possible to accept that the Turkish nation is 
accused of a crime it never committed."  The statement refers 
to HFAC action as "irresponsible," placing the strategic 
relationship on delicate, difficult footing, and adds that it 
is the job of historians, not legislative bodies, to evaluate 
history.  It notes the Turkish proposal to examine their 
history jointly with Armenians, which Armenia has not 
accepted.  It recognizes efforts by the highest levels of the 
US Administration to defeat the measure, and expresses 
determination to continue to combat it in the full House.  It 
concludes, "It is very clear that an historic responsibility 
falls on all members of the House of Representatives and 
especially on the Speaker of the House." 
 
¶4. (U) The print press carry the story in banner headlines. 
Some refer to the HFAC as bowing to the pressure of 
lobbyists, and sacrificing relations with an important ally 
in a troubled region for a few domestic votes.  As the 
country embarks on a 4-day post-Ramadan holiday, it is a lead 
story on television and radio. 
 
¶5. (U)  "Ask the Ambassador" on the Embassy's website has 
received 50 entries since the HFAC vote, with anger the 
predominant tone.  One said, "Shame on you.  You say you are 
our ally and you stab us in the back.  This is not humanity." 
  Another message from the central Anatolian city of Kayseri 
appeared 32 times; its gist:  "Don't consider Kayseri, a city 
that has been an engine of Turkish-US ties, as your future 
partner from now on."  A sheaf of 71 faxes of similar tone 
arrived in the Embassy's political section. 
 
¶6. (U)  The HFAC vote coincides with heightened public 
concern over the PKK terrorist threat, for which the US also 
receives public blame, due to PKK safe havens in northern 
Iraq.  In the wake of unusually high casualties over the past 
10 days and an October 9 GOT Counter-Terrorism Council 
meeting, PM Erdogan announced in measured tones during an 
October 10 CNN-Turk interview that his government would 
submit to parliament a motion authorizing a cross-border 
operation into Iraq.  He stressed that all such operations in 
the past have failed to achieve the desired results; 
conditions in the region must be considered as well.  He said 
he would use the November 3 Iraq Neighbors Ministerial in 
Istanbul to consult on the matter, as well as his upcoming 
Oval Office visit.  He stated that the authorization would be 
open-ended and valid for one year.

¶7. (SBU) As of 1300 local October 11, there has been no 
change that we can determine in the Turkish Armed Forces' 
security posture in southeastern Turkey, which continues at a 
high counter-terrorism ops tempo (ref C).  There was no 
unusual military activity reported in or around Silopi or at 
the Habur Gate road.  Commercial truck traffic from Turkey 
into Iraq was reported at normal levels, with 595 trucks 
crossing the border in the past 24 hours.  A visit by the 
local Turkish Special Forces commander for a meeting with his 
US counterpart inside Iraq was proceeding as planned on 
October 11.  However, Turkish Naval Forces Commander Admiral 
Atac canceled his participation in a US Chief of Naval 
Operations-sponsored international sea symposium. 
 
¶8. (U) The Mission's security situation appears stable. 
There were small demonstrations in Ankara, Istanbul and Adana 
October 10 prior to HFAC passage of the measures, as well as 
a small-scale follow-on demonstration in Ankara October 11. 
Police support was thorough and we expect it to continue. 
The long holiday weekend will temporarily lower our profile.
