SUBJECT: WFUNA COMPLAINT RE DENIAL OF VISA FOR CUBAN 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER/FORMER AMBASSADOR 
 
REF: A. USUN NEW YORK 00194

¶1. Action Request: Department's guidance is requested in 
replying to the World Federation of United Nations 
Associations (WFUNA)'s MarQ 27, 2008, letter to the U.S. 
Representative to the UN, Ambassador Khalilzad (text in 
paragraph 3 below). 
 
¶2. WFUNA has complained to Ambassador Khalilzad concerning 
the refusal of visas to two Cuban nationals who were expected 
to attend the organization's recent meeting in NYC.  One of 
the nationals, Carlos Amat-Fores, is a member of WFUNA's 
Executive Committee and is a retired Cuban Ambassador to the 
UN.  Prior to the refusal of the visas, the Cuba desk had 
asked USUN to confirm the dates of the WFUNA meeting. USUN 
contacted WFUNA, confirmed the dates and invitees, and 
relayed the information to the Cuba desk. Since the the visas 
were refused, USUN has received calls from WFUNA at various 
levels. In its letter WFUNA cites the visa denials as causing 
WFUNA to hold future meetings outside of US territory. 
 
¶3. WFUNA Exec.Committee Chairman Sen's March 27, 2008, letter 
to Ambassador Khalilzad 
 
Begin text-- 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
We would like to bring to your attention that Ambassador 
Carlos Amat-Fores, a long standing member of the Executive 
Committee of the World Federation of United Nations 
Associations (WFUNA), has been refused a visa to enter the 
United States.  He was expected to participate in our 
Executive Committee Meeting being held at the UN premises in 
New York, on the 28-29 March 2008. 
 
All members of the Executive Committee join with me in 
expressing our disappointment in the strongest possible 
terms.  WFUNA's membership deems it unacceptable that a 
widely respected member of WFUNA's Executive Committee be 
refused clearance to participate in such a vital meeting for 
the program of work for the organization. 
 
Carlos Amat-Fores, a retired Ambassador of Cuba to the UN, 
has been an active and invaluable member of WFUNA's Executive 
Committee since 2003 and was reelected to the Committee, at 
the 38th Plenary Assembly in Buenos Aires, in 2006. 
Ambassador Carlos Amat-Fores has participated actively in all 
WFUNA's Executive Committee meetings held outside US 
territory and was able to participate in WFUNA's Executive 
Committee meetings held in the United States in the past. 
 
A people's movement for the United Nations, founded in 1946 
and currently counting over 100 members worldwide, WFUNA 
works to make the United Nations more relevant and valuable 
in the lives of people across the globe.  To reach its 
objectives, WFUNA draws on the expertise of UN, Member States 
and Civil Society's key players from all regions of the 
world.  The contribution of Ambassador Carlos Amat-Fores, an 
experienced and knowledgeable diplomat, has been crucial to 
the work of our organization. 
 
Since WFUNA operates on the principles of inclusiveness and 
openness, the Executive Committee regrettably decided that 
future meetings will have to be held outside of US territory, 
unless we receive firm reassurances that all of our members 
are granted entry to the United States. 
 
Please accept our highest considerations, 
 
Mr. Pang Sen 
Chairman of the Executive Committee 
World Federation of the United Nations Associations
