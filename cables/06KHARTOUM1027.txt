Numbers, Wants Border Settled 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to Under Secretary for Finance Isaac 
Makur Ater, the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) 
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning now believes 
that the federal Government of national Unity (GNU) 
Ministry of Finance and National Economy is providing the 
true numbers regarding oil production.  The South still 
claims it is owed another USD 200 million from 2005, 
largely from the oil stabilization fund, but this is due 
to a technical correction and not any disagreement over 
the raw numbers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ater, who is also the ranking SPLM 
representative on the Joint Technical Committee of the 
National Petroleum Commission, feels the biggest problem 
now is that the GNU is refusing to release any revenues 
from wells near the border until the border commission 
completes its work.  That means the south is only getting 
 
 
 
revenue from two oil wells around Bentiu. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The GoSS is currently trying to collecting 
revenues from some oil wells that have just come online 
near the border in Upper Nile State, but these revenues 
may be held as well even though the border in that area 
was never in dispute.  Because the Abyei Boundaries 
Commission report has yet to be implemented, the GNU is 
also holding all revenues from that area.
