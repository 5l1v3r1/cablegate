¶1.  (SBU) "The situation in Darfur cannot be prolonged," 
responded MFA Director for Exterior Politics Javier Bonagas 
to DCM's delivery of reftel demarche.  Bonagas acknowledged 
the Government of Sudan's history of reneging on its 
agreements and underscored the urgent need for the 
international community to clamp down on the incessant 
violence plaguing the region.  Drawing a comparison to a 
forthcoming UNSCR on Kosovo independence, Bonagas stated his 
opinion that the crisis in Darfur is a matter that demands 
immediate UNSC attention, whereas a UNSCR aimed at conceiving 
an independent Kosovo should not be viewed with the same 
urgency as a current and ongoing genocidal crisis. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Bonagas's view that Kosovo is not as 
urgent as Sudan may be a staff level trial balloon since it 
was volunteered when we demarched them on Sudan.  This same 
argument was repeated by MFA Senior Advisor Nils Castro 
during a subsequent conversation with POLOFF.  We note that 
both officials made those comments while FM Lewis Navarro was 
in Europe on his way to Moscow.  Our suggested strategy of 
keeping the pressure on the GOP at senior level still stands.
