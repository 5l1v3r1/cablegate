REF:  SECSTATE 47658 
 
¶1. (SBU)  US Office Pristina warmly welcomes and grants country 
clearance to Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, Special Representative of the 
Department of State for Kosovo Final Status Issues, and his 
assistant, Patrick Hanish, to visit Pristina April 26 - April 27, 
¶2007.  The purpose of the visit is for consultations on issues 
related to Kosovo final status. Control Officer for this visit will 
be Political/Economic Chief Tom Yazdgerdi, who can be reached at: 
office 381-38-5959-3146; GSM 377-44-501-750; fax 381-38-549-890. 
 
¶2. (U) Post will coordinate arrangements for airport pick up. Post 
will also make arrangements for transportation for official meetings 
during the visit. COM has extended home hospitality to Ambassador 
Wisner.  Mr. Hanish will be housed in TDY quarters on the USOP 
compound.  Notional schedule of meetings to follow shortly. 
 
¶3. (U) Kosovo is a cash (Euro) economy.  There are a few operating 
ATMs. A few large stores and some hotels take credit cards.  Not all 
ATMS are reliable and personnel should use normal ATM safety 
precautions.  TDY personnel should bring sufficient cash or 
travelers' checks to cover all hotel and other incidental expenses 
and may exchange dollars for Euros from 9:00am-11:30am and 
1:00pm-3:30pm each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday and 
9:00am-11:30am each Thursday at the U.S. Office cashier.  Only USOP 
accepts travelers' checks.   Reverse accommodation is available at 
the end of the visit. 
 
¶4. (U) Security issues:  The security situation in Kosovo is fluid and 
there is still risk from occasional episodes of violence; incidents 
of ethnic violence continue to occur.  Land mines remain in some 
outlying areas.  Civil society institutions generally do not yet 
meet Western standards.  There is criminal activity against 
internationals, including purse snatching and residential break-ins 
and general precautions are recommended.  KFOR is deployed 
throughout Kosovo.  Electronic devices such as laptops (personal or 
official), PDA cell phones with cameras, and the like must be 
approved for use in USOP facilities by an ISSO in consultation with 
the RSO. 
 
¶5. (U) Travel to certain areas within Kosovo province requires fully 
armored vehicles and advance RSO approval.  To facilitate planning, 
please provide travel itinerary to USOP in advance of arrival, as 
same-day travel can be difficult to arrange.  To provide appropriate 
access to USOP facilities, visitors must ensure all necessary 
security clearances are included with travel messages. 
 
¶6. (U) Please ensure ASEC tags are included to ensure proper 
distribution.  Specific questions regarding security may be 
addressed to USOP's RSO or your control officer.
