(SBU) On June 29, PolOff followed-up on June 20 demarche 
(reftel B), and delivered reftel A talking points on UN Human 
Rights Commission (CHR) reform to MFA International 
Organizations Human Rights Officer Janio Tunion.  On July 5, 
Tunion told PolOff that the GOP's position on UNCHR reform 
and the creation of a Human Rights Council was similar to 
that of the USG.  GOP supports a Human Rights Council of 25 
members, distributed equally among the five geographic 
regions.  Tunion also said that the UNCHR sub-commission 
should be much smaller.  Tunion had been in contact with the 
GOP PermRep in New York, and said that the GOP understood it 
would have to negotiate on its position.  Embassy will report 
any updates to the Department.
