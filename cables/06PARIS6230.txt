Nominating Justification: Chief Editor of a monthly economic 
publication for hotel and restaurant managers and food 
industry professionals, Nadia Aubin-Mougin is also the 
President of the Strasbourg Press Club - with 600 members, 
the largest press club in France. She was born in Algeria, 
where she studied Political Science (twice top of her class) 
and came to France at the age of 24, having fought hard and 
successfully to obtain a scholarship to complete her studies 
at the University of Grenoble.  During her studies in France 
she took up various jobs in order to be able to support 
herself, with the clear goal of advancing in her career while 
also improving the society around her.  Although she has 
never traveled to the United States, Nadia Aubin-Mougin is 
one of our most supportive advocates with the various 
audiences she reaches.  These audiences include not only 
those journalists gathered together through the numerous 
activities organized by the Strasbourg Press Club, but also 
through her active involvement in the many debates for which 
she is often invited to act as moderator.  Topics range from 
literary colloquiums and scientific research to the 
integration of minorities into the French educational system 
and labor force, employment and professional training for 
women, and corporate sponsorship.  When French journalists 
Florence Aubenas and Hussein Hanoun were hostages in Iraq, 
Nadia Aubin-Mougin was actively involved with "Reporters sans 
Frontieres" (Reporters without Borders) and participated as a 
speaker in debates on practices of the French press in crisis 
situations and on the role of women in the French media. For 
the last six years, she has often been approached by regional 
and national political leaders (both from right and left) to 
be more actively involved in politics. 
We believe Mrs. Aubin-Mougin is the ideal candidate for this 
program, which seems tailored for her needs in terms of 
substantive content and exposure to those aspects of U.S. 
society that will enrich her bank of knowledge and make her 
an even more effective third-party endorser.  She is already 
a person of influence, a bright woman with an engaging 
personality and strong character, and has demonstrated that 
she will go far and her influence will only grow. 
The timing of this program, in the middle of major regional 
and national electoral races in France, would enable her to 
share what she learned about the US at a time when there will 
be increased focus on many of the issues she will have 
learned about in the U.S. Nadia Aubin-Mougin has also 
confessed to us that her dream was to become an active member 
of a think tank from where she could observe what is 
published in the Muslim press and analyze its impact over the 
local populations - as deeply rooted in the Arab culture, she 
has a strong sense of how Muslim populations react to what is 
said by Western leaders. Her influence could greatly 
contribute to developing greater understanding of our 
policies and improving our image in France, particularly 
among minority communities.
