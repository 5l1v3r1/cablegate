SUBJECT: CAMBODIA PARTICIPATION IN WHALING COMMISSION 
MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 90067 
 
¶1.  On June 5, Nao Thuok, Director General of the Department 
of Fisheries within the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, 
and Fisheries, told Poleconoff that Por Try, Secretary of 
State, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, has 
been named as Cambodia's whaling commissioner.  However, Nao 
Thuok, who is the alternate commissioner, will attend this 
year's Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission. 
 
¶2.  Nao Thuok indicated that the Ministry had just begun 
preparations for the meeting.  He hoped that Cambodia's dues 
would be paid in time for it to vote, but was unable to 
confirm this.  Nao Thuok indicated that Cambodia has not yet 
reached a decision about how to vote at the meeting, and will 
weigh the scientific evidence presented at the conference. 
However, Joe Walston, Director of Wildlife Conservation 
Society, told Poleconoff that Cambodia typically sides with 
Japan on whaling issues and that he expects Cambodia to vote 
with the pro-whaling faction at this meeting.
