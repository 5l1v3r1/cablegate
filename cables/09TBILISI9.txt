¶1. (U) Dutch Ambassador Onno Elderenbosch and Poloff 
delivered reftel demarche to Deputy Foreign Minister 
Alexander Nalbandov on December 31 per reftel instructions. 
Given the lack of diplomatic relations with Russia following 
the August conflict, the Russian Embassy did not participate

delivered a note verbale to Nalbandov from the Embassy of the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands.  Below is the text of the note.
