REF: SECSTATE 48487 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Emboff delivered reftel demarche to Natasa Furlan, 
counselor in the MFA's Latin American section, on May 18. 
Furlan noted that Slovenia's position remains has not changed 
from 2008, and Slovenia will continue to emphasize the EU 
"doubletrack" policy.  Embassy provides the following in 
response to reftel questions: 
 
-- Slovenia has worked to promote democracy and human rights 
in Cuba. 
 
-- There have been no recent high-level visits. 
 
-- Slovenia's economic relationship with Cuba is minimal, 
with less than 130,000 euros of trade in 2008, mainly in 
tourism.  Slovenia is also waiting for Cuba to repay 
approximately $40 million of debt incurred in the 1990s. 
 
-- There is no bilateral trade agreement between the two 
countries. 
 
-- There are no exchange programs between Slovenia and Cuba.
