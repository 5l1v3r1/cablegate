SUBJECT: SOMALIA - VOA Somali Service Banned in Puntland 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On the evening of October 1, the regional 
Government of Puntland, in two separate edicts, banned FM radio 
stations in Puntland from carrying Voice of America's (VOA) Somali 
Service and banned journalists from carrying out their work for VOA. 
 The suspension remains in effect as of mid-day October 6.  Post is 
engaged with the Government of Puntland in an effort to reverse the 
suspension.  End summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Motives for Suspension 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 1, the Government of Puntland's Minister of 
Security, Dr. Abdullahi Si'id Samata, ordered all FM stations to 
cease broadcasting Voice of America's (VOA) Somali Service programs. 
 The letter, an informal translation of which Post forwarded to AF 
and VOA, further stated that "To ensure adherence to this order, the 
security agents and regional heads are being instructed to ensure 
full compliance."  The letter claimed that on August 29, VOA had 
falsely alleged that some Somali politicians were detained in 
Galkacyo, which the Minister said was "purely untrue." "The 
intention [of the VOA report] was to destabilize the security of 
Puntland ...," the Minister continued.  The letter also cited a 
September 30 report claiming that the moderate Islamic group Ahlu 
Sunna wal Jama'a (ASWJ) had set up an office in Garowe, which the 
Government of Puntland apparently found objectionable. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On the same day, the Deputy Minister of Information, 
Abdishakur Mire Adan, issued a letter banning three reporters -Nuuh 
Muse Birjeeb, Mohamed Yasin Isak, and Abdikadir Mohamed Nunow- from 
reporting for VOA in Puntland.  The letter further stated that "This 
order will also affect anyone else attempting to do reporting for 
VOA within Puntland Region." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post registered directly with the Office of the President 
of Puntland our concern about the closure. Late in the evening of 
October 5, the Government of Puntland e-mailed a letter (forwarded 
to AF) stating that the suspension was due to VOA reporters having 
"violated [the] code of conduct of news broadcasting in Puntland by 
selectively interviewing anti-law-and-order individuals and 
politically motivated elements ..."

Reactions 
--------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the National 
Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), and Reporters Without Borders 
issued statements condemning the closure.  All cited the threat to 
freedom of the press, with no specific focus on VOA as a U.S. 
government-supported media outlet.  The owner of one of VOA Somali 
Service's FM partners condemned the Puntland Administration's 
decision, but stated that he had no choice but to comply, fearing 
that his equipment and station would be destroyed in retaliation for 
continuing to broadcast VOA. The same station is filling the time 
formerly used to broadcast VOA with debates about freedom of the 
press and discussions about the motives of this action against VOA. 
For its part, VOA issued a statement on October 5 condemning the 
closure.

Post Response 
------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) At the request of VOA, the Somalia Unit has made no public 
statement to date.  However, we have registered our concern with the 
Puntland Administration.  In an October 5 meeting with Somalia Unit, 
Puntland's Minister for Women said she was encouraging President 
"Faroole" not to permanently close VOA, but she insisted that the 
ban was necessary to show VOA that it should not report on 
"unhelpful and dangerous things."  In an October 6 conversation, 
President "Faroole's" Chief of Staff insisted that the banned VOA 
reporters were "not professional," and that their broadcasts were 
filled with inaccuracies.  He hoped that VOA would replace the 
ousted reporters with staff that were less "linked to their clan," 
and that VOA would be "more impartial" in the future.  We asked that 
our concerns over the ban be passed to President "Faroole," and 
underlined the importance the USG attaches to freedom of the press. 
We requested that "Faroole," who could not be reached by telephone 
on October 6, be available for a telephone call on October 7.
