¶1. (SBU) On December 4, DCM delivered ref a points on USG 
climate change objectives to Spanish Secretary General 
(Vice-Minister) of the Environment Arturo Aizpiri.  Aizpiri 
said he was optimistic about the prospects for progress in 
Bali.  Spain,s objective was the EU one of setting a 
negotiating schedule that would lead to an agreement by the 
2009 Copenhagen summit on a post-2012 regime.  He did not 
know how much progress would be possible at Bali on the 
parameters of such an agreement, but he hoped delegates could 
settle on a range of necessary emissions cuts.  He said Spain 
hoped that the existing UNFCCC process and the Kyoto ad hoc 
working group process could come together. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to the DCM,s extensive review of the 
Major Economies Meeting (MEM) process, Aizpiri noted again 
Spain,s disappointment at not having been included in the 
process (ref b).  He said that if the USG envisioned 
continuing the process after the second meeting, Spain felt 
that it should participate.  He welcomed the USG position 
that the MEM process should contribute to reaching a global 
agreement under the UNFCCC and expressed interest in 
receiving details on how this would work.  He said that 
initiatives such as the MEM could be useful if they were 
coordinated with and contributed to the UNFCCC process, but 
if they did not, they risked damaging the coherence of the 
global effort. 
 
¶3. (U) Aizpiri emphasized several times that progress on 
climate change would depend to a significant degree on U.S. 
and EU leadership, and he repeated his desire to work with 
the U.S. constructively at Bali and beyond.  He admitted that 
the EU alone could not convince China and India to 
participate and that U.S. involvement was necessary for this 
reason as well.  He noted the many developments that have 
taken place in the last year in the U.S. and around the 
world.  He cited as an upcoming milestone the European 
Commission,s expected January 23 proposal for 2020 emissions 
and renewable fuels targets for EU member countries, which he 
said would allow the EU to meet its goals of a 20 percent 
reduction in CO2 emissions and of use of renewable fuels for 
20 percent of the EU,s energy consumption. 
 
¶4. (U) Separately, Aizpiri conveyed Environment Minister 
Cristina Narbona,s thanks for USG actions in helping reach 
agreement in New York the previous week on the budget of the 
UN Convention to Combat Desertification.  He also repeated 
his interest in participating in the February 11-14 Spanish 
renewable energy mission to Washington and Colorado that post 
is helping organize.
