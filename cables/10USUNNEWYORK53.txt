¶1.  This is an action request, see paragraph 7. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Summary:  On January 25, the French mission held an 
informal meeting with Security Council experts and a 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) team prior to 
its January 26 trip to Chad to discuss the Government of 
Chad's (GoC) objections to MINURCAT's mandate renewal.  The 
only delegations that spoke were Japan, Austria, France and 
the U.S., and the general atmosphere was one of inertia. 
DPKO indicated that it did not have a clear understanding of 
the extent to which the Council supported extending the 
MINURCAT mandate, a critical fact necessary before going into 
negotiations.  The French will call an additional meeting to 
discuss with DPKO its findings when the team returns from 
Chad.  USUN requests Department guidance on MINURCAT renewal 
prior to this meeting, and suggests that, if a decision is 
made to advocate for renewal, the Department consider 
demarching other key Council Members to urge their support. 
End Summary. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In a January 25 meeting with Security Council 
experts, DPKO briefly outlined the regional implications of 
an early withdrawal of the UN Mission in Chad and the Central 
African Republic (MINURCAT).  Noting that 2010-11 would be a 
sensitive period with elections in Chad, Sudan and CAR, DPKO 
said that a precipitous withdrawal could adversely impact 
regional security.  DPKO stated that if MINURCAT withdrew 
from Chad, training and mentoring of the Detachment Integre 
de Securite (DIS) could not be carried out by the remaining 
UN country team.  DPKO also indicated that contributors would 
be much less likely to provide resources to the Trust Fund 
that facilitates DIS training, and the GoC would need to 
provide this funding.  DPKO said that there were redlines the 
Secretariat would not be prepared to cross in negotiations, 
noting that the projected MINURCAT force level was already at 
the bare minimum necessary for effective peacekeeping 
operations. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A representative from the Office of the Coordinator 
for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) stated that the sources of 
displacement in Chad and in Darfur had not changed, nor were 
they likely to change in the next twelve months.  The OCHA 
rep stressed that humanitarian services are still needed. 
With the GOC's capacity to provide law and order being quite 
weak, OCHA expressed concern that MINURCAT's withdrawal would 
result in increased banditry, lawlessness and reduced 
mobility for humanitarian actors.  OCHA noted that MINURCAT 
had provided 19,000 patrols and 5,000 escorts and was a key 
logistical partner for humanitarians.  OCHA stated that the 
MINURCAT presence had allowed approximately 3,000 
humanitarians to provide services to 600,000 refugees and 
displaced persons.  OCHA also stressed the subregional 
implications of MINURCAT's withdrawal, noting that the 
mission had worked closely with the UN Mission in Darfur 
(UNAMID). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In the brief discussion with SC experts that 
followed, Japan requested that DPKO share its redlines with 
the Council before the UN began negotiating with Chad. 
France indicated that President Deby had informally requested 
all MINURCAT troops to be withdrawn by April 30, 2010. 
Austria asked about progress in obtaining a replacement for 
the Norwegian Level II hospital, and DPKO responded that a 
replacement had not yet been found.  The U.S. requested DPKO 
to assess the extent to which the GoC would be able to take 
over the responsibilities of MINURCAT with respect to 
providing a stable and secure environment that would allow 
provision of humanitarian assistance to the 600,000 refugees 
and internally displaced persons in Chad. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In a private side-conversation, the Chinese expert 
indicated to poloff that the GoC had approached China to 
support its position advocating for withdrawal of MINURCAT 
troops by April 30, but the Chinese have not yet decided 
whether they will support the Chadian request.  The DPKO 
expert also privately indicated to poloff that the French did 
not appear to be interested in strongly advocating for an 
extension of the MINURCAT mandate.  (Comment:  USUN suggests 
that if the U.S. position is to support renewal of the 
MINURCAT mandate, the Department might want to consider 
demarching key Council Members in capitals.  End Comment.) 
 
¶7.  Action Request:  USUN requests guidance from the 
Department on the U.S. position regarding the MINURCAT 
mandate renewal.
