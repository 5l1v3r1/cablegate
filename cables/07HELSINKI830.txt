Â¶1. (C) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on to Anssi Leino, 
Counselor for Iran in the Finnish MFA's Unit for the Middle 
East and North Africa.  Citing the IAEA's Work Plan as the 
only positive sign on Iran's nuclear program in years, Leino 
said Finland strongly supports EU and U.S. demands that Iran 
strictly comply with the complete Work Plan.  Leino stressed 
that the U.S. and the EU must show strong international unity 
when facing Iran, especially to shore-up support from other 
members of the UN Security Council.  Leino said Finnish and 
EU officials, at the highest levels, continually discuss 
Iranian compliance with IAEA directives and UN Security 
Council resolutions in all bilateral and multilateral meeting 
with key governments including China and Russia.  Leino 
believes it is only a matter of time before the UN Security 
Council will have to issue additional sanctions to force Iran 
to meet its nuclear program obligations.
