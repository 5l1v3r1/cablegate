SUBJECT: LUXEMBOURG'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1.  (U) The Ministry of Defense recently provided the Embassy 
with updated facts and figures concerning Luxembourg's total 
contributions to Afghanistan's security and development.  The 
information included military as well as developmental 
assistance. 
 
¶2.  (U) Regarding military assistance, since 2003, Luxembourg 
has supported ISAF through the consistent deployment of nine 
personnel for four-month tours.  A total of 12 detachments 
have deployed thus far.  These personnel are assigned to the 
Belgian Force Protection Company with the mission of 
protecting Kabul International Airport as well as VIP escorts 
to and from the airport.  Additionally, in the July 2004 to 
January 2005 time frame, one officer and one NCO were 
deployed with the European Corps headquarters to man the 
headquarters of ISAF VI. 
 
¶3.  (U) On the development front, Luxembourg has provided a 
total of 19.5 million EUR (25.5 million USD) in bilateral 
development assistance since 2000 as well as an additional 
1.41 million EUR (1.85 million USD) in assistance through 
NATO and the UN.  This includes, most notably, 1 million EUR 
for the ANA equipment trust fund for the acquisition of 
passive security equipment (i.e. helmets and body armor) and 
200,000 EUR for the Partnership for Peace trust fund for the 
physical security and stockpiling of ammunition in 
Afghanistan.  In 2006, Luxembourg donated over 200,000 EUR to 
the NATO-Russia Council pilot project on counternarcotics 
training for Afghan and Central Asian personnel. 
 
¶4.  (U) Much of Luxembourg's development assistance has been 
targeted at women's issues including maternal health; food 
security in remote areas; humanitarian projects through NGOs 
such as Caritas and Handicap International; election support; 
and institution building.  In coming years, the GOL plans to 
spend about 100,000 EUR annually to support infrastructure 
development at the Kabul Military High School.
