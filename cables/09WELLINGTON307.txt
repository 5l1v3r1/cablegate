SUBJECT: REQUESTING ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN - NEW 
ZEALAND 
 
REF: 09 STATE 120807 
 
DERIVED FROM: Derived from previous message. 
 
¶1.  (S) On November 27, the Charge delivered reftel demarche to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) Deputy Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs (Under Secretary equivalent) for the Middle East 
and Africa Peter Hamilton.  Drawing heavily on points provided in 
reftel, the Charge noted that President Obama would be making an 
announcement sometime close to the December 3-4 NATO Foreign 
Ministerial Meeting in Brussels on U.S. plans for the way forward 
in Afghanistan and Pakistan and that the USG hoped that the 
Government of New Zealand (GNZ) would be able to provide strong 
public support in the days following the announcement and 
additional troop and training contributions in the longer term. 
 
 
 
¶2. (S) Hamilton said the GNZ had been "expecting something like 
this (the U.S. request)" for some time and would prepare a 
statement of support for public release immediately after it had a 
chance to hear and analyze the President's announcement.   Hamilton 
stressed, however, that a substantive response to the request for 
additional contributions would "take a little longer" because "in 
our system such a request must be the subject of a joint cabinet 
meeting."   He noted that there was only one more joint cabinet 
meeting scheduled to take place before the holiday recess begins on 
December 22. 
 
 
 
¶3. (S) Hamilton said that he would forward our talking points to 
Foreign Minister Murray McCully for his review within 24 hours. 
McCully is currently in Trinidad attending a Commonwealth 
conference and is scheduled to travel from there to Vienna and then 
onward to Brussels for the December 3-4 NATO Foreign Ministerial 
Meeting.   Hamilton added that he would brief the NZ Ministry of 
Defense on our meeting and the request for additional 
contributions. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Stephen Harris, Deputy Director, Middle East and Africa 
Division, and Eamonn O'Shaughnessy, Senior Policy Officer, Security 
and Disarmament Division also participated in the meeting, while 
the Charge was accompanied by the Political/Economic Counselor and 
the Economic Officer.
