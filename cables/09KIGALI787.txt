SUBJECT: RWANDA IMPROVES RANKING IN CORRUPTION PERCEPTION 
 
¶1. (U) A November 17 report released by Transparency 
International (TI) ranks Rwanda 89th out of 180 countries 
surveyed in its 2009 Corruption Perception Index.  Last year, 
TI ranked Rwanda 102 out of 180 countries.  The new ranking 
places Rwanda as the "least corrupt" in East Africa and among 
the top ten performers on the continent.  Rwanda scored 3.3 
out of a possible 10 points, compared to last years score of 
3.0.  By comparison, Tanzania scored 2.6, Kenya and Uganda 
scored 2.5 and Burundi scored 1.8. 
 
¶2. (U) Executive Secretary of TI/Rwanda Apollinaire Mugiganyi 
told the press November 18 that Rwanda has improved in the 
rankings for the last three years moving from a score of 2.8 
in 2007 to 3.3 in 2009.  He added, "Rwanda is doing a better 
job in fighting corruption than most African countries."
