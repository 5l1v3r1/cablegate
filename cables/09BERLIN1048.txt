REF: STATE 81983 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, we examined whether the work of the 
proposed National Science Foundation (NSF) grant would have 
adverse implications on U.S. foreign policy.  From our review 
of the backgrounds and the work of the proposed 
organizations, we assess that there are no adverse 
implications for U.S. foreign policy with the proposed 
research grant. 
 
¶2. (U) In our review, EconOff researched the background, 
mission, and international partnerships of the three 
organizations involved in the proposed project: the 
International Human Dimensions Program on Global 
Environmental Change (IHDP--and its parent organizations), 
the International Council for Science (ICSU), and the 
International Social Science Council (ISSC).  EconOff also 
reviewed the outcomes from the April 2009 IHDP meeting in 
Bonn.
