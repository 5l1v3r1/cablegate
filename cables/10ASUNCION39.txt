CLASSIFIED BY: Perry Holloway, DCM; REASON: 1.4(B), (C), (D) 
 
¶1.       (U) The Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) released wealthy 
cattle rancher Fidel Zavala Serrati January 18 after 94 days in 
captivity.  EPP members seized Zavala at gunpoint from his rural 
ranch October 15 (reftel C).  To comply with the EPP's three 
pre-release demands, the Zavala family paid a ransom of USD 
550,000, distributed meat to poor communities (reftel A), and urged 
government security forces to abandon their rescue efforts.  The 
Paraguayan government pledged to capture the perpetrators. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (C) While the Zavala family maintained discrete contact 
with elements of the Paraguayan government during the crisis, they 
did not overtly cooperate with the Paraguayan National Police, and 
publically opposed government intervention.  The family worked 
closely with Columbian government anti-kidnapping experts brought 
to Paraguay by President Fernando Lugo's government.  Interior 
Minister Rafael Filizzola mobilized elite forces at his disposal 
for two security operations designed to capture EPP members.  The 
GOP brought Brazilian technical teams to Paraguay to intercept 
telephone calls between the EPP and the Zavala family, and to 
triangulate radio signals to determine the kidnappers' locations. 
 
 
 
¶3.       (U) Lugo and Filizzola held a press conference near 
midnight January 18 to praise Zavala's release and announce 
immediate actions to apprehend those responsible for the 
kidnapping.  Lugo proclaimed "this government is not going to rest 
until security has been returned to the people."  The public and 
most politicians overwhelmingly praised the outcome and 
congratulated the government. 
 
 
 
¶4.       (C) COMMENT:  Zavala's successful release provides an 
immediate boost to the beleaguered Lugo administration.  Lugo's 
ability to work well with the Colombians and Brazilians also 
highlights successful international cooperation.  If the Interior 
Ministry is able to follow-through on promises to apprehend EPP 
kidnappers in the coming weeks, the Lugo administration may find an 
opportunity to focus on advancing its agenda after months of bad 
press, no major achievements, and calls for Lugo's impeachment. 
END COMMENT.
