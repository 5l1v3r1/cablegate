(SBU)  On receipt of ref a), Embassy again contacted MFA 
A/S-equivalent for Human Rights Bert Theuermann, who has 
responsibility for this portfolio.  Theuermann said he had 
received no updates on the state of play in Geneva in the 
last 24 hours.  However, he said he could positively confirm 
that if the Third Additional Protocol came to a vote, Austria 
would vote yes.
