DECISION 
 
REF: VANCOUVER 1674 
 
(SBU)  In a terse Dec. 16 conversation with CG, Quebec Forest 
Industry Council Director for International Trade Marc Boutin 
said the outcome of the Department of Commerce's review of the 
AC/CVD orders on softwood lumber was a "bad surprise" and that 
Quebec industry was "extremely disappointed."  Boutin said it 
was clear that the Commerce review began with a "result in 
search of a methodology."  The methodology made no sense and was 
not legal, he charged.  The fact that the review was less severe 
toward Quebec than other provinces did nothing to change 
Quebec's discontent, he concluded.
