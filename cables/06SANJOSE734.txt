REF: STATE 50811 
 
Classified By: DCM Russell Frisbie for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) On April 3, Polcouns delivered reftel demarche to the 
MFA's Director General for Foreign Policy, Jose Joaquin 
Chaverri, emphasizing the importance of controlling the trade 
in WMD and missile-related materials and noting that 
endorsement of PSI was a statement of political support and 
did not entail any legal or operational obligations. 
 
¶2.  (C) Chaverri, along with Deputy Director for Multilateral 
Affairs Carlos Cordero, indicated sympathy for the initiative 
but noted that decisions on such matters either were being 
taken in consultation with the incoming government, which 
takes office on May 8, or were being postponed until after 
inauguration.  He could not say when we could expect a 
decision on PSI. 
 
¶3.  (C) Polcouns stressed the urgency of a decision given the 
upcoming anniversary of the initiative and our hope that 
Costa Rica would participate in the senior-level political 
meeting in June.
