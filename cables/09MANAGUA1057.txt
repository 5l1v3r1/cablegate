¶1. (C) Summary: On October 29, members of the governing FSLN (some with ties to the Leon City Hall) beat, briefly kidnapped, and interrogated youth who were publicly displaying their opposition to the Supreme Court's (CSJ) ruling allowing President Daniel Ortega's re-election. This was done with at least the knowledge of Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) officers. This marks an escalation in the governing-FSLN's tactics against those they see as opposition to Ortega and his government. It also further demonstrates the police's inability to act in a non-partisan manner to protect the citizenry's basic human rights. End Summary

FSLN Beats, Kidnaps and Interrogates Opposition Youth; Police Involvement?

¶2.  (C) In the days following the CSJ's ruling allowing Ortega's 
re-election (ref B), youth groups in Leon responded by 
spray-painting "no re-election for Ortega" throughout the city. 
Many of these youth are affiliated or support the Sandinista 
Renewal Movement (MRS), a left-of-center political movement that 
opposes Ortega's governing Sandinista National Liberation Front 
(FSLN).  According to MRS Department President Nicolas Palacios, 
since the MRS youth began their public demonstrations against 
Ortega's re-election, FSLN departmental members began following the 
youth.  On October 29, FSLN members in two vehicles stopped and 
attacked Eduardo Santos (23 years old) and Pompilio Miranda (26 
years old).  Santos is a member of the civil society group 
Movimiento por Nicaragua, but has participated in MRS activities. 
Miranda is a leader of the MRS departmental youth group.  The 
vehicles used to stop the young men were a taxi known to be at the 
service of the Leon City Hall (run by the FSLN) and the other was a 
pick-up belonging to the FSLN departmental headquarters. 
 
¶3.  (C) Approximately 10 men were in the two vehicles.  They 
stopped Santos and Miranda, sprayed the two young men with pepper 
spray, then attacked them physically.  Residents in the area came 
to Santos' and Miranda's rescue and provided them temporary refuge 
in a local store.  The residents then took Santos to the city 
hospital.  As Miranda left the local store, the FSLN members again 
began to follow him, at which point Miranda sought refuge in an 
empty restaurant.  The FSLN members entered the restaurant, 
attacked Miranda, then placed him in the pick-up and took him to 
the FSLN departmental headquarters.  At the FSLN offices, the 
governing party's militants again attacked Miranda and interrogated 
him on who was supporting the youth group's campaign against 
Ortega.  After approximately two hours, the FSLN militants placed 
Miranda in the bed of the pick-up and paraded him around town as a 
symbol to other would-be opposition members.  The FSLN militants 
eventually dumped Miranda off at the police station where City Hall 
employees were filing charges against Miranda for defacing public 
property.  (Note: Per ref C, this is in contrast to FSLN youth who 
have placed pro-Ortega graffiti throughout Managua and Leon, but 
against whom the government has filed no charges.) 
 
¶4. (C) According to Miranda, police were present at the FSLN headquarters when he was taken there. Palacios notes that the police regularly provide security to the governing party's installations and are aware of who enters and exits the offices. Miranda also reports that a police officer was in the vehicle that paraded him around Leon.

¶5.  (C) While the unified political opposition continues to 
deliberate on how best to address Ortega's direct assaults on 
Nicaragua's democracy, some in Nicaragua continue to publicly 
demonstrate their opposition to the government's authoritarian 
tactics.  As a result, the governing FSLN continues to physically 
respond to any form of opposition as it has repeatedly in the past 
(ref A, D).  This latest attack, however, is of particular concern 
due to the kidnapping and interrogation tactics the FSLN employed. 
Equally concerning is the police's direct awareness, or perhaps 
involvement, in the incident.
