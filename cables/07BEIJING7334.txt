SIPDIS 
nuclear issues, he added.  When a reporter asked whether China is

China's opposition to the international proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and its commitment to diplomatic negotiations for the proper 
settlement of the Iranian issue. 
 
¶3. Qin could not confirm the new intelligence report from the United 
States claiming Iran stopped developing nuclear weapons in 2003.  He 
repeatedly stated "China's position on Iran is persistent." 
 
Kitty Hawk 
---------- 
 
¶4. "China informed and allowed the USS Kitty Hawk to enter Hong 
Kong," Qin stated.  Regarding the United States' decision to go 
through the Taiwan Strait, the United States should "take a prudent 
route in a highly sensitive area," Qin replied.

hopes to take this opportunity to further promote friendship between

¶7. When asked about China's expectations for the upcoming Strategic 
Economic Dialogue (SED), Qin replied China highly values the SED. 
It is an "important forum to enhance strategic and mutual trust," he 
said.  China hopes to exchange views candidly and push forward trade 
and economic ties. 
 
Germany Opposes Taiwan's Referendum 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶8. China "appreciates Germany's opposition on Taiwan's referendum," 
Qin stated.  Germany's position on this is based on bilateral 
cooperation and friendship between China and Germany, he added. 
 
Island Dispute Between China and Vietnam 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. When asked to comment on the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's recent 
announcement claiming sovereignty over Xisha Island, Qin said China 
has "indisputable sovereignty" over this island and any accusation 
against China is groundless.

--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶10. China has taken note of President Chavez's referendum defeat and 
hopes for social stability in the region.  China also took note of
