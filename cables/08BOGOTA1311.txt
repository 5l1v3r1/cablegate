FARC REJECTS FRENCH MISSION 
--------------------------- 

¶1. (U) The FARC issued a communique, dated April 4, rejecting 
a French mission to provide urgent medical care to FARC-held 
hostages, including Ingrid Betancourt.  The FARC communique
accused President Uribe and the French Government of "bad 
faith," saying the group would not be blackmailed.  The FARC 
reiterated its demand for a demilitarized zone in the Valle 
De Cauca Department municipalities of Florida and Pradera, 
and praised the "humanitarian efforts" of Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez and Senator Piedad Cordoba.

¶2. (C) Meanwhile, former hostage and ex-Senator Luis Eladio
Perez continued to push his idea that Chavez' and Cordoba's 
renewed involvement is key to reaching an humanitarian accord 
with the FARC.  Perez also outlined his proposal which would 
involve the GOC's release of FARC prisoners to France while 
the FARC freed Betancourt and the other civilian hostages. 
In a second phase, the GOC and FARC would exchange military 
personnel.  It is unclear if the U.S. hostages would be 
released in the first or second package under Perez' 
proposal.   Perez said France would also commit to seek the 
FARC's removal from the EU terrorist list, once it freed all 
hostages and renounced further kidnapping. 

FRENCH--UNDER PRESSURE--CONSIDERING NEXT STEPS 
--------------------------------------------- - 

¶3. (C) French DCM in Bogota Alain Fort confirmed media 
reports that French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner plans 
to visit Colombia and Venezuela, and possibly other countries 
in the region, in the near future to continue to press for a 
humanitarian exchange.  Fort said French President Nicolas 
Sarkozy faces enormous domestic political pressure to obtain 
Betancourt's freedom.  The French remain in contact with 
Perez on his proposal, but expect little since the former 
hostage has no access to the FARC.  Fort added that the GOF 
is analyzing the FARC communique to determine whether or not 
references to Chavez and Cordoba indicated a future role in 
exchange talks.  Fort thought the FARC's communique language 
on Chavez and Cordoba leaned towards the past tense.
