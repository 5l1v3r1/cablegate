POLICY PRIORITIES 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ambassador briefed Estonian Parliamentarians 
October 16 on the U.S.-Estonia relationship.  His 
presentation, at the invitation of Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chair Sven Mikser (Defense Minister from 2002- 
2003), informed key members of parliament ahead of 
Estonia's decision on whether to extend Estonia's 
participation in ongoing military missions, including Iraq 
and Afghanistan (both of which expire at the end of the 
year).  Following Ambassador's remarks, committee members 
asked a wide range of questions, covering U.S. policy on 
Missile Defense, Ukraine, Georgia, Turkey, Kosovo and 
Russia, in addition to Iraq and Afghanistan.  The Estonian 
MPs were also interested in the possible effect upcoming 
U.S. elections will have on U.S. foreign policy. 
 
¶2. (U) The briefing proved extremely timely when later the 
same day the Prime Minister's foreign policy advisor 
informed visiting EUR/NB Director Gilchrist and DCM that 
the Government of Estonia (GOE) had recently finished the 
draft mandate extensions and planned to submit them to 
Parliament on October 18. 
 
¶3. (U) The GOE subsequently approved the draft resolutions 
on extending Estonian troops' participation in overseas 
military missions.  The resolutions must be approved by a 
simple majority in the Parliament in order to take effect. 
On October 18, Minister of Defense Jaak Aaviksoo commented 
that the GOE is not planning to alter the numbers of 
Estonian troops participating in the Iraq mission. 
Aaviksoo also stated that the GOE shares the U.S. view that 
the international military presence in Iraq needs to be 
gradually transformed into a civilian mission and noted 
that at this time the GOE does not plan to extend Estonia's 
Iraq mission beyond 2008. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Briefing attendees from the FAC included; Sven 
Mikser, FAC Chair (Social Democrat), Enn Eesma, FAC Vice- 
Chair (Center Party), Valdur Lahtvee (Green Party Faction 
Leader), Silver Meikar (Reform Party), Toomas Varek (Center 
Party) and Peeter Tulviste (Pro-Patria and Res Publica 
Union Party).  Three committee members were absent due to 
travel and two members were absent due to illness. 
 
¶5. (U) Accompanying the Ambassador at the briefing were the 
EUR/NB Director, DCM, Political/Economic Section Chief, 
Defense and Naval Attache, Poloff (note taker) and Pol 
Assistant. 
 
¶6. (U) COMMENT: The MPs clearly welcomed the chance to get 
an up-close look at U.S. policy and were impressed by 
Ambassador's presentation.  While the Iraq mandate, 
specifically, remains somewhat controversial in government 
circles (and the media), we nonetheless believe its 
extension by the Estonian Parliament will be achieved.  The 
Afghanistan mandate has broad political and popular 
support.  Post thanks Washington for assistance in 
providing the necessary materials to make this briefing 
successful. END COMMENT.
