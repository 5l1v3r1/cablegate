UN-AU SUPPORT ISSUES 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  On August 20, the Security Council 
unanimously adopted a resolution authorizing the African 
Union to maintain its AMISOM mission in Somalia for an 
additional six months and setting the stage for a possible 
follow-on UN Peacekeeping Operation.  Discussion in 
consultations prior to the adoption focused in large measure 
on laying down markers in anticipation of imminent SYG-AU 
consultations on the scope of AMISOM needs and UN capacity to 
meet them.  Most delegations taking the floor argued for an 
expansive interpretation of the nature and extent of support 
the UN could offer the AU and AMISOM, with the U.S. making 
clear that UN financial assistance can flow only to milops 
featuring clear UN command and control. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following 90 minutes of closed consultations, the 
Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1772 
(un.org/docs/sc) on August 20.  Preambular paragraph 7 (PP 7) 
of the resolution cites the August 4 letter from AU Chairman 
Konare to UNSYG Ban but does not expressly reiterate the 
language of that letter calling on the UN to put in place, 
"in consultation with the (AU) a financial, logistical and 
technical support package for AMISOM."  Operative paragraph 
15 (OP 15) of the resolution asks the SYG to consult with the 
AU about "what further support might be provided to AMISOM," 
but does not presume to characterize that possible support. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Several delegations were unhappy with the failure of 
PP 7 and OP 15 together to clearly signal Security Council 
readiness to assist AMISOM financially.  Italian Deputy 
PermRep Montovani said "Italy, as a major AMISOM donor, 
doesn't want to create the impression that the door to 
financial support for the AU is closed."  He asked members to 
"consider compromise language."  South African PermRep Kumalo 
said he would have preferred a more direct acknowledgment of 
Konare's request, adding that "we cannot be bold on Sudan 
regarding the AU and muted on Somalia."  Ghanaian PermRep 
Christian said the Council "needs to urgently consider the AU 
request for support" which he hoped the AU would make 
explicit to the SYG for the report due to the Council in 30 
days per OP 15.  Indonesian PermRep Kleib said countries 
considering AMISOM troop contributions need to know what 
support AMISOM has and hoped the Council could quickly come 
to agreement on a support package after the 30-day report. 
Congo PermRep Gayama said he "would have hoped that Konare's 
letter would have been specified (in the resolution) in the 
terms he gave -- financial, logistical, and technical" 
support. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Despite these misgivings, all delegations supported 
the text.  UKUN effectively obviated any Italian thoughts 
about compromise language by moving to have the text tabled 
as a presidential (i.e. unanimously sponsored) text, 
effectively daring Italy's Montovani to openly oppose the 
text in probable contradiction of his orders from Rome. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador Wolff recalled the U.S. view that UN 
funds can be used for peacekeeping operations only under 
clear UN command and control.  He said the resolution gave a 
clear message that everyone should be involved in aiding 
Somalia and that non-UN donors were of course free to follow 
their own guidelines.  He then drew the Council's attention 
to OP 16's language's reiterating a call for contingency 
planning for deployment of a UN peacekeeping operation and 
urged members to view this resolution in the context of a 
likely AMISOM-UN transition. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT.  Although members responsibly decided to 
let Resolution 1772 enter the world as a positive expression 
of Security Council solidarity in the cause of aiding 
Somalia, issues involving the nature and scope of UN 
assistance to AMISOM have been clearly presented and will 
play out in the context of the SYG's upcoming report on his 
consultations with Konare.  Several members have served 
notice that they will be closely scrutinizing UN operations 
in Sudan and Chad for precedents helping them push the AMISOM 
assistance envelope.
