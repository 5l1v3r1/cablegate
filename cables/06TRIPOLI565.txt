SUBJECT: BIS TEAM "CHECKS OUT" LIBYA 
 
¶1. (U)  Summary:  The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry 
and Security (BIS) completed a largely successful series of 
export license compliance checks September 9-19.  BIS agents 
Scot Gonzales and Perry Davis completed dozens of checks during 
the BIS's first-ever visit to Libya.  Levels of compliance were 
mixed, but the team set a baseline for future Commerce license 
checks and educated the GOL and local businesses about recent 
export rules changes germane to Libya.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
First BIS visit to Libya Reviews End-Use Compliance 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U)  Scot Gonzales and Perry Davis from the Commerce 
Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) conducted the 
first-ever series of export license checks in Libya, September 
9-19.  They visited numerous sites in both Tripoli and Benghazi 
to review compliance with U.S. export regulations.  The licensed 
commodities under review were "dual use" items which can have 
both civilian and military uses.  The team ensured that the 
controlled items had been shipped to the proper end user and 
were utilized for the purpose stated on license applications. 
They took pains to explain the purpose of their visit to their 
interlocutors, emphasizing that BIS conducts end-use checks 
worldwide, and that a successful review of an entity's record 
can speed future license approvals. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The BIS team's visit came on the heels of the August 31 
amendment to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that 
apply to Libya.  This change removed the requirement for a 
license to export or re-export items controlled for 
anti-terrorism (AT) reasons.  With the change, items such as 
most computers, software, telecommunications equipment and 
vehicles can be exported to Libya without a Commerce export 
license.  The BIS team addressed questions about the EAR change, 
which put Libya on a par with most US export destinations, 
noting that many of the commodities being checked would no 
longer require licenses for export and re-export to Libya. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
-------------------------------- 
Installed Base Responsibilities Briefed to Interlocutors 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U)  During their visit, the BIS team reminded interlocutors 
about their responsibilities in dealing with "installed base" 
items.  Installed base refers to U.S. goods brought into the 
country during the sanctions period without appropriate 
licenses.  U.S. citizens are prohibited from "ordering, buying, 
removing, concealing, storing, using, selling, loaning, 
disposing of, transferring, financing, forwarding, or otherwise 
servicing, in whole or part, any items that may have been 
originally illegally exported or reexported to Libya by third 
parties."   Furthermore, US citizens are required by law to 
report such items to the Bureau of Industry and Security within 
90 days of coming into contact with them.  This includes 
commodities that no longer require a Commerce license following 
the August 31 amendment of the EAR as it relates to Libya. 
Installed base items are undoubtedly present in every sector of 
the Libyan economy, particularly in agriculture. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The BIS team's license checks focused primarily on 
companies working in the petroleum sector, including Conoco 
Philips, Marathon, Schlumberger, Hess, and WesternGeco, among 
others.  Two large Libyan government entities, the Arabian Gulf 
Oil Company and the Great Man-Made River Authority, were also 
visited.  The quality of the license checks ranged widely.  At 
the high end were impressive displays of corporate compliance, 
complete with PowerPoint slide shows, tidy binders of 
appropriate paperwork and export compliance specialists flown in 
from abroad.   In a few instances, equipment was pulled from the 
field (e.g., GPS units used by petroleum exploration crews 
operating deep in the Libyan desert) to be presented to the BIS 
team for inspection.  Other checks were conducted without the 
benefit of a visual inspection of the licensed items, owing to 
their reported ongoing use in remote areas of the country. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Appointment Requests Encounter Stunning Bureaucratic Evasion 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  One failed license check spoke volumes about the 
frustrations of operating in Libya.  The BIS team, accompanied 
by Econoff and Econ Specialist, had flown to Benghazi to conduct 
several checks at GOL owned/operated facilities.  Appointments 
set before departure dissolved by 9AM the following day, and the 
team was forced into a holding pattern.  As required, a request 
for these USG-GOL meetings had been made in advance via 
diplomatic note, and approval had been granted by the Protocol 
Office of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and 
International Cooperation.  However, this fact had not reached 
the Libyan entities, and it took more than a day of continuous 
phone calls to clarify the situation and commence office visits. 
 However, the quasi-private Bank of Commerce and Development 
engaged in a stunning display of bureaucratic evasion tactics, 
and avoided a visit entirely.  After much effort to contact him, 
our bank point of contact confirmed receipt of protocol's 
approval for the meeting, as well as his superior's approval of 
the meeting in principle.  However, he staunchly and repeatedly 
refused a meeting, on the grounds that he had not personally 
received his supervisor's personal permission to hold the 
meeting.  Alas, neither reason nor his supervisor could be 
reached, and the team's trip passed without a visit to the Bank 
of Commerce and Development.   It is noteworthy that in Libya, 
even a visit to a "private" bank can require expediting by the 
Libyan Government Protocol Office, and the extra level of 
coordination does not guarantee success. 
 
-------------------------- 
Check You Later 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (U)  The BIS team departed Libya having conducted dozens of 
end-use license checks, almost all of which produced solid 
evidence that end items were being utilized and controlled 
properly.  With the amendment of the EAR, return of U.S. oil 
companies and the expansion of bilateral trade and investment 
ties, future Commerce license checks are likely to focus on a 
narrower, more sensitive range of commodities.  Agents Gonzales 
and Davis did not clear this cable.
