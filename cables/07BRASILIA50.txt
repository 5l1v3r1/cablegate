1.(SBU) On January 9, 2007, SCI Officer delivered demarche (reftel 
A) to Otavio Trindade of the Ministry of External Relations' 
Division for Environmental Policy and Sustainable Development (tel: 
55 61 3411-9295; otavio@mre.gov.br).  Trindade said that the GOB 
supports UNEP voluntary mercury partnerships and opposes any binding 
resolutions with regard to UNEP mercury pollution reduction 
programs.  Trindade added that the GOB does not intend to advance 
any new proposals in this regard at the February UNEP GC meeting in 
Nairobi.  Note: This reaffirms the GOB position communicated to the 
USG at the recent Common Agenda for the Environment Meeting in 
December. End note. 
 
2.(SBU) With regard to GOB support for the establishment of 
non-binding targets/reductions in mercury pollution, a global 
phase-out of mercury mining, and/or a global prohibition of mercury 
exports, Trindade requested more time to consult internally before 
communicating an official GOB position.  Note: Given the GOB's 
opposition to binding measures for mercury pollution reduction, the 
GOB may support non-binding targets, but it is not clear whether it 
would support the latter two potential measures.  Trindade did say, 
however, that these latter two appear to be contradictory to the 
GOB's general stance on non-binding mercury pollution reduction 
measures. End Note.  Post will follow-up with the GOB and report 
back via septel. 
 
3.(SBU) Brazil does have at least one domestic program underway 
aimed at reducing mercury poisoning from artisinal mining in the 
Tapajos Basin in the Amazon.  The program was initiated by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The EPA is currently working 
with Post and the Ministry of Environment (MMA) to formalize this 
cooperation through, for example, a non-binding instrument such as 
an exchange of letters of cooperation (reftel B).  Moreover, Brazil 
is a participant in the OESI funded Mercury Regional Program for 
members of the ACTO (Amazon Country Treaty Organization), which aims 
to establish closer collaboration on mercury contamination in Latin 
America, specifically in the Amazon (reftel C).
