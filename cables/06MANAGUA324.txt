Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C) Foreign Minister Norman Caldera told the Ambassador on 
February 8 that he fully agrees with the USG positions on 
Iran set out in reftels B and C, and is "personally 
horrified" at the thought of Iran as a nuclear power. 
Caldera noted that Nicaragua still maintains diplomatic 
relations with Iran, and offered his government as a conduit 
to pass messages to the Iranians if we would ever find it 
useful.  Caldera also stressed that the Nicaraguan 
delegations in New York and Geneva stand ready to assist in 
any way they can on this issue.
