Day 9 
 
¶1.      (SBU)  Summary:  Money transfer companies begin to deliver 
remittances.  Ten thousand refugees camped on the Champs de Mars, 
with help from France and the U.S.  Road congestion is reduced on 
the road corridor between the DR and Port-au-Prince, but travel 
time is still lengthy.  The business community asked MINUSTAH to 
provide security for reopened factories, and pledged to re-open in 
weeks.  The military estimates that the main port will operating at 
full capacity in six to eight weeks, and a private port says it 
will open in 10 days.  All military and civilian hospital 
facilities in the Port-au-Prince area are filled with quake 
victims.  End summary. 
 
 
 
CITY RESIDENTS BEGIN TO HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU) Some money transfer companies opened today, with huge 
crowds in front of several sites. These companies are the primary 
conduit for remittances sent to Haiti from the Haitian Diaspora 
abroad.  The crowds were orderly and no MINUSTAH or PNH security 
were present.  Banks plan to open January 23 and will allow 
withdrawals up to USD 2500 for essential purchases only. 
 
 
 
10,000 REFUGEES CAMPED ON THE CHAMPS DE MARS 
 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU) On January 21, Ambassador Merten visited the Champs 
de Mars (the main avenue and park area adjacent to the Presidential 
Palace and Port-au-Prince's equivalent to the Washington, DC mall) 
with French Ambassador to Haiti Didier Le Bret and JTF Haiti 
Commander General Ken Keen.  The Champs de Mars now houses 
earthquake refugees numbering approximately 10,000.  The French and 
U.S. Governments are providing resources and supplies to improve 
conditions in this temporary community in the historic heart of 
Port-au-Prince.  Ambassador Le Bret praised U.S. relief efforts and 
told Ambassador Merten that the French Embassy's efforts could not 
succeed without U.S. support.  Merten assured Le Bret that U.S. 
support will continue. 
 
 
 
ROAD CONGESTION REDUCED BETWEEN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND 
PORT-AU-PRINCE 
 
 
 
¶4.      (SBU) The manager for the shipping company transporting 
relief supplies by land to Port-au-Prince from the Dominican border 
reported that traffic congestion on the route improved today.  On 
January 20, the trip took five hours, and now it requires three. 
Normally, it is a one-hour trip. 
 
 
 
PRIVATE SECTOR REACHES OUT TO GOH, MINUSTAH 
 
 
 
¶5.      (SBU)  The private sector reinforced its message of getting 
back to business in meetings with President Preval and UN Special 
Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) Edmond Mulet on 
January 20.  Business leaders met with Preval to express their 
support for his leadership and the GOH in its relief, recovery, and 
rebuilding efforts.  They also met with SRSG Mulet to request 
MINUSTAH's help in maintaining security for their businesses. 
Businessman Richard Coles spoke on a radio broadcast and discussed 
the business community's plans to re-start and re-create the jobs 
lost due to the earthquake, particularly in the textile industry. 
Coles told EmbOff that he hopes the GOH and the Haitian population 
will realize they have the full support of the Haitian business 
community.  Garment factory owner Alain Villard, who lost up to 500 
workers under one of his factories that collapsed, told EmbOff that 
he could re-open his factory next week.  However, Villard requires 
assistance retrieving remains and clearing debris from the building 
site.  Rebuilding this factory would re-employ 500 to 1500 people 
in long-term jobs, according to Villard.  Andy Apaid, who owns six 
garment factories, said that he expects to re-open his factories by 
the end of next week. 
 
 
MAIN PORT TO OPEN IN SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS 
 
 
 
¶6.      (SBU)  The military unit responsible for re-constructing 
and reopening the main port in Port-au-Prince estimated that it 
would be restored to full capacity within six to eight weeks.  The 
private Terminal Vareaux estimated that will be operational in 10 
days. 
 
 
 
LA GONAVE ALSO SUFFERING 
 
 
 
¶7.      (SBU)  A helicopter from the Carl S. Vinson visited the 
island of La Gonave on January 21 and found a village with 1,000 
people without fuel or food.  The aircraft distributed food and 
water to them and evacuated three patients for medical treatment. 
Food distribution went off without a hitch, with local residents 
organizing distribution of the aid among themselves.  This again 
confirms that social structures in the countryside are still 
intact. 
 
 
 
ALL MEDICAL FACILITIES FILLED WITH QUAKE VICTIMS 
 
 
 
¶8.      (SBU)  The military reported that all of its medical 
facilities, including its ships offshore, were full with quake 
victims.  The Ministry of Health told the military to cease 
transporting patients to other hospitals outside of Port-au-Prince 
because, according to the Ministry, all of the country's hospitals 
were full.
