SUBJECT: USAU MEETING WITH SOUTH SUDAN'S REPRESENTATIVE IN 
ETHIOPIA 
 
 THIS MESSAGE IS FROM USAU AMBASSADOR BATTLE. 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On December 8 USAU Ambassador Battle and the U.S. 
Charge to Ethiopia Mushingi attended a lunch hosted by the 
French Ambassador to the African Union and Ethiopia, 
Ambassador Jean-Christophe Belliard, and attended by 
Ambassadors from the AU Partner Nations and the Sudan Head of 
Mission for the Government of Southern Sudan in Addis Ababa, 
Arop Deng Kuol. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The intent of the meeting was to receive a report 
from Kuol on the situation in Sudan in light of the 
demonstrations held in Sudan on December 7, and the arrest of 
Members of the Parliament (MP) and their subsequent release. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kuol stated that another demonstration is planned 
for December 10,that will be supported by all political 
parties to express the rights of the people to peacefully 
demonstrate and to show displeasure with the unconstitutional 
arrest of MPs. Other key points made by Kuol included: 
 
-- dismay that the Government arrested MPs and that the 
arrests had been ordered by the Attorney General; 
 
-- dismay that it took two hours of conversation to convince 
President Omar El-Bashir to release the arrested MPs; 
 
-- dismay that a MP was assaulted during his arrest; 
 
-- that there is a limited time for the current Parliament to 
enact legislation that will enable a constitutional 
democratic transformation. The deadline for enactment of 
legislation is December 31,2009 otherwise all subsequent 
action would be unconstitutional; 
 
-- desire to repel the Laws on National Security as a 
precondition for elections; 
 
-- insistence that partner nations trust Sudan with its own 
future to include the right for the South to break from the 
North. 
 
¶4. (SBU) It is important to note that Kuol supports the 
African Union's participation in the implementation of the 
CPA as long as the AU works in concert with IGAD. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Kuol expressed that Ethiopia is the only African 
nation with a vested interest in the success of both the 
North and the South of Sudan and therefore has the confidence 
of both the North and the South. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Belliard, who has served in Khartoum, 
repeatedly stated that in the French perspective, Sudan is 
the most pressing issue on the continent of Africa. He feared 
an implosion. Kuol agreed that Sudan was the most pressing 
issue on the Continent but he did not share the fear of an 
implosion. The general consensus of the meeting was that the 
elections will take place in 2010 and that the South will 
break away after the referendum in 2011. 
 
Eritrea Sanctions 
----------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The issue of U N sanctions on Eritrea was raised by 
USAU Ambassador and the French Ambassador brushed off all 
references to Eritrea by throwing both hands in the air.
