REF: STATE 5564 
 
(SBU) Per reftel instructions, we informed MFA DAS-level 
director of South Asia bureau Ms. Grillo-Nebout of the new 
South Asia strategy and delivered a copy of the Department's 
March 25 backgrounder on the strategy.  Ms. Grillo-Nebout was 
unable to provide us with immediate feedback, as the MFA was 
hosting with the UNDP a development assistance conference for 
Afghanistan, but promised to get back to us at the first 
opportunity.
