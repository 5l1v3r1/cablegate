SUBJECT: FINNISH ENVIRONMENT MINISTER WELCOMES U.S. CLIMATE 
INITIATIVE 
 
REF: STATE 75287 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 20, Ambassador Ware briefed Finnish 
Environment Minister Paula Lehtomaki on the President,s new 
initiative for developing a post-2012 climate change 
framework by the end of 2008.  While appreciative of the U.S. 
proposal, Lehtomaki continued to hold to the EU,s focus on 
binding international commitments in any post-Kyoto solution. 
 Nonetheless, Lehtomaki said Finland was encouraged by the 
proposal and by U.S. leadership in building international 
commitment to addressing climate change, particularly from 
China and India.  Citing climate change as one of the key 
priorities of the new Finnish government, Lehtomaki commented 
on the importance of the U.S. and EU working with other 
international partners within the established UN climate 
process, rather than simply blazing what she termed "lonely 
independent paths." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Reflecting her previous position as Minister of 
Foreign Trade and Development, Lehtomaki stressed that 
developing countries have a strong expectation that developed 
countries should shoulder the cost of climate change. 
Lehtomaki also remarked on the importance of using technology 
to address climate change, including carbon capture and 
storage; however, she stated that a strong global cap and 
trade system is needed to generate adequate investment for 
technological solutions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Lehtomaki remarked positively on the U.S.-EU High 
Level Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and 
Sustainable Development (HLD) that took place last fall in 
Helsinki.  She briefly shared the difficulty Finland faced in 
convincing the EU Commission to put forward a balanced agenda 
for the HLD.  Lehtomaki reiterated that Finland views the HLD 
as an important stepping stone that led to further engagement 
between the U.S. and the international community on climate 
change issues. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: A rising star in Finnish politics, 
Lehtomaki continues to tow the EU line on climate change; 
however, the Finns tend to be pragmatic consensus builders 
who are eager to develop a strong international climate 
change framework.  As such, we can likely count on Finland to 
be cooperative and helpful as we work with the EU on climate 
change issues as demonstrated during the HLD.  End comment.
