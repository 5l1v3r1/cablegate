Classified By: Ambassador Janet A. Sanderson for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
¶1. (C)  Summary: Senator Youri Latortue may well be the most 
brazenly corrupt of leading Haitian politicians, according to 
a colleague.  The XXXXXXXXXXXX recently shared with poloffs his concerns regarding Latortue's illegal or otherwise unsavory activities 
in the port city of Gonaives and other areas of the 
Artibonite.  Latortue's family connections play a part in his 
ability to manipulate the region, as do his close 
associations with armed gangs and drug traffickers.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (C)  On November 9, Poloffs met with XXXXXXXXXXXX
(protect), XXXXXXXXXXXX.  XXXXXXXXXXXX has been in this XXXXXXXXXXXX position for approximately XXXXXXXXXXXX, serving as XXXXXXXXXXXX.  The IGoH XXXXXXXXXXXX 
and he is unsure whether or not XXXXXXXXXXXX. The First Senator from the Artibonite is Youri Latortue, of the Artibonite in Action party.  XXXXXXXXXXXX was able to provide insight into the senator's 
activities in the region, particularly in the city of 
Gonaives. 
 
-------------------- 
Latortue Family Ties 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The Latortue family is crawling all over Haitian 
politics.  Youri is a first cousin once-removed of former 
IGoH Prime Minister Gerard Latortue.  Youri's sister is the 
former mayor of Gonaives, and the former delegate to the 
region was a cousin of his as well.  The administration 
filled Haiti's local and municipal offices by presidential 
appointment during the IGoH.  Senator Latortue had influence 
over these appointments through his relation with IGoH Prime 
Minister Gerard Latortue, and managed to place members of his 
party in most positions around the Artibonite.  The senator 
used these people to consolidate his power and influence in 
the region until the new delegate to the Artibonite appointed 
new local and regional officials who were not in the back 
pocket of Senator Latortue.

Senator Running Drug and Gang Activities in Gonaives? 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX likened Senator Latortue's authority in 
the port city of Gonaives to that of a mafia boss.  He 
claimed that the somewhat lethargic port and the drug and 
other contraband trafficking taking place there are 
completely under the Senator's command.  The port in Gonaives 
is largely controlled by the Cannibal Army gang, which faces 
persistent competition from two other gangs, Des Cahos and 
Jubile Blan.  Senator Latortue exerts influence over all 
three groups and is thus able to maintain sway over dealings 
in the port.  Senator Latortue's other businesses in Gonaives 
include a nightclub and movie theater, both of questionable 
legitimacy.  Additionally, other sources such as SRSG Mulet 
have accused Latortue of being a "drug dealer" (ref A), and 
an oft-disruptive popular organization in St. Marc named 
"Bale Wouze" recently accused the senator of distributing 
weapons in an effort to destabilize the government. (Note: 
St. Hilien phoned the Embassy on November 16 to reinforce the 
Bale Wouze accusations, and also to report another incident 
in which Senator Latortue and friends were stealing telephone 
poles and utility boxes from Port-au-Prince for use in 
Gonaives.  End Note.) 
 
¶5. (C)  After the large-scale flooding in the Artibonite in 
September, the central government allocated emergency food 
supplies to be distributed to the flood victims.  XXXXXXXXXXXX 
reported that Senator Latortue intercepted the supplies and 
stashed them temporarily somewhere in Gonaives, and then took 
the supplies to the victims and acted as if he was personally 
responsible for the handouts. 
 
¶6. (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX recounted a story demonstrating Prime 
Minister Jacques Eduard-Alexis' distrust of Senator Latortue 
and his Artibonite in Action party.  When a group of 
Artibonite in Action members sat behind the Prime Minister at 
a recent event to celebrate the anniversary of the city of 
Gonaives, he asked for them to be moved so they weren't so 
close to him.  During the same event, Senator Latortue paid 
protestors to demonstrate and cause disruption to the 
ceremonies, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX.  Senator Latortue often 
exploits local gangs for his own purposes in this way. 
 
¶7. (C)  Comment:  Latortue's activities are a cause for 
concern given his presidential ambitions for 2011.  Prime 
Minister Alexis has gone as far as to ask for the USG to 
"arrest him", as has Preval's advisor Bob Manuel.  Post will 
provide septel a fuller profile of Latortue's background and 
policy implications for the USG.  End Comment.
