NOMINATING-OFFICER: Roy Glover 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Deborah McCormick is the Director of Art and Industry 
Biennial Trust which presents a Bi Annual exhibition of Art 
in public spaces.  She has successfully lead three biennial 
exhibitions, raised approximately $3.1 million dollars in 
sponsorship and managed many stake holder relationships as 
well as maintaining a high curatorial standard. In 2000 she 
received an award from the Christchurch City Council 
recognizing her achievements in managing this event for the 
city. Post has worked with Deborah on the 2002 Biennial 
which featured a work by American artist Ed Osborn. Deborah 
is in a position to grow the capability of the SCAPE Art and 
Industry program in Christchurch. By funding this visit to 
the United States her board of directors is expressing their 
confidence that she will learn valuable information about 
public art and out door art installations in America and 
extend her knowledge and networks of counterpart arts 
managers and artists in this area. It is intended that 
through contacts she develops on this visit that invitations 
to American artists to exhibit their work in Christchurch 
New Zealand ( and other cities where she has influence) will 
be extended as a result. 
The SCAPE Art and Industry exhibition is presented in 
Christchurch 
(Pop 318,000) which is the largest city in the South Island 
of New Zealand. It is a sophisticated regional business 
center that has two universities, a thriving arts community, 
attractive 19th century architecture and beautiful English 
style parks and gardens. It is also the tourist gateway into 
the southern alpine region. The city hosts the supply 
airport base for the United States Antarctic Program 
administered by the National Science Foundation. All 
supplies for the American Base at McMurdo in Antarctica fly 
out of Christchurch. The city is very proud of this 
connection with the United States. Interestingly, in 2003, 
American artist Ed Osborn presented  an art work that 
included archive footage of the Antarctic continent. 
It would be good if somewhere in the program the visitors 
could compare and contrast public art programs in an 
American city of similar size and type such as Christchurch. 
They want to visit New York as part of this program and 
international fares will be arranged to return from there.

This visitor is called by her middle name - Adrienne. She is 
the wife of an industry leader Sir Robert Stewart and as a 
custom in New Zealand carries the title of 'Lady' (rather 
than Mrs.) Stewart. 
It would be appropriate and correct wherever possible to 
write her name as 'Adrienne, Lady Stewart' and in formal 
situations to introduce her this way. 
She is a gregarious and charming person who works tirelessly 
in support of the arts (and welfare) organizations in New 
Zealand and is not the sort of person to require special 
treatment because of her title. 
She generally introduces herself by her first name in 
informal situations and she is a very easy and grateful
