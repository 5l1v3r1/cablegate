SUBJECT: PRIORITIES OF INDONESIAN MINISTRY OF MARINE AFFAIRS AND 
FISHERIES 
 
REF: JAKARTA 1289 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries' 
(DKP) vision is one of environmentally sustainable coastal resource 
management and economic development.  Its highest priority 
activities include: fisheries management plans for specific areas; 
capacity building and training on fisheries enforcement; developing 
a national action plan for the Coral Triangle Initiative; and 
technical support for aquaculture development and expansion.  DKP 
expects its leadership of the World Oceans Conference (May 2009) to 
help reinforce these priorities within the GOI and internationally. 
DKP will soon begin strategic planning for 2010 and beyond.  USG 
assistance will help DKP meet these objectives and develop its next 
strategic plan.  End Summary. 
 
Specific Project Priorities 
--------------------------- 
¶2.  (U) DKP's Directorates are responsible for management of all 
coastal and marine natural resources.  Priorities of each 
Directorate tend to reflect their area of responsibility, although 
the Secretary General of DKP encourages collaboration between groups 
(reftel).  Capacity building, training, and educational exchanges 
focused on DKP strategic priorities are of great interest to DKP 
managers and staff.  New directions include adaptation to climate 
change and addressing food security issues as a result of recent 
increases in fuel prices.  Highest priority activities include: 
fisheries management plans for specific areas; capacity building and 
training on fisheries enforcement; developing a national action plan 
for the Coral Triangle Initiative; and technical support for 
aquaculture development and expansion. 
 
¶3.  (U) Fisheries management plans for specific areas (for example, 
North Java):  The plans should integrate management of marine 
protected areas; other recommendations for habitat protection, 
rehabilitation or artificial reefs; rules for sustainable fisheries 
that will reduce poverty, including gear and boat specifications; 
and licensing, surveillance, and enforcement.  The plans should 
identify incentives for small fishermen to comply with best 
practices and law.  The plans must address implementation barriers, 
including how best to integrate national, provincial, and local 
government interests and responsibilities. 
 
¶4.  (U) Capacity building and training on fisheries enforcement, 
including pollution/marine resource surveillance and destructive 
fishing investigations, including calculating the economic losses: 
This would strengthen enforcement programs in key areas, 
particularly in the Sulu Sulawesi, South China, and Arafura Seas, by 
building on traditional fisheries management practices (using 
community-based surveillance and customary law).  A preliminary 
focus could be placed on destructive practices in capturing shrimp 
and skipjack tuna. 
 
¶5.  (U) Coral Triangle initiative activities focus both on 
supporting the regional (international) secretariat, and on 
developing a national action plan:  A national action plan for the 
Coral Triangle Initiative is a priority for DKP.  The specific form 
this plan will take is still under discussion and reaching consensus 
is difficult.  Ideas presented so far include an integrated project 
to manage fisheries, marine protected areas, and provide sustainable 
alternative livelihoods in coastal and small island areas in an area 
encompassing southern Sulawesi and East Nusa Tenggara.  Alternative 
proposals include completing comprehensive coastal management plans 
for the provinces in the Coral Triangle. 
 
¶6.  (U) Technical support for aquaculture development and expansion: 
 Seaweed aquaculture holds great promise as a sustainable 
alternative economic activity in coastal areas and on small islands. 
 To implement this vision, seaweed aquaculture must include 
partnerships with the private sector to stabilize supply chains, and 
should include business models that encourage development of 
diversified economies in small communities.  One model that holds 
promise is a program in South Sulawesi that requires project 
participants to invest some of their early profits in expanding the 
technology to other islands.  The movement towards requiring 
certification and documentation of the source of fish products can 
also increase the value of Indonesian fisheries products.  Training

and capacity building in aquaculture technologies and approaches 
appropriate to small coastal communities are particularly useful. 
 
Intersection with US Interests 
------------------------------ 
¶7.  (U) The Coral Triangle Initiative is a USG priority, and USAID 
plans to invest $40 million for regional CTI activities.  USAID is 
providing funding for a team of consultants to conduct an assessment 
of DKP in August 2008.  USAID Jakarta also plans to provide the 
services of a highly-qualified advisor to work with the Secretary 
General's office for 1-2 years, as DKP develops its strategic plan 
for 2010 and beyond.  DKP is highly motivated to develop a closer 
relationship with NOAA under the framework of the Memorandum of 
Understanding that NOAA and DKP signed in 2007.  Investing in any of 
DKP's highest priority activities with a goal of demonstrating 
sustainable coastal resource management and economic development in 
small island communities would provide models that could be applied 
in other developing countries.
