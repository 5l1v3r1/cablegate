SUBJECT: MAID'S ABUSER FOUND GUILTY, SENTENCED TO 18 YEARS 
 
¶1.  (U) In Malaysia's highest profile domestic worker abuse 
case, a Kuala Lumpur sessions court judge on November 27 
found Yim Pek Ha guilty of three charges of "causing grievous 
hurt" to Indonesian maid Nirmala Bonet, a 2008 U.S. TIP 
Report Hero.  Nirmala suffered horrendous physical abuse, 
including significant burns from an iron, in 2004.  The court 
case began in July 2004 and involved 100 court sessions over 
52 months.  The judge acquitted Yim of a fourth charge of 
"causing hurt" by striking Nirmala with a metal cup.  The 
judge sentenced Yim to 18 years for each charge, to be served 
concurrently.  In his remarks, the judge said the offences 
committed by Yim showed "sadistic behavior which cannot be 
tolerated by society."  The judge stated that Yim "deserved" 
to serve the sentences consecutively, but in the end, he 
deemed a 54-year sentence too harsh.  Following her 
sentencing, the judge raised Yim's bail to $55,555 (200,000 
ringgit), from the original bail of $23,615 (85,000 ringgit). 
 Yim remains free on bail pending appeal. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Eka Aryanto, spokesman for the Indonesian Embassy, 
told Poloff his embassy was pleased with the sentence, which 
hopefully would serve as a deterrent to future abuse of 
Indonesians employed as domestic help.  Eka also informed us 
Nirmala is considering a civil suit to seek compensation from 
Yim and her husband.  Local media reported human rights 
activists' reactions to the verdict.  Siva Subramaniam, a 
commissioner for Malaysia's Human Rights Commission, 
described the Nirmala case as "the tip of an iceberg."  He 
hoped "irresponsible employers who take advantage of domestic 
help" would learn from the case.  Irene Fernandez, director 
of the NGO Tenaganita, called the 18 year sentence fair.  Ivy 
Josiah, executive director of Women's Aid Organization said, 
"this (conviction) will be a clear message to all who treat 
their employees badly." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  Nirmala's case, particularly the severity 
of the physical abuse she endured, attracted international 
attention.  Yim's guilty verdict and the local press coverage 
of this outcome represent a modest step forward in Malaysia's 
efforts to deter the abuse of foreign workers, but much 
remains to be done.  Cases like Nirmala's must overcome the 
inertia of a legal system and a public still largely 
insensitive to the exploitation of poorly educated, low-wage 
migrant workers.
