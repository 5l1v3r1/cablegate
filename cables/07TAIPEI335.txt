SUBJECT:  Taiwan Central Bank Changes Name 
REF:  TAIPEI 287 
 
¶1.  As part of Taiwan's campaign of name rectification (reftel), on 
February 10, Taiwan's central bank changed the English name on its 
website (http://www.cbc.gov.tw) by dropping "China."  Its Chinese 
name remains unchanged as "Zhongyang Yinhang."  Its old and new 
English names follow: 
 
Old Name: 
"Central Bank of China [first line] Republic of China (Taiwan) 
[second line]" 
 
New Name: 
"Central Bank [first line] of the Republic of China (Taiwan) [second 
line]" 
 
¶2.  The Taiwan Central Bank (TCB) has not changed its English name 
used in its correspondence with foreign banking institutions, but 
plans to do so in the near future.  A senior official of TCB told 
AIT/T that the new English name should have no adverse effects on 
its relationship with international financial institutions.  The 
official said that other mergers and acquisitions have led to name 
changes, but have never brought any difficulty. He noted that the 
name was changed to avoid confusion between the TCB and its PRC 
counterpart.
