MFA Spokesman Mikhail Kamynin on May 22 characterized Iraqi 
government formation as an "important event" and pledged 
"close cooperation" and "necessary assistance" to the new 
government in the interest of stabilizing the country. 
Kamynin expressed hope that PM al-Maliki would follow a path 
of national consensus and dialogue among all political and 
ethno-confessional groups, including those "who so far are 
not involved in the process of state-building."  Kamynin 
reiterated GOR support for a national reconciliation 
conference in Baghdad under the aegis of the Arab League. 
The full text of Kamynin's press release in English is
