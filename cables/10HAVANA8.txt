SUBJECT: CUBA AGHAST ABOUT LANDING IN FLIGHT SCREENING LIST 
 
REF: REF: ZUNIGA-FARRAR E-MAILS 1/5/10 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Government of Cuba (GOC) complained 
about reports that it had been included on the list of 
countries whose nationals would require additional screening 
before flying to the United States.  Moreover, the GOC said 
that it was in the dark about the extent and application of 
the new screening procedures, stating that all it knew had 
come from international press reports.  Foreign Ministry 
officials lamented that Cuba's inclusion was unfair and 
hostile, in light of the GOC's anti-terrorism cooperation 
with the rest of the world and the United States.  The U.S. 
Interests Section (USINT) explained that the measures were 
not aimed particularly at Cuba, and promised to share with 
the GOC the latest on the new procedures as soon as it is 
received.  USINT requests urgently information from 
Washington on the new screening measures and timetable for 
implementation.   END SUMMARY. 
 
"WE DON'T BELONG THERE" 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 5, 2009 officials from Cuba's Foreign 
Affairs Ministry (MINREX) presented a note to USINT COM and 
Pol/Econ Chief to protest its inclusion in the list of 
countries whose flights and nationals would be subject to 
increased screening.  The officials complained that Cuba 
"didn't belong in that group" of countries, especially given 
its strong stance against Islamic terrorism in particular. 
Noting that Cuba had been one of the first countries to 
condemn the 9/11 attacks and offer assistance in the 
aftermath, and its willingness to cooperate on law 
enforcement with the United States, the Minrex functionaries 
said that the decision to include Cuba was "unfair," 
"hostile" and "humiliating." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Cuba's mission in Washington delivered the same 
message to WHA/CCA.  Following both meetings, the Minrex 
officials in Havana issued a statement to the international 
press, complaining about the measures.  (Note: the tone of 
the meeting in Havana was businesslike and included 
productive discussions on other issues, including an offer to 
extend law enforcement cooperation.) 
 
IN THE DARK 
----------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GOC officials complained that they were in the 
dark about what the new procedures entailed, saying that they 
had been unable to obtain any information from U.S. officials 
or even from the Transportation Security Administration's 
(TSA) website.  The Minrex officials were particularly 
concerned about the applicability of new procedures to 
third-country nationals transiting through Cuba, Cuban 
nationals transiting through third countries, and Cuba's 
diplomats visiting the United States.  At the meeting with 
USINT officials, the GOC representatives seemed unsure about 
the fate of the growing flow of charter flights between Cuba 
and the United States. 
 
UNSURE OURSELVES 
---------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) USINT COM acknowledged that the Mission had scant 
information itself about the new procedures, while assuring 
the Cubans that the measures were to combat terrorism and 
were not political or aimed at interrupting charter flights 
to and from Cuba.  We promised to share information with the 
GOC as soon as we receive it, hopefully before the end of the 
week. 
 
ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) USINT requests information on the new TSA measures 
and timetable for implementation which we can discuss with 
the GOC.  We understand (Ref) that State has requested 
informally information from TSA.  The lack of information 
 
HAVANA 00000008  002 OF 002 
 
 
thus far has stirred a frenzy of press speculation, created 
uncertainty amongst the U.S. air charter companies, and riled 
the GOC.  Prompt guidance from Washington on what action we 
seek would help us to promote aviation security and manage 
the broader fallout over this issue.
