¶1. (U) Summary: Nuclear power remains at the center of Ontario's 
energy strategy, despite the recent cancellation of three nuclear 
power plant projects, and the passing of Ontario's much publicized 
Green Energy Act (GEA).  The steady supply of power from existing 
nuclear plants, combined with dramatically lower provincial demand 
for electricity, will mitigate any potential shortfall in 
electricity exports from Ontario to the United States.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Decreased Electricity Demand 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Ontario's maximum generation capacity is around 30,000 MW, 
but the province's current capacity has been curtailed to match 
decreased demand.  Demand from struggling energy-intensive 
industries such as manufacturing, which account for roughly 30% of 
provincial consumption, has decreased.  The drop in demand, coupled 
with higher levels of precipitation (resulting in more hydroelectric 
power) and lower than usual summer temperatures (July 2009 was the 
second coldest July in 40 years), have contributed to declining 
electricity demand in Ontario.  Peak demand in Ontario topped 20,000 
MW for only one hour in July 2009.  Wholesale consumption was down 
23% for the first six months of 2009, compared with the same period 
last year.  Electricity consumption by the steel industry was down 
36%, pulp and paper - down 24%, mining - down 20%, and automotive 
was down 5%.  Energy demand is expected to decline by 5.5% in 2009 
compared with 2008, before increasing slightly by 0.2% in 2010. 
 
¶3. (U) Roughly 50% of Ontario's electricity supply comes from 
nuclear power, while the remainder comes from hydroelectric (21%), 
coal-fired generators (18%), gas-fired stations (8%), and a very 
small percentage from other sources.  Before the current economic 
downturn, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) estimated that if no new 
facilities were built to replace retiring facilities, a 25,000 
megawatt (MW) gap between supply and demand would have been created 
by 2025. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Cancelled Nuclear Projects, Coal Plant Closures 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (U) Ontario announced in June 2009 that it would indefinitely 
postpone plans to build a new nuclear power reactor at its 
Darlington Nuclear Generating Station located 40 miles east of 
Toronto, citing higher-than-anticipated costs and uncertainty about 
the future of the bid winner, GOC-owned Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd 
(AECL).  The GOC is considering privatizing AECL, but has not made a 
final decision. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Separately, Bruce Power announced in July 2009 that it 
would withdraw its application to construct two new nuclear power 
plants in the Province.  Bruce Power is owned by a Canadian 
consortium that operates the Bruce nuclear complex, which is leased 
from provincially-owned Ontario Power Generation (OPG).  One plant 
was planned at its existing Bruce Nuclear facility, and the other at 
Nanticoke in southwestern Ontario, home to North America's largest 
coal-fired plant, also owned by OPG, which is scheduled to close in 
¶2014.  On September 3, OPG announced it would close two of eight 
units at Nanticoke, and two of four units at its Lambton plant near 
Sarnia, Ontario four years ahead of schedule in 2010.  (Comment: 
While Ontario Energy and Infrastructure Minister George Smitherman 
cast this acceleration in "Green" terms, it no doubt comes as a 
result of slackening demand.  End Comment.) 
 
-------------------------- 
Refurbished Nuclear Supply 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Rather than build the two new nuclear plants, Bruce Nuclear 
will focus on refurbishing its existing Bruce A and B plants on Lake 
Huron.  Current output, with 6 of its 8 reactors on line is 4,800 
MW, making Bruce Nuclear the largest nuclear facility in North 
America, in terms of output.  With all 8 reactors on line, its 
capacity will reach 6,300 MW, second largest in the world in terms 
of capacity, after Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Japan.  Refurbishment of 
Bruce A Units 1 and 2 are on schedule for completion in early 2010. 
Refurbishment of Bruce A Units 3 and 4 will follow the restart of 
reactors 1 and 2. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: Roughly 50% of Ontario's energy supply will come 
from nuclear power into the foreseeable future.  With decreased 
 
 
demand, increased conservation, and new electricity supply, Ontario 
is expected to have excess energy available for export to the Unites 
States in the near-term.  At any given time, the province has been 
able to export (or import) roughly 4,000 MW of supply through its 
transmission lines.  Concerns about a potential shortage of power 
seem less pressing now than a few years ago.  While the Province's 
Green Energy Act will bring more non-nuclear power online, the 
shut-down of coal-fired plants will mean that nuclear's overall 
contribution to Ontario's total supply will remain largely the same. 
 With the recession-driven drop in demand for electricity, even a 
potential loss of three nuclear plants should not dramatically 
impact Ontario's electricity exports to the United States.
