SUBJECT: GLOBAL INITIATIVE EXERCISE PLANNING GROUP DEMARCHE 
DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 101862 
 
(SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to MFA Deputy Director 
General for Disarmament and Nonproliferation Ahmet Gun on 
September 25.  We acknowledged Turkey's unease about the 
Global Initiative given the participation of Cyprus, but 
noted that the Exercise Planning Group (EPG) event is a 
technical level meeting and that the GOT may find 
participating in the workshop regarding the development and 
execution of scenario-driven training events useful in 
Turkey's efforts to strengthen its national response to 
nuclear terrorism.  Gun agreed that the event may be useful 
for Turkey, and that Turkey may consider sending experts to 
the meeting since it is not a political level meeting.  He 
undertook to pass the information and draft agenda to 
potential participants and provide us with any feedback he 
receives from them.
