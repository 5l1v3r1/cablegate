E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/23/2018
TAGS: NATO PREL GM RS

Classified By: CDA W.S. Reid for reasons 1.4 (b), (d).

¶1. (S/NF) The following document was provided to us
unofficially by a staffer in the Private Office of NATO
Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer (strictly protect).
According to the Private Office, the document was initially
provided by the Russians to the EU-3. Germany, in turn,
shared it with the Secretary General only. It is not in
circulation at NATO formally.

¶2. (S/NF) Commment: This document is more remarkable for how
it has been handled than for its content -- which is a rehash
of ideas we have seen from the Russians many times before.
The Dutch learned of the documents existence and informed
the SYG, per Private Office sources. He asked the U.S. to
provide it to him after a request to Germany confirmed the
documents existence, but also a refusal to share it with
him. When we told him we did not have a copy, he doubted our
answer and went back to the Germans. At that point the
Germans briefed De Hoop Scheffer on the document, but they
still refused to give him a copy. They did tell him,
however, that three other Allies had it. He took this to
mean that it was a Quad document, an impression of which
Germany did not disabuse him. When Germany refused to give
it to him, he once again asked us for it. When we repeated
that we did not have such a paper, he reportedly expressed
doubts about our answer, believing that we were deliberately
holding out on him. As a result, he went back to the Germans
a third time, who finally admitted the true source of the
document. They also eventually provided him a copy of the
paper, we understand. End Comment

¶3. (C/NF) The text of the Russian-drafted European Security
Paper follows below:

UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION

equal security of all States, stipulate in a legally binding

providing for security in Europe and in the world as a whole.
Key thematic elements of such a Treaty:

-- Basic principles of relations between States, including

States; inviolability of frontiers, possibility of their
change only in accordance with international law, by peaceful
means and by agreement; non-interference into internal

use of force or threat of use of force in international
relations in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the
United Nations.

-- Unified approaches in the Euro-Atlantic area to the
peaceful settlement of conflicts with the particular emphasis
on the priority of negotiated solutions based on the due
consideration of the positions of the parties and respect to
the existing international negotiating and peacekeeping
mechanisms.

-- Obligations of all States and international organizations
not to maintain their own security at the detriment to the
security of others, to observe the principles of equal and
indivisible security.

-- Reaffirmation that no State or international organization
in the Euro-Atlantic area is vested with primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
stability in this region or a right to consider any part of
it as an area of their exclusive influence.

-- Basic principles of arms control regime in Europe,

would not allow, in the framework of any military union,
organization or coalition, any actions undermining the unity
of the Euro-Atlantic security space and that the evolution of
such military unions, organizations or coalitions would be
carried out, inter alia, on the basis of respect of security
interests of every participating State of this Treaty.
