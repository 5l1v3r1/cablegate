¶1. (U) Post acknowledges receipt of reftels A (Docket number 
2008EA290014) and B (Docket number 2008EA290015).  However, 
as per the information received from Santiago Quiros Babillo, 
area officer at the Ministry of Infrastructure's Civil 
Aviation Directorate (ref C), Spain does not have the legal 
authority to investigate or take judicial action against 
citizens or residents of Spain who commit airspace violations 
in the United States or any other foreign airspace.  Laws 
21/2003 and 48/1960 are clear in this regard, limiting Spain 
to action solely related to its own airspace.  Given these 
laws, the GOS has indicated to us that it will not be able to 
accept requests or invitations to pursue investigations on 
any U.S. air space violations.  Absent legal changes, post 
does not believe it productive to continue sending the FAA 
investigation files to post.
