Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with, Al-Quds front pages 
statements by Palestinian Authority (PA) President Abbas made in 
Ottawa on May 25.  Abbas reiterates that the Palestinian Authority 
will not negotiate with Israel until Israel agrees to the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state and halts all 
settlement activity.  Abbas adds that his meetings with President 
Obama on May 28 will focus on the conditions necessary for pursuing 
peace talks with Israel.  In related news, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's 
front page highlights May 25 statements by French President Sarkozy 
supporting the two-state solution and calling for a halt to 
settlement activities.  Meanwhile, Al-Ayyam runs a back page cartoon 
of Israeli Premier Netanyahu sitting among dozens of dictionaries 
trying to find a replacement for the term, "Palestine" without 
success. 
 
Al-Quds leads with and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news of 
Israeli political support for the introduction of loyalty oaths by 
Arab citizens of Israel to the, "Jewish, Zionist and democratic 
state."  The wire coverage notes that Yisrael Betenu party is 
leading the push that would require the oath of any Arab resident of 
Israel seeking Israeli nationality or an Israeli ID card for the 
first time.  The proposed legislation would also make military 
service obligatory for Arab residents. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front page news citing Israeli daily 
Haaretz about the visit of a U.S. Congressional delegation led by 
Congressman Ackerman.  According to coverage, the delegation met 
with Israeli officials on May 24 and conveyed "tough messages" 
regarding continued settlement expansion in the West Bank.  The 
delegation also expressed concern over the humanitarian situation in 
Gaza, according to coverage. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs a large front page photo of a warning leaflets dropped 
by the Israeli military on the Gaza Strip on May 25.  The leaflet

risk being shot.  All dailies highlight the leaflets. 
 
In nuclear news, only Al-Quds runs a front page wire story about the 
May 25 North Korean nuclear test.  Regarding Iran, Al Quds' front 
page also reports that Israeli Defense Minister Barak will meet with 
Secretary Clinton next week in Washington to discuss the Iranian 
nuclear program.  Separate front page reporting in Al Quds run an 
AFP story quoting Israeli Premier Netanyahu noting that Israel may 
attack Iran, because, "If Israel does not start the attack, no one 
will." 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front page cites wafa in reporting on 
additional attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians. According to 
coverage, settlers from Bayt Yeter and Ma'un in the Hebron area, 
"aggressively attacked" five Palestinian farmers and burned their 
farms on May 25.

The three dailies highlighted coverage on U.S. reaction to Israeli 
Premier Netanyahu's comments about a "unified" Jerusalem, quoting 
State Department spokesman Kelly commenting that Jerusalem is a 
final status issue and that the U.S. will support Israeli and 
Palestinian efforts to reach agreement on all final status issues. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlights the story on its front-page under the 
headline, "U.S. rebuffs Netanyahu's remarks on Jerusalem." 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida led with, "Three Israeli NOs to the Palestinian 
state:  Sovereignty, return to the 1967 borders, and freezing 
settlement activities."  Al-Ayyam's lead story noted that the 
Israeli "NOs" are a direct challenge to U.S. policy.  In contrast, 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page also carries comments by Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas showing support for the U.S. in confirming 
that President Obama is serious about resolving the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

Weekend Stories: 
-------------- 
Sunday May 24: 
 
"Fatah will go united into its sixth party conference at the 
beginning of July and use all its power to enhance the President's 
[Abbas'] authority," according to Al Ayyam's and Al Quds' front 
pages.  The Fatah Commission for Mobilization and Organization 
released a statement stressing that "all speculation about divisions 
within the movement will prove untrue.  The legal, constitutional, 
and national role of [Palestinian Authority] President Abbas... is 
not subject to any interpretation or bargaining."  The statement 
also highlighted the importance of successful Palestinian unity 
talks and denounced negative Israeli policies in Jerusalem. 
 
News related to settlement activity appeared in several front page 
weekend stories.  Al Quds' ran remarks by Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Foreign Minister Al Malki from the Organization of Islamic 
Conference (OIC) meeting on May 23, calling on the OIC to protect 
Jerusalem from Israel's attack on its Arab identity.  Al Ayyam ran 
the results of a report by Israeli NGO Peace Now claiming that 2,000 
Israelis live "in the heart of" Palestinian neighborhoods in 
occupied East Jerusalem as part of an Israeli Government plan.  Both 
papers highlighted remarks by the well-known Palestinian Abdel Qader 
Al Hussayni, who responded to Israeli authorities shutting down a 
literature event in Jerusalem by noting, "as we predicted, the 
celebration of Al Quds as a [UNESCO] capital of Arab Culture is 
taking place in... guerilla-war style."  Finally, Saturday's papers 
reported on Israel evacuating illegal outposts in an attempt to 
soften the U.S. position on Israeli settlements, while "members of a 
Jewish settlement society 'Fund for lands of Israel' entered a house 
in Sheikh Jarrah [East Jerusalem] and changed the locks to prevent 
Palestinian residents from returning." 
 
Saturday, May 23: 
Al Quds' front page ran excerpts of remarks by Vice President Biden 
in Lebanon, highlighting that the U.S. considers the Palestinian 
issue "a cornerstone for resolving the region's problems."  Biden 
also reiterated U.S. commitment to the sovereignty and independence 
of Lebanon, according to coverage.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Dr. Naji Shurrab opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title, "Reading through Obama's peace proposal" (05/26):  "How will 
 
JERUSALEM 00000852  003 OF 003 
 
 
Palestinians and Arabs react to Obama's peace plan [which will be 
announced in Cairo] and to the serious American intention to 
participate in the peace process?  This time, I urge Arabs and 
Palestinians not to reject any provision of the plan.  Leave 
rejection to Israel because Obama is different from Bush.  He is 
more determined and more serious about achieving peace and can exert 
pressure on Israel.  The U.S. now is capable of containing Israeli 
extremism and restoring the U.S. role as mediator in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict - a role which was lost during the 
previous administration." 
 
 
2) Muhannad Abdil Hamid opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under 
the title, "How much longer will Netanyahu be arrogant towards 
Obama?"(05/26):  "Anyone who studies the policies of the U.S. and 
Israeli administrations will see how large the gap is between the 
policies regarding settlements, Jerusalem or the independent 
Palestinian state... We have learned over the years that we should 
not expect any changes in Israeli policy unless the U.S. exerts 
pressure on Israel.  So will Obama exert serious pressure on Israel? 
 If yes, then how & when?"
