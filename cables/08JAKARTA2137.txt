Jakarta, November 12, 2008 
 
Honorable Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
The U.S. House of Representatives 
235 Cannon HOB 
Washington, D.C. 20515 
 
Dear Honorable Pelosi: 
 
Allow me to congratulate you and the people of the United 
States of America for the astounding results of the election 
that has been inspirational as well as hopeful.  The 
Indonesian Parliament looks forward to a more committed 
United States to the Asian region especially to support the 
enhancement of democracy in the region. 
 
In Indonesia, the Parliament is fully committed to democracy 
enhancement by optimizing its functions in legislation, 
oversight and budgeting.  Following the fulfillment of the 
function we stand for the mission to build a political system 
based on the merit of good governance. 
 
In line with the objectives, Indonesian Parliament is 
undergoing reform aimed at improving and increasing effective 
parliamentary mechanism, and a committee on Parliament reform 
formed 3 years ago has been working closely with the U.S. 
House Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) mainly dealing 
with important issues such as legislation process, parliament 
budget, internal affairs, staffing and parliament supporting 
system. 
 
Continued cooperation of HDAC and the Indonesian Parliament 
is progressing and furthering on, and a Delegation of 9 
Members of Parliament concurrently also Parliamentary Reform 
Committee Members and 2 Staffs will travel for a study visit 
to Washington, D.C. from December 2 to 5, 2008, led by Deputy 
Chair of the Committee.  They seek the opportunity for 
in-depth discussion and exchanges with HDAC Leaders, Experts 
and Senior Staffs at the Capitol Hill on issues relating to 
parliament empowerment. 
 
Looking forward to the success of their visit, I would like 
to ask your support for the Delegation.  We hope that under 
your continued leadership cooperation between our two 
parliaments will steadily progress. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
/S/ 
 
HR Agung Laksono 
Speaker and Chairman of 
Parliament Reform Committee
