Summary 
----------- 
 
¶1.  Gazprom has announced plans for a pipeline from Sakhalin to 
Vladivostok that will begin pumping natural gas from the island 
to the Asia-Pacific region in 2011.  The pipeline will also 
provide gas to the Khabarovskiy and Primorye regions, and may 
connect with the proposed trans-Korean gas pipeline, which is 
scheduled to begin construction as the Sakhalin-Vladivostok is 
completed.  Khabarovskiy Kray Governor Ishayev expressed 
concerns that the new pipeline may disrupt supplies to his 
region. 
 
A Pipeline to Asia 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  Alexander Ananenkov, deputy chairman of Gazprom's Management 
Committee, announced at the Far Eastern Economic Forum in 
Khabarovsk that his company plans to construct a new pipeline 
from Sakhalin to Vladivostok that will help provide natural gas 
to Asia-Pacific markets.  The pipeline is scheduled for 
completion in the third quarter of 2011 and will likely connect 
with the trans-Korean gas pipeline, should that project come to 
fruition (reftel). 
 
¶3.  Ananenkov stated that the pipeline will initially be 
supplied by gas from the Sakhalin I and Sakhalin II projects. 
It will reach full capacity once gas production at Sakhalin III 
begins in 2016 and the Chayanda gas field in Yakutia is fully 
operational.  Exxon's Sakhalin I project has estimated 
recoverable reserves of 485 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 
Gazprom-controlled Sakhalin II holds 500 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas, and Sakhalin III's Sea of Okhotsk reserves hold 
more than 900 billion cubic meters. 
 
Governor:  What About Us? 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Khabarovskiy Kray Governor Viktor Ishayev has expressed 
concern about the plan.  The region currently holds a contract 
which commits Gazprom to providing 2.5 billion cubic meters now 
and 4.5 billion starting in 2010.  Ishayev questions the overall 
production capacity of the Sakhalin facilities, and has 
expressed concern that Gazprom may divert promised supplies to 
other markets including Primorye and Asia.   Gazprom has stated 
that once all three Sakhalin projects and Chayanda are online, 
capacity will even exceed demand. 
 
¶5.  Natural gas to Khabarovskiy Kray industry is currently 
supplied through an existing pipeline that runs from Sakhalin 
through Komsomolsk-na-Amure to Khabarovsk.  That pipeline was 
built by and had been owned by the Kray until 2006, when Gazprom 
paid 10.4 billion rubles to take it over.  The old pipeline will 
continue to operate together with the new one, though Gazprom 
says it is in need of renovation. 
 
¶6.  Also at the Economic Forum, State Duma Chairman Boris 
Gryzlov suggested future expansions to the project.  He proposed 
that once the pipeline has made its way to Vladivostok in 2011, 
it should be continued to other regions, such as Amur, Magadan, 
and Jewish Autonomous Oblasts and Kamchatskiy Kray.  He went on 
to say that "despite the West's disinformation campaigns against 
us, Russia remains a reliable partner in delivering energy 
resources to the world." 
 
Comment 
------------ 
 
¶7.  The new project should help Russia increase natural gas 
supply to its Asian partners.  Once the pipeline achieves full 
capacity, there should be enough gas to supply both the domestic 
and Asian markets, as Gazprom contends.  To do so, however, 
would require actually getting the Yakutia field hooked into the 
pipeline and will be a difficult and lengthy process.  If supply 
limitations lead to conflict between Governor Ishayev and 
Gazprom, the Khabarovsk region is unlikely to win.
