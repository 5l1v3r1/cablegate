¶1. (SENSITIVE) SPAIN:   MFA confirms that Spanish 
citizens have the right to enter Spain regardless of 
the validity (or absence) of passport or other identity

passports as valid for return for a period of six 
months beyond the expiration date.

return of their citizens with expired passports for a 
period of six months beyond the expiration date 
specified in the passport.  The Andorran government 
does not have an agreement with the United States. 
For the purposes of INA 212(a)(7)(B)(small i)(I), 
Andorra should be included in the list of countries

as valid for return for a period of six months beyond 
the expiration date.
