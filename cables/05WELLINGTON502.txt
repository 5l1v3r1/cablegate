¶1. Post delivered ref B demarche points to to Vicki Poole, 
Global Group Program Manager at the NZ Agency for 
International Development (NZAID); Dr. Mark Jacobs, Director 
of Public Health in the Ministry of Health; and the Americas 
Division of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade. 
 
¶2. On behalf of all these agencies, Poole responded that in 
June 2005 New Zealand made further contributions of NZ$1.5 
million (US$1.05 million) to the global Polio Eradication 
Initiative (PEI).  This figure includes NZ$1.0 million 
(US$700,000) donated through UNICEF and NZ$500,000 
(US$350,000) through New Zealand Rotary International.  These 
contributions are in addition to New Zealand's total PEI 
contributions of NZ$1.6 million (US$1.1 million) in 2003 and 
NZ$200,000 (US$140,000) in 2004, and reflects NZAID's October 
2004 commitment to strongly consider the PEI in its future 
funding rounds (ref A).
