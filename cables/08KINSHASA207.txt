SUBJECT: Congolese foreign minister concerned about timing of FDLR 
resolution 
 
Ref:  State 16195 
 
¶1. (SBU) Foreign Minister Mbusa Nyamwisi told us February 21 he 
agreed with the idea of an UN Security Council resolution on the 
FDLR but had concerns about its timing.  Mbusa is the Congolese 
signatory to the Nairobi communique with Rwanda, and has been 
working to organize a meeting with FDLR faction leaders as part of 
the "sensitization" campaign the Congolese government committed to 
in the communique.  He expressed concern that a resolution adopted 
by the Security Council prior to or immediately following the 
meeting could play into FDLR members' worst fears and hamstring the 
campaign to persuade them to lay down their arms. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mbusa asked that adoption of a resolution be delayed until 
around two weeks after the meeting.  He noted the meeting with FDLR 
factions would take place in Kisangani, and target FDLR splinter 
groups at odds with the group's hardline leaders.  He said that a 
date had not yet been agreed, but speculated on an early March 
timeframe.  (Note:  We understand from other sources that a 
committee at the foreign ministry has been working for some time 
behind the scenes to lay the groundwork for the meeting.  End 
note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mbusa appealed for timing the adoption of the resolution 
for around two weeks after the meeting.  Under the scenario above, 
he recommended a target date of late March.  He said that if the 
Security Council adopts a resolution before the meeting it would 
scare participants away; too soon afterward would be seen as a slap 
in the face for those leaders who had spent political capital to 
participate. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mbusa left the following day on extended travel.  We plan 
to follow up with him on his return.
