I'd like to thank you both for taking time to recognize the 
work of Ambassador Wolff and Molly Phee, and the rest of the 
USUN Mission, for their excellent efforts to negotiate a 
consensus text for the renewal of the mandate for the UN 
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). 
Ambassador Wolff and Molly Phee are both exceptional 
officers, and I have an outstanding team at USUN working 
tirelessly to promote U.S. interests before the UN.
