SUBJECT:  PSI:  SHIPMENT OF U.S.-ORIGIN TEST EQUIPMENT TO SYRIA VIA 
THE UAE - REVISED DELIVERY/DISCHARGE SCHEDULE 
 
REF:  (A) State 13872 AND (B) EMBASSY ABU DHABI - STATE FEB 3 E-MAILS 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Post delivered non-paper with container numbers to MFA on 
Sunday, February 3, DCM raising subject with Asst U/S for 
International Cooperation.  Econchief followed up with the Ministry 
of Interior's coordinator for combating trafficking in WMD Major 
Mohamed Al-Kitbi and the MFA representative to the UAE's 
Counterproliferation Task Force Yacoub Al-Hosani.  Both committed to 
pursuing the issue.  Al-Kitbie wondered about the choice of routes, 
noting that the route (Canada - UAE - Syria) was logistically 
complicated and likely to be more expensive than a direct route. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  ICE office in Dubai has subsequently learned that the 
subject containers (MSCU8768579, SEAL # 6044820 & MSCU9905362, SEAL 
#6044821) were shifted in Antwerp from the MSC Jordan 40R to the MSC 
Joanna 704A on January 29.  MSC Joanna 704A is scheduled to arrive in 
Jebel Ali port, UAE, between February 10-12.

assumed transshipment by surface to Syria. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Post would appreciate receiving relevant shipping 
documents from Commerce via fax:  971-2-414-2567.
