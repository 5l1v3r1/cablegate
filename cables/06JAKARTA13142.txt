REF: JAKARTA 12874 (TIMIKA DEFENDANTS REFUSE TO 
     RESPOND) 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On November 7, Judge Adriani Nurdin sentenced 
Anthonious Wamang to life in prison for premeditated murder 
in connection with the August 31, 2002 murders of two 
Americans and one Indonesian in Timika, Papua.  Although 
prosecutors had requested 20 years, Judge Nurdin cited 
several considerations in exercising her prerogative to 
impose a heavier sentence.  First, she said that the evidence 
presented in court showed that Wamang had continued to shoot 
even though he had realized that the victims were civilians, 
not members of the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI).  This, 
Judge Nurdin said, was a severe violation of human rights. 
Secondly, Judge Nurdin said that the defendants' behavior in 
court amounted to obstruction of justice.  Despite the 
court's attempts to meet the defendants' demands, they had 
refused to cooperate with the proceedings.  Finally, she said 
that Wamang had carried out his crime as a member of a banned 
organization, the Papuan Independence Organization (OPM). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Judge Nurdin sentenced Agustinus Anggaibak (AKA 
Johnny Kasomol) and Yulianus Deikme to seven years each for 
participating in premeditated murder.  She sentenced the 
other defendants - Hardi Sugimol, Ishak Onawatme, Esau 
Onawatme, and Yairus Kiwak - to eighteen months for aiding 
and abetting an act of violence.  These sentence are somewhat 
less than those recommended by prosecutors, who had called 
for 15 years for Angaibbak and Deikme, and eight years for 
the other co-defendants. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Central Jakarta courtroom was packed with press 
and noisy demonstrators.  The session was also attended by 
Patsy Spier, the widow of Amcit victim Rick Spier.  The 
defendants walked out before Judge Nurdin read the 
three-judge panel's verdict. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment.  From our point of view, this is an 
excellent outcome.  In the coming days, we will research how 
long Wamang is likely to spend behind bars; it may not be 
life per se, but will be a very long time.  Although the 
defense lawyers have announced their intention to appeal, 
their prospects for success are remote.  Since the defense 
made no effort whatsoever to challenge the evidence against 
Wamang and his co-defendants, they will likely rely on 
political and procedural arguments which are unlikely to 
receive a sympathetic hearing.  End comment.
