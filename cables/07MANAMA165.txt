¶1. (SBU) Iraqi Ambassador Ghassan Mohsen told the Ambassador 
that the planned Iraqi commercial exhibition "Iraqi Expo 
2007" (reftel), scheduled to take place March 24 - 26 in 
Manama, has been postponed.  Mohsen said that planning for 
the fair had been disrupted by the kidnapping of the Iraqi 
organizer.   Although the organizer had since been released, 
it was now deemed too late to put the fair on as scheduled. 
Mohsen surmised that lackluster interst in the Gulf may have 
also contributed to the postponement. (Comment: competition 
from a similar exhibition in Amman may have also been a 
factor.)  He said that it was hoped that the exhibition will 
be rescheduled for the fall. 
 
¶2. (U) Post will provide any updates regarding the 
rescheduling of this event when such information becomes 
available.
