SUBJECT: DCM OBSERVES MUHAMMAD'S BIRTHDAY AT MARBELLA MOSQUE 
 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: During a visit to the Costa del Sol in 
Andalucia, the DCM toured Marbella's beautiful Rey Abdelaziz 
Al-Saud Mosque and, at the prompting of Imam Alla Bachar, 
gave impromptu remarks to the assembled congregation of 
approximately 50 believers on March 31.  Alla Bachar gave a 
sermon rooted in the common history of Islam, Judaism, and 
Christianity and the need for mutual respect and 
understanding among these faiths.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U)  As part of post's continued Muslim engagement effort, 
the DCM visited the Rey Abdelaziz Al-Saud Mosque on March 31 
at the invitation of Imam Alla Bachar.  Built by Saudi Prince 
Salman bin-Abdelaziz al-Saud in 1981, the mosque was the 
first new Muslim place of worship constructed in Spain since 
the 15th century.  It is also known as the Al-Risalat mosque. 
 Situated on a 10,000 square-meter site overlooking the 
Mediterranean Sea on Marbella's western edge, the picturesque 
mosque's Andalucian architecture and surrounding gardens 
invoke the splendor of classical Islamic sites in Spain. 
 
¶3. (U)  Imam Alla Bachar, who has been imam in Marbella since 
the mosque's construction, greeted DCM at the entrance to the 
mosque and brought him inside the musalla, where to DCM's 
surprise approximately 50 congregants (including women and 
children) were seated together in a horseshoe awaiting his 
arrival.  Unlike the Spanish occupants of high Marbellan 
society, the attendees were middle to lower-middle class; the 
women wore hijabs without veils.  Although there were some 
Spanish converts, the majority were North African immigrants. 
 The attendees then prayed in observance of the Prophet 
Muhammad's birthday. 
 
¶4. (U)  Bachar then delivered a positive and constructive 
sermon that emphasized the common threads that run among the 
three religions of Abraham, the importance of Moses' ten 
commandments, and the special place In Islam of Jesus the 
Prophet, who first introduced a conception of paradise. 
Bachar stopped to note that paradise was for those who were 
good and righteous, however, not for people who commit 
monstrous crimes in this world.  Bachar mentioned the 
principle of turning the other cheek, also introduced by 
Jesus.  He noted that almost the entire congregation of the 
mosque were guests in Spain and that as guests it is proper 
to follow the rules of the host.  He noted that Spain has 
provided them with the right to worship as they please and 
they must in turn respect the laws and traditions of the 
Spanish people. 
 
¶5. (U)  Bachar asked the DCM to offer some words to the 
congregation.  The DCM spoke of his and his wife's own 
experience as immigrants to the United States and of how 
immigration is a key part of the American experience.  The 
DCM noted that the U.S. is a country made up of peoples from 
all different races, ethnic groups, and religions. The U.S. 
prides itself on respecting all cultures and religions and 
derives strength from its diversity.  He went on to describe 
the Muslim community in the U.S. and how it has made enormous 
contributions with its strong commitments to family, values, 
work ethic, and entrepreneurship. 
 
¶6. (U)  After the prayer service, the congregation adjourned 
to another room for tea and pastries, where the DCM engaged 
with the congregants for about 30 minutes before departing. 
While he received a somewhat wary reception in the musalla, 
the congregants were far more engaging toward him after the 
service. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  COMMENT: Imam Alla Bachar has a daughter studying 
in Orlando who he said has had a very positive experience in 
the United States.  He said that her impression of the United 
States was radically different from the caricatures often 
portrayed in European and Arab media.  The DCM found Bachar 
to be a serious and dedicated individual and would encourage 
involving him in further engagement events where possible. 
While most of those present were North African, some Saudis 
were also in attendance, which is not surprising as Marbella 
has long been a popular playground for wealthy Arabs.  END 
COMMENT.
