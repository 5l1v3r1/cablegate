¶1.  (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche to Jean-Michel Bour, 
Deputy Director of European and International Affairs of France's 
Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) August 23.  Bour took note of the 
U.S. request for support, but stopped short of indicating how France 
would vote.  He reminded Econoff that it was U.S. practice not to 
announce support for ICAO candidacies in advance of votes.  He 
argued that there was nevertheless a "principle, or least a 
practice" of mutual support of candidacies by Permanent Members of 
the UN Security Council in elections to UN system organizations. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The French delegation will be headed by Didier Lallement, 
Director General of the DGAC, who will be present from Sept. 21-24. 
It will include as deputies Ambassador Jean-Christophe Chouvet, 
French Permanent Representative to ICAO, and Jean-Francois Vivier, 
Inspector General of the DGAC.
