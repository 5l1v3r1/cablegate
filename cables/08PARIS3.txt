Foreign Minsiter Kouchner, Ambassador Stapleton delivered

Kouchner indicated his overall agreement with them.  The next

Pakistan.  (NOTE: In an op-ed in center-right daily Le Figaro 
on December 30, Kouchner called on Europeans to renew their 
commitment to supporting democracy in Pakistan and to 
fighting terrorism.  END NOTE.)  We also passed reftel points
