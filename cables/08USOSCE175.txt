¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  At the July 8 JCG meeting, Germany 
(Schweizer) supported by France, UK, Portugal, Turkey and the 
U.S., raised the issue of Russia refusing Germany's request 
to conduct a CFE inspection.  Germany stated its concern that 
the Russian Federation was not implementing the CFE Treaty 
and its non-compliance would lead to full erosion of the 
Treaty.  The supporting States Parties called for Russia to 
end its suspension of CFE Treaty implementation and accept 
the parallel actions package.  France (Simonet) used some 
strong language by "deploring" the actions of the Russian 
Federation.  In response to the statements against Russia, 
JCG Arms Control Rep Ulyanov stated that the prospect for a 
mutually acceptable solution was remote and urged the 
discussions of parts of the parallel actions package be held 
in Vienna.  Ulyanov also claimed that Russia did not seek to 
"disaggregate" the package.  Spain read a summary of Session 
II of the Annual Security Review Conference.  The U.S. 
offered its condolences to Russia for the loss of one of it 
long-time Vienna delegates, Alexander Ivanov.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)   Under the Chairmanship of Luxembourg (Pilot), 
Germany, under instructions from Berlin, delivered a lengthy 
intervention on Russia's refusal of a German CFE inspection 
that was to have started on July 8 in Russia.  Germany noted 
that it would continue to fully implement the Treaty, however 
the longer Russia continues with its current suspension, the 
more the likelihood that it would lead to full erosion of the 
Treaty.  The Allies have given specific proposals in the 
parallel actions plan as written in the March 28 NAC 
Statement.  In concluding, Germany noted that "all" were 
waiting for a Russian response. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Some Allies spoke in support of the German 
statement: 
 
-- France (Simonet), associated itself with the German 
statement and said it "deplores the actions of the Russian 
Federation."  France continued by calling for the Russian 
Federation to comply with its Treaty obligations. 
 
-- U.S. (Neighbour) stated that the U.S. fully supported the 
German statement and Germany bringing this issue to the 
attention of the JCG.  Neighbour also noted that this was the 
eleventh inspection Russia had refused, as well as other acts 
of non-compliance such as their failure to provide the Annual 
Exchange of Information, quarterly reports on Kushchevskaya, 
and other notifications in accordance with the Protocol on 
Notification and Exchange of Information for force changes. 
The U.S. too called for Russia's renewed cooperation, full 
compliance with its Treaty obligations and for Russia to 
engage seriously on the parallel actions package. 
 
-- UK, Portugal and Turkey supported or aligned themselves 
with the German statement and urged Russia to engage in the 
parallel actions package. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Russia (Ulyanov) responded by lamenting that 
unfortunately the  prospects for a mutually acceptable 
solution were remote.  Russia has called for serious dialogue 
and it had fallen on deaf ears.  A decisive role could be 
taken by the JCG as depicted in Article XVI of the CFE 
Treaty, but was blocked as well as the dialogue in the 
NATO-Russian Council Arms Control Experts group.  With all 
the other potential forums for discussion closed, only the 
U.S.-Russia bilateral venue remained.  Russia continued to 
criticize the United States for meeting it only twice so far 
in 2008.  Considering the number if issues at hand, even if a 
breakthrough were possible the time required to negotiate a 
final package would be tremendous.  Ulyanov proposed that 
regular working meetings in Vienna supplement the U.S.-Russia 
bilateral discussions. 
 
-- The U.S. (Neighbour) explained the U.S. position regarding 
no negotiations on the package in Vienna and noted that it 
was in fact the Russian Federation that has come to bilateral 
meetings unprepared to address the substantive issues. 
 
-- Ulyanov countered, saying that he could not agree with the 
U.S.'s assessment and that the Russian Federation has always 
been ready to have serious dialogue and that Russia had 
fulfilled all of its promises and proposals submitted on 
Moldova and Georgia in January 2008.  He noted that the 
picture "drawn" by the U.S. was not realistic.  Ulyanov 
summarized his statement by saying that the Russian 
Federation did not plan on dissecting the parallel actions 
plan but work on it as a whole package.  He again insisted 
that the U.S. and its Allies must talk here in Vienna. 
 
--  The U.S. questioned Russia's intent and stated that if 
Russia was serious it would agree to the Parallel actions 
package in New York in July at the next bilateral meeting 
between the U.S. and Russia.  Russia should not seek to 
"cherry-pick" parts of the package for discussion in Vienna. 
 
--  Russia noted that this was a useful exchange and that 
Russia did not want to look at the parallel actions package 
piecemeal, but as a whole.  For this it will take time and 
time was available in Vienna.  Ulyanov claimed Russia did not 
seek to "disaggregate" the package. 
 
-- Neighbour closed the discussion by noting Ulyanov's 
comment that Russia would not seek to to "disaggregate" the 
parallel actions package and calling for Russia to formally 
agree to the package which would allow the States Parties to 
move forward. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Spain (Mor Sola) read a summary Spain had written 
concerning Session II of the Annual Security Review 
Conference (JCG.DEL/21/08).  There was no discussion 
generated. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The U.S. passed its condolences to Russia for the 
loss of one of it long-time Vienna delegates, Alexander 
Ivanov, who passed away within a month of his diagnosed 
cancer.   A moment of silence was observed. 
 
¶7.  (U)  The next JCG will be July 15 and Chaired by Moldova.
