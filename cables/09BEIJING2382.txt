  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  THE MIDDLE EAST 
 
"The U.S., Russia, and the EU start another round of chess in the 
Middle East" (pg 3) 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (08/18): 
"Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with U.S. leaders will 
play a key role in the Middle East Peace Process.  The U.S. 
mediation role in the process is extremely important.  Big players, 
including the U.S., Russia, and the EU, are fighting to win over 
this region.  The U.S. has emphasized that its new Middle East 
policy aims at achieving a full peace in the region.  The U.S. is 
unwilling to cede leadership on Middle East issues to Russia. 
Therefore, there are significant challenges to holding an 
international meeting in Moscow to discuss these issues. 
Comparatively, as a result of many years of active diplomatic 
effort, the EU has established a rather good image in the region. 
The U.S. needs the EU's support for Obama's 'new Middle East 
policy.'  It is hard to tell at this time what the prospects are for 
the Middle East Peace Process." 
 
¶2.  NORTH KOREA 
 
"U.S.-South Korean military drill no longer focused on 'invasion of 
Pyongyang'" (pg 8) 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (08/18): "Though the U.S.-South Korean joint 
military drill is being conducted as a computer simulation and no 
longer envisions an invasion of Pyongyang, North Korea is still 
vigilant about it and has implemented a 'special military alert.' 
The drill has aroused a lot of attention since the South Korean 
military will for the first time play the leading role.  In 
conducting this drill, both the U.S. and South Korea have adopted a 
low profile.  The goal this time is not as aggressive as in previous 
drills: U.S. and South Korean troops are only practicing an advance 
up to 'South Pyongyang' rather than an 'invasion of Pyongyang.' 
Analysts argue that the drill is being conducted in a low-profile 
manner to avoid irritating North Korea.  But such a large-scale 
military drill has still triggered a harsh reaction from North 
Korea.  Many anti-war organizations have also protested that 
military threats at present will not help the prospects for peace on 
the peninsula." 
 
¶3.  TAIWAN 
 
"By assisting Taiwan, U.S. military 'uses opportunity to send in 
troops'" (pg 6) 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (08/18): "On top 
of Taiwanese authorities' ineffective disaster relief efforts, the 
U.S. has used this opportunity to send military airplanes to Taiwan 
to help with disaster relief.  Since this action is highly 
sensitive, the U.S. military has been quite low profile about it. 
This is the first time U.S. military aircraft have landed on Taiwan 
in the name of 'humanitarian assistance' since Taiwan and the U.S. 
'cut off relations' in 1979.  'President' Ma Ying Jeou reacted 
slowly when facing this serious disaster.  Many Taiwanese people 
have compared the current situation with disaster relief efforts 
after the '9/21' (September 21, 1999) earthquake to highlight Ma 
Ying Jeou's inferior performance.   An official at the Taiwanese 
'State Security Council' said that the PLA has kept a close eye on 
Taiwanese military actions.  The Taiwanese military's slow disaster 
relief response may reveal weaknesses to the PLA and, consequently, 
influence Taiwan's security."
