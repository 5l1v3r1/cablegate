¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Based on apparent deficiencies in the 
accounting for night vision devices (NVDs) provided to Iraqi 
Security Forces (ISF), the Multi-National Security Transition 
Command in Iraq (MNSTC-I) is currently conducting a 
comprehensive field inventory of NVDs.  The intent of this 
inventory is to establish a baseline for the implementation 
of proper end-use monitoring of NVDs and to assess the 
current state of affairs with regard to accountability. 
MNSTC-I will engage MOD to ensure continued end-use 
monitoring of sensitive items. Embassy Baghdad Pol-Mil will 
report results of the inventory and continue to coordinate 
with MNSTC-I on behalf of the Blue Lantern program.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On August 12, Pol-Mil Officers attended a meeting 
of the Multi-National Security Transition Command in Iraq 
(MNSTC-I) to discuss ongoing end-use monitoring efforts, 
pursuant to reftel request.  Based on IG recommendations from 
inspections conducted in September 2007 and May 2008, MNSTC-I 
developed a compliance plan to implement requirements for 
end-use monitoring of sensitive items, e.g. NVDs, provided to 
ISF.  An end-use monitoring SOP has since been incorporated 
into the MNSTC-I Logistics SOP.  A follow-up IG inspection is 
scheduled for October 12, to evaluate proposed and recently 
implemented end-use monitoring procedures. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Additionally, MNSTC-I has developed comprehensive 
internal procedures for the tracking and inventory of 
sensitive items to ensure accountability of all on-hand 
sensitive items requiring end-use monitoring prior to 
issuance to ISF.  MNSTC-I is currently conducting a 
comprehensive field audit of NVDs provided to ISF in an 
effort to provide one hundred percent accountability of NVDs. 
 The audit is scheduled for completion by September 15. 
The audit will establish a baseline for future inventory 
control procedures and will allow for timely and accurate 
compliance with the auditing of sensitive items requested by 
reftel. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  MNSTC-I will engage with MOD to ensure continued 
compliance with end-use monitoring regulations.  In addition, 
MNSTC-I will draft a letter to MOD reiterating end-use 
monitoring procedures, outlined in a memorandum of agreement 
signed on November 18, 2005, and drawing attention to 
potential consequences of future non-compliance ) including, 
potentially, State,s withholding of end-user licenses. 
MNSTC-I will also provide guidance and training to 
responsible ISF personnel on inventory procedures and aid in 
development of a suitable system of accountability of NVDs. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Upon completion of the ongoing inventory, Pol-Mil 
Officers will reconcile items noted in reftel with on hand 
inventory and report results.
