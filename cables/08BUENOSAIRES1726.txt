SUBJECT: Argentina: Presidential Declaration of Argentina, Brazil 
and Venezuela Condemning all Forms of Discrimination 
 
¶1.  Argentine Ambassador to the United States Hector Timerman gave 
the Ambassador December 17 an unsigned copy of a joint declaration 
that he said was signed by Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de 
Kirchner, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva, and 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Brazil on the margins of the 
December 16-17 summit meetings.  The declaration condemns different 
forms of discrimination and intolerance. 
 
¶2.  Embassy's informal translation of declaration follows: 
 
Declaration of the Presidents of the Argentine Republic, the 
Federative Republic of Brazil, and the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela of Condemnation of Racism, Discrimination, Religious 
Intolerance, Racial Discrimination and other Related Forms of 
Intolerance. 
 
The Presidents of the Argentine Republic, the Federative Republic of 
Brazil and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela met in Costa de 
Sauipe, Brazil on December 16, 2008, and: 
 
Observe with serious concern that, at the outset of the third 
millennium, there are still a great many victims of racism, 
discrimination and religious intolerance, particularly anti-Semitism 
and anti-Islamism; racial discrimination, and other related forms of 
intolerance, and that in different regions of the world racist and 
discriminatory practices persist or have reemerged. 
 
Reaffirm the principles of equality and non-discrimination 
recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by the 
American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man, and recognize 
the elementary importance of the full compliance with the 
obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
 
Thus, the Presidents declare their most energetic condemnation of 
racism, anti-Semitism, anti-Islamism, racial discrimination and 
other related forms of intolerance, and renew their commitment to 
continuing working on the national, regional and international 
levels to reinforce the mechanisms of promotion and protection of 
human rights to assure their full observance, regardless of race, 
color, sex, religion, political opinions or any distinction 
whatsoever. 
End informal translation of joint declaration.
