SUBJECT: SUDAN:  IMPLEMENTATION OF BOYCOTT STATUTE RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 66895 
 
¶1.  Per reftel, Sudan does not require any firms to comply 
with Arab League or Organization of the Islamic Conference 
boycotts of Israel.  Sudanese and foreign firms are not 
required to complete boycott compliance questionnaires or 
furnish boycott-clearance certificates as a prerequisite for 
licensing, trademark or company registration, bidding on 
contracts, or as part of a contract. 
 
¶2.  Sudan does not as a matter of policy, practice, or 
contract requests require U.S. firms to comply with boycott 
requirements or provide information regarding such compliance. 
 
¶3.  Suppliers, vendors, and service providers with which Post 
does business are not known to comply with boycott 
requirements. 
 
¶4.  Sudan does have a law mandating a primary and secondary 
boycott of Israel.  The Israel Boycott Act of 1958 prohibits 
contracting with Israeli nationals or residents, or dealing 
with any company, Sudanese or foreign, that has an interest 
in Israel.  It also prohibits the import of Israeli-produced 
goods in any quantity or proportion, as detailed on a 
certificate of origin; it also bans the export or transit of 
goods to Israel.  Violations of the law may be punished with 
ten years in prison or a fine not exceeding five thousand 
Sudanese pounds. 
 
¶5.  Sudanese passports are routinely endorsed "valid for all 
countries except Israel," and Sudan normally denies visas to 
foreign travelers with Israeli visas in their passports. 
However, this does not seem to be required by the Israel 
Boycott Act of 1958, and the legal basis for these policies 
remains unclear. 
 
¶6.  The Ministry of Foreign Trade is in charge of boycott 
enforcement, but it does not have a separate unit to handle 
boycott issues.  The Ministry's Multilateral Trading 
Department does have contacts with Syria's Arab League 
Boycott Office, which provides the Ministry with updated 
information on the boycott. 
 
¶7.  Mr. Abdel Aziz M. Ahmed, Head of the Ministry's 
Multilateral Trading Department, told Post that he regards 
the boycott as "ineffective," because most Arab countries now 
have business connections with Israel.  Post is not aware of 
any Government of Sudan actions to enforce the boycott, 
though Mr. Ahmed did note that Sudan is one of three Arab 
countries that have no direct or indirect business ties to 
Israel, along with Syria and Yemen. 
 
¶8.  Post will forward a copy of the Israel Boycott Act, 1958 
to EB/L separately.
