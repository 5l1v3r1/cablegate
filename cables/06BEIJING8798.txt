U.S.-China Cooperation on North Korea, Iran, Taiwan 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  During the regular May 11 MFA press briefing, 
several reporters asked about Deputy Secretary 
Zoellick's statements in his May 10 testimony to the 
House International Relations Committee on China's 
role in resolving the North Korean and Iranian nuclear 
issues, as well as on U.S. Taiwan policy.  MFA 
Spokesperson Liu Jianchao asserted that both Beijing 
and Washington support resolving the DPRK nuclear 
issue through the Six-Party Talks in order to realize 
a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula at any early date and 
maintain regional stability.  North Korea and the 
United States are now in a state of confrontation over 
financial issues, which have created certain 
obstacles, Liu remarked.  China is prepared to promote 
the early resumption of the Talks and hopes relevant 
parties, particularly those who are most involved, 
take practical steps to remove the obstacles to the 
Six-Party Talks.  Noting remarks by "U.S. officials," 
Liu argued that China has made contributions to ensure 
a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and promote the Talks, 
adding that China also hopes for a prosperous and 
stable North Korea. 
 
¶3.  Beijing and Washington are holding discussions on 
the Iranian nuclear issue, Liu noted.  China strongly

supports the protection of the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime and the enhancement of 
diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue peacefully. 
Liu called on all the parties to exercise restraint 
and launch a new round of diplomatic efforts. 
Regarding the application of sanctions, Beijing does 
not favor "bitterly resorting to the use or threat of 
force" in dealing with international affairs, he 
remarked. 
 
¶4.  Liu stressed that the United States is fully aware 
of Beijing's position on Taiwan.  China hopes 
Washington will strictly abide by its one-China 
principle, the Three Joint Communiques and commitment 
to "oppose" Taiwan independence.  The United States 
should also cease military sales to and military 
exchanges with Taiwan in order to safeguard cross- 
Strait peace and stability and maintain positive U.S.- 
China relations. 
 
Admiral Fallon's Visit 
---------------------- 
 
¶5.  Asked by the Bloomberg correspondent about Admiral 
Fallon's visit to China, Liu asserted that military- 
to-military relations are an important component of 
the U.S.-China relationship.  The MFA supports 
exchanges between the two militaries, which should 
help enhance mutual trust, he stated.  Admiral Fallon 
met Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan and also plans to 
visit Xi'an, Hangzhou and Shenyang. 
 
U.S. Treasury Report 
-------------------- 
 
¶6.  Asked by the UPI correspondent to comment on the 
decision released in the recent U.S. Department of 
Treasury report not to designate China a currency 
manipulator, Liu remarked that China has taken a 
highly responsible attitude in this area.  Beijing has 
taken steps in reforming the RMB exchange rate based 
on the actual economic conditions of China and the 
region.  China will continue its exchange rate reform, 
increase the flexibility of the RMB and strengthen 
risk management capabilities in order to maintain the 
stability of the RMB in a rational manner, he said. 
 
Chen's Libya Transit 
-------------------- 
 
¶7.  Responding to the Xinhua reporter's inquiry into 
Chen Shui-bian's recent transit through Libya, Liu 
remarked that despite China's opposition and urgings, 
Libya insisted on approving Chen's stopover and also 
discussed the establishment of representative offices. 
These actions severely violated Libya's commitment to 
its one-China policy and negatively affected China- 
Libya relations.  Beijing has expressed its 
dissatisfaction and calls on Libya to cease all forms 
of official exchanges with Taiwan in order to protect 
the overall interests of bilateral ties. 
 
Yu Jie's Washington Visit 
------------------------- 
 
¶8.  Asked about Chinese activist Yu Jie's reported 
meeting with President Bush, Liu noted the media 
report and asserted that China protects its citizens' 
freedom of religious belief.  This is an 
internationally recognized fact to which China hopes 
relevant parties will pay attention, he stated. 
 
Potential China-Japan FMs Meeting 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Asked by the Kyodo correspondent what are the 
necessary conditions for a China-Japan foreign 
ministers' meeting, Liu stressed that visits by a 
"handful of Japanese leaders" to the Yasukuni Shrine 
have created obstacles to the normal development of 
bilateral ties.  China wishes to remove these

obstacles and improve relations.  Beijing and Tokyo 
are discussing a possible meeting between the two 
foreign ministers, Liu stated, highlighting that China 
hopes Japan will recognize its sincerity to better 
relations.  Asked about the Japanese Government's 
plans to invite Chinese students to visit on an 
exchange program, Liu said that China appreciates 
Tokyo's efforts to promote cultural exchanges and 
friendship between the two countries, particularly 
among youth, and stands ready to enhance such 
cooperation. 
 
Dalai Lama 
---------- 
 
¶10.  Asked about the Dalai Lama's recent trip to South 
America and Xinhua reports that he inspired a conflict 
between Tibetan monks, Liu argued that the Dalai Lama 
is not purely a religious figure but rather a 
political exile engaged in separatist activities.  The 
Dalai Lama "clique" has never abandoned its 
independence position.  The Chinese Government opposes 
the Dalai Lama's conducting separatist activities in 
the international arena under the "pretext of 
religion," Liu remarked.  China hopes relevant 
countries remain very alert. 
 
Human Rights Council 
-------------------- 
 
¶11.  Questioned by the Middle East News Agency 
correspondent about China's plans as a newly elected 
member of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), Liu noted 
that China received 146 of 191 votes.  China's 
election will help promote the global human rights 
cause and China's own human rights situation. 
 
UNSYG Annan's Visit 
------------------- 
 
¶12.  Liu announced that UN Secretary General (UNSYG) 
Kofi Annan will visit China May 19-23 and meet with 
President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and State 
Councilor Tang Jiaxuan.  China and the UNSYG maintain 
close contact and both expect the visit to cover 
important international issues, including the DPRK 
nuclear issue, Liu stated in response to a question on 
the specific visit agenda. 
 
Cultural Revolution Anniversary 
------------------------------- 
 
¶13.  Asked by the AFP correspondent to comment on the 
upcoming 40th anniversary of the beginning of the 
Cultural Revolution, Liu remarked that the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) has already reached a conclusion 
on the Cultural Revolution that can be found in CCP 
documents.
