Dear Mr. Secretary, 
I thank you for your letter dated 21 November 2002 soliciting 
Turkey's support for a strong resolution from the IAEA Board 
of Governors next week addressing North Korea's acknowledged 
nuclear weapons program. 
We share the concern regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons 
program and agree with the need for a resolute response to 
urge North Korea to verifiably dismantle its nuclear weaperns 
capabilities it is putting in place. 
I have accordingly instructed our Permanent Delegation in 
Vienna to join the like minded countries in supporting a 
resolution at the IAEA Board of Governors to that end. 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
/S/ 
Yasar Yakis
