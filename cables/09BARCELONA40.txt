SUBJECT: REGIONAL PRESIDENT WEIGHS FIRING TOP SECURITY ADVISORS OVER 
AGGRESSIVE POLICE DURING STUDENT PROTESTS 
 
BARCELONA 00000040  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Scores were injured - many of them police 
and journalists - March 18 after the Mossos d'Esquadra (Catalan 
regional police) broke up a student protest at the University of 
Barcelona.  An investigation is underway to determine how and 
why the incident turned violent.  The students were protesting 
implementation of a European-wide higher education system also 
known as the "Bologna Plan".  Counselor for the Interior 
(Minister-equivalent) Joan Saura and Mossos Director Rafael 
Olmos declared officers generally followed the correct 
procedures, but some mistakes were made.  Both Saura and Olmos, 
could lose their jobs over the incidents, which one university 
professor labeled, "Franco Era" tactics.  Opposition party 
leaders blamed Saura, a Green Party member, for not leading the 
police properly.  Rank and file officers within the force blamed 
him for sending them mixed signals of support.  This is not the 
first time the Mossos have been accused of over aggressive 
behavior, and they will have little time to recover as students 
expect to continue their protests in the coming days.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
 
Protest Breaking Up 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) At least 60 people, including police and journalists, 
were injured March 18 when Catalonia's regional police, Mossos 
d'Esquadra, entered the University of Barcelona campus to remove 
more than 50 student protestors.  The students had been holed up 
on campus for months protesting the Spanish government's plan to 
implement a European-wide higher education system, the so-called 
"Bologna Plan".   The students were being removed because they 
had reportedly violated an agreement made with the University's 
director that they would not block other students from returning 
to class. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The removal of the protestors began smoothly, however, 
the situation turned later turned violent when the protestors 
returned with a so-called "radical minority" of more aggressive 
students.  According to reports, the police "disproportionately" 
responded; hitting students with clubs in an effort to disperse 
the increasingly agitated crowd.  Several journalists were also 
injured during the violent outbreak.  According to witnesses, 
several students were seen throwing bottles and chairs at 
police, "to defend themselves".  Counselor for the Interior 
(Minister-equivalent) and Green Party member, Joan Saura, told 
reporters there were 56 injuries, 32 of which were suffered by 
police. The director of the Mossos, Rafael Olmos, accepted full 
responsibility for what had happened.  He noted that changes 
would be made to police protocol to ensure that this kind of 
thing would not happen again. Despite assurances several months 
ago by Saura that Mossos officers would be required to display 
identification numbers, none did, making it difficult to 
identify individual officers who had behaved inappropriately. 
 
 
 
Answer Demanded 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Opposition party and police labor union officials 
called on regional president Jose Montilla to either fire Saura 
or, at least take responsibility for security issues away from 
him.  Police labor union officials also complained that Saura 
did not adequately defend its rank and file members in his 
statements to the press.  So far, Montilla is standing by his 
man.  In a statement he said he would have preferred that the 
removal of the students not turn out the way it had.  He did 
agree, however, to pursue and investigation into the matter. 
One University of Barcelona professor said that the actions 
taken by the Mossos reminded him of Franco era police actions. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:   Allegations of heavy-handedness, or worse, 
abuse, by the police is not new in Catalonia.  Last summer, the 
Mossos were forced to put security cameras in one of its most 
heavily trafficked police stations, and police were still caught 
abusing suspected criminals prompting charges and suspensions. 
It is clear authorities are finding it hard to walk the line 
between an appropriate response and being overly aggressive.  As

a result, protestors have gone out of their way to provoke 
violence.  Still, even as students called for another round of 
protests, there are signs that unity within their ranks is 
cracking.   A group wanting to attend classes confronted the 
more radical protestors calling for them to allow access to the 
university.  This could offer city and police authorities the 
cover they need to end the standoff peacefully.  Meanwhile, 
opposition party leaders, who have never been happy with Saura 
at the helm, continue to put the pressure on Montilla to fire 
him.  Saura is rumored to have agreed to sacrifice Olmos, 
instead.  There is little doubt that greater scrutiny of police 
procedures will result no matter what action Montilla takes. 
End Comment.
