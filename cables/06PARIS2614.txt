SUBJECT: FRENCH UNLIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS UN FINANCIAL 
SHORTFALLS FOR ELECTION COSTS IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 57541 
 
¶1.  On April 12 reftel points were delivered to French MFA 
Afghanistan Desk Officer, Cyril Gerardon.  Gerardon said that 
he was not optimistic that France would make a contribution 
to offset Afghanistan election cost shortfalls, noting that 
it would be more difficult now to generate enthusiasm for the 
project given that the parliamentary elections had already 
taken place.  He added that the current economic climate in 
France ensured that contributions in excess of what France 
has already pledged would be difficult to secure in any case. 
 
 
¶2.  Gerardon said that he would nonetheless refer the issue 
to the office of Arnaud Danjean in FM Douste-Blazy's cabinet, 
with whom he had shared the points, to see if a portion of 
the necessary funding could be provided. He was doubtful, 
however, that the GoF would be able to contribute more at 
present or in the immediate future.
