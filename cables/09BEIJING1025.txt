¶1. MILITARY 
 
"U.S. conventional military strength ranks NO.1 in the world; Obama 
is not silly or naove" 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated with the 
official Communist Youth League's China Youth Daily (04/17):  "On 
April the 5th, the U.S. President, during his speech in Prague, said 
that the U.S. will promote a nuclear weapons free world. This 
proposal reflects the democrat's belief, however, it contradicts 
with the current nuclear strategies of the U.S. This is a part of 
Obama's propaganda campaign as well as a clear signal of the new 
'Obamaism'.  This big military strategy change will bring 
significantly and positively influence control over global nuclear 
and military situations. 
However, Obama's suggestion may not be good for world peace.  Once 
major countries destroy their nuclear weapons, America's 
conventional military strength will become more outstanding in the 
world, which is obviously not good for global peace.  Therefore, the 
world is waiting expectantly to see whether or not the U.S. is 
willing to reduce its conventional military strength accordingly. 
Furthermore, the differences between nuclear weapons and 
conventional weapons will become more unclear.  Therefore, a 
'nuclear-free' proposal can't solve all these issues.  The most 
urgent issue for the U.S. is 'how to gain the trust of the world?' 
There have been some suggestions.  First, America could pay more 
attention to the role of multilateral and international regulation 
and adjust its unilateral global strategy.  Second, the U.S. could 
bear more international obligations. Third, the U.S. could focus on 
the accurate implementations of soft power and gradually get rid of 
it's over dependence on hard power, including its military strength. 
Fourthly, the U.S. could observe and solve global issues from the 
perspective of its power limitations rather than its advantages." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"[Editorial] U.S. should abolish the Taiwan Relations Act" The 
official Communist Party international news publication Global Times 
(Huanqiu Shibao)(04/17):  "This Act has always been a "stumbling 
block" for the stable development of U.S.-China relations, eliciting 
distrust between the two countries. Since cross-straits relations 
have improved and U.S.-China relations have entered into a stable 
stage, the Taiwan Relations Act should be abolished. 
The establishment of this Act has left potential troubles.  U.S. 
never stops selling arms to Taiwan under this Act. The Act also 
reflects the two-sides of America's China policy. On the one side, 
the U.S. Congress always restrains the China policy made by the 
American administrative authorities, while, on the other side the 
administrative authorities utilize this Act to conduct its 
containment strategies under the cover of Taiwan issues.  The U.S. 
has indulged the "Taiwan independence" trend.  Moreover, this Act 
poses a serious threat to the peace, safety, and stability in the 
West Pacific region. The more benefits that the arms merchants can 
get the more dangers it may bring.  U.S.-China relations have become 
one of the most important bilateral relations in the world and the 
future global peace and development will greatly rely on the 
strategic coordination between China and the U.S.  The Taiwan 
Relations Act is not in the interests of both the Chinese and the 
American people."
