This cable contains an Action Request - see comment. 
 
---------- 
KEY POINTS 
---------- 
 
-- "Silatech" ("Your Connection" in Arabic), a one-year-old 
Arab youth employment initiative founded and funded by the 
Qatari Amir's consort Shaykha Mozah, is preparing for its 
second summit, June 8-9 in Doha. 
 
-- The summit will be used to announce new commitments to the 
initiative and enhance networking among governments, the 
private sector, and civil society groups working on 
addressing Arab youth unemployment, according to the 
organization's CEO Rick Little. 
 
-- Little told us Silatech wants to be receptive to the new 
Obama Administration, and would welcome the USG playing a 
"supporting but not dominant role" in the initiative. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
-- Embassy believes Silatech is worthy of engagement by USG 
organizations and officials working in the field of youth 
employment in the Arab world.  Such engagement would help 
synchronize USG regional activities with those of this 
well-funded initiative which is supported by key individuals 
and organizations, including the United Nations, 
International Labor Organization, World Bank, and U.S. 
companies such as Cisco. 
 
-- As a first step, engagement could involve meetings or a 
video-conference with Silatech staff by MEPI, USAID, and/or 
others working in this field.  This would pave the way for 
possible USG involvement in the June summit.  The proposed 
Congressional field hearing at Education City (Ref A) would 
also be a natural vehicle for Congress to learn more about 
Silatech and regional initiatives to combat Arab youth 
unemployment. 
 
-- POC for follow-up on this recommended engagement is 
Economic Officer David Fabrycky, available at Tel: 
974-496-6731; Fax: 974-496-6709; Email: FabryckyDA@state.gov. 
 
End Key Points and Comment. 
 
¶1. As reported reftel, Silatech is a year-old 
organization/initiative intended to "engage the private, 
public, and civil society sectors to promote large-scale job 
creation, entrepreneurship, and access to capital and 
markets."  The initiative is the brainchild of the Amir's 
consort Shaykha Mozah Bint Nasser Al-Misned (the Chairperson 
of the Qatar Foundation, which is the home of Education City 
and six branch U.S. universities).  The royal couple has 
personally donated USD 100 million to Silatech as seed 
capital. 
 
¶2. CEO Rick Little (an American citizen) said Shaykha Mozah 
is very engaged with the organization through her position as 
Chair of the Board of Trustees.  The Board also includes 
luminaries such as former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, 
Chairman of the Financial Times Sir David Bell, Cisco 
Chairman and CEO John Chambers, former Irish President Mary 
Robinson, and Chairman of Tata and Sons Ratan Tata.  The 
staff includes several Amcits. 
 
¶3. The organization says it will focus on three areas: 
-- Improving access to skills training and placement 
services, micro and small and medium-sized enterprises' 
access to capital, business development services and markets. 
-- Promotion of policies to stimulate increased employment 
and enterprise opportunities. 
-- Improving the "mindset" in the region to improve society's 
recognition and support for youth employment. 
 
DOHA 00000159  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶4. To accomplish these goals, Silatech says it intends to: 
-- Provide thought leadership - to stimulate the design of 
comprehensive local youth employment strategies and programs 
based on best practices and cutting-edge research. 
-- Mobilize investment - to assure large scale impact. 
-- Provide innovative technologies - to facilitate skills 
development, job placement, access to markets and to achieve 
economies of scale. 
 
¶5. To implement this vision, the June 8-9 summit in Doha is 
intended to "unveil a range of new (financial and 
programmatic) commitments," according to Little.  Silatech 
has decided to focus for now on pilot projects in six 
countries: Syria, Yemen, Morocco, Tunisia, Bahrain, and 
Qatar.  Details and the stage of development of these 
projects are unclear, though Little mentioned pending 
formation of banking consortiums to mobilize capital.
