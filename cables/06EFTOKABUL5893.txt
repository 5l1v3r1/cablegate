Â¶1. (SBU/NF) Deputy Econ Counselor delivered reftel 
information to First Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of 
Afghanistan Samiullah Ibrahimi and MFA Director of 
Multilateral Affairs Naseer Andisha on December 16.  Andisha 
acknowledged Afghanistan's obligations under UNSCR 1373 and 
promised to forward the list to appropriate GOA authorities. 
Ibrahimi indicated that he would bring the list to his bank 
supervision department for action, but commented that the 
Central Bank had not yet issued an order to search and freeze 
accounts under Afghanistan's new Anti-Money Laundering law. 
 
2.(SBU/NF) COMMENT:  The Anti-Money Laundering law explicitly 
grants the Central Bank the authority to instruct banks to 
identify specific accounts and freeze them; however, the 
Central Bank has not yet developed procedures to implement it 
or defined clear delineations of authority to issue such an 
order.  Post therefore expects that it may take some time for 
the Central Bank to respond to this demarche.  Post will 
follow up with the Central Bank to determine if it issues 
instructions to banks.  END COMMENT.
