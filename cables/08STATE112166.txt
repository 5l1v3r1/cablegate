consignee in Singapore. 
 
¶4. ACTION JAKARTA: Embassy is requested to make inquiries 
with appropriate Indonesian Air Force (IAF) officials to

¶5. ACTION SINGAPORE: Department requests that Embassy conduct

general reliability as a recipient of United States Munitions 
List (USML) items.  POC for TXS is M. Ludia Wati, Director, 
TEL: 65-632-99-679, Reference Purchase Order #

following questions are offered as suggested guidance with 
TXS: 
 
- Can TXS provide documentation from the IAF (e.g. purchase 
order, contract, or letter of intent) establishing it as the 
final end user of these items? 
 
- Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-export and retransfer? 
 
- What is the company's exact role in these transactions? 
 
- Who are the company's main clients?
