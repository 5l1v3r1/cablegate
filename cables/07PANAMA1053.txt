Need Quick, Peaceful Resolution in Kosovo 
----------------------------------------- 
 
"The situation in Kosovo is tense and fragile, making a quick 
and peaceful resolution of the problem all the more 
important," Panamanian Acting FM Ricardo Duran told 
Ambassador on June 21 in response to Ambassador's delivery of 
reftel demarche.  Unaware that France had tabled a new draft 
resolution, Duran undertook to meet with the MFA's UNSC team 
with whom he would share the USG's points and concerns. 
(Note:  Post received a copy of the draft UNSCR earlier in 
the day from the MFA working level.)  Ambassador noted that 
to date Panama had supported the resolution and underscored 
that now we were looking for Panama's active public 
endorsement.  Post provided Duran a copy of the draft UNSCR 
as well as a non-paper of the talking points contained in 
reftel.
