In Today's Papers 
 
EU Report Praises Turkey's Kurd, Armenian Moves 
Media outlets report the EU Commission's annual enlargement report 
to be made public October 14 praises the government's 'Kurdish 
democratic initiative' and the dialogue with Armenia.  Papers report 
EU sources expect Ankara to use the six-week period until the 
release of the report to take forward steps regarding the Kurdish 
question.  A statement released by the EU term president Sweden has 
also welcomed Turkey and Armenia moving toward each other. 
 
Papers report the EU report lauds a regulation for the trial of 
military officials by civilian courts; welcomes the launch eight 
months ago of Kurdish-language TV broadcasts on state-owned TRT-6 
television; supports the Kurdish democratic initiative process; and 
mentions briefly Turkey's Armenia move.  The EU report, however, 
slams Turkey over the ruling party exerting pressure on the media, 
over the fact that ties between the military and civilians were far 
from the EU standards, that Turkey has not opened its ports to Greek 
Cypriot vessels, and that the Halki Seminary has not been opened 
yet. 
 
Rehn Welcomes Turkish Government's Kurdish Move 
Papers report the EU Commissioner for enlargement, Olli Rehn, said 
the Turkish government's Kurdish move topped the list of important 
issues going on in Turkey.  Rehn expressed pleasure over the move, 
but stressed the EU expected concrete action from the government. 
Rehn said the EU had to see whether the Turkish government could 
offer an initiative to the southeast that would bring economic and 
social development as well as expand language and cultural rights. 
 
 
Reactions to Armenian Protocol 
Sabah, Milliyet, Vatan, Radikal, Yeni Safak, Haber Turk and others: 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that, commenting on Turkish protocol for 
normalization of ties with Armenia at his party group meeting, main 
opposition party CHP leader Deniz Baykal said his party will not 
support the protocols between Turkey and Armenia until Armenian 
occupation of Azerbaijani territory is over.  Mainstreams Hurriyet 
and HaberTurk report that deputy chairman of the MHP Oktay Vural and 
Mehmet Sandir said that PM Erdogan might be nominated for a Nobel 
prize by the Western countries for supporting their projects like 
Kurdish opening and Armenian opening.  Democrat Party chair 
Husamettin Cindoruk, on the other hand, claimed that the Armenian 
initiative is an initiative that was directed by President Obama 
during his speech at the Turkish Parliament.  Liberal Radikal 
reports that the EU, in Turkey's progress report praised a series of 
reform steps.  Milliyet reports that EU enlargement commissioner 
Olli Rehn delivered a speech in European Parliament's Commission for 
Human Rights yesterday.  Rehn praised the protocol initialed by 
Turkey and Armenia and described the protocol as very important sign 
of improvement. 
 
Editorial Opinions on Turkey-Armenia 
 
Oktay Eksi wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "The government describes 
its goal of zero problems with neighbors which calls for a miracle 
to happen for any government in any given country.  One wonders how 
this miracle will occur for Turkish-Armenian relations and how to 
convince Baku especially after pronouncing the Karabakh issue as a 
condition for normalization." 
 
Ali Bayramoglu wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "Normalization 
with Armenia will facilitate a better relationship and cooperation 
model in the Caucasus.  Turkey will be a key regional player on 
bilateral grounds as well as be a facilitator between Europe and the 
Caucasus region." 
 
Kadri Gursel wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "This is the time to talk 
about realities as opposed to fantasies. The Karabakh issue is the 
name of a domestic political power game between the ruling party and 
 
ANKARA 00001299  002 OF 003 
 
 
the opposition in Baku.  Therefore it is hard to expect Baku to be 
happy about Turkey-Armenia rapprochement without seeing a solution 
on Karabakh.  However Turkish diplomacy should be working on 
convincing Baku on the bare realities.  Working on a settlement for 
Karabakh is one thing, but on the other hand going back to the 1992 
conditions, i.e. status quo ante, is not possible at all." 
 
Cem Sey wrote in leftist Taraf: "Ankara made a brave decision by 
proceeding on the Armenia normalization process, and took a big 
risk.  There is no chance for Ankara to push for settlement on 
Karabakh on either sides.  Unless the Western powers, the U.S. and 
EU, keep up their promise and impose a solution that is acceptable 
for both Baku and Yerevan, the Turkey-Armenia process cannot go 
anywhere." 
 
At White House Iftar, Obama Praises Islam and Religious Freedom 
Obama's Iftar plays well for Muslim outreach, while his comments 
regarding religious dress draw attention from the staunchly secular 
and the Islamist-oriented outlets.  Liberal Radikal headlines, 
"Obama Praises Islam at The Iftar."  Mainstream Sabah notes, "Obama 
showered praise on Islam," as "he drew attention to the level of 
Muslims' participation in the U.S."  Mainstream Hurriyet reports in 
"Obama's Turban Opening," that U.S. President Barack Obama said an 
Arab-born student in Oklahoma served as "an example" by suing her 
university for the right to wear the hijab at school. 
Islamist-oriented Zaman headlines, "Obama Praised the Headscarf 
Struggle," and notes, "Obama emphasized that tolerance is a value in 
the United States." 
 
Scandal at the U.S. Embassy Amid An Intensifying War in Afghanistan 
 
Media note that the latest U.S. security firm scandal has hit the 
U.S. Embassy in Kabul at a most inconvenient time.  Mainstream 
Hurriyet reports, "As the attacks intensify against NATO forces from 
Taliban extremists, allegations of hazing have emerged at the U.S. 
Embassy in Kabul."  Mainstream Sabah reports in "Scandal at the U.S. 
Embassy," that "a private security firm named ArmorGroup engaged in 
sexual abuse and maltreatment of its employees" at a time when, "The 
war in Afghanistan is worsening and the headquarters of the U.S. 
Mission is in trouble," due to this scandal.  Sabah also says "It 
wasn't as bad as Abu Ghraib," but, "The State Department is 
investigating the allegations."
