SUBJECT:  KAZAKHSTAN: EXTENSION OF THE PHASE OUT PLAN FOR 
SOCIAL SECTOR AND SECURITY/LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE 
 
Ref: State 52411 
 
¶1.  The social transition and security/law enforcement 
sectors of assistance to Kazakhstan are slated for phase-out 
in 2011, per the country's phase out assessment.  As such, 
post understands that phase out plans must be prepared in 
2006, five years before the expected phase out date, to 
ensure that assistance will appropriately move the country 
toward achievement of phase out goals. 
 
¶2. According to reftel, post is required to submit the phase 
out plans for the social transition and security/law 
enforcement sectors to EUR/ACE by July 1.  Post respectfully 
requests an extension of this due date until October 1.  The 
purpose for the extension is to allow post to finalize the 
USAID assistance strategy and obtain its approval before 
drafting the phase out plan.  This will ensure that the 
phase out plan is consistent with the strategy and that it 
identifies the priority focus areas of USG engagement to 
achieve social sector phase out, as planned.  This will also 
give the numerous agencies and offices implementing security 
and law enforcement assistance programs sufficient time to 
coordinate their approaches, while at the same time 
transitioning to Astana.
