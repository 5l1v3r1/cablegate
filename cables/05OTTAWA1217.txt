SUBJECT:  EVALUATION FOR A DVC ON THE U.S. NATIONAL 
ELECTION (10 NOVEMBER 2004) TRACKERS 22495 & 22496 
 
 
¶1.   DESCRIPTION: Anne E. Stone, President, the Stone 
Group (Political Consultants) and Craig Charney, 
President, Charney Research gave a one hour, one 
country (Embassy and four constituent posts) DVC on the 
subject: "U.S. National Election: the results are in - 
A look back at the campaign and a look forward at U.S. 
foreign policy." 
 
¶2.   DATE, FISCAL YEAR, AND QUARTER: November 10, FY 
2005; First Quarter. 
 
¶3.   JUSTIFICATION/OBJECTIVE: Canadians are very keen 
followers of the U.S. elections due to the close 
relationship between the two countries. Many 
Issues common to both countries will be affected by the 
results of the election. In 2000, PA Canada organized 
some very successful election programming, and Posts 
would like to take advantage of the interest in the 
2004 national election to do the same. 
 
¶4.   MPP THEME:  Mutual Understanding (MU); public 
diplomacy (PD).  AUDIENCE REACHED: The DVC was well- 
attended at all Posts, and guests included a cross- 
section of federal and provincial government officials, 
academics, think tank representatives, and members of 
the media. The speakers were praised for their opening 
and closing statements together with their responses 
which were informative, useful and concise. All 
audiences appreciated the candor with which Ms. Stone 
and Mr. Charney talked about the campaign and the voter 
turnout. The information on the U.S. electoral process 
was very useful to quite a few members of the audience 
as it differs considerable from that in Canada. 
 
¶5.   QUALITY OF U.S. SUPPORT: Excellent. John Jasik, as 
usual, filled the moderator's role very competently, a 
task that is crucial to the smooth running of the 
program. 
 
¶6.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION:  Excellent.  Post expresses 
its appreciation to IIP for its assistance in the 
realization of this program.
