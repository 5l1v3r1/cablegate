¶1. PRM acknowledges receipt of the P-1 referrals and 
authorizes processing of the six cases (35 individuals) noted 
in reftels. DHS/USCIS has concurred in this approval. 
 
¶2. PRM has coordinated with OPE Istanbul and DHS/USCIS to 
arrange for processing at the earliest possible date, 
currently scheduled for the weeks of January 20th for OPE 
pre-screening and February 2nd for DHS adjudication.  Be 
informed that any additional referrals requested for 
processing at that time would need to be submitted no later 
than OOB in Washington January 13th. 
 
¶3. As with all referrals, PRM cannot guarantee these 
individuals will be approved for resettlement in the United 
States.  Only DHS/USCIS can make that determination based on 
a personal interview.  These individuals will also have to 
meet other admissibility requirements including a medical 
examination and security clearances before they can be 
admitted as refugees.
