¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche on June 13 to Lourdes 
Puma Puma, MFA Director General for Multilateral Affairs. 
Puma expressed GOE's skepticism regarding the various 
proposals contained in the initiative, noting that in the 
past, such practices were designed to link political 
preferences of major donor nations to UNDP audits.  That 
said, the GOE is willing to consider the new proposals with 
"an open mind". 
 
¶2. (SBU) Puma noted that the GOE does feel that there were 
irregularities in UNDP's DPRK program and is willing to have 
those examined further, independent of any further reforms to 
UNDP practices.
