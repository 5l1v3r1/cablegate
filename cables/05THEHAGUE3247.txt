Classified By: Charge D'Affaires Chat Blakeman, 
reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
¶1. (C) The GONL is not/not interested in selling F-16s to 
Pakistan -- either directly or through the United States. 
Dutch MOD State Secretary Cees van der Knaap told Charge and 
ODC Chief December 2 that the re-sale issue is very clear: 
the Dutch will not sell F-16s to Pakistan, and will not be 
associated will any re-sale to Pakistan.  Van der Knaap added 
that the Dutch were looking at selling additional F-16s to 
Jordan beyond the three previously agreed to planes. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶2. (C) Van der Knaap was well-versed in the state-of-play in 
Belgium and the United States on the possible F-16 re-sale to 
Pakistan.  Charge pushed van der Knaap, suggesting there 
might be some wriggle room (as indicated ref A) if the deal 
was done discretely.  Van der Knaap replied that "there is no 
issue for the Dutch -- we will not sell F-16s or other 
weapons to Pakistan" that could potentially reach Kashmir. 
For example, the Dutch would be willing to sell ships to 
Pakistan, but not F-16s.  While ref B was transmitted closely 
following the meeting with van der Knaap, the points were 
covered during the conversation.  Van der Knaap is the Dutch 
authority on arms transfers, and we take his stated position 
as authoritative.
