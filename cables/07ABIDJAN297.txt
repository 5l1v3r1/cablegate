ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 31831 
 
 Â¶1.  EmbOff demarched Ambassador Bernard Tanoh-Boutchoue, MFA 
Director of the Office of UN and International Organizations, 
concerning the U.S. position opposing certain elements of the 
UN General Assembly Fifth and Sixth Committees' 
recommendations on reform measures for the UN's internal 
system of justice.  As suggested by reftel, Boutchoue was 
somewhat surprised to hear arguments against the broad 
measures being contemplated, and was eager to review in 
detail the points the Department makes in that regard. 
EmbOff provided written translations of key points for the 
MFA's review.
