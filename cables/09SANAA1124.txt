SUBJECT: SPOT REPORT: ROYG WORKS TO PRODUCE QUALIFIED 
WORKERS FOR GULF MARKET 
 
¶1. SUMMARY.  The ROYG has developed a new strategy to provide 
Yemeni workers with training specifically tailored for the 
entry-level labor market in the Gulf.  The ROYG,s plans come 
after a May GCC decision to give Yemeni workers priority over 
other foreign workers in Gulf state employment.  An increase 
in the number of qualified Yemeni workers is not only good 
for the Gulf market, but also for Yemen and the future 
stability of the country.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  A series of cabinet meetings in early June resulted in a 
ROYG plan to provide 50,000 Yemenis with training 
specifically tailored to be marketable in the Gulf.  Mohamed 
Awadh Bin Rabiah, Deputy Minister for Planning and Projects 
at the Ministry of Technical Education and Training, told 
EconOff on June 9 that his ministry will focus on training, 
while the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor (MOSAL) will 
concentrate on coordination with the GCC.  According to 
Rabiah, the ROYG plan will initially focus on English 
language and computer skills, and will expand to other areas 
based on the labor market.  He said that 17,000 Yemenis are 
currently in vocational education, and that it would not be 
difficult to meet the goal of training 50,000 entry-level 
workers. 
 
¶3.  ROYG plans are in alignment with a May GCC decision to 
give Yemeni workers priority over other foreign workers in 
Gulf state employment.  In addition, Saudi Arabia has decided 
to favor Yemenis for jobs in the construction sector, as 
reported in the Yemen Times on June 3.  Still, Abdo 
Al-Hakimi, First Deputy Minister at MOSAL, told EconOff that 
he is skeptical about the Gulf,s ability to absorb Yemeni 
workers due to the global financial crisis, and that the ROYG 
needs specific requests for qualified entry-level workers 
from the Gulf labor market in order to provide Yemenis with 
appropriate training.  Hakimi admitted, however, that outside 
of the Gulf, there are few foreign markets for which Yemeni 
workers are suited. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4.  While Yemenis have long worked in the Gulf, they are 
rapidly being replaced with more qualified foreign workers. 
While the number of Yemenis to be trained is still small, an 
increase in qualified entry-level workers is not only good 
for the Gulf market, but also for the Yemeni market. 
Furthermore, the GCC commitment to Yemen, if realized, could 
lend much to the future stability of the least developed 
country on the Arabian Peninsula.  END COMMENT.
