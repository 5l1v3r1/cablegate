SUBJECT: BULGARIAN CHIEF PROSECUTOR DETERMINED TO SHOW 
SHORT-TERM RESULTS 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor James Bigus for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev told the Ambassador on 
September 12 that the EU report's criticism of Bulgaria's 
rule of law efforts was helpful and that the Prime Minister 
was determined to show progress in fighting organized crime 
and corruption before the next EU report is released in 
February.  Noting difficulties in convincing witnesses to 
testify, Velchev said he hoped to arrest key high-profile 
organized crime figures within a few days. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Though Velchev trusts and respects the new Interior 
Minister, he is convinced that the Interior Ministry (MOI) is 
"broken, corrupted and incapable of progress."  Velchev was 
bitterly disappointed to learn that the MOI has no evidence 
to show criminal activity by Bulgaria's 14 most notorious 
criminals.  Believing he has no other alternative, he relies 
on the new security agency, DANS, even though it lacks 
investigative capacity and must draw resources from its 
primary mission of counter intelligence and 
counter-terrorism.  As a long shot, Velchev has turned to the 
U.S. (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and Bulgaria's 
European partners for any information that may lead to 
prosecution against these known criminals. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment. Velchev's comments indicate that other GOB 
officials on their own are coming to the same damning 
conclusions about the state of the MOI.  (DOJ has completed a 
report that we will present to the Interior Minister next 
week.)  Velchev acknowledges the situation in the MOI is 
worse than he imagined and he sometimes seems overwhelmed by 
how deep the rot goes.  Many European embassies have given up 
on Velchev, complaining that he says the right things, but is 
incapable of following through.  He appears to be an honest 
man struggling under very difficult circumstances. End 
comment.
