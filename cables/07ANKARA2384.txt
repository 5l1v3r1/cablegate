SUBJECT: IBRAHIM PARLAK DEMARCHE REACTION: "OUR LAWS 
PROVIDE NO OPTION" 
 
REF: STATE 124882 
 
¶1.  We delivered reftel demarche urging issuance of a travel 
document enabling Ibrahim Parlak's return to Turkey.  Akil 
Oktem, head of the Department of Consular Affairs at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was familiar with the case.  He 
said the GOT has no travel document akin to the U.S. parole 
letter and that Turkish law provides no other viable option. 
"It's either issuance of a Turkish passport or nothing at 
all."  Because Parlak is now considered stateless by the 
Turkish government, they maintain they cannot assist. 
 
¶2.  Oktem indicated Parlak's only recourse would be to 
petition for reacquisition of Turkish citizenship, which 
could be submitted to the Embassy in Washington D.C.  The 
case would then be passed to the Ministry of Interior and if 
the request was felt to have merit, the petition would be 
referred to the Council of Ministers for approval. 
 
¶3.  Realistically speaking, were Parlak to enter a petition, 
it would be unlikely to get past the Ministry of Interior 
which, when contacted by the Embassy on this same issue 
previously, has indicated no flexibility.
