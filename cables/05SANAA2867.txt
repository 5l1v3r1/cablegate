1.(SBU) Embassy designated DCM Nabeel Khoury as Terrorist 
Financing Coordinating Officer as requested in Ref A cable. 
The DCM can be reached at phone number (967) 1-755-2212 or by 
email at khouryn-at-state.sgov.gov.  Econoff Noah Siegel will 
serve as post's working-level point of contact. Mr. Siegel 
can be reached at phone number (967) 1-755-2152 or by email 
at siegelni-at-state.sgov.gov. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The largest impediment to fighting terrorist 
financing in Yemen is lack of enforcement capacity and not a 
problem of public perception. (Ref B)  The anti-money 
laundering unit at the Central Bank of Yemen is understaffed, 
and requires extensive training and technical support.  As a 
result, commercial banks and hawala houses provide 
information to the CBY on a mostly voluntary basis.  CBY 
computers are not networked to each other, much less the 
broader banking system.  To address these deficiencies and 
strengthen the ROYG's ability to combat TF, post has sought 
funds from a variety of sources, including INL and the 
Terrorist Finance Working Group. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Despite the limitations, the ROYG is actively 
involved in MENA-FATF proceedings, and cooperates with other 
Gulf states to coordinate efforts.  Periodic meetings between 
regional TFCOs to correspond with MENA-FATF meetings would 
demonstrate to the ROYG a high level of engagement and help 
keep post current on regional issues.  Post would also 
welcome regional training for the Deputy TFCO.
