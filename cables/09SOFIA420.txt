Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Sutton for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (S)  SUMMARY.  In his first days in office, new Minister 
of Interior Tsvetan Tsvetanov, asked to see DCM Sutton and 
representatives of law enforcement agencies at post to seek 
our advice and stress his determination to make organized 
crime and corruption his top priority.  Aware that he 
inherits a dysfunctional and demoralized ministry, he has 
already begun firing the worst of the old guard and has begun 
the establishment of an organized crime task force in line 
with U.S. recommendations.  In his capacity as Deputy Prime 
Minister, he and the Prime Minister are preparing a major 
overhaul of the State Agency for National Security (DANS) 
starting with the removal of Chairman Petko Sertov. 
Tsvetanov has a solid track record as an honest cop and is 
one of the new Prime Minister's closest confidants.  While 
the challenge is Herculean, his political support, enthusiasm 
and openness to us makes real progress in law enforcement in 
Bulgaria possible.  END SUMMARY. 
 
REFORMING THE STATE AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY (DANS) 
 
¶2.  (S)  According to Tsvetanov, DANS Chairman Sertov will 
announce his resignation soon, prematurely ending his 5-year 
term.  As a close associate of former Prime Minister Sergei 
Stanishev, Sertov has long been criticized as a patently 
political appointment to what was intended to be an 
apolitical agency.  Tsvetanov said that Alexi Petrov, the 
PM's advisor on DANS, (a controversial figure widely 
criticized for alleged criminal connections) would also be 
forced to resign.  Tsvetanov stressed that he wanted to bring 
in the most trustworthy figures to fill these roles and 
sought the embassy's advice on candidates.  He also said he 
planned to considerably downsize DANS so as to avoid 
duplication of effort with the Ministry of Interior and to 
move DANS away from law enforcement and toward 
counter-proliferation, counter-narcotics and 
counter-intelligence functions. 
 
CLEANING HOUSE AT MOI 
 
¶3.  (S)  As one of his first acts in office, Tsvetanov fired 
Deputy Police Commissioner General Minko Braykov (the number 
two position in the national police hierarchy) who he 
believed had been connected with leaks of sensitive 
information and political interference in investigations. 
Tsvetanov emphasized that the new Deputy Commissioner General 
and his Deputy Ministers would be selected from a pool of 
younger, reform-minded thinkers with international 
experience, and he would not recycle old faces from previous 
administrations. 
 
BUILDING AN OC/CORRUPTION TASK FORCE 
 
¶4.  (S)  Aware that tackling organized crime and corruption 
cases will require resources outside of MOI, Tsvetanov said 
he will make improved interagency coordination a priority, 
and has already taken steps to initiate a multi-agency 
organized crime task force along lines suggested by the 
embassy.  Particularly, he said his office will strive to 
improve coordination with the Ministry of Justice and the 
Prosecutor General.  He stressed that cooperation between the 
U.S. and Bulgaria on narcotics and money laundering is 
already strong, but he hoped it would continue to grow. 
 
¶5.  (S)  COMMENT:  Tsvetanov is backing up his pre-election 
rhetoric with action; he is clearly eager to cooperate with 
us and genuinely interested in achieving results.  We had an 
excellent relationship with him during his previous term in 
the MOI, and we expect this to continue in the new 
government.  Though he faces tremendous challenges in 
reforming a broken law enforcement system, he has gotten off 
to a great start.  He is looking for our support and he 
deserves it.
