¶1.  (SBU) In addition to conversations noted Ref A regarding UAEG aid 
to Afghanistan, Post reiterated Ref B request for assistance to 
ensure smooth 2009 Afghan elections as a diplomatic note.  The MFA's 
formal reply (text in para two) reiterates the UAEG's preference for 
humanitarian aid without political overtones.  This posture matches 
Assistant Under Secretary for Political Affairs Dr. Tariq al-Haidan's 
public statements in late November that UAEG pledges to Afghanistan 
stood at $550 million (2002-08) with a focus on infrastructure, 
health, and education.

elections.
