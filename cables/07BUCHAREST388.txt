Classified By: POL Counselor Ted Tanoue for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d).

¶1. (C) Deputy Polcons delivered per instructions reftel demarches (B-D) on April 4, to MFA Director for OSCE, Council of Europe and Human Rights Brandusa Predescu. In response to Predescu’s inquiry, Deputy Polcons confirmed that this demarche was separate from earlier ones (ref a). Predescu said she understood (per ref B instructions) that the USG was seeking "a political-level commitment," with additional details to follow depending on the GOR’s response. She noted that the new Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu, who is to be sworn in on April 5, may want to weigh in on the issue. Predescu also expressed interest in knowing further details about the detainees eligible to leave Guantanamo. She added that in the GOR’s formal response, following its inter-agency procedures, she will address the question regarding the presence in Romania of any of the relevant expatriate communities (as noted in "Objective C" in ref C).

¶2. (C) Informally — and off-the-record — Brandusa expressed dismay at this request. She said that domestic political considerations aside (i.e., the turmoil among Parliament, the Prime Minister and the President that has erupted since EU accession), Romania has already contributed a great deat to the GWOT. She noted the awkward timing of this request as well, in light of the recent European Council investigation of renditions and the controversy over the Romanian contractors detained by MNF-I.

¶3. (C) Comment: The MFA will likely abide by its formal, internal procedures to reconsider the U.S. demarche. We are not sanguine about a positive answer given the GOR’s repeated "no" response to our previous demarches on the same subject. Further demarches on this issue probably would be counter-productive. End Comment.
