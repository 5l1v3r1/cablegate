¶1.  (SBU)  UN Department of Political Affairs Asia and 
Pacific Division Director Lisa Buttenheim told Poloff August 
18 that Saudi Arabia has not formally requested an UNGA 
Special Session on the political and religious components of 
interfaith dialogue.  Poloff delivered the points contained 
in ref a and c to Buttenheim who had attended the World 
Muslim League Inter-faith Conference, July 16-18, in Madrid. 
She echoed the descriptions, contained in ref b, of the 
conference, saying that it had been thrown together very 
hastily but that the Saudis had pulled it off, likely because 
of the fact that King Abdullah was behind it and that was why 
participants had chosen to attend. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Buttenheim voiced concerns about the Madrid 
Conference's final document which she said was not agreed 
upon by the participants even though it begins, "We, the 
participants."  She speculated that was why the Saudi 
government had not yet sent the document to the 
Secretary-General, as they had the final document of the June 
Islamic Conference in Mecca.  Buttenheim suggested that the 
Saudis do not know what they want -- a special session or 
just UN endorsement of a document.  She stressed that a GA 
resolution is required to call for an UNGA special session. 
Neither she nor USUN is aware of any efforts by the Saudi 
mission in New York to table such a resolution.  Buttenheim 
noted that a high-level meeting could be tagged on to an 
existing agenda item in the UNGA but that would require 
consultations with the President of the General Assembly 
(PGA).  She was not aware of any consultations by the Saudi 
Mission with the PGA.  Buttenheim stressed that logistically 
there was no way such a high-level meeting could be held 
before November, if even then. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) While Buttenheim noted that the Secretary-General 
wants to be supportive of King Abdullah's initiative, he does 
not want to own it.  She suggested that maintaining King 
Abdullah's initiative in the NGO sphere, through the Muslim 
World League, might be the best course of action.  While the 
Muslim World League does have Consultative Status as a NGO in 
ECOSOC, she mentioned that it is in danger of being suspended 
for not submitting a required report, according to the 
Committee on NGOs.  If Saudi Arabia decides it does want to 
formally proceed with its initiative at the UN, either 
through the Muslim World League or as a member state, it 
would have to justify to other member states, Buttenheim 
raised, how its initiative differs from a number of 
already-existing initiatives on similar subjects.  For 
instance, she noted that Saudi Arabia is not listed as a 
Friend of the Alliance on Civilizations, while other Gulf 
Cooperation Council states are part of that group.
