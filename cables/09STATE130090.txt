SUBJECT: (U) REQUEST FOR EMBASSY LONDON TO DELIVER RESPONSE 
FROM SECRETARY CLINTON TO FOREIGN SECRETARY DAVID MILIBAND: 
SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  Please see paragraph two. 
 
¶2. Background and Action Request:  On November 24, the 
Secretary sent letters to countries that participate in 
the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee - the primary coordinating 
mechanism for foreign donor assistance to the Palestinian 
Authority (PA) - asking that they take "extraordinary 
measures" to help the PA meet its end-of-year budget 
deficit.  Foreign Secretary Miliband responded on December 8 
by announcing that the United Kingdom will allocate GBP 11.5 
million (approximately $19 million) to the PA this month.  If 
disbursed in this calendar year, the new assistance would bring 
the UK'stotal contribution to budget support in 2009 to almost 
$48 million.  The Department requests that Embassy London deliver 
Secretary Clinton's response to the Foreign Secretary included 
in paragraph three.  There will be no signed original to follow. 
 
¶3. Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Foreign Secretary: 
 
Thank you for your letter dated December 8 informing us 
that the United Kingdom will allocate an additional GBP 
11.5 million in emergency budget support to the Palestinian 
Authority (PA) this year.  Your timely action demonstrates 
clear support for President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad 
at a critical time in our efforts to relaunch negotiations 
toward the establishment of a Palestinian state and the end 
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
 
I am pleased to announce that on December 14, the United States 
completed the transfer of an additional $75 million in budget 
support to the PA as an advance on our projected contribution 
of budget support in fiscal year 2010.  With the support of 
Congress, we decided to frontload part of our assistance in 
response to a direct appeal from Prime Minister Fayyad to help 
meet his end-of-year budget deficit.  We will continue to press 
other donors to make good on or increase their commitments of 
budget support to the PA this year, and we appreciate your help 
in leveraging additional support from European donors. 
 
I welcome your efforts to establish a memorandum of 
understanding with the PA regarding the UK's 2010 
assistance.  As you rightly suggest, we must ensure that 
donor assistance becomes more transparent and consistent 
so that the PA can escape the near monthly cycle of fiscal 
crisis and have sufficient liquidity to pursue its 
institutional and economic development agenda.  This has 
been one of our core messages to donors and should be a 
priority item on the agenda of the next Ad Hoc Liaison 
Committee meeting.  What we seek with our latest 
contribution of budget support, and what we will continue 
to do through all of our assistance efforts, is to ensure 
that the PA has the tools and the resources necessary to 
build the institutions of a state that will serve the 
Palestinian people most effectively. 
 
Thank you again for your leadership, 
 
Sincerely yours, 
 
 
Hillary Rodham Clinton
