¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel talking points to Igor Maydanov, 
Director of the Office of International Cooperation at the Ministry 
of Natural Resources and Ecology.  On December 11, in a written 
response from the same office, Acting Director Anatoliy Totskiy 
wrote that Russia is conducting an interagency review of the 
proposed amendments to protocols of the Convention on Long-Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) and has not yet agreed on an 
official position. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Totskiy noted that the Government of Russia must consider 
the possible financial and economic ramifications of its vote, as 
various Russian entities with differing levels of financial 
resources would be responsible for Russia's implementation of the 
protocols.  He warned that "any attempt to make the requirements 
broader or stricter will create additional difficulties in 
ratification."
