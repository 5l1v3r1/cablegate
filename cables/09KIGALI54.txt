 (SBU)  DCM and pol/econ chief met with Permanent Secretary 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Amandin Rugira to discuss 
Rwanda's UN delegation presenting the four Statements of the 
Case to the UNSC sanctions committee for listing (reftels). 
DCM noted that while Great Lakes Representative Joseph 
Mutaboba had already agreed to Rwanda doing so, the Rwandan 
UN delegation did not appear to have received instructions to 
that effect.  Rugira immediately agreed to instruct the 
Rwandan delegation to present the four cases, expressing the 
hope that more names would be presented for sanctioning by 
the Security Council.
