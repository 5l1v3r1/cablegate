¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Despite multi-faction agreement to 
enforce a ceasefire, violence continued (albeit at a reduced 
level) late May 17 through 1600 on May 18, with two 
Palestinians killed and at least 18 injured in factional 
clashes.  21 Qassam rockets landed in Israel since the last 
update (Ref A), causing three light injuries in Sderot and 
damaging several buildings.  Israeli retaliatory airstrikes 
and shelling have killed at least 8 more Palestinians, of 
whom 5 were members claimed by Hamas and, according to 
Palestinian security contacts, 3 were uninvolved in factional 
fighting or rocket activity, and injuring at least 23.  End 
summary. 
 
New Ceasefire Efforts Underway 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The National and Islamic Forces (NIF) (an umbrella 
committee for coordination between Palestinian factions) 
announced May 17 that they will send field teams across Gaza 
City and central Gaza to verify and enforce ceasefire 
compliance.  NIF committee member Isam Abu Duqqa told 
Palestinian television that an agreement to remove gunmen 
from Gaza's streets and rooftops is being implemented and 
they are negotiating to withdraw all gunmen, dismantle 
roadblocks, stop media incitement, and release kidnapped 
activists. 
 
Violence Reduced May 18, But Shooting Continues 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Late May 17, Hamas militants killed an National 
Security Forces (NSF) soldier and injured two others in an 
RPG/small arms assault on an NSF checkpoint in Gaza City. 
Hamas fighters shot and injured two General Intelligence 
(Mukhabarat) guards near the Mukhabarat HQ in Gaza City. 
Unknown gunmen shot and injured Fatah activist Ahmad al-Hasan 
in Gaza City.  In Khan Yunis, "Executive Force" members 
seized the police car and weapons of Khan Yunis police chief 
Farid al-Akhras and beat his bodyguard.  In Rafah, unknown 
gunmen shot and injured a sports club coach, motive unknown. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Early May 18, Hamas military-wing and NSF fighters 
exchanged heavy fire around al-Rimal neighborhood and at the 
NSF HQ in Gaza City (no injuries reported), while Preventive 
Security (PSO) guards and Fatah gunmen fought Hamas militants 
near the Islamic University and al-Nada Tower.  (Note: Fatah 
officials publicly claimed March 18 that Hamas gunmen are 
stockpiling weapons and ammunition inside Islamic University. 
 End note).  Palestinian security forces (PASF) contacts 
report Hamas gunmen attacked two Fatah members leaving 
prayers at Anwar Aziz mosque in Jabaliya, and a bystander (a 
young boy) was injured in the ensuing gunbattle.  A 
fisherman, Samir al-Mu'di, was shot and killed at 1515 local 
in an exchange of fire between Fatah and Hamas gunmen on a 
beach near Gaza City.  There are continuing reports of both 
Fatah and Hamas activists being kidnapped. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Fatah and Hamas leaders traded public accusations 
of aggression and incitement May 17-18.  President's Office 
officials told Palestinian press late May 17 that President 
Abbas has canceled his planned trip to Gaza in response to 
specific threats against his convoy and the discovery of 
explosive in a drainage tunnel under Salah al-Din Road. 
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum denied any attempt to 
assassinate Abbas.  He accused Fatah and PASF of fabricating 
threats to incite public opinion against Hamas and prevent 
Abbas from taking steps to reduce fighting.  Barhum also 
condemned Fatah Deputy PM Azzam al-Ahmad's statement that the 
"Executive Force" is illegal and should be disbanded.  Fatah 
Central Committee member Faruq al-Qadumi commented to 
Arabic-language press from Tunis late May 17 that hardline 
Hamas PLC member Mahmud al-Zahar is frustrating ceasefire 
efforts in contrast to PM Ismayil Haniyah and Damascus-based 
Hamas leader Khalid Misha'al whom he called "true partners 
for Fatah." 
 
Qassam Barrage Continues 
------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) 21 Qassam rockets struck Israel since the last 
update (Ref A).  Hamas claimed 4 additional launches, but 
there are no reported impacts in Israel.  Rockets struck 
Sderot and neighboring Kibbutzim, Be,eri, Nahal Oz and south 
of Ashkelon, causing three light injuries in Sderot and 
 
JERUSALEM 00000929  002 OF 002 
 
 
damaging a house, gas station, factory and synagogue there, 
and starting a fire in a Negev agricultural area. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Palestinian security contacts report at least 8 
Palestinians were killed in multiple Israeli strikes 
throughout Gaza since the last update (Ref A).  Hamas reports 
five dead and, Rafah municipality reports an Israeli missile 
destroyed a city garbage truck, killing two brothers, and 
injuring at least 23.  Contacts say 10 of the 23 were 
bystanders uninvolved in the fighting.  Contacts also report 
Israeli shelling of Shujaya (Gaza City area) but no 
casualties. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Violence decreased compared to May 15-17, but there 
is no indication that inter-factional ceasefire efforts are 
succeeding, and funerals for those killed in previous days' 
clashes are generating anger and incitement, which could also 
have an escalatory effect.
