 Â¶1. (SBU)  The U.S. Embassy in Berlin finds no negative U.S. 
foreign policy implications for the proposed award of FDA 
Research Grant Entitled "Phase 2/3 Study of FX-1006A for 
Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy."  The Embassy understands 
that this grant began in 2007 and that there are already ten 
patients involved in the study in Munster. ECONOFF spoke with 
the research professor who confirmed that the rights and 
welfare of the human subjects are being protected and that 
the monitoring plan to ensure data integrity is also good. 
Professor Hartmut Schmidt said that this was the first drug 
of its kind and that his patients are already benefitting 
from it.
