SUBJECT: PKK VIOLENCE: PRESS REPORTS 12 TURKISH SECURITY 
FORCES KILLED OVER PAST TWO WEEKS 
 
REF: ANKARA 2903 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. According to press reports -- many of them supplemented by 
television coverage of soldiers' funerals -- 12 members of 
the Turkish security forces were killed in incidents of PKK 
violence over the two-week period of May 22 through June 4. 
These reports also claim 23 security forces were WIA.  Eight 
PKK terrorists were KIA, and five were either captured or 
surrendered to Turkish authorities.  In separate incidents, 
two children stepped on mines which the PKK planted -- one 
was severely injured, one lightly wounded.  Another report 
claimed a PKK bomb damaged a natural gas pipeline operated by 
the Turkish Petroleum Pipeline Corporation (BOTAS) in the 
eastern province of Agri. 
 
¶2. Many of these incidents occurred in the southeastern 
province of Sirnak, though others were also reported from the 
eastern provinces of Bingol, Agri, Kars, Van, Diyarbakir, and 
Elazig.
