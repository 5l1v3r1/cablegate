REF: 3/6/09 EUR/ERA EMAIL (GIAUQUE) 
 
¶1. Polchief met with Klaus Famira, MFA European 
correspondent, March 11 to discuss the agenda items for the 
upcoming GAERC and GYMNICH.  Famira offered the following 
views: 
 
-- Montenegro: The GOA is in favor of submitting Montenegro's 
EU application to the European Commission for its formal 
opinion, and will advocate that position at the GAERC. 
However, some EU members prefer to delay action due to the 
economic crisis. 
 
-- Belarus: GAERC participants are unlikely to reach a 
decision on whether to invite Belarusian President Lukashenka 
to the May 7 EU Summit launching the Eastern Partnership 
Initiative.  The consensus within the EU is that the decision 
should not be made until shortly before the Summit, probably 
in late April.  GAERC participants will discuss whether to 
lift the travel restrictions on Belarusian officials or 
extend the suspension of the restrictions for another six 
months, and will likely decide on the latter. 
 
-- Sudan: The EU fully shares the U.S. view regarding recent 
events in Sudan. 
 
¶2. In an aside on Bosnia, Famira noted that the GOA is 
grateful that the USG has decided to back Austrian diplomat 
Valentin Inzko as High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
following Inzko's visit to Washington.  Inzko will maintain 
close contact with the U.S. and other Peace Implementation 
Council members.
