REF: 61730 
 
Â¶1.  Regarding Reftel request for Embassy comment on the 
utility of various Public Diplomacy tools in winning 
Ecuador's support for the Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI), we consider that placement of USG-drafted articles in 
local print media the best weapon available.  There simply is 
not sufficient interest here in WMD non-proliferation efforts 
and the PSI to justify investments in DVCs, expert visits, 
NGO cultivation, and/or other PD strategies.  Conventional 
arms proliferation and regional security issues do have an 
Ecuadorian audience, however, owing to the proximity of the 
Colombian conflict and Ecuador's role as a conduit country 
for FARC-bound weapons.  We thus suggest that, for maximum 
impact, any PSI articles for placement treat WMD 
proliferation as one component of a broader arms trafficking 
problem.
