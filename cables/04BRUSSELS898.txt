REF: STATE 37339 
 
(SBU) Belgian MFA Nonproliferation Director Werner Bauwens 
confirmed to D/PolCouns March 1 that Belgium will attend the 
March 3 Global Partnership Working Group meeting in London, 
per reftel invitation.  Bauwens reported that a Belgian 
diplomat from the Belgian Embassy in London will attend, with 
the Belgian Embassy coordinating directly with U.S. Embassy 
London on the arrangements.  Bauwens noted that initial 
planning had been for an MFA expert from his Directorate to 
attend both the UK-hosted NDCI Conference in London March 4-5 
and the U.S.-hosted Global Partnership meeting March 3, but 
severe budgetary constraints at the MFA had now significantly 
reduced travel funds.  Thus, the Belgian Embassy will have to 
cover both events.
