IRAQ 
 
 
¶1. Summary:  Kuwaiti Arabic-language press continued its 
coverage of the Iraqi parliamentary elections calling the 
election "a step towards unity and a better future for 
Iraq." Despite claims of possible fraud, the Kuwaiti press 
paid more attention to the fact that the elections were 
carried out in a relatively peaceful manner and that the 
participation levels were high across the religious and 
ethnic spectrum. Under the headline "Iraqis forgot their 
divisions for only one day," Al-Watan newspaper published a 
translation of Patrick Cockburn's commentary, "Iraq: The 
beginning of the end. The state created by Britain after the 
First World War may be passing away," that appeared 
on December 11 in the British daily "The Independent." End 
summary.

-- Abdul Zahra Al-Rekabi wrote for the moderate daily Al- 
Qabas under the title "Contents of the Current Stage": "The 
most recent news coming out of Iraq point to a dangerous 
turn of events that was predicted by Newsweek Magazine as 
the undeclared civil war taking place in Iraq becomes 
declared. The future of the current struggle and the future 
of Iraq are tied to the elections. Some of the articles of 
the Iraqi constitution promote divisions and the control of 
some of the country's vital resources such as water and oil

wells by regional powers. The magazine received a copy of a 
secret UN report stating that the Iraqi constitution is

exemplary of regional divisions of the country. That is why 
the post-elections period in Iraq will be one of the most 
dangerous the country has witnessed. That is because the 
threats that were previously limited to calls and 
theoretical demands will come into the realm of 
implementation and follow-up based on the constitution that 
was prepared by certain groups of Iraqis with America's 
blessings."
