SUBJECT: GOP COOPERATES ON UN 1267 SANCTION COMMITTEE 
LISTING REQUEST 
 
REF: STATE 049793 
 
Classified By: Economic Section Chief Timothy P. Lattimer for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(S)  Econoffs delivered ref points and background information 
on May 22 to Leoncio Hernandez, the Foreign Ministry's 
Director of the Department of Analysis Against Terrorist 
Activity, and Delia Villamonte, Director General of 
International Organizations and Conferences. Hernandez and 
Villamonte were non-commital on Panama's potential 
co-sponsorship of a UN Sanctions Committee decision to list 
the three individuals named in reftel as suspected terror 
financiers.  Nonetheless, they said they would coordinate 
with relevant GOP entities to identify and freeze, as 
appropriate, financial assets these individuals might hold in 
Panama.  Villamonte specifically mentioned Panama's National 
Security Council, Bank Superintendency, Financial Analysis 
Unit, Stock Market Commission, and the Public Registry as the 
entities most likely to have data on such assets.  Hernandez 
and Villamonte confirmed that the GOP will advise if the GOP 
locates any assets held by the three and on any GOP steps 
taken regarding the same.
