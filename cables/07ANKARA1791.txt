¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) From July 1 to 7, 2007, one village guard died in clashes 
with the PKK.  During the same period four security officials, 
including two village guards, were wounded in action (WIA) or in IED 
explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) From July 1-7, three PKK terrorists were killed in action. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported five clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in the region during the reporting period. 
Security forces unearthed at least 13 PKK shelters and caves and 
seized booby-trapped land mines; other explosives, including A-4 and 
TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; night 
vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) On July 3, PKK members seized food from a resident of 
Kazanpinar Village in Kelkit, Gumushane. 
 
¶6. (U) On July 4, the PKK raided a marble mine, seizing food and 11 
cell phones, and kidnapped one of the workers. 
 
¶7. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
