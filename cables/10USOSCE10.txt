SUBJECT: OSCE,S MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERSHIP LOOKS AHEAD TO 
IMPROVED COOPERATION 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The OSCE,s annual Mediterranean 
Conference was held December 14-15 in Cairo, Egypt. All six 
Med Partners (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and 
Tunisia) attended and took an active part in discussions that 
focused on conflict prevention and resolution, trafficking in 
persons, and ways to make the partnership more valuable. The 
OSCE,s Mediterranean Partnership is a relatively 
underutilized, potentially valuable tool for engaging Maghreb 
and Middle Eastern States on issues such as CBMs, democratic 
institution-building, tolerance and non-discrimination, 
trafficking in persons and environmental security. An action 
request of Embassies in Med Partner countries and relevant 
Washington offices is contained in para 5. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) There was a wide variety of ideas, suggestions and 
recommendations emanated from the discussions at the 
Conference. 
 
These included: 
 
-- Recommendations to set up a Track II dialogue to encourage 
networking and informal CBMs and discuss application of the 
OSCE experience and acquis to the Mediterranean region . 
 
-- In the political-military field, exploration of possible 
CBMs for the Mediterranean region, as well as joint projects 
or training programs with the Partners on transnational 
threats such as terrorism and illicit trafficking in drugs. 
 
-- Cooperation between participating States, Partners, civil 
society and the business community on combating trafficking 
in persons and child exploitation is another potential area 
of joint activity. 
 
-- In the econ/environmental dimension, projects to improve 
regional cooperation on soil erosion, desertification and 
water management. 
 
-- Projects in the human dimension focusing on the role of 
education in preventing intolerance and promoting 
integration. 
 
-- Capacity-building training for Partners encompassing areas 
such as anti-corruption and independence of the judiciary, 
based on OSCE programs in the participating States. 
 
-- Finally, a number of participants suggested that key OSCE 
norm-setting documents be translated into Partner languages, 
in particular Arabic, Dari and Pashto. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) We believe that these types of projects would 
assist the Mediterranean Partners in voluntarily implementing 
OSCE standards that embody OSCE norms and principles in a 
number of key areas. While the projects listed above stem 
from discussion at the OSCE,s Mediterranean Conference, many 
could be conducted as well with the organization,s Asian 
Partners (Afghanistan, Australia, Japan, Korea, Mongolia and 
Thailand). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) These ideas on possible Partnership activities must 
be matched with appropriate resources.  The OSCE,s 
Partnership Fund, created in December 2008, provides a 
mechanism through which we can undertake concrete projects 
and activities with the Partners within OSCE participating 
States. On the basis of a consensus decision of the 56 
participating States, the Partnership Fund can also be used 
to fund projects to be carried out within the territory of a 
Partner State. The U.S. has consistently supported the 
efforts of the Partners to promote the OSCE,s comprehensive 
norms, principles and commitments in their regions, and 
encouraged them to take further steps towards their voluntary 
implementation. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Action request: We would appreciate input from 
posts and Washington offices in reaction to the above 
specific project ideas emanating from the Mediterranean 
Conference.  We would also appreciate comments regarding 
potential resources to fund them, operational considerations, 
and creative approaches that could be used to further wider 
 
USG foreign policy goals in the region through the OSCE 
Partnership.
