¶1.   EDITORIALS IN THE OCTOBER 9 EDITIONS OF THE 
   GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" AND THE 
   INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" FOCUS ON THE 
   UNITED STATES-LED STRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN.  FULL 
   EDITORIAL TEXTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE "U. S. GOVERNMENT MUST ACT 
   CORRECTLY," THE "HERALD" COMMENTS: 
 
"THE U. S. FACES BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND DREADFUL RISKS 
NOW THAT IT HAS STARTED ITS BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN 
AFGHANISTAN.  UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW ANY STATE IS 
ENTITLED TO DEFEND ITSELF AND IS ENTITLED TO RETALIATE 
AGAINST THOSE WHO ATTACK IT AND THOSE WHO ACTIVELY 
SUPPORT ITS ATTACKERS.  THE U. S. WAS BRUTALLY ATTACKED 
ON SEPTEMBER 11.  THE MAIN ATTACKS IN NEW YORK WERE 
CARRIED OUT AGAINST CIVILIAN TARGETS WITH THE 
DELIBERATE INTENTION OF KILLING CIVILIANS.  SO ASSUMING 
THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST AL-QUAEDS, LED BY OSAMA BIN 
LADEN, IS AS GOOD AS THE AMERICANS CLAIM, THEN THE 
ATTACKS ON AL-QUAEDS AND THE TALIBAN RULERS OF 
AFGHANISTAN ARE JUSTIFIED.  THE TALIBAN HAVE SUPPORTED 
AND PROTECTED AL-QUAEDS.  BUT THIS RIGHT OF SELF- 
DEFENSE IS NOT A BLANK CHECK.  THE U. S. WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BETTER ADVISED TO HAVE MADE PUBLIC THE EVIDENCE IT 
HAS BEEN PRESENTING TO MANY OF ITS ALLIES, BOTH OLD AND 
NEW, AS TO THE BLAMEWORTHINESS OF BOT AL-QUAEDS AND THE 
TALIBAN.  THE EVIDENCE IS SAID TO BE IMPRESSIVE.  YET 
MOST PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT FOR

THEMSELVES AND MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS.  IT IS 
UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO DO SO. 
CARPET BOMBING OF AFGHANISTAN, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD PUT 
THE U. S. IN THE SAME CAMP AS THOSE WHO FLEW THE PLANES 
INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.  KILLING CIVILIANS FOR 
IGNOBLE MOTIVES OF REVENGE IS TERRORISM.  THE INITIAL 
ATTACKS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN AGAINST LEGITIMATE TARGETS 
AND IT ALSO APPEARS, FROM THE CASUALTY TOLL, THAT THE 
BOMBING EXHIBITED A HIGH DEGREE OF PRECISION.  IT IS 
ESSENTIAL THAT FUTURE ATTACKS FOLLOW THE SAME COURSE. 
IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT THE U. S. RESTRICTS ITS WAR 
AIMS.  THE U. S. MUST RESISTS THE TEMPTATION TO TRY AND 
IMPOSE SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT ON AFGHANISTAN.  THAT 
MUST BE LEFT TO THE AFGHAN PEOPLE WITH THE ADVICE AND 
HELP OF NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY 
THAT ANY FUTURE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN WILL BE BOTH 
NATIONALISTIC AND ISLAMIC.  AFTER ALL ALMOST ALL 
AFGHANS ARE MUSLIMS AND, AS FOREIGN INVADERS HAVE 
DISCOVERED, ARE INTENSELY NATIONALISTIC.  IT IS INDEED 
HIGHLY LIKELY THAT ANY FUTURE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE 
ALLIED TO BOTH IRAN AND PAKISTAN, ITS MOST IMPORTANT 
NEIGHBORS, AND WILL BE CLOSER TO RUSSIA AND CHINA AMONG 
THE GREAT POWERS THAN TO THE U. S.  SUCH A GOVERNMENT 
IS UNLIKELY TO REGARD THE U. S. AS ITS BEST FRIEND AND 
IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE OF THE AMERICANS TO EXPECT 
THIS.  ALL THAT THE U. S. CAN EXPECT, AND IS ENTITLED 
TO EXPECT, IS A GOVERNMENT THAT ACCEPTS INTERNATIONAL 
LAW.  THE U. S. IS REGARDED, JUSTIFIABLY, WITH GREAT 
SUSPICION IN MUCH OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  ANY MEDDLING 
IN AFGHAN POLITICS WOULD DOOM A RESULTANT GOVERNMENT. 
THE ISLAMIC SUSPICION OF THE U. S. HAS THREE STRANDS.

FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANT, IS THE U. S. BACKING IN 
ALMOST ALL CIRCUMSTANCES OF ISRAEL.  THERE HAVE BEEN 
INDICATIONS IN THE LAST WEEK THAT THE U. S. DOES 
BELIEVE THAT THE PALESTINIANS TOO HAVE RIGHTS, BUT MANY 
WILL WANT TO SEE ACTION BEFORE THEY BELIEVE THIS. 
SECONDLY, THERE IS THE GENERAL THIRD WORLD IRRITATION 
WITH THE U. S.'S ASSUMPTION OF GLOBAL DOMINANCE.  THE 
¶U. S. NEEDS TO BE LESS DOMINEERING.  AND THIRDLY THERE 
IS A DISTASTE OF THE SECULAR CONSUMER CULTURE OF THE U. 
S., A GAP THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE BRIDGED BUT WHICH 
NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD.  SO THE U. S. HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY OF CRIPPLING AL-QUAEDS IN THE WAR ON 
TERRORISM AND GIVING THE AFGHAN PEOPLE A CHANCE TO HAVE 
A GOVERNMENT THEY DESERVE.  IT RUNS THE RISK OF BEING 
SEEN AS A BIG ANTI-ISLAMIC BULLY.  THE CHOICE IS UP TO 
THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AND IT MUST ACT AS CORRECTLY AS IT 
HAS STARTED."

TO THE 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN NEW YORK 
AND WASHINGTON, BUT THE REAL DANGER IS THAT THE U.S. 
COULD BE SUCKED INTO A LONG-DRAWN CONFLICT.  BUSH HAS 
IGNORED WORLD OPINION NOT TO ACT HASTILY.  IT WAS 
ESSENTIAL TO FURNISH THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH 
SPECIFIC EVIDENCE LINKING THE CHIEF SUSPECT IN LAST 
MONTH'S ATTACK ON THE U. S., OSAMA BIN LADEN, TO THE 
DASTARDLY ACTS.  THAT EVIDENCE REMAINS PRIVY TO THE 
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR BRITISH ALLIES.  IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE PREFERABLE TO LET THE WHOLE OF 
THE WORLD KNOW OF THIS EVIDENCE FOR THEM TO MAKE AN 
INFORMED DECISION, WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS GOING TO BE IN 
CONCERT WITH THAT OF THE AMERICANS.  BUT SUCH AN 
ARGUMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS.  AMERICA 
IS ENTITLED TO PURSUE ITS INTERESTS AND SECURITY, BUT 
IN SO DOING IT IS ERODING THE ENORMOUS SYMPATHY AND 
SUPPORT IT GARNERED SINCE THE ATTACKS ALMOST A MONTH 
AGO.  AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SO 
SOPHISTICATED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE STRIKING TARGETS 
OTHER THAN EXACT LOCATIONS OF BIN LADEN, IF IT IS 
ACCEPTED THAT HE BE CONVICTED BEFORE A TRIAL.  BUT THAT 
THEY SHOULD BE DROPPING BOMBS ALL OVER AFGHANISTAN 
RAISES FAR MORE SERIOUS CONCERNS: THE CASUALTIES ARE 
GOING TO BE MORE THAN THE ALLEGED PERPETRATORS OF THE 
11 SEPTEMBER ATTACKS.  AFGHANISTAN IS A NATION OF 
DISPLACED PEOPLE.  SUNDAY'S BOMBINGS WILL HAVE HASTENED 
THE WAVE OF AFGHANS FLEEING THEIR COUNTRY.  WHILE THEY 
SEEK REFUGE IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, THERE IS 
POTENTIAL FOR DESTABILIZATION OF THE REGION.  THERE

PAGE 03        HARARE  03004  02 OF 02  091445Z 
COULD BE MORE CASUALTIES AMONG LEADERS IN THAT REGION 
AS RESENTMENT AGAINST DISPLACEMENT AND AMERICA BUILDS 
UP.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHE THAT 
DRIVES PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARED TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES 
FOR A CAUSE.  AMONG THOSE FLEEING AFGHANISTAN INTO 
NEIGHBORING STATES ARE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO A CAUSE, ONE 
OF THEM BEING TO FIGHT AMERICA.  THEY WILL BE DIFFICULT 
TO DETECT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT AN ARMY, BUT THE EFFECTS 
OF THEIR ACTIONS ARE DEADLY.  THE FORMER SOVIET UNION 
KNOWS THE LESSON TOO WELL.  IT MET ITS WATERLOO AGAINST 
THE TALIBAN.  MANY OF THOSE BACKING THE AMERICAN 
STRIKES AGAINST AFGHANISTAN DO SO BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE 
THE OUTCOME WILL CONVENIENTLY SOLVE THEIR OWN LONG- 
STANDING PROBLEMS, WHOSE ORIGINS ARE SEEN AS EMANATING 
FROM AFGHANISTAN OR THAT REGION OF THE WORLD.  BY 
BOMBING AFGHANISTAN, THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ARE 
MERELY VICTIMIZING THE ORDINARY AFGHANS WHO HAVE NO 
CAPACITY TO ESCAPE OR HIDE FROM THE ATTACKS.  THE 
QUESTION THEY WILL ASK IS: WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO WITH 
BIN LADEN'S AGENDA?  INSTEAD OF SYMPATHY MORE HATRED IS 
ENGENDERED.  THE AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE LEARNT FROM THE 
NORTH ATLANTIC ORGANIZATION'S EXPERIENCE IN YUGOSLAVIA. 
THE AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE USED THEIR SOPHISTICATED 
INTELLIGENCE TO TRACK DOWN BIN LADEN AND BRING HIM TO 
JUSTICE WITHOUT RISKING UNNECESSARY CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES.  IT IS POSSIBLE THE CHIEF SUSPECT IS 
NOWHERE NEAR THE PLACES BEING BOMBED AS HE WOULD HAVE 
LONG ANTICIPATED THIS ACTION.  THE LIVES AND SECURITY 
OF NATIONALS BELONGING TO THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE NOW IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY.  NO 
ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHERE AND WHEN THE NEXT ATTACK WILL

BE.  THE 11 SEPTEMBER ATTACKS DEMONSTRATE THE DILEMMA 
THE WORLD FACES IN ANTICIPATING THE ACTION OF THE 
TERRORIST ENEMY.  BUT THIS MAY BE AN ENEMY FOR WHICH 
THERE IS NO DEARTH OF RECRUITS.  SO EVEN THE EVENTUAL 
CAPTURE OF BIN LADEN WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT GUARANTEES 
AGAINST FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM.  IF BIN LADEN IS THE 
MAN BUSH SAYS HE IS, THEN THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES MAY 
HAVE FALLEN FOR THE CHIEF SUSPECT'S PLAN."
