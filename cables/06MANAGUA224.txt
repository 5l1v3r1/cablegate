ASSEMBLY 
 
REF: MANAGUA 0085 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (U) Weeks after the official date of the Nicaraguan 
National Assembly's annual re-incorporation of its Junta 
Directiva and commissions, the deputies finally appointed the 
new heads of the commissions.  The PLC allied with the 
minority caucuses (bancadas) to wrest control of two 
important commissions from the Sandinistas: Economics and 
Tourism.  The results left the PLC with 11 commissions, the 
FSLN with 9, the Azul y Blanco bancada will head two, and 
Camino Cristiano and ALN-PC received one each.  Although each 
bancada was granted leadership of at least one commission, 
the outcome of the allocation was widely interpreted as a 
PLC/Azul y Blanco rebuke to the ALN-PC for resisting a 
Liberal compromise slate for the Junta Directiva that did not 
include an ALN-PC president (reftel).

¶3. (C) COMMENT: On the surface, this slate, like the Junta 
Directiva, appears to be a significant improvement over 2005. 
 Most of the PLC appointees, with a few exceptions such as 
Donald Lacayo, are moderate and committed to working with the 
USG.  On the other hand, the new chief and deputy chief of 
the PLC bancada, Lilliam Tabora and Carlos Gadea, are ardent 
Arnoldistas.  Alba Palacios, a Sandinista agitator, has 
retained her position as president of the Labor commission, 
which could exacerbate problems for the Bolanos 
administration if the FSLN continues to use its control of 
the labor guilds to pressure the government in an election 
year.  Delia Arellano headed the Defense and Government 
commission in 2004 and was very helpful in securing National 
Assembly cooperation for MANPADS destructions in that year. 
She has committed to playing the same role in 2006.  Emboffs 
will meet with the new Assembly leadership to discuss and 
promote legislative agenda items of concern to the USG.
