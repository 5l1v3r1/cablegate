                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02021  03 OF 03  131244Z

ORGANIZATIONS TO DATE.  SHE ALSO INDICATED A NEW ALERT IN 
PREVIOUSLY OVERLOOKED PLUMTREE (BULILIAMANGWE DISTRICT IN 
MATEBELELAND NORTH PROVINCE) DUE TO CONTINUED RAINS AND 
WIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION IN THE AREA.  THON STATED THAT NGO

3) DISTRICT-LEVEL CAPACITY-ENHANCING ASSISTANCE (E.G., 
VEHICLES, COMPUTERS, STAFF RESOURCES, ETC.)  FOR CRITICAL 
LOCAL-LEVEL INFORMATION GATHERING AND COORDINATION

FORMAL APPEAL SHORTLY, WHICH WOULD PROBABLY EXCEED THIS 
INCREASED $4.8 MILLION REQUEST. 
 
¶17. RESREP LOPES ALSO INDICATED THAT A MAJOR ASSESSMENT WAS 
NOW UNDERWAY IN THE AFFFECTED AREAS, CONDUCTED JOINTLY BY 
THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM, FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION
