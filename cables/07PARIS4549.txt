SUBJECT: CHAVEZ DISAPPOINTS IN PARIS: IN MEETING WITH 
SARKOZY, OFFERS NO "PROOF OF LIFE" FOR BETANCOURT REPORTS 
FARC PROMISES TO INCLUDE AMERICANS IN HOSTAGE RELIEF EFFORTS 


Classified By: POL M/C Josiah Rosenblatt for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 

¶1. (S/NOFORN) SUMMARY. Venezuelan President Chavez's November 
20 discussions with French President Sarkozy focused "99 
percent" on the FARC hostages.  Chavez's unfilled promise to 
bring "proof of life" of Ingrid Betancourt disappointed the 
French, and left the GOF with lowered expectations for proof 
of life in the future.  The French maintain their position 
that they will consider pushing the Colombians for any 
concessions at this time.  France might re-evaluate the 
utility of this position if proof is provided.  Chavez stated 
that FARC leader Manuel Marulanda promised that the three 
kidnapped Americans would be included in any release of 
hostages.  Sarkozy took the opportunity to recommend to a 
"quiet, articulate" Chavez that he improve relations with the 
U.S.  The presidents did not discuss Chavez's proposed 
constitutional reform.  END SUMMARY. 


¶2.   (S/NOFORN) On November 21, Political M/C met with Damien 
Loras, Americas Advisor at the French Presidency to get a 
read-out on Hugo Chavez's visit to Paris on November 20. 
Loras reported that Sarkozy and Chavez discussed hostage 
negotiations for "99 percent" of the hour-long meeting. 
While Chavez was not able to provide proof of life for 
Franco-Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt as he had hoped, 
the Venezuelan President told Sarkozy that he was certain to 
have such proof by the end of the year.  Chavez also reported 
on conversations with and a letter from Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC) commander Manuel Marulanda.
Marulanda reportedly promised Chavez, in writing, that he 
would provide proof of life by year,s end.  Chavez noted 
assurances from Marulanda that the three American hostages 
would be part of any humanitarian exchange.  Colombian 
senator, Piedad Cordoba, who was also in Paris, told French 
officials that they would be receiving a similar letter from 
Marulanda in the next few days which the French agreed to 
share with the U.S. 

¶3.   (S/NOFORN) According to Loras, Chavez asked Sarkozy if 
the GOF would be willing to push Colombian President Uribe to 
allow negotiations between Marulanda and Chavez on Colombian 
soil. Sarkozy repeated that he was unwilling to consider 
pushing the Colombians on any issue until proof of life is 
provided.  In the French estimation, said Loras, if the FARC 
are serious, it is unimportant who the FARC sends to 
negotiate; Marulanda is not the only possible negotiator. 
Loras told us that the French tried to make the point that 
the onus to act should currently rest with the FARC.  Any 
failed attempt at this moment  to get the Colombians (or 
others) to agree to some sort of concession would provide 
grounds for the FARC to annul their agreed commitment to 
provide proof of life.  The French urged Chavez to keep Uribe 
informed and to be transparent. 

¶4.   (S/NOFORN)  After Chavez's prior press statement that he 
thought he would have proof of life for his meetings, the 
French were disappointed when he arrived empty handed, and 
are now skeptical that proof will be provided by the end of 
the year.   However, Loras noted that Marulanda's promise to 
provide proof of life by the end of the year is the first 
direct commitment from Marulanda himself.  In Loras, 
estimation, if Marulanda cannot follow through, it would show 
him to be unreliable or unable to control his troops.  Loras
admitted that opinions within the GOF are split, but he 
personally feels the absence of "proof of life" is evidence 
Betancourt is no longer alive.  Noting Sarkozy,s campaign 
promise to leave no stone unturned to secure Betancourt,s
release and his continuing personal involvement, public 
expectations are high.  He also noted wryly that all the 
attention has increased Betancourt's value to the FARC as a 
hostage: "she is the most valuable French hostage of all 
time." 

¶5.   (S/NOFORN)  Even without proof of life, the French 
continue to contend that Chavez has leverage over the FARC 
(Loras mentioned specifically the FARC crossing the border 
into Venezuela for food and medical care).  Loras added that 
the French may, at some point, ask Chavez to exert pressure 
on the FARC in this regard.  In the French view, Chavez is 


aware that the FARC are playing a game with him.  He does not 
see the FARC as a friend.  Loras also noted his judgment that 
Chavez himself has no idea if Betancourt is alive or not, and 
described Chavez as not having good knowledge of the FARC. 


¶6.   (S/NOFORN)  When POL M/C commented on Chavez's 
uncharacteristically quiet visit to Paris, with no public 
statements or media appearances, Loras admitted that prior to 
his arrival, the GOF had told Chavez through the Venezuelan 
Ambassador in Paris that he would have to tone down his 
rhetoric in France, or the French would cancel the trip. 
Loras described Chavez as quiet, articulate and thoughtful; 
he was not the uncouth loud-mouth he plays in public. 
(Emboffs had previously been told by MFA contacts that Chavez 
had a scheduled press interview on the evening of November 
¶20.  This interview never occurred, which might be an 
indication that Chavez decided to restrict his appearances 
for fear he might not be welcome again in France.  No doubt 
Chavez,s lack of proof of life also played a role in his 
rather subdued visit to Paris.)  Loras also clarified that 
Chavez was not late to the Sarkozy meeting.  In fact, Sarkozy 
was late, forcing Chavez to wait in his vehicle for ten 
minutes.  Chavez, for his part, never showed up to his 
meeting with French business leaders even though it was to be 
held in his hotel.
