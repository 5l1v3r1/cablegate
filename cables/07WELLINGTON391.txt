for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (c) 
 
¶1.  (C) This message contains an action request, at para 5. 
 
¶2.  (C) Summary: Until today (May 24), the GNZ had intended 
to abstain on the OIE resolution that would require Taiwan to 
participate under the name Taiwan, China.  The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) have now heard from the NZ 
Embassy in Washington that a new, compromise text has been 
 
put forward by the United States and EU which is acceptable 
to both China and Taiwan.  MFAT has asked the OIE Chair to 
clarify who has negotiated the text, and which Chinese and 
Taiwan officials have OK'd it.  If all sides are really in 
agreement, MFAT will ask the Chair to ensure the new 
resolution is put forward.  Post would also be happy to 
provide MFAT with any background information Washington could 
provide us.  End Summary. 
 
¶3.  (C) On May 17, PE Couns shared reftel demarche on the 
PRC/Taiwan resolution with David Taylor, Director of MFAT's 
North Asia Division.  On May 24, Taylor's Deputy Jane Mulryan 
told PE Couns that MFAT had just received an urgent message 
from Washington with a new resolution text, reportedly put 
forward by the US and EU and acceptable to both China and 
Taiwan.  Mulryan said that MFAT has been unable to determine 
who actually negotiated the text, and whether the Chinese and 
Taiwan officials who endorsed it had the authority to do so. 
MFAT has asked for clarification from both the NZ Embassy in 
Washington and the OIE Chair (Barry O'Neal, a Kiwi).  If the 
Chair can confirm that all sides are happy with the new 
resolution, MFAT will ask that he put the resolution forward. 
 (NB: Mulryan also reminded PE Couns that although O'Neal is 
a New Zealander he is the Chair and does not represent (or 
formally answer to) the GNZ. End NB.) 
 
¶4.  (C) Mulryan said that before this latest development, 
MFAT had planned to ask Ministers to permit the NZ delegation 
to abstain on the resolution.  Now, Ministers have also been 
asked to give the delegation flexibility to vote for a new 
text if one is put forward that both China and Taiwan can 
agree to without splitting apart the organization.  Mulryan 
also said that she expects that Chinese officials will raise 
this issue with Foreign Minister Peters, who is currently on 
official travel in Beijing.  She anticipates that the PRC 
will be surprised that New Zealand plans to abstain on the 
original resolution if it is not replaced.  PRC officials 
have reportedly said they have enough OIE votes to pass the 
original resolution, and have made it clear that they will 
consider any abstentions as a "no" vote for China.  Taiwan, 
on the other hand, will consider any abstentions very 
positively, Mulryan said.  She also said that the Japanese 
Embassy had also contacted her to urge that New Zealand vote 
to remove the original PRC resolution from the ballot. 
 
¶5.  (C) Action request:  Post would be happy to back-stop 
MFAT's search for background information about the new 
resolution if helpful to Washington.  Please provide us with 
any information you would like us to share from this end. 
End action request.
