¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the H1N1 flu outbreak. 
 
NEW REPORTED CASES: 
 
¶2.  As of June 2, 2009 the Brazilian Ministry of Health is reporting 
21 confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu virus spread throughout six of 
the country's 26 states and the federal district: Sao Paulo (9 
cases), Rio de Janeiro (5 cases), Santa Catarina (4 cases), Minas 
Gerais (1 case), Rio Grande do Sul (1 case), and Tocantins (1 case). 
 Of these cases, 14 have come from individuals infected while 
travelling outside the country, and seven have resulted from 
domestic person to person transmission.  Health officials are also 
monitoring 21 suspected cases in nine states plus the federal 
district. Four American Citizens are still in quarantine in a 
hospital in Tocatins, one with a confirmed case of H1N1.  Hospital 
contacts expect all four to be released tomorrow. 
 
BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT'S RECENT ACTIONS: 
 
¶3.  The most recent case of H1N1 in Brazil was contracted by a day 
care employee in the city of Campinas, 58 miles northwest of the 
city of Sao Paulo.  The day care facility has an enrollment of 30 
children.  Health officials are monitoring the children, as well as 
other day care employees and individuals who have been in contact 
with the infected person.  The Ministry of Health has also 
recommended that the day care suspend activities for 10 days. 
 
 
DEVELOPMENTS WITH MISSION BRAZIL: 
 
¶4.  The U.S. Consulate General in Sao Paulo received a report from 
one of Brazil's influenza reference hospitals indicating that the 
number of actual H1N1 cases in Brazil might be higher than the 
Brazilian Government is reporting.  Contacts from the hospital 
report that the Ministry of Health is using very strict standards to 
confirm cases of H1N1, which may be resulting in a degree of 
underreporting.
