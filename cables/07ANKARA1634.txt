¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) From June 16 to 22, 2007, two security personnel died in 
PKK-related violence.  During the same period ten security officials 
were wounded in action (WIA).  So far in June, 18 were KIA and 47 
WIA.  While fewer casualties occurred this week than last, casualty 
figures for June already exceed those for May, when 15 security 
personnel were KIA. 
 
¶3. (U) In the third week of June the body of a PKK terrorist was 
found and nine PKK terrorists were arrested. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported 10 clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in the region.  Security forces unearthed dozens 
of PKK shelters and caves and seized booby-trapped land mines; other 
explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite 
antennas; and radios.
