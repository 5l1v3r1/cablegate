Moody's Upbeat on South Africa's 
Growth after 'Brief' Recession 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Credit rating agency Moody's predicted the South African 
recession was likely to be "brief," with the economy returning to 
growth as early as the third quarter of 2009.  Government's 
infrastructure spending, the 2010 Soccer World Cup, lower interest 
rates, and possible recommitment to some of the capital expenditure 
projects put on hold because of the global recession would drive the 
recovery.  Absa Capital's Head of Research Jeff Gable speculated the 
slowdown in output was likely to be mild compared with recessions in 
other countries.  Gable thought the economy would shrink by between 
0.5% and 1% this year.  GDP shrank 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 
last year, its first contraction in a decade.  South African Reserve 
Bank (SARB) Governor Tito Mboweni predicted that the economy 
contracted for a second consecutive quarter, pushing South Africa 
into its first recession in 17 years.  The SARB has cut the repo 
rate four times since December to 8.5% in a bid to boost flagging 
output, and it is expected to trim rates again next week.  (Business

------------------------------------ 
Strong Vote of Confidence as Largest 
South African Bond is Snapped Up 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) International investors have given South Africa a big vote of 
confidence by snapping up its largest dollar-denominated bond to 
date, despite the severe global lending crisis.  South Africa raised 
the amount on a 10-year issue from $1 billion to $1.5 billion after 
it was oversubscribed more than five times, according to National 
Treasury officials.  It was the largest dollar-denominated issue 
since South Africa re-entered global markets in 1995.  The annual 
coupon for the bond was 6.875%, which was South Africa's 
third-lowest on record (the lower the coupon, the less expensive the 
bond is for the government). The new issue was priced at a spread of 
375 basis points over US Treasuries, tighter than the guidance of 
387.5 basis points initially offered by banks.  The size of this new 
issue will help take pressure off of domestic capital markets, which 
the government will tap to finance its budget deficit this year. 
The budget deficit is expected to reach 3.8% this financial year. 
The capital raised would also ease pressure on funding South 
Africa's current account deficit.  The increase in appetite for 
QAfrica's current account deficit.  The increase in appetite for 
South African debt is remarkable in the context of its newly elected 
government, which is perceived to be more left-leaning with more 
leaders from trade unions and the South African Communist Party.

Fertilizer Hits Fan for Top Bosses at Sasol 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The board of petrochemicals giant Sasol has put management 
under a microscope in an effort to curb the anticompetitive behavior 
that has earned Sasol two record fines in the past year.  The board 
had instituted a review of Sasol's competition law and compliance 
 
PRETORIA 00001046  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
systems, according to Chairwoman Hixonia Nyasulu.  Sasol CEO Pat 
Davies made presentations to the Competition Tribunal on May 20, 
which confirmed a R250 million ($30 million) fine for collusion in 
the fertilizer industry.  The fine stems from fertilizer company 
Nutri-Flo's complaint that Sasol and competitors Omnia and Yara 
(formerly Kynoch) had divided markets and fixed prices.  Davies 
apologized for the violations of competition regulations, and 
commented that Sasol expected some of the affected customers to 
institute civil claims against it.  (Business Day, May 21, 2009) 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Gordhan Asserts Treasury's Leading Role 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan continued to make clear to 
markets that there would be certainty in economic policy, saying 
that the Treasury is still the "national guardian of economic 
policy," but would remain "consultative" and "co-operative."  The 
Finance Minister also reiterated that President Zuma has mandated "a 
faster pace of delivery and a greater sense of urgency," and 
therefore greater rigor, planning, and execution in government are 
necessary.  Gordhan noted the fiscal constraints brought about by 
the global economic downturn, but he stressed "reprioritization" of 
fiscal resources to achieve the goals of the newly elected 
government.  The new government is unlikely to make substantial 
changes in economic policy, analysts believe, and Gordhan's comments 
about continuity and certainty in policy are likely to be viewed in 
a positive light by markets.  (Absa Capital Research Morning Sheet, 
May 19, 2009)

South Africa's Exports Down 9.1% 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) A decline in exports represents the most important channel of 
impact of the international crisis on the South African economy, 
according to Bureau for Economic Research (BER) Director Ben Smit. 
The BER foresees an expected decline of 9.1% in total exports of 
goods and services in 2009.  "Given a share of 27% of constant price 
GDP, this expected decline in exports contributes substantially to 
the expected decline in overall GDP in 2009," said Smit.  (Business 
Day, May 21, 2009) 
 
---------------------------- 
Strong JSE Debut for Vodacom 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Mobile operator Vodacom made a strong debut on the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) after the Pretoria High Court 
rejected a bid by the Congress of South African Trade Unions 
(COSATU) and the Independent Communications Authority of South 
Africa (ICASA) to stop state-owned Telkom from selling a 15% stake 
in Vodacom to British mobile giant Vodafone.  COSATU and ICASA 
argued that Telkom's 50% stake in South Africa's biggest cellular 
operator was a public asset that should not be sold off to a foreign 
company. More than R100 million ($12 million) in Vodacom shares were 
traded in the first hour after its market debut.  Vodacom's total 
value moved between R88 billion ($10.5 billion) and R93 billion 
($11.1 billion), making it about the 11th biggest company on the JSE 
by market value.  The listing was part of a R22.5 billion ($2.7 
billion) deal that increased Vodafone's share in Vodacom from 50% to 
Qbillion) deal that increased Vodafone's share in Vodacom from 50% to 
65%.  (South Africa Info, May 19, 2009) 
 
------------------------------------ 
Eskom's Belated Bid for Tariff Hikes 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. (U) State-owned utility Eskom submitted an interim power tariff 
increase proposal of 34% to the National Energy Regulator of South 
Africa (Nersa) on May 15.  Eskom excused its late request as caused 
by the financial crisis and uncertainty about government support. 
The general elections and installation of a new government also 
contributed to the lateness of the request.  Trade union 
confederation COSATU slammed the request and urged Nersa to reject 
it.  Electricity consumers have been given two weeks to comment. 
Eskom characterized the proposed increase as a stop-gap measure that 
would soften the effect of a bigger increase that it will require 
later to meet financial requirements.  Eskom said it was working 
with the government on an appropriate funding model for its 
 
PRETORIA 00001046  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
ambitious capital expenditure program, which is aimed at augmenting 
shortages in supply capacity.  Many observers note that tariffs are 
too low to reflect the true cost of producing electricity and to 
encourage electricity efficiency.  But, there are concerns that the 
interim application deprives businesses and consumers of certainty 
on future electricity prices.  (Business Times, Business Day, 
Financial Mail, May 15-20, 2009)

Optimism for Independent Power 
Producers in South Africa 
------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (U) International engineering consultancy Hatch believes that the 
prospects for independent power producer (IPPs) projects in South 
Africa are "closer than ever," despite frustration among potential 
IPPs, many of which have had their project plans set back by a 
series of regulatory and Eskom tender delays.  Hatch expressed this 
optimism at an IPP workshop it hosted in Johannesburg on May 19. 
Principal consultant Dieter Matzner noted that IPP developers must 
come to grip with the requirements surrounding the procurement 
process of a power purchase agreement (PPA), particularly since 
Eskom has been designated as the 'single buyer' and the rules were 
still evolving.  In March, Eskom extended its postponement of the 
release of a request for proposals for its base-load IPP program, 
saying that it required greater certainty on the regulatory 
framework before it could proceed.  Its cogeneration programs had 
also stalled, purportedly for Nersa to finalize its power purchase 
cost recovery guidelines.  At the heart of the dilemma for Nersa and 
Eskom was a mismatch between tariffs, which were extremely low, and 
the need to encourage private investment - a dilemma that was 
particularly acute in South Africa, owing to the fact that tariffs 
of around 22 Rand c/kWh were substantially below the cost of new 
utility and IPPs production.  Eskom and the regulator were seemingly 
satisfied that the proposed rules for power purchase cost recovery 
would provide the basis for the utility to pursue long-awaited PPAs 
with IPPs.  However, potential IPP developers appear confused about 
how to secure a PPA and unsure about whether the rules provided 
sufficient protection in what would come down to commercial 
discussions with a powerful utility such as Eskom.  Adding to the 
concern was an emerging fear that Nersa, government and Eskom might 
seek to limit the number of IPPs.  (Engineering News, May 20, 2009)

Uranium Holds Growing Allure for 
South African Gold Miners 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) An uptick in uranium prices is encouraging South Africa's 
big three gold producers to realize greater value from the uranium 
associated with gold in the Witwatersrand reef west of Johannesburg. 
 Uranium prices have moved over $50 per pound, substantially above 
the doldrums pricing of $10 per pound in the 1990's, but below the 
commodity boom peak of $135 per pound in June 2007.  New uranium 
projects are based on realistic long-term contract price 
expectations of $65-70 per pound, according to AngloGold Ashanti and 
Rand Uranium.  For many years, AngloGold Ashanti's Moab Khotsong 
QRand Uranium.  For many years, AngloGold Ashanti's Moab Khotsong 
mine and plant was South Africa's only significant producer. 
AngloGold Ashanti is now planning a significant increase in uranium 
output from about 1.2 million pounds last year to over 2 million 
pounds this year by expanding its Kopanang plant.  Last year, 
Harmony Gold Mining formed a joint venture with Pamodzi Resources 
Fund, called Rand Uranium, aimed to turn its Randfontein gold and 
uranium tailings dumps into the world's ninth-largest uranium 
producer.  Rand Uranium is investigating project feasibility and 
funding options.  Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland recently said Gold 
Fields had 13 tailings dams containing gold and uranium, which were 
under investigation for reprocessing.  The company was still 
evaluating environmental issues and was considering cooperation with 
other producers.  (Business Day, May 20, 2009)

Zuma Appoints First Woman 
Science and Technology Minister 
------------------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) President Jacob Zuma appointed former Minister of Education 
Naledi Pandor to his cabinet as Minister of Science and Technology. 
Pandor replaced Dr. Mosibudi Mangena, who had held the position 
 
PRETORIA 00001046  004.2 OF 004 
 
 
since the formation of the Department of Science and Technology 
(DST) in 2002.  Pandor is the first female science and technology 
minister.  (The Times, May 10, 2009)
