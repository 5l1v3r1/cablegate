SUBJECT: LONG PETROBRAS SHUTDOWN ENDS 
 
REF: Quito 394 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Operations in Brazilian petroleum firm 
Petrobras's Block 18 had been suspended due to community protests 
for over three weeks.  Each day without production cost Petrobras 
close to 40 thousand barrels of oil (about 16% of Ecuador's private 
sector production) and roughly half a million dollars in revenue 
(with the Government of Ecuador (GOE) losing the same or more). 
State firm Petroecuador declared force majeure on March 30 since it 
was unable to meet delivery contracts.  The GOE helped broker a 
solution and the blockade was lifted the same day, just 4 days 
before Correa's visit to Brazil.  The shutdown was unusual in that 
it went on longer and yielded less to community demands than usual. 
End Summary. 
 
UNREASONABLE DEMANDS? 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Community residents shut down operations in Block 18 on 
March 7, claiming that Petrobras will start a new phase of 
operations and must therefore compensate the community for the 
pending drilling and environmental damage.  Petrobras representative 
Fernando Enmanuel claimed the new phase is still awaiting GOE 
approval, and even if it is approved, would not begin until 2008. 
He also noted that Petrobras is a good community partner and has 
complied with all of its required social responsibility programs to 
date.  Enmanuel reports residents demanded Petrobras pave 120 
kilometers of road in the area, and give 100 percent salary 
increases to community Petrobras employees.  Compliance would have 
been impossible, he said - the road alone would cost between USD 60 
and 80 million.  (Note:  Similar community demands are common.  Last 
year, community residents shut down Petrobras operations, demanding 
that it hire more resident contractors and provide equipment and 
transportation.  In the last major shutdown, Andes Petroleum, a 
Chinese company, gave in to almost all demands, setting an example 
for future community protests.  Other private petroleum companies 
reported numerous suspensions in operations last year due to 
community demands for additional benefits.) 
 
GOVERNMENT REPRIMANDS, NEGOTIATES... 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) President Correa made a statement to the press on March 23 
that Ecuador was losing half a million dollars a day from the 
Petrobras shutdown; that a number of these anarchic situations 
existed, and that "the anarchy" must be stopped and authority 
respected.  He reprimanded regional prefects and mayors who seize 
oil wells and organize invasions, which he said the government would 
 
not allow.  Enmanuel reports that total GOE losses from the shutdown 
were even higher than the President stated publicly, close to USD 
1.2 million per day and likely a strong influence on the President's 
desire for a solution.  Later that day, following attempts by the 
Energy Ministry to help reach a compromise between Petrobras and the 
community, Energy Minister Acosta made a statement to the press that 
the situation was being resolved and operations would restart "in a 
few hours." 
 
...LARGELY UNSUCCESSFULLY 
------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) However, the President's comments did not translate to 
quick resolution, and Acosta's statement was premature.  The 
agreement with the community fell apart and suspension of operations 
continued for another week.  On March 30, Petroecuador declared 
"force majeure" on crude petroleum exports and said it was delaying 
contractually required shipments due to decreased production, citing 
the Block 18 shutdown, as well as increased volcanic activity in the 
oil-producing region and low stocks in Ecuador's refineries.  (Note: 
 Petroecuador has had problems meeting export contract requirements 
since January because of declining production across the entire 
sector, so while the Block 18 shutdown exacerbated the problem it 
was not the sole cause of it.) 
 
¶5.  Late in the day on March 30, Petrobras and the GOE came to a 
negotiated agreement with the community, but the final accord did 
not give in to all community demands.  Recently, Energy Ministry 
representatives have told us that the administration wants to 
increase government involvement in community issues in the 
oil-producing Oriente.  In keeping with this, although residents 
demanded Petrobras build a new road, the GOE decided this activity 
was strictly a government responsibility.  The GOE reportedly agreed 
to repair nearby roads but did not consent to build a new one. 
Similarly, Petrobras agreed to increase salaries but not as high as 
initially requested. 
 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) This was the first time that Petrobras has held out 
through such a long community-provoked shutdown.  Petrobras 
management believed they had President Correa's backing and were 
trying to negotiate an agreement that would protect them from 
additional community demands in the future, so were willing to 
weather a period of zero production.  For its part, the GOE was 
motivated by a desire to restore production and settle the problem 
before President Correa's April 3 visit to Brazil (where he is 
expected to sign a number of cooperation agreements including on 
energy), and therefore appeared willing to invest more of its 
political and financial capital to bring about a settlement than 
have previous governments when confronted with similar stoppages. 
Although the GOE was able to finally come to a consensus with 
stakeholders, numerous disputes with activists and community members 
in the energy sector occur frequently in Ecuador, and several remain 
outstanding.  In addition, the GOE has yet to demonstrate how it 
will deal with foreign oil companies on a broader basis.  Its 
rhetoric suggests it wants private oil companies to share even more 
revenue or production with the government, but it has not made any 
firm proposals to the oil companies, which remain in limbo 
(reftel).
