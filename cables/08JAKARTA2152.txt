¶1.  Summary.  During a November 20 meeting, Minister of Marine 
Affairs and Fisheries Numberi emphasized the importance of creating 
a long-term research partnership between the United States 
Government and countries in the region, and proposed a joint marine 
research arrangement between the CTI countries and NOAA.  The 
Minister believes the proposed Okeanos Explorer research cruise 
would make important contributions to understanding marine resources 
in Indonesia, build public support for actions to protect the marine 
environment, and build a commitment to marine research collaboration 
among the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) countries.  Minister 
Numberi stressed the importance of sharing scientific data and 
information about the Indonesian marine environment globally to 
promote environmental protection and effective responses to climate 
change.  The head of the World Ocean Conference's (WOC) organizing 
committee asked for active participation by NOAA scientists at the 
WOC.  End Summary. 
 
Okeanos Explorer: A Symbol of Long-Term Commitment 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶2.  Ambassador Hume and a team from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) met with Minister of Marine 
Affairs and Fisheries Freddy Numberi on November 20 to discuss the 
potential voyage of NOAA's research vessel Okeanos Explorer (EX) to 
Indonesia next May.  The Minister emphasized that the EX's maiden 
voyage should not mark a one-off event but expand the existing, 
close partnership between NOAA and Indonesia (and his Ministry in 
particular).  It symbolized a long-term commitment to partnership, 
the benefits of which would--and should--accrue to the entire world, 
not just Indonesia or the U.S.  The EX's presence would introduce 
the Indonesian public and policymakers to the importance of global 
collaboration on marine issues, including study of climate change 
impacts on the ocean and coastal resources. 
 
¶3.  The Ambassador agreed that collaboration on marine issues has 
been one of the most positive areas of the bilateral relationship. 
He noted that the WOC and the EX research cruise were an opportunity 
to demonstrate the real and significant benefits of scientific and 
environmental collaboration, for all the world's peoples. 
Policymakers need accurate and comprehensive data in order to make 
better decisions--about marine conservation, coastal development, 
climate change--and the U.S.-Indonesia partnership is precisely 
about providing this information in a collaborative, open, manner. 
 
¶4.  Background: Indonesia is hosting the World Ocean Conference 
(WOC) in Manado, North Sulawesi, from May 11-15, 2009.  The 
Government of Indonesia would like the WOC to serve as the backdrop 
for Summit Meeting of Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) country 
leaders, who will officially adopt the CTI Action Plan.  A key 
element is a proposed research voyage by NOAA's newest exploration 
and research vessel Okeanos Explorer timed to coincide with the WOC 
and CTI Summit (reftels). 
 
Minister Proposes NOAA-CTI Research Partnership 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶5.  The Minister hoped that the EX's voyage could also mark the 
beginning of a long-term collaborative research partnership between 
countries in the region and other governments (especially the USG), 
beginning with Indonesia.  He noted that the ship will be collecting 
critical scientific information in the Coral Triangle region.  The 
Minister suggested that this was a good opportunity to highlight the 
practicality of a joint marine research MOU between the six Coral 
Triangle Initiative countries and NOAA.  This would help meet the 
CTI's research and data needs, and underscore the importance of the 
region in the public eye.  He volunteered to propose this to the 
other CTI countries at the CTI ministerial meeting in February 
¶2009. 
 
WOC Update 
---------- 
¶6.  Dr. Indroyono Soesilo, head of the WOC's organizing committee, 
reported that Indonesia is constructing a floating harbor in Manado 
bay for the EX.  Dr. Soesilo confirmed that the GOI plans for two of 
 
JAKARTA 00002152  002.3 OF 002 
 
 
its Baruna Jaya ships to accompany the EX on the research cruise. 
He also reiterated the organizing committee's wish for strong 
representation and active participation by NOAA scientists in the 
International Ocean Science, Technology, and Policy Symposium 
component of the WOC.
