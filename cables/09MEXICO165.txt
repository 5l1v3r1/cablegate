REF: STATE 02508 
 
(SBU)  Poloff conveyed points January 15 concerning U.S. 
nonproliferation sanctions on A.Q. Khan and Associates 
(reftel) to Julian Juarez Cadenas, the Deputy Director 
General for UN-Related Security and Legal Issues at the 
Foreign Secretariat (SRE).  Juarez said that he was not aware 
that Mexico entertained contact with any of the sanctioned 
individuals and companies.  Noting that the GOM organizes and 
attends nuclear energy courses that include international 
participation, he said he would forward the names of those 
being sanctioned to the Mexican Commission of Nuclear 
Security and Federal Commission of Electricity.
