SUBJECT: GOVERNOR DISCUSSES DISARMAMENT IN THE PANJSHIR 
 
REF: KABUL 00452 
 
¶1. (U) Disarmament is still a problem in Panjshir, according 
to Governor Haji Bahlul, who met with the DCM on February 4. 
Bahlul praised the PRT's work and said that the relatively 
permissive security posture (the Panjshir PRT is the first to 
be led by a civilian) has helped improve community-PRT 
relations, but tensions still remain surrounding disarmament. 
Panjshiris have fought against the Soviets, Taliban, and 
other invaders for many years. Although now in a period of 
relative peace, they are still concerned about their safety 
with potential US troop reduction and the ISAF PRT handovers. 
 
¶2. (U) The DCM congratulated the Governor on his successes 
with disarmament so far, but emphasized the need for 
continued, steady progress. He observed that disarmament is a 
nationwide priority and that Panjshir needs to participate in 
order to generate balance with other provinces. He added that 
as the weapons leave the valley, investors will be more 
likely to develop tourism and other local industries. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Disarmament continues to face resistance in 
Panjshir as illustrated by two recent incidents involving 
ammunition survey teams from Kabul. While some Panjshiris 
support disarmament as a means to increase economic 
development there are distinct rival factions in Panjshir 
which are reluctant to disarm completely - a situation common 
throughout Afghanistan. Indeed, as the security situation in 
the south intensifies, we may be faced with the need in some 
limited locations to balance our interest in disarmament and 
DIAG with a pragmatic need to rely on local tribal militias 
to provide security until the ANA and ANP are up to the task. 
 END COMMENT.
