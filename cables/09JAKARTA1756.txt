EMERGENCY SHELTER NEEDS 
 
REF:  JAKARTA 01715 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) is 
continually assessing the dynamic emergency shelter conditions of 
areas affected by the September 30 earthquake, which severely 
damaged nearly 140,000 houses.  Little displacement has occurred, as 
most families are living under tarps in close proximity to houses. 
The most costly shelters, constructed of brick and tile roofs, 
sustained more damage than less expensive shelters, constructed of 
bamboo mats and thatch.  Families are salvaging materials and have 
commenced rebuilding houses.  The humanitarian community is 
concerned about reports that the Government of Indonesia (GoI) will 
provide limited compensation to families whose houses were damaged 
or destroyed.  USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(USAID/OFDA) is providing temporary and transitional shelter 
assistance, programs to provide the basis for a "build back better" 
disaster risk reduction approach, and technical expertise.  End 
summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
USAID/DART Assessment of Shelter Needs 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Since arriving in West Sumatra Province following the September 
30 earthquake, the USAID/DART field officer has assessed conditions 
in 13 villages in Agam, Pariaman, and Padang Pariaman districts. 
The shelter situation is rapidly changing, as some families continue 
to live under tents while others have already begun rebuilding 
houses.  This assessment report serves as a snapshot of the shelter 
situation at this point in time.  One week from now, given the 
rapidly changing nature of the shelter situation, this information 
could be obsolete. 
 
-- Damage and Displacement -- 
 
¶3.  According to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the earthquake severely damaged nearly 
140,000 houses in the three aforementioned districts.  With only 
minor exceptions, including the displaced persons camp per reftel, 
families whose houses have sustained damage are remaining at points 
of origin.  The humanitarian community has received very few reports 
of displacement away from the respective family's plot of land. 
 
¶4.  Almost all families in assessed areas are living under tarps in 
very close proximity to their houses.  Even where damage to houses 
is relatively minimal, families are choosing to continue living 
under tents outside.  Many families have expressed the belief that a 
larger earthquake is coming and fear entering their houses. 
 
¶5.  Shelters in affected areas are of three distinct types, 
corresponding to the families' relative degree of wealth.  Wealthy 
families inhabit brick homes with clay tile roofs.  Less expensive 
are brick homes with corrugated galvanized iron roofs.  Poorer 
families live in bamboo weave mat homes with thatched roofs.  The 
USAID/DART field officer observed that houses with the clay tile 
roofs were generally the ones most damaged by the earthquake.  This 
phenomenon could be due to the weight of the tile roof combined with 
poor construction techniques that left the roof without sufficient 
support during the quake. 
 
-- Rebuilding Planned and Progressing -- 
 
¶6.  The majority of families who lived in houses with clay tile 
roofs reported plans to rebuild with wood construction.  Some 
families stated they would do this because wood construction is 
"stronger" than brick construction, while other families plan to do 
this because wood is less expensive than brick.

¶7.  Throughout the earthquake-affected area, the USAID/DART field 
officer observed families salvaging materials from the debris.  When 
asked what they intended to do with the material, families reported 
plans to use the materials to begin rebuilding houses after saving a 
sufficient amount of money. 
 
¶8.  Some families in areas assessed were already engaged in 
reconstruction.  One man reported that he did not want his family to 
sleep under a tent during the upcoming rainy season.  He expected to 
rebuild his house within the next two or three weeks.  The 
USAID/DART field officer observed the man rebuilding a structurally 
unsound house.  (Comment:  The story of this man highlights a trend 
underway throughout the earthquake-affected area, as many families 
have already started rebuilding houses.  To positively influence the 
current rebuilding phase, any earthquake-resistant construction 
training must commence very soon.  End comment.) 
 
¶9.  Health issues may arise if families continue to live under tents 
during the rainy season.  Health providers are concerned about a 
possible increase in the number of pneumonia and upper respiratory 
infections if families continue to live in settings open to the 
elements during the rainy season. 
 
-- GoI Support for Shelter Reconstruction Program -- 
 
¶10.  Unsubstantiated reports are circulating that the GoI plans to 
support a shelter reconstruction program.  This program would 
provide approximately $530, $1,060, and $1,590 for families whose 
houses were slightly, moderately, and severely damaged, 
respectively.  Families report that an "average" house -- one with 
brick walls and corrugated galvanized iron sheet roofing -- costs 
roughly $8,480 to build.  The significant shortfall between the GoI 
shelter compensation plan and the reported cost of building a house 
gives rise to concern that people may use cheaper building materials 
and employ less expensive building techniques when rebuilding 
houses. 
 
¶11.  The earthquake severely damaged cement factories and brick 
kilns.  The brick-making industry is operating at 40 percent of its 
pre-earthquake capacity.  With cement and bricks in short supply, 
the humanitarian community is concerned that people might use 
materials of lower quality in shelter reconstruction. 
 
-- USAID/OFDA Interventions -- 
 
¶12.  In Indonesia, shelter construction is an ongoing process even 
outside of a disaster setting.  Families that generate wealth often 
invest money in their house.    USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign 
Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) is currently supporting the 
provision of temporary and transitional shelter as part of the 
humanitarian response to the earthquake.  Equally important, 
USAID/OFDA is supporting education programs that focus on improved 
building techniques with a strategic emphasis on seismic resistance. 
 These programs are designed to provide the basis for a "build back 
better" approach that is part of a broader disaster risk reduction 
program within the earthquake-affected area.  In addition, a shelter 
and settlements expert recently joined the USAID/DART in Padang and 
is working with the GoI and humanitarian community to meet emergency 
shelter needs.
