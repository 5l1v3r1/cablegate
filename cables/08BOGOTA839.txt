SUBJECT: MARCH 5 UPDATE ON COLOMBIA'S DISPUTE WITH ECUADOR 
AND VENEZUELA 
 
REF: BOGOTA 827 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor John S. Creamer 
Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C)  Colombia's border with Venezuela remained partially 
closed on March 5, as the GOV confirmed that its troop 
deployments on the border were 90 percent complete (reftel). 
The border with Ecuador remained open.  The GOC reiterated 
that it would not deploy troops to its borders.  GOC Deputy 
Foreign Minister Reyes told the GOC is happy with the OAS 
resolution, since it does not condemn Colombia's incursion 
into Ecuadorian territory. Senior Colombian political leaders 
supported President Uribe, but questioned his plans to take 
Chavez to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The French 
remain convinced that only Chavez can free Ingrid Betancourt, 
and pushed on the margins of the March 4 OAS meeting to 
include Venezuela and other countries as intermediaries with 
the FARC.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
UPDATE: BORDERS ALMOST NORMAL 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Colombian border with Venezuela remained partially 
closed, as Venezuelan Defense Minister Gustavo Rangel told 
the press the GOV had completed 90 percent of its 
mobilization of troops to the Colombian border.  Colombia's 
border with Ecuador remained open.  Food and medicine crossed 
into Venezuela, but some border posts imposed varying 
restrictions on the flow of goods and people without 
visas/permits into Venezuela.  Colombian food processors 
confirmed that food is crossing into Venezuela for now, but 
the GOV is trying to negotiate deals with other producers. 
 
¶3. (C)  Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos repeated that the 
GOC would not "deploy one single soldier" to its borders in 
response to Venezuelan and Ecuadorian deployments. 
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa continued his tour of 
Latin capitals in Brazil, criticizing the GOC for the attack. 
 Meanwhile, negotiators at the OAS reached a deal on language 
for a resolution regarding the GOC attack against Reyes. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Camilo Reyes told us the GOC is happy 
with the resolution, since it did not "condemn" Colombia's 
infringement on Ecuador's territory.  He said President Uribe 
and Foreign Minister Araujo will travel to the Dominican 
Republic on March 6 to attend the Rio Group meeting.  Uribe 
will use the event to lobby regional leaders. 
 
 
SENATE DEBATE STRESSES CHAVEZ THREAT 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (C) On March 4, the Colombian Senate debated the crisis 
and the threat from Venezuela--a debate the GOC had planned 
prior to Raul Reyes' death.  Senator German Vargas Lleras, 
presidential hopeful and leader of the Cambio Radical Party, 
made an elaborate presentation detailing more than $4 billion 
of Venezuelan weapons purchases and showing numerous FARC and 
ELN camps inside Venezuela.  Vargas said, "We face a concrete 
threat, and have been the object of permanent aggression from 
Venezuela for many years.  We are the aggrieved party, not 
the aggressor." 
 
¶5. (C) Vargas told us on February 20 that he had coordinated 
the debate on Venezuela's links with the FARC with Santos and 
other GOC officials.  Vargas confirmed that Santos had 
provided him with intelligence information for the 
discussion.  Santos followed Vargas' presentation with an 
assurance that the GOC did not expect war. 
 
 
POLITICIANS RALLY AROUND URIBE 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U) The Advisory Commission on Foreign Relations -- which 
includes ex-presidents and foreign ministers -- met with 
Uribe for five hours on March 4, and later issued a statement 
of support.  Opposition Liberal Party chief and 
former-President Cesar Gaviria, speaking for the Commission, 
rejected GOC and GOE threats and troop movements as 
 
provocative, and criticized their support for the FARC. 
Several Commission members suggested that Uribe reconsider 
his decision to initiate a case against Chavez in the 
International Criminal Court (ICC).  Uribe named a high-level 
committee of jurists to manage the GOC case on March 5. 
 
 
IMPACT OF REYES DEATH ON FARC 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) The FARC issued a communique on March 4, naming Milton 
Toncel (aka Joaquin Gomez) as Reyes' replacement in the FARC 
Secretariat.  Peace activist Moritz Akerman said Gomez was 
 
SIPDIS 
intellectual and "urbane," but also violent and resentful. 
Unlike other FARC members who expect to live and die in the 
mountains, Akerman said Gomez could see the bigger picture. 
He added that Reyes' death undermined the FARC's diplomatic 
network; the group would need months to rebuild this. 
 
 
FRENCH COMPLICATIONS 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) Peace Commissioner Restrepo told us GOC-GOF relations 
are "very bad."  France remains obsessed with Betancourt, 
Restrepo said, and continues to believe only Chavez can 
achieve her release.  Restrepo also told us that on the 
margins of the March 4 OAS session, the French tried to 
re-float their proposal that a group of countries (including 
Venezuela) intervene as international facilitators for a 
humanitarian accord.
