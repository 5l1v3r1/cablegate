SUBJECT: "DEFAMATION OF RELIGION" RESOLUTION AT THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS 
COUNCIL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 27376 
 
¶1. (SBU) First Secretary Carlos Eduardo Da Cunha Oliveira, in the 
Division of Human Rights of the 
Ministry of Exterior told poloff on March 25 that Brazil would 
abstain and offer an explanation of its vote. 
 
¶2. (SBU)Oliveira explained that the Defamation of Religion 
Resolution underwent some changes in the Third Committee of the 
General Assembly to such an extent that it has started to contain 
points that are incompatible with human rights norms. The 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights already 
contains limitations to the exercise of freedom of speech but the 
Defamation of Religion Resolution goes beyond them and this concept 
would not be in line with Brazilian legislation.  Oliveira stated 
that human rights norms protect the right of the person and there 
were three main objections for Brazil: 
 
-The draft resolution presented to the commission emphasizes 
"Islamophobia", which is not appropriate. 
 
-The resolution emphasizes a single religion and Brazil wants to 
avoid selectivity. 
 
-Brazil disagrees with addressing religious intolerance through 
"defamation of religion."  Brazil would rather see problems of 
religious intolerance addressed through a resolution against 
"incitement to hatred," which it distinguishes from defamation of 
religion.
