 ¶1.  (SBU)  Summary: African Union Special Envoy Dr. Salim 
Salim extended the deadline for the Darfur negotiations by 48 
hours at the request of USDEL, other international partners, 
and the parties.  Salim announced his decision in a late 
night plenary and urged all the parties to take full 
advantaged of the additional time.  The extension followed a 
day full of activity by USDEL and the international partners 
with the parties.  USDEL made specific proposals on 
disarmament of the janjaweed and integration of the 
movements' forces and worked with Sudan Liberation Movement 
(SLM) faction leader Minni Minnawi and the Government of 
Sudan.  In addition, USDEL urged SLM's other faction leader 
Abdelwahid Nur to make constructive counterproposals to 
Sudanese Vice President Taha on power and wealth-sharing. 
International partners also warned Justice and Equality 
Movement (JEM) not to play the role of spoiler, which it 
continues to do.  USDEL is using the extension to continue 
facilitating talks between Minnawi and the GOS on security 
issues and provided needed support to Abdelwahid Nur in his 
discussions on other issues.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  African Union Special Envoy Dr. Salim Salim's 
decision to extend the Darfur peace talks for another 48 
hours came after a day of intense activity by USDEL, the 
international partners, and some of the parties.  Salim asked 
USDEL to lead off the plenary with an update on discussions 
between SLM faction leader Minni Minnawi and the Government 
of Sudan on key security issues: disarmament of the janjaweed 
and the integration of the movements' forces into the 
Sudanese military and security services.  Khartoum CDA Hume 
proposed a 48 hour deadline extension to allow these 
bilateral meetings to continue, emphasizing that the U.S. is 
very concerned about the security situation and the safety of 
the people of Darfur.  USDEL kept Salim fully apprised of its 
activities, which Salim supported, throughout the day. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  After meeting with Mutrif Sadiq and Minni Minnawi 
separately, USDEL sat in on bilateral meeting between 
Minnawi, who was accompanied by two commanders and two 
politicos, and the GOS (Mutrif Sadiq, Intelligence Chief 
Salah Gosh, and Generals Mohammed Ibrahim and Ismat 
Abderahamane).  During the four hour meeting, which focused 
primarily on integration issues, Minni and the GOS agreed on 
integration of rebel members into the Sudanese Armed Forces 
(SAF), but not on how it would be accomplished.  The GOS 
proposed an overall ratio of one rebel troop to four Sudanese 
soldiers in integrated units, while the rebels proposed the 
opposite ratio of 4 rebel soldier to one SAF troop.  The SLM 
does not have enough forces to integrate at this ratio.  The 
two parties could not close gap yesterday, but appeared ready 
to continue discussing it. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  USDEL also worked with SLM faction leader 
Abdelwahid Nur throughout the day.  Ambassador Yates urged 
Abdelwahid to be selective and constructive in putting 
forward proposals to the GOS on the issues of representation 
and region.  Later, the African Union Mediation with selected 
partners (US, UN , EU, Arab League) met with Movement 
representatives to receive formal reactions to the Darfur 
Peace Agreement (DPA) draft.  Uncharacteristically, 
Abdelwahid was the most focused and reasonable.  His leading 
mediators presented rationale points to strengthen their 
participation which included a tacit acceptance of the DPA 
formulation on a region for Darfur. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  SLM Minnawi and especially JEM were almost totally 
rejectionist.  Their complaints were launched with 
recriminations of the AU for the lateness of the draft DPA 
received only in English until the Arabic translation was 
completed on April 30, giving them little time to study, 
react, and engage with the GOS.  (Note: We have little 
sympathy for this argument since the leadership of both 
movements, especially JEM, are English speakers.  End Note.) 
The SLM Minnawi team (speaking while Minni himself was 
meeting with CDA Hume and members of USDEL and Senior GOS 
officials), with less than eight hours to the deadline, 
called the DPA only a "draft which needs plenty of work to 
become a comprehensive peace agreement".  JEM spokesman Ahmed 
Tugod Lissan was more categorical saying that the draft does 
not reflect any structures capable of bring about real change 
in Darfur.  JEM has announced that they will not sign.  SLM 
Minnawi's spokesman left the door open.

¶6.  (SBU)  Beyond our close work in tandem with the AU 
Mediation, the rest of the international community with the 
exception of the EU, Arab League, Canada, and SGSSR Jan 
Pronk, who came for the weekend, have been passive in working 
the parties to facilitate agreement acceptance.  None shows 
much sympathy for the Movements' recalcitrance and all seem 
to await the positive results in security arrangements which 
have been the focus of USDEL.
