SUBJECT: Kaohsiung Vice Mayor Chiu Tai-san on Frank Hsieh's 
Presidential Candidacy 
 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Kaohsiung Vice Mayor Chiu Tai-san recently told 
AIT/K that it is widely anticipated within DPP circles that 
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh will select Kaohsiung's former 
acting Mayor Yeh Chu-lan as his running mate.  Despite a great deal 
of discontent in the party initially over Hsieh's primary victory, 
DPP members will pull out all stops to see him elected, Chiu said. 
Hsieh is a strong leader who will compromise as necessary but also 
hold the line as needed on cross-Strait policy, he added.  End 
summary. 
 
Presidential Election - Running Mate and Issues 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶2.  (SBU) Kaohsiung City Vice Mayor Chiu Tai-san recently predicted 
to AIT/K that DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh will select Yeh 
Chu-lan as his running mate.  DPP supporters will fully back Hsieh's 
choice, Chiu said, because "the winner takes all, and therefore 
Frank Hsieh has the right to choose his running mate." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Chiu said it will not become clear until after October 
what issues will resonate with Taiwan voters in the 2008 
presidential election.  As the campaigning starts to gather steam in 
October, President Chen will skillfully throw out a new issue every 
two weeks in the media to test the reaction of the people, Chiu 
suggested.  Any issue advanced by Chen that draws particular 
attention from voters will be in the forefront of the presidential 
campaign, he added. 
 
Frank Hsieh - Full of Tactics but No Cross-Strait Policy 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
¶4.  (SBU) To most people Hsieh may seem flexible and willing to 
compromise, Chiu said, but he is actually a tactical thinker who 
maneuvers to achieve his goals.  Hsieh does not have a publicly 
defined person or group identified as his "think tank", so it is not 
certain what approach he will take toward cross-Strait issues or 
potential pressure from China.  Hsieh's previous reluctance to 
clearly express his cross-Strait policy has attracted criticism from 
Deep Green party members.  Once he has formed a campaign team, 
however, Hsieh's views on important policy issues will become much 
clearer, Chiu suggested. 
 
President Chen and Frank Hsieh 
------------------------------ 
¶5.  (SBU) Chiu predicted that President Chen Shui-bian will be very 
bored after he finishes his tenure.  When asked whether President 
Chen will retain his influence in Taiwan's political arena, Chiu 
suggested that will depend on how the next president manages the 
relationship and handles his differences with the ex-president. 
Just as President Chen did not maintain a good relationship with 
former President Lee Teng-hui, Chiu observed, Hsieh will run the 
same risk with soon-to-be former President Chen.
