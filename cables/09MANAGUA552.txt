SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In May 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of seven Embassy registered property claims.  There 
remain 592 unresolved registered property claims belonging to 284 
U.S. citizens in the Embassy's database.  To date, the overwhelming 
majority of resolutions have involved compensation via 
government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de 
indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of May 31, 2009, the GON had issued 
BPIs with a face value of $339,755,164.59 to Embassy-registered 
claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega 
administration has resolved 81 claims, thirty-four of which during 
the 2008-2009 waiver year.

¶2. On May 12, 2009, the Attorney General's Office provided the 
Embassy a copy of the final settlement document stating that U.S. 
citizen Maximo Alejandro Blanco had decided to settle his claim 
through BPIs on April 29, 2009.  On May 14, Mr. Blanco told the 
Embassy Property Office that he had settled his claim by accepting 
BPIs deposited in escrow at the Ministry of Finance.  Mr. Blanco 
received BPIs worth 356,600 cordobas, approximately $17,605.  We 
have updated our database to reflect this settlement.
