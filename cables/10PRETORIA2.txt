South Africa to Strengthen Ties with BRIC Countries 
 
¶4.  (U) Business Day reported on 29 December that South Africa 
planned to strengthen trade ties next year with other dynamic 
industrializing economies such as China, India, and Brazil, which 
united in a common front at this month's climate change talks in 
Copenhagen.  The common position of the four countries, which all 
have industrializing economies but are burdened with severe 
developmental challenges, is a binding force in international 
negotiations on a number of fronts as they resist attempts by 
developed nations to categorize them as developed, rather than 
developing.  What the world needed with trade and climate change 
negotiations, Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said this week, 
was for developed countries to make big concessions to developing 
countries to build a fairer world. Instead, strong demands for 
concessions were made against the larger developing countries, 
including SA.  As far as strengthening south- south trade was 
concerned, Davies said discussions were in the pipeline on an 
enlargement of the trade agreement between India, the Southern 
African Customs Union (Sacu) and Latin American trade grouping 
Mercosur. [Johannesburg Business Day Online in English -- Website of
