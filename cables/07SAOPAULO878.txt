SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Calling the operations of street vendors a "racket," Sao 
Paulo assistant Mayor Andrea Matarazzo told Consul General (CG) that 
he has been cracking down on the sale of pirated and counterfeit 
goods by both stores and vendors.  He associated the vendors' 
activities with organized criminal activity perpetrated by the First 
Capital Command (PCC) in Sao Paulo and drug traffickers in Rio de 
Janeiro, saying that "today's pirated CD is tomorrow's stray 
bullet."  Matarazzo, a friend and advisor of Governor Jose Serra, 
decried what he referred to as the "glamorization of the favela" 
(urban slum), as evidenced by the popularity of the movie "Tropa da 
Elite."  He also praised Governor Serra's tough stance against 
crime, pointing to the long and continuing period of tranquility in 
Sao Paulo's streets and prisons since the 2006 PCC uprising, and 
citing the Serra administration's success at preventing cell phone 
use by state prisoners and the Governor's efforts to better control 
the military and civil police and improve their performance.  Septel 
will report Matarazzo's perspectives on the national political scene 
and prospects for the 2008 and 2010 elections.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) CG called on the Assistant Mayor in his City Hall office 
on October 22.  Matarazzo wears two hats in the municipal 
government, both appointed positions: he is Assistant Mayor 
responsible for the downtown (Se or Cathedral) district, and is 
Secretary in charge of coordination of Sao Paulo's 31 administrative 
 
SIPDIS 
districts ("subprefeituras").  Matarazzo, who served as a Minister 
and later an Ambassador under President Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
(FHC), went to work in the city government in January 2005 when his 
friend and colleague Jose Serra assumed office as Mayor.  When Serra 
resigned in March 2006 to run for Governor, Matarazzo stayed on, in 
part to help the new Mayor, Gilberto Kassab, find his way, and in 
part to ensure that Serra would continue to exercise influence in 
City Hall. 
 
---------------- 
RUNNING THE CITY 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) He appears to be carrying out these mandates with vigor. 
He occupies the Vice-Mayor's office one floor above the Mayor's - 
since Kassab replaced Serra, there is no incumbent Vice-Mayor. 
Matarazzo serves as de facto chief operating officer for a city of 
11 million residents and a budget of more than USD 10 billion. 
Matarazzo referred to "Serra's different management model" as the 
city's organizing principle and spoke as if he and Serra jointly 
personify the municipal government, and as if Mayor Kassab were 
merely an appendage or an afterthought.  At one point he commented 
that Kassab (see ref A), a member of the Democratic Party (DEM), "is 
doing well in a PSDB administration," a reference to Serra's Social 
Democracy Party of Brazil (PSDB).  He estimated that about 80% of 
City Hall officials are PSDB members. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Matarazzo said he and Serra had picked the Assistant 
 
SAO PAULO 00000878  002 OF 003 
 
 
Mayors, trying to reform a machine system in which each Assistant 
Mayor was beholden to a City Council member and was mainly 
responsible for looking after that Councilman's friends and other 
interests in the district.  Under Serra (and now Kassab), he said, 
Assistant Mayors are expected to shun corruption and favoritism and 
deliver competent administration, and Matarazzo's job is to ensure 
uniformity across the 31 districts.  He claimed to have just shut 
down three projects in the upscale Jardins neighborhood that were 
being run by friends of his. 
 
-------------------------- 
NO NEED FOR STREET VENDORS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) There are two kinds of street vendors ("ambulantes" or 
"camelos" in Portuguese) in Sao Paulo, Matarazzo explained.  Some 
are employed by the PCC to sell stolen goods, while others sell 
contraband smuggled into Brazil by the organization of master 
smuggler Law Kim Chong, who recently completed a three-year prison 
term for bribery.  Of all the vendors in Sao Paulo, according to 
Matarazzo, only about 4,000 have licenses and can be considered 
legal, most of them working downtown or in adjacent neighborhoods. 
Matarazzo plans to get rid of the licensing system by the end of the 
year, because he believes the city has no need of street vendors. 
"It's a racket," he said.  He claims that 60% of street vendors are 
Bolivian illegal aliens who sell pirated products and contraband, 
and many of the rest are Nigerians who sell drugs. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) According to Matarazzo, in Marta Suplicy's last year as 
Mayor (2004), authorities seized 30,000 pirated CDs in the city.  In 
2006, "I seized 1.5 million, and this year it will be over two 
million."  (Note: Post has not verified these numbers.  End Note.) 
He claimed to have gotten rid of all the street vendors in Santo 
Amaro, the district in southern Sao Paulo where the Consulate is 
located, and to have several times closed down the notorious "Stand 
Center" on Avenida Paulista in the heart of the business district, 
acknowledging that "when they can demonstrate their license is in 
order and they're complying with the law," he has to let it re-open. 
 "I play the bad guy," he said with some relish, noting that he had 
taken a similar approach in implementing Mayor Kassab's "Clean City" 
program, which aims to reduce visual pollution by banning billboards 
and restricting the number and size of store signs.  Matarazzo 
recently hired Delegado Mario Jordao Toledo Leme, a Consulate 
contact who just stepped down as Chief of the state Civil Police, to 
coordinate efforts to crack down on piracy and organized crime. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Matarazzo indicated that the city is close to unveiling a 
major program to clean up the notorious, aptly-named, run-down 
"Cracolandia" downtown neighborhood (see ref B).  There will be 25 
new projects, he said, with a variety of incentives for businesses 
to locate in the area, and the creation of 23,000 new jobs. 
According to press reports, Mayor Kassab put on a hard hat last 
Friday and operated a wrecker as the city began to demolish 
condemned buildings in Cracolandia.  It hopes to destroy 50 in a 
two-block stretch of one of the worst streets by January and to 
begin construction of several government office buildings.

STATE VS. PCC

SAO PAULO 00000878  003 OF 003 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Matarazzo asserted that Governor Serra's hard-nosed 
approach to governance has been particularly effective in fighting 
crime.  In contrast with previous administrations, he said, Serra 
has shown "no weakness."  Since he took office in January, there 
have been no new PCC outbursts.  Law enforcement authorities have 
succeeded in disrupting cell phone conversations between PCC members 
in prison and those on the outside.  More importantly, Serra and his 
Secretary for Public Security, Ronaldo Marzagao, have regained 
 
SIPDIS 
control over the military and civil police, which Matarazzo said, 
without elaborating, had been lost during the administration of the 
late Governor Mario Covas (1995-2001).  Serra's approach to 
combating crime is both preventive and repressive, Matarazzo said, 
and is delivering results. 
 
¶9.  (U) Matarazzo deplored what he referred to as the "glamorization 
of the favela" by media and the entertainment industry.  This, he 
said, explains the enormous popularity of movies like current hit 
film "Tropa da Elite" (see ref C), about a special operations unit 
in Rio de Janeiro's slums.  "Everybody loves cops and robbers, good 
guys and bad guys," he said, but the public still sometimes 
underestimates the real damage done by urban organized crime 
activity.  "Today's pirated CD is tomorrow's stray bullet," he said 
in justification of the city's no-nonsense approach to combating 
piracy.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Comment: Matarazzo - descendent of one of Brazil's 
wealthiest and most prominent families - comes across as a 
self-promoter, satisfied and comfortable with the authority he 
derives from the Mayor and Governor and clearly enjoying its 
exercise.  Some of the successes he reports on both the city and 
state levels may be exaggerated, and not all his claims can be 
verified.  But the city and some of its grittier neighborhoods are 
noticeably cleaner, less disorderly, and more vendor-free than they 
used to be (though traffic remains horrendous), and the PCC has in 
fact been quiet, if not entirely quiescent, for more than a year. 
One thing Matarazzo is not exaggerating, in our view, is his 
closeness to Governor Serra.  If Serra had not lost the 2006 PSDB 
presidential nomination to Geraldo Alckmin, Matarazzo would have 
been his senior campaign manager, and if Serra runs for president in 
2010 and wins, he is almost sure to be named a Minister.  Post will 
report septel his comments on the national political panorama.  End 
Comment.
