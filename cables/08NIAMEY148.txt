SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY PLANS TO OPEN MISSION IN 
NIGER AND OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS 
 
¶1. Former Turkish Ambassador to Sudan and Chad, Dr. Ali Engin 
Oba, paid a courtesy call on me during his 48-hour stop in 
Niger.  Oba informed me that the Goverment of Turkey (GOT) 
assigned him special envoy status to explore the 
possibilities of opening more embassies in Sub-Saharan 
Africa.  He said the GOT wished to expand its relations with 
more African nations for a variety of reasons, including 
investment opportunities and possible better support for 
Turkish initiatives at the United Nations. 
 
¶2. Oba informed me he met with Government of Niger (GON) 
President Tandja, Prime Minister Oumarou and Foreign Minister 
Mindaoudou about the GOT's desire to open a Mission in Niger 
before the end of calendar year 2008.  (Oba noted that the 
GOT mission in Abuja currently covers Niger.  End note.)  He 
reported that the GON officials welcome the GOT's interest in 
opening an Embassy in Niamey.  In response to my question 
about the size of the future Mission, he suggested no more 
than a five-person team. 
 
¶3. Other prospective host countries in Africa for Turkish 
Missions include Mozambique, Mali and Liberia (ETA Monrovia 
06Feb2008).
