No Support for Kosovo Independence 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. During the February 19 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Liu Jianchao referred reporters to his statement yesterday regarding 
the declaration of independence in Kosovo.  Liu added that the two 
sides should find a way to resolve the issue.  The spokesman also 
said UN Security Council Resolution 1244 remains applicable until 
the Security Council agrees on a new resolution.  Unilateral action 
on the issue could have serious consequences. 
 
¶3. When pressed on why China was interested in Kosovo, Liu responded 
that the issue had a bearing on the peace and stability of the 
region and the relevance of the Security Council.  China supports 
the goal of a multi-ethnic society.  Liu also said that Taiwan had 
no right to recognize any country as it is a part of China. 
 
Meetings with Assistant Secretary Hill 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Liu confirmed that A/S Hill and AFM He Yafei exchanged views on 
the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula during meetings while A/S 
Hill was in Beijing.  Liu said China hopes that the enhanced 
cooperation of relevant countries would produce results on this 
issue.  He declined to comment on any rumored meetings between the 
United States and the DPRK or on potential meetings to take place in 
Shenyang in the coming weeks. 
 
UN Efforts in Burma 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. Liu said that UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari briefed VM Wang Yi on the 
situation in Burma and that China's cooperation with the UN and the 
international community has been fruitful.  China supports the 
mediation efforts of the UN and hopes that Burma will continue on a 
road towards peace, stability and democratization.  Liu emphasized 
that the Burma issue will be solved by the people of Burma and their 
government, not by "outside pressure." 
 
High Concern Over U.S. Satellite Destruction 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. When asked about United States' intentions to destroy an 
out-of-control satellite, Liu said that China was highly concerned 
over the action and would watch the situation closely.  China "hopes 
that the United States will fulfill its obligations to the 
international community."  Liu emphasized that China is "not the 
only country" which has expressed concern over the announcement. 
 
Ongoing Efforts in Darfur 
------------------------- 
 
¶7. When asked what message Special Envoy Liu Guijin would be 
delivering to the Sudanese Government on his upcoming trip, Liu 
responded that the visit was part of Liu's ongoing efforts to 
conduct consultations with Sudan on progress being made there. 
China feels the international community should speed up the peace 
process and that the peace talks should include those parties which 
are currently excluded.  Asked directly whether China supports a new 
round of peace talks, Liu said that China plays a constructive role 
in Sudan along with all relevant countries. 
 
Xinjiang Terrorist Arrests 
-------------------------- 
 
¶8. The spokesperson said that he had seen reports that China's 
public security forces had made a raid on "terrorists" in Xinjiang. 
Liu added that China's position on terrorists is firm and in line

with that of the international community. 
 
Dumplings, FDA 
-------------- 
 
¶9. When asked to explain the difference between the Chinese and 
Japanese position on the dumpling issue, Liu disputed that there was 
a "difference in position" and said that the two countries would 
work together to resolve the issue.  The spokesperson also confirmed 
that China had responded to questions from the United States 
regarding medication made in China.
