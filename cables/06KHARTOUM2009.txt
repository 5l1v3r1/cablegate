¶1.  Summary: Opposition parties have reacted vocally to the move by 
the Minister of Finance to raise fuel and sugar prices.  Opposition 
members of the National Assembly have called for the Assembly to be 
recalled from its summer recess. Some groups are calling for civil 
action, most likely in the form of a stay home strike on Saturday, 
August 26. The NCP is rallying its members to support the price 
increases and, at the same time, reject the US-UK plan for UN 
peacekeepers in Darfur. End Summary. 
 
Opposition Parties Condemn Price Increases 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  The Minister of Finance announced increases in the price for 
gasoline, diesel and sugar on August 17 (reftel). In reaction, 
opposition parties have voiced their criticism of the government. 
The SPLM, although a member of the Government of National Unity 
(GNU), quickly spoke out against the increases claiming that it was 
not even consulted, in spite of the Minister of Finance's statement 
that the increase was passed by the Council of Ministers. 
 
¶3. The Umma, the Popular Congress, the Baathist, the Nasirists and 
the Communist parties all opposed the price increases. Some of these 
parties are currently circulating hand-outs among the people calling 
for civil action and suggesting that the public not go to work as an 
expression of protest to the increases. The NDA in spite of their 
participation in the GNU, opposed the increases and threatened to 
withdraw from the GNU if the government does not reverse its 
decision 
 
¶4. Public transportation was disrupted by the increase in fuel 
prices. Some transport companies increased tickets prices while 
others stopped operating temporarily. As a result, bus terminals 
were congested and commuters delayed. 
 
NCP to Meet 
----------- 
 
¶5. The NCP called for an urgent meeting of party officials on August 
23, to discuss the price increases as well as the US-UK proposal of 
deployment of international troops in Darfur. The meeting of the NCP 
leading officials will be attended by the NCP parliamentary members 
in a step to mobilize them to support the price increases and to 
support President Bashir in his rejection of the "foreign 
intervention" in Darfur.
