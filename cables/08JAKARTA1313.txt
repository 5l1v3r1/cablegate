¶1. FAS/Jakarta received 8 Jul 08 a decree dated 1 Jul 08 from Dr. 
Tjeppy Soedjana, Director General Livestock Services (DGLS), 
Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture banning the importation into 
Indonesia of US poultry.  Unofficial translation follows. 
 
 
"DGLS decree

¶2.  FAS/Jakarta has sought a meeting this week with DGLS to clarify 
this decree, which appears to be based on a 10 Jun 08 notification 
to the OIE by USDA confirming an outbreak of Low Path Avian 
Influenza (LPAI) in Arkansas.  Background and talking points as soon 
as possible from USDA/W would be greatly appreciated.
