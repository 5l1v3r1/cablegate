SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: JUNE 2009 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In June 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of nine Embassy registered property claims.  A U.S. 
citizen claimant also withdrew one claim because he did not have 
sufficient documents to support his case. There remain 582 
unresolved registered property claims belonging to 278 U.S. citizens 
in the Embassy's database.  To date, the overwhelming majority of 
resolutions have involved compensation via government-issued 
indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). 
As of June 30, 2009, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of 
$341,992,084.59 to Embassy-registered claimants.  Since taking 
office in January 2007, the Ortega administration has resolved 90 
claims, forty-three of which during the 2008-2009 waiver year.
