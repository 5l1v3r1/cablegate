To the Syrian News Agency (SANA), for distribution 
 
An official source announced the following: 
 
Four U.S. helicopters coming from Iraq today violated Syrian 
airspace in the area of Abu Kamal at the Sakkariya farm.  The 
helicopters targeted a civilian building which lead to the deaths of 
citizen Daoud Mohammed Al Abdullah and his four children, citizen 
Ahmad Khalifa and citizen Ali Abbas Hassan and his wife and the 
injury of another citizen.  The American helicopters then returned 
to Iraq. 
 
Syria condemns this aggressive act and holds the U.S. forces 
responsible for this aggression and for all that proceeds from it. 
Syria also demands that the Iraqi government take responsibility and 
launch an investigation immediately into this grave violation. 
Syria also demands that the Iraqi government prevent/forbid the use 
of Iraqi territory for aggression against Syria. 
 
The Vice Foreign Minister called in the U.S. Charge d'Affaires in 
Damascus and informed her of Syria's protest and condemnation of 
this grave attack and that it holds the U.S. Administration 
completely responsible for it.  The Iraqi Charge d'Affaires was also 
called in to the Foreign Ministry for the same purpose.
