¶1. (SBU) To ensure wide distribution among concerned Turkish 
agencies, we provided a copy of ref A letter containing an 
updated U.S. request in WTO services negotiations to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and hand-delivered to Foreign 
Trade Undersecretariat (FTU) Deputy Director General for 
Multilateral Affairs Hasan Yalcin on June 27.  Yalcin agreed 
to pass this information to State Minister for Foreign Trade, 
Kursad Tuzmen, who will attend the ministerial meetings in 
Geneva beginning June 28, as well as to other Turkish 
agencies.  During our discussion of the current state of the 
Doha Round (ref B), Yalcin focused on Turkey's proposal for 
special treatment for the textiles sector and asked for 
clarification on the U.S.'s position.  Per conversations with 
State and USTR, we explained that a U.S. position was under 
review.  Yalcin asked for our assistance in scheduling a 
meeting between Minister Tuzmen and USTR Schwab in Geneva, 
the request for which was coordinated through the Turkish 
embassy in Washington. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Yalcin reiterated that Turkey's views on the NAMA 
negotiations are close to those of the U.S.  On agriculture 
however, Turkey does not support dramatic reuctions in 
tariffs because they are the GOT's only means of protecting 
Turkey's sensitive agriculture sector, which accounts for 30% 
of employment, from foreign competition.  "The import 
pressure is far more important than our export potential when 
it comes to agriculture," he added. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  We do not see that Turkey will take a 
helpful position in pushing for a Doha Round conclusion that 
provides for significantly greater market access in 
agriculture.  While Turkey views itself as a developed 
country for the purposes of NAMA discussions, it falls more 
into line with the EU on agricultural issues.  However, 
Tuzmen and his trade team will continue to focus the bulk of 
their energy on trying to protect Turkey's large but ailing 
textile sector, and they will most likely spend the majority 
of their time in Geneva focusing on this issue.  End comment.
