DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 33709 
 
(SBU) Econoff delivered reftel points to Abdulhakim 
al-Eryani, Director of the Foreign Minister's office, on 
April 8.  Eryani said the MFA would review the points, but 
commented that Yemen doesn't recognize Kosovo's sovereign 
status nor any other "unilateral" declaration of 
independence.  (Comment: This is likely an oblique reference 
to the ROYG's concern of giving legitimacy to the southern 
secessionist movement in Yemen.  End Comment.)
