SUBJECT: KHARTOUM - EAC MEETING ON POSSIBLE ATTACK ON EL 
FASHER 
 
 
¶1.  On December 5, 2006 an EAC meeting was held at Embassy 
Khartoum. Present were  DCM, POL, MGT, RSO, PAO, CON, USAID, 
JLE and RAO.  The subject was the threat of imminent attack 
on the capital city of North Darfur State, El Fasher by 
combined forces of SLA/M and NRF as a follow-up to recent 
skirmishes between janjaweed and the rebel forces in the town 
of El Fasher.  Post Management and RSO, working with the JLE 
representative, had already ordered all official Americans 
and Embassy employees in El Fasher to seek safe haven in 
Nyala, South Darfur, and the EAC received confirmation of 
their successful departure from El Fasher during the meeting. 
 
¶2.  The consensus of the EAC was to validate the Post,s 
actions in ordering the employees to a safe haven area and to 
request the issueance of a new  warden message. 
 
¶3.  The EAC also discussed how the possible attack on El 
Fasher might affect the upcoming visit of Special Envoy 
Natsios to Post, and the possibility of a ripple effect in 
the other Darfur state capitals and Khartoum.  No additional 
action in Khartoum or the other main Darfur cities was called 
for at this time.  Post will re-evaluate based on what 
happens in El Fasher in the next 24 to 48 hours.
