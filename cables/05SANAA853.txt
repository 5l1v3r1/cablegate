REF: SANAA 265 
 
¶1.  USAID Director and Pol/Econoff met March 28 with Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Planning and International 
Cooperation Ahmad Sofan.  USAID Director conveyed that 
Yemen's MCC Threshold paper was very strong (reftel), and 
urged the ROYG to focus on specific reforms within the MCC 
categories rule of law and corruption.  Sofan agreed that 
such a focus is the goal of his ministry as it works to 
coordinate government departments and develop an 
implementation plan.  USAID Director offered to bring in 
experts to assist the ROYG identify priorities and develop 
program activities.  Sofan emphasized that MOPIC does not 
want to use outsiders as part of this process, and instead 
wantS the change to "come from inside". 
 
¶2.  Comment.  Post supports MOPIC's autonomous approach, 
which is compatible with MCC objectives.  Real progress on 
critical issues of corruption and rule of law will likely not 
occur if perceived to be imposed from the outside.  There is 
some risk that MOPIC is using this tactic to avoid 
undertaking difficult reforms.  Despite Sofan's official 
position, MOPIC officials and USAID agreed in unofficial 
discussions that USAID expertise will be available to ROYG 
committees as they work on details of the Threshold 
implementation plan.  End Comment.
