The Ministry of Popular Power for Foreign Affairs of the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela raises its strongest protest 
to the Government of the United States of America for the 
incursion of a United States Air Force aircraft into 
Venezuelan airspace, on May 17, 2008, an action which 
violates international law and is rejected by our Government. 
 
The Ministry of Popular Power for Foreign Affairs of the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela urges the Embassy of the 
United States of America to relate this protest to the 
relevant authorities of its country, and demands that the 
Government of the United States take necessary steps to 
ensure no further violations of this nature, and guarantee 
absolute respect for the sovereignty of the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela.
