¶1. Summary: The Indonesian firm PT Multijaya Sparindo (Sparindo) 
verified on April 3 its order of T-56 engine for C-130 aircrafts 
detailed in reftel.  Sparindo supplies the Indonesian Air Force 
(IAF) with engines and aircraft spare parts.  It also serves as a 
local representative for U.S. aircraft parts supplier ILN 
Technologies Inc and Kellstrom Industries.  An IAF officer confirmed 
on April 3 that Sparindo is indeed a registered supplier on the 
IAF's supply list and the IAF intends to place an order for T-56 
engines in June 2007. End summary. 
 
¶2.  We contacted Milany T. Luwena from Sparindo on April 3 to verify 
order number 050021054.  Luwena confirmed that her company requested 
a "blanket export license order" for C-130 engines and spare-parts 
for 2007.  The blanket license, according to Luwena, is for an IAF 
order for T-56 engines for C-130 aircraft expected in June.  The $1 
million license value is an estimated value for the company's 
contract with IAF for 2007.  Sparindo will order the T-56 engine 
through their American seller ILN Technologies Inc, located at 21040 
Osborne Street, Canoga Park, CA 91304. 
 
¶3.  PT Multijaya Sparindo was established in 1988 to supply aircraft 
engines and spare-parts.  The company is also a Dutch representative 
agent for Fokker aircraft.   Their clients are the Indonesian Air 
Force, Indonesian National Police (for their Fokker-50 aircraft) and 
other Indonesian commercial aviation such as Garuda and Merpati 
airlines.  In August 2006, According to Luwena, Sparindo received an 
F-5 aircraft without engine and delivered it to IAF.  At present, 
Sparindo is also waiting for delivery of another engine for A-4 
aircraft ordered from New Zealand for the IAF.  In addition, 
Sparindo has regular procurement contracts with American Kellstrom 
Industries for C-130 spare parts and expects approximately 10 
deliveries in 2007. 
 
¶4.  We also contacted Indonesian Air Force Chief of Aeronautics, Air 
First Marshal Sunaryo, to verify this supplier.  Sunaryo confirmed 
that Sparindo is indeed a registered supplier on their list and has 
been one since 1998.  He said IAF plans to purchase engine and 
spare-parts for their C-130 aircraft through Sparindo for the 
2007/2008 budget timeframe.  Sunaryo also confirmed that the first 
order is estimated to start in June 2007.
