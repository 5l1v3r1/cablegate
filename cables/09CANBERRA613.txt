¶1. (U) On July 1, Jenny Bloomfield, Director of Middle East 
Section, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Michael 
Opie, Iran section officer, DFAT, discussed with us U.S.

African Union Summit (reftel).  They assured us they would 
share the message with the Africa desk and with the 
Australian delegation in Tripoli.

concerning the inappropriateness of Ahmadinejad's rants about 
Israel and Western governments in other fora.
