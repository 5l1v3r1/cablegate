¶1. (U) This is a combined PRT Babil-Najaf-Diwaniya message. 
 
¶2. (U) Responding to continuing electricity shortages from the 
national grid, South-Central provinces have begun to take the 
drastic step of circumventing central government control of the 
delivery of power to their provinces. Last month, Diwaniya 
Governor Khalil Jaleel Hamza boasted on TV of his decision to 
disconnect the "remote terminal unit" installed in the province, 
which affords the Ministry of Electricity central control over 
provincial energy access.  Following Diwaniya's action, the 
Najaf provincial council (PC) voted to do likewise.  The Babil 
PC has voted twice over the last two months also to bypass the 
national grid. (Note: Post has no indication that either of 
these latter provinces has yet acted on those resolutions.  End 
note.) On July 30, Minister of Electricity Kareem Waheed accused 
the South-Central provinces of Babil and Diwaniya (along with 
Basra and Nasiriya) of partial responsibility for a total 
blackout in Baghdad.  This criticism notwithstanding, provincial 
leaders have given no indication of retreating. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  With no end to the power crunch in sight and 
the heat -- generated both meteorologically and politically -- 
rising, the region's political leadership apparently feels 
compelled to act in an area where it believes the national 
government has been ineffective. If the national government 
fails to respond firmly to these self-help measures, other 
provinces can be expected to follow suit, leading to a "tragedy 
of the commons" situation in which the functioning of the entire 
national grid is compromised, to the detriment of users 
throughout the country, including the "cheating" provinces. End 
Comment.
