SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT: GABON 
 
¶1. The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens to the risks of 
travel to Gabon during the upcoming presidential elections 
following the death of Gabonese President El-Hadj Omar Bongo 
Ondimba.  The official election campaign period begins on 
August 16.  The elections are scheduled for August 30.  This 
Travel Alert expires on September 15, 2009. 
 
¶2. While the U.S. Embassy in Libreville expects the 
presidential election to develop peacefully and in an orderly 
fashion, American citizens should be aware that even peaceful 
gatherings and demonstrations can turn unexpectedly violent. 
Significant traffic congestion, shortages in hotel lodgings, 
and large crowds throughout the country, particularly in 
Libreville, are likely to inconvenience travelers. 
 
 
¶3. U.S. citizens in Gabon should remain aware of their 
surroundings, monitor their own security situations at all 
times, and avoid large public gatherings, protests, and 
demonstrations.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to report unusual 
events or activities to the U.S. Embassy. 
 
¶4. Updated information on travel and security in Gabon may be 
obtained from the Department of State by calling 1-888-407-4747 
toll-free within the U.S. and Canada, or by calling a regular 
toll line, 1-202-501-4444, from other countries.  Additional 
details can be found in the Department of State's Country 
Specific Information for Gabon and the Worldwide Caution, which 
are available on the Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶5. The Embassy is located in Centre Ville on the Boulevard du 
Bord de Mer, and may be reached at (241)-76-20-03/04 during 
business hours.  In case of emergency, a 24-hour duty officer 
may be reached after hours at (241) 07-38-01-71. 
 
¶6. Minimize considered.
