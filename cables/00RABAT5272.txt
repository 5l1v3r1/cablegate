COOPERATED WITH U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE

RECENT ACT OF INTERNATIONAL VIOLENCE PERPETRATED 
IN THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO OCCURRED AT A TOURIST

THAT IT WAS PLANNED AND EXEUCTED IN PART BY 
ALGERIAN EXTREMISTS.

REQUESTED NO RENDITIONS DURING THIS TIMEFRAME.

THE USG AND GOM, POST DOES NOT PERCEIVE THERE WOULD 
BE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO GOM PROSECUTION 
AND/OR EXTRADITION OF KNOWN TERRORISTS THAT ARE NOT 
MOROCCAN NATIONALS. 
 
¶D. THE GOM TRADITIONALLY ISSUES PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 
OPPOSITION TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.

MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 2000, LOCALLY OR 
INTERNATIONALLY. 
 
¶F. THE GOM DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, 
TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
¶G. THE GOM HAS NOT ISSUED ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF THE SEVEN TERRORIST-SUPPORTING NATIONS.

DIPLOMATS ACCREDITED TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO. 
 
¶H. THERE HAS BEEN NO GOM CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARDS 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR ITS SUPPORTERS IN 2000. 
 
¶I. THE USG AND GOM ARE FULLY COOPERATIVE ON 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND REGIONAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS.

SOUGHT GOM SUPPORT IN THE INVESTIGATION OR 
PROSECUTION OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR U.S. INTERESTS.
