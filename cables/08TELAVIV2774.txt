Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
HaQaretz reported that Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu told the 
newspaper that Likud is behind him and far-right-winger Moshe 
Feiglin will soon disappear. The Jerusalem Post reported that the 
Likud's internal court will meet Thursday to determine whether to 
demote Feiglin from his current realistic slot on the party's list 
for the February 10 election to one that could leave him outside the 
legislature.  Channel 2-TV reported Wednesday that a majority of the 
judges on the court were in favor of moving down Feiglin and 
advancing candidates elected to regional slots, for technical 
reasons. If so, Feiglin would move from No. 20 on the list to the 
35th slot.   HaQaretz (English Ed.) also reported that Secretary 
Condoleezza Rice dismissed Likud Chairman Benjamin NetanyahuQs 
Qeconomic peaceQ plan at a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels 
last week, saying that that the goal is a two-state solution. 
 
HaQaretz quoted a well-placed American source as saying that earlier 
this week President-elect Barack Obama's administration will offer 
Israel a "nuclear umbrella" against the threat of a nuclear attack 
by Iran.  The source, who is close to the new administration, said 
the U.S. will declare that an attack on Israel by Tehran would 
result in a devastating U.S. nuclear response against Iran.  But 
HaQaretz reported that America's nuclear guarantee to Israel could 
also be interpreted as a sign that the U.S. believes Iran will 
eventually acquire nuclear arms.  Maariv reported that a senior IAEA 
official told the newspaper that within a few months Iran will have 
enough uranium for a bomb.  The official was quoted as saying that 
the reactor at Natanz is a double-edged sword that can shift from a 
civilian to a military application within a short time. 
 
Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Zahar was quoted as saying in an 
interview with Israel Radio that a prisoner swap is possible within 
a day.  Leading media reported that, as Israel's leaders met 
Wednesday to discuss its military options following increasing 
numbers of missiles being launched into the western Negev from the 
Gaza Strip, the government approved transferring 100 million shekels 
(around $25 million) to Gaza banks.  The media cited opposition to 
the move by right-wing parties and media.  Speaking on Israel Radio, 
Vice PM Haim Ramon also strongly criticized the idea. 
 
In an interview with The Jerusalem Post, Gen. Keith Dayton, the U.S. 
Army General who is overseeing the training in Jordan of the PAQs 
National Security Force for the West Bank, praised the new recruits 
as the Qmost capable Palestinian security forces that have ever been 
fielded here," and firmly played down the notion that they might one 
day come to turn their weapons on Israel.   Dayton told the daily 
that the trainees are taught over and again that "you are not here 
to learn how to fight against the Israeli occupation."  Their focus, 
rather, he said, is "totally on the lawless elements within 
Palestinian society." 
 
Leading media reported that Zeev Braude, the West Bank settler who 
was caught on film shooting at Palestinians last week, was indicted 
in Jerusalem's Magistrate's court yesterday.  The Magistrate has 
moved to release Braude with restrictions while the State 
Prosecutor's Office appealed to the Jerusalem District Court against 
the release. The appeal will be heard this morning.  Braude was 
released from police custody just hours before the indictment was 
announced.  The indictment came after Braude's release because the 
presiding judge Q a settler -- refused to extend his remand until an 
appeal was served. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that the American Jewish Committee and 
the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations 
refused to support unequivocally a call by FM Tzipi Livni for Qall 
countries who care about Israel and oppose anti-SemitismQ to boycott 
the second Durban Conference against Racism, scheduled to be held in 
April at the UN headquarters in Geneva.   On Tuesday, Livni held a 
conference call with Jewish organizations throughout the world.  The 
participants discussed the FMQs statement of November 19, in which 
she declared that QIsrael will not participate and will not 
legitimize the [Durban] review conference, which will be used as a 
platform for further anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic activity.  We 
call upon the international community not to participate. 
 
Major media reported that yesterday the Counter-Terrorism Bureau 
issued a travel advisory warning Israelis against traveling to 
India's Goa region during the end-of-year holiday season.  The 
statement said that the terror threat inside India is Qconcrete and 
very high. 
 
Israel Hayom reported that yesterday the KnessetQs Finance Committee 
allocated 281 million shekels (around $72 million) to yeshivas and 
the territories. 
 
Yediot reported that Labor Party minister Ami Ayalon announced 
yesterday that he will resign from the government, bowing to his 
partyQs demands. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that after being used for more than 40 
years of faithful service, the Israel Air Force is on the hunt for a 
replacement for the A-4 Skyhawk attack planes. 
 
Yediot cited an official Interior Minister document stating that 
African refugees will be relocated to peripheral areas. 
 
HaQaretz reported that the University of California (UC) will soon 
allow students to return to studying abroad.  The UC system was 
among scores of American universities that suspended their Israel 
study-abroad programs in 2002 after the State Department placed 
Israel on its travel advisory list for safety reasons.  Israel 
remains on the list. 
 
Maariv presented the results of a TNS/Teleseker poll on voting 
intentions for the Knesset elections: 
In brackets: Maariv's December 1 poll): 
Likud:31  (33); Kadima:28 (29);  Labor Party: 12 (10): Yisrael 
Beiteinu: 11 (10); Arab parties: 10 (10); Shas:9 (8);  National 
Union Party and National-Religious Party:6 (6); Meretz:5 (7); United 
Torah Judaism and assimilated: 5 (5); Green Party 3 (2).

¶1.  Iran: 
--------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized:  There is 
reason to fear that the United States will accept a nuclear Iran for 
lack of an alternative.... But until this comes about, Israel must 
give Obama's new policy a chance and let him leave no stone unturned 
in an attempt to stop the Iranian bomb.

"A New Approach to Iran" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (12/11): QU.S. 
President-elect Barack Obama intends to fundamentally change 
Washington's policy toward Iran.  In an interview a few days ago, 
Obama proposed direct talks with Iran and offered economic 
incentives for halting its nuclear program.  In doing so, Obama 
reconfirmed his campaign promises to open a dialogue with Iran 
without preconditions.... Obama's proposal will be an opportunity to 
open new relations between the United States and Iran after nearly 
three decades of separation, isolation and rivalry.  It is also a 
recognition of the Bush administration's failure to stop Tehran's 
nuclear program. Israel, which sees the Iranian nuclear program as 
its greatest security threat, has an interest in the success of 
Obama's efforts. The existing sanctions policy has not proved 
effective.... It is important for Israel not to block [Obama's] way, 
and for its leaders to refrain from posturing and taking steps that 
may hinder the American-Iranian dialogue.... There is reason to fear 
that the United States will accept a nuclear Iran for lack of an 
alternative, and invest its diplomatic effort into setting new rules 
of the game in the Middle East and in strengthening deterrence, 
instead of prevention. But until this comes about, Israel must give 
Obama's new policy a chance and let him leave no stone unturned in 
an attempt to stop the Iranian bomb.

¶2.  Mideast: 
------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Liberal columnist and anchor Ofer Shelach wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv: QIsrael failed in handling the Shalit question, a 
shameful moral and professional failure.  This failure negates the 
right of the state's leader, today and after the elections, to 
prolong the suffering of Gilad and his family. 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: QWith 
nearly a billion people today starving in Asia and Africa, is it not 
unconscionable to speak of Qmass famineQ in Gaza?

¶I.  "We Failed and We Have to Pay" 
 
Liberal columnist and anchor Ofer Shelach wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (12/11): QThe new prime minister in Israel will 
decide that that's it, there is no point in holding the Shalit 
family in the unbelievable path of agony in which they have been 
living for the past 900 days.  There are no alternatives, no new 
thoughts, not even a new set of national values, the kind that Ehud 
Olmert spoke about long ago.  We are waiting.  In this situation, 
Gilad must return home.... Israel did not keep its contract with its 
citizens, and therefore no one has the right to say that he has a 
national consideration that outweighs the suffering of the Shalit 
family.  When Shalit was taken prisoner, an arrogant and obtuse 
leadership saw an opportunity for a new order in the Gaza Strip, as 
a priority far higher than taking efficient action for his release. 
When it became apparent that an arrangement was slow in coming, 
there was no permanent team that handled the matter, equipped with 
instructions with historical backing and a leadership rationale, and 
armed with knowledge and flexible and original thinking 
processes.... Israel failed in handling the Shalit question, a 
shameful moral and professional failure.  This failure negates the 
right of the state's leader, today and after the elections, to 
prolong the suffering of Gilad and his family.  Only a real leader 
and a system of sterling quality would be entitled to do so, and 
these are things that we do not have. 
 
 
 
 
II.  "Human Rights & Wrongs" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (12/11): 
Q[Top UN Human Rights official Professor Richard FalkQs] reflections 
have led him to conclude that Israel is now QslouchingQ toward 
another Holocaust.  But this time, it is the Jews who may be 
dreaming of carrying out the genocide.  Falk asks: QIs it an 
irresponsible overstatement to associate the treatment of 
Palestinians with this criminalized Nazi record of collective 
atrocity?  I think notQ.... Fortunately for Hamas, Falk believes 
international law gives it the Qright of resistance.Q  So shortly 
after the Islamists grabbed control of Gaza in June 2007, he pleaded 
for the world to Qstart protecting the people of GazaQ from 
Israel.... Israel is trying to protect itself from Gaza.  We 
unilaterally pulled out our citizens and army from the Strip in 
¶2005.  Rather than use our departure to begin building a Palestinian 
state, Hamas vowed to keep QresistingQ and never accept a Jewish 
state in the region. Its loathing actually solidified Hamas's 
popularity among Gazans.... We do not claim that life in Gaza is 
easy, but so much of its misfortune is self-inflicted.  And at a 
time when the people of Zimbabwe and Congo are experiencing a true 
Qhumanitarian catastrophe,Q is it not obscene to talk of Gaza in 
those terms?  With nearly a billion people today starving in Asia 
and Africa, is it not unconscionable to speak of mass famine in 
Gaza?  Prof. Falk: If you want to help the people of Gaza, stop 
besmirching Israel and start beseeching Hamas to stop shooting and 
return the Strip to Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority.

¶3.  Human Rights:

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Contributor Gabi Nudelman wrote in the popular, pluralist Maariv 
(12/11): QAmerica used to be the self-appointed moral guardian of 
the word.... Today the Qleader of the free world is a pretext waved 
by all countries that infringe human rights.

"AmericaQs Splintered Dream" 
 
Contributor Gabi Nudelman wrote in the popular, pluralist Maariv 
(12/11): America used to be the self-appointed moral guardian of 
the word.... Its President was able to decide to bomb Sarajevo for 
months to avoid genocide.  Today the Qleader of the free worldQ is a 
pretext waved by all countries that infringe human rights.... The 
root of the evil mostly lies with 9/11, but no less with the Bush 
administration.... Unknown prisoners are jailed in an isolated 
prison, which turns OrwellQs apocalyptic vision into a childrens 
tale called the war on terror.
