¶1.  NAME OF COUNTRY:  TURKEY 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
¶A.  RESULTS OF ANY 1991 COURT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 

THERE WAS A MARKED INCREASE IN TERRORIST INCIDENTS IN 
TURKEY IN 1991.  INCLUDED AMONG THE VICTIMS IN THIS YEAR'S VIOLENCE WERE THREE AMERICANS.  ON THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY 7 AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WORKING AS A CONTRACTOR AT INCIRLIK AIR BASE WAS KILLED IN ADANA BY A DEV SOL ASSAILANT.  ON MARCH 22 THE SAME GROUP KILLED THE AMERICAN MANAGER OF VINNEL, BROWN, ROOT (VBR) AT HIS WORKPLACE IN ISTANBUL.   IN OCTOBER, AN AIR FORCE 
SERGEANT WAS MURDERED IN ANKARA WHEN A BOMB PLACED IN HIS TRUCK EXPLODED.  THE ISLAMIC JIHAD, AN IRANIAN-SUPPORTED GROUP, CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS 
ATTACK AND A SIMILAR ONE AGAINST AN EGYPTIAN DIPLOMAT ON THE SAME DAY MARWICK SLAYING, (AS WELL AS ON MARCH 26 ATTACK AGAINST AN IRAQI DIPLOMAT.)  DEV SOL ALSO CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTEMPTED KILLING OF A U.S. AIR FORCE LT. COLONEL IN IZMIR IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR. 
 
DEV-SOL ALSO ESCALATED ITS CAMPAIGN AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE NATION'S SECURITY APPARATUS.  IN LATE JANUARY THE GROUP KILLED RETIRED GENERAL SAYIN IN ADANA AND GENERAL SELEN IN ANKARA.  ON OCTOBER 13 DEV SOL 
MURDERED FORMER MIT UNDERSECRETARY RETIRED GENERAL ADNAN ERSOZ IN ISTANBUL.  EARLIER IN THE MONTH, THE DEV-SOL SHOT FIVE TURKISH NATIONAL POLICEMEN IN SEPARATE AMBUSHES IN ISTANBUL.  THE OCTOBER KILLINGS OF THE POLICEMEN AND OF GENERAL ERSOZ DEMONSTRATED RESUMED DEV-SOL CAPABILITIES, WHICH HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY MID-JULY POLICE RAIDS IN ANKARA AND ISTANBUL. 
 
DEV-SOL WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR SCORES OF BOMBINGS AGAINST AMERICAN, AS WELL AS OTHER FOREIGN, INTERESTS IN TURKEY, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON THE CONSULATE IN ADANA, THE TURKISH-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION IN IZMIR AND ADANA (THE LATTER BEING HIT TWICE) AND SEVERAL U.S. MILITARY RELATED BUILDINGS IN ISTANBUL AND IZMIR.  THE BOMBING ATTACKS PEAKED ON MARCH 16 WHEN 13 AMERICAN ASSOCIATED BUSINESSES WERE HIT IN ADANA, ANKARA, 
ISTANBUL AND IZMIR. 
 
THE YEAR ALSO WITNESSED A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN 
TERRORIST PKK ATTACKS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS IN THE 
SOUTHEAST - A FACT UNDERLINING THE CHANGING NATURE OF 
THE CONFLICT IN THE REGION.  ON OCTOBER 6 THE KURDISH 
SEPARATIST/TERRORIST GROUP ATTACKED A TURKISH MILITARY 
PATROL NEAR A BRIGADE SIZE GENDARMERIE POST IN CUKURCA AND KILLED 11 SOLDIERS.  THE ATTACK WAS THE BLOODIEST IN YEARS; THE GOVERNMENT THEN LAUNCHED A CROSS-BORDER OPERATION AGAINST SUSPECTED PKK CAMPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ. ON OCTOBER 25 AN ESTIMATED 400 TO 500 PKK GUERRILLAS ATTACKED A GENDARMERIE POST IN CUKURCA.  THE ATTACK LEFT 17 PEOPLE DEAD AND AN ADDITIONAL 60 WOUNDED, AND AGAIN CAUSED THE GOVERNMENT TO CROSS THE IRAQI BORDER IN PURSUIT OF THE GUERRILLAS.  DESPITE THE GROWING MILITARIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, THE PKK WAS STILL INVOLVED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF TERRORIST ACTIONS WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF NON-COMBATANTS. IN ADDITION TO THE KIDNAPPINGS OF 10 GERMAN TOURISTS ON AUGUST 2 AND OF FIVE RESEARCHERS, INCLUDING THREE AMERICAN CITIZENS IN LATE AUGUST, THE PKK HAS CONTINUED ITS CAMPAIGN AGAINST SELECTED CIVILIAN AND COMMERCIAL TARGETS IN THE REGION.  ON SEPTEMBER 26, FOR INSTANCE, TWO ANKARA UNIVERSITY ARCHEOLOGISTS WERE KILLED IN MARDIN BY A CAR BOMB. 
 
IN EARLY AUGUST THE MALATYA STATE SECURITY COURT 
RELEASED NINE OF 18 SUSPECTED DEV SOL MEMBERS WHO WERE ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN KILLINGS AND BOMBINGS IN ADANA.  THE RELEASE OF THE NINE SUSPECTS, WHO ARE 
BELIEVED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE MURDERS OF AN AMERICAN 
CITIZEN AND BRIGADIER GENERAL CINGOZ, BROUGHT TO 21 THE 
NUMBER OF ALLEGED DEV SOL MEMBERS FREED PENDING TRIAL. 
 
PEMBEGUL BINBIR, THE WOMAN WHO THREW A PIPE BOMB 
OVER THE WALL OF THE CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL IN 1989, WAS 
SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND FINED TL 30,000 
(ABOUT SIX US DOLLARS).  HOWEVER, BINBIR HAS FAILED TO 
APPEAR IN COURT SINCE SEPTEMBER 1990, AND HER SENTENCE WAS GIVEN IN ABSENTIA.  SHE REMAINS FREE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
¶B.  DID THE HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 

EMBASSY KNOWS OF NO REQUEST BY TURKEY THAT ANOTHER 
COUNTRY EXTRADITE A PRISONER SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN A TERRORIST ACT, NOR OF ANY REQUEST FROM A THIRD COUNTRY THAT TURKEY EXTRADITE A PRISONER FOR SIMILAR INVOLVEMENT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
¶C.  ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 

TURKEY RARELY PRESSES FOR THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, IN PART BECAUSE OF ITS CONCERN THAT WEST EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIVE TO SUCH REQUESTS. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT'S PROSECUTION RECORD AGAINST 
PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORIST RELATED 
INCIDENTS IS MIXED.  THE ABILITY OF SOME TERRORISTS 
GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY DEV-SOL, TO INTIMIDATE SECURITY AND COURT OFFICIALS MAKES DELIVERING JUSTICE A RISKY AND DIFFICULT BUSINESS.  ON OCTOBER 29, FOR EXAMPLE, TWO DEV SOL ACTIVISTS WHO WERE STANDING TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF FORMER GENERAL HULUSI SAYIN, ESCAPED FROM ANKARA CENTRAL PRISON.  IBRAHIM BINGOL AND LUTFU TOPAL REPORTEDLY WALKED AWAY FROM THE PRISON WHEN THE FACILITY WAS OPEN TO VISITORS.  THE CHIEF GUARD AND TEN OTHER PRISON OFFICIALS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DETAINED BY THE STATE SECURITY COURT PROSECUTOR ON SUSPICION OF AIDING THE "ESCAPE." 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
¶D.  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 

TURKEY HAS ROUTINELY CONDEMNED TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND HAS IN THE PAST COOPERATED WITH U.S. AUTHORITIES TO 
DETER TERRORIST THREATS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
¶E.  A REVIEW OF MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS 
UNDERTAKEN IN 1991, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 

ON JULY 12, A WEEK BEFORE THE SCHEDULED VISIT OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH, THE GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK A SERIES OF 
RAIDS AGAINST SUSPECTED DEV SOL SAFEHOUSES IN ISTANBUL AND ANKARA.  THE RAIDS, WHICH LED TO THE DEATH OF 10 DEV SOL MILITANTS, AND THE ARREST OF 12 OTHERS DEALT A SEVERE BLOW TO THE ORGANIZATION'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT ACTIVITIES IN THE COUNTRY'S TWO LARGEST CITIES.  THE SETBACK WAS, HOWEVER, ONLY TEMPORARY. 
 
FOLLOWING THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN THE 
GULF WAR AND THE RETURN TO NORTHERN IRAQ OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KURDISH REFUGEES, THE PKK BEGAN ONE OF ITS LARGEST, BLOODIEST, AND, IN SOME WAYS, MOST EFFECTIVE, TERRORIST CAMPAIGNS IN YEARS.  UNLIKE OFFENSIVES IN PREVIOUS YEARS, THE PKK ATTACKS WERE AIMED PRIMARILY AT TURKISH MILITARY OUTPOSTS AND MILITARY CONVOYS.   THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE ALSO SERVED TO HIGHLIGHT THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE SOUTHEAST.  THREE TIMES THIS YEAR, IN AUGUST AND TWICE IN OCTOBER, THE TURKISH MILITARY CONDUCTED CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS AGAINST PKK CAMPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ.  WITH THE CONFLICT IN THE SOUTHEAST SLOWLY MATURING INTO A FULLBLOWN 
INSURGENCY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY 
RELIANT ON THE MILITARY TO RESPOND TO THE PKK THREAT. 
 
TURKEY HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE RELEVANT  INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND AGREEMENTS ON TERRORISM. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
¶F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT, IF ANY, FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) POLITICAL AND 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST; DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT 
THROUGH DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, MISUSE OF THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH AND OTHER PRIVILEGES TO SUPPORT TERRORISM, SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS; AND POSITIONS TAKEN ON TERRORISM ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING VOTING RECORDS. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 

TURKEY PROVIDES NO SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
¶G.  HAS THE HOST COUNTRY MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 

NO. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
¶H.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1990, POSITIVE 
OR NEGATIVE, IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARD 
TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 

THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TURKEY'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM, 
WHICH REMAINS ONE OF RESOLUTE CONDEMNATION OF ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM.
