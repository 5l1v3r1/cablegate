PolChief delivered reftel points to Deputy Assistant Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Khaled al-Akwa on April 10, emphasizing 
that, while Yemen may not be in a position to assist Iraq 
financially, its political support for Iraq's reforms is no 
less important.  Al-Akwa said that his government had not yet 
received the invitation from the United Nations, but once 
received, would review the level of participation of other 
countries in the region, and inform the Embassy whether or 
not the Yemeni Government will attend the signing, and if so, 
at what level.
