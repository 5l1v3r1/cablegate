¶1. Per reftel request, Pretoria conducted a post-shipment 
check on license 050174483 for the export of one 
International Traffic in Arms(ITAR)-controlled Bell UH-1H 
helicopter to South Africa.  Post confirms that the 
non-military end-user, Leading Edge Aviation, is in 
possession of the aircraft and that it is being used for the 
purpose stated on the license application.  Leading Edge 
Aviation has purchased ITAR-controlled helicopters for 
fire-fighting previously and presented scanned documentation 
indicating that the helicopter in question is not militarily 
configured (Ref B). 
 
¶2.  As indicated in scanned documentation submitted via 
e-mail to PM/DTCC, the South African Civil Aviation 
registered the helicopter and restricted its use in an 
air-worthiness certificate issued to Leading Edge Aviation. 
The documentation volunteered by Leading Edge mentions a 
lease to Bird Dog Aviation, yet Leading Edge owner Mark 
Jackson confirmed he is the pilot/engineer who operates and 
maintains the helicopter, which is being for used for 
fire-fighting and is currently operating from Donkerhook 
Farm, near Stellenbosch Western Cape.  As indicated ref B, we 
would appreciate guidance on follow-up questions regarding 
the lease issue.  Leading Edge has been very forthcoming and 
has invited the Embassy to inspect the aircraft at our 
convenience.
