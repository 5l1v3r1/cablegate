civilians, preparations for the referenda, and the need for 
the UN to begin planning for its post-referenda presence in 
Sudan.  End Summary. 
 
U/SYG Le Roy on UN Priorities 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Under Secretary-General for the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations Alain Le Roy briefed the Security 
Council on January 26 about the critical period that lies 
ahead for implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
(CPA).  Le Roy identified the key remaining issues as 
creating a space for credible elections, including allowing 
freedom of speech and assembly; reaching agreement on census 
results, resource and wealth-sharing; and border demarcation, 
including implementation of the Permanent Court of 
Arbitration (PCA) decision on Abyei.  He noted that the AU 
Summit in Addis would allow the UN and the AU to harmonize 
their approaches to these issues.  Le Roy also said that the 
UN was extremely concerned by the level of violence in the 
South and the availability of weapons, and that the mission 
would prioritize protection of civilians (POC).

¶3.  Ambassador Rice discussed escalating violence in southern 
Sudan, noting that increased weapons flows had been a major 
factor fueling this violence.  She asked the UN to help 
determine who is responsible for these weapons inflows.  Rice 
also acknowledged that while security is the responsibility 
of the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS), UNMIS could do 
more to protect civilians.  She urged the UN to assist with 
preparations for the referenda and to report in greater 
detail on these preparations in its next report.  Rice 
encouraged the UN to begin considering how its presence in 
Sudan post-referendum should be defined, indicating that the 
Council would welcome recommendations from the 
Secretary-General. 
 
¶4.  Both the UK and France urged the Secretariat to begin 
considering reconfiguration of UNMIS post-referenda, with the 
UK specifically asking how the UN would interact with the 
African Union High Level Panel on Darfur (AUPD), led by 
former South African President Mbeki.  Both urged the UN to 
appoint a strong SRSG to replace SRSG Qazi.  The UK 
emphasized that elections must take place on time because any 
resulting delay to the referenda would result in renewed 
hostilities.  France said that the number one priority for 
UNMIS should be POC. 
 
¶5.  Russia emphasized the important role of the AU and 
neighbors in CPA implementation.  Regarding the future 
presence of the UN in Sudan, Russia stressed that the parties 
to the CPA must be consulted in a timely fashion.  Both 
Russia and China stated that increased pressure should be 
placed on rebel groups to engage in the Darfur political 
process so that an agreement could be reached prior to 
elections. 
 
African Council Members Views 
----------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Both Uganda and Nigeria said that the potential for 
conflict in Sudan remains high.  Nigeria and Gabon urged 
implementation of the AUPD recommendations, and Gabon 
expressed strong support for unity and the holistic approach 
of the AUPD.  Uganda welcomed the joint efforts of UNMIS and 
MONUC to address conflict created by the Lord's Resistance 
Army (LRA) but urged more robust POC measures.  Uganda also 
referenced as significant the statement that President Bashir 
made in Yambio, Western Equatoria State, concerning the 
National Congress Party's willingness to respect the result 
of the referendum if the people voted for separation. 
 
Other Council Member Views

¶7.  Lebanon praised Bashir's Yambio statement and stressed 
that unity must be made attractive, welcoming the efforts of 
the Mbeki panel to deal with Sudan holistically.  Brazil, 
Japan, Turkey, Mexico, Austria, and Bosnia joined the broad 
Council consensus on the importance of POC, as well as 
providing a secure environment for both elections and the 
referenda, along with planning for the post-referenda period.

Le Roy Response 
--------------- 
 
¶8.  Le Roy reassured the Council that UNMIS' first priority 
would be POC, and that the mission was implementing a draft 
POC strategy now.  He said that the UN is in constant contact 
with the Mbeki panel, stressing that the Secretary General 
would attend the AU Summit with the goal of harmonizing UN 
and AU efforts.  Le Roy stated that pin-pointing the source 
of weapons flows into Sudan would be difficult but 
undoubtedly helpful.  He said that the next UNMIS report in 
April would take stock of the UN presence post-referenda, and 
that the Secretary General would name SRSG Qazi's successor 
within the next few days.
