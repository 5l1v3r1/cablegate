REF: STATE 54639 
 
¶1. (U) PolChief and PolOff delivered the Department's 
GAERC talking points to Finnish European Correspondent 
Leena-Kaisa Mikkola May 20. 
 
¶2. (SBU) IRAN: Mikkola acknowledged that the EU has 
still been unable to reach consensus on implementation 
of UNSCR 1803.  However, she noted that the EU did 
agree to broaden the list of entities and individuals 
covered by existing EU sanctions.  For its, part, the 
GoF supported a shared EU position on implementation 
of UNSCR 1803, as well a strong package of new EU 
measures to accompany it.  However, Mikkola reported, 
consensus was not reached either because certain 
member states chose to follow the UN track more 
closely (Sweden), while others may have business 
interests at stake (Italy).  Mikkola suggested that 
more and more countries are leaning toward eventual 
adoption of additional EU autonomous sanctions, and 
the issue could be reopened next month when France 
takes over the EU presidency. 
 
¶3. (SBU) LEBANON: Mikkola expects no "passionate 
difference of opinion" on Lebanon and therefore little 
discussion.  As an aside, she mentioned that serious 
conversations took place at last month's informal 
GYMNICH regarding how the EU should handle 
communication with Syria.  Some ministers argued in 
favor of consolidating all contact via High Rep 
Solana, while others wanted to maintain the option for 
bilateral contacts.  While the GYMNICH does not 
produce formal conclusions, Mikkola reported that 
there was general agreement around the idea that 
contacts could proceed on both EU and bilateral 
levels, provided the message to the Syrians remained 
consistent. 
 
¶4. (SBU) WESTERN BALKANS and GEORGIA: Mikkola does not 
expect the Western Balkans to be a major agenda item. 
However, should Solana's briefing indicate that the UN 
and the EU have made better progress in their 
negotiations regarding transition, that could lead to 
some discussion.  There will be conclusions on 
Georgia, but they will depend heavily on the election 
results.
