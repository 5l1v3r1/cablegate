SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ZDERA; HARARE 
 
 
¶1.   THE DECEMBER 10 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED 
   DAILY "THE HERALD" PRINTED THE FULL TEXT OF THE 
   ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA) OF 
   2001 AS PASSED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON 
   DECEMBER 4.  THE TEXT OF THE BILL WAS PUBLISHED 
   ACCURATELY AND FULLY.  THE "HERALD" ALSO PUBLISHED THE 
   HOUSE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT URGING 
   HOUSE APPROVAL OF THE BILL. 
 
¶2.   THE NEWSPAPER OFFERED THE FOLLOWING INTRODUCTION 
   TO THE BILL: "THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION 
   ABOUT THE ZDERA, WITH SOME SECTIONS OF THE MEDIA SAYING 
   THAT SMART SANCTIONS WOULD TARGET SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS 
   AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF ZIMBABWEANS 
   WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED.  CONTRARY TO THAT VIEW, THE BILL 
   SEEKS TO ECONOMICALLY STRANGLE ZIMBABWE AND ITS 
   CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY WITH ITS INTENDED INFLUENCE OVER 
   THE OPERATIONS OF THE IMF AND THE WORLD BANK."
