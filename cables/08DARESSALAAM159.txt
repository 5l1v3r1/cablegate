SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE:  TANZANIA PRESSING FOR INTERNATIONAL 
MONITORS TO BE IN PLACE WELL IN ADVANCE OF ELECTION DAY 
 
REF: STATE 018257 
 
¶1. (SBU) Honorable Bernard Membe, Tanzania's Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, assured 
Ambassador Green on February 27 that President Kikwete is 
working closely with President Mbeki of South Africa and 
within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) as 
well as with African Union (AU) states to ensure that 
international monitors be allowed into Zimbabwe well in 
advance of the presidential, legislative and local elections. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minister Membe understood that a SADC observer team 
was scheduled to arrive in Harare about three weeks before 
the March 29 elections.  However, he completely supported the 
need for AU, Commonwealth, the SADC Parliamentary Forum and 
other key international observer teams, including domestic 
civil society groups, to also be in place from the earliest 
possible date in order to monitor pre-election activities. 
Membe was clear that President Kikwete will continue to use 
all avenues to influence President Mugabe to agree that 
international election monitors be credentialed and allowed 
to enter Zimbabwe as quickly as possible.
