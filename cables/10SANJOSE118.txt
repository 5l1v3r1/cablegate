¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  Costa Rica is on the verge of concluding free 
trade agreements (FTAs) with the European Union (EU), China, and 
Singapore.  Combined with CAFTA-DR, these agreements will solidify 
the free trade legacy that President Arias, who completes his term 
of office on May 8, aimed to leave the country.  With three new 
FTAs expected to come online this year, the GOCR needs to 
streamline its process to avoid backlash from exporters and 
overburdening its own employees.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The EU has invited five Central American countries to sign 
an Association Agreement on May 18 in Madrid, at the EU-Latin 
America and Caribbean Summit.  While originally intended as a 
bloc-to-bloc agreement, Foreign Ministry Political Director 
Alejandro Solano told us January 7 that the EU is now prepared to 
sign with whichever Central American countries are willing.  He was 
confident that Honduras would be back at the table and intimated 
that Nicaragua would be the one left out if it continued its 
obstructionist tactics.  The EU's willingness to sign with 
individual countries is striking, since the Charge of the European 
Commission's mission in San Jose had emphasized in December that 
one of the most important aspects of this agreement for the EU was 
that it would be its first bloc-to-bloc agreement.  Also, earlier 
in 2009, the EU promised USD 34 million in development assistance 
to Costa Rica (in addition to assistance to the other Central 
American countries) in the areas of quality control, education, 
women-owned businesses, and community policing. (reftel A) 
Negotiations of this accord were suspended following the coup in 
Honduras in June 2009.  The parties plan two last negotiation 
rounds, in February and April.  Costa Rica is the principal Central 
American exporter to the EU, shipping bananas, pineapple, computer 
parts, coffee, juices, and ornamental plants to the 27-country 
bloc. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) Costa Rica and China expect to conclude negotiations of 
their FTA in a sixth round of talks in February.  (reftel B) 
Currently, the two countries have agreed on 90 percent of their 
products.  Negotiators for the two countries are aiming to present 
the agreement to the Costa Rican Legislative Assembly before 
President Arias leaves office.  Many Costa Ricans have been 
resistant to the FTA because of the questionable quality of Chinese 
products, exacerbated by the GOCR's limited capacity to monitor 
product safety.  Nonetheless, it appears that the GOCR has more in 
mind than just cheap goods.  Chief Negotiator for the Costa Ricans 
Fernando Ocampo said, "We are aiming for Chinese advanced 
technology companies that will contract qualified Costa Rican 
employees."  Costa Rica is still the only Central American country 
to have established official relations with China, and it hopes to 
expand from that foundation.  Ocampo continued, "To be in good with 
China is the best recommendation letter we have when looking for 
future relationships in Asia." 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) A case in point is Singapore.  Costa Rica and Singapore held 
their fourth and final round of negotiations in San Jose the week 
of January 11.  Singapore agreed to allow all Costa Rican 
agricultural products to enter the country under the free trade 
agreement, a first for Costa Rica.  Singapore granted immediate 
access to 100 percent of Costa Rican products, and Costa Rica 
granted immediate access for 90 percent of Singapore's products. 
The remaining 10 percent will phase in over the next five or ten 
years (depending on the product).  The two countries expect do a 
legal revision of the agreement in March and sign it in April. 
Free trade negotiations began with Singapore in April 2009. 
 
 
 
¶5. (U) The Costa Rican Chamber of Exporters (CADEXCO) has 
repeatedly complained about the "chaos" in the government's 
administration of free trade agreements.  Over 22 distinct 
government offices are involved in exporting under free trade 
agreements. CADEXCO stated that the lack of coordination among 
offices causes significant delay for exporters, not to mention 
occasional rejection of goods at the destination port due to 
incomplete paperwork. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: With three new FTAs expected to come online this 
 
 
year, the GOCR needs to streamline its process to avoid backlash 
from exporters and overburdening its own employees.  We hope that 
ongoing USAID-supported trade capacity building projects, 
particularly in customs, can help bootstrap the process.
