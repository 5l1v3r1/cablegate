Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Melbourne-based "Women for Peace" intends to hold a small 
vigil in front of the consulate building on January 9 to protest 
events in Gaza.  So far, protesters have organized four rallies 
elsewhere in Melbourne and Adelaide over the past ten days 
condemning Israeli airstrikes and ground attacks.  Pro-Israel 
supporters staged their own rally, calling for an end to "Hamas 
terror."  All protests have been peaceful so far and have generally 
refrained from targeting the United States.  Tasmania and the 
Northern Territory remain quiet.  Although Melbourne is home to more 
than 100,000 Muslims, the motivating force behind the anti-Israel 
rallies has been non-religious organizations.  End Summary.

¶2. (SBU) Victoria Police notified post on January 8 that the "Women 
for Peace: No Weapons, No War" organization plans to hold a 
seven-person vigil in front of the U.S. Consulate on January 9 from 
10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.  The vigil is intended to express concern for 
women and children who have been injured or killed in Gaza. 
According to their website, Women for Peace is a Melbourne-based 
women's organization formed in 2002 in response to the 9/11 
terrorist attacks and ensuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
They condemn all "war, acts of terrorism and manufacture of 
weapons."  The group has conducted several peaceful protests in 
front of the consulate building in the past.  Post will follow up in 
cable or email format if the January 9 vigil occurs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Approximately 1,000 people gathered in Melbourne's central 
business district on January 4 to protest Israeli airstrikes and 
ground incursion in Gaza, according to the Victoria Police.  While 
the protesters generally avoided expressing anti-U.S. sentiment, 
they dismantled a Star of David and burned it along with an Israeli 
flag.  Protesters called for a free Palestine and held posters 
depicting bloodied corpses of children.  A similar 500-person, non 
violent protest was held in Melbourne on December 28 accompanied by 
Hezbollah flags and condemnation of Israeli military action. 
According to Victoria Police, the Socialist Alternative, a 
university based spin-off of the International Socialist 
Organization, organized both Melbourne rallies. 
 
¶4. (U) Melbourne's Imams reportedly hosted the "biggest ever cry for 
Gaza" in the city's Broadmeadows suburb on January 4.  Protesters 
again criticized Israeli military action in Gaza while religious 
leaders made speeches and invoked prayers. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Pro-Israel protesters also staged a rally in front of 
Victoria's Parliament house with banners stating: "no more terror" 
and "Hamas uses human shields."  Speakers at the pro-Israel rally 
reportedly included the federal Parliament's only Jewish member, 
Michael Danby, and Liberal Party Senator from Victoria, Mitch 
Fifield.  An article in Melbourne's daily Age noted that Jewish 
organizations, schools and synagogues have been the target of 
abusive phone calls and letters since Israel commenced attacks in 
Gaza.  Jewish people have also reportedly been verbally abused on 
the streets.  (Note: There is no Israeli consulate in Melbourne. 
End note.)  According to Victoria Police, all gatherings in the 
state have been conducted peacefully with the full cooperation of 
law enforcement authorities. 
 
Adelaide and Elsewhere 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) On December 30, approximately 80 people gathered on the 
steps of the State Parliament building in Adelaide to protest 
Israel's military campaign in Gaza.  Police told post that they did 
not observe any anti-U.S. sentiment during the rally.  According to 
contacts in South Australia's police force, the protest was peaceful 
and organized by the "Australian Friends of Palestine."  The group 
defines itself as a "voluntary, not-for-profit organization which 
has as its primary object the promotion of peace in Palestine based 
on international law and relevant UN resolutions."  Law enforcement 
contacts in the Northern Territory and Tasmania report that there 
have been no significant anti-Israel rallies in those states.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Although Melbourne is home to more than 100,000 Muslims, 
the primary motivating force behind the anti-Israel protests have 
been non-religious organizations.  This is at least partially 
because Melbourne's Muslim community, similar to Sydney's, is 
heavily divided along ethnic lines.  Turks comprise the largest 
majority of Melbourne's Muslim community, accounting for more than 
70,000 residents.  Lebanese, Somali, Sudanese, Ethiopian, Eritrean, 
Baltic European, Iranian, Afghan, Pakistani and Iraqi Melbournians 
make up the remainder of the community.  While controversial issues 
such as the Benbrika terror trial (refs B and C) have temporarily 
united these disparate groups, Melbourne's Muslim communities remain 
divided and are primarily motivated by individual ethnic concerns.
