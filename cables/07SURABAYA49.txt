SUBJECT: INDONESIA AND BURMA: VIEWS FROM EAST JAVA 
 
REF: JAKARTA 2799 
 
¶1. Jakarta-based foreign policy watchers are not the only 
Indonesians closely monitoring events in Burma.  Since the 
crisis erupted, the Surabaya-based daily Jawa Pos has published 
front-page reports, with color pictures, covering events inside 
Burma and international reaction and providing commentary.  The 
Surya daily, associated with the Jakarta-based Kompass Group, 
has also carried factual reporting on events unfolding in Burma 
on its international pages.  Both papers covered demonstrations 
by local activists calling for stronger ASEAN action. 
 
¶2. Jawa Pos has been the most active, dispatching a team to 
cover the story from different angles and publishing these 
articles under the red headline "Myanmar Crisis."  Journalist 
Kardono Setyorakhmadi has filed a series of reports from the 
Burmese-Thai border based on interviews with refugees and 
anti-junta activists. As part of this series of articles, 
published on the front page October 5, Kardono related the story 
of two activists who told him about the brutality of the junta 
and described prison conditions in Burma .  The article was 
accompanied by a photo of a Burmese activist standing in front 
of photographs of people who had disappeared or been killed by 
the military junta. 
 
¶3. On October 8, Jawa Pos published an editorial entitled, 
"Failure as the Center of ASEAN," criticizing Indonesia for 
failing to play a prominent political role in ASEAN and accusing 
Jakarta of being weak against the Burmese military junta. 
Quoting an opposition activist who fled to Thailand, the 
editorial laments that "Indonesia was able to become a 
democratic country through peaceful reform, but has failed to 
build on this success in Myanmar."  The editorial states that, 
despite being a founding member of ASEAN and a member of the UN 
Security Council, Indonesia is weak and fails to play a 
leadership role in international fora regarding issues of peace 
and justice.  The editorial criticizes Indonesia as a member of 
the Security Council for only issuing a condemnation of Burma, 
rather than passing a sanctions resolution.
