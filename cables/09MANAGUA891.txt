Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b & d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On August 21, approximately three hundred 
union members from the Central Sandinista de Trabajadores 
(CST), the smaller of Nicaragua's two principal Sandinista 
party-affiliated labor confederations, protested in front of 
President Daniel Ortega's residence/headquarters.  They 
called on President Ortega to fulfill his campaign promises 
to improve workers' rights and to also "call off" a campaign 
by the Ministry of Labor (MITRAB) against their union.  The 
protest follows a heated public war of words between CST 
President Roberto Gonzalez and Gustavo Porras, the General 
Secretary of the larger Sandinista labor union Frente 
Nacional de Trabajadores (FNT) (see reftel A), and may show 
signs of growing divisions within the Sandinista ranks. END 
SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
CST LABOR PROTEST FROM MITRAB TO PRESIDENT'S HOME 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (C) On August 21, three hundred Central Sandinista de 
Trabajadores (CST) union members began a protest in front of 
the Ministry of Labor (MITRAB) to complain about MITRAB 
"persecution" of employers who have large CST unions.  CST 
workers allege that MITRAB inspectors were harassing their 
employers with excessive inspections and fines, while leaving 
alone employers with FNT workers because of the ongoing fight 
between CST leader Roberto Gonzalez and FNT leader Gustavo 
Porras.  (NOTE:  Porras is a Deputy for the FSLN party in the 
National Assembly, where he presides over the Health 
Commission.  He is also a key confidant of First Lady Rosario 
Murillo and holds a senior position in the national 
leadership of Murillo's Citizens Power Councils (CPCs).  END 
NOTE)  When CST workers learned that the Minister of Labor, 
Janneth Chavez, would not meet with them nor listen to their 
demands, they marched to the Sandinista National Liberation 
Front (FSLN) party headquarters, which is also the residence 
of President Daniel Ortega, and from the location which he 
governs the country as President. 
 
¶3. (C) Protesting CST union members remained outside the 
President's residence and FSLN party headquarters for at 
least two hours, chanting Sandinista slogans and dedicating a 
song to First Lady Rosario Murillo about "how sad the rains 
sounds under cardboard-roofed homes" of Nicaragua's workers. 
Three of the protesters were able to deliver a letter of 
complaint to Ortega's office, but none of the President's 
staff received them.  The leader of the protest, Pedro Ortega 
(no relation to the President), complained that President 
Ortega had not fulfilled his campaign promises for fair 
salaries, jobs and housing, despite already having been in 
office for more than half of his five-year term.  Protest 
leader Ortega expressed frustration that MITRAB was fighting 
against CST workers.  He also threatened that if President 
Ortega did not keep his promises "CST will take over the 
streets with at least five thousand workers."

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (C) The CST protests in front of both MITRAB and President 
Ortega's home are new developments in the growing conflict 
between the two largest Sandinista unions - FNT and CST.  The 
CST protest reveals a deepening sense of dissatisfaction 
among the ranks of the Sandinistas with the Ortega 
administration's failure to produce on its campaign promises 
to improve conditions for workers.  Moreover, the protests 
demonstrate the failure of behind the scenes negotiations to 
bring a resolution the politically embarrassing turf battle 
between the CST and FNT.
