¶1. (SBU) Summary: On February 8, the Ambassador met with 
Swedish relief effort experts from government, academia, and 
civil society to discuss coordination of assistance efforts 
in Haiti.  The Swedes are currently the sixth or seventh 
largest international donor to emergency relief efforts in 
Haiti (ref B, C, D, and E) and have sent police officers and 
prison officials as reinforcements (ref A).  The participants 
praised U.S. relief efforts in Haiti and underscored Swedish 
support for aid in Haiti in the near-future.  However, no 
long-term bilateral assistance from Sweden will be allocated, 
according to participants from the Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs and the Swedish International Development Cooperation 
Agency (SIDA).  End Summary. 
 
-------- 
U.S. MILITARY "POLITE AND WELL-DISCIPLINED"

¶2. (SBU) On February 8, Ambassador Matthew Barzun hosted 
Swedish relief experts for coffee at the residence to learn 
about Swedish perspectives on assistance efforts in Haiti. 
The Ambassador opened the discussion by asking participants 
to share their opinions of international aid efforts to Haiti 
in general and U.S. assistance in particular.  All of the 
participants praised U.S. efforts in general, and Swedish 
National Radio journalist Vladislav Savic, who recently 
returned from Haiti, told the group that without U.S. 
assistance at the airport, the entire relief mission would 
have been a disaster.  He added that he was impressed with 
the performance of the U.S. military, calling the soldiers he 
encountered "polite and well-disciplined" compared to the UN 
troops on the scene, many of whom he called "rude and 
impolite."

HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND LEGAL AID 
-------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Michael Lindval, Deputy Director, the Department for 
Security Policy, Humanitarian and Conflict Issues at the 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs, said that many European 
colleagues want to portray the Haiti relief effort as "poorly 
done," and needing "European management to be successful." 
According to Lindval, this is simply not true.  He commented 
that International Relief Director John Holms told him that 
the U.S.-UN cooperation was working well, and that he was 
afraid the U.S. would leave Haiti "earlier than it should." 
Lindval also noted that Haiti will need engagement from the 
international community for 10-20 years, but he said that 
Sweden did not have sufficient long-term interests in Haiti 
to provide such support. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Christian Ahlund, Director of International Legal 
Assistance Consortium (ILAC), an international legal aid 
consortium with 11 offices and over 100 employees in Haiti, 
emphasized the need to quickly rebuild the legal system.  He 
pointed out that the Ministry of Justice was "up and running 
again out of a container."  Ahlund also mentioned that USAID 
is interested in financing his organization's effort and 
called for SIDA to provide bridge funding until then. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Karin Rohlin, Regional Team Director for Latin 
America, SIDA, said that SIDA has no plans for any bilateral 
aid programs with Haiti because it was not identified as a 
priority country in SIDA's recent budgetary allocations. 
When pressed by the Ambassador, Rohlin said that SIDA was 
likely to provide bridge funding to ILAC, Ahlund's 
organization.  "We will try to include some reconstruction 
help in our humanitarian assistance," Rohlin said. 
 
-------- 
A CALL TO ACTION 
-------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mats Lundahl, Stockholm School of Economics 
Professor and Haiti expert, pointed out that Haiti has been 
struggling since 1864 to lift itself out of poverty, and that 
not much has happened.  The international community should 
not expect too much too soon, he opined.  With the right 
effort, he speculated, this disaster might actually be a 
turning point for Haiti if the international community and 
the Haitians themselves can focus on moving forward and 
eliminating the "corruption-rife" society that existed 
before.  "But sometimes history can be an obstacle to 
change," he pointed out. 
 
¶7. (SBU) James Foote, Program Coordinator and Advisor for 
Humanitarian Action, the Swedish Red Cross, ended the 
discussion by reminding participants that donors need to 
ensure that assistance reaches throughout the population and 
does not get disbursed through political "power games." 
Foote called for priority assistance to increase government 
capacity, new housing construction and post-operative care 
for the estimated 4,000 Haitian amputees.  He also encouraged 
the Haitian diaspora to return to their country to assist in 
the relief effort.  Foote said, "We need to stop flying 
people out and help them there."
