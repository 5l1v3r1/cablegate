REF: STATE 15722 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Deputy Head of 
the European Council's Human Rights' Unit and to European 
Commission officers on February 23.  Political Counselor also 
discussed with Spanish Perm Rep Middle East coordinator.  All 
noted that the Goldstone report had not been on the agenda of 
the February 22 Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) meeting and was 
not formally discussed.  There may have been informal 
discussions among ministers, according to the Spanish 
diplomat, but no formal position has yet been established. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Separately, EU Spanish Presidency representative 
told Poloff the EU was continuing to try to reach a common 
position on the resolution.  He agreed that it is 
counterproductive to convene a conference of High Contracting 
parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, as recommended in 
the Palestinian Observer Mission's draft resolution. 
However, he explained that the EU has not yet decided on a 
position regarding the Palestinian Observer Mission's draft 
resolution.
