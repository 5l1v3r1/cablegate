International Contact Group on Somalia 
Nairobi October 19, 2006 
 
The International Contact Group [footnote, see below] on Somalia 
(ICG) met in Nairobi on October 19 to support the advancement and 
expedite the implementation of the intra-Somalia dialogue under the 
auspices of the League of Arab States between the Transitional 
Federal Institutions (TFIs) as the legitimate national authorities 
in Somalia and the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC). The ICG called on 
the parties to convene at the earliest opportunity the Joint 
Committee inside Somalia as agreed at Khartoum II. 
 
The ICG strongly urged the two parties to attend at leadership level 
the third phase of the intra-Somalia dialogue in Khartoum on October 
¶30.  The ICG supported the idea of Co-Chairmanship of this dialogue 
by the League of the Arab States and Kenya as the chair of IGAD. 
 
The ICG expressed concern over the threats of militarization in 
Somalia and in particular violations of previous agreements reached 
in Khartoum that would undermine the dialogue. The Contact Group 
called on the UIC to refrain from any further expansion. The 
security framework to be agreed under Khartoum III should include 
operational provisions for military disengagement and 
demobilisation. 
 
The ICG recognized the need for an international mechanism to 
encourage adherence by the parties to their commitments, including 
monitoring and verification of the effective implementation of the 
outcome of the dialogue. IGAD, the League of Arab States and other 
members will play an active role in such a mechanism. 
 
The ICG committed itself to strengthen and harmonize further the 
international response to the situation in Somalia, ranging from 
humanitarian assistance, capacity building of the TFIs and local 
administrations, law and order, dealing with spoilers of the peace 
process and other security concerns in Somalia and the region. The 
ICG agreed on the need for the parties to ensure that Somalia is not 
used as a safe haven for terrorism, and develops good relations with 
its neighbours.  All parties must maintain mutual respect for 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. Following agreements reached 
in Khartoum, the ICG took note of the need to strengthen the 
security capacity to protect adequately the TFIs to fulfill their 
governance responsibilities. 
 
The ICG expressed its concern about humanitarian and recovery needs 
in all of Somalia, and the recent influx of refugees to Kenya and 
other neighbouring countries, and reaffirmed its commitment to 
respond to these needs. 
 
Footnote:  The October 19 meeting of the ICG convened jointly by 
Norway and Sweden and hosted by Kenya, included the European Union 
(Presidency and Commission), Italy, Norway, Sweden, Tanzania, the 
United Kingdom, the United States, and Kenya as IGAD Chair together 
with the United Nations, African Union, and League of Arab States.
