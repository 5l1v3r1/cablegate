SUBJECT:  COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR CODEL SENSENBRENNER 
 
REF(S): STATE 00228697 
 
¶1.  Post warmly welcomes CODEL Sensenbrenner and is pleased 
to grant country clearance for the period of January 10-12, 
2006 for the purpose of high-level discussions regarding 
visa policy in Lithuania. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador Mull will greet the CODEL on its arrival at 
the airport.  The Embassy's point of contact for your 
visit, Consul James Fellows, will also meet the CODEL at 
the airport.  Mr. Fellows' contact information is TEL: +370- 
5-266-5591; FAX: +370-5-266-5590; MOB: 370-6-872-4443; E- 
MAIL: FellowsJD@state.gov. 
 
¶3.  The American Embassy address is Akmenu 6.  The 24-hour 
Embassy telephone number is +370-5-2665500; fax number is 
+370-5-2665510.  All operators speak English. 
 
¶4.  Hotel reservations have been made, as requested reftel, 
for the nights of January 10-12 at Ramada hotel for 
business rooms at the rate of 126 USD per night.  The room 
rate includes all taxes and breakfast.  Cancellations can 
be made at any time without penalty.  The hotel is located 
at Subaciaus 2; tel: +370-5-264-6414; fax: +370-5-255-3311. 
 
¶5.  Your hotel, most restaurants and many stores accept 
credit cards.  However, it is a good idea to have some cash 
on hand since much of Lithuania still operates on a cash 
economy.  The Embassy cashier is available for check- 
cashing services from 0900 to 1300 Monday-Friday and there 
are automatic teller machines (ATMs) around the city. 
There is also an exchange service at the airport at 
commercial rates (comparable to those at the Embassy). 
 
¶6.  Lithuania is a relatively safe country with very little 
anti-American sentiment.  Vilnius has a low criminal threat 
level. However, visitors should take the same precautions 
that they would in any other large urban area.  Crimes of 
opportunity, such as pickpocketing, car break-ins, and 
theft, are most common.  Most crimes happen at night or in 
the early morning hours.  After dark, visitors should stay 
in pairs; exercise common sense; and avoid isolated areas. 
Visitors are encouraged to leave any valuables in their 
hotel safety deposit boxes.  Use of public transportation 
is not recommended.  Should you wish a security briefing 
upon arrival, please contact the RSO at tel: +370-5- 
¶2665621. 
 
¶7.  For additional information about Vilnius, you may wish 
to log on to www.inyourpocket.com and select Vilnius. 
 
¶8.  Visitors are advised to arrange taxi service through 
their hotel or the Embassy.  However, taxis that are parked 
in front of the airport are reliable.  Be aware of rogue 
taxi drivers who approach you offering their taxi service. 
Always inquire what the fare will be in advance.  The trip 
into town from the airport should cost around $5.00-$10.00 
(depending on exchange rate and day of the week). 
 
¶9.  Visas are not required if stay is less than 90 days. 
 
¶10.  The climate in Vilnius during the winter is dark, cold 
and wet with snow and ice.  Boots, jacket and gloves are 
necessary.
