  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  U.S. RETURN TO ASIA 
 
"China should pay a high degree of attention to the United States 
returning to Asia" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/24): "It is foreseeable that in the 
future China will be facing pressure from the United States in three 
areas.  The first is in economic competition.  At present, China is 
replacing Japan as the leader in Asia.  After returning to Asia, the 
United States' alliance with Japan and South Korea will be 
strengthened and this trend - China's emerging leadership role in 
the region - could change.  In the field of energy development, the 
United States, intentionally or unintentionally, might ignore 
China's pressure and continue to support Southeast Asian countries, 
working, for example, with the Vietnamese on oil exploration and 
exploitation.  The second is in regional territorial disputes.  In 
this regard, the United States may use its status as a "traditional 
ally" and "mediator" to contain China.  The third is over the Taiwan 
Straits issue.  It will be more convenient for the United States to 
intervene in the Taiwan Straits issue after returning to Asia." 
 
¶2.  NORTH KOREA 
 
"Hillary would like to use 'motherhood' to conquer North Korea" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated with the 
official Communist Youth League's China Youth Daily (07/24): "[In 
her recent comments,] Hillary has tried to play down the idea that 
'North Korea constitutes a threat to the United States.'  Hillary's 
comparison of North Korea to 'a willful child' immediately attracted 
media attention because it was the United States' first high-level 
response to North Korea since North Korea launched seven missiles on 
its Independence Day.  Hillary Clinton is trying not to make a fuss 
over tensions with North Korea, and is [instead] trying to pull 
North Korea back to the negotiating table through a variety of 
moves.  Indeed, after Obama took office, the foreign policy of the 
United States began to adjust from the unilateralism of Bush era 
toward a path of greater cooperation.  The keynote of Hillary's 
first trip to Asia this February was 'listening.'  It seems that the 
hegemony idea of the United States is beginning to change to one of 
'motherhood.'" 
 
¶3.  CHINA'S ENERGY SECURITY STRATEGY 
 
"China's energy security strategy: need to work on all fronts" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing) (07/24): "Xia Yishan, a researcher at 
the China Energy Strategy Research Center at the China Institute of 
International Studies, argued that China is facing tough energy 
challenges, the most severe one being supply of energy resources. 
It is necessary for China to provide 50% percent of its energy needs 
domestically.  China must seek oil supply from around the world 
since, in the future, up to 60% or 70% of China's oil needs will 
need to be met by foreign supply.  China should build a 
comprehensive and multi-level energy security system to ensure 
energy safety based on the following principles: first, 
participation in international competition and active implementation 
of an 'outward' strategy; second, better coordination of relations 
with neighboring countries and avoidance of political and military 
conflict; and third, trying to get involved in international oil 
pricing."
