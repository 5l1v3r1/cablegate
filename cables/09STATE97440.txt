CONTRIBUTION OF HELICOPTERS TO THE UN/AU MISSION IN DARFUR 
(UNAMID) 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 0126 
 
 ¶1.  Summary.  This is an action request.  Please see 
paragraph 7.  Department requests Embassy Moscow,s 
assistance in obtaining an offer from the Government of 
Russia (GOR) to provide to the UN/AU Mission in Darfur 
(UNAMID) up to 18 military medium transport utility 
helicopters (a minimum of 6 is preferred but any contribution 
would be welcomed) and operating crews for deployment to 
UNAMID at the earliest possible time.  The helicopters would 
be utilized for mission critical activities in Darfur, and 
permit UNAMID to improve operational capability in fulfilling 
its mandate.  End Summary. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  Embassy Moscow should pursue the following objectives: 
 
--Impress upon the Russian government there remains a 
critical need for 18 military medium utility helicopters and 
crews for deployment to UNAMID, without which the mission 
cannot meet its operational goals and objectives; 
 
--Persuade the Russian government to identify and donate to 
UNAMID UN-certifiable medium transport helicopters on a 
UN-reimbursable basis, or determine if there is any interest 
by the GOR in providing these assets; 
 
--Encourage officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry and 
Ministry of Defense as appropriate to initiate discussions as 
soon as possible with officials within the United Nations 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and Department 
of Field Support to commence negotiations leading to the 
deployment of the helicopters and operating crews. 
 
REPORTING DEADLINE 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  Embassy should report results of efforts by cable to 
Thomas Brown, IO/PSC, by September 30, 2009. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------------- 
 
¶4.  The ability of UNAMID to fulfill its mandate is dictated 
by the level of contributions of member states.  UNAMID must 
be capable of rapid mobility over vast distances and 
difficult terrain.  Since inception, UNAMID has 
unsuccessfully sought to acquire utility helicopters for the 
mission.  The concept of operations calls for 18 military 
medium transport helicopters to perform essential mission 
functions.  Despite the best efforts of DPKO and the 
international community, UNAMID has been unable to obtain the 
needed helicopters.  The operating conditions in Darfur are 
some of the harshest for UN peacekeepers with poor roads, 
poor airfields, and a brutal climate.  Air transportation, 
particularly during the rainy season when all ground movement 
is severely curtailed, is the only viable mode of 
transportation. 
 
¶5.  The concept of operations calls for each UNAMID sector to 
have one military helicopter operating 24 hours per day, 7 
days per week, principally to perform medical and casualty 
evacuation functions.  Given the operating conditions in 
Darfur for UNAMID troops, the large internally displaced 
population in camps, and fragile health, welfare, and 
security conditions, it is essential to have reliable medical 
transport capabilities.  The helicopters will also be used to 
enhance the safety and security of UNAMID troops, including 
troop transport and re-supply, to conduct patrols and search 
and rescue operations, and to investigate incidents of 
conflict within UNAMID,s area of operations. 
 
¶6.  In the past, the Russian Special Envoy for Sudan, Mikhail 
Margelov, has pledged his continued support for UNAMID (ref 
Khartoum 0126) in the matter of helicopters. 
 
¶7.  Action request.  Embassy Moscow is requested to approach 
the GOR at the highest appropriate level to obtain a GOR 
commitment to donate up to 18 military medium transport 
helicopters to UNAMID for service in Darfur.  If the GOR 
responds positively to this request, Department requests 
Embassy Moscow to obtain assurances that the helicopters the

GOR intends to offer to UNAMID are or will be UN-certifiable 
prior to or immediately after delivery to UNAMID.  If a firm 
commitment is not immediately forthcoming, please inform the 
Department whether or not the GOR is interested in exploring 
the option.  High-level engagement from the USG may be 
possible if it would move the GOR towards pledging the 
helicopters. Department requests the Defense Attach,s 
Office involvement in this effort.  Department appreciates 
Embassy Moscow,s assistance. End action request.
