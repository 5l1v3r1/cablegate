¶1. (U) Summary:  Arsenal Hunting Equipment representatives confirmed 
their company wanted to import reftel firearms under license 
¶050104476.  The company was established in 1994 under the name 
V.V.V. Ltd., and the three original owners still serve as the 
company President and Vice Presidents.  Arsenal Hunting Equipment 
sold about 100 such firearms last year, which company officials said 
could be used to hunt large game.  Post verified the bona fides of 
Arsenal Hunting Equipment and recommends it as a reliable end-user 
of United States Munitions List (USML) items.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) In a May 30 meeting, Arsenal Hunting Equipment General 
Director Valeriy Sevastiyanov and International Procurement Manager 
Irina Zazdravnykh told us Arsenal Hunting Equipment was established 
in 1994.  Its original name was V.V.V. Ltd., and the name was 
changed to Arsenal Hunting Equipment in December 2007.  The company 
has three owners:  company President Valeriy Startsov, Vice 
President Vladimir Cherivichniy, and Vice President Aleksandr 
Seleznov.  Sevastiyanov has served as the General Director since 
¶1997.  The Deputy General Director is Nikolai Sirdorkin. 
 
¶3. (U) Sevastiyanov provided us with copies of licensing documents 
that give Arsenal Hunting Equipment the right to import firearms. 
 
¶4. (U) Sevastiyanov told us the ultimate end users of these firearms 
will be private hunters.  He said Russian hunters use such firearms 
to hunt bear, elk, and bison.  He added that some hunters might use 
these firearms to hunt big game on safari in Africa. 
 
¶5. (U) Sevastiyanov told us that Arsenal Hunting Equipment used to 
import such firearms from Germany and Austria, but now wanted to 
purchase U.S.-made firearms.  In 2007, he said, Arsenal Hunting 
Equipment sold approximately 100 such firearms, while other 
companies in Moscow sold hundreds more. 
 
¶6. (U) Sevastiyanov told us they were familiar with the restrictions 
governing the import of USML commodities, and in particular the 
prohibition of unauthorized re-export.  Post confirms the bona fides 
of Arsenal Hunting Equipment as a reliable end-user of USML items.
