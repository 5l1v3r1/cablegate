REF: STATE 44261

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MICHELE J. SISON, REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).

¶1. (C) Ambassador met with MFA U/S Abdullah Rashid al-Noaimi
March 22 to inform him of the USG´s intent to designate
domestically al-Manar Television, the Lebanese Media Group,
and al-Nour Radio as Specially Designated Global Terrorists
under Executive Order 13224. Ambassador noted that the
designation will take place on or about March 23 and left
copies of the non-papers and E.O.

¶2. (C) Ambassador urged the UAEG to take measures similar to
the USG´s to block the funds and financial assets of the
media organizations that may be located in the UAE, and to
make public statements in support of this action and in
condemnation of Hizballah. Ambassador explained that the USG
is requesting the UAEG to remove al-Manar and al-Nour from
Arabsat highlighting. Ambassador noted that the USG was
approaching other Arab states as well (the percentage of
UAE´s participation in the paid capital of Arabsat is 4.66
percent).

¶3. (C) Al-Noaimi replied that he would need to pass this
information directly to Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin
Zayed al-Nahyan, who is currently in London. Al-Noaimi
related that Sheikh Abdullah is "very concerned" as Foreign
Minister, as are other Emiratis, that Hizballah represents
"more of a threat than al-Qaida or the Taliban." Hizballah
has "more dangerous ambitions" and is well-funded and
well-organized, he added. We will follow up with FM Sheikh
Abdullah bin Zayed, who held the Information Minister
portfolio from 1992 until February 2006 and who is familiar
with Arabsat, upon his return to Abu Dhabi.
