REFORM 
 
-------------------- 
Forum For The Future 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. On December 13, the lead editorial in the government-owned 
Arabic daily "Oman" was entitled "Reform from Within." 
 
"The Forum for the Future in Rabat concluded with several 
recommendations for reform in the Arab world.  Most of the 
recommendations fell within the framework of America's Greater 
Middle East initiative.  While the majority of Arab participants 
was amenable to the idea of reform and agreed that it is 
essential to their respective countries, there was an even 
greater sentiment expressed that reform initiatives should come 
from within the Arab world and not from outside.  During the 
Forum, Arab countries were asked to review many of their internal 
frameworks, policies, and infrastructures, especially those 
relating to the economy.  Oman participated in the "Forum for the 
Future" and at its conclusion Omani representatives expressed a 
desire to continue moving in the direction of development and 
modernization."

Iraq: A Wake Up Call For The Arab World 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. Privately-owned Arabic daily "Al-Watan" carried an editorial 
on December 11 entitled "Poor Iraq": 
 
"What is happening in Iraq is disturbing and should serve as a 
lesson to the Arab world.  It seems that all Arab nations are 
targeted for reasons unbeknownst to us.  What we do know is that 
the larger industrial world around us has no mercy or conscience. 
It is not concerned about the effects that its actions have on 
others.  The industrial world only protects its own interests and 
the interests of those closely allied to it. Industrialized 
countries will stop at nothing to remove any perceived obstacle. 
For example, whenever an Arab country tries to flex its muscles 
or appears likely to succeed in something, the industrialized 
countries (led by the United States) immediately deem it a threat 
and try to hold it back."

The UN: Organizational Reform 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. An editorial appeared in the government-owned Arabic daily 
"Oman" on December 11 entitled "Reform of the UN is a Necessity": 
 
"If only outside forces call for change in the UN, there will be 
no meaningful reform.  The only way to really reform this body is 
for member states to demand change.  The United Nations lost a 
great deal of credibility when it took a stand against the wars 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, and completely failed to do anything 
substantive to prevent them.  It is essential that the UN, 
starting with the Security Council, undergo reform.  For example, 
UN member countries like Germany, Japan, and Brazil should be 
included in the Security Council to add neutral voices to the 
Council's discussion of world issues.  UN agencies need more 
teeth so that they can become proactive and stop being powerless 
do-nothing bureaucracies."
