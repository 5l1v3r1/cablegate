SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - VENEZUELA: CHAVEZ'S REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE 
 
¶1. On January 12, Chile's conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El Mercurio" (circ. 129,000) carried an editorial entitled "Irreconcilable Positions." Quote: 
 
"The Governments of Venezuela and Bolivia have adopted similar 
political projects inspired in the Cuban model.  But while Caracas 
is getting closer to gaining full control of the institutions by 
dominating the Judiciary, Parliament, and the Electoral National 
Council, and presses against basic freedoms...the regime in La Paz 
is finding  a reality of greater institutionalism that makes Evo 
Morales' plans of political dominance difficult....  Bolivia seems 
to be heading towards a clear division in which positions are 
irreconcilable..." 
 
¶2. On January 11, conservative, afternoon "La Segunda" (circ. 33,000) carried an editorial entitled "Ortega: Between Chavez and Morales." Quote:
 
"The image of Daniel Ortega celebrating his assumption of power in 
Nicaragua, standing besides the Presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia, 
symbolizes the moment of success that Hugo Chavez' regional policy 
is experiencing after its failures in Mexico and Peru....  Some of 
(Ortega's) initial measures include his enthusiastic adherence to 
Chavez' Bolivarian alliance ALBA, designed as an alternative to the 
Washington promoted FTAA....  This is part of Chavez' fight against 
the United States and neoliberal economics....  The enormous 
availability of resources provided by Venezuela's oil wealth allows 
him to maintain for some time the financing of populist policies 
within and outside borders....  On the political front, the danger 
posed by his influence is that it could deteriorate the weakest 
Latin American democracies. 
 
"Chavez demonstrated that freedom of expression is incompatible with 
the Twenty First Century Socialism, as was clearly shown by his 
violent reaction to OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza's 
warning....  Although the Venezuelan President later described his 
own words as imprudent, he maintains his opinion.  Thus one could 
suppose that he is heading towards a collision with the OAS and 
Inter-American Democratic Charter...."
