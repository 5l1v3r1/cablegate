COUNTERTERRORISM CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 62142 
 
Â¶1. The GONL will participate in the OSCE Political 
Public-Private Partnership Conference focused on 
counterterrorism in Vienna from May 31 to June 1, 2007. 
However, the GONL has yet to decide at what level to send its 
delegation.  Either an official from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs or office of the National Counterterrorism 
Coordinator will head the delegation.  MFA OSCE Special 
Advisor Tony van der Togt discussed the conference with 
polmiloff on May 10; van der Togt confirmed that the Russian 
Embassy in The Hague had approached him separately on the 
same topic.
