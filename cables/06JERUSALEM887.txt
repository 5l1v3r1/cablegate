HE Mr. Jacob Walles 
Consul General of the United States 
Jerusalem 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
It gives me great pleasure to convey to your Excellency on 
behalf of the Palestinian Legislative Council and personally 
my best wishes. 
 
I also avail myself of this opportunity to express to your 
Excellency my conviction and sincere belief that the existing 
cooperation and close relations established by the former 
Council, will be further strengthened and will acquire new 
dimensions during my term of Office, to the benefit of our 
two Assemblies and Nations in the years ahead. 
 
Taking this opportunity, I would like to reaffirm that the 
solidarity existing between the United States and Palestine 
who share the same views for the preservation of freedom, 
justice, peace and Security in our region will continue to 
develop in the years to come. 
 
I would like to assure your Excellency that I will continue 
to observe closely and with pleasure and determination the 
developments in this respect. 
 
Please accept, your Excellency, my best wishes for your 
personal health and happiness and for the continued 
prosperity and success of the people of the United States.
