SUBJECT:  BAGHDAD REQUESTS PARTICIPATION IN IIP'S STRATEGIC SPEAKER 
INITIATIVE WITH WALTER RUSSELL MEAD 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Embassy Baghdad requests participation in the 
Speaker and Specialist Program by hosting Walter Russell Mead in 
early January.  Post would like to organize a program which utilizes 
Mead to engage Iraqis who are interested and engaged in 
international issues. Our audience will consist of important mission 
contacts, including some our strongest NGO and academic partners in 
Baghdad who have limited access to American intellectuals. End 
summary. 
 
PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
 
¶2. (U) Post proposes a three-day program, not counting travel days, 
featuring Walter Russell Mead engaging with a variety of local 
audiences. Day 1 will start with a meeting and lunch with the Iraqi 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and staff from both the Embassy and the 
Ministry. Following that, Mead will be the guest at a 
representational event at the Ambassador's Residence with a select 
group of Iraqi authors. On Day 2, Mead will present to a convening 
of the International Relations and Political Science Departments at 
the University of Baghdad. This will be followed in the afternoon by 
a discussion session with Baghdad-based NGOs that are focused on 
international issues, peace studies, and democracy-building. On Day 
3,   Mead will participate in a media engagement with selected Iraqi 
press in order to create opportunities for promoting a positive 
message regarding U.S. intentions in the Middle East.

PUBLIC DIPLOMACY THROUGH INTELLECTUAL DIALOGUE 
- 
¶3. (U) In order to continue to build better relationships with 
Iraqis from several facets of society, post is interested in 
creating a series of dialogue opportunities which will address 
regional multilateral cooperation and other imperative political 
issues. Post has attempted to bring Walter Russell Mead to Iraq two 
times previously but security considerations have prevented the 
implementation of the trip. Due to improvements in access and 
safety, coupled with the increased interest in Iraq-American 
relations because of the current security agreement negotiations, 
post believes it is time to engage Iraqis with high-level discussion 
on these matters with a well-regarded, non-Embassy source. 
 
- 
ITINERARY 
- 
¶4. (U) The proposed itinerary follows: 
 
-- Sunday, January 4: Mead arrives in Baghdad. 
 
-- Monday, January 5: Meeting with the Iraq Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and higher level staff from the Ministry and the U.S. 
Embassy followed by a representational event at the Ambassador's 
Residence with well-known Iraqi authors. 
 
-- Tuesday, January 6: Presentation to faculty and students at the 
University of Baghdad's International Relations and Political 
Science Departments followed by a separate discussion group session 
with several Baghdad-based NGOs. 
 
-- Wednesday, January 7: Media engagement with Iraqi press to talk 
about issues regarding international cooperation and geopolitical 
peace concerns. 
 
-- Thursday, January 8: Mead leaves Baghdad for next post.

POST SUPPORT 
- 
¶5. (U) Post is prepared to generate the audience, build partnerships 
with local co-hosting organizations, provide translation, lodging, 
meals, security, in-country transportation and address all technical 
aspects associated with this program.
