SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050189204 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050189204 for the export of 
International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled AH-1 
helicopter parts to Taiwan.  Post is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern inquiry within 30 days.  Lack of response 
to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future 
licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Unfamiliar consignee, Gao Jun Co. Ltd; 
commodities are parts sought by proscribed entities; no 
documentation from foreign end-user, Taiwan Land Force (TLF). 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post confirm that the 
TLF ordered the items listed for the purpose stated on the 
license application.  In addition, the Department requests 
that Post make inquiries with appropriate officials to 
establish the bona fides of Gao Jun in the transaction and 
conduct a site visit to assess the company's reliability as 
recipients of United States Munitions List (USML) articles as 
well as an assessment of the company's on-site security and 
operations.  If a site visit is not possible, please inform 
the PM/DTCC case officer. 
 
The following points are included for guidance: 
 
--Can Gao Jun provide documentation that verifies the end-use 
of the helicopter parts, such as a contract or purchase order? 
 
--When was Gao Jun established and who are its principals? 
 
--What is the nature of the company's businesses -- what type 
of items 
do they handle?  Does the company serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are they located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
