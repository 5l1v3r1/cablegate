SUBJECT: CANADA HOPES TO SEE POWERFUL LEADERSHIP AT GICNT 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 35549 
 
¶1. (SBU) Canada will attend the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) plenary conference in The Hague and 
is looking for "powerful leadership" from the 
Russian-Dutch-U.S. troika to "attack the problem of nuclear 
terrorism in a fulsome way," according to Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Director 
General for Global Partnerships Troy Lulashnyk.  Canada 
remains concerned that GICNT is not focused enough on action, 
Lulashnyk noted, and urged the troika to emphasize 
"execution" at the plenary.  He added that Canada believes a 
failure to increase the effectiveness of the Initiative risks 
dissipating the momentum generated by President Obama's 
recent focus on combating nuclear terrorism. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lulashnyk told Dutch Deputy Chief of Mission Erik 
Boer, Russian Embassy Political Counselor Dmitry Trofimov, 
and Deputy Pol/C on April 28 that Canadian senior officials 
have taken particular note of President Obama's recent 
speeches on the subject of nuclear terrorism, and were 
disappointed that the co-chairs did not incorporate a 
discussion of his ideas into the agenda.  Lulashnyk added 
that, as a result of President Obama's recent emphasis on 
nuclear terrorism, Canada intends to provide strong support 
the GICNT.  He added that Canadian inter-agency leaders will 
meet next week to decide whether to send someone senior to 
him to lead the delegation.  In years past, Lulashnyk has 
always led Canada's GICNT delegations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Canada will not seek a speaking role at the plenary, 
nor does it plan to host workshops over the next two years, 
according to Lulashnyk.  Instead, he noted that Canada will 
seek to "add value" to the presentations and workshops of 
others based on its expertise.  "We plan to pick a niche and 
participate," he observed.  DFAIT senior policy advisor David 
MacDuff added that Canada is also conducting activities to 
combat nuclear terrorism that "don't necessarily have the 
GICNT label."  He pointed to Canada's work in the 
Proliferation Security Initiative as well as bilateral 
U.S.-Canadian projects on border security as examples where 
Canada is combating potential nuclear terrorism outside the 
GICNT.
