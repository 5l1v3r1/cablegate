SUBJECT: AIT NOMINATION FOR THE SECRETARY'S AWARD FOR 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN OF COURAGE: CHENG YEN 
 
REF: STATE 99729 
 
 ¶1. (U)  AIT wishes to nominate Buddhist leader CHENG Yen for 
the Secretary's Award for International Women of Courage. 
Dharma Master Cheng Yen was born in Chingshui, a town in 
central Taiwan, in 1937.  In 1966, she established the Tzu 
Chi Foundation, which concentrates its activities in four 
areas:  charity, medicine, education, and culture.  Cheng 
Yen's Tzu Chi Foundation has grown into an international 
organization with over 5 million supporters and over 30,000 
members who carry out its mission globally.  Cheng Yen, 
herself, has been awarded the Eisenhower Medallion for her 
contributions to world peace and was nominated in 1996 for 
the Nobel Peace Prize for her tireless dedication to bringing 
a vision of compassion in action to areas suffering from 
disaster and conflict. 
 
¶2. (U)  On the basis of Cheng Yen's axiom, "Nothing is more 
valuable than life. All beings are equal," the Tzu Chi 
Foundation provides relief worldwide to victims of war, 
flood, and drought, sending supplies to victims and 
volunteers to help them rebuild their lives.  The Tzu Chi 
Foundation, which firmly believes in putting aid directly 
into the hands of those who need it, has provided more than 
USD 2 million in medical care, supplies, and financial 
support to victims of 9/11, more than USD 4 million in 
shopping cards, bedding, and medical care and supplies to 
victims of Hurricane Katrina, and, in cooperation with 
Knightsbridge International, a Christian NGO, distributed 
more than eight 40-foot containers filled with cooking oil, 
blankets, shoes, rice, and medicines to refugees in north and 
west Afghanistan.  In 2008, the Tzu Chi Foundation 
established long-term disaster relief efforts after the 
devastating earthquakes in the Szechuan province of China. 
The Foundation has built hospitals, colleges, and research 
centers as well as developed educational, social, and 
cultural programs for local communities.
