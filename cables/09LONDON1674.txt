¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Following SE Gration's June meetings with 
Abdul Wahid al Nour's Sudan Liberation Army/Movement (SLA/AW) 
commanders in Chad (ref A), SLA/AW field commanders and 
political officers plan to force Abdul Wahid into engagement 
in the Darfur peace process, London-based SLA/AW 
representative Yahia Ahmed Elbashir told Poloff July 21. 
Commenting that Abdul Wahid "is still the President but does 
not control things," Elbashir said the international 
community has an opportunity to help bring Abdul Wahid to the 
negotiating table by continuing to engage forward-leaning 
field commanders like SLA/AW Commander in Chad Terrada, 
Mohammed Mahmoud, and Souman al-Zain and political officers 
like himself.  They will plan to force Abdul Wahid to decide 
whether he wants to engage or to leave the movement, and 
Abdul Wahid "will never leave the movement."  Elbashir said 
the movement's field commanders and political officers 
continue to discuss amongst themselves to build a united 
position.  They will then force Abdul Wahid to begin 
engagement.  Moving on from there, Elbashir said SLA/AW plans 
to build consensus with SLA/Unity and other factions, 
including Abdul Shafi, Hamza al-Barrack, and Ahmed Diriage. 
Elbashir requested SE Gration visit London to continue USG 
engagement with forward-leaning SLA/AW elements, which would 
strengthen their case when discussing with Abdul Wahid 
because of his growing isolation from his own movement.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Yahia Ahmed Elbashir, London-based representative of 
Abdul Wahid al Nour's Sudan Liberation Army/Movement 
(SLA/AW), told Polff July 21 that following SE Gration's June 
meeting with SLA/AW field commanders in Chad, the movement is 
ready to force Abdul Wahid al Nour to re-consider his 
non-engagement (ref A).  With support from forward-leaning 
field commanders like SLA/AW Commander in Chad Terrada, 
Mohammed Mahmoud, and Souman al-Zain and political officers 
like himself, Elbashir said the international community could 
help force Abdul Wahid to a decision point through continued 
engagement with other senior SLA/AW representatives. 
Elbashir said field commanders are forming an administration 
committee to engage with the international community and 
force Abdul Wahid to a decision point by indicating that 
Abdul Wahid must participate in peace talks or leave the 
movement.  Elbashir assessed it would take continued pressure 
from the field commanders and the international community to 
change Abdul Wahid's mind.  Once Abdul Wahid realizes he no 
longer has the movement's support, Elbashir said, he will 
change his position because "there is no way he will leave 
the movement."  The field commanders also do not intend to 
break away to form a separate group. 
¶3. (SBU) Discussing next steps, Elbashir said the movement 
field commanders and political officers need to form a common 
position before approaching Abdul Wahid.  After Abdul Wahid 
is on board, Elbashir said the movement will begin discussing 
with other Fur groups to build a consensus position among 
SLA/Unity and others, including Abdul Shafi, Hamza 
al-Barrack, and Ahmed Diriage.  He said "all forms of 
engagement" would be possible, but noted that Doha "is a 
process and could have other venues beside Doha itself, 
including an African city like Addis Ababa or somewhere in 
Tanzania."  He affirmed that the movement would engage with 
the peace process, which could ultimately lead to a ceasefire. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Elbashir assessed it would be difficult to replace 
Abdul Wahid, as "that has been tried before and did not 
work," and the way forward would have to be bringing him in 
the fold.  He seemed confident that would happen with the 
support of the now engagement-oriented field commanders and 
the international community.  He requested SE Gration visit 
London to continue USG engagement with forward-leaning SLA/AW 
elements, which would strengthen their case when discussing 
with Abdul Wahid because of his growing isolation from his 
own movement.  (NOTE: At present, Elbashir cannot leave the 
UK because he does not have an immigration status that allows 
him to depart and then return to the UK.  END NOTE.)
