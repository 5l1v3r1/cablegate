SUBJECT: INFLATION RATE EXPECTED TO INCREASE 
 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) An IMF team visiting Sudan the week of February 26 
concluded that the inflation rate is likely to increase, 
perhaps to as high as 20 percent.  In a meeting with Econ 
officer, members of the IMF team stated that, while inflation 
one year ago was running at about 7 percent, it is now 
estimated at 16 percent and could well reach 20 percent.  The 
IMF attributed the increase in inflation to the government's 
expansionary budget. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The IMF team noted that strong inflows of foreign 
direct investment are fueling economic growth in Sudan. 
Foreign direct investment in 2006 was estimated to be USD 3.5 
billion and is projected to increase to USD 3.8 billion in 
¶2007. The largest single source of foreign investment is 
China, with substantial inflows from the Gulf as well.
