SUBJECT: CHINESE STILL SMOLDERING OVER FREIGHTER SINKING IN RUSSIAN 
FAR EAST 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In an introductory meeting with the new Chinese 
representative to Vladivostok, Lu Jingo told CG that the sinking 
of a freighter with Chinese crew by Russian Border Guards that 
resulted in the deaths of eight Chinese merchant sailors was an 
excessive use of Russian force.  Jingo would not comment on 
whether the incident has had an impact on overall 
Chinese-Russian relations, but he made it clear that he does not 
hold the Russian Border Guards in very high regard.  Jingo's 
most stinging comment came when the CG complimented Jingo on his 
assignment to Vladivostok.  The Chinese official said that he 
really did not want to be posted here, because he considers the 
Far East to be "dangerous" for Chinese people, even diplomats. 
 
SINKING OF THE NEW STAR 
----------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Jingo spent several days in Nakhodka following the 
February 15 sinking of the vessel "New Star."  He admitted that 
the New Star Captain was guilty of leaving port without all of 
the proper documents, but Russian Border Guards acted 
inappropriately in opening fire and sinking the ship.  The "New 
Star" was carrying a cargo of rice, which apparently was 
initially not being accepted by Russian importers due to 
"quality concerns."  The rice was eventually unloaded.  Russian 
Border Guards now claim the "New Star" was also involved in 
smuggling.  There are rumors that the Russian importers were 
intially refusing to accept the rice, although it was of 
acceptable quality, to collect insurance.  Whatever the details, 
the incident has cooled relations considerably.  Jingo dismissed 
the idea that Russia might compensate the families of the eight 
sailors who died in the waters off of Nakhodka when their life 
raft flipped and they died of exposure in the February ocean 
waters. 
 
POACHING "GOOD BUSINESS" 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Jingo did not comment when asked about the overall 
level of criminalization in the Far East and he seemed to view 
poaching as "good business," rather than an opportunity for 
cross border cooperation.  Jingo blamed Russians for the 
poaching of tigers and other endasngered animals in Russia for 
sale in China.  Regarding the March 6 murder of a Chinese 
entrepreneur in Vladivostok, Jingo said that incident was "a 
random crime."  He did say that he personally did not feel safe 
in Vladivostok due in part to the "racism" of Russians. 
 
CONSULATES GENERAL FOR VLADIVOSTOK AND HARBIN? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (SBU) Jingo said that Vladivostok remains attractive for 
Chinese businessmen with one Chinese business delegation a month 
coming to talk with Russian counterparts.  He added that 70 to 
80 percent of all tourists in Vladivostok are Chinese.  For his 
part, the consular section in Vladivostok issues about 200 
Chinese visas a day to Russian citizens. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Due to the increased business, the Chinese have offered 
to upgrade the consular section in Vladivostok, which reports to 
the Consulate General in Khabarovsk, to a proper Consulate 
General, with the Russians opening a CG in Harbin in Northern 
China.  The Chinese are waiting for Russia's answer on their 
diplomatic note.
