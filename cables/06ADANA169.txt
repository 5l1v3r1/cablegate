SAFAK/EVRENSEL/RADIKAL/BOLGE: Five soldiers were martyred when a 
military vehicle hit a PKK mine planted on a road in Bitlis the 
previous day, and seven soldiers and one village guard were 
killed during the clashes between GOT forces and PKK militants 
in Eruh of Siirt yesterday. As a result of the increase in death 
toll of GOT forces in the clashes, the Anti-terror High 
Commission convened in Ankara urgently and discussed the 
measures to be undertaken. Prime Minister Erdogan gave the 
following message to PKK: "We have run out of our patience. You 
will pay the cost heavily," and asked people in southeastern 
Turkey to possess their state. During the meeting of the 
Anti-terror High Commission presided by Foreign Affairs Minister 
Gul the following topics were discussed: Possibilities for a 
cross-border operation, an air raid at PKK's safe-heaven at 
Kandil Mountain in Northern Iraq, application of stringent 
security measures at Habur Border gate, sending diplomatic 
demarches to Iraq and the United States, calling for an urgent 
tripartite (Iraq-USA-Turkey) meeting, and renewing of "Hot 
Pursuit Agreement" between Turkey and Iraq. Based on data given 
by HPG -People's Protection Forces- Ulkede Ozgur Gundem 
newspaper reported that Turkish forces had launched 66 
operations and Iran had realized 10 operations in various parts 
of the region, and that guerillas had retaliated 58 times. 5 
officers, 2 village guards, 2 policemen, 102 soldiers, and 32 
Iranian soldiers had been killed while 24 HPG guerillas lost 
their lives in the ensuing clashes, the paper reported.
