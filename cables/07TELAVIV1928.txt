¶1.  (SBU) COGAT confirmed to EconOff on June 25 that despite 
the main border crossings with Gaza remaining closed, the GOI 
continues to facilitate passage of individuals through Erez 
Crossing Point on a special humanitarian basis.  It is also 
allowing the import of humanitarian goods, food, and fuel 
through the Kerem Shalom, Sufa, and Nahal Oz crossing points. 
 Maj. Peter Lerner, Head of International Relations at Erez 
Crossing Point, told EconOff that since June 19 the GOI has 
channeled a steady stream of food and aid from international 
donors -- including food and soap from the Jordanian King and 
dialysis equipment from USAID -- through Kerem Shalom.

COMPOSITION OF HUMANITARIAN GOODS 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COGAT contacts reported that 20 truckloads of food 
(cooking oil, eggs, sugar, and dairy products) and one 
truckload of medicine were brought into Gaza through the 
Kerem Shalom Crossing on June 24.  In addition, approximately 
70 truckloads of animal feed (totaling 537 tons) and straw 
(totaling 581 tons) were brought in via the Sufa crossing 
point. 
 
The following humanitarian goods are scheduled to be imported 
into Gaza on June 25: 
 
Via Erez: 
 
-- one truckload of medicine from UNRWA; 
-- one truckload of medicine from UNICEF; 
 
Via Sufa: 
 
-- one truckload of medical supplies from the ICRC; 
-- one truckload of dialysis equipment from USAID; 
-- 11 truckloads of food from the World Food Programme. 
 
------------------ 
KARNI STILL CLOSED 
------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As for the Karni (Al-Mintar) Cargo Terminal, Oded 
Herman, Ministry of Defense Advisor to Pol-Mil Director Amos 
Gilad, advised EconOff on June 25 that the crossing point 
remained closed.  He noted that although the crossing point 
had sustained damage on the Palestinian side, the GOI still 
did not have a Palestinian counterpart at Karni with whom to 
coordinate the passage of commercial goods, and asserted that 
since dealing with Hamas was not an option, the lack of a 
Palestinian partner -- not the damage -- was the real reason 
Karni would remain closed for the foreseeable future.
