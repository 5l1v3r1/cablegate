¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) USUN met, at the request of its counterparts, with 
the UK, French, Belgian Missions to the UN on March 7 to 
discuss designating a second batch of FDLR names from the 
list of 19 names that the Rwandans had submitted in May 2008 
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sanctions Committee 
pursuant to UNSCR 1533. The Europeans expressed appreciation 
for U.S. action to move forward on the first batch of four 
names on March 4 (Ref A), but conveyed that they are ready to 
move on a second batch as soon as possible. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In August 2008, the Department instructed USUN to 
share the list of names in three tiers for action with the 
Europeans (Ref B). In October 2008, USUN worked with these 
European missions to compile tentative Statements of Case 
(SOC) for a list of 5 names for the second tier of 
designations (Ref C). USUN forwarded the list of 5 SOCs to 
Washington in October (Ref D).  The UK, France and Belgium 
seek to work off this list. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The European missions support moving forward on 
these names: 
 
a.    Iyamuremye, Gaston (aka - Byilingiro, Victor; Rumli, or 
Rumuri) - (France is willing to designate, UK/US open to 
designation provided receipt of more information, Belgium 
open to designation and proposed another alias as "le Belge") 
b.    Hakizimana, Apollinaire (US was willing to accept with 
more information and wondered if this was the same as 
Hakizimana, Bonaventure) 
c.    Ruzindana, Emmanuel (France would accept, UK/US open to 
designation provided receipt of more information, Belgium 
wanted to check name against another name for FDLR 
commissioner for mobilization) 
d.    Mugaragu, Leodomir 
e.    Ngilinshuti (or Njilinshuti), Juma (France is willing 
to designate, UK open to designation provided receipt of more 
information, Belgium is open to designation) 
 
¶5. (SBU) The French, UK and Belgian missions have proposed 
meeting sometime during the week of March 16 to determine 
next steps in the FDLR submissions (Ref E). USUN requests 
guidance on how to proceed with the next batch of FDLR names, 
specifically these five names and next steps, including a 
possible timeline, on gathering the necessary information to 
allow their timely designation.
