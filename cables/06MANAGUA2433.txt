SUBJECT: ADDITIONAL ALN PROPOSALS ON ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL 
JUSTICE, AND SECURITY 
 
REF: MANAGUA 2329 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The ALN's final policy proposals concerning 
the environment, social justice, and security build on the 
earlier plans regarding employment and energy efficiency 
(reftel).  ALN presidential candidate Eduardo Montealegre 
presented his complete plan of government during an October 
27 press conference.  Montealegre publicly invited FSLN 
candidate Daniel Ortega to a policy debate at the same time, 
but Ortega did not respond.  The proposals are primarily 
directed towards middle and working class households, women, 
and youth -- groups Montealegre must win over to succeed on 
November 5.  End Summary. 
 
Environmental Protection

¶2. (U) On the subject of environmental protection, the ALN 
promises to increase the land area in the national parks and 
reserves system and promote reforestation.  The ALN would 
also continue to clean and protect Lake Managua and Lake 
Nicaragua, as well as explore ways to reduce environmental 
pollution from industry and transportation.  The party would 
encourage and assist people living in protected areas to 
convert from farming and ranching to ecotourism as a source 
of income. 
 
Social Justice and Development of Opportunities

¶3. (U) The ALN lumped several proposals under its "social 
justice" initiative in the areas of education, culture, 
health, water and sanitation, and housing.  To improve 
education, the ALN would promote better qualifications for 
teachers, provide periodic training, and pay higher salaries. 
 The party also promises to reorient education around 
"practical" and technical training and support sports camps. 
To help poor children, the ALN pledges to provide free 
lunches and subsidized transportation.  The party would also 
support adult literacy programs. 
 
¶4. (U) To promote cultural advancement, the ALN promises to 
support artistic projects and exhibitions, as well as 
preserve historical works and cultural traditions. 
 
¶5. (U) To improve Nicaragua's medical infrastructure, the ALN 
would remodel major hospitals and construct additional health 
clinics in under-served communities, while guaranteeing a 
basic level of health care for everyone.  The party promises 
to promote prevention programs to reduce the need for 
emergency medical services and improve overall health. 
 
¶6. (U) The ALN promises to rehabilitate water distribution 
infrastructure and expand access to potable water. 
 
¶7. (U) To relieve Nicaragua's housing shortage, the ALN would 
explore ways to house all families in the country by, in 
part, expanding access to financing for individuals and 
businesses seeking to construct residential housing for 
middle and lower class residents. 
 
Citizen Security 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶8. (U) The ALN proposal to improve citizen security focuses 
on the need to establish an emergency call line and integrate 
all emergency responders into a national network.  The ALN 
would modernize the police and fire services by providing 
better training and equipment and higher salaries.  The party 
promises to improve border security, especially regarding 
drug trafficking on the coasts.  The ALN would also promote 
after school activities to prevent young people from joining 
gangs and establish a program to reintegrate gang members 
into society. 
 
Comment 
- - - - 
 
¶9. (SBU) The additional proposals build on a plan of government already strongly oriented to middle and working class citizens, which also incorporates the business community into social programs, usually by offering tax and financial incentives. The ALN's new plans also reach out to important constituencies that Montealegre has previously pledged to support, such as teachers and police. The ALN plan of government is coherent, though the party frequently does not explain in detail how a Montealegre administration would pay for and execute many of the proposals. Further, the ALN did not release the final plan until October 27, little more than a week prior to the elections.
