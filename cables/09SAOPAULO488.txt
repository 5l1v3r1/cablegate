Title- As a mediator, Brazil tries to attenuate Unasul 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (8-11) states: 
"....At the Unasul meeting Brazil transformed what seemed to be, 
once more, a direct alignment with Bolivarian counterparts, in a 
charitable role of peace maker and mediator.....Aid and cooperation 
between all countries affected by the corruptive and deleterious 
effect of drug trafficking should be deepened and improved. 
Brazilian diplomacy should not have doubts about this and should be 
sharper with those who seem not to see a problem in drug 
trafficking, like Chavez...." 
 
Title- All on Obama's shoulders 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (8-11) by Eliane Catanhede says: 
"All the anger and attacks that would be [normally] targeted at 
Colombia and Alvaro Uribe ended up converging on demands against the 
U.S. and President Barack Obama....that's what happened at the 
Unasul - Union of South American Nations - meeting yesterday in 
Quito, Ecuador....Chavez started a line of complaints against 
Washington saying one or two things in favor of Uribe.....Unasul was 
created to integrate, but what we see is really the opposite:  few 
times in the modern age South America has been so split as it is 
now."
