¶1. (U) Twenty-three-year-old Amin Mohamed Durrani pled guilty to 
participating in the "Toronto 18" terror plots and was sentenced to 
7.5 years in prison on January 20, two days after the group's 
ringleader was sentenced to life in prison.  However, with double 
credit for time served in pretrial detention, Durrani will be 
released after spending only one more day in prison.  Durrani 
admitted to participating in several training camps organized for 
the "Toronto 18" group. 
 
¶2. (U) Durrani's sentence follows the pattern of other members of 
the "Toronto 18" who have been convicted and sentenced (see para 
three).  The comparatively light sentences combined with double 
credit for time in pre-trial detention are frustrating Canadian law 
enforcement officials, and Crown prosecutors are already appealing 
the sentencing of Saad Khalid. 
 
¶3. (U) Since the initial arrests of 18 Toronto-area men in 2006 for 
a plot to carry out terrorist attacks in Southern Ontario to 
protest Canada's military presence in Afghanistan, the following 
have been convicted: 
 
a) Nishanthan Yogakrishnan, 21, was convicted in September 2008 and 
sentenced to 30 months on May 22.  Given credit for time-served, he 
has already been released; 
 
 
 
b) Ali Mohamed Dirie, 26, pled guilty on September 21 to 
participating in the activities of a terrorist group; he received a 
seven-year sentence and will receive double credit for time in 
pretrial detention; 
 
 
 
c) Saad Khalid, 23, was sentenced to 14 years in prison on 
September 4 and will receive double credit for time in pretrial 
detention; 
 
 
 
d) Saad Gaya, 21, pled guilty on September 28 and was sentenced to 
12 years; 
 
 
 
e) Zakaria Amara, 23, pled guilty on October 8 and was sentenced on 
January 18 to life in prison; 
 
 
 
f) Amin Mohamed Durrani, 23, pled guilty on January 20 and was 
sentenced to 7.5 years in prison. 
 
 
 
Of the remaining members of the "Toronto 18" terror plot arrested 
in 2006, one man's trial began last week and four others face trial 
in March.  They cannot be identified due to an ongoing publication 
ban.  Charges against the other seven members were either stayed or 
dismissed.
