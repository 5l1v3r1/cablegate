Begin Text: 
 
In early 2000 the Zaporizhskiy Titanium-Magnesium Combine (ZTMC) was 
restructured, and a separate semi-conductor plant was established 
with access to the key assets for silicon production. 
 
According to management of the enterprise, the material mentioned in 
your letter, namely silicon metal covered by subheadings 2804.69.10 
and 2804.69.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS), was not produced at the Zaporizhskiy 
Titanium-Magnesium Combine. 
 
Until 1997 the ZTMC produced silicon metal of semi-conductor quality 
(more than 99.99% silicon by weight).  To date this production has 
not resumed.
