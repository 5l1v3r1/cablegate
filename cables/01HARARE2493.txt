¶1.   THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" DEDICATED ITS 
    AUGUST 23 EDITORIAL TO THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD CONFERENCE 
    ON RACISM TO BE HELD IN DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA, ON AUGUST 31. 
    UNDER HEADLINE "POLITICAL POSTURING THREATENS RACISM 
    TALKS," THE PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   "SO WHAT IF THE SUBJECT OF ZIONISM BEING EQUATED WITH 
    RACISM IS TABLED AT THE U. N. CONFERENCE ON RACISM IN 
    DURBAN ON 31 AUGUST?  WOULD THAT BE EQUATED, BY THE 
    UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, AT LEAST, WITH GRANTING ON A 
    SILVER PLATTER A PSYCHOLOGICAL VICTORY FOR YASSER 
    ARAFAT'S FATAH MOVEMENT AND THE HIZBOLLAH GUERRILLA 
    GROUP OVER ARIEL SHARON AND SHIMON PERES?  THERE WILL 
    CLEARLY BE LIVELY AND, ADMITTEDLY, EMOTIONAL DEBATE 
    OVER RACISM. . .  WHAT IS VITAL IS THAT THE SUBJECT BE 
    VENTILATED CALMLY AND THOROUGHLY. . .  THE U. S. 
    GOVERNMENT MUST, THEREFORE, CONCENTRATE ON THE BIG 
    PICTURE.  RACISM IN THE U. S. ITSELF DID NOT DISAPPEAR 
    WITH THE END OF SLAVERY.  FROM FREDERICK DOUGLASS TO 
    MARTIN LUTHER KING JNR., THE DESCENDANTS OF AFRICAN 
    SLAVES HAVE FOUGHT TO GAIN EQUAL STATUS WITH THEIR 
    FORMER MASTERS.  THE LIKES OF THURGOOD MARSHALL PROVED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02493  231002Z 
    THAT BEING THE DESCENDANT OF AFRICAN SLAVES WAS NO 
    BARRIER TO REACHING THE PINNACLE OF SUCCESS IN ANY 
    FIELD OF HUMAN ENDEAVOR. . .  THE U. N. CONFERENCE ON 
    RACISM MUST SUCCEED AND THE THREAT OF A BOYCOTT BY THE 
    ¶U. S. OVER ZIONISM BEING EQUATED WITH RACISM MUST BE 
    ELIMINATED BY OFFICIALS IN GEORGE W. BUSH'S 
    ADMINISTRATION WHO KNOW THAT IF THE THREAT IS CARRIED 
    OUT, THEN THEIR COUNTRY COULD LOSE THE RESPECT OF MANY 
    FRIENDS."
