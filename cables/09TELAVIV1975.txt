REF: (A) STATE 82753 (B) Tel AVIV 1837 
 
¶1. (SBU) ESTH officer met with MFA Magreb Director Eynat 
Shlein-Michael on September 3 to follow up at her request on the 
BMENA demarche presented August 18 (ref A).  She underscored that 
Israel remains quite interested in BMENA progress, and she 
personally believed it was one of the Bush administration's best 
initiatives.  Shlein-Michael is the MFA point person on BMENA, and 
offered a more detailed response than offered ref B. She followed 
BMENA progress closely during her recent three-year posting in 
Washington. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The chief reaction of the GOI is that Israel would like to 
be included in BMENA as a regular participant and invitee.  The GOI 
understood that, at the start of the Initiative, there was logic in 
not including Israel so as not to politicize the forum into an 
anti-Israel opportunity, or discourage the Arab states from joining 
it.  Shlein-Michael believes the BMENA process is now sufficiently 
entrenched and partner countries sufficiently engaged with it to 
tolerate Israeli participation.  Israel is a regional country with 
an interest in BMENA's progress.  Israel brings to BMENA expertise 
in development technologies, civil society and democracy building, 
and women's rights.  Israel sees itself as a donor/contributor to 
the process.  She pointed out also that Israel has worked with 
developing states in the Arabic-speaking world for 60 years through 
its Mashav program (Israel's development cooperation agency). 
Israel's presence in other IOs and forums has not made them less 
effective, and the workshops planned for BMENA members this autumn 
are the sort to which Israel could bring good value-added.  Finally, 
she noted that including Israel in BMENA is the type of positive 
engagement that President Obama spoke of in his Cairo address; 
keeping Israel out of a regional forum where productive relations 
are fostered would be inconsistent with his stated, broader 
objectives in the Middle East, such as normalizing Israel's 
relations with its neighbors. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Emboff promised to convey Israel's interest to Washington 
BMENA organizers, and reiterated USG commitment to keep Israel 
apprised of BMENA developments.
