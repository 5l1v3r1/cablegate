RIO GROUP 
 
STATEMENT ON A FULL CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN LEBANON 
 
The Members of the Permanent Mechanism of Consultation and Political 
Coordination - the Rio Group - welcome the unanimous adoption by the 
United Nations Security Council of Resolution 1701 (2006) which 
calls for a full cessation of hostilities by Israel and Hezbollah 
and the coming into effect of the agreement as called for by the 
Resolution A/HRC/S-2/L.1, adopted by the Human Rights Council, 
condemning the violation of human Rights against the Lebanese 
civilian population. 
 
The cessation of hostilities which brought an end to the senseless 
loss of life must be respected strictly by the parties in order to 
allow for the urgent implementation of measures to alleviate the 
suffering of the civilian population, especially children. The Rio 
Group therefore calls upon all parties to faithfully comply with the 
mandate of Security Council Resolution 1701 and to desist from 
committing actions that jeopardize the fledgling truce. The Rio 
Group urges the parties to do their utmost to ensure that this 
cessation of hostilities is transformed into a durable ceasefire 
allowing for the peaceful pursuit of political solution to the 
issues. 
 
The Rio Group supports the full exercise of sovereignty by the 
Government of Lebanon within the territory of Lebanon. The 
strengthened and expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon 
(UNIFIL) must be urgently and fully deployed to fulfill its renewed 
mandate. The Rio Group therefore calls upon countries in a position 
to do so to help reinforce UNIFIL and urges the international 
community to be generous in their humanitarian support and in 
contributions to assist in the process of rebuilding Lebanon. 
 
The Rio Group is convinced that peace and stability ultimately rest 
on the achievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement 
of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all it aspects. Therefore, the 
international community should strengthen the efforts to create 
conditions for the resumption of the peace process in the region on 
all tracts. 
 
The Rio Group stands ready to support all efforts aimed at the 
promotion of a real and lasting solution of this situation in 
keeping with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
