SUBJECT: UN Launches 2009 Consolidated Appeal for the West Bank and 
Gaza 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: The UN launched the 2009 Consolidated Appeal (CAP) 
for the West Bank and Gaza on November 26.  The USD 462 million 
appeal focuses on humanitarian response and assistance to an 
increasing number of vulnerable Palestinians in the West Bank and 
Gaza.  Most of the appeal is for food, cash assistance and emergency 
job creation.  The CAP identifies vulnerable Palestinian groups, 
particularly those affected by the separation barrier, those in Area 
C, and women, children, and the elderly.  For the first time in its 
seven years, the CAP also includes protection activities to prevent 
ongoing displacement.  End Summary. 
 
CAP LAUNCHED 
------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) At the November 26 launch of the 2009 UN Consolidated 
Appeal (CAP) for the West Bank and Gaza, UN Resident Humanitarian 
Coordinator Max Gaylard highlighted Palestinians' rising needs and 
declining standards of living, which have led to the UN appeal for 
$462 million to support relief and recovery programs.  He deplored 
humanitarian conditions in Gaza, saying, "the blockade is an assault 
on human dignity."  Gaylard noted that the CAP was developed in 
consultation with the PA, NGOs, INGOs, and UN agencies over two 
months.  Over half the CAP is for UNRWA to provide emergency food, 
cash, job, and health programs to over 1 million refugees in West 
Bank/Gaza.  This year's CAP, he said, also includes protection 
activities to prevent displacement in vulnerable communities; e.g., 
in Area C and near the separation barrier.  Gaylard said the CAP, 
which is humanitarian assistance, will support and feed into the 
PA's development-oriented PRDP. 
 
Challenges to Humanitarian Operations 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) UNRWA Deputy Commissioner General Filippo Grandi described 
the operational challenges to delivering humanitarian and 
development aid; increased movement restrictions; increasd needs; 
and decreasing levels of funding.  Rather than focusing on human 
development, the UN and other NGOs must provide emergency 
humanitarian relief, he said.  Grandi stressed that UNRWA will be 
unable to deliver even basic services if current restrictions 
persist and funds continue to be scarce.  (Note: UNRWA anticipates a 
budget shortfall in 2009 of roughly $160 million.  End Note.) 
During the 5 months of the "tahdiyya" (ceasefire) in Gaza, UNRWA, 
WFP, and other aid agencies could not replenish food stocks or 
otherwise prepare for an emergency.  Grandi urged the international 
community to prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian 
conditions and to allow aid agencies to move freely. 
 
CAP Details 
----------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The USD 462 million CAP includes 159 projects (96 for 
NGOs, 63 for UN agencies).  Two-thirds of the budget is for relief 
and cash assistance.  The CAP will respond to reduced standards of 
living, increased food insecurity, threatened agricultural 
livelihood, displacement, and deterioration of public services.  The 
CAP's strategic objectives are to 1) provide humanitarian assistance 
to most vulnerable communities; 2) improve protection of civilians; 
3) enhance monitoring and reporting on the humanitarian situation 
and; 4) strengthen coordination.  The main sectors are: food and 
food security ($209.5 million), cash for work and cash assistance 
($133.3 million), protection ($33 million), agriculture ($25.1 
million), and health ($18.7 million).  Gaylard concluded that 
immediate political intervention and financial support is needed to 
halt the decline in standards of living and to create a permissive 
environment for humanitarian agencies to implement relief and 
recovery programs.
