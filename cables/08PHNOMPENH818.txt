Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Europe 
Department Director Kao Samreth October 6.  While not 
disclosing specifically whether the Royal Kingdom of Cambodia 
will support or oppose the Serbian resolution, Kao stressed 
that Cambodia does not wish to encourage secession in any 
country and therefore does not support the independence of 
Kosovo. (Ref B.)  Kao drew parallels to independence claims 
for South Ossetia and stated that Cambodia would not 
encourage tension within a country by supporting independence 
claims.
