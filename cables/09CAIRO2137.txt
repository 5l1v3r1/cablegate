RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS 
 
REF: A. STATE 116270 B. CAIRO 2044 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor Donald A. Blome for reason 1.4 (b).
1.(C) On November 16, we delivered ref A points to MFA Deputy Assistant Minister for Human Rights Wael Aboulmagd, requesting Egyptian support for the upcoming UNGA country-specific human rights resolutions on Iran, Burma and the DPRK. We stressed that the Iran resolution is the USG's top priority, and asked for the GOE to oppose expected "no action" votes on the Iran and Burma resolutions, and to support all three substantive resolutions. We also requested that the GOE abstain or be absent from the votes if it cannot oppose the "no action" votes or support the resolutions.

2.(C) Aboulmagd responded that Egypt would continue its principled opposition to country specific resolutions in the UN General Assembly (UNGA). He said that Egypt does not believe the UNGA should single out particular countries for condemnation. Aboulmagd noted that Egypt continues to favor the Universal Periodic Review as the appropriate instrument to consider specific countries' human rights records. Scobey
