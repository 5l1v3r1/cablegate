SUBJECT: TURKEY/IRAQ:  MFA STATEMENT ON IRAQ POLITICAL 
DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
The Turkish Foreign Ministry issued the following statement 
April 23 in response to recent political developments in 
Iraq.  Informal Embassy translation follows. 
 
Begin Text: 
 
We welcome the election of a President and Speaker of 
Parliament, and the designation of a new Prime Minister to 
form a government in Iraq, thereby overcoming the blockage 
concerning who would form the new government following the 
December 15, 2005 elections in Iraq.  We hope that these 
designations, which show that the political transition 
process has entered its next phase, will be for the good of 
our neighbors the people of Iraq. 
 
There are serious problems in need of solution confronting 
the new government and parliament in Iraq.  We hope a broadly 
based government of national consensus, which can handle 
these problems with full capability and which can establish 
the security and stability needed in the country, will be 
quickly established. 
 
With this understanding, Turkey will continue to provide the 
strong support it has been giving to the political process 
since the beginning.  We assess that an Iraq which preserves 
its political unity and territorial integrity, and which is 
in peace with its neighbors, is an indispensable element for 
the stability of the region. 
 
As we have done to the present, we will stay close to the 
friendly and brotherly Iraqi people and we will continue our 
cooperation with the Iraqi administration.
