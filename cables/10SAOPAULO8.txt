Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (1-7) by Eliane Catanhede notes: 
".....a U.S. or French representative - I'm not disclosing who - 
used a provocation similar to one used by French Minister Herve 
Morin against the [Swedish] Gripen NG: 'Does Brazil prefer a 
Mercedes or a Beetle?'  The answer seems obvious but is not.  A 
rich and 'bellicose' country that invades Pakistan and Afghanistan 
with no timidity certainly [in an allusion to the U.S.] prefers the 
Mercedes.  But in Brazil, good-natured and with a tight budget, it 
is an expensive and nonsensical luxury.  Maybe it would be more 
adequate, as the FAB (Brazilian Air Force) is saying, to have a 
Beetle: a smaller plane, lighter, for half the price, with lower 
maintenance costs and an ability to perform well in a possible 
attack....the plane would also provide technology more directly, 
with ramifications for private companies and good opportunities for 
business .....the price factor is not an irrelevant one.  The Lula 
Administration ends in one year but the debt will remain......for 
30 years.....And who is going to pay?  FAB, which concluded the 
last generation Beetle is good enough for a country like Brazil."
