SUBJECT: TURKEY'S NEW SPEAKER: PLEASE, NO ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
RESOLUTION, AND ARTICLE 301 NEEDS AMENDMENT 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  During Ambassador's October 4 courtesy call, Koksal 
Toptan, the new speaker of Turkey's parliament, stressed his 
commitment to US-Turkey ties.  Turkey was working well with 
the US on Iraq, including through the Neighbors process, and 
was strongly committed to Iraq's territorial and political 
unity.  A divided Iraq would only lead to greater instability 
and increase Iran's influence in the region.  Toptan 
expressed appreciation for continued strong US support for 
Turkey's EU accession process, cooperation on energy issues, 
and joint efforts to interdict trafficking in persons, drugs 
and weapons. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Toptan's concerns mirrored those of other Turks:  US 
failure to take visible action against the PKK was hard to 
understand, especially as the US was so active in the global 
war on terror.  His focus, though, was on possible passage of 
a congressional Armenian genocide resolution (AGR).  Toptan 
recognized and expressed appreciation for ongoing USG efforts 
to prevent AGR passage, but hoped the Administration would do 
even more.  To that end, a Turkish parliamentary delegation 
was headed to Washington this weekend.  He had also written 
to Speaker Pelosi, urging against passage and inviting her to 
visit Turkey.  Toptan highlighted Turkish sensitivities on 
this topic, stressed that Turkey wants improved relations 
with Armenia, which could be set back years, and lamented the 
effect passage would have on US-Turkish relations. 
Ambassador asked for Toptan's help in continuing to move our 
relations forward, even if an AGR passes; we have many 
comment strategic interests in the region, he stressed, that 
cannot be put on hold. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador also raised domestic reforms.  The US 
would continue to support Turkey's EU accession.  Parliament 
has a full agenda.  International interest is high, however, 
in freedom of expression-related reforms, such as amending or 
eliminating the controversial Article 301 of the Penal Code. 
This would be good for Turkey, good for Turkey's EU accession 
process, and be seen positively in the US as well.  Toptan 
indicated that there was, in fact, a problem with Article 
¶301.  It had been consulted with EU experts and a number of 
European countries had similar provisions.  The problem in 
Turkey was primarily how prosecutors implement the law.  The 
GOT recognized this and would, he believed, move soon to 
resolve the implementation problem. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Toptan, the former chair of parliament's Justice 
Committee, responded positively to the Ambassador's pitch 
that parliament prioritize passage of the implementing 
legislation for the Hague Convention on International Child 
Abductions.  Toptan acknowledged that he had had a keen 
interest in it as Committee chair, and pledged to continue to 
do his best to ensure early passage.
