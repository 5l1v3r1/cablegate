¶1.  (SBU) Embassy delivered reftel demarche by diplomatic 
note to Morocco's Foreign Ministry on January 8.  EconCouns 
followed up in person on February 4 with Director of Air 
Transport Hamid Zhar of the Ministry of Equipment and 
Transportation, the senior Moroccan official responsible for 
aviation policy.  In response, Zhar stated that the 
Government of Morocco was aware of the Statement of Policy 
Pricniples and was in the process of considering whether to 
join in endorsing it.  However, Zhar sought clarification of 
several points: 
 
-- What are the rules under current U.S. law regarding 
foreign ownership of U.S. airlines? 
-- Does the U.S.-EU Open Skies Agreement permit any higher 
percentage of foreign ownership? 
-- What is the next step beyond the signing of the 
Declaration?  Does the U.S. administration envisage proposing 
a new law to allow for increased foreign ownership of U.S. 
airlines? 
-- Is there a distinction to be drawn between the signing of 
the Declaration by the U.S. and its partner countries, and 
its subsequent "approval" or "endorsement" by the European 
Commission?  In other words, he asked, does an "approval" 
carry the same weight as a signature? 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT: While Zhar's demeanor was friendly and 
engaging, his questions left some doubt as to whether the 
government of Morocco was likely to join in endorsing the 
Statement. Zhar added in an aside that Morocco had 
significantly liberalized its air transport policy by signing 
Open Skies agreements with the U.S., the EU and certian Arab 
countries, and was now in a period of reflection and 
consolidation.  In particular, he noted that the national 
carrier Royal Air Maroc was experiencing some difficulty in 
competing with low-cost European-based budget carriers for 
the charter and tourist markets, which undercut support for 
further liberalization of its aviation policy.
