     ¶B. PETERSEN-SABATINI E-MAIL 9/21/2008 
 
¶1.  (SBU) REF A requested Embassy assistance in conducting a 
post-shipment check on license 05-050104085 for export of a 
U.S.-origin piezoresistive accelerometer (Endevco Model 
7270A-200K) to the Fraunhofer Ernst-Mach-Institute (EMI) in 
Freiburg, Germany.  The reason for this end-use check is that 
this article represents a sensitive commodity with potential 
for diversion.  EMI's stated application for this article is 
to measure the acceleration of shock plates under blast 
loading in a large shock tube.  Post was asked to confirm 
from EMI receipt of the Endevco Model 7270A-200K 
accelerometer and make inquiries about the intended use of 
the commodity.  Post contacted the director of EMI, Dr. Klaus 
Thoma, multiple times, but did not receive satisfactory 
responses to any of the questions posed in REF A. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Thoma expressed irritation with our inquiries and 
appeared to see them as an unnecessary intrusion, given that 
the commodity had already been delivered to EMI.  His 
responses were vague and he did not respond positively to 
follow up questions despite every effort by post to deliver 
the inquiries in a considerate and professional manner. 
Thoma explained that EMI has 30 years of experience working 
with the USG and that EMI receives Endevco accelerometers in 
the 7270A family on a continuous basis.  His primary concern 
was that he does not want his technicians burdened with 
having to send reports describing how they intend to use 
Endevco accelerometers and he insinuated that EMI may be 
inclined to seek alternate suppliers if the procurement 
process from Endevco becomes too cumbersome. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In response to the REF A specific questions, on 
September 18, Thoma did acknowledge that EMI did receive the 
7270A-200K "a couple days ago," but he did not supply any 
accompanying supporting documentation to confirm the 
commodity was received.  Thoma declined to describe any 
specific testing EMI had planned for the 7270A-200K or why 
this commodity was chosen (as opposed to other sensors in the 
7270A family.)  Thoma only said EMI uses extreme range 
accelerometers for uses including measuring hypervelocity 
impacts, which he says are some of the most extreme 
collisions measured on Earth.  Thoma also said that EMI 
selects these sensors from an Endevco catalog without 
consultations with Endevco applications engineers.  Regarding 
re-export concerns, Thoma said "I guarantee that EMI uses 
Endevco sensors only in our labs and we do not re-export 
them."
