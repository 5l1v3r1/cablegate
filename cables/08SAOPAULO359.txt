SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: G8 
 
Climate for Negotiation 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (7/7) says: "The G8 meeting 
that begins in Japan today has a chance of advancing the second most 
important topic on the agenda: global warming.... The five emerging 
countries invited [to the meeting] have been showing signs that 
suggest an end to the deadlock on an agreement to curb global 
warming.... The international negotiation for a post-Kyoto 
agreement...has been paralyzed by disputes between emerging 
countries...and the U.S., which demands they adopt reduction 
goals.... President Lula...acknowledged for the first time that the 
G5 and other less developed nations could make a commitment against 
global warming.... One day later, China said it is open to 
discussing mid-term and long-term goals.... If India follows suit, 
the U.S. will be even more isolated in its obstructionism, a 
position that should soften after the November presidential 
election.
