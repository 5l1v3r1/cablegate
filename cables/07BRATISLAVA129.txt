REF: BRATISLAVA 58 
 
¶1. The Slovak Cabinet approved a decision to transfer a 
maximum of 65 Slovak combat-engineers from Kabul to the 
airport in Kandahar on February 28. The decision came in 
response to a request made by NATO last Fall. Slovak soldiers 
will be sent to Kandahar with the caveat that they not leave 
the airfield. At the moment Slovakia has 57 soldiers in 
Afghanistan, only 40 of whom are combat engineers. It is not 
clear if extra forces will be added ahead of the transfer to 
Kandahar, which DefMin Kasicky said would be realized before 
the end of the first half of this year. Contacts at MoD have 
told us this decision does not require Parliamentary approval. 
 
¶2. President Gasparovic welcomed the Cabinet's decision and 
called it a proper step. Through his spokesperson, Gasparovic 
said he supports the decision because "we are members of 
NATO, and from this flow certain responsibilities." 
Gasparovic believes the decision shows that Slovakia is a 
responsible and respectable partner that wants to fulfill its 
commitments.
