¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "WHERE IS THE PATRIOTISM OF THE 
    ZANU PF LEADERSHIP?" THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY 
    NEWS" DEDICATED ITS FEBRUARY 6 EDITORIAL TO A WARNING 
    THAT THE CHILDREN OF GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND 
    OFFICIALS STUDYING ABROAD COULD, BE AFFECTED BY 
    ASPECTS OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC 
    RECOVERY BILL.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   "IN PRINCIPLE, ANY SUGGESTION THAT PUNISHMENT 
    PRESCRIBED FOR THE SINS COMMITTED BY A PARENT SHOULD 
    BE VISITED ON THE CHILD SHOULD BE MORALLY REPUGNANT. 
    THE PUNITIVE MEASURES ENVISAGED IN THE ZIMBABWE 
    DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY (ACT)(ZDERA) RECENTLY 
    PASSED BY THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
    (SIC) AS PART OF THE SANCTIONS TARGETING TOP 
    ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, WILL UNFORTUNATELY 
    AFFECT THEIR CHILDREN.  A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT 
    MINISTERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING CHILDREN WHO 
    ARE ATTENDING EITHER SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS, 
    WHOSE WELFARE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE AFFECTED IN NO SMALL 
    MEASURE BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SMART SANCTIONS 
    AGAINST THE TARGETED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. 
 
¶3.   ".IN ANY CASE, IF OUR FORMER COLONIAL MASTERS 
    ARE AS TERRIBLE AS PRESIDENT MUGABE WOULD HAVE VOTERS 
    BELIEVE, THEN ALL HIS LIEUTENANTS MUST SURELY SING 
    FROM THE SAME HYMN SHEET.  IT IS PARTICULARLY CHEEKY 
    THAT WHILE THEY SEND THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO FINE 
    SCHOOLS, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN LONDON, SYDNEY, 
    NEW YORK AND ELSEWHERE, THEY REDUCE THE CHILDREN OF 
    ZIMBABWE'S LONG-SUFFERING TAXPAYERS TO THE STATUS OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED
