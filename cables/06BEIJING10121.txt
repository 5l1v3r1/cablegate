¶1.  (U)  Economic Minister-Counselor and Energy Attache 
presented ref A points to National Development and Reform 
Commission (NDRC) Energy Bureau Deputy Director General XU 
Yongsheng on May 25. 
 
China's Five-Party Energy Ministerial Proposal 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  DDG Xu thanked Washington agencies for their 
support for the proposed ministerial and recommendations for 
ministerial agenda items.  He asked what time of year would 
be best to maximize the chances that Energy Secretary Bodman 
could attend this ministerial, noting how much China wishes 
him to participate in the event.  EconMinCouns replied that 
the Embassy has little knowledge of the Secretary's schedule 
nor authority to make commitments about the Secretary's 
schedule.  He recommended that the NDRC should first present 
intended invitee nations with a meeting agenda, including 
those topics covered in ref A para 2 as well as suggested 
dates for the ministerial.  The Embassy would then relay the 
detailed agenda and proposed meeting times to Washington for 
consideration and response.  DDG Xu took note of the 
EconMinCouns' reply. 
 
Iran and Alternate LNG Supplies 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  DDG Xu said he would promptly relay the ref A U.S. 
points to his leaders for consideration and an early response 
to the Embassy.  (Note:  Embassy did provide to DDG Xu the 
U.S. company contact name and Hong Kong telephone number that 
appeared in ref A para 3 talking points, reiterating that the 
USG is in no position to make a commitment on behalf of any 
private U.S. company.  End note.) 
 
Oil and Gas Forum 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  DDG Xu said the points were quite clear on this 
matter. 
 
Energy Policy Dialogue 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  DDG Xu asked which USG officials would participate 
in the EPD, now postponed to September.  EconMinCouns 
reminded Xu of the information about USDEL leadership that 
was in the May 5, 2006 letter from DOE's Office of Policy and 
International Affairs to NDRC Energy Bureau Director General 
XU Dingming.  Xu checked the letter and remarked that the 
information was very clear. 
 
GNEP Delegation Visit 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The talking points on this topic in ref A having 
been transmitted to the Embassy after the start of the GNEP 
delegation's visit, Embassy Energy Attache instead took the 
opportunity to express the GNEP delegation's thanks to the 
NDRC's Energy Bureau and Foreign Affairs Department for their 
efforts in making this week's visit successful.  The U.S. 
GNEP delegation had been honored that NDRC Vice Chairman 
Zhang Guobao had opened this week's meetings, showing the 
topic is important to China just as it is to the United 
States.  Energy Bureau DG Xu Dingming's luncheon or the U.S. 
visitors had been much appreciated, too.  Discussions between 
the two delegations had been good, site visits arranged by 
NDRC had been informative, and one could hope for continuing 
exchanges in this important area soon. 
 
¶7.  (U)  DDG Xu thanked Emboffs for the detailed information 
on each of the above topics.  He reiterated that he would 
 
BEIJING 00010121  002 OF 002 
 
 
quickly report the U.S. points to his leaders and that NDRC 
would prepare further responses to the Embassy as soon as 
possible.
