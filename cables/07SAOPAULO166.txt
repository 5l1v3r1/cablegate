SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: During his February 6-7, 2007 visit to Sao Paulo, 
Under Secretary for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns and his 
delegation were hosted for lunch by Sao Paulo Governor Jose Serra 
and key members of Serra's cabinet.  U/S Burns and the Governor 
discussed cooperation on biofuels, public security challenges and 
possible U.S. assistance, and trade and investment issues, including 
the importance of curbing IPR piracy.  On the key theme of biofuels, 
U/S Burns proposed that the U.S. and Brazil develop a strategic 
partnership to work with third countries on creating a global market 
for ethanol.  Governor Serra outlined public security challenges 
facing the state of Sao Paulo, and proposed USG assistance at the 
state level in key areas.  U/S Burns and A/S Shannon raised regional 
foreign policy issues, noting that while state governors like Serra 
have no direct role, their states are affected by Brazil's global 
posture and regional approach.  U/S Burns encouraged Serra to visit 
the U.S. in the near future.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) On February 6, Sao Paulo Governor Jose Serra hosted a lunch 
for Under Secretary Burns and his delegation.

¶3.  (U) Serra, 65, is a former Minister of Health who ran 
unsuccessfully for President in 2002 and again for his party's 
presidential nomination in 2006.  He is widely expected to make yet 
another try in 2010.  He served two terms as a Federal Deputy and 
one as a Senator.  He has also been Sao Paulo Secretary of Economy 
and Planning, national Minister of Planning, and Mayor of Sao Paulo 
(2005-6).  A leader of the National Students' Union (UNE) in the 
1960s, he spent fourteen years in exile in France, Chile, and the 
United States during the 1964-85 military dictatorship.  He earned a 
PhD in Economics at Cornell and taught at Princeton. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) After the initial pleasantries and words of welcome, 
 
SAO PAULO 00000166  002 OF 004 
 
 
Governor Serra's first remark was that Sao Paulo state is Brazil's 
largest producer of sugarcane and ethanol, and that many here are 
concerned that the U.S. ethanol market is protected (a reference to 
the 54-cent per gallon surcharge/tariff on ethanol imports). 
Economic issues of this nature are an extremely important aspect of 
Latin America's relationship with the United States, Serra 
commented. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) U/S Burns began by outlining the agenda for his visit, 
noting that he planned to meet in Brasilia with senior GoB officials 
with a view to strengthening bilateral relations.  While the 
relationship is good, he stressed that it could be larger and that 
the two countries could do much more together than they are 
currently doing.  The USG is engaging with the GoB at the highest 
level, he continued, noting that Attorney General Gonzales is 
visiting Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro this week.  POTUS is expected 
to meet in the near future with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 
 
 
¶6.  (U) U/S Burns described the energy roundtable he participated in 
earlier that morning and said he was impressed with what Brazil has 
done with biofuels.  He proposed that the U.S. and Brazil become 
strategic partners in creating a global market for ethanol, reaching 
out to third countries. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Ambassador Sobel described U/S Burns' responsibility for 
overseeing funding for USG assistance to other countries to combat 
transnational crime.  He recalled Governor Serra's recent remark 
(ref B) that Sao Paulo state has adequate funding but needs U.S 
equipment, technology, and expertise to improve its security 
capabilities.  U/S Burns commented that diplomacy has changed in 
recent years; the critical areas are now counter-narcotics, 
anti-terrorism, border and port security, and combating trafficking 
in persons and HIV/AIDS, to name a few.  He outlined the role of INL 
in providing assistance and how it works in other countries, most 
notably Colombia, and suggested that A/S Patterson visit Sao Paulo. 
Like Brazil, he said, the United States has border concerns.  The 
Ambassador cited research showing that Sao Paulo's international 
airport in Guarulhos has the highest incidence of false documents in 
the world. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) DCM explained that NAS security assistance is funneled 
through the National Public Security Service (SENASP) in Brasilia 
but that funds trickle down to the states slowly, and noted that 
Embassy is working on a plan to amend the NAS MOU with the GoB to 
make it possible to provide assistance directly to states. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The Governor recalled that Ronaldo Marzagao, state 
Secretary for Public Security, had served as national anti-drug 
 
SIPDIS 
director in the late 1980s under the Sarney administration.  The 
U.S. Ambassador at the time advised Marzagao that drugs were "not 
just a gringo problem," but rather one that would impact on Brazil - 
and he has been proven right. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Sao Paulo state has about 130,000 police (civil and 
military), Governor Serra continued.  Its prison population of about 
150,000 represents more than half of all prisoners in Brazil. 
Organized criminal gangs, especially the First Capital Command 
(PCC), have enormous influence in the state prison system.  The 
state needs technical assistance to combat these problems.  Serra 
reiterated his priorities as fighting drug and arms trafficking and 
 
SAO PAULO 00000166  003 OF 004 
 
 
contraband and piracy as well as organized crime.  The state needs 
the technology to tap telephones.  Security in the metropolitan 
area's subways and commuter trains is also a growing concern 
(reftels).  Foreign Affairs Advisor Helena Gasparian elaborated on 
this problem and noted that the recent DHS/TSA visit and assessment 
had been immensely helpful to state transit authorities.  Under 
Secretary Burns commented that the USG works increasingly at state 
 
SIPDIS 
and local levels in other countries, citing examples in India.  He 
and Ambassador Sobel stressed the importance of getting the GoB's 
approval for such cooperation; the Ambassador observed that 
Itamaraty (MFA) is sometimes sensitive about such matters.  The 
state government may need to help convince the federal government of 
the value of having the U.S. work directly with the state.  Serra 
indicated he would also be willing to talk to the media about the 
need for such assistance. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Secretary Marzagao (Public Security) described in more 
detail some areas of bilateral cooperation the state would like to 
pursue with the U.S.  These include counter-narcotics and anti-money 
laundering initiatives, exchanges of information, prison 
administration and prison reform, and assistance with police 
intelligence.  He outlined problems the state has not only with 
organized crime but also with common street crime, and described 
efforts to coordinate and integrate the state's law enforcement 
agencies and to improve federal-state police coordination as well. 
CG McMullen cited recent meetings between law enforcement officials 
of the four southeastern states - Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, 
Espirito Santo, and Sao Paulo - to discuss information-sharing and 
coordination on state borders.  This, he said, is the sort of 
regional initiative that the USG would like to work with.  The 
Ambassador noted that a new law enforcement position had been 
established in the Embassy to coordinate NAS cooperation with cities 
and states. 
 
¶12.  (SBU) U/S Burns turned briefly to Brazil's foreign policy, 
noting that while state governors like Serra have no direct role, 
their states are affected by Brazil's global posture and approach to 
the region.  A/S Shannon described the USG approach to Bolivia.  The 
U.S. continues to try to work with the Morales administration on 
coca eradication and interdicting cocaine paste, but we remain 
concerned that President Morales is permitting an increase in the 
level of legal coca production, negotiating village by village. 
There could be explosion in the amount of coca leaf produced in the 
next eighteen months.  This would be extremely problematic for 
Brazil, and we have so advised the GoB.  Brazil is involved in 
alternative development efforts in Bolivia, and biofuels technology 
is one area of possible cooperation, but would require considerably 
more political groundwork to get Morales to agree.  The U.S is 
working to maintain good relations with Morales but cannot guarantee 
that these efforts will not collapse.  Governor Serra noted that a 
great deal of cocaine from Bolivia ends up in Brazil and that Brazil 
needs to do its part in the area of counter-narcotics. 
 
¶13.  (SBU) While the U.S. has enjoyed good success cooperating with 
Europe on counter-terrorism initiatives, U/S Burns observed, it has 
done less well in improving prison administration and fighting 
organized crime.  The U.S. and Brazil have much to learn from each 
other.  The U.S. can promise to approach Brazil's and Sao Paulo's 
problems with humility and to give a one hundred percent effort, but 
cannot guarantee success. 
 
 
SAO PAULO 00000166  004 OF 004 
 
 
¶14. (SBU) Returning to the area of biofuels, the Governor, U/S 
Burns, and the Ambassador discussed California's biofuels initiative 
and the possibility of a visit to Sao Paulo by Governor 
Schwarzenegger.  Governor Serra noted that the U.S. is spending 
public and private funds on ethanol research.  He advised that Sao 
Paulo, using both private and state funding, expects within about 
two years to complete a pipeline that will carry ethanol from the 
interior, where it is produced, to port.   U/S Burns cautioned that 
Congress is unlikely to change the surcharge on imported ethanol. 
He stressed the importance of developing alternative fuels because 
the U.S. dependence on oil, which is exported by countries with 
problematic governments (e.g., Iran and Venezuela), has a negative 
impact on foreign policy. 
 
¶15.  (SBU) As lunch grew to a close, U.S Burns again highlighted the 
common ground shared by Brazil and the United States and suggested 
that Serra visit the U.S. soon.  Ambassador Sobel noted that Sao 
Paulo is home to the world's largest American Chamber of Commerce 
outside the United States and thanked the Governor for his recent 
action to ward off legal action that would have taken away state tax 
credits from electronic technology producers, seriously compromising 
the interests of a number of large U.S. investors in the state.  The 
Governor expressed his intention to seek a long-term solution to the 
"tax wars" between the states that sometimes prejudice investors.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶16. (SBU) Governor Serra is clearly interested in developing closer 
ties between his state of 40 million and the United States.  His 
administration, which took office just over a month ago, faces 
serious challenges in the area of security.  Mission Brazil will 
continue to engage with Serra to identify target of opportunity 
where we can work together.  End Comment. 
 
¶17. (U) This cable was coordinated with Embassy Brasilia and cleared 
by U/S Burns' delegation and Ambassador Sobel.
