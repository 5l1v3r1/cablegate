SUBJECT: EMBASSY SANAA'S FY2009 BFIF PROPOSALS 
 
REF: 08 STATE 128559 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Embassy Sanaa proposes two FY2009 projects for 
the Business Facilitation Incentive Fund (BFIF): (1) training 
for the Economic/Commercial officer and the FSN Commercial 
Assistant, both of whom are new to Post and lack any formal 
commercial tradecraft training, and (2) a one-day investment 
climate improvement seminar targeting Yemeni business 
executives and government trade authorities.  Post seeks to 
exploit Yemen's ongoing interest in full membership in the 
WTO and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI) to push the government and businesses to take 
additional measures to build on recent modest improvements in 
Yemen's investment climate.  Expanded capacity in the Post 
commercial section and a U.S.-branded event promoting 
corporate governance and IPR would enhance our ability to 
expand U.S. exports to Yemen.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
PROJECT 1: TRAINING 
------------------- 
 
¶2. Proposed project 1: Training for Economic/Commercial 
Officer and FSN Commercial Assistant in FCS procedures, 
applications, and standards through the FSI Commercial 
Tradecraft Course (PE125) and through one week of shadowing 
FCS colleagues in CS partnership post CG Jeddah or in Embassy 
Riyadh. 
 
A) Justification: Post continues to receive numerous requests 
for commercial advocacy, market intelligence, and FCS 
services such as the Gold Key Matching Service.  Neither the 
Economic/Commercial Officer nor the newly-hired Commercial 
Assistant has received any formal commercial training.  Prior 
to January 2009, there had been no full-time Econ/Commercial 
Officer since April 2008, due to a succession of Post 
evacuations.  The latest State OIG report for Embassy Sanaa 
(2006) singled out the need for commercial training for the 
FSN Commercial Assistant. 
 
B) Planning Milestones: 
 
March 2009: BFIF money is awarded; 
 
April 2009: Post identifies training sites and coordinates 
hotel and logistical details; 
 
May 2009: Economic/Commercial Officer and Commercial 
Assistant complete one week of working alongside FCS 
colleagues in either CS partner post CG Jeddah or Embassy 
Riyadh; 
 
August 2009: Economic/Commercial Officer and Commercial 
Assistant complete FSI Commercial Tradecraft course; 
 
September 2009: Post sends final BFIF report on performance 
metrics. 
 
C) Estimated costs (for two individuals): 
 
Sanaa-Washington roundtrip airfare: USD 7,000 
Lodging (five days): USD 2,000 
Per diem (five days): USD 640 
Ground transportation: USD 200 
 
Sanaa-Riyadh or Sanaa-Jeddah roundtrip airfare: USD 1,000 
Lodging (three days): USD 1,500 
Per diem (three days): USD 480 
Ground transportation: USD 100 
 
Total: USD 11,920

--------------------------------------------- ---- 
PROJECT 2: INVESTMENT CLIMATE IMPROVEMENT SEMINAR 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
¶3. Proposed project 2: A one-day seminar hosted by Post on 
corporate governance, IPR, and FCS services, targeting local 
business executives, SME owners/operators, Chamber of 
Commerce representatives, and government officials from the 
General Investment Authority and the Ministry of Trade. 
Presenters would include U.S. executives based in the Gulf 
and/or Europe, a senior FCS officer based in the region, and, 
costs permitting, an NGO representative from Berlin-based 
Transparency International or the Oslo-based Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative. 
 
A) Justification: Post has long advocated for measures that 
would improve Yemen's investment climate in meetings with 
government and private interlocutors.  A U.S-branded event 
dedicated to improving Yemen's economy and promoting 
U.S.-style business practices, however, would help raise 
awareness of key USG trade and investment priorities among 
key private and public sector opinion-shapers. 
 
B) Planning Milestones: 
 
March 2009: BFIF money is awarded; 
 
April-June 2009: Post works with local businesspeople and the 
Sana'a Chamber of Commerce to identify a site, sponsors, and 
participants for the Investment Climate Improvement Seminar; 
 
July 2009: Post coordinates site preparation, participant 
travel, and sponsor participation; 
 
September-October 2009: Post and designated partners host the 
one-day Seminar; 
 
November 2009: Ambassador hosts follow-up dinner for select 
Seminar participants to discuss improving Yemen's investment 
climate and U.S. business opportunities.  (Note: As per 
reftel, this event would draw on Embassy representational 
funds, not BFIF.  End Note); 
 
November 2009: Post sends final BFIF report on performance 
metrics. 
 
C) Estimated costs (for two individuals): 
 
Roundtrip airfare for five EU-based speakers: USD 15,000 
Roundtrip airfare for two Gulf-based speakers: USD 2,000 
Site rental and hosting costs (cost-shared with partners): 
3,000 
Lodging (one night) for seven speakers: USD 1000 
Per diem (two days): USD 560 
RSO-coordinated security for eight hour event: USD 4,000 
 
Total: USD 25,560
