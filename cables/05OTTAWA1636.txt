START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Like many recent Algerian immigrants to Canada, Ahmed 
Mahidjiba's academic achievements are impressive.  Since 
arriving in Montreal nine years ago, Ahmed has completed a 
Masters and a PhD in fluid mechanics and aerothermics at 
Montreal's prestigious  ole Polytechnique.  He is 
completing another PhD at the Universit du Qubec 
Montral in the sociology of immigration and ethnic 
relations. Mahidjiba's day job is with Ouranos, Quebec's 
center on climate research, where he is presently developing 
a digital model dealing with climate and atmospheric 
problems.  But equally as important for the Consulate, Ahmed 
is the President and a founding member of the Algerian 
Cultural Center in Montreal. 
l. 
Montreal's Algerian community is young and growing, 
numbering about 30,000 according to most estimates.  Because 
of restricted immigration policies in Europe and the Quebec 
government's policy goal that at least 50 percent of 
immigrants to the province be native French speakers, 
Montreal's North African population will continue to 
increase in the coming years.  Mahidjiba has helped the 
Algerian Cultural Center become the main information source 
for Algerian immigrants before and after they arrive to 
Canada.  The CCA, which receives funding from the Quebec 
government, helps immigrants looking for jobs, it provides 
training in technical fields and helps less-educated 
immigrants integrate into Quebec society.  The CCA also 
houses a radio station available on the internet and a 
newspaper, l' an. 
Open-minded, very articulate and committed to opening doors 
for his fellow immigrants in the Maghrebian community, 
Mahidjiba is a powerful example for younger Muslims and Arab- 
Canadians in Montreal.  His high educational achievements 
and his devotion to community service make him someone that 
people both inside and outside his ethnic group look to for 
advice.  Mahidjiba has virtually no exposure to the U.S. (he 
transited a U.S. airport once).   For his IVLP program, 
Mahidjiba would like to concentrate on issues related to 
Muslim/Arab integration in the U.S., and U.S. policies 
toward the Muslim world.  He would also appreciate and 
benefit from several meetings related to U.S. policies - and 
scientific perspectives - on climate change.
