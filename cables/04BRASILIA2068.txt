Â¶1.  Emboff made reftel points to Marcus Vinicius da Costa of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Division of Services, 
Investments and Financial Issues.  Da Costa said the timing 
of the demarche was fortuitous, as the MFA would be meeting 
August 19 with the Civil Aviation Directorate (DAC) in Rio 
de Janeiro to hammer out instructions for the Brazilian ICAO 
delegation.  He undertook to convey the USG points at that 
meeting.  Although the GoB has not yet decided who would 
lead their delegation, da Costa said he would deliver 
Secretary Mineta's and FAA Administrator Blakey's invitation 
 
SIPDIS 
to the heads-of-delegation lunch to whomever is selected.
