(SBU) We delivered reftel demarches to MFA Department of 
International Organizations Senior Counselor Valentin 
Berezovskiy on May 18 and May 22, respectively.  In both 
cases, the MFA appeared unaware of the state of play in New 
York on this issue, and did not have copies of the draft UNSC 
Presidential Statement or the subsequent press statement.  We 
provided copies of both documents to the MFA and urged 
Russian support for them.
