¶1. (U) According to a January 14 press release by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, President Medvedev has ordered 
the Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) to assist 
Haiti in dealing with the effects of the January 12 
earthquake.  Russia has already dispatched three EMERCOM 
planes carrying medical equipment; provisions; and a team of 
over 120 rescuers, doctors, and psychiatrists to Haiti.  The 
IL-76 planes and Bo-105/Bk-117 helicopters sent can also be 
used to assist the UN mission in assessing the impact of the 
natural disaster and coordinating the international response. 
 In addition, EMERCOM's IL-76 plane is equipped with doctors 
and an onboard hospital.  Press reports indicated that the 
hospital is capable of accommodating up to 50 patients and 
features state-of-the-art diagnostic, therapeutic, and 
surgery facilities. 
 
¶2. (U) The GOR does not maintain an embassy in Haiti but has 
sent a group of diplomats from the Russian mission in 
Venezuela to Haiti in order to coordinate assistance.
