PROJECT 
------- 
 
¶3.  Program on Border Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights 
 
TARGET:  Turkish Customs Service 
 
LOCATION:  Turkey 
 
FORMAT: Technical Assistance Workshops 
 
FUNDING:  USPTO estimates that $47,595 would be needed for this 
training.  This funding would cover travel, lodging and per diem for 
four speakers, equipment rental, interpretation, local travel and 
business related telephone and Internet usage. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶4.  Turkey remains on the USTR Special 301 Priority Watchlist in 
part due to ongoing problems with the production and distribution of 
pirated goods.  Turkey's geographic location also makes it a key 
transit point for goods produced in countries such as Russia and 
China destined for markets in Europe and the U.S.  Industry reports 
that Customs procedures in Turkey are not effective.  The procedures 
are too complicated and time consuming.  In the area of border 
measures, the absence of a single filing system (which will allow 
right-holders to enjoy brand protection in several or all customs 
directorates) is a serious obstacle to effective IPR protection all 
over Turkey.  This situation also discourages right-holders from 
applying for border measures.  The European Commission has noted 
that coordination between Customs and other relevant authorities 
(Ministry of Culture, Patent Office, police and IPR courts) is in 
need of improvement. 
 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  The project would take place over a one-year period with direct 
involvement of Turkish Customs Service.  The program would provide 
technical assistance in IP border enforcement through instruction 
provided by USG experts.  Moreover, the program would train Turkish 
customs officials to effectively implement the new Customs 
regulations and coordinate with Turkish law enforcement agencies. 
The program would utilize a series of problem-solving exercises in 
small groups, and would focus on the day-to-day implementation of 
the Customs Code and TRIPS border enforcement obligations. 
 
¶6.  The problem solving exercises would cover the full-range of IP 
enforcement issues faced by Customs inspectors.  This would include 
the implementation of IP applications system where right holders can 
register their IP, detection techniques, seizure procedures, "ex 
officio" authority, co-operation with rights holders, and 
coordination with other law enforcement agencies and prosecutors. 
The USPTO has previously conducted such focused-training exercises 
and found that they provide an effective approach to engaging the 
workshop participants.  The project would involve two three-day 
programs conducted over a period of one year. 
 
GOALS/PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7.  The short-term goals of the program would be to provide Turkish 
border enforcement officials with:  1) tools necessary to detect the 
movement of infringing goods; 2) experience in working with rights 
holders; 3) an understanding of new practices in border enforcement. 
 Further, the project will seek to provide an institutional 
framework and operational procedures for continuing enforcement 
activity at the border using limited resources. 
 
¶8.  Performance measures for the program will include: 
 
-- Use of information gained in workshop in daily activities; 
-- Interaction between Customs officials in different regions; 
-- Decrease or increase in interest in intellectual property 
enforcement; 
-- Desire for further intellectual property enforcement technical 
assistance; and 
 
ANKARA 00001492  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
-- Increase or decrease in level of intellectual property 
enforcement at border post. 
 
¶9.  Success for the project would be determined by the degree to 
which enforcement activity has increased at border points in Turkey 
and implemented a more efficient application system. 
 
SUSTAINABILITY 
-------------- 
 
¶10.  The workshop provides ongoing benefits in two areas, by 
providing border enforcement officials with tools for providing 
their own training after program is completed; and providing a 
framework through which future training could be conducted.
