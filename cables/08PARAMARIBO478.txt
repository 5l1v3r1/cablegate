 ¶1. (SBU) On December 2, Pol-Econ Chief met with Chantal 
Elsenhout, Acting Head of the International Organizations 
Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the 
Government of the Republic of Suriname (GOS).  Pol-Econ Chief 
asked Elsenhout if Suriname's memberships in the G-77 or OIC 
would influence the GOS position on the resolutions.  AS is 
the standard GOS approach, Elsenhout responded that she did 
not know if the GOS would go with a bloc vote on these 
resolutions or make a decision on a case-by-case basis.  That 
said, she noted that this same issue of multiple resolutions 
comes up annually, so she said MOFA would research the issue 
as it warranted further discussion within the ministry. 
 
¶2. (U) Post will report any subsequent response from MOFA in 
a separate cable.
