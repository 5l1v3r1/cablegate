Â¶B. KATSAKIS-BALLARD EMAIL 11/10/08 
 
(U) Officials from Tulskiy Oruzheiniy Zavod refused to meet with us. 
 The company's Director General Nikolay Pushkin instead sent us a 
fax (passed to PM/DTCC via ref B email) stating Tulskiy Oruzheiniy 
Zavod has an agreement to produce Winchester firearms.  According to 
the fax, all other inquiries should be made to BWA Incorporated. 
Mr. Pushkin did not provide us with details of his company's 
contract with BWA, nor the relationship between Tulskiy Oruzheiniy 
Zavod and Miroku Firearms.  He also did not tell us if his company 
understood its obligations as a manufacturer of USML items.
