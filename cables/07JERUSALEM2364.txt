Hamas Police Kill 9 at Fatah Rally 
to Commemorate Yasser Arafat's Death 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Fatah contacts and Gaza hospitals report nine Fatah 
members were killed, at least 60 were injured, and dozens 
were arrested after Hamas police fired on a November 12 Gaza 
City rally attended by 200,000 Palestinians to commemorate 
the third anniversary of Yasser Arafat's death.  Fatah 
contacts say the rally proceeded at al-Khatiba Square without 
incident, even as organizer Ahmad Hillis and Fatah Central 
Committee (FCC) member Zakariya al-Agha lashed out at "Hamas 
mutineers' oppression in the Gaza Strip" and said Fatah will 
continue to lead Palestinians to their destiny.  However, 
Fatah leaders report that Hamas police opened fire from 
rooftops as the speeches concluded and tried to disperse 
marchers with clubs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hamas media outlets said the clashes erupted when 
Fatah activists threw stones at Hamas police and Fatah gunmen 
opened fire from the grounds of al-Azhar University at 
rooftop Hamas policemen, injuring 4 of them.  Hamas spokesman 
Islam Shahwan told local press that Hamas approved the rally 
in advance, but alleged that "Fatah gunmen shot at Hamas 
police on direct orders from Mukhabarat chief Tawfiq Tirawi." 
 
Abbas Declares Mourning Period 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) President Abbas declared a three-day mourning 
period starting November 13.  The FCC issued a statement 
November 12 calling for a general strike and protests against 
Hamas.  Fatah leaders held large rallies in West Bank cities 
November 12-13.
