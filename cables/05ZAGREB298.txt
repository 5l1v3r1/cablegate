REF: A. ZAGREB 273

¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Iranian President Mohammad 
Khatami is expected to visit Croatia on March 17 as part of a 
multi-nation tour.  He is returning a visit President Stjepan 
Mesic made to Tehran in 2001 before he leaves office. 
Mesic,s office and GoC contacts have told Post that the 
timing of the visit, which will include a meeting with PM Ivo 
Sanader, is completely unrelated to current discussions 
regarding Iran,s nuclear program and have assured us that 
Croatia supports the EU-Iran negotiations, unobstructed IAEA 
inspections, and calls for Iran to end its support for 
terrorism.  Contacts within the GoC, which to date has been 
unable to coordinate foreign policy with the President,s 
office, are visibly nervous about the visit, afraid of 
offending western powers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mesic has asked Ambassador Frank for points he can 
raise with Khatami to address international concerns 
regarding Iran.  New presidential foreign policy advisor 
Budimir Loncar told the Ambassador this was Mesic,s way of 
showing his commitment to improving US-Croatia relations. 
Post will advise Mesic to encourage Iran to completely 
cooperate with IAEA inspectors, make its current suspension 
of enrichment and reprocessing agreed with the EU-3 
permanent, and end its support of terrorism and its violent 
opposition to the Middle East peace process.  We will share 
the same points with the PM,s office.  END SUMMARY AND 
COMMENT. 
 
MESIC AND IRAN: A SYMBOL OF TITO,S NON-ALIGNED LEGACY 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mesic sees Croatia as the heir to Tito,s founding 
role in the non-aligned movement, as demonstrated in remarks 
from his recent inauguration speech (reftels).  Carrying on 
this tradition as a way of increasing Croatia,s 
international stature appears to have been his motivation in 
fostering relations with nations such as Iran, Libya, and 
Syria during his first five-year term.  Initiatives, however, 
have been primarily cultural or economic.  We know of no new 
initiatives planned for the Khatami visit and expect meetings 
to focus on possibilities for economic cooperation. 
 
¶4. (U) Croatia,s relations with Iran date back to 1992, when 
the new republic was happy to meet with any country that 
would recognize it.  Bilateral agreements and MOUs range from 
abolishing visa requirements for holders of official and 
diplomatic passports to cooperation in economics, 
transportation, culture, medicine and technology.  Activities 
under these agreements are relatively insignificant.
