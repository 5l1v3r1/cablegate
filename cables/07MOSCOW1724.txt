REFTEL: USDOC 00698 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, JSC 
Sredneuralsky Copper Smelter Plant, Sverdlovsk Region, 
Revda, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application D370038 as the ultimate consignee of alloy 
butterfly valves, alloy plug valves. These items are 
controlled for foreign policy reasons under ECCN 
2B350. The licensee is Xomox Corporation, 4444 Cooper 
Road, Cincinnati, OH 45242. 
 
¶3. On March 22, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of JSC 
Sredneuralsky Copper Smelter Plant (Russian acronym 
SUMZ), Sverdlovsk Region, Revda, Russia. The export 
control team met with Nikolay Bulychev, Chief of 
External Trade Affairs department. 
 
¶4. SUMZ was founded in 1940 to smelt copper from local 
stocks of recycled copper products and from raw stock 
transported from mines.  Today the plant is still 
mainly involved in the processing of copper, and also 
produces sulfuric acid for industrial use and a 
variety of sodium phosphates, derived from the copper 
smelting process.  SUMZ is an independent company 
affiliated with the Urals Mountains Copper Company, a 
holding company affiliated with over 20 mines and 
processing facilities throughout the Urals.  SUMZ 
employs 4500 at its large factory complex located 
approximately 7 km from the town of Revda.  NOTE: 
Further information in English is available on the 
Internet at http://www.sumz.umn.ru/eng/index.htm END 
NOTE. 
 
¶5. The valves in reftel will be used in the third 
phase of reconstruction of the sulfuric acid 
processing plant.  Canadian industrial engineering 
firm SNC-Lavalin is the principal contractor, and 
recommended the use of the Oxmox valves in reftel. 
The production of sulfuric acid requires high-quality 
valves.  The current facility is utilizing valves of 
similar design, some over fifty years old.  New valves 
will increase safety and efficiency in the plant. 
These processes reduce hazardous waste, and redirect 
otherwise harmful substances from landfills. 
 
¶6. The SUMZ facilities are protected by a company 
operated security service, with armed guards, 
electronic surveillance systems, and canine patrols. A 
3-meter (10 feet) high fence with manned security 
checkpoints at the gates surrounds the perimeter of 
the plant.  Vehicles must have the appropriate access 
pass, and all vehicles entering and exiting are 
searched. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC Sredneuralsky 
Copper Smelter Plant, Sverdlovsk Region, Revda, 
Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
