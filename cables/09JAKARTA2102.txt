SUMMARY:   We visited PT ATS Buana Airtech - an Indonesian entity in 
the Aviation Industry Supply Business - on 22 December 2009 and met 
with President and Registered Broker Tience Sumartini to verify the 
Bona Fides of the company requested REFTEL.  We found the company to 
be legitimate.  President Sumartini was aware of the restrictions on 
United States Munitions List (USML) items, particularly the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND AND FACT FINDING 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On the evening of 22 December 2009, Econoff conducted a site 
visit of PT Ats Buana Airtech (ATS) at ATS's listed Jalan Sekolah 
Duta Indah Plaza 2 office site.  ATS occupied three floors in the 
busy office complex.   Econoff was easily able to find ATS listed on 
the web and the physical location was clearly marked and recognized 
by guards and fellow denizens of the office area.  Setting up the 
meeting date was transparent and easy. 
 
¶3.  Econoff met directly with Founder and President of ATS, Mrs. 
Tience Sumartini and engaged in a warm discussion about ATS and its 
various functions.  Mrs. Sumartini described ATS as an aviation 
service company that operates in the Indonesian market supplying 
aircraft parts, aircraft leasing, and aircraft interiors.    ATS's 
primary market is to domestic Indonesian airlines, aircraft 
manufacturers, and aviations training institutions.   The list of 
ATS clients includes Garuda, Lion Air, Indonesian airspace and 
several other small airlines and aviation services companies.   ATS 
is licensed broker for the US firm United Technologies International 
(UTI), and two corporations under UTI's corporate umbrella, Pratt 
and Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand and sells UTI's commercial 
products to the above noted client base. 
 
¶4.  Mrs. Sumartini explained that her connection to USML items comes 
from her relationship with Pratt and Whitney, who also happen to 
supply the engines for the Indonesian Air Force's F-16's. Pratt and 
Whitney has asked ATS to expand on her commercial relationship and 
to engage with the Indonesian Air Force to re-initiate a 
relationship with them so that Pratt and Whitney may gain 
maintenance contracts on the aging engines which Pratt and Whitney 
states have not received the advised maintenance in over 8 years. 
Pratt and Whitney is concerned that their own engines, poorly 
maintained as they are, are increasingly unsafe.  Mrs. Sumartini 
advised that in this capacity, she has actually done very little 
other than to make inquires with the Air Force; she has sold no 
materials and as of yet, not signed maintenance agreement. 
Accordingly, she does not store any USML items, 
 
¶5.  ATS was established in 1979 by Mrs. Sumartini and now has 
approximately 20 employees. Mrs. Sumartini is an avid pilot herself 
and has also founded the Bali Flight School where all Garuda pilots 
now receive their training. 
 
¶6.  Econoff is unaware of any derogatory background information that 
exists on ATS. Econoff highlighted to Mrs. Sumartini the important 
position that she occupied as a licensed vendor of USML items and 
urged her to always comply with rules that regulated this special 
relationship, and in particular as it related to end-user 
documentation.  Mrs. Sumartini stated that she understood completely 
and expressed her desire to be a willing and forward leaning partner 
in this arrangement.
