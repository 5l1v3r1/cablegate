National Security Council Convenes 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶1. Turkey's National Security Council (NSC) held its bi-monthly 
meeting on December 28.  Internal developments affecting Turkey's 
national security and the PKK terrorist organization topped the 
agenda.  Recent developments in Iraq and the Iraq Study Group's 
report were discussed and Turkey's related policies reviewed. 
Participants noted the importance of intensifying Turkey's 
cooperation with the USA, Iraq's neighbors, the United Nations, 
Organization of the Islamic Conference and Arab League.  Turkey-EU 
relations and Cyprus were among other issues discussed in the 
meeting. 
 
Defense Industry Executive Committee Convenes

¶2. Turkey's top decision making body on defense industrial

comprised of the Prime Minister, Chief of the General Staff and 
Minister of Defense, convened on December 12.  The DIEC was expected 
to give its final decision on the tactical and reconnaissance Attack 
Helicopter Project (ATAK), but postponed its decision after the 
Turkish General Staff (TGS) proposed a trial of South Africa's Denel 
and Italy's Augusta Westland helicopters, the two companies which 
submitted bids for the helicopter tender.  The committee approved 
the purchase of 30 F-16s from Lockheed Martin and agreed on Turkey's 
continued participation in the Joint Strike Fighter project.  DIEC 
also authorized the Defense Industry Undersecretariat (SSM) to 
launch eight new projects with maximum local content under the
