¶1. (U) A 27 year-old MBA student, wanted by U.S. law enforcement for 
allegedly setting up an elaborate terrorism-support network for the 
Tamil Tigers, was awarded a C$5,000 academic prize for his 
"entrepreneurial skills" by Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, 
Ontario.  The student, Suresh Sriskandarajah (DOB: 31 July 1980) is 
also known as "Waterloo Suresh" to Tamil Tiger leaders overseas. 
The U.S. has asked Canada to extradite him to the U.S. to stand 
trial on charges of acquiring C$22,000 worth of sensitive 
warship-building software for the Tamil Tigers and related 
money-laundering charges.  The student is free on bail pending the 
outcome of his extradition hearing, currently scheduled for January 
¶2009.  Some, but not all, of his activities are alleged to have 
occurred before Canada's Conservative government blacklisted the 
Tamil Tigers as a terrorist group in the spring of 2006. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT:  Canadian census data indicates that 98,000 
Canadians claim Tamil as their mother tongue.  This award would seem 
to indicate that not all Canadians view the Tamil Tigers as the 
terrorists that Canadian and U.S. law hold them to be.  END COMMENT.
