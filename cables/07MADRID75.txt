(C)  ESTHOFF made reftel points January 12 to MFA Disarmament 
Affairs Deputy Director General Ignacio Sanchez, briefing him 
on recent U.S. efforts to encourage Brazilian participation 
in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and passing 
copies of the nonpapers prepared to answer Brazilian 
concerns.  Sanchez said that Spain was considering further 
approaches to Brazil in the aftermath of repeated Spanish 
2006 demarches to encourage Brazilian PSI membership.  Rather 
than another demarche, Spain is considering hosting a PSI 
event in Latin America along with another Latin American PSI 
member.  Brazil would be invited to observe.  Spain is also 
considering enlisting Argentina in a PSI approach to Brazil. 
Sanchez said that Spain would continue to keep the U.S. 
informed of its active efforts to encourage greater Latin 
American PSI participation.
