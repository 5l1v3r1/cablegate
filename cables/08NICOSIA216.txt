¶1.  (SBU) As reported Reftel, police enforcement action against IPR 
piracy seems to be on the rise.  During 2007, the police launched 
188 raids on suspected pirates, seizing 188,516 pirated items 
(mostly of DVDs and CDs), compared to 114 raids and 77,763 seized 
items in 2006. Thus far, this trend has been sustained in 2008. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 24, the local press carried an article about a 
police raid on two shops in Nicosia, resulting in the seizure of 
3,155 counterfeit DVDs. This is one of a series of widely-publicized 
raids that have taken place over the past few months.  When Post 
called to congratulate Nicos Chrysostomou, the Head of the Police 
Office for Combating Intellectual Property Theft, he noted that, for 
the first time ever, the new Four-Year Strategic Plan of the police 
(covering the years 2008-12) makes explicit reference to 
strengthening IPR enforcement.  Specifically, the plan requires 
police authorities in the four main districts to go out and raid 
suspected pirate shops, setting specific goals.  Chrysostomou was 
happy to see that the plan had energized regional police departments 
to be more pro-active on IPR enforcement.  With increased support 
from his men in the field, Chrysostomou now feels that he has more 
time to tackle strategic/procedural issues to upgrade his 
department's effectiveness. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Chrysostomou also noted that his department has been 
making good use of the evidence law, passed in February 2004.  This 
law grants Cypriot judges discretionary authority to admit hearsay 
and electronic reproductions as evidence in trials.  These changes 
facilitate prosecution of IPR cases by the Police.  Furthermore, he 
noted, District Courts (particularly in Nicosia) are now more 
inclined to pass stricter sentences against pirates, taking 
advantage of amendments to the copyright law passed in 2002 
providing increased penalties.  The increase in penalties also 
allows the police to raid businesses suspected of being engaged in 
piracy without having to obtain a search warrant. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Chrysostomou continues to support our efforts to amend 
existing copyright legislation and reverse the IPR burden of proof 
onto the defendant, making prosecution easier. Chrysostomou (who is 
just back from a three-week IPR training program in the States, 
funded by the USG) commented, "Until we are given a better law, we 
will just have to make the best of the existing law to fight 
piracy." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment: The recent police actions exemplify a growing 
degree of awareness and sensitivity of IPR issues among GOC 
agencies.  We have witnessed similar trends with Customs and, more 
recently, with the Consumer Protection Service of the Ministry of 
Commerce, Industry and Tourism.  These developments lead us to 
expect piracy to continue declining in the government-controlled 
area.  Unfortunately, in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots, 
the IPR situation is much worse.  With that in mind, Post will 
organize two IPR workshops on both sides of the island in November 
(November 20 and 21) at which rights-holders, government officials, 
and attorneys will participate.  End comment.
