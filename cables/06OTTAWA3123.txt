¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to Canadian Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Missile 
and Export Control Policy Officer Jean-Christian Brillant on 
September 29, and at a follow up meeting on October 13. 
Brillant responded that the GOC supported the USG position, 
and would press for the 2007 Panel to build on the work of 
the 2004 Panel.  He added that the GOC would likely convey a 
Note Verbale to this effect to the UN Secretary-General, but 
that the decision to do so had not yet been made. 
 
¶2.  (U) Brillant ended by noting that the GOC would seek 
support for the inclusion of a Canadian on the 2007 Panel.
