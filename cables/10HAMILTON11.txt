Summary 
 
¶1.      (SBU)  Confirming what residents already know, Police 
Commissioner Michael DeSilva revealed that 2009 was the worst 
year on record for crimes involving arrests generally and guns 
and gangs specifically. There was also a 40 percent jump in the 
number of arrests over 2008.  However, post now sees a concerted 
effort by the Government of Bermuda (GOB) and community groups 
to take the steps necessary to get gang violence under control - 
and to see what can be done to prevent it.  End summary. 
 
"A Massive and Scary Increase" in Gun Activity 
 
¶2.      (U)  In a speech to Rotarians on January 12th, new 
Police Commissioner Michael DeSilva stated, "We have seen the 
worst in Bermuda's history when it comes to firearms incidents." 
 He cited three confirmed reports and eight unconfirmed 
incidents of gunfire so far in 2010.  In 2008 there was one 
firearms injury, compared to 13 injuries and four fatalities in 
¶2009.  DeSilva described it as "a massive and scary increase." 
The Commissioner also reported that there were 4,500 arrests in 
2009, the highest on record, contrasted to 3,163 arrests in 
¶2008. 
 
Some Gangs Imitate U.S. Gangs 
 
¶3.      (U) DeSilva also disclosed that there are at least 19 
gangs, with approximately 350 members between the ages of 12 and 
40 who are organized in neighborhood groups.  He denied that 
there has been a proliferation of guns (which are illegal in 
Bermuda), "We actually believe the number of guns are (sic) far 
less than urban legend would have us believe."  He said that the 
gangs involved in the recent shootings share similar 
characteristics and behaviours as gangs in the U.S., 
particularly the Bloods and Crips, making the Island's 
partnership with the FBI important in terms of providing Bermuda 
police officers with gang-specific skills and knowledge.  In 
response to a request from the Bermuda Police Service, the 
Consulate worked with the Legal Attachi to bring FBI trainers to 
Bermuda to conduct a gang course for police and prosecutors on 
January 4-6. 
 
¶4.      Police Plans Moving Forward 
 
(U) Commissioner DeSilva outlined plans for tackling gun and 
gang crime, including selected, targeted enforcement 
(intelligence-led deployment of police resources, patrols in hot 
spots, community engagement, and full use of legislative search 
powers); building criminal conspiracy cases against gangs to 
dismantle organizations; improving the quality of investigations 
and forensic evidence retrieval; denying criminals use of the 
roads; and encouraging the public to provide information.  In 
addition, U.K. police officers will be seconded to Bermuda to 
help, and Bermuda is also looking to the U.S., including the FBI 
for further assistance and possibly also the New York Police 
Department to provide as-yet undisclosed assistance. 
 
¶5.   Comment:  The GOB Determined to End the Violence 
 
(SBU)  The Bermuda Police Service (BPS) now has the unqualified 
support of the GOB to tackle the increasing violent crime.  The 
GOB has publicly committed to work closely with the Governor, 
who has constitutional authority over internal security.  In 
contrast, as recently as early December, the GOB was calling for 
the Governor to relinquish that power.  In addition, the BPS is 
seeking and receiving much-needed support and technical advice 
from U.S. and U.K. experts, which will enhance local security 
efforts.  As average Bermudians wonder "what this Island is 
coming to," community groups have emerged to rally people to the 
cause of non-violence.  There is no quick fix; efforts to stem 
the violence will require implementation of Commissioner 
DeSilva's plans as outlined above, as well as programs to get 
Bermuda's disenchanted young, black males out of gangs and back 
into the mainstream and to prevent others from entering the gang 
culture.
