SUBJECT: UGANDA: PARLIAMENT APPROVES SOMALIA DEPLOYMENT 
 
Â¶1.  On February 13, Parliament approved the deployment of the 
Uganda Peoples' Defense Forces (UPDF) to Somalia.  The 
Defense and Internal Affairs Committee presented its report 
recommending the approval of the mission and ruling party 
parliamentarians debated the resolution for 1 1/2 hours.  The 
resolution carried by a majority vote.  The opposition did 
not participate in the floor debate or vote, but had earlier 
voiced its support for the deployment. With Parliamentary 
approval, there are no more legal hurdles to the UPDF 
deployment.
