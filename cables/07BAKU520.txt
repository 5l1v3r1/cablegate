REF: STATE 49458 
 
¶1.  As requested reftel, I offer Embassy Baku's views on the 
Baku-based Iran Watcher position, 67700005.  Our responses 
are keyed to reftel questions. 
 
¶A.  The new Iran Watcher position has increased our ability 
to report on Iranian activities in Azerbaijan, including 
Iranian efforts to influence Azerbaijani foreign policy as 
well as the activities of the Iranian diaspora community. 
The position also has enabled us to increase reporting on 
internal Iranian developments, particularly among Iran's 
sizable ethnic Azerbaijani minority. 
 
¶B.  As in any start-up position, a significant amount of time 
was needed to establish the administrative details for this 
regional position, as well as the contact base necessary for 
Iran-focused reporting.  During the incumbent's first nine 
months on the job, we have increased our reporting on 
Iran-related issues.  By the end of the current fiscal year, 
we hope to produce several in-depth analytical pieces on the 
overall Iranian presence in Azerbaijan. 
 
¶C.  The position has not been used for any other purposes, 
although the incumbent has volunteered to serve on the Board 
of our Employee Association and the Eligible Family Member 
hiring committee.  We are grateful for his service to the 
community. 
 
¶D.  Our ability to reach out to the Iranian diaspora 
community in Baku is limited by the lack of Iranian visa 
processing in Baku.  We believe that adding Iranian visa 
processing (once we have the space to do so in a New Embassy 
Compound) would increase our ability to develop new Iranian 
contacts and hence increase the quantity and quality of our 
reporting.  Separately, thanks to IIP's Iranian Outreach 
Program, we are exploring PD programs that will include 
Iranian audiences.  If these programs are successful, we 
believe that additional Iranian-focused PD programming also 
could increase our ability to reach out to the Iranian 
community and hence improve our reporting.  Finally, we note 
that we currently are using EUR-funded LES staff to support 
this NEA position (including interpretation and translation 
services, as well as assistance in scheduling meetings).  The 
diversion of EUR-funded LES to support this new Iran Watcher 
position has reduced our ability to promote equally important 
transformational diplomacy goals in Azerbaijan, particularly 
in the area of democratic reform.  We strongly urge the 
Department to consider providing funding for a new, 
NEA-funded LES position to support the Iran Watcher.
