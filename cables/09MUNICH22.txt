SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND 
----------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) In remarks at the Munich Security Conference (MSC), February 
6-8, Speaker of the Iranian Parliament Ali Larijani repeatedly 
emphasized that the West -- and the U.S. in particular -- has been 
applying a double standard towards Iran since the Iranian revolution. 
 He argued that it is up to the Obama Administration to build new 
bridges and emphasized that the carrot and stick approach is 
obsolete.  He noted that Iran is a leader for the Muslim world, 
particularly regarding the Middle East conflict.  For additional 
analysis of the Larijani speech, see Ref. D. 
 
 
LARIJANI: IRAN IS THREATENED 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Following his speech, during the panel discussion on arms 
control on Friday, February 6, Larijani noted that Iran is surrounded 
by a number of violent conflicts, including in Iraq, Afghanistan, 
Lebanon and Gaza, and that the situation in each has worsened since 
9/11.  He questioned the West's policy in the region - from fighting 
terrorism to searching for WMD in Iraq - pointing out the increase of 
opium production in Afghanistan and the ongoing violence in Iraq. 
Larijani did, however, welcome the appointment of Senator Mitchell as 
Special Envoy for the Middle East as a positive signal. 
 
WESTERN DOUBLE STANDARD 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) Larijani argued that the West - and the United States in 
particular - applies a double standard concerning the Iranian nuclear 
program.  He claimed Western acquiescence in India's and Pakistan's 
nuclear weapons programs (despite the sanctions directed against 
those countries following their nuclear tests).  He ignored Iran's 
own violations under the NPT.  The United States, according to 
Larijani, has violated its obligations under the contracts signed 
under the Shah government to deliver nuclear equipment to Iran.  He 
complained several times that the U.S. has yet to refund the money 
that Iran lost on the contracts. 
 
¶4. (U) Larijani claimed that nuclear weapons are not part of Iran's 
military doctrine, adding that attacking other states is a violation 
of the principles of the Islamic revolution.  Furthermore, he 
expressed surprise about Western concerns about the recent launch of 
an Iranian satellite, commenting that a satellite is "not a weapon of 
mass destruction."  He dodged a question about when or whether Iran 
would ratify the NPT Additional Protocol by emphasizing that there 
are currently 5000 centrifuges under IAEA surveillance.  He further 
claimed that all safeguards are accepted by Iran and all sites are 
inspected by the IAEA. 
 
NEW DEMANDS ON WASHINGTON 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Regarding Washington's "new tone," Larijani pressed the U.S. 
to "admit its mistakes first," adding it is impossible to ignore or 
rebut the "Islamic Awakening."  He emphasized that the current carrot 
and stick approach is dysfunctional, and must be replaced, noting 
that "we are not donkeys."  He argued that Iran is ready to cooperate 
and recommended working toward long-term (and unnamed) common 
interest.  He stated that it is up to the U.S. government to redefine 
a new approach to security, stating that "security must have a 
regional face." 
 
HOLOCAUST MENTIONED 
------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Asked about Iran's policy towards Israel, Larijani refused to 
acknowledge the Holocaust, arguing that he is not an historian and 
that Iran does not have laws that ban the denial of the Holocaust. 
Larijani also criticized Western support for Israel, arguing that 
this gives Iran the right to support Hamas, which, he claimed "is 
weak." 
 
OTHER LEADERS WEIGH IN ON IRAN 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (U) During her speech on Saturday, February 7, German Chancellor 
Merkel emphatically warned Iran of tougher sanctions should there be 
no progress in the EU3+3 (P5+1) process.  President Sarkozy later 
warned that time is working against the West.  He noted particular 
concern with the launch of the Iranian satellite and indicated 
support for additional sanctions should Iran not be more cooperative. 
 Sarkozy also called on Russia to cooperate more to halt the Iranian 
threat. 
 
¶8. (U) German FM Steinmeier emphasized that while no one wants to 
deny Iran access to nuclear energy, it is unacceptable that Iran 
pursues a nuclear weapons program disguised as a civilian nuclear 
energy program.  He pressed Iran to accept the offer by the E3+3 and 
seize the opportunity of overcoming 30 years of silence in its 
bilateral relationship with the United States.  The Iranians must 
understand that it is impossible to negotiate as long as the 
centrifuges are turning, he noted.  Unlike Chancellor Merkel, 
Steinmeier did not explicitly threaten tougher sanctions against Iran 
should their efforts continue. 
 
¶9. (U) IAEA Director General Baradei argued for a "freeze for freeze" 
solution to break the gridlock on the Iran nuclear issue.  He urged 
Iran to apply the Additional Protocol and freeze its enrichment 
program, offering a sanctions' freeze (or suspension) should that 
occur. 
 
¶10. (U) Observers of the MSC were disappointed by Larijani's remarks. 
 Even though some participants noted their understanding that 
Larijani does not want to undermine his possible presidential 
candidacy, the general impression was that Larijani's confrontational 
speech at the MSC represented a missed opportunity on the Iranian 
side.  However, at the tail end of his comments, Larijani did note 
openness to regional discussions, which some participants felt may be 
a signal indicating future dialogue.

Larijani's speech at the conference at:
