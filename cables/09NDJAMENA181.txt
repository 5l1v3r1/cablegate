REF:  EMAIL ACCRA REFUGEE COORDINATOR WEEKLY ACTIVITY REPORT, 
5-15-09 
 
¶1. (U) This cable continues a series of regular updates on the 
humanitarian situation among Darfur and CAR refugees in Chad and 
Chadian IDPs.  This report is from the Accra-based Regional Refugee 
Coordinator for Resettlement currently in Chad on temporary duty.

Chad Pilot Resettlement Update 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U)  This week's conference call simply confirmed that all is in 
place for DHS adjudications-housing on the MINURCAT base, flights, 
transportation, and of course, the 169 refugees ready for interview. 
 The two DHS/USCIS officers arrived in Chad on Thursday May 14.  On 
Friday they completed security briefings and received MINURCAT 
badges.   They will fly to Abeche on Saturday to adjudicate Sunday 
through Wednesday and return to N'djamena and depart Chad on 
Thursday May 21.  The two OPE staff in abeche will provide reports 
on decisions and on any cases involving material support as soon as 
they have any information. 
 
¶3.  (U) Following the decisions, OPE will conduct cultural 
orientation, conduct medical exams and return the refugees to the 
camps.  IOM will also need to arrange fingerprints for certain cases 
with pending name checks.  When the security checks are clear, 
medical exams complete and the family placed with a US community, 
IOM will arrange for travel to the US.  All processes are being 
expedited and we will report as the cases become travel ready.

HIAS, Bellvue and Mapendo

¶4.  (U)  Refcord met with Beth Franks of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid 
Society (HIAS), Andy Ramussen of New York University/ Bellevue 
Center for the Victims of Torture and Manal Stuguitis of Mapendo. 
After at least two years of negotiation, HIAS is still pursuing an 
arrangement with UNHCR to create a mechanism to submit refugee 
referrals, similar to what HIAS does in Kenya.  They are also 
looking to make resettlement referrals for some individuals with 
severe psycho-social problems from among HIAS' current clientele in 
psycho-social counseling. Mapendo was present as a funder of HIAS' 
efforts a resettlement referral arrangement.  New York 
University/Bellevue, working with HIAS, was conducting a 
community-based study of vulnerabilities (at one point going to 
implement the High Risk Identification Tool, but is instead using 
other research methods).  They will submit their report to HIAS. The 
study is not likely to reveal any new information about this 
population.   The current Deputy Representative commented that it is 
time to move beyond studies and toward action, including 
resettlement.  All three relayed their observations from the field 
that UNHCR staff and implementing partners continue to lack 
information about resettlement, even after the efforts ostensibly 
made on an information and sensitization campaign.  While there is a 
mechanism for all offices and all partners to refer cases in need of 
protection (not just resettlement) some offices are either not aware 
of the mechanism, or choose not to refer even for cases that are 
beyond their capacity to assist.

Amnesty International

¶5.  (U)  Amnesty International Canada's Secretary General and 
Amnesty International's London-based Africa Researcher met with the 
N'djamena DCM, Pol/Econ Officer and Accra Refugee Coordinator. 
Amnesty had completed a 2.5 week mission to following up on research 
conducted in May 2008 and to observe human rights conditions in the 
East and in N'djamena.  In the East, their activities were 
overshadowed by events, particularly the abduction and carjacking of 
their driver and car, just one hour after they had been dropped off 
(the driver was later released near the Sudan border].  In their 
report, Amnesty will focus on security issues, particularly gaps in 
humanitarian protection and the need to accelerate MINURCAT 
deployment.  Another key issue is sex and gender-based violence. 
Amnesty noted that the issue is well understood, particularly rape 
of women collecting firewood or water outside the damps, but 
remarked that programs to address SGBV are "patchwork" and a 
comprehensive strategy is needed.  Amnesty had looked at the issue 
of child recruitment, but did not find specific instances to 
document during this visit.  However, they are aware that it 
continues to be a concern and recommended funding secondary 
education as a strategy to combat child recruitment (a suggestion 
heard recently from several sources).
