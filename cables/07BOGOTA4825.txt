Summary 
------- 

¶1.  (C)  DRL PDAS Jonathan Farrar met with officials of 
Colombia's rural land development agency (INCODER) and the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MinAg) in a 
June 24-29 visit.  INCODER and MinAg officials described 
provisions in the new rural development law that protect the 
rights of vulnerable groups.  They also discussed GOC efforts 
to return land occupied by African palm producers to 
Afro-Colombian communities in Choco.  Officials at INCODER 
and the MinAg admitted a development plan for Afro-Colombians 
had not been formulated in accordance with a 1993 law (Law 
70), but claimed their work facilitated Afro-Colombian 
economic development.  End Summary. 

¶2.  (U)  On June 26, DRL PDAS Jonathan Farrar met with the 
Rodolfo Campo Soto, the head of Colombia's rural land 
development agency, the InstitutoColombiano de Desarrollo
Rural ("INCODER").  Soto was accompanied by Assistant Manager 
Luis Orozco.  On June 28 Farrar met with MinAG officials 
Marcela Uruena, Director of Rural Development, Eugania
Mendez, Director of Legal Affairs, and Lorena Garnica, a 
special advisor to the MinAG.  Farrar was accompanied by DRL 
desk officer Jennie Munoz and poloffs.

A New Rural Development Law 
--------------------------- 

¶3.  (C)  INCODER's Soto and the MinAg'sGarnica said the 
biggest change introduced by the new rural development law 
(septel) is that multiple government agencies will assume 
responsibility from INCODER for helping vulnerable groups 
with land related issues.  Accion Social will be responsible 
for land issues for displaced persons, the Ministry of the 
Interior and Justice's Office of Ethnic Affairs will be 
responsible for land issues for ethnic minorities, and the 
Office of Disasters will be responsible for land issues for 
victims of natural disasters.  Garnica explained that the 
responsible agencies will decide on solutions to land 
problems which INCODER will then execute. 

¶4.  (C)  Soto and Garnica admitted the transition in 
responsibility will be a huge challenge.  The provision was a 
last-minute addition to the law and lacks details. 
Implementing regulations will be required, but developing 
them may be a contentious process.  The agencies were not 
involved in developing the provision, and all lack the 
personnel and resources to meet their new responsibilities. 

--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
Displaced Afro-Colombian Communities in Curvarado and 
Jiguamiando
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 

¶5.  (C)  Farrar asked Soto and the MinAg'sUruena about the 
status of the Curvarado and Jiguamiando cases in which 
displaced Afro-Colombian communities in the department of 
Choco returned home to find their lands occupied by African 
palm plantations (reftel).  Uruena described the cases' 
background and detailed the different types of legal claims 
involved.  The cases are complex because of the mix of 
legitimate private properties and illegal claims within 
different Afro-Colombian communal territories, and the lack 
of well-defined property boundaries.  Soto said INCODER 
expects to identify conflicting land claims and boundaries 
within months, and that lands could be returned to 
Afro-Colombian communities by the end of the year.  Still, 
litigation over land ownership in the area is likely to 
continue. 

¶6.  (C)  INCODER's Orozco said a key question is whether 
Afro-Colombian communities and palm plantations will 
reconcile their differences and cooperate.  He noted that 
African palm cultivation was one of the few viable 
livelihoods available to Curvarado and Jiguamiando residents, 
and there were good examples in other areas of local 
communities working together with palm companies.  Orozco 
worried that "radicals" in the two communities would attempt 
to destroy all the plantations.  Uruena noted that if 
Afro-Colombian communities did not want palm plantations on 
their land, they could "bulldoze" the plantations without 
providing compensation.  Orozco said a reconciliation would 
require the involvement of the government, human rights 
groups, and the international community. 

--------------------------- 
Afro-Colombian Development?
--------------------------- 

¶7.  (C)  Farrar asked whether there was a development plan 
for Afro-Colombians in accordance with 1993's Law 70.  Orozco 
andGarnica explained that necessary implementing regulations 
had never been developed.  Orozco suggested Afro-Colombian 
communities are partially at fault for not working with the 
government to develop regulations.  Orozco and Garnica said 
their agencies facilitated Afro-Colombian development, but 
noted that banks will not accept Afro-Colombian communal 
territories as collateral because they are legally 
inalienable.  Garnica said the MinAg was working on that 
issue and that government agrarian institutions might be able 
to guarantee future loans. 

¶8.  (U)  PDAS Farrar cleared this message.
