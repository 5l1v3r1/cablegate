SUBJECT: GOZ Deports COSATU Delegates 
 
 
Sensitive but unclassified. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Local Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) 
officials have confirmed press reports that the GOZ 
deported thirteen visiting delegates from the Congress of 
South African Trade Unions this afternoon.  ZCTU Vice 
President Lucia Matibenga said Zimbabwean immigration 
officials broke up a meeting between ZCTU and COSATU at 
10:45 am.  According to Matibenga, the immigration 
workers detained the South African trade unionists for 
several hours, explaining that they were awaiting a 
decision from the GOZ cabinet, which was holding its 
regular Tuesday morning meeting.   Around midday, the 
immigration officials informed ZCTU leadership that 
cabinet had reached a decision to deport the thirteen 
delegates.  Maitibenga believes the delegates were put on 
a 3:00pm British Airways flight to Johannesburg. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Despite the GOZ's attempt to cancel COSATU's 
visit, the COSATU delegation entered Zimbabwe last night 
on a fact-finding mission.  According to press reports, 
immigration authorities held the delegates in the airport 
for 1-2 hours before admitting them to the country.  The 
South African labor body planned to meet representatives 
of both parties and civil society, in addition to holding 
meetings with ZCTU. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Having warned COSATU against coming in 
advance, the GOZ may have felt that deportation of the 
group was necessary to preserve its credibility.  The 
Government may be especially loath to let domestic and 
foreign critics develop any momentum in the wake of 
opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai's acquittal on 
treason charges earlier this month.  The move may 
backfire, though, if it stimulates a strong response from 
South African media and civil society that in turn 
heartens and emboldens domestic critics here or, equally 
important, encourages COSATU to put pressure on Mbeki to 
engage more actively on Zimbabwe.  In any event, the 
truculent move underscores the ruling party's instinct 
for a defiant rather than an accommodating posture in 
response to attempts at outside intervention.
