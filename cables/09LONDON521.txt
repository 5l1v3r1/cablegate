ADDRESS GREEK CONCERNS OVER NAVAL EXERCISE EGEMEN 
 
REF: A. STATE 17263 
     ¶B. EMBASSY LONDON-EUR/WE/UK 02/26 E-MAILS 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Greg Berry for reasons 1.4 
(B) and (D). 
 
 ¶1. (C) Summary. Ankara's response to a February 26 joint 
UK/Belgian/Dutch demarche on the planned multilateral Egemen 
naval exercise was "surprisingly positive and pragmatic," 
according to the Foreign Office's Turkish Team leader, Jason 
Moore.   The Turks will speak to Athens through military 
channels to address Greek concerns; Turkish MFA told the 
British specifically that Ankara will remove the maps 
distributed through the NATO "Cronos" system that depict 
demilitarized islands, as well as revise the search and 
rescue component of the exercise to include coordination with 
the Greek Flight Information Region (FIR).  The Turks also 
told the British Mission in Ankara that it will try to revise 
the exercise parameters so as not to violate the Greeks six 
nautical mile claims and thus avoid any transit through Greek 
territorial waters.  Based on this discussion, and a parallel 
discussion with the Greek Government in which Athens 
reiterated to the British the Greek red lines for the 
exercise (ref A), the Foreign Office is "cautiously 
optimistic" the Egemen exercise can proceed without producing 
tensions in the region.  HMG has made no final decision on 
British participation, pending outcome of Turkish-Greek 
military discussions, but Moore's comments suggested the 
British expect to be able to move forward. End summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) The Foreign Office is pleased with the Turkish 
response to the joint demarche delivered in Ankara regarding 
Greek concerns with the Egemen Exercise.   The Turks were 
"pragmatic" and did not strike a legalistic tone, according 
to the Foreign Office's Moore, who briefed Poloff based on 
reporting from the UK Embassy in Ankara.  The Turks agreed 
that it was important to avoid increased tensions in the 
region and the goals of the exercise would be defeated if it 
provoked regional instability.  To avoid this outcome, the 
Turkish government agreed to engage the Greek Government 
through military channels to address Greek concerns. 
 
¶3.  (C) The Turks specifically told the British that Ankara 
was prepared to immediately address several Greek concerns, 
including removing the maps distributed through the NATO 
Cronos System that depict demilitarized islands and search 
and rescue responsibilities.  Ankara also is prepared to 
revise the search and rescue component of the exercise so as 
to avoid Greek concerns about lack of coordination with the 
Greek FIR.  Most importantly, the Turks told the British that 
operational plans for the exercise "could be revised" so that 
there would be no question of violating Greek territorial 
waters or a requirement to seek Greek permission for passage. 
 Moore said that although it was too early to declare 
victory, the Turkish agreement to speak with the Greeks and 
look at revising operations so as not to cross Greece's 
claimed territorial waters were positive signs. 
 
Greek Red Lines 
--------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Moore also provided information on a parallel 
discussion between the UK Mission in Athens and the Greek 
Foreign Ministry.  The Greeks identified three red line 
issues regarding the exercise, telling the British that if 
these red lines were respected Athens would not object to the 
exercise.  Two were previously identified (ref A) -- no 
operations that cross into Greek territorial waters and 
coordination of the search and rescue component of the 
exercise with the Greek FIR -- and that there be no violation 
of Greek airspace by either fixed wing planes or helicopters 
during the search and rescue portion of the exercise 
 
British Military Working With Turkish Counterparts 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Moore said that the UK Ministry of Defense was 
working with Turkish counterparts on operational plans for 
the Exercise to ensure that the necessary changes can be made 
to meet the Greek territorial concerns and Turkish pledges. 
Moore said that the Foreign Office is waiting for a report 
from the MOD on the new operational plans -- as well as a 
readout of the Greek/Turkish discussions -- before finally 
deciding to participate in the Exercise.  Moore said the UK 
 
wanted the exercise to go forward, with UK participation, but 
the UK was prepared to press for a postponement, or to pull 
out, if the two sides can not work out their differences.  He 
indicated, however, that the Foreign Office anticipates the 
Turkish willingness to talk with Athens will resolve Greek 
concerns.
