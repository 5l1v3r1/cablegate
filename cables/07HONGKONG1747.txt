1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the 
USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), 
Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a pre-license check (PLC) at Soitec 
Singapore Pte Ltd., BL Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 
1, Singapore (Soitec).  The item in question is an 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer 
valued at USD 140,000.  The item is classified 
under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 
3A233 and controlled for nuclear nonproliferation 
(NP) reasons.  The license applicant is 
Perkinelmer Las., Inc. of Shelton, Connecticut. 
 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, 
Soitec has been in existence since 2006.  Its 
paid-up share capital is the Singapore equivalent 
of USD 1.  Singapore national, Ms Anne Choo and 
French nationals Maurice Maxima Mauberger Pascal 
and Andre Jacques Herve are listed as directors. 
The company registry lists the French company, 
SOITEC Silicon On Insulator Technologies S.A., as 
the sole shareholder. 
 
¶4.  On June 21, 2007, the ECO, accompanied by 
Singapore Customs representative Kevin Boo, met 
with Daniel Nogueira, Purchasing Director and 
Elaine Toh, Purchasing Manager.  Mr. Nogueira 
provided a short overview of Soitec, which is a 
French multinational producer of advanced 
substrates for use in various computer 
applications.  One of its main customers is AMD, 
which uses Soitec wafers in its computers.  Soitec 
is presently constructing a new Fab in Singapore 
due to begin operation in September 2007.  More 
information about Soitec and the new Singapore Fab 
can be found at www.soitec.com. 
 
¶5.  As to the specific item in question, Mr. 
Nogueira stated that it would be used in 
production of wafers to test against metal 
contamination on wafers and in chemicals used 
during the production process.  The ECO explained 
that the item is controlled for export and 
reexport and provided additional background 
information and documentation on the U.S. export 
controls associated with the item. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Soitec appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the item in question since 
Soitec operates a line of business that is 
consistent with the item's potential use and 
understands its responsibilities under the export 
administration regulations for its potential use 
of the controlled item.  The ECO recommends that 
this PLC be classified as Favorable.
