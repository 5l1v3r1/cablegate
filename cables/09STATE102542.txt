SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO ISRAEL REQUEST FOR GREATER BMENA ROLE 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 1975 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Background: On September 8, MFA Maghreb Director 
Eynat Shlein-Michael (reftel) requested a greater Israeli 
role in the BMENA process for the fall 2009 workshops and the 
November Forum for the Future ministerial in Morocco. 
Unfortunately, given the proximity to the start of these 
events, NEA feels there is not sufficient time to 
successfully press for Israeli inclusion.  As BMENA evolves, 
member states may be interested in including Israeli 
delegates in future BMENA activities.  NEA will engage with 
member states to build support for inclusion of Israeli 
delegates in future BMENA activities. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request: Please convey the following 
objectives to the Government of Israel: 
 
--Note USG commitment to work for Israeli inclusion in 
regional initiatives. 
 
--Convey that given the proximity to the start of 2009 
activities, there is insufficient time to press for Israeli 
inclusion this year. 
--Express appreciation for GOI interest in BMENA and our 
support for possible future participation. 
 
--Reiterate USG commitment to keep Israel appraised of BMENA 
developments in the meantime. 
 
¶4. (U) Please report delivery of the above objectives and any 
GOI response to NEA/IPA Karlene Frelich and NEA/PI Charles 
Kiamie.
