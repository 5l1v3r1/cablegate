SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 05-050075752 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 05-050075752 for the export of 
rifles to Russia. Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: Unknown end-user, Okhotnik I Rybolov, 
is purchasing several firearms that closely resemble sniper 
rifles. This check is to verify the bona fides of end-user, 
Okhotnik I Rybolov, and determine the ultimate end-use of the 
United States Munitions List (USML) items listed below. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of Okhotnik I Rybolov as a reliable recipient of United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles. Post should also 
determine the client-base of the company to whom these 
firearms may be resold and determine the ultimate end-use of 
the listed firearms. The following points are provided for 
guidance: 
 
(To Okhotnik I Rybolov)-- How long has your company been in 
the business of importing and selling defense articles? Are 
you familiar with the restrictions governing the import of 
U.S. Munitions List (USML) commodities, in particular, the 
prohibition of unauthorized re-export? Who are your regular 
customers and where do they reside? What is the specific 
end-use for these rifles? Where are the rifles being stored 
prior to resale? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to this transaction such as security of facilities, 
concerns about the parties involved, and the nature of the 
company's recording-keeping procedures.
