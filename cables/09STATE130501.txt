SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050204437 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050204437 for the export of 
International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled C-295 
aircraft parts to Vietnam.  Post is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern inquiry within 30 days.  Lack of response 
to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future 
licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: End-Use Statement provided by foreign 
intermediate consignee EADS CASA of Spain states that the 
parts will be used for the C-295 aircraft for end-use by the 
Vietnam Marine Police (VMP).  The Department could not 
independently verify that the C-295 has been ordered by or 
delivered to Vietnam. In addition, the Department requires 
verification that the aircraft parts will not be used in a 
lethal component of the aircraft. Federal Register Notice 
Vol. 72, No. 63 states that the United States will deny 
approvals for exports of components of lethal defense 
articles destined for Vietnam. 
 
¶4. ACTION MADRID: Department requests that Post make inquires 
with EADS CASA to verify the bona fides of this transaction. 
Post is requested to ask EADS CASA to provide documentation 
that verifies the end-use of the aircraft parts, such as a 
contract with the VMP.  Post is also requested to inquire if 
the motor pump on which the subject parts are to be 
incorporated will be used for or installed on the hardpoints 
of the aircraft. 
 
(COMMENT: Hardpoints are areas of the aircraft where armament 
can be attached.  END COMMENT) 
 
ACTION HANOI: Department requests that Post make inquiries 
with appropriate officials as to whether the C-295 has been 
ordered by the VMP.  Post is requested to inquire as to how 
many aircraft have been ordered and when the VMP expects to 
take delivery of the planes.  Finally, Post is requested to 
inquire as to how the aircraft will be used by the VMP and 
for what types of missions. 
 
END ACTION.
