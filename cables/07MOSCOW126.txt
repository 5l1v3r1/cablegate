¶1.  (SBU) This message is sensitive but unclassified and not

¶2.  (SBU) Emboffs delivered reftel points to the Foreign 
Ministry's Africa Department Director Igor Labuzov.  He said 
that a Russian delegation would likely attend the Liberian 
Partners' Forum in Washington, DC, next month, but did not 
yet know the composition of the delegation.  He speculated 
that officials in the Russian Federation's UN delegation, who 
developed Russia's position on the December 2006 sanctions 
resolution, would participate in the Forum. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Labuzov said the GOR recognized the need for 
large-scale and long-term economic assistance to Liberia but 
was not able to provide information on the GOR's plans.  He 
will provide assistance and delegation information as the 
Russian participation efforts take shape.  He expressed hope 
that the Forum would present an opportunity to discuss the 
development, security, and stability challenges common to 
other countries in the southern sub-region of Western Africa, 
such as Cote d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone.
