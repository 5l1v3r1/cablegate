(C) On March 21, Christiano Figueroa, Acting Chief for 
Ministry of External Relations (MRE) Human Rights Division, 
reiterated to poloff that the GOB did not, at present, intend 
to alter its traditional voting position on Cuba at the CHR 
and would likely abstain.  Any decision on changing Brazil's 
vote, he acknowledged, would be made by the Presidency.
