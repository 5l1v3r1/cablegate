SUBJECT: SUDAN/DARFUR: UK SUPPORTS LOW-KEY RESPONSE TO ICC 
ANNOUNCEMENT, OPPOSES ARTICLE 16 
 
REF: A. STATE 19213 
     ¶B. PARIS 238 
     ¶C. 08 LONDON 2195 
 
(SBU) Foreign Office Darfur Team Leader Anne Macro affirmed 
March 3 that the UK Government continues to oppose an Article 
16 deferment of Sudanese President Bashir's anticipated ICC 
indictment and agreed that a low-key response is the best 
course of action after the ICC's March 4 announcement.  Macro 
said the UK wants to avoid a UNSC briefing and is actively 
working to prevent others from pursuing such a discussion. 
The UK has no plans to call for a PRST.  Post will forward a 
copy of the UK's draft press statement in response to the ICC 
announcement to AF/SPG and IO/UNP.
