SUBJECT: FM OF CHAD'S DOHA MEETING WITH SE GRATION 
 
KEY POINTS: 
--  Chadian FM Fekki told Special Envoy for Sudan Gration April 29 
that Chad has lost confidence in Sudan's willingness to live up to 
its commitments and welcomes the international community's 
intervention as guarantors. 
 
-- Fekki agreed with SE Gration's approach to reducing violence, but 
stopped short of promising Chad's help, as SE Gration had requested, 
to encourage Khalil Ibrahim to travel to Doha in early May for more 
mediation. 
 
-- The FM encouraged SE Gration to raise the issue directly with 
President Deby.  He also noted that Chad had agreed to facilitate SE 
Gration's meeting in Chad with Ibrahim. 
 
-- Fekki said President Deby of Chad is pragmatic, like SE Gration, 
and would pressure Ibrahim if convinced it is the right thing to do. 
 
 
End Key Points. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Chadian FM Moussa Fekki outlined for Special Envoy for 
Sudan Scott Gration April 29 the deterioration in relations between 
Chad and Sudan, starting about 2002.  He noted early efforts by Chad 
and President Deby in 2002-04 to stop the conflict in Darfur and 
keep it from spreading into a regional war.  Particularly bothersome 
to Chad was Sudan's attempt to overthrow the Chadian regime while 
refugees were on the move to Chad's eastern border.  In contrast to 
the previous era, when Fekki said Sudan and Chad enjoyed good 
relations, Sudan now accuses Chad, he said, of sponsoring attacks. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Fekki said Chadians see themselves as victims.  They do 
not consider Sudanese-sponsored attacks in border areas against Chad 
- carried out by armed groups living on the Sudanese side of the 
border - in the same league as "unrealistic" Sudanese accusations of 
Chadian sponsorship of attacks deep into the interior of Sudan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The merits of the issues aside, Fekki told SE Gration, who 
was accompanied by Ambassador, S/USSES Deputy to SE Gration Tim 
Shortley  and P/E Chief Rice, that Chad has "lost confidence in 
Sudan" and the latter party's "desire and capacity to implement the 
many agreements" that both countries have signed in recent years. 
In Chad's view, Sudan has not fulfilled its obligations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Only through efforts of the international community, acting 
as guarantors, could confidence between Sudan and Chad be 
re-established and bilateral relations improved, said Fekki.  In 
this vein, Chad very much welcomes U.S. efforts to reduce tensions 
with Sudan. 
 
¶5. (SBU) SE Gration expressed his support for Libyan and Qatri 
efforts to mediate the disputes between Sudanand Chad and said the 
U.S. would be as supportiv as possible in reducing the violence 
along the brder.  Noting his scheduled meeting with PresidentDeby 
in the coming days, SE Gration asked the FMfor Chad's support in 
bringing Khalil Ibrahim ofthe Justice and Equality Movement(JEM) 
to Doha May 3-4 for discussions that would lead to an interim 
cease-fire, especially along the border, and help create space for 
resolving the bilateral and Darfur-centered disputes. 
 
¶6. (SBU) FM Fekki stopped short of supporting Ibrahim's travel to 
Doha in early May.  Fekki did state, however, that Ndjamena would 
facilitate Ibrahim's arrival in the capital for his meeting with 
Gration.  He nonetheless agreed with SE Gration's approach and 
encouraged him to take up the subject of Ibrahim directly with 
President Deby.  Noting SE Gration's plan was realistic and Deby is 
pragmatic and not an ideologue, Fekki observed that Deby would exert 
the pressure on Ibrahim once he was convinced it is the right 
approach. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Fekki observed that President Deby and SE Gration share a 
history of flying airplanes and are both practical men.  Fekki 
closed the meeting by telling SE Gration his bigger challenge will 
be dealing with the ideological elements in Sudan. 
 
¶8. (U) SE Gration has cleared this message.
