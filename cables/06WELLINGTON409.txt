SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND'S POSITION ON "SOLIDARITY TAX" FOR DEVELOPMENT 
 
REF: STATE 60006 
 
Based on conversations May 26 with officials in the New Zealand 
Ministry of Transport and the Inland Revenue Department, the 
following responses are provided to the questions in reftel, 
Paragraph 8: 
 
¶1. The New Zealand government does not levy any taxes on airline 
tickets and is not considering any such taxes.  (International air 
travelers must pay a departure fee, but that charge is not a tax and 
is assessed by New Zealand's international airports, which are 
privately owned.  The government recovers its cost for aviation 
security through charges assessed on airlines.) 
 
¶2. There is no precedence in New Zealand for tax streams from one 
specific sector being used to fund development or other projects. 
 
¶3. Tourism taxes are not used to fund general revenues.  New Zealand 
also does not use dedicated taxes to fund tourism.  Tourism 
promotion is funded out of general revenues. 
 
¶4. Post has not been able to determine whether the New Zealand 
government would modify its official development assistance if an 
airline ticket tax were implemented.  However, the government would 
be expected to oppose the French proposal to tax airline tickets to 
benefit development.  The Ministry of Transport sees the proposal as 
counter to ICAO Council policy on taxation, in that the tax would 
not go toward civil aviation purposes.  The Ministry of Transport 
official noted that ICAO several years ago proposed a voluntary tax 
to be used to help undeveloped economies improve their civil 
aviation systems, but that ICAO members opposed the proposal.  They 
questioned why travelers from developed countries should be assessed 
to fix civil aviation systems in undeveloped countries, arguing that 
there were more appropriate ways to secure funding, such as through 
the World Bank or through properly commercializing the undeveloped 
countries' aviation systems.
