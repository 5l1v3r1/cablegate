¶3.  Mugabe UNGA Speech Hits Familiar Themes...  Oblivious to the 
situation on the ground in Zimbabwe, Mugabe boasted about the 
foundation land reform has established for food security and the 
GOZ's contribution to sustainable development.  He called the US and 
UK vindictive and self righteous, saying those who proposed UNSC 
sanctions on Zimbabwe were insane and "themselves international 
perpetrators of genocide, acts of aggression and mass destruction." 
He pledged ZANU-PF commitment to the September 15 power sharing 
agreement, which he lauded as an African solution to an African 
problem.  For full text of speech, see http://www.un.org/ga/63/ 
generaldebate/zimbabwe.shtml. 
 
¶4.  Mbeki Resignation Causing ZANU-PF Concern...  ZANU-PF officials 
are worried about the impact the sudden forced resignation of South 
African President Thabo Mbeki will have on the implementation of the 
signed agreement.  They fear the replacement of a 
ZANU-PF-sympathetic Mbeki with potentially a more pro-MDC mediator 
could lead to pressure for additional political concessions.  See 
Harare 874 
 
¶5.  Welshman Ncube Discusses Negotiation Impasse...  MDC-M Secretary 
General Welshman Ncube gave us his take on a range of issues 
including the deadlock in ministerial negotiations, South Africa's 
role in breaking the stalemate, and the local and international 
criticism surrounding the MDC-M's controversial leader Arthur 
Mutambara.  Ncube confirmed that allocation of four ministries-Home 
Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Local Government-is holding 
up the implementation of the agreement.  See Harare 878.

¶6.  Donors Discuss Re-Engagement...  On September 25, the 
like-minded donor group held an all-day workshop on donor 
re-engagement.  The agenda included sessions to outline and come to 
consensus on a recovery plan, how it would unfold operationally 
(benchmarks for the GOZ), aid modalities that would be used, areas 
of sectoral interest and expected funding levels for different 
donors, and mechanisms and principles for coordination.  A technical 
note outlining the discussion will be presented at the next high 
level donor meeting schedule in Ottawa on October 30. 
 
¶7.  Violence Continues...  Despite the deal, violence and arbitrary 
arrests continue.  In Mutare, eight MDC supporters were arrested on 
September 19, accused of celebrating the signed agreement by 
attacking the house of a ZANU-PF member.  In the high-density Harare 
suburb of Mbare, dozens of families were attacked by ZANU-PF militia 
members in front of police, who took no action. The families had 
been illegally evicted in the wake of political violence in June. 
 
¶8.  Teachers Still on Strike, Union Leader Released...  This week 
the Zimbabwe Teachers' Association (ZIMTA) joined the Progressive 
Teachers Union (PTUZ) in the teachers' strike, now in its third 
week.  PTUZ President Takavafira Zhou was released on September 22 
after spending four nights in jail in Masvingo.  While he faces 
charges of insulting the President, his jailers accused him of 
interfering with their children's education and leading the strike. 
 
¶9.  Ministers to Continue During Deadlock...  The government's 
mouthpiece, The Herald, reported on September 23 that according to 
Mugabe's chief secretary, incumbent ministers should continue in 
their current positions until the appointment of new ministers has 
taken effect. 
 
¶10.  Poaching on the Rise...  Zimbabwe's environmental degradation 
has accelerated this year in light of growing economic woes and 
ongoing political turmoil.  Despite increased poaching, only two 
culprits have been convicted and numerous others have gone free. 
See Harare 863 and a WWF press statement on rhino poaching in 
Zimbabwe at www.panda.org/species. 
 
---------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  Cash Shortage Worsens...  Banks are barely getting a fifth of 
their daily cash requirement from the Reserve Bank as cash grows 
increasingly scarce.  The shortage drove the bank transfer rate up 
fivefold this week.  In the meantime, responding to intense public 
pressure, the government increased the daily cash withdrawal limit 
from Z$1,000 (roughly US$1) to Z$20,000.  See Harare 0865. 
 
¶12.  Local Currency Falling Nearly 2% per Day in Value...  Since the 
revaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar on August 1, the currency has 
been losing value at the rate of about 1.8 percent per day.  On 
September 25, 2008, it was worth about a fifth of its value on 
August 1 hen 10 zeros were dropped. 
 
¶13.  Zimbabwe Facing ajor Cereal Shortages...  FEWSNET's Zimbabwe 
Foo Security Alert of September 24, 2008 reports thatcombined 
commercial and humanitarian cereal impots must triple from their 
current rate between nw and March 2009 to meet the country's 
requiremens for the remainder of the marketing year.  At the 
current rate, Zimbabwe could run out of cereals y early November. 
For full Alert, see www.fews.net/zimbabwe. 
 
¶14.  Government Widens Tax Brackets...  The GOZ raised the tax-free 
income threshold from Z$500 (roughly US$0.50 on the street) per 
month to Z$15,000 (US$15) per month effective September 1, 2008.  It 
also widened income tax bands; the highest tax rate of 47.5% now 
 
HARARE 00000881  003 OF 003 
 
 
comes into effect for incomes above Z$300,000 (US$300) per month. 
The AIDS levy of 3% of the tax pushes the highest tax rate to 48.9%. 
 Given galloping inflation, bracket creep has become bracket leap 
for most Zimbabweans.

Quote of the Week:  Mugabe on Mugabe 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶15.  President Robert Mugabe, in an interview following his UNGA 
speech on September 25:  "They are waiting for a day when this man, 
this evil man, called Robert Mugabe is no longer in control," he 
said "and I don't know when that day is coming." - New Zimbabwe, 
September 25.
