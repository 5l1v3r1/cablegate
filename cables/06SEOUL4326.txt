¶1.  In December 2005, the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (MOFAT) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 
the U.S. Department of Energy to enable it to contribute to 
the Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production (EWGPP) 
Program (Ref A).  Korea contribued USD 250,000 in 2005 toward 
the dismantling of the Zheleznogorsk plutonium reactor. 
 
¶2.  On December 19, 2006, EMIN Andrew Quinn, representing 
DOE, and Acting Director General for International 
Organizations Choi Sung-joo, representing MOFAT, signed an 
amendment to the 2005 MOU to permit additional Korean 
contributions to the program.  Before the end of calendar 
2006, Korea plans to make an additional contribution of USD 
250,000. 
 
¶3.  An original signed copy of the amendment, called 
"Modification No. 1," is being pouched to Pieter Ott in 
ISN/CTR.
