SUBJECT: HARARE JOURNALIST ABDUCTED, MORE POTENTIALLY TARGETED 
 
¶1. (SBU) Accredited freelance Zimbabwean journalist Shadrack 
Andrisson Manyere was abducted from his home in Norton, a suburb of 
Harare, on the evening of Saturday December 13.  Manyere has been a 
frequent critic of the Zimbabwean government and, unlike some 
journalists, is fully accredited by the Zimbabwean Media and 
Information Commission.  Men identifying themselves as police with 
the law and order division arrested Manyere; other officers returned 
to the house later and took his laptop computer and other files. The 
computer reportedly contained stories he had written for South 
African media that had recently been published.  Since his apparent 
arrest on December 13, lawyers have been unable to locate him and 
police deny holding him.

Herald Accuses U.S. "Spy" of Manipulating Media 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Additionally, in an editorial in the government mouthpiece 
The Herald on December 13, Nathaniel Manheru (the pen name for 
Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba) blasted the international media 
for inaccurately reporting on the situation in Zimbabwe.  The 
editorial declares that Zimbabwe does not need to accredit reporters 
for foreign news organizations.  It also accuses the State 
Department of using a "lady American intelligence officer" to create 
a "full-blown structure" in Pretoria for training journalists. 
Manheru goes on to name Sydney Masamvu (a South Africa-based 
political analyst), Sizani Weza (Embassy Harare's LES Press 
Specialist), MDC's Luke Tamborinyka, Frank Chikowere (VOA stringer), 
and Brian Hungwe (BBC stringer) as implicated in "misdeeds and 
espionage."  Manheru then declares he "happen(s) to know that the 
authorities are about to place a price on those concerned, and let 
no one cry."  Also on December 13, The Herald accused the U.S. of 
"masterminding" the ongoing cholera epidemic as a form of biological 
warfare against Zimbabwe.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Government-sponsored vitriol against the U.S. continues 
unabated, and it appears the regime is making additional efforts to 
target journalists.  Local journalists we have spoken to are taking 
the threat seriously, and see it as a potential opening salvo in a 
further assault on the media.  We are particularly concerned that 
one of our staff members was named in the Manheru article.  The 
recent spate of abductions and arrests reflect significant and 
continuing efforts by the regime to intimidate and silence 
government critics.  END COMMENT.
