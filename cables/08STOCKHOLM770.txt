SUBJECT: SWEDEN TO EXTEND MILITARY COMMITMENT TO AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. On November 13, the Alliance government approved for 
transmission to Parliament a bill to extend Sweden's ISAF 
commitment to Afghanistan by 12 months.  The bill will also 
expand the Swedish military contribution by: 
 
-- Increasing the number of ISAF troops from 366 to 
approximately 500 and raising the ceiling of troops available 
for deployment "in a contingency" from 600 to 855. 
 
-- Sending one C-130 transport plane plus crew, one medevac 
helicopter and crews (date of delivery to be determined). 
 
-- Deploying additional maneuver elements of approximately 
30-40 troops, divided into five Operational Mentoring Liaison 
Teams (OMLTs). 
 
¶2. The bill will be made public either November 14 or 17, 
depending on when it is finally received in Parliament.  A 
joint Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee will consider the 
bill for 15 days before moving it to Parliament for a vote. 
Foreign Minister Carl Bildt's office tells us the vote will 
be held December 15-20.  No government bill has ever failed 
to be approved by Parliament, according to Parliamentary 
Foreign Affairs Committee staffers. 
 
¶3. Sweden also increased its development assistance to 
Afghanistan (see Septel to follow).
