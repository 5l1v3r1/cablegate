SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO SIXTH ANNUAL ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN 
PERSONS (TIP) REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 03836 
 
This cable was cleared by Embassy Tel Aviv. 
 
¶1.    (SBU) No evidence exists of trafficking in persons in 
the West Bank or Gaza Strip, according to the PA Ministry of 
Labor and local NGOs.  The West Bank and Gaza Strip is 
neither a territory of origin nor a destination for 
international trafficking in men, women, or children. 
Traffickers whose destination is Israel could attempt to use 
the West Bank as a transit point, but no evidence exists of 
attempts at such transit.  Beginning August 15, 2005, the 
Israeli government began evacuation of all 21 settlements in 
Gaza, including the complete removal of more than eight 
thousand Israelis and military installations by September 12. 
 PA security forces assumed overall security responsibility 
for Gaza.  Israel initially closed the Rafah crossing in both 
directions; however, by mid-November the PA and Egypt 
controlled the Rafah border. 
 
-- The Palestinian Authority (PA) Ministry of Labor reports 
that it is unaware of any cases of trafficking either to, or 
within the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  The PA security 
services, specifically the Preventive Security Organization 
and the PA police, reported no incidences of trafficking. 
 
-- Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization, reports 
that no instances of trafficking in persons have come to its 
attention. 
 
-- The Israeli NGO, Hamoked, reports that they are unaware of 
any specific trafficking cases in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
 
¶2.    (SBU) In light of the fact that no evidence exists of 
any trafficking in persons to, from, or within the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, neither the PA, nor any NGOs conduct any 
anti-trafficking activities in the West Bank or Gaza, nor 
does the PA provide funding to NGOs for assistance to 
victims.  The PA does not provide any specialized training 
for officials to recognize trafficking. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) The Palestinian Basic Law affords equality under 
the law without discrimination due to race, sex, color, 
religion, political views or disability; however, there is no 
specific law outlawing trafficking in persons.  Laws banning 
prostitution and penalties for sexual exploitation are 
derived from Jordanian law, including a minimum of three 
years imprisonment for individuals supporting prostitution. 
In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, prostitution is not openly 
practiced. 
 
¶4.    (SBU) Post Human Rights Officer Marc Mellinger spent 
approximately two hours on the preparation of the TIP report 
cable.  Post point of contact is Marc Mellinger, (office 
number) 972-2-622-7293, (fax) 972-2-624-9462.
