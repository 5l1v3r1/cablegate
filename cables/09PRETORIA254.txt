SUBJECT: APRIL 22 SET FOR ELECTION DATE; OUT-OF-COUNTRY 
VOTING AN ISSUE 
 
¶1.  President Kgalema Motlanthe, during February 10 remarks 
to the National Assembly, announced that national elections 
will take place on April 22.  The announcement followed 
consultations with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) 
and the nine provincial governments.  Motlanthe stressed that 
the formal proclamation of the election date would take place 
at a later date. 
 
¶2.   A legal skirmish regarding the voting rights of South 
Africans living overseas could delay the formal proclamation 
of the election date.  The Constitutional Court is set to 
decide whether to uphold a February 9 ruling by the Pretoria 
High Court reaffirming broadly the right to vote for South 
Africans living abroad.  In recent elections, out-of country 
voting has been tightly restricted, and the IEC's capacity to 
implement full-scale overseas voting, should the ruling be 
upheld, is uncertain.
