SUBJECT:  EXBS: RUSSIA ADVISOR MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE - JANUARY

REF:  MOSCOW 191 
 
¶1.  Begin summary: BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY 
MANAGERS: The embassy was shut down, as were Russian government 
offices, January 1-8 for New Year's and Russian Orthodox holidays. 
The Advisor is working with the Human Resources Department in the 
embassy and with EXBS Washington on the search for a new EXBS 
Assistant.  Final agenda and logistical arrangements were put in 
place for the EXBS-supported and coordinated bilateral Program 
Review and Export Controls Exchange in Washington February 2-4.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  Completed Actions for Reporting Period. 
 
¶A.  Site Assessments and Meetings During the Reporting Period. 
 
i.  January 12 - EXBS Advisor met with representatives of the export 
controls section within the Security and Disarmament Department of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry.  Present were the Deputy Director of 
the department, Grigory Ivanovich Mashkov; Advisor Anatoliy 
Mikhailovich Bulochnikov; Attache Leonid Nikolaevich Kozlov; and 
Attache Alexander Odoevskiy.  The meeting was organized to present 
to MFA the revised agenda of the Program Review in early February 
and the Program Plan for ongoing activities allocated among FY08, 
FY09, and FY10.  In previous meetings, MFA has taken the opportunity 
to raise concerns about issues outside the focus of the meeting 
agenda, such as the proposed implementation of UNSCR 1540.  However, 
this time, our discussions remained strictly within the purview of 
EXBS.  MFA agreed to coordinate review of the agenda among various 
Russian government agencies and provide feedback to the Advisor. 
MFA offered a few minor comments about Program Plan activities, 
which were passed on to EXBS Washington. 
 
ii.  January 22 - EXBS Advisor met with representatives of the 
export controls section within the Security and Disarmament 
Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry.  The meeting was 
organized to hear the MFA-coordinated Russian government interagency 
response to U.S. revisions to the Program Review agenda.  Present 
were Advisor Anatoliy Mikhailovich Bulochnikov and Attache Alexander 
Odoevskiy.  MFA indicated several areas in which U.S. 
nonproliferation policy did not agree with Russia's, and which it 
wanted to see discussed.  Changes were subsequently made to the 
agenda to reflect those topics (REF 191). 
 
¶B.  Training Conducted During Reporting Period. 
 
i.  No training was conducted during this period. 
 
¶C.  Equipment Delivered During Reporting Period. 
 
i.  The EXBS Russia program does not distribute equipment. 
 
¶3. Imminent Training or Equipment Status Update 
 
i.  On January 25, the EXBS Advisor and U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP)Program Manager for Russia agreed, following a 
telephone conversation, that EXBS would re-approach Rosgranitsa in 
February concerning its interest in an IVP to U.S. ports of entry. 
Rosgranitsa is a new Russian federal agency charged with security of 
border facilities.  The visit was postponed to at least March 2010 
due to the December and January holidays and the extended medical 
leave of the CBP Program Manager.  EXBS has been working with CBP on 
this trip and may also develop program activities depending on the 
outcome of this visit. 
 
¶4.  Significant Developments in Export Controls, Nonproliferation, 
or Related Border Security 
 
i.  A recent press release issued by Russian Customs describing the 
visit of federal and Moscow region customs officials to U.S. ports 
of entry in December 2009 contained the following statement:  "The 
effective functioning of customs in Russia currently is not possible 
without interaction with the customs services of other governments." 
 Validations such as these from the Russian side are useful in 
assessing the qualitative value that EXBS-supported activities such 
as the December visit add. 
 
¶5.  Country Plans and Other Assistance 
 
i.  On January 26, the Advisor participated in a meeting of the 
USAID-coordinated Assistance Working Group called to distribute 
materials and to explain procedures for the FY 2010 Operating Plan. 
As in the past, EXBS will be responsible for coordinating its own 
submission with that of the U.S. Civilian Research and Development 
Foundation (CRDF) under Program Area 1.2, Combating Weapons of Mass 
Destruction. 
 
¶6.  CONTACT INFORMATION.  Joan Agerholm is the EXBS Advisor for 
Russia and can be reached at AgerholmJA@state.gov, or +7 (985)
