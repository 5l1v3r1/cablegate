¶1. (SBU) On May 29, following a series of meetings in May with the 
Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia securities 
regulators, the  U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) announced 
a schedule for completion of a framework that would allow the 
discussion of U.S.-Canada mutual recognition of securities 
regulation.  An Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) contact told us 
on May 29 that they were pleased with the announcement, and were 
working hard to make mutual recognition with the U.S. a reality. 
Through mutual recognition, market professionals in foreign 
jurisdictions with comparable regulatory standards would be able to 
access the U.S. marketplace without registering with the SEC, and 
without direct SEC oversight.  However, our Ontario contact 
expressed concern that the process may be stalled if Chairman Cox 
does not remain as head of the SEC past the November U.S. elections, 
commenting on the fact that the SEC presently has only three 
commissioners (instead of five), including Cox, all of whom are 
Republicans.  The OSC is cautiously optimistic that mutual 
recognition discussions will move forward, at least until November. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) In late March, the SEC had announced its intention to move 
forward on developing a discussion framework for mutual recognition 
with Canada and the European Union.  The OSC and Quebec's securities 
regulator, L'autorit des marchs financiers (AMF), representing 
Canada's two largest provinces and the bulk of its securities 
markets, had been working to this end on Canada's behalf since last 
year.  When the SEC announced on March 29 that it would move ahead 
with formal discussions to develop a mutual recognition arrangement 
with Australia, it was a serious disappointment to the Canadian 
negotiators.  According to our OSC contact, Australia's regulatory 
environment is more complicated than originally expected, and less 
like the U.S. regulatory environment than Canada's. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Canada has 13 separate provincial and territorial 
regulators, but these jurisdictions' laws and regulations are highly 
harmonized through the federal Canadian Securities Administrators 
(CSA).  Without a legislated "single" or "common" Canadian 
securities regulator, the SEC will have to negotiate with each 
Canadian jurisdiction through the Canadian Securities Administrators 
(CSA) -- an organic association of securities regulators, without 
statutory powers -- led by the OSC (ref (A)). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Immediately following the March 29 announcement that the 
SEC would pursue mutual recognition with Australia, federal Finance 
Minister Flaherty pointedly reiterated his well-known views on the 
need to establish a single national securities regulator in Canada 
and has repeated those views publicly since then.  Flaherty has said 
that Canadian publicly traded companies now incur an unnecessary 
C$59 million per year to meet the requirements of 13 separate 
securities regulators across Canada.  Flaherty will reportedly push 
the need to establish a single national securities regulator today 
in Montreal during a meeting with provincial and territorial finance 
ministers.
