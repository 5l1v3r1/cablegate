SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL MEETS ON SITUATION IN BRAZILIAN 
EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Susan E. Rice for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Security Council met in consultations on 
September 25 in response to a September 22 letter from the 
Brazilian PermRep expressing concern about threats to the 
inviolability of the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, in 
which Honduran President Zelaya has taken refuge.  During 
consultations, Council members agreed to move to the chamber 
to hear from Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim, and then 
return to consultations to further discuss the matter. 
 
¶2. (U) During the brief open session, FM Amorim outlined the 
situation at the Brazilian Embassy, noting that since 
President Zelaya had taken refuge there, the embassy has been 
subject to "acts of harassment and intimidation by the de 
facto authorities;" electricity, water, and telephones were 
cut off, food delivery was "severely restricted," and 
movements of Brazilian diplomats in and out of the embassy 
premises were subject to interference.  Amorim recalled the 
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and stressed that 
the inviolability of embassies must be respected.  The 
Brazilian government, he said, is "gravely concerned" that 
the perpetrators of the coup in Honduras might also threaten 
the inviolability of the embassy in order to arrest Zelaya. 
 
¶3. (C) Amorim also said that "I understand that, by calling 
this meeting, the Security Council recognizes that the 
situation of the Embassy of Brazil in Honduras constitutes a 
threat to the peace and security of our region."  (Comment: 
Ambassador Rice underscored to Amorim privately after the 
session that no such determination about the situation of the 
Brazilian Embassy has been made by the Council.  End 
Comment.)  He called for the Council to make a clear 
statement on the situation, in order to deter its escalation. 
 
¶4. (C) The Council then returned to consultations, during 
which Council members expressed their concern at the 
situation in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa and noted 
the need to reaffirm the inviolability of diplomatic 
missions.  They also noted concern about the rising tensions 
in Honduras, emphasized the need to restore President Zelaya 
to his position, and voiced support for the regional efforts 
underway to defuse the situation.  Members reached agreement 
on brief press elements to be used by Ambassador Rice in 
briefing the press after the meeting.  The press elements are 
below in paragraph 5. 
 
¶5. (U) Press elements: 
 
-- Members of the Council heard from the Foreign Minister of 
Brazil. 
-- They stressed the importance of respecting international 
law through preserving the inviolability of the Embassy of 
Brazil in Tegucigalpa and other protections afforded to it by 
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and ensuring 
the safety of the individuals on its premises. 
-- They condemned acts of intimidation against the Brazilian 
Embassy and called upon the de facto government of Honduras 
to cease harassing the Brazilian embassy and to provide all 
necessary utilities and services including water, 
electricity, food, and continuity of communications. 
-- Respect and protection for the inviolability of diplomatic 
premises is a universally accepted principle of international 
relations. 
-- The members of the Council call on all parties to remain 
calm and avoid actions that escalate the situation or place 
individuals at risk of harm. 
-- The members of the Council voiced support for regional 
mediation efforts facilitated by the OAS including those by 
President Arias to reach a peaceful resolution.
