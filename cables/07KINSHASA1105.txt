REF:  STATE 124747

Antipas MBUSA Nyamwisi September 12.  Charge went over points 
contained reftel.  Mbusa acknowledged he did not follow the IAEA 
closely as he is currently spearheading a diplomatic offensive to 
secure regional support for DRC efforts against negative forces in 
the east of the country and will soon travel with President Kabila 
to Europe to discuss this and other issues.

him about "Iranian intransigence."  He promised to pass on our 
message to the appropriate officials in the Foreign Ministry.

other matters, we suggest U.S. officials demarche Congolese 
counterparts.
