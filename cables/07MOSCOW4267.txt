¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Special Purpose Center of FSB, Moscow, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D379757 
as the ultimate consignee of eight thermal imaging 
cameras. These items are controlled for national 
security and nuclear non-proliferation reasons under 
ECCN 6A003. The licensee is L3 Communications Infrared 
Products, 13532 N.Centeral Expressway MS37, Dallas, TX 
¶75243. 
 
¶3. On August 15, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted a pre- 
license check at the International Relations Center of 
the Federal Security Service (Russian acronym FSB), 7 
Izmailovsky Val, Building 1, Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Dmitry Gruzkov, Officer 
of the FSB Arms Service, and Yury Patrin, FSB Officer, 
International Relations Department. 
 
¶4. The FSB is the principal federal criminal and 
counterintelligence investigative organization of the 
Russian Federation.  The FSB is charged with the 
operation of several specialized units which are 
active in antiterrorist operations throughout Russia. 
The Special Purpose Center (SPC) was founded in 1992 
to support the hostage rescue and antiterrorist teams 
known as "Alfa" and "Vympel" by providing equipment 
and training for the team's operators.  SPC is 
participating in cooperative training programs with 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Academy and 
its Hostage Rescue Team (HRT).  The program is a "Top- 
Down" concept, with senior management at FSB and the 
FBI Academy working alongside HRT and Alfa/Vympel 
operators as they compare experiences and establish 
best practices for hostage rescue situations.  SPC 
employs around 20 specialists, and is posted at the 
FSB headquarters in Moscow. 
 
¶5. SPC chose the L3 product for procurement due to its 
high quality and superior level of technology over 
other similar units.  Its capabilities and size make 
it an excellent unit for close-quarters situations. 
Sixteen operators will be trained in the use of the 
cameras, with six cameras being in an operationally 
ready state at all times and two in reserve.  All high 
technology equipment is stored at the FSB 
headquarters, in a specialized equipment locker 
designed for storage of weapons at SPC.  The storage 
area is under 24 hour guard, and is protected by an 
electronic alarm and video surveillance system. Mr. 
Gruzkov is familiar with the anticipated conditions of 
the license, and noted that although Alfa units 
sometimes deploy outside of Russia, that the thermal 
imagers will not be exported outside of Russia at any 
time. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends Special Purpose 
Center of FSB, Moscow, Russia, as a reliable recipient 
of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is requested 
that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
