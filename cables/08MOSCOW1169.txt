Committee (NPT Prepcom) meeting in Geneva with MFA Department for 
Security and Disarmament Affairs (DVBR) Senior Counselor Aleksey 
Karpov and Second Secretary Aleksandr Trofimov.  Karpov and Trofimov 
work on civilian nuclear energy issues within DVBR.  We also shared 
the papers with Vladimir Yermakov, head of the Missile Defense and 
START Treaty Section of DVBR. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 25, Karpov advised us that the GOR was still 
considering the U.S. papers.  Karpov said he would be traveling to 
Geneva for the Prepcom and would bring the U.S. papers with him. 
After GOR review, if the Russian delegation were interested in 
co-sponsoring the U.S. papers, it would discuss the issue further 
with the U.S. delegation in Geneva.
