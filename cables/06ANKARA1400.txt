National Security Council Convenes 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶1. Turkey's National Security Council (NSC) held its first 
meeting of 2006 on February 23.  Turkey-Iran relations, 
February 4 IAEA decision on Iran's nuclear program, and 
Turkey's foreign assistance policy topped the agenda. 
Turkish media coverage of the meeting was wider than other 
months.  The center-right Hurriyet reported that various 
scenarios on Iran's nuclear program were discussed but that 
a diplomatic solution remains possible.  FM Abdullah Gul 
also told the meeting that Turkey had conveyed to Hamas, 
during the Feb.  14 visit the expectations of the 
international community, according to the center-daily 
Sabah. 
 
Defense Industry Executive Committee Convenes 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. The government's Defense Industry Executive Committee, 
chaired by PM Tayyip Erdogan, with the participation of 
Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul, CHOD General Hilmi Ozkok and 
SSM Chief Murad Bayar, on February 17 approved a plan 
authorizing Turkey's Undersecretariat for Defense Industries 
(SSM) to administer an anticipated $1 billion program for 
the building of a major air defense system at Turkey's most 
strategic locations.  Procurement officials and analysts 
believe that the two strongest candidates are the US Patriot 
PAC-3 and Russia's S-300 system (the English-language 
Turkish Daily News). 
 
Turkey's Security Relations with Other Countries 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. UAE: Turkey signed a security agreement with the UAE on 
February 6 to formally expand bilateral cooperation in the 
fight against terrorism beyond combating weapons and 
ammunition smuggling (Dubai Khaleej Times).  Curiously, the 
agreement was not reported by any Turkish media sources.  On 
Feb. 26, Turkish Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu signed a 
cooperation agreement for the fight against international 
terrorism, illicit drug trafficking and organized crime with 
his UAE counterpart Saif bin Zayid al-Nuhayyan (Semi- 
governmental Anatolian News Agency). 
 
 
¶4. South Korea: CHOD General Hilmi Ozkok met with his 
counterpart on February 7 in Seoul during a six-day visit. 
As reported by the Seoul Yanhap News Agency, the primary 
purpose of GEN Ozkok's visit was to evaluate South Korean 
military weapons products for future purchase.  During his 
visit, GEN Ozkok went to the Korea Aerospace Industry and 
expressed interest in procuring South Korea's T-50 advanced 
supersonic trainer aircraft and components for K-9 155 self- 
propelled howitzers.  GEN Ozkok's official visit was not 
reported by any Turkish media sources, nor through official 
channels. 
 
¶5. Pakistan: Turkish Land Forces Commander General Yasar 
Buyukanit called on Pakistani Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff General Ehran Ul Haq on February 16 to discuss 
defense and security cooperation issues(associated Press of 
Pakistan).  This official visit was not reported by any 
Turkish source.

¶6. Sudan:  Turkey and Sudan signed a security cooperation 
agreement on February 18 to fight against terrorism, money 
laundering, illegal migration, and the proliferation of arms 
and ammunition.  Reportedly the agreement included 
cooperation against the harboring of terrorist organizations 
and the establishment of camps by officials of terrorist 
organizations found in either country (Sudanese Al-Ra'y al- 
Amm newspaper).  The agreement was not reported by any 
Turkish official/unofficial public sources. 
 
¶7. Iran: A Turkish delegation attended the 11th Turkey-Iran 
High Security Council Meeting in Tehran on February 19. 
Turkish and Iranian parties signed a memorandum of 
understanding on the fight against terrorism and illicit 
trafficking during the three day meeting.  The HSC focuses 
on border security issues; the Turkish Interior Ministry, 
not the Turkish General Staff, has the GOT lead in this 
body.  Military sources tell us there is no mil-to-mil 
relationship between the two neighbors. 
 
¶8. Ukraine: Commander of Ukrainian Naval Forces Admiral Ihor 
Kniaz met Turkish Naval Forces Commander Admiral Yener 
Karahanoglu on February 21 to discuss improving relations 
regarding security of the Black Sea.  Noting that Ukraine 
was ready to support Operation Black Sea Harmony, Admiral 
Kniaz said that Ukraine regarded the Black Sea as a sea of 
friendship and cooperation (The semi-governmental Anatolian 
News Agency). 
 
¶9. Russia: Russian Naval Forces Commander Admiral Vladimir 
Masorin met Turkish Naval Forces Commander Admiral Yener 
Karahanoglu in Istanbul on February 26.  Speaking to 
journalists, Admiral Karahanoglu stated that he received his 
Russian counterpart to talk about security and stability in 
the Black Sea.  A Russian navy ship visit to Istanbul 
occurred at the same time as Masorin's visit (The semi- 
governmental Anatolian News Agency). 
¶10. Albania: Defense Minister Fatmir Medie of Albania 
visited Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul on February 27 
(semi-governmental Anatolian News Agency). 
 
Defense Industry Activity 
------------------------- 
 
¶11. Turkish aeronautical software company Havelsan exported 
a second aircraft simulator (CN 235 full aircraft 
simulator), valued at $30M, to South Korea (the moderate pro- 
Islamic Zaman daily). 
 
¶12. Turkish Air Forces Command (TAFC) cancelled the planned 
acquisition of Israel's Elop Electro-Optics Industries' high- 
altitude long-range oblique photography (LOROP) 
reconnaissance pods, claiming the system failed to meet 
required standards.  TAFC also cancelled a plan to purchase 
two batteries of 24 Harpy II UAV systems from Israel 
Aircraft Industries.  The American firm General Atomics 
Aviation had competed against the Israeli company for that 
tender but lost when it was awarded to Israel in advance of 
PM Erdogan's spring 2005 travel to Israel (Jane's Defense 
Weekly). 
 
¶13. Parastatal firms MKEK and Aselsan will be subcontractors 
for the Miltup Project, the national tank development 
project announced by SSM for which BAE North America - 
Turkish joint venture and Turkish companies FNSS, Otokar and 
BMC are currently competing (the moderate pro-Islamic Zaman 
daily). 
 
Active-Duty Commander Charged with Corruption 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶14. Lieutenant General Ethem Erdagi, Commander of 3rd Corps, 
who formerly served as Turkey's ISAF Commander in 
Afghanistan, has been charged with corruption in a military 
tender.  He is the third Turkish general indicted  since the 
AKP government won the elections in 2002, but the first 
 
ANKARA 00001400  003 OF 003 
 
 
active duty general officer to be tried by a military 
tribunal.  Former Navy Commander Admiral Ilhami Erdil was 
the first; he was sentenced to 2.5 years of imprisonment on 
a similar charge.  Military sources tell us that Erdagi is 
not accused of any personal gain but of violating 
contracting regulations in one tender.
