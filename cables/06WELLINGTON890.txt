SHELTER-IN-PLACE - New Zealand and Samoa response 
 
REF: STATE 177681 and clarification e-mail, 11/8/06 
 
¶1.  (U)  Post continues to remind employees and families of possible 
pandemic in New Zealand or Samoa.  RMO presented an AI briefing 
earlier this year. The Director of the Wellington Region Civil 
Defence Emergency Management Group discussed pandemic influenza and 
other possible disasters at a recent Town Hall meeting. Staff 
expressed appreciation for the briefing and town hall meeting and 
asked a number of questions. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Post has distributed and stored MRE supplies at central 
points convenient to areas where American and LES reside in 
Wellington, Auckland and Apia.  New Zealand water is potable and 
local authorities have contingency plans in place to address 
emergency needs.  Wellington has enough bottled water to support 
essential personnel working in the Embassy for a three to four week 
period.  Similarly, ConGen Auckland's bottled water supply can 
support emergency operations for the minimum two-week period.  The 
CGR in Auckland and the DCR in Apia both have  small swimming pools 
that could serve as a backup water supply.  We are working with Apia 
to ensure they have bottled water supply sufficient for essential 
personnel working for the minimum two-week period recommended. 
 
¶3.  (U)  AI information and health links are posted on Embassy 
website for American Citizens and the general public.
