SUBJECT: EGYPT WILL NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE COPENHAGEN ACCORD 
 
REF: STATE 3080 
 
1.(SBU) Key Points: --Egypt will not associate with the Copenhagen Accord before the January 31st deadline. --Egypt's reluctance to do so is based on what it believes is a lack of information regarding targets for emission reductions and financial details for the $30 billion global fund for mitigation and adaptation measures. --OES A/S Jones explained that the U.S. will support the accord and noted how it help combat global climate change

2.(U) During a January 20 visit to Cairo, OES A/S Jones met with Assistant Minister for North American Affairs Hisham Al-Zumeidi and chief climate negotiator Mootaz Ahmadein Khalil to seek Egypt's support for the Copenhagen Accord.

3.(SBU) Al-Zumeidi and Khalil noted several positive elements in the accord but stated Egypt does not plan to subscribe to the Copenhagen Accord before the January 31st deadline. "We are not opposed," Khalil explained, but indicated a preference to wait until other countries - notably the United States, China, Brazil, and India - had publicly declared whether or not they will support the accord.

4.(SBU) Egypt's unwillingness to associate with the accord stems from what it perceives as a lack of information in two key areas: specific targets for reducing emissions and financial details for the $30 billion global fund over the period 2010-2012 for developing countries. On the latter subject, Khalil labeled the fund a vague concept and said it was unclear to him how it would be implemented, which developing countries were eligible for financial support, and when distribution of the initial $10 billion (for year 2010) would begin. Khalil also expressed concern that negotiations surrounding the accord were not transparent and did not fully address the concerns of many developing countries.

5.(SBU) Responding to Egyptian concerns, A/S Jones emphasized that combating global climate change is a cornerstone of President Obama's legislative agenda and that the US will associate with the accord before January 31. Acknowledging that COP 15 "did not achieve everything sought by different countries," A/S Jones explained that all countries in attendance at Copenhagen agreed to recognize and that only a handful of countries blocked formal adoption. A/S Jones also noted many countries had already stated their desire to support the accord and this would maintain momentum to "move forward and directly address climate change problems."

6.(SBU) Khalil welcomed US leadership on climate change issues and its willingness to commit to the accord. Post will follow up with the Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs on January 31 to determine if the Egyptian government is any closer to deciding when and if it will associate with the accord.

7.(U) A/S Jones has cleared on this cable. SCOBEY
