Classified By: Ambassador Paul E. Simons for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) The Ambassador used a December 16 meeting of visiting 
CODEL Meeks to raise with Interior Minister (and Acting 
President) Edmundo Perez Yoma ref A demarche.  The Ambassador 
- as well as Representatives Meeks (D-NY) and Hinojosa (D-TX) 
- noted to Perez Yoma the increased risk of narcotics flows 
into and throughout the region as a result of the Morales' 
government's decision to expel DEA agents from La Paz.  The 
Ambassador asked Perez Yoma - whose Ministry is in charge of 
law enforcement matters in Chile - if the GOC could accept 
the relocation of two DEA personnel into Chile, noting that 
the Embassy had raised informally the possibility with 
working level contacts, who seemed amenable.  Perez Yoma 
replied twice that he "saw no problem" with the request. 
Based on Perez Yoma's response, the Embassy will return to 
working level contacts to put the process of bringing the two 
DEA personnel into Chile, as requested ref A. 
 
¶2. (C) Keyed to the action request in para r reftel, Post 
notes:  a) The GOC has informally accepted the relocation of 
the specified number of DEA personnel to Chile; b) Post is 
willing and able to accept the number of DEA positions listed 
reftel; and, 3) Post is willing and able to accept such 
personnel (and dependents) for reassignment prior to January 
29, 2009.
