(SBU) According to Deputy Director Robert Sinclair in the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's Human 
Rights Bureau, Canada is "seized" with the need to keep the 
pressure on in the lead-up to the vote on 
country specific resolutions.  Canada had coordinated closely 
with the U.S. and the Group of Friends in New York 
on the Iran resolution and continues to stress the importance 
of close coordination on all the country specific resolutions 
as we move up to the UNGA plenary votes.  He underscored that 
Canada shares our concern about the impact of Christmas and 
Bali on smaller delegations, and has prepared a list of 
countries it will be pressing to keep the right people in New 
York or use proxies in order to ensure the votes hold. 
Sinclair promised that Canada looks forward to continued 
close coordination with USUN on these resolutions.
