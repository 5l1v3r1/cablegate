¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  On August 2, the managing editor-in-chief of the 
pro-government "Akhbar Al-Youm," praised the U.S. Charge d'Affaires, 
the U.S. embassy's press release upon his arrival, and the 
anticipated return of the American scholarship program in 2008.  In 
particular, the editor-in-chief, Asim Al-Bilal Al-Tayyeb, 
complimented CDA Fernandez on his cultural and linguistic knowledge, 
his recent visit to flood-affected areas such as Kordofan, and "his 
statements and actions which are not hostile."  Al-Tayyeb also noted 
that the CDA is "almost Sudanese," as he speaks Arabic, conducts 
interviews on "Al-Jazeera," and is originally from Cuba, "which is 
very close to the Middle East [in terms of culture.]." END SUMMARY. 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  On July 29, CDA Fernandez met with Professor Mahmud Hassan 
Ahmad, the Director General of the National Center for Diplomatic 
Studies.  (NOTE:  The CDA was not previously informed of the 
presence of the press at the meeting.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (U)  Al-Tayyeb opened the column saying that he requested an 
interview for his publication, "Akhbar Al-Youm," from the CDA at 
this meeting.  Al-Tayyeb writes that he was surprised to learn that 
the CDA knew of his publication and read it on a daily basis. 
Al-Tayyeb then requested an interview from the CDA, and according to 
the column, the Charge apologized saying that a lot of newspapers 
have requested interviews from him.  According to Al-Tayyeb, the CDA 
stated that he needs more time to study the reality of Sudan and its 
mass media. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Al-Tayyeb complimented the CDA's press-release issued upon 
his arrival.  According to Al-Tayyeb, the CDA acknowledged the 
difficult nature of his job in Sudan, but he looks forward to an 
open dialogue with an open heart to improve Sudanese-American 
relations. He then states, "We knew Alberto before his arrival 
through Arab satellite television and [we knew of] his ability to 
speak Arabic which will open a dialogue with the society." 
Al-Tayyeb also expressed his appreciation for the CDA's visit to 
Kordofan to see the victims of flooding, adding that the Charge's 
statements and actions are not hostile. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Al-Tayyeb, ends his piece saying that "we thanked the 
Charge and we support him in improving Sudanese-American relations, 
which will depend on exchanging different points of view."  He also 
expressed his hope that the American University program would be 
reinstituted in Sudan, in order that Sudanese citizens "might learn 
from American advanced technology."
