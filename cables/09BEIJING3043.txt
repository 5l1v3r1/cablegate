¶1.  U.S. IN ASIA 
 
"U.S. influence in Asia brings more benefit than harm" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/04)(pg 14): "The beneficial role played by 
the United States in maintaining local security and stability is 
irreplaceable in constructing a security mechanism for the East 
Asian community.  The United States' presence in Asia will help to 
balance Japan by suppressing its impulse to become a political and 
military power, which has allowed the peaceful development of the 
Asian economy.  The involvement of an external force is necessary in 
the absence of an effective regional security mechanism.  The United 
States can also help to stabilize the situation on the Korean 
peninsula, and to contain the pro-independence forces in Taiwan. 
The U.S. does not want Taiwan to be independent, and thus uses the 
mainland to contain Taiwan but cannot let mainland take control. 
The U.S. also needs China's active participation on political, 
economic and security issues.  But there are also negative 
influences.  The U.S. has disguised its intention to contain China's 
rise since the U.S. is worried that China will become a potential 
threat.  The United States also uses Taiwan to contain China. 
However, the United States' presence in Asia is more beneficial than 
harmful for China.  Why should China exclude the United States from 
East Asia?" 
 
¶2.  U.S.-CHINA TRADE 
 
"We should get rid of dependence on trade" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(11/04)(pg 2): 
"Shortly after the U.S. and China agreed  not to implement new 
protectionist measures at the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade 
in Hangzhou last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission 
started trade investigations on Chinese seamless steel pipes, which 
was perceived as a stab in the back by those who had expected 
decreased trade friction.  Since Obama's healthcare plan has had a 
hard time in Congress, he has found it find difficult to suppress 
fear in the United States over trade with China.  In fact, the 
downfall of the United States' economy and position as the world's 
economic leader will not come about through trade with China, but 
rather through profound ills in the U.S. financial and economic 
system and the U.S.'s democratic and foreign predatory politics. 
However, China's real concern is not increased trade frictions with 
other countries, but rather the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, 
which has led to a corresponding depreciation of the RMB.  This 
depreciation will cause a rise in the price of imported goods and 
attract more 'hot money' into the market, creating more inflationary 
pressure, which needs to be avoided." 
 
¶3.  U.S. POLICY 
 
"U.S. media constantly challenging President Obama these days" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/04)(pg 1): "Obama, a President of 
idealism, has encountered great difficulties in international 
politics over various issues, including the quagmire in Afghanistan, 
the impasse in the Middle East, the deadlock over the Iran issue. 
Chinese expert Zhou Shijian said that Obama wants to continue to 
show the world his ideas for change for the future, but faced with a 
large number of difficult issues, his hesitation has brought more 
perplexity to the U.S. than at any time before.  Is the U.S. facing 
a decline?  Chinese expert Jin Canrong argued that this is not a 
decline, but rather just a difficult time for the United States. 
Pan Rui, a professor at Fudan University, said that the financial 
crisis, which has had a major impact on the West, has turned out to 
be a strategic opportunity for China.  Mr. Zhou concluded that the 
greatest loss for the United States during this crisis has been that 
the world has lost faith in the Washington model and instead some 
have shifted their attention to China."
