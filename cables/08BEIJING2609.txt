SUBJECT: China on IRISL: UNSCRs Require Adequate Proof to 
Implement 
 
Ref: State 69339 
 
Classified by Political Officer Ted Lyng. Reasons 1.4 
(B/D). 
 
Â¶1. (S) PolOff conveyed reftel points regarding 
implementation of the cargo inspection clause of UN 
Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1803 to MFA Arms 
Control Department Missile and Conventional Weapons 
Division Deputy Director Yu Dunhai on July 2.  Yu responded 
that China implements UNSCRs in strict keeping with their 
provisions, and the UNSCRs related to nonproliferation 
require adequate proof or evidence.  UNSCR 1803 allows 
cargo vessels to be searched only if there is "reasonable 
grounds" to believe that the vessel is carrying items 
prohibited by UNSCRs 1803, 1737 and 1747.  As such, it is 
important to implement the resolution so as not to disrupt 
legitimate transactions, because transnational shipping is 
a legitimate right of all UN member nations.  PolOff 
reiterated that in the past prohibited cargo has been 
interdicted from the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line 
and therefore the company merits special attention.
