Ministry of External Affairs.  Nath stated that the GOI 
shares our broad interests in improved governance and 
stabilization in Afghanistan.  He noted that he would be 
traveling later in the day to Kabul for Karzai's inauguration 
and would share our points with the GOI delegation to the 
event headed by Foreign Minister SM Krishna.  We will
