¶1.  (U)  This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloffs met February 21 with MFA Director of United 
Nations and International Organizations Nasser Bourita to 
discuss reftel points on the appointment of the next UN 
Secretary General (SYG).  Per guidance, Poloff also provided 
 
SIPDIS 
Bourita with reftel points in non-paper format. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Bourita responded that the GOM is following this 
issue with great interest.  He added that although having a 
geographical balance is indeed a principle that should be 
considered, this is only one criteria and the next SYG should 
be someone who can continue Kofi Annan's diplomatic 
visibility while effectively managing the UN.  Bourita, 
however, expressed some concern regarding the SYG nomination 
process, noting that, in his view, it is in need of more 
transparency and should be reformed.  Bourita noted GOM 
frustration that the UN demands transparency in others, but 
does not ask for the same transparency in the nomination 
process of a SYG.  For example, the candidates for SYG 
generally only need to lobby the P-5 in order to be selected 
and the General Assembly generally assents to the choice. 
Bourita commented that, in an effort to increase 
transparency, SYG candidates should present themselves to all 
members of the UN, not just the P-5. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  When asked about GOM thoughts on possible 
candidates for the next SYG, Bourita replied that the GOM has 
been approached by both Thailand and South Korea regarding 
their respective candidates.  Bourita also pointed out that 
he believes the P-5 should not be eligible as a SYG 
candidate, as they "have enough other privileges."  He 
expressed the GOM's desire that the next SYG be someone with 
excellent managerial skills and a political profile.  Bourita 
pledged to continue to share GOM thinking with Embassy as it 
evolves.
