¶1. (C) In a July 3 meeting, the Ambassador raised with 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim our interest in 
seeing Brazil recognize Kosovo's independence.  Amorim said 
that Brazil's position had not changed with regard to the 
need to respect UNSC Resolution 1244 (ref b). However, 
Brazil's position is "under continual review," he said, and 
the new UN position with regard to Kosovo may make a 
difference.  Amorim said that he had no problem with 
providing humanitarian assistance if funding is available, 
but Brazil could not do anything that would suggest 
recognition of Kosovo. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a separate meeting on July 3, PolCouns met with 
Ministry of External Relations (MRE) Eastern Europe Director 
Elizabeth-Sophie Mazzella di Bosco Balsa to urge Brazil again 
to recognize Kosovo's independence.  Bosco said confirmed 
that Brazil's position was unchanged.  She was unaware of the 
July 11 donors conference, and said she would pass the 
information to Brazil's embassy in Brussels.  Note: The GOB, 
which refuses to be classified as a donor country, has an 
extremely limited "cooperation" budget that focuses largely 
on other Lusophone countries.  Brazil does not generally 
provide debt relief because of domestic complications related 
to the debt of Brazilian states.  End note.
