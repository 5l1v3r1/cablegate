SUBJECT: MEDIA REGISTRATION DEADLINE POSTPONED 
 
 
  ¶1.   According to media reports, the government- 
      appointed Media Commission has postponed the deadline 
      for registration of journalist and media organizations 
      to November 21, 2002.  The original deadline was 
      October 31. 
 
  ¶2.   According to a report in the October 28 edition of 
      the independent daily "The Daily News," Media 
      Commission Chairman Dr. Tafataona Mahoso announced the 
      new deadline in a letter to the President of the 
      Zimbabwe Union of Journalists (ZUJ).  Mahoso's letter 
      was in response to ZUJ questions about the murky 
      registration and accreditation process for journalists 
      and media organizations. 
 
  ¶3.   ZUJ criticized the accreditation process as 
      "intrusive" and sought clarification on why the  Media 
      Commission required information about applicants' 
      physical address, fax number, e-mail address, cell 
      phone, passport and drivers license numbers.  ZUJ 
      Secretary General Luke Tamborinyoka characterized the 
      application as an "intelligence gathering document."
