SUBJECT: MOFA NON-PROLIFERATION DG NAKANE TO VISIT INDIAN 
COUNTERPART, MAY 1 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Japan-India Non-Proliferation Dialogue 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  EST MinCouns called on MOFA Director General for 
Disarmament, Science and Non-Proliferation Ambassador Takeshi 
Nakane on April 28 to get a preview of possible agenda items 
for Nakane's May 1 bilateral meetings in New Delhi with his 
GOI counterpart.  Japan and India initially had been 
discussing disarmament and non-proliferation on the sidelines 
of a broader bilateral security dialogue, but a January 2006 
joint statement by Japan FM Aso and Indian Minister for 
External Affairs Ahamed calls on Japan and India to hold 
annual discussions on these issues.  Nakane, Arms Control and 
Disarmament Division Director Kiyoshi Serizawa, and Arms 
Control and Disarmament Division desk officer Masamitsu 
Nagano will attend the May 1 meeting. Consistent with the 
stovepiping that persists in MOFA's approach to India and 
non-proliferation, no one from MOFA's South Asia Division is 
involved in Nakane's trip. 
 
¶2.  Nakane told EST MinCouns the agenda will be general in 
nature, but Japan will press India for more information on 
some specific questions, such as the nature of India's 
proposed safeguards agreement with the IAEA and a more 
detailed description of India's efforts to separate its 
military and civilian nuclear infrastructure.  Japan also 
hopes to engage India on export control issues and will 
formally urge India to actively participate in the 
Proliferation Security Initiative.  Japan sees India as an 
emerging global partner and wants to avoid antagonizing India 
and politicizing these issues. (NOTE: Nakane agreed to give 
EST MinCouns a read out of his meetings in India upon his 
return.)

Iran

¶3.  Noting that the deadline for Iranian compliance with the 
United Nations Security Council had passed, Nakane said Japan 
remains very concerned about Iran's activities and its 
attitude. Iran consistently has ignored requests by the 
international community to halt its nuclear activities and 
continues to act provocatively.  Japan has relayed its 
concerns to the Iranian government many times and still 
considers the application of consistent and unified 
international pressure to be the best approach.  That said, 
the GOJ does not consider Iran's latest proposal to be a 
legitimate good faith effort to resume negotiations.
