CABINET RAISES MINIMUM WAGE, 
BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS DISSATISFIED 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) During its September 9 session, the cabinet decided to raise 
the minimum wage for the private and public sectors from 200 to 333 
dollars per month (the first minimum wage increase since 1996) and 
the transportation allowance from 4 dollars to 5.30 dollars per day. 
In addition, it mandated a 133 dollar increase for all private and 
public sector wages and a 100 dollar increase on retirees' monthly 
pension checks.  All these increases will be implemented 
retroactively to May 2008.  Finance Minister Mohammad Chatah noted 
that the increase in public sector salaries would cost the treasury 
around 500 million dollars per year. 
 
¶2. (U) The General Labor Confederation (GLC), which had been 
demanding that the minimum wage be raised to 640 dollars per month, 
expressed its disappointment that the increase was not greater. 
Meanwhile, President of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists 
Fadi Abboud characterized the government's decision to impose 
private sector wage increases as interference.  Abboud noted that if 
the government imposes wage increases on the private sector -- 
transforming the Lebanese economy from a liberal to a command 
economy -- it should also be ready to support industries with 
subsidized electricity and fuel. 
 
FINANCE MINISTER CONCERNED 
ABOUT BUDGET AND DEBT PROBLEMS 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Chatah told the Ambassador on September 10 that the new 
wage increases would worsen the GOL's budget situation, but he said 
revenue from four tax measures he convinced the cabinet to pass as 
part of the wage increase package would cover about half the cost of 
the increases themselves.  With this additional spending, in 
addition to two billion dollars of projected losses at national 
power utility Electricite du Liban (EDL), Chatah was pessimistic 
about any possible improvement in the deficit or budget position in 
2008 and 2009. 
 
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY REINSTATES 
LIMITS ON PROFIT MARGINS 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) On September 9, the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MOET) 
reinstated limits on profit margins in the trade sector, in view of 
global inflation, the rise in the prices of foodstuff, and to 
enhance consumer protection.  Former Minister Sami Haddad had lifted 
the limits in compliance with WTO requirements.  In a meeting with 
the Ambassador on September 11, current Minister Safadi explained 
that he felt compelled to take this measure because he saw price 
collusion in the Lebanese market. Safadi also mentioned that he 
plans to expand the consumer protection unit at the ministry by 
adding 100 new inspectors to the 40 already at the unit, to better 
monitor the market. 
 
ENVIRONMENT MINISTER 
TO TRAVEL TO THE U.S. 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) On September 8, Econ Off and staff met with Minister of 
Environment Antoine Karam and his advisors to assist them in 
preparing for Karam's visit to the U.S. the last week of September. 
Karam hopes to meet with the State Department, EPA, U.S. Forest 
 
Service, and USAID officials, as well as NGOs and members of private 
environment-related institutions, and possibly sign MOUs for future 
cooperation and assistance.  Karam is a member of the Lebanese 
Forces party of Samir Geagea. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Asked what he planned to achieve during his short term as 
minister (until the spring 2009 parliamentary elections), Karam said 
he hoped to establish a network of local environment-related NGOs 
which would become the ministry's primary source of information on 
envQnment-related issues or incidents throughout Lebanon.  Karam 
made a pitch for U.S. assistance in providing NGOs with cameras and 
other necessary equipment to enable NGOs to report to the ministry. 
 
 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BETWEEN TEN 
AND 15 PERCENT AND DECLINING 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) AccQding to the Arab Labor Organization'sQLO) first report 
on employment in Arab states, Lebanon's unemployment rate ranged 
between ten and 15 percent, below the regional average (above 15 
percent), yet high by international standards.  The report stated 
that the unemployment rate in Lebanon is declining, mainly due to 
migration to the Gulf countries and improvement in economic activity 
in the last quarter of 2007.  The ALO noted that the wholesale and 
trade sectors absorbed 24.4 percent of the labor force, followed by 
construction (20.5 percent), transformational industries (13.6 
percent), while the rest is distributed among transportation, 
communications, finance, insurance, real estate, agriculture, 
social, and personal services (41.5 percent). 
 
DOLLARIZATION OF DEPOSITS STEADILY DECLINING, 
FIVE PERCENT GDP GROWTH PROJECTED FOR 2008 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) During his monthly meeting with the Association of Banks in 
Lebanon on September 11, Central Bank of Lebanon (CBL) Governor Riad 
Salameh said the dollarization of deposits currently stood at 73.5 
percent, compared to 77.5 percent in May.  The CBL's gross foreign 
currency assets reached a record high of 17 billion dollars -- 
excluding gold reserves and CBL real estate and investments, which 
would add 10 billion dollars to the CBL's foreign currency assets. 
Salameh projected five percent GDP growth for 2008 and did not 
expect a change in interest rates or the exchange rate any time 
soon.  Salameh also noted that public sector deposits at the CBL can 
cover the increase in GOL expenditure resulting from the rise in 
wages. 
 
MERRILL LYNCH MAINTAINS "MARKET WEIGHT" 
RECOMMENDATION ON LEBANESE EUROBONDS 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) Merrill Lynch maintained its recommendation on Lebanon's 
external debt to "Market Weight" in its model portfolio of emerging 
markets debt for September due to the positive political 
developments resulting from the formation of a cabinet and decline 
in domestic political tensions.  Merrill had upgraded Lebanon to 
"Market Weight" from "Underweight" following te Doha Agreement in 
May.  Lebanon has been one ofthe best performers since it was 
upgraded, Merrill noted, posting the second highest return at 8.31 
percent among 10 countries in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa 
(EMEA) region from January to August 2008. 
 
LEBANON FALLS IN "DOING 
BUSINESS IN 2009" RANKING 
-------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) The World Bank/IFC "Doing Business 2009" report ranked 
Lebanon 99 out of 181, down from 98 in 2008 in terms of ease of 
doing business.  Lebanon's only improvement was noted in the area of 
streamlining business registration, reducing the time needed to 
start a business from 46 days to 11, and eliminating one procedure. 
The "Doing Business" report ranks economies based on ten indicators: 
ease of starting a business, dealing with construction permits, 
employing workers, registering property, access to credit, 
protecting investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, 
enforcing contracts, and closing a business. 
 
LEBANON RANKS SIXTH IN INTERNET 
PENETRATION IN MENA REGION 
 
-------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) According to Internetworldstats.com, Lebanon ranked sixth 
out of 14 MENA countries in terms of internet penetration, with 
internet users constituting 24.2 percent of the population in 2007. 
Compared to other MENA countries, Lebanon accounted for three 
percent of total internet users for 2007, while growth in internet 
usage in 2000-2007 was 217 percent, the fourth lowest rate in the 
region.  Internetworldstats.com compiles data from a variety of 
sources including internet media, market researcher Nielsen Net 
Ratings, and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).
