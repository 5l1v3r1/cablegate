SUBJECT: Taiwan Plans Expansion of Taichung Airport 
 
 
¶1. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) announced plans April 
7 to expand Taichung's Cing Cyuan Gang (CCK) Airport.  The expansion 
cost is projected to be NT$1.48 billion (US$44.8 million).  After 
the expansion, the facility will be able to handle two 737-800 
passenger jets at the same time. Construction is scheduled to be 
completed in December 2009. 
 
¶2. At the ceremony where CAA Director General Billy Chang announced 
the expansion, President Chen Shui-bian called on CAA to further 
expand the role of CCK Airport.  In addition to charter flights to 
Southeast Asian destination planned by CAA, Chen suggested the 
airport should also handle cross-Strait charter flights and more 
cargo services.
