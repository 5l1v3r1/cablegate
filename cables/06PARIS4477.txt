SUBJECT: FRANCE/UN: DRAFT REFORM RESOLUTION USEFUL; TIME TO 
LIFT BUDGET CAP 
 
REF: STATE 105146 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Embassy delivered reftel demarche points at 
opening of business on June 27 to MFA IO PDAS-equivalent 
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, DAS-equivalent Jean-Hugues Simon-Michel, 
and IO desk officer Nicholas Kassianides.  Lacroix offered 
feedback on June 28 in which he emphasized French concurrence 
on reform priorities, with only minimal divergences.  He 
underscored the utility of floating the draft resolution as a 
kind of marker for orienting the continuing debate on reform, 
but he advised against calling a vote at the present moment. 
He remarked that the French mission reports that the 
atmosphere at the General Assembly (GA) appears to have taken 
a turn for the better, that GA President Eliasson was making 
moves in the right direction, and that many G-77 members were 
now ready to engage on reform.  Lacroix averred that the 
budget cap had served its purpose by provoking a healthy 
crisis in order to relaunch the debate on reform.  The French 
MFA now favors lifting the budget cap by consensus, with U.S. 
and UK support. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment and Biographical Note:  Lacroix heads to 
New York in August as the new French Deputy Permanent 
Representative.  Embassy has found him a constructive, 
accessible and collected interlocutor, authoritative and 
unerring in his presentation of French policy positions, 
extremely knowledgeable about the UN, and non-polemical in 
his approach to Embassy interlocutors.
