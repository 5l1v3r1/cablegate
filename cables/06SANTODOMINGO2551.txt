REF: STATE 128442 
 
On August 8, poloff delivered reftel talking points to 
Ambassador for UN and OAS Affairs Michelle Cohen.  Cohen 
reflected on the August 4 meeting of UNSG Kofi Annan and 
President Leonel Fernandez, during which Fernandez condemned 
without distinction Israeli attacks in the city of Qana and 
Hizbollah rocket attacks into northern Israel.  She then 
suggested, as did Fernandez earlier, that multi-lateral 
organizations in general and the United Nations in particular 
would prove key to terminating the current conflict.  Cohen 
noted that the Dominican government was supportive of an 
immediate ceasefire, but withheld comment on the specific 
resolution as relayed in reftel, noting instead that it would 
be passed upwards in the MFA for analysis and discussion. 
Post will advise of any further substantive comment.
