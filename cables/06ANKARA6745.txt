 (SBU) Embassy Baghdad has confirmed that no Iraqis are able 
to participate and at this time IRMO is unable to fund Iraqi 
participation for the proposed launching of the Iraqi Gas 
Working Group in Ankara on January 11.  Therefore we 
recommend that the January 11 meeting be postponed to a later 
date when appropriate Iraqi participation can be assured. 
Turkish Energy Minister Guler asked us to consider launching 
a U.S.-Turkey-Iraq meeting on Iraqi gas related to 
facilitating transit of Caspian and other gas supplies to 
Europe.  Guler agreed to postpone the proposed meeting until 
the most productive date.  We propose to work with Baghdad 
and the Department in January to reschedule a launch meeting 
for this process for assessing and facilitating development 
of Iraqi gas for domestic use and export.
