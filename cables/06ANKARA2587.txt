In Today's Papers 
 
Larijani Holds Talks in Ankara 
All papers:  On Monday, visiting Iranian national security 
advisor and chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani met with 
Prime Minister Erdogan, Foreign Minister Gul, and National 
Security Council (MGK) Secretary-General Alpogan.  Following 
his meetings, Larijani told the press the US was not honest 
with Turkey regarding the anti-terror fight against the PKK, 
claiming US officials have been holding talks with PKK 
officials in Mosul and Kirkuk.  Vatan reports the US Embassy 
rejected the claims, saying the US would never engage in 
talks with the PKK or any terrorist organization.  Larijani 
proposed cooperation among Turkey, Iran and Syria to fight 
against the PKK.  In an interview with the all-news 
broadcaster NTV, Larijani underlined the importance of the 
letter sent by Iranian President Ahmadinejad to President 
Bush, one which could reduce the tension surrounding the 
issue.  "Iran is not like Iraq," Larijani said, warning that 
a US attack would be a big mistake.  He called on Turkey to 
resist efforts of Western countries to deprive Muslim 
countries of nuclear technology.  Larijani also noted that 
Iran had been striving for six months to discuss the issue 
of Iraq with the US. 
 
Ankara warned Larijani to "remember the Iraq example," 
urging him to take into account world reactions and 
cooperate with the international community.  Ankara also 
said Iranian statements against Israel further deteriorated 
the image of Tehran. "How can you convince others that Iran 
has peaceful purposes when you have not been able to 
convince the head of the IAEA, al-Baradei?  The world has 
formed a united bloc against Iran, and Turkey will move 
together with the international community.  Iran should not 
rely merely on Russia and China while making evaluations," 
Ankara reportedly told Larijani.  Papers say Larijani 
signaled that Iran was ready to sit at the table with the US 
to resolve the nuclear crisis, and that he asked Turkey to 
mediate between Iran and the West by explaining Iranian 
positions.  Papers say Ankara turned down the proposal. 
 
In a move seen by the papers as a US response to the visit 
of Larijani to Ankara, Ambassador Gregory Schulte briefed 
Turkish reporters from Vienna through a digital video 
conference held by the US Embassy.  Schulte said the visit 
of Larijani to Turkey was an attempt to break the 
international consensus against Iran's nuclear program. 
Turkey supports the international consensus against Iranian 
nuclear aspirations, Schulte said, adding that Iran would 
pose a big threat for the Middle East if it produced nuclear 
weapons. 
 
A delegation of US Congressmen met Foreign Minister Gul and 
MGK Secretary General Alpogan on Monday, urging the Turks 
not to issue messages that would encourage Larijani.  Gul 
told the Congressmen Turkey did not want a new crisis in the 
region, assuring them strong messages urging for 
transparency were conveyed to Larijani. 
 
US Abandons Plans of Military Presence in Black Sea 
Washington has canceled plans for extending the NATO-led 
Mediterranean mission Operation Active Endeavor into the 
Black Sea, Sabah and Yeni Safak report.  Secretary Rice told 
Ankara during a recent visit that the US abandoned its plan 
to deploy vessels into the Black Sea to prevent arms and 
human trafficking and to enhance security in the region. 
 
Commenting on the balance of power in the region, Erdal 
Safak notes in Sabah that Russian leader Putin has developed 
a new doctrine: "using the power that comes with possessing 
 
ANKARA 00002587  002 OF 003 
 
 
huge amounts of oil and natural gas to be a superpower 
again." Safak believes that the US has developed a policy to 
counter that doctrine with three primary goals:  "First, the 
US aims to establish bases in the former East block 
countries, an aim which has largely been achieved. 
Secondly, the US has looked for ways to divert Caucasus and 
Asian energy resources to European destinations in order to 
minimize Russian influence. This has also been achieved to a 
great extend.   The third goal is to gain control over 
Russian energy routes which calls for gaining control of the 
Black Sea.  The US proposed that Turkey expand NATO missions 
in the Black Sea, using fighting human trafficking and 
terrorism as pretexts for the expansion.  Turkey kept a 
significant distance from this proposal because of concerns 
about possible violation of the Montreaux Treaty.  Now the 
US has withdrawn its proposal so the undeclared cold war 
between the two allies regarding the Black Sea has ended. 
However this does not necessarily mean all is well and the 
Black Sea debate is over; there will be new tactics to gain 
control of the Black Sea corridor." 
 
Turkey Recalls Ambassadors to Paris, Ottawa over Armenian 
Genocide Bill 
All papers:  Foreign Ministry spokesman Namik Tan stated 
yesterday that both Turkish Ambassador to France Osman 
Koruturk and Turkish Ambassador to Canada Aydemir Erman have 
been recalled for consultations concerning the French 
Parliament's possible approval of the Armenian bill and 
Canada's move to recognize the 1915 events as "genocide." 
The two Ambassadors are expected to return to their posts 
after the consultations, Tan added.  Vatan quotes the 
chairman of the Parliament's Foreign Relations Committee 
Mehmet Dulger as saying, "If the bill is approved by the 
French Parliament, Turkey will consider applying sanctions 
to French companies and goods." 
 
Livni to Visit Turkey, Sezer to Israel 
Cumhuriyet reports Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni will 
visit Turkey in the third week of May to discuss Hamas and 
the role of Turkey in the region.  President Sezer is 
expected to pay a state visit to Israel on June 7.  Sources 
said the visit of Livni before Sezer's trip to Israel will 
help the efforts for a total normalization of bilateral 
ties. 
 
Greek EFG Purchases 70 percent of Tekfenbank 
Vatan, Sabah, Referans, Dunya and others:  The Greek EFG 
Eurobank purchased 70 percent of Turkish Tekfenbank shares 
at a price of $182 million.  According to the agreement 
signed by the two banks, Eurobank EFG will purchase 70 
percent of Tekfenbank shares together with Tekfen financial 
leasing owned by Tekfen group.  Tekfen group will keep the 
remaining shares and continue with its strategic partnership 
in the bank. 
 
"Dangerous Developments" In Iraq 
Columnist Gunduz Aktan observed in Radikal: "A US Senator 
and an American foreign policy analyst held up Bosnia- 
Herzegovina as a model for the future of Iraq.  In a recent 
article they suggested that Iraq be divided into three 
regions in a loose federation.  Given such statements, it is 
hard to believe America is sincere in its efforts to bring 
democracy to the region.  If those suggestions prove true, 
US prestige will experience a serious blow, making true all 
the speculation that the real US goal is to divide Iraq and 
control Kirkuk oil.  Even more seriously, such a development 
will enhance the hand of those who have been saying that the 
US is acting with anti-Islam motivations.  The Turkish 
parliament rejected the March 1 motion despite all its 
consequences and the consequences are now becoming obvious."
