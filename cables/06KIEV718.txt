¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) EUR/ACE FSA Director in December 2005 advised GUAM 
Embassy representatives that the USG would not wish to 
continue funding the U.S.-GUAM framework project or 
supporting GUAM Secretariat development unless member states 
themselves funded the GUAM Information Center.  As a 
follow-up and in consultation with Embassies Chisinau, Baku 
and Tbilisi (ref A), we recommend the Department instruct 
Embassies Kiev, Tbilisi, Baku, and Chisinau to deliver a 
demarche (proposed text in para 3) calling upon host 
governments to show tangible commitment to the success of 
GUAM, including by paying 2005 dues to the GUAM Information 
Center budget. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Begin text of proposed talking points: 
 
-- The U.S. Government welcomed the principles espoused by 
GUAM in the April 22, 2005 Chisinau Declaration and the 
commitment by member states to put into practice these 
principles through the activities of GUAM.  Therefore, the 
U.S. Government has for a second year agreed to fund 
U.S.-GUAM Framework projects. 
 
-- However, for the U.S. Government to remain committed to 
providing in excess of one million dollars for such projects, 
it must see a tangible commitment to the organization by 
member states. 
 
-- GUAM members agreed at the April 2005 Chisinau Summit that 
GUAM needed to establish a GUAM Information Center as a 
necessary beginning to enhance GUAM's operational 
effectiveness.  We share this view and applaud the Government 
of Ukraine for paying in December its dues of $21,000 to the 
Center's budget.  We also welcome the Government of Ukraine's 
commitment to identify a permanent facility for the GUAM 
Information Center in Kiev and urge it to conclude this 
process as quickly as possible. 
 
-- The Government of the United States strongly urges the 
Governments of Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan to pay 
expeditiously their 2005 dues to the GUAM Information Center 
budget. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action request:  Please advise regarding 
above-recommended demarche.
