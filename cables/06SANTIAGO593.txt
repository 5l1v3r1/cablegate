SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ 
 
¶1. On March 20, all stations featured stories regarding the third 
anniversary of the invasion of Iraq.  Quotes: 
 
¶2. Private Megavision's pundit Libardo Buitrago said: 
 
"The invasion of Iraq is far from achieving the objectives set by 
President George Bush.  First, it did not demonstrate that Iraq and 
Saddam were a real threat to the security of Iraq's neighbors or the 
U.S.; second, neither weapons of mass destruction nor evidence that 
Hussein actually had had them were found; and third, it did not 
prove Saddam had ties with international terrorism, particularly 
with Al Qaeda.  However, one can point out that the Iraqis had their 
first democratic elections, President Bush's most important argument 
to justify an incursion in Iraq...  Since the beginning for the war, 
more than 100,000 civilians have died and 200,000 have been wounded. 
 For the U.S. the conflict has signified an expenditure of more than 
USD 300 billion and 2,300 U.S. dead soldiers....  Three years later, 
the allies face the worst scenario--a civil war over power between 
Sunni and Shiite religious groups that threatens to last for many 
years.  Despite this, President Bush assured today that the U.S. 
would remain in Iraq until Iraq's reconstruction is complete.  Even 
amidst worldwide criticism (of the U.S.), the comments of Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez'-in which he called Bush genocidal, drunk and 
thick headed (burro)-are surprising.  Bush has yet to respond but 
did defend the occupation of Iraq, arguing that Iraq's inhabitants 
have more freedom and that Hussein must face justice for the crimes 
committed under his rule." 
 
¶3. Private Chilevision: 
 
"Iraq remembers today the third anniversary of the war initiated by 
the U.S.  Although Hussein's dictatorship is over, the Iraqis live 
with insecurity, sectarianism and political crisis that has delayed 
the creation of an autonomous government in Iraq." 
 
¶4. Conservative Channel 13: 
 
"Criticism against the invasion of Iraq has grown with the years. 
Although it was supposed to liberate Iraq, in reality it maintains 
Iraqis in total chaos and on the brink of civil war....  There is 
pressure from the U.S. people to withdraw troops from Iraq....  In 
terms of security, infrastructure and peace efforts, the operation 
has been a total failure."
