In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan on the PKK Terror, Meeting with Bush 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan told his party group 
meeting Tuesday that Turkey, facing the PKK terrorism, would use its 
rights stemming from international law. 
Erdogan said Barzani was harboring terrorists and that international 
law has clearly outlined the response to such acts.  He added that 
Turkey would make the necessary assessments before taking "a real 
effective step" forward in order to crush terror. 
 
Papers highlight Prime Minister Erdogan as stressing that in his 
November 5 meeting with President Bush, he will ask for a "roadmap" 
with regard to the fight against the PKK terror.  Erdogan said the 
US has acknowledged that the terrorists have US-made weapons, and 
that he will raise such issues during his meeting with President 
Bush.  He noted Turkey would discuss its problems with other 
countries, and if they remain silent, it would "move alone."  Papers 
note Erdogan will make clear in the US that the fate of the region 
and bilateral ties depend on "the PKK test."  Papers also expect 
Erdogan to ask Bush to help cut the money gained from drug smuggling 
from going to the PKK. 
 
Editorial Commentary on the Upcoming Bush-Erdogan Meeting 
Yilmaz Oztuna commented in the conservative daily Turkiye (10/31): 
"The visit of PM Erdogan to Washington on November 5 is very 
important.  Erdogan will clearly ask President Bush about stopping 
the PKK in Iraq.  Yet it seems like President Bush, in response, 
will continue to play with words without presenting any tangible 
action plan.  In fact, this is the worst case scenario: President 
Bush talking about PKK, labeling it as a terrorist organization and 
advising us to be patient.  This will be an obvious effort to stall 
Turkey." 
 
Murat Yetkin observed in the liberal-intellectual daily Radikal 
(10/31):  "Given the current developments vis-`-vis Northern Iraq, 
the PKK, the US and Turkey, there are many questions that come to 
one's mind.  Barzani seems to be playing with fire as he tries to 
bargain with Turkey through a terrorist organization.  The visit of 
Secretary Rice is very important to show the US's view of Turkey as 
 
SIPDIS 
its strategic partner.  When I asked PM Erdogan whether he received 
a call from Secretary Rice recently, he said he did not.  When I 
pressed him with more follow up questions, he said, 'we are going to 
the US anyway.'  Does this mean PM Erdogan has already given up hope 
from Secretary Rice visit?  Something is clear that given his party 
group remarks, Erdogan gave enough indication that the relations 
will be at a cutting-off point if he cannot get he wants during his 
meeting with President Bush on November 5." 
 
President Gul on the Kurds-US-Turkey 
All papers report that President Abdullah Gul, in a reception 
marking the Turkish National Day in the presidential palace Tuesday, 
said the US should support Turkey's fight against terror.  "This is 
not a favor, but a responsibility of the US," Gul said.  The 
President also recalled that Turkey was the leading investor in 
northern Iraq, noting, "The Iraqi Kurds are relatives of the Turks; 
we have always kept our doors open for them in times of distress. 
The terror organization, however, harms the good ties between Turkey 
and the Iraqi Kurds."  Gul warned that the US would sooner or later 
leave the region, while Turkey will always stay here. 
 
DTP is Asking for Autonomy 
All papers:  Mainly Kurdish party DTP held a convention in 
Diyarbakir with a theme of Democratic Society.  The final 
declaration issued after the convention noted that the centralized 
nation-state system created major imbalances and that rather than 
Republic, it caused an oligarchic structure.  The declaration said 
"we want democratic autonomy in which every region will have its own 
color and symbol".  It noted that every region should have its own 
parliament and referred jailed PKK leader Ocalan as the "leader of 
 
ANKARA 00002684  002 OF 003 
 
 
the Kurdish people".  It also urged Ocalan be transferred to a 
prison other than Imrali.  On the citizenship issue, declaration 
said that the term "Turk" should be replaced by "from Turkey". 
Papers report that Diyarbakir State Prosecutor initiated an 
investigation against the DTP for referring jailed PKK leader Ocalan 
as "the leader of the Kurdish people" in its declaration. 
 
A Joint Message to the US from Barzani and Talabani 
Milliyet, Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Radikal and others:  KDP and PUK 
officials met in Northern Iraq under Barzani.  The joint statement, 
issued after the meeting, said that they do not support the PKK and 
added that they are ready to take necessary measures along the 
border, together with the Iraqi central government and the US, in 
order to prevent all kinds of activities that would endanger the 
security of their neighbors.  In an interview with Milliyet , Iraqi 
President Talabani said that PKK is betraying the Kurdish cause and 
hurting both Turks, Kurds and DTP.  He referred to PKK's acts as 
terrorist acts and noted that it should either lay down weapons as a 
whole or declare unconditional open ended ceasefire. 
 
EU Commission's Draft Turkey Report 
Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report the EU 
Commission's draft Turkey report criticizes Ankara for failing to 
implement the EU customs union protocol in a way to cover Greek 
Cyprus, and for doing nothing for the normalization of ties with the 
southern part of Cyprus.  The report also draws attention to the 
strains between Turkey and the Greek Cypriots with regard to oil 
exploration rights in the Eastern Mediterranean. 
 
The report evaluates in detail the April 27 memorandum by the 
Turkish military, criticizing the army for its involvement in 
politics.  The report praises the government for solving the 
presidential crisis in Turkey within the framework of democracy.  It 
lauds the economic performance of Turkey while criticizing about 
article 301 of the penal code, incidents of torture, the Kurdish 
question and the high election threshold.
