SUBJECT: BRV DEPLOYMENT CONTINUES TO CREEP FORWARD 
 
REF: CARACAS 308 
 
Classified By: Robert Downes, Political Counselor, 
for Reason 1.4(d) 
 
¶1. (S) SUMMARY: The deployment of Venezuelan troops to the 
areas near the border of Colombia continues with some 
movement being reported in local press at Fuerte Paramaracay 
in Valencia and Fuerte Mara in the border state of Zulia. 
This included, for the first time, reports of helicopter 
movements.  There is no indication of the activation of any 
new units and the 42 Parachute Brigade still appears to 
remain in garrison.  Available open source and sensitive 
reporting does not support the BRV's claims of 9,000 troops. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
Getting a Lift 
-------------- 
¶2. (S) Local press observed five heavy equipment transports 
(HETs) entering Fuerte Paramaracay in Valencia, home of the 
41st Armored Brigade on the morning of March 5.  Although 
they were not seen leaving, earlier photographs show that the 
HETs are capable of carrying either one AMX-30 main battle 
tank or two AMX-13 light tanks configured as armored fighting 
vehicles (AFVs).  This would concur with other sensitive 
reporting that showed seven AFVs awaiting transport in 
Valencia.   The press also reported and photographed a 
helicopter (possibly an MI-17 HIP or an MI-26 HALO) making 
two brief landings, presumably to pick up troops or command 
elements on March 5. 
 
Front Pages From the Front 
-------------------------- 
¶3. (S) Regional newspapers from the border state of Zulia ran 
photographs of a military column (presumably from the 1st 
Division in Fuerte Mara) made up of olive drab buses and 
trucks.  The front page also carried a photograph of an MI-25 
HIND gunship circling the highway interchange near La Chinita 
airport, which confirms sensitive reporting of a HIND. A 
contact at La Chinita airport told PolOff that the Venezuelan 
Air Force was paying to fuel the helicopters and not 
commandeering supplies. 
 
¶4.  (C)  COMMENT:  Although not every troop movement can 
expect to be reported in the open press, available open 
source and sensitive reporting does not support the BRV's 
claims of 9,000 troops.  END COMMENT.
