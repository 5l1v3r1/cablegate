¶1.  (U)  In a verdict announced December 27, 30 of the 37 
Peninsula Lions defendants were convicted of murder, 
attempted assassinations and other terror related crimes. The 
decision was first read to the defense lawyers in a closed 
court session, followed by an announcement to court observers 
outside the courtroom.  No defendants were present.  Six of 
the defendants received the death penalty, one received life 
plus three years (life equates to twenty years in prison), 
seven were acquitted, three received suspended sentences, and 
20 received sentences ranging from four months to fifteen 
years in jail.  All of the verdicts are expected to be 
appealed by either the defense or prosecution or both. 
(Note: Under Kuwaiti law, both defendants and prosecutors 
have the right of appeal, initially to the Court of Appeals 
and subsequently to the Court of Cassation.  The appeal 
process can take up to two years to complete.  End Note.) 
 
¶2.  (U)  The charge sheet for the 37 defendants listed 35 
separate charges including four counts of murder of Kuwait 
security forces, planning the assassination of Kuwait State 
Security (KSS) and Ministry of Interior (MOI) officials for 
the purpose of creating chaos, collaborating to commit 
terrorism, planning the murder of military personnel of 
friendly forces in Kuwait, exhorting others to join illegal 
organizations, calling for a fight against state authorities, 
carrying out hostile actions against the state's interests, 
funding terrorist groups through charitable donations, 
issuing fatwas to help facilitate hostile acts, possessing 
unlicensed firearms and ammunition, and manufacturing 
explosives.
