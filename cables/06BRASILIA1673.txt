¶1.  Retransmitting with corrected subject line. 
 
¶2.  Brazil will not vote for Ruth Wedgewood for re-election 
to the United Nations Human Rights Committee.  We spoke with 
Marcia Adorno, chief of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry's 
Human Rights Division on August 14.  Adorno told us Brazil 
has recently traded votes on two other UN issues, the 
Committee on Racial Discrimination and the Human Rights 
Council, and has no more uncommitted votes.  (In both cases 
Brazil was elected to positions it sought.)    Adorno told us 
she had reviewed Wedgewood's resume and thought it was 
excellent, but Brazil will not able to vote for her.
