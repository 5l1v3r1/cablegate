SUBJECT: BULGARIA NOTIFIED OF U.S. DESIGNATION OF IRAN'S 
DEFENSE INDUSTRIES ORGANIZATION UNDER E.O. 13382 
 
REF: SECSTATE 40909 
 
(U) We delivered reftel nonpaper on 02 April 2007 to the 
Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Iran Desk Officer, Mr. 
Oleg Doichinov.  We also delivered to Dr. Vasil Kirov, 
Director of the Bulgarian Financial Intelligence Agency 
(FIA).  Although neither had any substantive or immediate 
response to the information, we are confident that the 
Government of Bulgaria will notify the USG of any business or 
financial links uncovered with Iran's Defense Industries 
Organization (DIO) due to both the USG's designation and the 
UN's previous designation of DIO under UNSCR 1737.
