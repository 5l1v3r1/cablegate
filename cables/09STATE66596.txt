SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - YEMEN 
 
¶1.  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the 
high security threat level in Yemen due to terrorist 
activities.  The Department recommends that American 
citizens defer non-essential travel to Yemen. 
American citizens remaining in Yemen despite this 
warning should monitor the U.S. Embassy website and 
should make contingency emergency plans.  This 
replaces the Travel Warning for Yemen issued April 24, 
2009, to update information on attacks against 
foreigners in the Northern governorate of Saada. 
 
¶2.  The security threat level remains high due to 
terrorist activities in Yemen.  On the morning of 
September 17, 2008 armed terrorists attacked the U.S. 
Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen.  A number of explosions 
occurred in the vicinity of the Embassy's main gate. 
Several Yemeni security personnel and one Embassy 
security guard were killed, as were a few individuals 
waiting to gain entry to the Embassy, one of whom was 
a U.S. citizen. 
 
¶3.  U.S. Embassy employees have been advised to 
exercise caution when choosing restaurants, hotels or 
visiting tourist areas in Sanaa in order to avoid 
large gatherings of foreigners and expatriates.  Only 
limited travel outside of the capital is authorized at 
this time. 
 
¶4.  U.S. citizens who travel to or remain in Yemen 
despite this warning should exercise caution and take 
prudent security measures, including maintaining a 
high level of vigilance, avoiding crowds and 
demonstrations, keeping a low profile, varying times 
and routes for all travel, and ensuring travel 
documents are current.  American citizens in Yemen are 
advised to exercise particular caution at locations 
frequented by foreigners countrywide, including 
restaurants and hotels frequented by expatriates. 
From time to time, the Embassy may restrict official 
Americans from restaurants, hotels, or shopping areas. 
The Department of State strongly encourages American 
citizens to consult the most recent Warden Messages on 
the U.S. Embassy Website to get up-to-date information 
on security conditions.  Americans who believe they 
are being followed or threatened while driving in 
urban centers should proceed as quickly as possible to 
the nearest police station or major intersection and 
request assistance from the officers in the blue-and- 
white police cars stationed there. 
 
¶5.  The Department remains concerned about possible 
attacks by extremist individuals or groups against 
U.S. citizens, facilities, businesses, and perceived 
interests.  On March 15, 2009, four South Korean 
tourists were killed in a suicide bomb attack in the 
city of Shibam in southern Hadramout province.  On 
March 18, 2009, a South Korean motorcade was attacked 
by a suicide bomber near Sana'a International Airport. 
On January 17, 2008, suspected al-Qa-ida operatives 
ambushed a tourist convoy in the eastern Hadramout 
Governorate, killing two Belgians.  On July 2, 2007, 
suspected al-Qa-ida operatives carried out a vehicle- 
borne explosive device attack on tourists at the 
Belquis Temple in Marib, which resulted in the deaths 
of eight Spanish tourists and two Yemenis.  The 
targeting of tourist sites by al-Qa-ida may represent 
an escalation in terror tactics in Yemen.  On February 
3, 2006, 23 convicts, including known affiliates of 
al-Qa-ida, escaped from a high-security prison in 
Sanaa, some of whom remain at large.  Two of the 
escapees were killed in vehicle-based suicide attacks 
on oil facilities near Mukalla and Marib on September 
 
STATE 00066596  002 OF 002 
 
 
15, 2006.  Those attacks were followed by the arrest 
the next day in Sanaa of four suspected al Qa-ida 
operatives, who had stockpiled explosives and weapons. 
 
¶6.  The Government of Yemen has been battling al 
Houthi rebels in and around the northern governorate 
of Saada intermittently since 2004. In June 2009, a 
group of foreigners was attacked in Saada, resulting 
in three confirmed deaths.  There have been no claims 
of responsibility in this incident and the 
investigation is ongoing. 
 
¶7.  U.S. citizens traveling in Yemen should be aware 
that local authorities occasionally place restrictions 
on the travel of foreigners to parts of the country 
experiencing unrest.  In addition, the U.S. Embassy 
itself often restricts travel of official personnel to 
the tribal areas north and east of Sanaa, such as the 
governorates of Amran, Al Jawf, Hajja, Marib, Saada, 
and Shabwa.  Travelers should be in contact with the 
Embassy for up-to-date information on such 
restrictions. 
 
¶8.  Travel by boat through the Red Sea or near the 
Socotra Islands in the Gulf of Aden presents the risk 
of pirate attacks. Since the beginning of 2009, 40 
vessels reportedly have been attacked and 23 vessels 
seized in the area.  In some cases, crew members were 
held for ransom.  Following the April 2009 hijacking 
of a U.S. cargo vessel and the subsequent rescue of 
the vessel's captain, resulting in the deaths of three 
pirates, Somali pirates threatened to retaliate 
against American citizens transiting the region.  The 
threat of piracy extends into the Indian Ocean off the 
coast of the Horn of Africa as well. See our 
International Maritime Piracy Fact Sheet.  If travel 
to any of these areas is unavoidable, travelers may 
reduce the risk to personal security if such travel is 
undertaken by air or with an armed escort provided by 
a local tour company. 
 
¶9.  U.S. citizens should register at the Consular 
Section of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa and enroll in the 
warden system (emergency alert network) to obtain 
updated information on travel and security in Yemen. 
This can be done online prior to arrival in Yemen at 
the State Department's registration web page. 
 
¶10.  The U.S. Embassy is located at Dhahr Himyar Zone, 
Sheraton Hotel District, P.O. Box 22347.  The 
telephone number of the Consular Section is (967) (1) 
755-2000, extension 2153 or 2266.  The fax number is 
(967) (1) 303-175.  The after-hours emergency number 
is (967) (1) 755-2000 (press zero for extension) or 
(967) 733213509.  From time to time the Embassy may 
temporarily close or suspend public services for 
security reasons.  Emergency assistance to U.S. 
citizens during non-business hours (or when public 
access is restricted) is available through Embassy 
duty personnel. 
 
¶11.  Current information on travel and security in Yemen 
may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 
1-888-407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, 
from outside the United States and Canada, 1-202-501- 
¶4444.  These numbers are available from 8:00 am to 8:00 
pm Eastern Time Monday through Friday (except U.S. 
federal holidays.)  U.S. citizens should consult the 
Country Specific Information for Yemen and the Worldwide 
Caution on the State Department's Internet site.  Up-to- 
date information on security conditions can also be 
viewed at the U.S. Embassy Sanaa's American Citizens 
Services web page. 
 
 
¶12.  Minimize considered.
