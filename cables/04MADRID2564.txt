ON APPLICATIONS 05-915569 AND 05-906385 
 
REF: STATE 068312 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We contacted Deputy Director General Angel Menendez 
Nava in the Office of International Relations at the Ministry 
of Defense to verify the legitimacy of licenses 05-9155569 
and 05-9076385 between Eurocopter-France and the Spanish Air 
Force.  In a letter to the Embassy, Menendez confirmed that 
the Spanish Air Force does have a contract with Eurocopter to 
procure communication equipment and radar system components 
for their 532 Cougar Helicopters cited reftel.  Menendez also 
verified that the equipment will be used exclusively by the 
Spanish Air Force and will not be resold.  The Spanish Air 
Force has had contracts with Eurocopter-France to supply 
various spare parts for the last twenty years, according to 
Menendez. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Eurocopter-France appears to be a legitimate 
supplier to the Spanish Air Force.
