¶1. (SBU) On Thursday, 16 June 2005 at approximately 1300 
hours (Local), an improvised explosive device (IED) exploded 
near the Justice and Development Party (AKP) office in the 
Altindag district of Ankara, Turkey.  The Turkish National 
Police (TNP) described the IED as a sound bomb.  There were 
no injuries reported.  Another IED was discovered at 
approximately the same time at the AKP office in the Cankaya 
district of Ankara.  This device, also a sound bomb, was 
detonated by the TNP's EOD team without injury.  The TNP 
believe that the Marxist Leninist Communist Party (MLKP), a 
left-wing indigenous terrorist organization, is responsible 
for both sound bombs.  Neither U.S. Government, nor western 
interests, appear to have been targeted.
