¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on

¶2. (U) During the April 8-15, 2008 reporting period, two security 
officials, one a village guard, were injured in clashes with the 
PKK.  The total number of security force casualties for the year 
through April 15, 2008 was 24 killed and 28 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, 14 PKK terrorists were killed, three 
were captured, and six surrendered.  According to official TGS 
website figures, through the second week of April, the number of PKK 
militants killed this year was 307, the number of those captured was 
83, and the number of those who surrendered was 49. 
 
¶4. (U) Another of the demonstrators who was injured during the March
