SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT - ZIMBABWE 
 
¶1.  This Travel Alert updates safety and security concerns 
in Zimbabwe, advises U.S. citizens to consider relocating 
if necessary to ensure their security during the upcoming 
election period, and continues to recommend deferral of all 
non-essential travel to Zimbabwe at this time.  This 
supersedes the Travel Alert for Zimbabwe dated May 14, 2008 
and expires on August 1, 2008. 
 
¶2.  U.S. citizens should defer non-essential travel to 
Zimbabwe.  U.S. citizens resident in Zimbabwe, particularly 
in rural areas, should carefully review their personal 
circumstances and consider moving to a more secure location 
in advance of, and immediately following, the June 27 
runoff of the presidential elections between President 
Robert Mugabe and Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) 
candidate Morgan Tsvangirai.  Since the March 29 general 
election, Zimbabwean security forces, including some 
military and police, as well as so-called war veterans, 
have created a climate of intimidation and fear across the 
country, particularly in rural areas and high-density 
suburbs.  There have been numerous and widespread attacks 
on opposition supporters, renewed farm invasions, and 
arrests and beatings of election officials accused of vote 
tampering.  There is a continued risk of arbitrary 
detention or arrest. 
 
¶3.  Americans should be particularly cautious when using 
still, video or telephone cameras in any urban setting, or 
in the vicinity of any political activity, as this could be 
construed by Zimbabwean authorities as presenting oneself 
as an accredited journalist, a crime punishable by arrest, 
incarceration and/or deportation. 
 
¶4.  American citizens traveling to or resident in Zimbabwe 
should register with the U.S. Embassy by completing a 
registration form online at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  Registration enables 
the Embassy to contact American citizens in case of 
emergency and provide updates on the security situation. 
 
¶5.  As the Department of State continues to develop 
information on any potential security threats to U.S. 
citizens overseas, it shares credible threat information 
through its consular information program documents, 
available on the Internet at http://travel.state.gov.  In 
addition to information on the Internet, travelers may 
obtain up-to-date information on security conditions by 
calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the U.S. or outside the 
U.S. and Canada on a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444. 
 
¶6.  Minimize considered.
