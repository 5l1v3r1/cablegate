REF: JAKARTA 378 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  This message updates the 2009 Indonesia 
Anti-Trafficking in Persons Report, providing updated law 
enforcement data for 2008.  This data documents sharp 
increases in arrest, prosecution and conviction of 
traffickers for the third year in a row.  Lengths of 
sentences also increased. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SUMMARY (Con'd):  Both in terms of percentage 
increases and gross numbers these latest figures prove that 
Indonesian success in imprisoning traffickers continued to 
improve dramatically after passage of the tough new 
anti-trafficking law in 2007.  Because of robust law 
enforcement and other accomplishments in protection and 
prevention outlined in reftel, Indonesia belongs at Tier 2 
status for 2009.  END SUMMARY. 
 
UPDATED DATA ON TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (TIP) 
 
¶4.  (U) Mission recently received updated data on 
prosecutions and convictions of traffickers from Indonesia's 
Attorney General's Office and local law enforcement agencies. 
 This data was not yet available when we submitted reftel 
report.  The new data documents steep increases in arrest, 
prosecution and conviction of traffickers in 2008 compared 
with 2007 along with an increase in average length of 
sentences.  The metrics follow: 
 
--Arrests increased 15% from 252 to 291. 
--Prosecutions increased 18% from 109 to 129. 
--Convictions increased 19% from 46 to 55. 
--Average length of sentences increased 4% from 45 months to 
47 months. 
 
¶5.  (U) The new March 2007 anti-trafficking law was used 
vigorously in 2008 despite a lagtime used to pass 
implementing regulations and for cases prosecuted under the 
new law to move their way through the judicial system.  The 
new law was used in 64 prosecutions in 2008 and 12 
convictions.  (Note:  Many of the cases which did not use the 
new law originated before the law was passed.) 
 
OTHER SIGNIFICANT STRIDES 
 
¶6.  (SBU) As outlined in reftel, the GOI made other 
significant strides in fighting trafficking in 2008, 
including: 
 
--A special new anti-trafficking unit set up by Jakarta 
police which shut down large trafficking syndicates. 
--Closure by the Manpower Ministry of nine labor recruitment 
agencies because of involvement in trafficking. 
--A national joint police operation across 11 provinces (one 
third of the nation) to rescue women and children from sexual 
exploitation, resulting in hundreds of victims rescued and 
dozens of traffickers arrested. 
--Establishment of 305 district-level women's help desks to 
assist women and children trafficking victims, and 41 
Integrated Service Centers.  These facilities aim to provide 
a full range of services for victims. 
--Extensive GOI outreach in all 33 provinces to educate local 
citizens on the new anti-trafficking law and establish local 
anti-trafficking task forces. 
--Arrest for trafficking-related offenses of local government 
officials, immigration officials, and senior diplomats, 
including a former Ambassador to Malaysia. 
 
INDONESIA MERITS TIER 2 STATUS 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The GOI made big strides in 2008 in fighting 
trafficking due in large part to widespread awareness of the 
problem and strong political will.  Indonesia has 
demonstrated it belongs in Tier 2 because of this progress. 
We will focus efforts and work closely with the GOI to 
address the weaknesses noted in reftel.
