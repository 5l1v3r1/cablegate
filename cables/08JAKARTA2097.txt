SUBJECT: FIRST CONVICTION OF TIGER TRAFFICKER IN NORTH SUMATRA 
 
REF: JAKARTA 1136 
 
¶1.  Summary. A trafficker arrested in June 2008 and charged with 
trafficking two endangered Sumatran tiger cubs was sentenced to 2 
years and 10 months in prison and a fine of IDR 1 million ($100) by 
the district court in Medan on November 4. The case represents the 
first time that an animal trafficker was convicted and sentenced in 
Medan, North Sumatra, long known as a gateway city for trafficking 
in illegal wildlife. Despite the relatively light penalty, 
conservation NGOs and local authorities involved in the arrest are 
encouraged by the conviction and sentence. Several other 
prosecutions of Sumatran tiger traffickers are pending in Medan. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  In June of 2008 provincial North Sumatran Natural Resource 
Conservation Agency (BKSDA) authorities used a successful undercover 
operation in conjunction with police to arrest a wildlife trafficker 
attempting to sell two Sumatran tiger cubs for IDR 15 million 
($1500) each near the provincial capital of Medan (reftel). The 
tiger cubs are suspected by BKSDA to have been trafficked from 
inside Gunung Leuseur National Park in northern Sumatra. Tips from 
locals helped BKSDA identify the trafficker and set up the sting 
operation. 
 
¶3.  This represents the first prosecution and conviction of a tiger 
trafficker in North Sumatra. Prosecutors initially asked for a 3 
year sentence. The trafficker, Denti Halawa (31), was sentenced to 2 
years and 10 months with a fine of IDR 1 million ($100). BKSDA 
officials, while welcoming the verdict, noted that in a previous 
case for trafficking involving a scaly anteater, an IDR 5 million 
($500) fine was levied and that the fine should be comparable to the 
market price of the animals to be trafficked. In a press release on 
the case, the Wildlife Conservation Society of Indonesia (WCS) and 
BKSA said that they believed the verdict would help deter future 
trafficking. The local NGO Forum Harimau Kita (Forum for Our Tigers) 
added that Medan was a known gateway for animal smuggling and the 
center of the illegal wildlife trade for Sumatran tigers. While 
welcoming the prosecution and the efforts of local officials, Forum 
Harimau Kita called for increased efforts to eliminate the illegal 
wildlife market in Medan. According to BKSA there are currently two 
additional ongoing police investigations against tiger traffickers 
in North Sumatra.
