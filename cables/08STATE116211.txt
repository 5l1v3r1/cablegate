Maura, 
 
I want to thank you and the Embassy Damascus team for your 
extraordinary work during these challenging days.  The 
Mission's professionalism and dedication throughout this 
stressful and dynamic period have been truly outstanding. 
I specifically want to acknowledge Embassy reporting which 
captured events as they unfolded on the ground; Post's 
detailed responses to questions about the American Cultural 
Center, the American Language Center, and the Damascus 
Community School; and Post's efforts to assist American 
citizens, especially as anti-American rhetoric increased on 
the Syrian street.  Embassy Damascus' efforts to protect 
United States interests, property and personnel have been 
truly commendable. 
 
We appreciate all you have done and stand ready to support 
you in the challenging days that come. 
 
Best, 
David
