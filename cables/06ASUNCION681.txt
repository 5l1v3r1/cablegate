SUBJECT: PARAGUAY: COCAINE SEIZED AND POLITICIAN'S SON 
IMPLICATED 
 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On 6/25, Paraguayan law enforcement 
officials seized 195 kg of cocaine in Bella Vista Norte, 
arrested five men, and impounded the airplane used in 
transporting the drugs.  Agents of the National Antinarcotics 
Secretariat (SENAD) worked with Paraguay's antinarcotics 
 
SIPDIS 
prosecutors and DEA officials in laying the ground work for 
this successful operation. One of the Paraguayans arrested is 
the son of a well connected Paraguayan politician. This case 
demonstrates SENAD's ability and readiness to carry out 
complex operations. It will also serve a test of Paraguay's 
political will when key political interests come into play. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On 6/25 SENAD agents seized 195 kg of cocaine and 
arrested five men in the district of Bella Vista Norte, in 
the department of Concepcion, 150 miles northeast of 
Asuncion. The plane used for transporting the drugs was also 
impounded and remains in custody.  Four Paraguayans and one 
Brazilian were arrested. One of the men arrested, Cristian 
Adilson Villalta Cubas, is the son of an influential Colorado 
politician, Faustino Villa Alta, who has strong ties to 
President Duarte. Colorado politician Victor Raul D'Ecclesiis 
Jiminez was also arrested when the drugs were discovered on 
his ranch. Another Colorado politician, Ludovico Godoy, was 
implicated but not arrested. Godoy operates the Bella Vista 
Norte aerodrome where the plane was found. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During its investigation SENAD discovered that the 
Bella Vista Norte airport was being used in the trafficking 
of drugs. The prosecutors of the antinarcotics unit were 
informed and accompanied SENAD officials to inspect the 
airport. Authorities found the plane they suspected to be 
involved, and several men who were washing the interior of 
the plane and rearranging the seats to hide traces of drugs. 
The cocaine was not found at the Bella Vista airport. 
However, using the GPS system in the plane officials were 
able to locate a ranch where the drugs had been deposited. A 
team of agents went to the location and found the drugs 
hidden on the property. In connection to this case, 
authorities arrested Paraguayans Victor Raul D,Ecclesiis 
Jiminez, Cristian Rodrigo Gimenez Dacunha, Cristian Adilson 
Villalta Cubas, and Rafael Contrera Moreira. Authorities also 
arrested Brazilian national Eduardo Jose de Araujo who was 
the pilot of the plane. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: This case offers evidence of SENAD's, and 
in particular Minister Ibarra's, commitment to working 
productively with DEA and law enforcement officials to 
successfully conduct a complex antinarcotics operation, 
follow proper legal procedures, and apply appropriate 
investigative techniques. It will also test Paraguay's 
ability to prosecute politically connected defendants.  End 
comment.
