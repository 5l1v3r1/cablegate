REF:  SECSTATE 251814 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Latvia would support new sanctions against Iran if it 
fails to meet its international obligations and will consider making 
a public statement to this effect following the October 1 meeting at 
the IAEA.  Reftel points were delivered by PolOff in tandem with 
British and French counterparts to Raimonds Oskalns, Head of the 
Arms Control Division at the Latvian MFA, on September 30.  Oskalns 
said Latvia would likely support EU sanctions, but that UN Security 
Council sanctions would be stronger.  He added that Latvia believes 
it will be important to evaluate any proposed sanctions based on 
their targeted impact on Iran.
