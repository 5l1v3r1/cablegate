Begin text: 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
It is, indeed, a pleasure to welcome Ambassador Kopaj back to 
the Permanent Council, and to thank him for his very 
comprehensive report.  The United States strongly supports 
the important work of the Office of the Project Coordinator, 
which is occurring in an increasingly challenging 
socio-political environment. 
 
The PCU,s broad range of projects appropriately covers all 
three dimensions, and their objectives focus on a number of 
challenges that confront Ukraine today.  We commend the 
excellent work being done by the PCU under the democracy, 
governance, and rule of law initiatives, and here we 
emphasize the efforts to strengthen the institutional 
capacity of governmental institutions, aid in electoral 
reform, and anti-corruption activities.  These priorities 
should enjoy the support of the Ukrainian Government and 
broader civil society.  We hope that the PCU,s assistance to 
the Parliament in developing a new election code will help 
put in place the necessary legal framework for conducting 
elections. 
 
Efforts to combat increasing incidents of xenophobia and 
other forms of intolerance in Ukraine continue to be of 
concern and remain a high priority for the United States.  We 
therefore encourage the PCU to identify opportunities to work 
with the HCNM to mitigate the potential for conflict among 
ethnic Russians and Ukrainians in Crimea.  We encourage the 
PCU,s active engagement with the HCNM, relevant authorities, 
and civil society to promote tolerance among affected groups. 
 
The PCU is actively engaged in a number of projects that, in 
the face of the current economic crisis confronting Ukraine, 
present timely opportunities for furthering economic 
development, promoting employment, and improving security and 
environmental management.  We commend the collaborative 
approach employed in the implementation of these initiatives 
with civilian authorities, the private sector, and local 
communities. 
 
We would also like to commend your continued overall efforts 
to improve accountability and fiscal management of the PCU,s 
projects, and urge you to continue to make this a priority. 
 
The United States remains committed to working with the 
Ukrainian Government and the OSCE,s Project Coordinator to 
assist Ukraine development as an economically stable and 
democratic country. 
 
Ambassador Kopaj, we wish you all the best for your work in 
the coming year. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
