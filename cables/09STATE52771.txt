¶1.  (U) The Department greatly appreciates Embassy Cairo's 
effective advocacy that successfully ended a standoff with 
Egypt over FY 2009 Economic Support Funds (ESF).  We 
especially thank Ambassador Margaret Scobey and USAID Mission 
Director Bambi Arellano for their personal involvement in 
breaking the impasse. 
 
¶2.  (U) After laying the groundwork to educate Washington on 
the problem, your continuous engagement with the Egyptians 
allowed you to identify signals of an opening from the 
Government of Egypt (GOE) in February 2009.  Your 
recommendations to Washington about the elements and approach 
of a comprehensive offer to the GOE reflected an 
exceptionally accurate assessment of what would be needed to 
reach resolution.  Whether via e-mail, telephone, or cable, 
you ensured Washington understood the strategic implications 
as well as the detailed rationale behind each element of the 
offer.  Every member of the team in Cairo ensured 
responsiveness to follow-up requests and enabled Washington 
to pull together as a team to act on your recommendations. 
Displaying deft negotiating skill, you worked within U.S. 
budgetary constraints to present the GOE with creative ideas 
to meet their needs. 
 
¶3.  (U) Your tireless effort has eliminated a serious point 
of contention with a major moderate, Arab partner in a 
strategically important region.  Congratulations on a job 
well done.
