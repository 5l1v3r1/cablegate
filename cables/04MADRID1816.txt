REF: STATE 108957 
 
The GOS has independent administrative authority to freeze 
assets linked to terrorism under Law 12/2003 on the 
Prevention and Blocking of the Financing of Terrorism passed 
in May 2003.  However, the regulations to implement this law 
have not been published, and no assets have been frozen under 
this law as government officials are reluctant to use the 
powers absent a regulatory framework.  We have been pressing 
Spanish officials about the regulations which we understand 
will be presented to the new government this spring.
