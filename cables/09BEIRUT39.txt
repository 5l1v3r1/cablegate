SOVEREIGNTY 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following the January 8 rocket-launching from 
southern Lebanon into northern Israel and subsequent Israeli 
response, Lebanese leaders have urged restraint by actors on 
both sides.  In official statements and press interviews, key 
political figures have been moderate in tone, emphasizing the 
need for the GOL to maintain sovereignty over all its 
territory and for Israel and Lebanon to implement fully UNSCR 
¶1701.  With the southern border thus far remaining quiet, 
Lebanese leaders have been unanimous in their condemnation of 
yesterday's attack.  Theses statements have depicted the GOL 
in a much more positive, unified light than usual.  Press 
coverage and leaders' statements remain focused on the 
situation in Gaza. 
 
OFFICIAL STATEMENTS STRESS SOVEREIGNTY, 
1701 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Public statements by key Lebanese leaders following 
the January 8 exchange of fire between an unknown group in 
Lebanon and Israel have stressed, as we would hope, restraint 
by both sides and adherence to UNSCR 1701.  Leaders also 
have emphasized the need for the Lebanese Government to 
maintain sovereignty and exercise control over all its 
territory.  President Michel Sleiman, addressing the Lebanese 
diplomatic corps January 8, said Lebanon is committed "first 
and foremost to preserve its independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity, and to act on implementing all 
provisions of resolution 1701."  He also commended UNIFIL for 
its work in southern Lebanon and its cooperation with the 
Lebanese Army. 
(See paragraph 6 below.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Lebanese Cabinet, in an official statement 
issued after its January 8 session, affirmed its "unanimous" 
commitment to stability and to all articles of UNSCR 1701. 
(Note:  The emphasis on unanimity is noteworthy as Minister 
of Labor Mohammed Fneish, a member of Hizballah, was present 
at Wednesday's meeting.  Answering questions from the press 
after issuing the Cabinet's statement, Information Minister 
Tarek Mitri reiterated, "the minister representing Hizballah 
is a member of this government and agrees on every word of 
this statement."  Press January 9 also reported that during 
the session, Fneish said, "Hizballah refuses that Lebanon's 
territory be used as a launching pad for rockets."  End 
note.)  The Cabinet emphasized "its refusal to use the 
Lebanese territories as a platform to launch rockets, and to 
give Israel pretexts to attack Lebanon."  The statement noted 
instructions had been issued to expedite investigations into 
the rocket attacks.  (See paragraph 7 below.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) In an official statement issued January 9, majority 
March 14 coalition hailed the previous day's unified Cabinet 
stance and reaffirmed its commitment to UNSCR 1701.  March 14 
said that UNSCR 1701 should be the cornerstone of the 
country's defense strategy.  A January 8 LAF communique 
highlighted LAF efforts to protect citizens and "prohibit any 
side from taking advantage of the incident and sabotaging 
stability in the country." 
 
SAME THEMES LESS FORMAL SETTINGS 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Leaders echoed similar themes in January 9 
conversations with the press.  Prime Minister Siniora told 
reporters after Friday prayers that the rocket-launching 
incident aimed to drag Lebanon into a dangerous situation and 
affirmed his persistence in implementing UNSCR 1701.  Druze 
leader Walid Jumblatt in an interview with Sharq al-Awsat 
press January 9 called for solving the issue of Palestinian 
arms in Lebanon, which he said jeopardize Lebanese stability 
and security, especially in southern Lebanon.  Jumblatt said 
the January 8 rocket-launching from Lebanon into Israel 
emphasized the importance of implementing Lebanon's National 
Dialogue recommendations. 
 
TRANSCRIPTS 
----------- 
 
¶6. (U) Discussing Lebanese security and sovereignty during 
his January 8 speech to the diplomatic corps, President 
Sleiman said the following:  "Having been able with its 
people, resistance, and army to liberate most of its 
territory from the Israeli occupation in the year 2000, 
Lebanon is committed first and foremost to preserve its 
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to 
act on implementing all provisions of resolution 1701, while 
reserving its right to regain its territories that are still 
under occupation in Kfarshouba, the Shebaa farms and the 
northern part of the village of Ghajar by all available and 
legitimate means.  In this regard, I cannot but express my 
appreciation for the role played by the United Nations 
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in South Lebanon and for 
the sacrifices it makes within the peacekeeping operations, 
and I commend the existing cooperation between UNIFIL and the 
Lebanese Army in carrying out the mandate with which it is 
entrusted." 
 
¶7. (U) The following was issued after the January 8 Cabinet 
session:  "The Council of Ministers reiterates its assurance 
of the Lebanese consensus to condemn the horrific massacres 
perpetrated by Israel in Gaza, and holds it (Israel) entirely 
responsible, based on international law.   It (the Council of 
Ministers) renews the solidarity of Lebanon with the 
Palestinian people in Gaza, who are the victims of Israel's 
ongoing crimes.  It reiterates its call on the international 
community to stop the aggression and demand Israel's 
withdrawal from Gaza and lift the blockade from its people, 
and to provide humanitarian and medical assistance to the 
population.  The Council of Ministers confirms again the 
Lebanese unanimous position on adhering to a national united 
position and Lebanon's commitment to stability and UNSCR 1701 
with all its articles.  The Council of Ministers 
categorically rejects the launching of rockets from the 
Lebanese territories and condemns the Israeli shelling which 
violates the Lebanese sovereignty and UNSCR 1701.  The 
Council of Ministers emphasizes its refusal to use the 
Lebanese territories as a platform to launch rockets, and to 
give Israel pretexts to attack Lebanon and to drag into a war 
that would harm its national interest and does not serve any 
Palestinian or Arab interests.  The Council of Ministers 
confirms the importance of the LAF, in cooperation with 
UNIFIL, to carry on its full duties.  Officials have given 
instructions to expedite investigations in order to determine 
the identity of those who launched the rockets and to arrest 
them.  The Council also decided that the First Lady will 
accept the Turkish Prime Minister's spouse's invitation to 
attend the Palestine Summit to help the people of Gaza which 
will take place this Saturday in Istanbul." 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Emphasis on the themes of Lebanese sovereignty, 
restraint by all parties on both sides of the boarder, and 
adherence to UNSCR 1701 are exactly what we would hope for 
after an incident such as the January 8 exchange of fire an 
unknown group in Lebanon and Israel.  Although public 
comments were issued January 9 regarding yesterday's 
incident, attention here continues to be directed toward the 
situation in Gaza and Israeli actions there.  The U.S. 
abstention from the January 8 UNSC vote on Gaza was not a 
main focus of today's local press coverage.  End comment.
