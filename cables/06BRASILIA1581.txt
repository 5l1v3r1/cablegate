SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S NEW ENVIRONMENTAL COURT 
 
 
¶1.  Despite being or potentially because of being one of the leading 
Brazilian-states in terms of environmental damages, Para (PA) has 
created the first Special Environmental Court in the country.  The 
court, located in Para's capital, Belem, will try small-scale 
environmental crimes; those that could be punished by up to two 
years in prison.  These include illegal hunting or fishing, cutting 
of forests and selling and transportation of wildlife species and 
plants. 
 
¶2.  The objective of the new court is to streamline the judicial 
process associated with environmental crime.  Procedures that would 
take an average of a year and a half should now be solved in a 
maximum of ten days.  Since the crimes that will be analyzed are 
considered minor offences, the court can issue alternative penalties 
such as financing environmental programs or undertaking community 
service.  Although the new court will only be responsible for crimes 
that take place in Belem, the local government is already studying 
the possibility of implementing other Special Courts throughout the 
state. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  It is important to point out that the slow judicial 
processes are one of Brazil's most pressing obstacles in combating 
environmental degradation.  Compounding this issue, less than 5% of 
fines levied against environmental crimes are actually paid.  Novel 
solutions such as this court could be one of a variety of 
first-steps to help minimize these problems.   End Comment
