KARZAI INAUGURATION 
 
REF: STATE 115549: ENCOURAGING ATTENDANCE AT THE 
     AFGHAN PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION 
 
(SBU) Poloff discussed demarche points (reftel) with Mr. Mohd 
Hussain Abu Bakr, Principal Assistant Secretary in the MFA's 
South and Central Asia Division, on November 12 regarding 
Malaysia's possible attendance of the inauguration of 
President Karzai, and on the opening of a Malaysian embassy 
in Afghanistan.  Hussain said that his government "most 
likely would not" send anyone to the inauguration, but noted 
his government would send a congratulatory message to 
President Karzai.  When asked if the GOM had intention of 
opening an embassy in Afghanistan, Hussain replied "not in 
the near future."
