SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050214023 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050214023 for the export 
of gyros to Indonesia.  Embassy is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 40 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Lack of documentation from the 
Indonesian Air Force.  Also, unfamiliar foreign consignee, 
Erena International Logistics, PT (EIL).  The company has 
appeared on a previous license but its bona fides have not 
been verified by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION JAKARTA:  Embassy is requested to make inquiries 
with appropriate authorities to determine if the Indonesian 
Air Force ordered the gyros from EIL and if so, verify the 
amount and that the items will be used for the purpose stated 
on the license.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conduct a 
site visit to EIL in order to provide Department with an 
assessment of its business operations and on-site security. 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
----What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will EIL 
retain positive control over the gyros at all times prior to 
turning them over to the Indonesian Air Force? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
END ACTION
