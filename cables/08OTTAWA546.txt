SUBJECT: Canada Takes Precautionary Action against BPA 
Ref Ottawa 538 
 
¶1. Summary: Canada announced it will take precautionary actions 
against bisphenol A (BPA), including a ban on the importation, sale 
and advertising of polycarbonate baby bottles.  The details will be 
published on April 19 in the Canada Gazette, and will be available 
for public comment until June 18. Official designation of BPA as a 
"Toxic" under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act may come in 
the autumn.  Embassy anticipates continuing need for guidance 
requested reftel.  End summary. 
 
¶2. As expected, on April 18 Canada's Minister of Health, Tony 
Clement and Minister of the Environment, John Baird announced Canada 
will take "precautionary" actions to regulate bisphenol A (BPA), a 
chemical widely used in plastics.  On April 19 the government will 
publish a proposed plan in the Canada Gazette I to manage the 
chemical, with the emphasis being a ban on the importation, sale and 
advertising of polycarbonate baby bottles.  The plan will be open 
for public comment from April 19 to June 18, 2008.  According to 
technical experts from Health Canada and Environment Canada, after 
the public comment period there will be a four month period when the 
Minister of Health and Minister of Environment will jointly assess 
the additional information presented and make a final determination 
whether BPA should be listed as a "Toxic" substance under the CEPA, 
and whether the proposed ban should be implemented.  Officials with 
the two ministries expect that it would take an additional six 
months after that (to accommodate administrative reviews, public 
comment periods and so on) before the ban could actually come into 
force. 
 
¶3. Despite a very narrow product focus, this action by Canada (the 
first country in the world to invoke a health-related ban regarding 
BPA) may precipitate additional widespread public concern in both 
Canada and the United States.  In anticipation of the official 
announcement, Wal-Mart Canada and other major retailers have pulled 
many plastic food containers, water bottles and baby products from 
their shelves. 
 
¶4. Embassy will assess the detailed proposal for the ban after it is 
made available on Saturday April 19.  We anticipate that media 
guidance as requested reftel will still be required.
