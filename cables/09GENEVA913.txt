1.(SBU) The head of the Israeli Mission's trade team called Charge 
this afternoon to provide a readout on their consultation last week 
with General Council Chair (GC) Matus. He said that Matus made a 
pitch for an "interim solution" that would include two agenda items 
at the November 17 General Council meeting.  One agenda item would 
deal with observership at the Ministerial Conference and his hope 
would be that this request (which has yet to be made) could be 
agreed.  The other agenda item would address the PA's request for 
observer status in the GC. Under this item, Matus would expect a 
substantive discussion but not a decision. Matus told the Israelis 
that one Arab state is pushing him hard to place this on the agenda. 
 They have also picked up that the EC might place this issue on the 
agenda.  For their part, the Israeli's repeated their objection to 
the PA's observer status in the GC but they did not speak to the 
issue of observership at the Ministerial Conference. 
 
Â¶2. (SBU) Our Israeli interlocutor thought it likely that his 
authorities could agree to observership at the Ministerial 
Conference but that they would need something in return.  He 
indicated that they were hoping that this something would be that 
the GC request would go away for a while and that they would not 
have to face this again in the new year.  However, it sounded like 
they were still considering a range of options.
