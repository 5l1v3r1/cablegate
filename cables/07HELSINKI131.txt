¶1. Building upon the successful U.S. - EU High Level 
Dialogue (HLD) on Climate Change, Clean Energy and 
Sustainable Development held in October 2006 in Helsinki, 
post is developing a series of activities to highlight the 
U.S. Government's pro-growth, pro-development approach for 
addressing climate change.  Given their typical pragmatic 
approach to challenges and their own concerns about climate 
change, Finns have been receptive to a discussion that 
moves beyond the straitjacket of targets and timetables 
embodied in the Kyoto Protocol.  This public outreach also 
supports the Embassy's 2006 Mission Performance Plan (Goal 
#5) which calls for strong environmental cooperation 
between Finland and the U.S. 
 
¶2. During the latter half of 2006, post held several 
activities related to tackling the challenge of climate 
change.  Ambassador Ware hosted a lunch for Finnish HLD 
participants, including Minister of Trade and Industry 
Pekkarinen and former Minister of Environment Enestam. 
Ambassador Ware also authored an Op-ed on U.S. actions to 
address climate change that ran on February 8 in the 
Helsinki Sanomat, the largest circulating paper in the 
Nordic countries.  Embassy Helsinki has also arranged for 
two Finnish officials from the Confederation of Finnish 
Industries (EK) to participate in an International Visitors 
Program this July to learn more about the U.S. approach to 
climate change and clean energy at both the regional and 
federal levels. 
 
¶3. Furthermore, post is considering additional reinforcing 
activities in the upcoming months, including: 
 
-- Working with GLOBE schools to teach students about 
climate change and sustainable development using science- 
based activities. 
 
-- Encouraging Finland to join the Methane-to-Markets 
Partnership, as highlighted in the HLD Joint Statement. 
 
-- Arranging for Ambassador Ware to deliver a major speech 
on climate change at the Arktikum Center, near the Arctic 
Circle in Rovaniemi, home of Finland's International Polar 
Year celebrations and polar climate research activities. 
 
--Scheduling a roundtable at the Embassy for business 
leaders, NGOs, government contacts, as well as journalists 
to discuss climate change. 
 
--Arranging a talk by Dr. David Schultz from NOAA (on loan 
to the Finnish Meteorological Institute) to speak on 
weather and climate issues. 
 
--Sponsoring an Earth Day Art Contest for students at the 
active GLOBE schools on the theme of "What is important to 
you about our environment?" (reftel B)
