Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 10, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) 
Governor Gideon Gono announced the licensing of foreign 
exchange wholesale and retail shops plus service stations, 
allegedly to increase the availability of basic goods and 
improve manufacturers' capacity utilization. He also reduced 
the foreign exchange surrender requirement on exporters, 
announced new support for the gold sector, raised the seed 
maize price for growers, and announced the issuance of a 
US$-denominated government bond. The formal retail sector 
welcomed the opportunity to sell goods for hard currency, but 
found the buy-in price high.  We question the timing of the 
announcement and don't expect the initiative to put Zimbabwe 
on a sustainable recovery path. End Summary.

for importation of strategic commodities, including fuel, 
maize and wheat, fertilizer, agrochemicals, farm equipment,

Private Sector Sees Some Benefits 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Albert Katsande, Chief Operating Officer of 
Zimbabwe's largest supermarket chain OK Zimbabwe Ltd, told 
econoff on September 11 that the policy shift would help his 
and other large companies survive.  Until now, they had faced 
arrest if they played in the informal market.  The new policy 
formalized the dollarization of the economy that was already 
underway, in his view.   He also felt it effectively killed 
the National Income and Pricing Commission. 
 
¶6. (SBU) OK Zimbabwe has 53 outlets; Katsande said it would 
probably select about 30 of them to be foreign exchange 
stores.  It could not afford to pay the security deposit of 
US$20,000 per outlet up front, and would try to negotiate 
payment with profits from sales.  Katsande expected the RBZ 
to selectively grant security deposit dispensations, which he 
suggested opened up a new source of patronage. It would 
squeeze out some informally operating forex shops on the one 
hand, and, on the other hand, provide people with US$20,000 
but no retail experience a front "to do deals." 
 
¶7. (SBU) On the markup, Katsande said 30 percent was 
 
HARARE 00000822  003 OF 003 
 
 
reasonable if the company were allowed to include all its 
costs, including rent, labor and financing. The NIPC had 
allowed a 20 percent markup.  He did point out, however, that 
the 15 percent foreign exchange surrender requirement cut 
into the profit margin, but added that the vagueness of how 
the markup would be determined could work in the retail 
sector's favor by leaving room for interpretation. On the US 
dollar denominated bond, he suggested that the RBZ had 
probably assumed "something positive" coming out of the 
present power-sharing negotiations, which would have lowered 
sovereign risk and made the terms more attractive.  Katsande 
felt that the initiative could be an intermediate step toward 
formal dollarization of the economy, but for now there was 
not enough foreign exchange in circulation to cover anything 
more than day-to-day transactions. 
 
¶8. (U) Post was unable to reach more executives in the formal 
retail economy or in the fuel business for their views, but 
will report further septel. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU)  Introducing a major policy shift that fails to 
address the economy's fundamental distortions during the most 
delicate phase of power-sharing negotiations indicates bad 
faith on the government's part.  Gono should be acting like a 
lame duck governor, as his ouster and the implementation of 
far-reaching reforms will certainly be a top priority of the 
MDC once it has a voice in government. The uptake on the 
license offer will put some foreign exchange in the 
government's coffers, the outlets could lower the transaction 
cost of shopping for those with access to forex, and more 
people will grow accustomed to transacting in foreign 
exchange, but the initiative will not set Zimbabwe on a 
sustainable recovery path.
