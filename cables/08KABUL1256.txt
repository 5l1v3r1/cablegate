SUBJECT: PAKTIA PROVINCE: IMPROVING SECURITY SITUATION, MAJOR 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND A POPULAR GOVERNOR 
 
Security 
-------- 
¶1. (SBU) From January through the end of May 2008, the security 
situation in most of Paktia province has been relatively calm, with 
the possible exception of the Zadran Arc districts of Gerdai Serai, 
Shwak, and Wasi Zadran on the border with Khost province, and Zurmat 
district bordering Ghazni, Logar, and Paktika provinces.  During the 
first three months of the year, Paktia experienced typically harsh 
winter weather, with several feet of snow and constant 
below-freezing temperatures in many districts.  Predictably, the 
enemy abandoned most of the province during those months and 
reportedly waited out the winter on the Pakistani side of the 
border.  There were very few IED, mortar, or indirect fire incidents 
against coalition forces or bases during those months. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As in the previous year, there were rumors that the enemy 
would gear up again for a "spring offensive" once weather permitted. 
 Thus far, no such offensive has occurred in Paktia. Although 
sporadic IED incidents, mortar, and indirect fire attacks continue 
to occur in the Zadran Arc and in Zormat, the security situation has 
improved noticeably as a result of several operations and on-going 
presence by coalition forces in conjunction with the Afghan National 
Security Forces and civilian authorities.  Though bringing security 
and governance to Zormat is a long-term project, combined efforts 
since late last year by the maneuver battalion, Afghan army, Afghan 
police, PRT civil affairs, and Governor Hamdard's administration 
have brought some level of peace to that district.  The remaining 
nine districts in Paktia enjoy relative peace, including districts 
like Jaji, Chamkani and Patan bordering Pakistan.  This stable 
environment is due in large part to the effectiveness of the tribes 
in providing governance and rule of law to their constituents. 
 
Development 
----------- 
¶3. (SBU) Paktia is an agricultural economy based on small family 
plots and small-animal herding, but it is incapable of producing 
enough foodstuffs to feed its own population.  During most of the 
year, it must import significant amounts of wheat, rice and 
vegetables from Pakistan.  During the harsh winter, the economy is 
virtually paralyzed, with farmers waiting for the snow melt to begin 
their farming cycle.  This winter experienced a smaller than normal 
snowfall, causing agricultural officials to predict lower yields of 
traditional wheat, potato, garden vegetable and fruit crops.  The 
expected reduced agricultural yields combined with the continuing 
high prices of staple food items from Pakistan is likely to cause 
real hardship for the population, especially those in remote 
districts, in the second half of the year. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Two major projects on the horizon should significantly 
improve the living conditions of many Paktia residents in the next 
two years.  Work on the USAID-funded road from Khost to Gardez 
through the Khost-Gardez pass will begin soon, with an anticipated 
completion date of late 2009.  The road will make the city of Gardez 
a major commercial hub for the Loya Paktia region and should improve 
the agricultural economy of the Zadran Arc districts.  The 
seven-million dollar, USAID-funded Paktia provincial hospital, to be 
completed by 2009, will provide the province with a high level of 
medical care and should reduce mortality rates among newborns and 
children and improve women's health care. 
 
Governance 
---------- 
¶5. (SBU) Tribal elders, local political leaders and provincial 
residents welcomed the removal in January 2008 of highly unpopular 
Paktia Governor Rahmat and his replacement by respected Governor 
Hamdard in March.  The contrast in styles between Rahmat and Hamdard 
could not have been greater.  Rahmat, a former communist 
apparatchik, often berated and threatened tribal elders at shuras. 
Hamdard, a Pashtun and former mujaheedin commander, treats elders 
and religious leaders with respect, is accessible to them, and is 
reportedly very generous with his own money in helping people in 
need.  Hamdard is relentlessly lobbying the central government and 
NGOs to bring funding for infrastructure and social projects to 
Paktia. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Hamdard has excellent relations with the provincial council 
(PC) and is supportive of efforts to strengthen the role of the PC. 
The Paktia PC continues to drive the provincial development plan

(PDP), performing most of the PDP groundwork. Paktia's chief 
prosecutor and chief justice, both good PRT contacts, are now 
working with Governor Hamdard in extending rule of law to the 
districts.  The one negative note continues to be the majority of 
ministry line officers, most of whom are ill-educated, and, in some 
cases appear disinterested in performing their jobs.  The PRT is 
working with key line directors to try to upgrade their skills and 
motivational level.
