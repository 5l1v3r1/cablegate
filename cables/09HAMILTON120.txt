Summary 
 
------------ 
 
 
 
¶1.      (U) In a wide-ranging televised speech to the people of 
Bermuda on October 15 - three weeks prior to the November 6 
Throne Speech - Premier Ewart Brown used Bermuda's 400th 
birthday to call for unity.  Brown defended his government's 
performance during the global economic recession.  He also 
discussed the progress made on addressing Bermudian's 
social/economic needs.  Brown addressed several issues relating 
to the United States.  He promised to continue lobbying against 
possible harmful tax changes that would affect international 
businesses in Bermuda; proposed two initiatives with the U.S. - 
a partnership with the US Coast Guard and renegotiation of 
environmental remediation of a former US Navy base; and 
undertook to work with the State Department to get relief on 
visa ineligibilities, the so-called "stop list."  He also made a 
case for Bermuda taking control from the UK over Bermuda's 
Police Service in order to tackle the growing crime rate.  The 
opposition welcomed the premier's call for unity while 
criticizing him for his divisive politics.  End summary. 
 
 
 
Bermuda Holding Its Own During Economic Recession ~ 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------

¶2.      (U) Premier Brown addressed how the global recession had 
impacted Bermuda's two pillars - tourism and international 
business.  In the midst of public criticism that the government 
had not followed through on its plans to bring new hotels to the 
island, Brown attempted to reassure the public that developers 
were still committed and that Bermuda would rebound in the 
tourism sector.  (Note: the premier is also the Minister for 
Tourism.)  He hailed Bermuda's position on the OECD's "white 
list" jurisdiction in compliance with internationally agreed 
upon tax standards." 
 
 
 
~ But Concerned about U.S. Tax Laws 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
 
¶3.      (U) Brown complained about international businesses 
moving away from Bermuda because "they can potentially be 
negatively impacted by the whims of a U.S. Congress."  He 
continued to discuss the "perceived threat of unfavourable U.S. 
taxation."   The Premier outlined his government's lobbying 
efforts in Washington and promised to "~continue our unrelenting 
efforts against enactment of legislation that would be harmful 
to our economy~.we will step up our efforts even more to 
convince the United States of our value and of the negative 
consequences the U.S. itself will incur with unfavourable tax 
treatment of insurance and other companies located in places 
like Bermuda." 
 
 
 
Partnering with the U.S. Coast Guard 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
 
¶4.      (U) Premier Brown stated that the Government was working 
on an initiative to partner with a US Coast Guard program, 
"~where as a partner country we would be provided with 
high-speed interceptor boats, special communication equipment 
and, importantly, training of Bermudian public safety officers 
in drug interdiction and maritime law enforcement."   (Note: 
While the Government of Bermuda raised this after the Navy base 
closed, this is the first we have heard of it  in years.  The 
Coast Guard already assists in search and rescue operations in

the waters between the U.S. and Bermuda.) 
 
 
 
Cleaning Up Former US Naval Air Station 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
 
¶5.      (U) The Premier told the public that the government is 
"redoubling our efforts to persuade the U.S. government to 
reopen and renegotiate the clean-up of Morgan's Point."  He 
added that he would keep the public appraised of the 
government's progress.  (Note:  This issue hit the press on 
September 26 when the Premier said he had raised this with 
Attorney General Holder.) 
 
 
 
Relaxing the "Stop List" 
 
----------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶6.      (U) Premier Brown indicated that the Government of 
Bermuda is "~committed to working with the US State Department 
to get relief from what Bermudians call the `stop list.'  We 
believe that it is unfair and unjust for someone who committed a 
minor criminal offence 20 years ago to be prevented from 
travelling to the US, or to have to undergo the humiliating 
experience of being stopped and detained.  We understand clearly 
that these laws affect people all over the world - they were not 
just written for Bermuda.  But your government will be 
aggressive in seeking innovative solutions to prevent young 
people from ever getting on the so-called `stop-list.' We shall 
also work on behalf of older people who have long-since paid 
their debt to society, and deserve to be able to freely travel." 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
------------ 
 
 
 
¶7.      (SBU) Bermudians had speculated that the Premier might 
call for snap elections during the speech, so his call for unity 
and no mention of snap elections was an unstated promise and 
assurance of political stability.  Commentators also interpret 
his speech to mean that he will depart office as planned in 
October 2010.  Post will follow up with government to determine 
what type of partnership with the Coast Guard Bermuda would like 
to pursue.
