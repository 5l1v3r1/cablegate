REF: STATE 97566 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Political Minister Counselor and Poloff met with 
MFA Head of UNGA Division Thomas Fitschen September 21 to 
deliver reftel points.  Fitschen noted that the issue of 
redlines for walkouts has already been discussed within the 
EU in Brussels last week.  He said that the EU presidency is 
trying to reach a unified EU approach and noted that EU 
redlines generally match those of reftel.  Fitschen also 
noted that German MFA UNGA Head of Delegation State Secretary 
Silberberg and Minister Director for the UN Division Wittig 
are already in New York and decisions on these issues will 
therefore be made in New York.
