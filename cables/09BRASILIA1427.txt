DERIVED FROM: Derived from previous message. 
 
(C)  Emboffs delivered the reftel message on December 17 to 
Briazilian Ministry for External Relations (MRE) Director for 
Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies Santiago Mourao.  Mourao 
said that Brazil welcomed U.S. support for a subsidiary body 
focusing on security assurances which are an important part of the 
agenda for Non-Nuclear Weapons States.  He referred to the idea of 
a subsidiary body on Article X as "more complicated."  According to 
Mourao, because of the importance of the NPT, exit from the Treaty 
should be made "more costly" without denying the right to exit 
altogether.  He has seen several ideas of ways to raise the cost of 
exiting, but considers most of these impractical.  Mourao said that 
Brazil will use the time leading up to the Revcon to "take stock" 
of the ideas for Article X, but reaching agreement on a way forward 
would not be easy.
