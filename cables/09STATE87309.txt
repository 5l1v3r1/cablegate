SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050110212 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050110212 for the export of 
International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled aircraft 
parts and related technical data. Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Original end-use certificate submitted 
by foreign consignee Air Parts Ltd. of the UK stated end-use 
platform was the Tornado for ultimate end-use by EADS 
Deutschland GMBH (EADS), a company that does not own or 
operate said aircraft.  A replacement end-user certificate 
was submitted by Air Parts Ltd. to change the end-use 
platform to the Eurofighter. No government end-user was 
identified.  As a proviso to the license approval, the 
ultimate-end users of the aircraft parts were limited to the 
governments of Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post make appropriate 
inquiries to confirm that EADS ordered the items listed for 
the purpose stated on the application.  In addition, Post is 
requested to confirm if parts listed have been supplied to 
the governments authorized on the license. 
 
The following points are included for guidance: 
 
--Can EADS provide documentation of the ultimate end-user and 
end-use of the parts, such as shipment records, contracts, or 
purchase orders? 
 
--Was EADS provided with written notification from Hartwell 
Corporation regarding the limitations on the re-export of the 
parts? 
 
END ACTION.
