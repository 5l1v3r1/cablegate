"Cuban Crisis" 
 
Columnist Nelson Motta commented in liberal, largest national 
circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (8/4): "Everyone is sympathetic 
with Cuba and its brave and joyful people, even among those who hate 
the revolution, its leader and its bureaucrats. But no know 
understands why the US doesn't allow its tourists to invade the 
island, sell to Cuba everything it needs - which is almost 
everything - and end this foolishness that has made Cubans suffer 
for 40 years. As a result, Americans lose money and Fidel gains 
power.... The 2 million exiled Cubans in Miami are the ones who 
decide the elections in Florida.... Politicians flatter them and do 
everything they want against Fidel. After all, when the US 
Presidency is at stake, who cares about Cuba?.... This minority that 
decides the destiny of two nations is dominated by a minority of old 
Cuban families that for 40 years want their island back.... A shame, 
if the money from American tourism and commerce were added to the 
capital and competence of Cubans in Miami and the talent, education 
and health of the island, in very little time, Cuba would become the 
most prosperous and happy country in Latin America."
