¶1.  (U) Econoff delivered on September 14 reftel points and nonpaper 
advocating accountability for WIPO Director General to Jean-Baptiste 
Mozziconacci, Head of bilateral affairs and international 
cooperation at the National Institute for Industrial Property 
(INPI). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mozziconacci noted previous Embassy demarches on this 
issue and said he was "very aware" of the USG position regarding 
Idris.  Mozziconacci agreed that Idris' actions were "serious," but 
he added that the situation was delicate and that the GOF would need 
to discuss the matter with other EU governments before taking a 
position.  Mozziconacci will be attending the upcoming WIPO General 
Assembly session in Geneva.
