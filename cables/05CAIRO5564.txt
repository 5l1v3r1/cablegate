¶1.  (SBU) During a conversation with Walid Nozahy, WTO 
Director of Egypt's Commercial Representation Office, 
tradeoff asked about Egypt's failure to support the USG 
position on food aid during July 6 WTO discussions in Geneva 
(reftel).  Nozahy expressed surprise, claiming to have 
directed his representative in Geneva to support the USG 
position.  After making several inquiries, Nozahy confirmed 
that the Commercial Representation official who had received 
instructions had failed to attend the meeting.  He added that 
an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had taken 
his place.  Apparently unaware of the instruction to support 
the USG position, this official had taken a non-committal 
position during the discussions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) An apologetic Nozahy promised that in future 
negotiations and discussions the GOE would support our 
position on this issue.
