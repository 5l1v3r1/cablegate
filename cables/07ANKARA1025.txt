REF: ANKARA 1006 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (U) Turkey's Constitutional Court announced late Mary 1 
that it has accepted the opposition Republican People's Party 
(CHP) petition to annul the first round of presidential 
voting on the ground that the required quorum was not 
present.  CHP had argued that 367 -- the two-thirds of the 
members of parliament necessary to actually elect a president 
in either of the first two rounds -- is also the number 
required for a quorum.  The Court agreed with CHP.  It will 
publish its decision as quickly as possible. 
 
¶2. (U) Minutes later, Justice and Development Party (AKP) 
spokesman and Justice Minister Cemil Cicek announced at a 
press conference that the AKP government will abide by the 
Court's decision as, he added, would any Turkish government. 
Cicek also indicated that parliament would convene as 
scheduled tomorrow afternoon, May 2, for what would have been 
the second round of voting.  Tomorrow's round will now 
instead serve as a second attempt to gather a quorum of 367 
for a new first round.  If, as seems virtually certain, 367 
MPs do not show, this parliament will be unable to elect a 
president.  As a result, its only remaining duties will be to 
pass an election law and dissolve itself. 
 
¶3. (U) The AKP central executive and decision making board 
will reportedly convene this evening; the AK party group will 
meet tomorrow morning.  The opposition, whose desire for 
early elections the Court's decision fulfills, is expected to 
make statements soon.  Cicek told the assembled press that 
not only was AKP prepared to go to early elections, but it 
was the party best prepared to do so. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  The Court's decision ensures early 
elections, taking Turkey down the road that seemed almost 
inevitable following the Turkish General Staff's April 27 
statement.  It also allows AKP to take the high road, make 
another attempt to gather a quorum of 367 and when that 
fails, proceed with immediate elections.  This development 
will likely calm financial markets.  The Court's decision 
accomplishes one more thing as well:  it guarantees that it 
will be enormously difficult for any sitting parliament to 
elect a president, unless (1) one party manages to amass at 
least 367 MPs; or (2) a candidate is found who commands such 
consensus that this new quorum requirement can be met.  End 
comment.
