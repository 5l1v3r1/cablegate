SUBJECT: Welcome to the Montreal International Conference on Haiti 
 
REF: A) State 111010   B) Nichols/Allen email of June 15 
 
¶1.  Post welcomes Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere 
Affairs Ambassador Roger Noriega and delegation to the Montreal 
International Conference on Haiti. 
 
¶2.  Control Officer Neill Krost will meet and assist Ambassador 
Noriega at the airport.  His contact numbers in Montreal are: 
(514) 908-3704 (office); (514) 767-3749 (home). 
 
¶3.  Threat assessment: All diplomatic posts worldwide are taking 
heightened security precautions in light of on-going threats from 
Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups.  All USG employees and 
visitors should remain aware of their surroundings while in 
Montreal.  Additionally, our experience in Canada has shown that 
military actions by the U.S. and its allies often lead to 
protests in Montreal and throughout Canada.  All such protests 
should be avoided to the maximum extent possible.  All USG 
employees and visitors should also be cognizant of pick 
pocketing, purse snatching, luggage theft, theft of personal 
property from hotel rooms, theft of automobiles and vehicle break- 
ins, as many visitors to Montreal fall victim to these and other 
property crimes throughout the year.  Report any unusual 
circumstances to the Consulate's Regional Security Officer.
