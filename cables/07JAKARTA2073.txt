SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR CAMERON R. HUME PRESENTS CREDENTIALS TO 
INDONESIAN PRESIDENT YUDHOYONO 
 
REF: 07 JAKARTA 2069 
 
¶1.  On August 1 Ambassador Hume, along with the new 
Ambassadors from Libya, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Argentina, 
presented credentials to President Yudhoyono.  In the joint 
audience following the ceremony President Yudhoyono described 
his goals to be the strengthening of democracy in Indonesia, 
the expansion of the economy for the benefit of all 
Indonesians, and a positive international role for Indonesia. 
 He cited the benefits of cooperation on anti-terrorism, and 
he spoke about Indonesia,s desire to play a constructive 
role on environmental issues, including the hosting of the 
COP-13 Climate Change conference in Bali this December.  His 
visit to New York for the UN General Assembly, September 
24-25, would include a meeting on environmental issues. 
 
¶2.  President Yudhoyono expressed concern that present 
difficulties in some parts of the world, such as Iraq, not be 
used to stoke religious antagonisms or to justify 
intolerance.  He had presided over Iraq,s victory in the 
Asian Soccer tournament in Jakarta a few days earlier, and he 
hoped that the situation in Iraq was now changing for the 
better.  Finally, he urged the new ambassadors to meet not 
only with government officials but also with leaders of civil 
society and Indonesian businessmen.  Indonesia was undergoing 
significant change, and leaders outside the government were 
making important contributions. 
 
¶3.  In comments addressed to Ambassador Hume, Yudhoyono said 
he appreciated Indonesia,s growing partnership with the 
United States and looked forward to meeting President Bush 
during the APEC Summit in Sydney.   He thanked the Ambassador 
for his assistance in resolving the commercial dispute 
between Nike and one of its local suppliers (reftel).  Hume 
responded that the United States government wanted to build a 
stronger relationship with Indonesia and shared the goal of a 
well-governed, democratic Indonesia able to provide 
opportunities for all of its citizens.
