SUBJECT: GAZA:  FOOD AND FUEL AVAILABLE FOR NOW 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Basic food commodities and fuel remain 
available in Gaza, but prices are increasing and food stocks 
are declining rapidly, according to Gaza residents, UN 
agencies and NGOs.  UNRWA and WFP have resumed operations, 
but UNRWA says it has only 10 days of flour in its 
warehouses.  If Karni/al-Mintar crossing remains closed, 
several basic foodstuffs will become extremely scarce by the 
end of June.  End Summary.

FUEL FLOWS 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Israeli company Dor resumed shipments of all 
petroleum products into Gaza through the Nahal Oz crossing 
June 18, according to several ConGen contacts.  Prime 
Minister Fayyad confirmed this with the Consul General on 
June 18.  A temporary suspension of shipments had resulted in 
long lines at Gaza Gas stations June 16-17, as Palestinians 
attempted to fill up while supplies lasted.  A Palestinian 
retailer of petroleum products advised EconSpecialist June 18 
that, although fuel is flowing, confusion exists on the Gaza 
side over who from the PA should be involved in the process. 
The retailer said he expects a resolution of the issue later 
on June 18.  Hamas Executive Forces entered the Gaza side of 
the Nahal Oz crossing early June 18 and demanded fuel, but 
were convinced to leave empty-handed, according to the 
retailer.  The Gaza Power Plant reportedly received a 
delivery of fuel late on June 17 sufficient for three days.

FOOD AVAILABLE

¶3.  (SBU) Karni/al-Mintar crossing, the main commercial 
artery for Gaza, has remained closed since June 11.  WFP 
staff told Econoff June 18 that sugar, wheat flour and 
cooking oil supplies are sufficient for one-to-two weeks. 
Most bakeries have a five-day supply of wheat flour and oil, 
according to the WFP.  Gaza-based OCHA staff report that 
bakeries are limiting sales to one bag of bread per customer, 
and lines have formed at most Gaza bakeries.  Food stocks are 
being depleted faster than usual because Gaza residents have 
begun hoarding basic food commodities.  Prices on some items 
have risen as much as 40 percent.  Dairy products -- most of 
which are imported through Karni/al-Mintar crossing -- are in 
limited supply. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) WFP Spokesperson Kirstie Campbell advised Econoff 
June 18 that WFP resumed operations in Gaza June 17.  UNRWA's 
Gaza Director of Field Operations John Ging announced 
publicly that his agency had resumed full operations June 17 
throughout the entire Gaza Strip after a two-day cessation of 
activity.  (Note:  WFP and UNRWA provide food assistance to 
over 1 million Gazans.  End note.)  WFP and UNRWA completed 
partial food distributions prior to Karni/al-Mintar's most 
recent closure.  WFP assistance beneficiaries will have their 
needs met until late July/early August.  Ging advised June 18 
that UNRWA's stock of basic foodstuffs is sufficient for one 
month, but its supply of flour will last only 10 days.

HOSPITALS OPERATIONAL 
--------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Gaza-based WHO staff advised Econoff June 18 that 
most hospitals in Gaza have returned to normal operations and 
have, in general, one-month of medicines and medical 
supplies.  Hospital personnel are again working regular 
shifts, although the three Gaza vascular surgeons continue to 
work almost non-stop on wounded fighters and civilians.  The 
PA Ministry of Health (MOH) has called for blood donations. 
WHO staff noted that some medical equipment requires 
maintenance and parts, most of which must be imported through 
Karni/al-Mintar.  WHO is working to coordinate the entry of 
some medical supplies into Gaza from the MOH warehouse in 
Ramallah.  The electricity supply from the Gaza Power Plant 
remains unreliable, so hospitals use diesel-powered 
generators.  Hospital directors reported to WHO June 18 a 
5-10 day supply of diesel fuel remaining.

Crossings 
--------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) All Gaza crossings remained closed June 18, except 
Nahal Oz for fuel shipments and Erez for pedestrians traffic 
with special coordination. Erez opened briefly but closed 
after a large crowd of Palestinians attempting to flee Gaza 
rushed the crossing.
