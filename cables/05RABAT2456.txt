¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In a December 6 meeting with visiting DEA 
officials and emboffs to discuss GOM counternarcotics 
efforts, senior Interior Ministry (MOI) official Khalid 
Zerouali, Governor-Director of International Cooperation, 
explained that for drugs to be completely eradicated in 
Morocco they must be attacked at three levels: production, 
trafficking, and consumption, but noted that the GOM "can not 
tackle these issues by ourselves."  Describing his desire for 
increased cooperation between the U.S. and Morocco, Zerouali 
commented that DEA and GOM interactions should move beyond 
day-to-day operations to a more strategic level of 
cooperation.  Zerouali closed the meeting remarking, "Let's 
make 2006 a year of concrete cooperation."  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Morocco's Counternarcotics Focus 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On December 6, DEA Country Attach in Paris Sam 
Houston, DEA Special Agent Bronwyn Haley, A/RSO, A/LEGATT, 
and Poloff met with senior MOI official Khalid Zerouali, 
Governor-Director of International Cooperation, to discuss 
Moroccan counternarcotics issues.  Zerouali explained that 
although there is still a lot of work to be done in order to 
eradicate hashish, "Morocco is proud to be trying."  (NB: 
Zerouali's office, among other things, leads overall 
coordination of the Moroccan government's counternarcotics 
strategy).  He noted that Morocco is strides ahead of other 
countries in that the GOM has developed a comprehensive 
counternarcotics strategy.  He also explained that the GOM 
has actively and willing engaged in joint activities with the 
United Nations.  Zerouali pointed to Morocco's forthcoming 
cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime's (UNODC) 2004 study on cannabis production and 
eradication efforts in Morocco as an example of such 
cooperation.  According to Zerouali, Morocco's 
counternarcotics strategy is focused on protecting the 
population, and the MOI is always working towards solutions 
that will benefit Moroccans. 
 
---------------------------- 
Zerouali Offers Warm Welcome 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Contrary to previous meetings with Emboffs 
(reftels), Zerouali did not use this meeting to express his 
dissatisfaction with what he deems a lack of U.S. efforts to 
provide Morocco with border security assistance.  Instead, 
Zerouali warmly welcomed visiting DEA delegation, focused his 
comments on counternarcotics issues, and wished the 
delegation a safe return back to Paris. 
 
---------------------------- 
Need to Work on Three Levels 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Zerouali explained that for Morocco to eradicate 
drugs it must operate on three levels: production, 
trafficking, and consumption.  He, however, highlighted that 
the GOM "cannot tackle these issues by ourselves," saying 
that Morocco must rely on the help of others to solve its 
drug problem. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On production, Zerouali claimed that Morocco has 
"done a lot of work" to eradicate hashish and to enhance 
local development.  Commenting on a phenomenon he feels is 
hard to overcome, Zerouali indicated that difficulties often 
arise with crop substitute techniques because of the 
financial incentive to produce drugs in place of legal crops. 
 He took this opportunity to remind Houston of a successful 
trip he took to Taounate province in July with former DEA 
Country Attach in Paris Habib to view Morocco's eradication 
strategy first-hand.  Zerouali mentioned that Morocco has 
declared Larache "a province without cannabis." 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Turning to trafficking, Zerouali stated that this 
is an area where the GOM needs help.  In a not-so-veiled 
reference to the potential for increased cooperation with the 
U.S., Zerouali said that "we count on you" to help combat 
trafficking.  Zerouali disclosed that Morocco seized 318 tons 
of hashish last year. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Zerouali conveyed that Europe needs to step up to 
the plate and assume its responsibility with respect to 
consumption-related issues.  In his view, European countries 
need to be more seriously engaged in the fight against drugs, 
but that this battle will be difficult so long as a demand 
from Europe continues to exist.  Describing what he perceives 
as mixed signals from Europe, Zerouali said it is hard to 
combat drugs when some European countries are trying to pass 
legislation to legalize drugs while others in Europe are 
trying stop the spread of drugs. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Looking For Enhanced Cooperation 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Describing his desire for enhanced cooperation 
between DEA and the GOM, Zerouali commented that relations 
can move from day-to-day cooperation to a more strategic 
relationship between the two entities.  After explaining that 
there is a need to organize more exchange visits to foster 
opportunities to share ideas, Zerouali stressed that the 
relationship needs to move beyond rhetoric, and that more 
concrete steps need to be taken. 
¶10.  (SBU) Zerouali also mentioned that the MOI is in the 
process of launching a drug-related website.  He complimented 
the DEA website, and proudly pointed out that the MOI website 
was "copied" from the DEA model.  Zerouali closed the meeting 
by saying, "let's make 2006 a year of concrete cooperation." 
 
¶11.  (SBU) DEA officers discussed the possible visit to 
Morocco of DEA Administrator in early 2006.  Zerouali said 
the GOM looked forward to the visit. 
 
¶12.  (U) DEA cleared this message.
