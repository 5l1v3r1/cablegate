SUBJECT: IRENA DIRECTOR GENERAL PELOSSE WELCOMES 
U.S. SIGNING OF INTERNATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY 
AGENCY STATUTE 
 
REF: STATE 073217 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On July 20, Helene Pelosse, the Interim Director General 
of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) told ESTH 
Counselor that she welcomes the U.S. signing of the IRENA Statute 
and looks forward to working together with the U.S. Government. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Pelosse welcomes reftel's invitation to visit Washington 
for consultations with the Departments of State and Energy, as well 
as Congressional meetings.  She is tentatively planning to be in 
Washington in early October, and will arrange details of her 
schedule through the Environment Section of the French Embassy in 
Washington, DC. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Pelosse confirmed that she intends to relocate from Paris 
to Abu Dhabi toward the end of 2009 as the office space identified 
for IRENA currently requires some construction. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Pelosse agrees that the IRENA secretariat should be lean, 
effective and accountable.  She is meeting this week with officials 
from the OECD's International Energy Agency (IEA) to ensure good 
coordination and no duplication of effort.  She would also welcome 
the secondment of suitable official(s) from the U.S. Government to 
staff IRENA. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Pelosse supports permanent seats for the United States 
(and Japan) on the IRENA Council.  Her current thinking is that, 
given the financial contributions of the U.S. and Japan to IRENA, 
IRENA members would support the re-election of the USG and Japan at 
every election.  This method would have the advantage of not 
requiring amendment of the IRENA Statute.  She will also continue to 
look into a better solution to ensure continued U. S. Government 
representation on the Council.
