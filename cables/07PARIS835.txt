SUBJECT: French President opposes further EU concessions in DDA 
negotiations. 
 
 
¶1. During an opening speech at the annual agricultural show in Paris 
on March 3rd, French President Jacques Chirac stated that he was 
-quote- extremely shocked by Mr Mandelson's giving more and more 
concessions without receiving compensation from the United States 
for concessions on agriculture and from emerging countries on 
industry and services. - end quote - 
 
¶2. President Chirac called all on Europeans to stand -quote- strong 
as rock -end quote- and not yield on Mr. Mandelson's proposals, 
which he condemned harshly.  He criticized Mandelson's ambition to 
conclude the DDA quickly and stated that German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel supports France's opposition to further concessions in the 
DDA. The EU Trade Commissioner's office responded that Mr. 
Mandelson's proposals were within the EU negotiating mandate. 
 
¶3. On March 5th, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, trying 
to calm the situation, said that France does not intend to block the 
DDA negotiations but wants to bring -quote- some common sense -end 
quote- back into the talks.  He repeated that agriculture should not 
be the only adjustable factor in the negotiations.
