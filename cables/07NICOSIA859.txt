REF: STATE 148605 
 
(SBU) Ref demarche was delivered to Spyros Attas, Counselor, 
Division of Multilateral Affairs at MFA, and separately to 
Antigone Hadjixenophontos, Acting Chief of the Attorney 
General's Unit for Combating Money Laundering. Both advised 
that they would immediately send our information and request 
for action by the GoC up the chains of command and let us 
know of their decision. Attas advised us that in cases like 
this, Cyprus will normally follow whatever is decided by the 
EU as a whole and was unlikely to take any action in the 
absence of a whole of EU decision. Within the EU, he doubted 
that Cyprus would take a leading role in any debate to either 
pursue or oppose designating referenced Iranian entities and 
individuals.
