¶1. (SBU) Guatemalan FM Briz reacted very positively to 
Ambassador's demarche per reftel.  Briz said he fully agreed 
with the urgency of getting the GON to request an OAS 
technical verification mission. 
 
¶2. (SBU) To that effect, Briz promised to speak with 
President Berger later the same day, February 15, to 
recommend a phone call from Berger to President Bolanos. 
Briz undertook to call FM Caldera.  He said he would instruct 
Guatemala's embassy in Managua to follow up, and he would 
instruct Guatemala's mission to the OAS to support the 
initiative.
