Title- Ayatollah regime goes through its greatest impasse 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Economico (6-25) states: 
"....the chance of popular protests [in Iran] prospering and meeting 
their goals depends on a division among high-ranking officials of 
the government, in a dispute where religion actually gives room to 
the temporal power and clerics confront clerics.  There are 
increasing signs that this is happening.....The election fraud 
created a crisis in the center of the Islamic regime and it will 
have to accommodate itself with a deal between factions  - the more 
likely outcome - or by bloody repression, whose first signs appeared 
after the dreadful result at the ballot box."
