¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to MFA European 
Correspondent Albin Otruba on July 18. Otruba will include 
U.S. non-papers in the briefing materials acting FM Diana 
Strofova receives ahead of the July 22-23 GAERC meeting(FM 
Kubis will be on vacation at the time of the GAERC). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Otruba said Slovakia fully supports the U.S. 
position with respect to Ukraine, and described Slovakia as 
proof that a European perspective motivates positive 
political change. Otruba acknowledged it would be several 
years before Ukraine is ready for EU membership, but said 
Slovakia is a vocal advocate of making an explicit commitment 
to Ukraine in upcoming EU-Ukraine negotiations. Otruba said 
that there is stiff resistance to Ukraine becoming a member 
state in some western EU countries. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Slovakia also supports the U.S. position on Iran, 
including the possibility of autonomous measures that go 
beyond UNSCR 1803. The priority for this meeting, however, is 
to see UNSCR 1803 provisions transposed into EU law. Otruba 
said the Slovak government believes pressing for more strict 
autonomous measures could prevent any agreement from being 
reached. He added, as a personal opinion and with reference 
to U.S. participation in direct talks with Iran, that now may 
be the wrong time to enact stricter autonomous measures since 
Iran has made positive statements about upcoming negotiations.
