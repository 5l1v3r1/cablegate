US Embassy Ankara - Turkey Media Reaction - January 4, 2010 as 
prepared by the Public Affairs Information Office 
 
How the US is Playing 
 
US Opens Third Front in Yemen:  In "US Plans to Eat Yemen," 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak on 1/3 described the American-British 
"third front" in the war against terror, noting that the foiled 
attack in Detroit is an "excuse" to take action in Yemen.   Turkish 
media zero in on the "third front" theme, accompanied by mostly 
negative reaction to TSA's new regulations against travelers from 14 
countries in the Middle East as anti-Muslim.  Mainstream Sabah 
headlines "Third Front Against Al Qaeda," emphasizing that President 
Obama for the first time has blamed Al Qaeda for attacking a US 
airliner, while liberal Radikal notes in "Tensions Rise Over Yemen 
Issue," that the US and Britain are "closing their embassies in 
Yemen over emerging terrorist threats."  Islamist-oriented Zaman 
gives prominent play to the CBS TV report that claims the US 
directed the 17-24 December operation in Yemen and has agreed with 
Britain to fund a special counter-terrorism unit in Yemen "to 
prevent Al Qaida from taking over the country as a safe haven."  In 
"Security vs. Privacy," mainstream Hurriyet takes an in-depth look 
at full body sweeps, noting that "many countries did not want to put 
full body scanner in use due to violations of privacy as well as 
high doses of radiation, but in the aftermath of airline bomber this 
reasoning is almost gone."  Meanwhile, several Turkish columnists 
express worry over the new security measures because of they seem 
sure to provoke prejudice against Muslims.  In mainstream Milliyet 
Semih Idiz observes "a growing anti-Muslim sentiment within the 
Western world" and that the new measures "will only make it more 
impossible for Muslim travelers, especially women, to go to the US 
and European destinations."  Islamist Zaman's Ali Aslan opines that 
President Obama being forced to get tough on security "is a victory 
for those who provoke security paranoia in the US." 
 
In the Headlines 
 
Erdogan on Turkey's EU Accession and "Our Condition for Halki 
Seminary is Western Thrace" (Milliyet) 
Today's papers give extensive front page coverage to PM Erdogan's 
interview with liberal Radikal's "Kriter" magazine.  In "Turkey Has 
Not Lost Its Zeal for EU Accession," Radikal plays up Erdogan's 
views that negative comments by EU leaders about Turkey's accession 
is "rocking the confidence of the Turkish people in the EU process." 
Mainstream Sabah headlines "European Leaders Discourage Us" and 
reports that during the interview,  PM Erdogan emphasized that there 
was no loss of enthusiasm in Turkey's EU bid.  Regarding the Halki 
Seminary, Mainstream Milliyet emphasizes that Erdogan notes "Turkish 
government is working on the re-opening of Halki Seminary.  However, 
demands of the Turkish minority living in Western Thrace should be 
taken into account while dealing with re-opening of Halki Seminary 
process. 
 
Sixth Search in Cosmic-Room 
Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Sabah, Milliyet, Yeni Safak and others report 
today that judge Kadir Kayan entered the cosmic room at the Special 
Forces Command in Ankara one more time and conducted a search 
yesterday.  Sabah notes that the General Staff's demand for the 
termination of the search and destruction of the records was 
delivered to the relevant court after office hours on December 31, 
therefore, the process of the demand was left for today. 
Islamist-oriented Zaman says that the the continuation of the search 
shows that the procedure is perfectly legal.   Regarding the latest 
happenings in Ankara,  Milliyet questions the 10 newspapers' Ankara 
representatives by saying "What is happening in Ankara?"  Responses 
of the Ankara reps show that while mainstream media express concern 
 
ANKARA 00000017  002 OF 002 
 
 
about the tiff between the state institutions, the pro-government 
media commented positively on the developments and described all 
developments as a sign for democratization. 
 
In a related story, Milliyet columnist Asli Aydintasbas says foreign 
observers described the decreasing influence of the military in 
Turkish politics as an "irreversible" process.  The writer notes 
that the foreign world acts on the assumption that the Turkish army 
would not be able to regain its previous power on the political 
arena. 
 
200 Turkish Ambassadors to Gather in Ankara 
Papers report that some 200 Turkish ambassadors posted around the 
world will gather in Ankara to discuss Turkey's foreign policy in 
Â¶2010.  Foreign Minister Davutoglu will deliver the opening remarks 
of the conference to be held on Monday.  The ambassadors and 
Davutoglu will move on to the city of Mardin over the weekend to 
wrap up the discussions. 
 
Lieberman Lashes Out at Israel's Ambassador in Turkey 
All papers cite the Jerusalem Post reporting Israeli Foreign 
Minister Avigdor Lieberman lashed out at the Israeli ambassadors 
around the world for "over-identifying" with their host countries. 
"We should end the period of placing ourselves at a lower position. 
I saw that some of the ambassadors have identified themselves so 
much with their host countries to the extent that they started to 
support the points of those countries," Lieberman reportedly said. 
According to the Jerusalem Post, Lieberman's criticism was in 
reference to the Israeli Ambassador to Ankara Gaby Levy.  Mainstream 
Aksam recalls that Levy, who was born in Turkey, had earlier said 
regarding the tensions with Turkey that Israel, too, might have made 
some mistakes.
