REF: STATE 22833 
 
¶1.  Ambassador Langdale discussed reftel points with Foreign 
Minster Tovar on March 2, 2006.  Tovar said that Costa Rica 
has not committed to supporting any candidate at this time. 
Tovar added that Costa Rica's vote will soon be courted, and 
said that the sooner the USG settles on a candidate, the 
easier it would be for Costa Rica to support that candidate. 
 
¶2.  Polcouns discussed the upcoming selection of a new UN 
Secretary General with Ambassador Jose Joaquin Chaverri, 
 
SIPDIS 
Director of Foreign Policy at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, on February 27.  Chaverri indicated that Costa Rica 
understands the USG view that regional rotation is not 
enshrined in the UN Charter, but will be inclined to support 
an Asian candidate when it comes to selecting the next 
Secretary General.  Foremost among the GOCR's reasons for 
 
SIPDIS 
adhering to the unwritten policy of regional rotation is the 
expectation that soon it will be Latin America's "turn," and 
any change to the system could jeopardize the region's 
chances of ever attaining the office.  Chaverri added that a 
new government takes power in Costa Rica on May 8, and it is 
possible that GOCR views on the issue could change.
