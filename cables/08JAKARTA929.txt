¶1.  (U) On May 12, Poloff reviewed reftel points regarding 
UNSCR 1803 (in reference to Iran and its nuclear program) and 
the 60-Day Report with Andy Rachmianto, Deputy Director for 
International Security and Disarmament at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU).  Poloff noted that the United States 
had submitted its report and asked what steps Indonesia had 
taken in that direction. 
 
¶2.  (U) Rachmianto said DEPLU had held an interagency meeting 
in late March to socialize the provisions of the resolution 
and the reporting process.  A report had been completed and 
DEPLU had forwarded this to the Indonesian UN Mission in New 
York during the week of May 5.  With this report, Indonesia 
had fulfilled its obligations under UNSCR 1803, Rachmianto 
said.
