SHERIF EL SAID - CASE NO.2001 
 
REF: STATE 99501 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Poloff met with 
registered broker Sherif El Said, President of TETCO.  His 
brother Hassouna El Said (Vice President) and son Mahmoud El 
Said (Program Manager) also attended the meeting. He 
confirmed that he was authorized by the Egyptian Ministry of 
Defense to conduct brokering activities in Egypt.  TETCO 
began operations in 1978 and has 15 employees.  The company 
provides consulting and technical support for the Ministry of 
Defense, including providing maintenance for radio systems 
and communications switches for the Navy Signal and Army 
Signal Departments.  Apart from providing on-site maintenance 
for the equipment, El Said said the company does not 
physically handle any of the equipment.  The American 
manufacturer DRS ships the equipment directly to the Egyptian 
military.  If any parts need off-site repairs or replacement, 
the Egyptian military ships the equipment directly to the 
manufacturer.  El Said confirmed that he was familiar with 
restrictions on USML items, including the unauthorized 
re-transfer and re-export of items. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) El Said said the Egyptian military was his only 
client for sensitive equipment like switches.  The firm also 
does some commercial telecommunications work for private 
companies, but only involving items that are not on the 
United States Munitions List.
