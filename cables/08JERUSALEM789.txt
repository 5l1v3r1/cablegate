Main Stories:

The May 11 visit by Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to the 
West Bank cities of Nablus and Jenin is good news on all front 
pages.  Fayyad, shown surrounded by smiling residents, confirms that 
he is happy with the results of recent security missions to the 
cities in which Palestinian Authority security forces were sent to 
enforce law and order.  Fayyad also reveals that the Palestinian 
Authority has arranged for additional training of Palestinian 
security forces, some of which will take place in Jordan.  On a 
different topic, Fayyad stresses the importance of the upcoming 
economic investors conference in Bethlehem stating that, "the 
success of this conference is of great importance to the Palestinian 
Authority especially since [there is] ...international 
participation," according to coverage.  In other economic news, 
Al-Ayyam reports that Fayyad confirmed Palestinian government 
approval of funding for 200 development projects, "in support of 
people in areas affected by the wall." 
 
The front pages of the three dailies carry extensive coverage on the 
shortage of electricity in Gaza.  The dailies highlight that more 
than 800,000 people in the Gaza Strip will experience a second night 
without electricity.  The Gaza Strip's sole power plant shut down 
due to a lack of fuel on May 11 and no bread was available when 
bakeries were forced to stop operation, according to reports. 
Related stories in all dailies warned of, "humanitarian, health and 
environmental crises due to electricity cuts," however the dailies 
differ in their reporting on whether or not Israel will resume oil 
supplies on May 12. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page reports that Israeli Premier Olmert, "promises 
that he will remain in office to continue leading efforts towards 
peace."  The paper also records that American businessman Morris 
Talansky has confirmed that he has contributed to Olmert's election 
campaigns. 
 
Al-Quds' front page reports on the questioning of Palestinian 
presidential advisors on Jerusalem affairs by the Israeli police on 
May 11.  The story explains that Adnan Al-Husseini and Hatim 
Abdul-Qadir were held for three hours before being released. 
Related front page coverage in all papers, highlights a statement by 
jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouthi calling for, "early 
legislative elections and the formation of a national government." 
Barghouthi added that, "the right of return cannot be compromised." 
 
Citing wire stories, the dailies continue to carry factual coverage 
on the Lebanon crisis.  Al-Ayyam reports that the death toll from 
the latest militant clashes had reached 42.

Developments in Gaza receive extensive coverage in the papers with 
several front-page stories reporting on the temporary opening for 
three days of the Rafah Gaza/Egypt border crossing to allow 550 
patients to travel to Egypt for treatment.  Other stories highlight 
the shutting down of the Gaza power plant for lack of fuel, leaving 
over 35 percent of the Gaza Strip without electricity, according to 
officials at the plant.  In other news, the dailies report that 
Egyptian Intelligence Chief Omar Suleiman will visit Israel tomorrow 
to follow up on efforts for an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire agreement 
 
JERUSALEM 00000789  002 OF 003 
 
 
between Israel and Hamas. 
 
"Western Official: The Bush administration will sustain peace 
efforts despite [Israeli Premier] Olmert's investigation," is a 
highlighted headline in both Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida. 
Citing a Reuters' story, the reports quote an "unnamed official" 
that this matter is an Israeli internal affair and that the U.S. 
will continue to assist the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a 
peace agreement by the end of the year.  Other front-page reports 
note that Olmert's party is facing a critical and decisive time 
because of his corruption charges. Al-Quds reporting on May 10 leads 
with a quote from chief Palestinian negotiator Quray that, "the 
peace process is not dependent on Olmert" and President Abbas 
considers this is an internal Israeli issue." 
 
The dailies cite a WAFA report that the PLO has signed an agreement 
with the Sudanese government for the latter to absorb 2,000 
Palestinian refugees currently stranded on the Iraqi-Syrian border. 
The agreement, which was coordinated with UNRWA, will open the way 
for immediate transport of the refugees to the Sudan, according to 
the report.

Saturday, May 10

Black headlines announce the killing of five Palestinians in Gaza on 
May 9 in an Israeli rocket attack, according to the three dailies. 
The coverage also mentions the death of an Israeli in a Gaza mortar 
attack on southern Israel.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida rounds out reporting 
with news that Israeli settlers killed a young Palestinian near 
Ramallah on May 9. 
 
The PLO convened an emergency meeting to discuss developments in 
Lebanon, forming a special committee to follow and report on events. 
 Palestinian President Abbas repeated his call on Lebanese parties 
to dialogue.  He further called upon Palestinians in Lebanon to be a 
unifying force and not become party to the conflict.  Al-Quds 
highlights Washington discussions on possible responses to Hizbollah 
and its allies while also noting Hamas statements that Israel is the 
only beneficiary of the "internal turbulence" in Lebanon. 
 
Peaceful demonstrations by Palestinians against the wall captures a 
front page headline in Al-Quds which reports on demonstrations held 
in Bethlehem and surrounding villages.  Coverage accompanies a photo 
of Palestinian children holding the Palestinian flag and blocking 
the advance of Israeli soldiers.  Dozens of people were reported 
injured by the Israelis, including two children.  In related 
reporting, Al-Ayyam runs a photo of children in Ramallah carrying 
symbolic keys in a peaceful demonstration to commemorate al Nakba 
(the catastrophe).

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Al-Quds independent carries an op-ed by veteran columnist Faisal 
Abu-Khadra entitled, "Sixty years after the catastrophe... 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are at a stand-still" (5/12): 
"Almost fifteen years have passed since the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement [Oslo] and Israel is still the only winner, while the 
Palestinians cause faces deterioration.  If we review the points of 
the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, we see that the declaration of 
principles has beautiful wording, but without any commitment from 
 
JERUSALEM 00000789  003 OF 003 
 
 
the Israeli side.  [at that time] The Israeli Government and the 
Palestinian team are in agreement that the time is right to end 
centuries of confrontation and conflict and to recognize each 
others' legitimate rights; to work on living peacefully together in 
dignity. ... It is unfortunate that Israel is increasing its demands 
and conditions on us when we have done more than what Israel asked 
for.  Without a doubt, the Palestinian negotiator is responsible for 
half of what has happened to the cause in terms of compromise, while 
the other half is due to Israeli arrogance.  Sixty years have passed 
since the catastrophe... but all injustice has an end.  And the end 
is coming soon for the dreams of the Palestinian people." 
 
¶2. Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by veteran columnist Samih 
Shbaib entitled, "Beirut events" (5/12): "what happened in Beirut a 
few days ago is not an accident and not a snap reaction to the 
decisions of the government. ... it is part of Iranian efforts to 
expand influence at the expense of Arab and Egyptian authority. 
What happened [was a] surprise for all Lebanese, who never expected 
for a moment that Hizbollah would take control of Beirut by militant 
means. This will turn things upside-down and completely change the 
rules of the game... "
