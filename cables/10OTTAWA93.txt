Â¶1. (C/NF) In a discussion with Deputy Pol/C on February 25, Michael 
Kaduck, Director of Peace Operations and Fragile States at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), 
dismissed the idea of contributing a Canadian formed police unit 
(FPU) for Haiti.  He noted that Canada had encountered significant 
difficulties in finding the 60 extra recently pledged civilian 
police officers, the list of whom Canada recently had forwarded to 
the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  He elaborated 
further that DFAIT "would not recommend under any circumstances" 
providing Canadian FPUs for MINUSTAH because it would be an 
"egregious misuse of resources."   Kaduck emphasized that FPUs tend 
to "spend a lot of time in the barracks" until some public order 
situation arises and that is not a "rational use" of "fantastically 
expensive" and "highly skilled" Canadian police officers.   Kaduck 
was adamant that if he had an extra 140 Canadian police--which he 
stressed he does not--he would use them as CIVPOL mentors and 
trainers, rather than as garrison-based FPUs. 
 
 
 
2 (C/NF)  Kaduck underscored that DFAIT was much more inclined to 
discuss how Canada might train and equip third countries to stand 
up their own FPUs for service in Haiti.  He  observed that Canada 
has already trained and equipped three francophone African-nation 
FPUs for assignment with UNAMID in Darfur, and they might be 
willing to explore that option with MINUSTAH.  He cautioned that he 
does not "know the upper limit of how many potential FPUs are 
actually out there to deploy to Haiti."  He noted that deploying 20 
FPUs would "actually require 60-20 in the field, 20 preparing to 
go, and 20 just returning."  Kaduck shared that any new Canadian 
initiative of this magnitude would require a ministerial 
initiative, perhaps even the Prime Minister, to go forward.  He 
suggested that it would likely require a "high level ask" by 
"senior U.S. counterparts."
