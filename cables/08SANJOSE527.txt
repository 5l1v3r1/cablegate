¶1. On June 17, we met with MFA's Juan Salas and Deyanira 
Ramirez, UNSC and UN Desk Officers respectively, to deliver 
reftel points. They had a copy of SYG Ban's UNMIK report with 
them, and Salas told us that concerning the reorganization 
initiative, the GOCR was "on the same page" as the U.S. 
Ramirez added that while they had not yet sent formal 
instructions to their mission in New York, they had no 
problem with the plan. 
 
¶2. Ramirez pointed out that Costa Rica was one of the first 
countries to recognize Kosovo's independence (Ref B). She 
said that Kosovo was a sovereign nation and that its 
constitution, which entered into force on June 15, called for 
UNMIK to handle only residual matters. She indicated that 
Costa Rica respected that Kosovars themselves were calling 
for UNMIK's role to change.
