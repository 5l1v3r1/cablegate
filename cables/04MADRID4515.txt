SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR COLLOCATION WAIVER FOR FAS OFFICES - 
MISSION MADRID 
 
REF: 12 FAH-5 H-300 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In accordance with guidance provided in reference, 
Mission Spain RSO submits this formal request for a 
collocation waiver for the critically needed Foreign 
Agricultural Service (FAS) offices.  This new lease space is 
required and has been prompted by RSO concern for the 
existing building's negative street setback, and the 
subsequent OIG Inspection emphasizing the same concerns as 
formal recommendations. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) EXEMPTION CATEGORIES: 
 
Under 12 FAH-5 H-312, the exemption that pertains to the 
inability to provide for FAS collocation within the Chancery 
is category number 5, "offices or activities which require 
space in excess of available and suitable chancery space." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) EXEMPTION CRITERIA: 
 
A - Post management, including the Chief of Mission and the 
RSO concurs on the need for and selection of this new 
facility and the need for a collocation waiver. 
 
B - FAS has addressed the issue and their headquarters and 
on-site management all concur. 
 
C - The number of direct-hire U.S. citizens assigned to the 
FAS office is commensurate with the staffing requirements and 
manpower authorizations to properly support the office and 
its activities. 
 
D - All applicable required physical security standards will 
be met prior to occupancy. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) EXEMPTION NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES: 
 
A - POST/OFFICE INVOLVED - American Embassy Madrid, Foreign 
Agricultural Service. 
 
B - LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION - The building is located 
approximately three block from the existing Chancery at Pinar 
6, on the second floor of a seven 
Floor building.  According to GSO a Spanish national, Maria 
Pilar Prado, owns property.  The building is standard Spanish 
construction described by the Embassy Facilities Office as 
poured concrete, reinforced with rebar.  There are no steel 
beams installed, in that, this is not a standard office 
building, rather an apartment building retrofitted to house 
both residences and offices. 
 
The proposed office space is located on the interior of the 
building with no windows facing the street.  There is 
approximately 100 feet of set back on the back side of the 
building but much less on the front faade that sits on a 
public street.  It has an underground 
parking garage that has access control systems in the form of 
garage door openers for occupants of the building. 
 
The windows are non-laminated glass and there is one 
stairwell for egress that ends at the lobby. 
 
Access control to the building is by occupant owned keys and 
a doorman who works intermittent hours during the day and 
evening.  There is no fire alarm system throughout the 
building. 
 
C - EXEMPTION CATEGORY/REASONS - See above. 
 
D - SUPPORTING CONCURRENCE DOCUMENTATION - The Mission/FAS 
cable supportive of this request will follow SEPTEL, 
referencing this cable. 
 
E - PHYSICAL SECURITY STANDARDS FOR OCCUPANCY - See above. A 
comprehensive Physical Security Survey will follow via SEPTEL. 
 
F - USE/STORAGE OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL - No classified 
material will be handled, processed, discussed or stored in 
this facility in accordance with OSPB security standards. 
 
¶5.  (U)  EXCEPTION  REQUEST PROCEDURES 
 
Standard Involved: 
 
Post requests a waiver and exception for setback for the 
proposed FAS Office Space. 
 
Justification: 
Typical preexisting construction in metropolitan Madrid does 
not provide setback of 100 feet.  Additionally, the office 
space FAS is considering is located on the interior of the 
building offering improved protection to occupants and 
visitors to the office. 
 
Statement of agency operation requirements; 
FAS Madrid is requesting the exception/waiver for their new 
commercial office space.  A cable from FAS HQ has been 
requested and FAS Madrid ensures post that funding will be 
provided for all RSO required physical security upgrades. 
FAS Madrid further ensures that they will 
not occupy the new office space until all physical security 
upgrades have been completed, and 
they understand that the waiver/exception will not be granted 
until receipt of written concurrence from 
FAS HQ. 
 
Survey Report: Will be sent via pouch and will include 
description of building, city map, neighborhood map, property 
plot plan, proposed office space layout, permits (if 
applicable), photographs, and COM and RSO statements and 
recommendations.
