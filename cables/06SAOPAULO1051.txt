Leading national circulation daily liberal Folha de S. Paulo (9/30) 
editorialized: "Affronting the spirit of the US constitution, the 
American Congress approved a new version of the Detainees Act, 
thereby giving the President the power to define who the 'enemy 
fighters' are and take them to special military courts, which may 
use 'secret' evidences and, in certain cases, obtain confessions 
through torture. The approval gives President George W. Bush power 
to determine which interrogatory techniques may be used.... It is 
evident that such proceedings are unacceptable in the rule of law. 
After all, all principles that make a judicial system civilized were 
ignored or at least harshly restricted. What is most disturbing, 
however, is to recognize that the new package of abominations Bush 
presented is nothing more than a clumsy attempt to cheat the Supreme 
Court, which had judged unconstitutional several aspects of the 
first version of the anti-terrorism act.... Let's hope that the 
Supreme Court examines once again the Detainees Act, now in its 2006 
version, and rejects it. The greatness of the US democracy consists 
in its checks and balances system."
