EFFORT 
 
¶1.  Speed, professionalism, effectiveness:  those qualities 
exemplified the extraordinary effort put forth by our EUCOM, 
CENTCOM and TRANSCOM military brethren and our State and DOD 
civilian colleagues in providing urgently needed military 
assistance to Lebanon's fledgling armed forces in their time 
of dire need.  On behalf of the entire U.S. Embassy team in 
Beirut, I want to extend my thanks for the incredibly quick 
and effective work undertaken by our military and civilian 
colleagues who are involved in the rapid responsiveness to 
the Lebanese Armed Forces' needs. 
 
¶2.  On May 20, well-armed Sunni fundamentalist extremists 
launched a violent attack against Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) 
that were stationed outside the Nahr al-Barid refugee camp in 
northern Lebanon.  The already over-stretched Lebanese army 
troops were poorly equipped to confront this serious threat 
to Lebanon's stability and sovereignty.  Following urgent 
consultations between U.S. Embassy Beirut and the Government 
of Lebanon, a list of critically-needed equipment was drawn 
up and forwarded to Washington. 
 
¶3.  Displaying unprecedented speed of response, the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense, in concert with applicable 
components of the European Command and Central Command, 
organized and executed an airlift of 22 C-17 flights which, 
in a matter of days, delivered desperately needed munitions 
and associated equipment to LAF troops engaged in fierce 
hostilities against a determined and well-supplied foe.  With 
the LAF now facing some of the most critical battles, these 
efforts are continuing.  In the execution of this operation, 
the U.S. Transportation Command also performed brilliantly 
and deserves special recognition.  Our colleagues at the 
State Department also played critical, essential roles in 
facilitating these shipments.  Bravo to all of you. 
 
¶4.  Although the extremely important battle at Nahr al-Barid 
still hangs in the balance, we have already received numerous 
statements of appreciation and admiration from both the 
Lebanese Armed Forces and the political leadership of Lebanon 
for the U.S. military assistance over the past three weeks. 
Accordingly, when the history of these critical days is 
written, justice will be served only if proper acknowledgment 
is given to the men and women of the U.S. military and to the 
civilian employees of State and DOD who participated in this 
pivotal and superbly-executed supply effort. 
 
¶5.  I am both deeply impressed and deeply grateful.  The LAF 
is engaged in a battle that it cannot afford to lose, and our 
assistance can help tip the balance in the LAF's favor. 
Please accept our most sincere thanks for a job well done!
