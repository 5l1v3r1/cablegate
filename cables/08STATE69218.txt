SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050108543 
 
REF: 06 SAN JOSE 1586 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050108543 for the export of 
rifles to Costa Rica. Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: End-user, Importadora de Armas Martin 
Armar, was previously subject to an unfavorable Blue Lantern 
end-use monitoring check (reftel) in which it was found to be 
a straw purchaser for unreliable Costa Rican company, Armeria 
Rex (reftel). This end-use monitoring check is to verify the 
bona fides of the end-user. 
 
¶4. Action Request: End-user, Importadora de Armas Martin 
Armar, was previously subject to an unfavorable Blue Lantern 
end-use monitoring check (reftel) in which it was found to be 
a straw purchaser for unreliable Costa Rican company, Armeria 
Rex. However, Post found that Importadora de Armas Martin 
Armar had other legitimate customers. Post is requested to 
establish the bona fides of the end-user by making 
appropriate inquires to representatives of the company. Post 
is also requested to determine the nature of Importadora de 
Armas Martin Armar's current relationship with Armeria Rex 
and/or its principles. 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
