ABDUCTEES IN SOUTHERN SUDAN 
 
REF: 09 KHARTOUM 1405 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On January 5, SPLA Director for Military 
Intelligence Major General John Lat Zakeria briefed us on the 
movements and whereabouts of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 
Sudan.  He explained that while there had been a presence of LRA in 
Southern Sudan, the majority of LRA were now in Southern Darfur and 
the Central African Republic (CAR).  Also on January 5, UN Deputy 
Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Lise Grande told us that 
UNMIS had been requested by DPKO in New York to look into the 
presence of 450-600 LRA abductees in Southern Sudan.  If present in 
Sudan, UNMIS was requested to rescue and transport the abductees 
back to their countries of origin.  The request was made to the UN 
in New York by the Fellowship of Christian Councils & Churches in 
the Great Lakes & Horn of Africa (FECCLAHA) along with Dr. 
Nyekorach-Matsang, LRA/M Peace Representative and Anton Baare, 
Nordic Consulting Group (NCG) Denmark.  UNMIS Deputy Security 
Advisor Lee Peterson visited Western Bahr el-Ghazal to verify 
reports of the LRA presence.  End Summary.

¶2. (SBU) On January 5, SPLA Director for Military Intelligence 
General John Lat Zakeria briefed us on current LRA movements and 
locations.  He explained that the SPLA had killed three LRA 
fighters west of Bor Medina in Western Bahr el-Ghazal early in 
January, but that the majority of LRA had moved north into southern 
Darfur.  In particular, he alleged that the LRA had established a 
large camp of 350-400 fighters and "family" members or abductees 
south-west of Kafia Kingi and another 70-100 LRA fighters were in 
Am Dafok.  Zakeria also told us that the SPLA believed the 
janjaweed have a training camp in Am Dafok under the guidance of 
notorious janjaweed leader Ali Kosheif (Note: Ali Kosheif was 
indicted by the International Criminal Court in 2007 on charges of 
committing war crimes in Darfur and currently remains at large in 
West Darfur).  Zakaria alleges the 70-100 LRA are possibly training 
with 200 janjaweed in Am Dafok.

¶3. (SBU) Also on January 5, UN Deputy Resident and Humanitarian 
Coordinator Lise Grande told us that UNMIS had been tasked by UN 
Headquarters to verify the presence and release of 450-600 Lords 
Resistance Army (LRA) abductees, ex-combatants and family members 
in Western Bahr el-Ghazal and Northern Bahr el-Ghazal states.  In 
December, the Fellowship of Christian Councils & Churches in the 
Great Lakes & Horn of Africa (FECCLAHA) sent letters to the UN 
Mission in the Congo (MONUC) as well as UN Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) in New York requesting that the UN 
assist in the humanitarian release of LRA abductees in Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Southern Sudan.  Additionally, Dr. 
Nyekorach-Matsang, LRA/M Peace Representative and Anton Baare, 
Nordic Consulting Group (NCG) Denmark also met with LRA 
representatives and the UN to raise their concerns and need for 
UNMIS involvement in their release. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Grande explained that the group along with Baare and 
Matsang had been lobbying for UN assistance with the LRA since 
September 2009.  The group recently approached UN DPKO leadership 
in NY stating that the LRA abductees were mostly in Raja and Aweil 
counties.  Grande explained to us that the UN had no information 
 
KHARTOUM 00000076  002 OF 002 
 
 
about an LRA presence in Southern Sudan, but due to the pressure of 
Baare and Matsang they were forced to investigate. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) We explained to Grande and later to UN Deputy Security 
Advisor Lee Peterson that while the LRA was believed to have been 
present in Western Bahr el-Ghazal in late November and December, 
the numbers had always been small.  As previously reported (see 
reftel), the LRA had been present in areas along the border of 
Western Bahr el-Ghazal and the Central African Republic, but only 
to pillage nearby villages for supplies and resources and stage a 
few circumstances abductions.  At no time was there reliable 
information that the LRA had a presence in Aweil, Northern Bahr 
el-Ghazal.

¶6. (SBU) On January 7-8, Peterson traveled to Raja and Bor Medina 
in Western Bahr el-Ghazal to meet with SPLA present in the region. 
The last reported attack or presence of LRA in the area was 
December 17 outside of Bor Medina, they claimed.  Along the border, 
the SPLA had also found a number of abandoned LRA camps.  They 
believe the camps held 60-70 fighters and approximately 300 
abductees, however they have since been abandoned.  Peterson spoke 
to UN colleagues and SPLA present in Aweil, who reported that there 
were no LRA present in the area.  Peterson responded to UN DPKO in 
New York stating that the LRA and abductees were no longer present 
in Southern Sudan; however, it was believed they are currently 
present in Southern Darfur and CAR. 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment. We are not convinced that the LRA is yet present 
in any significant number in Darfur, and we do not judge that their 
presence nearby has tipped the military balance in the Darfur area.
