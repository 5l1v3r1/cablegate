¶1. SECRETARY CHU AND LOCKE VISIT 
 
"China and the U.S. should face the climate challenge together" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(07/16): "The 
constructive meaning of Secretary Chu and Secretary Locke's China 
visits is that differences have been put aside and China and the 
U.S. are seeking a way out of the climate issue.  Both countries 
want to protect their competence which is why agreement is hard to 
reach.  The critical issues of whether the two countries can 
transform the crisis of climate change into an opportunity are: the 
ability of the two countries to develop jointly new clean energy 
markets while no longer protecting the old, polluting economic 
development model.  The traditional means used to protect competence 
are trade barriers.  If the U.S. implements a carbon tariff, 
traditional polluting enterprises will be safe while the opportunity 
to stimulate renewable energy industry will be lost.  Over-criticism 
of Chinese products that they are bad for the environment is 
overlooking the potential of China's new energy industry.  Since 
President Obama took office, it has been the major breakthrough for 
global climate negotiations that the U.S. has taken responsibility 
for emission decrease.  The U.S. should realize that the solution to 
shared climate concerns is broad cooperation on clean energy rather 
than another round of trade barriers." 
 
¶2. XINJIANG RIOT 
 
"Rabiya [Kabeer] wants to seek help from the Dalai [Lama]" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/16): "A letter from the World Uyghur 
Congress has been publicized by the Dalai [Lama], seeking his help. 
Chinese experts indicate that it is ridiculous that the separatists 
would believe they can break apart China's territory by making up a 
country's name and asking for some help from the West.  In fact, 
they know it will be hard to make their dream become a reality. 
Their real goal is to produce chaos since chaos in China meets the 
West's interests and can help them to continue to live in the [minds 
of the] West.  China should also crack down on those Western leaders 
at the same time that they suppress Xinjiang independence followers. 
 Rabiya intended to take Dalai as the example, copying the Tibetan 
independence followers' methods, to conduct separation activities. 
The two groups of independence followers have had the more obvious 
trend of getting closer after the 7/5 incident.  Xinjiang 
independence followers have had much smaller influence in the world 
than Tibet separatists.  They have tried every measure to increase 
its influence.  Chinese scholars called on a thorough investigation 
of these methods. Like President Bush said after the 9/11 incident, 
whoever stands against us is our enemy. China should indicate that 
the Westerners and Western media who stand at the side of terrorists 
harming Chinese people's lives are our enemies.  The Dalai's low 
profile indicates he is assessing the situation.  It is possible 
that he will make moves later." 
 
¶3. STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC DIALOGUE PREVIEW 
 
"High technology trade and carbon tariff will be on top of the 
S&ED's agenda" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(07/16): "Zhou Shijian, a senior 
research fellow of the Center for U.S.-China Relations at Tsinghua 
University slightly jokingly said, "It's better for China to buy $1 
trillion of technology than $1 trillion of U.S. treasury bonds.   We 
can also ask the U.S. to maintain a stable U.S. dollar," Zhou said. 
The prospect of a large clean energy market in China is an 
opportunity that the U.S. must not overlook and that the U.S. could 
use to simulate the real economy's recovery. Europe is also seeking 
a larger Chinese market in clean energy and high technology, which 
has also increased China's negations chip with the U.S.  Since the 
carbon tariff issue has arisen, China's attitude has been clear that 
trade issues can't be bounded together with climate change issues. 
The carbon tariff is trade protection behavior in the name of 
environmental protection.  It will disturb the international trade 
order and trigger a trade war.  Associate Professor in International 
Trade at the University of International Business and Economics 
(UIBE), Cui Fan pointed that, America's motivation for a "carbon 
tariff" comes from their highly developed manufacturing areas. 
Thus, the carbon tariff has the strong purpose of trade protection. 
But both Secretary Chu and Secretary Locke did not mention carbon 
tariffs in public during their visit.  The visit aims at making 
contacts with China.  Thus their comments will be 'artful.'  The 
result of negotiation might be: in the end, the main developing

countries including China may take on duties of reasonably 
quantified emission, decreasing emissions, in exchange for the 
technological support of developed countries and their promise for 
not implementing carbon tariffs."
