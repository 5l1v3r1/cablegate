REF: SECSTATE 94522 
 
Â¶1. As per reftel request, the approval process for marine 
scientific research vessels is handled by Econ Specialist Ana 
Maria Waflar and Econ Officer Lourdes Lamela (estimated 
departure 4/09).  The Government of Spain requires a 6- month 
lead time notification for any research vessel which wishes 
to conduct research within Spain's EEZ waters.  Requests that 
are not made in compliance with that 6-month time frame can 
not be guaranteed a response prior to the research dates. 
However, in the past, the GOS has been extremely cooperative 
with Post on short-notice visits.
