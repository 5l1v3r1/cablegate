¶1.  (SBU)  Embassy Kinshasa delivered talking points 
regarding anti-Israeli bias in UNGA resolutions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Minister Plenipotentiary Alice Bamba Kipembe, 
Deputy Director for International Organizations at the DRC 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, said the DRC had previously 
abstained on this issue instead of voting "no" because the 
Congolese had seen progress in the Middle East political 
situation.  She said they would consider current conditions 
before making a decision on this vote. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  We will follow up with the Ministry and report any 
future response or change in position.
