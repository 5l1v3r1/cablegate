Â¶1. (C) Political Counselor delivered reftel demarche November 
25 to Ambassador Goncalo de Barros Carvalho e Mello Mourao, 
director of the Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean 
Department at the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.  Morao said 
that Brazil had expressed in the OAS its "apprehensiveness" 
with regard to the results of the Nicaraguan municipal 
elections, but also reiterated that Brazil has "confidence" 
that Nicaraguan civil society is best placed to manage the 
follow-up process in the most suitable manner.  At present, 
he said, it would be "difficult" for Brazil to take 
additional action as urged reftel, but added that the 
Brazilian government would be following developments closely. 
 Mourao agreed that it was important for the Nicaraguan 
government to understand that the region was concerned and 
noted that the Rio Group might be preparing a statement.
