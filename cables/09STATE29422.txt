SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - YEMEN 
 
¶1. The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the 
high security threat level in Yemen due to terrorist 
activities.  The Department recommends that American 
citizens defer non-essential travel to Yemen.  American 
citizens remaining in Yemen despite this warning should 
monitor the U.S. Embassy website at 
http://yemen.usembassy.gov and should make contingency 
emergency plans.  This replaces the Travel Warning for 
Yemen issued September 17, 2008, to update information 
on security incidents and travel restrictions for U.S. 
Embassy personnel. 
¶2. The security threat level remains high due to 
terrorist activities in Yemen.  On the morning of 
September 17, 2008 armed terrorists attacked the U.S. 
Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen.  A number of explosions 
occurred in the vicinity of the Embassy's main gate. 
Several Yemeni security personnel and one Embassy 
security guard were killed, as were a few individuals 
waiting to gain entry to the Embassy, one of whom was a 
U.S. citizen. 
¶3. U.S. Embassy employees have been advised to exercise 
caution when choosing restaurants, hotels or visiting 
tourist areas in Sanaa in order to avoid large 
gatherings of foreigners and expatriates.  Only limited 
travel outside of the capital is authorized at this 
time. 
 
¶4. U.S. citizens who travel to or remain in Yemen 
despite this warning should exercise caution and take 
prudent security measures, including maintaining a high 
level of vigilance, avoiding crowds and demonstrations, 
keeping a low profile, varying times and routes for all 
travel, and ensuring travel documents are current. 
American citizens in Yemen are advised to exercise 
particular caution at locations frequented by foreigners 
countrywide, including restaurants and hotels frequented 
by expatriates.  From time to time, the Embassy may 
restrict official Americans from restaurants, hotels, or 
shopping areas.  The Department of State strongly 
encourages American citizens to consult the most recent 
Warden Messages 
(http://yemen.usembassy.gov/yemen/citizen_ser vices.html) 
to get up-to-date information on security conditions. 
Americans who believe they are being followed or 
threatened while driving in urban centers should proceed 
as quickly as possible to the nearest police station or 
major intersection and request assistance from the 
officers in the blue-and-white police cars stationed 
there. 
 
¶5. The Department remains concerned about possible 
attacks by extremist individuals or groups against U.S. 
citizens, facilities, businesses, and perceived 
interests.  On March 15, 2009, four South Korean 
tourists were killed in a suicide bomb attack in the 
city of Shibam in southern Hadramout province.  On March 
18, 2009, a South Korean motorcade was attacked by a 
suicide bomber near Sana'a International Airport.  On 
January 17, 2008, suspected al-Qa'ida operatives 
ambushed a tourist convoy in the eastern Hadramout 
Governorate, killing two Belgians.  On July 2, 2007, 
suspected al-Qa'ida operatives carried out a vehicle- 
borne explosive device attack on tourists at the Belquis 
Temple in Marib, which resulted in the deaths of eight 
Spanish tourists and two Yemenis.  The targeting of 
tourist sites by al-Qa'ida may represent an escalation 
in terror tactics in Yemen.  On February 3, 2006, 23 
convicts, including known affiliates of al-Qa'ida, 
escaped from a high-security prison in Sanaa, some of 
whom remain at large.  Two of the escapees were killed 
in vehicle-based suicide attacks on oil facilities near 
Mukalla and Marib on September 15, 2006.  Those attacks 
 
STATE 00029422  002 OF 002 
 
 
were followed by the arrest the next day in Sanaa of 
four suspected al Qa'ida operatives, who had stockpiled 
explosives and weapons. 
 
¶6. The Government of Yemen has been battling al Houthi 
rebels in and around the northern governorate of Saada 
intermittently since 2004.  While foreigners have not 
been targeted, hundreds of soldiers and civilians have 
been killed in the violence.  U.S. citizens traveling in 
Yemen should be aware that local authorities 
occasionally place restrictions on the travel of 
foreigners to parts of the country experiencing unrest. 
In addition, the U.S. Embassy itself often restricts 
travel of official personnel to the tribal areas north 
and east of Sanaa, such as the governorates of Amran, Al 
Jawf, Hajja, Marib, Saada, and Shabwa.  Travelers should 
be in contact with the Embassy for up-to-date 
information on such restrictions. 
 
¶7. U.S. citizens should register at the Consular Section 
of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa and enroll in the warden 
system (emergency alert network) to obtain updated 
information on travel and security in Yemen.  This can 
be done online prior to arrival in Yemen at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs. 
 
¶8. The U.S. Embassy is located at Dhahr Himyar Zone, 
Sheraton Hotel District, P.O. Box 22347.  The telephone 
number of the Consular Section is (967) (1) 755-2000, 
extension 2153 or 2266.  The fax number is (967) (1) 
303-175.  The after-hours emergency number is (967) (1) 
755-2000 (press zero for extension) or (967) 733213509. 
From time to time the Embassy may temporarily close or 
suspend public services for security reasons.  Emergency 
assistance to U.S. citizens during non-business hours 
(or when public access is restricted) is available 
through Embassy duty personnel. 
¶9. Current information on travel and security in Yemen may 
be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1-888- 
407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, from 
outside the United States and Canada, 1-202-501-4444.  U.S. 
citizens should consult the Country Specific Information 
for Yemen and the Worldwide Caution on the Department's 
Internet site at http://travel.state.gov.  Up-to-date 
information on security conditions can also be addressed at 
http://yemen.usembassy.gov/yemen/citizen_serv ices.html. 
 
 
¶10. Minimize considered.
