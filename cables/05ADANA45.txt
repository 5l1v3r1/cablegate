SUBJECT: SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY FOR MARCH 3-4, 2005 
 
This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for March 3-4, 
¶2005.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
SABAH (GUNEY):  After the fake raki incident in Istanbul, 
observers noted that Adana's Hygiene and Health Institute 
Directorate does not own the equipment to test the genuineness 
of raki.  Sabah Guney reports this is a "scandal." 
 
CUMHURIYET:     During the funeral of Hasan Sigva, one of the most 
influential Naksibendi Sheikhs, thousands of people sang hymns 
and carried green flags (symbolizing "sharia," according to 
Cumhuriyet) in the Idil district of Sirnak. Reportedly attending 
the ceremony were Veli Seyda, Sirnak MP from AKP (Justice and 
Development Party); Resul Sadak, Idil Mayor; DEHAP (Democratic 
People's Party) leaders, and many fully veiled women. 
 
EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:        During raids conducted in seven 
villages in the Ozalp District of Van, twenty-eight villagers 
were taken into custody on the grounds that "they aided and 
abetted the outlawed organization."  (Note:  this refers to the 
PKK terrorist group.  End note.)  Instead of sending detainees 
to a hospital, medical checks were (allegedly) unlawfully 
performed at the police station, according to Dincel Aslan, the 
villagers' attorney. The villagers claimed they had been beaten 
and treated badly. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   In Yuksekova, Hakkari province, more than ten 
thousand people attended the funeral of Yilmaz Buldan, an HPG 
(People's Protection Forces) member who was allegedly captured 
wounded, and then (allegedly) killed by security forces in 
Mardin on February 23, 2005. 
 
MILLIYET / HURRIYET (CUKUROVA) / BOLGE / SABAH (GUNEY) / 
EKSPRES:        Abdulkadir Aksu, Minister of Internal Affairs, 
arrived in Adana to participate in a meeting called "Quality of 
Life Indicators."  During his visit, Mr. Aksu paid visits to the 
Office of the Governor, Adana Municipality, Jandarma Regional 
Command, and to Seyhan and Yuregir District Municipalities. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
¶1.      RADIKAL:        According to Radikal, the BTC 
(Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan Pipeline) project agreement stipulated that 
crude oil should begin to flow into tanks in Ceyhan (in Adana 
province) on May 10, 2005. Turkey is currently experiencing a 
delay in the construction of its section of the pipeline, which 
could postpone the flow into the Ceyhan tanks until late 
September 2005. 
 
¶2.      ZAMAN / HURRIYET (CUKUROVA) / BOLGE:    The "Brand Name 
is Power" meeting, the eighth in a series of meetings organized 
by Dogan Publications Co. about EU-related issues, was held 
yesterday (Wednesday) at Hilton Hotel and hosted by Adana 
Chamber of Industry. At the end of the meeting, CNN Turk channel 
broadcasted the problems of the people of Adana on a live TV 
program of a well-known journalist, Mehmet Ali Birand. 
 
¶3.      MILLIYET / TURKIYE / EKSPRES / HURRIYET (CUKUROVA) / BOLGE 
/ SABAH (GUNEY):         In the run-up to Chamber elections last week, 
Aytac Durak, Mayor Of Adana, had openly taken a tough stance 
against Umit Ozgumus' candidacy for re-election to the office of 
Chairman of the Adana Chamber of Industry (ACI).  Durak gave up 
his confrontational tone to shake hands with Ozgumus, who was 
re-elected. Fethi Coskuntuncel was re-elected as Chairman of 
Adana's Commodity of Exchange. In a competitive race for 
Chairmanship of the Adana Chamber of Commerce, Saban Bas faces 
his former Deputy Chair Halil Avci. 
 
¶4.      VAKIT / HURRIYET (CUKUROVA) / MILLIYET / RADIKAL:       The 
shipment of goods from the Mersin Port and the Mersin Free Trade 
Zone to the Habur Border Gate was temporarily suspended due to 
the congestion at the Gate.  State Minister Kursat Tuzmen stated 
that the inconvenient experiences at the Gate were caused by the 
Iraqi side's "inadequate management." Tuzmen added that, if 
there were no obstructions on the Iraq side of the border, 
congestion at the Gate would be eliminated within a week and the 
smooth flow of traffic would be resumed.
