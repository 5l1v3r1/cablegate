SUBJECT:  TURKMENISTAN:  STATE AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA HIGHLIGHT A/S 
SULLIVAN'S VISIT, POSITIVE RELATIONS WITH UNITED STATES 
 
 
¶1.  (U) State media positively highlighted U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State for Economic, Energy and Business Affairs Daniel Sullivan's 
participation in the August 13 inauguration ceremony of the 
Imamnazar border checkpoint on the Turkmen-Afghan border and his 
August 14 meeting with Turkmenistan's President.  Leading 
international news agencies carried Assistant Secretary Sullivan's 
speech from August 14 at the Ak Altyn Hotel in Ashgabat, in which he 
stressed "openness, economic integration, and partnership" with 
Turkmenistan. 
 
STATE MEDIA HIGHLIGHT SULLIVAN'S MEETING WITH TURKMEN LEADER 
 
¶2.  (U) On August 11, state dailies "Neutral Turkmenistan" (Russian, 
circ. 39,091) and "Turkmenistan" (Turkmen, circ. 28,091) gave 
front-page treatment to an article announcing the Sullivan 
delegation's arrival in Turkmenistan to participate in the opening 
ceremony of the "Imannazar" border crossing checkpoint between 
Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.  The article also noted that Sullivan 
expected to meet Turkmenistan's president. 
 
¶3.  (U) On August 14, "Watan" TV news program (Turkmen) praised 
President Berdimuhammedov's meeting with the U.S. delegation, headed 
by Assistant Secretary Sullivan, noting that the sides discussed a 
wide range of issues for cooperation, including partnership in the 
oil and gas sector.  The broadcast showed Sullivan's support for 
President Berdimuhammedov's intention to diversify its gas and oil 
export routes.  It also praised educational exchange programs to the 
United States.  Sullivan's comments were broadcast and translated 
accurately and carried in their entirety.  The same day, the 
pro-government website 'Turkmenistan.ru' posted a positive article 
on the meeting, praising Berdimuhamedov and Sullivan's support for 
diversifying the bilateral partnership.  The article was similar to 
the "Watan" TV news broadcast. The following day, state dailies 
"Neutral Turkmenistan" (Russian, circ. 39,091) and "Turkmenistan" 
(Turkmen, circ. 28,091) also published an article with similar 
content from "Watan" news.  In subsequent days, state weeklies 
"Balkan" (Turkmen, circ. 25,630), "Watan" (Turkmen, circ. 26,091), 
"Ahal Durmushy" (Turkmen, circ. 34.091) and "Esger" (Turkmen, circ. 
58,591) reprinted the article from state dailies.  The government 
news website 'Turkmenistan-Golden Age' (Russian, English and 
Turkmen) posted the dailies' article as well.  The Russian news 
agency 'ITAR-TASS' (Russian, English) also carried a favorable 
article on Sullivan's meeting with Turkmenistan's President. 
 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA CARRY SULLIVAN'S REMARKS ON NEED FOR ECONOMIC 
REFORMS IN TURKMENISTAN 
 
¶4.  (U) On August 14, news agencies Associated Press (AP) (English, 
Russian) and Reuters (English, Russian) covered Sullivan's remarks 
on transparency, rule-of-law, and transportation and communications 
links in advancing the development of Turkmenistan and other 
countries in the region.  AP and Reuters tended to focus their 
coverage on the energy trade issues.  AP reported Sullivan's visit 
came amid continued jockeying between the United States and Russian 
for influence in Turkmenistan and an apparent diplomatic push by 
Washington to seek backing for Trans-Caspian pipeline, which would 
circumvent export routes controlled by Russia.  Reuters reported 
that the United States urged Turkmenistan to diversify its energy 
export routes.  Both news agencies accurately carried Sullivan's 
statement that "Nations should never be left with only one option - 
one market, one trading partner, one vital infrastructure link." 
Sullivan's remarks, urging Turkmenistan to do more to fight 
corruption and improve its investment climate received positive 
coverage.  (NOTE: The news agencies carried quotes from the full 
text of Sullivan's August 14 remarks, which has been distributed to 
international stringers and posted on the Embassy website.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
MEDIA FAVORABLY CARRY SULLIVAN'S REMARKS FROM NEW BORDER CHECKPOINT 
OPENING CEREMONY 
 
¶5.  (U) On August 10, the Russia-based news agency 'Interfax' 
(Russian, English) reported on Sullivan's upcoming arival to attend 
the Imamnazar border crossing checkpoint opening ceremony.  The 
report noted that Sullivan was expected to hold a meeting with 
Turkmenistan's government officials on August 14.  'Interfax' 
repeated the same report on August 12 and 'Central Asia General 
 
ASHGABAT 00000983  002 OF 002 
 
 
Newswire' reprinted the 'Interfax' report. 
 
¶6.  (U) "Watan" TV news August 14 broadcast of the Imamnazar 
checkpoint's opening carried Sullivan's interview from the event. 
Sullivan emphasized the occasion had significant implications for 
Turkmenistan and the United States and noted that the United States 
wants to help with regional integration.  Similarily, state dailies 
"Neutral Turkmenistan" (Russian, circ. 39,091) and "Turkmenistan" 
(Turkmen, circ. 28,091) published an article on the opening, 
favorably noting Assistant Secretary Sullivan's remarks at the 
event.  News of the event was also posted on government news website 
'Turkmenistan-Golden Age' (Russian, English and Turkmen) 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COMMENT:  State media praised Assistant Secretary 
Sullivan's visit and took efforts to show President Berdimuhamedov's 
support for improved Turkmen-American relations.  Meanwhile, 
international news agencies such as the 'Associated Press' and 
'Reuters' characterized the event in the context of the United 
States competing with Russia over influence for Turkmenistan's 
energy resources.  The extensive and favorable coverage by state 
news media is an indication that the country's leadership continues 
to support a positive image of Turkmenistan's improving foreign 
relations, including with the United States.
