¶1. (SBU) On September 4, 2007, poloff raised reftel A points 
with Mr. Alle Dorhout, Chief of the Horn of Africa and West 
Africa Division at the MFA's Sub-Saharan Africa Department. 
Dorhout, on his second day on the job, expressed cautious 
interest in the proposed Intergovernmental Authority on 
Development (IGAD) Partners' Forum (IPF) ministerial.  He 
promised a more official reaction after consulting with his 
staff.  He noted that his boss, Dr. Wepke Kingma, was 
habitually skeptical of additional conferences and 
ministerials without results (reftel B). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Subsequently, Mr. Huub Buise, who works for Doorhout 
and covers the Horn of Africa, agreed that it would be a 
worthwhile message to reaffirm the importance of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement at the same time that we are 
trying to solve the Darfur crisis.  However, a "ministerial 
without ministers" would be harmful, so the timing / location 
of the meeting is a key issue to ensure appropriate 
participation.  Buise and Alle wondered about how this 
meeting might fit in with UN General Assembly schedule and 
the September 21 Sudan meeting.
