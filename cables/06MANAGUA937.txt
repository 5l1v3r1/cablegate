SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN CIVIL AVIATION BILL CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF 
 
¶1. (SBU) Nicaraguan National Assembly (NA) legislators 
confirm that the NA plans to vote on a civil aviation bill 
next week.  The bill passed on first reading in 2004, but the 
required second vote on individual articles has languished. 
Econoff discussed the bill with airline officials and the 
Nicaraguan Director of Civil Aviation.  The Ambassador 
recently met with a member of the Transportation Committee to 
encourage passage of the bill as well as elimination of 
non-free market provisions.  Post is optimistic that the new 
law will pave the way for Nicaragua to be declared a Category 
One country by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), 
serving as an economic and commercial boon in this sensitive 
election year. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Civil Aviation bill establishes an independent 
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for Nicaragua.  Currently, the 
Directorate of Civil Aviation is a subunit of the Ministry of 
Transportation (MTI).  The bill increases funding for civil 
aviation from US $700,000 a year to $1.2 million.    The bill 
will also update Nicaragua's Civil Aviation Code to bring it 
into compliance with International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) standards.  (Note: The Directorate of 
Civil Aviation - soon to be the CAA - generates an additional 
$250,000 a year from airport rent and other fees.  Also, the 
budget for the CAA was significantly increased in committee 
only after lobbying by econoff in 2004 at the behest of the 
Director of Civil Aviation.  End Note) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Several articles objectionable to both domestic and 
international air carriers were included in the original 
version of the bill.  Two of these provisions would violate 
the US-Nicaragua Air Transport Agreement of 1997 - - A 6% 
surcharge on all tickets that would be transferred to local 
travel agents, and a requirement that all fares (and their 
underlying economic rationales) be submitted to the GON 30 
days in advance for prior review.  After pressure from post, 
the airlines, and the tourism industry, it now appears that 
these articles will be stricken and an article stipulating 
that all elements of the new law must abide by international 
commitments will be added.  On April 25, Rosa Chavez, the 
General Director of American Airlines' Nicaragua office, told 
econoff that even if the objectionable provisions remain, the 
Nicaraguan Association of Airlines would prefer a flawed bill 
to no bill.
