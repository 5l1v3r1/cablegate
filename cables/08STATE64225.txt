SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - IRAQ 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning updates the current security 
situation and reiterates the dangers of the use of 
civilian aircraft and of road travel within Iraq.  This 
supersedes the Travel Warning of July 23, 2007. 
 
¶2.  The Department of State continues to strongly warn 
U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq, which remains very 
dangerous.  Remnants of the former Baath regime, 
transnational terrorists, criminal elements and numerous 
insurgent groups remain active throughout Iraq. 
Multinational Force-Iraq (MNF-I) and Iraqi Security Forces 
(ISF)-led military operations continue, and attacks 
persist against MNF-I and the ISF throughout the country. 
Turkish government forces have carried out operations 
against elements of the Kongra-Gel (KGK, formerly 
Kurdistan Worker's Party, or Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan 
(PKK)) terrorist group that are located along Iraq's 
northern border. 
 
¶3.  Despite recent improvements in the security 
environment, Iraq remains dangerous, volatile and 
unpredictable.  Attacks against military and civilian 
targets throughout Iraq continue, including in the 
International (or "Green") Zone.  Targets include hotels, 
restaurants, police stations, checkpoints, foreign 
diplomatic missions, and international organizations and 
other locations with expatriate personnel.  Such attacks 
can occur at any time.  Kidnappings still occur; the most 
recent kidnapping of an American citizen occurred in 
August 2007.  Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), 
Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs), and mines often are 
placed on roads, concealed in plastic bags, boxes, soda 
cans, dead animals, and in other ways to blend with the 
road.  Grenades and explosives have been thrown into 
vehicles from overpasses, particularly in crowded areas. 
Rockets and mortars have been fired at hotels, and 
vehicle-borne IEDs have been used against targets 
throughout the country.  Occasionally, U.S. Government 
personnel are prohibited from traveling to certain areas 
depending on prevailing security conditions.  In addition 
to terrorist and criminal attacks, sectarian violence 
occurs often.  Detailed security information is available 
on the Embassy's web site at (http://iraq.usembassy.gov) and 
at (http://www.centcom.mil). 
 
¶4.  Military aircraft arriving and departing from Baghdad 
International Airport (ORBI) have been subjected to small 
arms and missile fire.  Travelers choosing to utilize 
civilian aircraft to enter or depart Iraq should be aware 
that, although there have been no recent attacks on 
civilian aircraft, the potential threat still exists, as 
well as does the high risk to road transportation 
described above.  Official U.S. Government (USG) personnel 
are strongly encouraged to use U.S. military or other USG 
aircraft when entering or departing Iraq.  All personnel 
serving in Iraq under Chief of Mission (COM) authority are 
prohibited from entering or departing ORBI on commercial 
airlines unless approved by the Regional Security Office 
(RSO) on a case-by-case basis.  Other personnel not under 
COM authority must be guided by their own agency. 
 
¶5.  The Embassy is located in the International Zone.  The 
Embassy can provide only limited emergency services to 
U.S. citizens in Iraq.  The U.S. Government considers the 
potential threat to U.S. Government personnel assigned to 
Iraq sufficiently serious to require them to live and work 
under strict security restrictions.  At present, travel to 
and from the International Zone is extremely limited. 
Unofficial travel to Iraq by U.S. Government employees and 
their family members requires prior approval by the 
 
STATE 00064225  002 OF 002 
 
 
Department of State.  The U.S. Embassy does not provide 
visa services to the general public.  American citizens 
who choose to visit or reside in Iraq despite this Travel 
Warning are urged to take responsibility for their 
personal security, avoid crowds, especially rallies or 
demonstrations, and to inform the U.S. Embassy of their 
presence in Iraq.  All Americans in Baghdad are strongly 
encouraged to register with the Embassy at the following 
website: 
 
 https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/ui/ 
 
¶6.  American citizens may obtain the latest security 
information or other information about Iraq by contacting 
the U.S. Embassy, located in the International Zone, via 
landline at: 1-240-553-0589, via Iraqna cellular phones at 
07901-191-0058/57/56/54/53/52/49/48, via e-mail to 
baghdadacs@state.gov, or by accessing the U.S. Embassy's 
website at (http://iraq.usembassy.gov).  The after-hours 
numbers in cases of extreme emergency are Iraqna 07901- 
732-134 or GSM 914-822-1370. 
 
¶7.  Updated information on travel and security in Iraq may 
be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1-888- 
407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada, or for 
callers outside the United States, a regular toll-line at 
1-202-501-4444.  For further information, please consult 
the Country Specific Information for Iraq, as well as the 
Worldwide Caution, all of which are available on the 
Bureau of Consular Affairs Internet website at 
(http://travel.state.gov/). 
 
¶8.  Minimize considered.
