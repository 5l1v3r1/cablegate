SUBJECT: MARTINEZ CUENCA: ORTEGA MUST GO -- QUESTION IS HOW 
AND WHEN 
 
REF: MANAGUA 1210 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Alejandro Martinez Cuenca shared with Ambassador, 
DCM, and polcouns on June 6 his decision to continue his 
efforts to reform the Sandinista party (FSLN) and to 
challenge the FSLN "messianic" caudillo Daniel Ortega from 
within the party.  According to Martinez Cuenca, Ortega has 
deluded himself, most of the FSLN, and the media into 
believing that he is the party and the party is Ortega, 
thereby blocking any possible party reform.  He warned that 
Ortega enjoys the backing of much of the Catholic Church 
leadership, although not Archbishop Brenes' -- not only 
because of Cardinal Obando y Bravo's open endorsement -- but 
also due to the material support FSLN mayors have provided 
their local Catholic parishes.  Additionally, elaborated 
Martinez Cuenca, Ortega is banking on FSLN control of the 
Supreme Electoral Commission (CSE), high voter abstention 
among Nicaragua's majority anti-Ortega population, 
"palatable" Liberal dissident running mate Jaime Morales 
Carazo, Nicaragua's fractured Right, and the disciplined 
Sandinista vote. 
 
¶2.  (C) Martinez Cuenca, who was bounced from the FSLN's May 
28 Convention (for daring to challenge Ortega's candidacy and 
calling for primaries), told us that unless Ortega shows true 
signs of reform, which is highly unlikely, he will confront 
Ortega's candidacy again before October 8, when the CSE must 
send the November 5 ballots to print and parties cannot make 
further changes.  Martinez Cuenca reasoned that if by then 
Ortega is faring poorly in the polls, or if Ortega loses the 
election on the first round, the FSLN may press Ortega to 
withdraw his candidacy and then select him or another 
candidate to replace Ortega.  He explained that according to 
Nicaraguan law, in the event a presidential or vice 
presidential candidate resigns, the party may appoint a 
replacement.  (NOTE: According to Nicaragua's electoral law, 
in the case of the resignation of a presidential or 
vice-presidential candidate during the electoral process, the 
political party/alliance will choose a replacement.  The same 
process applies in 
the event of a presidential or vice-presidential candidate's 
resignation after the election and before a runoff.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (C) Martinez Cuenca acknowledged that Ortega continues to 
enjoy popularity among Sandinistas, in part because he has 
been able to control tensions among competing streams in the 
party and thereby limit their "belligerent" inclinations. 
Nonetheless, he claimed that discontent is growing among 
Sandinista rank and file, who are disaffected with Ortega's 
non-democratic control of the party.  Martinez Cuenca 
ventured that the combined Sandinista support for him and 
Herty Lewites easily totals 11% of the traditionally 
Sandinista vote -- possibly enough to prevent Ortega from 
winning on the first round (he estimated that Lewites draws 
5% - 7% of the hard Sandinista vote, while he attracts an 
additional 4% - 6%). 
 
¶4.  (C) Recounting how Lewites had offered him the vice 
presidency (Reftel), Martinez Cuenca explained that he had 
declined Lewites' offer because he believes he can achieve 
more by remaining in the FSLN -- and possibly replacing 
Ortega as the FSLN's candidate.  Further, Lewites is 
disadvantaged by his lack of political machinery required to 
campaign and to defend his vote at the polls.  Remarking that 
the risk of fraud is greatest at the polling station level 
(JRVs), Martinez Cuenca argued that party election monitors 
(fiscales) are crucial.  He ventured that without enough 
fiscales, Lewites and the other two new political contenders 
Eduardo Montealegre and Eden Pastora will be unable to defend 
their votes. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
¶5.  (C) We will explore further Martinez Cuenca's assertions 
that Ortega enjoys substantial Catholic Church backing.  In 
addition to Ortega's advantages of CSE support, partial 
Catholic Church endorsement (which could sway even some 
undecided voters to his favor), ample campaign funds, a 
palatable, Liberal dissident running mate, and divided 
competitors, he virtually controls PLC caudillo/convicted 
money launderer Arnoldo Aleman's freedom, or lack thereof. 
Some Embassy contacts claim that Aleman has already 
 
relinquished his party's bid for the presidency in exchange 
for a guaranteed number of Assembly seats for Aleman 
loyalists and his eventual freedom.  Martinez Cuenca's 
quixotic quest may not succeed, but even if he can whittle a 
few percentage points from Ortega on November 5, his efforts 
could help prevent an Ortega victory on the first round -- 
and even many Danielistas agree that Ortega is unlikely to 
win a runoff.
