SUBJECT: PRT TIKRIT: INVESTIGATIVE JUDGES TRAINING POLICE 
IN SALAH AD DIN 
 
 
 ¶1. (U) This is a PRT Tikrit, Salah ad Din cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Starting in November 2006, the Salah ad Din (SaD) 
investigative judges began in-service training of police 
officers on criminal investigation procedures.  This PRT- 
inspired initiative was started to combat the large number 
of criminal cases that were being dismissed due to 
insufficient and tainted evidence. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In this new relationship, the investigative 
judges, who make initial findings to establish if cases 
have enough evidentiary support, hold weekly training 
sessions for police officers at the Tikrit Police Academy 
(TIPS).  Training sessions include techniques for 
interviewing defendants; collecting, preserving, and 
presenting material evidence; proper security of a crime 
scene; and other criminal investigation procedures.

Comment 
------- 
¶4. (SBU) These regular training sessions should establish 
better professional relationships between the investigative 
judges and the police, who have traditionally worked at 
odds.  As many criminal cases are currently dismissed for 
what the investigative judges consider sub par police work 
in investigations,  we anticipate this training will result 
in a fewer number of cases dismissed for insufficient and 
tainted evidence.  END COMMENT.
