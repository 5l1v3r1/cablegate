SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOR GAZA 
 
REF: 2008 STATE 116623 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see para. 6. 
 
Situation 
--------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Israeli Defense Forces initiated military action 
against Hamas in the Gaza strip on December 27.  IDF ground 
forces entered Gaza on January 3.  Since the initiation of 
military action, large numbers of civilians throughout Gaza 
have been severely affected.  As of January 6, more than 600 
people have died, 25 percent of whom are estimated to have 
been civilians, and more than 15,000 people have been 
displaced.  Electrical, health, water and sewer systems have 
all been damaged and are on the verge of collapse.  The 
majority of the population relies on humanitarian aid to meet 
basic needs.  The U.S. Government has already offered to 
evacuate any U.S. citizen who wishes to depart Gaza.  Ongoing 
military operations and terrorist rocket and mortar fire have 
made the provision of assistance increasingly difficult. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The current situation in Gaza is of such a 
magnitude that is beyond the ability of the Palestinian 
Authority and international organizations to respond 
adequately.  Gaza borders are sealed off by Israeli and 
Egyptian authorities.  Basic utilities -- water, sewage, 
electricity, communications -- are severely degraded and tens 
of thousands are without the most basic of human needs.  Food 
supplies are limited and international assistance agencies 
report that their ability to deliver foodstuffs has been 
severely limited due to the security situation.  Civilian 
casualties, now put at over 150, and suffering are mounting. 
Over 15,000 people have sought refuge in temporary shelters 
set up by UN agencies. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post has confirmed with the Palestinian Authority 
that it will accept USG assistance.  It is in the interest of 
the USG to provide assistance for humanitarian purposes but 
also to maintain the political viability of the two-state 
solution and the progress achieved in the peace process since 
the November 2007 Annapolis conference. 
 
¶5. (SBU) While USAID currently has resources available to 
provide assistance, the scope of the humanitarian crisis in 
Gaza is extensive and reconstruction requirements are likely 
to exceed the resources available.  USAID's current programs 
are focused on the West Bank, and these will need to continue 
and perhaps expand under these circumstances. 
 
Declaration of Humanitarian Emergency 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Based on the current situation and ongoing needs, I 
declare that a humanitarian emergency of significant 
magnitude exists in Gaza sufficient to warrant additional 
assistance pursuant to an emergency declaration.
