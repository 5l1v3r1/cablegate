¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified; Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.   (U) This is an Action Request--see paragraph 7. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  A leading member of the Myanmar Caucus of 
the Indonesian Parliament is planning a series of media 
roundtable discussions meant to raise local and regional 
awareness of Aung San Suu Kyi's plight.  The programs would 
also serve as a follow-up to the highly effective USG-funded 
"Burma Road Show" events held at Indonesian universities in 
recent months.  The organizer has requested modest USG 
support.  We think that the plans are highly congruent with 
U.S. policy efforts re Burma and should be supported if at 
all possible.  END SUMMARY. 
 
HIGHLIGHTING THE SITUATION IN BURMA 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A senior Indonesian Member of Parliament is working 
to stimulate interest in the situation in Burma.  Djoko 
Susilo, a passionate Myanmar caucus member and outspoken 
defender of human rights and democracy in Burma, has asked 
for USG support to carry out a series of four roundtable 
discussions on Burma democracy and human rights.  The 
discussions would be timed for around Suu Kyi's June 19 
birthday.  Susilo hopes the programs will help create 
widespread Indonesian and regional support to increase 
pressure on the regime to release Suu Kyi and institute 
democratic reforms.  The programs would be held under the 
auspices of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Myanmar Caucus 
(AIPMC). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The program would target major media in Indonesia's 
two most important cities, the national capital of Jakarta 
and the East Java provincial capital of Surabaya.  The four 
discussions would be exclusively for two major television 
stations and two  newspapers in each city.  These media would 
provide lengthy, in-depth analysis of the Burma situation 
reaching tens of millions of Indonesians. 
 
A HISTORY OF EFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Susilo also recently organized a series of 
USG-funded discussions at elite Indonesian universities, the 
"Burma Road Show" (ref B).  The Road Show was effective in 
terms of raising awareness on Burma and underscoring that 
Indonesia--as an ASEAN neighbor--can play a key role in 
fostering change there.  The three events--plus Mission's 
conference on Burma held early last year--have helped place a 
spotlight on the Burmese regime and its denial of 
democratic/human rights to its citizens.  The GOI has been 
active in pressing Burma on human rights issues, (ref A), 
including a recent statement by Foreign Minister Wirajuda 
pressing for Suu Kyi's immediate release. 
 
ACTION REQUEST 
 
¶7.  (SBU) By leveraging regional support, we think that 
Susilo's plans are highly congruent with U.S. policy efforts 
re Burma and should be supported if at all possible.  Susilo 
has requested USD 9,000 for the four events to cover 
honorarium for speakers, venue rental and logistical costs. 
Mission would like EAP to consider this modest request.  A 
more detailed project proposal and budget will be forwarded 
separately.  END ACTION REQUEST.
