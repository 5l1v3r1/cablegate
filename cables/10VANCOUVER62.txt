SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #2 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
on February 12, 2010. Please visit the following link for 
additional classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
Olympic Protests: 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minor Disruption of Olympic Torch Relay - As anticipated, 
the Olympic Torch Relay encountered minor disruptions as it 
circulated through urban Vancouver this morning. At one point, the 
relay halted as a knot of activists blocked a downtown 
thoroughfare, after which local security personnel and Olympics 
officials re-routed it. As of this writing, protest activity has 
been light, and there have been no arrests or incidents of property 
damage or violence. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Anticipated Protest Activity - The Opening Ceremonies 
commences at 6 p.m. today at BC Place Stadium; anti-Olympic 
factions - including umbrella organizations like No2010 and the 
Olympics Resistance Network - are planning a 3 p.m. "Take Back Our 
City" march from the Vancouver Art Gallery to the stadium. 
Canadian officials expect between 1,000 and 1,500 protesters during 
the rally. 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Suspicious Package at SeaBus Terminal Rendered Safe - A 
suspicious package was identified Thursday evening in North 
Vancouver at Lonsdale quay near the north shore SeaBus terminal. 
SeaBus (water taxi) service between Vancouver and North Vancouver 
was suspended while RCMP EOD personnel examined the package.  There 
was additional concern because the package was located near fuel 
tanks.  RCMP, utilizing a water cannon, neutralized the package and 
determined it contained fishing rods and equipment.  The SeaBus 
terminal subsequently reopened. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) U.S. citizen deported from Canada - The Canadian Border 
Security Agency deported AmCit Gregory Marks to the United States 
after finding an inert hand grenade and pornographic literature in 
his vehicle.  Marks also possessed a typed paper outlining a 
scenario for paragliding into the opening ceremonies of the 
Vancouver Winter Olympics.  The scenario describes launching from 
Whistler with the goal of gaining notoriety.  An FBI interview 
determined Marks was emotionally disturbed and has no ties to 
domestic militia groups. 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is wheels down in Vancouver 
today, February 12, and is scheduled to stay at the Vancouver 
Fairmont Hotel. 
 
 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
 
 
¶8. Public Affairs staff was fully engaged today in attending to 
media needs surrounding the opening ceremonies.  PA staff from 
Mission Canada worked with press staff from the Office of the Vice 
President to manage press at the arrival of Air Force 2, the 
athletes' meet-and-greet with the Vice President and Ambassador, 
and the GOC reception for Heads of delegation.  Call volume to the 
Public Affairs telephone line in the OCO was light. 
 
 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶9. Whistler ACS reported that an alpine skier on the U.S. Olympic 
Team was injured in a practice run at Whistler.  She has been 
evacuated by helicopter from Whistler.  DS FLO reports the Amcit 
probably had a concussion and was evacuated from Whistler most 
likely as a preventative measure.  ACS has no further information 
about her situation at this time. 
 
¶10. ACS reported the Consulate visit of an Amcit claiming USG 
officials had promised her "Olympian" status.  ACS spoke to her 
mother who indicated that her daughter is not taking her 
medication.   RSO was able to confirm through CBP that the Amcit 
has a return ticket to Ohio on 13 February.   ACS will remain alert 
to any further developments. 
 
 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶11. Celebratory atmosphere in Vancouver is increasing as the 
Olympic flame makes it way around the city streets. The flame 
crossed over the Lion's Gate Bridge a little before 0700 PST. 
Shortly afterward, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 
carried the flame through the Park, passing off to past Olympian 
Sebastian Coe.  The flame will continue a meandering movement 
through the city until arriving at the Opening Ceremonies at BC 
Place shortly after 2000 PST. 
 
 
 
¶12. The only sad news on an otherwise festive day was the report 
out of Whistler of the death of Georgian Luge athlete Nodar 
Kumaritashvili. Kumaritashvili was on a practice run at the 
Whistler Sliding Center when his sled veered out of control up the 
side wall at the fastest part of the track.  The athlete was thrown 
from the sled into a pillar and died of his injuries a short time 
later.  It was estimated he was traveling at nearly 90 mph at the 
time of the accident. 
 
 
 
¶13. Vice President Biden and the rest of the Presidential 
Delegation to the Opening Ceremonies arrived safely in Vancouver at 
 
noon 2/12.  They have a full program in the afternoon, including a 
Meet and Greet with U.S. Olympic Athletes and attendance at the GOC 
hosted Heads of Delegation reception.  The final event is the 
Opening Ceremonies, which are scheduled to begin at 1800 PST and 
are estimated to last three hours.  Preliminary round competition 
started this morning in Whistler for the men's individual ski 
jumping. Competitions begin in earnest tomorrow morning with the 
first medals awarded in the final round of men's ski jumping.  A 
schedule and results of all competitions throughout the Games can 
be found at http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-schedule -results/.
