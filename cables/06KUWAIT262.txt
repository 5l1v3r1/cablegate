EXPATRIATE LABOR ROUNDTABLE 
 
 
¶1. Post organized and hosted on January 24th a meeting of 
labor officials from source countries for expatriate labor in 
Kuwait to engage on how to better work together to improve 
the status of Kuwait's large expatriate labor force. 
Representatives from the embassies of Bangladesh, Indonesia, 
Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka attended. 
Representatives from the embassy of India and the 
International Organization for Migration were unavailable. 
The participants exchanged information about the challenges 
their constituents face: nonpayment of wages, sexual 
harassment, poor working conditions, mistreatment by the 
police, and exploitation due to lack of the local language 
and labor laws. At the urging of EmbOffs, participants also 
exchanged ideas about practical ways of solving or mitigating 
the difficulties faced by their constituents, such as 
increasing the workers' awareness of the services their 
embassies can provide, the dangers of signing documents they 
do not understand, what to do if arrested by the police, and 
where to turn in case of physical or sexual harassment. 
 
¶2. All parties agreed to participate in regular monthly 
meetings in order to share information with one another and 
to increase the effectiveness of their activities by uniting 
their efforts. They expressed their gratitude to the United 
States for its attention to labor and human rights issues, 
and for taking the initiative to create this forum.
