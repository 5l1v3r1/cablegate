¶1. (SBU) Summary: Egypt has confirmed its first Human Avian 
Influenza (AI) case in 2008: a four-year-old girl from the 
Minya governorate who is currently hospitalized in Cairo. 
Reacting rapidly and thoroughly, the Ministry of Health and 
Population (MOHP) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) 
dispatched teams to the area on February 26. Egypt's first AI 
case this year comes amid reports from the MOHP and the 
MOA about the ongoing challenge of controlling poultry 
movement, unsanitary markets and butcher shops, and the 
presence of H5N1 virus in farm flocks previously thought to 
be vaccinated.  Egypt has now reported 44 confirmed cases of 
AI -- 19 of them fatal.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The girl's symptoms started February 21, but she 
was not hospitalized until February 24.  Doctors administered 
Tamiflu after admission, and then transferred her to Cairo on 
February 25.  According to Dr. Abdel Nasser, MOHP, the girl, 
from the village of El-Sheikh Massoud, El-Edwa district, is 
now in moderate condition at Manshyet El-Bakry General 
Hospital in Cairo suffering from pneumonia and a collapsed 
lung, but her treating physicians expect her to recover. 
NAMRU-3 confirms that she was infected with the H5N1 virus. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MOA's "Rapid Response Team," including an 
epidemiologist and two laboratory technicians, collected 
samples, conducted interviews, and created a map of the 
village.  According to their investigation, the girl's family 
bought live ducks on or about February 10, and slaughtered 
them on February 18. Several families live in the girl's 
house; MOHP has over 20 individuals under surveillance.  MOA 
tested the samples collected and found the H5N1 virus was 
present in birds from surrounding households. USAID's Avian 
and Pandemic Influenza Technical Team Leader is visiting 
Cairo and is actively involved in the response efforts.  Dr. 
Gavin Macgregor Skinner is encouraged by the joint, rapid 
MOHP/MOA response and the strength of the MOA's 
epidemiological investigation. Community for Healthy Living 
(CHL), a USAID contractor, also sent a team to Minya and will 
be conducting an AI awareness campaign over the course of the 
next several days. NAMRU-3 is ready to provide on-site 
technical assistance, but the GOE has not asked for it at 
this point. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) MOHP survey teams continue to encounter 
uncontrolled trucking of poultry across the country, as well 
as unhygienic open poultry markets and butcher shops.  MOA 
contacts report surveillance teams are getting better 
cooperation from local authorities in recent months and, as a 
result, more reliable poultry farm test results.  According 
to one contact, "We are now testing the right birds." MOA 
tests in December and January detected the virus in farm 
birds in eight of the twenty two governorates where tests 
were conducted. MOA sources report that engaging local 
political leaders to address the AI threat remains a 
challenge because the politicians believe bird flu in their 
areas reflects badly upon them.  The Governor of Minya, 
however, has been very supportive of the GOE's campaign 
against the disease and is cooperating closely with MOHP and 
MOA.
