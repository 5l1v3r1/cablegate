who have been displaced by the 22-year-long conflict in the 
Casamance region of Senegal.  In this proposal, HI is seeking 
funds to improve the living conditions of landmine victims, 
many of whom are unemployed farmers that are unable to return 
to their fields as they have been mined by rebel soldiers,

children in schools, creating income generating activities, 
providing medical health care, and making orthopedic apparel. 
 HI focuses on vocational instruction whereby girls are given

women are involved in fruit and vegetable food processing 
programs.  This project has never received USG funding.  Post

intended recipient agency.
