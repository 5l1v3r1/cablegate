SUBJECT: MINNAWI ON HIS RETURN TO KHARTOUM 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On October 15, Minnawi met poloff in El-Fasher 
stating that he will travel to Khartoum for the start of the Sudan 
People's Initiative, but that he will spend less than 24 hours in 
the capital and only "inject my own views on the process and the DPA 
and then return to the field."  Minnawi said negotiations with the 
GoS over the September 19 agreement with Taha have recently focused 
on a sum of approximately $200 million for the Transitional Darfur 
Regional Authority and the Darfur Reconstruction and Development 
Fund.  Minnawi stated that GoS officials are waiting for the return 
of Finance Minister Awad Al-Jaz before any decision will be made, 
and that the question remains whether this sum will be paid in cash 
or in development projects.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On October 14, UNAMID provided air transport for Minnawi 
from north Darfur to El-Fasher.  On October 15 at approximately 
9:00, poloff visited Minnawi at a tightly-guarded Transitional 
Darfur Regional Authority facility.  Approximately four "technicals" 
(Toyota Landcruisers) with mounted machine guns, and 50 armed men 
wearing battle headdresses and assorted uniforms surrounded the 
facility. 
 
SHOW ME THE MONEY 
- - - - - - - - - - 
¶3.  (SBU)  Minnawi stated that the most recent negotiations with the 
NCP have focused on funding of the TDRA and the DRDF.  Minnawi added 
VP Taha personally guaranteed that $200 million USD will be 
allocated to the DRDF.  Minnawi stated that Taha and other NCP 
interlocutors claimed that the final approval for this decision must 
come from Minister of Finance Awad Al-Jaz who returned to Sudan from 
the U.S. the evening of October 15. Poloff observed that a decision 
of this magnitude should not depend on one individual (i.e. Al-Jaz,) 
and that if anyone should have final say, it should be President 
Bashir.  Minnawi responded, "Bashir will never take the decision to 
spend money on Darfur and so it will have to come from someone 
else." "The Gos has the money, but they are using it all for 
development in the North where Bashir and the rest of the NCP's 
leadership is from," added Minnawi. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Minnawi also stated that the two sides have still not 
reached agreement as to what percentage of this money will be paid 
in cash as "seed money for the fund," and what part will be paid in 
development projects. Minnawi stated that NCP officials have debated 
the actual terminology (and translations) in the DPA regarding 
whether the allocation to the DRDF should be in cash or development. 
Minnawi stated that while progress has been made on recognizing the 
DPA in the interim constitution and on Darfuri representation in the 
civil service, the financial issues remain the most contentious and 
important issues for his movement. 
 
JOINT MILITARY COMMITTEE MOU 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶5.  (SBU)  Minni called the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed 
by the NCP and SLM/MM Joint Military Committee (JMC) on October 13 
"positive."  The agreement, signed by SLA's Jumma Haggar and SAF's 
Mohamed Abdul Muneim Al-Zain focuses on security of Darfur's roads, 
opening roads that have been closed, supporting UNAMID deployment, 
coordination of the parties' movements, and forming a joint 
committee for exploring these and other issues.  (Note:  A full 
translation of the agreement is being translated and will be sent to 
AF/SPG and the Office of the SE as soon as possible.  End Note.) 
Contrary to reports from one of UNAMID's political officers, Minnawi 
said that no agreement has been reached between the two parties on 
salaries or non-military logistical support for Minnawi's fighters. 
 
 
SUDAN PEOPLE'S INITIATIVE AND FEAR FOR SAFETY 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶6.  (SBU)  Minnawi admitted that he had "no idea" what will take 
place on the opening day of the Sudan People's Initiative on October 
¶16.  The initiative does not adequately consult Darfuris, and even 
neglects NCP cronies in the region such as North Darfur Governor 
Yousif Kibir, stated Minnawi.  Minnawi stated that he will travel to 
Khartoum for less than 24 hours, that he will "only give my input," 
and then return as quickly to the field as possible.  Minnawi said 
that he fears for his personal safety in El-Fasher, and to a greater 
degree in Khartoum, and said that he will bring as many bodyguards 
with him as UNAMID will allow.  He also discretely asked whether the 
U.S. might be able to help with his security in Khartoum. CDA 
Fernandez spoke to Minnawi the evening of October 15 immediately 
before his departure from El Fasher. Minni reiterated his skepticism 
of both the Khartoum and possible Doha meetings. He will follow up 
with CDA on October 16. Pro-regime newspapers on October 16 hailed 
Minnawi's return to Khartoum and highlighted his alleged praise of 
President Bashir's "recent steps" towards peace in Darfur.

DIVISION IN NCP 
- - - - - - - - - 
¶7.  (SBU)  Like other SLM/MM interlocutors Minnawi stated that two 
adversarial groups have developed within the NCP, one led by VP Taha 
determined to work with SLM/MM and the other, which prefers a 
military solution.  Minnawi stated that Taha called him two days ago 
and admitted that Minnawi's cooperation is needed at this crucial 
time, "as we are facing division on this [in the NCP] and you need 
to help this succeed."  Minnawi stated that Defense Minister 
Abdelrahim Hussein is particularly against funding the DRDF without 
SLM/MM demobilization or their integration of his forces into SAF. 
 
 
TIMELINE 
- - - - - 
¶8.  (SBU)  Minnawi said his permanent return to Khartoum will depend 
on implementation of the DPA and the GoS's commitment not to 
undermine it with another agreement.  He stated that Taha promised 
significant DPA implementation in a month, and "as our agreement was 
on the 19th of September, that only gives them four days." 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  Minnawi also discussed non-signatory rebel movement 
military plans, coordination across rebel movements, and his 
relationship with non-signatories, to be reported septel in 
forthcoming cable on security and rebel alliances. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
¶10.  (SBU)  Compared to SLM/MM leaders working on DPA implementation 
in Khartoum (such as Muhammad Tijani, Muhammad Suliman, and Abdel 
Aziz Sam who recently met with SE Williamson,) Minnawi appeared less 
optimistic about this last-ditch effort to salvage the DPA.  Despite 
the press play, Minnawi was more dismissive of the Sudan People's 
Initiative, and is undoubtedly attending the session to push his own 
agenda, and once again, call for the implementation of the DPA.
