Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha'aretz cited the belief of GOI sources that most Security Cabinet 
members will support increasing financial pressure on the Gaza Strip 
during the cabinet's meeting in Jerusalem today, in response to the 
ongoing rocket fire at Israel.  Leading media reported that Defense 
Minister Ehud Barak ordered the defense establishment to examine 
"the operational and legal aspects of steps designed to limit 
Hamas's rule in the Gaza Strip." Ha'aretz reported that Barak told 
the IDF he wanted to determine the degree to which Israel was 
obligated to provide services for the Strip.  The call to cut off 
water, electricity, gas and fuel to the Strip is seen as an 
alternative -- or, if unsuccessful, a prelude -- to a broad IDF 
incursion into northern Gaza.  However, Ha'aretz quoted GOI sources 
as saying that PM Ehud Olmert was unlikely to authorize an 
escalation in Israel's military actions in the region.  Major media 
reported that Sderot parents intend to demonstrate outside the 
Knesset building today. 
 
The Jerusalem Post and Ha'aretz reported that on Tuesday PM Olmert 
met with the Quartet's Middle East envoy Tony Blair in Jerusalem, 
and that the two discussed practical steps that would contribute to 
confidence building between Israel and the Palestinians.   Ha'aretz 
quoted Olmert spokeswoman Miri Eisin as saying after the meeting: 
"The Prime Minister is willing to take practical [security] steps, 
but these steps cannot be one-sided."  The Jerusalem Post quoted 
officials in the Prime Minister's Office as saying that Israel is 
considering the release of some 100 Palestinian prisoners before 
Ramadan as a goodwill gesture to PA Chairman [President] Mahmoud 
Abbas, according to the same criteria that governed the release of 
some 250 prisoners in July. 
 
Israel Radio reported that on Tuesday three IDF soldiers were 
wounded in Nablus, where the army discovered a weapons lab. 
 
Ha'aretz quoted legal sources as saying on Tuesday that the Winograd 
Commission's final report on the performance of decision-makers in 
the Second Lebanon War may be delayed until the spring, following 
the panel's announcement that it intends to warn officials who may 
be harmed by its findings.  Other leading media published similar 
reports.  The Jerusalem Post quoted Olmert's opponents within his 
Kadima party as saying that the High Court's decision to require a 
lengthy legal procedure ahead of the report's release will hasten a 
split in Kadima. 
 
Leading media (lead story in Maariv) reported that on Tuesday the 
High Court of Justice ordered the state to redraw, partially 
dismantle and rebuild a 1.7 kilometer section of the West Bank 
separation fence, which was built on land belonging to the 
Palestinian village of Bil'in.  For nearly three years, the fence 
has been the focus of weekly demonstrations at Bil'in, punctuated by 
violent confrontations between protesters, soldiers and police 
deployed at the site.  Maariv headlined: "Bil'in Residents Beat the 
IDF." 
 
Under the headline, "Israel Said No to the Americans," Yediot 
reported that Israel turned down a US suggestion that it resume the 
security coordination mechanism (DCO) with the PA in various 
districts of the West Bank.  The newspaper reported that US security 
coordinator in the territories Lt. Gen Keith Dayton had conveyed the 
proposal to Israel.  Yediot also cited the concern of the IDF and 
the Shin Bet over pressure by the PA to bring all West Bank cities 
under its control, which would prevent free action and arrests from 
the IDF in those cities. 
 
Israel Radio quoted former US Consul-General in Jerusalem Edward 
Abington as saying that Israel has provided the US with selective 
intelligence on Palestinian groups aided by the Dallas-area Muslim 
charity Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development.  He 
testified on Tuesday as the first defense witness for leaders of the 
foundation. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that on Tuesday, at the sixth meeting of 
the Ankara Forum for Economic Cooperation, plans were unveiled for 
the establishment of a joint Israel-PA industrial park in the West 
Bank.  The Ankara Forum is a joint imitative between Israel, Turkey, 
and the PA seeking to foster economic cooperation between Israel and 
the PA. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that during his visit to Jerusalem on Monday, 
Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer informed FM Tzipi Livni that 
he was powerless to prevent the private Austrian firm OMV from 
 
 
supplying natural gas to Iran.  OMV intends to sign a Euro 22 
million deal by the end of the year and connect Iran to Europe's gas 
supply through the Nabucco Pipeline. 
 
Israel Radio reported that on Tuesday in Sydney White House 
Spokeswoman Dana Perino congratulated Lebanese PM Fouad Siniora and 
the Lebanese Government "on its victory over the terrorist 
organization Fatah al-Islam in the battle for Nahr al-Bared camp in 
Northern Lebanon." 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted the Israel Export and International 
Cooperation Institute as saying on Tuesday that the weight of 
Israeli exports in world trade has been gradually declining by some 
25 percent over the past six years, despite the fact that shipments 
of Israel goods and services rose by 36 percent during the same 
period.  The Jerusalem Post also reported that Israel's level of 
economic freedom fell five places from 39th in 2006 to 44th this 
year -- in this year's International Economic Freedom Report 
published on Tuesday by the Jerusalem Institute for Market Studies 
think-tank. 
 
Ha'aretz and Maariv quoted Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit as saying 
on Tuesday that Israel intends to grant citizenship to several 
hundred refugees from Darfur who are currently in the country. 
 
Maariv reported that the Interior Ministry intends to initiate 
electronic voting during next year's municipal elections. 
 
Maariv reported that on Tuesday 100 bachelor immigrants arrived in 
Israel on one single flight from the US. 
 
Yediot reported that two sisters aged 14 and 18 will be leaving for 
New York tonight for a double heart transplant.

Op-Ed Page Editor Ben-Dror Yemini wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv: "Some of our fellow Israelis have abducted Zionism and 
turned it into a brutal enterprise of theft ... and abuse.... The 
High Court of Justice set a limit to that." 
Columnist Michael Freund, who was an assistant to former prime 
minister Binyamin Netanyahu, wrote in the conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post: "The alarm clock is ringing, if only we will hear. 
Now, more than ever, is the time to get up and put the nightmare of 
terror, weakness and retreat behind us, once and for all." 
 
Liberal columnist Ariella Ringel-Hoffman wrote in the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: "We can remember that 
if there were solutions, they always relied on agreements.  And this 
time it depends on an Israeli-Hamas arrangement."

¶I.  "A Just Zionist Ruling" 
 
Op-Ed Page Editor Ben-Dror Yemini wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv (9/5): "Some of our fellow Israelis have abducted Zionism and 
turned it into a brutal enterprise of theft ... and abuse.  The 
story of [the Palestinian village of] Bil'in opposite [the 
settlement of] Matityahu-East is an example of that bad weed in 
Zionism.  Israel must decide which Zionism it wants: a Zionism that 
grants a national home and the right of self-determination to the 
Jewish people within its own state, or a real-estate Zionism that 
robs the Palestinians.  The High Court of Justice set a limit to 
that.  This time ... the court did not rule politically. It ruled 
legally, despite the fact that the result is political -- and mostly 
Zionist.  But this is humane Zionism -- a Zionism that grants 
self-determination (to the Jews), not a Zionism that take away 
self-determination and rights (from the Arabs)." 
 
II.  "Stumbling toward Catastrophe" 
 
Columnist Michael Freund, who was an assistant to former prime 
minister Binyamin Netanyahu, wrote in the conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post (9/5): "What has happened to our sense of outrage? 
In the wake of his meeting with Palestinian Authority Chairman 
Mahmoud Abbas last week, reports surfaced that Ehud Olmert had 
discussed wide-ranging concessions such as dividing Jerusalem, 
uprooting dozens of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria [i.e. 
the West Bank] and forgoing Israeli sovereignty on the Temple Mount. 
 The media even published what was said to be a copy of a two-page 
document outlining Olmert's willingness to cross the few remaining 
'red lines' Israel still has in what is clearly a transparent 
attempt to salvage his increasingly shaky political career....  The 
truth is that everything this nation holds dear is coming under 
attack.  Our freedom, our future, our land and our legacy are all 
being pummeled and no one seems ready to stand up and do anything 
about it.... Today it is Sderot under fire.  But don't be surprised 
when Kfar Saba, Netanya and even Tel Aviv come under attack.  The 
alarm clock is ringing, if only we will hear.  Now, more than ever, 
is the time to get up and put the nightmare of terror, weakness and 
retreat behind us, once and for all." 
 
III.  "Turn On the Lights" 
 
Liberal columnist Ariella Ringel-Hoffman wrote in the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (9/5): "I wanted to 
write that at first glance, [Vice Prime Minister] Haim Ramon's 
proposal to turn off the lights in Gaza in response to the Qassam 
rocket fire on Sderot appears logical, but the truth is that even at 
first glance, it's stupid.  And on second glance, even stupider, not 
to say despicable.... [This means that] we will do whatever else we 
can do to the 1.5 million people there -- starved, exhausted, 
battered and bruised.  And there is another contrivance, the 
Judgment Day one: going into Gaza, with great force.... A wonderful 
proposal after the great success of the Second Lebanon War.... So 
what is left?  We can continue to play with Abu Mazen, the new 
Barbie doll that Olmert arranged for himself for the end-of-summer 
playtime.  Not only is this man lacking any real influence, he will 
also never reach a real arrangement that does not ensure the right 
of return, which is the main difference that no talk about a 'peace 
of the brave' will make up for.  I understand you, he says, but you 
cannot rob the Palestinians of their dreams.... We can remember that 
if there were solutions, they always relied on agreements.  And this 
time it depends on an Israeli-Hamas arrangement -- with the elected 
Palestinian government.... Secretly, and explicitly, Israel must] 
be ready to talk to anyone on any subject.... Today.  Tomorrow it 
will cost more.  In short, turn on the lights."

¶2.  US-Israel Relations: 
------------------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Washington correspondent Shmuel Rosner wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "Even candidates like [Mike] Huckabee and his 
ilk -- less well known, more cautious about exactly defining their 
plans -- can favorably surprise Israel."

"From Arkansas to Jerusalem" 
 
Washington correspondent Shmuel Rosner wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (9/5): "An Israeli following the complicated 
maneuverings of the longest election campaign in the history of the 
US searches for signs predicting the future policies of someone who 
has not yet been elected.  All the candidates swear their allegiance 
to Israel, so that an obvious advantage is held by those who have 
already been there and proven that their heart is on the right side. 
 This is true of Rudy Giuliani, the Republican former mayor of New 
York, who is not afraid of individually displaying his completely 
hawkish pro-Israel world view.  Those who like it, can like it -- 
those who do not, can vote for Clinton.  Her advantage, in the eyes 
of many of Israel's supporters, will obviously remain firm also in 
the wake of the new election speech she launched in New Hampshire, 
at the beginning of the week, whose aim was to present her as an 
agent of political 'realism.'  This is the magic formula that served 
Republicans in the past.... [Republican candidate Mike] Huckabee has 
already visited Israel nine times, eight times more than Bush.  His 
Internet site has three chapters devoted to foreign policy: terror, 
Iraq and Israel; he promises that Israel 'will have access to the 
state-of-the art weapons and technology that it needs to defend 
itself.'  At all events, it is difficult to contradict what a fan of 
Huckabee's, but also of Israel's, pointed out -- that four out of 
the last five U.S. presidents (Bush Sr., Clinton, Reagan, Carter) 
were elected to the post when they lacked any experience in carrying 
out foreign policy and dealing with international crises.  They 
proved that even candidates like Huckabee and his ilk -- less well 
known, more cautious about exactly defining their plans -- can 
favorably surprise Israel."
