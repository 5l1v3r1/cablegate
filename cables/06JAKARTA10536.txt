¶1. (SBU) Summary. At an August 18 meeting in Singapore, officials 
from Singapore, Indonesia, and the United States agreed to 
continue the proposed Avian Influenza Trilateral Project within 
the Tangerang municipality as originally planned (as opposed to 
expanding it to the much larger District of Tangerang).  Three 
Government of Indonesia (GOI) officials participated in a 
regional APEC sponsored Pandemic Exercise conference in Singapore 
on August 17-18. Budi Tri Akoso, Chairman of the Indonesian 
Veterinary Association publicly criticized the GOI on August 11 
for failing to adequately cull poultry and for not standardizing 
inoculation vaccine and procedures.  As of August 23, data from 
NAMRU-2 and the Ministry of Health show 62 human AI cases in 
Indonesia with 48 fatalities. End Summary. 
 
Trilateral Technical Meeting 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Officials from Singapore, Indonesia, and the United 
States, met August 18 in Singapore to review the status of the 
proposed trilateral project to create an avian influenza free 
zone in Tangerang municipality, Banten Province, Indonesia.  Yong 
Ying-I, Permanent Secretary of the Singaporean MOH hosted the 
meeting. Dr. Nyoman Kandun, Director General for Diseases Control 
and Environmental Health, Ministry of Health led the Indonesian 
delegation.  Pat Patterson, Advisor for East Asia, Avian 
Influenza Working Group led the U.S. delegation.  APHIS, HHS, 
USAID and representatives from Embassies Jakarta and Singapore 
also participated. 
 
¶3. (U) During the meeting, participants reached consensus that 
the Tangerang project would go forward as originally planned with 
the target area to be Tangerang municipality and with the 
activities to be planned around both a human and avian focus. 
Participants further agreed that initial concerns with the plan's 
limited agricultural and veterinary components could be addressed 
within the context of the existing plan.  Participants agreed on 
a "dual track" approach: the Government of Singapore (GOS) 
representatives informed the other participants that it has 
decided a bilateral agreement between the GOS and GOI will be 
sufficient for the GOS to fund the project through the REDI 
Centre, regardless of whether or not a formal trilateral 
agreement is needed.  Implementation of activities will now occur 
while other issues are reviewed to determine whether any new 
understandings or agreements must be reached involving the 
parties. (Note: During a separate U.S.-Singapore bilateral 
meeting, Singapore MOH officials announced that Parliament had 
authorized Singapore MOH to sign a bilateral agreement with 
Indonesia in order to move forward Singapore's participation in 
the Tangerang project.) 
 
¶4. (U) All parties agreed that their principal points of contact 
would meet in Jakarta within two weeks to identify appropriate 
participants for working groups and establish a timeframe for 
follow-up meetings.  Dr. Kandun agreed that the GOI would provide 
an overall Project Director in order to spearhead implementation 
activities.  All parties reiterated their financial commitments

to the project and their agreement to move forward.  Embassy 
Jakarta agreed to provide a comprehensive listing of USG AI 
activities already underway in Tangerang.  The group also agreed 
to publicize the project once pilot activities begin. 
 
APEC Seminar on Assessing Pandemic Preparedness 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5. (U) Three GOI officials participated in a regional seminar 
organized by APEC on Pandemic Preparedness in Singapore from 
August 17-18.  Dr. Nyoman Kandun, Director General for Diseases 
Control and Environmental Health; Dr. Tri Satya Putri Naipospos, 
Vice Executive Secretary II to the National Committee on Avian 
Influenza Management and  Pandemic Alert; and Naily Chilmijati 
Secretariat Coordinator for  the National Committee on Avian 
 
SIPDIS 
Influenza Management and  Pandemic Alert represented the GOI. 
Featured speakers familiarized participants with different 
options for assessing their plans, policies and procedures. 
Speakers from more experienced economies also shared exercise 
experience and best practices with all APEC economies. Lisa 
Kramer, a featured speaker from USAID Indonesia, presented on 
donor assistance for implementing simulation exercises. 
 
Vet Association Criticizes Efforts to Contain Infected Poultry 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Local press reported that Budi Tri Akoso, Chairman of the 
Indonesian Veterinary Association criticized the GOI on August 11 
for its efforts to contain AI infected poultry.  In addition to 
charges that the GOI is not sufficiently culling poultry, Akoso 
criticized the GOI for using eight different kinds of poultry 
vaccine. "The government should use just one type," he suggested. 
"The more vaccines we use, the more likely they are to endanger 
other creatures."  Experts note that the use of a variety of 
vaccines to stop the spread of H5N1 might cause certain strains 
of the virus to become more robust and resistant to vaccines. 
Akoso also criticized the GOI for using different methods for 
disposing of culled chickens. 
 
Human AI Case Profile 
--------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) NAMRU-2 has confirmed four new cases (three fatal) since 
we transmitted Ref B.  NAMRU-2 data indicates the following AI- 
related case profile as of August 23: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or serology) 
human AI cases: 62, of which 48 have been fatal (case fatality 
rate of 77 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases 4, with 2 deaths (fatality rate of 
50 percent). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting sequencing at the U.S. CDC: 2. 
 
-- Number of possible untested AI cases under investigation (last 
30 days): approximately 22.

Note: NAMRU-2 data corrQonds with Ministry of Health data but 
may vary at times with AI case figures presented on the official 
World Health Organization (WHO) website, which usually lags NAMRU- 
2 data by one week.  The WHO website, last updated on August 23, 
notes 60 human AI cases in Indonesia with 46 deaths.  WHO figures 
can be accessed at www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza.
