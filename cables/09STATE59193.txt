The Department of State acknowledges the importance of 
adhering to Article XIV of the Agreement and the standard 
operating procedures drafted during the meetings held in 
Panama City in December 2008.  The standardized procedures 
and associated forms were developed jointly to ensure that 
the necessary channels of communication are established and 
functional between the designated officials of our 
Governments. 
 
The Department of State will work with other U.S. Government 
agencies to ensure proper implementation of the Agreement and 
standardized procedures and that the Operations Center of the 
National Aero-Naval Service of Panama (SENAN) is updated on 
the status of authorized boardings via telephone, fax, or
