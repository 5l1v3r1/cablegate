¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel request to General Alberto 
Ficuciello, Military Advisor to Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi.  Ficuciello was familiar with the details of this 
case, and pleasantly, but firmly stated that the GOI did not 
need, nor would it accept at this time, DOE's offer to send a 
team with specialized equipment.  Ficuciello thanked DOE for 
the offer and held open the possibility of Italy requesting 
assistance at a later date. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Polmiloff spoke separately to MFA Disarmament, Arms 
Control, and Non-Proliferation Office Director Fillipo 
Formica.  Formica confirmed that Italy was arranging 
inspection of the boats through established PSI procedures. 
All channels of communication were functioning well within 
the terms of those procedures, Formica said, and Italy does 
not expect to need assistance from DOE personnel.  Formica 
stressed that PSI mechanisms are working well in this case. 
He finished by requesting that the U.S. consult well in 
advance with Italy before making plans to send special 
personnel in the event of a future similar case.
