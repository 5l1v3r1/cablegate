SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Since our last report (Ref A), the Government of Nicaragua 
(GON) has resolved three property claims during the current waiver 
year -- for U.S. claimant Elia Lacayo, who was a U.S. citizen at the 
time of the confiscation of her property.  As of July 23, 2008, the 
GON has resolved 42 U.S. citizen claims belonging to 23 U.S. 
citizens registered with the Embassy.  There remain 299 U.S. 
citizens who await the resolution of 626 Embassy-registered claims. 
 
GON RESOLVES CLAIM FOR HEIRS OF ELIA LACAYO 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On July 23, Benjamin Lacayo, the son and legal heir of Elia 
Lacayo (deceased), provided the Embassy a copy of the final 
settlement document or "finiquito" signed on July 22, 2008, by him 
as the legal representative of his mother and sisters, who are also 
heirs to the property.  The heirs of Mrs. Lacayo received 
indemnification bonds (BPIs) with a face value of $57,328.00 for 
three farms with a combined total of 917 acres in the department of 
Zelaya.  The farms were confiscated by the GON in 1991;  Mrs. Lacayo 
was a U.S. citizen at the time of the confiscation of her property.

GON RESOLVES 42 CLAIMS DURING 2007-08 WAIVER YEAR 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (SBU) With the inclusion of Mrs. Lacayo's resolved cases, as of 
July 23, 2008, the GON has resolved 42 U.S. citizen claims during 
this current waiver year belonging to 23 U.S. citizens registered 
with the Embassy.  Between August 1, 2007, and July 23, 2008, the 
GON compensated 40 claims belonging to 21 U.S. citizens via BPIs 
with a face value of $6,812,566.  The courts ruled during this 
waiver year that property be returned to two U.S. claimants.  In 
addition, during this waiver year four U.S. claimants withdrew 11 
claims registered with the Embassy because they believed that they 
could not provide sufficient evidence to support their cases.  There 
remain 299 U.S. citizens who await the resolution of 626 
Embassy-registered claims.
