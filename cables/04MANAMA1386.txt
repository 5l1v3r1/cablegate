SUBJECT: MINISTER SAIF READY TO LAUNCH FTA ROAD SHOW 
 
 
¶1. (U) The Ambassador met with Minister of Finance and 
National Economy Abdullah Hassan Saif September 7 to discuss 
the upcoming signing of the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement 
(FTA) and the October 1 meeting of finance ministers on the 
G8 Broader Middle East and North Africa (BMENA) initiative 
(septel).  Saif praised the efforts of FTA negotiators on 
both sides for the rapid conclusion of the agreement.  He 
also noted the significance of the groundwork laid after the 
signing of the 1999 TIFA Agreement and the importance of 
having kept both business sectors engaged in the process. 
 
¶2. (U) Saif reviewed his travel plans, starting in Washington 
for the September 14 signing ceremony followed by the first 
FTA "road show" which he will lead on September 22 in New 
York.  This will be the first of several events that Saif 
will host in the U.S. in the coming year to promote the FTA 
and the benefits of doing business in Bahrain.  The New York 
event will focus on the finance and banking sector but will 
also include a larger event targeting a variety of 
medium-sized enterprises.  The GOB expects to focus its next 
road show on Chicago. 
 
¶3. (U) The Ambassador responded that the Embassy was also 
gearing up for the implementation phase and was looking for 
opportunities to work with the GOB to promote the FTA and the 
increased business opportunities it offers.  Saif noted that 
he welcomed the return of MEPI-funded consultants performing 
a sectoral analysis of the Bahraini economy to help guide the 
FTA implementation.
