"Boldness Versus Fear" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo's lead 
editorial maintained (1/23): "The Federal Reserve showed boldness by 
reducing 0.75% of the U.S. prime rate.... What caused panic in 
international stock exchange markets was President Bush's address 
announcing a series of fiscal measures last Friday.... The Fed's 
decision immediately calmed down the markets...but the NYSE operated 
under tough nervousness.... When the fiscal measures announced by 
the president are implemented, calm may return to the markets.... 
However, it's premature to say that the market's instability is 
over. The feeling that the U.S. crisis is more profound than one 
imagined is still strong.... In Brazil, contrary to what happened in 
crises during the past decade (Mexico, Asia and Russia), the economy 
is now in excellent condition to face financial turbulence without 
major problems, thanks especially to the comfortable situation of 
its foreign accounts. Even so, if the international crisis worsens, 
its effects will certainly affect Brazil." 
 
"Gaza Again" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
editorialized (1/23): "The blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip is for 
Israel a legitimate way to put pressure on the Islamic radical group 
Hamas to prevent the launching of homemade rockets against its 
territory. Obviously, the Palestinian militias responsible for such 
an aggression have acted under the Islamic group's orders, or at 
least with its connivance. Hamas refuses to participate in peace 
negotiations with the Israelis.... It is not reasonable to suppose 
that Israel, under daily rocket attacks, will remain quiet."
