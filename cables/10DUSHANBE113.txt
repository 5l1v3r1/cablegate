¶1. (SBU) Embassy Dushanbe delivered points in reftel on January 
22 to Farhod Salim, Director of the North America and Europe 
Department at Tajikistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Salim 
said the MFA had no immediate comment on the U.S. goals at the 
London Conference on Afghanistan, but he had made sure to send 
the demarche to Foreign Minister Zarifi, who is currently in 
Istanbul on his way to London.  If we hear of any more 
substantive response, we will report septel. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Salim added that Tajikistan had learned from its 
embassy in London that the draft final communique of the London 
Conference contained no mention of infrastructure projects 
Tajikistan wished for, including rail and gas lines connecting 
Turkmenistan via Mazar e Sharif to Tajikistan.  The Tajiks had 
earlier understood that there would be some mention of these 
projects and were dismayed by this development.  They were 
working to get some mention reinserted in the text.  Farhod 
predicted that Foreign Minister Zarifi would attend the 
conference regardless of the final text of the communique.
