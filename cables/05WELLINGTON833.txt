SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN CASE AG-1003-97: CHECK ON BOEING A-4 
SERVICE AGREEMENT WITH NEW ZEALAND FIRM SAFE AIR LIMITED 
 
REF: STATE 191598 
 
¶1. Safe Air Limited of Marlborough, New Zealand, reported 
October 26 that it has no record of being informed by 
Boeing/McDonnell-Douglas that it should cease servicing 
Indonesian Air Force A-4s in 1999.  However, the company says 
it was well aware of the arms embargo against Indonesia and 
complied with it. 
 
¶2. Safe Air Limited said it last serviced A-4 jet fighters 
for Indonesia in 1999.  Under the Manufacturing License 
Agreement No. AG-1003-97 from McDonnell-Douglas Corporation 
(now Boeing), Safe Air overhauled two A-4s that the 
Indonesian military purchased in 1996 from the U.S. 
government.  After refurbishing the A-4s, Safe Air shipped 
them to Indonesia, where they were delivered to the 
Indonesian Air Force in October 1999.  The  cost of the 
overhaul was US $8 million.  Safe Air Limited said it has not 
worked on those aircraft since then or on any others for the 
Indonesian Air Force.
