SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS VETTING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ATTEND STAFF AND 
INSTRUCTOR TRAINING FROM 3-31 JANUARY 2009 IN PHNOM PENH 
 
REF: 03 SECSTATE 034981 
 
¶1. This is an action cable. See Paragraph Six. 
 
¶2. Reftel is guidance for screening nominees for U.S. sponsored 
training programs. 
 
¶3. To comply with the Leahy amendment relative to U.S. sponsored 
security assistance training, the U.S. Embassy Phnom Penh has 
conducted local human rights vetting for the following individuals 
selected for the Staff and Instructor Training in Phnom Penh from 
3-31 January 2009. 
 
¶4. The following individuals are members of a new unit that falls 
directly under the authority of the civilian National Counter 
Terrorism Committee.  In February 2008, the Cambodian Prime Minister 
signed sub-decrees which established the Cambodian National Counter 
Terrorism Committee Secretariat. The 
Sub-decrees dictated the formation of the National Counter Terrorism 
Committee Special Forces (NCTCSF), the action arm of the 
Secretariat, with Colonel Hun Manet, a 1999 United States Military 
Academy Graduate, as the commander. Oversight for the manning and 
structure of the NCTCSF was an international effort between 
Cambodian, United States, Australian, and South Korean government 
officials with additional input provided by Japan and Singapore. 
The screening of candidates for the NCTCSF was thorough, including 
verification that recruits were fit to serve.
