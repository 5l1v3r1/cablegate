Classified By: Ambassador Clifford Sobel, reasons 1.4 b and d. 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary.  Chen Duqing, Chinese Ambassador to Brazil, 
told Ambassador Sobel on October 19 that his top priorities 
are to create a more favorable environment for economic 
relations and to promote Chinese interests in the Brazilian 
Congress.  Ambassador Chen described an economic relationship 
of growing bilateral trade and investment characterized by an 
unbalanced exchange of finished industrial goods from China 
for Brazilian raw materials, and said Brazilian political 
international ambitions exceed Brazil's political weight. 
End summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) Chen told Ambassador Sobel that he travels 
extensively throughout Brazil in pursuit of his top priority 
of creating favorable conditions to increase the trade 
relationship, mainly to Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, but 
also to northern states such as Para.  He is increasing his 
ability to pursue his other top priority by adding a 
counselor to his staff to work full-time on congressional 
engagement. 
 
"Brazil Must Open Its Mind More"

¶3.  (C) Sino-Brazilian relations are getting to be quite 
good, he explained, even if the only important Chinese 
visitor this year was the then-Deputy Foreign Minister (now 
Foreign Minister).  But an outdated view of the Chinese 
political system blurs Brazil's perception of China and 
"Brazil must open its mind more," he said.  The Chinese 
Communist Party was now taking historic steps at its National 
Congress, as President Hu noted when he said that China must 
be more open, and Brazil needed to understand this change, 
Chen stated.  (Note: The 17th National Congress of the 
Communist Party of China took place October 15-21, 2007.  End 
note.) 
 
Trade and Investment 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶4.  (C)  China would soon pass Argentina and Germany to 
become Brazil's number two trading partner, after the U.S., 
Chen noted, offering a figure of two-way Chinese trade with 
Brazil at USD 20 billion in 2006.  (Note: Chinese Foreign 
Ministry officials cited the same bilateral trade figure at 
the U.S.-China Sub-Dialogue on Latin America in late 
November, as reported ref A.  According to the Sao Paulo 
State Federation of Industries, total bilateral trade in 2006 
was USD 16.4 billion, as reported ref B.  End note.)  China's 
exports to Brazil are mainly finished goods, especially 
electronics; Ambassador Chen said Brazil complains of 
dumping, but Chen added that "this is part of our process of 
increasing our relationship," implying Brazilian dumping 
accusations are a natural part of a growing trade 
relationship. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Brazil's top exports to China are soy and iron ore. 
Seventy million tons of iron ore and 11 million tons of soy a 
year go to China, according to Chen, and China always runs a 
trade deficit with Brazil, now at about USD 4 billion a year. 
 (Note: China buys about a third of Brazil's iron ore 
exports, introducing "an obvious vulnerability" for Brazil, 
according to the November 2007 issue of Brazil Focus, 
published by Menas Associates, www.menas.co.uk.  Ref C 
reported Brazilian mining executives' concerns about China's 
influence over Latin American natural resources. End note.)

Chen said that if you calculate undercounting on the 
Brazilian side the deficit is even greater.  His principal 
concern about the economic relationship is that "Brazil has 
not consolidated its basis for more development" because 
"without more economic growth, it will not achieve greater 
income distribution."  He noted Brazil's poor infrastructure, 
calling Santos the "world's worst port," and said China is 
interested in railroad projects in Brazil.  Chen said 
Brazilian bureaucracy is "confused" and has no model, in 
comparison with China's, where top bureaucrats must go 
through the Central Committee Party School. 
 
Major Steel Investment 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6.  (C)  Chen told Ambassador Sobel that China had signed a 
major joint venture agreement on October 3 with the Companhia 
Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD, now "Vale") to construct a steel 
plant in Vitoria, Espirito Santo, making China a majority 
partner in the Companhia Siderurgica de Vitoria (CSV) with an 
investment of USD 5.5 billion (ref D).  Chen said China would 
like to make more such investments, but there is political 
resistance in some circles in Brazil.  (Note:  Ref E reported 
Brazilian fears of China.  Nonetheless, Brazilian leaders 
continue to court Chinese investment.  Bahia governor Jaques 
Wagner led a trade mission November 15-25 to China in search 
of investment in tourism, ports, railroads, mining, ethanol, 
and semiconductors.  Also in November, Amazonas Governor 
Eduardo Braga and a large entourage embarked on a 20-day 
Asian trade and investment mission to Japan, China (including 
Macau), Malaysia, and Indonesia.  A Chinese trade and 
investment mission to Amazonas in 2008 was announced during 
Braga's visit to China.  End note.)  In the northeast of 
Brazil, for example, Chen continued, there are many 
opportunities, but China will limit itself to equipment 
sales.  Moreover, in spite of the large size of many 
Brazilian firms, there is little money for equipment 
purchases and Brazilian importation of Chinese goods became 
somewhat more difficult after China increased the exchange 
rate value of its currency 8.27 percent, he noted.  China 
cannot revalue its currency as fast as the U.S. would like 
because it will produce a negative impact on the Chinese 
economy, Chen added. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  China's domestic steel production accounts for the 
majority of China's needs, but China must import certain 
specialized steels.  The trade with Brazil has not grown in 
the last 20 years and remains at about 30 million dollars a 
year, according to Chen.  (Note:  According to the Brazilian 
Institute of Steel, 2006 Brazilian exports of steel and steel 
products to China were USD 52.7 million (66,628 metric tons) 
and have dropped significantly since 2005.  Conversely, 
Brazilian imports of Chinese steel have increased from USD 
27.5 million in 2005 to USD 92.7 million in 2006.  End note.) 
 
Biofuels

¶8.  (SBU)  Asked about Chinese interest in Brazilian 
biofuels, Chen replied that China produces its own biofuel 
and does not buy any fuels from Brazil, only some heavy oil.

¶9.  (C)  Ambassador Chen said he has observed the growth in 
the U.S.-Brazilian bilateral relationship over the last year, 
and understands that Brazil wants to be a leader, but it has 
"no capacity or influence."  Chen dismissed Brazil's UN 
Security Council aspirations, saying it is not qualified, and 
is "interested in only some areas, and not in peace and 
security."

¶10.  (SBU)  Ambassador Chen said he has never been on an 
official visit to the U.S. and has spent most of his career 
in lusophone assignments.  He began his career in Brazil in 
1974, and returned in the period 1981-84.  He was Ambassador 
in Mozambique, and came to Brazil after a year and a half 
assignment in East Timor.  He said he is 60 years old, can 
retire at any time, and will finish his career in Brazil.  He 
speaks English.
