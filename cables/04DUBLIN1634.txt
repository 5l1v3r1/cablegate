SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: IARA INFORMATION REQUEST 
 
REF: A. STATE 229377 
 
     ¶B. STATE 230265 
 
Classified By: POL/ECON Counsellor Mary Daly, 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Emboff raised points in reftels with contacts in the 
Justice Ministry and Department of Foreign Affairs.  Both 
ministries greatly appreciated the information in Ref B. 
Regarding Ref A, both ministries confirmed that there are no 
legal grounds under which they can prevent Buisir's travel at 
this time, nor can they limit the amount of money he could 
carry with him, should he decide to travel.  They did 
confirm, however, that he is under "close observation".  He 
is living openly and still receives welfare payments from the 
State.  According to DoJ, should designation move to the 
level of UNSCR 1267 or 1373, Ireland will automatically 
freeze assets of Buisir, including stopping his welfare 
payments.  The same would happen if the EU Clearinghouse were 
to designate Buisir.  We are asking the ministries to clarify 
under what conditions they could limit his travel.  (Buisir 
is an Irish citizen.) Both DFA and DOJ contacts added that 
they were pleasantly surprised at the lack of public 
attention on this case.  Since the initial designation, the 
press has published only two articles, both of which were 
accurate and fair.  In the past, Buisir has pled his case to 
the press to garner public sympathy.  For reasons unknown, 
this time, he has not. 
 
¶3. (C) Contacts also shared information on current and 
prospective laws. The current penalty for financing terrorism 
is a maximum fine of 3000 euros.  The Criminal Justice and 
Terrorist Offences Bill of 2002 will be debated the first 
week of November.  The DFA expects it to pass as an Act.  If 
so, the penalty for terrorism financing will become a fine of 
10 million euros and 20 years in prison.  The Minister of 
Justice will also have authority to place assets into High 
Court following a Gardai investigation.  One of the reasons 
for the delay of this Bill is that Ireland has very strong 
private property laws, which will cause some debate when the 
Bill is tabled.  When the Bill becomes Act, as expected, 
Ireland will have more recourse to act bilaterally, in cases 
such as Buisir, and not have to wait through UN 1267 or 1373 
clearinghouse processes.  GOI officials expect the Bill to 
pass, because authorities want more legislative power to 
fight terrorism financing.  In the meantime, they are likely 
to support and welcome designation of Buisir, and IARA onto 
either 1373 or 1267 lists.
