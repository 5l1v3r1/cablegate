REF: A. STATE 115935 
     Â¶B. STATE 115948 
 
(SBU) We delivered the September PSI OEG meeting summary (ref 
a) to MFA Nonproliferation and Disarmament DDG Ahmet Gun and 
his deputy Elif Ulgen on November 3.  Drawing on ref b, we 
encouraged Turkey to consider hosting a PSI OEG or regional 
OEG in the future.  Gun noted Turkey has been a leader in 
PSI, hosting a large PSI exercise in 2006, and stated that 
the GOT would like to see other PSI partners take a more 
active role in hosting events.  Gun said Turkey has no plans 
to host any PSI events on the horizon, but is planning to 
conduct a national level exercise in 2009.
