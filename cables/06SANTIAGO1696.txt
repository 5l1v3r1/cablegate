On August 7, conservative, afternoon daily "La Segunda" (circ 
31,834) carried an editorial entitled, "Tour and Turns in the 
President's Trip."  Quote: 
 
"President Bachelet began yesterday a trip to Colombia and 
Ecuador....  The program will conclude at the end of the month with 
Foreign Minister Alejandro Foxley's trip to Peru to sign an FTA with 
the Garcia administration....  We can see a design and strategy in 
these activities...whereby Chile is giving priority to the Latin 
American continent....  But there is a change as to where it is 
looking in the continent and to whom....  What we can see is that 
the Foreign Ministry has begun looking to nations of the Pacific 
coast...with a program that includes all kinds of contacts, but 
especially entrepreneurial and commercial ones, to strengthen ties. 
 
"This alternative is much more attractive than that of following the 
ups and downs of the relationship with Argentina's Kirchner, the 
demanding Hugo Chavez, and even Evo Morales....  But the pragmatism 
of the strategy mentioned above will be tested with Chile's decision 
regarding Venezuela in the Security Council.  The Foreign Ministry 
has been clever in delaying this decision until the last moment... 
because it has given time for those for and against Chavez to 
confront each other.  The dynamics of events could in the end give 
way for other alternative. 
In this sense, Bachelet's trip...could be a chance to get a sense of 
the level of consensus or dissent over Chavez' bid for the Security 
Council."  KELLY
