¶1.  This cable provides input requested in reftel for the 
Secretary's Global Partnership Initiative. 
 
¶2.  Between the years of 1975-1985, approximately 130,000 
Cambodian refuges were resettled in the United States after 
fleeing the Khmer Rouge regime.  Since then, it is estimated 
that the number has grown to over half a million.  Cambodian 
communities are concentrated in Long Beach, California, 
Lowell, Massachusetts, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Seattle, 
Washington. 
 
¶3.  Given the relative newness of the Cambodian diaspora, 
there are few official connections between the diasporan 
community and the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC).  The 
connections are mainly kinship in nature, and include some 
financial support in the form of remittances from family 
members living abroad.  Due to the brutal circumstances of 
their escape and resettlement, many Cambodian Americans have 
had a difficult time adjusting to their new lives and face 
economic hardships.  There is currently little long-term 
investment in Cambodia from the diaspora community as a 
result. 
 
¶4.  After years of conflict, the  United Nations Transitional 
Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was set up from 1992-1993 in 
order to implement the Paris Peace Accords of 1991.  UNTAC's 
many goals included the restoration of peace and execution of 
free and fair elections.  Elections were held in 1993, and 
the new government proceeded to draft and approve a 
constitution.  Given the shortage of educated Cambodians 
after the Khmer Rouge era, diasporans were encouraged to 
return to Cambodia to assume roles within the new government. 
 Many Cambodian Americans are active within both the ruling 
and opposition parties. 
 
¶5.  As Cambodia continues to develop, cultural outreach is 
emerging.  Last year, the rock opera "Where Elephants Weep," 
was brought from Lowell, MA and performed in Phnom Penh to 
sold-out crowds.  The rock opera included performances from 
both native Cambodians and Cambodian Americans.  The 
Ambassador will visit Cambodian American community leaders, 
professionals and students in Long Beach, CA in December at 
the invitation of the Cambodian Culture and Arts Association 
(CCAA).  The CCAA is interested in partnering with the 
Embassy to "promote democracy, leverage economic growth, 
stimulate poverty reduction, eliminate corruption, and much 
more." 
 
¶6.  Te Embassy regularly interacts with the Cambodian 
diaspora in the Long Beach area.  The focus is primarily on 
promoting arts and educational exchanges between the 
community in California and their counterparts in Phnom Penh. 
 The Embassy is also in contact with the Cambodian community 
in Silver Spring, MD in an effort to involve it in the 
installation and display of Angkorian bronze artifacts at the 
Sackler gallery in May of 2010. 
 
¶7.  The Embassy also engages the small Cambodian Cham Muslim 
diaspora communities in Olympia, WA and Santa Ana, CA. 
Embassy officers have met with the communities, visited 
worksites in the U.S., and participated in mosque openings 
and events in Cambodia funded by the diasporan Cham 
communities.
