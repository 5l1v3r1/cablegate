SUBJECT: PREAH VIHEAR: LESS TENSION; MORE CONCERN 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOSEPH A. MUSSOMELI, REASONS 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (S) During a farewell lunch for the Ambassador with the 
Prime Minister's son, Hun Manet, the latter raised concerns 
about the ongoing Preah Vihear controversy.  Manet, who was 
graduated from West Point and who now is heading Cambodia's 
counter-terrorism assault force, wondered whether Cambodia's 
patience and low-key approach to Thailand's military 
incursion into territory long occupied by Cambodia had not 
been a mistake.  Manet argued that it appears that while the 
initial incursion onto Cambodian soil had not been authorized 
by the Thai government, that government now saw potential 
territorial gains from a more aggressive policy regarding 
border issues.  He gave his view that Cambodian patience and 
its refusal to use force have been interpreted by Thailand as 
weakness.  Manet noted that the deployment of Thai troops 
around Preah Vihear was recently followed by deployments of 
more Thai forces in other disputed terrain near the Ta Mouen 
temple, and that this may have been a direct result of 
Cambodia not taking a tougher stance. 
 
¶2.  (S) Ambassador countered that there appears to be 
progress in peacefully resolving this issue.  The Thai 
cabinet has approved withdrawal in principle of Thai forces 
and another round of high-level talks are slated for August 
¶18.  Manet, repeating for emphasis the phrase "in principle," 
predicted that orchestrating the withdrawal of the Thai and 
Cambodian forces would prove more difficult.  The Thai, he 
insisted, see no downside in resisting a peaceful solution 
and they can use the tension with Cambodia to distract their 
citizens from more pressing domestic concerns. 
 
¶3.  (S) Ambassador urged continued patience and greater 
efforts at finding a diplomatic solution.  The last thing 
Cambodia needed was armed conflict with Thailand.  Both 
countries needed good relations with the other and if this 
matter can be resolved bilaterally with ASEAN support, this 
would be best for all.  While agreeing, Manet pointed out 
that Thailand was refusing any ASEAN assistance in resolving 
the matter, and averred that the Thais now believe the UNSC 
will not intervene.  Ambassador, reiterating the Secretary's 
point, noted that we continue to believe that taking this 
issue to the UNSC is premature, but that we have not 
dismissed the prospect of UNSC action if all other options 
falter. 
 
¶4.  (S) Comment:  Given the recent downplaying of the Preah 
Vihear issue in the Cambodian press and the efforts of both 
governments to agree -- even if only in principle -- to 
withdraw military forces from the disputed territory, Manet's 
comments were somewhat unexpected.  It may well be that they 
were precipitated simply by President Bush,s recent visit to 
Thailand and Thai media reports suggesting that the USG is in 
lockstep with the Thai view that this is merely a bilateral 
issue undeserving of international attention.  We corrected 
the record, stressing that our continued support for ASEAN 
participation in resolving the issue is at odds with the Thai 
view.  Moreover, while we continue to believe that this 
matter is best resolved bilaterally or in an ASEAN context, 
we have not dismissed the possibility of UNSC action if all 
other diplomatic means to resolve the conflict fail.  Hun 
Manet, like many other Cambodian officials, believes firmly 
that it was only the prospect of this issue being raised at 
the UNSC that convinced Thailand to agree to bilateral talks 
and they now fear that if the Thai are certain that no such 
prospect is viable, then they will have no motivation to 
follow through on a troop withdrawal.  We are more sanguine 
about prospects for a peaceful, face-saving solution and we 
will continue to counsel patience and flexibility.
