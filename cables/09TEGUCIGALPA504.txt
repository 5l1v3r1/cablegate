SUBJECT: HONDURAN MILITARY ARRESTS PRESIDENT ZELAYA 
 
Classified By: amb. Hugo Llorens, e.o. 12958 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
 ¶1. (C) At approximately 02:30 local time (04:30 Washington) 
Honduran military forces entered the Presidential Palace and 
arrested President Manuel "Mel" Zelaya.  Embassy sources 
report Zelaya was taken to the Air Force Base adjacent to 
Toncontin International Aiport and then flown by military 
aircraft to Costa Rica, where he was said to be as of 
07:30.It has been reported that Zelaya has signed a letter of 
resignation. 
 
¶2. (C) Military commanders told DATT they had acted on 
instructions from the National Congress and the Supreme Court 
to prevent Zelaya from carrying out a poll, scheduled to take 
place today, on whether there should be a "fourth urn"at the 
November general elections to seek voter approval to convene 
a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.  The 
courts, the attorney general and the solicitor general had 
all declared the poll illegal. 
 
¶3. (C) Both the Attorney General and the individual members 
of the Congress we spoke to say they had only ordered the 
confiscation of the polling materials and had not asked for 
Zelaya,s arrest. Juan Orlando Gutierrez added, however, that 
Zelaya could be arrested for having committed several 
"flagrant" acts up to 24 hours after the act.  When asked if 
the National Police (HNP) were in solidarity with the 
military forces, Minister of Security Jorge Rodas told Emboff 
the HNP "are in support of the Constitution and rule of law." 
 
¶4. (C) As of 09:00 streets are calm in Tegucigalpa, although 
there is an unusually large police presence.  The military is 
confiscating poll materials throughout the country, according 
to the director of police.  Television and radio broadcasts 
have been suspended, and there are sporadic power outages. 
Television stations had reported the arrest before going off 
the air.  The government-controled Channel 8 urged Zelaya 
supporters to congregate in the Central Park and in front of 
the Presidential Palace to oppose the military's action. 
 
¶5. (C) Post held an EAC. There are no/no reports of violence. 
 Post is preparing a warden message to American Citizens and 
instructing all Embassy personnel to remain at home.  We are 
contacting airlines to determine status of departing and 
incoming international flights. 
 
¶6. (C) Ambassador spoke to President of Congress Roberto 
Micheletti, who said Zelaya,s publication of the poll in the 
official Gazette was a violation of law, and that Zelaya 
intended to convene a constituent assembly immediately after 
the poll, so Congress acted to preempt him.  The Ambassador 
told Micheletti that, while we realized that the poll had 
been ruled illegal by the courts, and that the publication in 
the Gazette may have defied the law, sending in the military 
to arrest Zelaya was not appropriate or legal.  Embassy 
continues all parties to seek a democratic solution to the 
current crisis while making clear that the military's action 
in this case was in our view inappropriate.
