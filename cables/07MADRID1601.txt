EconOff relayed reftel demarche on August 20 to Juan Luis 
Munoz de Laborde, MFA's Deputy Director for Economic 
Multilateral Relations.  EconOff asked that Spain support the 
U.S. candidacy for Part I category membership to the Council 
of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
Although Munoz de Laborde did not expressly reveal how Spain 
would vote during the September 2007 session, he hinted at 
Spain's support by saying that the U.S. had always been a 
Part I category member of the Council and should continue in 
this tier.  According to Munoz de Laborde, Manuel Bautista 
Perez, Director General of Civil Aviation at the Ministry of 
Infrastructure and Public Works, will be representing Spain 
at the September ICAO session.  Munoz de Laborde also noted 
that Spain would be seeking Part II category membership.
