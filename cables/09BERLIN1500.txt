SUBJECT: H1N1 Cases Continue to Skyrocket in Germany; New Low- 
Pathogenic AI (H5) Virus Appears in Poultry 
 
REF:  Berlin 1451 and previous 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: From November 7-13, the number of confirmed 
H1N1 infections in Germany rose by 26,579 cases to a total of 
86,654 cases.  This is the third consecutive week with an 
approximately 30 percent increase in the number of confirmed 
H1N1 cases.  The number of H1N1 deaths in Germany increased to 
forty-one.  25 cases of low-pathogenic avian influenza (H5) 
were reported in Thuringia. END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) At its weekly press briefing on November 23, the 
National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 26,579 new laboratory H1N1 cases in 
Germany from November 7 to November 13, increasing the total 
number of H1N1 cases to 86,654 (Comment: As of November 8, 
non-laboratory cases are no longer included in RKI's 
reporting. End Comment)   Bavaria remains the German state 
with the highest number of confirmed virus cases, with a total 
of 25,280, followed by Nord Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) (15,769) 
and Baden-Wuerttemberg (10,258). 
 
German H1N1 Deaths Increase 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) As of November 24, RKI has confirmed the deaths of 
forty-one patients due to H1N1.  The deaths are distributed 
among the German states as follows: NRW (17), Bavaria (11), 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (2), Thuringia (2), Hesse (2), Mecklenburg- 
Vorpommern (1), Lower-Saxony (2), Rhineland-Palatinate (1), 
Saarland (1), Berlin (1) and Saxony (1).  In the majority of 
cases, the patients had underlying health conditions and were 
considered to be "risk patients".  We are aware of four cases 
(2 NRW, 1 Hesse, 1 Saxony) in which patients reportedly had no 
underlying health conditions. 
 
Low-Pathogenic H5 Virus in Poultry Identified in Thuringia 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (U) On November 20, 25 cases of H5 low-pathogen avian 
influenza (LPAI) were confirmed at a poultry farm in state of 
Thuringia.  The cases, which were immediately notified to the 
OIE, had a reported 1.03 percent apparent mortality and 
morbidity rate.  The previous case of LPAI in Germany occurred 
on April 28, 2009.
