SUBJECT: JOINT WORKSHOP FOCUSES ON NUCLEAR EXPORT CONTROLS 
 
REF: 07 JAKARTA 3090 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  In opening remarks to a USG-sponsored 
training workshop on nuclear export controls, Pol/C 
underscored the importance of effective export controls in 
halting the proliferation of goods and technology that could 
be used to develop Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  The 
April 28-30 workshop--which was run by a USG inter-agency 
team--included officials from several GOI agencies, including 
nuclear energy, nuclear regulatory, and customs.  The 
workshop included various instructional modules.  GOI 
participants said they appreciated the workshop and 
Indonesia's involvement in the EXBS program.  END SUMMARY. 
 
WORKSHOP IN JAKARTA 
 
¶2.  (U) An inter-agency team from the U.S. Departments of 
Energy and State conducted a workshop on WMD-related 
commodity identification training in Jakarta April 28-30. 
The workshop, a sequel to the one held in November 2007 in 
Jakarta (reftel), was supported by Mission and by the 
regional representative for the Department's Office the 
Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS). 
 
WELCOMING REMARKS 
 
¶3.  (U) In welcoming remarks, Pol/C underscored the strong 
and growing relationship between the U.S. and Indonesia 
centered on the need to cooperate on ways to counter 
proliferation.  Globalization of trade has made proliferation 
a truly international problem.   Ever expanding global trade 
markets and technological advances have made it significantly 
more difficult to prevent the proliferation of WMD and the 
materials used to produce them.  Through our ongoing 
cooperation under the EXBS program we seek to collaborate and 
work with countries to develop strong strategic trade-control 
policies and to strengthen national strategic trade systems 
consistent with international standards, regimes and 
policies.  We look forward to further cooperation with 
Indonesia in this area and stand ready to offer further 
assistance. 
 
INDONESIAN COMMENTS 
 
¶4.  (U) On the GOI side, Dr. As Natio Lasman, Chairman of the 
Indonesian Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency (BAPETEN), 
reviewed Indonesia's ongoing process of compliance with the 
international WMD agreements that it had signed, including: 
 
-- the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT); 
-- the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC); 
-- the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC); 
-- the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT); and, 
-- the Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (SEANWFZ). 
 
¶5.  (U) M. Wahyu Purnomo, Director of International Affairs 
in the Directorate General of Customs and Excise, observed 
that globalization abetted transnational crime and made 
international cooperation and increased national vigilance in 
this area essential.  Adiwardojo (one name only), Deputy 
Chairman for Development of Nuclear Technology and Energy at 
the Indonesian National Nuclear Energy Agency (BATAN), noted 
that Indonesia was a state party to the Nuclear Safeguards 
Agreement and the Additional Protocol of the NPT, and had 
participated in several recent conferences on nuclear safety 
and on early notification.  The GOI also participated in the 
Asian Security Network and had completed a program of 
technical cooperation with DOE. 
 
INSTRUCTIONAL MODULES 
 
¶6.  (U) The workshop included instructional modules, which 
included discussion of: 
 
-- controlled items relating to nuclear weapons; 
-- controlled items relating to missile delivery systems; 
-- controlled items relating to chemical weapons development; 
 
JAKARTA 00000887  002 OF 002 
 
 
-- controlled items relating to biological weapons 
development; and, 
-- issues involving related industrial equipment. 
 
The Indonesian Directorate General of Customs and Excise also 
presented an overview of the Directorate and its 
responsibilities. 
 
POSITIVE COLLABORATION 
 
¶7.  (U) Indonesian participants expressed appreciation for 
the opportunity to discuss nuclear export controls in an 
informal workshop setting.  They were well aware of the 
dangers of proliferation and appreciated learning about 
methods to counter proliferation, though they admitted that 
their technological expertise was low.  This 
workshop--coupled with the one held last November and others 
before that--set a solid basis for additional USG cooperation 
with Indonesia in this area.
