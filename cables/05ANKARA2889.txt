Organizations Department Head Levent Sahinkaya and,

the Turkish Air Force.  Sahinkaya stated that space was an 
important issue and that Turkey wanted to contribute to the 
discussion about space.  Sahinkaya told us that he works on 
space issues with colleagues in the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) and the General Directorate for Technical and 
Scientific Research Institute (TUBITAK) and will seek 
opinions from these two entities in developing Turkey's

Turkey is planning to create an interagency committee to deal 
with space issues.
