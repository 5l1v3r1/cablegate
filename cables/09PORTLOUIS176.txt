¶1. On June 10, Post received a diplomatic note from the Mauritian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International 
Trade soliciting USG assistance to intensify the combat against 
piracy in the Indian Ocean. On the morning of June 11 Post was asked 
by telephone to send representatives to a meeting that afternoon, 
hosted by the Foreign Minister, also on the subject of responses to 
piracy (to be reported septel). 
 
¶2. Below is the text of the English-language diplomatic note, dated 
June 09, 2009. 
 
BEGIN TEXT 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and 
International Trade of the Republic of Mauritius presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States and has the honor to 
inform that the Government of the Republic of Mauritius is 
soliciting the assistance of the Government of the United States in 
its endeavour to step up the combat against piracy in the Indian 
Ocean region. 
 
The Ministry is of the view that the alarming rate of piracy 
activities could have serious economic repercussions in the region. 
Stakeholders from the commercial and fisheries sectors have recently 
expressed concerns about the upsurge in attacks and the expansion of 
the menace beyond the Gulf of Aden and the Somali Basin and have 
asked Mauritian authorities to take appropriate measures. 
 
The Ministry would therefore highly appreciate if the relevant US 
authorities could be kindly requested to favourably consider 
measures which could be implemented under present circumstances to 
reinforce maritime security in the region and to ultimately 
facilitate the normal shipping and fishing activities around the 
Indian Ocean islands. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and 
International Trade of the Republic of Mauritius avails itself of 
this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the United States the 
assurances of its highest consideration.
