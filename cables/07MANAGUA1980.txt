REF: STATE 114788 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On August 20, Econoff delivered reftel talking points to 
Julio Cesar Bendana, Director for Competition and Regulatory 
Efficiency at the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Development. 
Bendana expressed interest in establishing a dialogue on product 
safety (imported and domestic goods).  He explained that the 
Ministry of Health (MINSA) takes the lead in evaluating product 
safety, while the Nicaraguan Consumer Protection Agency, which 
Bendana oversees, has the authority to remove dangerous goods from 
commerce.  The Nicaraguan Customs Services Administration takes the 
lead on border controls, in coordination with MINSA. [Note: Customs 
officials have not returned Econoff calls on this subject.  End 
Note.]  Bendana acknowledged that local resources to evaluate 
product safety are limited and that participating in dialogue with 
U.S. authorities on this issue would strengthen his government's 
efforts to protect consumers.  During the past twelve months, 
Nicaragua has experienced problems with counterfeit medicines, 
methanol sold as liquor, and toxic toothpaste.
