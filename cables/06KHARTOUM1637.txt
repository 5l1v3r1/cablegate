¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Media accounts and a UN Sudan Situation Report 
detail hostilities in several areas of North Darfur State during the 
July 5-10 timeframe, resulting in perhaps 80 deaths and thousands of 
IDPs.  In addition, the Report contains IDP accusations that members 
of the SLM/Minni Minawi faction had raped women and executed as many 
as 40 men.  The SLM denies the accusations, and demands an 
investigation.  The UN has issued a special release clarifying that 
the items published in its Situation Report were attributed to those 
making the statements in question, rather than representing its own 
opinions.  End summary. 
 
Attacks Hit Korma Area; UN Report Cites IDP Rape Claims 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶2. (U) On July 5-10, hostilities renewed in the Korma area of North 
Darfur State, spreading toward surrounding areas, including Tawila 
(Note:  Korma has changed hands between SLM factions three times 
since March 2006.  End note.)  A UN Sudan Situation Report details 
several of the related incidents, which involved fighting between 
SLM factions.  The Report also carried, however, an account by IDPs 
regarding purported rapes and executions.  Numerous media accounts 
of the violence point toward the SLM/Minni Minawi faction as the 
aggressor, citing roughly 80 deaths and thousands of IDPs as fleeing 
the area. 
 
¶3. (U) On July 9, a UN Sudan Situation Report stated the following 
items regarding the security situation in North Darfur: 
 
(Begin text) 
On 8 July, a G-19 senior field commander (SLA/AW (Abdul Wahid)) 
reported that Birmaza (G-19 controlled-area) was under attack by 
SLA/MM (Minni Minnawi) rebels.  A Government Antonov aircraft joined 
by a white helicopter was observed circling the area.  Further 
investigations revealed that it was a white Government helicopter 
which passed over the town heading in the direction of Muzbat. 
Comment:  As a result of this renewed and potential ongoing 
fighting, UNDSS issued warnings to UNMIS, UN Agencies and NGO's 
through OCHA that operations in the above reported areas should be 
reviewed and suspended until further notice. 
On 8 July, an AMIS helicopter was shot at by unknown individuals 
carrying an unidentified projectile(s) 12 km Northeast of Shangil 
Tobayi.  The helicopter was completing an air patrol at a 100 meter 
altitude with about 12 passengers.  No further information is 
available.  Comment:  UNDSS has temporarily restricted flights to 
the area. 
On 8 July, a G-19 senior field commander confirmed that SLA/MM 
rebels, allegedly supported by SAF troops from El Fasher, attacked 
and captured Umm Sidir (G-19 controlled-area, 90 km North of El 
Fasher). 
On 7 July, SLA/MM rebels attacked Al Aradib Ashara and Faiga 
villages, both under SLA/AW (Abdul Wahid) influence.  Three people 
were reported killed and one was injured. 
On 5 July, the SLA/MM and SLA/AW factions were reported fighting in 
the SLA/AW controlled village of Tina (12 km Southwest of Tawilla). 
The SLA/MM rebels were based from Susuwa (Southwest of Tawilla).  A 
SLA/AW senior field commander had also participated in the fight 
with his forces. 
On 5 July, SLA/MM rebels attacked the villages Dalim, Kathim and 
Birka (about 40 km Northwest of El Fasher) which were most likely 
under SLA/AW influence.  The number of injured civilians and large 
number of stolen livestock is unconfirmed. 
AMIS reported that on 6 July, a town leader of Birka village (60 km 
West of Tawilla) was killed by SLA/MM rebels during the on going 
fighting between SLA/MM and SLA/AW in the Korma general area.  The 
SLA/MM rebels travelled into the town via Dali IDP Camp (Southest of 
Tawilla). 
Protection: 
Intra SLA fighting in and around Tawilla has forced the displacement 
of about 4,000 IDPs.  On 8 July, AMIS reported that about 650 new 
IDPs, mostly women and children, arrived in Zam Zam camp who fled 
from the ongoing fighting between SLA factions in the Tawilla area. 
All newly arrived IDPs belong to the Fur tribe and fled from 21 
villages; Koyo, Kera, Kosheny, Sandingo, Karfolla, Dady, Hashaba, 
Saby, Khor Mally, Dybis, Hymeda, Dolma, Dawa, Wadadi, M Saleat, 
Dally, Nemera, D Ba, Carhma, Daybo, and Abdia.  The IDPs alleged 
that the SLA/MM faction was indiscriminately killing, raping women 
and abducting Fur civilians in Tawilla.  One IDP alleged he 
witnessed fifteen young women being raped and then killed.  He 
further alleged that about forty men were kidnapped and believed to 
have been executed.  The general security situation was reported to 
be tense.

SLM Denies Claims, Seeks Investigation 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) SLM/M Spokesman Mahgoub Hussein told Pol/Econ Chief on July 
 
KHARTOUM 00001637  002 OF 002 
 
 
11 that the UN report was not true, and that reports of rape were 
based on misinformation and efforts to tarnish the image of the 
SLM/Minni Minawi faction.  He said the SLM/M had not launched any 
attacks since the signing of the DPA on May 5, and added that the 
attacks in the Korma area were due to rebel leader Sharif Harir and 
the SLM/M breakaway faction G-19, perhaps with assistance from Chad. 
 His remarks echoed those in a letter to the editor Hussein wrote, 
and which was published in the independent, English daily newspaper, 
Khartoum Monitor, wherein the SLM protests the accusations, demands 
an international investigation about the accusation, requests an 
official apology from the UN, asks the UN to derive its information 
from official sources, reiterates the SLM's compliance with 
international humanitarian norms, and affirms that one of its 
targets is cessation of activities by militias that strive to commit 
such atrocities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In a separate conversation, SLM/A advisor Dr. Hassan Hashim 
Elfashir told Poloff that there had been a battle between Minawi's 
faction and the National Redemption Front (NRF) near Korma, but that 
allegations of rape were completely false.  The charges made no 
sense, Elfashir said, because the SLM had been fighting for four 
years, but had never been charged with these types of abuses. 
Elfashir blamed the UN for the reports, and believed that Special 
Representative Jan Pronk was trying to undermine the DPA by defaming 
Minawi.  The SLA had already spoken to UN officials in Cairo, and 
hoped the UNSC would investigate.  If the allegations were true, he 
added, the SLA would be willing to turn the perpetrators over to the 
ICC.
