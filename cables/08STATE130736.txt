REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on license 050120452 for 
the export of carbines to Canada. Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: The license is for fifty AR-15 
carbines, which is considered a significant quantity of a 
powerful firearm. The purchase order from the end-user is for 
250 AR-15s. The bona fides of end-user, Les Agences Michel 
Gravel Inc., have not been established by a Blue Lantern 
check in the past. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of end-user Les Agences Michel Gravel Inc. as a 
legitimate recipient of the United States Munitions List 
(USML) items listed below. Post should determine how many 
carbines were received under this authorization. Post should 
also question end-user on their familiarity with the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), particularly 
regarding re-export or re-transfer. The following points are 
included for guidance: 
 
(To Les Agences Michel Gravel Inc.) 
 
-- How long has your company been in the business of 
importing and selling defense articles in Canada? 
 
-- What services and products are sold by your company? 
 
-- Who are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
-- How many carbines did your company receive under this 
export authorization? 
 
-- What are you annual sales of this type of firearm? 
 
-- Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities and concerns about the customers of Les Agences.
