SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050136184 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-shipment check on application 050136184 for the export 
of armor plating to Malaysia.  Post is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of response to 
a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Lack of documentation from foreign 
end-user the Malaysian MoD and unfamiliar foreign consignee 
Avibras Industria Aerospacial Rodovia Presidente Dutra 
(Avibras).  The company has appeared on previous licenses but 
the bona fides of the company have not been verified by a 
Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION KUALA LUMPUR: Embassy is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate host government officials to 
determine if the Malaysian MoD ordered the armor plating and 
if so, that the articles will be used for the purpose stated 
on the license.  Post is requested to exercise its contacts 
within the Malaysian MoD to verify this order. 
END ACTION 
 
¶5. ACTION BRASILIA: Department requests that Embassy make 
appropriate inquiries to verify the bona fides of foreign 
consignee Avibras, and to confirm the legitimacy of this 
transaction.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conducts a site 
visit to the company in order to provide Department with an 
assessment of its business operations and on-site security. 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC officer (see para 8). 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
--Does the company understand the prohibition against the 
unauthorized stockpiling of USML items? 
 
END ACTION
