SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: TAIWAN'S POLITICAL SITUATION 
 
 
¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies continued to 
focus their coverage August 18 on former DPP Chairman Shih 
Ming-teh's efforts to oust President Chen Shui-bian, and 
investigations into the Presidential Office's special state affairs 
expense account.  The pro-status quo "China Times" front-paged the 
results of its latest survey, which showed that the approval ratings 
for both President Chen Shui-bian and the DPP fell to new lows of 18 
percent.  The newspaper also ran a banner headline on page three 
that read "54 Percent of People Polled Want Bian to Step Down, a 
Historical New High." 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
pro-independence "Liberty Times," Taiwan's biggest daily, criticized 
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and his pro-China, anti-Japan stance as he 
is about to complete his first year as the party chairman tomorrow. 
An editorial in the pro-unification "United Daily News," on the 
other hand, regarded former DPP Chairman Shih's campaign to oust 
Chen as a no-confidence vote on him.  End summary. 
 
A) "Ma Ying-jeou Shows His Real Face" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 600,000] 
editorialized (8/18): 
 
"... During the period when Lien Chan was the KMT chairman, both the 
ruling and opposition parties were engaged in irrational 
confrontations in the Legislative Yuan, which basically stalled the 
entire government's operations.  After Ma Ying-jeou took the helm at 
the KMT, his practices did not match the rational, gentle image that 
he claimed to have created, and bills related to arms sales and 
appointments of Control Yuan members were boycotted [by the pan-Blue 
camp] as before.  Pointless infighting and spinning remained the key 
notes of Blue-Green confrontations over the past year.  What the 
outside is concerned with, in particular, are Ma's ethnic ideology 
and his positions on unification and independence.  Ma seems to have 
shown his real face within just one year.  Over this past year, Ma, 
who used to label himself as one of the 'new Taiwan people,' brought 
up the discourse about [Taiwan's] 'ultimate unification  [with 
China]' without any hesitation, showing his 'pro-China and 
anti-Japan' tendency. ...  In short, to put it bluntly, Ma's goal to 
run for the chairmanship of the KMT was to pave the way for his 
presidential campaign in 2008.  As to whether Ma is capable of 
running a country, and whether he has the determination and courage 
to consolidate the Taiwan-centered values, his performance over the 
past year has provided sufficient material for the voters to examine 
[and decide]." 
 
B) "A Million People Each Donating One Hundred New Taiwan Dollars Is 
A No-Confidence Referendum on President Chen" 
 
"... This campaign [of collecting NT$100 each from a million Taiwan 
people] is not merely a warm-up for the movement to oust Bian; it is 
in the meantime a campaign for the Taiwan people to save themselves. 
 What the Taiwan public wants to save is the national machine that 
has been controlled by meritless politicians, and Taiwan's 
democracy, which has been eroded by a corrupt head of state.  To put 
it more concretely, since the campaign of collecting NT$100 from 
each person can reach out to the grass roots and thus has its 
universality, it can be viewed as the Taiwan people's alternative 
'no-confidence vote' on President Chen Shui-bian. ...  What's most 
important now is to transform the public's passion for donating 
money into energy for mass street rallies, and to get ready for any 
possible counterattack forces.  It will be a tough battle to try to 
win back Taiwan's democracy from those rascal politicians."
