SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050094533 AND 050091122 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 050094533 and 050091122 for 
the export of ammunition to South Africa.  Post is requested 
to complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request:  The end-user, Digital Image 
Warehouse, has been party to several licenses but has never 
been subject to a Blue Lantern end-use monitoring check.  The 
same import permit on International Trade Administration 
Commission of South Africa (ITAC) letterhead was used for 
both transactions but lacks a signature or seal from the 
import authorities.  This request is to establish the bona 
fides of the company and these transactions. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to verify that the 
ammunition listed below was received by Digital Image 
Warehouse (NOTE: These export licenses and import 
authorizations expired before the company could import all 
the ammunition listed on the licenses).  Post is also 
requested to establish the bona fides of the end-user by 
making inquiries to representatives of the company and 
appropriate GOA authorities.  The following points are 
included for guidance: 
 
(To Digital Image Warehouse) 
 
--When was your company established and who are its 
principals?  What products and services does your company 
provide? 
 
--How long have you been in the business of importing and 
selling defense articles?  Who are your regular customers and 
where do they reside?  What specific calibers of bullets did 
you import on these licenses?  What is the finished 
ammunition generally used for in South Africa? 
 
--What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin defense articles? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To GOA Export/Import Authorities) 
 
--Is Digital Image Warehouse properly authorized to import 
and sell defense articles in South Africa? 
 
--Do you have any information on Digital Image Warehouse that 
would question their reliability as a recipient of U.S. 
defense articles? 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
