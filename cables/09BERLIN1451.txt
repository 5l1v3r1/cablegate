¶1. (U) SUMMARY: From November 2-8, the number of confirmed 
H1N1 infections in Germany rose by 14,890 cases to a total of 
53,957 cases.  Five more H1N1 related deaths were reported in 
Germany, increasing the total number of deaths to sixteen. 
Germany plans to order 150,000 doses of a non-adjuvant vaccine 
for pregnant women.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) At its November 16 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 14,890 new (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) H1N1 cases in Germany from November 2 to November 
8, increasing the total number of H1N1 cases to 53,957. 
Bavaria remains the German state with the highest number of 
confirmed virus cases, with a total of 19,674, followed by 
Nord Rhine-Westphalia (9,747) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (6,753). 
 
Five more German H1N1 Deaths 
----------------------------- 
¶3. (U) RKI has confirmed the deaths of five additional 
patients due to H1N1.  Three people from Bavaria aged 33, 52 
and 63, and two from Nordrhein-Westphalia, aged 32 and 25, 
died in Germany due to the new virus.  In all cases, the 
individuals were considered to be "risk patients" and had 
underlying health conditions.  This increases the number of 
H1N1 deaths in Germany to sixteen. 
 
¶4. (U) Media reports indicate that a 55-year old man from 
Thuringia died on November 12, shortly after receiving the 
H1N1 vaccination.  It is unclear at this point if he died due 
to an adverse reaction to the vaccine or to a pre-existing 
medical condition.  RKI has not yet confirmed that his death 
was caused by H1N1. 
 
 
Germany to order non-adjuvant vaccine for pregnant women 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
¶5. (U) At a meeting with the state health ministers on 
November 11, Federal Health Minister Philipp RQsler called on 
the German population to allow medical personnel and sick 
people to be vaccinated first.  A mass vaccination will not be 
possible before December, due to supply shortages.  At the 
conference, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) 
confirmed plans to increase the production of H1N1 vaccine in 
the coming weeks; however, the amount it will be able to 
deliver will still fall short of what the German states are 
expecting.  GSK plans to deliver 20 million doses of the 50 
million doses ordered by the end of the year.  The remaining 
30 million doses will be delivered in the first quarter of 
¶2010. 
 
¶6. (U)  At the conference, the minister and the federal states 
agreed to order 150,000 doses of a non-adjuvant vaccine for 
pregnant woman produced by Australian pharmaceutical company 
CSL.  The vaccine is expected as early as the end of November.
