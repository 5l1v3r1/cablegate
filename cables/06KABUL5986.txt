SUBJECT: PRT/NURISTAN: INAUGURATION OF PRT NURISTAN 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Provincial Reconstruction Team Nuristan was 
officially inaugurated at Qala Gush in Western Nuristan on 
November 19.  The Qala Gush site is the larger of two 
temporary PRT sites in Nuristan Province conducting Civil 
Affairs activities (the other being near Kamdesh in the 
eastern part of the Province).  Speaking at the ceremony, 
attended by representatives from communities throughout the 
region, Ambassador Neumann used the occasion to highlight 
past and current U.S. assistance activities benefiting the 
province and to underscore the U.S. was committed to Nuristan 
province and Afghanistan for the long-term.  COMISAF GEN 
Richards, CJTF-76 CG MG Freakley, and Task Force Spartan 
Commander Col. Nicholson also spoke.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (U) The PRT for mountainous Nuristan province was 
officially inaugurated at a ceremony on November 19 at the 
Forward Operating Base located at Qala Gush, near the 
Nurgaram district administrative center in western Nuristan. 
Against a backdrop of Nuristan's peaks mantled by the 
season's first snows and under a blue sky crisscrossed by 
contrails from military aircraft, Ambassador Neumann, ISAF 
Commanding General Richards, CJTF-76 Commander, Major General 
Freakley, and Task Force Spartan Commander Colonel Nicholson 
participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony along with 
Nuristan Governor Tamim Nuristani.  Representatives of the 
Afghan and international press covered the event.  Officials 
from the three districts in western Nuristan and delegations 
from communities were also present. 
 
¶3.  (U) In his remarks, COMISAF General Richards cited the 
significance of establishing a PRT in the region.  He urged 
all present to use the winter months to work together in 
making plans and preparations for stepped-up activities when 
the weather improves in the spring. 
 
¶4.  (U) Ambassador Neumann noted that the inauguration of a 
PRT in Nuristan was the culmination of a sustained effort 
over several years.  Already present in Nuristan Province, 
USAID has funded 12 schools and four clinics with a fifth 
under construction.  USAID funded training for the 
presidential and parliamentary elections.  Wheat seed and 
fertilizer provided by USAID Alternative Livelihood Programs 
have been distributed in the province and several road 
projects are underway.  The Ambassador emphasized the U.S. 
commitment to a secure, democratic and prosperous Afghanistan 
by working together with the Afghan people.  "We intend to be 
here for a long time," he concluded. 
 
¶5.  (U) An elder from Pashgar village, Nurgaram district, 
offered his community's welcome to the coalition and 
international forces in their efforts to rebuild Afghanistan. 
 He called the roads that are being built in the province by 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as the most important 
development for the people of Nuristan.  With Nuristan 
divided into three valleys, these new roads will help 
overcome the divisions.  He praised Governor Tamim for his 
"sacrifices" for the people of Nuristan.  They owe him 
special thanks, he said.  The elder concluded by declaring 
that the people of Nuristan stand ready to help the 
international community in developing their province. 
 
¶6.  (U) In his remarks, Governor Nuristani noted that he had 
discussed the establishment of a PRT in the province with 
President Karzai who expressed his support.  The Governor 
noted that more than $40 million has been allocated by the 
U.S. for roads in the province.  In addition, a provincial 
security center costing 200 million Afghanis ($4 million) is 
under construction at the provincial center.  He expressed 
his appreciation for the other PRT facility that was 
operating at Kamdesh in eastern Nuristan. 
 
¶7.  (U) Following the speeches, the principals joined in 
cutting a ribbon at the entrance to the base to mark the 
official opening of the PRT.  Governor Nuristani and the 
representatives from local communities then sat together in a 
shura where individuals expressed their opinions and concerns

to the governor.  Most speakers complained about the lack of 
government services, schools, clinics, roads and security, 
and the protracted absences of government officials from 
their duty stations.  They also lambasted local officials as 
corrupt and rapacious, not interested in serving the people, 
and only using their offices to enrich themselves.  Several 
speakers complained to the Governor about his indifference to 
the region, noting that he had not previously visited during 
his tenure.  The Governor, who listened placidly to the 
speakers, did not respond to specific criticisms but in 
response stressed the need to cooperate, particularly on 
improving security.  He urged the people to inform government 
officials when anti-government individuals and groups were 
present in the region. 
 
¶8. (U) The region surrounding the Qala Gush FOB/PRT is 
sparsely populated and, like the rest of the province, has no 
population concentration that could be considered larger than 
a village.  The nearest community to the PRT is Nangarach, a 
settlement consisting of a few dozen houses, a health clinic, 
the only boy's school operating in the entire province 
offering 12 grades, and an eight-grade girls' school.  The 
PRT lies adjacent to the only road that affords vehicular 
access to Nuristan's three western districts: Nurgram, Mandol 
and Doab.  For Afghans, Qala Gush is known as the site where, 
in February 1919, the Afghan ruler, Amir Habibullah, was 
assassinated under mysterious conditions while on a 
bird-hunting expedition from his winter palace in Jalalabad. 
 
¶9. (U) PRT Nuristan (West) occupies a purpose-built base at 
Qala Gush in Nurgram district near the district 
administrative offices.  It is the larger of two PRT sites in 
the province conducting Civil Affairs and the home to the 
Department of State PRT Officer.  The military unit of the 
PRT at Qala Gush includes Army, Navy and Air Force personnel 
from both active duty and the reserves.  This same team had 
been located at Tarin Kowt until August 1 when the Oruzgan 
PRT was turned over the the Dutch.  The U.S. forces moved to 
Qala Gush and began construction on the base in late 
September. 
 
¶10. (U) The two PRT sites currently in operation in Nuristan 
Province were established on a temporary basis until a 
sufficient road network could be put in place to allow 
unrestricted access to most areas of the province, making a 
centrally located PRT possible in the provincial capital of 
Parun, which is located hhigh in a remote alpine valley of 
central Nuristan.  Until the permanent central PRT is 
established, PRT Nuristan (West) will be home to the main PRT 
staff, while Forward Operating Base (FOB)/PRT Kamdesh (East) 
will support a small Civil Affairs Detachment covering 
Kamdesh and Barg Matal districts.  PRT Kunar located at 
Asadabad continues to engage with Nuristanis from Waygal and 
Wama districts in central Nuristan. 
 
¶11.  (U) COMMENT:  The official launch of PRT Nuristan at 
Qala Gush rather than the provincial center of Parun points 
to the unique challenges that beset coalition efforts to 
support strengthening of security and governance functions 
and accelerating development in this geographically divided 
province.  The move to Parun is not likely to occur any time 
soon given the need to first build and secure roads 
connecting the Provincial capital to the rest of the 
province.  While the Qala Gush base itself is temporary, the 
Ambassador underscored in his remarks that the U.S. has a 
long-term commitment to Nuristan and to Afghanistan as a 
whole.
