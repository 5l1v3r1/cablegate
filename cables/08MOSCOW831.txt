¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export

¶2. Reftel requested a pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Atlantis Communications, Moscow, Russia. The company 
is listed on BIS license application D390433 as the 
ultimate consignee of cm4 Linux unity software, 
operating system for the media gateways. These items 
are controlled for national security and anti-

¶07920. 
 
¶3. On March 24, 2008, Export Control Attache Peter 
Liston and LES Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of Atlantis 
Communications, 2-nd Zvenigorodskaya st., 13, bld.40, 
Moscow, Russia. The Export Control Team met with 
Sergey Melnik, Head of Telephone System Department, 
Tatiana Kramarenko, Channel Account Manager (Avaya 
Co.), Igor Krivoruchenko, Director, Govermnent Sector 
Russia and CIS (Avaya Co.), Dmitry Koshelev, Deputy 
Head of Technical Department, Central Administrative 
Board of Ministry of Internal Affairs (GUVD, Moscow 
Police Traffic Department) and Andrey Bushuev, Head of 
Technical Department, Central Administrative Board of 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (GUVD, Moscow Police 
Traffic Department). 
 
¶4. Atlantis Communications is a solely owned and 
operated Russian company that was founded in 1998 and 
employs approximately 300 people.  Atlantis purchases 
primarily U.S. origin telecommunications equipment 
(AT&T and Lucent) for re-sale on the Russian market. 
Atlantis does not sell to customers outside of the 
Russian Federation. 
 
¶5. The commodity in subject reftel has been purchased 
by Atlantis through the license applicant Avaya, in 
order to upgrade the telecommunications equipment 
currently in place at the Moscow City Traffic Police 
(GUVD).  The equipment currently in place with the 
GUVD is also U.S. origin and is approximately 10 years 
old. 
 
¶6.  Atlantis Communications, and the ultimate end-user 
GUVD, appear to have the technical and commercial 
sophistication consistent with that for which the 
commodity in question was designed.  Atlantis 
Communication and GUVD appear to have a legitimate 
need for the commodity in subject reftel. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Atlantis 
Communications and Central Administrative Board of 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (GUVD, Moscow Police 
Traffic Department), Moscow, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
requested that Post be notified of final disposition 
of the application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
