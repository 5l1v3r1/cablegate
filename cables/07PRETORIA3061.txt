¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The SAG is interested in the Global 
Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) and is considering whether 
Minister of Minerals and Energy Buyelwa Sonjica can change 
her travel schedule in order to participate.  Defining a role 
for South Africa in GNEP might support U.S. efforts to sell 
and expand the partnership to other countries.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Economic Counselor and Minerals and Energy Officer 
delivered the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) 
invitation and information on the Ministerial in Vienna 
September 16 (Reftels) to Department of Minerals and Energy 
(DME) Chief Director: Nuclear Tselio Maqubela on August 27, 
following up with a cover letter signed by the CDA on August 
¶28.   Embassy officers also delivered an electronic copy of 
the materials to Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Director 
Fadl Nacerodien. DME POC is Mahlatsi Koma 
(mahlatsi.koma@dme.gov.za; ( 27 12) 317 8356).  Embassy POC 
is Energy Officer David Young (YoungDK@state.gov; ( 27 12) 
431 4681). 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Maqubela promised to check with Minister of 
Minerals and Energy Buyelwa Sonjica about her participation 
in the GNEP event, but was unable to promise her attendance, 
noting that she planned to arrive in Vienna on the afternoon 
of September 16 for the IAEA Ministerial the following day. 
Maqubela sought confirmation that the GNEP Statement of 
Principles was not a binding international treaty.  Economic 
Counselor subsequently confirmed the voluntary and 
non-binding nature of the GNEP Partnership and associated 
Principles. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Maqubela recommended that there be prior 
consultation with many developing countries in order to build 
consensus and avoid the perception of exclusivity on the part 
of the developed countries.  He then expanded at length on 
the positive example of collaborative progress made in 
explaining and obtaining support for the U.S. nuclear 
cooperation agreement with India.  "The point is to build 
consensus before you formalize things," Maqubela said.  "You 
should talk to some developing countries (i.e., South Africa) 
and gain the support of a number of them.  If you form 
partnerships with just major countries, you risk alienating 
developing countries that could have participated if they had 
been consulted earlier," he continued.  "There are a lot of 
things going on in the nuclear area where we could have done 
more if the approach had been different."  Maqubela observed 
that "there is now a broad understanding on the India issue, 
given good consultation and information sharing."  He 
applauded that the India issue was worked closely in the 
Nuclear Suppliers Group.  But, he asked: "The question 
remains how this will affect the NPT (Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty)? And what happens to Israel and 
Pakistan -- will there be more separate deals?" Minerals and 
Energy Officer pointed out the broad invitation list to the 
GNEP Ministerial, including demarches and consultations in 
capitals, as evidence of the effort to include developing 
countries. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Returning to the invitation to participate in GNEP, 
Maqubela asked what would be the appropriate representation 
in the event that the Minister is unable to participate, 
noting that it may have to be the SAG Ambassador in Vienna. 
Embassy Officers urged the highest possible level of SAG 
participation, but said that any representation would be 
better than none at all.  Embassy Officers also discussed the 
new SAG draft nuclear energy policy (Ref D), the Westinghouse 
bid for new nuclear power stations (Septel), the proposed 
bilateral nuclear R&D cooperation agreement (Septel), and the 
program for return of spent fuel (Septel). 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment: Defining a role for South Africa in GNEP 
might support U.S. efforts to expand the partnership to other 
countries.  For example, South Africa could be a valuable 
partner in providing comprehensive fuel services, perhaps as 
part of a consortium that does not involve sharing enrichment 
technology.  End Comment.
