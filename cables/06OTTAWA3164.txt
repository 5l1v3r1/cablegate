RABAT, DG TO BRIEF 
 
REF: STATE 173436 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We joined our Russian counterpart to convey reftel 
to Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT) Deputy Director for International Nuclear 
Cooperation, Compliance and Export Control Shawn Caza, and 
Senior Adviser Janice Fitchett.  Caza reaffirmed earlier word 
that DFAIT Assistant Deputy Minister and PolDir Colleen 
Swords would lead the Canadian delegation to the GI/CNT 
conference in Rabat. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Caza said that the Canadians would not meet the 
October 18 deadline to submit their expert level briefing on 
the safe transportation of nuclear materials.  He noted, 
however, that Director General Troy Lulyshanyk planned to 
deliver a presentation on day two of the Rabat conference 
entitled "Canada's Global Partnership Program on Preventing 
Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism Domestically and 
Internationally."  This briefing would last 20-minutes, would 
include Microsoft Power-point slides, and could easily be 
extended at our request. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Caza noted that his Director, Mark Gwozdecky, would 
double-track this information via telephone to ISN/WMDT 
Director Thomas Lehrman.
