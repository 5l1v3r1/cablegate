E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/01/2007 
TAGS: PTER PGOV PINS CO
SUBJECT: PUBLIC PROTESTS GROW IN THE FACE OF FARC 
ATTACKS 
 
REFS: A) BOGOTA 00918 B) BOGOTA 00879 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ANNE W. PATTERSON FOR REASONS: 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: AS THE FARC'S WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND 
DESTRUCTION CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, PRESIDENT 
PASTRANA MET WITH HIS TOP MILITARY AND CIVILIAN ADVISORS 
TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO COMBAT THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS. 
MEANWHILE, POPULAR ATTITUDES ARE HARDENING AGAINST THE 
FARC, AS PEOPLE TAKE TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST THE 
INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------- 
ATTACKS CONTINUE 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) THE FARC'S WAVE OF VIOLENCE CONTINUES, DESPITE 
THE GROWING POPULAR CONDEMNATION OF THE GUERRILLA 
ATTACKS.  ON JANUARY 30, THE FARC DETONATED A CAR BOMB 
BEHIND THE CARACOL TV AND RADIO BUILDING IN CENTRAL 
BOGOTA.  NO ONE WAS HURT IN THE ATTACK, BUT SIX PEOPLE 
WERE KILLED AND 25 WERE INJURED IN FLORENCIA (CAQUETA 
DEPARTMENT) WHEN THE FARC ACTIVATED A BOMB WHILE A 
MILITARY CONVOY WAS PASSING BY.  THEY ALSO EXPLODED TWO 
PACKAGE BOMBS IN FRONT OF THE ARMY'S 5TH MECHANIZED 
DIVISION BARRACKS IN MEDELLIN. 
 
--------------------- 
NEW SECURITY MEASURES 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) ON JANUARY 31, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT ANDRES 
PASTRANA HELD A SECURITY SUMMIT WITH HIGH-LEVEL 
POLITICAL AND MILITARY OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS MEASURES TO 
COMBAT THE FARC OFFENSIVE.  THE SUMMIT WAS ATTENDED BY 
INTERIOR MINISTER ARMANDO ESTRADA, JUSTICE MINISTER 
ROMULO GONZALEZ, VICE PRESIDENT AND DEFENSE MINISTER 
GUSTAVO BELL, ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL JORGE ENRIQUE MORA, 
NAVY COMMANDER ADMIRAL SOTO, POLICE DIRECTOR LUIS 
ERNESTO GILIBERT AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF 
SECURITY (DAS - FBI EQUIVALENT) DIRECTOR COLONEL GERMAN 
GUSTAVO JARAMILLO.  SUBSEQUENTLY, PRESIDENT PASTRANA 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS IMPLEMENTING THE 
FOLLOWING SECURITY MEASURES: 
 
-- INSPECTION CHECKPOINTS AT THE ENTRANCES AND EXITS OF 
ALL CITIES; 
 
-- MOBILE CHECKPOINTS INSIDE THE CITIES; 
 
-- RAIDS OF SITES WHERE ATTACKS ARE BEING PLANNED; AND 
 
-- AN INCREASE OF FUNDS TO PAY INFORMANTS. 
 
---------------- 
GROWING PROTESTS 
---------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) THE NEW MEASURES WERE ANNOUNCED AS PUBLIC 
OPINION CONCERNING THE FARC'S TACTICS HAS TURNED 
STRONGLY AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS.  ON WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 
30, THE RESIDENTS OF META PROVINCE HELD A 15-MINUTE 
"POT-BANGING PROTEST" TO VOICE THEIR OBJECTION TO THE 
FARC'S RECENT ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, WHILE BOGOTA MAYOR 
ANTANAS MOCKUS LED A SIMILAR PROTEST IN NORTHERN BOGOTA. 
THIS PROTEST FOLLOWED A THREE-MINUTE "LIGHTS-OUT" IN 
BOGOTA TO PROTEST THE FARC'S ATTACKS ON THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH HAVE DESTROYED SCORES OF 
ELECTRICAL PYLONS AND HAVE DAMAGED A MAJOR WATER SUPPLY 
FOR THE CAPITAL. 
 
¶5.  (U) EVEN THOSE WHO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PEACE 
PROCESS HAVE CONDEMNED THE FARC ATTACKS.  INGRID 
BETANCOURT, AN INDEPENDENT "GREEN" PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE, SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE FARC AND CALLED ON THE 
GUERRILLAS TO CEASE THESE ATTACKS.  ANDERS KOMPASS, 
DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH 
COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN COLOMBIA, DESCRIBED THE 
ATTACKS AS "DEPLORABLE" AND "COUNTERPRODUCTIVE." 
 
-------------------- 
MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS 
-------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) WHILE IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER THE COLMIL HAS 
RE-DEPLOYED FROM ITS STAGING POINT OUTSIDE OF THE FARC'S 
SAFE HAVEN ("DESPEJE"), DAO REPORTS THAT THE COLAR'S 
21ST BATTALION BASED IN GRANADA HAS BEEN DEFENDING KEY 
POPULATION CENTERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE REGION 
AROUND THE DESPEJE (REF B).  THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE 
(FUDRA) ALSO HAS BEEN CONDUCTING OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS 
AGAINST THE FARC'S 26TH FRONT AND IS STILL FORWARD 
DEPLOYED IN META DEPARTMENT. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
¶7. (C) ANALYSTS HAVE POSITED A NUMBER OF THEORIES ABOUT 
THE FARC'S ONGOING OFFENSIVE.  SOME SENIOR MILITARY AND 
POLICE OFFICIALS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE FARC HAS 
MARKEDLY STEPPED UP ITS ATTACKS AROUND BOGOTA, 
SUGGESTING THAT THE GUERRILLAS MIGHT BE TRYING TO 
ISOLATE THE CAPITAL.  MANY OBSERVERS ALSO BELIEVE THE 
FARC'S ACTIONS ARE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO DEMONSTRATE 
THEIR MILITARY CAPABILITIES, APPARENTLY IN THE HOPES OF 
BOLSTERING THEIR LEVERAGE AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. 
ANOTHER THEORY IS THAT THE FARC IS STEPPING UP ITS 
ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO DRAW COLMIL 
FORCES AWAY FROM THE DESPEJE -- IN EFFECT, FORCING THE 
MILITARY TO LOOSEN THE SECURITY CONTROLS ON THE FARC 
SAFE HAVEN, SOMETHING THAT THE GOC HAD REFUSED TO DO IN 
THE NEGOTIATIONS.  WHATEVER THEIR MOTIVES, THE FARC'S 
LATEST OFFENSIVE MIGHT BE A PYHRRIC VICTORY.  WHILE 
THEIR ATTACKS HAVE HAD A PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT ON THE 
POPULACE (ESPECIALLY IN THE CITIES), THESE ACTIONS HAVE 
PRODUCED A POLITICAL REACTION THAT ULTIMATELY UNDERMINES 
THE FARC'S INTERESTS.
