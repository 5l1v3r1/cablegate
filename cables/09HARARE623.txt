SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE'S ANTI-TRAFFICKING HOTLINE STRUGGLES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 78132 
 
¶1. (U) Zimbabwe's anti-trafficking hotline, which was 
launched in December 2008, has received relatively few calls, 
largely due to inadequate publicity and public awareness of 
the hotline.  After initial troubles with the functionality 
of the line, hotline operators report that the phone number 
is now working.  Regrettably, hotline operators are fielding 
few calls. 
 
¶2. (U) There is one anti-trafficking hotline in Zimbabwe. 
Information below is keyed to questions in reftel. 
 
Country: Zimbabwe 
Local Number: 0800-32-22-222 
Organization Operating the Hotline: Oasis Zimbabwe (this 
local NGO runs the hotline with funding from the 
International Organization for Migration) 
Notes/Comments: The hotline works best when dialed from a 
landline.  Callers using Zimbabwean cellular phones may not 
be able to reach the hotline.
