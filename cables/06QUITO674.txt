SUBJECT: VEGA NAMED NEW MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  Felipe Vega de La Cuadra was announced as 
the next Minister of Government and will be sworn in on March 
20, becoming President Palacio's fifth Minister of 
Government.  Vega replaces Alfredo Castillo in the volatile 
position, after Castillo submitted his resignation amid 
anti-FTA protests on March 15.  The leftist Castillo had 
largely become marginalized after taking public positions out 
of sync with other Cabinet members.  As Vice Minister, Vega 
played a prominent role, including in negotiations with 
striking provinces demanding money from the central 
government.  We are encouraged by the change, which removes 
the main FTA critic in the Cabinet and promotes Vega, a much 
more capable political negotiator and strategist.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Vega, 45, was named presidential secretary in 
September 2005, and then Vice Foreign Minister in January 
2006, coinciding with Castillo's naming.  A native of the 
southern highland city of Cuenca, Vega studied Civil 
Engineering and Philosophy at the University of Cuenca.  He 
also studied psychology at Loja's Technical University. 
Previous positions include:  Cultural Director for the city 
of Cuenca, Director of Tourism (Santa Cruz, Galapagos), 
advisor to Congress, governor of Azuay province, Director of 
the Mariscal Sucre Political and Social Science Institute, 
and Director and Executive President of Pacifictel. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Vega was named Vice Minister by Palacio to keep the 
leftist Castillo from crossing policy lines on the FTA or 
other USG interests and be the "adult" in the Ministry. 
Castillo quickly proved to be out of step with the 
administration, and was frequently contradicted by other 
Cabinet members.  His final transgression was to encourage 
anti-FTA protesters, violating Palacio's private assurances 
Castillo would have no role in the issue.  Thankfully, the 
Vega transition will probably not involve staff changes, 
preserving good cooperation from Ministry staff against 
trafficking in persons.
