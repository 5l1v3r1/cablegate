¶1.  (U) Summary:  The state of emergency declared in five of 
Ecuador's 22 provinces has permitted the GOE to clear road 
blockages in all but the north-central province of Imbabura, 
where protesters continue to return obstacles to the street 
as fast as authorities can clear them.  Some clashes between 
protesters and authorities are being reported, possibly 
including injuries.  The Catholic Church has offered to 
mediate between the government and indigenous demands, and 
has delivered a petition from the indigenous which awaits a 
GOE response.  In a disturbing new development, three 
anti-FTA pamphlet bombs reportedly exploded in Cuenca.  End 
Summary. 
 
GOE Opens Roads, Meeting Some Resistance 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Ecuador's national police chief told NAS Chief on 
March 23 that military and police have been working in 
concert to enforce the state of emergency.  Violent clashes 
between protesters and authorities in north-central Imbabura 
province, north of Otavalo, were reported around midday on 
March 23, possibly involving injuries.  Earlier the same day, 
three anti-FTA pamphlet bombs were exploded in Cuenca, 
Ecuador's third-largest city, without injury.  Claiming 
credit was the Popular Combatants Group (GCP) -- a radical 
leftist group that has claimed responsibility for such bombs 
in Quito in the past.  The state of emergency in the 
provinces of Imbabura, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, Canar and parts 
of Pichincha imposed curfews from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and 
sanctions any actions that impede public services.    Farmers 
in southern provinces of Loja, Zamora Chinchipe and Los Rios, 
blocked roads on March 22 to demand compensation for crop 
losses caused by recent flooding, but lifted the blocks on 
March 23. 
 
¶3.  (U) While the highway blockages have decreased, students 
and teachers, social groups, union workers and indigenous 
groups are continuing to conduct peaceful protests in the 
capital, with a steady stream of small Quito marches 
scheduled throughout the day March 23.  Many indigenous 
marchers are camped out at Quito's National Politechnic 
University.  On March 22, a group of approximately 2,000 
protesters passed outside the Embassy en route to the 
Ecuadorian Congress.  Police dispersed the group, permitting 
only 16 leaders to proceed to the lawmakers' headquarters. 
Most protesters carry banners against the FTA on the eve of 
what is perceived here as the final round of negotiations in 
Washington beginning today.  Protesters chanted "FTA signed, 
Palacio Ousted."  They insist that the public should 
ultimately decide the FTA by referendum. 
 
Dialogue Blocked, Church Offers Mediation 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) President Palacio told the press on March 22 he 
opposed a referendum vote on the FTA, saying it was moot 
until an FTA agreement were reached.  Once reached, an FTA 
would be submitted to Congress, which could consider a 
referendum at that time.  A meeting between indigenous 
coalition CONAIE and the government scheduled for the 
afternoon of March 22 did not take place because indigenous 
leaders reportedly did not show up.  Government Minister 
Felipe Vega spent March 22 meeting with leaders of Congress, 
the Attorney General and Solicitor General to discuss the 
government's plans for restoring order. 
 
¶5.  (U) The president of the Catholic Episcopal Conference of 
Bishops offered on March 22 to mediate between protester and 
the government.  CONAIE leader Luis Macas has reportedly 
asked the Church to convey indigenous FTA concerns to 
Palacio.  CONAIE leaders pledged to suspend or renew road 
blockages based on the president's response.  On March 16, 
the church had issued a statement calling for the government 
to hold a referendum on the FTA prior to national elections 
in October.  Some commentators have noted in the local press 
that, despite 19 months of effort, FTA opponents have not 
been able to collect the 700,000 signatures required to call 
a referendum under the constitution. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The opening of roads in some provinces is 
encouraging, as is the Church's mediating role, but it 
remains unclear whether the protests are being overcome. 
Also unclear is the effect reaching an FTA agreement would 
have.  While some speculate that announcement of an agreement 
would fan the flames, others believe it would be seen as a 
fait accompli and help calm the situation.  Regardless, the 
GOE firmly intends to continue FTA negotiations in 
Washington.
