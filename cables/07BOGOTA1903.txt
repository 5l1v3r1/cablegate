¶22. (SBU) The Visas Viper Committee also discussed the status 
of the Colombian Supreme Court investigation into  Colombian 
Senators' and Representatives' alleged ties to AUC 
paramilitaries and others involved in the "parapolitics" 
scandal (reftel).  Specifically, the Committee reviewed the 
cases of Alvaro Araujo Noguera, Jorge de Jesus Castro 
Pacheco, Miguel Angel Duran Gelvis, Hernando Cesar de Jesus 
Molina Araujo, Ciro Ramirez Pinzon, and Oscar Leonidas 
Wilches Carreno.  The Committee determined that additional 
information is needed before submission to Visas Viper. 
Given that these individuals are currently under criminal 
investigation, however, the Consular Section, in concurrence 
with the Visas Viper Committee, is taking action to revoke 
the visas of those who hold them, as these individuals 
currently pose a flight risk. 
 
¶23. (SBU) The Committee discussed the cases of six sitting 
mayors who have been called for questioning by a prosecutor 
with the National Anticorruption Unit.  The mayors are under 
investigation for alleged ties to the ACC (Casanare Peasant 
Self-Defense Group), having signed a document in which they 
agreed to channel part of their towns' budgets to 
paramilitary coffers.  Those implicated include: Raul Cabrera 
Barreto, Mayor of Villanueva; Aleyder Castaneda Avila, Mayor 
of Monterey; Mauricio Esteban Chaparro, Mayor of Sabanalarga; 
Jorge Eliecer Lopez Barreto, Mayor of Tauramena; Henry Montes 
Montes, Mayor of Mani; and Leonel Roberto Torres Arias, Mayor 
of Aguazul.  The subjects' ties to the AUC and the 
circumstances under which they signed the document remain 
unclear.  As such,the Committee determined that additional 
information is needed before submission to Visas Viper.  None 
of the mayors currently hold visas, and CLASS Lookouts have 
been added for each of them.
