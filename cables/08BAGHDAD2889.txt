¶2. The CIO training program is a capacity development initiative 
aimed at training information technology (IT) professionals in GOI 
ministries on developing and implementing IT policy and practices. 
In order to place the governance of Iraq on a more sound footing, 
and to provide ministries with reliable and auditable information 
management systems to support their decision-making, the GOI will 
appoint a federal CIO council and a CIO for each Iraqi Ministry.  In 
order to support this initiative and build Iraq IT management 
capacity, the Iraq Transition Assistance Office (ITAO) sponsored a 
two-week intensive CIO training workshop in Erbil, Iraq, 18 - 28 
August.  Five instructors from the Information Resources Management 
College of the U.S. National Defense University (NDU) designed and 
delivered the Iraq-specific curriculum at the Khanzad Hotel. 
Embassy Baghdad and Erbil RRT, in cooperation with the Iraq Ministry 
of Communications, coordinated the program in Iraq.  Training costs 
were paid by ITAO, while participant hotel and travel costs were 
provided by the GOI. 
¶3. The main topics presented in the two-week program included the 
role of a CIO, Business Process Re-engineering, Strategic Planning 
and Performance Management, Enterprise Architecture, Information 
Assurance, and Information Technology Acquisition.  Classes were 
designed with full consideration of Iraq's specific environment. 
The interactive workshop included a significant number of group 
activities, encouraging inter-ministry communication and 
cooperation.  Group projects were specifically targeted at issues 
common across the ministries. 
¶4. CIOs from the Iraq Ministries of Science and Technology, 
Communications, Higher Education, Electricity, Defense, Agriculture, 
Industry and Minerals, Construction and Housing, and Environment 
attended the training as well IT managers from the President's 
Office, the Prime Minister General Secretariat, and the Central 
Bank.  CIOs from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Ministries 
of Planning, Water Resources, Agriculture, Transportation and 
Communications, and Investment took part in the training, as well as 
CIOs from several private firms, including Zagros Group, Korek 
Telecom, Asiacell, and Newroz Telecom.
