¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) 
deputies are focusing on the party's legislative agenda and 
rallying supporters for the municipal elections, according to 
MRS Deputies Enrique Saenz, Victor Hugo Tinoco and Tinoco's 
alternate, Hugo Torres.  They are also using "volunteers" to 
assist them with their work in the National Assembly.  The 
MRS Deputies commented on Liberal caudillo Arnoldo Aleman's 
continued power in Nicaragua and their view of Daniel 
Ortega's presidency.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (C) Poloff and INR analysts met with MRS Deputies Enrique 
Saenz, Victor Hugo Tinoco and Tinoco's alternate, Hugo 
Torres, on March 20.  According to Saenz, the MRS is focusing 
on two fronts: strengthening the alliance of parties that 
make up the MRS and pursuing the party's legislative agenda. 
Saenz stated that they plan to look for allies within 
different parties in the National Assembly on an "issue by 
issue" basis.  Key MRS legislative concerns are increasing 
the minimum wage and energy issues. 
 
¶3.  (C) According to Tinoco, the MRS offers the best 
democratic option for Nicaraguans and the best chance to 
oppose the FSLN.  He believes that to succeed, opposition to 
the FSLN must "come from the left."  Saenz stated, however, 
that the MRS will continue to work with the ALN on certain 
issues.  He commented that Eduardo Montealegre is still 
tainted by the CENIs (debt bonds) issue and that there would 
probably be some kind of announcement or action against 
Montealegre after Easter. 
 
MRS Relying on Volunteers

¶4.  (C) Saenz reported that the MRS is tapping supporters, 
especially lawyers, to work as unofficial assistants on the 
party's legislative agenda.  The MRS is unable to pay them, 
but a number of people are helping by analyzing and 
evaluating proposed legislation.  Saenz said that more 
supporters would be needed to help with municipal elections. 
 
MRS Take on Aleman

¶5. (C) Tinoco commented that the expansion of Arnoldo 
Aleman's "house arrest" to all of Nicaragua is a sign of the 
continuing strength of the pact; in fact, he believes it is 
stronger than ever.  Tinoco believes that Ortega cannot 
imagine being out of power.  Ortega "released" Aleman to 
accomplish several short term and long term goals, according 
to Tinoco, which include PLC support for FSLN candidates for 
the Fiscalia and constitutional reforms. 
 
Ortega's Scheming

¶6.  (C) The MRS deputies believe Ortega's political 
machinations constitute an "authoritarian project" which is 
gaining strength.  Saenz said he fears that Ortega will 
pacify the business community and the small and medium-size 
producers by allowing a certain amount of economic freedom 
and by taking 
actions that benefit those sectors so no one will stand up to 
him as he consolidates political power.   Torres stated that 
Ortega and wife Rosario Murillo are "pulling all the 
strings."  He added that they have a number of people who are 
in their "inner circle" who they manipulate by creating 
tensions among them.  He emphasized that Ortega and Murillo 
maintain a very strong relationship. 
 
¶7.  (C) Torres commented that he holds hope for the future of 
the military.  Omar Halleslevens, Chief of the Nicaraguan 
Army, and Torres were schoolmates and Torres respects him. 
He believes that Halleslevens will be able to stand up to 
Ortega.  Torres also assessed that Police Chief Aminta 
Granera is very capable, politically astute, and has effected 
great changes within the police. 
 
¶8.  (C) On Venezuela, Saenz stated that Nicaraguans recognize 
the importance of the relationship with the United States, 
but if Venezuela's promises become reality, the relationship 
with the U.S. will be less important.
