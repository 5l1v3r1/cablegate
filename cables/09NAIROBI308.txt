SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR REQUESTS PERSONAL INTERVENTION OF 
KENYAN PM ON DADAAB 
 
REF: 09 NAIROBI 00267 
 
¶1. Following the Ambassador's meeting with the UNHCR Deputy 
High Commissioner (DHC) on February 5 (Reftel), the 
Ambassador sent the following letter to the Kenyan Prime 
Minister on February 18 urging the PM's personal intervention 
in implementing the package of activities agreed with the 
UNHCR DHC to relieve severe overcrowding in Dadaab. 
 
¶2.  BEGIN TEXT 
 
Dear Mr. Prime Minister: 
 
I was pleased to learn that during your meeting earlier this 
month with the UNHCR Deputy High Commissioner you had agreed 
to a package approach to resolve severe overcrowding in the 
Dadaab refugee camps.  I understand that the elements of the 
package agreed to include the allocation of land to establish 
a fourth camp, addressing more effectively host community 
needs, and the transfer of some refugees from Dadaab to 
Kakuma. 
 
I want to emphasize that the U.S. Government considers the 
implementation of this package an urgent humanitarian 
priority.  We are prepared to support the implementation of 
the package through generous support to UNHCR's Dadaab Appeal 
and with development assistance efforts in the region. 
 
Since delays in implementing the package exacerbate the 
humanitarian suffering of the refugees, I urge you to take 
concrete steps to ensure that the package agreed to with the 
UNHCR Deputy High Commissioner is implemented as quickly as 
possible.  Given the sensitivities involved, I request your 
personal intervention. 
 
The United States appreciates Kenya's hosting of over 250,000 
refugees and its commitment to humanitarian principles, and 
will continue to look for opportunities to help share this 
burden. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Michael E. Ranneberger 
Ambassador
