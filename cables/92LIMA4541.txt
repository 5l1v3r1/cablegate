-            CAMPAIGN VOWING NOT TO BE A

¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  AT A MARCH 21 PRESS 
CONFERENCE, EX-PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA CALLED FOR 
A NATIONAL FRONT AGAINST FUJIMORI; HE ALSO RULED 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

OUT HIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 1995.  GARCIA 
BLASTED ATTEMPTS BY THE FUJIMORI ADMINISTRATION 
TO REOPEN CORRUPTION CHARGES AGAINST HIM.  FEW 
IN LIMA BELIEVE THAT GARCIA WILL NOT RUN FOR 
PRESIDENT; IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW MANY ARE 
WILLING TO FOLLOW HIS LEAD INTO A NATIONAL 
ANTI-FUJIMORI FRONT.  END SUMMARY. 
REOPENING THE GARCIA CORRUPTION CASE 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U)  THE CATALYST FOR GARCIA'S PRESS 
CONFERENCE WAS THE GOP'S PUBLISHING OF A SUPREME 
DECREE AUTHORIZING THE SOLICITOR GENERAL TO 
REOPEN THE "ILLICIT ENRICHMENT" CHARGES AGAINST 
GARCIA.  GARCIA'S LAWYERS IMMEDIATELY HAD A 
LOW-LEVEL JUDGE ISSUE AN INJUNCTION AGAINST 
REOPENING THE CASE ON THE GROUNDS OF DOUBLE 
JEOPARDY.  GARCIA TOLD THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT 
THE SUPREME DECREE WAS A "JUDICIAL MONSTROSITY" 
AND THAT IT WAS THE ANSWER BY THE FUJIMORI 
ADMINISTRATION TO GARCIA'S CRITICISM OF GOP 
POLICIES.  GARCIA DECLARED IT WAS THE TIME TO 
BREAK THE INFORMAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND APRA AGAINST CRITICIZING THE 
ADMINISTRATION.  HE BLAMED FUJIMORI AND SOME OF 
HIS "MILITARY ADVISORS" FOR USING EVEN THE TAX 
OFFICE TO PERSECUTE HIM. 
 
GARCIA CALLS FOR A NATIONAL ANTI-FUJIMORI FRONT 
--------------------------------------------- --

¶4.  (U)  GARCIA DECLARED THAT FOR THE LAST 18 
MONTHS THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE HAD SUFFERED A PLAGUE 
OF "VICIOUS CAPITALISM" THAT HAD NOT BORN 
CONCRETE RESULTS.  HE CHARACTERIZED FUJIMORI'S 
TRIP TO JAPAN AS A COMPLETE FAILURE SINCE THE 
PRESIDENT RETURNED WITH "ONLY USDOLS 20 MILLION 
IN DONATIONS."  GARCIA CHARGED THAT BUSINESSMEN 
WHO THAT TRAVEL WITH FUJIMORI DO SO ONLY TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF MONEY TO BE MADE OFF OF ASSISTANCE 
CONTRACTS.  GARCIA ADDED THAT THE GULF BETWEEN 
FUJIMORI AND THE CONGRESS IS WIDENING AND THAT 
EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE CANNOT GET AN 
APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT. 
 
¶5.  (U)  REFERRING TO FAILURE OF MOTHERS FROM 
THE "GLASS OF MILK" PROGRAM TO SEE A GOP 
REPRESENTATIVE, GARCIA ASKED, "WHAT DANGER DO 
THESE POOR PERUVIAN MOTHERS REPRESENT WHEN THEY 
ONLY ASK FOR BREAD FOR THEIR CHILDREN?"  HE 
ALLEGED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS CUT OFF IN THE 
PALACE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A STRONG ORGANIZED 
PARTY.  THE OPPOSITION WAS COMPOSED OF A RIGHT 
WHOSE LEADER (MARIO VARGAS LLOSA) HAD LEFT THE 
COUNTRY, APRA WHICH HAD JUST LEFT OFFICE, AND A 
FRACTURED LEFT.  GARCIA STATED THAT THE ONLY WAY 
TO OPPOSE FUJIMORI WAS BY FORMING A UNITED FRONT 
FROM THESE ELEMENTS TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC 
REVITALIZATION AND PACIFICATION. 
 
"I WILL NOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT"

¶6.  (U)  GARCIA CLAIMED THAT AN IMPEDIMENT TO A 
SUCCESSFUL OPPOSITION TO FUJIMORI WAS THE 
CONFLICTING AMBITIONS OF POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATES.  THE WAY TO SOLVE THIS 
"CANDIDITITIS" WAS FOR POLITICAL LEADERS TO 
RENOUNCE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  TO SET THE 
EXAMPLE HE SAID, "I RENOUNCE BEING A CANDIDATE 
FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC IN 1995 TO 
PAVE THE WAY FOR THE NATIONAL FRONT."

¶7.  (C)  FEW IN LIMA TAKE SERIOUSLY GARCIA'S VOW 
THAT HE WILL NOT BE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. 
LAST MONTH HE PROCLAIMED THAT HE WAS NOT A 
CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE APRA 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PARTY.  WITHIN TWO WEEKS HE GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED 
THE JOB AFTER THE APRA CONVENTION INSISTED BY 
ACCLAMATION THAT HE AGREE TO ACCEPT THE HONOR. 
THE LIKELIHOOD OF HIS ORGANIZING A NATIONAL 
FRONT AGAINST FUJIMORI IS SLIM.  THE SECRETARY 
GENERAL OF THE ULTRA-LEFT PUM PARTY, A PARTY 
THAT SHARES THE SUBSTANCE OF MANY OF GARCIA'S 
CRITICISMS AGAINST FUJIMORI, TOLD POLOFFS THAT 
"HIS PARTY WOULD NEVER COOPERATE WITH APRA."  HE 
EXPLAINED THAT HE COULD DEAL WITH THE RIGHT 
BECAUSE HE KNEW THEIR IDEOLOGICAL POSITION, BUT 
COULD NOT COOPERATE WITH APRA BECAUSE THEY WERE 
SIMPLE OPPORTUNISTS.  THE OTHER PARTIES MAY BE 
PLAYING THE SAME SONG, BUT THEY ARE HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY TO ACCEPT ALAN GARCIA LEADING THE 
BAND.  QUAINTON
