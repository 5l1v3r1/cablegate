SUBJECT: GAZA HARVEST YIELDS LITTLE EXPORT REVENUE 
 
REF: 2007 JERUSALEM 2567 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Gaza strawberry and carnation export 
revenues were low this season in comparison to recent years, 
due to restricted access through crossing points and shipping 
procedures that reportedly resulted in damaged products and 
reduced values in European markets.  Export earnings for 
strawberries were USD 224,000 this season, in comparison to 
USD 4.2 million last season.  Export earnings for carnations 
have been limited to USD 677,000, in comparison to a total of 
USD 4.1 million last season.  End summary. 
 
Strawberry Exports Limited By Crossing Closures 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Strawberries are considered the largest and most 
profitable export crop in Gaza, yet according to Gaza-based 
contacts and published Palestinian reports, 2007-2008 harvest 
exports totaled just 42 truckloads valued at USD 224,000. 
Due to restrictions at crossing points, strawberries were 
only exported from November 28 - December 18, 2007.  In 
recent years, strawberries had been shipped as late as 
February.  In comparison to this season's revenues of USD 
224,000, the 2006-2007 harvest earned Gaza farmers USD 4.2 
million in export earnings, and 2005-2006 strawberry exports 
earned farmers USD 3.8 million, according to USG contractors 
in the agriculture sector. 
 
Crossing Procedures Reduce Product Value 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) During prior years, Gaza strawberries were shipped 
to Israel through Karni/al-Mintar commercial crossing and on 
sale in European markets within 24 hours.  This quick 
timeline was not possible through Kerem Shalom, the only 
crossing that has been open for limited exports from Gaza 
since June 2007.  At Kerem Shalom, strawberries were removed 
from cold storage and exposed to the elements for periods of 
up to eight hours, according to USG contractors in Gaza, 
resulting in premature spoilage and low prices in European 
markets.  The crossing's inspection procedures reportedly 
caused damage to several shipments.  Contractors also noted 
that the ban on imports of certain fertilizers and specific 
greenhouse equipment into Gaza may have limited the quality 
of strawberries this season. 
 
Carnation Exports Limited 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Carnation flowers are Gaza's second largest 
agriculture export product and yielded USD 677,000 in export 
earnings during the 2007-2008 harvest.  In comparison, 
2006-2007 carnation revenue was roughly USD 2 million by 
mid-February 2007 and totaled USD 4.1 million for the entire 
season, per USG contractors.  This season, carnation exports 
ran only from November 20 to January 15.  Since mid-January, 
Kerem Shalom has been closed for exports. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) There were no exports from Gaza of bell peppers, 
cherry tomatoes, or sweet tomatoes this season (reftel).
