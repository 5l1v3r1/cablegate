¶1. (SBU)  Econoff delivered reftel demarches to Director 
General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) Cesar Posso on July 3. 
Posso indicated that Ecuador supports the U.S. position in 
terms of safety and security, and is improving its record 
with regard to protecting the environment.  In Posso's words, 
he spearheaded Ecuador's return to the ICAO because of the 
need to concentrate on safety and security; he is very 
supportive of the country's participation in international 
aviation fora.  He said that funding was an issue for Ecuador 
in making progress on noise regulations and emissions (though 
he estimated that approximately 95% of Ecuadorian carriers 
are now in compliance with noise norms and roughly 50% had 
made efforts to limit emissions).  Since Ecuador's return to 
FAA Category I, Posso said the DGAC has made safety its 
constant priority.  He said Ecuador wants to establish a 
permanent delegation of three people to the ICAO, starting in 
November 2007.  He hopes to personally attend the ICAO 
Assembly in September.
