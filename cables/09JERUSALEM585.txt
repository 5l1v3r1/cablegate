SUBJECT:  INL Assistant Secretary Johnson's Meetings in the West 
Bank 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  INL Assistant Secretary Johnson's March 15 visit to 
the West Bank gave him an opportunity to underscore U.S. support for 
Palestinian security forces training programs.  He visited 
Palestinian security sector reform projects funded by INL, attended 
the opening of the new Presidential Guard (PG) training facility, 
and met with Minister of Interior Yahya and Strategic Planning 
Department (SPD) Director Jibrini.  End summary. 
 
Underscoring U.S. support for PSF training 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) INL Assistant Secretary Johnson and Consul General Walles 
participated with Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Fayyad 
in the opening of the PG's new Jericho Training Center (JTC).  Other 
prominent guests included Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat, 
the heads of other PA security forces (PASF), and a senior 
delegation from Jordan's Public Security Directorate. 
 
¶3. (U) The JTC, built with INL funds and under INL oversight, is a 
modern facility with a capacity of 700 trainees -- the first to be 
built with U.S. funds that were allocated to support the security 
capability of the PA government.  The PG itself was the first PA 
security force to be trained at the Jordan International Police 
Training Center (JIPTC). 
 
¶4. (U) INL-funded training and equipping of PG and National Security 
Force (NSF) battalions is part of the Palestinian security sector 
reform program, implemented in coordination with the U.S. Security 
Coordinator (USSC), as is the construction of garrison and training 
camps for those forces.  The SPD, intended to build planning and 
coordination capacity for the Ministry of Interior, is also an 
INL/USSC project. 
 
¶5. (U) Johnson also visited two NSF camps in Jericho.  One, an NSF 
operations camp, is currently under construction; the other, an NSF 
training camp, will break ground in April.  These camps, the first 
of several to be built for the NSF, will be completed later in 2009 
and will serve as garrisons for NSF police-support units being 
trained at JIPTC. 
 
Meetings with Yahya and Jibrini 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In Ramallah, Johnson called on Minister of Interior Yahya, 
who expressed his appreciation for assistance the USG is providing 
PASF, and noted their improved performance since 2007.  He explained 
how he is working on a general security reorganization that will 
result in better coordination among the PASF services.  Yayha 
commented specifically on the need to improve the capabilities of 
the Civil Defense, such as fire, rescue, and other first responders, 
to undertake roles such as managing evacuations and manning 
shelters. 
 
¶7. (SBU) In a separate meeting, SPD Director Jibrini highlighted the 
difficulties of tracking foreign assistance to the PASF, and 
explained his plans to set up a project registration process within 
the MOI to overcome this problem. 
 
Media coverage 
-------------- 
 
¶8. (U) The dedication ceremony received extensive and favorable 
coverage in the Palestinian press, including front-page articles and 
photographs of PM Fayyad addressing the assembled PG units and 
guests, and of A/S Johnson and Fayyad cutting the ribbon to formally 
open the camp. 
 
¶9. (U) A/S Johnson has cleared this cable.
