¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  In a reception held in his honor, the new Pakistani 
CG in Toronto praised Toronto's Pakistani community and the 
important role it has played in promoting trade with Canada and 
development in Pakistan.  The Canadian Pakistani Business Council 
(CPBC), the organization that hosted the event, has spent more than 
20 years engaging Canadian politicians and leaders to deepen ties 
with Pakistan.  In the past decade, the Council has led a number of 
trade missions to Pakistan, and in 2007, facilitated the signing of 
a cooperation agreement between the province of Ontario and the 
Pakistani province of Punjab.  The CPBC has contributed to the 
Pakistani diaspora's success and influence in Canada.  END SUMMARY.

Praise for the Pakistani-Canadian Community

¶2. (U) On September 24, the Canadian Pakistani Business Council 
(CPBC) held a welcome reception for the new Pakistani Consul 
General, Sahebzada A. Khan, who had arrived in Toronto in August. 
The CPBC reception provided an opportunity for Mr. Khan to meet with 
local business leaders and politicians, including Liberal Canadian 
MP Jim Karygiannis, who was among the evening's special guests.  In 
his remarks to the audience, Mr. Khan noted the Pakistani-Canadian 
community's influence and praised CPBC for the important role it has 
played in promoting trade and economic growth in Pakistan through 
events such as the one that evening.

An Influential Pakistani-Canadian Organization 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Canadian Pakistani Business Council (CPBC) serves as a 
de-facto chamber of commerce promoting trade between Canada and 
Pakistan.  The CBPC was founded in Montreal in 1983 by Pakistani 
immigrants, and in 1996 it moved its headquarters to Toronto, which 
is home to 75 per cent (76,000) of Canada's total Pakistani 
immigrant population.  Through its many events, the CPBC brings 
together Canadian officials and business leaders with visiting 
Pakistani officials, to promote investment opportunities in 
Pakistan, ranging from oil refineries to five-star hotels.  CPBC has 
relationships with both government entities and business groups, 
including the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Export 
Development Canada, and has signed a MoU with the Canadian 
Manufacturers and Exporters to promote bilateral trade between 
Canada and Pakistan. 
 
¶4. (U) In the past decade, the CPBC has organized a number of trade 
missions to Pakistan.  Most recently, in 2007, Ontario Premier 
Dalton McGuinty, accompanied by Ontario's first Pakistani-Canadian 
Member of Provincial Parliament, Dr. Shafiq Qaadri, traveled to 
Pakistan and signed a joint statement with Punjab province.  The 
statement declared the two provinces' intention to "enhance, 
exchange and expand cooperation." 
 
¶5. (U) Despite these efforts, trade between Pakistan and Canada 
remains quite small.  In 2008, Pakistani imports and exports as a 
percentage of the Canadian total equaled 0.06% and .12%, 
respectively.  Traditionally, the largest export industries from 
Pakistan have been textiles and clothing.  However, in his remarks 
Pakistani CG Khan spoke of his government's goal of dramatically 
increasing trade between Canada and Pakistan.  He asked for CPBC's 
help to steer investment towards new areas, including technology and 
infrastructure. 
 
¶6. (U) Comment:  The CPBC has been actively building partnerships 
and relationships with both Canadian and Pakistani politicians over 
the years to create opportunities for Pakistani-Canadian businesses, 
while also focusing on its stated goal of improving conditions in 
Pakistan.  The Council is just one of many Canadian-Pakistani 
organizations that has facilitated the diaspora's integration and 
influence in Canada.  A wealth of networks and organizations has 
made Pakistani-Canadians one of the more successful immigrant groups 
in Canada. 
 
¶7. (U) Comment Continued: While the older generation of 
Pakistani-Canadians has felt an impetus to employ their connections 
for the benefit of their home country, the next generation of 
Pakistani-Canadians (born in Canada) may not feel as strong a fealty 
to their ancestral home.  Younger Pakistani-Canadians do feel 
cultural ties to Pakistan however; they have an equally strong 
cultural connection to Canada, and their day to day concerns and
