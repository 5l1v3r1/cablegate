Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Post supports continued waiver of Title III provisions 
of the Libertad Act for Mexico.  The Mexican International 
Development Bank has begun the process of recovering debt 
from Cuba.  There are small exchange programs between the two 
countries. Mexico continues to promote respect for human 
rights in Cuba and in the region as President Calderon seeks 
to strengthen his government's relationship with Cuba.  End 
Summary 
 
Mexican Investment in Cuba 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mexican investment in Cuba is principally geared 
towards the agricultural and food sectors, the tourism 
sector, and the construction sector. The Havana branch of the 
Mexican International Development Bank, BANCOMEXT, has been 
closed since 2005.  The Bank of Cuba and other entities still 
have approximately 325 million USD in outstanding Mexican 
debt.  In 2006, BANCOMEXT won a settlement of 35 million USD 
from the Bank of Cuba in Italian Court. BANCOMEXT has 
expressed an interest in using European courts to settle the 
debt. 
 
Bilateral Trade Agreements 
-------------------------- 
 
3.(U) In July 2002 Mexico and Cuba entered into a 
Complementary Economic Agreement (ACE-51).  ACE's are similar 
to Free Trade Agreements, but only include some sectors.  In 
2001, Mexico and Cuba signed an Investment Promotion and 
Protection Agreement (APRI).  Both Mexico and Cuba are also 
members of the Latin American Integration Association 
(ALADI).  No new agreements have been signed in recent years. 
 
Exchange Programs Between Mexico and Cuba 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Ricardo Dominguez, the Secretariat of 
Foreign Relations (SRE) Director for Cuban, Haitian and 
Dominican affairs, the governments of Mexico and Cuba have 
several student exchange programs at the post-graduate level. 
 Medical travel to Cuba is usually paid for by individual 
travelers.  From time to time, groups of Cuban teachers work 
on literacy programs in marginalized areas of Mexico. 
 
Promoting Democracy and Human Rights in Cuba 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) GOM officials continue to insist that Mexico prefers 
to use multilateral fora to discuss human rights issues with 
Cuba (or other countries), rather than engage the GOC 
one-on-one.  The Mexican Embassy in Cuba eschews engaging 
with Cuban dissidents or human rights which it believes could 
be construed as interference in Cuba's internal affairs. 
Nevertheless, we do not expect Calderon's administration to 
overlook the issue of human rights on the island.  Shortly 
before assuming office, Foreign Secretary Espinosa 
acknowledged that Cuba suffered from "a difficult human 
rights situation, that there are problems that should be 
addressed, which explains why this subject is brought before 
international fora." 
 
Diplomatic Visits 
----------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Since the August 10, 2005, appointment of Jose 
Ignacio Pina Rojas as Mexico's Ambassador to Cuba, Mexico has 
had an Ambassador resident in Havana.  There have been no 
ministerial level visits to Cuba in the past six months. 
According to Ricardo Dominguez, the Secretariat of Foreign 
Relations (SRE) Director for Cuban, Haitian and 
Dominican affairs, and SRE Under-Secretary for Environmental 
Affairs traveled to Cuba for meetings in January. 
 
¶7. (SBU) President Felipe Calderon has said that he will seek 
a more constructive and less confrontational relationship 
with Cuba than prevailed under the Fox administration a 
sentiment echoed by Foreign Secretary Espinosa in recent 
months.
