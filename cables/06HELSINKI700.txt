¶1. (U) SUMMARY: During the July EU Informal 
Ministerial meeting on the Environment, Finnish 
Minister Enestam and EU Commissioner Dimas called 
upon EU countries to support a measure creating a 
United Nations Environmental Organization (UNEO) and 
a Panel on Natural Resources.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) At the EU Informal Environmental Ministerial 
hosted in Turku, Finland July 14-16, Finnish 
Environmental Minister Jan-Erik Enestam and EU 
Commissioner for the Environment Stavros Dimas 
called for the establishment of a United Nations 
Environmental Organization (UNEO) and a Panel on 
Natural Resources to operate similar to the UN 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Enestam 
alluded to a "One Planet Environmental Policy," 
saying, "We will also need new strong global 
players, such as a United Nations Environmental 
Organization and a Panel on Natural Resources. These 
international bodies would be instrumental in 
establishing common rules for all players." 
 
¶3. (U) A Finnish-produced background paper for the 
Informal Ministerial meeting contained a call for EU 
countries to lobby for a permanent international 
environmental organization.  EU countries believe 
UNEO would represent a "significant shift in 
international environmental policies" by "giving 
more political weight to international environmental 
action."  Support of UNEO was again reiterated on 
July 18 in a Finnish EU press release that called 
for "new forums" to "enable countries to work 
together to find ways to resolve critical global 
environmental problems."  Creation of UNEO was 
listed as an important objective in this process. 
 
¶4. (U) While the final "Presidency Conclusions" 
document fell short of again naming UNEO, it did 
say, "The EU should actively lobby for the creation 
of a international environmental organization to 
strengthen international environmental governance 
and enhance cooperation between international 
environmental agreements." 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to sources in the Finnish 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, support for UNEO has 
been a GOF position for some time; however, the GOF 
has recently been more vocal about this stance due 
to its EU Presidency rotation.  From published 
sources we know that the Finns discussed supporting 
UNEO as early as June of 2005 when Enestam met in 
Japan with the Japanese Environment Minister.

¶6. (SBU) EU countries see the establishment of a 
central governing body on the environment as a step 
toward getting all players to "act by the same 
rules."  The fact that the name "UNEO" is missing 
from the final Presidency Conclusion may signal that 
there is not unanimous support within the EU for 
UNEO; however, the call for UNEO was clearly held by 
the majority of EU Environmental Ministers.
