REGIME ADMINISTERED BY THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT.  THESE

IN THESE MARKET SEGMENTS IS NOT MARKET ACCESS, BUT 
INADEQUATE CONTRACT STABILITY, DELAYS IN OBTAINING

BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL     4        HIGH 
 SERVICES INCLUDING SECURITIES 
 
Comment: Brazil's Central Bank regulates banking and 
financial services, and maintains strict accounting and 
operational supervision.  Private pension funds are among 
the fastest growing sectors of the Brazilian economy, and 
consists of open funds (including those similar to U.S. 
401(k) plans) and closed funds. 
 
INSURANCE SERVICES              4        HIGH 
Comment: U.S companies wishing to enter into the 
Brazilian insurance market are advised to do so through a 
joint venture, acquisition or partnership with a local 
company, or to open a subsidiary.  Under current 
legislation, insurance companies must be organized as 
corporations (Sociedade Anonima, or S/A), and submit to 
local regulatory authorities an application to operate as 
an insurance company. The insurance company may not 
engage in activities other than insurance. These same 
rules apply to reinsurance companies, though their scope 
for action is limited by the existence of a government 
monopoly reinsurer, the Brazilian Reinsurance Institute 
(IRB).  Foreign firms currently are barred from offering 
reinsurance on their own account, but may conduct 
business with the IRB. Foreign insurance companies may 
establish a representative office in Brazil, but are not 
allowed to engage in certain insurance activities, such 
as issuing policies.  Current legislation allows foreign 
insurance companies to hold the entire equity 
participation or voting stock of a Brazilian insurance 
company.
