¶1.  Action Request - paragraph 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ANATEL regulator Itamar Barreto Paes contacted post on 
April 7 with a read-out on ANATEL actions to stop the pirating of 
DOD satellite signals, per Reftel A.  First, Brazilian authorities 
monitored the specific frequency at issue according to the 
information provided by reftel B, concentrating on the individual 
identified as the main culprit. They confirmed illegal use of the 
spectrum and on March 17 shut down the individual's operation. 
ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests that the Department confirm with DOD 
whether the Brazil-origin interference has indeed halted. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Turning their attention to the other frequencies identified 
in Reftel B, Brazilian authorities determined that the pirates were 
truckers and farmers. Highway police in 27 states apprehended the 
culprits at their farms and on the highways and confiscated the 
unauthorized equipment. After the two-day operation, illegal 
transmissions on the identified frequencies stopped, according to 
ANATEL's monitoring. 
 
¶4. (U) Paes identified ANATEL's next steps as continuing to monitor 
the DOD-identified frequencies and respond to any further 
unauthorized activity. ANATEL will soon send Embassy a full report 
of its operations on the two interdictions, with names, locations, 
and details, which post will forward to Washington. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Paes again asked about the availability of the technology 
used to pinpoint the pirate in Santos. ANATEL desires any 
information that may be passed and promised to respond to any other 
incidences of pirating of US DOD satellites.
