SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage May 15 on the continuing rescue effort for the Sichuan 
earthquake and the humanitarian aid that Taiwan is providing to 
China.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" urged that Taiwan 
embrace new thinking in its Asia strategy while the United States' 
hegemony in Asia is declining and relations among Asian countries is 
taking a new shape.  End summary. 
 
"Taiwan Must Find Way in New Asia" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" [circulation: 
20,000] editorialized (5/15): 
 
"... The litmus test for the direction that the PRC will take may 
well be its behavior in East and Northeast Asia and, especially, in 
the Taiwan Strait. 
 
"Given its weak formal diplomatic position and economic reliance on 
China and Japan, Taiwan will face severe challenges in this new 
environment and Taiwan policy makers will have to carefully consider 
Taiwan's future alternative paths and the possible roles in a 
radically new multipolar East Asia. 
 
"Taiwan has long been preoccupied with its domestic political strife 
and the tense relations with the PRC and therefore rarely takes 
serious note of international affairs. 
 
"Taiwan can no longer afford such narcissism. 
 
"In the short term, the new Kuomintang government should take 
advantage of the current climate of regional detente to link the 
security of the Taiwan Strait with the question of guarantees for 
overall East Asian security and call on the PRC to abandon any use 
or the threat of force against Taiwan. 
 
"In the longer term, in East Asia's new multipolar world, Taiwan can 
no longer depend solely on the US for its security and must develop 
its own capabilities, strategies and voice on regional issues such 
as west Pacific security, economic development, climatic change and 
democratic development and human rights to build its own influence 
and provide a foundation for values-based strategic alliances."
