SUBJECT: BRV SUBMITS 2009 BUDGET, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH 
 
REF: 2007 CARACAS 2040 
 
¶1.  (U) Press reports indicate that the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela (BRV) has submitted the 2009 budget to the 
National Assembly (AN), though it has not yet been formally 
presented by the Minister of Finance as is the custom. 
According to these reports, which cite AN deputy and 
president of the Finance Commission Ricardo Sanguino, 
projected central government spending for 2009 is 169 billion 
bolivars (Bs), or USD 78 billion at the official exchange 
rate.  This amount represents an increase of 23 percent over 
the initial 2008 budget.  Per the press reports, key 
assumptions for 2009 include an average price of USD 60 per 
barrel for Venezuelan oil exports, annual inflation of 15 
percent, a real growth rate of 6 percent, and an exchange 
rate of 2.15 Bs/USD, the same as it has been since 2005.

¶2.  (SBU) BRV budgets are not reliable guides to spending or 
to the indicators mentioned above.  Central government 
spending is generally increased significantly throughout the 
course of the year through additional credits approved by the 
National Assembly.  To date in 2008, these credits total Bs 
38 billion, adding 27 percent to the initial 2008 budget. 
More importantly, a significant part of fiscal spending - 
perhaps on the order of 30 percent - takes place off-budget, 
through an array of discretionary funds.  The inflation 
estimate is laughably low, as it was in the 2008 budget 
(where it was estimated at 11 percent (reftel), but will 
likely end the year at 30 percent). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The most surprising feature of the 2009 budget, 
given what has been leaked to the press to date, is the 
estimated oil price of USD 60 per barrel.  The BRV regularly 
lowballs the estimated oil price, partly to be conservative, 
partly to compensate for inflated export numbers, and partly 
to increase discretion in its use of oil revenue (septel). 
Given the recent decline in oil prices, USD 60 per barrel 
seems far more realistic than the estimate of USD 35 per 
barrel in the 2008 budget seemed at the time.  A likely 
explanation is that the BRV had been expecting oil prices to 
remain above USD 100 per barrel and was taken by surprise by 
the rapid drop in the past several weeks.  End comment.
