¶1. (U) In response to referenced Leahy vetting requests, the 
Department has reviewed its files and finds it possesses no 
credible information of gross violations of human rights at

Forces and Lebanese Armed Forces personnel listed below.  If 
at any time the Embassy becomes aware of any information 
regarding incidents which could be deemed to be credible 
information of a gross violation of human rights by these 
individuals, the Embassy should so inform the Department.
