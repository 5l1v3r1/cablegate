SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE - JANUARY 10 
 
REFTEL: Jerusalem 101 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  All Gaza crossings were closed on January 10. 
UNRWA restarted coordination with the IDF following a meeting with 
GOI officials on January 9, and requested permission for trucks to 
enter Gaza on January 11.  UNRWA shelters now hold more than 21,000 
displaced people.  Health, water, and sanitation systems remain 
under stress, but there have been improvements to the electricity 
grid that contacts hope will allow the power plant to resume 
operations.  End Summary. 
 
Crossings Update 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) January 10:  All crossings to Gaza are closed due to 
Shabbat. 
 
¶3. (SBU) January 9: No aid shipments entered Gaza after the UN 
suspended movements.  According to UN contacts, 41 private-sector 
truckloads entered via Kerem Shalom.  A total of 14 truckloads of 
medical supplies, 11 Arab medics, and three ambulances entered 
through Rafah crossing. 
 
UN to Resume Operations 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following a meeting with GOI officials on January 9, UNRWA 
renewed coordination with the IDF on January 10 and planned to 
resupply its seven food distribution sites.  UNRWA also delivered 
food and water to its 27 shelters.  As of 1700 local on January 10, 
ICRC had not yet indicated when it will restart movements in Gaza. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) UNRWA contacts report GOI approval to bring in 40-45 trucks 
on January 11.  Approximately five of these truckloads will consist 
of USAID assistance, including medical supplies, blankets, 
mattresses, food items, and plastic sheeting. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The IDF announced a fourth "humanitarian pause" on January 
10 between 1300 and 1600 local.  Media sources in Gaza reported 
military operations in the Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya neighborhoods 
north of Gaza City during the time period. 
 
Food/Shelter 
------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) OCHA contacts report that approximately 90 percent of 
Gaza's population now depends on food assistance.  The WFP 
distributed 44 metric tons of food to 770 families in Khan Yunis on 
January 9.  No distribution took place in Gaza City.  WFP reported 
plans to resume distribution in Gaza City on January 10.  USAID Gaza 
staff reported that markets are "empty of people and goods." 
 
¶8. (SBU) UNRWA contacts reported on January 10 that UNRWA is 
operating 27 emergency shelters with 21,555 displaced people. 
 
Water and Sanitation 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) UNICEF reported that, as of January 9, 80 percent of 
drinking water in Gaza is not safe for human consumption, according 
to WHO guidelines.  OCHA contacts reported that sewage continues to 
overflow in many parts of northern Gaza, particularly in Beit Hanoun 
and Beit Lahiya, affecting almost 92,000 people in these areas 
alone.  OCHA is particularly concerned about solid waste piling up 
at hospitals. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) contacts in Gaza 
reported on January 10 that the offices of PWA's contractor for the 
World Bank-funded North Gaza Emergency Sewage Project had been hit 
by the IDF. 
 
Power/Telecom 
------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) According to OCHA contacts, the Gaza Electricity 
Distribution Company (GEDCO) reported two Israeli feeder lines each 
with a 26 MW capacity were re-connected on January 9.  Two feeder 
lines still remain down, and internal network damage left 75 percent 
of Gaza City without power.  GEDCO also reported that it received 
some spare parts (including 19 transformers) on January 9 and 
expected Gaza's power supply to improve in coming days, provided 
repair teams have access to repair the internal network and no 
further damage occurs. 
 
 
JERUSALEM 00000102  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶12. (SBU) Gaza power plant staff reported to EconOff that they are 
attempting to bring one of the plant's turbines back online.  There 
were media reports on January 10 that a transformer in Rafah had 
been struck by IDF fire. 
 
¶13. (SBU) Approximately 80-90 percent of the mobile service network 
remains down, according to OCHA estimates.  OCHA contacts noted that 
a single remaining fiber optic cable connects Gaza to Israel. 
Damage to the cable would sever connections with the outside world 
and most internal telecommunication services. 
 
Health 
------ 
 
¶14. (SBU) WHO and medical contacts are concerned about the toll of 
the conflict on those suffering with chronic illnesses, which they 
assess are likely to result in more health issues in the long term. 
WHO contacts report that about 70 percent of chronic patients 
regularly attending primary health care centers have had to 
interrupt their treatment since hostilities began on December 27. 
 
Cash 
---- 
 
¶15. (SBU) UNRWA contacts reported on January 10 that UNRWA is 
arranging the delivery of cash, as approved by the GOI, with the 
Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA).  UNRWA plans to transport the 
cash in armored vehicles via Erez crossing as early as January 11. 
PMA Governor Jihad al-Wazir reports that he does not have 
confirmation from the GOI of the total amount of cash approved for 
transport into Gaza, but he confirmed that Brinks has contacted 
Palestinian banks to arrange the transfer. 
 
AMCIT Evacuations 
----------------- 
 
¶16. (SBU) According to USAID officers, the GOI may approve AMCIT 
evacuation requests by Tuesday, January 13.  ICRC has reported that 
it may try to move evacuees on January 14, but is unable to do so 
earlier.  The Consulate and Embassy have agreed to an ICRC request 
to coordinate this evacuation of third-country nationals. (Canada 
coordinated the previous one.)
