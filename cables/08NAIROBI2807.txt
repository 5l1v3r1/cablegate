SUBJECT: SOMALIA - PRESIDENT CONTINUES EFFORTS TO OUST PRIME 
MINISTER 
 
REF: A) Nairobi 2652   B) Nairobi 2681 
 
¶1.  (U) Continuing his effort to oust Prime Minister Nur Hassan 
Hussein "Nur Adde," on December 16 President Abdullahi Yusuf 
nominated Mohammed Mahmud Guled "Gamadheere" prime minister.  On 
December 15 Yusuf tried to sack the prime minister, but was rebuffed 
by the parliament in the form of a strong vote of confidence in Nur 
Adde and passage of his cabinet slate (reftel A).  Nur Adde has 
since sworn in his ministers and is pushing parliament to debate the 
Joint Security Council's November 25 unity government proposal 
(reftel B). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Citing Yusuf's continued challenge to Nur Adde, Kenya's 
Foreign Minister Wetangula threatened Yusuf with a travel ban and 
asset freeze, in keeping with a warning to Somali peace process 
spoilers in article 11 of the November 18 Intergovernmental 
Authority on Development (IGAD) declaration.  Somalia watchers at 
the French Embassy in Nairobi told us they have recommended their 
delegation to the December 16 New York International Contact Group 
meeting push for communique language critical of President Yusuf. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In a phone call with Special Envoy John Yates, the Speaker 
of Parliament Sheikh Aden Mohammed Nur said Yusuf's actions were 
contrary to the Transitional Federal Charter.  Parliamentarians and 
others with whom we spoke expressed disdain for Yusuf's latest 
gambit.  "It's the last kick of a dying horse," one told us.  There 
was a consensus even among Yusuf supporters that he had badly 
misjudged how parliament would react.  A former minister thought 
Yusuf's age, coupled with bad advice from his closest advisors had 
gotten the better of him. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Yusuf's PM nominee Gamadheere is his long time ally. 
Gamadheere received mixed reviews from Somalis with whom we've 
consulted.  Some praised him as a patriotic stalwart who never 
emigrated from Somalia like so many others over the last 18 years. 
Others discounted his abilities.  Regardless of his qualifications, 
it seems unlikely Gamadheere will rise to the prime ministership. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  Yusuf surprised us by following up his December 
15 attempted sacking with such an antagonistic and seemingly 
ineffectual effort the very next day.  He may be surprised himself 
that at least one IGAD state, Kenya, is considering sanctions - 
others may follow if he continues down this path. End Comment.
