"Obama risks increasing troops in Afghanistan" 
 
The pro-PRC Chinese-language Macau Daily News remarked in an 
editorial (2/24):  "U.S. President Obama made a major military 
decision on February 17 by approving an increase of 17,000 U.S. 
troops in Afghanistan, increasing the overall troops in Afghanistan 
almost by half.  But the number is 40 percent less than the military 
requested.  Obama believes that it is a necessary measure to 
stabilize the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.  Obama has not 
yet fulfilled his campaign promise on withdrawing troops in Iraq; 
and now, he increases troops in Afghanistan.  This may bring him 
some political risks.  Many experts think that Afghanistan is a 
bigger challenge to the U.S. than Iraq....  During the presidential 
campaign, Obama strongly criticized the ruling Republican Party in 
its handling of the war in Iraq.  Now, he is facing the more thorny 
war in Afghanistan.  Analysts believe that Obama should remember the 
lesson learnt from the Vietnam War and avoid falling into the 
quagmire with the war in Afghanistan.  Newsweek recently wrote in 
its cover story: Afghanistan is becoming Obama's 'Vietnam' and 
American people will finally be forsaken.  Since Obama is eager to 
show his tough side, he pledges to 'win' the war in Afghanistan. 
His case is very similar to President Kennedy and President Johnson 
during the Vietnam War.  In the eyes of Newsweek, they may share the 
same 'unfortunate' experiences."
