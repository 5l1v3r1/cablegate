¶1. This is an action message.  See para 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the margins of another meeting, Foreign Affairs' 
newly installed Deputy Director for Regional Security (IDR), 
Christine Cadieux, inquired whether USG planned to support 
the 2006 Middle East Maritime Safety Colloquium (MARSAF).  A 
confidence- and security-building effort, MARSAF's primary 
function is to engage nations in the Middle East in 
discussions related to search and rescue operations and other 
maritime safety issues. Canada is a founding participant of 
the colloquium and continues to be active in convening the 
meetings, which have occurred almost annually (except for 
2000, 2003 and 2005) since MARSAF's 1997 inception. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cadieux said that plans were afoot within the 
Canadian bureaucracy to approach the Jordanian government 
about hosting the next MARSAF in Amman, in October 2006. 
Alluding to USG's generous (USD 50,000) support for the 2004 
colloquium, Cadieux said the GOC hoped that State Department 
funding would again be available for the 2006 meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST.  Post requests Department's guidance 
for responding to Cadieux's query.  END ACTION.
