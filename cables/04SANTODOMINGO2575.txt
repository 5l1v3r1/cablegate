WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM IRAQ 
 
Â¶1. On April 27 Embassy received from the Foreign Ministry 
formal notification of withdrawal from Iraq by the Dominican 
Quisqueya Batallion, dated April 26. 
 
Text follows: (Complementary intro...) and refers to the 
situation of the Ad Hoc "Quisqueya" Task Force, currently in 
Iraq. 
 
As it is known by that honorable diplomatic mission, the 
government of the Dominican Republic, as proof of its 
unwavering commitment in the fight against terrorism, and in 
connection with the operation led by the United States of 
America to free and create the proper conditions for the 
stability and development of the people of Iraq, joined 
"Operation Iraqi Freedom," sending armed forces consisting of 
302 infantry soldiers, as a significant support from our 
armed forces for the coalition. 
 
On April 19, 2004, the Spanish government, fulfilling the 
commitment made by their current President, announced the 
withdrawal of its troops from "Operation Iraqi Freedom," 
immediately suspending all operations by Spanish personnel, 
leaving the Dominican troops without the necessary support to 
perform their regular operations. This made it impossible for 
our troops to carry out their assigned responsibilities. 
 
For these reasons, his Excellency, the President of the 
Republic, has informed the Secretary of the Armed Forces of 
the decision to remove the Dominican troops from Iraq as soon 
as possible, given that the conditions are not adequate to 
assure that the troops are not exposed to life-threatening 
danger. 
 
The Department of Foreign Relations gives notice to the 
government of the United States of the decision taken, at the 
same time that it reiterates that the Dominican Republic will 
continue supporting and cooperating with the United States of 
America in the fight against terrorism, and in steps taken in 
favor of the reconstruction of Iraq and world peace.
