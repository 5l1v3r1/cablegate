SUBJECT: CZECHS WILL SUPPORT U.S. POSITION ON RED CRYSTAL 
AT JUNE CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 95184 
 
¶1. (U) Poloff discussed reftel on June 15 with Petr Valek, 
Legal Officer in the Czech MFA International Law Department. 
Valek said the Czechs fully support the U.S. as articulated 
in the talking points, including the need to amend the 
statute now to permit national societies to use the Red 
Crystal, and the view that the June 20-21 International 
Conference on the Red Cross and Red Crescent is not the 
proper forum for discussing political issues. Valek said the 
Czechs are willing to make a positive statement at the 
Conference that includes the following points: (1) the 
essentially humanitarian nature of the issue, (2) the need 
for the Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement to become 
more universal, and (3) the need to address political issues 
in other fora. 
 
¶2. (U) Jan Cizek, Director of the International Law 
Department, will lead the Czech delegation to the Conference. 
Representatives of the Czech Red Cross will also attend.
