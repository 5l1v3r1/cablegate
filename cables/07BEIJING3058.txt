SUBJECT: New Ministers of Water and Land Resources Named 
 
 
¶1. (U) China announced the selection of Xu Shaoshi as the new 
Minister of Land and Resources and Chen Lei as Minister of Water 
Resources following confirmation by the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress April 27. Minister Xu was previously 
Deputy Secretary General of the State Council, where he was a 
coordinator of the Strategic Economic Dialogue team on the Chinese 
side.  He graduated from the Environment and Resources Department of 
Jilin University. 
 
¶2. (U) Minister Chen returns to Beijing following two years as 
Executive Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the 
kind of brief provincial posting that would indicate that Chen was 
being groomed for future promotion.  He is a hydraulic engineer with 
over 20 years of government experience, including ten at the 
Ministry of Water Resources.  Minister Chen was previously Vice 
Minister of Water Resources from 2001 to 2005. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Our contacts at MWR as well as on the NGO side said they do 
not believe Minister Chen, who has worked his way up MWR's ladder, 
will take a different track with the United States than that taken 
by his predecessor, former Minister Wang Shucheng, who had good 
relations with his U.S. government counterparts at the Environmental 
Protection Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We have little direct experience with Minister Xu; as SED 
coordinator, he primarily worked behind the scenes.
