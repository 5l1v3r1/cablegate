¶5.  Security Assessment:  The Department of State is deeply 
concerned about the continued threat of terrorist attacks 
against U.S. citizens and interests abroad, as well as the 
potential for demonstrations and violent actions against U.S. 
citizens and interests overseas.  U.S. citizens are reminded 
that demonstrations and rioting can occur at any time.  U.S. 
citizens are reminded to maintain a high level of vigilance 
and to take appropriate steps to increase their security 
awareness. The Department of State remains concerned by 
indications that al-Qaida and affiliated groups continue to 
prepare to strike U.S. interests abroad.  Terrorist actions 
may include, but are not limited to, suicide operations, 
assassinations, hijackings, bombings or kidnappings. These 
may involve aviation and other transportation and maritime 
interests.  Terrorists do not distinguish between official 
and civilian targets.  These may include facilities where 
U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate or visit, 
including residential areas, business offices, clubs, 
restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels and public 
areas.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to maintain a high level 
of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their 
security awareness.  U.S. Government facilities worldwide 
remain at a heightened state of alert. These facilities may 
temporarily close or suspend public services from time to 
time to assess their security posture. In those instances, 
the American Institute in Taiwan will make every effort to 
provide emergency services to U.S. citizens.  Americans 
abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain 
contact with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate, or the 
American Institute in Taiwan.  As the Department continues to 
develop information on any potential security threats to U.S. 
citizens overseas, it shares credible threat information 
through its consular information program documents, available 
on the Internet at http://travel.state.gov/.  In addition to 
information on the Internet, travelers may obtain up-to-date 
information on security conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 
toll-free in the U.S.  or outside the U.S. and Canada on a 
regular toll line at 1-317-472-2328. 
 
¶6.  Restrictions:  AIT strictly controls the entry of laptop 
computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and any other 
electronic devices into the main office building.  Travelers

Office must provide the following information to the Control 
Officer:
