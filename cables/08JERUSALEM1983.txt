"AN OUTDATED PARADIGM" 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Hayat Al Jadida leads and other front pages report that Secretary 
of State Rice will visit the region the first week of November to, 
"follow up on efforts to reach a framework agreement for peace 
between Israel and the Palestinians."  All front pages report that 
the Middle East Quartet will meet in Cairo on November 9 to discuss 
the peace process.  In other U.S.-related news, Al Quds' front page 
reports on "overwhelming international condemnation" of the recent 
U.S. strike on Syria and anti-American protest rallies in Damascus. 
 
 
Al Quds leads with upbeat coverage about an atmosphere of optimism 
surrounding expectations for upcoming Palestinian talks in Cairo. 
Al-Ayyam's front page reports that Cairo continues to refuse changes 
to its proposal for Palestinian national unity, while Hamas 
expresses a desire to discuss the proposal further.  All papers 
report that heads of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Palestinian Authority 
(PA) President Abbas are planning to attend the opening session, 
noting that Abbas will participate in his capacity as PLO Chairman, 
not Fatah party leader.  In linked reporting, Al Quds and Al Hayat 
Al Jadida publish a front page photo showing Fatah activists being 
released from a Hamas detention facility in Gaza on October 30, as a 
goodwill gesture ahead of the Cairo talks. 
 
Al Quds' front page reports that the PLO Executive Committee has 
almost finished drafting the election law for the Palestinian 
National Council.  Al Quds also runs an interview with Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine party chief Hawatmih. 
Hawatmih comments that discussion on, "the length of the term of the 
office of Palestinian Authority President should remain clear of any 
political maneuvers." 
 
In Gaza news, the front pages report that Israel closed Gaza 
commercial crossings, following "alleged reports" of a rocket attack 
from Gaza on the Israeli town of Sderot.  In separate reporting, all 
front pages note that Egyptian President Mubarak threatened to halt 
all efforts concerning a prisoners exchange deal between Israel and 
Hamas, citing the absence of an Israeli decision-maker at this time. 
 Finally, Al Ayyam front pages comments by UNRWA Commissioner 
General Karen Abu Zayid warning against the negative effects of any 
cut in assistance to UNRWA, adding that 90% of small businesses in 
Gaza went out of business last year, and unemployment has surged to 
45-50%. 
 
Al Quds front-pages a report that Israeli military arrested 15 
students from the Palestine Technical College near Hebron and 
demolished housing barracks belonging to 250 Bedouin families near 
Ramallah on October 30. 
 
On inside page, Al Quds reports on "rising Muslim and Palestinian 
anger" over the "Tolerance Museum" project, to be built on an 
Islamic graveyard in Jerusalem.  The article states that the 
"American-Israeli" projects will cost $200 million and is 
coordinated and overseen by the Governor of California.  Sheikh Rayd 
Salah, Head of the Islamic Movement in Israel, is quoted blasting 
the Israeli Court's decision to allow the "destruction of Muslim 
tombs in order to build a museum." 
 
Al Quds' front page highlights an increase in Israeli settler 
attacks on Palestinian farmers near Bethlehem.  The report quotes 
Israeli Defense Forces legal advisor stating that the Israeli police 
force, not the Israeli military, should confront Israeli settlers.

Al Quds and Al Ayyam cite an AFP wire story on their front pages 
when reporting that Barak Obama is leading in the polls.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1)  Jawad Bashiti editorializes in Al Ayyam under the title "What is 
behind Abu Kamal" (10/31):  "Even a child has the political 
awareness to understand that the strike [on Syria] was the worst 
possible service the [Bush] administration could have performed for 
the Al Maliki Government in its efforts to pass the security 
agreement in parliament.  If the U.S. shows no hesitation in 
attacking Iraq's neighbors before the agreement is signed, how will 
it behave after signing it?... I believe that the U.S. wanted to 
deter Syria from contributing to Russia's growing military might." 
 
2)  Al Quds editorial "Dialogue and ending the siege" (10/31):  "The 
suffocating siege on the Gaza Strip should compel Palestinian 
factions to work seriously towards ending the suffering of the one 
and a half million Palestinians living in a big prison [Gaza]... 
People are hoping that the Palestinian Authority and Arabs, 
particularly Egypt, will open the crossing points ... since those 
under siege are not all Hamas members, but also citizens." 
 
3) Regular contributor Mohamad Yaghi opines in Al Ayyam under the 
title, "A bilateral end to the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations" 
(10/31):  "[Israel's President] Peres says let's negotiate with all 
Arabs.  [the statement is] an acknowledgment that bilateral 
negotiations with [the Palestinian Authority] belong to an outdated 
paradigm... the Palestinian Authority President's meetings with 
[Israeli Premier] Olmert mean nothing to Israel except proving to 
the U.S. that the peace process still exists."
