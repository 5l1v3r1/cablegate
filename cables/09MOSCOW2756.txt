¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-user, NII PM (The Research Institute of 
Applied Mechanics named after Academician V.I.Kuznetsov), Moscow, 
Russia.  The organization is listed on BIS license application 
D421802 as the ultimate consignee of forty (40) IRHF7130SCS 
radiation hardened MOSFETs model no: JANSR2N7261. These items are 
controlled for national security and anti-terrorism reasons under 
ECCN 9A004.  The licensee is International Rectifier Corp., 233 
Kansas Street, El Segundo, CA 90245.

of gyroscopic device development and inertial systems for space 
rockets.  In 2005, the institute became an affiliate of Federal 
State Unitary Enterprise QCentre for Ground-Based Space 
InfrastructureQ (TsENKI). TsENKI was established to improve and 
develop the ground-based space infrastructure of the Russian 
Federation. The institute is currently working to further develop 
and restore GLONASS, RussiaQs alternative to the U.S. Global 
Positioning System.  They plan to utilize the Rad-Hard MOSFETs in 
the satellites that will be launched for GLONASS use.  The 
representatives with whom the export control team met stated they 
understood their obligations under the U.S. export control 
regulations, including the fact that they may not re-export U.S. 
origin items.
