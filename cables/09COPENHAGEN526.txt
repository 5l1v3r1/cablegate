¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Israeli Foreign Minister Liberman visited 
Copenhagen November 9-10, but failed to get Denmark's support for 
upgrading Israel's relations with the EU.  Foreign Minister Per Stig 
Moeller and members of the Folketing expressed publicly opposition 
to Lieberman's objective of asking Denmark to support upgrading the 
EU's cooperation with Israel.  At a small dinner attended by 
Ambassador Fulton, Liberman stated "we favor a two-state solution" 
and "as a settler, I am willing to evacuate if we can get a correct 
deal."  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Israeli FM Avigdor Liberman's November 9-10 visit to 
Copenhagen did not produce the support he sought from Denmark for 
upgrading Israel's relations with the EU: 
 
- FM Moeller stated publicly that the situation in the Mideast had 
not "changed in a way that would currently allow for an action plan 
from the EU."  Moeller added that he hoped "circumstances might soon 
change and allow an upgrade in cooperation.  If this doesn't happen 
before the end of 2009, it's my expectation that the EU will move to 
extend the existing action plan." 
 
- The foreign policy spokesman of the largest party in Denmark's 
ruling coalition, Soeren Pind, said "settlements are complicating" 
Israel's negotiations for enhanced relations with the EU.  "In an 
attempt to advance the peace process the U.S. has issued a number of 
demands to Israel in regards to settlements, and here the EU and 
U.S. have common interests.  So it's difficult to meet Israel's 
desire.  And that's coming from a friend of Israel." 
 
- The foreign policy spokesman of Denmark's top opposition party 
SDP, Jeppe Kofod, said his party had "three crystal clear" 
conditions for upgrading Israel-EU cooperation:  "Settlements must 
be stopped.  The blockade of Gaza must be lifted, and accusations of 
Israeli war crimes during the Gaza war, and also crimes committed by 
Hamas (sic), must be investigated and prosecuted." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Danish People's Party, whose support from outside the 
government is indispensable to the ruling coalition, was much more 
positive towards Israel.  Foreign policy spokesman Soeren Espersen 
said "it's simply unacceptable that Denmark doesn't support Israel, 
the only democracy in the Middle East.  I think that the Danish 
Government should take steps within the EU to normalize relations 
with the EU, instead of supporting the other regimes in the Middle 
East."  On settlements, Espersen said "No one knows where the 
borders are.  We'll only know that after a final peace settlement, 
and so Israel's settlements in the so-called Palestinian Territories 
cannot be used to punish Israel." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Israel's Ambassador to Denmark, Arthur Avnon, hosted a 
small dinner party for FM Liberman November 9, to which only two 
foreign diplomats were invited, the Swedish and US Ambassadors to 
Denmark.   Prior to his formal remarks, Ambassador Fulton asked 
Liberman for his thoughts on what would happen if Palestinian 
Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas carried out his threat not to seek 
re-election.  Liberman called Abbas' announcement a tactic:  Abbas 
needed to show he is tougher than Hamas, and he is angling for some 
concession from Israel. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Highlights of Liberman's remarks to the dinner company 
(in good but not excellent English): 
 
- We must begin again the peace process.  Beginning is important. 
It is a process - but it needs to begin. 
 
- "We favor a two state solution."  Liberman said that it is ironic 
that the Jewish state will create a Palestinian state - even though 
no Palestinian state has existed historically.  "As a settler, I am 
willing to evacuate (my settlement) if we can get a correct deal." 
 
- The reason there has been no peace achieved in the Middle East 
since the 2000 Camp David talks is that the conflict is not Israel 
versus Arabs, but militant Muslims versus others.  He pointed to 
Egypt and the Muslim Brotherhood; Lebanon and Hizbullah; Afghanistan 
and the Taliban; Pakistan and also the Taliban; Palestine and Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad.  The Arab countries "are on the fence" watching 
to see who will win - the radical Islamists or the West. 
 
- When we say we must create peace, we mean by peace that it is 
essential to have security, stability and prosperity.  The mid-term 
 
COPENHAGEN 00000526  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
is more important than the final agreement.  "This is an emotional 
conflict - there are so many emotions."  There are many conflicts 
that have not reached a final agreement (he mentioned the UK and 
Argentina over the Falklands; Turkey and Greece over Cyprus), yet 
both sides have learned to live with the situation and to understand 
to use diplomatic discourse and not weapons. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Liberman then called on his Deputy Danny Ayalon, who was 
Israel's Ambassador to the US 2002-2006.  The Deputy FM made the 
following points: 
 
- Prime Minister Netanyahu was in Washington, D.C. meeting with 
President Obama at the same time, calling for him to get the peace 
process restarted.  The US is the only one who can talk to the 
Palestinians. 
 
- US and Europe are indispensable to continuation of the peace 
process. 
 
- Israel has supported the Palestinian Authority.  Europe is the 
largest supporter of PA.  America supports PA.  The Arab countries 
do not.  Saudi Arabia could give billions to PA, but it gives only a 
small amount, and it also gives to Hamas. 
 
- Some ask about Syria.  If there were peace, Syria would lose 
influence.  Syria wants to continue to control Lebanon, which brings 
lots of revenue to Syria. 
 
- Iran is trying to buy time (while it develops nuclear weapons). 
The US has to say "enough is enough" to Iran.
