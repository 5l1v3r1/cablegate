USG ON AVIATION EMISSIONS 
 
REF: A. A. SECSTATE 83246 
     ¶B. B. 06 BERLIN 3519 
 
¶1. Please note action request contained in paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: Bundestag Transportation Committee Chairman 
Klaus Lippold (CDU), in a meeting with emboffs, offered to 
assist us in building a consensus in favor of tackling 
aviation emissions in a manner that would overcome U.S. 
objections and win broad international acceptance.  Lippold 
is specifically looking for input on whether the Emissions 
Trading Scheme (ETS) is a complete non-starter with the USG 
and what alternate solutions the USG would be receptive to at 
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
Conference in September.  Further information beyond that 
outlined in Reftel would help him to press for greater 
flexibility in the European Union position and increase the 
likelihood of a mutually satisfying conclusion at ICAO.  End 
summary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Responding to emboffs' presentation on USG concerns 
that the European Commission's proposal contradicts ICAO's 
decision in 2004 to include such emissions only on the basis 
of mutual consent among states, Lippold stated his preference 
for global consensus on whatever approach the international 
community adopted.  Growing impatience within the EU over the 
lack of progress in ICAO in reducing such emissions, Lippold 
noted, is strengthening the position of those in the EU who 
argue the EU should act on its own to include civil aviation 
in the ETS.  An important ally who helped defeat a proposed 
airfare tax last year, Lippold also expressed concern that 
EU-based airlines would suffer a competitive disadvantage if 
the ETS did not apply to non-EU airlines as well.  He was 
particularly concerned about the ability of non-EU members 
such as Switzerland to attract business away from the EU. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Lippold, who keeps in close contact with his party 
colleagues in the European Parliament Transportation 
Committee, said that he did not expect the Committee to 
approve any initiatives for a resolution before the September 
ICAO Conference.  He and his colleagues were not aware of any 
such plans in other EU parliamentary committees.  He said the 
EU Parliament's Environment Committee will begin looking at 
the proposal on June 25. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Lippold, who first met with EMIN in December 2006 to 
discuss USG concerns (see reftel B), asked if the USG had 
shifted its position at all due to G8 Summit announcements on 
climate change and whether the USG regarded ETS as "the wrong 
instrument" to deal with aviation emissions.  He particularly 
sought to clarify whether the USG would accept any solution 
involving ETS or would reject ETS out of hand as a way to 
deal with greenhouse gas emissions resulting from civil 
aviation.  He also asked if the USG had any alternate 
solution that would achieve comparable reductions in lieu of 
incorporating non-EU airlines in the ETS.  Lippold said a 
timely response to such inquiries, ideally prior to the July 
6 start of the Bundestag July recess, could assist him to 
shape his party's stance ahead of the ICAO Conference. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Action Request: Request guidance for use in 
responding to Lippold's request for further information to 
assist our consensus building efforts and his inquiries 
regarding approaches to emissions reductions that are 
acceptable to the USG.
