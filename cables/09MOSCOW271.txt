¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Russian Federal Veterinary 
and Phytosanitary Surveillance Service (VPSS) 
requested via official letter that the USDA Food 
Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) organize 
another joint audit of U.S. pork, beef, and 
poultry facilities that are eligible to export to 
Russia beginning March 1, 2009.  In addition VPSS 
implies that the current lists of U.S. meat and 
poultry facilities lack credibility as over half of 
them were delisted during the previous audits for 
non-compliance.  As a result, VPSS wants FSIS to 
review and provide new lists of facilities that, 
according to them, are actually capable of 
meeting all Russian veterinary requirements.  The 
original scanned copy of the letter and courtesy 
translation were sent to FAS/FSIS on January 28, 
2009 (REF A).  An informal embassy translation of 
the letter follows. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: 
Moscow, January 28, 2009 
No. FS-NV-2/506 
 
Assistant Administrator 
Office of International Affairs 
USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) 
Dr. Ronald K. Jones 
 
The Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary 
Surveillance Service (VPSS) extends its regards 
to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service 
(FSIS) and informs you of the following. 
 
The results of the 2008 joint audits of U.S. meat 
and poultry processing establishments that export 
to the Russian Federation showed that more than 
50 percent of the establishments visited did not 
comply with Russian veterinary and sanitary 
requirements and norms. 
 
In this connection, VPSS considers it necessary 
for FSIS to carefully review and fix the lists of 
U.S. meat-processing establishments that actually 
meet Russian requirements and send them to our 
address before April 1, 2009. 
 
In addition we also consider it necessary for 
FSIS to organize a joint inspection of U.S. pork, 
beef and poultry meat processing establishments 
that are eligible for export to Russia starting 
March 1, 2009. 
 
Dr. Jones, let me assure you of my highest 
esteem. 
 
Deputy Head 
N.A. Vlasov 
END TEXT. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Over the last 6 months, VPSS 
has really ratcheted up its attacks on U.S. meat 
and poultry exports to Russia highlighting that 
the protectionist elements within the Ministry of 
Agriculture are intent on not only protecting the 
domestic agriculture sector but also delaying or 
derailing Russia's WTO accession.  If FSIS were 
to agree to another round of audits of U.S. meat 
and poultry facilities as is requested in the 
letter, the result would likely lead to even more 
delistings.  Post strongly urges FSIS and FAS to 
collaboratively develop a speedy response and 
advise VPSS that more time is needed to discuss 
this possibility with industry representatives 
before a decision can be made.  Failure to 
respond by the end of February will likely lead 
 
 
to retaliatory action by VPSS including further 
delistings of U.S. meat and poultry facilities. 
END COMMENT.
