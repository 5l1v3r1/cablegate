for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) On June 27, the DCM discussed reftel draft reform 
resolution with Joan Mosley, Director of the UN Division at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Mosley said she 
had already received and studied carefully the 
US-Australia-Japan paper.  GNZ agrees completely with the 
paper's intent, she said, but wonders whether tabling it as a 
resolution was not a "high-risk" strategy that might "scare 
the G-77."  Mosley said the Kiwi delegation in New York had 
told her there would be a JUSKCANZ meeting the morning of 
June 27 New York time to discuss the paper.  The delegation 
also reported that the President of the General Assembly 
would be calling the main players together to see what could 
be done to get buy-in for as much of the reform package as 
possible by June 30. 
 
¶2.  (C) The DCM stressed to Mosley that the Congress would 
soon be going home to begin serious campaigning for the 
November elections, and would need to see some evidence of 
political will in New York for reform.  If the General 
Assembly were to adjourn with a higher budget cap and no 
movement toward even modest reform, pressure within the 
Congress to cut US contributions to the UN budget could be 
overwhelming. 
 
¶3.  (C) MFAT's Americas Division also called us on the 27th 
to say that A/S Hill had phoned Deputy Foreign Secretary John 
McKinnon about the draft reform resolution.
