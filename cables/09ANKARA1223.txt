     ¶B. JULY 30 LEE-HOPKINS E-MAIL 
 
¶1. (SBU) MFA Maritime Affairs Section Head Haldun Tekneci 
confirmed on August 19 that the GOT fully supports the 
proposal to shift from the concept of "membership" in the 
Contact Group for Piracy Off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) to 
one of participation, in line with ref a and the presentation 
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for 
Political-Military Affairs Thomas Countryman provided to MFA 
Deputy U/S Haydar Berk during a July 30 meeting in Ankara 
(ref b).  Haldun subsequently provided a non-paper to 
summarize Turkey's understanding regarding this issue (see 
full text in para. 3). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Patience, a willingness to take GOT 
concerns into account and PDAS Countryman's personal 
engagement were critical in turning around Turkey's erstwhile 
rigid position of blocking the inclusion of Cyprus in CGPCS. 
End Comment.

ENLARGEMENT OF CGSP 
 
-- Turkey maintains its views and sensitivities regarding the 
membership to the Contact Group on Somali Piracy (CGSP). 
 
-- Notwithstanding the foregoing, our consideration of the 
United States' latest proposal for the enlargement of the 
CGSP to encompass all UN members is favorable. (Comment: 
Tekneci clarified verbally that Turkey supports the caveat 
that would exclude DPRK and Iran, but supports the inclusion 
of Somalia in CGPCS meetings given the important role it must 
play in this effort.  End Comment). 
 
-- This inclusive approach, we expect, will render possible 
for the international community to ever more effectively 
coordinate and closely cooperate in the efforts aimed at 
suppression of armed robbery at sea/piracy acts off the coast 
of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. 
 
-- Contributing to CTF-151 and NATO operation SNMG-2 with two 
frigates, Turkey will continue to actively participate in the 
work and deliberations of the CGSP and its Working Groups. 
 
-- It is our wish that the new proposal for the CGSP 
enlargement will enjoy support from the current members of 
the Contact Group.  We trust the United States and Japanese 
Governments' persuasive representations (sic) in this regard 
and hope the new format of "participants" for the CGSP will 
be introduced with general acclaim at the CGSP meeting to be 
held in New York on September 10, 2009. 
 
End Text of Non-Paper.
