(SBU)  On February 19 we delivered reftel points to MFA UN 
Section Deputy Director Jostein Leiro, who noted that he 
would communicate the points to his GON colleagues in Geneva. 
 The GON is preparing its delegation for this issue, and 
Jostein pledged that Norway would take the USG position into 
account.
