SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #6

SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U//FOUO//LES) February 15 Protest Activity - The "Anti-War and 
Anti-Militarization Moving Spectacle" drew approximately 100 
protesters who marched peacefully from the Vancouver Art Gallery 
through the urban core until slowly dispersing several hours later 
near the intersection of Abbott and Hastings. Preliminary reports 
suggested militant anarchist elements might embed themselves in the 
demonstration and/or proceed to the U.S. Consulate, located three 
blocks from the assembly point; however, this did not occur.  Local 
law enforcement was prepared to take a proactive role to interdict 
potential anarchist/criminal activity. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Several suspected Black Bloc members wearing balaclavas 
reportedly infiltrated the anti-homelessness rally "No Empty Talk, 
No Empty Lots" earlier in the day, but took no destructive action. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Anticipated Protest Activity - No protests are scheduled 
 
from 16 through 19 February.  The next demonstration - a "Rally for 
National Housing" - is scheduled for noon on Saturday, February 20 
at the Vancouver Art Gallery.  Diplomatic Security will continue to 
monitor protest activity and will provide updates as they become 
available. 
 
 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) No significant, Olympics-related incidents have occurred 
during this reporting period. 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Other than scheduled USOC and team movements, no 
significant Olympics-related security operations have transpired 
during this reporting period. 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
¶8.  The section assisted in arranging for a background interview 
for a New York Times reporter's story on security cooperation for 
the Olympics.  Post coordinated with Embassy Ottawa and WHA/PDA to 
obtain clearance and arrange for a background interview with CG 
Phil Chicola, with an attributable quote from Ambassador Jacobson 
to run in the story.  The Consul General's and the Ambassador's 
remarks reiterated U.S. confidence in Canadian security measures 
and abilities, while also stressing that the United States remains 
ready to assist Canada if needed and if requested. 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
¶9.   There is no significant information or activity to report. 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
¶10.   Citing safety concerns due to the unseasonably warm weather 
and rain in the Vancouver area, the Vancouver Olympic Committee 
cancelled all of the approximately 20,000 general admission 
standing room tickets for all events at Cypress Mountain. A 
schedule and results of all competitions throughout the Games can 
be found at http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-schedule -results/.
