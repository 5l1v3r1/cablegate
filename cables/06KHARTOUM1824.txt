¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  On July 28, members of the SLA/M 
"Military Council and Field Command" released a statement announcing 
the removal of Abdel Wahid as SLA/M Chairperson and appointment of 
Commander Ahmed Abdul Shafi as the new SLM chairperson and commander 
of the SLA.  The statement is likely the product of a July 25 
conference of SLM/A Wahid forces in the Jebel Marra region. 
Unsubstantiated reporting suggests that this group will soon join 
forces with the National Redemption Front.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT.
