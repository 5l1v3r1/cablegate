SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN POST-SHIPMENT END USE CHECK ON 
LICENSE 050137188 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
post-shipment check for the export of F-16 aircraft brake 
parts to Indonesia via the United Kingdom.  Post is requested 
to complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: the original license application 
listed a Singapore company as a Foreign Intermediate 
Consignee.  This company was removed from the license before 
approval due to concerns about possible diversion of the 
commodity.  The Department now wishes to conduct a 
post-shipment check to confirm receipt of the commodity by 
the Foreign End User. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign End User, Indonesian 
Air Force, and confirm its receipt of the exact quantity and 
specific type of the commodities listed below.  Please also 
confirm intended use of the commodity.  END ACTION.
