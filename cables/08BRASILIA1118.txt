SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Post Brasilia reaffirms that the conduct of Google Earth 
Outreach, building conservation partnerships with indigenous leaders 
and practitioners in the Amazon forests of Brazil, has been 
exemplary and deserving of consideration for State's 2008 Award for 
Corporate Excellence (ACE).  An award for Google Earth Outreach 
would further highlight Director of Foreign Assistance Henrietta 
Fore's recent challenge to U.S. companies operating in Brazil, 
expressed during her August 7-10, 2008 trip to Brazil, to aspire to 
even greater levels of corporate social responsibility worldwide. 
Responses to questions follow. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Could there possibly be any downside or embarrassment 
caused by the selection of your post's nominee? See paragraph 6. 
Recent press regarding Google's activities and cooperation has been 
positive and we believe the possibility for embarrassment to be 
negligible.  Although Google Earth Outreach is a lesser known member 
of the Google family, public perception of Google products is very 
positive and the partnership of Google Earth Outreach with the 
indigenous group is a compelling story of innovative corporate 
social responsibility and targeted outreach of Google mapping 
technologies, exemplifying of one of Director of Foreign Assistance 
Henrietta Fore's keystone development concepts, the Global 
Development Commons.  For an update on Google Earth Outreach 
engagement with the Surui people, see: http:

¶3.  (SBU) Do you have any information concerning job creation in the 
United States resulting from the operations of the company you 
nominated?  Job creation was not the focus of this nomination, 
although Google is doing quite well in Brazil - and therefore, 
creating jobs in the United States. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) What is your assessment of the company's trade and 
investment activities with regard to helping stimulate economic 
growth in the U.S. and increasing American exports?  Google is a 
global company on the cutting edge of information technology 
worldwide, stimulating economic growth in the U.S. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) What is the state of labor conditions in the company's 
facilities and are workers unionized?  As a high-tech company, 
Google offers adequate working conditions. We do not have any 
information about worker unionization. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Are you aware of any litigation pending in local courts 
involving the company? Yes, Google has legal matters pending in 
Brazil, including the aftermath of a Brazilian Parliamentary 
Inquiry, over allegations that Google and member company Orkut were 
unwilling to provide information to law enforcement authorities on 
the identity of pedophiles and individuals involved in child 
pornography.  We understand that Orkut is cooperating with local 
authorities.  Apparently Google, partly because of its visibility as 
the leading search engine, is still subject to occasional requests 
by federal authorities to disclose user information.  However, we do 
not see possible granting of an ACE award to Google Earth Outreach 
as a complicating factor in outstanding litigation, but rather as 
solid evidence of Google's positive engagement in sound economic and 
social development in Brazil. 
 
¶7.  Please confirm that the Chief of Mission and others involved in 
the nomination process do not hold shares of stock or have other 
financial interests in the company.  Ambassador has told Post about 
a potential conflict of having a sibling who works for Google, and 
in order to be very careful, has directed Post to refer all Google 
related information to DCM Lisa Kubiske.  By informing the DCM 
directly on all Google matters, the conflict has been dealt with.
