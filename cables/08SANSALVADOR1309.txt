¶1. (C) Responding to the request for Salvadoran action 
regarding Nicaragua's elections, MFA Director General of 
Foreign Policy Werner Romero and Director General of Central 
American Relations Jorge Alberto Umana Garcia told us 
November 20 that El Salvador would not get involved.  Umana 
said he did not expect to see further OAS involvement in the 
Nicaraguan election drama and dismissed the suggestion of a 
Central American Integration System (SICA) role, saying it 
was not designed to address this type of issue.  Romero said 
it is a delicate situation for El Salvador because Nicaragua 
is a neighboring country, and there are many political and 
business interests between the two.  Umana said there may be 
a resolution raised at the upcoming December 5 Heads of State 
SICA summit, but stressed that El Salvador would not take an 
active role against Nicaragua. 
 
¶2. (U) In the absence of official GOES action, Salvadoran 
media have covered the Nicaraguan elections extensively, with 
the leading newspapers taking a firm editorial line against 
the Sandinistas' fraud and GON-incited violence.
