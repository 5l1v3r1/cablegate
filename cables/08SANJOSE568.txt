SUBJECT: COSTA RICA MFA STATES NO OFFICIAL POSITION YET ON 
ZIMBABWE ELECTION AFTERMATH 
 
REF: A. STATE 70836 
     ¶B. STATE 70882 
 
¶1. (U) On July 2, we passed the U.S. draft resolution on 
Zimbabwe, per reftels, to Deyanira Ramirez, MFA UN Officer. 
She had not seen the text nor had heard it was coming.  She 
promised to review it and respond. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) We asked Ramirez whether Costa Rica had taken a 
position on the Zimbabwe situation in the aftermath of the 
election, and she said that no, the GOCR had not yet defined 
its official position on what should happen next.  She 
offered, however, her personal opinion that the international 
community has to react and cannot let this violation of the 
people's will stand.  Post will follow up and will inform 
when/if we receive a more substantive response.
