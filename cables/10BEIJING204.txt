  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. INTERNET FREEDOM 
 
a. "Keep in mind the lessons learned by blindly following the West's 
steps" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/26)(pg 14): "A few Chinese intellectuals 
are fascinated about Western political theories, hoping that China 
would quickly be a part of the so-called mainstream civilization, 
represented by the West.  But looking at the former Soviet Union's 
historical lesson, China should be cautious when participating in a 
civilization that was formed without China's influence.  China's 
rise is happening in a rapid way, without the West's recognition. 
Historically, if China followed the lead of Western discourse, China 
would not be rising but would have repeated the collapse of the 
former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.  Along with China's rise, the 
rearrangement of the international order has begun, in which China's 
role is crucial.  Chinese intellectuals should no longer follow the 
lead of Western discourse, but adopt independent thinking and 
explore and construct China's own discourse and strategy in the 
'post-America era.'" 
 
b. "Abnormal mentality" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(01/26)(pg 
23): "At the beginning of 2010, Sino-U.S. relations are experiencing 
a cold-streak.  U.S. officials, who used to speak in a cautious 
manner, have shown their tough stance concerning the Google 
incident.  The reason for this is their Cold War mentality and 
prejudice against China, which are built based on their moral 
superiority and arrogance.  They repeatedly point their fingers at 
China on democracy, human rights and freedom but ignore China's 
development and progress over the past 30 years.  In fact, the U.S. 
has also been flawed in these fields.  Double standards are being 
adopted because of this mentality.  Secretary Clinton in her speech 
about Internet Freedom admitted that the nature of the Internet is 
like a double-edged sword, which is ironic because when the U.S. 
swings its big stick at others it exposes its own hypocrisy.  The 
abnormal mentality they have is very short-sighted, and it will do 
tremendous harm to U.S.-China relations.  The Google incident proved 
that the American people's rigid, ideology-focused mentality did not 
change much after the financial crisis.  This type of mentality will 
bring the U.S. big troubles." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Copenhagen was the turning point of 2009 Sino-U.S. relations" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(01/26)(pg A5): "Yuan Peng, director of 
China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, said that 
the Copenhagen Conference was the turning point of Sino-U.S. 
relations.  Obama thought that postponing the meeting with the Dalai 
Lama and keeping a low profile on human rights' issues would be a 
good exchange for China's concessions on the issue of climate 
change.  What happened in Copenhagen showed that, at critical times, 
China and the U.S. still have profound differences in key areas, 
although they cooperate on climate change.  The result of the 
Copenhagen Conference was not what Obama had expected, which has, 
therefore, led to the enlarging disputes between the two countries. 
However, the development mechanism of Sino-U.S. relations for the 
past 30 years will still work.  This growing spiral trend will not 
change.  American companies have to learn a lesson from the Google 
incident.  They are doing business in China.  At the same time they 
should respect China's values, ideology and regulations." 
 
¶3. U.S. MILITARY 
 
"'Patriot' missiles become a strategic pawn of the United States" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(01/26)(pg 7): "Recently the world is debating the 
hot-button issues from the U.S. sales of 'Patriot' missiles to 
Taiwan to the U.S.'s deployment of the missiles in Poland.  For the 
U.S., the Patriot missile is no longer a weapon, but an important 
pawn tofulfil its global strategy.  As a type of advanced missile, 
the Patriot has attracted the interests of many countries and 
regions.  Selling Patriot missiles is not just arms sales, but a way 
to strengthen the U.S.'s ties with its allies.  Patriot missiles' 
targets are normally the U.S.'s potential opponents.  By deploying 
Patriot missiles in Poland, the U.S. is enabled to conduct 
consecutive surveillance over Russian activities.  This move has 
increased Russia's distrust of Europe and will intensify and 
Europe-Russian confrontation, which is conducive to the U.S.'

interests in European affairs.  If a country obeys the orders of the 
United States it will be awarded the permission of buying Patriot 
missiles.  If it does not, U.S. Patriot missiles will appear at the 
doorstep of this country, if not around it."
