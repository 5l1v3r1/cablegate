In Today's Papers 
 
Scowcroft: "Turkey and the US Must Move Beyond A Military 
Alliance." 
Mainstream Aksam interviewed Brent Scowcroft, the head of the 
American-Turkish Council (ATC) and former presidential advisor to 
former President George Bush.  Scowcroft said "the U.S. turned a 
blind eye to the PKK" and "encouraged PJAK against Iran."  "Now, 
however, the situation has changed.  We want Iran on our side," said 
Scowcroft.  He added that during the war in Iraq, the U.S. was not 
willing to waste its energy to fight against the PKK.  "Now the U.S. 
will adopt a new policy in the Middle East.  There's a huge need for 
Turkey; this region is your backyard," emphasized Scowcroft.  He 
noted, "President Obama sees the regional importance of Turkey, and 
thinks the ties need revision.  We must move beyond a mere military 
alliance." 
 
Turkey and IMF Expected to Strike a Deal Soon 
Media outlets report Prime Minister Erdogan, who is in London for 
the G-20 Summit, held a meeting with the IMF Managing Director 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn during which the two sides agreed in 
principle to resume direct talks.  Turkey's Central Bank Governor 
Durmus Yilmaz told a conference yesterday, "a deal must be signed 
with the IMF as soon as possible."  The IMF and Turkey are expected 
to sign a three-year stand-by deal after the G-20 summit in London. 
An IMF team will pay a visit to Turkey within two weeks to work on 
the new deal.  The stand-by loan accord could be worth as much as 
USD 20 billion, according to reports. 
 
TRT Kicks off Armenian, Kurdish Radio Broadcasts 
Media outlets report that prior to President Obama's visit to 
Turkey, the state-run broadcaster TRT has launched radio broadcasts 
in Kurdish and Armenian.  The 24-hour Kurdish radio broadcasts 
comprised of news and music programs are aired by Radio 6.  The 
Armenian-language programs will be aired by The Voice of Turkey 
radio twice in a day at 07:00-07:30 and 18:00-18:30 local time. 
Mainstream Aksam says the broadcasts will be in the eastern Armenian 
dialect, not the western dialect which is used by the Armenians 
living in Diaspora. 
 
Erdogan Meets Obama at G-20 London Summit 
Media outlets report that Prime Minister Erdogan held brief talks 
with President Obama in London during the G-20 Summit meetings.  He 
also met with  German Chancellor Merkel, Spanish PM Zapatero and the 
Dutch PM Balkenende.  Erdogan and Obama talked about the U.S. 
President's upcoming state visit to Turkey, report papers and 
televisions. 
 
Mainstream Hurriyet writes the G-20 leaders have agreed on "a new 
world order," based on "transparency and control."  Mainstream Aksam 
says the summit marked the end of an era of "unbridled global 
capitalism." 
 
Cicek: My Remarks on the DTP's Election Success Misinterpreted 
Papers report Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said Thursday that 
his statements over the pro-Kurdish DTP's success in the local 
elections were "misinterpreted."  Cicek stated he just wanted to 
draw attention to the rise of "ethnicity-based politics," which, he 
said, was "wrong."  Cicek told private broadcaster NTV that he was 
facing a "lynching campaign" over his remarks.  Cicek's remarks had 
drawn reactions from the DTP and his own party, including Prime 
Minister Erdogan. 
 
Talabani Backtracks on PKK Remarks 
Media outlets report Iraqi President Jalal Talabani rejected press 
reports that he had called on the PKK to lay down its arms. 
Talabani said his words that the PKK should "lay down its weapons or 
leave Iraq" were in fact the approach of Turkey.  "I have just tried 
to give the message that the period of waging armed struggle was 
over," Talabani said.  Mainstream Vatan writes Talabani could stand

behind his words only for 11 days.
