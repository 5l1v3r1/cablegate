SUBJECT: AMISOM Plane Fire--Update 
 
REF:  Nairobi 1134 
 
¶1. Per reftel, an IL-76 cargo plane ferrying equipment 
for the Ugandan army's AMISOM mission caught fire while 
landing in Mogadishu on Friday, March 9.  Numerous press 
reports indicate--alternately--that the IL-76 was hit by 
a "missile" or rocket propelled grenade (RPG) or that it 
experienced mechanical/structural difficulties during the 
landing procedure.  Somali insurgents with ties to al- 
Qaida claim that they attacked and hit the plane. 
 
¶2. The plane's contractor reportedly stated that the IL- 
76 was indeed hit by an RPG. 
 
¶3.  On the other hand, AMISOM and the Somali Transitional 
Federal Government stated that the problem was probably 
mechanical/structural but are continuing to investigate. 
 
¶4.  Pending further evidence one way or the other, the 
question of what actually occurred during the aircraft's 
landing maneuvers remains open. 
 
¶5.  Embassy Kampala has cleared this message.
