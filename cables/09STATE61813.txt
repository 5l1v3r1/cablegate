SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - IRAQ 
 
¶1.  The Department of State continues to warn U.S. 
citizens of the dangers inherent in travel to Iraq and 
recommends against all but essential travel in country 
given the fluid security situation.  Numerous insurgent 
groups remain active throughout Iraq.  Iraqi Security 
Forces (ISF)-led military operations continue, and 
attacks persist against the ISF and U.S. forces in many 
areas of the country.  Turkish government forces have 
carried out operations against elements of the Kongra- 
Gel terrorist group (KGK, formerly Kurdistan Worker's 
Party or PKK) located along Iraq's northern border. 
This Travel Warning warns U.S. citizens of the current 
security situation and reiterates the dangers of the use 
of civilian aircraft and of road travel within Iraq. 
This replaces the Travel Warning of June 13, 2008, to 
provide an update on security incidents and additional 
concerns about travel within Iraq. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Iraq Remains Dangerous and Unpredictable 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  While the security environment has shown significant 
improvement over the past year, Iraq remains dangerous 
and unpredictable.  Attacks against military and 
civilian targets throughout Iraq continue, including in 
the International (or "Green") Zone.  Methods of attack 
have included roadside improvised explosive devices 
(IEDs), mortars and rockets, and human- and vehicle- 
borne IEDs.  Kidnappings still occur; the most recent 
confirmed kidnapping of an American citizen reported to 
the U.S. Embassy occurred during July 2008 in Nassariya. 
In addition to terrorist and criminal attacks, sectarian 
violence occurs often.  U.S. Government personnel 
require special permission and a security detail at all 
times when traveling outside of secure facilities and 
are prohibited from traveling to certain areas of Iraq 
depending on prevailing security conditions.  Detailed 
security information is available on the Embassy's web 
site at http://iraq.usembassy.gov and at 
http://www.centcom.mil. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Transportation to/from and within Iraq 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Travelers choosing to utilize commercial carriers to 
enter or depart Iraq should be aware that, although 
there have been no recent attacks on civilian aircraft, 
the potential threat still exists, as does the high risk 
to road transportation as described above.  U.S. 
Government personnel, with limited exceptions, are 
generally required to use U.S. military or other 
official aircraft when entering or departing Iraq. 
There have been no recent security-related incidents 
associated with civilian airport operations.  Embassy 
employees, including those resident in northern Iraq, 
may seek authorization, and under special limited 
circumstances, have obtained permission to use 
commercial airlines and civilian airports when entering 
or departing Iraq.  Civilians, including tourists, 
business people, and temporary residents should 
recognize the risks associated with air travel to Iraq 
and must be guided by the security policies of their 
agencies, companies and sponsors.

Northern Iraq

¶4.  The security situation in Sulymaniya, Erbil, and 
 
STATE 00061813  002 OF 002 
 
 
Dohuk Governorates in northern Iraq has been relatively 
more stable than the rest of Iraq in recent years, but 
violence persists and conditions could deteriorate 
quickly.  Even though there have been fewer terrorist 
attacks and lower levels of insurgent violence in 
Sulymaniya, Erbil, and Dohuk than in other parts of 
Iraq, the security situation throughout the country 
remains fluid.  Violence associated with the status of 
Kirkuk is likely to continue, at least within Kirkuk. 
Insurgent groups continue to operate across the north. 
In 2008, multiple incidents occurred in Sulymaniya, 
Erbil, and Dohuk involving IEDs, rocket and mortar fire, 
vehicle bombs, and shootings, though none resulted in 
U.S. casualties.  While many parts of northern Iraq have 
become more stable, Mosul continues to experience 
intense violence and instability. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
International Zone Restrictions 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  The U.S. Embassy is located in the International 
Zone (IZ) in Baghdad.  The IZ is a restricted access 
area.  The U.S. Government considers the potential 
threat to U.S. Government personnel assigned to Iraq to 
be sufficiently serious so as to require them to live 
and work under strict security guidelines. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Limited Emergency Support to American Citizens 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6.  The U.S. Embassy provides limited visa services to 
the general public and provides restricted emergency 
services to U.S. citizens in Iraq, particularly those 
located outside of Baghdad.  American citizens who 
choose to visit or reside in Iraq despite this Travel 
Warning are urged to take responsibility for their own 
personal security and belongings (including their U.S. 
passports), avoid crowds, especially rallies or 
demonstrations, and to inform the U.S. Embassy of their 
presence in Iraq.  All Americans in Iraq are asked to 
register with the Embassy at the following website: 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs. 
 
------------------- 
Contact Information 
------------------- 
 
¶7.  American citizens may obtain the latest security 
information or other information about Iraq by 
contacting the U.S. Embassy, located in the 
International Zone, via landline at 1-240-553-0581, via 
e-mail to baghdadacs@state.gov, or by accessing the U.S. 
Embassy's website at http://iraq.usembassy.gov.  The 
after-hours numbers in cases of extreme emergency are 
011-964-770-443-2594 (from the US) or 964 0770-443- 
2594(within Iraq). 
 
¶8.  Updated information on travel and security in Iraq 
may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 
1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada 
or, for callers outside the United States and Canada, a 
regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444.  For further 
information, please consult the Country Specific 
Information for Iraq, as well as the Worldwide Caution, 
both of which are available on the Bureau of Consular 
Affairs Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov/. 
 
¶9.  Minimize considered.
