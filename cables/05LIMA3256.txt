REF: SECSTATE 119974 
 
This is a joint STATE, USDA and USAID cable. 
 
¶1.  On Friday July 1 Ambassador J. Curtis Struble met with 
Foreign Relations Minister Ambassador Manuel Rodriguez Cuadros of 
Peru and delivered the talking points in reftel.  Subsequently, a 
translation of the talking points was sent in a letter from the 
Ag Attache to the Ministers of Economy and Finance, Commerce, 
Industry and Tourism, Agriculture, and Women and Social 
Development.  Post has followed up with phone calls to encourage 
Peru to make its opinions known in Geneva. 
 
¶2.  Post has been informed that official communication on this 
matter to the Peruvian delegation in Geneva is problematic 
because of the change of Ambassador Elizabeth Astete, who will 
leave Geneva at the end of this month.  Furthermore, we 
understand Peru's representation in Geneva was not invited to the 
U.S. briefing on this subject. 
 
¶3.  So far there is general agreement among GOP officials 
contacted on the US position of continuing in-kind food 
assistance "for humanitarian emergencies".  According to Victoria 
Elmore, National Director for Multilateral Matters and 
International Commercial Negotiations at the Ministry of Trade, 
Peru recognizes that food aid can be a form of direct subsidy, 
but that extremely poor populations are dependent on direct food 
assistance.  Transition periods are needed to elevate these 
populations out of poverty.  Lander Pacora, former Vice minister 
and Senior Advisor to the Minister of Agriculture, opined 
informally in support of empowering developing countries to 
request whatever form of assistance they need without pre- 
judgment. 
 
¶4.  Post will continue to follow-up with key Peruvian ministries 
and explore how messages will be transmitted through the Peruvian 
Embassy in Geneva.
