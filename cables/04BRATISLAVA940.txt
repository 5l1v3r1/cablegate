Per reftel, PolOff and FSN met October 13 with Radoslav 
Kusenda, Desk Officer for Ukraine.  Kusenda reaffirmed that 
Slovakia is concerned with the situation in Ukraine and 
stressed that the international community must speak loudly 
now before the election takes place to ensure democratic 
norms are followed.  As a state with a common border with 
Ukraine, Kusenda said Slovakia could not commit to 
"reexamine" its policy if the election does not meet 
democratic standards.  Slovakia will continue to focus on 
Ukrainian democracy through the "strong financial 
instruments of the EU's European Neighbourhood Policy."
