Diplomatic Adviser to two consecutive Defense Ministers,

the MFA Director General for Political Affairs, and from 
1996 to 1998, his Chief of Staff.  He was Deputy Chief of 
Mission in Moscow from 1998 to 2002, and Deputy Permanent 
Representative to NATO from 2002 to 2004.

proficiency, having spent much of his youth in Australia.
