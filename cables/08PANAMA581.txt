 IRAN CIRCULATES DRAFT STATEMENT 
 ------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) POL had delivered Reftel demarche to MFA political 
advisor Janio Tunon on July 16 to discuss Panama's position 
in the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial Conference 
scheduled for July 29-30. POL underscored that Panama held a 
unique position as a NAM representative and UNSC member. POL 
urged Panama to convince other NAM countries that Iran had 
continued to defy UNSC obligations and should suspend its 
uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. 
 
¶2. (C) Tunon informed POL that Iran had circulated a draft 
statement regarding its "peaceful nuclear program" to all NAM 
members. The statement reiterated Iran's position on its 
"right to nuclear technology" and requested that all NAM 
ministerial representatives support the following: 
 
--Sanctions imposed on Iran for its nuclear program are of 
political nature and should be promptly removed as there is 
no legal basis for the UN Security Council to proceed in this 
matter. All outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear 
program should be negotiated between Iran and the IAEA only. 
 
--As declared in the 2006 Heads of State Summit statement 
delivered in Havana, NAM representatives defended Iran's 
right to nuclear technology. Iran, as a State Party to the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, had the right to continue its fuel 
cycle program for peaceful purposes. 
 
--The IAEA declared that there was no diversion in the 
peaceful nuclear activities of Iran and asserted that Iran 
resolved all outstanding issues with the IAEA. 
 
------------------------------- 
PANAMA DISAGREES WITH STATEMENT 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Tunon presented Panama's written response to Iran's 
statement and outlined areas where Panama disagreed. Tunon 
stated that since release of the Havana Summit Statement in 
2006, Panama supported UNSC resolutions that imposed 
sanctions on Iran and demanded suspension of Iran's uranium 
enrichment program. He also highlighted that Iran's assertion 
that it had complied with IAEA obligations was false. As 
noted in the IAEA's May 26, 2008 report, Iran continued to 
defy reporting obligations and had not fully disclosed its 
nuclear activities. While discussing Panama's role during the 
NAM conference, Tunon noted that Panama would maintain a "low 
profile" and would suggest quietly that Iran comply with UNSC 
obligations and consider the P5 1 package presented by the 
European Union. Considering that the NAM conference would be 
in Tehran, Tunon did not expect strong verbal declarations by 
Panama against Iran's statement.

COMMENT

¶4. (C) Tunon affirmed that Panama would maintain 
communication with POL and update Post once he received an 
updated draft on Iran's campaign to gather NAM support on its 
nuclear program.
