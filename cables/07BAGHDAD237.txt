SUBJECT: U.N. UNDERSECRETARY GENERAL VANESS DISCUSSES 
STAFFING AND BASRAH 


Classified By: Ambassador Khalilzad for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 

¶1. (C) Summary: In a January 19 meeting, United Nations 
Undersecretary General (U/SG) for Safety and Security David 
¶C. Vaness and Special Representative to the Secretary General 
(SRSG) Ashraf Qazi discussed with the Ambassador UNAMI 
mission staffing, Basrah facilities, oil revenue sharing, and 
the new Baghdad security plan. End Summary. 

--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Staffing Should Be Driven By Mission, Not Security 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 

¶2. (C) U/SG Vanness explained that at this time last year the 
UN prepared a report on security and engagement in Iraq. The 
focus was to determine how the UN would rely on the 
Government of Iraq (GOI) for security, once a conventional 
relationship emerges. However, since events did not unfold 
in 2006 as expected, they are now repeating the exercise. 
The new report will cover calendar year 2007. 

¶3. (C) The Ambassador asked what will be the role of the 
UNAMI mission on the political side. He noted there is much 
more UNAMI can do, and expressed concern that UNAMI staffing 
was going in the wrong direction. SRSG Qazi needs to have 
the people to do the job, he stressed. 

¶4. (C) U/SG Veness confirmed that UNAMI would remain engaged 
on constitutional review, elections, and border disputes 
involving Kirkuk. The latter, he observed, must be resolved 
before provincial elections can be held. The Ambassador 
agreed and underlined their importance, since in some areas 
the Governing Councils are not representative of the local 
population. 

¶5. (C) U/SG Veness explained that the number of staff was 
driven by security considerations and the number of hardened 
living accommodations available (Note: UNAMI has 55 hardened 
living accommodations). The Ambassador pointed out that a 
staffing timeline for elections, constitution review, and 
Kirkuk is easily predicted. 

¶6. (C) U/SG Veness answered that staffing would follow as 
soon as they could provide extra shelters; they planned to 
move into their permanent facility in early 2008, a few 
months after the U.S. moves into its new embassy compound. 
The current staffing problem, U/SG Veness continued, is 
temporary and short term. The Ambassador asked Veness to 
think of ways in which the USG could be helpful. 

--------------- 
Revenue Sharing 
--------------- 

¶7. (C) SRSG Qazi warned that although there is progress on 
the hydrocarbon law, legislation will not solve what he 
perceives to be a deep structural problem with the 
constitution: that any such revenue sharing laws, which are 
not enshrined in the constitution, are at risk of being 
either re-written by subsequent legislation or in effect 
overruled by regional laws. The constitution review process 
needs to reflect and memorialize the current revenue sharing 
compromises. 

------------------------------------------- 
Terrorists Should Not Push Us Out of Basrah 
------------------------------------------- 

¶8. (C) U/SG Veness inquired about our plans for Basrah - if 
there is a way for the U.S. to stay in the palace, they would 
very much like to participate. The Ambassador explained that 
strategically, we want a significant presence in Iraq's 
south. For example, Najaf is especially important as the 
center of Shia religious leadership and for its strong ties 
to Iran. As for Basrah, the Ambassador explained that the 
USG is in discussions with our British colleagues about 
whether to stay in the palace. Abandoning the palace under 
terrorist pressure would not be a good signal to send the 
terrorists, he pointed out. U/SG Veness agreed that moving 
to the Basrah Air Station would not be good for the long term. 

--------------------- 
Baghdad Security Plan 
--------------------- 

¶9. (C) U/SG Veness asked whether the new Baghdad security 
plan would create the political space everyone needs. The 
Ambassador outlined the key highlights: pursue lawbreakers 
with no sanctuary, no GOI political interference with the 
rules of engagement, and political, economic and services

components in addition to the security effort. Operations 
are now allowed against senior militia leaders, and we are 
focusing on the Syrian and Iranian networks. This is not a 
narrow security plan, but a comprehensive stabilization plan. 
U/SG Veness hoped the next several months would be favorable.
