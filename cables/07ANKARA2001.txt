SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (July 24-31, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 1909 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) From July 24-31, 2007, two security officials were killed in 
action (KIA).  Four security officials, including one village guard, 
were wounded in action (WIA). 
 
¶3. (U) From July 24-31, two PKK terrorists were killed in action and 
six surrendered. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported five clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in the region during the reporting period. 
Security forces discovered at least 12 PKK shelters/caves and seized 
booby-trapped land mines; other explosives, including A-4 and TNT; 
Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; night vision 
binoculars; TV sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) On July 24, a group of PKKers stopped a vehicle in Tunceli, 
stole the civilian driver's cell phone and money, and set the 
vehicle on fire. 
 
¶6. (U) On July 26, a civilian in the village of Eruh, Siirt 
Province, who refused to give food to PKKers was abducted, forced 
into surrounding mountains, and killed. 
 
¶7. (U) On July 30, a civilian was injured when a land mine set by 
the PKK exploded in the mountainous region of Sirnak. 
 
¶8. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
