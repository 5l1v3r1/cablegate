SUBJECT: INDONESIANS REQUEST US HELP TO CALM RICE MARKETS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  This is an action request.  Indonesian Trade 
Minister Mari Pangestu has requested that the U.S Government seek to 
persuade Japan and China to release rice stocks in an effort to calm 
world rice markets.  Rice prices in Asia have tripled in the past 
four months, despite ample stocks.  Indonesian officials expect the 
country will need to import rice later this year. I would request 
that Under Secretary Jeffery contact Japanese and Chinese 
counterparts this week to support Minister Pangestu's request. 
 
Trade Minister Seeks US Assistance 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu has requested U.S. 
assistance in persuading Japan and China to release rice stocks in 
an effort to calm world rice markets.  She expects that Indonesia 
will need to import rice during the third or fourth quarter this 
year, despite signs that the 2008 harvest will exceed last year's 
level.  If current trends continue, Indonesia is likely to face rice 
prices three to four times higher than last year.  Minister Pangestu 
noted that market failures, in the form of export restrictions 
primarily by India and Vietnam and panic buying from the 
Philippines, are the primary causes of recent price increases. 
Although rice prices have tripled in the past four months in Asia, 
the region as a whole is in rice surplus.  The equilibrium price of 
rice in Asia should be around $600 per metric ton, or half the 
current level, according to the Minister. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In the Minister's view, China and Japan hold the key to 
calming markets in the short term and countering the perception that 
the region is facing a rice shortage.  Experts estimate that the 
current rice shortfall in international markets is roughly 4 million 
metric tons.  China holds 37 million metric tons of rice in storage, 
equivalent to 3 months of consumption needs, according to Pangestu. 
Most other nations hold one month of consumption needs for emergency 
purposes.  Japan holds an additional 1.5 million metric tons of rice 
in storage that it has imported from California.  Minister Pangestu 
believes the Japanese government will hesitate to release these 
stocks without the tacit consent of the United States, given 
long-standing U.S. efforts to open the Japanese rice market. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Minister Pangestu is meeting with her ASEAN counter-parts 
this weekend in Bali, where they will discuss the rice price issue 
in detail.  Ambassador Susan Schwab will meet with Minister Pangestu 
on the margins of the ASEAN meetings on Friday, May 2.  I hope you 
can be in touch with your Japanese and Chinese counterparts in time 
for Ambassador Schwab to be able to provide feedback to Minister 
Pangestu on her request.
