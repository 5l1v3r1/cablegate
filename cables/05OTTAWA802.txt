¶1.  (SBU) Poloff discussed the U.S. priorities at the 61st 
session of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR-61) with 
Henri-Paul Normandin, director of the human rights division 
at Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC), per ref a, on March 15. 
Normandin, who will be attending the final 3 weeks of CHR-61, 
referred to the bi-lateral consultations held at FAC on 
February 14 in preparation for CHR-61, and indicated that 
Canada's priorities were consistent with what was discussed 
at that meeting (ref b).  Continuing, he said he would pass 
the demarche within FAC, and would advise us if there were 
any significant changes in Canada's positions at CHR-61.
