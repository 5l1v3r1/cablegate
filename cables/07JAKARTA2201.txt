¶1.  (SBU) This message is Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Indonesian police expressed optimism that 
new evidence they have submitted to the Attorney General's 
Office (AGO) in the case of murdered human rights leader 
Munir will lead to successful prosecution.  Head of Internal 
Investigations Division Bambang Hendarso told Senate Foreign 
Affairs Committee Staff Member Keith Luse on August 9 that 
President Yudhoyono and the Chief of Police are both 
committed to convict "whoever was behind" the murder. 
Hendarso could not disclose details of the new evidence but 
did say that all the evidence will come to public light in 
upcoming court hearings.  The first hearing, scheduled for 
August 9, has been delayed until August 16.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Senate Foreign Staff Member Keith Luse met with the 
Indonesian National Police's Head of Internal Investigations 
Bambang Hendarso on August 9, to get an update on the status 
of the Munir murder case.  Hendarso gathered six members of 
the nine-person Munir police investigation team for the 
meeting.  Hendarso confirmed that the case presented to the 
Central Jakarta Court has significant new evidence (Ref A). 
"Hopefully the case will succeed because of new evidence we 
have given to prosecutors.  This will not be finished until 
we get whoever is behind the case," Hendarso told Luse and 
poloff.  Jakarta Central Court is scheduled to hear the case 
on August 16. 
 
President Ordered Munir Case to be Solved 
----------------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU)  Emphasizing the GOI's commitment to solve the case, 
Hendarso said Chief of Police Sutanto had ordered him to 
complete the case as quickly as possible and had given him a 
nine-person veteran police team to work on the case full time 
since the beginning of the year.  He emphasized that 
President Yudhoyono ordered the police chief and the Attorney 
General to see the case solved. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Hendarso said he could not reveal details of new 
evidence nor the identity of new suspects, explaining that 
divulging information could damage the case in court, but 
said that all the facts would be publicly revealed in court 
hearings open to the public.  However, Hendarso did explain 
how thorough the investigation has been.  For example, police 
flew on a Garuda Airlines plane from Jakarta to Singapore to 
reenact the entire sequences of events (ref B).  Hendarso 
added that two new suspects in the case, two Garuda 
executives, have been held for the past four months pending 
the upcoming hearings. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Police are also spending heavily on the case, 
Hendarso said, citing the $65,000 that they are spending to 
escort one Indonesian witness from Germany to Indonesia under 
protective custody.  An American forensic expert from a 
private lab in Washington state who examined the arsenic 
content in Munir's body might also be brought to testify, he 
said. 
 
Luse Praises "Courage and Leadership" 
------------------------------------ 
¶7. (SBU) Luse told Hendarso that Senator Lugar and his 
colleagues appreciate the police's "willingness to pursue the 
truth no matter where the truth may take you," saying this 
takes courage on the part of the police and their leaders. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Asked about possible motives, Hendarso said he could 
not respond specifically but did say that the "motive was 
connected with Munir's human rights activities in general." 
 
 
¶9.  (U) Keith Luse cleared this message.
