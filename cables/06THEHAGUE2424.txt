¶1. (U) Econoff delivered on November 8 reftel points 
concerning further debt relief for the International Compact 
with Iraq to Hans de Voogd, responsible for bilateral debt 
relief, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Nicole Bollen, 
Head of the Dutch Paris Club Delegation, Ministry of Finance. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Dutch officials said that the Netherlands would 
not forgive more than 80% of their share of Iraq's debt. 
Bollen said that 80% was "too much" but that the Dutch would 
proceed as agreed to during the debt forgiveness 
negotiations. The Dutch adhere to the principle of 
sustainable debt, she added, and 80% forgiveness would be 
"more than enough" to meet this objective. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Dutch officials noted that all of the debt owed 
by Iraq to the Netherlands was commercial debt, not official 
development assistance loans.
