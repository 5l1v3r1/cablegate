OZGUR GUNDEM:   The U.S. will reportedly stop its operations 
at its jet fuel supply hub at the port of Yumurtalik in Adana. 
 
 
EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:        DTP Chairperson Ahmet Turk said 
that, from now on, as a party which had been making preparations 
for the next elections, DTP has to engage in efforts to retool 
its organized structures.  Dialogue among the Kurds should be 
fostered to define a road map for a common ground and 
perspective among Kurds in order to make demands of the Kurds 
clear, said Turk. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Aziz Azkul, a PKK terrorist whom the Forensic 
Authority announced was killed by blows to the head on May 25 in 
Kars, because of an alleged internal PKK disagreement according 
to 07/11 edition of Hurriyet daily, has been buried in a village 
of Mardin, reported Ozgur Gundem daily.  Hundreds of cars 
escorted the coffin as it traveled to the village and members of 
DTP's Mardin chapter have also attended the burial ceremony. 
 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The daily continues to cover in its front page 
with big-size photos the story of alleged extra-judicial killing 
of a PKK terrorist in August 2005, published photos of that 
terrorist alive, walking beside security officers shortly after 
being captured.  The daily further named five other terrorists 
who were also allegedly killed after they were caught. 
Diyarbakir Bar Association, Mazlum-Der (Solidarity Association 
for Oppressed People) and Human Rights Association, which has 
filed a complaint upon those allegations, said they would carry 
the matter to the European Court if action fails to address the 
issue. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Village guards allegedly opened fire and 
killed one of the four bothers who came from Igdir province to 
Erzurum province to work as shepherds following a quarrel over a 
sheep which the shepherds lost.  The other brothers have been 
wounded. 
 
BOLGE / EKSPRES / SABAH (GUNEY) / ZAMAN:        The court action

the burial ceremony of the businessman.
