SUBJECT: GAZA CEASEFIRE CONTINUES FOR 4TH DAY; NO CHANGE IN 
STATUS OF GAZA CROSSINGS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Gaza Strip ceasefire is being observed without 
significant security incidents as of 1600 local on June 23 
(the 4th day since the ceasefire took effect).  Local 
contacts report Israeli Navy fire toward Palestinian fishing 
boats approaching the GOI's maritime limit line early on June 
20-21, and that the IDF fired warning shots toward 
Palestinians who approached within 500 meters of the 
perimeter fence along the edge of the Gaza Strip.  No 
injuries or damage were reported from these incidents.  No 
rockets or mortars have been fired since the ceasefire took 
effect. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Several prominent Fatah and PA-linked officials 
complain of increased detentions and of harassment by Hamas 
security forces since the ceasefire took effect, including of 
Rafah's Mayor, Ali Barhum (whom Hamas has purported to 
replace with a Hamas loyalist).  He was detained for 
questioning on June 22.  Former Hamas Interior Minister Sa'id 
Siyam announced that Hamas will station forces near Gaza's 
crossings and take actions against "those involved in 
interference with the national interests of the Palestinian 
people." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An estimated 75 truckloads of commercial and 
humanitarian shipments had entered Gaza via the Sufa crossing 
as of 1600 local on June 23; on June 22, sixty-nine trucks 
were transferred.  Nahal Oz fuel transfer station was open 
June 22-23 to meet IDF-restricted imports numbers of 2.2 
million liters/weekly of industrial fuel for the power plant, 
880.000 liters/weekly of diesel fuel, 75,000 liters/weekly of 
gasoline and around 1200 tons/weekly of cooking gas. 
According to the Gaza Fuel Agency, as of June 23 there has 
been no increase in fuel imports since the June 19 agreement. 
 An estimated 60 truckloads of wheat and animal feed entered 
Gaza via the Karni/al-Mintar conveyor belt on June 23.  Kerem 
Shalom crossing and the back-to-back terminals at 
Karni/al-Mintar remain closed as of 1600 local on June 23. 
Rafah Crossing was closed on June 22-23.
