On the Political/Social Front 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  Media Freedoms on the Horizon?  After an eight-year ban, the BBC 
and CNN have been invited back into Zimbabwe.  The BBC has had a 
team in country since July 25 reporting on a variety of issues 
including the inclusive government, rule of law, and land reform. 
Though both press outlets were invited by the Ministry of Media, 
Information and Publicity (MMIP), BBC's activities have been closely 
monitored by State agents.  Additionally, the government may permit 
the production of an independent newspaper as a registration 
application by the producers of the former Daily News --shut down 
since 2003-- was accepted and the MMIP has encouraged the producers 
of the weekly Zimbabwe Independent and The Standard to establish a 
separate daily newspaper.  Journalists and civic groups are highly 
sceptical that the government is truly committed to promoting 
freedom of the press.  See Harare 626. 
 
¶3.  NCA Calls for Halt to Constitutional Process...  Following the 
National Constitutional Assembly's one day "people's constitutional 
convention" in Chitungwiza on July 27, the several thousand NCA 
members present called on government to abandon the ongoing 
Parliament-led constitutional process.  The NCA --a coalition of 
several civic society groups and smaller opposition political 
parties- - intends on shadowing the official constitutional process 
and will hold its own countrywide consultations in the next four 
months before the findings are consolidated into a "peoples" draft 
constitution. 
 
¶4.  Biti Receives Death Threat...  On July 27, Finance Minister 
Tendai Biti (MDC-T) received an envelope containing a 9mm bullet and 
a note advising him to "prepare your will."  Biti has handed the 
evidence over to the police for forensic analysis.  Though shaken 
up, Biti is committed to continuing his efforts to rebuild the 
economy and reform the government's past ruinous fiscal policies. 
See Harare 622. 
 
¶5.  MDC-T MP Arrested for Stealing a Cell Phone...  The Deputy 
Minister of Youth, Tamsanqa Mahlangu of the MDC-T, was arrested on 
July 28 and imprisoned for allegedly stealing a cell phone belonging 
to war veteran leader Joseph Chinotimba two weeks ago.  Mahlangu has 
spent several nights in prison after the attorney general's office 
refused to take him to court; the police have 48 hours in which to 
Qrefused to take him to court; the police have 48 hours in which to 
take an accused person to court.  In an additional twist of 
absurdity, Chinotimba is suing Mahlangu for US$19 million on grounds 
of "loss of business." 
 
¶6.  Anglicans Defy Court Order and Ordain New Bishop...  Chad 
Gandiya was ordained as bishop of the Archdiocese of Harare on July 
26 before a crowd of 4 to 5,000 people that included senior church 
 
HARARE 00000630  002 OF 003 
 
 
officials from the U.S., UK, and the regional body, the Church of 
the Province of Central Africa (CPCA).  Two days earlier, the 
excommunicated ZANU-PF-aligned, ex-bishop Norbert Kunonga won a 
court settlement granting contested church property to his small 
splinter faction; the magistrate also ruled that Kunonga was 
improperly deposed and decreed that the Church could not ordain a 
new bishop.  The CPCA is appealing the ruling. 
 
¶7.  Tribal Chief Evicted for KP Involvement...  The family of the 
tribal chief in Chiadzwa who led members of the Kimberley Process 
team to illegal mining sites was forcibly evicted from its rural 
home on Monday.  A team of police and soldiers arrived at the rural 
home and ransacked it, declaring that Chief Chiadzwa needed to leave 
because he told his villagers to refuse to move and for taking the 
KP team members to unauthorized areas.  His family fled before 
soldiers arrived.  No one was injured. 
 
 
¶8.  MDC to Fill Ambassadorial Slots...  The MDC-T has negotiated the 
right to fill ambassadorial vacancies in Australia, Germany, Nigeria 
and Sudan, while the MDC-M will fill the position of ambassador to 
Senegal.  The appointments will set to rest one of the handful of 
outstanding issues arising from the incomplete and contested 
implementation of last year's Global Political Agreement.

On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Liberalizes Currency and Export 
Controls Further...  In a mid-year monetary policy statement 
presented to bank chief executives on July 30, 2009, the RBZ 
re-introduced currency exchange houses that were suspended during 
the height of foreign currency trading irregularities.  The public 
can now buy and sell foreign exchange in these institutions using 
international rates.  Separately, the reporting threshold for 
documenting exports with the RBZ was raised from US$1,000 to 
US$5,000 to encourage small-scale producers to expand exports by 
reducing bureaucratic hurdles. 
 
¶10.  Zimbabwean Businesses Form Council...  Zimbabwean business 
associations completed the formation of a business council by 
signing the constitution of the new body on July 29, 2009. 
According to the current president of the Council, Kumbirai 
Katsande, the organization will hold an inaugural meeting in Nyanga 
in October 2009 to discuss issues affecting the business sector and 
to identify common positions it can take to government. 
 
¶11.  Government Urged to Set Up a Revolving Fund...  The President 
of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has urged 
government to set up a revolving fund to enable industry to raise 
the capital required to increase capacity utilization to the 60 
percent targeted for year's end.  The industrial body bemoaned the 
lack of credit availability due to the low liquidity of domestic 
financial markets.  The CZI also highlighted short repayment 
periods, power cuts and raw material shortages as constraints on 
Qperiods, power cuts and raw material shortages as constraints on 
industry. 
 
¶12.  Inflation Down, But Downside Risks Remain...  Although the RBZ 
applauded the gains achieved in killing hyperinflation through 
dollarization, it warned that profiteering by traders, poor 
preparation for the 2009/10 agricultural season, intermittent power 
supply and high utility rates threatened to reverse gains.
