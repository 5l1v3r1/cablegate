SUBJECT: COSTA RICA "MORE OR LESS" FAVORS US POSITION ON 
GOLDSTONE REPORT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 112828 
 
¶1. (SBU) Costa Rica is "more or less" in agreement with USG 
views on the Goldstone Report, according to MFA officials. 
The GOCR believes that the international community should 
give Israel's justice system the opportunity to conclude its 
investigations before recommending any further action be 
taken.  However, the GOCR suggested that it would be helpful 
if a separate resolution was presented as an alternative to 
the Arab group proposal.  In their view, this might "take 
note" of the Goldstone Report and state that the General 
Assembly would review the matter again after a certain time 
period. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 3 we met with MFA Human Rights and 
Security Council officers Adriana Murillo and Guisella 
Sanchez to discuss reftel.  Murillo said that in light of its 
broad concerns over international human rights in general, 
the GOCR is very concerned over the events of last winter in 
Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.  However, they believe that 
it is far too early to consider any recommendations stemming 
from the Goldstone Report, and fully agree that Israel's 
justice system must be given time to function.  Furthermore, 
they did not believe that this was an issue for the UNSC to 
take up, as it had already been dealt with by the UNHRC. 
 
¶3. (SBU) However, Murillo said that in their view some sort 
of resolution would be necessary to show that the 
international community is interested in this as a human 
rights issue, and as a sign of support of Palestinian 
Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.  She stated that a number 
of European countries had spoken to them of the possibility 
of a resolution "taking note of the report and then stating 
that the General Assembly would revisit the matter after a 
certain time period," to give the Israeli justice system time 
to continue their investigations.  Murillo asked that we pass 
along any such alternate resolution to the GOCR if and when 
it was available.
