¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  As one of his final official acts, 
Ambassador Riley signed on January 12, "The Bilateral 
Agreement Between The Government of the United States of 
America and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco 
Regarding the Development and Operation of a Seismic 
Monitoring Station in the Kingdom of Morocco."  The agreement 
paves the way for the construction phase of a seismic 
monitoring station in the Midelt region of Morocco's Middle 
Atlas Mountains to be completed in 2010.  This caps several 
years of engagement with the GOM to seek agreement to a 
monitoring station that would supplement the already existing 
NPT monitoring station in Midelt and Morocco's own extensive 
existing seismic monitoring network.  National Center for 
Scientific and Technical Research (CNRST) Director Said 
Belcadi signed for the GOM and talked about how this would be 
another opportunity to expand scientific contacts.  End 
summary.

Ambassador Riley's Final Signing Ceremony 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador Thomas Riley and National Center for 
Scientific and Technical Research (CNRST) Director Said 
Belcadi signed on behalf of their governments on January 12 
"The Bilateral Agreement Between the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of 
Morocco Regarding the Development and Operation of a Seismic 
Monitoring Station in the Kingdom of Morocco." 
Representatives from the Moroccan Ministries of Economy and 
Finance, National Education, Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, 
and Interior; the Forestry Administration; Royal Air Force; 
and Royal Gendarmerie were present for the event at CNRST's 
brand new modernistic headquarters in Rabat.  GOM officials 
requested that no press be present during the signing 
ceremony to avoid questions on the non-proliferation related 
aspects of the program.  This agreement is the culmination of 
the efforts of many individuals (both Moroccan and American) 
who have worked tirelessly on this project since its 
beginning in 2003. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) During the signing ceremony Belcadi expressed his 
desire to see the spirit of U.S./Morocco cooperation in the 
domain of seismology spread to other areas of scientific 
research between CNRST and American universities and research 
centers.  CNRST staff also briefed on Morocco's extensive 
system of seismic monitoring stations, including one financed 
under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

Coming to Agreement 
------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Under the terms of the agreement, the USG through 
the United States Air Force Technical Application Center 
(AFTAC) would provide initial surveys, technical expertise, 
equipment, and maintenance for the seismic station.  The GOM 
would provide the land and USG access to the data collected 
by the station.  A site 25 kilometers north of Midelt was 
chosen.  After extensive initial surveys and agreement in 
principle, the project faced a serious challenge in 2007 when 
it was necessary to secure the 1,500 hectares of land 
required to construct the seismic station.  This land is 
co-owned by the Ministry of Interior and the High Commission 
of Water, Forests and the Fight against Desertification. 
What at first appeared to be a simple administrative solution 
evolved into a sensitive issue as the land under the 
direction of the MOI was actually already leased to various 
local tribes over centuries of time.  Since 2007, GOM 
officials were in negotiations with all involved parties to 
find an amiable solution to lease the required land.  Those 
issues were resolved in December 2008, following a 
political-level demarche at the MFA (Ref D).  The MFA then 
directed the signing of the agreement to finally take place. 
 
---------- 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Now that the bilateral seismic agreement is signed, 
AFTAC can proceed with the procurement of equipment and the 
construction of a seismic station in the Midelt region of 
Morocco's Middle Atlas Mountains, to be completed in 2010. 
Embassy will forward copies of the agreement back to NEA/MAG 
for onward transmittal to ISN, L/T and AFTAC.  Embassy wishes 
to thank these offices and all others who worked on this 
project for helping get it to signature.  We look forward to 
facilitating implementation.
