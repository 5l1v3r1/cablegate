GROWTH 
 
¶1. Summary:  Costa Rica's export sales for the first quarter 
of 2006 are up 22% over the previous year.  The Ministry of 
Foreign Trade (COMEX) attributes the growth to increases in 
sales of pineapples and microprocessors. End Summary. 
 
¶2. Costa Rica's exports for the first quarter of 2006 were 
valued at $1.965 billion versus $1.615 billion during the 
same period of 2005.  According to COMEX the strong growth 
is attributable to a 62% increase in pineapple exports and a 
39% increase in exports of microprocessors manufactured 
almost exclusively by Intel. If Intel exports are excluded, 
first quarter growth in export sales drops from 22% to 18%.
