¶1.  Petrobras has announced that its Santos Basin pre-salt "Iara" 
field holds an estimated recoverable volume of 3-4 billion barrels 
of light oil and natural gas.  Relevant test well data reveals that 
recoverable volume ranges are significantly better than initially 
forecast.  The Iara field is located about 143 miles off the coast 
of Rio de Janeiro at a water depth of 7,316 feet.  It is in the same 
BM-S-11 exploration block as the "Tupi" field, but in a non-adjacent 
area to the north. 
 
¶2.  The Tupi discovery, announced in November 2007, has an estimated 
recoverable volume of 5-8 billion barrels of light oil and natural 
gas.  It is the largest oil find in the Americas since 1976.  If 
confirmed, Iara and Tupi could almost double Brazil's 12.6 billion 
barrels of proven oil reserves.  Petrobras operates the BM-S-11 
block consortium with a 65 percent interest.  Partners are BG Group 
(UK) with 25 percent interest and Galp Energia (Portugal) with 10 
percent interest. 
 
¶3.  Energy analysts believe that Iara announcement is significant 
because the volume is impressive given the relatively small area of 
the field compared to Tupi.  The Iara portion of the block is less 
than a quarter of the size of Tupi.  Also significant is the timing 
of the announcement -- nobody was expecting Petrobras to announce 
new volume estimates before mid-2009. 
 
¶4.  Many experts and government officials commonly talk about the 
potential of the Santos Basin's pre-salt reserve as 30-70 billion 
barrels.  However, Tupi and Iara are the only official estimates for 
Santos Basin pre-salt oil reserves so far which are based on 
drilling results and test data.  Current exploration activities are 
limited to companies who have already executed concession contracts 
in the area since the Government of Brazil has suspended further 
licensing of pre-salt oil rights while it considers regulatory 
changes aimed at capturing more revenue.
