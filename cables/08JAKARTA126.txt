1.(SBU) Summary. Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Aburizal 
Bakrie told the Ambassador on January 21 that a five-member 
delegation planned to visit the Gates Foundation in Seattle on 
February 5 to discuss health concerns and Indonesia's interest in 
expanding access to computers.  Bakrie noted that the Indonesian 
delegation would make presentations to the Foundation's Global 
Health Program on HIV/AIDS and avian influenza and may also discuss 
tuberculosis.  The Ambassador described growing concerns about 
Indonesia's handling of avian influenza, noting that the Foundation 
may be more receptive to other health collaboration.  Bakrie 
expressed interest in joining the delegation if the Foundation could 
change the date. End Summary. 
 
Proposed Visit to Gates Foundation 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Ambassador requested a meeting with Bakrie after 
learning of his proposed February 5 visit to the Gates Foundation 
through a Microsoft contact.  Bakrie told the Ambassador that the 
Indonesia government had exchanged letters with Dr. Tadataka Yamada, 
President of Global Health Program, and planned to send a 
five-member delegation to visit the Foundation on February 5. 
Bakrie explained that Indonesia is seeking programmatic support from 
both Microsoft and the Gates Foundation on computer and health 
concerns. 
 
Increasing Access to Computers 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bakrie hopes that Microsoft can help Indonesia expand 
access to computers in schools and throughout the country. 
Indonesia currently has one computer for every 1,000 people.  With a 
goal of providing one computer for every 20 people, Indonesia will 
seek Microsoft assistance in providing software for one million 
computers.  Bakrie also hopes Microsoft will use its contacts to 
help persuade other information technology companies to provide 
hardware.  The Ambassador noted that Nicholas Negroponte leads One 
Laptop per Child and offered to help make contact. 
 
Health Challenges of AI, HIV/AIDS, and Tuberculosis 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Bakrie described Indonesia's planned presentations to the 
Foundation on both avian influenza and HIV/AIDS.  The Ambassador 
noted that Indonesia and the Gates Foundation could benefit from a 
friendly but frank discussion of health issues. The Ambassador 
cautioned that the Gates Foundation may not be receptive to proposed 
collaboration on AI, noting growing international concerns about 
Indonesia's continued refusal to share samples while its avian 
influenza fatality rate is increasing and cases continue to occur in 
Tangerang, the district adjacent to the international airport. 
Bakrie noted that sample sharing would need to be worked out in 
accordance with Geneva talks and dismissed the severity of the AI 
problem, stating that tuberculosis is really the bigger crisis that 
continues to be ignored.  The Ambassador encouraged Bakrie to raise 
tuberculosis concerns with the Foundation.

the Foundation could change the date.  Current members of the 
delegation include:
