SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN AND VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTERS MEET IN 
LIMA, BUT NO AGREEMENT REACHED 
 
REF: LIMA 415 
 
¶1.  Peruvian Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez hosted an 
hour-long discussion between Colombian FonMin Carolina Barco 
and Venezuelan FonMin Ali Rodriguez on 1/27, aimed at 
advancing a rapprochement between Colombia and Venezuela. 
Barco and Ali Rodriguez were in Lima to attend a meeting 
between Andean FonMins and visiting Chinese Vice President 
Zeng Quinhong (to be reported Septel). 
 
¶2.  The Peruvian Foreign Ministry issued a communique 1/27, 
which stated that, "both Foreign Ministers showed a 
constructive and positive disposition to find a quick and 
mutually satisfactory solution to the problem."  Peruvian 
FonMin Rodriguez said that he would leave it to his Colombian 
and Venezuelan counterparts to discuss the specifics of the 
meeting, adding, "What I can state is my conviction that the 
relations between the two countries will be normalized, 
because that is something that all members of the Andean 
Community will appreciate with great satisfaction." 
 
¶3.  At the conclusion of the meeting both Barco and Ali 
Rodriguez told a waiting press that there would be no/no 
joint communique resulting from the meeting.  Barco added 
that the talks between the two countries are "advancing," and 
characterized the discussion as "very constructive."  "The 
balance is positive," she concluded, "but we have to continue 
forward."  Following a meeting of Andean Foreign Ministers 
earlier that day, Barco had responded to a journalist's 
question by stressing that Colombia would not/not issue an 
apology to Venezuela over the Granda affair. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  Embassy is seeking a fuller readout on the 
Barco-Ali Rodriguez talks from the Foreign Ministry.  END 
COMMENT.
