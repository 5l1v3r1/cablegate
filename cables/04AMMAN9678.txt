¶1. (U) Action requested:  See para 5. 
 
¶2. (U) Polish General Eugeniusz Szczerbak, First Deputy 
Commander in Chief of the Polish Police, toured State/INL,s 
Jordanian-Iraqi Police Training Center (JIPTC) outside Amman 
November 28.  Ten excellent Polish police officers are 
currently serving at JIPTC alongside 241 other international 
and 67 Jordanian police trainers, contributing to a program 
that is a key component of coalition efforts to rebuild Iraq. 
 JIPTC has trained 8,296 Iraqi police recruits to date, and 
graduates approximately 1,500 more every four weeks. 
 
¶3. (SBU) General Szczerbak explained to JIPTC director Kathy 
Friebel that the EU is changing its approach to international 
peacekeeping by combining EU members' resources, and that the 
EU had asked Poland to contribute 100 trainers to a European 
peacekeeping corps.  As a consequence, the General said, 
Poland would ask the U.S. to pay half the cost of keeping the 
ten trainers in Jordan.  He stated that the current cost to 
Poland for the ten officers is USD 100,000 per month for 
salary and "equipment."  The General asked for a U.S. reply 
by December 10, in order to prepare for a budget discussion 
December 22 in the Sejm. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment and action requested:  All the trainers, 
equipment, lodging, meals and transportation are already 
covered by the USG.  We do not know what the GOP,s payroll 
for these ten officers is, but we suspect INL will find an 
additional USD 50,000 monthly outlay unsupportable, 
especially since any increase in payments to the Poles will 
likely prompt similar requests from the other international 
trainers, governments. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post asks that Department consider seeking 
clarification of General Szczerbak,s request, while noting 
JIPTC,s importance to the Iraq effort and our hope that 
Poland continues its valuable contribution under the terms 
already agreed. 
 
¶6. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
