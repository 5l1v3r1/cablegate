REF: 08 STATE 114399

¶1. (U) This is an action request cable.  Please see 
paragraphs 4-5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) BACKGROUND: In previous Southeastern Europe Defense 
Ministerial (SEDM) membership discussions, the U.S. objected 
to Serbian membership in SEDM without a firm commitment by 
the Government of Serbia to not/not block its neighbors from 
membership in the future, particularly Kosovo (reftel), while 
other SEDM member countries have supported Serbia's 
membership.  After careful review, the Department now 
requests that Posts convey to host governments on an urgent 
basis that the U.S. will no longer oppose Serbian membership 
into SEDM, and is ready to join consensus to admit Serbia at 
the October 20-21 ministerial hosted by Bulgaria in Sofia. 
The SEDM Secretariat in Bulgaria will also undertake to 
convey to SEDM member countries that we support Montenegro's 
and Serbia's joining SEDM immediately.  However, we have a 
very short timeframe to inform SEDM members and to confirm 
support for Montenegro and Serbia to join at the next 
ministerial October 20-21. Posts are therefore requested to 
inform appropriate host government officials October 16 if at 
all possible and report back the same day. Department 
apologizes for the deadline, but formally bringing on board 
all members in time for the ministerial requires immediate 
action.  Serbian integration into regional organizations will 
reinforce gains made toward creating a stable and peaceful 
Western Balkans; we also want to recognize progress by Serbia 
in defense reform, and encourage further concrete steps. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Both Montenegro and Serbia applied to join SEDM in 
¶2008.  Italy and Romania strongly objected to Montenegrin 
admission into SEDM without Serbia.  U.S. policy on 
Montenegrin membership in SEDM remains the same: We strongly 
believe that Montenegro should be admitted to SEDM 
immediately.  Despite Romanian and Italian efforts to link 
the two, Montenegro has met the requirements for membership 
and its participation in SEDM should not be tied to Serbia. 
Serbia has recently reaffirmed its desire to participate in 
SEDM.  As part of our efforts to reiterate our unwavering 
support for Kosovo, the U.S. delegation to SEDM will press 
for robust "open door" language in the joint communiqu.  We 
will also assure the Kosovo government of our steadfast 
commitment to Kosovo's integration into regional and 
international structures.  Separately, we will hold a 
dialogue with the Serbian government on our expectations for 
their participation in SEDM. 
 
¶4. (U) ACTION ALL 12 SEDM MEMBER COUNTRY POSTS:  Department 
requests that posts deliver the following points on October 
16 and report back the same day: 
 
-- The inclusion of Serbia into SEDM would help moderate 
Serbian policy over time.  Increased regional participation 
would continue to move Serbia on a positive trajectory with 
its neighbors in the region. 
 
-- The U.S. has advocated for an open door policy for SEDM. 
Increased regional participation in SEDM and in Euro-Atlantic 
institutions will continue the positive momentum and 
stability witnessed over the past few years.  Continued 
strong regional growth and stability will be less likely 
without the involvement of Serbia. 
 
-- U.S. agreement to join consensus on Serbian membership 
should result in the lifting of any objections to 
Montenegro's SEDM membership request.  The U.S. believes 
Montenegro has met all requirements for SEDM membership and 
we strongly support Montenegro's inclusion along with Serbia. 
 
-- The U.S. will continue to track closely Serbian government 
actions and statements to verify that Serbia intends to be a 
 
STATE 00107044  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
constructive actor in the region. 
 
-- The U.S. strongly supports Kosovo's inclusion in SEDM and 
other regional political-military institutions, when ready. 
The U.S. Government's support for Kosovo and its integration 
into regional and international organizations is unwavering. 
 
¶5. (U) In addition to drawing from paragraph 4 points, 
Embassies Pristina and Tirana are requested to convey the 
following post-specific points: 
 
Pristina specific points: 
 
--  The U.S. fully supports Kosovo's continuing and future 
participation in regional organizations, including the 
participation of security institutions such as the  Kosovo 
Security Force (KSF) when ready. 
 
-- The U.S. will continue to stress to Serbia the importance 
of constructive engagement in regional organizations, and we 
will link Serbia's behavior in this regard to the Serbian 
government's other Euro-Atlantic objectives. 
 
Tirana specific points: 
 
-- The GOA's participation in regional consensus building is 
important.  We believe Serbia's SEDM membership is consistent 
with our goal of promoting its integration into Euro-Atlantic 
institutions, which we believe will further moderate Serbia's 
actions. We urge the GOA to join us in support. 
 
¶6.  (U) Please report responses the same day.  Posts may 
contact EUR/SCE Croatia/Regional Pol-Mil Desk Officer Cathy 
Westley at (westleyc@state.gov, 202-647-4987) with questions. 
 
¶7. (U) Department appreciates posts' support in advancing 
this important issue under such a tight deadline.
