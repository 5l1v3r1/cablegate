¶1.  SUMMARY:  On April 21, Poloff met with Europe and Americas 
Director P. P. Makosholo at Lesotho's Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to deliver demarches on Lesotho's ascension to the Hague 
Code of Conduct Against Missile Proliferation (HCOC, Ref A), the 
U.S.-EU sponsored UN Prisoners on Conscience declaration (Ref 
B), and the implementation of recent UN Security Council 
Resolutions regarding Iran (Refs C and D).  Makosholo promised 
to again follow up with the MFA's legal office on the 
longstanding HCOC issue, and noted that the Prisoners of 
Conscience declaration appears uncontroversial.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------- 
Hague Code of Conduct, Again 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On April 21, Poloff met with Europe and Americas Director 
P.P. Makosholo at Lesotho's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Poloff 
delivered Ref A demarche on Lesotho's ascension to the Hague 
Code of Conduct Against Missile Proliferation (HCOC), noting our 
longstanding dialogue on the issue with the MFA, including at 
the ministerial level, since 2002.  Makosholo noted that he had 
not yet studied a May 10 dipnote on the issue.  He stated that 
he would follow up on the matter with the MFA's legal office, 
and would alert Minister Tsekoa to the issue. 
 
----------------------------------- 
U.S.-EU Prisoners of Conscience 
Declaration "Seems Uncontroversial" 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Regarding the U.S.-EU sponsored UN Prisoners on Conscience 
declaration (Ref B), Makosholo inquired about when the issue 
would come to a vote and whether it would take place in New York 
or Geneva.  He said that the declaration appeared 
straightforward and non-controversial as it does not name 
specific prisoners or their captor nations; however, he noted 
that the MFA would examine the full text of the document before 
pledging GOL support. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Lesotho's MFA Not Focused on Iran 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Regarding Ref C demarche on nuclear technology export 
prohibitions on Iran, Makosholo commented that as Lesotho is not 
an exporter of dual use technology or equipment, the MFA has not 
focused on the issue of UNSCR 1803 implementation.  He stated 
that if such issues arise, however, the MFA would consult with 
the U.S. Embassy.  Regarding Ref D demarche on implementing the 
travel bans outlined in UNSCR 1737, 1747, and 1803, Makosholo 
said that the U.S. government should forward the list of 
designated individuals to the GOL for consideration.  He noted 
that the MFA typically handles such matters by alerting the 
Ministry of Home Affairs as well as its own consular officials 
about individuals of concern (there is no formal clearance 
system).  He noted that visitors from the Middle East are "rare." 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Post Will Return to HCOC Issue at Higher Level 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5.  COMMENT:  There seems to be no genuine opposition to 
Lesotho's HCOC ascension, only bureaucratic inertia.  Regarding 
the "Prisoners of Conscience" declaration, Lesotho will likely 
defer to the judgment of their regional peers in the United 
Nations.  Regarding implementation of Iran-related UNSCR 
resolutions, Lesotho's MFA seems to feel that as Lesotho does 
not produce or export dual-use equipment, it need not focus on 
these complex issues.  END COMMENT.
