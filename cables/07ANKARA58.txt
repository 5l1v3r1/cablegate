¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY: Turkey seeks to coordinate with the U.S. and the 
EU as it composes its strategy for its BSEC chairmanship starting in 
May 2007.  Its priority areas are trade and development, 
transportation, energy security and safety, organized crime, and 
environment.  Turkey asks that the U.S. flesh out its proposal for a 
workshop on environment enforcement in a written product.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In a January 8 meeting, MFA DDG Ahmet Asim Arar said 
Turkey is formulating a strategy paper in advance of its six-month 
BSEC chairmanship commencing in May.  He said Turkey wants to 
harmonize its strategies with the EU and the U.S. and noted that the 
European Commission is also formulating a Black Sea strategy that it 
aims to roll it out at the June EU Summit.  By coincidence, BSEC's 
Istanbul Summit will occur 2-3 days later, offering an opportunity 
to build on the EU approach.  Arar hoped that the U.S. too could 
make a contribution that fits into Turkey's Chairmanship. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Arar expressed support for the U.S. idea of BSEC hosting 
a workshop on environmental enforcement best practices (refs), 
suggesting that the U.S flesh it out as a written concrete proposal 
for presentation to the PERMIS.  He suggested that the U.S. consider 
making the submission in advance of the next meeting of the 
environmental protection working group, which will be held March 
14-15 in Istanbul (chaired by Turkey).  Arar also noted that there 
should eventually be consultation with the Black Sea Commission.  He 
said BSEC had a seed project feasibility fund that can fund up to 
$15,000 to help start projects.  He admitted that observers have not 
yet played such an active role in BSEC, but he welcomed the U.S. 
setting a precedent for a more dynamic observer-hip. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Arar said Turkey would also welcome U.S. ideas for 
projects in trade and transportation.  He described Turkey's current 
Black Sea trade facilitation project, which is being implemented in 
cooperation with the UNDP.  The project envisions carrying out 
market and company product surveys, followed by a buyer-seller 
matchmaking forum.
