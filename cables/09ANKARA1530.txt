REF: STATE 108570 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On October 22 we spoke with Rami Sayliman at the 
Turkish MFA try of Foreign Affairs concerning Turkish 
participation in the G-8 Broader Middle East and North Africa 
(BMENA) Forum for the Future on November 2-3 in Marrakech 
(REFTEL).  Sayliman told us the MFA has not yet determined 
who to send to the forum, but that he would relay immediately 
to the Minister's office that Secretary Clinton will 
participate.  He said it is unlikely that FM Davutoglu will 
attend himself since he is scheduled to be in Malaysia during 
that time period.  In our view, Deputy Under Secretary 
Soysal, whose portfolio includes the Middle East, will 
probably participate in the forum given Turkey's keen 
interest in Middle Eastern and North African affairs.
