Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Bank of Mexico and likely incoming Mexican 
government officials in recent weeks have stressed the 
importance of opening key sectors of the economy to more 
competition, but have been hesitant to publicly name the 
"offending" companies.  This telegram spells out which 
sectors are dominated by only a few powerful firms, who is 
in charge of these companies, and how much of the market 
the companies control.  End Summary.

Summit Participants Highlight Need for Competition 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. (SBU) At the Monterrey Business Summit on October 30, 
2006, Bank of Mexico (BOM) Governor Guillermo Ortiz and 
other participants (business representatives, academics, 
President-elect Felipe Calderon transition team members, 
etc.) underscored the importance of more competition in key 
sectors such as telecommunications, transportation, 
construction, and financial services.  Ortiz stressed that 
macroeconomic and financial stability is an important 
"theme" in the Mexican economy, one that has been largely 
achieved.  He said that another key theme is competition. 
He emphasized the importance of focusing on monopolies and 
how they hinder economic growth and competition by keeping 
prices high.  Professor and political commentator Denise 
Dresser made similar points at the Summit the day before, 
and received applause for her comments.  Numerous 
participants focused on the need to challenge monopolies 
and the excessive costs they produce.  That said, no one at 
the Business Summit would name specific companies or people 
(Carlos Slim, etc.).  When pressed by a questioner to name 
a Mexican company that needs to open up to competition, 
Mexican Institute for Competitiveness head Roberto Newell 
would only name Coca Cola and Wal-Mart, to the nervous 
laughter of the audience. 
 
¶3. (SBU) To facilitate USG understanding of what analysts 
are referring to when they talk about Mexican industries 
and sectors where competition is absent or severely 
restricted, Post is providing the following list

Comment 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) For some time now, Bank of Mexico Governor Ortiz 
has been a key voice in calling for the elimination of 
monopolies.  He is a key spokesperson on this issue because 
of his high profile and because he is not directly 
connected with vested interest groups -- unlike some 
members of the GOM Executive branch.  Mexico has made 
notable progress in promoting competition over the past 
year (e.g. passage of a competition law), but it has a long 
way to go.  Making further headway in this area will 
require significant political will, as it entails incoming 
government officials taking on powerful unions and, in some 
cases, the people who financed their campaigns.  End 
Comment.
