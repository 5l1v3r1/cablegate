¶1. (U) Poloff met with three small groups of Iranians in 
front of the U.S. Embassy in Brussels on July 28, 29 and 31. 
Members of each group had immediate family inside Camp Ashraf 
and left Poloff with literature, which has been sent to the 
NEA/I desk.  Their requests were for the U.S. to intervene 
and stop the Iraqis bulldozing the camp, committing human 
rights abuses and relocating the residents.   On July 31, 
approximately 25 Iranians peacefully demonstrated across the 
street from the Embassy from 12-2pm.  Similar demonstrations 
are expected on August 1 and 3.
