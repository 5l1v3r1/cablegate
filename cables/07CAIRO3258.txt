¶1. (U) Per ref A instructions, we providethe below input for the 
interim Trafficking-in-Pesons (TIP) assessment for Egypt.  We note 
that te GOE inter-ministeial "National Committee to Comat and 
Prevent Trafficking in Persons" had its frst meeting in October 
2007, representing a longawaited step to increase official GOE 
efforts aganst trafficking.  The inter-ministerial committee s 
working on three tracks: implementing already xistent anti-TIP 
provisions; legislating new ant-TIP laws; and increasing public 
awareness of th nature and importance of TIP (ref B). 
Additionaly, Egypt and the UAE are currently drafting the Arb 
League's anti-TIP action plan, which would the be incumbent upon 
member states to implement. 
Increasing Criminal Investigations and Prosecutios 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The inter-ministerial committee ha identified increasing 
investigations and prosections under existing law as one of its 
main task.  The GOE already prosecutes some cases of indiviuals 
who force children into prostitution or beggng.  Over the past few 
months, there have been icreasing reports of GOE authorities 
arresting smgglers who arrange for Egyptians to illegally travl to 
Europe to work.  The GOE has also long beenfocused on Bedouin 
smugglers in the Sinai and is ndertaking a comprehensive assessment 
of trafficing networks in the Sinai. 
 
Identifying Victims nd Providing Protection Services 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) lthough not specifically geared towards trafficking 
victims, quasi-governmental organizations such as the National 
Center for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM) and the National Center 
for Women (NCW) are bolstering their network of services to abused 
street children and women (ref D).  USAID is supporting these 
efforts in a five-year activity to combat violence against women and 
children that is likely to incorporate anti-TIP priorities.  A major 
component of the project will be to strengthen and expand services 
extended to street children, including the upgrading of reception 
houses. 
 
Enacting Anti-Trafficking Legislation 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The NCCM has drafted a new child protection law that 
specifically addresses TIP in regards to children, to be introduced 
in the current session of parliament (ref B).  The law delineates a 
penalty of at least five years in prison and a fine of at least LE 
50,000 (USD 8,990) for any persons who "present for purchasing, 
receive, or deliver a child in order to be treated as a slave or 
with the intention of usage in unlawful commercial or sexual 
exploitation or any other illegitimate purposes."  Additionally, 
those in violation of child labor laws are subject to fines 
beginning at LE 200 (USD 36), doubling for each violation, and any 
who "endanger the life of a child," which includes exposing a child 
to "abuse, violence, exploitation, or displacement," incurs a 
sentence of at least three months in prison.  The new law increases 
the minimum age of marriage for girls from 16 to 18. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Ministry of Justice is also working on new, 
comprehensive anti-TIP legislation.  This is the first indication we 
have of official GOE support for the idea that a comprehensive 
anti-TIP law is necessary for Egypt. 
 
Instituting a Public Awareness Campaign 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In early July, state-owned Egyptian television began airing 
UN-produced public service announcements on labor trafficking during 
prime-time broadcasts.  Media monitoring indicated that the spots 
were aired throughout the day, most notably before and after evening 
news programs, serials, and popular prime-time talk shows (ref C). 
The inter-ministerial committee has focused on increasing public 
awareness as one of its main tasks.
