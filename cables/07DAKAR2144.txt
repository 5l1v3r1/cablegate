¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In receiving Senegal's FY08 MCC Scorecard, 
Presidential Advisor Aminata Niane criticized the MCC's lack of 
clarifying information in the annual indicators and the lack of 
flexibility by the MCC to help Senegal, an "important partner," 
achieve a compact.  Minister Niane was not being forthright in 
placing all the blame on the MCC for the decision to not pursue a 
compact to fund Dakar's Toll road project.  Niane did not have any 
new ideas for a possible compact proposal.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Per Ref A request, on October 30, Charge presented Senegal's 
2008 MCC scorecard to Aminata Niane, Minister without Portfolio and 
Special Advisor to the President.  Ms. Niane is also the Director 
General of APIX, Senegal's Investment Promotion Agency.  Charge 
highlighted that Senegal has sufficient passing grades on the 
indicators, but that the final determination of eligibility will 
rest with the MCC Board. 
 
SENEGAL WANTS MCC TO BE FLEXIBLE 
-------------------------------- 
¶3.  (U) While Minister Niane was pleased to have received an advance 
copy of Senegal's scorecard and expressed satisfaction that Senegal 
had somewhat improved its indicators since 2007, she was quick to 
launch into a criticism of MCC's "lack of flexibility" with both the 
indicators and in reaching compact agreements. 
 
¶4.  (U) On the indicators, Niane insisted that the MCC should 
provide footnotes or other indications when a country has improved 
on an indicator after the reporting period.  [Note: Over the past 
couple of months, APIX has succeeded in greatly reducing the number 
of days it takes to register a business in Senegal, and it is likely 
that the country will move from a failing to a passing grade for the 
"Business Start-Up" indicator in the FY09 Scorecard.  End note.] 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Regarding the GOS's efforts to conclude a compact 
proposal, Niane heaped blame on the MCC for the failure to conclude 
an agreement on funding of Dakar's toll road (Ref B), and asserted 
that MCC should make special "considerations" on its due diligence 
requirements for "an important partner such as Senegal."  Naine also 
charged that MCC "does not communicate well." 
 
¶6.  (U) Charge reminded Minister Niane that the compact proposal for 
the Diamniadio Platform fell through because the GOS signed a 
competing agreement with Dubai's Jafza Ltd. without consulting the 
MCC, and that the MCC had maintained a dialog on the Toll Road for 
more than one year.  Charge added that the toll road deal fell 
through because the GOS decided it could not be flexible in the 
timing of its procedures for a private concessionaire, and in doing 
so established its apparent preference for USD 30-40 million in 
loans from the World Bank and the French Development Agency (AFD) 
rather than potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in MCC grant 
assistance. 
 
THE NEXT PROPOSAL 
----------------- 
¶7.  (U) Charge confirmed the willingness of the MCC and the Embassy 
to consult with Senegal on future compact proposals.  Niane asserted 
that Senegal has already provided the MCC with a "complete" proposal 
for a power plant that should require no additional study.  The 
Charge reminded Niane that both the former Ambassador and the MCC 
have underscored that a compact in the power sector is highly 
problematic in part because significant additional feasibility and 
impact studies would need to be conducted. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶8.  (SBU) Minister Niane is among the most knowledgeable senior GOS 
officials regarding MCC's efforts in Senegal.  Like everybody 
involved, she is frustrated that Senegal has not yet concluded a 
compact.  She is, however, being insincere in arguing that all the 
blame rests with the MCC, which, in our view has been transparent 
and forthright in its dealings with Senegal, as well as with the 
World Bank and AFD.  The lack of a compact with Senegal is, for the 
most part, due to the GOS's unwillingness to accept MCC terms and 
requirements for transparency and due diligence.  Niane, who is now 
one of President Wade's closest economic advisors, and is also 
reportedly allied to the political-economic forces led by Karim Wade 
and "The Generation of Concrete" (that is, the future leadership to 
the ruling PDS party), will apparently maintain the line that 
Senegal deserves special treatment.
