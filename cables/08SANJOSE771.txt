SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
CONDUCTED ON LICENSE 050112184 
 
REF: STATE 96188 
 
¶1. Per reftel request, on September 24, we met with Pablo 
Murillo, the owner of Electromecanica Pablo Murillo, and 
established the bona fides of the company.  We also met with 
his business partner, Oldemar Echandi.  As a result of this 
post-shipment check, we consider Electromecanica a legitimate 
recipient of United States Munitions List (USML) items. 
Murillo told us he was familiar with the regulations 
governing the import of U.S.-origin defense articles as well 
as the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 
regarding restrictions on re-transfer or re-export. 
 
¶2. Electromecanica Pablo Murillo, located in San Jose, has 
been in business since 2004 importing and selling defense 
articles.  The store is located above a veterinary clinic 
owned by Echandi's father.  There is no sign indicating that 
the gunshop is located there so all customers are referred by 
word of mouth or local knowledge. 
 
¶3. The gunshop maintains all proper paperwork on its 
customers and is in compliance with regulations of the Arms 
and Explosives section of the GOCR's Ministry of Public 
Security.  All types of firearms are sold, including 
shotguns, rifles, and pistols.  The 9mm pistol is the most 
sold firearm.  In addition, Electromecanica sells a large 
variety of weapons accessories including munitions, clips, 
uniforms, flashlights, etc.  They are official distributors 
of Sig Sauer and Smith & Wesson firearms in Costa Rica. 
 
¶4. Electromecanica's primary customers are private security 
companies, other gunshops, or elements of the GOCR itself. 
These customers represent approximately 60 percent of their 
sales.  The remaining 40 percent of sales are to private 
individuals.  All are Costa Rican. 
 
¶5. We assess the security of the premises as adequate and 
similar to other gunshops that we have visited in Costa Rica. 
 They have a camera and alarm system that we verified is 
monitored by a private security company.  Murillo told us 
they have never been robbed since they started business. 
(NOTE: Although located in a high-crime part of downtown San 
Jose, due to their location above a veterinary clinic, it is 
unlikely that many passersby would know of its existence. 
END NOTE.)  They have two wardrobe-type storage vaults and 
one small, but wide vault located on the premises.  Echandi 
told us they have another secure arms storage vault located 
off the premises.  We did not visit that site.

COMMENT 
======= 
 
¶6. Both Murillo and Echandi seemed very well informed of the 
firearms business and clearly wanted to cooperate with us. 
They are aware of problems that other gunshops in Costa Rica 
have had with U.S. licenses, particularly Armeria Rex (a 
gunshop that has been found to be an unreliable user of USML 
in the past), which they emphasized had no dealings with 
them.  Though some of their paperwork and customer tracking 
system seem inefficient, they are complete and in order.  Of 
note, the post-shipment check was on 18 Sig Pistols that have 
not yet arrived because they are still in production in the 
U.S.
