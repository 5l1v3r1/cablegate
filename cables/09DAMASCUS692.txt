¶2. (S/NF) Over the past six months, civil society and human
rights activists questioned by SARG security have told us
interrogators asked specifically about their connections to
the U.S. Embassy and the State Department. XXXXXXXXXXXX was
questioned about MEPI-funded Democracy Council activities as

¶8. (S/NF) Comment: It is unclear to what extent SARG
intelligence services understand how USG money enters Syria
and through which proxy organizations. What is clear,
however, is that security agents are increasingly focused on
this issue when they interrogate human rights and civil
society activists. The information agents are able to frame
their questions with more and more specific information and
names. XXXXXXXXXXXX suggest the SARG has keyed in on MEPI
operations in particular.
¶9. (C) Comment continued: XXXXXXXXXXXX Except for the
Netherlands’ public stalling of the EU Association Agreement
over human rights, Syrian activists have heard little in the
way of support from the international community.
XXXXXXXXXXXX End Comment.
