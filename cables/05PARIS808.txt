statement and response to questions follows. 
 
¶2.  BEGIN TEXT: 
 
--  I recall to you the spokesman's declaration of February 
6, 2005: 
 
(Repeats February 6 communique reported reftel para 3.) 
 
--  France expresses its concern regarding the modifications 
which are moving away from the institutional process laid out 
in the Togolese Constitution. 
 
--  France recalls in particular the importance of the rapid 
organization of free and democratic elections to set a term 
for an open transition caused by the disappearance of 
President Eyadema, and to give legitimacy to the institutions. 
 
--  A mission of ECOWAS, led by Mrs. Mindaoudou, the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs of Niger, in the name of the ECOWAS 
presidency, and Mr. Ibn Chambas, Secretary-General of ECOWAS, 
will today hold meetings in Lome. 
 
--  France will take great account of the results of this 
mission, in close consultation with the African Union, the 
countries of the region, and its partners in the 
international community. 
 
QUESTION:  What is your reaction to the modification of the 
constitution in Togo, which allows the son to succeed the 
father, without an electoral process?  Does France have the 
intention of suspending aid as a way of applying pressure? 
 
ANSWER:  I refer you to my declaration of today. 
 
QUESTION:  What does France think of the sleight of hand 
which has given the appearance of legality to the nomination 
of the son? 
 
ANSWER:  I refer you to my declaration of today.
