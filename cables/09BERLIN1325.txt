SUBJECT: GERMAN GOVERNMENT TRANSITION LIKELY TO FORECLOSE 
HIGH-LEVEL PARTICIPATION AT FORUM FOR THE FUTURE 
 
REF: STATE 108570 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) MFA Deputy Head of Union for the Mediterranean and 
BMENA Andreas Berg told Poloff October 21 that it is unlikely 
that a high-level government official will be able to attend 
the November 2-3 Forum for the Future since the new German 
government will likely only have just been sworn the week 
before.  It would be very difficult, therefore, for the new 
foreign minister to be able to attend.  In addition, new 
State Ministers in the MFA will likely not yet be in place in 
time to allow for preparations for official travel.  He did 
not rule out such participation, however.  Berg expects that 
the more likely scenario is for Germany's Ambassador to 
Morocco to attend.
