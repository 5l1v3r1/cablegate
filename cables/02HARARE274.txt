¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "EARLY ARRIVAL OF OBSERVERS COULD END 
    LOSS OF MORE LIVES," THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" 
    DEDICATED ITS JANUARY 28 EDITORIAL TO CALL ON THE 
    GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS TO COME INTO 
    THE COUNTRY AT LEAST A MONTH BEFORE THE MARCH 9 AND 10 
    PRESIDENTIAL POLL.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED ITSELF AGAINST VIOLENCE 
    AND 
    COMMITTED ITSELF TO ALLOWING INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS 
    DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  HOWEVER, IF IT IS 
    SINCERE, IT SHOULD INVITE THESE OBSERVERS AT LEAST A 
    MONTH BEFORE THE 9 AND 10 MARCH VOTING DAYS FOR THEM TO 
    MAKE AN INFORMED OPINION OF THE POLL AND TO UNDERSTAND 
    THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WILL BE TAKING PLACE.  AN EARLY 
    ARRIVAL OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS WILL EITHER SEE A 
    SUDDEN DE-ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, LARGELY BY THE RULING 
    PARTY SUPPORTERS AND MILITIAS, OR IF THIS DOES NOT 
    HAPPEN, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL THEN HAVE A 
    BALANCED APPRECIATION OF WHAT WILL HAVE DETERMINED THE 
    OUTCOME OF THE VOTE. . .IF THE GOVERNMENT IS GENUINELY 
    COMMITTED TO ALLOWING INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, AND IF 
    IT IS NOT BEHIND THE CURRENT WAVE OF VIOLENCE, THEN IT 
    SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS IN INVITING THEM TO COME INTO 
    THE COUNTRY MUCH EARLIER SO THEY CAN SEE WHAT IS REALLY 
    HAPPENING.  AND IF IT IS ASSURED OF WINNING, THE MORE 
    REASON IT SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT ITS VICTORY NOT 
    BEING TAINTED BY CHARGES OF INTIMIDATION, VIOLENCE AND 
    FRAUD. . .IT IS ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT THE OBSERVERS DO 
    NOT FLY OUT OF THE COUNTRY IMMEDIATELY THE RESULTS OF 
    THE ELECTION ARE ANNOUNCED.  PAST EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN 
    THE INTENSITY OF VIOLENCE THAT FOLLOWS AN ELECTION 
    RESULT.  INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS SHOULD BE

PAGE 03        HARARE  00274  301319Z 
    HERE AT LEAST FOR TWO MONTHS - ONE MONTH BEFORE, AND 
    ANOTHER AFTER THE RESULTS.  THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT 
    WILL SAVE THE LOSS OF MORE LIVES."
