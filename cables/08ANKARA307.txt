REF: SECSTATE 16265 
 
¶1.  (U) At approximately 19:30 local time, February 18, the 
GOT formally recognized Kosovo's independence.  FM Babacan's 
statement (see paragraph 4) emphasized the importance Turkey 
attaches to peace and stability in the Balkans.  The 
statement also noted Turkey's historical and cultural ties to 
Kosovo and pledged Turkey's continued assistance to Kosovo's 
development.  PM Erdogan reportedly called Kosovo PM Taci to 
congratulate him.  According to the Turkish press, Turkey 
will carry out relations with Kosovo through its Pristina 
Coordination Office and its Embassy in Tirana, and Turkey 
will consider opening an Embassy in Pristina. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Anticipating a rough patch in Ankara-Belgrade 
relations, FM Babacan underscored the importance Turkey 
attaches to improving its bilateral and regional relations 
with Serbia.  In response to Turkey's announcement, Serbia 
has ordered its Ambassador to Turkey to return to Belgrade 
for "consultation until further notice."  According to MFA 
contacts, the Serbian Ambassador will meet with FM Babacan 
February 19, where he is expected announce his departure. 
"Vatan" daily newspaper reported that stones were hurled at 
the Turkish Embassy in Belgrade, and that Turkey has 
submitted two separate notes to the Serbian Foreign Ministry 
demanding tighter security measures. 
 
¶3.  (U) Turkish media reaction is divided on Kosovo 
independence and on Turkey's swift recognition.  Mainstream 
"Sabah" carried a cartoon on its front-page entitled "Double 
Standard," lampooning Europe's recognition of Kosovo but not 
of the "TRNC" (northern Cyprus).  Other columnists cautioned 
against Turkey trying to link Kosovo to Cyprus, noting that 
such a precedent could create headaches for Turkey in 
northern Iraq.  Cengiz Candar, in the business daily 
"Referans," celebrated Kosovo independence, expressing the 
joy he believes will be felt by the millions of Turkish 
citizens of Kosovo-origin.  However, liberal "Radikal" and 
Islamist, pro-government "Yeni Safak" expressed apprehension 
at the deep divisions emerging between countries that 
recognize Kosovo's independence and those that oppose it. 
They warned that the new state will be entirely dependent on 
the United States, triggering a new Cold War with Russia, and 
igniting clashes in the Caucasus.

Kosovo's independence (as received).

18 February 2008 
 
STATEMENT OF H.E.MR. ALI BABACAN, 
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY, 
REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF KOSOVO BY TURKEY 
 
            The Assembly of Kosovo declared independence of 
Kosovo on 17 February 2008. In this context, an appeal was 
made to all countries of the world for the recognition of the 
Republic of Kosovo. 
 
            The Republic of Turkey has welcomed the content 
and elements of the Declaration of Independence, and with 
this understanding, has decided to recognize the independence 
of the Republic of Kosovo. 
 
            Securing peace and stability in the Balkans is 
one of Turkey's foreign policy priorities. Turkey attaches 
importance to advance the understanding of lasting peace in 
the Balkans which has suffered immensely in recent years and 
hopes that the independence of Kosovo will present an 
opportunity for the enhancement of stability and confidence 
among the countries in the region. 
 
            Serbia has a significant role and responsibility 
in the future of the Balkans. Turkey attaches importance to 
improving its relations and cooperation with Serbia, both at 
bilateral and regional levels. 
 
            Turkey believes that rule of law and the 
universal values of human rights, democracy and pluralism 
should be promoted in Kosovo. Turkey is also of the opinion 
that creating an atmosphere of mutual confidence and 
cooperation between Kosovo and her neighbours is essential. 
 
            Turkey believes that its long-established 
historical, cultural and human ties with Kosovo will be 
further strengthened. Turkey will continue its assistance and 
contributions for the development of Kosovo.
