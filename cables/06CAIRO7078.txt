SUBJECT: ARAB LEAGUE FOREIGN MINISTERS CALL FOR DISMANTLING 
MILITIAS IN IRAQ; ZEBARI URGES SUPPORT OF IRAQI SHIA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Arab League foreign ministers, meeting in 
Cairo on December 5, deplored the deteriorating security 
situation in Iraq, and called for the immediate dismantling 
of sectarian militias.  Mubarak expressed support for Iraq, 
and welcomed Talabani's visit on December 12.  Iraqi foreign 
minister Zebari says he is "satisfied" with the outcome of 
the AL meeting, and urges support for Iraqi Shia.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 5, Arab League foreign ministers from 
the AL's "Iraq Committee" (Jordan, UAE, Bahrain, Algeria, 
Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Egypt) met in Cairo 
to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Iraq and 
the need for immediate steps to foster national 
reconciliation there.  AL Secretary General Amre Moussa and 
Iraq Committee chairman Shaykh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa 
(Bahrain's foreign minister) said the ministers had agreed to 
a timetable for rebuilding Iraq's police and army prior to 
the withdrawal of coalition forces.  In a press statement 
issued after their meeting, the foreign ministers condemned 
"terrorist and criminal acts" in Iraq, and called for the 
immediate dismantling of all militias in Iraq, and for the 
preservation Iraq's unity and identity.  The statement said 
that the next AL conference on Iraq should be held in Baghdad 
within four months. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a telephone conversation on December 5, Iraqi 
foreign minister Zebari told the Ambassador that he had met 
earlier that day with President Mubarak.  Zebari said he told 
Mubarak he had come "to correct relations" and urged support 
for Iraqi Shia to "feel part of the Arab nation."  He said 
that Mubarak was supportive, and that he looked forward to 
welcoming Iraqi president Jalal Talabani when he visits Cairo 
on December 12.  Mubarak also told Zebari that Iraqi Prime 
Minister Maliki would be welcome "any time." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Zebari described the meeting of the Arab League 
foreign ministers as "the usual long debates" conducted with 
"intense interest."  He said he was very satisfied with the 
final statement which called for supporting the Iraqi 
government and the unity and integrity of Iraq, while 
condemning terrorism and "takfirism" (declaring someone to be 
an infidel).  Zebari said he had parried AL calls for a 
timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, urging instead a 
timetable for strengthening Iraqi security forces.  He said 
that he stressed the need for the AL to accept and support 
Iraqi Shia, reassuring that their primary allegiance was to 
Iraq and not Iran.  He said the ministers were apprehensive 
about the Baker report, but he underscored for them that 
President Bush will make the final decision and would not 
withdraw U.S. forces prematurely.  (Note:  Zebari departed 
 Cairo early December 6 for Saudi Arabia.  End note.)
