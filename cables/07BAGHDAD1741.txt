SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: U.S. WEAPON RELEASE TO IRAQ 
 
 
¶1. This is an action request. Please see para 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Country Team requests the full release 
of U.S Generation III AN/PVS-7 Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) to 
the Government of Iraq for use by the Iraqi Army to enable 
improved counterterrorism operations and reduction of 
potential night collateral damage and fratricide.  They will 
enable the Iraqi Army to own the night.  These goggles will 
be procured through Foreign Military Sales at Iraqi expense 
at an estimated cost of $6 million.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Description of Technology for Release 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. The Night Vison Devices to be supplied to the GOI will be 
limited to 1250 Figure of Merit (FOM) capability. 
 
 
Rationale for Technology Release 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) U.S. forces currently serve as advisors to the Iraqi 
Army (IA) participating in operation execution and 
maintaining sensitive equipment.  To successfully transition 
security responsibilities to the GoI, Iraqi army must be able 
to independently own and operate necessary counterterrorism 
equipment including U.S Generation III AN/PVS-7 Night Vision 
Goggles.  These vision systems are crucial for successful 
operations against anti-Iraqi forces at night.  They 
significantly improve precision targeting, advance 
self-defense, allow safe night operation of wheeled and 
tracked vehicles in urban and open terrain and reduce the 
risks of collateral damage and fratricide  Without them Iraqi 
forces limited visibility operations would be severely 
degraded. 
 
Iraq Safeguarding Sensitive Technology 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Iraq has demonstrated the intent and ability to 
protect sensitive, classified military technology since 
working with U.S. and Coalition forces.  An Article 505 
agreement (signed by the GOI July 24, 2004) demonstrates 
Iraq's commitment to protect grant defense articles and 
technology similar to our standards.  Additionally, a 
Memorandum of Agreement for Compliance for the Storage, 
Security and Inventory of Night Vision Devices was signed by 
the Iraqi MOD, 18 November 2005.  We will continue to mentor 
the GOI on their protection of sensitive USG technology in 
order to provide long-term cooperation with Iraq.  We also 
will obtain all necessary formal agreements with the GOI 
before transferring any sensitive equipment or technology. 
Lastly, we will continue to carry out a robust end-use 
monitoring (EUM) through the GOLDEN SENTRY program. 
 
 
Anticipated Reaction from Neighboring Nations 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) We do not anticipate the release of the Generation 
III AN/PVS-7 Night Vision Goggles to adversely affect the 
regional balance of power or cause negative reactions from 
neighboring nations, as these systems are already fielded in 
many countries of the region. 
 
Iraq's Political Importance to the Region 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) A stable, democratically-elected Iraqi government, 
capable of protecting its people and sovereignty, and 
remaining at peace with its neighbors is one of the USG's 
highest priorities.  The release and employment of the 
Generation III AN/PVS-7 Night Vision Goggles will facilitate 
progress toward this goal, advancing the Iraqi armed forces 
ability to identify, target and carry out operations against 
anti-Iraqi forces while reducing the risk to self and others. 
 
Source of Financing and Economic Impact 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) This purchase will be financed by Government of Iraq 
national funds already on deposit in their Foreign Military 
sales Bank Account. The cost is estimated at $6 million. 
There is no significant economic impact anticipated to be 
generated by this sale 
 
 
BAGHDAD 00001741  002 OF 002 
 
 
Relevant Human Rights Considerations 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) There are no human rights considerations that should 
preclude the release of the defense equipment to the Iraqi 
military. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
¶10. (SBU) We request Washington approval for the release to 
the of U.S Generation III AN/PVS-7 Night Vision Goggles 
(NVGs) to the Government of Iraq.
