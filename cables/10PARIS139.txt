REF: STATE 3080 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  France is promoting association with the Copenhagen 
Accord and is taking the initiative on next steps.   The GOF is 
urging African countries directly, and through the Francophonie 
organization indirectly, to associate themselves with the Copenhagen 
Accord.  The French are also working with the Norwegians on a "fast 
start" for the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and 
Degradation (REDD Plus) initiative.  The Ambassador will follow up 
on these topics with Environment Minister Borloo during their 
February 11 meeting.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) In public statements, both President Sarkozy and Environment 
Minister Borloo have been strongly supportive of the Copenhagen 
Accord.  President Sarkozy said that the Copenhagen Accord is not a 
revolution, but it is the start of a revolution.  Speaking on 
January 27 before the parliament's economic committee, Borloo 
pointed out that Europe accounts for only 17 percent of greenhouse 
gas emissions, and that Europe's post-Kyoto goal was to attract the 
remaining 80 percent of GHG emitters.  He added that, "if on January 
31 the rest of the world sends to the UN their engagement on 
association and their plans for reduction, Copenhagen will be a 
success." Dismissing pre-Copenhagen hopes, Borloo said that "a 
European-style legally binding agreement with the rest of the world 
was nonsense." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Both Environment and Foreign Ministry officials assured us 
that they strongly support the Copenhagen Accord, with which they 
associated through the European Union.  They urged African countries 
to associate with the Accord, and also sent out an appeal through 
the Francophonie organization urging association.  They worded the 
appeal to call attention to funds available through association 
without being blatant.  The Elysee Palace advocated that the EU be 
aggressive in pledging a 30 percent GHG reduction under the 
Copenhagen Accord, but working level officials explained that the 
EU's ultimate decision to pledge 20 percent now, and 30 percent 
contingent on other countries' targets and actions was more 
realistic. 
 
¶4. (SBU) To give greater credibility to the Copenhagen Accord's 
"fast start" concept, Foreign and Environment Ministry officials are 
already working closely with Norway on organizing a ministerial 
meeting on March 11 in Paris to give impetus to the Reducing 
Emissions by Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) PLUS program.  The 
March 11 meeting will prepare for a summit meeting in June in Oslo, 
where funding will be pledged for specific projects. 
¶5.  (SBU) Governance of future Copenhagen Accord implementing 
negotiations is a question still under discussion, according to our 
French contacts.  President Sarkozy had publicly proposed that the 
group of 28 countries in Copenhagen become a semi-permanent group 
with meetings alternating between United Nations Headquarters in New 
York and Bonn.  However, this appears to be the President's own 
opinion, and has not been considered by the ministries.  Our 
contacts pointed out that because the Copenhagen conference did not 
formally adopt the Copenhagen Accord, but only "took note" of it, 
there is an ambiguity about its relationship with the UNFCCC and the 
Kyoto Protocol.  French officials are wondering about the best 
approach to dealing with the rejectionists' opposition to the Accord 
-- whether to ignore them, or try to co-opt them. They note that 
Cuba, Venezuela and Bolivia have scheduled an April climate summit 
in Cochabamba, Bolivia in April. 
 
¶6. (SBU) On February 11 the Ambassador will be meeting with 
Environment Minister Borloo to follow-up on their pre-Copenhagen 
meeting.  Post requests any updated guidance or messages that 
Washington agencies would like conveyed in that meeting.
