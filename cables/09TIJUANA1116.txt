SUBJECT: QUANTIFYING VIOLENCE: TIJUANA'S DRUG VIOLENCE AS REFLECTED 
IN THE STATISTICS 
 
REF: A) TIJUANA 1092 B) TIJUANA 921 
 
(SBU) SUMMARY: Various political leaders, security officials, 
and business figures in Tijuana claim - as did the Mayor during 
the Ambassador's recent visit (ref A) - that successful 
civilian-military law enforcement cooperation here has produced 
substantial progress in diminishing narco-related violence, but 
it is difficult to obtain reliable statistics to prove these 
claims. Official statistics do show a drop in murders in 2009 
as compared to the previous year, but other types of crime, such 
as kidnappings, have increased. More importantly, lethal 
attacks on police and government officials have continued at an 
unprecedented pace. It is widely believed that violent crime 
statistics are artificially low because many citizens are afraid 
to report incidents to authorities whom they suspect have been 
corrupted by drug-trafficking organizations (DTO's). To the 
extent that the overall murder rate has dropped, many attribute 
this to the unusually good personal collaboration between the 
current Mexican Army commander and the Tijuana police chief, who 
is himself a former military officer. But this personal 
collaboration could end when one or both of these individuals 
move on. (END SUMMARY) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Local politicians and law enforcement officials 
point to the steep drop in narco-related murders in Baja 
California, from 604 in 2008 to 202 in the first nine months of 
2009, and a ten percent drop in overall crime in the first six 
months of 2009 versus the same period in 2008 (ref B). Most 
analysts credit the appointment of former military men to head 
municipal police entities, in particular Julian Leyzaola in 
Tijuana, and the state "preventative police" in Baja California, 
for better cooperation between civilian law enforcement and 
military forces resulting in some improvement in the security 
situation since 2008. Observers also note that the military has 
been deployed longer in Baja than in other hotspots along the 
border, such as Ciudad Juarez. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Still, these statistics need to be viewed in 
context. An improvement over 2008 isn't saying much. Even 
Tijuana Mayor Jorge Ramos admitted that "~2008 was a horrible 
year for the city", with gun fights in busy streets being almost 
commonplace, and DTOs acting with near impunity. Most agree 
the city has been brought back from the brink, but Tijuana 
remains disputed territory between rival lieutenants of the 
Arellano Felix Organization (AFO) and Sinaloa DTO and therefore 
remains a high-crime city. Even if overall crime is down 
slightly from last year, certain types of crimes are increasing. 
"Deprivation of liberty" - kidnapping with no ransom, generally 
associated with DTOs - is up from 235 reported incidents in the 
first half of 2008 to 292 in 2009. The number of reported 
kidnapping with ransom remained steady. Tijuana's murder rate 
is still higher today than it was in 2005-2007. There have been 
40 policemen killed in Baja California (most in Tijuana) so far 
in 2009 - on track to meet or exceed the 49 killed in all of 
¶2008. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Moreover, the progress that has been made is 
largely due to a personal relationship between Leyzaola and the 
military General deployed here. The relationship is not 
institutionalized and could whither with changing personalities. 
Despite efforts to weed out corrupt municipal police, there 
has been no progress on wholesale institutional reform needed, 
such as creation of a civil service career structure, better 
training, and more consistent leadership. More importantly, 
progress on the streets has not been matched by progress in the 
judicial sector. For example, the local military and state 
police provided Post an impressive list of arrests and seizures 
of drugs and money for 2009. Even if the numbers are to be 
believed - and some USG sources have noted that "Baja California 
features statistics that are exceptionally and suspiciously 
higher than any other state" - there are no records of follow-on 
prosecutions resulting from these seizures. Without this piece 
of the puzzle, making permanent inroads against the DTOs will 
remain elusive.
