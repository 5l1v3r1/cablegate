Dear Mr. President: 
 
After a long and rewarding career with the Foreign Service, I 
will retire from the U.S. government on December 19.  It has 
been a pleasure to work with you, sir. 
 
I was honored by your hospitality during Secretary Rice,s 
visit to Tunis this year.  Tunisia is one of the oldest 
friends of the United States, and has proven its graciousness 
and commitment to this mutual friendship between our two 
governments and peoples.  I have greatly appreciated your 
views and support on regional issues, including Tunisia,s 
participation in the Middle East Peace Process and support 
for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
 
 
It is my sincere hope that you and the people of Tunisia 
experience health, happiness, and prosperity, now and in the 
years ahead. 
 
With respect, 
Sincerely, 
David Welch 
 
 
END TEXT.
