SUBJECT: CHIEF RABBI PRAISES GOT, BUT ANTI-SEMITISM A 
GROWING CONCERN 
 
¶1.  Summary and Comment:  During a November 3 farewell call 
by the Ambassador on Chief Rabbi Isak Haleva and the 
leadership of the Jewish Community, Haleva expounded on the 
good relations maintained between the Jewish community and 
the Government of Turkey (GOT) on national and local levels, 
but also lamented a discernible rise of anti-Semitism among 
the Turkish people.  He noted that programs designed to 
introduce Muslim clerics and theologians to Judaism have been 
successful at improving impressions of Jews and one 
participant will become the Mufti of Istanbul. End Summary. 
 
Continued Positive Relations with the GOT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  Citing a history of cooperation with the state and state 
officials, Rabbi Haleva said that relations have improved to 
an unprecedented level under the AKP government.  "When there 
is an ear that listens to you," he said, "you feel filled 
with hope."  He compared the Jewish community's relationship 
with the government to that of a marriage in which arguments 
occur but in which the common sentiment is positive.  In 
fact, Jewish community president Sylvio Ovadya said that two 
years ago the Jewish community opened a synagogue in the 
Istanbul suburb of Kemerburgaz.  Unlike the experience of 
Christians and churches in Turkey, Ovadya said generally it 
is not difficult to open a new synagogue. "We simply asked 
the kaymakan (district governor) and he provided permission." 
 
¶3. Ovadya said that the Jewish community has gained 
importance in Turkey as more Turkish politicians meet with 
members of the "Jewish lobby" during their visits to the 
United States.  He also suggested that the AKP may seek 
closer relationships with minority communities within Turkey 
to avoid criticism due to their overarching Islamic identity. 
 Ovadya explained that the Jewish community has close 
relations with the Fetullah Gulen group in Istanbul, as well 
as with other Islamic groups that are much more open to 
dialogue than they were 20 years ago. Ovadya attributed this 
openness in part to the AKP's willingness to communicate with 
other religious populations.  Rabbi Haleva emphasized that 
"we couldn't have anticipated such good relations" with the 
ruling party. 
 
Less Favorable Relations with Turkish People 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶4.  Rabbi Haleva contended that in the Ottoman Empire, 
minorities had even more rights than Muslim Ottoman citizens, 
but "it would be the end of the world" if the Turkish public 
perceived such a situation today. "Now we are like acrobats, 
keeping a balance to keep everyone happy."  Noting that 
anti-Semitism continues to be widespread in Turkey, he said 
he perceived a troubling increase in the past few years. 
 
¶5.  According to Rabbi Haleva, the misrepresentation of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict causes more damage to the Jewish 
community and the Muslim world than any other concern. 
"Phrasing the conflict as a religious conflict forces 
individuals to take sides and stains history in a very 
significant way."  Rabbi Haleva said that such a skewed 
representation of the situation has heightened his 
community's struggle with anti-Semitism in Turkey. 
 
¶6.  Vice president of the Jewish community Sami Herman 
emphasized that while the community has good relationships 
with the upper levels of political and religious society, the 
Turkish people demonstrate that they are more anti-Semitic 
than ever before.  The Ambassador suggested that the Jewish 
community should take advantage of the opportunity presented 
by a group of scholars invited by the Diyanet for a 
reciprocal visit from the United States in the coming year. 
The Ambassador noted that an arranged conversation with the 
community and the group could go far. 
 
¶7.  Rabbi Haleva related his experience in leading 18 
theology professors to the Israel ten years ago in a program 
funded by the Turkish government.  All of the participants 
now have favorable impressions of Jews, and one of them will 
be the next Mufti of Istanbul.
