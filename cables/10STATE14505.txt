SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 050213112 AND 050213247 AND POST-SHIPMENT 
CHECK ON LICENSE 050141493 AND 050143433 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
pre-license and post-shipment check for the export of 
satellite components to Germany.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: the commodity of these four DDTC 
licenses are radiation hardened components for use by the 
German company Jena-Optronik GmbH in the manufacture of its 
ASTRO 10 star trackers that will be installed on two 
satellites.  All components are United States Munitions List 
(USML) items controlled under the International Traffic in 
Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Jena-Optronik's Internet website 
provides descriptive literature about its various star 
trackers, and there it states that the ASTRO 10 is of "ITAR 
Parts free design".  Although Jena-Optronik advertises its 
ASTRO 10 star trackers as ITAR-free, these licenses are 
evidence that some ASTRO 10 star trackers do have 
ITAR-controlled content.  This apparent discrepancy raises 
issues about export controls and possible ITAR violations. 
The Department therefore wishes to conduct a Blue Lantern 
check in order to query Jena-Optronik about its star trackers. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign End User/Foreign 
Consignee, Jena-Optronik GmbH, and make inquiries regarding 
the content of its star trackers and the sale of these items. 
 
The following questions are provided as guidance: 
 
--Jena-Optronik's ASTRO 10 star trackers are described on its 
website as "ITAR Parts free design".  Why then is 
Jena-Optronik requesting ITAR-controlled components for ASTRO 
10 star trackers? 
 
--Do some or all ASTRO 10 star trackers contain 
ITAR-controlled parts? 
 
--What percentage of the ASTRO 10 star trackers manufactured 
by Jena-Optronik contain ITAR-controlled parts? 
 
--Why do some ASTRO 10 star trackers contain ITAR-controlled 
components and others do not? 
 
--Who specifically requested and decided that the ASTRO 10 
star trackers for use on these two satellites should contain 
ITAR-controlled components? 
 
--Has Jena-Optronik ever used ITAR-controlled parts on any of 
its star trackers that were subsequently advertised, labeled, 
or sold as being "ITAR-free"? 
 
--Has Jena-Optronik sold any star tracker with U.S.-origin 
ITAR-controlled content to an end-user not authorized by DDTC 
license? 
 
--Has Jena-Optronik sold any of its star trackers to China or 
Iran, either through direct sales or via intermediaries?  If 
so, please provide details on how many and what type of star 
trackers have been sold. 
 
--Has Jena-Optronik sold any star trackers to China or Iran 
which contained any U.S.-origin components, whether 
ITAR-controlled or not?  Please provide details about all 
U.S.-origin parts used in any star trackers that 
Jena-Optronik has sold to China or Iran, including part 
description, stock number, source, and U.S. company of 
manufacture. 
 
--Has Jena-Optronik used all of the ITAR-controlled 
components it has ever received via DDTC licenses, or does it 
currently maintain a stockpile of unused parts?  Request that 
Jena-Optronik provide an accounting of all holdings it has of 
unused ITAR-controlled components in storage, including the 
disposition of any parts that were defective or destroyed. 
Jena-Optronik should identify the DDTC licenses through which 
it obtained all of the ITAR-controlled parts it currently has 
stockpiled.  Also ask Jena-Optronik if it has ever 
re-transferred or re-exported any U.S.-origin ITAR-controlled 
components without DDTC authorization. 
 
--Finally, ask Jena-Optronik if it understands the 
restrictions on U.S.-origin ITAR-controlled commodities, 
particularly the prohibition against re-transfers or 
re-exports without express USG authorization. 
 
END ACTION.
