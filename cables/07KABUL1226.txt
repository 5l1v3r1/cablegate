¶I. SUMMARY 
 
¶1.   (SBU) SUMMARY: During this reporting period the Border 
Management Task Force (BMTF) was briefed by the European Commission 
and UNDP regarding the planned construction upgrades in Badakhshan 
Province on the Tajikistan and Afghanistan border for three Border 
Crossing Points (BCPs): Nusay; Segnan; and Eshkashem. 
Representatives from the BMTF and the Afghanistan Engineering 
District (AED) traveled to Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to meet with US 
Embassy personnel to discuss infrastructure activity and 
cross-border coordination between the Tajikistan and Afghanistan 
border. The purpose of the visit was to discuss infrastructure 
activity and cross-border coordination. The BMTF acquired the 
Iranian infrastructure drawing from the Afghan Customs Department 
(ACD) that will be used by the Iranians to build the new BCP at Mile 
Marker 78 in Afghanistan.  The Iranians previously proposed this new 
crossing. The GoA agreed to this, provided the Iranians would build 
the crossing facility. CSTC-A CJ-7 Army Corp of Engineers has 
completed the $400,000.00 upgrade project at the Islam Qalah BCP. 
This project has brought some organization to the chaos that was 
present prior to these upgrades.  Task Force Phoenix, a subordinate 
element of CSTC-A, Regional Corps Advisory Group (RCAG) and the 
Regional Police Advisory Team (RPAT) for the western region is 
coordinating a Regional Security Council with ISAF RC-West and the 
ANA, ANP and ABP to engage with the local elders in an attempt to 
find agreeable solutions to economic issues surrounding the presence 
of the central government's BCP operation.  The BMTF briefed Richard 
Douglas, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Counter-Narcotics, Counter-Proliferation and Global Threats, who was 
in Kabul to gather current information about programs and projects 
being funded by DOD, specifically JIACG-CN. The BMTF also briefed 
Diana Brown who is part of the US Mission to the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Ms. Brown was in Kabul 
gathering current information from many GoA partners on programs 
that may benefit from services provided by the OSCE to bridge the 
gaps that exist in many sectors of donor supported programs.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
II. ITEMS OF BROAD INTEREST. 
¶2.   (U) The BMTF was briefed by the European Commission UNDP 
regarding planned construction upgrades in Badakhshan Province on 
the Tajikistan and Afghanistan border for three BCPs: Nusay ($160K); 
Segnan ($290K); and Eshkashem ($380K).  UNDP is also planning 
cross-border training for ABP and Customs officials at these 
locations for cross-border familiarization of the Tajikistan and 
Afghan BCP operations.  In addition, UNDP is considering employing 
subject matter experts as mentors for each of the BCPs on both sides 
of the border. 
¶3.  (SBU) Representatives from the BMTF and the Afghanistan 
Engineering District (AED) traveled to Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to meet 
with US Embassy personnel including representatives from the Defense 
Attache Office (DAO), Department of Justice Senior Law Enforcement 
Advisor (SLEA) and the EXBS Advisor.  The purpose of the visit was 
to discuss infrastructure activity and cross-border coordination 
between the Tajikistan and Afghan border.  The following were 
highlighted as priority issues raised by BMTF and AED: 
 
-- Retention of the Nizhny Pyandzh, Tajikistan BCP construction 
compound (US Army Corp of Engineers) upon completion of the bridge 
project linking the 2 countries for deployment of BCP 
mentors/trainers to work one or both sides of the bridge. 
-- Provide focus/raise awareness on lack of a commercial compound 
plans at the Shir Khan/Nizhny Pyandzh crossing by securing donor 
funding options; plan/design/build commercial inspection facilities 
at NP. (The EC is constructing a large modern commercial facility on 
 
KABUL 00001226  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
the Afghan side in Shir Kahn). 
-- Plan/coordinate/conduct joint training efforts for Tajik/Afghan 
border officials using agreed upon standardized and vetted 
curriculums. 
-- Promote communication between Tajik and Afghan Border agencies 
and promote better relationships between the border guards and their 
customs counterparts at their respective locations. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In a related matter, members of the Tajikistan government 
had agreed earlier to train Tajik and Afghan border elements at the 
Khorog Training Center near the Afghan BCP at Segnan in Badakhshan 
Province.  A memo was written by the First Deputy Chairman Mirzoev 
from the Tajikistan State National Security Committee (NSC) to the 
Border Management for Central Asia (BOMCA) and the Central Asia Drug 
Action Program (CADAP) programs of the European Union declining to 
train any Afghan personnel.  Specifically, the document states "Due 
to structural changes, lack of required conditions, including legal 
barriers, we abstain from organization of training for Afghan border 
guards and customs in the Khorog Training Center." It also goes on 
to say "...the activity of liaison officers is inexpedient".  This 
prompted a diplomatic note from the US Embassy in Dushanbe asking 
them to reconsider. No reply from the Tajik NSC has been received to 
date. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) During this visit, BMTF and AED representatives learned 
that the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) in Tajikistan is planning the 
construction of 2 bridges over the Panj river at the Tajikistan BCPs 
located in Vanj and Shuroobod connecting with the Afghanistan 
Badakshan Province.  The BMTF is scheduling meetings with the Afghan 
Customs Department (ACD) and the AKF to address the issues of new 
BCPs at these Afghan crossing locations that were not previously 
taken into account. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The BMTF acquired the Iranian infrastructure drawing from 
the ACD that will be used by the Iranians to build the new BCP at 
Mile Marker 78 in Afghanistan.  The Iranians previously proposed 
this new crossing which the GoA agreed to if the Iranians would 
build the crossing facility.  This location is approximately midway 
between the Islam Qalah and the Zaranj BCPs.  The Iranians also 
agreed to refurbish the Zaranj BCP in the southern Afghan Province 
of Nimroz. The German Police Project Office (GPPO) is scheduled to 
meet with Iranian Embassy representatives in Kabul to discuss ABP 
training previously offered by the Iranians.  This will be followed 
up by a visit to Tehran by representatives of the German Ministry of 
Interior to discuss Iranian funding of Afghan police projects with a 
priority on counter-narcotics and border security. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) CSTC-A CJ-7 Army Corp of Engineers has completed the 
$400,000.00 upgrade project at the Islam Qalah BCP.  This project 
has brought some organization to the chaos that was present prior to 
these upgrades.  The traffic pattern and resurfacing of the BCP 
roads has greatly increased the proper flow of commercial traffic 
into and out of the customs facility.  Also, the areas of operation 
between the various border elements, i.e. pedestrian, immigration 
and commercial traffic have been sectioned off, thereby improving 
security within these respective areas. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The $15 million 450-day project funded by the United 
States at the Islam Qalah BCP is underway. BMTF has reached out to 
humanitarian organizations in Herat to direct their attention to the 
conditions of the local population surrounding the BCP in an attempt 
to garner their support.  The RCAG/RPAT for the western region is 
coordinating a Regional Security Council with ISAF RC-West and the 
ANA, ANP and ABP to engage with the local elders in an attempt to 
find agreeable solutions to economic issues surrounding the presence 
of central government's BCP operation.  A Civil Affairs humanitarian 
visit of the villages surrounding the Islam Qalah BCP is scheduled 
 
KABUL 00001226  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
for the first week in April. 
 
¶9. (SBU) BMTF representatives assessed the current situation at the 
Weesch/Spin Boldak BCP -- Spin Boldak BCP is 8 km inland from the 
actual crossing point at Weesch -- which serves as Afghanistan's 
main southern entry and exit point with Pakistan.  Steel, raw 
materials and contraband cigarettes from the former Soviet Union 
travels from the Towraghundi BCP on the Turkmenistan border and 
exits this port for foundries and markets in Pakistan and India. 
Cars, produce, clothing and food products enter the port for use in 
Afghanistan.  This is only a limited list of the products transiting 
this port on a daily basis.  During a recent visit this month by 
BMTF and AED the following observations were made during a one day 
tour of the Weesch crossing: 
 
-- The crossing point at Weesch is congested with commercial shops 
and residences that straddle the border leaving little space to 
construct a proper BCP. 
 
-- Little or no inbound vehicle inspections by ACD or ABP 
immigration inspections were conducted. 
 
-- None of the hundreds of donkey carts entering and exiting the 
border were stopped for inspection. 
 
-- A sizable number of commercial trucks circumvented the customs 
process in Spin Boldak by entering private warehouses after crossing 
at Weesch, thus avoiding duties and adding to the leakage of 
revenue. 
 
-- The following daily traffic estimates are considered valid: 
 
a. 800 to 1,000 commercial trucks (Jingle trucks) 
b. 300 to 500 small commercial trucks (pickup) 
c. 500 to 600 donkey carts 
d. 500 POVs 
-- Pakistan estimates that 30,000 pedestrians transit this crossing 
each day.  The BMTF team observed several hundred crossing the 
border in an hour mid-day. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) ISAF and CSTC-A report that the amount of uncontrollable 
traffic crossing at Weesch lends itself to easy access by insurgents 
and weapons smugglers.  It is agreed that the construction of a 
fully functional BCP at Weesch would end the chaos and bring control 
and organization to the area, forestalling the free movement of 
illegal aliens, insurgents and contraband.  Efforts are underway by 
the BMTF and the ACD to gather donor support to fund this estimated 
$14 million BCP construction.  In the interim, BMTF has submitted 
suggested traffic patterns to CSTC-A CJ-7 engineers who have agreed 
to provide placement of structural barriers, i.e. Jersey Barriers, 
fencing or HESCOS to gain some control over the Weesch crossing. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) The BMTF team met with the Kandahar Director of Customs 
who stated that his department could make land available for the 
construction of a new BCP.  He claimed that the local traders also 
support such construction.  ACD has been requested by the BMTF to 
begin identifying parcels of land in the vicinity that could be used 
to house the new BCP. 
 
¶12.  (SBU) INL/DynCorp mentors located in Kandahar possess a strong 
grasp of the local situation at the Weesch/Spin Boldak BCP.  They 
are working hard to mentor the border police and are improving ABP 
operations.  However, Afghan Customs operations fall outside the 
parameters of their mission and no equivalent with Customs 
experience is in place to mentor either the Customs Officials or 
Customs Police.  Revenue collection is expected to remain stagnant 
until proper Customs procedures and processes are taught and ACD 
 
KABUL 00001226  004.2 OF 004 
 
 
employees are properly mentored to carry out their duties. 
¶13.  (SBU) The BMTF briefed Richard Douglas, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Counter-Narcotics, Counter-Proliferation 
 
SIPDIS 
and Global Threats, who was in Kabul to gather current information 
about programs and projects being funded by DOD, specifically the 
Joint Interagency Coordination Group-Counter Narcotics (JIACG-CN). 
The BMTF currently receives approximately $11 million from JIACG-CN 
to fund approximately 10 of the anticipated 21 positions within the 
BMTF. 
¶14.  (SBU) The BMTF also briefed Diana Brown who is part of the US 
Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(OSCE).  Ms. Brown was in Kabul gathering current information from 
many GoA partners on programs that may benefit from the services 
provided by the OSCE to bridge the gaps that exist in many sectors 
of donor supported programs.  Ms. Brown stated that the OSCE is also 
redirecting part of its focus on the Central Asia countries in 
anticipation of supporting border security and cross-border 
integration with Afghanistan and its neighbors to the north.  BMTF 
stressed the need for more training required for better 
effectiveness of the border elements and the introduction of a 
subject matter expert border mentorship program that requires help 
in developing.
