SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - WMD FOREIGN CONSEQUENCE 
MANAGEMENT MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 12882 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Helsinki POL, ECON and DAO have reviewed the 
proposed language for subject MOU and can identify no 
changes that would improve the likelihood of Finnish 
Government interest. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Without having consulted host country officials, 
Embassy judges the likelihood of GOF interest in concluding 
such an MOU with the United States to be high.  Finland has 
consistently taken a very pro-active interest in 
international cooperative efforts aimed at limiting the 
spread of WMD, and at this point we have little reason to 
believe they would oppose a possible avenue for 
international cooperation in the areas of WMD disaster 
consequence management. 
 
¶3. (U) Finnish MFA points of contact for further action on 
this issue would likely be Laura Kansikas-DeBrais, Director 
of the Political Department's Unit for Arms Control and 
Non-Proliferation, and/or Marja Lehto, Director of the 
Legal Department's Unit for Public International Law.
