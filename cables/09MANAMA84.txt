SUBJECT: BAHRAIN'S FIRST TIP CONVICTION 
 
REF: 08 MANAMA 777 
 
¶1. (SBU) Bahrain's Public Prosecution reported to us on 
January 20 that Arfa Ching, a Thai national, was convicted on 
one count of trafficking in persons on December 23.  The 
three-judge panel sentenced her to three and a half years' 
imprisonment and fined her BD 5,000 (USD 13,250).  MFA 
Undersecretary Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa, who chairs 
the GOB's interagency anti-TIP committee, confirmed the 
conviction in a meeting with A/DCM on February 12, pointing 
to the case as a success story for Bahrain's new 
anti-trafficking law.  Bahraini media did not report on the 
outcome of the case. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ching's was the first case prosecuted under 
Bahrain's Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons, enacted in 
January 2008.  According to prosecutors, she brought three 
Thai women to Bahrain under false pretenses.  When they 
learned she intended to employ them as prostitutes, one of 
them contacted authorities, who arrested Ching. The sentence 
exceeded the minimum sentencing guideline of three years' 
imprisonment and BD 1,000 (USD 2,650).
