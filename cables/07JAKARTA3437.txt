¶1.  Summary: The Indonesian firm PT Anjelika Surya Jaya (Anjelia) 
verified on December 13 its order of automati direction finder 
(ADF)  receiver for F-27 aircrat detailed in reftel.  An Indonesian 
Air Force (AF) officer confirmed on December 13 that Anjelika s a 
registered supplier on the IAF's supply listand the IAF placed the 
order.  We visited Anjelia's office facility on Deccember 18, 2007 
and conluded that while the company appears to be legitimte, it is 
a small, unsophisticated operation withminimal on-site security. 
End summary. 
 
¶2.  Wecontacted Anjelika Surya Jaya on December 13 to cofirm 
transaction of goodds listed in reftel.  Anjlika's marketing 
executive Christian Deni confired that the company received an 
order from the IA in September 2007 to procure spare parts for 
IA's F-27 aircraft.  On December 18, we met with Anjlika's 
President Director Sardjono (retired IAF eneral) and Director 
Sukirwan (retired IAF colonl) at their office.  The third partner 
in the comany, Rio Permana, was not able to attend.  They prvided 
copies of the contract with IAF for procurment of avionic 
components as well as purchase oder and end user/end use statement 
for the ADF rceiver detailed in reftel. 
 
¶3. According to Deni,the ADF receiver will be shipped by air from 
theU.S. seller through Horizon International, a freigt forwarder" 
used by the company, in Singapore. Sardjono and Sukirwan said ssing 
a shipping company in Singapore was cost-efe ctive.  Horizon will 
then deliver the component  to Anjelika before sending to IAF's 
warehouse a  Halim Air Force Base in East Jakarta.  Anjelika's 
relationship with Horizon is only five to six monhhs old.  Sardjono 
and Sukirwan said the IAF typia lly chooses the shipping company. 
Sardjono saidaa retired Navy friend, Maximilian Pong, recommendeQ 
Horizon to him. 
 
¶4. Sardjono and Sukirwan said they will hold the components in an 
unused spaceaat Anjelika's office until delivery, which they sad 
would be the same day or next business day.  W  observed the holding 
space and noted that it isa  small office with one barred window. 
They said their office boy sleeps at the office so that the office 
is never left unattended.  There are no othr" on-site security 
measures.  However, the offic  is located in an area that is 
governed and patrl(led by the IAF as it contains the former IAF 
Headquarters and still contains IAF officer housing.  hhe IAF has 
guards posted at the access points tot his area around the clock; 
however, they only rsstrict entry at night. 
 
¶5.  Deni said that his cm(pany contracted to procure avionic 
components without installation services.  Deni said that the 
oompany is well aware of the restrictions of UnitedSQtates Munitions 
List (USML) articles, including those pertaining to unauthorized 
re-transfer and re-exports.  However, Sardjono and Sukirwan did not 
know about the restrictions and they were surprised that the ADF 
receiver was included on the USML because ADF receivers are used in 
commercial airplanes and are not sensitive military equipment, 
according to them. 
 
¶6.  PT Anjelika Surya Jaya was established in 2005 to supply 
aircraft spare parts as well as ground radar and communications 
parts.  To date, the company supplies avionic components solely for 
the IAF.  Anjelika has regular procurement contracts with IAF to 
supply spare parts for their Puma, Bell and Colibri helicopters. 
Their accountant holds a Bachelor's degree in economics. 
 
¶7.  We contacted Lieutenant Colonel M. Gofar, IAF Section Chief of 
Procurement Services for Radar and Avionics on December 13 to 
confirm the transaction on application 050067028.  Lt. Col. Gofar 
confirmed that Anjelika Surya Jaya is their registered supplier. 
Gofar confirmed that his office ordered components detailed in 
reftel from Anjelika in September 2007.  According to Gofar, this is 
the first transaction with the company in 2007, but IAF plans to 
place other orders in 2008.  Lieutenant Colonel M. Gofar also 
confirmed that an Indonesian Armed Force Squadron technician will 
install the ADF receiver into their F-27 aircraft.
