¶1. (U)  Summary.  Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, 
overturned President Yushchenko's veto of the bill extending the 
moratorium on the sale of agricultural land until January 1, 2012. 
In a widely expected move, the Rada confirmed its decision to 
formally put agricultural land sales on hold for two more years. 
The extension of the moratorium benefits large agricultural 
companies and land speculators to the detriment of small farmers, 
who have no choice but to lease their land for low rents.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U)  As predicted (Ref B), the Parliament of Ukraine on January 
19 overturned President Yushchenko's veto of the law extending the 
moratorium on sales of farmland until January 1, 2012.  Several 
attempts to overturn the veto during the morning session failed, and 
the matter was sent to the Committee for Agricultural Policy and 
Land Relations for consideration.  During the afternoon session, the 
parliamentary deputies returned to the issue and gathered enough 
votes to overturn the veto in the fifth round of voting (three 
during the morning session, two in the afternoon).  The moratorium 
was upheld by the Party of Regions (151 votes), Bloc of Yulia 
Tymoshenko (151 votes), Our Ukraine (16), Communists (27), Bloc of 
Lytvyn (20) and 1 unaligned deputy (366 votes out of 466 total). 
 
¶3. (U)  Even had the moratorium expired, land sales would still have 
been stalled.  Valeriy Bevzenko, Chairman of the Committee for 
Agricultural Policy and Land Relations, stated that required 
legislation on land market regulation and creating a registry would 
not be ready for another five or six years.  As a result, he expects 
the moratorium to be extended again in 2012. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment.  This consecutive extension of the agricultural 
land sale moratorium plays into the hands of large agricultural 
companies and land speculators.  Farmers, unable to sell their 
property, lease the land to large farm holdings while receiving low 
monthly payments for the use of their property.  Legislation needed 
to end the moratorium is unlikely to be passed any time soon and 
lacks support in the Rada. End comment.
