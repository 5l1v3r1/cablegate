INTERNATIONAL CONTACT GROUP 
 
REF: STATE 16168 
 
(SBU)  MFA DAS-equivalent for East and Central Africa Helene 
Le Gal said that she and her colleagues would study U.S. 
proposals for reforming the International Contact Group on 
Somalia.  We noted that reftel downplayed the differences 
between formal members of the Group and "observers" (which 
include France), suggesting that the views and participation 
of countries in both categories could be accommodated.  Le 
Gal said she would provide feedback once she was able to 
consider the matter further.
