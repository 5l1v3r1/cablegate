SUBJECT: HIV GLOBAL FUND NEEDS ASSESSMENT 
REF: STATE 24040 
 
1.(U) Summary. The Embassy is not submitting additional Scopes of 
Work because all needs identified for GOCR can be covered by 
existing programs being funded by USAID. End Summary. 
 
2.(U) Reftel requested posts to identify points of contact (POCs) 
within the Missions to provide oversight for technical assistance 
related to grants from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, 
and Malaria.  The Office of Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) set a 
deadline of June 15, 2006, to submit Scopes of Work for technical 
assistance. 
 
3.(U) The Embassy has identified the following personnel as POC: 
Environmental Assistant Cinthya Alfaro and Economic Assistant Maria 
Villanueva. 
 
4.(U) Mission POCs received support from USAID Program for 
Strengthening the Central American Response to HIV/AIDS (PASCA) and 
from Dr. Gisselle Lucas, POC for Costa Rica's Global Fund Country 
Coordinating Mechanism (CMM). PASCA and the Humanist Institute for 
Cooperation with Developing Countries (HIVOS), the principle 
recipient, identified three priority areas for technical assistance: 
(1) monitoring and evaluation (M&E); (2) strengthening of 
implementing units; and (3) the Country Coordinating Mechanism. 
PASCA and the regional program of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention/Global AIDS Program (CDC/GAP) can cover all needs 
identified.  Therefore the Mission is not submitting additional 
Scopes of Work at this time. 
 
¶5. (U) Cesar Nuez, PASCA, has provided the following information 
concerning technical assistance needed: 
 
 (1) Monitoring and Evaluation: The Secretariat has requested that 
HIVOS update their M&E matrix for Phase II implementation.  An 
evaluation plan should be developed to enable stakeholders to 
understand the impact made to reduce the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Costa 
Rica. Methodology and baseline data need to be identified. 
 
      (2) Strengthening of Implementing Units: Training is required 
in the areas of report writing, program implementation, internal 
M&E, and accountability. 
 
      (3) Country Coordinating Mechanism: The GOCR CCM lacks 
internal governing rules. This may impact negatively on key 
components of day-today work such as governance, conflict of 
interest and transparency. 
 
¶6. (U) Comment: In response to Reftel 103678, post recommended 
continued funding at projected levels with funds to be managed by an 
NGO to improve timely disbursement of funds.  Post is pleased that 
GOCR has presented a new structure for 2006, utilizing the new 
Principal Recipient, HIVOS. END COMMENT.
