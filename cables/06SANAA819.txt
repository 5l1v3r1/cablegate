On March 21, Econoff delivered reftel demarches to Derhim 
Assaidi, Head of the Americas desk at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  The meeting was delayed several weeks as a result 
of a recent cabinet reshuffle.  The previous head of Yemen's 
Anti-Terrorist Financing Committee is now serving as 
Ambassador to India.  Econoff asked Assaidi to pass the 
talking points on cash curriers and charities to Deputy 
Foreign Minister Khalid Al-Aqwa, now heading the committee. 
Al-Aqwa is currently in Thailand, and Assaidi was not able to 
say who was representing Yemen at the MENA-FATF plenary in 
Egypt.  Post will follow up with Al-Aqwa upon his return to 
determine clearly who has responsibility in the ROYG for 
terrorist financing and money laundering issues.
