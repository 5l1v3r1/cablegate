SUBJECT: MOROCCAN IMAMS TO RECEIVE EDUCATION IN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED 
DISEASES 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: Moroccan Imams will begin receiving awareness training 
as part of the GOM's fight against HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted 
diseases (STDs) beginning in Sept 2006.  The voluntary training 
represents a joint initiative by the Ministries of Islamic Affairs 
(MIA) and Health (MOH), and consists of classes covering human 
anatomy and the means of HIV transmission.  It will not include 
discussion on the use of condoms.  The training will be conducted by 
a Moroccan NGO, the Moroccan League Against Sexually Transmitted 
Diseases (LMLMST), and is part of the GOM's efforts to aggressively 
combat the spread of HIV while respecting traditional Muslim values. 
 The involvement of religious leaders builds upon the 2004 Cairo 
Declaration calling for religious institutions to provide economic 
and spiritual support to people infected with HIV.  End Summary.

Imam Training Part of Broad Government Campaign 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2.  As reported in the French language weekly, Le Journal 
Hebdomadaire, a Moroccan NGO (LMLMST) is slated to begin an 
educational initiative in September 2006 for Imams and Morchidates 
(women religious educators in mosques).  The training will cover the 
transmission of the HIV virus with the intent of sensitizing one of 
the most important forces in Moroccan social and religious life to 
the realities of HIV/AIDS.  The plan is for the Imams and 
Morchidates, whose participation is voluntarily, to receive basic 
HIV and STD training in order to increase awareness and to change 
traditional Muslim perceptions related to STDs.  In Morocco, as well 
as other Arab countries, many issues connected with the HIV epidemic 
and sexuality in general have been taboo, and STDs have often been 
perceived as a punishment from God. 
 
¶3.  Professor Mohamed Belkebir, a sociologist in charge of this 
program for LMLMST, told Econ FSN the program is intended as the 
first-step in providing the religious community with factual 
information concerning prevention, transmission, and consequences of 
STDs.  He stressed that at this stage the role of condoms will not 
be included.  The initiative builds upon the 2004 UNDP Cairo 
Declaration, signed by religious leaders from 19 Arab countries, 
which declared that people with HIV/AIDS should receive economic, 
psychological, and spiritual support from religious institutions. 
 
¶4.  In June 2006, the GOM highlighted its HIV/AIDS prevention and 
treatment efforts through a high profile appearance of Princess 
Lalla Salma, and Minister of Health Mohammed Cheikh Biadillah at the 
UN AIDS conference in New York.  At the conference, Biadillah 
emphasized that the implementation of any strategy against the 
spread of HIV/AIDS required a partnership between civil society and 
the government, as well as durable funding.  Good to his word, the 
Imam training initiative represents a government-civil partnership 
among the MOH, the MIA, and LMLMST, with funding provided by the 
Global Fund, an international NGO combating AIDS.

Growing Infection Rate In Women Raises Alarm 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  The GOM seeks to avoid a potential health crisis in Morocco. 
While the HIV prevalence rate is below 0.15 percent (well under the 
9 percent adult prevalence rate for much of Africa), Morocco has a 
high rate of STDs and a high influx of refugees, two major risk 
factors for the spread of HIV.  In addition, observers point to a 
sharp increase (over 30 percent in the past 5 years) in infection 
rate among women, both inside and outside of marriage. 
 
¶6. Because of low literacy rates in Morocco and the widespread 
taboos about discussing sex and sexuality in public, AIDS educators 
are seeking to take advantage of the Imams' moral authority. 
However, a recent survey released by the MIA and the MOH revealed 
that of 360 surveyed Imams, the majority were either unaware or 
ignored the medical aspects, causes, and effects of HIV infection. 
On the positive side, the majority of those surveyed expressed 
enthusiasm and interest in participating in the program. 
 
¶7. Comment.  The inclusion of Islamic leaders in the fight against 
HIV/AIDS is a significant initiative by the GOM and serves as 
another example of Morocco's moderate Muslim views.  Throughout much 
of the Arab world, HIV is still considered a curse from God and 
those infected suffer from alienation and stigmatization.  The 
results of the 360 Imams surveyed underscore the need for this 
program, and highlight the general state of HIV and STD 
misunderstanding throughout much of the region.  However, failure to 
address the role of condoms in preventing sexually transmitted 
diseases appears to be a serious shortcoming of this otherwise 
positive initiative.  End Comment.
