SUBJ:  MINISTERS CITE MEASURABLE RESULTS IN AFGHAN MISSION 
 
REF: Ottawa 1903 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Foreign Minister Bernier and International 
Development Minister Oda appeared before the House of Commons' 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Committee on December 11 to 
describe progress in Afghanistan.  The ministers insisted that the 
resolve of NATO partners is strong, that development efforts are 
yielding measurable results, and that Canada is "well on track" to 
reaching its goals of stability, good governance, and lasting peace 
in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, with the Manley Panel's report on 
Canada's future role in Afghanistan (reftel) due in late January, 
the government and the opposition are preparing for what could be 
the most contentious parliamentary debates of 2008. End summary. 
 
NATO COMMITED, ARMY AND POLICE ON TRACK 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier told the parliamentarians 
that NATO's commitment to the Afghan mission remains "very strong" 
and that NATO partners at the December 6-7 NATO Foreign Ministerial 
in Brussels were "united in the conviction" that there could be no 
reconstruction without security.  He said that Canada's 350-person 
Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Kandahar is yielding results 
in training of police, developing justice capacity, and promoting 
governance. 
 
¶3.  (U) Canada will take the military lead in Regional Command South 
(RC-S) from February 2008 and Canadian Forces are "well on track" to 
reaching their goal of training the Afghan army and increasing its 
capacity to mount independent actions, according to Bernier.  Canada 
is also taking a comprehensive approach to reform of the Afghan 
police, and providing strategic advice, equipment, salaries, and 
uniforms, as well as building infrastructure (such as police 
sub-stations), mentoring, and training, he added.  Forty-six 
Canadian civilian and Military Police trainers are currently on the 
ground in Kandahar.  Between 2002 and 2008, Canada will contribute a 
total of $39.8 million in wages for the Afghan police. 
 
RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT DELIVERS RESULTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Minister Beverley Oda announced that in 2008 the Canadian 
International Development Agency (CIDA) will increase the number of 
its field staff in Kandahar to 35.  Under the terms of the Afghan 
Compact, she said, Canada will spend $1.2 billion on reconstruction 
aid for Afghanistan by 2011.  Both ministers cited "significant 
achievements" and "real results" in Canada's efforts to promote 
access to education and basic health care in Afghanistan, 
particularly for women and girls.  They also noted that Canada had 
recently increased its already significant contribution to de-mining 
by an additional $80 million over four years. 
 
NEARING ANOTHER VOTE 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Regarding the future of Canada's mission in Afghanistan, 
Minister Bernier said that the government is committed to holding 
another vote in the Commons in 2008, but that the government does 
not believe that Canada should abandon Afghanistan after 2009.  He 
said the government wants the debate to be "as non-partisan as 
possible" and denied that the government had already made up its 
mind and is "gearing up" to impose its vision on Parliament.  He 
stated the government's action on this issue has been "transparent 
and clear," that -- in a minority position -- the government will 
have to listen to opposition parties, and that it would carefully 
consider the advice of all MPs and of the independent Manley panel, 
Qconsider the advice of all MPs and of the independent Manley panel, 
and arrive at a consensus in the House of Commons. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Ministers Bernier and Oda's briefings were firmly "on 
message," insisting that the Afghan mission is yielding measurable 
results, that development is happening, and that the mission's 
balance of development and security will improve as the security 
situation stabilizes.  Probably to the disappointment of the 
government, there was little or no significant press coverage of 
these positive iterations about the accomplishments of the current 
mission.  Both parliamentarians and the public may be looking more 
toward the recommendations of the Manley Panel (due in late 
January), although many opposition MPs have told us privately that 
nothing the panel could propose would change their parties' 
positions on the future of the Afghan mission.  Expectations are 
that the debates in the Foreign Affairs Committee and in the full 
House on the next resolution about the fate of Canadian Forces in 
Afghanistan after February 2009 will be heated and have the 
potential to spark the most divisive Parliamentary discussions in 
¶2008.
