¶1.  (SBU)  The UK considers the Joint Integrated Units (JIUs) 
vital to full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement (CPA) and the future of security in Sudan, 
according to Peter Lord, Senior Political Officer for 
North-South Issues in FCO's Sudan Unit.  (Lord happens to be 
an American FSO seconded to FCO on a diplomatic exchange 
program.)  Lord shared details of UK support to the JIUs (see 
para. 2).  He noted that the UK understands from UNMIS Force 
Commander General Lidder that the JIUs need additional 
military training support, conducted in Sudan or abroad.  The 
UK also understands that there are significant gaps in 
financial and logistical support, as well as in such 
non-military support areas as integration and conflict 
resolution courses.  Reminding that the UK chairs the 
Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC) security 
sub-committee, Lord said HMG would be interested to know 
other countries' responses to the USG's demarche, and what 
China and Russia are telling the USG. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Lord shared the following details on British 
support to the JIUs, noting that the American and British 
DATTs in Khartoum coordinate closely, so these details will 
probably not come as news to the USG: 
 
- Demining courses and follow-up evaluation and advice, 
conducted by British Army Training Team in Kenya.  In 2008, 
two short-term training teams will conduct in-country 
training on topics other than demining. 
 
- English language courses at various levels to provide a 
common language of operation.  This will continue in 2008 for 
a third year. 
 
- Sponsorship and funding for students, on an equitable 
SAF/SPLA basis, to professional military schools including 
Sandhurst, International Battlegroup Commanders' Course, and 
International Peacekeepers' Course. 
 
- Non-military training courses on conflict management and 
re-integration in southern Sudan, focusing on transparency, 
accountability, and professionalism in the SPLA. 
 
- Unofficial assistance in developing standard operating 
procedures and appropriate military structures.
