(C) On June 12 A/PolCouns met with the GOI Ministry of External Affairs Joint Secretary for Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, Mohan Kumar, to deliver ref A demarche. Kumar said that he had ""previously discussed the idea with (Foreign Secretary) Saran"", and thought it made sense to have two

distinct contact groups to examine LTTE fundraising and arms procurement. Kumar mentioned that Canada should certainly be included in the terror financing contact group, but did not have any additional comments regarding the composition of the group or restricting LTTE arms and financing. In a previous conversation in New Delhi with PDAS Camp (reftel B), Kumar suggested involving southeast Asian statek such as Thailand and Malaysia to restrict LTTE arms flows, and therefore was pleased at the proposed composition of the weapons procurement contact group.
