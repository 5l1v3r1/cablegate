SUBJECT: UNGA RESOLUTION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE 
 
¶1.  USUN is authorized to co-sponsor and join consensus on 
the EU-drafted General Assembly resolution on "Assistance to 
the Palestinian People." 
 
¶2.  If there are any last-minute changes to the text that 
lead Israel to decide not to join the consensus on this 
resolution, as it currently plans to do, USUN should defer 
action and immediately seek guidance from the Department.
