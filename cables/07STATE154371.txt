Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
Thank you for your invitation to the G8/Outreach Foreign 
Ministers Meeting in Berlin.  Regrettably, my schedule 
does not permit me to attend this important meeting. 
Under Secretary of State Reuben Jeffery, who serves as the G8 
Foreign Affairs Sous-Sherpa and is the Department of State's 
principal representative on energy issues, will participate in 
my stead. 
 
I am confident the meeting will successfully contribute to the 
discussion of energy security and the global environment.  I 
look forward to hearing results of the meeting. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Condoleezza Rice
