SUBJECT: CRITERIA DEFINING PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF U.S. 
DIPLOMATIC FAMILY MEMBERS:  PRACTICE IN SUDAN 
 
REF: STATE 14282 
 
¶1. (SBU) On February 19 poloff met with MFA Director of Protocol 
Ambassador Ali Youssif to review Sudanese practice regarding Sudan's 
criteria applied to recognizing the privileges and immunities of 
"members of the family" of a diplomatic agent, particularly with 
respect to children. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Youssif repeated what he told poloff over the 
phone, that Sudan determines which individuals it recognizes as 
"members of the family" based on reciprocity, reflecting the 
treatment its diplomats and their dependents are receiving abroad. 
Sudanese legislation governing this issue is titled the "Immunities 
and Privileges Act." 
 
¶3. (SBU) After reviewing with Ambassador Youssif, point by point, 
U.S. State Department treatment of foreign diplomatic personnel in 
the United States (REFTEL);  we conclude that the MFA considers 
"member of the family" of American diplomats in Sudan to include the 
spouse of the member of the mission and his or her unmarried 
children under 21 years of age, who are not members of some other 
household, and who reside exclusively in the principal's household. 
The term "family" also includes children who may not be accompanying 
and actually residing in the home, but who join the household for 
visits or during holiday periods. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Poloff asked if Sudan recognizes unmarried partners as 
family members, Ambassador Youssif said "generally we don't, but we 
can consider it on a case by case basis, when we receive an official 
document from the diplomat's country government." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Regarding the question of same- sex marriage, Ambassador 
Youssif answered firmly that "it is not acceptable in Islam; and we 
follow the Islamic law (Sharia), so we do not recognize it." 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Youssif stated that he would query their embassy 
in Washington as to how the U.S. treats Sudanese diplomats with 
respect to such issues. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Embassy Khartoum point of contact for this subject is 
Pol/Econ officer Amina El-Bishlawy.
