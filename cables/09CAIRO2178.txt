SUBJECT: COPTIC CHOIR BOYS UNCOVERED AS INTENDING IMMIGRANTS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Cairo Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) uncovered a 
scheme to have young men pose as Coptic choir boys in order to be 
issued visas for travel to the United States. The applicants used 
bogus letters from churches in Egypt and the United States to 
facilitate the fraud. Egyptian State Security Investigative Services 
(SSIS) made arrests in the case. End Summary. 
 
Keen Eye of ELO starts the ball rolling 
--------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) An ELO doing visa interviews informed the Fraud Prevention 
Manager (FPM) of four different applicants he suspected of 
presenting bogus documentation. The A/RSO-I confirmed that the 
invitation letter from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Chicago 
was fraudulent by speaking directly with administrative staff there. 
FPU Investigators also spoke with a priest in Upper Egypt who 
claimed no knowledge of the letter. 
 
They can't sing or bake 
----------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) The FPM and A/RSO-I interviewed the four young men 
separately.  All admitted they were not part of a Coptic choir and 
one individual admitted that he had no knowledge of baking (his 
application listed him as the "baker of the holy bread.") They all 
stated they intended to permanently reside in the United States and 
they paid around USD 12,000 each to a travel agent in order to 
facilitate the fraud. The travel agent provided them with bogus 
documentation and coached them on what to say during the interview. 
All the applicants wanted to reside in the US for economic reasons, 
and they planned to go to a Coptic Church in the Chicago area for 
further assistance upon arrival. 
 
Arrests 
------- 
¶4. (SBU) The A/RSO-I alerted SSIS who arrested the four young men as 
they exited the Embassy, and subsequently arrested the owner of a 
local travel agency who was involved. During questioning by SSIS, 
this individual admitted to receiving the bogus documentation from 
another person who was also subsequently detained by SSIS. The 
second individual outlined a smuggling network that funneled young 
Coptic men out of Egypt to Spain, Australia and the United States. 
He stated that members of the Coptic Church provided assistance in 
the form of bogus invitation letters and church groups. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The FPM alerted counterparts at the Spanish and Australian 
embassies while using the CCD to find other possible cases fitting 
the profile. A text search located five other young men who were 
issued visas to travel as a Coptic Choir group with the same letters 
of invitation from churches in the United States and Upper Egypt. 
The Department of Homeland Security's Arrival Departure Information 
System (ADIS) showed two of the five had already traveled to the 
United States. Phone calls to the other three revealed the numbers 
on the DS-156 to be bogus. The visas were revoked electronically, 
lookouts created in CLASS and airline contacts informed. However, a 
week later the FPU found out that the young men had already traveled 
to the United States and promptly claimed asylum. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The FPU continues to investigate other possible church 
groups that may have been issued visas based on bogus documentation.
