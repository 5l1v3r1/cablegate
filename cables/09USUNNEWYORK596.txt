France also highlighted the IAEA report and the Committee's 
focus on Monchegorsk.  Russia and China expressed a 
commitment to resolving the Iran nuclear issue through 
dialogue.  Mexico placed the IAEA report in the context of 
Mexico's commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  On June 15, Japanese Perm Rep Takasu, chair of the Iran 
Sanctions Committee ("1737 Committee"), briefed the Security 
Council on the Committee's activities over the previous 
ninety days.  He spoke of the Committee's request to two 
Member States to provide information regarding a transfer of 
material in violation of paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 
(2007).  (NOTE: This incident involved the M/V Monchegorsk, a 
Cypriot-flagged vessel found shipping arms-related materiel 
from Iran to Syria in violation of Iran sanctions 
resolutions.  END NOTE).  Takasu noted that the states did 
not provide any information relevant to the transfer.  Takasu 
also referred to additional information recently received 
from the state that had first brought the Committee 
information on the incident; this new information, he said, 
was currently under review by the committee.  (NOTE: This was 
a reference to a recent letter from Cyprus reporting that 
some of the cargo belonged the Defense Industries 
Organization, an entity designated under resolution 1737. 
END NOTE). 
 
¶3. Ambassador DiCarlo said the United States shared the 
international community's concern over events in the 
aftermath of Iran's June 12 elections and highlighted the 
importance of respecting the rights of Iranian citizens to 
express themselves peacefully.  She pointed to the recent 
report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
Director General that contained "troubling findings" about 
Iran's continuing refusal to suspend its 
proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.  DiCarlo also 
emphasized the need to support the work of the Iran Sanctions 
Committee.  She welcomed the Committee's efforts to obtain 
information regarding the M/V Monchegorsk and referred to 
recently-received information suggesting that some of the 
cargo belonged to Iran's Defense Industries Organization, a 
designated entity under resolution 1737.  DiCarlo said that 
the United States remains committed to direct diplomacy with 
Iran to resolve issues of concern. 
 
¶4.  UK Charge Parham thanked Takasu for the Committee's work 
on the Monchegorsk, noting that the matter remains under 
Committee consideration and that he hopes the Committee can 
draw useful lessons from the matter.  He also emphasized the 
IAEA report and continuing Iranian non-compliance, adding 
that the UK hopes Iran will move quickly to take forward the 
offers of engagement by the United States and the 
international community.  French Perm Rep Ripert highlighted 
sections of the IAEA report that showed a lack of full 
cooperation.  He also noted the Monchegorsk, in particular 
the role of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line 
(IRISL), adding that the case is not finished and that the 
Committee needs to determine whether the cargo had any links 
to entities designated under other resolutions.  Ripert 
expressed support for the dual-track approach. 
 
¶5.  Russian Perm Rep Churkin said he hoped the Committee will 
continue to be guided by the spirit and letter of the Iran 
sanctions resolutions.  Moreover, he said, Russia was working 
to resume dialogue with Iran and hoped to assist the IAEA 
verify that Iran's nuclear program had no military aspects. 
 
¶6.  Chinese Political Coordinator La emphasized that the 
Iranian nuclear issue has implications for both the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and stability in the Middle East. 
He stressed the need for a continued response to this problem 
through diplomatic means.  Mexican Perm Rep Heller emphasized 
his country's commitment to a nuclear free world and said 
that proliferation could not exist if nuclear weapons did not 
exist.  Heller also referred to the June 5 IAEA report, 
adding that the Iran issue meant a "possible delay in a world 
free of nuclear weapons."
