¶1. (SBU) On June 30, EconOffs conveyed reftel A and B points 
to Wendy Chung, Principal Assistant Secretary, and Anna Chor, 
Assistant Secretary, at the Hong Kong Government's (HKG) 
Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB).  Chung 
confirmed that CEDB will take the lead in drafting the HKG's 
implementation guidelines for UNSCR 1874, but awaits guidance 
from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Chung 
summarized Hong Kong's UNSCR implementation process, 
indicating that after China's MFA provides its guidance, CEDB 
will draft implementation guidelines, obtain interagency 
concurrence, then forward the proposal to Hong Kong's 
Executive Council (ExCo) for final approval.  Approved 
guidelines are then gazetted for legal implementation.  Chung 
added that the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department 
(HKCED) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) would be 
the primary enforcement agencies for the provisions contained 
in UNSCR 1874. 
 
¶2. (SBU) EconOffs met same day with HKMA's Nelson Man, 
Executive Director for Banking Supervision Department, and 
Raymond Chan, Head of Banking Policy, to convey reftel B 
points and deliver the June 18 U.S. Treasury Department 
Advisory on DPRK's illicit financial activities.  Man 
emphasized that the banks operating in Hong Kong consider any 
North Korean entity as "high risk," generally avoid 
transactions with North Korean entities, and exercise added 
due diligence when dealing with North Korea, in keeping with 
existing legal obligations (i.e., UNSCR 1718, etc.)  He 
welcomed the Treasury Advisory, as the list of North Korean 
banks contained therein would be useful to increase banks 
awareness. 
 
¶3. (SBU) EconOffs also provided reftel A and B 
points/non-papers to Macau's Monetary Authority President 
Anselmo Teng and Macau's Financial Intelligence Unit Head 
Deborah Ng on June 30.
