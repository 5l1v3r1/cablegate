¶1.  (SBU)  Summary: The African Union Mediation team 
presented the draft Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) to the 
parties on April 25.  The long-awaited comprehensive package 
was unveiled in a press event at which AU Special Envoy 
stated that the AU mediation paper constituted a "just basis" 
for a negotiated setttlement that respects the unity and 
sovereignty of Sudan.  Salim noted that neither side will be 
happy with the document and it is now up to the parties to 
negotiate with each other.  He also urged the international 
partners to help the parties close the deal.  USDEL has urged 
the parties, particularly the movements, to read the document 
carefully before reacting.  An electronic version of the DPA 
was sent to AF, AF/RSA, AF/SPG, and D on April 25.  USDEL 
urges that Department press spokesman call for a rapid 
conclusion of negotiations in the April 26 press briefing 
(see para 5).  End Summary.

¶2.  (SBU) Prior to the evening plenary at which the AU 
presented the DPA to the parties, AU Special Envoy Dr. Salim 
Salim told international partners that despite the deep 
suspicions that remain between the parties, the talks have 
gained momentum in the past few weeks and that the mediation 
team's goal was to meet the April 30 deadline for a peace 
deal.  He admitted that the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and 
Consultations part of the agreement was the least fleshed out 
but that it was included in the document  alim old the 
partners that the AU had done its work and that after the 
presentation of the document to the parties, it is time for 
the parties to negotiate with each other.  Neither side will 
be satisfied with the document, but the AU tried to be as 
even-handed as possible in developing mechanisms to address 
the demands of both sides.  In developing the proposals, 
Salim said that the AU was guided by the principle of 
maintaining the unity, territorial integrity, and sovereignty 
of Sudan as a guiding principle for the mediation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Salim, the draft Darfur Peace 
Agreement (DPA) will be known as the "Abuja Peace Agreement" 
after it is accepted by all parties.  Salim was unclear on 
what happens after the parties are given the draft, but 
stated that there would be no plenaries to discuss the draft 
and that the parties would have to work with each other to 
reach agreement.  USDEL expressed support for the mediation's 
work and reminded the partners of the need to address the 
fears of the movements for their future after an agreement 
was signed. Other partners also expressed their support for 
the AU document. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In the late evening on April 25, the AU presented 
the document in a poorly arranged plenary with press 
coverage.  Sudan Liberation Movement faction leader Minni 
Minnawi was informed fifteen minutes prior to the event, and 
Abdelwahid Nur was absent because he was outside the hotel at 
the time of the event.  Salim opened by acknowledging the 
deep suspicions between the parties.  He told the parties 
that three principles guided the AU's work.  First, the 
maintenance of the unity and sovereignty of Sudan as a member 
state of the AU.  Second, the AU is sympathetic to the 
articulation by the movements of the human tragedy in Darfur. 
 Third, the AU is not neutral on the suffering of victims and 
its efforts have been biased toward the plight of refugees 
and internally-displaced persons, especially the plight of 
women and children.  He urged the parties to overcome the 
challenges presented by the deteriorating security situation 
on the ground and their own maximilist positions.  Salim gave 
the parties two days (until April 27) to present their 
reactions on the document to the AU mediation and expressed 
his hope the parties would sign the peace deal as soon as 
possible.

¶5.  (U)  Suggested Points for Press Statement: A strong 
statement can generate pressure on the parties to stay in 
Abuja to resolve the remaining issues.  Such a statement 
could: welcome the mediation's proposal and describe it as a 
just and workable basis for ending the conflict in Darfur; 
condemn the recent escalation of violence in Darfur; call on 
the parties to engage directly to resolve their remaining

differences over the text before the April 30 deadline; and, 
reaffirm USG support for a negotiated solution and for a 
stronger peace-keeping mission in Darfur.
