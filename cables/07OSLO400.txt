Â¶1.  (SBU) Deputy Pol/Econ Counselor delivered ref A points on 
April 19 to Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry Senior 
Advisor Hege Gabrielsen.  Gabrielsen was already informed 
about the U.S. initiative to institute a common OECD line to 
restrict new export credits to Iran and said Norway can 
support the policy.  She noted that the Norwegian government 
has formally closed the window for sovereign credits to the 
Iranian government, with the exception of humanitarian 
credits, in response to UNSC 1747.  As reported in reftel B, 
Norway's Guarantee Institute for Export Credit (GIEK) was no 
longer accepting applications for export credits respecting 
the government of Iran even before UNSC 1747.  Gabrielsen 
added that Norway will be represented at next week's export 
credit association plenary at the OECD by Trade Ministry 
Deputy Director General Arnt Egil Ursin, Ministry Higher 
Executive Officer Tyri Stuge, and Johann Mowinckle, Chief of 
the Country Risk Department at GIEK.
