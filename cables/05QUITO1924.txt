¶1.  (SBU) PolChief conveyed reftel points urging continued 
Ecuadorian military support for the UN Stabilization Mission 
in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to VFM Marcelo Fernandez de Cordova on 
February 17. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Fernandez said he would not attend the 
vice-ministerial meeting in Santiago August 19; the GOE would 
be represented by its local ambassador. Fernandez said that 
the agenda for discussion on Haiti for the Santiago meeting 
was very general--and claimed to be unaware that any Latin 
American troop contributors intend to discuss early 
withdrawal of forces from Haiti. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) For its part, the MFA fully supports the U.S. 
position that troops should not be withdrawn until local 
conditions in Haiti permit.  The GOE recently sent a second 
contingent of 66 Army engineers to Haiti for a six-month 
deployment.  Fernandez said he would confirm with GOE 
military leadership that there is no intention to withdraw 
them prematurely. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) DAO military contacts confirm that the GOE is 
planning to replace the current troop contingent in Haiti in 
November. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  GOE engagement in Haiti was done through 
a joint agreement with close Ecuadorian ally Chile, and the 
GOE is likely to continue to follow Chile's lead there.  We 
will continue to encourage the GOE to stay the course in 
Haiti in support of MINUSTAH.
