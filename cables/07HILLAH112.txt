SUBJECT: KARBALA POLICE CHIEF TARGET OF JAYSH AL-MAHDI 
 
1.(U) This is a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) Karbala 
sensitive but unclassified cable. 
 
2.(SBU) On July 25 at approximately 8 a.m. PRT Karbala received 
reports that the Karbala Police Chief, BG Ra'id Shakir Jawdat's 
convoy was struck by an IED when it was traveling from his home 
in al-Hindiyah to Karbala city.  The IED exploded in the 
Babtwareej area of Karbala city killing members of the Police 
Chief's protective detail in an area reported by locally engaged 
staff to be a Jaysh al-Mahdi strong hold.  Only a few hours 
before the Provincial Council of Karbala voted to remove the 
Police Chief.  BG Ra'id claims to be preventing militia 
activity, reducing the militia presence in the police force, 
limiting Provincial Council influence on police hiring practices 
and reducing the size of security details assigned to Provincial 
Council members.  Any of these reasons is cause enough to incite 
the Provincial Council to remove him from his position. 
 
3.(SBU) Reportedly, leading the effort to remove BG Raid Shakir 
Jawdat from the police chief position is Hamid Ganoosh Jasim the 
number two Jaysh al-Mahdi leader, Provincial Council (PC) member 
and head of the PC Committee on Municipalities.  At this time it 
remains unclear if the central government has been officially 
notified about his removal.  CPA 71 requires that the Provincial 
Council Chairman (PCC) sign the removal order before it can be 
delivered to the Ministry of Interior and the Prime Minister. 
The PCC, rumored to be Sadrist leaning and a fierce independent, 
is most likely caught between pressures from the Sadrist PC 
member Hamid Ganoosh Jasim and the knowledge that it is unlikely 
that the removal order will be approved by the central 
government.  BG Ra'id Shakir Jawdat moved to Karbala with MG 
Mohammed in October of 2006 to serve as the Deputy Police Chief. 
 Following the April 2007 dual car bombs in the city the former 
Police Chief was reassigned elsewhere.   With the blessing of 
the Prime Minister BG Ra'id was promoted and installed as the 
Karbala Chief.  Locally engaged staff report that the previous 
Police Chief faced similar threats and pressures by the 
Provincial Council when he attempted to implement regulations 
similar to BG Ra'id's changes.
