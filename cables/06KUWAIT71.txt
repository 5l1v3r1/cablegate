¶1.  (SBU) Summary: A U.S. businessman told Ambassador on 
January 8 that the Kuwaiti company he works for had just been 
awarded a contract by Kuwait's Ministry of Health to install 
fifteen radiation monitoring systems throughout Kuwait.  He 
said that these systems could be used to monitor for any 
radiation from nuclear activities throughout the region, 
"from Israel to Iran."  He continued that his company was 
also hoping to sign a contract to sell the Ministry of 
Health, and other Gulf country health ministries, IOSAT, a 
thyroid-blocking medication used in the event of a nuclear 
emergency.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) U.S. businessman and long-time Post contact Emad 
Al-Zaben, General Manager of Bader Sultan and Brothers 
Company (BSBC), a leading Kuwaiti importer of high-end 
medical and scientific equipment from the United States, met 
with Ambassador on January 8.  Al-Zaben said his firm was 
recently awarded a Ministry of Health contract to install a 
radiation monitoring system in Kuwait.  Using gamma, alpha 
and beta radiation sensors (manufactured by Meridian, 
CT-based Canberra Industries), BSBC will install fifteen 
gamma monitors, alpha/beta radiation probes and related 
meteorological equipment throughout Kuwait.  This 
installation will provide real-time and historical record 
taking of potential reactor and other nuclear accidents or 
events.  The first phase will include the erection of the 
monitoring units at various medical facilities throughout 
Kuwait and at border sites.  In phase two, BSBC hopes to 
provide one or more mobile units for ambient gamma 
monitoring.  The combined system will connect via GPS, 
telemetry and a communications unit for centralized data 
collection. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Al-Zaben said that the first phase of the system 
would be operational by June 2006, and would be able to 
monitor radiation "from Israel to Iran."  He noted that, 
using existing equipment installed previously, the Ministry 
of Health had detected radiation levels from nuclear tests in 
Pakistan.  Al-Zaben provided a hand-out and CD with 
additional details.  (We will pouch a copy to DoS Kuwait Desk 
Officer David Berns.)  He added that a similar system was 
being installed in Oman, and that a previous system installed 
in Saudi Arabia by a German and Czech consortium was "a 
complete failure." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Al-Zaben also displayed packets of IOSAT, an 
FDA-approved brand of potassium iodide tablet that is used as 
a thyroid-blocking medication in the event of a radiation 
emergency.  He said that BSBC had obtained the exclusive 
license to sell IOSAT in the Gulf and that he was close to a 
deal with the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health to purchase enough 
IOSAT for the entire population.  He said that he was working 
on similar deals in other Gulf countries. 
 
¶5.  (U) BSBC is a major Kuwait importer of pharmaceuticals, 
advanced medical/diagnostic devices, and scientific 
laboratory equipment.  The firm represents key U.S. interests 
including Perkin Elmer, E.I. Du Pont, Boston Scientific, 
Cooper Surgical, Eli Lilly, Merck and CR Bard.  The company 
is divided into several divisions including medical 
equipment, pharmaceuticals, laboratory equipment, consumer 
health products and O&M services.
