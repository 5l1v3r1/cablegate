REF: Khartoum 2224 
 
¶1.  As the ceasefire between the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and 
the Ugandan government increasingly takes hold, UN Under Secretary 
General (UN/USG) for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland visited Juba 
to meet with the parties to the talks and assess ways that the UN 
could further support the peace process.  Egeland also strongly 
encouraged donor nations to do more.  Emphasizing that the 
negotiations should remain an African process with African 
solutions, the best way to lend support would be to assist with the 
USD 5.9 million that will be needed to maintain the talks, fully 
implement the Cessation of Hostilities agreement, and provide 
humanitarian support to vulnerables.  Norway has already agreed to 
give USD 250,000.  Egeland then emphasized that there is no conflict 
between supporting the ICC and supporting the peace process, and 
that countries must only refrain from endorsing impunity, not peace. 
 (NOTE:  Several members of the mediation team have also indicated a 
desire for U.S. involvement in the talks.  End Note.) 
 
¶2.  During his visit, Egeland was in frequent phone contact with LRA 
commander Vincent Otti, who had arrived at the Western Equatoria 
rally point of Ri-Kwangba.  The UN/USG had hoped to secure an 
agreement from the LRA to release the women and children so they can 
receive humanitarian assistance from the UN, as the UN will not 
provide direct assistance to anyone still part of an armed group. 
After initial indications that the LRA would release the 
vulnerables, they finally refused.  Egeland believes Joseph Kony 
intervened directly to prevent this release.  At the Eastern 
Equatoria rally point, Owiny-ki-Bul, LRA mediation team 
representatives indicated they would allow women and children to be 
separated from the main group, but would not allow them to be 
completely released.  There may also be other special arrangements 
for the sick and wounded. 
 
¶3.  As more people move towards the camps, with nearly 400 LRA 
soldiers about to enter Owiny-ki-Bul and more on their way, Egeland 
believes the numbers will be significantly higher than expected. 
According to MONUC, the groups of LRA fighters are larger, more 
professional, and better armed (with platoon-level machine guns and 
mortars) than originally thought.  The UN/USG thinks there may be 4 
to 6 thousand people in the camps by the end of next week.
