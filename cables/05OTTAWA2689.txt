     ¶B. OTTAWA 2638 
     ¶C. STATE 162270 
 
 ¶1.  We continue to receive offers of assistance and are 
referring all Canadian donors, public and private, to: 
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada (PSEPC) at 
1-800-929-1705 or 613-991-7000; goc-cog@psepc-sppcc.gc.ca 
 
¶2.  PSEPC suggests that corporations that are interested in 
selling supplies for the relief effort (rather than donating) 
contact: 
John Bonar at International Trade Canada at 613-944-8821. 
 
¶3.  The contact for public health matters, including 
transport of human vaccines, is: 
Public Health Canada -  Ops center is 613-952-1955, duty 
officer is 1-800-545-7661. 
 
For public-health-related queries during working hours

¶4.  Foreign Affairs Canada provided more information on 
Canadians in Louisiana and Mississippi.  They are in contact 
with 4 Canadians in Louisiana who are still in the affected 
area (including two working in a hospital, one in police 
training who plan to stay).  There are 7 whom they have not 
been able to contact, but they believe they have left the 
affected area and 11 they believe may be in the affected area 
who have not been contacted, usually due to lack of adequate 
detail provided by callers.  They are concerned about the 
impact of the recent evacuation order on those Canadians who 
plan to stay in New Orleans. 
 
All 14 Canadians in Mississippi are residents.  They have not 
had contact with 4 they believe are still in the affected 
area and one who they believe has left.  They are in contact 
with 3 who are still in the affected area. 
 
 
¶5.  The Canadian Red Cross contacted post for guidance on how 
to handle welfare and whereabouts requests from Americans in 
Canada or regarding Canadians in the U.S. We suggested they 
contact Foreign Affairs Canada's operations center 
(613-996-8885) or the State Department Operations Center, 
depending on the nationality of the missing person. The Red 
Cross is also receiving offers from Canadians to take in 
Katrina victims and we are suggesting such offers be made 
through PSEPC. 
 
EMS/paramedic network 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. The EMS Chiefs of Canada has 150-200 paramedics who could 
be deployed immediately to the affected region or to other 
states to backfill US teams.  They could also be called on in 
the future to replace teams who might be suffering burnout. 
Hal Newman in Montreal (514-697-1470) has coordinated a 
network of rescue workers across the country, encouraging 
them to register with PSEPC.  In addition the the EMS Chiefs 
mentioned above, there are dozens of professional 
organizations interested in helping.  Their offer was made 
six days ago (affiliated with Beryl Wajsman and the Institute 
of Public Affairs of Montreal) but there has been no US 
response yet.  Interested states or organizations could 
contact PSEPC at the number in para 1, or contact Mr. Newman 
directly. 
 
Newman reports that Convergence Communications of St. Louis 
has offered them a registry data base and they plan to make 
that website available to participants. 
 
Federal Government 
------------------ 
 
¶7.  The Speaker of the Canadian Senate sent a letter to 
Senator Ted Stevens, with a copy to the Ambassador, 
expressing sympathy, condolences, and reiterating the desire 
of Canadians to do whatever is possible. 
 
 
Province of Quebec 
------------------ 
¶8.  Hydro-Quebec (the electric company) offered any 
assistance needed.  The Quebec government tells us H-Q has a 
large stock of generators.  We are encouraging them to 
coordinate with the GOC. 
Province of Nova Scotia 
----------------------- 
 
¶9.  Nova Scotia Power offered assistance to Louisiana, 
Mississippi and Alabama, referencing their gratitude for U.S. 
assistance after Hurrican Juan in 2003.  The contact person 
is Ralph Tedesco, Chief Operating Officer at 902-428-6109 or 
ralph.tedesco@emera.com 
 
Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation stores are collecting Katrina 
donations at their 108 outlets. 
 
University 
---------- 
 
¶10.  According to a press release, Acadia University in 
Wolfville, Nova Scotia, will provide full tuition and free 
residence accomodations to five students and will make 100 
seats available to American students at reduced cost.  The 
university is developing a strategy to assist with travel 
costs and expedite visas.  Undergraduates affected by Katrina 
and interested in this offer should contact the dean of 
students at hurricane.relief@acadiau.ca 
 
¶11.  We have heard that McGill University has offered to 
accept students from Tulane University and other Canadian 
schools are making similar offers. 
 
Private Sector 
-------------- 
 
¶12.  Claude Marois, a Quebec businessman, called CG Quebec 
City to offer Katrina victims his entire production of 
interior wooden doors.  He said he is prepared to send 750 
doors at a profit cut of 20% to help with reconstruction in 
Louisiana.  The CG referred him to Habitat for Humanity 
Canada and PSEPC. 
 
¶13.  Gaetan St-Jean, president of the Cooperative des 
technicians ambulanciers de Quebec (CTAQ), called to offer 50 
emergency relief/paramedics and possibly several ambulances. 
He was referred to PSEPC and the Canadian Red Cross.
