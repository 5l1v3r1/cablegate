¶1. (SBU) Summary: In Christian dominated East Nusa Tenggara 
(NTT), Muslim residents play an important political role.  The 
Chairman of NTT's Indonesian Islamic Council told visitors from 
ConGen Surabaya that relations between religious and ethnic 
communities have stabilized on the island of West Timor since 
the influx of refugees from neighboring Timor Leste.  While 
political party support follows ethnic/religious lines, 
perceptions of good governance often outweigh such affiliations. 
 Increased dialogue has led to increased cooperation to help the 
neediest members of the community.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Pol/Econ officer and Pol/Econ Assistant met with the 
Chairman of NTT's Indonesian Islamic Council at his boarding 
school, orphanage and radio studio in Kupang on 2 October. 
Abdul Kadir Makarim told us that relations between religious and 
ethnic communities in NTT have largely stabilized after seven 
years of friction, heightened by the arrival of refugees from 
areas bordering newly independent Timor Leste.  Support for 
political parties has tended to follow sectarian lines in NTT; 
however local races have proven that voters are willing to cross 
religious lines to elect a solid candidate. 
 
In a Forest of Church Steeples, Muslims Still Matter 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) While the religious center of gravity in NTT is 
overwhelmingly Christian, the Muslim population is still an 
important factor in NTT political life.  NTT's provincial 
statistics show a mix unique to this Catholic majority province: 
Catholics 53%, Protestants 33%, and Muslims 9%. Makarim insisted 
that the number of Muslims throughout NTT, and particularly in 
Kupang, was higher, perhaps 13%.  He suggested that Muslims who 
have moved from other provinces and kept their residence cards 
have not been captured in national statistics.  Makarim 
speculated that in Kupang alone the Muslim population is as high 
as 25%.  This is due to a large number of business people and 
civil servants from majority Muslim areas of Indonesia. 
 
What Kind of Christian Does a Muslim Vote For? 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. (SBU)  NTT's majority parties, Golkar (with 37% in the last 
election) and  the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle 
(PDI-P with 19%) tend to draw support from the majority of NTT's 
Protestants and Catholics respectively.  We asked Makarim, 
himself a Golkar member for some 30 years, who Muslims 
supported.  He explained that Muslims supported Christian 
candidates with a solid good governance platform, although there 
is some support for Islamic parties - National Awakening Party 
(PKB) has four seats and Crescent Star Party (PPP) one seat in 
the 55-seat provincial house of representatives. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Makarim used Kupang's Mayor Daniel Adoe, a  protestant 
and former Golkar cadre, to illustrate.  Adoe left Golkar and 
beat the anointed Golkar candidate with the strong support of a 
swing vote from the Islamic PKB.  Adoe's reputation for clean 
government and plans for artesian wells in the municipality were 
the cornerstones of his success, Makarim explained.  Makarim 
himself was offered, but has not accepted, an offer by PDI-P to 
run for Vice Governor alongside the Protestant Candidate Frans 
Leburaya.  The ability of NTT candidates to agree on strategy 
and form coalitions across religious lines reflects a pragmatic 
approach to political life and a trend away from religion-based 
parties according to Makarim. 
 
The Voice of HAM 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Makarim owns and operates Suara HAM 88.5 FM, a radio 
station with the signal strength to reach listeners within a 45 
km radius of Kupang.  The name "Suara HAM" means "the sound of 
Human Rights" in Indonesian.  Makarim explained that advertisers 
are reluctant to buy spots on a station solely focused on human 
rights issues so he often says that these are simply his 
initials; H. A. M.  A music request program was in progress 
during our meeting; however discussion and call-in talk shows 
that address the concerns of religious communities are frequent 
themes.  Makarim attributes the frequency and quality of 
dialogue among religious groups to an increase in cooperation 
and harmony among NTT's religious communities.  While charity 
was once provided by each group to its own neediest members, now 
charity and food aid is distributed without regard to religious
