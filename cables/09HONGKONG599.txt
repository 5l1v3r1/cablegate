SUBJECT: HONG KONG AIMS LOW ON AIR QUALITY STANDARDS 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  The Hong Kong Government has proposed the 
adoption of World Heath Organization (WHO) Tier 1 Interim 
Target Air Quality Standards for three of four major 
pollutant categories.  The full adoption of WHO Air Quality 
Goals is a long-term objective.  Hong Kong NGOs and civic 
groups are crying foul at the recommendations, claiming the 
proposed WHO Tier 1 Standards are designed for developing 
countries that lack resources or capabilities, do not 
consider the full impact of pollution on public health, and 
are inappropriate for Hong Kong. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: The NGOs make a good point.  Current Hong 
Kong air pollution levels for sulphur dioxide, one of the 
categories proposed for WHO Tier 1 adoption, are already well 
under the limit set by the WHO Tier 1 Standard and very close 
to meeting the WHO Air Quality Goal (AQG); it would be 
relatively easy to meet the AQG with expected improvements 
from already programmed projects.  The HKG-sponsored study 
backing the standards claims to be driven by public health 
concerns but contains no health impact data or analysis, 
instead focusing on economic analysis explaining why stricter 
standards are too painful to adopt.  NGOs privately speculate 
that the low standards proposed by the HKG anticipate future 
overall air pollution increases resulting from major 
infrastructure projects like the Hong Kong/Zhuhai Bridge. 
Early studies suggest that, once complete, this bridge alone 
could bring an additional 10,000 mainland Chinese trucks to 
Hong Kong's shipping terminals daily, introducing a 
significant new stream of air pollution into the city. END 
COMMENT. 
 
Adoption of WHO Air Quality Standards 
------------------------------------- 
¶3. (U) On March 20, the HKG Environmental Protection 
Department (EPD) formally released the results of an 18-month 
review of Hong Kong's Air Quality Objectives (AQO) and 
proposed a plan for the development of a long-term air 
quality strategy for Hong Kong. (Hong Kong's current AQO's 
have not been reviewed or modified since 1987.)  Advance 
copies of the study, completed by a private consultancy 
group, were provided to the Legislative Council (LegCo) on 
March 19.  The public eagerly anticipated the release; an 
EPD-organized press conference drew a crowd of approximately 
450 people.  The plan's release begins a one-month public 
consultation period during which the recommendations can be 
modified before they are formally adopted as Hong Kong's new 
Air Quality Standards. 
¶4. (U) Hong Kong plans to replace its current 1987 standards 
by adopting WHO AQOs, but generally at Interim Target (IT) 
levels.  These ITs were designed in three tiers by the WHO as 
stepping stones to assist countries reach the a final WHO Air 
Quality Goals (AQG) deemed as the minimum standards necessary 
by the WHO to protect public health.  Under the plan, Hong 
Kong will adopt WHO ITs or AQGs for the following pollutants: 
- Sulphur Dioxide ) IT-1 (125 Micrograms per Cubic Meter per 
24 hrs) 
- Respirable Suspended Particulates (PM10) ) IT-2 (100 
Micrograms per Cubic Meter per 24 hrs) 
- Fine Respirable Suspended Particulates (PM2.5) ) IT-1 (75 
Micrograms per Cubic Meter per 24 hrs) 
- Nitrogen Dioxide ) WHO AQG (200 Micrograms per Cubic Meter 
per 1 hr) 
- Ozone ) IT-1 (160 Micrograms per Cubic Meter per 8 hrs) 
- Carbon Monoxide ) WHO AQG (30,000 Micrograms per Cubic 
Meter per 1 hr) 
- Lead ) WHO AQG (.5 Micrograms per Cubic Meter per 1 yr) 
 
(NOTE: Hong Kong's air quality is already within the WHO AQG 
for both carbon monoxide and lead and very close to the AQG 
of 20 micrograms per cubic meter per 24 hrs for sulphur 
dioxide, on most days measuring at 22. There are no WHO ITs 
for nitrogen dioxide. END NOTE.) 
 
¶5. (U) To achieve these new AQOs, the study recommended 36 
steps or actions which could be taken to reduce emissions and 
provided a cost-benefit analysis on each of these to 
determine the financial impact if accepted.  Specific 
recommendations ranged from increasing the use of natural gas 
in local electricity generation to 50% (already a stated 
goal), to the mandatory implementation of building energy 
codes, to a 25% reduction of parking spaces in Hong Kong's 
Central Business District to discourage commuters from 
driving into the city.  The study also recommends that the 
full adoption of WHO AQGs be pursued as Hong Kong's stated 
long-term aspirational goal while taking progressive steps to 
tighten adopted AQOs.  The study did not make a firm 
recommendation on the interval between AQO reviews, but noted 
that about every five years was the normal international 
practice.

The NGO and Civic Organization Response 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) NGOs and civic organization reacted to the study 
politely but are clearly disappointed.  Many of those present 
had pushed hard for the adoption of WHO AQOs and expressed 
frustration at the recommendation to adopt the lowest 
possible or T-1 Standards.  Questioners pointed out that Hong 
Kong's air quality already significantly exceeds the entry 
level standards for some pollutants and, despite the claim 
that public health was the key parameter for determining the 
new AQOs, health was not mentioned in the text and did not 
appear to be a factor in the analysis.  In response to these 
criticisms, EPD representatives said the raw data and 
underlying assumptions used by the consultation firm in their 
analysis would be made available to the public.  Public input 
and comments will be solicited through the end of April. 
Final AQOs will be submitted to LegCo for review in May and 
are expected to implemented by the end of 2009.
