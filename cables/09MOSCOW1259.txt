REFTELS: REQUEST #4210001; DATED 4/09/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the foreign purchaser, FSUE FEA 
Radioexport, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
applications: NLR as the ultimate consignee of (PSV A) digital 
oscilloscopes instruments and apparatus with a recording device, 
(PSV B) digital oscilloscopes instruments and apparatus with a 
recording device, model no: WAVEPRO 7200. These items are controlled 
for nuclear non-proliferation and anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 
3A292 and 3A992. The licensee is LeCroy Corporation, 700 Chestnut 
Ridge Road, Spring Valley, NY 109776. 
 
¶3. On May 13, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of FSUE FEA Radioexport, Moscow, Russia. 
The export control team met with Sergey Sobolev, Deputy General 
Director and Igor Streguchevsky, Deputy Director, Candidate of 
Science. 
 
¶4. The Federal State Unitary Enterprise (FSUE) Foreign Economic 
Associate (FEA) Radioexport was founded in 1966.  FSUE FEA 
Radioexport is 100% government owned, has approximately 54 employees 
and was established to export Soviet manufactured televisions and 
radios.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union FSUE FEA Radioexport 
ceased all exports and now only imports electronic components, 
software, measuring and computing instruments, primarily from the 
United States.  FSUE FEA RadioexportQs main customers are other 
state owned enterprises, ministries and research centers. 
 
¶5. Sergey Sobolev, Deputy General Director of FSUA FEA Radioexport, 
stated that the subject commodity was purchased from LeCroy as stock 
for in-house testing and evaluation to assess its marketability in 
Russia.  Sobolev advised the export control team that LeCroy 
measuring equipment is not well established on the Russian market. 
Of the 4 LeCroy oscilloscopes purchased by FSUE FEA Radioexport, 
three are out at a testing lab being evaluated and one was available 
to the export control team for inspection. The export control team 
was escorted to a secure storage facility at FSUE FEA Radioexport 
where one LeCroy oscilloscope, serial no. LCRY0612M23439, was 
stored.  Sobolev advised the export control team that the other 
three LeCroy oscilloscopes will be made available for inspection at 
any time if requested. 
 
¶6. The export control team found no indications of impropriety at 
FSUE FEA Radioexport.  The consigneeQs answers were not evasive. It 
appears that the subject commodity is being used for which it was 
licensed. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends FSUE FEA Radioexport, Moscow, 
Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
