(SBU) Embassy Officials spoke with Jarmila Povejsilova of the 
Czech MFA Office of the Americas related to the recent 
anti-democratic developments in Venezuela.  She acknowledged 
that the Czech government is following the proposed 
constitutional changes and the growing dissent within 
Venezuela and that they quite clearly see the worrying 
international implications of this trend.  Povejsilova also 
indicated that Venezuela is on the minds of many EU member 
states and Venezuela be discussed at the early December EU 
Working Group Meeting on Latin America.
