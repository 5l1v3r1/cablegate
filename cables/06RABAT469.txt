¶1.  (SBU) Econoff met March 14 with Moroccan Ministry 
of Finance official Abdelaziz Khaoua discuss terrorism 
finance-related issues and to deliver reftel demarche 
concerning the charities discussion at the MENA-FATF 
plenary in Cairo next week. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Khaoua was receptive to demarche and 
confirmed his attendance at the event.  He explained 
Morocco does not have many international charities; 
most of them are local charities that raise money "from 
Moroccans for Moroccans."  Nonetheless, charities in 
Morocco are closely monitored.  New charities are 
required to register with the Ministry of Interior 
through local authorities.  Charities' financial 
accounting is reported directly to the office of the 
Secretary General of Government (SGG).  Khaoua told 
 
SIPDIS 
Econoff that he looks forward to exchanging ideas on 
the subject with his regional colleagues in Egypt. 
 
¶3.  (U)  GOM has participated in previous regional 
meetings of MENA-FATF. Post will continue to encourage 
GOM to actively participate in MENA-FATF activities and 
initiatives.
