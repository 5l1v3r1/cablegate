SUBJECT: SPAIN ON REQUEST FOR STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT FOR 
INDIA CIVIL NUCLEAR COOPERATION INITIATIVE AT OCTOBER 2006 
NSG MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 140484 
 
(SBU)  ESTHOFF made reftel points August 28 to newly-arrived 
MFA Disarmament Affairs Deputy Director General Ignacio 
Sanchez, requesting that Spain make a statement in support 
when the subject of civil nuclear cooperation with India is 
discussed at the October 11-12 Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) 
Consultative Group (GC) meeting in Vienna.  Sanchez told 
ESTHOFF September 14 that Spain continues to believe that the 
U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative is a net plus 
for the international nonproliferation regime and would so 
state at the NSG/GC.  Sanchez said that Spain had been 
pushing for a common EU position (and statement) in favor of 
the initiative, but this was blocked due to opposition from 
several member states including Sweden.  Sweden and others 
continue to insist that India first sign the NPT, while Spain 
and others argue that embracing India in the NSG and 
elsewhere would eventually lead to India joining the NPT. 
Sanchez said that India's solid nonproliferation credentials 
(as compared to Pakistan, for example) were a key factor in 
Spain's decision to support the Civil Nuclear Cooperation 
Initiative.
