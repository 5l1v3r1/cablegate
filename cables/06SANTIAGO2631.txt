SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ 
 
 
¶1. On December  23, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (Sat. 
circ. 195,626) ran an editorial entitled "The Complex U.S. Scenario 
in Iraq."  Quote: 
 
¶2. "Many compare the conflict in Vietnam to the situation in Iraq 
today....  The comparison comes from the growing feeling that it is 
impossible to win the war in Iraq and that it is necessary to 
withdraw....  A more in depth analysis shows that the 
comparison...has to do with the view the U.S. elite has of the role 
the United States must play in the world.  This is an old debate 
between 'realists' and 'idealists'....  Today everything seems to 
show that just as in Vietnam, in Iraq the realists will be the ones 
to finally design the strategy to withdraw.  Representing the 
realists is the Baker Commission, which has called for a military 
withdrawal in 2008 and has proposed to begin contacts with (Iraq's) 
neighbors to stabilize Iraq through diplomacy.  The White House 
would do well in remembering the lessons of 'departing with honor' 
that realists Nixon and Kissinger designed for the U.S. in Vietnam, 
so that it does not make the same mistakes."
