SUBJECT:  PST BAGHDAD:  SADR CITY DISTRICT COUNCIL 
ESTABLISHES PERMANENT FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING COMMITTEE 
 
¶1. The Sadr City District Council (DC) in the last 3 
months has established a Finance and Accounting 
Committee.  The committee is modeled after guidelines 
given to it by the U.S. Military.  The committee has 
three staff members. 
 
¶2. This DC subcommittee is using a computer accounting 
system along with hard copy book ledgers and journals 
to track income and expenditures.  It has opened a 
deposit account at the Al Warka'a Bank, a private bank 
in Sadr City.  Procedures to handle incoming and 
outgoing funds have been created and implemented. 
 
¶3. Incoming revenue is recorded in receipt books 
supplied by the Baghdad Provincial Council (PC).  These 
books are maintained solely by the Finance and 
Accounting Committee.  The DC is responsible for 
allocating the revenue as follows: one-third to the 
Baghdad PC, one-third for DC expenses, and one-third 
for the neighborhood councils. 
 
¶4. Comment.  The Sadr City DC's implementation of these 
accounting practices is significant because very few 
DCs have systems in place to account properly for 
incoming and outgoing funds.  PRT Baghdad plans to help 
the Baghdad PC establish financial accountability 
systems at the other DCs within Baghdad Province.
