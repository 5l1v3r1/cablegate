SUBJECT: MOZAMBIQUE: PROMOTING THE EU RESOLUTION ON THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN SUDAN 
 
REF: STATE 248093 
 
On November 23 economic/political section chief delivered 
reftel demarche to Antonio Macateve, Chief of the 
Multilateral Affairs Department, Directorate of International 
Organizations and Conferences, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Macateve replied to the demarche by saying that, despite the 
GRM's support for the African Union peacekeeping effort in 
Darfur, his government usually did not find it useful to 
"point the finger" at an African government over human rights 
violations. His government usually abstained from voting on 
such human rights violations. He implied that the GRM would 
abstain on the upcoming EU resolution on Sudan.
