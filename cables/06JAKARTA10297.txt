 ¶1. (U) The trial of the seven men accused of killing two 
Amcits in Timika, Papua in 2002 crept along August 15 in 
spite of the defendants' continued refusal to take their 
assigned seats in the court and the absence of defense 
attorney Johnson Panjaitan.  As the session opened, Judge 
Nurdin read from a letter submitted by Panjaitan stating that 
he had failed to convince the defendants to stand trial as 
the court had instructed and therefore considered his own 
presence in the courtroom to be unnecessary.  At that point 
Judge Nurdin asked the defendants to take their seats in the 
prisoners' docket.  When they again refused, the Judge 
ordered them removed from the courtroom and stated that the 
session would proceed without the defendants. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The prosecution, led by Anita Asterida and Fernando 
Siagian, then presented its response to the "exception" 
lodged by the defense on August 8 (ref A).  They refuted the 
defense arguments point by point, arguing that the trial was 
transferred from Timika to Jakarta in accordance with the law 
and that the indictment conformed to legal standards.  They 
concluded by requesting that the Judge set aside the 
"exception" and allow the trial to proceed.  Asterida remains 
confident that the judges will rule against the "exception" 
and allow witness examination to begin whether or not the 
defendants cooperate. 
 
¶3. (U) As in previous sessions, a group of 20-25 Papuans made 
a public display of support in the courtroom, standing up and 
singing the Papuan national anthem as the defendants were 
brought in.  The trial continues to attract attention from 
the Indonesian media.  The next session is scheduled for 
August 29.
