Military Developments 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) An Israeli Air Force (IAF) plane bombed and 
destroyed the home of a Hamas military wing member in Gaza 
overnight August 25-26.  On August 26, IDF troops entered 
Gaza City, killing one Palestinian and wounding seven others. 
 On August 27, the IDF killed one Hamas gunman, and one 
gunman injured the day before succumbed to his wounds.  In a 
separate incident on August 27, the IDF killed a Palestinian 
in Gaza City.  In eastern Gaza on August 27, two journalists 
working for Reuters and Dubai TV were injured in an IAF 
airstrike.  In the early morning hours of August 28, members 
of the PA Ministry of Interior's (MOI) "executive force" 
killed a Palestinian east of Khan Younis.  The Palestinian 
reportedly failed to stop at an "executive force" ad hoc 
checkpoint.  In Gaza City, four members of the MOI executive 
force were killed by an IAF air strike.  Two Qassam rockets 
were launched from Gaza into the western Negev over the 
weekend of August 25-27.  There were no reports of damage or 
injuries. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In the West Bank, one Palestinian was killed and 22 
others were injured in clashes with Israeli forces in Nablus 
on August 26.  On August 27, the IDF killed a Palestinian in 
a village near the West Bank city of Jenin.  The IDF arrested 
11 Palestinians, including a Hamas Palestinian Legislative 
Council (PLC) member, over the period August 25-27. 
 
Humanitarian Update 
------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Rafah is closed on August 28, as it was August 27, 
according to USAID Gaza-based staff.  Rafah was open on 
August 25 and 26.  According to EU Border Assistance Mission 
(EU-BAM), 3,104 people crossed from Gaza into Egypt, and 
3,204 crossed from Egypt into Gaza on August 25.  Statistics 
for August 26 are not yet available. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Karni/al-Mintar commercial crossing is closed 
on August 28, as it was August 27, according to USAID 
Gaza-based staff.  The crossing was last open on August 15. 
As a result, the Sufa and Erez crossings are open on August 
28, as they were on August 27.  (Note: Sufa and Erez 
crossings are each handling approximately 70 truckloads per

is open.  End note.)  The Nahal Oz fuel transfer crossing is 
closed on August 28, as it was August 27, according to USAID 
Gaza-based staff, due to ongoing military operations in the 
area.

into Gaza are operational on August 28, according to USAID 
Gaza-based staff.  One of the four feeder lines into Gaza
