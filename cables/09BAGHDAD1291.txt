SUBJECT:  BAGHDAD RESPONSE TO STATE 2885: IRAQ'S BUDGET IS 
TRANSPARENT 
 
REF: STATE 28885 
 
¶1.  Iraq benefits from USG foreign-assistance funding.  The GOI's 
budget is a matter of public record.  Budget lines for individual 
ministries and revenue estimates are debated openly in the national 
legislature.  The final budget is available to the public when it is 
printed in the official GOI gazette following approval by the 
presidency council.  Some of the information in the budget is made 
available to the public through GOI websites.  There are plans to 
further improve budget transparency via the Internet in 2009. 
 
¶2.  USG technical advisors are continuously engaged with Iraqi 
officials who manage fiscal affairs.  In the course of this 
technical-assistance relationship, the GOI Ministry of Finance 
routinely shares detailed data on expenditures and revenue.  These 
data are reconciled with information received from other sources, 
thereby reinforcing the high degree of transparency and the validity 
of fiscal data in Iraq.
