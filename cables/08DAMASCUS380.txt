SUBJECT: DAMASCUS REFUGEE SITREP 4 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)  This is the forth in a series of Embassy 
Damascus's updates on refugee processing in Syria 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: UNHCR reports rising concern among the 
resident Iraqi community about their ability to extend their 
visas once Syrian schools let out in June but we have no 
evidence SARG has changed its policy on allowing refugees to 
stay in Syria.  Post is taking steps to improve the medical 
clearance process for refugees.  The departing DHS Circuit 
Riders processed 598 cases, recommending 504(1514 
individuals) for ressetlement.  A second team arrived on May 
22 and expects to complete 580 - 600 case before departing 
July 9, the day their Syrian visas expire.  Post also hosted 
a thank-you BBQ for some 150 staffers from various 
organizations involved with Iraqi refugees.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶3. (SBU) IRAQI REFUGEE VISAS: UNHCR reported that many Iraqis 
are concerned that they may be forced to return to Iraq once 
the school year is complete.  In October 2007 the SARG 
imposed a visa regime allowing only certain Iraqis (those 
with medical conditions, business, etc.) to enter.  In the 
past, refugees with children in school had to provide 
justification, such as school enrollment papers, to renew 
their visas.  As the end of the school year approaches, 
rumors have been spreading around Damascus that the SARG will 
not renew these visas - as these Iraqi students are not 
technically in school, Iraqis will not have justification for 
a renewal.  UNHCR Representative Lorens Jolles reported that 
he spoke with the MFA and was assured that there "will not be 
a forced deportation of Iraqi refugees."  Additionally, 
according to UNHCR, recent reports from refugees suggest that 
the border guards are now determining length of stay based 
upon the content of medical records, making it increasingly 
difficult to obtain an entry visa on medical grounds.  Iraqis 
facing a risk of deportation are those who have been arrested 
or detained, destroyed their documents, entered Syria 
illegally, or committed any type of criminal act including 
petty crimes. 
 
¶4. (SBU) IOM/PANEL PHYSICIAN OUTREACH: Post initiated monthly 
meetings with IOM and panel physicians to improve the medical 
clearance process and maximize the number processed each 
month.  The meetings are a mechanism for IOM to share its 
caseload projections with the physicians so more medical are 
done in less time. Our first such meeting is scheduled for 
June 1. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  CIRCUIT RIDE TRANSITION: The new DHS/USCIS circuit 
ride team arrived Damascus on May 21-22.  Five of the 
incoming seven person team are Damascus Circuit Rider 
veterans, including the team leader.  This team has a full 
time finger printer and will interview 20 or 21 cases a day 
through July 9.  The outgoing six-person team departed 
Damascus on May 23. 
 
¶6. (SBU) DHS OUTBRIEF: Marcela Moglia, the departing DHS 
Circuit Ride team leader, reported that during her Circuit 
Ride, her team interviewed 598 cases(1703 individuals) and 
recommended 504 cases (1514 individuals) for rersettlement in 
the U.S. Moglia thanked the IOM support team at UNHCR for its 
"high quality, consistent support."  Moglia also thanked IOM 
for its flexibility with scheduling and its support during 
the change of work schedule.  Moglia was  pleased with the 
plexiglas improvements in the interview booths and thanked 
everyone involved: UNHCR, IOM, Post's GSO and PRM. 
 
¶7. (SBU) THANK YOU FOR REFUGEE ORGANIZATIONS: To thank 
international and domestic assistance groups, the Charge 
hosted approximately 150 people from UNHCR, IOM, DHS and 
other refugee NGOs for a BBQ at the Ambassador's residence on 
May 17.  The event went well and was appreciated by all.
