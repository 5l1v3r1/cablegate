SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (U) The civilian component of the Spanish PRT recently 
launched the latest part of its plan to improve the 
provincial government's ability to meet the educational needs 
of the people of Badghis Province.  They plan to erect 
temporary tent schools at 160 locations identified by the 
Education Ministry, and to construct ten permanent schools 
province-wide.  The tent schools will also provide a 
province-wide symbol of the provincial government's efforts 
to address the educational concerns of locals.  The program 
is funded by the Spanish Development Agency (AECI) and has 
strong buy-in from both the provincial and local levels. 
This project promises to be the most visible symbol of 
development in many parts of the province that lack the 
necessary level of security for longer-term development 
projects.  The program could serve as a best practice for 
those looking to quickly improve both the image of local 
government and the ability of the Education Ministry to meet 
the needs of local residents.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Locals Involved in School Construction 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) As spring makes roads passable and construction 
possible throughout Badghis Province, the Spanish Development 
Agency (AECI) is launching a plan to greatly increase the 
capacity of the Education Ministry to meet the needs of 
Badghis residents province-wide.   Lack of security in over 
half the province prohibits long-term development projects, 
but these relatively low-tech initiatives can be completed in 
a short time period, often by companies based in the 
problematic districts themselves.  AECI plans to utilize as 
many local contractors as possible to mitigate the security 
concerns, speed construction, and provide local jobs.  The 
160 tent schools will be erected on 10 by 4 meter cement 
slabs in locations previously selected to receive permanent 
buildings when funding and local security conditions make 
construction possible.   AECI will send locally engaged staff 
to the remote districts to monitor construction.  The 
provincial Education Ministry generated the list of proposed 
school locations and committed to providing teachers for each 
school and local residents donated the land to accommodate 
the school in their area. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Temporary School Will Be Replaced with Permanent Ones 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
¶3. (U) In addition to the 160 tent schools, AECI is planning 
to build at least ten permanent schools this year to 
complement those already constructed by other donors.  NGO 
World Vision (WV) is also constructing schools in Badghis and 
both WV and AECI will coordinate with the Education Ministry 
to replace the temporary tent schools with permanent 
buildings.   AECI director Pablo Yuste opined that the tent 
school project was designed to meet the immediate provincial 
need for schools and "buy time" to provide permanent schools 
as funding and security permit.  He stressed that AECI is 
committed to replacing all 160 schools with permanent 
structures. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Local Education Ministry: Key Role is Setting Up Schools 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶4. (U) The Education Ministry has played a central role in 
liaising with local communities and selecting the school 
locations.  In addition to ensuring that each new school 
location fits within the Province's Development Plan and the 
Education Ministry's long-term education plans, the Ministry 
has worked to ensure that it will have teachers available for 
each of the new schools.  By constructively engaging the 
 
KABUL 00001123  002 OF 002 
 
 
Education Ministry in all phases of the tent school project, 
AECI has helped develop the Ministry's administrative 
capacity and ensured that the provincial government is seen 
by locals as the driving force behind the project.  The 
opening of 160 tent schools throughout the province will 
serve as a prime example of the provincial government's 
ability to provide basic services. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Schools Help Build Confidence in Government 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Education, along with healthcare and potable water, is 
one of the most pressing needs in Badghis.  Local elders from 
villages without a school point to the lack of an educational 
facility as a symbol of GOA ineffectiveness.  By working with 
local elders to select school locations, the Education 
Ministry is increasing confidence in local government.  The 
fact that each of the 160 tent schools and 10 permanent 
schools are being built on land provided by the residents of 
local communities demonstrates both the local buy-in for the 
project AND the wide-spread support education-related 
projects have. 
 
---------------------------- 
Security Still A Major Issue 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Security is a major concern in Badghis.  In the past, 
night letters against clinics and schools were common and 
officials worry that successful attacks could weaken local 
support for the GOA.  To lessen the impact of possible 
violent action, AECI conceived of this "blitz approach": 
quickly constructing tent schools in many areas that have 
historically been insecure.  AECI hopes that local buy-in 
will encourage residents to protect their schools, but in the 
event of an attack it would only be an attack against one of 
many schools, which AECI hopes would lessen the psychological 
effect of such an incident.  AECI also hopes that the flurry 
of construction related to the 160 tent schools will detract 
attention from the construction of the ten permanent schools, 
lessening the likelihood of an attack against one of them.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (U)  The tent schools are only a short-term fix to the 
very real education needs in Badghis, but they will provide a 
place for thousands of students to learn while plans to build 
permanent schools go forward.  The project should help 
demonstrate to local residents that the GOA, with the help of 
the donor community, is making progress in proving basic 
services, even in areas with limited security.  This project 
could serve as a best practice for other provinces looking 
for ways to rapidly improve both the image of the provincial 
government and the level of education in local communities. 
END COMMENT.
