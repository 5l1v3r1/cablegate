END-USE CHECK ON APPLICATION 050211346 
 
REF: SECSTATE 8626 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Per reftel request, Post conducted a 
pre-license end-use check on application 050211346 for the 
export of International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled 
transformer coupling devices to end-user Sinometer (Hong 
Kong) Co. Ltd. (Sinometer) and foreign consgnee H&E 
Development Company Limited (H&E).  Sinmeter has no physical 
presence in Hong Kong and ppears to be a trading/procurment 
entity with operations in Mainland China.  H&E is a trading 
firm with operations in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Shanghai and 
denies any involvement in reftel transaction.  In Post's 
assessment, Sinometer and H&E are not reliable recipients of 
reftel items or any other controlled technologies/equipment. 
This report also contains publicly available information on 
Sinometer, H&E, and their directors.  END SUMMARY 
 
End-User: Sinometer (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd. 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 1, Post's Economic Specialist attempted 
to make an appointment with Sinometer's Manager Wang Su Rong 
by calling the number provided in reftel request 
(755-8287-2662, Shenzhen, China area code).  Economic 
Specialist was subsequently transferred to Wang's Mainland 
China cell phone number (86-138-0222-3818).  Economic 
Specialist asked Wang to confirm Sinometer's Hong Kong 
address and phone number, as Post could not locate Sinometer 
through Internet or local phone directory searches.  Wang 
admitted the Hong Kong address she provided with her license 
 
application was that of Sinometer's Company Secretariat, an 
accounting firm in Hong Kong.  Wang added that the accounting 
firm was Sinometer's representative in Hong Kong and also 
accepted mail/package deliveries on Sinometer's behalf.  Wang 
confirmed she placed the order for reftel items and indicated 
the items would be used "maybe in Hong Kong or maybe the 
Mainland (China)."  Wang was unable to meet as she "mostly 
worked in Shenzhen, China," but a Mr. POON at Sinometer's 
Company Secretariat could handle her business dealings upon 
her request.

Visit to POON HONG YEUNG 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) On February 3, EconOff paid an unannounced visit to 
Sinometer's registration address.  The building's directory 
and the office's signboard indicated this was the location 
for Certified Public Accountant (CPA) POON HONG YEUNG. 
EconOff later determined subject POON, Hong Yeung was 
registered as a CPA at this address in Hong Kong's Special 
Supplement No. 4 to Government Gazette No. 24/2008. 
 
¶5. (SBU) A male who identified himself as "FAI" answered 
EconOff's "door-knock" but did not allow EconOff to enter the 
small two-room office.  After EconOff explained purpose of 
visit (i.e., to discuss aspects of Sinometer's licensing 
request), FAI asked for spelling of Sinometer's name and then 
searched for it among a set of nine company registration 
documents posted overtly on a board.  After finding 
Sinometer's registration, FAI made several phone calls and 
then informed EconOff that Sinometer personnel were 
unavailable to personally meet; he could arrange a conference 
call at the office's conference room instead.  EconOff 
declined that arrangement and asked that Sinometer 
representatives call EconOff directly to schedule a 
face-to-face meeting. 
 
¶6. (SBU) EconOff also inquired about FAI's duties and the 
various company registration forms posted on the board.  FAI 
admitted POON HONG YEUNG employed him for the provision of 
secretarial services to those companies.  These included 
answering phone calls, responding to faxes, accepting and 
forwarding mail and packages, as well as other ad hoc 
services on behalf of the companies.  (NOTE: POON HONG 
YEUNG's business model is legal and very common in Hong Kong. 
 For a few U.S. dollars and in a matter of hours, one could 
register a business in Hong Kong, contract this type of 
secretarial/support services, and forgo the costs of 
maintaining a physical presence in the city.  EconOff noticed 
a similar operation in the neighboring flat. END NOTE) 
 
Foreign Consignee: H&E Development Company (H&E) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7. (SBU) On February 1, Post's Economic Specialist called H&E 
at 852-2838-1977 and discussed reftel items with a Mr. Wong, 
H&E's General Manager.  Wong denied H&E's involvement as the 
shipment's foreign consignee and further elaborated that H&E 
never placed any orders on Sinometer's behalf.  He declined 
to meet with Post personnel. 
 
¶8. (SBU) On February 3, EconOff again called H&E's Mr. Wong 
to inquire about H&E's purported relationship with Sinometer 
and H&E's mention on reftel items' DSP-5 (Application/License 
for Permanent Export of Unclassified Defense Articles and 
Related Unclassified Technical Data).  Wong admitted that H&E 
had once allowed Sinometer to utilize H&E's UPS shipping 
account as a favor to a mutual client.  However, H&E ceased 
contact with Sinometer staff shortly after that occasion. 
Wong said Sinometer did not obtain approval to continue using 
H&E's name and its UPS account for reftel items.  Wong again 
denied any involvement in reftel transaction but this time 
offered his availability for future inquiries in this matter.
