¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct a pre-license check (PLC) at Mitron, Rua Dos Curtidores 
¶N. 13, 4-and-AEDF, Chun I Lau, Macau (Mitron). The PLC concerned an 
amplifier valued at USD 31,850.  The license applicant is CTT Inc., 
of Sunnyvale, California.  The item is not on the Commerce Control 
List (EAR99) and is therefore only controlled to restricted 
destinations and to restricted end-users/uses. 
 
¶3.  An initial internet search for Mitron in Macau did not uncover 
any information on this company.  Nor did such search uncover any 
information concerning the company's purported phone number and 
address.  The contact phone number is a mobile phone number in 
Macau. 
 
¶4.  The FCS Commercial Assistant called the contact number on 
several occasions to no avail.  A Mr. Sit eventually answered the 
phone and identified himself as affiliated with commercial company 
Hang Tat of Macau.  Hong Kong company Hang Tat was the subject of an 
unfavorable PLC concerning other items and described in reftel C. 
According to the Macau Companies Registry, neither Mitron nor Hang 
Tat are registered as corporate entities in Macau.  Note that sole 
proprietorships do not need to register with the companies registry 
in Macau. According to the Revenue Department, which registers sole 
proprietorships for tax purposes, information concerning sole 
proprietorships is not publicly available. 
 
¶5. Mr. Sit stated that the contact address noted above is his 
residential address.  He further stated that from time to time, he 
allows clients and friends to use his address as a contact or 
delivery address.  Those clients and friends usually notify him when 
they use his address and contact details in this way.  He stated 
that he would confer with his business partners to inquire about 
this item.  Subsequently, he stated that he did not know Mitron nor 
did he know anything about the order in question. 
 
¶6.  The ECO recommends that this PLC be considered Unfavorable.
