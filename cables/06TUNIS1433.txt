I read with interest your message on the significance of 
American cemeteries and monuments abroad and thought you 
would appreciate the efforts that Embassy Tunis has taken to 
recognize and utilize the public diplomacy role the North 
Africa Cemetery can play. 
 
Embassy Tunis considers the ABMC an integral part of our 
mission and I actively encourage all visitors to visit the 
cemetery.  In 2006 alone, the North Africa Cemetery has been 
visited by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy 
Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, multiple U.S. senators 
 
SIPDIS 
and representatives, and a variety of other civilian and 
military officials. 
 
I am also pleased to report that the Tunisian government is 
very supportive of North Africa Cemetery.  In recognition of 
the public diplomacy value of the cemetery, I have invited 
GOT officials to join me and other USG officials in events 
that have received positive local press coverage. 
 
While Tunisia hosts only one ABMC facility, in May I 
participated in the dedication of the Kasserine Pass 
Monument.  The monument in Kasserine, the first major U.S. 
battle in North Africa, presents another opportunity to honor 
the heroic sacrifices of Americans in Tunisia.  We will 
encourage U.S. officials to also visit the Kasserine Pass 
Monument if their schedules permit. 
 
Thank you for highlighting the important role of the ABMC in 
Tunisia. I assure you it will continue to play an active role 
in our public diplomacy efforts.
