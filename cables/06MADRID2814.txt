Emboff delivered a diplomatic note and demarche on November 2 
to Juan Manuel Gonzalez de Linares Palou, MFA Subdirector 
General for the United Nations on the candidacy of Michael 
Matheson for re-election to the International Law Commission. 
 Linares thanked Emboff and said that the Spanish mission in 
New York had also received a note.  He acknowledged that 
there are at least 35 candidates for the commission and that 
the decision will be taken in consultation with the Spanish 
mission to the UN, but declined to say how Spain would vote. 
He promised to let Emboff know when the Spanish had made 
their decision.  Linares had previously told Emboff that he 
saw no problem with the re-election of Matheson and that he 
would be able to offer more clarity in September (ref. B). 
Post will follow up prior to the November 16 election.
