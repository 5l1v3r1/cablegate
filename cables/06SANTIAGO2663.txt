SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - SADDAM'S DEATH SENTENCE 
 
 
Â¶1. On December 29, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 129,000) carried an editorial entitled, "Saddam's 
Execution."  Quotes: 
 "Some believe that Saddam's execution will contribute to pacifying 
Iraq because it will eliminate the cause for division.  But others 
believe his death will only exacerbate violence.  The trial was 
questionable in the way it was conducted and therefore executing the 
sentence will only deepen the feeling of insult of the defeated 
Sunnite factions.... 
 European countries...believe it is possible to reach an agreement 
with Saddam's supporters and commute the sentence . . .  What is 
clear at this point is that there are no easy solutions to the 
conflict in Iraq and that U.S. policy is falling apart...  Saddam 
Hussein's execution will not resolve many problems, but it would be 
inexplicable and weaken the government of Baghdad not to carry out 
the Iraqi tribunal's sentence just because it makes the occupation 
forces uncomfortable."
