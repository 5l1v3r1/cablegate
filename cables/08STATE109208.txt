SUBJECT: KUDOS: SAFE RETURN OF HOLLI CHMELA AND TAYLOR LUCK 
 
¶1. (SBU) Were it not for the extraordinary efforts of 
Embassies Amman, Beirut, and Damascus, Holli Chmela and 
Taylor Luck might still be languishing in a Syrian prison. 
The Department, on behalf of the parents of Ms. Chmela and 
Mr. Luck, as well as all USG agencies involved in the case, 
extends its heartfelt thanks to the officers and locally 
employed staff of these posts for their tireless efforts and 
long hours over the past week to bring Ms. Chmela and Mr. 
Luck home. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Department is also grateful to the Jordanian and 
Lebanese security services, especially the Lebanese Internal 
Security Forces and Surete Generale, as well as the political 
leadership in both Amman and Beirut, for their assistance in 
the search for Ms. Chmela and Mr. Taylor.  This case 
demonstrated the strength of our relations with two close 
regional allies and the concern of their governments for the 
safety of American citizens.
