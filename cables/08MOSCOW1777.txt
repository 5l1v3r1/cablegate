SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST-SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: 
TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF APPLIED MICROELECTRONICS, 
NOVOISBIRSK, RUSSIA, LICENSE NO. D326546 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 10443 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Technological Institute of Applied 
Microelectronics, Novoisbirsk, Russia.  The company is 
listed on BIS license application D326546 as the 
ultimate consignee of two (2) omega/thermovision A10 
18mm camera systems. These items are controlled for 
anti-terrorism, national security, nuclear non 
proliferation, regional stability and UN sanctions 
reasons under ECCN 6A003. The licensee is Indigo 
Systems Corporation, 70 Castilian Drive, Goleta, CA 
¶93117. 
 
¶3. On December 7, 2007, Export Control Office Moscow 
received reftel cable and initiated contact with 
stated POC.  On February 6, 2008 per telephone 
conversation with Eduard Demyanov of the Technical 
Institute of Applied Microelectronics, LES Natalya 
Shipitsina was advised that the actual end-user is 
Kemerovsky Metallurgical Plant, Novokurznetsky, 
Russia.  The ECO was advised that the Institute made 
some modifications to the subject commodity and then 
shipped them to their client, Kemerovsky Metallurgical 
Plant, in 2005.  Eduard Demyanov of the Institute of 
Applied Microelectronics was not able to provide a POC 
within Kemerovsky Metallurgical Plant to the ECO.  On 
March 17, 2008 LES Natalya Shipitsina spoke with the 
POC of Pergam, the Ultimate Consignee, in an attempt 
to locate a POC within Kemerovsky Metallurgical Plant 
with no success.  The Kemerovsky Metallurgical Plant 
employs more than 5000 people and without a POC for 
the actual sale of the two (2) omega/thermovision A10 
18mm camera systems the ECO cannot conduct the PSV. 
 
¶4. Recommendations: Post cannot repeat cannot verify 
that the commodities in reftel are being used in 
accordance with terms of the export license.  Post 
does not consider the Institute of Applied 
Microelectronics, Novoisbirsk, Russia as a reliable 
recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
