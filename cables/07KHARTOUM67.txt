¶1. (SBU) UN Director of Political Affairs Abiodun Bashua confirmed 
to Pol/Econ Counselor January 16 that an additional ten UN military 
staff officers had arrived in El Fasher, Darfur, to join the 17 
military staff officers and 15 UN police advisors already there.  He 
added that five additional UN police advisors would transfer to El 
Fasher on January 21; by the end of January, he said, there would be 
between 123 and 138 total UN individuals in Darfur involved in the 
Light Support Package (Phase 1). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bashua noted that limiting factors in the UN support 
mission included both lack of accommodations in El Fasher and the 
need to recruit civilian staff.  The UN is "fast-tracking" the 
latter effort, he added. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Finally, Bashua said a UN team would arrive in Khartoum 
from New York on January 17 to commence on the ground planning 
activities for the Heavy Support Package (Phase 2) of the 
international peacekeeping operation.
