¶1. Econ Officer delivered reftel talking points to Jaakko 
Lehtovirta, Georgia Desk Officer at the Finnish Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA).   The MFA is currently formulating the 
amount and direction of aid it will provide for Georgia's 
recovery efforts. 
 
¶2. The MFA received the Joint Needs Assessment on October 
15th.  Additionally, the GOF does not have an Embassy in 
Georgia, making coordination difficult.  Mr. Lehtovirta added 
that the GOF is committed to assisting the IDP, and there 
were different ways to do this.  The Finns are considering 
working through their existing projects in Georgia, 
particularly in the environmental sector.   The MFA hopes to 
make a decision in advance of the Donors Conference on 
October 22.
