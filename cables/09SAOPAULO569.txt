SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION- OBAMA'S SPEECH AT THE U.N.; FX-2 BID; 
HONDURAS/OUSTED PRESIDENT ZELAYA 
 
"Obama's debut at the U.N." 
 
 Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (9-25) states: 
"....the high point of Obama's speech was the message that the 
attitudes of his country, and sometimes the ends of its actions, 
have changed...Obama has credentialed himself to lead the effort of 
gradually ending nuclear [weapons], and by promising that the U.S. 
will be guided by rules created in an multilateral context.  In the 
Bush years, this would be unthinkable." 
 
"Sheltering democracy" 
 
 Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (9-25) by PT senator Aloizio 
Mercadante: "....Internally there are some people that have been 
taking advantage of the episode [of Zelaya's refuge at the Brazilian 
Embassy in Honduras] to attack Brazil and its government.  The 
arguments are precarious. ...Brazil is taking part in an 
international effort to enable Honduras to re-find the path of 
dialogue and democracy.... Nonetheless, it is clear that shelter for 
Zelaya and the violent reaction of the de facto government has 
placed Brazil in an uncomfortable situation....During this delicate 
time, I believe that Brazil's unyielding defense of international 
law and of democracy is commanding...." 
 
"Bad luck and the Explanation" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (9-25) by Eliane Catanhede notes: 
"....It is unlikely that two planes of the same brand, the same 
Navy, and the same aircraft carrier, would have suffered separately 
breakdowns at the same time and crashed into the sea....but this is 
heating up the FX-2 competition....[Lula's apparent decision in 
favor of the Rafale...seems to carry a list of disadvantages, while 
advantages are not clear or consistent....In the end [the 
explanation for the choice is:] it is only because Lula wants it."
