SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #5 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
on February 15, 2010. Please visit the following link for 
additional classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶2.   (SBU) February 14 Protest Activity - The 19th Annual Memorial 
Women's March took place from noon to 4 p.m. yesterday.  The march 
began at the Carnegie Community Centre and proceeded through 
Downtown Eastside.  This event was not overtly anti-Olympics and 
there were no reports of disruptive activity.  Vancouver's 36th 
Annual Chinese New Year Parade also took place yesterday with no 
Olympics-related disruptions. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Current Protest Activity - The second successive "2010 
Autonomous Day of Action" is scheduled for today.  As evidenced in 
Saturday's demonstrations, small groups of anarchists may engage in 
acts of vandalism and confrontations with local law enforcement. 
An anti-homelessness rally called "No Empty Talk, No Empty Lots" is 
scheduled for noon at Pigeon Park (at Carrall and East Hastings 
Streets).  An "Anti-War and Anti-Militarization Moving Spectacle" 
will also take place at the Vancouver Art Gallery (Georgia Street 
side) at 6 p.m. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Anticipated Protest Activity - No demonstrations or 
protests are scheduled from 16 through 19 February.  The next 
demonstration is scheduled to be a "Rally for National Housing" on 
Saturday, 20 February at the Vancouver Art Gallery beginning at 
noon.  Diplomatic Security Updates will continue to monitor protest 
activity and will provide updates as they become available. 
 
 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) No significant incidents have occurred during this 
reporting period. 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) A vehicle in U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's motorcade 
was involved in a minor accident on Sunday when a van in the 
motorcade was rear ended by the motorcade vehicle behind it.  Two 
 
individuals in the van were taken to a local hospital as a 
precaution and were later released.  The Vice President's vehicle 
was not involved in the accident. 
 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU) U.S. Vice President Joe Biden departed Vancouver this 
morning en route to Washington, D.C. 
 
 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
¶9.  The Public Affairs desk received an initial inquiry about the 
motorcade event from Global TV.  We worked closely with White House 
staffers to keep them apprised of that initial media call and 
provided contingency planning advice in preparation of the news 
becoming more widely circulated.  We collaborated closely with the 
JOC's SWO to keep all parties informed of news coverage, which 
ultimately received wide publication in the United States and 
lesser coverage in Canada (partly because the winning of Canada's 
first Olympic gold medal eclipsed the motorcade accident in 
Canadian media). 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
 ¶10.  An AMCIT has been arrested and charged in relation to the 
February 13th disturbance by the Black Bloc anti-V2010 group. ACS 
staff report that subject will be transferred from Vancouver PD 
custody to CBSA custody, with the expectation that he will be taken 
to the Canada-U.S. border in the next couple days. Latest 
information indicates that he will face two weapons charges at a 
March 15th court date. 
 
 ¶11.  ACS staff has been in contact with the two distinguished 
guests of the Vice-President who were involved in the February 14th 
 
VPOTUS motorcade accident. Latest reports indicate that both were 
treated at a local hospital and released. 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
¶12.  Vice-President Biden hosted a reception in support of the USOC 
at the home of the US Consul General.  The event was attended by 
approximately 70 guests and featured remarks by the Vice President 
supporting US Olympic efforts and the work of the USOC.  Following 
the reception, Vice-President Biden attended the US-China women's 
hockey game where the US defeated China 12-1. 
 
¶13.  Unseasonably warm weather conditions continue in the Vancouver 
area. 
 
¶14.  In an event described by local media as "Our long national 
nightmare is over," Canadian men's freestyle mogul skier Alexandre 
Bilodeau won the country's first ever Olympic gold medal on 
Canadian soil.  A schedule and results of all competitions 
throughout the Games can be found at
