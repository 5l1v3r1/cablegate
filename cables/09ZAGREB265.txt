(SBU) Ambassador Bradtke personally delivered reftel letter 
from the Secretary to Deputy PM Adlesic on April 30.  Adlesic 
re-iterated how impressed she had been by her 2008 trip to 
Afghanistan, particularly the challenges facing women and 
children there.  She commented that any withdrawal of the 
international community from Afghanistan woudl be a 
catastrophe.  She added that the GoC had established a 
working group, which she would chair, to consider additional 
ways in which Croatia can contribute to meeting the needs in 
Afghanistan.  The GoC also has plans to amend and lighten the 
constitutional requirement for parliamentary approval of any 
troop deployments in the future.
