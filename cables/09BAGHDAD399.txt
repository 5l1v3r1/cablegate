DEC, ICI and Business Forum 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Both Deputy Prime Ministers are keen to engage with 
the new U.S. administration.  DPM Issawi previously expressed 
interest in leading a delegation of Ministers to meet with 
U.S. counterparts (reftel).  DPM Barham Salih noted again on 
February 12 his strong interest in having a Dialogue on 
Economic Cooperation (DEC).  He proposed the timeline of 
April in Washington D.C., possibly around the time of the 
World Bank/International Monetary Fund spring meetings.  EMIN 
noted that it was unlikely that the new administration would 
have all of its sub-Cabinet appointments in place by then. 
EMIN added we would do our best to schedule it as soon as 
feasible.  Salih responded that he would await a proposed 
timeframe from the USG side.  Salih also suggested a senior 
U.S. business delegation visit to Baghdad, tied to the DEC, 
to which EMIN responded positively.  Salih also proposed that 
the GOI host the next International Compact for Iraq 
Ministerial in Baghdad in May. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) EMIN underscored the importance of tying JCC goals 
to supporting Iraq,s efforts to implement the International 
Compact with Iraq and the National Development Strategy, 
working closely with international organizations like the 
World Bank and IMF in private sector development.  EMIN also 
called for timely passage in the Council of Representatives 
on three pending laws affecting economic engagement: the 
bilateral assistance agreement, the OPIC Investment Incentive 
Agreement and the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement.
