¶1.  SUMMARY: In his first meeting with the GOT Minister of 
Health, Ambassador focused on the Avian Influenza (AI) 
situation, expressing U.S. sympathy, commitment to provide 
support, and admiration for Turkey's response, transparency, 
and collaboration.  The Minister stressed that AI was a 
global problem, requiring a united front, and an emphasis on 
education, information sharing, and cooperation.  Both cited 
Turkey's potential as a model for other countries in 
fashining global and local preparedness and response  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Strong Response from GOT 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  In a call on Minister of Health Recep Akdag on January 
19, Ambassador focused on the current Avian Influenza 
outbreak in Turkey.  Accompanied by two members of the 
visiting USG AI multi-agency delegation, Ambassador lauded 
GOT's actions, transparency, and collaboration with 
international organizations in grappling with multiple AI 
influenza outbreaks in backyard poultry and 21 human cases 
(of which, four deaths). 
 
-------------- 
Global Problem 
-------------- 
 
¶3.  The Minister stressed that AI is a global problem, 
requiring sustained cooperation to minimize its spread among 
humans to reduce the potential for mutations that would 
enable human-to-human transmission.  Noting that the risk 
came from so-called "backyard fowl", Akdag stated that a GOT 
priority should be to protect the 290 million-bird 
commercial poultry industry.  He advocated completing 
culling and eradicating the 10 million backyard poultry 
raising, which was the sole population affected by the 
current multiple outbreaks and containment/culling 
operations.  The Minister supported GOT efforts to help the 
populace convert to contained, hygienic poultry husbandry. 
 
--------------------------- 
Need for Good Communication 
---------------------------

¶4.  Akdag acknowledged the need for better communication and 
education for farmers and consumers on safe practices.  He 
noted that the GOT was working closely with the Education 
and Religious Affairs Ministries to fashion and transmit 
messages for schools and mosques.  He emphasized the 
transparency shown by the GOT, but claimed that neighboring 
countries were not showing reciprocal transparency.  The 
Minister claimed that there must be unreported cases in 
these countries, and lamented that they were not receiving 
any information from them. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Global and Local Problems Need Global and Local Solutions 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶5.  Ambassador and AI Del Members agreed that it is likely 
that AI exists in neighboring countries.  Ambassador noted 
that that was why he pushed for the AI Del to travel on to 
the Caucasus.  He said Turkey's preparedness and response 
could serve as a useful model for other countries. 
 
¶6.  In response to a question from Ambassador on in-country 
coordination, the Minister described the new crisis 
coordination center under the Prime Ministry, intended to 
promote better information sharing between the separate (but 
with some personnel exchange) crisis coordination centers in 
the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.  In addition, the 
Minister cited the meeting planned for January 19 of 
Provincial Governors and Health and Agriculture Directors. 
Finally, the Minister noted the earlier completion of a 
National Pandemic Plan, now under revision based on the 
current situation.  (Note: While inter-agency coordination 
is a gap in Turkey, international observers give Turkey 
reasonably high marks.  GOT officials participate in working 
level meetings at the WHO crisis centers in Ankara and in 
Van in eastern Turkey.  The WHO applauded Turkey's National 
Pandemic Plan.  End Note.) 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Laboratory Capacity - Role for U.S. Support 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  The Minister asked for U.S. support for his goal of 
realizing a high security (BSL-3) virology laboratory in 
Ankara, capable of sub-typing H5/N1, capable of serving 
regional needs, and able to serve as a catalyst for sharing

Turkey's know-how and experiences.  The accompanying CDC 
Official stated that he expected the long CDC collaboration 
with the GOT to continue.  He also noted that there were two 
CDC officials integrated into the WHO team in Turkey. 
 
------------------- 
Scientific Research 
------------------- 
 
¶8.  As Turkey's AI crisis apparently abates, Ambassador 
applauded Turkey's willingness to collaborate on valuable 
scientific research with international partners so as to 
understand Turkey's experience.  Ambassador repeated the 
USG's commitment to support Turkey as a key ally grappling 
with a serious problem, and - in addition - to work closely 
with Turkey and others to establish a common coordinated 
front in battling AI.  Finally, the Ambassador promised to 
arrange a de-briefing of senior Ministry of Health (and 
other) officials upon the return of the USG AI Delegation 
from the Caucasus.
