How US is Playing 
 
10 US Senators Criticize Worsening Ties With Israel: Mainstream 
Haber Turk and Hurriyet Daily News report that ten Democrat and 
Republican Senators are moving forward on a letter criticizing 
worsening Turkey-Israel ties.  Citing the cancellation of recent 
military exercises, the letter notes "Turkey's longstanding 
strategic cooperation with Israel and its positive role as a honest 
mediator in the Middle East are important sources of stability in 
the region and are of vital importance to the US." 
 
Iran Hikers:  In "Iran Will Use Nuclear Issue As A Trump Card for 
Iranian Hikers," mainstream Hurriyet says "as tensions build between 
Iran and the West, Iran said that three Americans arrested in July 
after crossing the border from northern Iraq would be tried." 
Mainstream Sabah headlines "Three Americans Will Be Tried for 
Espionage," noting comments by Iranian FM Mottaki who said the 
Americans had "entered Iran illegally, with suspicious 
objectives.'' 
 
Copenhagen:  Ambassador Jeffrey Op-ed on Climate Change was 
published in mainstream Milliyet on 12/13.  Today, Turkish media 
report on the refusal of African countries and G-77 members to 
continue the talks in Copenhagen over disagreements on the funding 
of poor countries.  Columnist Sami Kohen in mainstream Milliyet 
urges the need for Turkey to boost public awareness on the 
environment, but notes "it is very difficult to see a binding 
decision for all participating countries" because of differences 
between the developed and underdeveloped ones.  CNNTurk reports in 
"Four Days Left to Save the World" that the UNSG Ban Ki Mun has made 
a universal call and asked for developed and developing countries to 
come up with a consensus instead of remaining committed to 
accusations. 
 
Other News 
 
Last Decision: DTP Resigns from Parliament/Erdogan Comments 
PM Erdogan told reporters yesterday that the government hasn't how 
to proceed if all DTP members submit their resignation, as 
predicted.  "We prefer them to stay but we will see what we will do 
when the time comes." Talking to Yeni Safak, the two prominent names 
of the DTP -- Ahmet Turk and Aysel Tugluk -- reiterated the decision 
to resign from parliament, calling everyone "to think about ways for 
dialogue and creating an atmosphere for brotherhood."  A new 
pro-Kurdish party is likely to replace the DTP, Yeni Safak reports. 
In southeast Silopi, DTP name tag was removed from the building and 
replaced with a new "Peace and Democracy Party" (BDP),  which was 
founded on May 2009.  Yeni Safak columnist Murat Aksoy comments on 
the parallel efforts underway to establish a brand-new leftist party 
and how some Kurdish politicians are involved in the process.  He 
predicts the new party will be announced in early 2010. 
 
Blogger Spotlight:  Turkey's prominent blogger and columnist Yurtsan 
Atakan commented in his blog:  "The argument about 'no party closure 
in democracies' is absolutely pointless.  Threatening the regime or 
working for separatism are all very reasons for party closure in 
democracies.  Political parties can only be closed down through 
voters choice is another myth, because in reality the rule of law is 
only protector of the regime and minority rights." 
 
EU Commission Comments on the DTP Ruling: All papers report today 
that Amadeu Alfataj Tardio, spokesman for the EU Commission, has 
 
ANKARA 00001778  002 OF 002 
 
 
issued a new statement commenting on the DTP ruling: "The Court 
ruling will negatively impact political representation of a 
significant number of voters in Turkey." 
 
Democratic Initiative Debate Rages: In a heated parliament debate on 
12/14, opposition leaders CHP Baykal and MHP Bahceli accused the 
government for paving the way for internal chaos.  In reply, PM 
Erdogan characterized recent developments as "local incidents" and 
claimed a "media exaggeration."  Meanwhile, leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet headlines  "Streets are Tense and Fights in Parliament is 
at Fight."  Turkish pundits also weighed in on the status of the 
initiative. Murat Yetkin in liberal Radikal is disappointed that PM 
Erdogan did not pay attention to CHP leader Baykal's call: "Baykal 
pledged support if the government goes for a comprehensive 
democratization package.  This is an important chance for successful 
outcome but Erdogan seemed busy to accuse opposition for the current 
tension.  Islamist Yeni Safak's Akif Emre has a suggestion for 
government: "If proper steps for democratization are taken there 
would be no basis left for street riots."  Gungor Mengi in 
mainstream Vatan thinks the election threshold is the major obstacle 
before any democratic initiative: "Given current 10% election 
hurdle, no initiative can go anywhere politically.  It has to be 
lifted completely or make it as low as 5% instead." 
 
Turkey Mosaic:  Public Opinion Poll Shows Disapproval for the 
Democratic Initiative 
In a country-wide survey on ethnic origins conducted by Konsensus 
Research and sponsored by mainstream daily HaberTurk, 76.5% of 
people resident in Turkey define themselves as "Turks" while 13.6 % 
call themselves "Kurds."  The rest is listed as Laz (3.3%), Arab 
(1.8%) and Russian (0.01%).  The support for government's Democratic 
"Kurdish" initiative remained 33.1% while 66.9% expressed 
disapproval. 
 
Turkish gov't freezes shares in Dogan media units 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that  the tax office froze shares in 
Dogan Medya Group units, including Hurriyet Gazetecilik. 
 
Bosnian Action Plan is Ready (Zaman) Intellectual/Islamist-oriented 
Zaman reports that the Foreign Ministers of Turkey, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia agreed on an action plan regarding the 
re-construction of Bosnia during their meeting in Sarajevo 
yesterday.  The parties, prior to the elections in October,  will 
try to eliminate the internal differences between the Bosnians and 
Serbs.  Ankara will work on Bosnia issue intensively in January and 
February, the paper adds.  Within this framework, the Bosnian PM 
will meet with PM Erdogan in Ankara today. 
 
Iran's Secret Nuclear Trigger: Turkish media give prominent play to 
The Times story on 'a new secret document' that demonstrates Iranian 
interests in developing a nuclear bomb.  In "Iran's Secret Nuclear 
Document Leaked," mainstream Sabah highlights, "Iran's nuclear 
program is focused on developing a nuclear bomb, indicates no civil 
application."  Mainstream Hurriyet headlines reads, "Iran Develops A 
Nuclear Trigger," noting, "excerpts from the technical paper detail 
a four-year program by Iranian scientists to develop and test a 
neutron initiator, a device used to trigger a nuclear explosion." 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet, in "Iran is Very Close to An Atomic 
Bomb" highlights The Times' comment that "Israel has to decide, in a 
couple of months, whether to go ahead with an attack on Iran or 
not."
