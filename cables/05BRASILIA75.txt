REF: STATE 3792 
 
¶1.  According to Ministry of External Relations (MRE), South 
and East Asia Division Chief Edson Duarte, the Brazilian 
delegation to the UNOCHA Tsunami Donors Conference will be 
led by the Institutional Security (GSI) chief, General Jorge 
Armando Felix. (The GSI is located within the Presidency; 
General Felix serves as the senior intelligence advisor to 
the President.)  MRE's Head of the Asia and Oceania 
Department (equivalent to EAP and SA), Ambassador Edmundo 
Sussumu Fujita, will represent the Foreign Ministry in 
Geneva.  Duarte explained that President Lula is meeting 
today with key advisors to determine Brazil's medium-term 
assistance package for the affected region; the GOB should be 
in a position to present this package at the Conference. 
Meanwhile, Duarte himself, along with representatives from 
key GOB ministries such as Health, Agriculture, and Defense, 
depart via GOB aircraft this weekend on a fact finding 
mission to Indonesia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. 
 
¶2.  Duarte confirmed that Brazil has already sent two planes 
with a total of 76 tons of water, medicine, and foodstuff to 
the region and will continue to deliver these items on an 
immediate basis.  Varig has offered one aircraft, at cost, to 
help the GOB deliver supplies.  Brazil has not yet determined 
its overall financial commitment for relief and assistance 
efforts.
