¶1. On April 18, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 
101,000) carried an editorial by political scientist Boris Yopo 
entitled "The United States and the Threat of War with Iran." 
Quotes: 
 
¶2. "Iran's intentions are clear.  It wants...the international 
community to recognize its status as a nuclear state and consolidate 
its status as a regional power....  The relevant question today is 
whether Iran would be willing to reach an understanding with the 
major powers on the U.N. Security Council.  In exchange for 
abandoning its plans to build nuclear weapons, Iran would be 
recognized tacitly for its new role in the Middle East.  Thus far, 
diplomatic pressure and sanctions have had no evident impact and the 
alternative scenario, one of a military escalation, would be a 
disaster for stability in the Middle East and would create an even 
greater polarization between the west and the Muslim world.... 
 
¶3. "The joint action of the five permanent UNSC members will be 
vital to avoid an escalation of the conflict.  If this means 
preventing the escalation of nuclear proliferation... perhaps 
President Bush will have to accept the idea of leaving as a legacy 
his recognition of Iran as a new regional power.  There is still 
time for diplomacy, but not much."
