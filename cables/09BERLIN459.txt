REF: STATE 35549 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Germany will likely attend the June 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) plenary 
at The Hague in June 2009, but does not desire to make a 
substantive presentation.  Germany is not likely to host a 
GICNT meeting in the next two years.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Econoff, along with Dutch First Secretary Roger van 
Laak and Russian Federation First Secretary Dmitri 
Cherkaschin, met with German MFA officer Marc Hinrichsen and 
delivered reftel points.  Hinrichsen could not confirm 
Germany's attendance at the GICNT plenary, but expressed as 
his "gut feeling" that Ambassador Viktor Elbling, 
Commissioner for Energy, Globalization and Sustainable 
Development, would attend, as he had also attended the last 
two GICNT meetings.  Hinrichsen also stated he was working 
with the German ministries of Environment, Interior and their 
related agencies to ensure their views were represented at 
the meeting. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hinrichsen said that Germany would not seek a 
specific speaking role at the meeting beyond ontributing to 
the heads of delegation opening remarks session. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Despite Hinrichsen's past requests within the 
German MFA to host a GICNT session, he stated that no such 
meeting was on the horizon.  Germany, he said, is choosing to 
focus its efforts on participating in meetings and providing 
inputs for various workshops. 
 
5  (SBU) Finally, Hinrichsen asked Econoff, as well as 
Russian and Dutch participants, if there was a formal 
invitation forthcoming.  Post appreciates any Department 
guidance on this point.
