PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 161278 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. Post proposes one project to combat trafficking of 
children for forced begging from Guinea-Bissau to other 
countries in West Africa.  Guinea-Bissau is a significant 
source country for children trafficked for forced begging. 
Thanks to foreign financing and support, local efforts and 
involvement from the GOGB, good efforts are being made to 
turn back the tide and help victims.  However, much more is 
needed to help this low Tier Two country.  End Summary. 
 
PROBLEM 
------- 
 
¶2. Regional reports by IOM and UNICEF on trafficking of 
children for forced begging in West Africa have documented 
the significant problem in Guinea-Bissau, which serves as a 
source country.  Religious leaders or their agents, often 
from Senegal, recruit young boys in the predominately Muslim 
eastern region of the country with promises of a Koranic 
education, the likes of which are not available in 
Guinea-Bissau.  Children are forced to beg on the streets of 
cities such as Dakar and if they do not earn about one dollar 
per day and a kilo of rice for their masters, their beating 
is so severe they often do not return. Often, the only 
education they receive is how to survive on the streets. 
 
¶3. Efforts by a local NGO, the Association of Women and 
Children (AMIC) (which does not support legalized 
prostitution), international organizations (IOs) such as IOM 
and UNICEF, and the TIP Report which included Guinea-Bissau 
for the first time in 2006, have raised the profile and 
understanding of the trafficking problem.  AMIC works closely 
with partners including IOs, the GOGB and local policemen to 
repatriate children and reintegrate them.  Some funding for 
their efforts comes from a PRM regional grant to IOM.  But 
AMIC continues to operate on a shoestring and much more work 
needs to be done to raise awareness, build police capacity, 
and assist victims. 
 
¶4. More details about the trafficking problem and those 
working toward solutions will be provided septel in response 
to the Trafficking in Persons Report tasking cable. 
 
PROPOSAL 
-------- 
 
¶5. a) Name of Applicant: International Organization for 
Migration; local partner: AMIC 
b) Requested Amount: USD 139,935 
c) Project Title: Building a Support Network for Children 
Victims of Trafficking Through Training and Capacity Building 
of Law Enforcement, Border Officials and NGOs 
d) Duration: 12 months 
e) Abstract: IOM proposes to organize four three-day training 
sessions in source areas geared toward improving capacity of 
police, border officials, and NGO personnel.  Trainings will 
be about how to recognize the crime, protect victims, and how 
to work together on prevention, protection and prosecution. 
 
The second phase of the project will focus on improving 
technical capacity of law enforcement officials and border 
guards.  IOM will provide communications and transportation 
equipment to law enforcement and training in effective use of 
equipment.  Currently, police are required to use public 
transportation and usually have to pay for it personally. 
Telephone communication is also irregular.  In addition, IOM 
will support a shelter for repatriated victims operated by 
AMIC with food, health kits and other necessities.

via email per reftel instructions.
