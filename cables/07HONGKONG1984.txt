1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted two post shipment-verifications (PSVs) at Allied Specialty 
Compounds Pte Ltd. 2304 Bedok Reservoir Road, No. 04-02B Bedok 
Industrial Park C, Singapore (Allied Specialty Compounds).  The 
items in question for the first PSV are buckytubes tubular 
fullerenes exported on or about December 22, 2006 and valued at USD 
10,000.  The items are classified under Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) 1C010 and are controlled for national 
security (NS) reasons.  The exporter was Carbon Nanotechnologies 
Inc., of Houston, Texas.  The second PSV involved 15 lbs. Of HC 200 
polystyrene with fibril nanotubes (ECCN 1C010 and value USD 420), 15 
lbs of HC 600 poycarbonate with fibril nanotubes (ECCN 1C010 and 
value USD 495) and 15 lbs. HC 600 polycarbonate with fibril 
nanotubes (ECCN 1C010 and value USD 495).  The exporter for these 
items was Hyperion Catalysis Int'l of Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore Companies Registry, Allied Specialty 
Compounds has been in existence since 1980.  Its paid-up share 
capital is the Singapore equivalent of approximately USD 600,000. 
Singapore nationals, Soo Ye Wah, Lim Teck Yan and Phan Sin Chong are 
listed as directors.  More information is located at the company's 
web site, www.ascpl.com. 
 
¶4.  On June 21, 2007, the ECO met with S.C. Phan, President, Toh Soo 
Ling, Assistant R&D Manager and Li Yu Ying, Senior R&D Manager. 
According to Mr. Pham, the business of Allied Specialty Compounds 
involves the production of thermal/engineering plastics.  The 
company has compounding lines at the location visited by the ECO. 
Plastics produced by the company are then delivered to ejection 
molding companies for production.  End-users for its products are 
electronics, semi-con and automotive customers.  In this instance, 
the items are being used in R&D for the production of packaging 
materials for semiconductors.  Ms. Pham stated that customers like 
Seagate and Western Digital are using very clean plastics as disk 
separators.  The items will be mixed with the plastic packaging 
materials to enhance electrical conductivity (so that electrical 
charges will not damage the contents). 
 
¶5.  Toh Soo Ling and Li Yu Ying provided the ECO with documentation 
confirming receipt of the items and with a spreadsheet displaying 
the amounts of the items that had already been used in R&D.  They 
also showed the ECO the remaining product that is stored in the 
company's controlled storeroom. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Allied Specialty Compounds appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the commodities shipped since Allied Specialty 
Compounds cooperated with these PSVs, provided the ECO with access 
to the items and operates a line of business consistent with the use 
of the items. The ECO recommends that these PSVs be classified as 
Favorable.
