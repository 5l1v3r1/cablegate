Theme of "No to Foreign Intervention" 
 
Ref:  a) Khartoum 00181, b) Khartoum 00171 
 
¶1.  During a February 6 address to the International Trade Union 
Conference at Friendship Hall in Khartoum, President Bashir rejected 
the entry of international troops into Sudan.  The account, carried 
by government-aligned Sudan Vision daily, said Bashir asserted the 
Darfur problem could only be solved through dialogue, additional 
resources, and further services. 
 
¶2.  Bashir, who spoke in a conference hall adorned with a "No to 
Foreign Intervention" banner, told the audience that the government 
looked forward to donors fulfilling their pledges for achieving 
development and stability in all war and conflict-affected areas if 
Sudan.  Bashir thanked the Arab League for supporting African Union 
forces in Darfur.  He also commended China for supporting Sudan in 
international courts and in rejecting the use of force, threats, or 
sanctions against Sudan by the UN Security Council. 
 
¶3.  Omdurman Sudan Television broadcast on February 6 an account of 
the event in Arabic that included a statement by President Bashir 
that, "all Western allegations made against Sudan are links in the 
chain of an imperialist scheme being concocted against the Arab 
nations." 
 
¶4.  On February 7, roughly 100 individuals participated in a brief 
protest march from the Ministry of Public Service, Manpower 
Development, and Labor to the UNDP Office in Khartoum.  The theme 
was opposition to foreign intervention in Sudan.
