SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (09/23): Palestinian press report 
no change after yesterday's trilateral meeting in New York 
 
------------ 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The trilateral meeting held yesterday in New York between President 
Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas receives prominent coverage 
in the local press. The dailies quote President Obama saying that 
the talks between the Israelis and Palestinians concerning final 
status issues must resume soon. President Obama also stated that the 
US is committed to achieving a comprehensive peace in the Middle 
East, noting that "it is time to move forward." Obama called on 
Israel to take serious measures to halt settlement activity, and at 
the same time praised Israel's recent removal of over 100 dirt 
barriers in the West Bank, easing movement and access for the 
Palestinian people. President Abbas is quoted saying that Israel 
must withdraw to the 1967 borders and end the occupation in order to 
resume talks. Abbas also noted that Israel must respect all 
previously signed agreements regarding borders and Jerusalem, and 
called on the Israelis to halt all settlement activity, including 
East Jerusalem. 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages news quoting Yasser Abed Rabbo, Secretary 
General of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive 
Committee, saying that there was no decision made during the 
trilateral meeting to pursue talks between the Israelis and 
Palestinians. He explained in a phone call with Al-Ayyam from New 
York that the US will hold separate bilateral meetings with the two 
parties to assess the best way to restart the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations. 
 
In related news, Palestinian officials including Prime Minister 
Salam Fayyad and Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat talked to Al-Quds from 
New York after the trilateral meeting, saying that the negotiations 
cannot be re-started unless settlement activities are completely 
halted. Erekat noted that Jerusalem must be one of the top 
priorities for any negotiations and stressed that Israel must 
withdraw to the 1967 borders. Erekat also stated that a clear time 
frame for the negotiations must be set and that the international 
community should support the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news citing DPA on Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh 
saying that Hamas will support any step that will result in the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state. These remarks 
were stated in a letter Haniyeh sent to UN Secretary General Ban 
Ki-moon prior to the General Assembly meeting. In the letter, 
Haniyeh added that the "United States and Israel are responsible for 
not achieving any progress in the peace process." 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al Quds run stories citing the Israeli daily Haaretz 
saying that the Israeli government recently endorsed the 
construction of a new settlement in Beitar Elite, south of 
Jerusalem. 
 
In related news, Al-Ayyam front pages a report prepared by the PLO 
that details the Israeli tunnels and excavation works surrounding 
East Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City, along with a 
map that displays all the new housing units and settlements in the 
area.

JERUSALEM 00001713  002 OF 002 
 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "A 
Summit or Courteous Diplomacy to the US?" (09/23): "The trilateral 
summit was held yesterday ... however, any meeting of this type is 
held only as a diplomatic gesture to the US. It will not have any 
impact without a tangible change in Israeli positions. As long as 
the Israelis continue settlement activities and ignore their road 
map obligations, this meeting will be useless and will not serve the 
purpose of negotiations." 
 
2) Ashraf Ajrami opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title "The Trilateral Summit: The Only Choice in the Political Game" 
(09/23):"President Abbas' participation in the trilateral meeting 
can be justified, as Abu Mazen couldn't ignore the growing desire of 
the US to hold this meeting ... it would have been unrealistic for 
President Abbas not to give the US - and particularly President 
Obama - the chance to see what US intervention could lead to."
