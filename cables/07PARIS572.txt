           Post Objectives: Post objectives and recommendations 
(part one out of 2) 
 
Post would like to nominate Mrs. Sylvie Petit-Leclair for a ten-day 
enhanced VOLVIS Program in April 2007.  Mrs. Petit-LeClair is a 
French citizen, Director of International Extradition and Mutual 
Legal Assistance at the Paris Prosecutor General's Office, where she 
has served since 2003.  She is in charge of international judicial 
assistance in criminal matters, including extradition requests.  In 
this role of facilitating judicial cooperation between our two 
countries, she would greatly benefit from a deeper understanding of 
the U.S. judicial structure.  She has expressed particular interest 
in obtaining greater knowledge of our criminal law system.  The 
proposed program would allow her to engage in a comparative law 
analysis that can be used in her work, including facilitating 
bilateral cooperation in individual matters, interacting with other 
components of the French government and preparing meetings relating 
to cooperation in combating international terrorism. 
 
Mrs. Petit-Leclair serves in a critical role for U.S. law 
enforcement agencies, since she must approve and direct the 
execution of all formal U.S. requests for international cooperation 
in law enforcement matters that are to be decided in the Paris 
region (which amounts to the overwhelming majority of the cases). 
She has a similar oversight role for French requests destined for 
the U.S.  Accordingly, she works with the Department of Justice on a 
daily basis and provides critical assistance to us in the areas of 
terrorism, organized crime, money laundering and other critical law 
enforcement areas.  In regular senior working level meetings between 
the U.S. and France on Counter-terrorism matters, she often 
represents the Prosecutor General.  Mrs. Petit-Leclair has 
demonstrated a great deal of interest in the American criminal law 
system as well as an enthusiasm for work with her U.S. 
counterparts. 
 
The objective of the program would be for her to have first hand 
contact with the U.S. criminal justice system in order to strengthen 
her knowledge base and gain a deeper understanding of our system. 
This will in turn aid in the execution of U.S. requests for 
extradition and mutual legal assistance from the U.S. to France.  By 
solidifying her relationship with the U.S. law enforcement 
community, we will be able to strengthen our relationship with an 
important player in the French law enforcement community.  This 
program would provide an understanding of the U.S. criminal justice 
system and review how its principles are applied to the prosecution 
of international crime.  It would introduce the roles and 
responsibilities of key law enforcement and prosecutorial institutes 
at the international, federal, state and local levels and the ways 
in which they cooperate to deter organized crime.  It would also 
examine major international crime issues that affect U.S.-Europe 
relations and foster greater international cooperation in combating 
criminal activity 
 
Prior to serving in her current position, Mrs. Petit-Leclair was the 
French Justice Ministry's representative to the Netherlands.  She is 
51 years old, which in the professional ranks of the French 
judiciary, means that she is at a prime stage in her profession in 
terms of leadership and still has at least 15 years until 
retirement. 
 
Arrangement for appointments is requested.
