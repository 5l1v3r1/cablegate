Â¶1.  Reftel points were delivered to MFA desk officer for the 
U.S., Fernando Prieto, who will undertake to circulate our 
views more widely to Spanish foreign policy makers in advance 
of the October 20-21 ministerial hosted by Bulgaria.   Prieto 
was pleased that the U.S. position on Serbian membership in 
SEDM had evolved.   He said that FM Moratinos would agree 
that inclusion of Serbia into SEDM would help moderate 
Serbian policy over time.  Spain also agrees that increased 
regional participation will help Serbia integrate positively 
with its regional neighbors.    Post also reinforced our 
continuing request that Spain refrain from any actions that 
would undermine Kosovo's integration into regional and 
international structures.  Prieto reiterated that we must 
"agree to disagree" on Kosovo independence, but Spain would 
not work against Kosovo's interests.
