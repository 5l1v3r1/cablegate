SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/19): Dubai police believe 
Mossad was involved in the murder of Hamas leader Mahmoud 
Al-Mabhouh 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
For the fourth consecutive day, the local Palestinian press leads 
with news on the developments in the assassination of Hamas leader 
Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh in Dubai. Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida report 
on Interpol placing 11 suspects on its most wanted list. The 
international police agency says it has issued red notices, its 
highest-level alert, to its member countries worldwide for "11 
internationally wanted individuals who have been charged by 
UAE-Dubai authorities with coordinating and committing the murder." 
 
 
Leading headlines also note that Dubai police authorities are almost 
certain that the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad was involved in 
the murder. According to reports, four European countries have 
requested explanations from Israel regarding these accusations. 
Al-Ayyam quotes the head of the Dubai police saying in an interview 
with Dubai TV that he will request the arrest of the Mossad Chief if 
it is proven that the organization was involved in the murder. 
The three dailies front page news on Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad inaugurating a number of development and 
infrastructure projects in the Jenin Governorate in the northern 
West Bank yesterday. Fayyad is quoted stressing that the PA's 
comprehensive development plan is part of the effort to build an 
independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. 
Fayyad also reiterated that the Palestinians will pursue building 
their state in all of "Palestine" including the Old City of 
Jerusalem. 
 
The dailies report that PA President Mahmoud Abbas met with UNRWA 
Commissioner-General Filippo Grandi to discuss ways to support the 
UNRWA budget. Grandi is quoted reiterating after his visit to 
Lebanon that peace will not be achieved in the region without a just 
and fair solution to the Palestinian refugees' case. 
 
Al-Quds leads with news that the Israeli government intends to 
launch a new settlement plan that includes building 60 housing units 
in the Beit-Hanina neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Al-Quds also 
reports that the Israeli authorities demolished 3 Palestinian houses 
in Gaza yesterday. Additionally, the reports note that Israel gave 
notices to citizens of Barta' Al-Sharqiyeh in Jenin yesterday to 
demolish 8 houses due to the lack of appropriate building permits. 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Under the title "Development Effort under the Pressure of 
Occupation" Al-Quds runs an editorial outlining the Palestinian 
Authority's efforts to build the Palestinian state and its 
institutions. However, the writer argues that unless the economic 
and development projects are coupled with ending the occupation and 
real settlement restrictions, the Palestinian development will stop 
and Palestinians will be frustrated.

Palestinian Cyberspace: 
----------------------- 
Palestinian cyberspace focused all week on the updates surrounding 
the assassination of Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh in Dubai. 
 
Lina Al-Sharif from Gaza blogged under the title "Not All Red in 
Gaza is for Blood" saying: "We can all agree that celebrating 
 
JERUSALEM 00000303  002 OF 002 
 
 
Valentine's Day in Gaza is an act of defiance. In Gaza, though it is 
a besieged, war-torn territory, you can always find something 
life-affirming and reflecting the will to live." 
 
A video of girls from Gaza "getting past trauma" by playing soccer 
was circulated on many Palestinian social media cites.
