Ref: STATE 10843 
 
¶1.  (U) The Consulate General Hong Kong is pleased to submit the 
following request for a Food Safety Expert under the 2009 Embassy 
Science Fellow Program (reftel).  Such a Science Fellow would 
greatly assist the Hong Kong Government (HKG) strengthen and improve 
its food testing regime and ensure that both science and risk-based 
standards are set and implemented in a manner that prevents 
unnecessary disruptions in trade. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Following a wave of public concern generated by a series 
of food safety scares over imported items from mainland China, the 
HKG put in place vigorous food safety surveillance programs and 
testing mechanisms. These programs resulted in the testing of more 
than 130,000 food samples in 2008 by the Government Laboratory, the 
primary food product testing laboratory of the HKG.  The lab 
continues to expand its capability and as Hong Kong testing 
protocols become more stringent, U.S. food products are increasingly 
found to contain levels of preservatives and/or metals that exceed 
Hong Kong standards. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) This Department-sponsored Fellow would work with the 
Government Laboratory to strengthen the U.S.-Hong Kong relationship 
and improve understanding about the differences between our food 
testing regimes.  The Fellow would also specifically assist in 
efforts to improve understanding of sampling and detection testing 
for Living Modified Organisms (LMOs).  LMOs are a source of 
significant trade friction and the Hong Kong Legislative Council 
will consider new legislation regulating them this fall.  The 
Embassy Science Fellow would be expected to provide advice on the 
establishment of clear guidelines for residue detection and testing 
procedures and standards for levels of preservatives, metals, and 
residual pesticide in food products.  In addition, we hope the 
successful candidate could participate in public diplomacy and 
educational efforts aimed at raising support for science and 
risk-based standards. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Logistical details for proposed Hong Kong Science Fellow: 
 
* Preferred timeframe: early fall to winter 2009 
* Proposed length: 4 - 6 weeks 
* Medical Clearance: N/A 
* Security Clearance: N/A 
* Commitment: post will provide housing, office and logistical and 
in-country travel support. 
* RSO Clearance: RSO has reviewed and cleared this proposal.
