Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: During a cordial breakfast meeting with the 
Ambassador, leading Liberal presidential candidates Eduardo 
Montealegre, Jose Antonio Alvarado and Jose Rizo agreed in 
principle that the Liberals must unite to confront the FSLN 
in the 2006 elections and wrest the Liberal Constitutional 
Party (PLC) from convicted ex-President Arnoldo Aleman,s 
control.  The candidates, however, disagreed on how to 
undermine Aleman's influence.  Montealegre insisted that 
Aleman and his cronies will continue to dominate the party's 
leadership, while Alvarado and Rizo prefer to work with 
disaffected leaders to reform the party from the inside.  The 
candidates agreed that the outcome of the March regional 
elections on the Atlantic Coast is uncertain, and the 
electoral authority has not done its job to ensure voter 
registration.  Regarding the January 9 elections for the new 
Executive Board (Junta Directiva) for the National Assembly, 
the three were in accord that neither Enrique Quinonez nor 
Rene Nunez, two deputies sponsored by the PLC and FSLN 
respectively, should be elected president of the Junta.  End 
Summary. 
 
CANDIDATES AGREE ON NEED FOR UNITY, BUT NOT PLC STRATEGY

¶2. (C) On January 3, the Ambassador, DCM and Polcouns met 
leading Liberal presidential candidates Eduardo Montealegre, 
Jose Antonio Alvarado and Jose Rizo for breakfast at the 
residence.  The meeting was cordial and subdued, with less 
friction between Montealegre and Alvarado than Emboffs have 
observed in the past.  The three agreed that Nicaragua's 
Liberals must forge an alliance to compete against the FSLN 
in the 2006 national elections and free the PLC from the 
damaging leadership of Arnoldo Aleman.  However, the 
candidates still disagree fundamentally on strategy. 
Montealegre believes that Aleman will maintain control over 
the PLC leadership and may even cede the election to FSLN 
leader Daniel Ortega in exchange for an amnesty vote in the 
National Assembly.  He stressed he could not agree to any 
arrangement that would appear like an accommodation with 
Aleman; to do so would risk losing 15 percentage points of 
public support.  The only viable option, he claimed, is to 
make a clear break from Aleman and his followers and continue 
to "siphon off" decent PLC members. 
 
¶3. (C) Rizo, while agreeing that Aleman represents a 
liability for Liberalism, insisted that he would not have a 
viable candidacy without the PLC and spoke of his long 
commitment to the party.  Rizo emphasized the importance of 
the PLC,s machinery and said he is not willing to 
participate in an open primary competition separate from the 
PLC.  He suggested bringing in an independent (external) 
polling firm to conduct a survey of Liberal supporters on the 
candidates, issues, etc. 
 
¶4. (C) Alvarado acknowledged that the PLC must be taken from 
Aleman, but agreed with Rizo that the move must be done from 
the inside.  He claimed that many party leaders are 
discontented with Aleman,s leadership and that the three 
candidates should put together a team to work on the details 
of an agreement to form an alliance acceptable to all. 
 
¶5. (C) The Ambassador suggested bringing their respective 
teams together to start working on mechanisms and hammering 
out details. Alvarado was in favor, but Rizo and Montealegre 
were more cautious.  Rizo indicated he is willing to talk, 
but did not commit completely, and Montealegre emphasized 
once again that he can not give the appearance of making a 
deal with Aleman's forces.  The Ambassador impressed upon the 
candidates the urgency and importance of uniting the 
democratic forces as soon as possible.  (Note: Following a 
meeting with the ALN-PC Executive Committee on January 3, 
Montealegre called the DCM to advise that they agreed in 
principle to participate in these discussions after the 
election of the new Junta Directiva in the National Assembly. 
 Montealegre asserted that if Aleman ends up in control of 
the Assembly leadership, however, "all bets may be off."  End 
Note.) 
 
ATLANTIC COAST OUTCOME UNCERTAIN 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6. (C) The group held a brief discussion about the Atlantic 
Coast elections, in which all seemed to agree that the 
outcome is uncertain, turnout is likely to be low, and the 
CSE has not done its job to ensure the distribution of voter 
ID cards and voter registration.  Montealegre also claimed 
that, contrary to press reports, Herty Lewites, rallies have 
enjoyed little draw. 
 
CANDIDATES REJECT QUINONEZ AND NUNEZ TO LEAD ASSEMBLY 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7. (C) Regarding the January 9 election of a new Junta 
Directiva for the National Assembly, the candidates all 
asserted that the presidency should not go to PLC-backed 
Enrique Quinonez or FSLN-supported Rene Nunez.  Though the 
candidates did not indicate support for any specific deputy 
for the position, Rizo stated that "someone like" moderate 
PLC deputies Oscar Moncada or Alfonso Ortega Urbina could 
fill the role.  (Note: The candidates' preferences are 
noteworthy because Montealegre controls six votes in the 
Assembly, four deputies are associated with Alvarado, and 
Rizo has the sympathy of several PLC deputies.  Neither the 
PLC nor the FSLN can secure a majority for the elections 
without these votes.  End Note.) 
 
COMMENT: STILL JOCKEYING FOR POSITION 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶8. (C) The leading Liberal candidates agree that the 
democratic forces must form an alliance to defeat the FSLN 
and that Arnoldo Aleman should not control this process, but 
their individual ambition still impedes an agreement. 
Alvarado and Rizo know they cannot defeat Montealegre in an 
open and fair competition without the support of the PLC 
machinery, so they continue to insist that the party can be 
reformed from within despite Aleman's enduring and, since his 
release from house arrest on medical parole, increasing 
domination of the leadership structure.  Unfortunately, 
without a strong and united "Third Way" alternative, many of 
the disaffected PLC members that Montealegre hopes to woo 
may, fearful of their own political survival, continue to 
tolerate Aleman and resist defection.
