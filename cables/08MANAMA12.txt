REF: ERELI / SILVERBERG EMAIL 01/08/08

1.(SBU) Ambassador met with Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa on January 8 to discuss a proposed UNESCO conference aimed at countering extremist influence among young people worldwide. The conference would address problems ranging from the recruitment of child soldiers in Africa, to extremist influences in education in the Muslim world. The FM had reviewed the concept paper and responded enthusiastically to the idea. He said that Bahrain would be pleased to host the June event and expressed particular pleasure that Director General Matsuura planned to attend.

2.(SBU) Sheikh Khalid said that he would consult with the Cabinet about which ministry should have action for organizing the conference, and added that the Crown Prince might want to hold the event under his patronage. The Ambassador and FM agreed that the next step would be for the U.S. Mission to UNESCO to make contact with Bahrain's Paris ambassador to begin the planning process. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
