Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that some European leaders and many 
influential voices in the Arab world are full of Qgloom-and-doom 
predictions about Benjamin NetanyahuQs future government coalition. 
All media quoted DM and Labor Party Chairman Ehud Barak as saying 
yesterday after his meeting with Netanyahu that QVoters sent us to 
the opposition Q that was their verdict and we respect it.Q  For his 
part, Netanyahu insisted that the Qnation wants unity.Q  HaQaretz 
reported that Netanyahu still hopes to form a unity government with 
Kadima and that he is planning to offer its leader Tzipi Livni to 
help him draft the criteria that other parties must accept in 
joining the coalition.  In doing so, Netanyahu is signaling to Livni 
that he is willing to be flexible regarding his own policies, as 
well as obligations he has made to potential right-wing coalition 
allies.  Netanyahu and Livni are scheduled to meet for the second 
time on Friday, but sources close to the Kadima leader expressed 
skepticism Monday over whether the meeting could bear fruit. 
Leading media reported that Netanyahu will meet today with one of 
his most prominent political rivals, Finance Minister Roni Bar-On of 
Kadima, for talks that sources close to both lawmakers described as 
economically-oriented.  HaQaretz reported that Netanyahu is expected 
to use the meeting to emphasize his belief that the national 
economic downturn has not yet hit bottom, another challenge 
demanding national unity.  The Jerusalem Post reported that 
Netanyahu told the Likud Knesset faction that he will not wait 
forever for the formation of a unity government.  Yediot reported 
that Kadima will introduce bills Q on a change in the political 
system and civil marriages -- meant to embarrass Yisrael Beiteinu. 
 
The media cited DM Ehud BarakQs anger over the dismissal by PM Ehud 
Olmert of Amos Gilad from his position as negotiator with Egypt on 
issues pertaining to Hamas.  Media reported that Olmert has 
appointed a QtriumvirateQ -Q the PMQs diplomatic advisor Shalom 
Turgeman, Shin Bet head Yuval Diskin, and Ofer Dekel, who has been 
handling the talks on Gilad Shalit. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli defense officials as saying that 
the Defense Ministry is concerned that President Obama will cut 
military aid to Israel in an effort to pressure the new government 
to take action against illegal outposts and settlement construction. 
 The Jerusalem Post also reported that Rep. Brian Baird (D-WA), who 
visited Gaza last week, plans to brief the U.S. administration and 
fellow members of Congress about his trip, saying that the U.S. 
should pressure Israel regarding border closures and reconsider its 
military support for Israel. 
 
Maariv and HaQaretz (the latter citing a senior State Department 
official) reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will 
announce in Cairo that the U.S. will grant around $900 million for 
the reconstruction of Gaza.  Maariv reported that Clinton will tell 
IsraelQs top officials that the U.S. will be involved in the Middle 
East and seek an end to the conflict. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday Jerusalem Mayor Nir 
Barkat met with U.S. Consul General Jacob Walles.  BarkatQs office 
reported that the Mayor expressed hope that the U.S. would move its 
embassy to the capital during the Obama administration. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Hamas demands that the PA and Fatah stop 
their security cooperation with Israel.  The Jerusalem Post cited a 
document prepared by the office of Government Activities in the 
Territories that Marwan Barghouti would not succeed in uniting 
Palestinian factions if he were released from Israeli prison. 
 
All media reported that the members of the 18th Knesset will be 
sworn in today. 
 
HaQaretz reported that a recent U.S. National Intelligence Council 
report suggests that Egypt has lost its superior status among Arab 
states, and that leadership in the Middle East is passing to Saudi 
Arabia despite the kingdom's efforts to avoid it. 
 
Maariv reported that the American X-ray radar system installed in 
the Negev a few months ago is now operational.  The daily quoted a 
reserves IDF officer as saying that the systemQs precision has 
considerably improved and that the residents of southern Israel are 
much safer. 
 
Yediot reported that the Defense Ministry stands to lose hundreds of 
millions of dollars, following IsraelQs refusal to purchase F-35 
stealth jet fighters under U.S. conditions. 
 
Media reported that yesterday two Qassam rockets exploded in 
Israel. 
 
Maariv reported that far Right activist Noam Federman is suing Col. 
Noam Tibon in the U.S. (FedermanQs wife is an AmCit).  Tibon 
commanded the evacuation of FedermanQs illegal West Bank outpost a 
few months ago. 
 
HaQaretz reported that 104 Israeli academics employed at educational 
institutions around the world returned to Israeli universities this 
year, according to figures released yesterday by the Council for 
Higher Education and the Finance Ministry.  The newspaper reported 
that, among other reasons, the economic crisis in the U.S spurred 
Israeli academics to return. 
 
The media highlighted the effects of the deepening recession, 
notably the possible closure of the Pri Hagalil agricultural produce 
processing plant in the Galilee. 
 
All media reported that yesterday the Bank of Israel lowered its 
discount rate by 0.25% -- to 0.75%.  Stanley Fischer, the bankQs 
governor, hinted that this was his last such step and that he was 
considering taking different measures in the future. 
 
HaQaretz reported that Isramco Oil and Gas is due to receive the 
exploration rights to the Daniel permit area off the Dan region 
coast (around Tel Aviv).  The exploration started in the wake of the 
discovery of a gas field off the Haifa shore.

¶1.  Aftermath of Israeli Elections: 
----------------------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: QIf [Tzipi 
Livni] is unable to influence the new government's diplomatic 
direction, she must lead the opposition and convince the public to 
support her path. 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in Ha'aretz: 
Q[The] dead-end can be breached if [Netanyahu and Livni] build a 
rotation government (two years Netanyahu, two years Livni) on the 
basis of agreed guidelines that allow Kadima one hand on the whip 
and the other on the bridle. 
 
Block Quotes:

¶I.  "Livni, DonQt Give In" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (2/24): QAt 
their meeting Sunday night, Livni demanded Netanyahu accept the 
two-state solution and agree in principle to the establishment of a 
Palestinian state.  Netanyahu has always opposed this, and still 
does.... Livni's public positioning of herself at the head of the 
Israeli peace camp during the election campaign, along with her 
insistence on a different kind of politics,Q obligate her to stick 
to her principles -- first and foremost her call to advance the 
negotiations with the Palestinians.  If she is unable to influence 
the new government's diplomatic direction, she must lead the 
opposition and convince the public to support her path. 
 
II.  "Never Say Never" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in Ha'aretz 
(2/24): QNetanyahu understands that sooner or later [a narrow 
right-wing government] is likely to transform the principle of two 
states for two peoples into one state for two peoples, as in South 
Africa.  Regardless of how much we bomb Gaza, enough Arabs will 
remain to form the majority we fear.  Netanyahu is hardly elated at 
the prospect of forming a right-wing government with Lieberman as a 
senior partner -- he of the poisoned pearls of wisdom -- and prefers 
a wider government with Kadima.  Kadima faces twin dangers: If it 
moves to the opposition, it is likely to crumble.  If it joins a 
Netanyahu-led government, Livni risks being seen as having misled 
her electorate.  This dead-end can be breached if the two build a 
rotation government (two years Netanyahu, two years Livni) on the 
basis of agreed guidelines that allow Kadima one hand on the whip 
and the other on the bridle.  This arrangement would also make it 
easier for Netanyahu to break free of his dependence on the diktats 
of the rightist parties.  In the meantime, Livni isn't budging an 
inch from her stated position, and it's hard to believe the two 
party leaders will have a partnership by tomorrow morning.  As John 
Kerry said when asked if he would run for president again, QNever 
say never.

¶2.  Mideast: 
------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe editorialized: 
QDuring the election campaign, Tzipi Livni boasted about her opening 
the window to a dove.  This is a good slogan for an election 
campaign, but she and the diplomatic-security establishment are well 
aware that there is no dove on the windowsill. 
 
Palestinian affairs correspondent Khaled Abu Toameh wrote in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: QA new Palestinian unity 
government would mean victory for Hamas. 
 
The Jerusalem Post editorialized: QThough Israel purchases arms from 
dozens of sources, [Amnesty InternationalQs] boycott call is really 
aimed at the Obama administration.

¶I.  "No Dove in the Windowsill" 
The nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe edtorialized (2/24): 
QHamasQs takeover of Gaza andits turning into a further player in 
the Iranianaxis, which also threatens Egypt and Jordan, havesignaled the great 
dangers inherent in granting th Palestinians 
independence.  The reality that emrged in Judea and Samaria [i.e. 
the West Bank], ith de-facto full Israeli rule, indicates the 
sizeable advantages in keeping that undetermined reality intact. 
Accrued experience in these areas has in effect brought to an end 
the diplomatic process -Q regardless of the stances of the outgoing, 
or the incoming, government.  During the election campaign, Tzipi 
Livni boasted about her opening the window to a dove.  This is a 
good slogan for an election campaign, but she and the 
diplomatic-security establishment are well aware that there is no 
dove on the windowsill.  The outgoing government, which served in a 
peace-seeking term through two wars, is excellent evidence of 
that. 
 
II.  "In a Palestinian Unity Government, Hamas Wins" 
 
Palestinian affairs correspondent Khaled Abu Toameh wrote in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (2/24): QEven if Hamas 
agrees to form a unity government with Fatah, this does not mean 
that the Islamist movement would change its overall strategy or 
soften its position on the Israeli-Arab conflict.... [Next weekQs 
Fatah-Hamas] talks are not aimed at persuading Hamas to change its 
ideology or recognize Israel's right to exist or renounce terrorism. 
 Instead, they are designed to find a formula that would allow the 
two parties to sit together in a unity government whose primary 
mission would be to rebuild, with the help of the international 
community, houses and institutions in the Gaza Strip that were 
destroyed during Operation Cast Lead.  Fatah leaders have already 
made it clear that they are not going to the talks to ask Hamas to 
make any Qpolitical concessionsQ.... A new Palestinian unity 
government would mean victory for Hamas for two reasons: one, the 
movement would not be required to make any major political 
concessions and, two, a unity government would turn the movement 
into a legitimate and internationally recognized player in the 
Palestinian arena.  Ironically, the same forces that have been 
working so hard over the past three years to delegitimize Hamas are 
now helping the movement win the international recognition that it 
is so desperate to gain. 
 
III.  "No Pardon for Amnesty" 
 
The Jerusalem Post editorialized (2/23): QYesterday, Amnesty 
International, the world's premier Qhuman rightsQ brand, called for 
the destruction of Israel.  We're overdramatizing?  Were AI to get 
its way, the UN Security Council would impose a comprehensive arms 
embargo on the world's only Jewish state -- but not on any of the 22 
member states of the Arab League, or on Iran.  Over time, Israel 
would find it impossible to defend itself against conventional or 
WMD threats stemming from hostile states or Palestinian and Islamist 
terror organizations.... Though Israel purchases arms from dozens of 
sources, AI's boycott call is really aimed at the Obama 
administration.... Amnesty does much good work.... In calling on the 
U.S. and UN to rob Israel of its ability to defend itself, Amnesty 
International is speaking in the name of its leaders and 
benefactors.  Silence is acquiescence.  Or they can dissociate 
themselves from one of Amnesty's biggest errors in judgment.
