SUBJECT: TIP: HONG KONG WOULD BE "DISAPPOINTED" WITH A 
CONTINUED TIER 2 RANKING 
 
REF: HONG KONG 2340 
 
¶1. (SBU) On December 30, E/P Chief and Poloff met with Hong 
Kong Security Bureau, Police and Labor Department officials 
to follow up on G/TIP Ambassador Luis CdeBaca's December 4 
visit.  The HKG officials appreciated Ambassador CdeBaca's 
visit and hoped he left with the "ground truth" that Hong 
Kong did not have a systemic trafficking-in-persons (TIP) 
problem.  The officials acknowledged that occasional cases of 
labor exploitation of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) 
occurred but Hong Kong's anti-TIP regime was equipped to 
handle them.  Labor officials highlighted the 140 cases of 
underpayment to FDWs they prosecuted in 2009, noting these 
successful convictions had been publicized to deter others 
from underpaying workers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Labor officials maintained that the high debt FDWs 
incurred to come to Hong Kong was a source country problem, 
not Hong Kong's.  Labor officials told us that Secretary for 
Labor and Welfare Matthew Cheung pressed the new Indonesian 
Minister for Manpower and Transmigration Muhaimin Iskandar 
during the latter's recent visit to Hong Kong to lower fees 
charged to the workers.  Iskandar told Cheung the Indonesian 
government was looking to lower fees for government-issued 
documents such as passports and visas, but training fees 
charged by recruitment agencies were market-driven and not 
under the government's control, according to the Labor 
official.  The Indonesian government, however, was exploring 
decentralizing the training provided to FDWs which Hong Kong 
Labor officials believed would result in greater competition 
and lower training fees. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While insisting that most FDWs took out loans from 
Indonesia-based financial institutions to pay training and 
administrative fees, Hong Kong police officials said they 
were looking at ways to investigate whether Hong Kong 
financial institutions were offering loans with terms that 
increased the financial burden on FDWs. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Contending last year's Tier 2 ranking was unfair, a 
senior Security Bureau official repeated a question the Chief 
Secretary had asked Ambassador CdeBaca, i.e. if the U.S. was 
"moving the goal posts" on TIP (see ref).  Poloff insisted 
the tier rankings had always been based on a governments' 
compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of 
trafficking as laid out in the U.S. Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act.  The senior official insisted Hong Kong had 
"walked the extra mile" to increase dialogue with local 
Consulates and reach out to NGOs.  He stated that it would be 
"disappointing" if the U.S. disregarded Hong Kong's overall 
efforts again.  The official stressed that Hong Kong could 
not accept being in "second place" to other Asian countries 
on human rights matters.
