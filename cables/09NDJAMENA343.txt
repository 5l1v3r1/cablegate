SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) LIBYAN AMBASSADOR GREEN SALEH GREEN DESCRIBED TO 
AMBASSADOR ON AUGUST 6 HOW LIBYA HAD INTENSIFIED BOTH ITS BILATERAL 
SUPPORT FOR CHAD AND ITS EFFORTS TO NORMALIZE CHAD-SUDAN RELATIONS 
SINCE HIS RETURN TO NDJAMENA AS COM.  LIBYA IS INVESTING HEAVILY IN 
CHAD'S ECONOMY -- BUDGET SUPPORT, TRANSPORT, TRADE AND INVESTMENT, 
INCLUDING MASSIVELY IN AGRICULTURE -- TO PREVENT IT FROM BECOMING AN 
UNSTABLE NEIGHBOR AND TO CHECK ILLEGAL IMMIGATION AND BLACK-MARKET 
COMMERCE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND UNDERMINE SOURCES OF 
TERRORISM.  QADHAFI HAD SIGNED "CONVENTIONS" WITH BOTH DEBY AND 
BASHIR AIMED AT A "FINAL ACCORD" TO BE CINCHED BY A DEBY-BASHIR 
MEETING IN TRIPOLI AUGUST 31. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) GREEN SAID THAT LIBYA WAS PRESSING BOTH CHADIAN AND 
SUDANESE TO RECONCILE WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTS.  HE TOOK CREDIT FOR 
SOUBIANE'S RECENT DEFECTION; PREDICTED THAT MACKAYE WOULD BE NEXT; 
SAID THAT LIBYA WOULD FIND HOMES FOR CHAD REBEL CHIEFS UNABLE OR 
UNWILLING TO RETURN TO CHAD; AND REVEALED THAT SALAH GHOSH WAS 
ASSISTING LIBYA WITH CHAD REBELS.  LIBYA HAD ALSO BEEN PRESSING 
KHALIL IBRAHIM TO LEAVE CHAD AND TO TALK SERIOUSLY TO KHARTOUM, 
WHILE PRESSING DEBY TO STOP AIDING JEM, WHICH WAS AIDED HEAVILY BY 
ERITREA. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT WE WELCOMED LIBYA'S ACTIVISM IN 
SEEKING REGIONAL SOLUTIONS TO REGIONAL PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY BY 
ENDING THE PROXY WAR, NORMALIZING CHAD-SUDAN RELATIONS, AND FINDING 
A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE DARFUR CRISIS TO ENSURE FULL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPA.  THE USG WAS READY TO WORK WITH TRIPOLI 
ON COUNTER-TERRORISM BECAUSE WE TOO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT TERRORISM 
IN THE SAHEL.  END SUMMARY.

LIBYAN SUPPORT TO CHAD

¶4.  (SBU) LIBYAN AMBASSADOR GREEN SALEH GREEN DESCRIBED TO 
AMBASSADOR ON AUGUST 6 HOW LIBYA HAD INTENSIFIED BOTH ITS BILATERAL 
SUPPORT FOR CHAD AND ITS EFFORTS TO NORMALIZE CHAD-SUDAN RELATIONS 
SINCE HIS RETURN TO NDJAMENA AS COM.  GREEN CLAIMED THAT HIS OWN 
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH QADHAFI DEMONSTRATED LIBYA'S COMMITMENT TO 
THESE REGIONAL EFFORTS AND ENHANCED HIS CHANCES FOR SUCCEESS, CITING 
HIS MEMBERSHIP IN THE GUIDE'S CLAN.  GREEN SAID THAT LIBYA WAS 
TRYING TO REINFORCE CHAD'S STABILITY, TO PREVENT IT BECOMING AN 
UNSTABLE NEIGHBOR AND TO CHECK ILLEGAL IMMIGATION AND BLACK-MARKET 
COMMERCE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  LIBYA HAD DELIVERED GENERATORS 
WITH 21 MEGAWATT CAPACITY, ALONG WITH TECHNICIANS TO INSTALL THEM, 
TO RELIEVE THE CAPITAL'S GNAWING AND DEBILITATING POWER SHORTAGE. 
TRIOLI WAS NEGOTIATED A USD 600 MILLION LOAN TO CHAD AND WAS 
IMPROVING THE BENGHAZI-NDJAMENA ROAD CORRIDOR, INCLUDING SURFACING 
1,000 KILOMETERS THAT REMAIN UNIMPROVED. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) LIBYA WAS INCREASING ITS SUPPORT TO CHAD IN EDUCATION AND 
CULTURE AS WELL.  TRIPOLI WAS NEGOTIATING A NEW CUSTOMS CONVENTION 
WITH CHAD TO ENHANCE LIBYAN TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN CHAD.  TRIPOLI 
PLANNED TO INVEST AN EVENTUAL USD 2.2 BILLION TO DEVELOP 20,000 
HECTARES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN SOUTHERN CHAD IN ORDER TO GROW 
RICE, CORN AND OTHER GRAIN CROPS NEAR THE SOUTHERN CHADIAN TOWNS OF 
SARH, BONGOR, AND MOUNDOU.  SOME OF THIS WAS PART OF THE QADHAFI AU 
PRESIDENCY'S "GREEN PROJECT" IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMUNITY OF 
SAHEL-SAHARAN STATES' (CEN-SAD) 28 COUNTRIES. 
 
--------------------- 
CHAD-SUDAN RELATIONS: 
ENDING A PROXY WAR? 
--------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) GREEN CLAIMED THAT LIBYA WAS COMMITTED TO ENDING THE PROXY 
WAR BETWEEN CHAD AND SUDAN AND TO NORMALIZING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE 
TWO FEUDING NEIGHBORS.  GREEN SAID THAT QADHAFI HAD "SIGNED 
CONVENTIONS" WITH BOTH DEBY AND BASHIR AIMED AT A CHAD-SUDABN "FINAL 
ACCORD."  THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT HAD SET UP AN INTERNAL "WORKING 
GROUP" DEDICATED TO BRINGING CHAD AND SUDAN TO THIS "FINAL 
SOLUTION."  GREEN CLAIMED THAT THE GUIDE WANTED TO BRING ABOUT A 
DEBY-BASHIR MEETING, THE OCCASION FOR WHICH WOULD BE THE AU SPECIAL 
SESSION IN TRIPOLI ON AUGUST 31.  BOTH DEBY AND BASHIR HAD AGREED TO 
SUCH A MEETING, ACCORDING TO GREEN, WHO SAID THAT LIBYA INSISTED 
 
NDJAMENA 00000343  002 OF 002 
 
 
THAT NOT ONLY BORDER INCIDENTS BUT ALSO "ALL THIS PROPAGANDA" SHOULD 
STOP.  GREEN SAID THAT LIBYA WAS WORKING WITH THE GOC TO RE-OPEN THE 
SUDANESE SCHOOL IN NDJAMENA:  "WE'LL GET IT RE-OPENED," GREEN 
AFFIRMED. 
 
------------------------- 
LIBYA AND THE CHAD REBELS 
------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) GREEN SAID THAT LIBYA WAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PRESSING 
BOTH CHADIAN REBELS IN SUDAN AND SUDANESE REBELS IN CHAD TO RENOUNCE 
ARMED REBELLION AND RECONCILE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS. 
GREEN TOOK CREDIT FOR THE RECENT DEFECTION OF AHMAT SOUBIANE FROM 
CHAD REBEL RANKS AND SAID THAT THE NEXT LIBYAN TARGET WAS ABDELWAHID 
ABOUD MACKAYE, LEADER OF FORCES TO ESTABLISH DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM 
(FIDEL) WHICH IS PART OF DISSIDENT GROUP, UFDD-FONDAMENTALE, WHO WAS 
IN TRIPOLI OR WAS EXPECTED THERE SOON, TO TAKE THE PATH BLAZED BY 
SOUBIANE.  GREEN SAID THAT THOSE REBEL CHIEFS WHO WERE UNABLE OR 
REFUSED TO RETURN TO CHAD "COULD BE SETTLED IN A THIRD COUNTRY:  WE 
CAN DO THIS FOR THEM."  LIBYA WOULD ALSO TRY TO HELP BOTH SUDAN AND 
CHAD FINANCIALLY IN THE EFFORT TO WOO REBELS BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE. 
GREEN SAID THAT THE SUDANESE REGIME, IN THE PERSON OF NISS CHIEF 
SALAH GHOSH, WAS ASSISTING LIBYA IN ITS EFFORTS WITH THE CHAD 
REBELS.

LIBYA AND THE SUDANESE REBELS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) GREEN SAID THAT LIBYA HAD BEEN TALKING TO JEM LEADER 
KHALIL IBRAHIM, PRESSING HIM TO LEAVE CHAD AND TO TALK SERIOUSLY TO 
KHARTOUM.  LIBYA HAD ALSO PRESSED DEBY TO STOP AIDING JEM AND TO GET 
THEM OUT OF CHAD.  GREEN SAID THAT ONE OF JEM'S PRINCIPAL SUPPORTERS 
WAS ERITREA AND THAT LIBYA WAS WORKING THAT ANGLE AS WELL. 
 
--------------------- 
CONVERGING INTERESTS? 
--------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) AMBASSADOR TOLD GREEN THAT HIS EXPOSITION OF LIBYA'S GOALS 
VIS-A-VIS CHAD AND SUDAN INDICATED THAT OUR GOALS AND TRIPOLI'S WERE 
NEARLY IDENTICAL:  ENDING THE PROXY WAR, NORMALIZING CHAD-SUDAN 
RELATIONS, AND FINDING A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE DARFUR CRISIS TO 
ENSURE THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT IN SUDAN WAS 
IMPLEMENTED FULLY.  THIS WAS THE TASK THAT SPECIAL ENVOY GRATION HAD 
BEEN SET AND WE WISHED LIBYA SUCCESS IN ITS APPARENTLY COMPLEMENTARY 
EFFORTS AS OUTLINED BY GREEN.  AMBASSADOR SAID THAT REINFORCED 
RELATIONS BETWEEN TRIPOLI AND WASHINGTON COULD ENABLE US TO WORK 
TOGETHER TOWARD THESE SHARED GOALS AND THAT THE USG WELCOMED LIBYA'S 
ACTIVISM IN SEEKING REGIONAL SOLUTIONS TO REGIONAL PROBLEMS. 
 
---------------------- 
TERRORISM IN THE SAHEL 
---------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) GREEN SAID THAT LIBYA'S BIGGEST FEAR IN THE REGION WAS 
TERRORISM AND THAT TRIPOLI WANTED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN 
THIS AREA.  AMBASSADOR SAID THE U.S. WAS READY TO WORK WITH TRIPOLI 
ON COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES BECAUSE WE TOO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT 
TERRORISM IN THE SAHEL, AS REFLECTED BY THE RESOURCES WE WERE 
DEVOTING TO OUR TRANS-SAHARA COUNTER-TERRORISM PARTNERSHIP.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU) THE LIBYANS HERE HAVE TENDED TO CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO 
ACCOMPLISH MORE THAN THEY EVENTUALLY MANAGE TO DELIVER.  BUT LIBYA'S 
CONSTRUCTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN BILATERAL AFFAIRS AND ON THE CHAD-SUDAN 
BINOMIAL HAVE INDEED INTENSIFIED SINCE GREEN RETURNED TO NDJAMENA AS 
AMBASSADOR.  (I GUESS BEING ABLE TO CALL THE GUIDE "COUSIN MUAMAR" 
HELPS A LOT.)  WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO COMPLEMENT LIBYAN 
ACTIONS ON REINFORCING THE CHADIAN STATE AND NORMALIZING CHAD-SUDAN 
RELATIONS IN SO FAR AS THEIR GOALS AND OURS CONVERGE. 
 
¶12.  (U) MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
