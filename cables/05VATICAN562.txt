Summary 
----------- 
 
¶1.  (C)  The Ambassador shared ref (a) points on Venezuela's 
nefarious influence in the region with Holy See internal affairs 
chief (Vatican number three) Archbishop Leonardo Sandri December 
¶17.  Some points were news to Sandri, but he was not surprised 
and said he shared U.S. concerns about Chavez and other leftist 
leaders in Latin America.  An interlocutor from the Vatican MFA 
as well told the Ambassador that he and his superiors were wary 
of connections among these leaders.  Neither prelate thought the 
Vatican would become more aggressive in speaking out against 
these figures, both because of recent history and the potential 
for a backlash against the Church.  The Ambassador will see FM 
Lajolo after the holidays to continue this dialogue.  End 
Summary.

Sandri Under No Illusions 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  The Ambassador met with Archbishop Leonardo Sandri 
December 17 for a wide-ranging conversation on the Church in 
Latin America.  Sandri, an Argentine and former nuncio to 
Venezuela, is the chief of Vatican internal operations and 
generally regarded as the Holy See's number three behind the 
pope and Secretary of State.  Ambassador discussed ref (a) 
points, emphasizing the danger Chavez poses to the governments 
around him.  Sandri was aware of some points, but others came as 
news to him.  In any case, he was not surprised. Sandri said he 
was convinced that Chavez was dangerous from the time he took 
office and Sandri was stationed in Caracas.  The archbishop said 
he had taken a harder line than the U.S. Embassy at the time, 
who told him to "wait and see" what Chavez did in office. 
 
------------------------- 
Holy See Concerned 
------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  According to Sandri, who said he knew the pope's 
thinking on the subject, the Holy See is concerned about a 
general leftward shift in Latin America.  He mentioned concerns 
about several figures who seemed to be looking to Castro and 
Chavez, including Mexico's Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.  Holy 
See MFA Country Director for the U.S. and Mexico Monsignor Paolo 
Gualtieri told the Ambassador in a separate meeting December 15 
that his superiors in the MFA were of a similar mindset.  They 
see the connections between Chavez, Castro, and other leftist 
politicians in Latin America, and are concerned about the 
dangers they present on many levels.

What to Do? 
--------------- 
 
¶4.   (C)  While the Vatican agrees that these figures are 
dangerous, it sees the question of how to deal with them as more 
complicated.  The Ambassador's conversation with Sandri tracked 
closely with the description of the pope's concern on Venezuela 
noted in ref (b).  However, Sandri stuck to the previous Vatican 
line on engagement there; he did not see the Holy See changing 
its non-confrontational approach to Chavez given the recent 
history between Venezuela and the Holy See (ref c).  He 
responded favorably to the idea that direct aid from the U.S. 
Catholic Church to the Venezuelan Church to help the latter 
build up its social programs could help counteract Chavez's 
appeal and blunt his attacks on the Church.  Gualtieri noted 
that in the case of someone like Lopez Obrador, the Church had 
to be careful not to overstep its bounds into politics, no 
matter how it felt. He said Masonic groups and some segments of 
Mexican society were ready to pounce on bishops or clergy who 
strayed into the political realm (ref d).

Comment 
----------- 
 
¶5. (C)   The Holy See continues to feel that a 
non-confrontational approach to Chavez is the right strategy for 
the time being, but the Vatican hierarchy is under no illusions 
about the danger of Chavez and kindred souls - and the 
connections between them.  Sandri has great influence in the 
Vatican and as a former nuncio to Venezuela his views on that 
country carry particular weight.  But his formal competency is 
the internal affairs of the Church.  The Ambassador will see 
Gualtieri's boss, FM Lajolo, after the holidays to continue this 
dialogue, as Lajolo has the lead on all questions of foreign 
policy.
