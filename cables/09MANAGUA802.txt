¶1.  (C) Summary: On August 6, and in the presence of the 109 
FSLN mayors, President Daniel Ortega launched the "Great 
National Consultation on Municipal Budgets."  This program 
calls on all Nicaraguans to participate in the party's 
Citizen Power Council (CPC) system to develop (and even 
"decide") local budgets.  While Nicaraguan law does call for 
citizen participation in the development of local budgets, it 
does not (as Ortega is attempting) restrict Nicaraguans' 
participation to the CPCs.  Ortega's most recent statements 
suggest he will make good on past promises to subordinate 
local authorities to the FSLN's CPC structure and further 
increase the role of the governing party in managing local 
resources and governance.  End Summary.

The Great Consultation ... Within the Party Structure 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On August 6, President Daniel Ortega and First Lady 
(and head of the Citizen Power Councils) Rosario Murillo 
launched the "Great National Consultation on Municipal 
Budgets," which calls on Nicaraguans to participate in the 
Sandinista National Liberation Front's (FSLN)-controlled CPC 
structures for the development of municipal budgets. 
Present at the event were the 109 FSLN mayors (of a total of 
156 mayors in the country); 18 "opposition" party mayors were 
also present.  Matagalpa Mayor Sadrach Zeledon (FSLN) read 
the proclamation calling for Nicaraguans to "mobilize, 
organize, and participate in Assemblies, Cabinets, Congresses 
and Town Halls of the Citizens Power to discuss, debate, 
share, come to a consensus on and decide on the municipal 
budget."  This subordination of local governments to CPCs in 
the development of the local budgets is a continuation of the 
FSLN's plan to have CPCs dominate local affairs.  Murillo 
first announced the plan in March 2008 when the FSLN selected 
its candidates for the municipal elections later that year 
(ref B). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ortega referred to the Nicaraguan Constitution to 
justify this consultative process, specifically citing 
articles 48, 49 and 50.  However, these articles are broad 
principles referring to the rights of citizens to 
"effectively participate in the political, economic, and 
social life of the country" (Art.48), the right to organize 
(Art. 49), and the right to participate in public matters 
(Art. 50).  Experts on local governance highlight the 
illegality and arbitrary nature of this "Great Consultation." 
 They note this approach challenges the autonomy of local 
governments by subordinating basic municipal authorities to 
the CPCs (and ultimately the FSLN) and undermines the legal, 
pre-established structures and institutions for the 
consultative process.  The Citizens Participation Law of 2003 
calls for local governments to establish Municipal 
Development Committees (CDMs) to provide consultation on 
municipal budgets.  The law, however, gives mayors ultimate 
responsibility for local budgets. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to the law, CDMs are non-partisan, 
pluralist organizations which should reflect the various 
actors and organizations of the municipality.  By contrast, 
CPCs are pari-party entities controlled and managed by the 
FSLN leadership that mirror the official government structure 
at all levels - national, regional and local.  Ortega 
established the CPCs in 2007 by Presidential decree and 
provoked a constitutional crisis when he sought public 
funding for these groups, which the National Assembly twice 
rejected as illegal.  Ortega subsequently subverted the 
legislature, again via Presidential decrees, by placing the 
CPCs under the umbrella of the Council of Economic and Social 
Planning (CONPES) and naming his wife as CONPES Executive 
Secretary (ref C).  In doing so he also violated the 
Constitutional prohibition on immediate family members of the 
president holding or seeking public office.

¶5.  (C) The FSLN's attempt to control all levels of 
government continues, even after the November 2008 electoral 
fraud handed the party 109 of 156 municipalities.  This 
latest move further weakens the legal, pre-established and 
non-partisan institutions for citizens participation in local 
governance and replaces it with an FSLN structure that 
facilitates the party's ability to direct resources for 
partisan purposes.  This "Great Consultation" also might 
provide Ortega an opportunity to deflect criticism for the 
country's fiscal woes (ref A).  As presidential economic 
advisor Bayardo Arce recently told reporters regarding the 
third budgetary cut to come, "less tax revenue will result in 
less funds for local governments."  By giving the FSLN base 
(through the CPCs) some ownership over how to direct or 
prioritize local spending, the FSLN might diffuse possible 
tensions within the party brought about by constantly 
dwindling funds and resources.
