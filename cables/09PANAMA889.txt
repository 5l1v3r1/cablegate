GOP Approves Plan 
--------------------- 
 
¶1. (S//NF) President Martinelli told Ambassador on December 13 that 
he had given approval for Colombian forces to attack FARC forces 
that will be gathered for the holidays in Panama's Darien province 
(ref A).  He confirmed that the plan had been discussed during a 
meeting on December 9 with visiting Colombian National Police 
director General Oscar Naranjo. 
 
¶2. (S//NF) During a lengthy dinner conversation with Ambassador, 
the president voiced contradictory views about the seriousness of 
the FARC threat.  At times he expressed indignation about the FARC 
"holding a Christmas party" on Panamanian territory and said he was 
determined to take immediate aggressive action against them. When 
the Ambassador raised the risk (and political cost) of women and 
children being killed, Martinelli at first deemed this an 
acceptable price.  He then reconsidered after the Ambassador framed 
the issue in counterinsurgency terms, underscoring the importance 
of maintaining the support of the population. At another point in 
the conversation he opined that the FARC was not really a threat to 
the GOP, and that he was being forced to act only because the 
Padron kidnapping case had demonstrated the FARC's potential danger 
to urban Panamanians.  The range of seemingly conflicting views 
that Martinelli holds in his own mind about this problem are 
illustrative of his mercurial and unpredictable management style, 
in which he gives conflicting directives to subordinates and 
approves contradictory courses of action. 
 
¶3. (S//NF) Beyond the pros and cons of any potential Colombian 
action against the FARC, the Ambassador noted the danger posed by 
having two uncoordinated plans in the same space and time.  The 
president first said it was a matter of who -- the U.S. or the 
Colombians -- could take out FARC leader alias "Silver" first, but 
then he said he now realized that this could get someone killed. 
The Ambassador made clear that closer Panama-Colombian cooperation 
was something we had long favored and noted that we would be happy 
to be part of a coordinated Panama-Colombia plan. 
 
Embassy Panama Standing Down in Darien 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (S//NF) Embassy Panama's Pillar Three Darien working group 
(Pillar Three of our Darien 1207 strategy is aimed at demobilizing 
the lower ranked of the 200 FARC 57th Front members operating in 
the Darien along with the arrest of specific FARC leaders on U.S. 
indictments) met December 15 to review the impact of recent events 
on our operations in the Darien.  The working group considered the 
state of play described above as well as their meeting the day 
before with Frank Abrego, head of the National Frontier Service, 
the GOP public force with lead responsibility in the Darien. 
Abrego had kept the embassy team waiting in his headquarters office 
for an hour while he scrambled to get guidance from Minister of 
Government and Justice Jose Raul Mulino on whether he was to 
provide an intelligence briefing or not.  As a precaution, and to 
avoid running the risks associated with two uncoordinated plans 
operating in the same area and at the same time, the working group 
decided to cancel of the deployment of two JTF-Bravo Blackhawk 
helicopters that had planned training missions with the CNT-17 SEAL 
detachment and to recall the SEAL detachment, the U.S. Army Joint 
Planning and Assistance Team (JPAT) and Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) to Panama City for the next several weeks.  In 
addition, the Ambassador has accepted DEA's recommendation that the 
FAST team focus its efforts on valuable CN targets elsewhere in 
Panama, away from the uncertainty of operating in the Darien, where 
 
SENAFRONT's level of commitment to the CN operations was most 
decidedly not reassuring to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  When 
the Ambassador briefed Minister of the Presidency Jimmy 
Papadimitriu the evening of December 15 about our plan to take this 
"Christmas break," he welcomed the decision and thanked the 
Ambassador for being understanding in the face of confusion. 
 
¶5. (S//NF)  Comment:  We have just received Bogota  3559, which is 
helpful in piecing together the events over the past couple of 
weeks and to pointing to a way forward.  We are grateful for 
General Naranjo's commitment to working in concert with the USG and 
his openness about GOC efforts to develop operational targets as a 
precursor to developing plans for taking effective action against 
those targets.  While we would welcome marrying Embassy Panama's 
effort-we were in the midst of the same process of developing a 
target package against FARC leader aka Silver and others as a first 
step to developing a concept of operations to share in mid-January 
with the GOP for review and approval-with a Colombian effort, we 
are mindful (as Bogota 3559 notes) that Consejo Chief Olmedo Alfaro 
seeks to marginalize the USG, which has traditionally been Panama's 
principal security partner.  After intense speculation that the 
anti-American Alfaro would be ousted, his position, which includes 
daily access to President Martinelli, seems to have strengthened 
considerably over the past couple of weeks, making our approach of 
working around him to achieve our goals steadily more difficult. 
We look forward in the new year to working in close collaboration 
with Embassy Bogota and with guidance from Washington to chart a 
way forward built around a single, coherent plan for denying the 
FARC and other DTOs safehaven and operating space in the Darien. 
End comment.
