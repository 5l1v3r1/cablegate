Ambassador delivered reftel points January 19 to Lesotho's 
Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Pont'so Sekatle (Minister 
of Local Government).  The A/FOMIN was generally familiar with 
the issue and indicated she would bring this matter to the 
attention of the Prime Minister.  She anticipated forwarding a 
position soon on the GOL's public support for a UNSC review.
