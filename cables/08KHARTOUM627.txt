SUBJECT: UNAMID LIQUIDATION TEAM ARRIVES IN DARFUR 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: UNAMID has assigned a team of liquidation 
specialists to identify AMIS assets for disposal either to the UN or 
to the AU.  The team said it can transfer European-donated AMIS 
assets by June but was not able to specify a similar date for USG 
assets since they were inventoried and controlled by PAE. However, 
at least $3.3 million in USG heavy equipment has already been 
properly turned over to UNAMID and is in use. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) UNAMID liquidation specialist Peter Hornsby told poloff 
April 22 that reconciliation of USG donated equipment provided 
through PAE will require the UN to physically inventory equipment 
and supplies prior to acceptance. As a result, he was unable to 
provide a timeframe for completion of the liquidation process for 
USG donations. Hornsby said that because PAE inventoried and 
controlled the equipment separately, AMIS did not have its own 
inventory that would facilitate transfer of ownership. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Hornsby, who arrived in Sudan on April 10, said that there 
is about $3.3 million in USG-provided heavy equipment that the UN 
has already accepted that is now being used.  He said that this 
equipment is readily identifiable and still needs to be transferred 
to UN ownership so it can be registered with Sudanese authorities 
and insured. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Hornsby was adamant that the UN must physically review the 
equipment and assure itself that the submitted inventories are 
accurate.  He said that only after all the property is properly 
identified will UNAMID decide what property it will accept.  Any 
equipment not accepted by UNAMID will be offered to the AU.  For 
example, Hornsby said that the UN will probably not accept 
approximately 50 trucks from another donor that were not made by 
either Toyota or Nissan as they do not meet UN standard 
requirements.  He said the AU might want to use the trucks for a 
mission in Somalia. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Hornsby said that a similar accounting of equipment and 
supplies provided by Europeans should be ready for reconciliation 
and transfer to either UNAMID or the AU by June 15. Hornsby said 
that because AMIS took full control of equipment donated by the 
Netherlands, the UK and the EU at the start of AMIS operations, 
UNAMID was in a better position to more quickly reconcile its 
inventory and decide on the disposition of the equipment. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: While it is positive that UNAMID is finally 
addressing the inventory issues, it is patently ridiculous that 
UNAMID can't manage to quickly inventory and put all formerly 
PAE-controlled equipment donated by the US into use immediately. 
This is UN bureaucracy at its best, looking a gift horse from its 
primary donor in the mouth and not making the most of the assets 
that it has at hand.
