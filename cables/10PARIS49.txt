REF: STATE 3353 
 
Per reftel, we spoke with MFA AF African Union (AU) 
Coordinator Patrick Champel on January 14.  Champel said that 
USAU Acting DCM Joel Maybury had already been in contact with 
France's mission in Addis Ababa to arrange a meeting between 
AF A/S Johnnie Carson and MFA AF A/S-equivalent Stephane 
Gompertz, who will head the French delegation to the AU 
Summit.  Champel said that a Carson-Gompertz meeting was 
tentatively scheduled for January 30 and that the French 
mission in Addis Ababa and Acting DCM Maybury would finalize 
details.  The French delegation to the AU Summit will consist 
of Gompertz, Champel, and France's Ambassador in Addis Ababa. 
 We provided Champel reftel information on the composition of 
the U.S. delegation, which he appreciated.  We further 
understand that President Sarkozy is planning to attend the 
AU summit and address the heads-of-state plenary meeting, but 
this awaits formal confirmation, which the French mission in 
Addis Ababa may provide to USAU.
