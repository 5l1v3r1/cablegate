"Nothing New In Havana" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo (2/26) 
editorialized: "The consolidation of the Cuban gerontocracy 
evidences that the only thing that the Castro brothers have really 
to offer is more of the same thing. The only suffering that ended 
for Cubans is that of having to hear Fidel Castro's four-hour 
speeches.... As long as Fidel is alive and can exert tutelage over 
the regime, Cuba will perpetuate his catastrophic legacy.... Decades 
of misery, fear and hopelessness have transformed one of the world's 
most exuberant populations into a worn out society. Neither in the 
Soviet Russia nor in Mao's China had apathy reached comparable 
levels. The Cubans are living in a political and economic 
hibernation from which they will not get out of soon.  The people's 
indifference in view of Sunday's tragicomedy in Havana summarizes 
the five decades of insanity of the 'irreplaceable' Fidel Castro."
