SUBJECT: TAIWAN FOREIGN MINISTER ON FIJI AND SOLOMON ISLANDS 
 
REF: STATE 07966 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Stephen M. Young. Reason(s): 
1.4 (B/D) 
 
¶1.  (C REL AUS) Summary.  The Director delivered reftel 
demarche on Fiji and Solomon Islands to Foreign Minister 
James Huang on January 23.  Huang responded that Taiwan 
"suspended" its assistance to Fiji following the coup and has 
not been approached for assistance by the post-coup Fiji 
government.  He expressed dismay at Australian concerns over 
Taiwan assistance to the Solomon Islands, arguing that Taiwan 
has provided much beneficial assistance to the Islands and 
that Taiwan had no choice but to respond positively to a 
request for police training from "an old ally."  In response 
to DIR's earlier and repeated urging that Taiwan hold 
discussions with Australia on the Solomon Islands, Huang said 
Taiwan Vice Foreign Minister Chang Hsiao-yueh is scheduled to 
meet with her Australian counterpart in Canberra in early 
February.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C REL AUS) Director Young met with FM James Huang on 
January 23 to deliver reftel points on Fiji and Solomon 
Islands.  Huang listened carefully to the points which, DIR 
noted, built on their discussion over lunch last week.  It 
was particularly important, DIR stressed, that Taiwan follow 
its democratic values in its relations with Fiji and Solomon 
Islands and stay in close contact with Australia. 
 
Fiji Aid on Hold 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (C REL AUS) FM Huang told DIR that Taiwan had a number of 
assistance projects in Fiji before the coup, but these had 
all been suspended -- "not cut off," he emphasized, "just 
suspended" pending further review.  DIR asked if the 
post-coup Fiji government had approached Taiwan for 
assistance or if Taiwan had proffered any assistance.  Huang 
responded negatively to both questions. 
 
Taiwan Assistance to Solomon Islands Misunderstood 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4.  (C REL AUS) FM Huang took issue with reftel points on 
Taiwan activities in the Solomon Islands (SI).  He protested 
the implication that Taiwan's activities "had anything to do 
with the riots" last year, insisting that Taiwan is 
"innocent."  Australia, he charged, insists all other donors 
must implement their aid projects in SI according to 
Australian standards.  Taiwan, however, has a number of grass 
roots projects that actively assist SI Members of Parliament 
to improve sanitary and medical conditions in their 
districts.  Last year, he noted, Taiwan sent six mobile 
medical teams to SI and five other Pacific Island countries. 
The local people had been so grateful for the assistance that 
the governments requested these teams be sent twice yearly in 
the future.  Explaining that Taiwan has no choice but to 
depend on local partners to implement much of its assistance, 
Huang surmised that in its SI projects Taiwan might have 
given its local implementing partners too much leeway.  DIR 
responded that the U.S., too, often channels assistance 
through local partners, but maintains close oversight. 
Providing assistance, he stressed, brings responsibility; 
Taiwan aid must be closely monitored and should reflect 
Taiwan's values. 
 
¶5.  (C REL AUS) Huang was defensive on the charge that Taiwan 
has provided assistance to security forces in the Solomons 
Taiwan.  Taiwan, he countered, is being treated unfairly. 
Australia does not understand the difficult situation in 
which Taiwan finds itself, in part because Premier Sogavare 
does not get along with Canberra.  Taiwan is caught in the 
middle.  When "our traditional ally" requests police 
training, how can Taiwan turn down the request?  How would 
this affect Taiwan's relations with its ally?

¶6.  (C REL AUS) DIR stressed that Washington understands 
Taiwan has its own diplomatic difficulties, but urged Taiwan 
to maintain an open and close dialogue with Australia over 
SI, an area in which Australia has historical interests. 
Huang responded that Vice Foreign Minister Chang Hsiao-yueh 
will transit Australia in both directions on her trip to the 
Solomon Islands in early February and had requested a meeting 
with her Australian counterpart.  Canberra, he said, 
responded positively and welcomed the proposal for a meeting 
on one leg of Chang's transit.  He promised that Chang would 
brief AIT after her trip. 
 
Criticisms of Taiwan Unfair 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C REL AUS) FM Huang complained that Taiwan is being held 
to an unfair standard.  When Chinese PM Wen Jiabao attended 
the South Pacific Economic Forum last year and offered USD 
370 million in aid to South Pacific nations, Australia and 
New Zealand offered no criticism.  DIR responded that he 
understood that Australia and New Zealand are, in fact, 
concerned over PRC assistance and have raised this with 
Beijing.  At the same time, he acknowledged, we probably do 
expect more from Taiwan, a full democracy, than from the PRC, 
which turns a blind eye to these issues. 
 
¶8.  (C REL AUS) Australia, moreover, is a close friend of the 
U.S., DIR explained, and the two nations share similar views 
on nation building in the South Pacific.  The U.S. supports 
the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) 
and, thus, welcomes VFM Chang's meeting and exchange of views 
in Canberra. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶9.  (C REL AUS) VFM Chang's stopover in Canberra to discuss 
SI issues is a welcome development and follow-up to DIR's 
lunch last week with FM Huang, at which time DIR urged that 
Taiwan should maintain close and open discussion on South 
Pacific issues with Australia.  AIT will follow up with VFM 
Chang after her return from Honiara and Canberra.
