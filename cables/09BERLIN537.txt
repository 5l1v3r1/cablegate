¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) confirmed 
today another case of A/H1N1 Influenza in Germany, increasing 
the total number of confirmed cases to eleven.  One man from 
Bavaria tested positive for H1N1 after returning from the U.S. 
with flu-like symptoms.  This is the first German traveler 
that we are aware of to be infected with the new virus in the 
U.S.  Local media coverage of H1N1 has dropped noticeably. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Sixth Case of H1N1 in Bavaria 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its morning press 
briefing May 8 another laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1 for 
Germany.  This increases the total number of confirmed cases 
in Germany to eleven (Refs B,C,D). 
 
¶3. (SBU) A man from Bavaria tested positive for H1N1 after 
returning from a trip to the U.S. with flu-like symptoms. 
Bavarian Health officials report a mild case of the virus. The 
man is already on the way to recovery.  The media reported 
that all family members have been identified and quarantined 
as a precautionary measure.   There is no information 
available on whether anyone of them has shown flu symptoms so 
far.  Measures are being taken to identify other people who 
may have been in contact with him.  This is the sixth 
confirmed case of H1N1 for the federal state of Bavaria (other 
Bavarian cases reported in Refs C,D,E). 
 
 
First German Infected in the US 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  This case marks the first German traveler to be 
infected with the new virus in the U.S., officials from RKI 
announced today.  No information is currently available on 
where in the U.S. the man may have been infected with the 
virus.  Eight of the previous ten confirmed cases were in 
people who had recently returned from Mexico; the other two 
were passed from a traveler to a nurse and fellow patient that 
came in contact with him during treatment. 
 
 
Intensity of Coverage 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) As reported in Ref B, RKI has announced that the 
epidemic in Germany is "in a stabilization phase." Post 
noticed that media coverage has lost its intensity.
