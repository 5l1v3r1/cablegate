REF: STATE 56431 
 
(SBU)  We discussed the UNSC MINURSO mandate renewal with 
Petr Illichev, Senior Counselor in the MFA'S International 
Organizations Department, who told us that Russia, as a 
member of the Friends of Western Sahara, supported the 
Friends' text.  He said that Moscow was aware that South 
Africa might push for changes, but Russia was confident that 
the mandate would be renewed without difficulty.
