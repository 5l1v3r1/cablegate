SUBJECT: PANAMA:  MESSAGE REINFORCING MESSAGE ON IRAN TO 
SELECT NAM MEMBER STATES DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 79505 
 
Classified By: POLCOUNS Brian R. Naranjo.  Reason:  1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
Â¶1.  (C) First VP and FM Samuel Lewis said he fully understood 
the U.S. message on Iranin advance of the Non-Aligned 
Movement Foreign Ministers' meeting in Teheran, in response 
to Charge's delivery of reftel demarche on July 23.  "Panama 
is not sending a high-level delegation," Lewis added, but 
would be represented at this ministerial by its commercial 
representative in Beijing.  (Note:  Panama has diplomatic 
relations with Taiwan, not China; it's highest representative 
in Beijing is its commercal representative.)  Furthermore, 
he was fully aware of the back and forth on the ministerial 
statement and Iran's proposed resolution on its nuclear 
program.  Lewis did not commit to undertake any significant 
diplomatic effort to press for the substance of reftel 
demarche to be reflected in the NAM. 
 
2,  (C) COMMENT:  By focusing in his response to the demarche 
on the low-level of Panama's delegation, Lewis' message was 
two-fold:  Panama wishes to distant itself from the NAM FMs' 
Teheran conference, and Panama will not have the political 
weight in Teheran to press for changes on this ministerial 
meeting's texts.
