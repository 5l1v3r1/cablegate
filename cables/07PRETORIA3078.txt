 ¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Westinghouse believes it is 
well-positioned to win South Africa's contract for the 
construction of conventional nuclear reactors based on its 
advantages in price, safety, modular plant design, and 
commitment to technology transfer and localization; i.e., 
insuring benefits accrue to South African suppliers and 
engineering service companies.  Nevertheless, competition 
with French Areva is likely to be vigorous.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Westinghouse of the U.S. (owned by Toshiba of 
Japan) is expected to compete with Areva of France for 
construction of conventional nuclear reactors to supplement 
South Africa's sole existing reactor facility in Koeberg near 
Cape Town (Reftels).  The SAG and state electricity company 
ESKOM are expected to choose a winning supplier by March 2008 
to provide approximately 3 GW of nuclear power in a contract 
worth up to $6 billion.  The USG has approved Westinghouse's 
application for advocacy based on the provision of thousands 
of jobs in the US.  The SAG has announced its intent to build 
up to 20 GW of nuclear power reactors over the long-term, 
thus making the initial contract all the more important. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In a meeting on August 23, Westinghouse local 
General Manager Rita Bowser explained to Minerals and Energy 
Officer and Specialist the company's plan for pursuing the 
contract.  Bowser described the SAG's newly announced draft 
nuclear energy policy as almost tailor-made to support 
Westinghouse's bid (Reftel B).  She cited the clear 
separation of SAG supply of new nuclear power plants 
(assigned to ESKOM) from the possible pursuit of nuclear 
enrichment (assigned to NECSA) and the specification of 
Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) for the reactor(s).  Bowser 
identified the following advantages for Westinghouse: 
 
-Advantage on price. 
-Excellence and track record on nuclear plant safety. 
-Modular plant design (three Westinghouse 1.1 GW plants could 
meet the SAG requirement, versus two Areva 1.7 GW plants). 
-Commitment to technology transfer and localization to South 
Africa. 
 
Bowser welcomed Post's advice that Westinghouse stress 
localization as a bidding factor or requirement in its 
comment on the SAG's draft nuclear energy policy. 
Westinghouse has already demonstrated its commitment to 
localization by organizing supplier workshops and sending SAG 
officials for training in the U.S.  Westinghouse's general 
philosophy is to build two plants, assist with the building 
of the next two plants, and support the host government's 
building the subsequent two plants with its own capacity. 
This philosophy would fit well to build the first two to 
three 1.1 GW plants, followed by an additional 13-15 plants 
over the long-term. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In a series of recent conversations with Economic 
Counselor and Minerals/Energy Officer, Westinghouse has 
outlined its strategies for positioning itself to win the 
nuclear new build contract: 
 
-- Complete the acquisition of local nuclear services 
supplier IST.  Although the acquisition is still under review 
by the Competition Authority, Westinghouse is optimistic that 
the acquisition can close in early October. 
 
-- Work with its local public relations firm to arrange a 
public campaign to support its efforts.  Raising the 
contract's profile will also insure greater transparency 
during the award process. 
 
-- Work with the U.S. Embassy to support its efforts. 
Embassy will consider hosting an event marking Westinghouse's 
acquisition and quest, as well as participating in the new 
office ground-breaking.  Embassy will also participate in a 
 
joint call on the Embassy of Japan next week to coordinate 
U.S. and Japanese government support. 
 
-- Raise its public profile and its American flag by joining 
AMCHAM and becoming a member of the AMCHAM board.  AMCHAM has 
asked and Westinghouse has already agreed to join the board 
and will participate in the next AMCHAM board meeting on 
September 19. 
 
-- Continue to show its interest in providing fuel and 
services to the existing plants.  Westinghouse was awarded a 
nuclear fuel supply contract to ESKOM in August according to 
DME Chief Director: Nuclear Tselio Maqubela. 
 
-- Consider working with CSSA on encouraging the American 
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to work with South 
African counterparts to arrange an industry conference as a 
way of show-casing U.S. technical support and prowess. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) According to Westinghouse, French Areva exhibits 
some advantages in being the supplier for the existing 
nuclear power facility at Koeberg and providing a critical 
turbine on short notice last year.  On the other hand, the 
facility has experienced problems and shut-downs, 
exacerbating electricity shortages in the Cape region.  Each 
problem at Koeberg is an additional boost for Westinghouse as 
the alternative supplier.  Areva also has the reputation of 
being solely focused on creating jobs back home, and not 
being as focused on technology transfer and localization. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Economic Counselor and Minerals and Energy Officer 
used an August 28 meeting with DME Chief Director: Nuclear 
Tselio Maqubela to make a strong pitch on behalf of 
 
SIPDIS 
Westinghouse, outlining the competitive advantages mentioned 
in paragraph three.  Maqubela recused himself from commenting 
on Westinghouse's strong points, noting that he is spending 
half his time consulting for ESKOM.  Moreover, noting that 
there would be competition between Westinghouse and Areva, he 
said he was now unable to meet one-on-one with any company or 
associated government officials.  Maqubela said he would also 
have to limit his meetings with the USG as the competition 
heats up. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COMMENT: Post will continue to work closely with 
Westinghouse to develop an action plan for advocating its 
bid.  The fact that key SAG officials are already sensitive 
to not meeting alone or too frequently with U.S. officials 
indicates that Westinghouse's quest is being treated as a 
serious bid.
