"HIZBULLAH" DEFINES ITS MILITANT POLICY 
--------------------------------------- 
 
"HIZBULLAH" (PARTY OF GOD) HAS NOW PUBLICLY DEFINED ITS 
POLICY, GOALS AND IDEOLOGY.  AS A GROUP OF FUNDAMENTALIST 
SHIITES, THEY ARE DEDICATED TO PROMOT ISLAM ON THE 
PATTERN OF KHOMEINI'S REVOLUTION IN IRAN.  THEY DERIVE 
THEIR APPELATION FROM TWO KORANIC VERSES WHICH READ: 
(1) "AND WHO SO TAKETH ALLAH AND HIS MESSANGER AND THOSE 
WHO BELIEVE FOR FRIEND (WILL KNOW THAT), LO* THE PARTY 
OF ALLAH THEY ARE THE VICTORIOUS." (SURAH 5/56); (2) 
"THOU WILT NOT FIND FOLK WHO BELIEVE IN ALLAH AND HIS 
MESSENGER, EVEN THOUGH THEY BE THEIR FATHERS OR THEIR 
SONS OR THEIR BRETHREN OR THEIR CLAN.  AS FOR SUCH, HE 
HATH WRITTEN FAITH UPON THEIR HEARTS AND HATH STRENGTHENED 
THEM WITH A SPIRIT FROM HIM, AND HE WILL BRING THEM INTO 
GARDENS UNDERNEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW, WHEREIN THEY WILL 
ABIDE.  ALLAH IS WELL PLEASED WITH THEM, AND THEY ARE 
WELL PLEASED WITH HIM.  THEY ARE ALLAH'S PARTY, LO* IS 
IT NOT ALLAH'S PARTY WHO ARE THE SUCCESSFUL.  (SURAH 
58/22-23). 
 
ANNIVERSARY: MARKING THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
VIOLENT DEATH OF THE MOSLEM CLERIC SHEIKH RAGHEB HARB, 
THE IMAM OF THE VILLAGE OF JABSHIT IN SOUTH LEBANON, 
"HIZBULLAH" STAGED A MASS RALLY AT THE CHIYAH SUBURB 
SATURDAY, FEB. 16, 1985.  SHEIKH HARB WAS A STAUNCH 
OPPONENT OF ISRAEL OCCUPATION, AND AN ADVOCATE OF 
"HIZBULLAH" AND THE RISE OF A PAN-ISLAMIC "NATION OF THE 
PARTY OF GOD."  HE WAS ASSASSINATED REPORTEDLY BY 
ISRAEL'S AGENTS IN HIS NATIVE VILLAGE ON FEB. 16, 1984. 
 
THE ORGANIZATION SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFUTE THE 
ACCUSATION THAT IT WAS A HAND OF TERRORISTS.  IT UNDER- 
LINED ITS ALLEGIANCE TO "WELAYAT AL FAQIH" (RULE OF THE 
THEOLOGIAN) UNDER IRAN'S AYATULLAH RUHALLAH KHOMEINI. 
AMERICA, FRANCE, ISRAEL AND THE PHALANGE PARTY WERE 
DECLARED AS ITS PRIME ENEMIES.  IT DESCRIBED THE PRESENT 
LEBANESE SYSTEM AS "DESPOTIC" AND RENOUNCED THE REGIME 
OF PRESIDENT AMIN GEMAYEL. 
 
OPENING THE MEETING, SHEIKH GHABRIS SAID THAT "HIZBULLAH" 
WAS "MISLEADINGLY DESCRIBED AS A HANDFUL OF FANATICS BENT 
ON KILLING, PLUNDER AND ROBBERY;" AND THAT THEY WERE 
"BLAMED FOR EVERY UNPLEASANT INCIDENT."  "BUT," HE 
EMPHASIZED, "IT WAS "HIZBULLAH" WHICH ACTIVATED THE 
(FREEDOM) FIGHTERS AND EXPELLED THE ENEMY." 
 
MANIFESTO: LATER SHEIKH IBRAHIM AL AMIN READ OUT AT THE 
RALLY A 48-PAGE "MESSAGE" DEDICATED TO THE "MARTYR 
SHEIKH RAGHEB HARB" WHICH WAS TANTAMOUNT TO A MANIFESTO 
OF THE PARTY. (SEE MER OF FEB. 19, PAGE ').  THIS WAS 
THE FIRST TIME "HIZBULLAH" DEFINED ITS MILITANT POSITION 
AND IDEOLOGY SINCE IT MADE ITS IMPACT ON LEBANESE 
POLITICS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  THE MESSAGE IDENTIFIED 
THE MOSLEM FUNDAMENTALIST MEMBERS OF "HIZBALLAH" AS "THE 
CHILDREN OF THE NATION WHOSE VANGUARD IN IRAN WAS 
BESTOWED WITH VICTORY." 
 
"THIS VANGUARD," THE MESSAGE WENT ON, "HAS LAID THE 
FOUNDATION OF A PAN-ISLAMIC STATE UNDER THE WISE GUIDANCE 
OF THE FULLY QUALIFIED FAQIH AYATULLAH RUHALLAH KHOMEINI. 
"HIZBULLAH" MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT HAD NO CARD-CARRYING 
MEMBERS, "BUT IT IS LINKED TO ALL MOSLEMS IN THE WORLD 
BY THE STRONG IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL BOND OF ISLAM." 
 
EAST AND WEST:  THE STATEMENT ATTACKED THE "HAUTY" POWERS 
OF THE EAST AND WEST ALIKE.  IT SAID: "AMERICA HAS TRIED, 
THROUGH ITS LOCAL AGENTS, TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT 
THOSE WHO DESTROYED ITS ARROGANCE IN LEBANON AND FOILED 
ITS CONSPIRACIES WERE BUT A HANDFUL OF FANATIC TERRORISTS 
WHO HAVE NO MISSION BUT TO BLOW UP LIQUOR STORES, 
GAMBLING CASINOS AND AMUSEMENT MACHINES." 
 
THE STATEMENT POINTED OUT THAT SUCH PRACTICES WERE ONLY 
MARGINAL DEALING WITH THE TAIL INSTEAD OF THE HEAD. "WE 
ARE HEADED FOR DEALING WITH EVIL AT THE ROOTS, AND THE 
ROOTS ARE AMERICA," IT SAID, AND STRESSED THAT NOTHING 
WILL TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER FIGHTING THE U.S. 
"HIZBULLAH" BELIEVES THAT BOTH WESTERN CAPITALISM AND 
EASTERN COMMUNISM HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE THE REQUIREMENTS 
OF THE MASSES.  "THE ANSWER LIES IN THE MISSION OF ISLAM," 
IT SAID. 
 
DEMANDS:  THE DECLARATION DEMANDED: 1. COMPLETE EVACUATION 
OF ISRAEL ARMY FROM LEBANON "AS A PRELUDE FOR THE REMOVAL 
OF ISRAEL FROM EXISTENCE AND LIBERATING JERUSALEM FROM 
CLAWS OF OCCUPATION."  2. "AMERICA, FRANCE AND THEIR 
ALLIES MUST LEAVE LEBANON ONCE AND FOR ALL, AND ANY 
IMPERIAL INFLUENCE IN THE COUNTRY MUST BE TERMINATED." 
Â¶3. "THE PHALANGISTS MUST BE SUBJECTED TO JUSTICE AND BE 
BROUGHT TO TRIAL FOR ALL THE CRIMES THEY HAVE COMMITTED 
AGAINST THE MOSLEMS AND THE CHRISTIANS WITH ENCOURAGEMENT 
FROM AMERICAN AND ISRAEL."  4. "ALL OUR LEBANESE PEOPLE 
MUST BE GIVEN THE CHANCE OF DETERMINING THEIR FUTURE 
AND CHOOSES THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THEY WANT, BEARING 
IN MIND THAT WE WILL NOT GIVE UP OUR COMMITMENT TO THE 
RULE OF ISLAM." 
 
POLITICAL "MARONISM":  THE POLICY OF THE LEADERS OF 
"POLITICAL MARONISM" AS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE "LEBANESE 
FRONT" AND THE "LEBANESE FORCES" MILITIA CAN NEVER 
ACHIEVE PEACE OR STABILITY FOR THE CHRISTIANS, SAID 
"HIZBULLAH".  "IT IS A POLICY BASED ON FANATICISM, 
SECTARIAN PRIVILEGES AND ALLIANCE WITH IMPERIALISM AND 
ISRAEL," IT ADDED. 
 
UNIFIL:  THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE-KEEPING FORCE 
(UNIFIL) OPERATING IN SOUTH LEBANON, IS ACCUSED 
BY "HIZBULLAH" OF STANDING AS A "BUFFER" IMPEDING 
THEIR RESISTANCE AND "MAINTAINING ISRAELI'S 
SECURITY AND INVADING FORCES."  "HIZBULLAH" 
DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWDOWN 
WITH UNIFIL "IF IT CONTINUED TO CONNIVE WITH THE 
ENEMY." 
 
OTHER ARAB STATES "ANXIOUSLY SEEKING PEACE WITH 
ISRAEL" ALSO CAME UNDER FIRE FROM "HIZBULLAH". 
THEY WERE URGED INSTEAD TO CLOSE THEIR RANKS, 
DEFINE THEIR AIMS PRECISELY AND BREAK THE 
FETTERS RESTRICTING THEIR WILL. 
 
MARCH:  ARMED MEMBERS OF "HIZBULLAH WERE REPORTED 
TO HAVE MARCHED INTO SIDON MONDAY, FEB. 18, 
AND TORE LEBANESE FLAGS AND PICTURES OF PRESIDENT 
GEMAYEL.  (SEE MER OF FEB. 19, PAGE 2).  THEY 
SMASHED A NUMBER OF STORES AND SUPER MARKETS 
SELLING LIQUOR, AND RAISED IRANIAN FLAGS AND 
PORTRAITS OF THE IRANIAN RELIGIOUS LEADER 
AYATULLAH KHOMEINI.  THE ACTION WAS SEEN AS A 
BACKLASH TO THE VISIT TO THE CITY THE DAY BEFORE 
BY PRESIDENT GEMAYEL JEERED BY THE ARMED DEM- 
ONSTRATORS "THE SHAH OF LEBANON". 
 
THE GEMAYELS:  IN ITS STATEMENT, "HIZBULLAH" 
LASHED OUT AGAINST PRESIDENT AMIN GEMAYEL AND HIS 
BROTHER THE LATE BASHIR.  IT SAID:  "THE BUTCHER 
BASHIR HAD REACHED THE PRESIDENCY WITH THE 
HELP OF ISRAEL, THE ARAB OIL PRINCES AND SYCOPHANT 
MOSLEM MPS FLATTERING THE PHALANGISTS." 
 
"THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY AN ATTEMPT TO RECTIFY HIS 
REPUGNANT IMAGE BY AN EXERCISE CALLED THE 
"SALVATION COMMITTEE," WHICH WAS BUT AN 
AMERICAN-ISRAELI BRIDGE USED BY THE PHALANGISTS 
TO ACHIEVE CONTROL OVER THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE. 
HOWEVER, OUR PEOPLE COULD NOT TOLERATE SUCH 
HUMILIATION.  THEY DASHED THE DREAMS OF THE 
ZIONISTS AND THEIR ALLIES.  AMERICA NEVERTHELESS, 
PERSISTED IN ITS FOLLIES AND BROUGHT (PRESIDENT) 
AMIN GEMAYEL TO SUCCEED HIS BROTHER.  THE FIRST 
THING HE DID WAS TO DESTROY THE HOUSES OF THE 
DISPLACED PEOPLE FROM THE SOUTH, DEFILE THE 
ISLAMIC MOSQUES, ORDER THE ARMY TO BOMBARD THE 
DOWN-TRODDAN SUBURB AND DESTRUCT  THE HOUSES 
ON THEIR OCCUPANTS, AND TO CALL IN NATO FORCES 
TO HELP HIM AGAINST US, CONCLUDE THE NOTORIOUS 
17 MAY ACCORD WITH ISRAEL WHICH WOULD HAVE 
TRANSFORMED LEBANON INTO AN ISRAELI PROTECTORATE 
OR AN AMERICAN COLONY." 
 
U.S. AND NATO:  "HIZBULLAH" DECLARED "CLEARLY 
AND FRANKLY" THAT "WE FEAR NO ONE BUT GOD, AND 
WE CANNOT TOLERATE INJUSTICE, AGGRESSION AND 
HUMILIATION."  IT WENT ON TO ANNOUNCE:  "THE 
UNITED STATES AND ITS NATO PARTNERS AND THE 
ZIONIST STATE WHICH HAS USURPED THE HOLY ISLAM 
LAND OF PALESTINE, HAVE EXERCISED, AND ARE STILL 
EXERCISING AGGRESSION ON US WITH A VIEW TO 
HUMILIATING US.  WE, THEREFORE, ARE ALWAYS ON 
THE ALERT AND CONSTANTLY GIRDING OURSELVES TO 
REPEL THE AGGRESSION AND DEFEND OUR RELIGION, 
EXISTENCE AND DIGNITY."  END TEXT.
