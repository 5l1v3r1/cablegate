¶1.  (U) Post received a diplomatic note on December 18 from 
the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informing us of the 
re-nomination by Egypt of Ambassador Mushira Khattab as a

¶2.  (U) Text of MFA Diplomatic Note (Embassy translation): 
 
The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Office of the 
Deputy Assistant Minister for Multilateral Affairs, sends its 
best regards to the American Embassy in Cairo and would like 
to inform it that the Arab Republic of Egypt has decided to 
re-nominate Ambassador Mushira Khattab, Secretary General of 
the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood, for 
membership on the Committee on the Rights of the Child during 
the elections scheduled to take place on February 21, 2007 in 
New York (C.V. attached).  In light of the relations of 
constructive cooperation between our two countries, we hope 
that the Egyptian nomination for the membership of the 
above-mentioned committee would obtain the support of your 
honorable government.  The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Office of the Deputy Assistant Minister for 
Multilateral Affairs, avails itself of this opportunity to 
express its sincerest appreciation to the Embassy.
