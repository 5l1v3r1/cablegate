¶1. (SBU) Embassy delivered U.S. non-paper and fact sheet on 
October 25 after 9:00 am EST to the Ministry of Finance and 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, per request reftel.  A/DCM 
urged GOS officials to take parallel steps to isolate these 
entities from the international financial system and to 
designate IRGC, MODAFL, Banks Melli and Mellat, IRGC-Qods 
Force, and Bank Sedarat.  MFA State Secretary Andrej Ster 
said that Slovenia would have a fuller response on October 
¶26.  As a preliminary response, he said that Slovenia sees 
this as important for bilateral relations as well as 
globally.  He suggested that the EU would see and understand 
this as "a mutual task."  Embassy will follow up and report 
any additional response.
