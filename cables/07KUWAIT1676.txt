Imagery Analysis Request Status 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The 55th session of the TSC was held in Kuwait on 
November 11, 2007.  The U.S. delegation informed TSC 
participants that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency (NGA) assets were engaged in various operations and 
unable to provide imagery analysis assistance, as previously 
requested by the Kuwaiti delegation, to aid in the effort to 
locate mass grave sites in Iraq.  The ICRC, Kuwaiti, and 
Iraqi delegations reiterated their request for such technical 
assistances and offered to fly teams to Washington to meet 
with imagery analysts.  The Kuwaiti delegation added that 
reliable sources have indicated general locations of possible 
mass grave sites, and that analysis of aerial or satellite 
imagery taken from the 1990-1991 era over southern Iraq is 
needed to further pinpoint site locations. 
 
Witnesses 
--------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Iraqi delegation reported that its efforts to 
convince a witness with supposed knowledge of grave sites in 
Kuwait were to no avail.  Kuwait reiterated its assurances 
that no legal action would be taken against the witness 
should he come to Kuwait.  The ICRC encouraged continued 
efforts and expressed its hope for a positive result by the 
next TSC. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ICRC reported contact with a witness in London, but 
stated that he had no further information to add regarding 
the location of grave sites.  The TSC agreed to follow-up by 
forwarding written questions penned by the Iraqi delegation 
to the witness. 
 
¶5. The repatriation of 40 human remains took place 
successfully on September 5, 2007 and the National Committee 
for the Missing and PoW Affairs forwarded to the Iraqi 
delegation DNA profiles of the remains. 
 
Updates 
--------- 
 
¶6.  No exhumation activities were conducted by Kuwait.  The 
Kuwaiti delegation reported that to date, the identification 
of the remains of the following has been performed: 
 
--Remains found 
329 remains found in Iraq 
18 remains found in Kuwait 
 
--Identifications to date

New Iraqi Law 
 
KUWAIT 00001676  002 OF 003 
 
 
------------- 
 
¶7.  The Iraqi delegation explained that the GOI has entered 
into force a law on the protection of gravesites.  Since this 
law is not mentioned in the protocols set by the 25th TC 
meeting held in Baghdad in June 2003, the Iraqi delegation 
invited the TSC to establish a legal committee to amend TC 
protocol to include text of this law.  These amendments were 
adopted by the TC on November 13. 
 
Speicher Update 
--------------- 
 
¶8. There was no new information on CAPT. Michael S. 
Speicher's case.  His DNA profile remains in the Kuwaiti 
database and continues to be checked against all newly 
received profiles.  The U.S. delegation renewed its 
commitment to continue the effort to resolve CAPT. Speicher's 
case. 
 
Next TSC Meeting 
---------------- 
 
¶9. The next TSC meeting will take place on February 12, 2008 
in Kuwait.  The next Tripartite Commission Meeting will take 
place in Kuwait on November 12, 2008. 
 
¶10.  Activities to be undertaken before the next session are: 
 
- The U.S. delegation agreed to relay the request for use of 
satellite or high altitude imagery analysis to the U.S. 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and inform the 
ICRC of the outcome.  France and the UK also agreed to 
investigate with their respective governments whether any 
technical assistance is available to assist with this matter. 
 
 
- TC members will continue to try to convince suspected 
witnesses to provide details on mass graves sites. 
 
- The Kuwaiti delegation will continue to try to match DNA 
samples in the effort to resolve the case of CAPT. Speicher's 
case.
