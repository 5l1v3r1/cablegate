SUBJECT:  BRAZIL: MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AUTHORIZATIONS: UPDATED 
INFORMATION - 2009 
 
REF:  STATE 101996 
 
¶1.  Per REFTEL, Post's officers responsible for handling requests 
for marine scientific research authorizations are as follows: 
 
-  Environment, Science, Technology and Health (ESTH) Counselor 
Richard J. Driscoll - tel. 55 61 3312-7401, email 
DriscollRJ@state.gov (through summer 2010) 
 
-  ESTH Officer Jeremy W. Long - tel. 55 61-3312-7432 
LongJW@state.gov 
(through summer 2010) 
 
-  ESTH Assistant Jorge M. Nogueira - tel. 55 61 3312-7473, email: 
NogueiraJM@state.gov 
 
-  ESTH Assistant Daisy B. da Costa - tel. 55 61 3312-7432, email: 
CostaDBD@state.gov 
 
¶2.  The ESTH Office asked the Brazilian Ministry of External 
Relations' (MRE) Division of Oceans, Antarctic and Space (DMAE) for 
updated information about authorizations for marine scientific 
research in Brazilian waters.  According to Secretary Andre 
Makarenka there are no official changes to the requirements provided 
last year by DMAE.  He explained that requests for authorization 
should still be submitted at least one hundred and eighty (180) days 
in advance.  DMAE requires two forms to be submitted with the 
diplomatic note requesting authorization.  These are:  (1) the 
marine research authorization form required by the Brazilian Navy 
and (2) the radio frequency form required by the National 
Telecommunication Agency (or ANATEL - Agencia Nacional de 
Telecomunicacao).  Current versions of these forms have been sent to 
OES/OA. 
 
¶3.  The radio frequency authorization form is written in both 
Portuguese and English.  The Navy authorization form, however, is 
only in Portuguese; a translated version of that form has been sent 
to OES/OA.  Both forms can be completed in English and sent to the 
Embassy's ESTH office, which will translate them into Portuguese for 
submission to the Brazilian authorities, which insist on receiving 
all documentation in Portuguese. 
 
¶4.  The MRE emphasized that all the information requested on the 
forms must be provided in detail.
