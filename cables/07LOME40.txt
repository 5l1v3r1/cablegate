¶1.  Ambassador presented a copy of President's January 10 
address to Foreign Minister Zarifou Ayeva on January 11 and 
briefed the Minister on the new Iraq strategy. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador emphasized the themes of stability and 
importance of moderates gaining the upper hand over 
extremists in Baghdad and more widely.  Ayeva, a Muslim, 
appeared sympathetic to the argument that the fundamental 
distinction was not between Sunni and Shia but rather between 
moderates and extremists.
