¶1.  Post requests FY 2008 ESF and INCLE funding for the 
baseline assessment project summarized below. 
 
¶A. Applicant name: Post is in the process of determining 
which NGO will be most capable of conducting such a baseline 
assessment.  KURET, a local NGO, has done a recent and quite 
excellent study of child labor in Rwanda, and would be a 
natural fit for this sort of program; we are exploring their 
interest and other options. 
 
¶B. Requested funding amount: $200,000, 100 percent federal 
share. 
 
¶C. Project title: Trafficking Assessment and Strategic Policy 
Development 
 
¶D. Project duration: Twelve months 
 
¶E. Proposal abstract: Rwanda is currently ranked as a Tier 2 
trafficking country.  One of the greatest challenges facing 
the Government of Rwanda (GOR) as it attempts to combat 
trafficking is a lack of resources, including reliable 
statistics.  Trafficking is not perceived as a major problem 
here.  The efforts the GOR devotes to its elimination compete 
with other key national priorities.  We propose that a 
baseline assessment of the extent and character of 
trafficking in Rwanda be undertaken, and that the results be 
utilized to develop a national anti-trafficking strategy. 
 
The assessment's results will be shared with the GOR and 
other stakeholders (including the police, local government, 
members of civil society and NGOs) through a series of 
workshops that lead to the development and implementation of 
an anti-trafficking strategy.  This project will increase the 
capacity of the Rwandan government to understand the scope 
and nature of trafficking and to combat it -- be it through 
tailored services for trafficking victims, increased police 
training, or other prevention and treatment programs.
