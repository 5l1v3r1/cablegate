ATTACK ON AMIS IN HASKANITA 
--------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On the evening of September 29 the AMIS Military Group 
Site (MGS) in Haskanita came under brazen attack by an unidentified 
force using small arms fire, machine gun fire, and rocket-propelled 
grenades, but the attack was repulsed.  In the early hours of 
September 30, the MGS was attacked again and this time overrun. 
AMIS issued a statement confirming that 10 AMIS soldiers were 
killed, seven injured, and some fifty missing.  Although AMIS 
patrols have become involved in clashes before, this is the first 
attack on an MGS. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At the AMIS morning briefing in El Fasher, the Chief of 
Staff reported that Force Commander Agwai was preparing to fly to Al 
Daein in South Darfur, where relief troops are staging, including 
troops from the Nyala and Muhajeria MGSs.  The Chief of Staff 
further noted that all the buildings in the MGS had been ransacked 
or burned.  He added that the relief column would advance to 
Haskanita when the area is cleared by the Sudanese Armed Forces 
(SAF), who would also evacuate the wounded if required.  According 
to United Nations security personnel, both they and AMIS have 
received permission from the Sudanese government to conduct flights 
into the area.

SPECULATION AS TO WHO AND WHY 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An AMIS press statement issued the afternoon of September 
30 did not address what forces conducted the attack or the 
nationalities of those killed.  However, MGS Haskanita is in a 
sector manned by Nigerian troops.  There were also reports that a 
Senegalese CivPol officer was killed. In the morning briefing, the 
Chief of Staff speculated that the attack had been carried out by 
SLA/Unity, since, he noted, the JEM had left that area four days 
previously.  As for motive, he speculated it may have been SLA/Unity 
frustration that AMIS had not been able to halt SAF air attacks 
against them. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The general sense among AMIS contacts is shock, but also 
shame that they were not able to come to the aid of their comrades 
under attack. A military observer expressed concern that this may 
not be the last such attack. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Further reporting will be provided septel.
