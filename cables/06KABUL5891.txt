SUBJECT: PRT/PANSHJIR: KABUL-PANJSHIR RELATIONS PART II: 
THE CAPITAL IN THE PROVINCE 
 
REF: KABUL 5810 
 
KABUL 00005891  001.3 OF 003 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Several events this year have attracted 
GOA officials from Kabul to Panjshir, but there is no steady 
flow of central government visits.  Since his election, 
President Karzai has yet to visit the province.  The Panjshir 
Governor, although appointed by the GOA, operates more as a 
Panjshir envoy to the capital than a Kabul representative in 
the province.  The valley has benefited from very few GOA 
funded "pork projects".  The improved road link has brought 
Kabul closer to the province.  Traffic has increased 
three-fold this year in and out of the valley, much of it 
from Kabul.  Indeed, the road may have started a process of 
"Kabulization" of the valley, but it still lacks a strong GOA 
component.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) In terms of political, commercial and 
people-to-people ties, the PRT has witnessed several dramatic 
changes between Panjshir and Kabul this past year.  This is 
the second of two messages on the subject.  Part I (reftel) 
examined the role of Panjshiris in Kabul.  Part II reports on 
Kabulites in Panjshir.

Kabulites in Panjshir: Locals Disappointed With Them 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3. (U) As noted in reftel, several Panjshiris hold positions 
of prominence in the central government in Kabul, including 
First vice-president Massoud, National Directorate of 
Security (NDS) Director Saleh, Wolesi Jirga Speaker Qanooni, 
Meshrano Jirga members Fahim Khan and Aref Sarwari, and Army 
Chief of Staff Bismullah Khan.  They all have large houses, 
with the exception of Qanooni, and numerous relatives in the 
valley.  They are occasional visitors to the home province, 
most frequently on summer weekends.  The improved road has 
shortened the commute from Kabul to under three hours. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In the popular perception, however, these 
Panjshiris have not established a community presence nor 
exercised much local leadership.  The PRT hears frequent 
complaints that the GOA Panjshiris have failed to direct 
developmental funds to Panjshir.  They have, to be sure, 
supported a few local projects out of their own pockets, but 
only after arm-twisting from the Governor.  For example, 
Aref, Saleh and Former FM Abdullah have all underwritten 
schools near their homes.  Fahim Khan is single-handedly 
financing the new central mosque with USD 135,000.  Bismullah 
Khan helped build a mosque in his neighborhood.  VP Massoud 
is a leader of the Massoud Foundation, which is involved in 
several projects in Panjshir. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) But Panjshiris tell us they expect more GOA funding 
as a result of their high-powered delegation in Kabul.  A 
refrain we hear is that the Panjshir officials in Kabul are 
more interested in their personal welfare than in the 
province's well-being.

Non-Panjshir Kabul Officials: Even Less Focus on the Valley 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The non-Panjshir officials in Kabul are an even 
scarcer presence in the province.  President Karzai has yet 
to visit Panjshir since his election, despite repeated 
invitations, according to the Governor.  Locals recall he 
attended a commemoration for Ahmed Shah Massoud several years 
ago.  Our contacts tell us Karzai enjoys little popularity in 
the valley, in part because Panjshiris believe Karzai has 
willfully neglected the valley.  According to Parliamentarian 
Aref, Panjshiris suspect Karzai ignores them because they 
voted overwhelmingly for native son Qanooni in the 2004 
elections.  A USAID-supported Town Hall Meeting, held July 20 
in Panjshir, proved to be a useful forum for airing of views.

 It was also notable, for the Governor and other Panjshiris, 
because the invited GOA officials did not attend.

Positive trend 
-------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) Despite the spotty presence of the GOA in Panjshir, 
four events this year, all supported by the PRT, attracted 
GOA officials to the valley: 
 
-- On March 26, the Governor organized a "Civic Pride Day" 
with the attendance of WJ speaker Qanooni, WJ member (and 
former President) Rabbani, Parliamentarian Regestani, 
Parliamentarian (and former Defense Minister) Fahim Khan and 
Energy and Water Minister Ismael Khan. 
 
-- On September 10, Panjshir hosted a commemoration of the 
fifth anniversary of Ahmed Shah Massoud,s death.  It brought 
together the biggest assembly of GOA officials in the valley 
at any single time:  VP Massoud, Saleh, Bismalluh Khan, 
Senator Aref, WJ member Rabbani and Ministry of 
Rehabilitation and Rural Development (MRRD) Minister Zia. 
Former office-holders were also present, including former 
Foreign Minister Abdullah. 
 
-- On September 23, as arranged by the Ambassador, a 
discussion forum took up matters related to the Panjshir road 
project.  The Deputy Minister of Public Works, Roosili, 
visited the valley for the first time in a public setting. 
He was accompanied by two Panjshir parliamentarians, 
Regestani and Azatyar.  They engaged with local leaders on 
road issues, such as the decision to use a non-asphalt 
surface.  Regestani noted the importance of the improved road 
in connecting the capital and the province, and portrayed 
himself as a link between the government in the Kabul and the 
people in Panjshir. 
 
-- On October 11, another event served to profile GOA 
officials in Panjshir.  Speakers at the opening of the 
Teachers, Training College included WJ Speaker Qanooni and 
Deputy Minister of Education Ghaznawi.  The Governor praised 
Army Chief of Staff Bismullah Khan for transferring the 
building from his ministry to that of education; and thanked 
the Education Minister for officially designating the 
building a teachers, academy. 
 
¶8.  (U) Three of these four events have taken place this 
fall, suggesting a positive trend of a more active GOA 
presence in the valley.  Asked if he regarded these events as 
an emerging pattern, Senator Aref concurred, but added that 
resources were still not flowing from Kabul to Panjshir as a 
result.

Resident GOA officials 
---------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Panjshiris tend to view their Governor and line 
directors as provincial envoys to Kabul rather than GOA 
representatives in the province.  Drawing on the Commanders' 
Emergency Relief Projects (CERP) funding, the PRT has 
supported the Governor and two of the line directors -- 
education and health -- who have demonstrated competence and 
commitment.  The PRT has encouraged them to use our support 
to leverage the GOA for additional resources.  A successful 
example pertains to the Teachers, Academy (see para 7 
above).  The best-resourced line directory in the valley is 
MRRD; but, with its reputation for substandard work, it does 
not represent the GOA with distinction. 
 
-------------- 
"Kabulization" 
-------------- 
 
KABUL 00005891  003 OF 003 
 
 
 
¶10.  (U) In one respect, Kabul has significantly increased 
its presence in the valley. The USAID-supported road projects 
have now almost completed a paved link between the capital 
and the province.  According to the police at the mouth of 
the valley, traffic in and out of Panjshir has increased 
three-fold this past year, much of it from Kabul.  Kabulites 
often visit Panjshir on weekends as a respite from the 
crowded, dusty metropolis.  Commerce, too, has picked up from 
Kabul, especially in the form of truck traffic, now more 
profitable given the better roads.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU) There is more Panjshir in Kabul than Kabul in 
Panjshir, although the GOA has achieved a modest expansion of 
its presence in Panjshir this year.  The PRT has assisted by 
supporting events that draw GOA officials and by resourcing 
GOA officials resident in the province, including the 
Governor and the few strong line directors.  Perhaps most 
importantly, the USG has helped through its 
multi-million-dollar road projects. END COMMENT.
