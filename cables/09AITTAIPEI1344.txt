SUBJECT: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRIP TO ASIA 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage November 11-12 on Taiwan's plans to sign a financial 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China; on the arrival in 
Taiwan of the first batch of U.S. bone-in-beef and the boycott by 
the opposition DPP and civic groups; and the cull of more than 9,000 
ducks in Kaohsiung after the ducks were found to be contaminated 
with dioxin.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, a column in 
the China-focused "Want Daily" commented on United States President 
Barack Obama's upcoming trip to Asia.  The column said the most 
important message that President Obama wants to deliver to Asian 
countries is that the United States wants to return to Asia and 
reinforce its engagement with Asian countries.  End summary. 
 
"The Significance of Obama's Asian Trip" 
 
Liu Fu-kuo, a research fellow at the Institute of International 
Relations (IIR) of National Chengchi University, wrote in a column 
in the China-focused "Want Daily" [circulation: 10,000] (11/11): 
 
"... In [reality], there is a trend that the United States actually 
has no alternative but to cooperate with China.  [Because] the 
United States is actively seeking China's cooperation, it will have 
a [major] effect on the international community.  However, this 
trend will gradually create a [bi-polar] structure internationally. 
China's influence [in the world] will be expanded [even more]. 
 
"Presently, Asia's importance has risen significantly.  Especially 
after the global financial crisis, the wealth and economic power in 
the world have gradually shifted to Asia.  The United States dares 
not ignore such a fact.  The White House spokesman once told the 
media that the main purpose of President Obama's trip [to Asia] was 
to improve the United States' cooperation with Asian countries and 
to strengthen exchanges [with Asian countries] on bilateral issues 
and issues of significant global interest.  Strengthening the United 
States' engagement in Asia is a strong policy message that Obama 
wants to send with this trip."
