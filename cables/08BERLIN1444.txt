RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 111744 
 
(SBU) Poloffs delivered reftel points on October 22 to MFA 
Office Director for Defense and Security Policy Bernhard 
Schlagheck.  Although Schlagheck assured that he would raise 
the points with his disarmament colleagues, he expected 
Germany to remain firm in its support for the de-alerting 
resolution.  He acknowledged that the current wording of 
resolution does not reflect stringent U.S. procedures in 
place regarding nuclear weapons, and informed Poloffs that 
MFA had sent a cable to the German UN Mission in New York 
concerning the resolution's wording.  Germany plans to raise 
this concern with the Swedes in New York.
