In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan Defends Gul's Presidential Candidacy 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan told the press after a 
party meeting Wednesday he believed Turkey would complete the 
presidential election due next week with "democratic maturity," in 
an effort to dismiss fears of a clash with the secular elite.   In 
his first public comments since Gul announced his candidacy, Erdogan 
also said he fully supported the FM's bid to become head of state, 
quashing speculation that he had not wanted Gul to run.  In remarks 
seen by the papers as a response to earlier comments from Chief of 
Staff General Buyukanit that the president should be "loyal to the 
principles of the republic - not just in words but in essence," 
Erdogan said Gul is what he says he is.  On the issue of Gul's wife 
wearing a headscarf, Erdogan said the wife of Ataturk also wore a 
headscarf.  Papers took exception to the remark, pointing out that 
Ataturk's wife did not wear the headscarf of political Islam, but 
sometimes wore a traditional Turkish head covering.  The PM also 
underlined Gul's candidacy was welcomed both at home and outside 
Turkey.  "In telephone conversations, we have heard that political 
leaders outside Turkey are pleased with regard to Gul's candidacy. 
It strengthens Turkey's position among the world countries.  We may 
have the opportunity to carry out more active work in the EU 
process," said Erdogan. 
 
Gul Tours NGOs, Labor Unions to Garner Support 
All papers report that on Wednesday, Abdullah Gul paid visits to the 
Turkish Confederation of Employers' Unions (TISK), the Confederation 
of Revolutionary Trade Unions (DISK), and the Turkish Union of 
Chambers (TOBB) in an effort to seek support for his presidential 
bid.  TOBB president Rifat Hisarciklioglu said Gul was a good 
candidate for the presidency, adding that for the sake of democracy 
everybody should respect the preferences of the parliament.  Gul 
told reporters after his round of talks that his headscarf-wearing 
wife will not be a problem.  Gul said wearing the headscarf was his 
wife's personal choice which should be respected within the 
framework of individual rights.  "It is me who is running for 
president, not my wife" said Gul.  Gul was pleased with his round of 
talks with civil society organizations, papers report. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Gul as New President 
Hasan Cemal writes in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "Gul may be not 
the one for all.  Some may like him, some may not.  Some may think 
that he is not suitable for the presidency.  Yet the course of 
democracy goes through respect for different views and tolerating 
others.  In democracies, any kind of thinking is welcomed as long as 
the rules are respected.  It is not right to make an argument about 
the legitimacy of Gul's candidacy.  Everything is moving along 
according to constitutional principles; therefore, there is no room 
for a debate over legitimacy.  The ruling AKP, by garnering the vast 
majority of the votes, certainly has the right to bring its 
candidate up to the presidential palace.  This is not pushing the 
limits.  If you ask me, the military's warning on April 27 was 
pushing the limits.  Turkey needs no tension, no conflict.  We have 
to interpret the results of the July 22 election in the right 
context.  We should feel relief and go for stability." 
 
Soli Ozel writes in the mainstream daily Sabah: "When Gul announced 
his candidacy for the first time some four months ago, Turkey went 
through a crisis period.  Today we have come back to exactly where 
we were.  Nevertheless the four-month period, even though tension 
filled, has brought some positive lessons.  First of all, by 
announcing Gul once again for the presidency, the ruling AKP 
declared that it will not take 'unwritten rules of the regime' into 
consideration.  In other words, the headscarf will not be an 
obstacle, and Turkey will have to live with the new situation.  This 
stance of the AKP does not necessarily constitute defiance of the 
army but it is a step toward political normalization.  Given his 
past record, Gul will certainly be an active president.  Turkey has 
a challenging period ahead due to international issues.  Gul, with

his foreign ministry experience, will be able to engage in 
international relations more than before.  Turkey is heading toward 
a new era, and if it is managed properly, Turkey will create a 
unique model in world politics." 
 
Erdogan to Submit His Cabinet List to Sezer Today 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan is expected to submit the 
new cabinet list to President Sezer on Thursday.  The total number 
of ministers in the cabinet will increase from 22 to 24.  Papers 
claim that some ministries such The Ministry for Culture and Tourism 
will be divided into two.  Zaman says a new ministry for water, 
metals and Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) will be set up. 
Radikal expects a new ministry in charge of EU negotiations. 
Hurriyet thinks there will be two new ministries - one for water and 
one for motorways.  Vatan says that as a gesture, Gul will be placed 
in the new cabinet list as Deputy PM and Foreign Minister so that he 
can officially retain the posts until he assumes the role of 
president.  If Sezer vetoes any of the ministers, Erdogan will 
resubmit his list to the new president expected to be elected in the 
third round of voting in parliament on August 28. 
 
Glocks Seized at Habur Border Gate 
Mainstream Sabah reports that five Glock guns were seized at the 
Habur Border Gate, the crossing point between Iraq and Turkey.  In a 
written statement, the Sirnak Governor's Office stated that the 
Glocks were seized in a Turkish truck, entering Turkey from Iraq. 
 
PKK Bomber Arrested in Istanbul 
Sabah, Milliyet, Vatan and others:  Papers report that a PKK member 
named Nimet Turkan was arrested in Istanbul yesterday while he was 
delivering 8 kg of A-4 plastic explosives and one kg of TNT powder 
explosives he brought from Diyarbakir to PKK bombers in Istanbul. 
Mainstream Milliyet reported that the suspect claimed that the PKK 
forced him to deliver the explosives to Istanbul with a threat that 
they would kill his eight children otherwise.
