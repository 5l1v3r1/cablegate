In June 2005, President Bush designated the Atomic Energy 
Organization of Iran (AEOI) and the Aerospace Industries 
Organization (AIO) in the Annex to Executive Order 13382 
("Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Proliferators and Their Supporters"). 
 
Pars Trash Company and Farayand Technique were designated on 
June 8, 2007 pursuant to E.O. 13382 because they are owned or 
controlled by, or act or purport to act for or on behalf of 
AEOI and/or the Kalaye Electric Company, an AEOI subsidiary 
also designated under E.O. 13382. 
 
The AEOI and Kalaye were both named in the Annex to UNSCR 
1737 for their involvement in Iran's nuclear program. 
 
Pars Trash Company and Farayand Technique were also listed in 
the Annex to UNSCR 1737, issued on December 23, 2006, for 
their involvement in Iran's centrifuge program and 
identification in reports of the International Atomic Energy 
Organization (IAEA). 
 
According to IAEA reports, Iran disclosed the existence of 
these two entities in October of 2003 and indicated that they 
were involved in the domestic production of centrifuge 
components.  In January 2004, it was revealed to the IAEA 
that Pars Trash and Farayand were subsidiaries of the Kalaye 
Electric Company, an AEOI subsidiary. 
 
According to the IAEA, Farayand Technique has had a number of 
different roles in Iran's centrifuge enrichment program. 
Farayand Technique performs quality control on components 
used at the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.  Farayand 
Technique also has capabilities suitable for the testing and 
assembly of centrifuges. 
 
The Pars Trash Company has been identified by the IAEA as a 
site used by Natanz and the Kalaye Electric company to store 
centrifuge equipment. 
 
Mohammad Qannadi was designated on June 15, 2007 pursuant to 
E.O. 13382 he acts or purports to act for or on behalf of the 
AEOI.  Ali Hajinia Leilabadi was designated on June 15, 2007, 
because he acts or purports to act for or on behalf of the 
Mesbah Energy Company, an AEOI subsidiary. 
 
Mohammad Maraghe Ghannadi is AEOI's Vice President for 
research and development and is also named in the Annex to 
UNSCR 1737, together with Ali Hajinia Leilabadi, who is 
identified by the UN as being the Director General of the 
Mesbah Energy Company.  The Mesbah Energy Company, an AEOI 
front company used to procure products for Iran's heavy water 
project, was designated under E.O. 13382 in January 2006. 
The Mesbah Energy Company is identified in the Annex to UNSCR 
1737 as being a provider for the A40 research reactor at 
Arak.  In August 2006, Ghannadi and Leilabadi were among 14 
Iranian nuclear scientists recognized by the Iranian 
president and awarded medals for their research and 
management activities. 
 
Fajr Industries Group was designated on June 8, 2007 pursuant 
to E.O. 13382 because it is subordinate to the AIO and 
involved in the production and acquisition of precision 
equipment for missile guidance and control systems.  Fajr has 
consistently procured a wide range of missile guidance and 
control equipment on behalf of the AIO over the years.  Since 
the late 1990s, Fajr has purchased high strength steel alloy, 
useful for guidance equipment in ballistic missiles and 
missile related technology/items. 
 
Fajr Industries Group was also recently identified in the 
Annex to UNSCR 1737 for its involvement in Iran's ballistic 
missile program. 
 
Mizan Machine Manufacturing Group was designated on June 8, 
2007 pursuant to Executive Order 13382, because it is owned 
or controlled by, or acts or purports to act for or on behalf 
of the AIO and the Shahid Hemmat Industries Group (SHIG), 
which is also designated under E.O. 13382. 
 
Mizan Machine Manufacturing Group is one of several front 
companies utilized by the AIO in commercial transactions.  In 
particular, Mizan Machine Manufacturing Group has been used 
by the AIO to acquire sensitive material for Iran's ballistic 
missile program.  For example, in April 2005, Mizan purchased 
a state-of-the-art crane for Iran's weapons program.  An 
investigation of this transaction determined the crane was 
probably intended for use in Iran's Shahab missile program. 
Cranes can be used to support missiles, like the Shahab, in 
the field or at storage facilities.  Also in 2005, Mizan was 
connected to the acquisition of equipment, on behalf of SHIG, 
that could be used to calibrate guidance and control 
instruments for more accurate targeting of Iran's ballistic 
missiles.

We look forward to working with you on this and other related 
security matters and are prepared to provide additional 
assistance as appropriate.
