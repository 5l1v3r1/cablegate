SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN BROKER INQUIRY - CASE NO. K-2488 
 
REF: 09 STATE 94793; A 
 
¶1.   (U)  PolOff conducted a Blue Lantern inspection of Custom 
Aeronautical Support (CAS), Ltd. at 28B Moorhaus Avenue in 
Christchurch, New Zealand on 16 September, 2009 to verify the bona 
fides of broker Farooq (Greg) I. Gaba, case no. K-2488.  CAS 
appears to be a legitimate business, and PolOff witnessed a current 
GNZ Civil Aviation Authority business license. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  Reftel lists CAS' business address as:  Unit 3, 46 
Maunsell Street, Woolston, Christchurch.  The company still 
operates a warehouse at this location; however, its new 
headquarters is located at the Moorhaus Avenue address.  The two 
facilities are a ten minute drive from each other. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U)  Mr. Farooq, CAS' sole proprietor, is a dual U.S./New 
Zealand citizen with an Electrical Engineering degree from the 
University of Southern California.  The company primarily sells 
aviation components for Boeing, Airbus, Fokker, Hercules, and 
EuroCopter aircraft.  Mr. Farooq stated that his company does not 
sell weapons of any type, and they do not sell night vision 
devices.  Post has no derogatory information about this individual. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U)  CAS has been in business for four years and has 12 
employees, all of whom normally work at the Moorhaus Avenue 
location.  Most of the company's parts inventory is stored at the 
Maunsell Street warehouse, an unmanned 800 square meter structure 
that is locked and has a 24 hour alarm system.  Any inventory 
stored at the Moorhaus Avenue facility is monitored by the 
warehouse technician or his backup during business hours.  This 
facility is locked and an alarm system is activated at all other 
times. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  CAS' customers include civil aviation companies and 
government entities in New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, 
Pakistan, and Papua New Guinea.  It also has a blanket export 
license to trade with Taiwan.  According to Mr. Gaba, CAS does not 
do business with countries under U.S. or international export 
sanctions or with state sponsors of terrorism.  He has been 
approached by Chinese companies but has found it too difficult to 
do business in that country.  Mr. Farooq understands the 
restrictions on United States Munitions List items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports.
