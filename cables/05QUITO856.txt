Â¶1.  PolOff delivered reftel points via Diplomatic Note on 
August 14 to Dack Martinez of the MFA's Office of Special 
Organizations.  In a meeting on April 18, Martinez told 
PolOff that Ecuador, along with GRULAC, would oppose as 
improper the EU member states proposal to grant European 
Community enhanced participation rights in the negotiations 
on the draft Cultural Diversity Convention.  Martinez said 
the GOE believes only individual countries should be allowed 
to participate.
