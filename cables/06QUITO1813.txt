REF: STATE 112656 
 
Â¶1.  PolOffs met with Director General for Multilateral 
Affairs Lourdes Puma on July 20 to discuss RefTel points. 
Puma told us that President Alfredo Palacio and Foreign 
Minister Francisco Carrion would likely attend the 61st UNGA 
General Debate September 19-29, but said that she could not 
yet confirm their attendance.  Puma said that the GOE would 
also likely seek high-level bilateral meetings with USG 
officials to discuss a number of pending issues, alluding to 
stalled FTA talks and ATPDEA extension.  She promised to 
contact us when she had more exact details on the visit.
