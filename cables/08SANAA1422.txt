SUBJECT: TWO YEMENI BAHA'IS RELEASED FROM JAIL; IRANIAN AND 
IRAQI BAHA'IS REMAIN IMPRISONED 
 
REF: SANAA 1404 
 
¶1. (SBU) The two detained Yemeni Baha'is (reftel) were 
released on August 19.  The four other remaining imprisoned 
Baha'is, three Iranians and one Iraqi, are still detained in 
a Sanaa Criminal Investigation Department prison, pending 
further investigation.  No official charges have yet been 
filed against them. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Legatt office continues to attempt to reach the 
Prosecutor General, but has still had no success thus far. 
In an August 21 conversation with presidential secretary 
Faris Sanabani, Poloff urged that the remaining imprisoned 
Baha'is should be released and not be deported, as they would 
likely face religious persecution in their home countries. 
Sanabani said that the ROYG is working to bring about a 
positive and swift end to the case, adding that he will take 
the message back to his government. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Poloff maintains continuous contact with 
al-Anisi, as well as with the Sanaa Baha'i community.  (Note: 
 Poloff asked to meet the two released Yemeni Baha'is, but 
was told by members of the Sanaa Baha'i community that the 
men may not be ready for such a meeting at the moment.  End 
Note).  Post will continue to report any new developments. 
End Comment.
