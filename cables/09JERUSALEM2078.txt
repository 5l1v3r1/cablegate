SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/19): Continued settlement 
activity and home demolitions dominate the Palestinian press 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies prominently report on President Obama's statement 
in reaction to the Israeli government's approval of constructing 900 
housing units in Gilo. The headlines quote President Obama as saying 
that "this action embitters the Palestinians in a way that could end 
up being very dangerous." Al-Hayat Al-Jadida quotes the President as 
saying "I think that additional settlement building does not 
contribute to Israel's security, I think it makes it harder for them 
to make peace with their neighbors." Al-Quds considered Obama's 
statement a "strong message" that reflects the critical status of 
the peace process. Maan reported that this was a rare personal 
pronouncement on the subject. The dailies also report on Prime 
Minister Salam Fayyad strongly condemning the Israeli decision, 
saying "these Israeli measures prove that our position of resorting 
to the UN to seek international recognition of a Palestinian state 
was correct." 
 
The lead photos in all dailies are of Israeli bulldozers demolishing 
a Palestinian house, two stores and a women's center in the 
Essawiyeh neighborhood in East Jerusalem yesterday. Al-Quds quotes 
Fatah official for Jerusalem Affairs Hatem Abdel Qader noting that 
there is an unprecedented Israeli wave of demolishing homes in East 
Jerusalem and noted that since the beginning of 2009, the Israeli 
authorities have issued more than 2300 demolition orders against 
Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem. 
 
Under its lead headline, Al-Ayyam reports "Israel challenges the 
whole world by laying the corner stone of a new settlement in Jabal 
Al-Mukabber neighborhood in East Jerusalem yesterday." The coverage 
notes that American Jews who came to Israel to buy houses in East 
Jerusalem and the West Bank participated in the ceremony. The 
coverage also notes that Israel refused to authorize a Palestinian 
request to construct 200 housing units in East Jerusalem. 
 
Al-Quds reports on the Israeli authorities obstructing a high court 
decision to evacuate settlers from a building in the Silwan area of 
East Jerusalem yesterday. 
 
News on the prisoners exchange deal between Israel and Hamas 
receives front page coverage in the dailies. The reports quote 
several sources saying that the deal might be implemented on the 
first day of the Al-Adha feast. The news wasn't confirmed by Hamas 
or Israeli officials. 
 
The dailies report on the Al-Aqsa Foundation for religious and 
cultural heritage noting that Israel started construction for two 
tunnels and two elevators that will facilitate the access of more 
tourists and settlers to the mosque. 
------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds runs an editorial under the title "Continued Settlements and 
Repeated International Hypocrisy" (11/19): "The international 
community is condemning Israel for continued settlement activities, 
but at the same time does not support the Palestinians obtaining 
international recognition of their state. This international 
hypocrisy will continue as long as the power is with Israel and the 
Palestinians are helpless."
