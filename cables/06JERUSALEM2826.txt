REF: JERUSALEM 2068 
 
¶1.  (SBU) World Food Programme (WFP) Information Officer 
Kirstie Campbell told EconOff July 4 that the IDF continues 
to prohibit fishing off the coastline of Gaza and that none 
of the 3,000 licensed fishermen have been allowed to fish 
since June 25.  Head of the El-Tawafeek Fishermen Association 
Mohammed Zaqout told EconOff July 6 that Israeli naval boats 
had fired on fishermen trying to get into the water to cast a 
net.  As a result, WFP and Zaqout estimate that fishermen are 
losing a combined total of USD 25,000 per day in revenues. 
According to WFP, 35,000 Palestinians rely on the fishing 
industry for subsistence (reftel). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Zaqout said the El-Tawafeek Fishermen Association 
had lent USD 1 million in fuel, nets, and ice on credit in 
the past several months to the fishermen in Gaza.  They had 
purchased this equipment through the ongoing collection of 
membership dues.  However, none of the fishermen have been 
able to make payments because of the IDF prohibition on 
fishing. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) USAID staff reported that the stalls at the fish 
market are empty and that frozen fish stocks were running low 
due to the loss of permanent refrigeration capacity that has 
resulted from the electricity outages.  Canned fish is 
reportedly selling for NIS 5 (USD 1.12) per can.  (Note: 
After the Avian Influenza outbreak in Gaza and the culling of 
400,000 poultry, the price of fish, especially sardines, has 
doubled in price since fish is considered a major alternative 
source of protein for Gazans.  End Note.)
