(SBU)  Rwanda has three battalions participating in the AMIS 
peacekeeping mission.  As noted in reftel, the GOR expressed 
strong support for the transfer of two battalions to the UN 
Heavy Support Package.  The GOR stands ready to contribute a 
fourth battalion to the peacekeeping operations, although it 
continues to express reservations regarding logistical 
support and reimbursement for AMIS expenses.
