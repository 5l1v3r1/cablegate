SUBJECT: SPLM APPOINTS CHAIRMAN IN ABYEI 
 
¶1. (SBU) Amidst ongoing border clashes in the Abyei region, the SPLM 
has appointed Edward Lino as "SPLM Chairman in Abyei area."  In his 
capacity as Chairman of the SPLM, First Vice President of Sudan and 
President of the Government of Southern Sudan Salva Kiir issued an 
"SPLM Chairman's Decree" on December 31 appointing Lino.  According 
to the text of the decree, a copy of which was passed to CG Juba, 
Chairman Lino "shall head the Abyei Interim Political Committee and 
shall organize the people of Abyei politically and administratively 
within the general SPLM policies and the provisions of the CPA." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minister of Presidential Affairs Luka Biong Deng passed 
visiting polchief a copy of the decree January 2, explaining that 
the intent of the appointment is to show the commitment of the SPLM 
to the people of Abyei.  Deng said the SPLM would not "abandon" the 
people of Abyei without any support or means of administration 
during the continuing standoff with the National Congress Party 
(NCP) over the border. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Deng explained the appointment in the context of on-going 
clashes along the Abyei border.  He said the Misseriya Popular 
Defense Force (PDF) militias, supported by the Sudanese Armed Forces 
(SAF), had initiated the attacks in an attempt to complicate and 
delay resolution of the Abyei dispute.  In a separate meeting 
January 3, SPLA Minister of Defense Dominic Dim Deng claimed that 
the Misseriya PDF had been armed and were being "pushed forward" by 
the SAF to attack SPLA units.  He said it is clear that the SAF is 
arming the Misseriya because they are using gun-mounted vehicles, 
artillery, mortars, and rocket-fired grenades. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: With the appointment of Lino, who is from Abyei, 
the SPLM hopes to gain further support from the people of this 
exploited but administratively neglected region.  However the SPLM 
will need to invest money and provide services, not just announce a 
party representative, if their intent is truly to bring 
"administration" to Abyei.  The true objective of the decree is more 
likely for the SPLM to thumb its nose at Khartoum and demonstrate 
publicly that the SPLM will not abandon Abyei despite the NCP's 
continued stall tactics.  No doubt the SPLM also wants to put 
pressure on Khartoum to accept the Abyei Boundary Commission report 
so that the "interim administration" called for the in Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement may be put in place.
