SUBJECT: TFGG01:  DEMARCHE ON TRANSPORT OF HUMANITARIAN 
SUPPLIES TO GEORGIA 
 
REF: STATE 087716 
 
On August 15 we delivered reftel demarche to Acting MFA 
Fourth CIS Director Dmitriy Tarabrin and DATT delivered it to 
the Ministry of Defense.  The MFA and MOD raised no 
objections and made no substantive comments.  Nevertheless, 
Deputy Chief of Army Staff Anatoly Nogovitsyn charged 
publicly on August 15 that Russia had no information on the 
true type of the U.S. assistance, suggesting it could be 
military in nature.  Post will rebut these allegations 
through press channels.
