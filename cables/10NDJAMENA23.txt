SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SRSG Victor Angelo told the resident diplomatic 
and IO corps in N'Djamena January 11 that he was in the 
process of framing his end-of-first-year report to the SYG 
and UN Security Council on the performance of the MINURCAT 
PKO since its inception last March. The report, due in 
February, will set the stage for formal discussions of 
mandate renewal.  Angelo said also that the security 
situation for civilians in Eastern Chad had improved over the 
past month, and that there was significant progress on civil 
affairs projects that will benefit the eastern part of nation 
over the coming year.  END SUMMARY. 
¶2.  (SBU)  Much of the SRSG,s presentation concerned the 
overall security situation in Eastern Chad and MINURCAT,s 
contribution to its improvement/stabilization.  Angelo 
described 256 serious security incidents over the past year, 
including car-jackings (57), break-ins (53), thefts (21) and 
kidnappings (three).  He noted that the menace of criminality 
that had developed during the second half of 2009 was 
directed in the main against NGO reps, with kidnappings and 
attacks against convoys of humanitarian vehicles creating a 
climate of fear. 
¶3.  (SBU)  The SRSG noted that a consequence of these 
attacks, NGO activities -- and thus attacks themselves -- 
were down in December, even though there were substantially 
more NGO reps in Chad now than one year ago.  Angelo also 
speculated that an increase in patrols on the part of the ANT 
had contributed to the recent decrease in criminal activity 
directed at NGOs. 
¶4.  (SBU)  Angelo reported that MINURCAT still suffered from 
incomplete troop deployments, but he predicted that 1,000 
additional troops would arrive in January from various 
countries who had pledged assistance.  The  SRSG said that 
the abilities of the DIS continued to improve, but that the 
force needed considerably more training and assistance with 
coordination with other law enforcement entities if it were 
to prove successful. 
¶5.  (SBU)  Angelo reviewed current MINURCAT activities in the 
civil sector, including training programs for prefects and 
sub-prefects who would take up roles of justices of the 
peace.  He described MINURCAT,s efforts in the potable water 
field, indicating that MINURCAT had located what appeared to 
be a sizable acquifer in  the Abeche region, which might 
provide a water system for that city.  MINURCAT,s next 
priority with respect to water would be Iriba. 
¶6.  (SBU)  Angelo  advised the gathering that the range of 
possible recommendations he might make to the UNSC with 
respect to the one-year review of the PKO, stressing that 
"outcomes for MINURCAT,s projected second year went from A 
to Z."  Coordination was under way among the P-5, he 
stressed, all of whom were proceeding on the notion that 
MINURCAT had been stood up with the expectation of a two-year 
deployment. 
¶7.  (SBU)  Minimize considered.
