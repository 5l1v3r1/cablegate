(SBU)  The Government of Turkey fully supports extension of 
the Incirlik Cargo Hub agreement and is working through its 
internal bureaucratic processes in order to issue a Council 
of Ministers decree as soon as possible.  The Foreign 
Minister's request for the decree to be issued was delivered 
to the Prime Minister's office on December 16, one day after 
receiving the Government of Iraq's note supporting the USG 
request.  On December 19, DCM contacted MFA Deputy 
Undersecretary Haider Berk and Ambassador Ali Yakital, Senior 
Diplomatic Adviser to the Prime Minister, to underscore the 
urgency of this issue and to explain that prudent logistics 
planning would require re-positioning of aircraft well in 
advance of the December 31 expiry of the existing agreement. 
Both men acknowledged the high priority of the agreement and 
expressed confidence that the decree to extend the validity 
of the agreement would be issued before it would be necessary 
to re-position aircraft.  They also pledged to intervene 
again to ensure passage of the decree if it is not issued 
before December 22.
