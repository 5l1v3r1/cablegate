¶1.       Poloff delivered Ref A and B to Alan Hattle, Director of 
Bilateral Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on January 
¶19.  Ambassador underscored the message to Prime Minister Nahas 
Angula on January 25, following press reports that Namibia planned 
to donate USD one million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti.  In 
the meeting, Angula clarified that the assistance would consist of 
in-kind goods and not financial donations.  He said the gift would 
be made in coordination with the Cuban government, citing Cuba's 
geographic proximity to Haiti, its apparent awareness of the needs 
in Haiti, and its "strong medical teams."  (Note: Namibia and Cuba 
have strong diplomatic ties that predate Namibia's independence. 
End note.)  Angula stated that Namibia's ambassador to Cuba was 
working on delivery details with the Cuban government and the UN 
office in Havana. 
 
 
 
¶2.       Ambassador encouraged the GRN to register its pledge on 
the OCHA website and emphasized the information in Ref B and C. 
Angula said Namibian organizations and citizens were also making 
private donations through the Namibian chapter of the International 
Red Cross, but he expressed concern that some Namibians would give 
to less reputable organizations.  Ambassador suggested that 
international organizations that are well-known and respected 
should be utilized. 
 
 
 
¶3.       The Prime Minister also asked about the process for the 
adoption of orphans, opining that some children could be taken 
advantaged of and trafficked.  Ambassador responded that the United 
States was expediting the paperwork for those children already in 
the adoption pipeline and would ensure due diligence prior to the 
approval of other adoptions.
