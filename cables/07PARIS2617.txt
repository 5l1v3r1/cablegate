¶1. (U) On June 14, the French Biomolecular Committee (the competent 
authority for reviewing biotech products) stated that in much as 
there was no new adverse information calling into question the 
environmental assessment of MON 810, the French Ministers of Ecology 
and Agriculture found that no moratorium will be imposed on the 
cultivation and harvest of MON 810 corn this year. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) French anti-biotech organizations had called for a 
moratorium on all the MON 810 corn planted this year in France on 
some 25,000 hectares.  We understand that the Prime Minister's 
office intervened to mediate between the Ministries of Agriculture 
and Ecology.  It is interesting to note that this outcome stands in 
opposition to German, Austrian and Hungarian decisions to apply 
moratoriums on MON 810.
