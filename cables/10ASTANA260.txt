¶1.  Following his meeting with State Secretary-Foreign Minister 
Kanat Saudabayev, Special Representative for Afghanistan and 
Pakistan Ambassador Richard Holbrooke met briefly with the media. 
Transcript follows. 
 
¶2.  BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 
 
Ambassador Holbrooke:  We've just completed some excellent meetings 
here with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan as 
part of a trip to the Central Asian republics.  We talked to all of 
the countries that have a concern in the situation in Afghanistan 
and Pakistan.  That's why we're here today.  Kazakhstan is a very 
important country in its own right in the region and it's also 
directly affected by events in Afghanistan, so it's natural that I 
would come here today to consult with the Kazakhstani government. 
 
"Washington Times":  Sir, did you talk about the question of Russia 
setting up defense agreements with Abkhazia? 
 
Ambassador Holbrooke:  No. 
 
"Washington Times":  May I broach that subject now? 
 
Ambassador Holbrooke:  The subject of Abkhazia and Georgia never 
came up.  I'm not here to talk about those issues.  I'm here to talk 
about Afghanistan.  I'm going from here to Georgia to review the 
Georgian battalion which is going to Afghanistan, but once again my 
trip has nothing to do with Georgian-Russian relations, it's about 
Georgia's extraordinarily important contribution to the 
international effort in Afghanistan. 
 
"Reuters":  Is the United States planning to open a military base in 
Uzbekistan to support its operations in Afghanistan? 
 
Ambassador Holbrooke:  Uzbekistan does provide us valuable 
opportunities to transit material to Afghanistan, and that's 
important.  But a military base?  No.  We have an important transit 
center in Kyrgyzstan - the Manas Transit Center - where many of the 
troops coming in and out of Afghanistan stop, and that's a very 
valuable part of our effort.  We're very grateful to Kyrgyzstan for 
its support in that regard. 
 
"Washington Times":  Sir, you mentioned several times the importance 
of Kazakhstan in the region.  Can you emphasize a little on that, 
and why? 
 
Ambassador Holbrooke:  First of all, Kazakhstan is the largest, 
wealthiest, and most successful country in the region.  It has 
directed a multi-directional foreign policy with great skill, under 
the leadership of President Nazarbayev.  It took decisive and 
historic actions 18 years ago, in regard to nuclear weapons for 
which the world should be eternally grateful.  Kazakhstan, because 
of its location and its history, is poised between several of the 
greatest powers in the world and has managed to work well with all 
of them.  Anyone who knows this region should admire the foreign 
policy conducted by President Nazarbayev. 
 
Secondly, the resources available to Kazakhstan, which are only 
beginning to be tapped, are going to be of immense importance to the 
world and give Kazakhstan an opportunity to emerge as a developed 
nation within a few years, if they manage their resources right. 
Many countries that have had natural resources, particularly oil, 
have been affected by what is called the "oil curse."  The Kazakh 
government is very aware of this and has spent a great deal of time 
studying it and working on ways to prevent it from happening.  I, 
myself, have been involved in some of those efforts when I was a 
private citizen.  I've been here many times.  I think this is my 
seventh trip here -- sixth or seventh trip -- and not just to 
Astana; some were to Almaty. 
 
Thank you very much.
