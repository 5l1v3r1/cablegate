SUMMARY 
 
-------- 
 
 
 
¶1.  The crisis in Haiti did not make the front pages on January 21, 
with Argentine dailies focusing instead on domestic political 
disputes.  However, Haiti continued to dominate the international 
sections, with headlines dramatizing the U.S. military deployment. 
While reporting generally did not criticize the U.S. explicitly, 
many articles depicted U.S. relief efforts in a negative light 
through their choice of words and quoted comments from the local 
population.  In addition, several opinion articles accused the U.S. 
of a massive militarization and failure in its humanitarian goals. 
End summary. 
 
 
 
DRAMATIZING THE US MILITARY DEPLOYMENT 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  Although Haiti was not front page news on January 20, it 
continued to dominate the international sections of Argentine 
dailies, with headlines such as top circulation Clarin's "Airport 
filled with marines and machine guns" and La Prensa's "U.S. troops 
occupy presidential palace in Haiti" dramatizing the U.S. military 
deployment.  English daily The Buenos Aires Herald picked up a 
Reuters newswire with the headline "GIs land at presidential 
palace," detailing how U.S. troops have secured Haiti's General 
Hospital, adding that the U.S. was handing out supplies as part of 
the international relief operations. 
 
 
 
¶3.  Three newspapers (La Nacion, Clarin and Critica) and one radio 
station (Radio Nacional) have reporters on the ground.  Although 
their correspondents were not explicitly critical of the U.S., 
their articles used terms such as "invasion,"  "military bastion," 
and "marines armed to the teeth" to describe U.S. troop 
deployments.  Furthermore, several report concerns of the Haitian 
population about the deployments, with La Nacion claiming that, 
"Many Haitians doubt the US real intentions.  Many believe it is a 
veiled occupation."  La Nacion also picked up a news wire from DPA 
German news agency describing a history of U.S. intervention in 
Haiti.  (Note:  CDA Kelly conducted interviews with both La Nacion 
and Clarin on January 20 to counter misperceptions about the U.S. 
troop deployments.  End note.)

¶4. Surprisingly, pro-government paper "Pagina 12" was quite minimal 
in its negative reporting, citing concerns by French officials that 
the U.S. was monopolizing relief actions. "Pagina 12" also reported 
that the U.S. was throwing food from airplanes, against U.N. 
recommendations.

OPINION PIECES MORE CRITICAL 
 
----------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5. Several opinion pieces adopted a more critical position, 
accusing the U.S. of failing in its humanitarian goal. Centrist 
Critica said U.S. troops refused to perform security and police 
operations in Haiti, accusing the U.S. of monopolizing humanitarian 
aid and quoting complaints from other governments.

¶6. Daily Buenos Aires Economico (pro-government) blasted U.S. 
efforts and accused the U.S. of occupying Haiti. In an opinion 
piece entitled "The humanitarian invasion," it reported a "massive 
militarization" of the island, claiming the "military component" of 
the mission is prevailing over the actions of the State Department 
and USAID and hindering civil actions.  The article also criticized 
the use of the 82nd Airborne Division, which it claimed is 
specialized in countering riots.  It adds that "the experience of 
U.S. humanitarian aid cannot lead to positive prospects" in Haiti.
