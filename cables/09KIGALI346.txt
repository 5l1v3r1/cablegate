 (SBU)  Ministry of Foreign Affairs International 
Organizations Chief Ben Rutsinga told us June 5 that Rwanda 
would support the candidacy of Lucretia Myers for the 
International Civil Service Commission.  Although careful to 
note that decisions on UN elections are formally made by the 
cabinet, Rutsinga said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is 
quite often delegated the authority to make such decisions, 
and would very likely do so in this case.  "You can take our 
support as confirmed," he said.
