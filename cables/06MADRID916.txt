SUBJECT: SPANISH JUDGE INDICTS 29 FOR MARCH 11 ATTACKS 
 
 
¶1. (U) On April 11, National Court Judge Juan del Olmo 
released a 1460-page indictment of 29 people for their 
involvement in the March 11,2004 Madrid train bombings that 
killed 191 people.  Press reports say that after two years of 
investigation, the judge found that the local terrorist cell 
consulted with the operators of a terrorist website called 
Global Islamic Media, which had posted a document 
recommending attacks in Spain before the election in order to 
force Spain's withdrawal from Iraq.  He determined that the 
terror attacks were inspired by, but not executed by, Osama 
Bin Laden's network.  He also rejected any links between the 
Basque terrorist group ETA and the March 11 attacks.
