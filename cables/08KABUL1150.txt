¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Independent Directorate of Local 
Governance (IDLG) on May 4 released its Five-Year Strategic 
Work Plan, a roadmap for provincial, district, and municipal 
governance.  The plan focuses on four core functions: policy 
development, institutional development, participatory 
governance, and support.  It is a reasonably well written and 
thoughtful document, and should play an important role in 
coordinating the previously scattershot approach to local 
governance.  The plan,s ambitious scope, however, will test 
the limited capacity of the IDLG.  Its estimated cost of $296 
million over five years will have to be borne by the 
international community.  The June Paris Support Conference 
is an opportune time to focus donors, attention on IDLG,s 
efforts. 
 
Strategic Plan Receives Presidential and UN Support 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
¶2. (SBU) At a May 4 ceremony at the Palace, the Independent 
Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG) unveiled its Five-Year 
Strategic Work Plan before assembled diplomats and GIRoA 
officials.  Confirming his support for the directorate he 
created by decree in August (Ref. A), President Karzai 
described the plan as "well conceived, concise, and 
understandable."  Karzai underscored the importance of a 
comprehensive plan to increase GIRoA outreach to the people, 
while simplifying government procedures and reducing 
corruption.  UN SRSG, Kai Eide, credited IDLG for a solid 
plan, and called upon the international community to support 
its quick implementation.  The Strategic Work Plan, drafted 
with substantial support from the Asia Foundation, outlines 
four "core functions" including policy development, 
institutional development, broader governance, and other 
support functions. 
 
The Four Core Functions 
----------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) The Work Plan describes IDLG,s policy function as 
the "development of a policy framework, rules and regulations 
for sub-national governance."  IDLG will execute that 
function through "an inter-ministerial policy development 
process."  President Karzai will establish the process by 
decree and entrust its leadership to one of his vice 
presidents.  The plan specifies a timetable for policy 
development culminating in the drafting of local governance 
laws.  The inter-ministerial policy development process is 
expected to cost approximately $4 million and will 
undoubtedly be controversial. 
 
¶4. (SBU) IDLG lists the strengthening of sub-national 
governance institutions as its second core function. 
According to the Work Plan, this task entails the design and 
implementation of Public Administration Reform (PAR); the 
development of a capacity-building strategy; the upgrading of 
physical infrastructure for local institutions; support to 
municipalities; tackling corruption; and mapping political 
and administrative boundaries.  IDLG estimates this function 
will cost $126 million over five years, the bulk of which 
goes to upgrading infrastructure and support for the 
country,s 147 municipalities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) IDLG,s third core function is its broader 
governance responsibilities, namely "the creation and 
provision of support for the participation of stakeholders 
and citizens in sub-national governance processes."  This 
encompasses the directorate,s role in coordinating local 
development activities, particularly in leading the 
implementation of provincial development plans (PDPs) and 
counter-narcotics policy.  (Note: In conjunction with ANDS, 
IDLG led the successful March 2008 PDP Consultations.) 
Additionally, IDLG will focus on bridging the gap between the 
people and the government by engaging with representative 
bodies.  The Afghan Social Outreach Program (Ref. B) is part 
of this effort to develop outreach mechanisms to connect 
government to often-alienated local populations. 
 
¶6. (SBU) IDLG's final function is its role as a facilitator

in the implementation of national policies and programs at 
the sub-national level.  This includes supporting, and 
coordinating the implementation of national initiatives like: 
 elections, civil registry, census, land administration, 
disaster preparedness and response, and the promotion of 
culture.  IDLG will define the appropriate role of 
sub-national institutions in these sectors, as well as 
develop a detailed program of activities to support each of 
these national activities. 
 
IDLG Receives Wide Support 
-------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) Although only eight months old, ILDG has already had 
a considerable impact on local governance.  The Work Plan is 
a logical next step, an overarching strategy to replace the 
inchoate, uncoordinated and often conflicting approaches to 
governance taken by the international community and the GIROA 
over the last five years.  Strikingly, the Work Plan's 
ambition extends beyond core local governance elements to 
include economic development and counter-narcotics.  This 
intrusion into other line ministries, territories will 
attract scrutiny from powerful ministers and the National 
Assembly and test IDLG's capacity to deliver.
