REF: A. A) BAGHDAD 3965

¶1. In response to ref A, Department has reviewed its 
files and finds that it possesses no credible information 
of gross violations of human rights as of this time by the 
member of the Iraqi Security Forces listed in paragraph 2 
below. 
If at any time, the Embassy becomes aware of any 
information regarding incidents which could be credibly 
deemed to 
be a gross violation of human rights by the individual, the 
Embassy should so inform the Department.

¶3. In response to ref B, further vetting is required for the

planned travel 
date, the Department believes that this candidate will have 
to 
postpone travel to the United States.  If this candidate were 
to be 
proposed for training in the future, further background 
information 
and more lead time would be necessary to complete vetting.
