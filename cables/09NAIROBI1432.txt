¶2. (SBU) Mohamed Yusuf Ninille, a reporter for Radio Holy 
Koran, was killed by stray bullets on July 4 near Mogadishu's 
Bakara Market as government and Islamic extremist forces 
battled nearby.  Yusuf was the sixth Somali journalist killed 
this year.  Holy Koran Director Mohamed Abdulwahab told us 
Yusuf was crossing a street on his way to the radio's studios 
when he was hit.  He succumbed to his injuries at Medina 
Hospital after lying in the street for nearly three hours as 
fighting raged nearby.  Yusuf had been working for Radio Holy 
Koran for about two years, and had been a journalist for over 
a decade.  He left a wife and two children. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Multiple journalist advocacy groups, including the 
Committee for the Protection of Journalists, International 
Freedom of Expression Exchange, and National Union of Somali 
Journalists issued statements condemning Ninille's death and 
lamenting the plight of Somalia's journalists.  Post will 
convey a letter of condolence to the widow.
