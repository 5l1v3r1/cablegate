In Today's Papers 
 
Kurdish Party Calls for PKK Ceasefire 
All papers:  Turkey's main Kurdish party, the Democratic Turkey 
Party (DTP,) called on the outlawed PKK to unilaterally lay down 
their arms.  DTP leader Ahmet Turk said the party grassroots 
demanded a ceasefire, adding he expected a positive response from 
the PKK/Kongra-Gel.  Papers comment that while earlier ceasefire 
calls by the DTP were directed at both the Turkish army and the PKK, 
this one was meant only for the PKK.  Renowned Kurdish politician 
Abdulmelik Firat, head of HAKPAR party, claimed that the DTP had 
been acting under the instructions of the PKK leadership, drawing 
speculation that the PKK was in trouble and was seeking a ceasefire. 
 Another Kurdish politician, Serafettin Elci, said a ceasefire would 
not end the fighting as long as there are armed PKK militants in the 
mountains. 
 
Turkey Sends Letter to EU 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Zaman and others report Ankara 
said in a letter seen as a response to the EU progress report on 
Turkey that Greek Cypriots would not be allowed into Turkish ports 
and airports unless the isolation of Turkish Cyprus is brought to an 
end.  The letter also says Turkey was the second country to 
recognize the Armenian state; that bilateral trade between the two 
countries amounts to USD 120 million; and there are some 40,000 
Armenian nationals working in Turkey, adding that Armenia had not 
responded to Turkish proposals to establish a joint commission of 
historians to research genocide claims.  It notes the rise in the 
PKK terrorism in southeast Turkey aimed at undermining EU 
harmonization reforms, and urges the EU to call on the PKK to lay 
down arms.  It said Turkey was looking for ways to reopen the Halki 
Seminary within the framework of the Turkish Constitution.  The 
letter said controversial articles of the new anti-terror law, 
including Article 301, did not violate free speech, adding that 
there were similar provisions in European countries.  Meanwhile, 
visiting British Minister of State for Europe Geoff Hoon said in 
Istanbul that the EU must cooperate with Turkey against the PKK 
terrorist organization. 
 
Anniversary of September 12 Military Takeover in Turkey 
Turkish papers carry news and opinion pieces strongly critical of 
the interruption of democracy in Turkey after the takeover by a 
military junta in September 12, 1980 on the anniversary of the coup 
today.  Analysts said September 12 initiated a tradition of 
"illegality" in Turkey, legitimizing the mandate and implementations 
of the junta leaders.  Several intellectuals reportedly called for 
the generals who perpetrated the takeover to be tried.  Academics 
said coup leaders stripped their autonomy because they saw 
universities as enemies.  Cumhuriyet says September 12 imprisoned 
and tortured thousands of workers, students, intellectuals, and 
artists, bringing the fledgling Turkish democracy to a standstill. 
 
 
US Donates Scholarship Funds to Commemorate 9/11 
Sabah, Milliyet, Aksam, Bugun, Vatan and others:   Today's papers 
cover the donation ceremony held yesterday in the garden of the US 
Embassy in Ankara.  In commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the 
September 11 terrorist attacks on the US, the US mission donated 
$10,000 to the Association for Aid and Solidarity with the Families 
of Martyrs from the Security Services (EMSAD).  US Ambassador Ross 
Wilson said at the ceremony that "Turkey and the US would not bow 
before the terrorists and will continue to fight against the PKK 
together."  Papers also reported that US Principal Officer in Adana 
Eric Green visited the Association for Solidarity with families of 
martyrs in Adana.  Green was welcomed by a veteran who had lost his 
legs in operations in Northern Iraq in 1997.  NTV and others report 
that the veteran told Green that "if the US had acted in time 
against the PKK, he would have been able to stand up and greet the 
Consul."

Zawahiri Declares UNIFIL the Enemy of Islam 
Sabah, Radikal and others reported that the second-in-command of 
Al-Qaeda Ayman-Al-Zawahiri, in a web site, threatened the US and 
Israel, declared the UNIFIL the enemy of Islam and added that 
whoever joins the UN forces will be damned.  Radikal reports that 
Zawahiri issued a call to the Iraqi Kurds as well to cease relations 
with the US and Israel. 
 
Bryza on Lebanon, the PKK 
Zaman reports Deputy Assistant Secretary Matt Bryza told a panel 
meeting in Istanbul that if Turkey wants to play a leadership role 
in the Middle East, it should participate in the international force 
for Lebanon.  DAS Bryza also gave the message that the appointment 
of US Special Envoy for Countering the PKK, Joseph Ralston, 
indicated US determination to end the PKK threat against Turkey. 
 
Editorial Commentary on the 9/11 Anniversary 
Mustafa Balbay comments in the nationalist-leftist Cumhuriyet: 
"Looking back on the twin towers attack after five years, it seems 
that it served the American neo-cons' interests.  With the 
occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq, the US today seems to be holding 
the key to the door to the Middle East and Central Asia, and this is 
a privilege it would not like to give up.  There are only two 
options offered by the US to the entire world in the aftermath of 
9/11 events: either terrorism or war; either imperialism or 
religious radicalism; either nuclear weapons or suicide bombers." 
 
Cuneyt Ulsever observes in the mass appeal Hurriyet: "The 21st 
century began on September 11, 2001, as did World War III.  On the 
very same day Turkey became a de facto part of this war.  The 
developments after the 9/11 events have redefined the world.  There 
are a lot of reasons behind this.  One of them is the consumption of 
oil in the US and the huge deficit between local production and 
consumption."
