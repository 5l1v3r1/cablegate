SUBJECT: TRANSLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 151772 
 
Per Reftel, post's preference is for translation of the Human 
Rights Report (HRR) for Tunisia to be done by the 
Department's Office of Language Services (LS).  Per paragraph 
three of reftel, LS envisions translating all Arabic-language 
HRRs, and post has no objection.  If LS has any terminology 
questions, they can contact Deputy Pol/Econ Chief Susannah 
Cooper at CooperSE@state.gov.  Please note that Tunisia is a 
bilingual country, and post requires translations of the HHR 
in both Arabic and French.  For French terminology questions, 
please contact Trina Saha at SahaTD@state.gov.
