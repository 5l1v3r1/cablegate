Â¶1.  (SBU)  We presented reftel demarche on November 4 to 
Turkish MFA International Political Organizations Head Murat 
Ates, who noted that Turkey had supported Israel's inclusion 
in the Western Europe and Others Group in New York in 2000, 
as well as during the 2004 membership renewal.  Ates wanted 
to check with colleagues in the MFA regarding Turkey's 
official position on including Israel in the World 
Intellectual Property Organization, the International Labor 
Organization's Industrial Market Economy Countries group, the 
UN Environmental Program, UN-HABITAT and the Commission on 
Narcotic Drugs.  Ates promised to advise us regarding the 
MFA's position on this issue.
