1.(SBU) SUMMARY - This afternoon General Council Chair (GC) Matus 
held an informal consultation with a small group of countries, not 
including Israel or the Arab States, on the PA's request for WTO 
observer status.  The purpose was to begin to resume the process 
that he had started prior to the October 20 General Council meeting 
as part of the preparation for the November 17 GC meeting.  As in 
past discussions, most delegations expressed support for the PA's 
request but were measured in their approach.  However, the EC 
Ambassador said that if a consensus could not be reached on the 
issue, his instructions were to place this issue on the agenda for 
the November GC meeting.  Charge laid down a strong marker that this 
course of action would not only lead to a politically charged debate 
ending in deadlock but would also be likely to kill any chance to 
secure observer status for the PA at the Ministerial Conference 
(MC).  Other reps came in at this point to urge a careful approach 
but the EC rep told Charge he is under instructions from Brussels so 
any change in approach will have to come from there.  End Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) In addition to U.S. and EC reps, the meeting was attended 
by Brazil, Canada, China, and Norway.  Matus opened the discussion 
with very little by way of introduction other than to note that the 
requisites for observer status are that the entity must be 
considered a customs territory and that it must have an authority 
governing it.  Later he added that the applicant must indicate 
intent to accede to the WTO within 5 years.  Matus noted in response 
to a question on process that it is normal that a request such as 
this is not place on a GC agenda until there is a consensus to act 
on it. However, this is not a normal situation and he is unsure how 
to approach it. He also mentioned that the PA was in the process of 
preparing a revised application, responding to issues that had been 
raised. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The EC Ambassador said he appreciated the Chair's effort to 
find a consensus, though it appeared that this was not easy.  He 
said that the EC fully supports the request and that if no consensus 
was found they would insist on putting this issue on the November GC 
agenda. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Charge noted that the PA was a friend and partner but that 
we continued to have questions about whether they meet the criteria 
to become an observer and are unlikely to be in a position to 
deliver a positive response before the November GC meeting.  He 
noted, however, that we would support their observership at the MC 
if they requested it.  Responding to the EC's statement, he noted 
that if they proceeded as planned it was clear there would be an 
acrimonious debate in the GC and no conclusion.  He noted that, 
while it cannot be assured at this point that observership at the MC 
would be agreed, the EC's approach would kill any chance of it. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Indian Ambassador noted the sensitivity of the issue 
and supported the Chair's careful approach.  India will do its best 
to help develop a consensus.  He urged a cautious approach. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Canadian DCM said that Canada is still examining the 
issue but the devil is in the details. They are waiting for legal 
analysis from Ottawa. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Chinese DCM expressed support for the PA and noted that 
it was possible to differentiate between eligibility for observer 
status and eligibility for accession. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The Norwegian rep expressed support for the request but 
agreed on the need to avoid an acrimonious debate in the GC.  If 
some were not ready on GC observer status, we should aim to secure 
MC observer status. 
 
¶9. (SBU) The Brazilian rep thought that the flexibility should be 
found to agree to the PA's request.

¶10. (SBU) Matus's next step will be to consult individually with 
Israel and other key players. 
 
¶11. (SBU) We strongly recommend that Washington agencies reach out 
to the EC and appropriate Member States as soon as possible.
