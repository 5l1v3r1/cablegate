SUBJECT: GOI PREPARES NEW CHECKPOINT IN NORTHERN WEST BANK 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 1488 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The GOI has installed, but not yet 
manned, a new checkpoint northwest of Nablus, a few 
kilometers south of the Shavei Shomron checkpoint on Route 
¶60.  The new checkpoint, if operational, would add a 
restriction on the primary north-south highway within the 
West Bank that was eased when the Shavei Shomeron checkpoint 
was opened (reftel).  It would also introduce an additional 
obstacle for travelers coming out of Nablus via Beit Iba on 
their way west and south.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On December 4, Congenoffs visited a site on Route 
60, northwest of Nablus (between the Shavei Shomeron 
checkpoint and Route 57), where Israeli security forces have 
installed new checkpoint infrastructure.  The new 
installation is only a few kilometers south of the Shavei 
Shomeron checkpoint, just beyond the road leading to Nablus 
via Beit Iba.  The checkpoint infrastructure appears to be 
complete.  At the site Congenoffs observed two large road 
gates -- spaced about 75 yards apart -- with two armored 
guard shacks facing each other on both sides of the road 
between the gates.  The gates were in an open position. 
There are no additional building materials or indicators to 
suggest the GOI is constructing additional infrastructure 
around the site.  Local Palestinians told Congenoffs the 
checkpoint installation began on December 2. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  As of December 4, nearby Shavei Shomeron and Beit 
Iba checkpoints were functioning normally.  (Shavei Shomeron 
is regularly open to freely flowing traffic twelve hours a 
day.  Beit Iba remains one of the two major checkpoints 
limiting pedestrian and vehicle access in and out of Nablus.) 
 The new checkpoint, if manned during daylight hours without 
changes to other area obstacles, would add a restriction on 
north-south travel on Route 60 previously eased by Shavei 
Shomeron,s opening.   It would control traffic flowing from 
Jenin to Tulkarm (including the Sha,ar Ephraim crossing) and 
Ramallah.  The new site would also serve as a second barrier 
(after Beit Iba) for Palestinians traveling from Nablus to 
Tulkarm and Ramallah.

December 4 visit, can be found on ConGen Jerusalem's
