North Korean Missiles 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. China had noted reports that North Korea had recently tested 
short-range missiles, said spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu at the October 13 
regularly scheduled MFA press conference.  The test would not affect 
the improving situation on the Korean Peninsula, asserted Ma.  China 
hoped relevant parties would jointly promote peace and stability and 
the denuclearization of Korean Peninsula. 
 
Nobel Peace Prize 
----------------- 
 
¶3. China had taken note that President Obama had been awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize.  In particular, China noted that the award was 
given for his role in promoting diplomacy and people-to-people 
exchanges.  China congratulated President Obama on the award, said 
the spokesperson. 
 
 
A/S Campbell Visit to China 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell would visit Beijing 
from October 12-14.  During his visit, he would meet with Vice 
Foreign Ministers He Yafei and Wu Dawei, as well as officials from 
the Ministries of Education and Commerce.  During his meetings, he 
would discuss issues of bilateral, international and regional 
importance, including the upcoming visit of President Obama to 
China. 
 
British Citizen Death Penalty Case 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. A British citizen currently facing the death penalty in China had 
been convicted of drug trafficking in 2008 and was now having his 
case reviewed by the Supreme People's Court, said Ma.  The British 
citizen had been treated in line with relevant laws.  During his 
trial, the defendant had been given an opportunity to defend himself 
and had been provided with an interpreter.  Regarding claims that 
the British citizen was mentally unstable, Ma said that the British 
Embassy had proposed a psychological examination but "did not offer 
proof."  The defendant himself claimed that neither he nor his 
family had a history of mental illness, said Ma. 
 
China-India Border 
------------------ 
 
¶6. The China-India border had not been officially demarcated and 
China and India had different positions on the issue, noted the 
spokesperson.  China was dissatisfied that despite the grave 
concerns of China, Indian leaders had recently visited a disputed 
area.  To ensure the stable development of bilateral relations, 
China hoped India would take seriously Chinese concerns and not 
provoke an incident. 
 
SCO Meetings 
----------- 
 
¶7. The upcoming meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization 
(SCO) would be a major multilateral meeting since the start of the 
financial crisis, said Ma.  The meeting would build on the 
accomplishments of the previous meeting at Yekaterinburg and the 
spokesman was "sure it would be a success."  Over the course of the 
SCO meetings, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao would meet with Russian 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.  During his October 13-15 visit to 
China, Putin would sign deals on technological and economic 
cooperation and attend events related to the 60th anniversary of 
bilateral relations.  Wen would also meet with Iranian Vice 
President Reza Rahimi October 14.  Wen and Chinese President Hu 
Jintao would meet with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani 
during his visit from October 12-15 to exchange views on bilateral 
and other issues.
