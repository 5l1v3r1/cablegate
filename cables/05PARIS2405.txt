(U) Poloff delivered reftel points to Beatrice le Fraper du 
Hellen, DAS-equivalent for Human Rights in the MFA's bureau 
of United Nations and International Organizations on April 4. 
 Fraper du Hellen noted that demarches urging support for the 
Cuba resolution had been delivered to Gabon, Mauritania, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, and Burkina Faso; while all of 
the interlocutors had listened, none had provided any 
substantive response.  Fraper du Hellen promised to notify us 
of any further feedback.
