SUBJECT: CYPRUS FOLLOWING EU ON CONDEMNING ARREST AND 
ARRAIGNMENT OF SYRIAN DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 11025 
 
 ¶1.  Per reftel, PolOff on February 11 demarched MFA Middle 
East Desk Officer Dionysis Dionysiou to seek RoC condemnation 
of the arrest and arraignment of Syrian democracy activists, 
including Riad Seif.  Dionysiou replied that the GoC intended 
to follow EU consensus on the matter, not opposing the 
issuance of a new EU Presidency public statement denouncing 
the activists' detention, but not explicitly supporting it, 
either.  Dionysiou believed it risky for one government to 
denounce, without full knowledge of the facts, another 
government's decision to detain its citizens. 
 
¶2. COMMENT:  Cypriot efforts to convince Syria to terminate 
ferry links between Latakia and the "Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus" are continuing, and represent one of the 
MFA's highest short-term priorities.  As such, we don't 
expect the RoC to issue strong statements against Damascus 
anytime soon.
