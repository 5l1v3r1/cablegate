¶1. (SBU) Polchief delivered reftel demarches October 21 to 
Joumane Khaddage, Counselor in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  Khaddage will be traveling to New York October 26 
to participate in the General Assembly with the Lebanese 
delegation, and promised to convey our points to appropriate 
officials in the Ministry and on the delegation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Per ref B instructions, Polchief and Australian 
diplomat Tony Barlow presented the joint demarche talking 
points on the rights of indigenous peoples.  (There is no New 
Zealand diplomatic representation in Beirut, but Polchief and 
Barlow made it clear that the demarche represented the views 
of all three governments.)  In response to the demarche, 
Khaddage expressed her view that the issue is likely not of 
vital importance to Lebanon.  Polchief asked Khaddage to 
consider not only the substance of USG, Australia and New 
Zealand objections the UN Draft Text, but also the fact that 
the text had been passed in the Human Rights Council in a 
divisive manner without achieving consensus.  Khaddage 
promised to bring this objection to the attention of the 
Lebanese delegation in New York.
