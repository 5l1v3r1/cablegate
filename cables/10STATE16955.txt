¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds that 
it possesses no credible information of gross violations of 
human rights at this time by the members of the Iraqi 
Operations Coordination Group listed below.  Department 
strongly suggests that visa applications for these 
individuals be filed with as much lead time as possible to 
allow for additional processing procedures that may be 
required.  Note that if, at any time, the Embassy becomes 
aware of any information regarding incidents which could be 
deemed to be credible information of a gross violation of 
human rights by these individuals, the Embassy should so 
inform the Department.
