Gaza Turmoil: 
------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "But the Hamas takeover in Gaza has a 
positive aspect for Olmert: there is no chance Bush will present a 
new initiative with the Palestinians during their meeting in 10 
days." 
 
Military correspondent Roni Shaked wrote in the mass-circulation, 
popular Yediot Aharonot: "It is clear that the new Hamas reality in 
Gaza has passed the point of no return.  There is no one to stop 
them.  The United States, and Israel as well, would be deluded to 
think that Abu Mazen and his regime can still be saved." 
 
Columnist Yael Paz-Melamed wrote in the popular, pluralist Maariv: 
"Perhaps soon, we will manage to leave Gaza finally and truly.  We 
will leave this dubious pleasure to the countries of European Union 
and to the US, and we will erect a real barrier, physical and 
mental, between us and all the factions and the camps and the 
families and the disputes and the blood feuds, because of which and 
out of which the civil war there broke out.  Yet there is still one 
small problem: the world is not all that ready to take the Gaza 
Strip on itself."

Â¶I. "Olmert's Problem" 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (06/14): "Olmert's problem is that he does not 
have a lot of time to celebrate [Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak's 
victory]. The waiting periods -- until the release of the interim 
Winograd report, to the Labor primary, to the election of the 
president, and the appointment of the new ministers -- are coming to 
an end.  At its completion the prime minister will have to do what 
he does not like to do: present the public with a new and convincing 
agenda that would explain where the country is now heading.  His 
options are not great.  The Syrian track is blocked.  The Gaza Strip 
has turned into Hamastan.  It is hard to present Mahmoud Abbas as a 
convincing partner in a diplomatic solution, following the blow he 
received in the Strip.  The national mood will only grow darker in 
view of the security threats, in the north, the south and the east 
-- in Iran.  But the Hamas takeover in Gaza has a positive aspect 
for Olmert: there is no chance Bush will present a new initiative 
with the Palestinians during their meeting in 10 days.  Olmert said 
this week that he is leaning toward a policy of containment in the 
Gaza Strip.  If the West is concerned over the implications of the 
Hamas takeover, then they are welcome to deal with it with an 
international force." 
 
II. "Two States for Two People" 
 
Military correspondent Roni Shaked wrote in the popular, 
mass-circulation Yediot Aharonot (06/14): "Fatah in the Gaza Strip 
has collapsed, gone bankrupt.... Within the commotion, Hamastan is 
being established on the ruins of the Palestinian entity.... It is 
clear that the new Hamas reality in Gaza has passed the point of no 
return.  There is no one to stop them.  The United States, and 
Israel as well, would be deluded to think that Abu Mazen and his 
regime can still be saved.... Abu Mazen, detached from reality, 
lives in the past, ignores the present and has not planned for the 
future.... One of the strategic outcomes of Hamas's victory in Gaza 
is the creation of two Palestinian areas living separately, with a 
different reality and different leadership.  The Palestinians are 
seeing their nightmare emerge before their eyes -- separation 
between Gaza and the West Bank, two states for one people.  This 
situation is not good for Israel.  It can even be said that it is 
bad for us.... Israel did nothing to strengthen the moderate camp, 
Olmert's meetings with Abu Mazen were futile and debasing.  Israel 
did not have, and still lacks today, a long-term policy on Gaza. 
This vacuum was filled by Hamas.... The new outcome is a Hamas 
government in Gaza with which Israel will not be able to cooperate, 
but will also not be able to ignore its needs, for it will be forced 
to continue to look after the population, and fulfill its needs. 
Israel, even if it greatly wants to do so, cannot disengage from 
Gaza at this stage, but certainly does not want to return to there. 
A temporary solution might be an international intervention force 
that would be mainly Arab.  But the conundrum of the 
densely-populated strip of land in Israel's southwestern corner has 
become much more complicated and complex this week." 
 
III. "Their Gaza" 
 
Columnist Yael Paz-Melamed wrote in the popular, pluralist Maariv 
(6/14): "Two days ago, in a conversation that Ehud Olmert held with 
the Dutch foreign minister, our real process of disengagement from 
Gaza may have begun. In that conversation, Olmert raised an idea, 
which was more of a request, to have a multi-national force -- 
UNIFIL, in our language -- along the Philadelphi Road in Rafah.... 
Whereas until now we were unwilling even to consider having  a UN 
force in the Gaza Strip, now a far-reaching step is being mooted, 
even though it is played down by saying that this should be 
considered, and maybe, etc.... It is difficult to overstate the 
importance of this proposal, and how revolutionary it is.  For the 
first time, Israel realizes that all its tanks and helicopters and 
planes are irrelevant in the bloody civil war taking place at this 
time in the Gaza Strip.... Basically ... Israel came to the same 
realization that it came to, again very belatedly, in Lebanon. 
There's nothing for us to seek there.  Therefore, we have to 
disengage. Completely. Not leave behind any traces of responsibility 
or commitment.... Perhaps soon, we will manage to leave Gaza finally 
and truly.  We will leave this dubious pleasure to the countries of 
European Union and to the US, and we will erect a real barrier, 
physical and mental, between us and all the factions and the camps 
and the families and the disputes and the blood feuds, because of 
which and out of which the civil war there broke out.  Yet there is 
still one small problem: the world is not all that ready to take the 
Gaza Strip on itself."
