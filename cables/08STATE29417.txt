EMBASSY COLOMBO ON BLOCKAGE OF OVERFLIGHT PAYMENTS 
 
REF: A. A) COLOMBO 000281 
     ¶B. B) STATE 148605 
 
 ¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3.

SUMMARY/BACKGROUND 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U)  On March 19, 2008, Embassy Colombo requested 
approval to use proposed press guidance points (REFTEL A) if 
asked about Citibank's blockage of overflight funds paid by 
Sri Lanka Airlines to Iran using Bank Melli.  Washington 
requests that Post use the press guidance included below when 
discussing this issue. 
 
---------- 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶3.  (U)  Washington requests that Post use the following 
press guidance when discussing Citibank's blocking of 
overflight payments.  Post may also draw from information in 
REFTEL B, which includes a fact sheet on the E.O. 13382 
designation of Bank Melli (the fact sheet is also available 
at www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp644.htm): 
 
Question: Why did Citibank block a transaction by Sri Lankan 
Airlines to pay the government of Iran for routine overflight 
fees?  Why did Citibank seize/freeze/impound Sri Lankan 
Airlines' funds, rather than simply rejecting the transaction 
and returning the funds? 
 
Answer: We defer all Citibank specific questions to Citibank. 
 Generally speaking, however, U.S. banks are required to 
comply with U.S. sanctions against Bank Melli of Iran by 
blocking transactions such as this one.  On October 25, 2007, 
the U.S. designated Bank Melli under Executive Order 13382 
(REFTEL B), which is aimed at proliferators of weapons of 
mass destruction and their supporters.  Executive Order 13382 
requires U.S. persons, including financial institutions, to 
block all property of sanctioned parties like Bank Melli 
(http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ 
ofac/legal/eo/whwmdeo.pdf).  This means that a transaction 
destined for Bank Melli must be blocked, unless licensed by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of Treasury. 
 
 
In addition, UN Security Council Resolution 1803, which was 
adopted on March 3, 2008, also calls upon States to exercise 
vigilance over the activities of financial institutions in 
their territories with all banks domiciled in Iran, 
especially Bank Melli, Bank Saderat, and their branches and 
subsidiaries abroad, in order to avoid activities that might 
contribute to proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities. 
Bank Melli provides banking services to entities involved in 
Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, including 
entities listed by the U.N. for their involvement in those 
programs. 
 
Question: Was this action taken because of U.S. disapproval 
of Sri Lanka's economic ties with Iran? 
 
Answer: Any transaction initiating from any company in any 
country in the world would be similarly blocked if it were 
conducted through a U.S. bank.

REPORTING DEADLINE

¶5.  (U)  Should the Mission receive inquiries on this issue 
and need to use the above guidance, please report any results 
(media and Sri Lankan government reaction, etc.) by cable. 
Please slug replies for ISN, IO, T, TREASURY, SCA and NEA/IR. 
 Please include SIPDIS in all replies.
