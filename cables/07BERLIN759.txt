(SBU) Global Affairs officer passed ref demarche to Joerg 
Polster, desk officer in the German MFA's International 
Energy and Nuclear Energy Policy and Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Division, April 13.  Polster, who will 
attend the NSG Information Exchange Meeting (IEM) in Cape 
Town as a delegate, thanked us for the information.  He said 
he will convey it to the German delegation when it meets 
April 15 in advance of the IEM.  He noted that Germany, 
France, and the United Kingdom are preparing a joint 
presentation concerning Iran, but, since a different German 
office is working on it, he is unable to share details in 
advance of the IEM.
