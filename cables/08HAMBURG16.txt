¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  On June 19, the Higher Regional Court (OLG) 
in Celle convicted Iraqi Ibrahim Rashid in 22 cases of promoting 
membership in and support for the foreign terrorist 
organizations Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda in Iraq and sentenced him to 
a three year prison term.  The conviction was based on Rashid's 
distribution of statements by Osama Bin Laden, Ayman 
Al-Zawahiri, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, and Al-Muhadjer over the 
internet by playing real-time video and audio files, posting 
links to internet sites where these files were available, and 
pasting the texts of Al-Qaeda speeches in chat windows.  This 
decision sets precedent by determining that the promotion of 
activities in support of Al Qaeda on the internet is punishable 
by law.  The defense announced that it will appeal the verdict 
before the Federal Supreme Court (BGH).  Rashid will remain 
incarcerated.  Hamburg Consulate's Pol/Econ staff attended the 
hearing.  END SUMMARY.

Virtual Jihadist War Fighting Not Covered by Free Speech

¶2. (U)  In his decision, Celle judge Wolfgang Siolek stated that 
there is "complete and overwhelming" evidence that Rashid used 
several nicknames in an open chat room called "Al Ansar 
Mujahedin," in order to promote membership and support for Al 
Qaeda and Al Qaeda in Iraq between October 6, 2005 and October 
1, 2006.  Rashid was found guilty of approving extremist 
messages, calling for participation in jihad, idealizing 
martyrdom, reporting on "successful Mujahedin attacks," and 
providing behavioral guidelines for would-be terrorists.  He was 
also convicted of exercising chat room administrator rights, and 
playing, posting, linking, and disseminating these messages over 
the internet.  The judge underscored that by spreading Al 
Qaeda's war propaganda, Rashid helped to call and prepare for 
terrorist attacks and radicalize and recruit more members.  By 
stressing that reports on "successful" jihadist operations lead 
to increased donations for the terrorist cause, the judge 
emphasized the concrete effects of Rashid's internet activities. 
 The judge argued that Rashid could not appeal to the right to 
freedom of speech and freedom of information as these rights 
were admissibly limited by the Criminal Code which he violated. 
He reiterated that Rashid knew that he was not merely exercising 
his constitutional right of free speech because he cautioned 
others in the chats from being caught by the police. 
 
¶3. (U)  The judge also stated that in phone conversations with 
his family, Rashid announced that he wanted to pursue the path 
of suicide attacks.  Referring to Rashid's closing remarks the 
judge said that Rashid unmasked himself as an irredeemable 
Islamist.  He pointed out that Rashid fought against the very 
same state which provided him freedom and guaranteed his 
livelihood, and added that through his actions Rashid placed 
himself outside the civilized community.  The judge remarked 
that he regards Rashid as a dangerous Islamist extremist and 
multiplier in the service of Al Qaeda, who, if released, would 
continue to commit terrorist activities.  This assessment 
prompted him to state:  "It can only be hoped that the foreigner 
office deports him immediately upon having served his time in 
prison." 
 
¶4. (SBU)  COMMENT:  In previous terrorist trials in Germany, 
culprits have been convicted for being members of terrorist 
organizations and/or for providing assistance to or committing 
concrete terrorist acts.  This verdict is a landmark decision in 
that it established for the first time that terrorist-related 
activities over the internet are punishable by law if there is 
evidence that the accused affirms and supports terrorism. 
Unless the defense can successfully claim before the BGH that 
the ruling contains judicial errors, the decision will stand and 
Rashid will most likely be deported to Iraq.  Both the chief 
judge and prosecutor expressed hope that Rashid's sentencing 
will have a deterrent effect on potential imitators.  The judge 
also said that the trial disclosed difficulties in the criminal 
investigation as law-enforcement agencies were unable to 
reconstruct six internet protocols (Note:  Thus, only 22 of the 
original 28 charges were pursued.  End Note.).  END COMMENT.
