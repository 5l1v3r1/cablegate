SUBJECT: KAZAKHSTAN: IMPLEMENTATION OF BOYCOTT STATUTES 
 
REF:  STATE 66895 
 
¶1.  The Kazakhstani government has no policy to support the Arab 
League Boycott (ALB), and there are no laws requiring compliance 
with ALB or any other international boycott.  Kazakhstan 
maintains full diplomatic relations with Israel, and instructed 
the Kazakhstani Embassy in Saudi Arabia not to attend the recent 
meeting held there regarding the boycott of Israel.  GOK 
officials speak proudly of the "normal full diplomatic" 
relations and substantial economic ties Kazakhstan enjoys with 
Israel. 
 
 
 
¶2.  The Kazakhstani government maintains no Arab League Boycott 
office, nor is Post aware of any official pressure on U.S. firms 
to participate in the ALB or any other international boycott. 
No suppliers, vendors, or service suppliers with whom Post 
typically does business in Kazakhstan are known to comply with 
the ALB or any other international boycott.  According to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there have been no instances of 
attempted boycott enforcement by government agencies or 
compliance requests by private entities.
