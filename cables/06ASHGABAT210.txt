¶1.  (U) On February 9, 2006, one week later than most 
Islamic countries, the GOTX expressed its opinion 
regarding the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.  Per 
reftel, the MFA issued a press release on the only 
government sponsored website, turkmenistan.ru, as well as 
in major print dailies "Turkmenistan" (government, 
Turkmen, circulation 25,591), "Neutral Turkmenistan" 
(government, Russian, circulation 31,100) expressing the 
GOTX's endorsement of the UN's statements urging 
moderation and dialogue on the issue.  On the evening of 
February 9, the daily government news program Watan TV 
News broadcast the article.  The press release was also 
published throughout Ashgabat's official media and 
covered by major media distributors, BBC Monitoring 
Newsfile, Interfax, and RIA Novosti.  The issue was 
carried by RFE/RL and some other media distributors 
February 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) By the time GOTX reacted to the issue, the 70 
percent of the population in Turkmenistan who have 
Russian TV satellite reception were already aware of the 
issue.  Most surprisingly, a popular newspaper in 
Turkmenistan, the Turkmen edition of the mainland Turkey 
Zaman newspaper of Islamist bent, had not covered the 
issue - whereas Zaman had given extensive coverage to the 
Kosova and Bosnian crises.  Reactions or opinions of the 
Turkmenistani people regarding the cartoons of the 
Prophet were not described by national media sources 
before or after the MFA official release. 
 
¶3.  Comment: Post has not heard of or seen any public 
reaction in Turkmenistan to the GOTX statement or to the 
cartoons publication.  End Comment.
