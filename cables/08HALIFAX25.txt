¶1. Summary:  Animal rights activist Paul Watson has seen 
Canadian authorities tow his vessel the "Farley Mowat" into 
Sydney, Nova Scotia and his two key officers arrested in 
connection with his traditional battle to stop Canada's seal 
hunt.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  The annual seal hunt off Canada's east coast is now fully 
underway along with the traditional bitter confrontation between 
seal hunters and animal rights activists.  As in previous years, 
Paul Watson, the controversial founder and head of the 
U.S.-based Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, is one of the 
higher-profile protestors who has a long track record of trying 
to disrupt the hunt.  On the other side are those who support 
the hunt either because of its economic importance to rural 
communities in eastern Canada, or because of its role in 
controlling the size of the seal herds.  The sealing industry 
receives considerable political support, primarily from the 
Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) which manages 
and exercises jurisdiction over the hunt.  The current federal 
minister in charge of DFO is Newfoundland-Labrador Member of 
Parliament Loyola Hearn, who also represents his province in the 
federal cabinet and is zealous in his support of the hunt. 
 
¶3.  DFO carries out its responsibilities in managing the hunt 
with the coordination of the Canadian Coast Guard, which is a 
division of DFO.  Also involved is Transport Canada which has 
jurisdiction over vessel safety regulations and enforcement 
assistance is provided through Canada's federal police force, 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). This year's hunt and 
the corresponding protest season got underway on March 20 when 
Transport Canada asserted that Watson's vessel the "Farley 
Mowat", registered in the Netherlands, violated international 
marine safety conventions.  Transport Canada subsequently 
ordered the vessel not to enter Canadian waters on two different 
occasions.  Minster Hearn asserted that the vessel did not 
respond to these orders and went on to enter Canadian waters. 
The minister also alleged that the vessel engaged in activities 
in violation of Canada's Marine Mammal regulations, as contained 
in Canada's Fisheries Act and which pertain to the minimum 
requirement for the distance between ships and seal hunters. 
These infractions allegedly took place on March 30 in Canadian 
waters in the Northumberland Strait near Cape Breton, Nova 
Scotia.  Minister Hearn claimed that when the vessel did not 
respond to these charges he asked the RCMP to board and seize 
the vessel and then have the Coast Guard tow the vessel to 
Sydney, Nova Scotia.  This boarding took place on April 12, and 
Canadian authorities have since impounded the vessel in Sydney, 
Nova Scotia. The vessel's Captain and First Officer were 
arrested for the charges relating to the mammal regulations, and 
some crew members who refused to process through Canadian 
customs were temporarily detained. Details of the arrest of the 
American crew members involved in this case are found in 
reftels. Post is unaware of any official Dutch response to the 
boarding and seizure of the "Farley Mowat". 
 
¶4.  Comment:  The seizure of the vessel and the fate of its crew 
has turned into a high profile event, with both sides vying for 
international media attention.  Post will continue to report 
significant developments relating to Watson's next steps and how 
Minister Hearn responds.  End comment.
