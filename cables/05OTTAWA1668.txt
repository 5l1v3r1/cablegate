START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Peter Gregg is Vice President Corporate Communications for 
Hydro One, North America's largest electricity delivery 
company.  Hydro One focuses on planning, building, managing 
and maintaining electrical transmission and distribution 
networks that serve Ontario.  Other business ventures 
include the marketing of excess fibre-optic capacity to 
telecommunications carriers and commercial customers. 
Prior to coming to Hydro One, Gregg was communications 
director at Toronto's Pearson International Airport, 
Canada's busiest airport, handling 28.9 million passengers 
in 2000.  Established in 1939, Pearson currently handles 
more than 1,200 arrivals and departures each day - or more 
than 426, 506 aircraft movements last year.  By the year 
2020 the number of passengers passing through the airport's 
gates is expected to reach 50 million.  Gregg successfully 
lobbied the Canadian Federal government to consider 
introducing changes to the airport and airline security 
regulations post-September 11.  He played a major role in 
influencing the nature of public policy with respect to the 
federal government's National Airports Policy.  Gregg not 
only represented Pearson Airport but the entire Canadian 
Airport industry as public affairs spokesperson during the 
immediate response to the aftermath of September 11.  He 
established the GTAA as the point of contact for national 
media with respect to transportation issues. 
His connections with the Federal Liberal Party enabled him 
to help guide legislation on behalf of the Minister of 
Transportation through the Canadian House of Commons and the 
Senate on numerous occasions including amendments to the 
Canadian Transportation Act and the National Marine Act. 
His participation in an IV program will provide long-term 
benefits to meet the energy and security/border cooperation 
goals, as well as the growing need to address the 
infrastructure and restructuring of electricity transmission 
grids between Ontario and the United States.
