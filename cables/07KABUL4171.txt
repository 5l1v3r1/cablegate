SUBJECT: Takhar, Afghanistan: Secure and Stable, but Development 
Lacking 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Takhar province has remained relatively secure and 
stable throughout 2007.  While there have been rocket and IED 
attacks directed against Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), the 
disruption of an insurgent cell in September 2007 has resulted in a 
significant decrease in insurgent activity.  Taloqan remains without 
electricity, highlighting the greater development challenges it 
faces when compared with the neighboring province of Kunduz.  The 
German government plans to remedy the lack of a permanent 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) presence in Taloqan 
through the expansion of its safe house into a Provincial Advisory 
Team (PAT).  End Summary. 
 
Security - Lack of an Insurgent Priority? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) While Kunduz and Takhar provinces have similar populations 
(approximately 800,000), the greater geographical dispersion, 
distance from the national and other provincial capitals and lack of 
infrastructure contribute to the small-town feel of the provincial 
capital of Taloqan.  Without Afghan governmental regional offices 
(with the exception of the 8th Border Police Brigade), a permanent 
ISAF presence or a large NGO community, Taloqan has not been a high 
priority insurgent target.  The large, roughly equal Tajik and Uzbek 
populations (40 percent-40 percent), and lack of a sizable Pashtun 
presence, contribute to a lack of ethnic strife. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Over the past year insurgents have targeted the Afghan 
National Police (ANP) headquarters and the Kunduz' PRT safe house in 
Taloqan with rockets and IEDs.  A premature IED detonation in 
September 2007 led to the successful disruption of the cell that had 
been conducting attacks and distributing propaganda.  Since then the 
number of attacks has dropped significantly.  The Kunduz - Taloqan 
road, Takhar and Badakshan's connection with the rest of 
Afghanistan, remains an area of concern, especially in the 
Kunduz-bordering district of Bangi.  There have been IED attacks 
against coalition forces in this area, most recently in November 
¶2007.  For northeast Afghanistan to reap the benefits of the USG's 
$104 million investment in the Keshem - Feyzabad road (expected 
completion date November 2009), the road must continue to be 
passable and secure.  Furthermore, in the upcoming year the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers intends to construct 10 Afghan National 
Police checkpoints, which should help improve security in outlying 
areas of the province. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The German government decided in November 2007 to expand 
its safe house and create a permanent presence in Taloqan. 
Taloqan's distance (75 km) from Kunduz limited the PRT's ability to 
engage the Afghan government and contribute to security and 
reconstruction in the provincial capital and the surrounding area. 
The Taloqan facility will be a dependent office of PRT Kunduz and 
will house 40 military and civilian personnel, including 
representatives from the German Foreign Ministry and the development 
agency.  This year brought two new U.S. Army police mentoring teams 
for the province that reside in Kunduz.  The Afghan Ministry of 
Interior intends to merge the 8th Border Police Brigade with that in 
Mazar-i-Sharif into a northern Brigade, thereby reducing the ANSF 
presence in the province. 
 
No Electricity, Few Internationals, Little Development 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Unlike its neighbor, Taloqan does not have access to 
power.  Eventually, donors plan to connect Taloqan to the national 
grid; however, interim considerations are the renovation and 
expansion of the Khanabad hydroelectric plant in Kunduz province or 
the construction of mini-hydroelectric facilities closer to 
Taloqan. 
 
¶6.  (U) The NGO, German Agro Action, relocated its facilities from 
Kunduz to Taloqan, joining a small number of NGOs and IOs operating 
in the city.  The German-funded and -administered Provincial 
Development Fund (PDF) has successfully funded small development 
projects and promoted good governance through its approval process. 
It is only through the PDF that the Provincial Council has any 
budgetary approval role in development. 
 
¶7.  (U) Driven by international donors or money from outside of the 
 
KABUL 00004171  002 OF 002 
 
 
province, Taloqan lacks the indigenous growth and private sector 
activity that one sees in Kunduz.  Takhar often piggybacks on Kunduz 
development initiatives, for instance Takhar businesses participated 
in the Afghan-Tajik trade fair that was held in Kunduz in October 
¶2007.  The German PT should increase the reach of German development 
euros, Afghan and international awareness, and associated funding, 
for the province's challenges. 
 
Governance 
---------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Governor Latif Ibrahimi transferred from Faryab to Takhar 
in summer 2007.  Despite his experience as governor, or perhaps his 
familiarity with its institutional shortcomings, he is slightly 
aloof, except when it comes to issues close to his heart (e.g. the 
governor's residence).  He maintains cordial relations with other 
political institutions, such as the Provincial Council; however, has 
not yet proven to be an activist governor.  The Chief of Police 
position has been vacant since October 2007, with Deputy Mahmoodi 
currently acting.  The Provincial Council has taken an interest in 
the German PDF as a vehicle to bring development projects to their 
constituencies. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Comment: Takhar is neither a primary target for insurgents 
nor the focus of development activities.  Information about the 
province is meager when compared with Kunduz, not only due to the 
lack of political and economic activity, but also the lack of 
permanent ISAF presence.  The German PAT should increase both our 
engagement with, and knowledge of, Takhar province.  End Comment.
