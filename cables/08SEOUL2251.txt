Classified By: POL M/C Joseph Y. Yun. Reasons 1.4(b/d) 
 
¶1. (C) Poloff delivered reftel talking points on reported 
irregularities in the November 9 Nicaraguan municipal 
elections to ROK Mininstry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
Central America and Caribbean Division Director Lee Eun-chul 
on November 21.  Director Lee said that the Korean Embassy in 
Managua had reported violent clashes between the Nicaraguan 
Sandinista Liberation Front (FSLN) and opposition.  These 
developments were of concern to Seoul as 500 Korean nationals 
live in Nicaragua and 20 Korean companies have a presence 
there. 
 
¶2. (C) Regarding the allegations of election irregularities, 
Director Lee commented that Organization of American States 
(OAS) observers were normally present for elections in the 
region.  The ROK, in fact, had played an observer role at the 
request of the OAS during elections in Ecuador.  Director Lee 
said he would consult with the Korean Embassy in Managua and 
other relevant offices to consider the matter of joining 
others in calling for transparent recounts in the presence of 
credible observers.
