Classified By: DCM David J. Keegan, 
for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) On September 27, Matthew Paterson, Senior Policy 
Officer in the Security Policy Division at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) confirmed to PE Couns that 
GNZ has approved the deployment of a 6-person technical team 
for UNMAS/UNIFIL, pending UN approval and the identification 
of force protection and logistics support.  The team  will 
offer technical assistance on demining and unexploded 
ordinances work, and will undertake surveys of mine sites. 
It will be deployed for 12-months from October. 
 
¶2.  (C) Paterson said that the UN has already accepted GNZ's 
offer of a 4-person demining team (reftel).  GNZ is still 
working to get the appropriate force protection for the team, 
and anticipates this will come through soon.
