¶4.  (C) SUMMARY.  FM Moratinos requested the meeting with

Western Balkans.  He confirmed Spain,s support of the Butmir 
process and asked for a U.S. blessing on an early-February 
proposed gathering in Madrid of Bosnian and regional leaders. 
 Moratinos also commented on Spain,s role as EU President in 
the first half of 2010 during a transition to a new framework 
for the EU under the Lisbon Treaty.  He noted that he 
expected to work well with High Representative Ashton and 
that Spain would take a non-obstructionist stance on Kosovo 
during its Presidency.  The Deputy Secretary stressed the 
importance of the Bosnian parties negotiating in Sarajevo and 
U.S. commitment to Serbian integration into Euro-Atlantic 
structures.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------- 
Bosnia 
------- 
 
¶5.  (C) FM Moratinos opened the meeting with an overview of 
his perspective of the Western Balkans.  With regards to 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, he indicated that Spain wants to 
follow up on the Butmir process and promised to coordinate 
closely with the United States.  He also noted his plans to 
convene a meeting among Bosnian and regional leaders in 
Madrid in early February to bring them to an agreement on 
needed reforms.  On Bosnia and broader foreign policy issues, 
Moratinos noted he had had a &very positive8 meeting on 
12/3 with EU High Representative Ashton and believes the two 
will work productively together during Spain,s 2010 EU 
Presidency.  He commented that Ashton is &clever enough to 
trust me and my team.8 
 
¶6.  (C) Moratinos asked for U.S. blessing of his plan for a 
one-week retreat for Bosnian leaders in Madrid in early 
February.  The Deputy Secretary suggested it would be more 
productive for Bosnian leaders to negotiate a resolution in 
Sarajevo.  Bringing politicians far from their electorate 
could cause them to be overly cautious.  The Deputy Secretary 
also cautioned that the parties were still pretty far apart 
in their positions on the Butmir texts and pushing them 
together prematurely risked highlighting their differences. 
He urged Moratinos to ensure that the parties could indeed 
reach agreement before he convened the meeting.  A large high 
profile meeting outside the region which failed risks 
undermining reform in general.  If the parties cannot agree 
on the current texts early in 2010 it would be better to 
leave a solid package on the table with which they can 
restart after the October elections.  The Deputy Secretary 
explained that there are three leaders who have not accepted 
the currents texts:  Haris Silajdzic, Milorad Dodik and 
Zlatko Lagumdzija.  It is unlikely that Silajdzic would agree 
to any text;  Dodik has made noises about wanting to reach 
agreement but has not engaged on specifics.  Lagumdzija has 
fully rejected the package. The Deputy Secretary urged 
Moratinos to try to persuade   Lagumdzija to adopt a more 
constructive posture towards the process ) the sooner the 
better.  Moratinos agreed to follow up with Lagumdzija 
immediately.   He asked the Deputy Secretary to send his 
Bosnia experts to Madrid early in the New Year being our 
collaboration. 
 
---------- 
Macedonia 
---------- 
 
¶7.  (C) During a recent meeting between FM Moratinos and 
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, Papandreou indicated 
that he was ready to move forward on the name issue with 
Macedonia.  The Deputy Secretary noted that he had heard 
similar reports and that PM Papandreou needs to act quickly. 
He also suggested that Greek PM Papandreou and Macedonian PM 
Gruevski should deal with one another directly; an 
interlocutor would not be useful.  He hoped that each side 
would gain confidence in the situation as small steps are 
made.  The Deputy Secretary underscored that the EU will need 
to stand firm behind whatever decision is made on the name 
issue. 
 
------ 
Kosovo 
------ 
 
¶8.  (C) The Deputy Secretary made clear that there is no 
going back on Kosovar independence.  Moratinos assured the 
Deputy Secretary that Spain would not take an obstructionist 
position on Kosovo during its EU Presidency in 2010. 
Moratinos is cognizant that the majority of EU member states 
have recognized  independence, and promised  that Spain will 
represent the Union as a whole.  Moratinos underscored that 
he wants Kosovo to be a pro-Western ally. 
 
-------- 
Croatia 
-------- 
 
¶9.  (C) Moratinos stated that during Spain,s EU Presidency, 
he expects an institutional push for negotiations with 
Croatia to join the European Union and a final offer of 
membership.  He also recommends that Croatia be held up as a 
success story for other Western Balkan countries to use as a 
model for progress, perhaps at a high-level meeting of Balkan 
leaders in May to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the 
Zagreb conference (which confirmed the EU,s commitment to 
the integration of the Western Balkans into the EU.)
