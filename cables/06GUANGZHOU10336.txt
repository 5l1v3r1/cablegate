¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Consulate Guangzhou's "Short March" to 
Eastern Guangdong cities (septel) got off to a non-rousing 
start when Shanwei officials found it "inconvenient" to 
meet with us.  This probably because Shanwei contains the 
township of Dongzhou, the site of December 2005 land 
compensation protests, which escalated into violence with 
police killing between three and 13 villagers in the melee. 
Because the Dongzhou unrest was related to Shanwei's much 
publicized attempt to turn itself into an energy farm area 
for Guangdong, we believe the "inconvenience" of meeting us 
reflected the embarrassment potential of having to discuss 
this pillar of Shanwei's 11th Five Year Plan against the 
backdrop of the inextricably connected civil unrest 
killings.  End Summary. 
 
Shanwei:  Would Have Been Worth Visiting 
---------------------------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) For Shanwei, as with every other destination on 
the "short march," we had requested meetings to discuss the 
prefecture's five year plan with a special focus on 
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.  Located 
almost halfway between Hong Kong/Shenzhen and eastern 
Guangdong's Shantou, Shanwei realized a GDP of RMB 22.45 
billion (US$ 2.81 billion), up 16.1% from the year before, 
the highest growth in the last 10 years.  This city of 3 
million has had its own negative track record of 
intellectual property rights (IPR) problems, but it has 
also attracted a large amount of foreign and domestic 
investment into a strong light goods industry in furniture, 
foodstuffs, garments, and electronics.  Recently, there has 
also been a special emphasis on developing the prefecture's 
role as a major energy "farm" for Guangdong utilizing 
alternative energy such as wind power in addition to modern 
and efficient thermal plants burning coal, oil, and natural 
gas. 
 
Inextricably Connected 
---------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) In December 2005, riots erupted in the large 
township of Dongzhou in Shanwei municipality.  On December 
6th, 2005, villagers were reportedly protesting the 
government's failure to pay them adequate compensation for 
acquiring the land previously occupied by them.  The 
government used the acquired land to build power plants to 
feed Guangdong's insatiable thirst for more electricity. 
Disgruntled villagers attacked the power plant construction 
site with dynamite, molotov cocktails, swords, and pointed 
sticks.  Armed police fired on the rioters, killing at 
least three.  Other reports claim that the police killed up 
to 13 villagers.  A police official was detained in 
connection with the riots.  These riots -- the so-called 
"12/6 incident" -- have been the subject of a gag order 
that has essentially stopped discussion by government 
officials on the subject (reftels). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On the final business day before Congenoffs were 
scheduled to depart for Shanwei, the Shanwei FAO telephoned 
congenoffs to say the timing of the planned visit was 
inconvenient.  Local FAO officials stated that due to the 
simultaneous timing of the Guangdong People's Congress and 
also because of other planned trips on their part, they 
would not have time to receive a delegation from the 
Consulate. Prior to this phone call, the Shanwei FAO had 
confirmed that the city's vice mayor welcomed Congenoffs' 
visit and had even scheduled times for appointments.  The 
FAO did say, however, that Shanwei would welcome the visit 
at a later, more "convenient" date. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) To test that proposal, we submitted a follow on 
request to meet with Shanwei officials later in that month 
while returning from the Consulate's "Long March" to the 
heart of Hakka and Minnan country in northeastern Guangdong 
and southwestern Fujian.  Again, we were told that 
 
GUANGZHOU 00010336  002 OF 002 
 
 
officials could not meet with us, but the Shanwei FAO did 
recommend a place for the Consulate party to spend one 
night on the way home.  The FAO thus "accommodated" us in 
the rather out of the way county of Haifeng (far distant 
from Dongzhou and Shanwei's urban district) even though it 
ultimately could not "convenience" us with some actual 
meetings.
