COORDINATION, AND STABILITY 
 
¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU). Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2. (U) Summary.  Sustained peace in Aceh, increased Marine Police 
capabilities as a result of additional assets and training provided 
by USG and others, and improved coordination with Singapore 
authorities have led to a steady decline in reports of pirate 
attacks in the Strait of Malacca (SOM) and Indonesia since 2005. 
Since that time, there have only been two significant attacks on 
vessels in the SOM. According to police and navy contacts, the 
majority of incidents currently reported are sea robbery -- attacks 
that take place in port while the ship is berthed or anchored rather 
than piracy. End Summary. 
 
Piracy Reports Down Significantly 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Between 2000 to 2005, Indonesian waters and the SOM were 
considered among the world's most dangerous waters for pirate 
attacks. Lloyd's of London in 2005 declared the SOM an "area with 
security threats to shipping" causing insurance premiums to rise. 
Lloyd's removed the SOM from the ranking in 2006 after marked 
improvements. Data from the Kuala Lumpur-based Piracy Reporting 
Center of the International Chamber of Commerce, International 
Maritime Bureau (IMB) shows a sustained decrease in incident reports 
in Indonesia and the SOM since 2005.  Indeed Indonesia is on track 
for the first time in a decade to not be the country with the most 
number of piracy reports (Note: IMB data showed Nigeria, India, and 
the Gulf of Aden having more reported attacks than Indonesia in the 
first quarter of 2008.)  Marine police and Indonesian Navy contacts 
indicate much of the reported piracy is actually "sea robbery", 
attacks that take place in port while the ship is berthed or 
anchored. 
 
Piracy Decreased After Peace Accords 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) To a significant extent, SOM piracy was a function of the 
conflict in Indonesia's Aceh Province, where the Aceh Independence 
Movement (GAM) was fighting a separatist battle against the national 
government.  When the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) 
between the central government and GAM broke down in 2000, incidents 
of piracy in the SOM and the Eastern coast of Sumatra increased 
significantly.  During this period, piracy incidents were generally 
in the SOM along the northern edge of Sumatra with isolated 
incidents off the coast of Bangka Island.  According to police and 
military sources, the majority of cases were attributed to the Free 
Aceh Movement rebels. Other observers and ship owners based in Medan 
have said some of this piracy was carried out by members of the 
Indonesian security forces posing as Aceh rebels.  After the 2005 
Helsinki peace accord, incidents of piracy dropped dramatically. 
Since that time, there have been only two significant attacks on 
vessels in the SOM.  Other reported attacks were on vessels parked 
at or near ports. 
 
U.S. Assistance Improves Security 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) INL-funded Department of Justice (DOJ)/ International 
Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) 
assistance to the National Police has helped develop Marine Police 
capabilities in the SOM and near Bangka Island to deter and capture 
pirates.  Patrol boats and training provided over the last year have 
led to a dramatic increase in the number of arrests for sea robbery 
and piracy.  According to Colonel Yassin, Marine Police Director in 
Batam, the increased capabilities from the boats allowed for 
increased coordination with Singaporean counterparts. Since then, 
the Indonesian Marine Police and Singapore Customs and Marine Police 
have begun to meet regularly and increase their coordination on 
patrols.  The boats have also been instrumental in interdicting 
shipments of illegal logs, illegal immigrants, and smuggled fuel. 
 
¶6. (SBU) U.S. assistance in the pipeline will further boost 
Indonesian capability in the near future.  Through assistance 
provided under Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act, the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) is installing a system 
of land- and sea-based radars along the east coast of Sumatra which 
will enable the Indonesian Navy to deter piracy and improve security 
in the SOM.  The system is slated for completion in 2009. 
 
Continued Assistance Needed to Maintain Security 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Marine Police and Indonesian Navy contacts note that 
security is enhanced directly as a result of U.S. assistance.  They 
consider continued training programs and assistance with critical 
assets vital to maintaining security in the SOM and Indonesian's 
expansive archipelago.
