¶1. (SBU) Summary: A prominent pro-regime IDP leader in Abu Shouk 
Camp was murdered in the early morning of August 2, according to IDP 
and UN sources.  Omer Adam Ishaq, known as "Saroukh", was shot and 
killed along with his wife by unknown gunmen at his home.  Reasons 
for the attack are unknown pending further investigation.  However, 
some IDPs have suggested Saroukh's alleged involvement in a 
government crackdown on Abu Shouk marketplace and his attempt to 
regulate commerce in the camp as possible motives. GOS police are 
investigating the incident. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Abdallah Adam Al Basher, Abu Shouk Resident and Member of 
the Fur Shura Council in North Darfur, told polasst on August 2 that 
Saroukh, an Umda (community leader) from the Fur tribe, was known 
for strong pro-regime views.  According to Al Basher, Saroukh had 
recently antagonized some members of the IDP community with his role 
in a government attempt to regulate commerce in Abu Shouk market and 
to crack down on illegal activities there. Al Basher stated that the 
day before Saroukh's murder, approximately 40 Toyota Landcruisers 
filled with police and Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) raided the market 
looking for contraband, searching stores, arresting numerous 
merchants, and confiscating diesel and gasoline fuel. The perception 
among the merchant community was that Saroukh was involved, said Al 
Basher, and later that night Saroukh and his wife were killed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNAMID Civil Affairs sources confirmed to Poloff on August 
3 that Saroukh was head of the Abu Shouk Market Planning Committee, 
an entity established by the Commissioner of El Fasher approximately 
three weeks ago to regulate commerce in the camp. The Committee had 
commenced work in delineating the market area to contain its sprawl, 
and apparently gave some merchants orders to evacuate certain 
locales.  Further plans were underway to tax merchants for engaging 
in commercial activity, as is done in El Fasher market.  This 
annoyed shop owners, who argued that the government provided no 
services to the market to justify payment of taxes. The police raid 
on the market further exacerbated tensions, they said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Al Basher told Poloff that Saroukh remained an unpopular 
figure in Abu Shouk camp due to his role in coordinating the 
spraying of insecticide that sickened several women in April 2009 
and led to several days of unrest in the camp (Ref A).  He also 
apparently caused a stir by inviting the Wali of North Darfur to 
lead Eid prayers in Abu Shouk in 2007, which was met with violent 
protest from camp youth.  While the Wali's convoy managed to escape 
their stone throwing, Saroukh was beaten and taken to a hospital for 
medical care. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Saroukh had previously met Senators Isakson and Corker in 
their May 2009 visit to Abu Shouk (Ref B). During the meeting, the 
tall Saroukh adopted a pragmatic tone towards both the government 
and the international community.  He told the CODEL that fighting 
had displaced his family from Jebel Si in April 2004, and while they 
intended to return someday, the security situation in North Darfur 
prevented them from leaving Abu Shouk.  "At the beginning, it was an 
emergency, but it is a little better now," he added, thanking the 
international community for its efforts in Darfur.  Addressing the 
expulsion of thirteen humanitarian NGOs in March 2009, Saroukh 
praised UNICEF and the GOS Ministry of Health for stepping in to run 
clinics and sanitation operations in the camp of approximately 
40,000 mostly Fur IDPs.  "I am hopeful the government and the 
movements will work to bring peace," he told Senators Corker and 
Isakson.  "My family doesn't want to live in this camp.  We want to 
go home." 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: It is unclear whether the attempted crackdown on 
Abu Shouk market is the action of local officials or a major 
operation planned from Khartoum.  In either case, raids on IDP camps 
tend to galvanize local feelings against the regime and further 
exacerbate tensions, often with disastrous results.  An August 2008 
Sudanese Armed Forces attempt to search for weapons in Kalma IDP 
camp outside of Nyala in South Darfur resulted in the deaths of 
dozens of civilians, including women and children (Ref C).
