¶1. "Two Hypotheses For Qaddafi's Obstinacy" 
 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo's Paris correspondent Giles 
Lapouge opined (12/20): "All experts reject that the five defendants 
have committed such a monstrous crime.... We believe that the 
accusation that they have inoculated the AIDS virus in the children 
is false.  How then to explain Colonel Qaddafi's obstinacy in 
persecuting those six people?  There are two hypotheses.  The first 
is that the Libyan population, persuaded that the six defendants 
have really committed the crime, has exerted so much pressure that 
Qaddafi has been unable to oppose the popular desire for revenge. 
The second hypothesis is that Qaddafi is using this case to obtain 
financial or political advantages from Western nations. The five 
nurses and the doctor would then be mere bargaining chips with which 
Qaddafi would consolidate his position on the international 
scene.... One should not forget that Qaddafi's cynicism is 
bottomless.... He was recently removed from the list of Washington's 
'devilish' leaders, but his past justifies the most repugnant 
hypotheses." 
 
¶2. "Mercosul's Implosion" 
 
The lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (12/20) 
maintained: "Mercosul's funeral will be much more vivacious with the 
participation of Bolivian Evo Morales, a follower of Hugo Chvez, 
who admitted that he joined the bloc to implode it. The Mercosul 
partners will soon be able to burn previous treaties and sign a new 
regional pact, of Bolivarian inspiration and opposed to any trade 
agreement with the rich world's major markets.... Neither of the two 
inclusions [Venezuela and Bolivia] helps to achieve Mercosul's 
original goals.... The FTAA idea is already past, as President Lula 
recently observed with a triumphant tone.... The new partners are 
the guarantee of the bloc's implosion, unless one believes that it 
will survive with the format Chvez wants to impose on it."
