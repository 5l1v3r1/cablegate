REF: MVD 60 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.       Charg???? met with ruling Frente Amplio (FA) coalition 
president Jorge Brovetto February 3 to explain the U.S. role in 
Haiti disaster relief and underscore the extensive support the USG 
is providing to Uruguayan peacekeepers in Haiti.  She emphasized 
the moral imperative our entire government and country feels to 
come to the aid of Haiti, our full respect for the country's 
sovereignty, one government response, and our close coordination 
with MINUSTAH and other donors.  She urged a joint public stance of 
collaboration that reflects our joint work together on this vital 
mission.  Background: The FA issued a declaration January 28 
articulating concern that ""hegemonic powers"" would take advantage 
of the current situation, and incoming Minister of Defense Luis 
Rosadilla, currently in Haiti, has made similar statements. 
 
 
 
¶2.       Brovetto explained that no one in the GOU or the Frente 
Amlio coalition has the slightest doubt about the vital role the 
USG is playing or the fact that our intentions are only to help the 
people of Haiti.  He added that he understands the significant U.S. 
military presence is natural and necessary, because the U.S. armed 
forces are the only organization in the world with the capacity to 
really help.   He characterized the January 28 FA declaration was 
drafted by a political commission, and he had felt release of it 
was a harmless way to let some leftist members of his coalition 
blow off steam.  Brovetto then made an unsolicited offer to discuss 
the constructive and critical role of  the U.S. effort in Haiti 
during  a February 4 gathering of the FA's legislative factions. 
While this statement will not necessarily be publicized in the 
press, he believes it will lay the groundwork for putting the issue 
to rest.  Charge agreed it would be extremely helpful.  Brovetto 
complimented the Embassy for keeping our media focus on the 
positive message on the USG's help for the people of Haiti.
