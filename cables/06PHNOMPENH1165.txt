SUBJECT:  AUSTRALIAN PEDOPHILE CONVICTED DESPITE WITNESS WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Summary:  The Phnom Penh Appeals Court has upheld the 
conviction of an Australian pedophile despite the withdrawal of 
complaints against the accused by nine of ten witnesses.  We are 
pleased that the Cambodian court relied on forensic evidence to 
uphold the conviction and did not let itself be swayed by the 
withdrawal of the witnesses' complaints.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On June 9, despite the withdrawal of complaints against 
accused Australian pedophile Bart Lauwert by nine of the ten 
witnesses, the Phnom Penh Appeals Court upheld its sentence of a 
20-year jail term because forensic evidence pointed to Lauwert's 
guilt. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Lauwert's former Phnom Penh roommate, Clinton Betteridge, 
who in 2003 had been convicted in absentia to 10 years in prison 
after fleeing Cambodia for Australia, was released from an 
Australian prison that same day.  According to press reports, the 
Australian Justice Minister cited as the basis for Betteride's 
release the Cambodian government's failure to respond to a request 
for a retrial and the fact that witnesses had recanted their 
testimony.  Betteridge also claimed that he had been tortured while 
in Siem Riep prison.  The witnesses who had recanted their 
testimonies accused CWCC of having offered them $5000 each to 
testify against the Australians and keeping them in a shelter 
against their will. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Cambodian Women's Crisis Center (CWCC) Director Oung 
Chanthol expressed disappointment with Australia's release of 
Betteridge, claiming that there was more than enough evidence to 
secure a conviction, including pornographic material, photographs of 
the victims, graphic testimony and drugs.  She also dismissed the 
claim that police tortured Betteridge in jail.  Chantol added that 
she thought the allegation that CWCC paid the victims for their 
testimony was an attempt to exact revenge on CWCC for its role in 
gathering evidence in the case. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Pedophile message board members have launched multiple 
websites in support of the two pedophiles. On these websites, photos 
of CWCC staff are posted to alert other pedophiles, as well as 
information that teaches ways to intimidate CWCC can also be found. 
Other sites contain statements exonerating the pedophiles and 
generic letters addressed to Australian government officials for 
readers to print and sign. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Comment.  Often in Cambodia, witnesses withdraw their 
complaints or refuse to provide testimony in criminal cases because 
of threats or bribes.  We are pleased that, despite the witnesses' 
withdrawal from this case, for once the Cambodian courts appear to 
have done the right thing in upholding Lauwert's sentence by relying 
on overwhelming forensic evidence.
