SUBJECT: INFORMING BELARUS, KAZAKHSTAN, AND UKRAINE OF 
U.S. INTENTIONS TO PURSUE BILATERAL START FOLLOW-ON 
AGREEMENT 
 
¶1.  (U) Secure communications with Minsk remains 
unavailable.  Post is requested to pass SBU points to 
appropriate host government officials. 
 
¶2.  (U) This is an action cable.  Astana, Minsk, Kyiv, 
and Moscow:  please see appropriate paragraphs below.  Posts 
should be aware that the information will be passed to 
appropriate officials at corresponding embassies in 
Washington on March 31. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Background and Objective:  The United States 
will be pursuing a follow-on agreement to the START 
Treaty.  As has been made clear previously, the United 
States intends to pursue this as a bilateral agreement 
that further reduces the strategic forces of both the 
United States and Russia.  In advance of the meeting 
between Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 1, it is 
necessary to advise the Republic of Belarus, the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, and Ukraine that the U.S. President 
intends to announce the pursuit of that bilateral START follow- 
on agreement with Russia. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action for Embassy Astana:  Deliver to host 
government officials, at an appropriate level, the 
non-paper below.  Post is requested to report delivery 
and reactions. 
 
Begin text of non-paper: 
 
The Republic of Kazakhstan has been a valued Partner in 
implementation of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty 
(START) since its entry into force, as provided for in 
the Lisbon Protocol.  The United States wishes to express 
appreciation for the leadership role that Kazakhstan has 
played in these efforts since 1995.  We recognize the 
historical and valuable disarmament contribution of 
Kazakhstan through its renunciation of nuclear weapons 
and its accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as 
a non-nuclear weapons state.  On the basis of the status 
of the United States, together with the Russian Federation, 
as nuclear weapons States-Parties to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and for other reasons, it is the 
intention of the United States to engage in negotiation 
of a legally binding follow-on agreement to the START 
Treaty on a bilateral basis with the Russian Federation.  The 
work accomplished by our mutual association in Treaty 
activities has reflected well on both our nations, and 
our Treaty experts look forward to continued consultations 
with your Treaty experts through expiration of the START 
Treaty.

¶6.  (SBU) Action for Embassy Kyiv: Deliver to host 
government officials, at an appropriate level, the 
non-paper below.  Post is requested to report delivery 
and 
reactions. 
 
Begin text of non-paper: 
 
Ukraine has been a valued Partner in implementation of 
the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) since its entry 
into force.  The United States wishes to express 
appreciation for the active role that Ukraine has played 
in these efforts, as well as the important steps that 
Ukraine took in signing the Lisbon Protocol.  We 
recognize the historical and valuable disarmament contribution of 
Ukraine through its renunciation of nuclear weapons and 
its accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as 
a non-nuclear weapons state, in addition to Ukraine's 
active role in the workings of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. 
 
We wish to inform you that it is the intention of the 
United States to engage in negotiation of a 
legally-binding follow-on agreement to the START Treaty 
on a bilateral basis with the Russian Federation.  We 
recall your non-paper of February 25, 2009, which stated that 
further discussion between the United States and Ukraine 
with regard to concerns about the nonproliferation and 
disarmament process would be beneficial.  We would 
welcome such discussions.  In addition, we reiterate that the 
United States remains committed to the economically 
feasible, technologically sound elimination of fuel from 
the SS-24 loaded motor cases.  The work accomplished by 
our mutual association in Treaty activities has 
reflected well on both our nations, and our Treaty experts look 
forward to continued consultations with your Treaty 
experts through the expiration of the START Treaty. 
 
End text of non-paper. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Action for Embassy Moscow: Deliver the 
following points to appropriate host government officials after 
March 31. 
 
- Prior to the April 1, 2009, meeting between our two 
Presidents, we briefed appropriate government officials 
in Astana, Minsk, and Kyiv of the U.S. intention to pursue 
a legally binding follow-on agreement to the START Treaty 
on a bilateral basis with the Russian Federation. 
 
- We recommend that you also reach out to our START 
Treaty Partners and advise them along these same lines. 
 
- (If asked) In advising these Parties that the United 
States intends to pursue negotiation of a legally 
binding follow-on agreement to the START Treaty on a bilateral 
basis with the Russian Federation, we noted the valuable 
contributions of these three Partners to START 
implementation since entry into force and noted that our 
Treaty experts look forward to continued consultations 
with their Treaty experts through the expiration of the 
Treaty. 
 
End points.
