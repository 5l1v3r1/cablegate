REF: HARARE 245 AND PREV 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy contacts in both the MDC and ZANU-PF 
reported at 17:30 Sunday evening that President Mugabe was 
planning to declare himself the winner of Zimbabwe's 
presidential election.  MDC sources understood the 
announcement was scheduled for 18:30 pm local time; ZANU-PF 
sources were less definitive.  MDC sources said the MDC would 
preempt the Mugabe announcement by releasing results showing 
that Morgan Tsvangirai won the election. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy EAC assembled at 18:30 and discussed this 
information.  Ambassador chaired the meeting which was 
attended by DCM, RSO, CONS, RAO, POL, AID, MGT and DAO.  The 
EAC agreed that Post should activate the warden network and 
advise all American citizens and Embassy staff to return to 
their homes and remain for the evening.  Further information 
would be provided early Monday morning concerning whether to 
resume normal activities. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Subsequent to the EAC, MDC sources informed Post 
they believed the Mugabe announcement would be delayed, so 
they were delaying their announcement.  The EAC determined to 
maintain its decision to advise citizens to standfast 
overnight.
