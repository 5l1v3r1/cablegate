SUBJECT:  TURKMENISTAN:  RUSSIAN EMBASSY "SOFT POWER" FALLS 
A BIT FLAT 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Russian Embassy opened an exhibit at the 
National Art Museum on February 11 -- photographs of 
Turkmenistan taken by Russian Embassy diplomats.  In his 
opening speech, Russian Ambassador Igor Blatov noted the 
exhibit coincides with the first anniversary of President 
Gurbanguly Myalikguliyevich Berdimuhamedov's election.  His 
translator mangled the president's name and had to try three 
times to get it out.  Blatov added that the exhibit, even 
more importantly, is in honor of Russian Diplomatic Workers' 
Day.  He noted, "Most countries don't honor their diplomatic 
workers, so we invite you to join us for this celebration." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Apart from Russian Embassy employees and local 
culture-vultures, the turn-out was rather sparse.  Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vepa Hajiyev and several Ministry of Culture 
representatives attended from the Government of Turkmenistan. 
 Blatov walked off the stage before introducing the 
host-government officials, and so a Ministry of Culture 
representative asked to take the microphone to declare the 
exhibit open, but the microphpone was already turned off. 
The only diplomats who attended, other than the Charge, were 
the Iranian DCM who is a happy-go-lucky glad-hander, the 
ever-glowering DCM of Belarus, the Polish Ambassador, the 
Turkish DCM, and the Tajikistani Ambassador who will attend 
anything if there's the possibility of a buffet and open bar. 
 However, the buffet was decidedly downscale, and only a few 
die-hards stayed for it.  The bar closed after the first 
round of drinks.  Charge noticed the bartenders then slugging 
back the vodka. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The concept was a good idea -- diplomats 
celebrate the host country.  And several of the photos were 
above snap-shot quality.  But all in all, the opening seemed 
to lack the elan and professionalism one would expect from a 
polished public diplomacy event.  END COMMENT.
