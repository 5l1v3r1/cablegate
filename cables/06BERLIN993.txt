REF: 05 BERLIN 4215 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: A rise in German business confidence indexes 
signaled a change of mood about Germany's economic prospects 
in early 2006.  Many linked the boost to Chancellor Merkel's 
"honeymoon" effect as business groups put high hopes in the 
new government and a turnaround from Germany's wan 0.9% 
growth in 2005.  However, the economic fundamentals still 
suggest Germany's growth will remain relatively modest in 
¶2006.  Although Economics Minister Glos informally touts an 
optimistic 2.0 percent growth, the Government's official 
growth figure is 1.4 percent; the European Commission 
projects 1.5 percent.  The officially appointed Council of 
Economic Advisors, a watchdog group of senior German 
economists, projects Germany will achieve only about 1.0 
percent growth because of stagnant wage trends and nearly 
zero growth in consumer spending.  The Merkel coalition 
awaits a spurt of consumer spending in advance of a looming 
January 2007 hike in the VAT by 3 percentage points. 
However, the same VAT's implementation will likely cause a 
setback in consumer spending, which could slow the German 
economy in early 2007. 
 
GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S INTERNAL PROJECTIONS 
 
¶2.  (U) Those forecasting stronger 2006 growth rely on 
projections of robust new plant investment (long delayed) and 
continued strong performance by German exporters.  However, 
2005 fourth quarter figures reflect lower plant investment 
and overall growth than expected.  Since Schroeder's 
announcement of snap national elections in May 2005, a 
variety of surveys of business and consumer confidence have 
continued to register sharp increases, with some surveys 
reaching their highest levels in more than five years. 
However, despite the optimism, the Economics Ministry's 
official forecast currently projects Germany's economy will 
grow by only 1.4 percent in 2006.  The Federal Statistical 
Office issued new numbers at the end of February showing 
growth in investment in equipment during the third quarter of 
2005 was only 1.6 percent, not 3.8 percent as previously 
thought.  Moreover, in the fourth quarter of 2005, equipment 
investment stagnated, growing only 0.1 percent.  This 
development led to fears that the investment upswing, on 
which so many hopes had been pinned, might be weaker than 
expected.  In addition, industrial production in Germany 
actually decreased 0.5 percent in December 2005, while GDP 
growth slowed to a halt, registering exactly zero in the 
fourth quarter. 
 
VAT HIKE RISKS 2007 GROWTH 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Economics Ministry's key forecaster told the 
Embassy half the growth in 2006 would come from exports and 
another quarter percentage point will result from consumers' 
squeezing in big-ticket purchases before a three percent VAT 
hike goes into effect at the beginning of 2007.  The 
forecaster said private consumption would rise only 0.3 
percent in real terms this year, too little to support a 
strong recovery as real wages, stagnant or worse since 1998, 
continue to sink.  (Wages are projected to decline a further 
1.6 percent this year.)  The Economics Ministry official said 
the three percentage point hike in the VAT would have a 
starkly negative impact on growth in 2007, slowing the 
economy by 0.75 percent.  He noted that the Ministry's 
internal studies show the economy actually contracting by 0.5 
percent in the first quarter of 2007 because of the sharp 
increase in the VAT.  Slightly more optimistic, one of the 
government's external advisors told the Embassy the VAT hike 
would shave 0.3 to 0.5 percent off the 2007 growth rate. 
Other experts have taken a similarly dim view of the VAT 
hike's impact on growth. 
 
¶4. (U)  Prospects for more domestic demand in 2006 will fall 
short of creating strong growth.  The Economics Ministry 
foresees the savings rate will sink from 10.6 percent in 2005 
to 10.5 percent in 2006, largely because of consumers moving 
purchases into 2006 to avoid the higher VAT.  Income from 
capital gains and independent employment would rise by 3.6 
percent in real terms, according to the Economics Ministry -- 
the only component of disposable income that would go up in 
Germany in 2006.  But, he noted, this component makes up only 
35 percent of total disposable income and would not be enough 
to fuel a broad recovery.  High unemployment continues to 
contribute to a reluctance of households to consume.

¶5. (U) Most economic institutes agree with the government's 
conservative 1.4% growth projection.  In separate Embassy 
meetings, two members of the Council of Economic Advisors 
projected continued weak growth.  One predicted about 1.6 
percent growth this year, followed by a drop-off to about one 
percent next year because of the VAT increase.  The other 
Council member said he discounted recent optimism and held to 
the Council's December 2005 forecast of just 1.0% growth in 
¶2006.  In February, the European Commission revised upwards 
its forecast for German growth, from 1.2 percent to 1.5 
percent.  The Commission's report said growth would be aided 
by confidence-fueled investment in machinery and equipment, 
as well as by pre-VAT-hike consumer spending.  However, some 
banks and think tanks have issued more optimistic 
projections, including Dresdner Bank's 1.8 percent and the 
2.1 percent projection released in March by the Institute on 
the World Economy in Kiel. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: The Government and economic institutes 
generally base any projections of stronger growth on the 
eventual positive impact of economic reforms and long delayed 
domestic investment.  These forecasts often interpret recent 
robust increases in German exports as a necessary harbinger 
of renewed consumer spending.  However, since 2002, these 
analyses have proved misleading and growth has often been 
below that predicted.  The same risk remains for 2006 
projections.  Although German exports again appear headed for 
record levels and some economic reforms are taking hold, it 
is still too early to bet on overall German economic growth 
much above 1.4%.
