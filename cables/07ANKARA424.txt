PARTNERSHIP TO CODEL DICKS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Turkish FM Gul told a congressional 
delegation that the US/Turkey relationship has weathered many 
storms but that a US congressional Armenian genocide 
resolution threatens to undermine cooperation on our shared 
goals for Iraq, Afghani and more.  US failure 
`ill be Turkey's failure, Gpeighbors' process as a f/rt. Gul 
welcomed Ralenvoy but expressed 
impatience with the lack of tangible results.  e and DG Ocak 
urged the group to consider all of the facts and the 
potential ramifications before approving an Armenian genocide 
resolution, a request echoed separately by Turkish MPs.  Rep. 
Dicks welcomed the offer of a historical commission and any 
additional steps Turkey could take towards Armenia.  Rep. 
Rothman pledged to press for more action by the Iraqi Kurds 
against the PKK.  Rep. Murphy urged Turkey to provide 
additional troops to Afghanistan.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, in a February 20 
discussion with a 6-member congressional delegation led by 
Representative Norm Dicks (D-WA), enumerated Turkey's 
cooperation with the US both in the past and the present.  He 
cited Turkey's role as the eastern bulwark against the Soviet 
Union during the Cold War; support for reconciliation 
efforts, logistical support and training for Iraq; leadership 
of ISAF multiple times, opening a PRT and constructing 
schools and hospitals in Afghanistan; contribution of troops 
to peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans and Lebanon;  support 
for the international position against a nuclear Iran; and 
contributions to GWOT.  However, he said, a US congressional 
resolution on an Armenian genocide threatens to damage our 
cooperation in these areas. 
 
GENOCIDE RESOLUTION -- A PERIPHERAL ISSUE WITH GREAT IMPACT 
 
¶3. (SBU) Gul expressed frustration that arguments continue 
over an event that took place almost 100 years ago.  Calling 
the 1915 forced relocation of Armenians from Turkey a 
"tragedy," he questioned the use of the term "genocide" to 
describe an action taken against a population revolting 
against its government during wartime.  Use of the term makes 
citizens here very unhappy, especially when they recall the 3 
million Turks killed in Balkan violence during and before 
WWI.  The government will be unable to explain it if the 
measure passes. 
 
¶4. (SBU) FM Gul outlined Turkey's yet-unanswered offer to 
Armenia to establish a joint historical commission to study 
the issue.  In response to a comment by Rep. Rothman (D-NJ), 
Gul stated that the commission is open to third parties, 
including historians from California. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Vefahan Ocak, new MFA Director General (DG) for 
Americas Affairs, noted that two delegation members are 
sponsors of the latest draft resolution.  Asking rhetorically 
what other country in the region shares such a wide-ranging 
dialogue and agenda with the US, he warned that the genocide 
issue -- peripheral in comparison to our shared concerns -- 
threatens to derail bilateral cooperation on our core agenda. 
 Turkey's offer to jointly examine history is genuine, he 
said.  There is no ulterior motive.  He urged the delegation 
to study the offer and to evaluate Armenia's objections, 
which, he claimed, have no intrinsic value.  Rep. Dicks 
offered to explain Turkey's offer to others in Congress but 
urged that Turkey take any additional steps possible to reach 
out to the Armenians. 
 
IRAQ -- YOUR FAILURE IS OUR FAILURE 
 
¶6. (SBU) In response to a question by Rep. Frelinghuysen 
(R-NJ) about the consequences of a US troop withdrawal from 
Iraq, Gul said that a US failure will be Turkey's failure. 
US forces should not withdraw immediately and leave a vacuum 
behind.  Everything must be done to preserve that country's 
territorial integrity and unity.  Towards that end, Turkey 
supports President Bush' strategy to secure Baghdad.  Without 
stability or normal life in the capital, he said, one cannot 
be optimistic about the country.  The constitutional 
committee should also complete its work on possible changes 
 
to that document; issues related to energy and federalization 
need to be addressed; Kirkuk must be avoided as an issue that 
could spreadndum should be 
postpp who are not terrorists`rs should not follow maximp 
Sunnis out; and Iraqit successful to 
dat%, should continue.  The US cannot be expected to stay in 
Iraq forever, he said.  Iraqis must tke responsibility for 
themselves. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Partition is not an option, said Gul in response to 
Rep. Kaptur's (D-OH) suggestion that a "soft partition" might 
provide a solution to the instability.  Iraq is not like the 
former USSR.  There are no natural borders between the ethnic 
groups.  If Iraq was divided into three states, Iran would 
influence the Shia area and become a real threat to the Gulf 
region.  Many government and religious leaders came from 
Iran, which already has influence in Baghdad.  The Sunnis, 
however, would be the most dangerous element.  The wealthy, 
educated Sunnis would leave, stated Gul, and the terrorists 
would stay, giving al Quaeda a true fundamentalist state. 
Civil war would continue and -- willingly or not -- 
neighboring countries would get involved. 
 
JOIN FORCES WITH IRAQ'S NEIGHBORS 
 
¶8. (SBU) Gul touted the Iraqi Neighbors' process, established 
at Turkey's initiative, as a tool which the US could employ 
to foster greater regional support for Iraq's security and 
democratic development and to unite the regional countries on 
other issues.  The group has already agreed on a joint 
mechanism to counter terrorism, he said.  In response to Rep. 
Carney's (D-PA) question about what the US should do to 
stabilize the region, Gul said that US engagement is critical 
and recommended the use of "soft power" to spread the values 
of democracy, a free-market economy, and human rights.  Rep. 
Rothman applauded the Neighbors' effort and urged that 
regional leaders -- who may be more effective than the US to 
get Iraq to move forward on constitutional reforms -- use 
this forum to press for action. 
 
PKK - THE WEDGE BETWEEN FRIENDS 
 
¶9. (SBU) The PKK terrorist group is creating problems between 
the US and Turkey, said Gul.  Responding to PKK attacks 
consumes Turkey's military resources.  The Foreign Minister 
said it is unimaginable that the PKK finds safehaven in the 
friendly country of Iraq that the US supports and that Turkey 
cannot do anything about it.  Turkey has its own military and 
can act, but does not want to cause more problems in Iraq. 
It hopes the US will help.  Gul welcomed the efforts of Gen 
(ret) Ralston but said some think he was appointed to 
"satisfy Turkey and buy time."  Turkey expects a tangible 
result at the end, said Gul, and urged Congress to press the 
administration for action. 
 
TURKEY A LEADER IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶10. (SBU) Turkey has increased its troop levels in 
Afghanistan to nearly 1000, said Gul.  He noted Turkey's two 
  France, the establishmenQ and its pledge of $100 . 
This assistance heped to build and manage hospitals where 
650,00 Afghanis have been treated and to open 44 schols 
around the country where 35,000 children are being educated. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Rep. Murphy (D-PA) thanked Turkey for its 
contribution of peacekeeping troops in the Balkans and 
elsewhere.  Expressing concern about an expected Taliban 
spring offensive, Murphy asked if Turkey could contribute 
additional troops to Afghanistan.  Gul stated that Turkey's 
recent increase of troops to 1000 was done at US request and 
said that the battle in Afghanistan cannot be won by military 
means alone.  He urged the international community to 
increase efforts to reach out to the Afghan population, to 
include alternative crop development as part of the 
counter-narcotics program.  Foreign forces cannot stay in 
Afghanistan forever, said Gul.  We must strengthen the 
 
Afghans academically, socially and economically. 
 
POSITIVE ENERGY STORY 
 
¶12. (SBU) Gul called bilateral energy cooperation a good news 
story, noting the US role in the construction of the 
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.  Rep. Kaptur welcomed Gul's 
explanation of Turkey's energy pipeline projects.  Kaptur 
noted her interest in developing port-to-port cooperation 
with other countries such as Turkey. 
 
TURKISH MPs ON IRAQ AND ARMENIA 
 
¶13. (SBU) At a dinner in their honor, Codel members heardhd opposition CHP members ` 
would not like to sedrawal froy  for 
thQStudy Group report an$s provided training to Irs and 
encouraged Sunni participaion in the political process. 
They noted te sensitivity of Kirkuk as a potentially 
explosive microcosm of Iraq,s problems, and said Turkey 
expects more U.S. support against PKK terrorism from northern 
Iraq.  Reps Rothman and Kaptur urged Turkey to take a more 
active role with Iraq,s neighbors, including at the 
parliamentary level, to foster regional stability, and they 
urged more Turkish-US parliamentary dialogue, including, for 
example, via DVC. 
 
¶14. (SBU) Turkish MPs asked how congressional passage of an 
Armenian genocide resolution would serve US interests, given 
the damage it would cause to US-Turkish relations.  They 
claimed that government and opposition parties are working 
together to address Turkish-Armenian relations and both back 
the Turkish offer to establish a joint historical commission 
whose conclusions they would accept.  Turkey needs more time 
and US support for this process, not a genocide resolution, 
they stated.  Rep Rothman said it would be helpful if Turkey 
could show more leadership to improve relations with Armenia. 
 
¶15. (U) Codel Dicks did not have an opportunity to clear this 
message.
