     ¶B. MANAGUA 134 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1. (S) According to the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry, although 
Nicaragua and Iran do enjoy diplomatic relations, the 
Government of Iran currently has no diplomatic presence in 
Nicaragua, neither an embassy or consulate, nor any bilateral 
or international agency representations.  The Iranian Embassy 
in Mexico is responsible for covering Nicaragua.  As a 
result, there are currently no Iranian diplomatic activities 
in Nicaragua and no official public exposure. 
 
2.(S)  As reported in reftel B, Nicaragua theoretically owes 
Iran approximately USD 300 million in old oil debt from the 
1980s, and Foreign Minister Norman Caldera has stated that 
the two countries may have to discuss ways to resolve the 
issue at some point. 
 
¶3. (S) In recent years, the GON has periodically contacted 
the Embassy prior to issuing visas to at least some Iranian 
travelers coming to Nicaragua for unstated purposes.  The GON 
has requested checks on four such travelers since January 
2005, two of these during February 2006. 
 
¶4. (S) The total number of Iranians resident in Nicaragua or 
passing through the country is unknown.  Post is 
investigating this subject and will report on it septel.
