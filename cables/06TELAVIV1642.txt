SUBJECT: GOI ISSUES TENDERS FOR CONSTRUCTION IN HAR ADAR 
SETTLEMENT 
 
Â¶1.  (U) Press reported today, April 26, that the Israel Lands 
Authority, the Commissioner for Absentee Property, and the 
company Arim, Ltd., issued a tender for 33 plots to construct 
single-family houses in Har Adar settlement, northwest of 
Jerusalem.  The tender, which was published in Yediot 
Aharanot, did not provide any details on the sizes or costs 
of the plots.  It noted, however, that these plots "remain" 
from a tender originally published on January 1, 2005. 
(Comment:  It seems that not all of the intended plots were 
sold in 2005, and that the GOI and the construction company 
are trying once again to sell the plots.  End comment.) 
Buyers may purchase their plots between April 30 and October 
30, 2006.
