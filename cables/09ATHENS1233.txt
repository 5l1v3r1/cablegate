(SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points to Greek Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Russia Desk Officer Constantinos Tsakonas on July 10. 
Tsakonas thanked PolOff for being forthcoming with details from the 
U.S.-Russia Presidential Summit and spoke highly of efforts made to 
reinvigorate nonproliferation negotiations.  He praised President 
Obama for "following through on campaign commitments" regarding 
nonproliferation and was happy to hear that U.S. negotiators were 
working with the Russians on a follow-on agreement to the START 
treaty.  Tsakonas, who previously covered NATO and U.N. issues, 
estimated that U.S.-Russia negotiations would act as a "breath of 
fresh air" and reinvigorate U.N. and regional talks on arms control 
and disarmament.
