SUBJECT: COURT RELEASES 10 MEN DETAINED IN HOMOSEXUAL 
"DEBAUCHERY" CASE 
 
REF: A. CAIRO 598 
     Â¶B. CAIRO 484 C. CAIRO 219 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor William R. Stewart for reason 1.4 (d). (C) On June 7, Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights Executive Director Hossam Bahgat confirmed for us that on May 30 and 31 a Cairo court released 10 men who had been detained since January 2, 2009 facing charges of homosexual "debauchery" (ref C). Egyptian law criminalizes "habitual debauchery," which is interpreted to include homosexuality, and the maximum sentence is a three-year prison term. Bahgat said that the court ordered their release on May 27. We had demarched the MFA several times, noting that the men had not been formally charged and stressing USG opposition to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (reftels). We had also contacted the public prosecutor's office May 11 to request a meeting to discuss the case, but the office did not respond before the May 27 court order. Bahgat told us that his organization is working to lobby parliament and the government to amend the "debauchery" law to only criminalize sexual activity that involves a financial transaction. SCOBEY
