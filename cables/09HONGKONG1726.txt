SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: PRE-LICENSE CHECK: XIAN JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY 
 
REF: A) BIS e-mail PLC request dated August 12, 2009 B) D421571 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), attempted 
to conduct a pre-license check at Xian Jiaotong University, Unit E1, 
6/F, Wang Kwong Industrial Building, 45 Tung To Road, Kwun Tong, 
Hong Kong (Jiaotong University). The purpose of the visit was to 
determine the suitability of Jiaotong University to be the ultimate 
consignee and end user of a non-contact linear displacement 
measuring system that is the subject of export license application 
D421571.  The item (ECCN 2B006) is controlled for national security 
(NS) and nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons. The license 
applicant is Kaman Aerospace Corporation of Middletown, Connecticut. 
 
 
¶3.  A search of the Hong Kong Companies Registry revealed no entry 
for Jiaotong University. 
 
¶4. Background research on the web did not uncover any web presence 
for Jiaotong University in Hong Kong although Xian Jiaotong 
University is a large university in Xian, mainland China 
(www.xjtu.edu.cn). 
 
¶5.  On August 12, 2009, FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan called 
the contact number provided by OEA to arrange a meeting.  A Mr. Sun 
answered the phone and stated that he knew nothing of the order in 
question.  He stated that his company, Top Faith Logistics Ltd., is 
merely a logistics provider and not a trading company.  Later, Mr. 
Sun called again to state that information about the order could be 
obtained from a Mr. Jia at phone number 13682619102 in Mainland 
China.  Mr. Sun refused to request that Mr. Jia call the ECO to 
arrange a meeting in Hong Kong.  ECO surmises that Mr. Jia works for 
Zhenshangyou Technology Company, listed as the foreign purchaser on 
licensing information provided by OEA.  Consistent with standard ECO 
practice, no calls were made directly to mainland China to attempt 
to arrange a meeting with Mr. Jia. 
 
¶6.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Top Faith 
Logistics Ltd. was registered in May 2006 and its registered office 
is located at the Wang Kwong Industrial Building address noted 
above. Top Faith's director is listed as Sun, Hai Feng and its paid 
up share capital is listed as the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 1250. 
Mr. Sun also appears to be the director of Hong Kong registered 
company Shenzhen Weikang Electronic Co. Limited.  A Shenzhen mirror 
company (Weikang Electronic Co. Limited) appears to produce printed 
circuit boards (www.wkpcba.com.cn). 
 
¶7.  Based on the information detailed herein, ECO believes Jiatong 
University in Hong Kong is not the ultimate consignee or end user 
for this item. ECO recommends a close review of all shipments to the 
Wang Kwong Industrial Building address noted above as well as any 
shipments to Top Faith Logistics Limited and Shenzhen Weikang 
Electronic Co. Limited.
