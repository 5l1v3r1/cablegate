¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  An oil-revenue windfall will more than cancel 
out mismanagement of budget expenditures in early 2008 and leave the 
GoSS with a significant fiscal surplus, according to the south Sudan 
World Bank manager.  By year's end the government may have set aside 
as much as $500 million in reserve.  Although GoSS revenues may be 
even greater in 2009, decreasing long-term oil production and 
prices, and continued inability to exercise expenditure-side 
discipline could lead to longer-term problems.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GoSS Reaps Revenue Windfall 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶2.  (SBU) Despite seriously overshooting its expenditure targets in 
the first half of the year (reftel), the Government of South Sudan 
is poised to achieve a significant budget surplus in 2008, according 
to South Sudan World bank manager Lawrence Clarke.  On October 2, 
Clark told the U.S. trade delegation visiting Juba that the GoSS is 
benefiting from an oil-revenue windfall.  Clarke estimates that the 
GoSS will reap $2.6 billion this year in oil revenues under the 
wealth-sharing provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. 
(Note:  Under the CPA, revenues from oil produced in south Sudan are 
divided equally between the Government of National Unity in Khartoum 
and the GoSS.  End Note.) 
 
Saving for a Rainy Day

¶3.  (SBU) Clarke said that the GoSS Ministry of Finance plans to 
deposit a significant portion of these funds in its reserve account. 
 Currently, there is $300 million in the Reserve Account.  Clarke 
expects this to grow to $500 million by year's end.  (Note:  The 
GoSS drew down the Reserve Account to almost zero in 2007, in order 
to cover an exploding fiscal deficit and end the year with a 
balanced budget.  End Note.)  The GoSS plans to hold this money in 
reserve as insurance against a possible rupture with the GNU 
resulting from an ICC indictment of President Al Bashir. 
 
Trouble on the Expenditure Side 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶4.  (SBU) Responding to a question, Clarke acknowledged that in the 
first half of the year, the GoSS had once more seriously overspent 
its budget targets, with some Ministries using up almost their 
entire budget allocations for the entire year.  This was especially 
true of the SPLA.  Clarke attributed this to the very large 
proportion of the GoSS budget devoted to salaries and its policy of 
"social employment."  The GoSS remains committed to providing 
salaries to SPLA veterans of the civil war and their dependents, 
until alternative means of employment can be developed.  Clarke 
expects the GoSS to introduce a budget supplemental in the near 
future to cover the additional spending. 
 
Clouds on the Long-Term Horizon 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶5.  (SBU) Clarke foresaw potential problems in outlying years. 
Sudan's oil production is beginning to slow and world oil prices 
could begin to decline.  Still, Clarke said, a 2009 revenue increase 
of 30 percent remains a not-impossible best-case-scenario.  The GoSS 
is currently evaluating potential spending alternatives should the 
additional revenues actually be forthcoming.  He also spoke highly 
of GoSS' budget preparation, saying that it is improving year by 
year. 
 
"Poised for a Takeoff" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶6.  (SBU) More broadly, Clarke was extremely upbeat about south 
Sudan's economic progress and potential.  He described the South as 
"on the right track" and "poised for a takeoff."  He compared south 
Sudan to Botswana when he served there in the early 1990's, and 
believes that it has the potential for similar economic progress in 
the coming 15 years. 
 
Comment 
- - - - 
¶7.  (SBU) The GoSS revenue windfall and its ability to sock away 
significant amounts for a rainy day is good news.  However, the 
government's seeming inability to control the spending side of 
budget implementation, the continued high proportion of funds going 
to pay salaries, and its almost total dependence on oil as a revenue 
source could spell serious trouble if revenues fall off in the 
future.  The political unknowns (which would cause a dramatic 
decline in revenue) are whether the GNU will hold together through 
2011, can the SPLM and NCP negotiate a post-2011 revenue sharing 
plan (assuming separation) that will allow the South to transport 
its oil through the North, and can the South continue to maintain

internal stability.  The possibility of political ruptures in the 
GNU, an early unilateral declaration of independence without a plan 
for revenue sharing, or instability in the South are all good 
reasons for the GOSS to set aside a sizable reserve during the final 
three years of the CPA.
