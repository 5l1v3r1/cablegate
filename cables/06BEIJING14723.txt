LAUNCHES, CHINA-RUSSIA UNSC RESOLUTION, G-8 OUTREACH 
MEETING 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  Key points made at the July 13 MFA press briefing 
are as follows: 
 
-- On DPRK, China's response is governed by three 
objectives: to reduce tension and maintain peace and 
stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia, 
to promote the solidarity of the UNSC and to encourage 
prompt resumption of the Six-Party Talks. 
 
-- The China-Russia jointly-sponsored draft UNSC 
resolution is conducive to the three objectives but 
the Japanese-sponsored draft is not.  China hopes that 
the UNSC can reach consensus on its draft. 
 
-- Vice Premier Hui Liangyu and Vice Foreign Minister 
Wu Dawei are currently in Pyongyang and will return to 
China as scheduled on July 15.  Discussions between 
China and the DPRK, both in Beijing and Pyongyang are 
still on-going. 
 
-- China has not been involved in discussions 
concerning five-nation talks which would exclude the 
DPRK. 
 
-- The package plan that the EU's Javier Solana 
presented to Iran in June is an important effort. 
China hopes Iran will have an appropriate and 
constructive response to this plan that will lead to 
the early resumption of talks. 
 
-- China and the United States will meet on the side- 
lines of the G-8 Outreach meeting in St. Petersburg. 
 
-- China is firm that the next UN Secretary General be 
from Asia. 
 
-- China believes the United States should handle the 
prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay in line with 
international law. 
 
-- The Chinese MFA regular press briefings will be 
suspended for the summer and resume September 5.

DPRK Missile Launches 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  During the regular July 13 press briefing, Foreign 
Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu answered questions 
about China's response to the DPRK's July 4/5 missile 
launches.  Questions focused on the China-Russia draft 
UNSC resolution, A/S Hill's comments concerning the 
lack of cooperation from the DPRK, China's current 
negotiation efforts in Beijing and Pyongyang and the 
possibility of resuming Six-Party Talks. 
 
¶3.  In response, Jiang repeatedly referred to China's 
three objectives: to reduce tension and maintain peace 
and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast 
Asia, to promote the solidarity of the UNSC and to 
encourage prompt resumption of the Six-Party Talks. 
Jiang would not comment on A/S Hill's comments 
concerning lack of progress in his discussions with 
DPRK, instead focusing on the fact that Chinese 
negotiation efforts in Pyongyang and Beijing are still 
ongoing.  The spokesperson would not speculate on the 
time frame for possible resumption of Six-Party Talks, 
responding instead that a few visits and the efforts 
of China alone are not enough; joint efforts of all 
parties are required. 
 
¶4.  In response to a question, Jiang said she had not 
heard any discussions about five-nation talks that 
would exclude the DPRK.  The Six-Party Talks is an 
effective and pragmatic vehicle through which to 
denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and China remains 
committed to this process. 
 
¶5.  When asked why China had originally opposed any 
action in the UNSC but was now putting forth its own 
 
BEIJING 00014723  002 OF 002 
 
 
draft resolution, Jiang responded that the China- 
Russia draft resolution presents China and Russia's 
constructive ideas.  The Japanese-sponsored draft 
resolution is not conducive to obtaining the three 
objectives. The UNSC should give a prudent and well- 
measured response to the situation.  China hopes that 
with its draft resolution, the UNSC can reach 
consensus on an appropriate response. 
 
¶6.  Responding to a question about China's next step, 
Jiang replied that discussions between China and the 
DPRK, both in Beijing and Pyongyang, are still on- 
going.  Vice Premier Hui Liangyu and Vice Foreign 
Minister Wu Dawei are currently in Pyongyang and will 
return to China as scheduled on July 15.  VFM Wu Dawei 
met with Kim Kye-Gwan, DPRK Six-Party Talk negotiator. 
 
¶7.  A reporter stated that it appeared the United 
States believes negotiation with the DPRK is hopeless, 
but China appears to have greater hope in its own 
negotiations with the DPRK.  Jiang replied that both 
China and the United States stand for peaceful 
resolution and early resumption of the Six-Party 
Talks. 
 
Iran 
----- 
 
¶8.  Dodging a reference to China's about face on the 
question of UNSC action against Iran, Jiang stated the 
package plan that the EU's Javier Solana presented to 
Iran in June is an important effort.  China hopes Iran 
will have an appropriate and constructive response to 
this plan that will lead to the early resumption of 
talks. 
 
G-8 
---- 
 
¶9.  Responding to a question about China's 
participation at the G-8 Outreach Meeting in St. 
Petersburg July 16-17, Jiang stated that although the 
DPRK is not on the agenda, the issue would likely be 
discussed on the sidelines and at the more informal 
sessions.  She stated that China and the United States 
will meet on the sidelines to discuss issues of mutual 
interest.  Regarding China's prospects for membership 
in the G-8, she said China is still a developing 
country and in interested in strengthening contact and 
dialogue with the G-8. 
 
UN Secretary General from Asia 
------------------------------- 
 
¶10. China is firm that the next UN Secretary General 
be from Asia. 
 
Prisoners in Guantanamo 
------------------------ 
 
¶11.  In response to a question about a recent report 
about prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, Jiang said China 
took note of the report and attaches importance to the 
Geneva Convention.  China believes the United States 
should also attach importance to it and handle the 
prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay in line with 
international law. 
 
Suspension of Regular Press Briefings 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  Due to the summer holidays, the regular Tuesday
