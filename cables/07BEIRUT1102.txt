SUBJECT: LEBANON: POST APPROVES SECTION 1206 PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 84130 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman; Reason: Section 1.4(b) 
 
(S)  Chief of Mission fully supports the FY08 Section 1206 
proposals as submitted by USCENTCOM.  These two proposals, 
which address special forces capability and border security, 
reinforce the mission's strategic goals of counterterrorism 
cooperation and military-to-military engagement with Lebanon. 
 The border security component provides the U.S. an 
opportunity to materially support Lebanon's efforts to 
counter cross-border movement of terrorist resources and 
personnel.  The special forces component enhances a growing 
Lebanese capacity proven so crucial in the recent counter 
terrorism operations in the Nahr al-Bahrid camp.
