¶1. (U) Ref A reported that Embassy Wellington had asked NZ 
officials whether New Zealand would participate in the 
signing of the Iraq Compact.  On May 1, Darryl Dunn, Director 
of the Mideast Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade, told Pol-Econ Couns that PM Clark has approved New 
Zealand support for the Iraq Compact.  The NZ Ambassador in 
Cairo, Rene Wilson, will sign (or signal support in whatever 
way is preferred) at the May 3 Compact meeting in Sharm 
el-Sheikh. 
 
¶2. (U) Ref B reported that the GNZ was considering increasing 
financial assistance to Iraqi refugees.  On April 30, Foreign 
Minister Peters announced that New Zealand will give NZD 
million (about USD 750k) to the UN refugee agency UNHCR to 
assist Iraqis displaced within Iraq as well as those who have 
fled to neighboring countries.  Post has sent the complete 
text of Peters' statement to EAP/ANP's Kelly McKellogg and 
Tom Vajda.
