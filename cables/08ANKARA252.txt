¶1. (SBU) During a January 22 meeting, Embassy Athens Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA) Representative Daniel Furlong and 
Turkish Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGCA) Deputy 
Director General for Security Haydar Yalcin discussed various 
training programs previously requested by the DGCA from TSA.  Yalcin 
said that the 2006 ICAO Universal Security Audit Program (USAP) 
initial assessment and the 2007 ICAO USAP follow-up visit identified 
the development of a screener certification standard as an open item 
requiring corrective action.  Yalcin's office must develop an Action 
Plan to respond to the ICAO report and would like to include a 
statement that TSA is providing assistance in this area.  To help 
develop Turkey's screener certification standard, Yalcin asked if it 
would be possible for DGCA to review TSA's screener certification 
standard.  Furlong explained that this document could only be 
released with the permission of TSA Administrator Kip Hawley. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The DGCA also requested assistance from TSA on the 
following subjects: 
 -- Crisis Management Program Development 
 -- Passenger Screening Technologies Data (Millimeter Wave) 
 -- Passenger Screening Protocol (TSA SOP) 
 -- Hold Baggage Screening Protocol (TSA SOP) 
 -- Passenger Screening Checkpoint Equipment Daily Operational Test 
Calibration Standard and Methodology 
 -- Screener Certification Standard and Methodology 
 
¶3. (SBU) At Yalcin's request, we are submitting DGCA's request to 
review TSA's screener certification standard to TSA headquarters for 
consideration.
