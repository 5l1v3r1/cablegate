¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On 23 December 2007, members of the Electoral 
Donor Group (EDG) met with UN SRSG Ashraf Qazi to share concerns 
regarding Sudan's preparation for the 2009 elections.  The EDG is 
worried that because the GNU has not passed the electoral law nor 
established a National Electoral Commission (NEC), the CPA-mandated 
timeline for the elections will either not be met or will be rushed. 
 The SRSG recognized the group's concerns and said that UNMIS, the 
organization with the official mandate to assist the government in 
carrying out the 2009 elections, will meet regularly with government 
and political party leaders to encourage effective electoral 
preparation.  SRSG Qazi also reassured the group that UNMIS will 
work closely with the donors on election preparation and execution, 
as well as keep it updated on Sudanese electoral developments. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) SRSG Qazi recognized the lengthy delays in preparation of the 
electoral law and appointment of an NEC.  He stated his commitment 
to push the NCP and SPLM leadership to pass the requisite 
legislation that will allow electoral preparation to begin.  Qazi 
noted that elections that do not meet the July 2009 deadline will 
"severely affect" the implementation of the CPA.  Qazi will offer UN 
electoral expertise and donor support through the EDG, though he 
cautioned that he must do this gently, so as not to sour Khartoum on 
working with the international community on elections.  Ray Kennedy, 
UNMIS Chief Electoral Affairs Officer, underscored that, based on 
his experience with other elections, it is important to help Sudan 
"own their process."  Kennedy further stated that UNMIS hoped to 
have a core team in place by March 2008, and that the team would 
likely include more than 200 staff. 
 
¶3. (U) Qazi expressed uncertainty that Khartoum will be willing to 
formalize an UNMIS role on elections and acknowledged Khartoum's 
early reluctance to allow international support for the elections. 
Qazi contrasted Khartoum's attitude toward international support 
with that of the government of Iraq, where he served as SRSG from 
2004-2007.  He said the UN will likely not have the same "active 
role" in helping Sudan prepare for and execute its elections as it 
did in the 2005 Iraqi elections.  Nonetheless, Qazi said UNMIS would 
create a high-level electoral steering committee, composed of donors 
and NEC members that would meet regularly to discuss election 
preparation timelines and activities. 
 
¶4. (U) NOTE: This month, the GNU announced that it will extend its 
parliamentary session through mid-January 2008 in order to review 
and ratify the electoral law.  The next parliamentary session begins 
in April. END NOTE. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: SRSG Qazi appears eager to engage with the NCP and 
SPLM on election issues.  With a mandate to assist with elections, 
UNMIS will play a central role in keeping the GNU partners on track. 
 However, as Qazi articulated, the Sudanese may not be receptive to 
donor assistance.  Though the SPLM has been receptive to assistance 
in the south, UNMIS and other donors such as the Dutch share our 
perception that Khartoum has thus far been reluctant to allow 
international engagement.  In order for donors to provide elections 
assistance, the GNU must formally invite such assistance. SRSG Qazi 
is hoping to persuade Khartoum to do so but may face an uphill 
battle.  The next key milestone will be passage of the elections 
law, hopefully in January.  Following that, the GNU will face 
immediate inquiries from donors on how they may assist the electoral 
commission.
