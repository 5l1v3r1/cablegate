ZAMAN / RADIKAL:        Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir, who attended 
the opening ceremony of an artist's exhibition in an art gallery 
of Diyarbakir, talked with journalists when he was asked about 
his views about ten security personnel who lost their lives in 
the last two days in the operations.  Baydemir reportedly said 
that every life lost was taking away something from the future 
of the peoples and diminishing the human values.  Baydemir

statements of Massoud Barzani, president of the regional 
authority in Iraq, about Diyarbakir and Turkey.

distribution of the pro-Kurdish Ozgur Gundem daily, this time 
11th Heavy Penalty Court issued a 15-day-ban on the daily's 
publication because of the announcements that appeared on the 
daily concerning an event that would be held to mark terrorist 
leader's birthday at the birth place of Abdullah Ocalan. 
Evrensel daily notes that people protested 'silencing of the 
Ozgur Gundem daily' in front of the DTP provincial headquarters
