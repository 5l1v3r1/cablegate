Serbian MFA Human Rights Counselor Marina Ivanovic told us on 
May 22 that the Serbian government did not have any events 
planned to celebrate Cuban Solidarity Day, nor was she aware of 
any planned NGO activities.  Ivanovic said that Serbia was not 
in a position to address such issues while the government was in 
transition and while Serbia's diplomatic activity was focused on 
Kosovo.  In light of the political context, post did not 
organize any events.
