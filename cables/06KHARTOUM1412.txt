SUBJECT:  Sudanese Bar Association Dean Calls for Release 
of Guantanamo Detainee Sami Al-Haj 
 
¶1.  On June 13, Fathi Khalil, Dean of the Sudanese Bar 
Association, renewed his call for the release of 
ASudanese national Sami al-Haj from Guantanamo, where he 
has apparently been held for over four years.  In a 
symposium organized by the Al-Jazeera television channel 
office in Khartoum in cooperation with Al-Sahafa 
newspaper,  Khalil called for compensation for the 
detainees and a disciplinary board for those responsible 
for their being held.  June 13 marked the fourth 
anniversary of al-Haj's detention in Guantanamo. 
 
¶2.  On June 11, the Sudanese bar Association had called 
on the Sudanese government to demand the release of all 
Sudanese detainees in Guantanamo.  It also released a 
press statement questioning the recent deaths of three 
detainees.
