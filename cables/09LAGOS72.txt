said it was partly related to oil prices, but was also part 
of a broader strategic plan by Petrobras to focus it 
resources on oil fields offshore Brazil. 
 
¶5. (C) Ferreira noted that while Petrobras may be interested 
in further Nigerian deep offshore developments, it has no 
plans to move onshore.  When asked about the Nigeria-Sao Tome 
Joint Development Zone (JDZ), he said Petrobras (and other 
major oil companies) did not see commercially attractive 
prospects in the area and his company has no plans to explore 
in those waters.  However, Ferreira related that every year 
the Sao Tome and Principe President makes a plea to Brazilian 
President Luiz Inacio da Silva asking him to push Petrobras 
to invest in the JDZ, these requests usually coming on the 
margins of meetings between the heads of state of Portuguese 
speaking countries.  According to Ferreira, immediately 
afterwards President da Silva contacts the head of Petrobras 
to ask why the company is not doing more in Sao Tome and 
every year the head of Petrobras has to remind da Silva that 
there is not a commercially significant amount of oil in the 
JDZ.  That explanation, Ferreira said, usually ends the 
conversation, at least until the next time the two presidents 
meet. 
 
Petrobras on Chinese and Russian Activity in Nigeria 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶6. (C) Ferreira did not see Chinese oil companies as playing 
a significant role in Nigerian offshore oil field development 
now or in the near future.  However, he did see Chinese as an 
active threat in oil field service industry.  A Petrobras 
subsidiary recently lost a bid to perform seismic survey work 
in Nigeria to a Chinese company.  The Chinese were able to 
significantly underbid the Brazilians by, Ferreira thought, 
bringing cheap Chinese labor to Nigeria and ignoring Nigerian 
local content directives.  Ferreira said Russian companies 
appear particularly interested in the Nigerian natural gas 
sector, but like other oil company contacts who have 
mentioned Russian activity, he was unable to point to any 
specific projects or deals to back up his claim. 
 
Ethanol Export Plan Dead; No Help on Refineries 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7. (C) A 2005 agreement between the GON and Petrobras to 
import ethanol into Nigeria from Brazil has failed.  After 
lengthy delays in starting the project, Petrobras had begun 
loading its first tanker of ethanol in Brazil for export to 
Nigeria when the Nigerians abruptly ordered the shipment 
called off.  According to Ferreira, the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) finally realized it had no 
facilities for storing ethanol, no method for mixing it with 
gasoline, and no plan to distribute pure ethanol or blended 
gasoline throughout the country.  Ferreira does not expect 
the ethanol export plan to be revived.  In an aside, he noted 
that NNPC has repeatedly inquired about the possibility of 
Petrobras building petroleum refineries in Nigeria.  Ferreira 
said his company has absolutely no interest in doing so.
