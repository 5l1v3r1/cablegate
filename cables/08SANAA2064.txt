REF: STATE 133199 
 
¶1. Although Post did not receive an official response to 
reftel invitation, Abdul Hakeem al-Eryani, Director of the 
Office of the Foreign Minister, told Poloff at a December 30 
meeting that the ROYG is considering sending its Permanent 
Representative to the UN to participate.  He was unable to 
confirm participation, however. 
 
¶2.  Given the fact that the meeting is only two weeks away, 
it may be prudent to contact the office of Yemen's Permanent 
Representative to the UN directly to firm up participation.
