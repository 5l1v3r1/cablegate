 ¶1.  (SBU)  In a meeting on November 6 with Acting Assistant 
Secretary of Foreign Affairs for United Nations and Other 
 
SIPDIS 
International Organizations Julius D. Torres, Pol/C presented 
reftels' demarches on country specific human rights 
resolutions at the UNGA Third Committee and on the Cuba 
embargo resolution.  Torres admitted that the GRP's usual 
practice at the UNGA was to vote along with the NAM, but he 
promised to study our talking points and share them with 
colleagues here and in New York.  He said that the Department 
of Foreign Affairs likely would soon initiate a review of 
this long-standing practice, since it seemed less and less 
clear that voting with the NAM was usually in the best 
interests of the Philippines.  Pol/C encouraged a healthy 
discussion on this point and urged that the Philippines -- a 
democratic ally of the U.S. and another supporter of human 
rights worldwide -- never be more than one vote away from the 
U.S. position whenever it could not actually vote with the 
U.S.
