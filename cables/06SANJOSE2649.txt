SUBJECT: COSTA RICAN VIEWS ON ECUADOR WTO CASE ON BANANAS 
 
 
¶1.  Vice Minister for Foreign Trade Amparo Pacheco gave the 
following answers to us when we inquired about whether the GOCR 
planned to join Ecuador's WTO case against the EU on bananas. 
 
¶2.  Question: Will Costa Rica join Ecuador in the arbitration panel 
against the European Union? 
 
Answer: No, Costa Rica has decided to continue negotiating since 
Costa Rica considers that negotiation is the best way to reach the 
necessary agreements to protect the national interests on this 
subject.  Last Friday the Doha Round resumed deliberations, 
precisely in the agricultural field, and tomorrow Thursday, the 
Trade Negotiations Committee will gather, making it  possible to 
re-launch banana negotiations in that context. 
 
¶3.  Question: Could Central American countries joining Ecuador in 
this process against the European Union have any effect on the start 
of the negotiations of an economic association agreement between 
Central America and the European Union? 
 
Answer: There will be Central American countries that will join the 
case and there will be others that will not. Costa Rica will respect 
each country's decision and we know that they will respect ours, 
because what motivates each of us are our specific commercial 
interests and not simply regional solidarity.  Costa Rica has been 
an active and successful country in WTO litigation, but in some 
cases it is not litigation but negotiation that is the best way to 
proceed, and the Costa Rican banana sector and this ministry believe 
that this is the case in this matter.  On the other hand, we are 
aware of statements by European authorities affirming that they 
would not start a negotiation process with a region where there were 
countries that have started an arbitral process against them.
