SUBJECT: COSTA RICA: NICARAGUAN ELECTION CHIEF IN $95K CONTROVERSY 
 
¶1. (U) Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Council president Roberto Rivas 
has caused a stir in Costa Rica for the second time in a month, 
after reports came out on November 26th that he and his family have 
been improperly using duty-free cars with diplomatic license 
plates.  The cars (valued at a combined USD 338,000) are officially 
assigned to the Nicaraguan Embassy, where Rivas' brother Harold 
Rivas is the Ambassador.  Roberto Rivas saved an estimated $95,000 
by importing them duty free.  The Costa Rican MFA confirmed that 
Roberto Rivas and his family are not accredited diplomats in Costa 
Rica, and has said that they will be looking into the matter 
further. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) This comes almost a month after reports surfaced that 
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's children were living in a USD 
4.4 million condominium complex outside of San Jose owned by Rivas. 
Rivas and his family live between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, where 
they own at least one additional piece of property and a private 
plane which Embassy contacts say makes frequent trips into and out 
of the country. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Embassy sources have told us that there might be 
more to come regarding Roberto Rivas and his activities in Costa 
Rica.  The Nicaraguan public servant has amassed quite a collection 
of high-priced toys is a country where his official immigration 
status is that of a visitor.  While he might have hoped to keep a 
low profile in Costa Rica, good investigative journalism has 
brought to light his questionable choice of tenants and probable 
tax-fraud.
