Dear Ambassador Jackie Wolcott, 
 
Please allow me to express my heartiest congratulations on 
your new assumption of the post of Special Envoy for Nuclear 
Nonproliferation. 
 
Thank you very much for informing me of the current state of 
play with regard to the U.S.-Russia Joint Declaration on 
Nuclear Energy and Nonproliferation by your letter dated 25 
March 2008, which I received yesterday from the US Embassy in 
Tokyo. 
 
I fully share your view that the expansion of nuclear energy 
should meet the highest nuclear nonproliferation, safety, and 
security standards, and believe that international 
cooperation in this regard is most valid and useful. 
 
As you may be well informed, Japan as G8 chair has proposed 
launching a G8 initiative which aims at assisting developing 
countries in ensuring 3Ss (nuclear 
nonproliferation/safeguards, safety, and security) at 
Hokkaido Toyako Summit in July this year.  I firmly believe 
that we, as the G8, should send a message to the 
international community that 3Ss should be ensured in the use 
of nuclear power at this time of what is called "Nuclear 
Renaissance," when a growing number of countries worldwide 
have expressed their interest in embarking on nuclear power 
program. 
 
Over the last year I have discussed this proposed initiative 
with your colleagues mainly in the U.S. State Department on 
various occasions, and we appreciate very much valuable 
inputs and comments that the U.S. side has provided for us. 
We are also most grateful that the U.S. delegation clearly 
extended its strong support to the proposed initiative during 
the discussion at the G8 forum.  As there should be a 
follow-up deliberation after the initiative is launched, we 
would like to continue our discussion with the U.S. 
Government on this important issue. 
 
In this regard as well, I hope that we would be able to 
discuss this important issue of 3Ss sometime at an earliest 
opportunity of our mutual convenience either in the States, 
Japan or any other place.  Let us keep in touch on this 
matter. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Yasuyoshi Komizo 
Director, International Nuclear Energy Cooperation Division 
Disarmament, Non-Proliferation and Science Department 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
