REF: VIENNA 562 
 
Â¶1.  Following is the text of the statement by the Austrian 
Presidency on behalf of the European Union on the bombing of 
the Immam Ali-Hadi Mosque in Samarra. 
 
BEGIN TEXT 
 
The European Union condemns the criminal and sacrilegious 
bombing of the Imman Ali-Hadi Mosque in Samarra on 22 
February which has provoked sectarian strife.  It undermines 
peace and stability with the risk of derailing the political 
process in Iraq. 
 
This horrendous attack on one of the holiest Shiite religious 
sites in Iraq, which is not only a place holy to Shiite 
worshippers but part of the national cultural heritage of all 
Iraqis, and the loss of life in the subsequent retaliatory 
events show the urgent need for all communities in Iraq for 
maximum restraint. 
 
The European Union strongly supports calls by Iraqi political 
and religious leaders for restraint and non-retaliation and 
urges Iraq to come together in a spirit of dialogue and 
mutual respect as the indispensable basis for national 
reconciliation.
