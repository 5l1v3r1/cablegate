SUBJECT: AMERICAN INSTITUTE IN TAIWAN REPORTS PEACEFUL 
DEMONSTRATION 
 
 
¶1. (U) On Wednesday 16 March 2005, activist ZHOU Qingjun and 
five followers from his self-proclaimed Republic of China 
Patriotic Alliance staged a brief anti-American protest 
outside the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT-Taipei) 
Consular section.  The demonstrators arrived around 1500 
hours local time, in a brown mini-van adorned with protest 
slogans that read, "Support the Anti-Secession Law". 
Escorted by police, ZHOU then delivered a protest letter to 
an AIT FSN Investigator.  The one-page statement in Chinese 
was address to President Bush and asked for U.S. support to 
aid in a peaceful unification between China and Taiwan.  ZHOU 
and his followers then re-boarded their mini-van and departed 
the area without incident at 1525 hours. 
 
¶2. (U) The protest was not reported in either the local 
newspapers or on television, and AIT's Public Affairs section 
received no media inquiries regarding this event. 
 
¶3. (U) Taiwan National Police Administration (NPA) notified 
the RSO a day in advance about the possibility of ZHOU's 
protest and deployed an additional fifteen uniformed officers 
in front of AIT to maintain order.  Local Guard Force 
personnel were also re-positioned to ensure that Consular 
operations were not disrupted and SDT units were put on 
alert.  No unusual incidents, arrests or injuries were 
reported.
