HUMAN RIGHTS IS EFFECTIVE 
 
REF: STATE 73151 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Phnom Penh office of the UN Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has done a good job of 
monitoring and publicizing human rights abuses in Cambodia. 
Its staff has for the most part been responsible and 
professional.  In a sea of NGO and inter-governmental 
organization offices in Cambodia, the OHCHR is one we often 
turn to when we need to compare notes on a specific human 
rights cases.  For example, embassy officers met recently 
with OHCHR representatives to discuss the backgrounds of the 
various candidates for the Khmer Rouge Tribunal's judges and 
prosecutors.  The OHCHR has also been active in technical 
cooperation focused on legal reform in Cambodia. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  OHCHR's relations with the government have not 
been smooth.  The office has been singled out for criticism 
by the government on a number of occasions.  Most recently, 
Prime Minister Hun Sen lashed out at the UN's Special 
Representative for Human Rights in Cambodia, Yash Ghai, 
accusing him of injecting himself into Cambodia without any 
background.  The Prime Minister dismissed him as a long-term 
tourist, refused to meet him, and called on UN Secretary 
General Kofi Annan to withdraw him.
