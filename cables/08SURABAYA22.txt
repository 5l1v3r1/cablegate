accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Flammable gas leaks in villages surrounding 
the mud flow have led officials to restrict access, but 
residents refuse to leave.  Sidoarjo officials will stop 
providing food assistance to recently displaced villagers due to 
budgetary constraints.  Some village officials are skimming 
money off compensation payments. Local police have arrested four 
suspected of stealing pipeline sections from the mud management 
agency.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Reports of leaking flammable hydrogen sulfide gas and 
new geysers in villages surrounding the mud flow epicenter (ref 
a) have raised concerns about the danger posed to local 
residents.  According to February 15 press reports, at the 
request of the deputy regent of Sidoarjo, local police erected 
"police lines" around several areas of West Siring and Jatirejo 
to prevent people from entering. Handoko Teguh, an engineer for 
the Sidoarjo Mud Management Agency (BPLS), confirmed to ConGen 
Surabaya that police lines had been established but stressed 
that BPLS was still awaiting the results of a Geology Board 
investigation into the danger posed to residents.  Residents 
have thus far refused to evacuate. 
 
COMPENSATION 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (U)   The Sidoarjo Department of Social Welfare will soon 
stop food assistance to residents of Besuki village, who were 
displaced by recent dam breaches (ref a).   The villagers are 
currently living under the former toll road.  According to press 
reports, the Sidoarjo government does not have sufficient funds 
to continue providing food for those displaced by the mud. 
Under emergency response procedures, the regency provides three 
days of food.  The Besuki villagers have received six days of 
food assistance. 
 
¶4. (U) According to press reports, village officials have been 
taking a cut from funds distributed by President Yudhoyono to 
villagers displaced by the mud flow disaster.  Each family was 
eligible to receive Rp 370,000 (USD 41), but in fact received Rp 
340,000 (USD 37.50). Officials argued that the Rp 40,000 (USD 
4.00) difference was used for administrative purposes only, not 
to line the pockets of local officials.  The head of the 
Renokenongo village told reporters that officials involved in 
the scheme would repay the difference to villagers. 
 
STEALING PIPE 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to press reports, the Sidoarjo police 
arrested four suspects for the recent theft of 40 meters of 
pipeline used to channel mud to the Porong River.  Handoko told 
ConGen Surabaya that the stolen pipeline was actually a section 
of pipe installed by the previous mud management agency (TIMNAS) 
and not currently active.  Previously, TIMNAS planned to channel 
mud directly to the sea, but the pipelines had never been used. 
The suspects had stolen pipeline sections on at least three 
previous occasions.
