SUBJECT: SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY FOR AUGUST 03, 2006 
 
This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for August 03, 
Â¶2006.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
BOLGE:  Eric Green, the new U.S. Consul in Adana, paid a 
visit to the Mayor of Adana to introduce himself.  Mr. Green 
apologized for his visit being delayed because of the evacuation 
process of the U.S. citizens and families from Lebanon.  Mr. 
Green extended deepest thanks to the mayor in response to 
Adana's help during the humanitarian process which "reinforced 
friendship between Turkey and the U.S." 
 
BOLGE / EVRENSEL:       The dailies point out the continuing military 
deployments of Turkey in the border area, and report at the same 
time the ongoing meetings between Turkey, U.S. and Iraq on how 
to dissolve the PKK in northern Iraq.  Bolge daily notes that 
the so-called flag of the PKK and KDP (Kurdistan Democratic 
Party) were still on a mast side by side in Kirkuk. 
 
CUMHURIYET / RADIKAL / EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM / SABAH: The 
dailies report that Necirvan Barzani, head of the regional 
authority in northern Iraq, allegedly cautioned Murat Karayilan, 
a senior PKK leader, during a meeting in Arbil last week, not to 
use his territory as a base for assaults against Turkey.  Sabah 
daily reports that, when Karayilan responded negatively, Barzani 
closed all PKK offices in the region.  Sabah and Ozgur Gundem 
dailies cite State Department Spokesperson McCormack as saying 
that everybody was working to resolve the issue about PKK's 
presence in the northern Iraq in order to prevent a possible 
Turkish incursion there. 
 
HURRIYET:       The daily reports the allegations that Karayilan 
would be handed over to Turkey. Kurdistan Democratic Party's 
(KDP) official reportedly came to Turkey to discuss that issue. 
However, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed such 
allegations and said that KDP official were paying visits to 
Turkey for other reasons. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Yesterday morning numerous military units and 
vehicles were transferred via Sirnak's Cizre district to the 
border area.  New tanks have also reportedly been deployed in 
the Cizre's Tank Battalion. 
 
EVRENSEL / RADIKAL:     Explosive placed on a railroad in 
Erzincan's Ilici district has been detonated as a cargo train 
was passing.  Material damage has been reported on one of the 
cars. 
 
SABAH:  Five PKK terrorists have surrendered to the security 
officers with their arms in Sirnak on August 1, announced Sirnak 
Governor's Office. 
 
HURRIYET:       Van Prosecutor Sezgin Kanmaz appealed the court 
verdict concerning the Semdinli case in favor of the defendants. 
 Two non-commissioned officers were sentenced to 39 years in 
prison (see press summary 06/21).  The prosecutor claimed that 
the investigation process was incomplete and defendants did not 
satisfactorily have an opportunity to defend themselves. 
 
 
EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:        Members of the Initiative for 
Hasankeyf's Survival requested an appointment with PM Erdogan 
ahead of the August 5 ground breaking ceremony of the Ilisu Dam 
Project which will submerge historic Hasankeyf (in Batman) under 
dam waters.  Meanwhile, a tent will be set up in Hasankeyf and 
people against the dam project will be on duty all through the 
night tomorrow. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The daily dubbed it "a suicide in the name of 
honor" when a young man in Diyarbakir shot himself in the 
forehead when his wife gave birth to a child two months after 
their religious marriage. (Note:Religious marriage is a 
phenomenon not legally recognized in Turkey, but it is a common 
practice in many parts of the country. End Note.) 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   A court of first instance ordered a 15,000 YTL 
fine on a local weekly newspaper called Araratin Sesi (Voice of 
Ararat) in Agri's Dogubeyazit district for two separate reports, 
namely, one about the anniversary of PKK's foundation and the 
other about a signature campaign in support for Abdullah Ocalan.
