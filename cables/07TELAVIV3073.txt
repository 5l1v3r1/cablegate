SUBJECT: GOI ADDRESSES CRITICAL GAZA SEWAGE ISSUE 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Embassy and USAID officers have engaged 
GOI authorities to press for entry of pipes, pumps and other 
equipment for an emergency World Bank project to address the 
high risk of an environmental and public health crisis from a 
Gaza sewage reservoir, but the Israeli response has been slow 
-- especially given Gaza's new status as a "hostile 
territory."  World Bank President Zoellick has written to 
Foreign Minister Livni and Defense Minister Barak trying to 
assure access for the needed materials.  GOI has now 
permitted access to Gaza for nearly all needed project 
materials.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On advice from World Bank regional staff, on October 
10 World Bank President Robert Zoellick sent letters with 
personal notes to GOI Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and GOI 
Defense Minister Ehud Barak, asking for their assistance in 
gaining access to Gaza for the equipment needed to implement 
a World Bank emergency project to relieve pressure on Gaza,s 
Beit Lahiya sewage reservoir (a 97 acre lake (about 3 million 
cubic meters) of mostly untreated effluent from northern 
Gaza).  Oded Herman, Senior Advisor to MOD Pol-Mil Director 
Amos Gilid, told Emboffs and USAID on October 12 that he is 
willing to shorten the usual bureaucratic approval process to 
permit equipment to cross into Gaza.  (Note: Israel's MOD 
controls all materials entering Gaza.)  He requires a 
complete listing of all materials, a detailed project 
description, and further meetings to obtain transit permits. 
In parallel, he will work with World Bank and other parties 
to move the World Bank long term remediation project forward 
in the usual channels. 
 
¶3. (SBU) At a meeting on October 18 with USAID, Embassy, GOI 
MFA and World Bank officers, Oded Herman reported that nearly 
all materials for the World Bank short term project have been 
moved into Gaza, and Bank Deputy Country Director Hadad 
concurred and thanked the GOI for its action.  He cautioned, 
however, that access for supplies will continue to be a 
concern as the long term sewage project moves forward.  After 
discussion of the risks and alternatives, consensus at the 
meeting was that a USAID project remains necessary to provide 
a margin of safety during the rainy season about to begin. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A World Bank long term solution for new sewage 
treatment capacity in Gaza, at a cost of 45 million euros 
(USD 60 million) has been funded, but will take years to 
implement.  In the interim, the Bank plans to finish nine new 
interim infiltration basins over the next several months.  In 
support of the Bank project, USAID is considering funding an 
interim 2.4 hectare sewage basin with submersible pumps and 
piping to transfer sludge between the sewage basins.  Once 
approved, the USAID project may take up to two months to 
accomplish.  Meeting that timeframe depends on importing the 
necessary equipment into Gaza. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The Beit Lahiya sewage crisis comes at an 
inopportune time, when the GOI is trying to deny Hamas 
resources to deliver services to Gaza residents in hopes of 
turning their allegiance away from that faction.  Unlike, 
electricity or water, however, the deprivation of sanitation 
treatment capability in Gaza could seriously impact Israel 
too, and lead to pollution of the Mediterranean and public 
health problems that recognize no border.  GOI Environment 
Ministry noted to EST office that Israel's sewage treatment 
system receives effluent from PA areas, and improving PA 
capability has to be seen in the larger regional scope.
