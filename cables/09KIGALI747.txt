SUBJECT: GOR RELEASES 2009-2012 AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT PLAN 
 
¶1. (U) The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) on November 13 
provided a copy of its 2009-2012 investment plan to post. The 
investment plan is the financing component of MINAGRI's 
second overall Strategic Plan for the Transformation of 
Agriculture (PSTA II). The PSTA II implements Rwanda's 
Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program 
compact (CAADP). (Note: CAADP is a country led program under 
the African Union/New Partnership for African Development. 
End note.) The PSTA II has four programs: (i) intensification 
and development of sustainable production systems; (ii) 
support to the professionalization of producers; (iii) 
promotion of commodity chains and agribusiness development; 
and (iv) institutional development. The total value of the 
investment plan is $848 million, while the estimated 
contribution so far from GOR, the private sector, and donors 
represents only 48 percent of the total need. 
 
¶2. (U) The investment plan identifies overall investment gaps 
at the program level for GOR fiscal years 2009-2012: 
Program 1- Total Cost: $658.5 million, Total Gap: 
$331.8 million 
           Program 2- Total Cost: $42 million, Total Gap: 
$15.5 million 
           Program 3- Total Cost: $128 million, Total Gap 
$88.5 million 
           Program 4- Total Cost: $19.5 million, Total Gap: 
$6 million 
 
¶3. (U) The investment plan also identifies sub-programs that 
are deemed "absolute priorities for the Ministry of 
Agriculture." They are: Sustainable Management of Natural 
Resources and Water and Soil Preservation; Food Security and 
Vulnerability Management; Research for Transforming 
Agriculture; Strengthening Rural Financial System; 
Institutional Development. Where budget support is not an 
option MINAGRI has asked donors contribute to a "basket fund" 
in order to reduce transaction costs. 
 
¶4. (U) Comment: Post will provide additional reporting on 
specific aspects of this plan and food security issues in 
Rwanda. End Comment.
