SUBJECT: PAKISTANIS ENTER KUNAR PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN, TO 
ESCAPE MILITARY ACTION IN PAKISTAN 
 
1.(SBU) SUMMARY.  Pakistanis from the Bajaur area have 
entered Kunar Province in Afghanistan to escape military 
action in Pakistan.  The reported number moving across the 
border varies from 1,200-5,000, but actual figures are still 
to be confirmed.  Forward Operating Base Joyce, international 
organizations, including the United Nations High Commission 
for Refugees (UNHCR) implementing partners and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and Afghan 
provincial authorities are monitoring the situation and 
attempting to assess the number of people affected.  The area 
is remote and largely inaccessible and most Pakistanis remain 
deep in the valley.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.(SBU) With increased military action ongoing in Pakistan 
along the Afghanistan/Pakistan border, Pakistani families are 
moving to safety into Shaigal and Dangam Districts in the Bar 
Sholtan and Lar Sholtan Valleys of Kunar Province.  On 
October 17, a combined team from FOB Joyce met under the 
direction of the Shaigal District Sub Governor, Mohd Zahir 
Safi, and went into Sholtan Valley to assess the situation. 
The refugees estimate that 1,000 families crossed the border 
and are living with Afghan relatives.  A small number came 
down with the elders to meet with ANSF and coalition members 
and receive humanitarian assistance (HA) at the ICRC in Bar 
Sholtan.  The team provided limited quantities of blankets, 
shoes, food, and personal care items.  The District Sub 
Governor asked that HA not be dropped via CDS saying "the 
powerful will take it all and it will not go to those who 
need it." 
 
¶3. (SBU) In an October 19 conversation, Sardar Khan of the 
Department of Refugees and Repatriation informed us that 
Afghan provincial authorities assigned an emergency 
commission to survey the families and determine their needs. 
The commission includes representatives from the Afghan Red 
Crescent Society, the Department of Rural Rehabilitation and 
Development, the Department of Refugees and Repatriation, the 
Department of Public Health, the district governor, and UNHCR 
implementing partners.  The survey was projected to be 
completed on October 22, but it is still ongoing because most 
of the areas are inaccessible due to insecurity. 
Distribution of non-food items continues through the 
emergency commission. 
 
¶4. (U) In the meantime, Task Force Chosin in eastern and 
northern Kunar has distributed basic foodstuffs, such as 
rice, beans, oil, blankets, and tents.  Task Force Mountain 
Warrior purchased and delivered medicine for 1,2000 people 
per a request from a private doctor.  The ANA and ANP are 
distributing the HA to put an Afghan face on the 
distribution.  Task Force Chosin reported strong cooperation 
and leadership by the ANA and ANP in responding to the 
situation. 
 
¶5. (U) UNHCR and ICRC note that, in general, displacement 
across the border into Afghanistan has been temporary. 
Embassy Kabul Refugee Coordinator and Border Coordinator will 
continue to monitor the situation through their contacts in 
the field and in coordination with Embassy Islamabad.
