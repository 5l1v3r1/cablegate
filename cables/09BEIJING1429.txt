SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) China "resolutely opposed" the latest North Korean 
nuclear test and wanted to work with the international 
community to push North Korea back to the Six Party Talks 
said 
National People's Congress Vice Chairman Lu Yongxiang in a 
meeting with Senator John Kerry on May 26.  On climate 
change, 
Lu pushed for "common but differentiated responsibilities" 
and 
stated that only reductions in per capita emissions would be 
possible.  Senator Kerry pushed back, arguing that the 
critical figure in reducing greenhouse gases was each 
country's total, not per capita, output of green house gases 
into the atmosphere and that China needed to take 
"measurable, 
verifiable and reportable" steps to combat climate change. 
Lu 
also lauded U.S.-China bilateral relations as "the most 
important in the world" and encouraged Senator Kerry not to 
support protectionism.

DPRK Nuclear Test 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) China "resolutely opposed the North Korean nuclear 
test" and "firmly supported the peace and stability of the 
North East Asia region" said National People's Congress Vice 
Chairman Lu Yongxiang in a meeting with Senator John Kerry on 
May 26.  Lu referred to the May 25 Foreign Ministry Statement 
which he said made clear China's "resolute opposition" to the 
test.  China encouraged North Korea to work with the 
international community to avoid a worsening of the 
situation, 
said Lu.  North Korea must also "abide by its commitments" 
and 
the international community should work together to push 
North 
Korea back to the Six-Party Talks.  Lu noted that the issue 
was more pressing for China than the United States because 
China was a neighbor of North Korea. 
 
China's Efforts to Combat Climate Change 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Climate Change was a global issue that demanded a 
global response and China had begun efforts to reduce 
emissions, said Lu.  The National People's Congress had 
revised laws to punish polluters and the Chinese government 
had taken measures to shut down high polluting small and 
medium sized enterprises.  Lu also said that emissions 
reduction would be a "primary goal" of China's coming five 
year plan and China would aim to reduce per capita emissions

compared to the last five years. 
 
International and Bilateral Cooperation on Climate Change 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) There were great differences between the per capita 
emissions of China -- the world's largest developing country - 
- and the United States -- the world's largest developed 
country, said Lu.  However, all countries should work 
together 
to reduce emissions based on the principle of "common but 
differentiated responsibilities" and should follow 
international agreements on climate change.  Lu noted new 
U.S. 
policies to tackle climate change and asked the United States 
to provide technological support to China to reduce 
emissions. 
China was also ready to "make efforts to ensure that the 
upcoming climate change meeting in Copenhagen was a success," 
said Lu. In response, Senator Kerry told Lu that science had 
shown that the critical factor for climate change was the 
total amount of green house gasses released and not per 
capita 
emissions.  Senator Kerry emphasized that China was the 
number 
one emitter of greenhouse gasses followed by the United 
States.  Steps taken in the United States to reduce emissions 
would be completely undone if countries like China, India and 
Russia continued with their old practices, said Senator 
Kerry. 
The Copenhagen talks would fail unless China was willing to 
take "measurable, verifiable and reportable" steps to reduce 
total emissions. 
 
Lu Responds 
----------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Lu thanked Senator Kerry "for his candidness," but 
said that the emissions issue was not just an issue of 
science 
but also an economic and political one.  The international 
community should take fairness into consideration when 
discussing responsibility for emissions, he added.  China's 
per capita GDP was 1/5 to 1/6 of the United States and the 
U.S. economy was structured differently than China's, noted 
Lu.  85 percent of the U.S. economy was in the service sector 
while manufacturing of goods for the U.S. market had moved to 
China.  Lu warned that in the next 10-15 years a total 
reduction in Chinese green house emissions would be very 
difficult to achieve but a per capita reduction would be an 
achievable goal. China and the United States should proceed 
from a long-term and strategic perspective to work together 
to 
reduce emissions, he suggested. 
 
Bilateral Relations 
------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The U.S.-China relationship was "the most important 
bilateral relationship in the world," said Lu.  Lu praised 
bilateral cooperation on regional and international issues 
and 
said that economic cooperation and trade were "mutually 
beneficial."  While there had been "small amounts of trade 
friction," the momentum of the trading relationship was 
"unstoppable."  Lu said that he was happy to see an increased 
congressional interest in China recently, but noted that 
there 
were "some negative voices in the U.S. Congress" regarding 
China.  Both China and the United States should "join hands" 
to resist trade protectionism.  Trade protectionism would 
"not 
be beneficial to the U.S. recovery" from the financial 
crisis. 
Lu encouraged Senator Kerry to resist supporting 
protectionist 
bills.
