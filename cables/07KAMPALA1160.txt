¶2.  (SBU) The negotiators are in recess until next month while the 
Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) consult 
with stakeholders. Minister of Internal Affairs, Ruhakana Rugunda, 
publicly invited the LRA to join in on the consultations with 
stakeholders in northern Uganda. The GOU also plans to bring 
together Uganda's top lawyers to devise a concrete mechanism that 
addresses the needs for justice, accountability, and reconciliation. 
At the GOU's request, the USG and other donors are looking for ways 
to support the consultation process. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) USG Activities: Ambassador Browning and USAID Director 
Margot Ellis traveled with a Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
staffer and an Armed Services Committee staffer to northern Uganda 
from July 4-6. During the visit, the staffers examined bilateral and 
military relations, the peace process, health and development 
issues, President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR), 
counterterrorism and special operations efforts, and the 
establishment of the Africa Command (AFRICOM).  On June 19, USAID 
released a draft Statement of Work (SOW) titled, "Stability, Peace, 
and Reconciliation in Northern uGanda (SPRING). The issuance of the 
draft SOW was designed to get comments and suggestions from firms, 
organizations, experts in the subject matter, and other interested 
parties. SPRING's objective is to reduce current conflict, prevent 
the escalation of social, economic and political tensions and 
strengthen institutions for the promotion of peace and 
reconciliation. SPRING will support a set of activities in three 
basic areas: (1) Peace-building and reconciliation; (2) Economic 
security and social inclusion; and (3) Access to justice. The 
deadline for submission of written comments is July 13, 2007.

¶4.  (SBU) USG Activities:  CJTF HOA has received approval to build 
and repair several secondary schools in Pader, Lira, and Kitgum 
districts and a pediatric ward at Kitgum District Referral Hospital. 
Since October 2006, CJTF HOA has repaired 25 boreholes and is in the 
process of drilling an estimated 50 new ones. "Seabees", the CJTF 
HOA Naval Construction unit, conducted a pre-deployment site survey 
of Aromo bridge and culvert in Lira district. Their mission is to 
prevent conflict, promote stability and protect coalition within 
those three districts. They are successfully performing with 
borehole repairs, new borehole drilling, and construction and 
rehabilitation of schools and clinics. They hope to begin repairing 
the bridge in late September or early October, working with the 
Uganda People's Defense Force and Lira district's engineers. The 
project remains on schedule. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Other:  The latest monthly meeting of the Government of 
Uganda's Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) for the Emergency 
Humanitarian Action Plan for LRA-affected areas was held on June 29. 
The JMC continues to enhance accountability and communications 
between the central government, local authorities, and development 
partners. The JMC has been extended for an additional three months 
until end- September. During the extension, the primary focus will 
be on strengthened security through the continued deployment of 
police, and security and emergency roads. It was noted that even 
after JMC ends, the needs for humanitarian assistance will continue. 
Also, an alternative monitoring mechanism will be put in place for 
the Peace, Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) to deal with 
humanitarian, transition, recovery and development efforts in 
northern Uganda.

¶6.  (SBU) USG Activities: A community policing and integrated 
 
KAMPALA 00001160  002 OF 002 
 
 
administration of justice pilot project funded by USAID and 
State/INL is starting up in Lira district. Trainers from the 
Department of Justice International Criminal Investigative Training 
Assistance Program (ICITAP) note that police and other justice, law 
and order institutions in northern Uganda are facing difficulties 
due to the lack of essential supplies and equipment in the offices 
and courts. The absence of computers and communications hinders the 
ability of the police to re-establish a functioning civilian police 
system. They also lack transportation for both officers and 
investigators. There are only two motorcycles and one vehicle 
provided for the entire Lira district. The conditions of the offices 
are difficult due to water and termite damage. Poor communication 
reduces the ability of the police to respond in a timely manner to 
incidents and is a huge safety issue. On a more positive note, a 
conference of local residents was held to discuss the community 
justice project.

¶7.  (U) Human Rights Watch issued a statement on July 9 welcoming 
the provision for trials in the June 29 agreement between Uganda and 
the LRA, but cautioning that adequate penalties are needed. "If 
national courts handed down a slap-on-the-wrist sentence in the 
event of convictions for the most serious crimes ... such trials 
would be tainted even if they were otherwise fair and credible," 
commented Richard Dicker, International Justice Program Director at 
Human Rights Watch. 
 
¶8.  (U) Human Rights Watch also pointed out that although the 
International Criminal Court favors national trials, "a case can be 
returned to the ICC if it does not meet benchmarks for national 
prosecution."  The ICC issued arrest warrants for LRA leaders for 
crimes against humanity and war crimes in 2005.
