------------------- 
Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  Recent media attention on gaps in the provision of 
health services in Zam Zam internally displaced persons 
(IDP) camp in North Darfur prompted USAID's Darfur Field 
Office (DFO) to verify the reports.  Zam Zam camp had 
been adequately served by three non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) providing health services until mid- 
May 2006 when one NGO left the area.  Contrary to press 
reports, however, health services in Zam Zam continue, 
and no outbreaks or major health problems have emerged. 
In addition, the State Ministry of Health (SMOH) and the 
UN World Health Organization (WHO) are working in 
coordination with health providers in North Darfur toward 
devising a long-term solution to address the needs of Zam 
Zam's population.  At this time, the DFO recommends 
supporting one international NGO to guide and build 
capacity within the two existing national NGOs present in 
Zam Zam.  End summary and comment. 
 
------------------------------ 
Building National NGO Capacity 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  In general, the provision of health services in North 
Darfur is hampered by insecurity, decaying or non- 
existent facilities, a lack of supplies and reliable cold 
chain, an insufficient number of qualified national staff 
wanting to serve in Darfur, and a high staff turnover 
rate. 
 
¶3.  Zam Zam IDP camp, located 16 kilometers south of El 
Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, is a mixed community 
of approximately 32,000 IDPs and host community 
residents.  The Spanish Red Cross (SpRC) serves as camp 
coordinator, and several UN agencies and NGOs provide 
basic services.  The camp is well organized, and despite 
continuing insecurity, NGOs implement a variety of 
programs ranging from health and water and sanitation 
projects to livelihood activities and distribution of 
relief supplies. 
 
¶4.  Until May 2006, Medecins sans Frontieres-Spain (MSF- 
Sp) operated a primary health care clinic in Zam Zam 
camp.  When a survey concluded that conditions in the 
camp no longer met emergency criteria, MSF-Sp moved 
operations south to an underserved area.  Prior to its 
departure, MSF-Sp liaised with the WHO and SMOH to ensure 
the continuation of basic medical services at Zam Zam. 
 
¶5.  Currently, two clinics run by national NGOs are 
operational in Zam Zam camp.  The Sudanese Red Crescent 
Society (SRCS) clinic in Zam Zam can see and treat 250 to 
300 patients per day.  The Sudanese Development 
Organization (SUDO) clinic can see between 200 and 250 
patients per day.  According to the June 14 SMOH weekly 
morbidity and mortality statistical report, 1,162 
patients in Zam Zam camp were treated during the previous 
week.  These figures illustrate that the SRCS and SUDO 
clinics are operating under maximum daily capacity. 
 
¶6.  On June 7, WHO reported that the health situation in 
Zam Zam camp is stable.  In addition, SRCS is providing 
vaccination services in the camp, and SUDO is expanding 
its staff presence in Zam Zam by one medical doctor to be 
supported by Medecins du Monde-Greece (MDM-G).  Likewise, 
efforts are ongoing to build capacity of SRCS and SUDO to 
provide nutrition services in Zam Zam, such as the three- 
day workshop on supplementary feeding and nutritional 
surveillance conducted by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) 
and SMOH in late May. 
 
------------------------------ 
Using the Press to Raise Funds 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  SCRS assumed operations in Zam Zam from the Saudi Red 
Crescent (SRC) in December 2005.  SRC provided physical 
assets and three months of funding to SRCS.  SCRS managed 
to secure additional funding to continue until June 30, 
 
KHARTOUM 00001480  002 OF 002 
 
 
the date reported in recent press coverage.  The SRCS 
Health Coordinator stated that the organization contacted 
the media in an attempt to raise funds for the clinic. 
SRCS also noted that the organization will stay in Zam 
Zam beyond June 30, but does need to secure long-term 
funding.  While one article focused on the absence of an 
ambulance in Zam Zam, SRCS reported that making an 
ambulance available would be in vain due to insecurity 
and the threat of hijacking. 
 
-------------- 
Recommendation 
-------------- 
 
¶8.  Additional donor support to an international NGO to 
further build capacity of SRCS and SUDO would help to 
ensure the continued stability of the health situation in 
Zam Zam.  MDM-G is supporting SRCS with personnel and has 
already diverted one mobile clinic to Zam Zam.  MDM-G is 
also providing transportation for critical patients to El 
Fasher Hospital.  In addition, USAID partner Relief 
International has expressed interest in expanding into 
Zam Zam.  The DFO will continue to monitor the situation 
and liaise with these organizations regarding next steps.
