¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A/DCM and EMBOFFS met with freed editor Ali 
Mohaqeq Nasab.  He expressed thanks for the Embassy's efforts 
to influence his release and asked for substantial funding to 
supplement his women's rights publication and other 
endeavors.  While funding for the scale of projects Nasab 
wants to undertake is way beyond limited Embassy funding, 
Embassy Information Officer explained the kinds of capacity 
building support available under current programming.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On January 19, A/DCM and EMBOFFS met with Ali Mohaqeq 
Nasab, the editor of Hoqoq-e-Zan, a women's rights magazine. 
Last fall, Nasab had been arrested and charged with 
publishing anti-Islamic material.  He was sentenced to two 
years in prison, but an appeals court released him on 
December 21, with a suspended six month sentence.  Nasab 
reported that he had not been harassed since his release, but 
he has instead become a kind of celebrity. He has been 
contacted by many members of the moderate Islamic community 
who expressed their support for his actions.  His magazine 
has been allowed to continue, but without his leadership as 
Editor-in-Chief.  He is in the process of personally 
appealing this decision to the Minister for Information, 
Culture and Tourism. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Nasab asked for USG funds for the following four 
projects; saying that they would counter Iranian influence in 
Afghanistan as well as give support to moderate Muslims. 
 
- Islamic Science Center - Thirty Moderate Islamic religious 
scholars would investigate and research   different Islamic 
sects and write "real" Islamic viewpoints in the fields of 
politics, international relations, and peaceful relations 
between all religions.  He estimates this project will cost 
$400,000 per year. 
 
- Re-establish Hoqoq-e-Zan Magazine - While permission has 
been granted for the magazine to continue its publication, 
Nasab requested financial support to help resume publication, 
as the previous source of funding - an international NGO - 
had run its course. 
 
- Social Center for Islamic Scholars - Nasab would like to 
recruit 1,000 scholars, each with a monthly salary of $100, 
to staff their centers. Several committees would be formed to 
explore various Islamic issues, including a committee for 
reporters and one for students. 
 
- Assistance with Publication - Nasab has written four books 
on moderate Islam and would like U.S. financial assistance in 
order to publish them. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Nasab suggested that U.S. help for his programs 
would counter Iran's influence in Afghanistan.  He alleged 
that hundreds if not thousands of Afghan religious scholars 
were going to study in Iran and this was corrupting Afghan 
religious traditions.  A/DCM informed Nasab that the USG has 
limited funding available for capacity building in the media, 
and post's Information Officer explained to him the various 
technical assistance and exchange programs available for 
journalists. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: Nasab's detention and release has been a 
high profile issue.  Rather than lying low after his release, 
he appears to be trying to capitalize on his fame, and in any 
case is out continuing to find funding for his projects.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
¶5. (U) Dushanbe minimize considered.
