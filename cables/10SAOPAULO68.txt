Missed the Bus but Paid the Fare 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (1-28) by Eliane Catanhede 
says: "The Brazilian reaction to the...coup [in Honduras] was fast 
and decisive, in defense of the principle that an army cannot take 
democratically elected presidents from their homes and cast them 
out to other countries overnight.  From defending principles to 
seeking to become a protagonist was a leap.  Or a shot in the 
dark.....Brazil should have given shelter [to Manuel Zelaya] under 
the condition of asylum, per international norms, and should have 
established limits.  But it didn't do any of these.  The result is 
that Brazil assumed only one side of the issue, isolated itself and 
stood on the opposing side of Latin America by refusing to accept 
the election of the new president as a way out of the crisis.  This 
way the Honduran bus reached its final stop with the new 
destination of national unity...and all passengers that mattered 
were on it [including the U.S]....But the Brazilian government was 
not....Zelaya received four months of food, housing, phone usage 
and a free stage in the Brazilian Embassy....And what did Brazil 
get?  Or even so, did it get anything out of this?  No, it only 
paid the bill."
