¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: GOB officials have stated that Belgium 
will be represented at the January 25 Lebanon Donors' 
Conference in Paris by Prime Minister Verhofstadt and 
Minister of Cooperation and Development Armand De Decker. 
Although GOB officials confirm that Belgium plans to announce 
further support beyond the 5.2 million euros already pledged, 
officials were reluctant to disclose the details.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On January 16, Econoff spoke with Hendrik Van de 
Velde, Desk Officer for Lebanon in the Belgian MFA, and 
Michel Lastschenko, Advisor in the Ministry of Cooperation 
and Development.  Van de Velde stated that he would let the 
Belgian PM make the announcement, which he said would be much 
more than what Belgium pledged at Stockholm.  He also stated 
that Belgium was reviewing the extension of a loans agreement 
with Lebanon.  Lastschenko, meanwhile, confirmed further 
Belgian support, but stated that it is "far too early" to 
share the details.
