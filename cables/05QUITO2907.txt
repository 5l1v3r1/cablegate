In response to reftel request, Post provides the following 
information.  According to USAID sources in the USA, 
Microfinance International Corporation (MFIC) is a reputable 
company.  ProCredit is a reputable microfinance institution 
doing business in Ecuador.  The microfinance sector in 
Ecuador is among the more developed and successful 
microfinance sectors in Latin America.  Remittances represent 
the second highest source (after oil) of foreign revenue 
entering the country.  While the investment climate in 
Ecuador leaves much to desire, particularly with respect to 
contract enforcement and the judicial system, most commercial 
problems involve businesses that deal with the Government of 
Ecuador.  We have no information on Japanese citizen Atsumasa 
Tochisako.
