times of the day; however, at night visitors should use common sense

accidents are common and that it is safe to pull over so that police 
may take an accident report.  However, visitors who experience 
hostility or anti-American sentiment should depart the scene 
immediately and notify the RSO.

permitted to be used in the Chancery. 
 
i.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss sensitive or 
classified information outside secure environments or over unsecured

Consular Information sheet for New Zealand and the most recent

Internet at http://travel.state.gov
