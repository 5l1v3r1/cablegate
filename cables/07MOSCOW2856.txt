MINISTRY 
 
REF: STATE 81935 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We delivered reftel invitation to attend Washington 
discussions on the Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC) and 
Pre-Launch Notification Systems to the Foreign Ministry's 
North America Department on June 13. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Aleksey Ivanov expressed appreciation for the 
invitation but noted that the GOR still had not formulated 
its position on the upcoming talks.  There will be an 
interagency meeting during the week of June 18 to do so.  He 
said it would be helpful to have a formal draft agenda 
beforehand as a guide for next week's interagency meeting. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Administratively, Ivanov said Lieutenant General 
Yevgeniy Buzhinskiy of the Defense Ministry's International 
Treaty Department will head the Russian delegation, which 
will likely consist of ten members overall -- seven from 
Defense and three from the Foreign Ministry.
