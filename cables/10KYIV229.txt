SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
¶1. (SBU) Acting Economic Counselor and Economic Analyst met on 
February 3 with Igor Lupaltsov, the head of the National 
Environmental Investment Agency of Ukraine (NEIA), to discuss 
Ukraine's association with the Copenhagen Accord and deliver talking 
points per reftel A.  Lupaltsov, who headed the Ukrainian delegation 
at the Copenhagen summit, echoed NEIA's earlier statement that the 
agency supported the association but the final decision would be 
made by the Cabinet of Ministers (reftel B).  He did not provide a 
timeline of when Ukraine would formerly associate; although, he 
mentioned that NEIA would send its formal recommendation on February 
4 or 5 to the CabMin to associate. 
 
¶2. (SBU) While Lupaltsov professed Ukraine's disappointment with the 
outcome of the Copenhagen negotiations and criticized the 
organization of the summit, he said the Copenhagen Accord was an 
important step to reach a binding agreement.  At the same time, 
Lupaltsov stressed Ukraine would only join any future agreement if 
the Kyoto-based cap-and-trade mechanism remains in place.  Ukraine 
plans to offer an emission reduction target of 20% by 2020, using 
1990 as a baseline year.  However, to reduce emissions by just 10% 
from a business-as-usual scenario by 2020, Ukraine would reportedly 
need to spend approximately $20 billion - funds which Ukraine does 
not have absent a mechanism to sell its excess carbon units, 
according to Lupaltsov.  Although Ukraine's current emissions are 
approximately 60% of the 1990 level, Lupaltsov estimates it would 
exceed its emissions target if it reaches its goal of doubling GDP 
by 2020.  As a result, Ukraine views income from the cap-and-trade 
system as essential to reduced emissions.  Lupaltsov opined that the 
only chance for a binding agreement to succeed is if it is based on 
economic principles and offers a market-based approach to climate 
change. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Ukraine supports the Copenhagen Accord and wants 
positive movement toward a legally binding agreement that would be 
favorable to Ukraine.  A legally binding agreement that includes a 
carbon trading scheme benefits Ukraine in that it would provide cash 
for Ukraine's surplus carbon credits, and, presumably, it would 
attract environmental investment into Ukraine.  It is uncertain how 
soon Ukraine will formally associate with the accord given the 
ongoing change-over in government; however, it seems inevitable that 
Ukraine will associate and will continue to press for a follow-on 
binding agreement.  End Comment.
