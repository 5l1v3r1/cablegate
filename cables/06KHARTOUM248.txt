¶1. (U) In a meeting January 30, Counselor of South African 
Embassy Ebrahim Edries provided Pol/Econ officer with an 
overview of South African assistance programs in Sudan.  The 
main focus of the programs is on capacity building, 
especially on Southern Sudan.  Edries said within the next 
few weeks, 120 Sudanese will be sent to South Africa for a 
three-month training course with the expectation that they 
will return to take up government positions.  Edries said 
that a group of 30 Sudanese had already received training at 
the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare them 
to work as diplomats.  He said the total value of the program 
is about USD 3 million. 
 
¶2. (U) Edries said that South Africa, through its AMIS 
contingent, is also providing assistance in Darfur to 
strengthen the police force.  South Africans are assigned as 
CIVPOL officers under the AU mission.  Police stations have 
been set up in the IDP camps in Darfur, and South African 
police, in a program Edries described as a bilateral effort, 
are training Sudanese in police procedures.  Edries said that 
the South African commander in Darfur will complete his tour 
soon and the intention is to rotate him to Southern Sudan to 
initiate a similar effort to bolster police capacity there. 
 
¶3. (U) Edries expressed some disappointment with the pace of 
implementation of the CPA.  He commented that in recent 
meetings, South African officials have urged the SPLM 
leadership to be more proactive in taking up positions within 
the Government of National Unity.  Edris noted that while the 
CPA gives the SPLM 28 percent of key positions, many remain 
unfilled. He said that he has encountered some of the first 
30 trainees, now returned from training in South Africa, 
unemployed in Khartoum. 
 
¶4. (U) Edries will return to South Africa in about two months 
to take up an assignment as Deputy Chief of Staff to Minister 
Zuma.
