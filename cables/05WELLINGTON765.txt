SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND PRIORITIES AT PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM 
 
Classified By: Charge D'Affaires David R. Burnett, 
for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) New Zealand,s principal priority for the leaders' 
meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) is finalizing the 
Pacific Plan, in which New Zealand is seeking support of a 
process of regional integration and cooperation and movement 
away from patron-client relationships between developed and 
developing members. The government,s other priorities 
include encouraging free trade and raising awareness of the 
threat of an avian flu pandemic. 
 
¶2. (C) Poloff met September 27 with Niels Holm, Regional 
Deputy Director, Pacific Division, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT), to discuss New Zealand's priorities 
for the PIF,s October meeting.  In addition to finalizing 
the Pacific Plan, Holm said his government hopes to promote 
regional trade.  As part of that effort, GNZ has been 
monitoring negotiations between Forum Island Countries (FICs) 
and the European Union on Economic Partnership Agreements. 
While not opposing such agreements, GNZ seeks at least 
equally favorable trade treatment if agreements are reached. 
 
¶3. (SBU) New Zealand,s additional priorities include 
maintaining support for the Regional Assistance Mission to 
the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and raising awareness of avian 
influenza in the Pacific.  FICs have no practical action plan 
to address the possibility of avian flu, Holm said, although 
there are general guidelines provided through the Secretariat 
of the Pacific Community. 
 
¶4. (C) Holm reported that Italy and Israel have expressed 
interest in attending the Post Forum Dialogue.  While the GNZ 
does not oppose their attendance, it will not advocate their 
participation. 
 
¶5. (C) Prime Minister Helen Clark and whoever is the Foreign 
Minister will likely attend the meeting, Holm indicated. 
With PM Clark now working on forming a new government in the 
wake of September 17 elections, cabinet assignments are up in 
the air.  There is a strong possibility that current Foreign 
Minister Phil Goff will be replaced as he takes on an 
increasingly domestic portfolio.
