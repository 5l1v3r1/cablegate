  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Be careful about the U.S.'s transferring middle class crisis" 
 
The People's Daily-sponsored and internationally-focused commercial 
news publication Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/25)(pg 14): "The 
American engineer's suicidal airplane attack on the tax bureau 
building shows that the American middle class are experiencing a 
serious crisis.  In the last 20 or 30 years, the American 
middle-class, the basis of the U.S.'s political and economic system, 
has undergone a process of impasse, setback and near collapse. 
Meanwhile, the rescue measures of the right and left were 
incompatible. The U.S. is at a historical cross-road.  After one 
year in office, President Obama is still faltering and having 
difficulties when reforming the medical system, the financial 
system, and the other sectors.  What happens to the American 
middle-class is at stake with in China.  Someone with ulterior 
motives in the United States intends to use issues like the exchange 
rate, climate change, intellectual property protection, cyber 
security and other topics to shift the American middle class's 
sentiment into disappointment, worry, fear, and anger.  China must 
be vigilant of the U.S.'s attempt to shape China as an enemy so as 
to ease their own [domestic] pressures." 
 
¶2. DALAI MEETING 
 
"Dalai Lama's vQit to the U.S. has little momentum and effect" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(02/25)(pg 1): 
"During the Dalai's visit to the United States, he did not get the 
chance to publically meet with Obama. It seems that his gains were 
few: two photos together, a verbal support and a medal. Experts said 
that the White House chose the Map room as the meeting room in order 
to imply the meeting's informal nature. In this way, the United 
States wanted to avoid further irritating China. American public 
opinion suggests, and all facts show, that the Dalai has become 
Obama's pawn to maintain the U.S. interest and contain China. 
However, the pawn's future is not optimistic in the eyes of the 
international society. Ted Carpenter said that the Dalai Lama seems 
to use meetings with Western politicians to create international 
pressure, especially diplomatic pressure between the United States 
and China. However, the Dalai's words and deeds, in fact, will not 
waiver the substance of Sino-U.S. relations.  If the differences 
between China and the United States can remain at a manageable 
level, the relationship between the two sides may expect a 
turnaround in the second half of the year." 
 
¶3. IRAN 
 
"China could act more leisurely on the Iran nuclear issue" 
 
The People's Daily-sponsored and internationally-focused commercial 
news publication Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/25)(pg 14): "The 
sensitivities and difficulty of China's stance on the Iran issue are 
due to the fact that the unified stance of the U.S., UK, France and 
Germany, leaves China without a clear stance for possible 
opposition.  In fact, there is still room for diplomatic resolution 
in addition to other hard-line options of resolution from threats 
about sanctions to a military strike.  The recent policies of Iran 
and the United States suggest that the Iran issue will follow the 
development of either of these two tracks (diplomatic resolution and 
hard-line resolution) alternatively.  Therefore, China should be 
able to make their choice on stance more leisurely, less urgently, 
more independently, and less bindingly.  Specifically, China should 
separate the different issues and avoid closely connecting 
China-Iran relations with Sino-U.S. relations. Instead choosing to 
relate their general Iran policy to specific tactics on the Iran 
nuclear issue; choosing to relate the Iran nuclear issue to the 
policy on Iran's development of nuclear weapons.  The better 
Sino-Iran relations develop, a more positive role that China could 
play in the region."
