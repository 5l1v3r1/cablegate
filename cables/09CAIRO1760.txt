REF:STATE 93373 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor Donald A. Blome for reason 1.4 (b).
1.(C) On September 10, we delivered reftel points on the September UN Human Rights Council session to MFA Deputy Director for Human Rights Omar Shalaby who reiterated Egypt's commitment to working toward passage of the U.S.-Egyptian freedom of expression resolution text. Shalaby said that he and Egyptian diplomats in Geneva have urged Geneva-based Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Africa Group diplomats to support the U.S.-Egyptian text. He said most Islamic countries have been "helpful" so far, and have praised the GOE for its coordination with the U.S. He cited Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Indonesia as reacting positively to the draft text.

2.(C) However, according to Shalaby, Pakistan and Algeria have been "particularly critical" of the text for not explicitly repeating language on legal prohibition from article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Shalaby said that he is personally working to urge the Pakistani and Algerian delegations in Geneva to accept the U.S.-Egyptian draft language, and that he will continue to do so when the attends the September 14 OIC expert-level meeting in Geneva.

3.(C) Shalaby told us the GOE will support a resolution extending the mandate of the Independent Expert for Somalia, and noted that the mandate needs to be responsive to Somalia's specific needs. Regarding Burundi, Shalaby said the GOE "can go along" with extending the independent expert's mandate because of Burundi's failure to establish a functioning independent human rights institution. Shalaby noted that the GOE does not have a stake in the Cambodia resolution, and would therefore join the consensus.

4.(C) According to Shalaby, the GOE will not support the discriminatory laws against women resolution, calling the draft "legally problematic and arbitrary." "One Special Rapporteur or Independent Expert cannot review the laws of all countries around the world," he asserted. We urged support for this resolution as an important step for women's rights. Shalaby said Egypt "likes" the Russian-sponsored traditional values resolution, and would support it. Shalaby asked for U.S. support, "or at least understanding" for Non-Aligned Movement-sponsored resolutions on the right to development and on unilateral coercive measures. He also requested U.S. support for a procedural resolution on the protection civilians in armed conflict that Egypt will sponsor. He said Egypt and Brazil will sponsor resolutions on access to medication and on convening a follow-up session on the financial crisis. Scobey
