Airbus Order

¶2. (U)  During a July 15 press conference at Farnborough, England 
International Air show, the CEO of Tunisair, Nabil Chattaoui, signed 
a contract for the purchase of three A350 XWB-800, three A330-200 
and ten A320s. Based on the catalog price-list, the transaction is 
valued at nearly $2 billion.  An agreement in principal on the sale 
had been previously concluded in April during the visit to Tunisia 
of French President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
 
¶3. (U)  According to local press reports, Chattaoui said that the 
Airbus order demonstrates Tunisair's confidence in the aircraft and 
the long-term strategy of Tunisair.  He explained that the new 
aircraft would give Tunisair the capability to extend service to 
Asia and North America and would promote its regional positioning.

¶4. (U)  Chattaoui also signed an industrial partnership agreement 
between Tunisair and Airbus through which promises to create 200 new 
jobs in the aviation sector in Tunisia.  A spokesman for Airbus told 
Reuters that the partnership would focus on components, but gave no 
further details.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (U)  Before the April visit of Nicolas Sarkozy to Tunisia, 
frequent press reports spoke of the intention of Latecoere, a French 
company manufacturing aeronautic components for Airbus, to expand 
its operations in Tunisia.  Latecoere reportedly planned to open a 
new factory in Tunisia and create 2000 new jobs.  Shortly after the 
April agreement in principal awarding Airbus the Tunisiair contract, 
negotiations between Airbus and Latecoere fell through.  These 
failed negotiations dealt with Latecoere purchasing two Airbus 
factories in the South of France.  These two Airbus factories were 
to become the main supply source for the new Latecoere plant in 
Tunisia.  As the result of the breakdown in Airbus/Latecoere 
negotiations, Latecoere cancelled its plans to invest some $150 
billion building the new plant in Tunisia and along with it the 
projected 2,000 additional jobs for Tunisians.  It is not yet clear 
how Airbus will fulfill the industrial partnership agreement it to 
create the announced 200 jobs. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  There remains a slight possibility that Tunisair will 
conclude a deal with Boeing for three firm 737s and one optional 737 
for delivery in 2015 and 2016. Boeing had extended this offer until 
June 30 and was told that Tunisair had made its recommendation to 
the Government of Tunisia which is still studying it.  The Boeing 
offer also included a partnership between Boeing's subsidiary, the 
Jeppesen Company, and the Aviation Training Center of Tunisia, ATCT. 
 Post will report updated information as it becomes available.  End
