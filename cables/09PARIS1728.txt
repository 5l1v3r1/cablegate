(SBU) French MFA desk officer for Pakistan, Annie Evrard, provided 
Econoff with a response to the points in ref A on December 18. 
Evrard said France currently has no plans to provide funds to 
augment the World Food Program's (WFP) operations in Pakistan, and 
that the budget for food aid is closed for 2009.  However, Evrard 
said an interministerial committee on food aid will meet in January. 
 She said MFA had not yet decided whether to request more food aid 
for Pakistan, but to do so, MFA would need both a request from WFP 
and a recommendation from the French Embassy in Islamabad.
