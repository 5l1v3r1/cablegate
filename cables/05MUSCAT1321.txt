Disingenuous Disengagement 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1. The privately owned Arabic daily "al-Watan" featured an 
editorial on August 29 entitled "The Other Side Of Gaza 
Disengagement": 
 
"The world has now started to realize Sharon's real intentions 
after disengaging from Gaza.  He immediately began building a 
discrimination wall around Jerusalem in an attempt to make it a 
solely Jewish area, and to stop the implementation of the 
Roadmap.  We had expected those who were involved with the peace 
process to demand that Israel halt settlement activity and the 
building of the discrimination wall, but it seems that the 
Palestinians have been left alone to fight this particular 
battle."

No More Tears

¶2. Also on August 29, the government-owned Arabic daily "Oman" 
published an editorial entitled "Shedding Tears For Political 
Interests": 
 
"The Western media have purposely and cleverly selected 
particular Gaza scenes to show to the world, making sure that 
images of Israeli settlers shedding tears are given front-page 
treatment.  The purpose was to show that Israel is sacrificing 
for the sake of peace.  But, if these images demonstrate how 
difficult it was for the Israelis to leave the settlements, how 
can the world expect a simple, quick, and painless disarmament by 
the Palestinians?  The Israeli government should work diligently 
towards a genuine peace, and not use tears as a tool for their 
own political interests."

Daily Constitutional 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. "Oman" ran an editorial on August 28 under the headline "Until 
Iraq Emerges From The Dilemma": 
 
"Taking into consideration the importance of ratifying the new 
Iraqi constitution, there are many elements that present 
challenges and worries to the future of Iraq.  There are 
unfortunate events taking place, and there is the possibility of 
a civil war that may erupt between clashing factions - primarily 
due to disagreements over the new constitution.  On the other 
hand, there are last-minute hopes that these factions will 
communicate to reach an agreement that will help end the 
bloodshed."
