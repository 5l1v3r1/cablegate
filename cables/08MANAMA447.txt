SUBJECT: BAHRAIN: SOLICITING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NUCLEAR 
THREAT INITIATIVE PROPOSAL FOR A NUCLEAR FUEL BANK 
 
REF: STATE 68313 

Classified By: CDA Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1.(C) Poloff briefed MFA Legal Affairs officer Najah Ali Rashid on the Nuclear Threat Initiative proposal on July 3 and made the case for a GOB contribution to the fund. He pointed out that Bahrain's MOU commitments on obtaining fuel from established international sources would make it a prime candidate to benefit from the establishment of a nuclear fuel bank, and that a financial contribution to the project by a potential beneficiary would send the right message.

2.(C) Rashid reiterated the GOB's fuel cycle commitments and noted King Hamad's directive to pursue nuclear energy transparently and in accordance with all international non-proliferation standards. She indicated interest in the fuel bank proposal and undertook to consult with MFA Legal Adviser Dr. Yusuf Abdulkarim, the GOB's point-man on nuclear non-proliferation, about a possible contribution. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** HENZEL
