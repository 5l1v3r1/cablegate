SUBJECT: TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTRY PRESS STATEMENT ON IRAQI 
REFERENDUM 
 
The Turkish Foreign Ministry published the following press 
statement October 17 on the Iraqi constitutional referendum. 
Informal Embassy translation follows: 
 
Begin MFA press statement.  We are pleased that the 
referendum concerning the new constitution for Iraq was 
realized in a relatively secure climate, without being 
subject to widespread acts of terrorism or violence.  Yet 
another stage in Iraq's political transition process has been 
accomplished.  We hope that this will be for the good of all 
Iraqis. 
 
The most positive aspect of the October 15 referendum may be 
that it helps the political process reach its natural state 
in a concrete manner.  It will be important from the point of 
view of the new constitutional order that all Iraqi sectors 
develop further the political participation and maturity 
displayed during the referendum as they turn their attention 
and energy to the general elections to be held in December. 
 
On the other hand, we find it useful to share with 
international public opinion once again our view that the 
establishment of an effective and transparent international 
monitoring mechanism for the elections will make a positive 
contribution to a successful conclusion of this stage of the 
political process. 
 
Turkey, an historical friend and neighbor of the Iraqi 
people, has given priority to establishing close dialogue 
with all Iraqi sectors without discrimination while sharing 
its experience with democracy and compromise.  With this in 
mind, Turkey will continue to maintain close contact with all 
Iraqis, support the political process, and help Iraq reach a 
bright future in wholeness and unity.  End MFA press 
statement.
