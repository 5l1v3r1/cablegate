SUBJECT: NO MI-17 HELOS IN GERMANY'S INVENTORY 
 
REF: STATE 55654 
 
(SBU) Germany has no Mi-17 helicopters in its inventory and 
is therefore not able to make any available for lease, sale 
or donation to Pakistan, as requested reftel.  German MOD 
NATO Office Director Col. Thomas Hambach confirmed to us on 
June 2 that the Bundeswehr had long decommissioned, sold or 
otherwise disposed of the Soviet-era helicopters it had 
inherited from the GDR National People's Army as the result 
of German unification.
