Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) Summary and Comment:  At the conclusion of their November 
20-24 talks in Naivasha, Kenya, the Transitional Federal Government 
(TFG) and Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) Joint 
Security Committee (JSC) issued a communique, the text of which 
appears in paragraph 3.  The JSC agreed to set up joint offices in 
Somalia, conduct ceasefire monitoring, and form a combined police 
force.  According to contacts at the UN Political Office for 
Somalia, the JSC also agreed on a working document and budget to 
present to donors possibly as early as November 28.  The working 
document reportedly will propose combining roughly 2,700 
newly-trained TFG police with an additional yet-to-be-trained 2,700+ 
ARS police. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Members of the JSC told us they were proud of this latest 
successful round of talks and they look forward to continuing their 
work together as soon as possible in Somalia.  An UNPOS contact 
involved in the meeting expressed satisfaction with the outcome, but 
noted that donors will have to deal with financial accountability 
problems that have prevented recent salary payments to the Ugandan 
trained TFG police.  United Nations Political Office for Somalia 
(UNPOS) staff will recommend to the Secretary General's Special 
Representative for Somalia (SRSG) that he approache Arab countries 
to fund security forces' salaries.  The results of this JSC meeting, 
coupled with a groundbreaking session of the High Level Committee in 
Djibouti (septel) represent significant and positive progress on the 
Djibouti Process.  End summary and comment.
