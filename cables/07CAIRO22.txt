¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Scientists at NAMRU-3 conducted a 
detailed examination of the H5N1 avian influenza virus 
responsible for the deaths of three family members in late 
December in the Gharbiya governorate (ref A).  Early results 
show that the virus has undergone mutations and acquired some 
characteristics of mammalian strains.  All of these mutations 
have been seen before in swine or humans in other countries. 
Though this is not/not a pandemic influenza virus and 
scientists cannot say that these mutations are a step towards 
creation of a pandemic virus, the changing face of avian 
influenza in Egypt requires careful monitoring.  NAMRU-3 
continues to collaborate closely with GOE officials to survey 
the virus in humans and the bird population.  End Summary.

MIXING AND RECOMBINATION IN EGYPT 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Specimens from the most recent deaths suggest that 
Egypt could be acting as a type of mixing bowl for diverse 
strains of H5N1 originating from thousands of miles away. 
The virus obtained from the thirty-nine year old Gharbiya 
woman who succumbed to H5N1 in October (ref B) showed a 
mutation not previously seen in Egypt.   Two of the three 
December cases in Gharbiya sequenced by NAMRU-3 showed that 
same mutation, as well as two additional mutations.  One of 
these mutations is identical to another discovered in 
Mongolia in 2005, which is on the migratory flyway with 
Egypt.  Crossed by two major flyways, millions of wild birds 
pass through Egypt each autumn and spring, migrating between 
Africa and Central Asia.

THE CHANGING FACE OF AVIAN INFLUENZA 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU)  According to officials at NAMRU-3, sequencing of 
the October and December cases shows that the virus is 
acquiring changes which make it look more like a mammalian 
virus.  All three recent mutations have been seen before in 
swine or humans in other countries.  Though this is not/not a 
pandemic virus and scientists cannot say that these mutations 
are a step towards creation of a pandemic virus, the fact 
that a single virus has acquired three mutations in three 
months is cause for careful monitoring. The virus' ability to 
acquire mammalian characteristics rapidly, in regions of the 
viral genome that determine its infectivity, needs to be 
carefully evaluated.  In the most recent cases, there is no 
evidence that the virus is efficiently transmitted from 
person to person.

MISSION RESPONSE 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  NAMRU-3 representatives are keeping officials from 
the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), CDC, DOD 
surveillance teams, and WHO in Geneva of the test results. 
NAMRU-3 also submitted the virus sequences to Genbank, a NIH 
genetic sequence databank; they will be accessible to the 
public in a few days on their web site  There is a high 
likelihood that both the press and scientific community  will 
speculate about the meaning of the mutations.  NAMRU is in 
the process of sequencing the remainder of the viral genome 
in all of these cases.  In collaboration with Ministry of 
Environment (MOE), NAMRU is continuing surveillance of wild 
bird populations to detect any new viral strains entering 
Egypt.
