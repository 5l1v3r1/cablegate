SUBJECT: COSTA RICA NOT PARADISE-RAW SEWAGE EVERYWHERE 
 
¶1. This is the first in an occasional series of cables explaining 
why Costa Rica is not paradise.  These cables seek to paint a 
realistic picture of the day-to-day challenges faced by Costa Rica. 
Travel brochures don't tell the entire story. 
 
¶2. Summary. Costa Rica treats less than 3% of human waste, dumping 
97% of its sewage into the nation's rivers that drain to the sea, 
making the rivers little more than contaminated open drainage 
ditches.  Despite this shocking lack of modern infrastructure in a 
nation that takes great pride in its environmental reputation, 
lawmakers vacillated for months before finally accepting a Japanese 
loan for major sewage treatment projects.  End Summary.

¶3.  After months of vacillating and missed deadlines, Costa Rican 
lawmakers gave final approval in November 2006 to Law No. 8559 
approving acceptance of a US$127 million loan from the government of 
Japan for sewage treatment projects.  The loan will finance part an 
overall project estimated at US$557 million to replace the decrepit 
sewage collection system in the San Jose metropolitan area and to 
build a sewage treatment plant.  According to the local water and 
sewer authority's manager, the current sewer system covers less than 
45% of the metropolitan area population.  Nationwide, only 25% of 
the population is served by sewers.  Inadequate treatment plants 
mean that even when wastes are collected they are not treated.  Many 
commercial and industrial areas are not served by either the sewer 
system or septic tanks, dumping wastes directly into the nation's 
rivers.

¶4.  Nationwide, Costa Rica currently treats only 2.6% of human waste 
generated, ranking Costa Rica amongst the five worst countries in 
Latin America. And the country is falling backward.  The 2.6% figure 
was revised down from 4% after the current Minister of Environment 
challenged the inclusion of non-operative treatment systems in the 
estimate.)  The Central Valley area, which includes greater 
metropolitan San Jose and nearly two million people, has an 
antiquated sewage collection system with many underground lines 
dating from mid-century that have rusted through.  In some areas 
sewage can be seen leaking into the streets.  Despite the fact that 
at least 100 new residential subdivisions have been added to the 
network, there has been no extensive work on the Central Valley 
sewer system since 1981. 
 
¶5.  Nearly all waste enters the rivers that flow through San Jose 
and drain into the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Nicoya via the Rio 
Grande de Tarcoles.  Local residents know they should avoid beaches 
in that area due to the "black waters".  Contamination has damaged 
mangrove forests and coral reefs and is suspected of causing reduced 
fish catches.  Water contamination is also linked to hepatitis, 
cholera, skin problems and cases of diarrhea increased 16% in Costa 
Rica from 2002 to 2005. 
 
¶6. In addition to the Japanese loan, experts estimate that Costa 
Rica will need an additional US$430 million to complete the entire 
project.  The Japanese loan will be applied to the first phase of 
the project estimated to cost $230 million.  Costa Rica's share of 
the first phase will be raised by increasing water and sewer rates. 
The project is expected to greatly improve the quality of the 
receiving waters in the Rivera, Torres, Maria Aguilar, Tiribi and 
Tarcoles Rivers. 
 
¶7. Comment:  While famous for its investment in "green" issues such 
as national parks and biodiversity protection, Costa Rica does not 
walk the talk when it comes to "brown" environmental issues such as 
sewage treatment.  For a tourism-dependent country that relies upon 
its reputation as an environmental paradise and prime ecotourism 
destination, the nation's use of its rivers in lieu of a modern 
sanitation system, as the conduit for dumping raw untreated waste 
onto its most convenient beaches and important fishing areas is a 
shocking revelation.  The poor state of the sewage system creates 
particular hazards for agricultural areas downstream of major 
cities, where sewage-borne disease like cholera could frighten away 
customers.  The lack of fundamental sewage treatment infrastructure 
is further evidence that Costa Rica's modernization and development 
is fragile.  End Comment.
