University.  Entrepreneurship has been a key theme of the 
Ambassador's public appearances since July.

Ambassador's direction, met with nine local NGOs working to

Sawiris Foundation; The Education for Employment Foundation; Ashoka 
Arab World; Misr El Kheir; Horizon Interactive Studios; Enterprise 
Egypt; Nahdet Mahrousa; and The Middle East Council for Small
