The Ministry of Foreign Relations 
Managua, 4 April 2008 
MRE/DM-DGO/343/04/08 
 
Her Excellency Madam 
Condoleezza Rice 
Secretary of State 
 
SIPDIS 
The United States of America 
 
Your Excellency, Madam Secretary: 
 
It gives me great satisfaction and pride to write to you to 
let you know that, on March 14 of this year, the Latin 
American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC) at the United Nations, 
New York, decided by acclamation to endorse father Miguel 
D'Escoto Brockman of Nicaragua as a candidate for the 
Presidency of the Sixty-third United Nations General Assembly. 
 
For our Government of National Reconciliation and National 
Unity, headed by President Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra, 
this endorsement is an example of solidarity and recognition 
of the countries in the region for the efforts that Nicaragua 
has been making in the multilateral arena to promote the 
Purposes and Principles of the United Nations Charter. 
Father Miguel D'Escoto plans to strengthen these efforts in 
the following areas: 
 
(1) Strengthen the democratization of the United Nations to 
achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in the General 
Assembly in accordance with the Charter's purposes and 
principles. 
 
(2) Recovery of multilateralism with the most absolute 
respect for the Charter, as the only way to approach and 
resolve current problems within a democratic and transparent 
process. 
 
(3) Promote a greater and more effective relationship between 
the General Assembly and the International Financial 
Institutions of Bretton Woods, so that they comply with their 
objective to maintain the world's financial stability for the 
benefit of the equitable economic development, against 
poverty. 
 
(4) Contribute to building awareness about the 
social-economic implications of climate change and promote 
steps to combat its effects. 
 
(5) Strengthen and promote human rights defense including the 
right to life, the right to development, and right of women 
to transversal integration in all development plans. 
 
For these reasons, I wish to formally invite your illustrious 
government to support the Latin American and Caribbean Group 
candidate for the presidency of the 63rd United Nations 
General Assembly. 
 
Your Excellency, you have my highest and most distinguished 
consideration. 
 
(hugs)
