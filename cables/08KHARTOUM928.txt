SUBJECT: ABYEI: CPA PARTIES AGREE TO THE HAGUE PERMANENT COURT OF 
ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE ABYEI'S PERMANENT BORDERS 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 925 
 
¶1. (SBU) As announced widely in the press, the SPLM and the NCP 
agreed in Juba June 21 that the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 
the Hague will serve as the arbitration mechanism to resolve the 
permanent borders of the Abyei region.  GNU Second Vice President 
Taha traveled to Juba June 19 and 20 for the negotiations and met 
with GOSS President and GNU First Vice President Kiir, although 
negotiations were primarily between Taha and GOSS Vice President 
Riek Machar, according to representatives on both sides.  A copy of 
the agreement is included at the bottom of this cable for reference. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) SPLM Minister of the Presidency Luka Biong Deng told CG 
June 22 that according to the agreement, the court will determine 
whether or not the Abyei Boundaries Commission panel exceeded its 
mandate.  NCP negotiator Dirdeiry Ahmed Mohammed told polchief June 
22 that if the court determines that the ABC panel did exceed its 
mandate, the court itself will determine Abyei's boundaries 
according to submissions by the parties.  Dirdeiry said that NCP and 
SPLM had consulted the court before making this decision and that 
the court is willing to play this role.  A Dutch lawyer provided by 
the Dutch embassy assisted the parties during their negotiations in 
Juba.  Post has provided the contact details for the lawyer - 
Professor Lammers - to L and SPG.  Per the Dutch Embassy, Professor 
Lammers is willing to brief incoming L visitor Christina Sanford on 
the agreement, next steps in the process, and likely sticking 
points. 
 
---------------------- 
INTERIM ADMINISTRATION 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Biong Deng told CG that the parties were close to an 
agreement on the naming of interim administrators for Abyei and he 
expected that the issue would be resolved in the coming days. 
Dirdeiry provided more or less the same read-out, but added some 
nuance.  He said there was a "gentleman's agreement" that neither 
party would nominate "controversial" candidates; therefore current 
SPLM representative in Abyei Edward Lino would not be named, nor 
would Misseriya provocateur Ansari.  However, he said the NCP was 
not yet willing to concede that the Misseriya would not be allowed 
to have the Administrator nor the Deputy Administrator positions. 
Dirdeiry said the administration would be named "within a week." 
Asked if this would affect the date when oil revenues from Abyei 
would begin to be shared, Dirdeiry pointed out that per the June 8 
Abyei agreement, Abyei revenues would be shared effective the date 
of the agreement.  He noted that Higleig oil revenues would also be 
shared from that date forward, but based on the national formula 
rather than the Abyei protocol formula. 
 
-------------- 
ELECTORAL LAW 
-------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Biong Deng told CG that the CPA parties were also close to 
an agreement on the electoral law, which would likely be announced 
by the end of next week, and that the final agreement would likely 
parallel what the SPLM had discussed with northern "opposition" 
political parties in recent weeks.  This would result in a 55-45 
percent mixed electoral system with candidate constituencies pegged 
to state-level lists.  Dirdeiry provided a slightly different 
read-out, claiming that in this area there was another "gentleman's 
agreement" in which the NCP had conceded on the point of state-level 
candidate lists in exchange for the SPLM conceding on a 60-40 split. 
 He said the CPA parties now needed time to explain this to other 
political parties so that they would not be accused of excluding 
other political parties from the process.  Dirdeiry warned that 
elections should be approached carefully, since "we don't want Sudan 
becoming a failed state." 
 
---- 
JIUs 
---- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Biong Deng told CG that the JIUs were well on their way to 
being formed, but that there has been no progress on the withdrawal 
of the SAF 31st brigade.  Dirdeiry echoed this and said there will 
be a CJMC meeting on Abyei June 25 to assess the JIU deployment plan 
and determine a date for the withdrawal of the SAF that would be 
"consistent with the terms of the May 8 Abyei agreement."

COMMENT 
 
KHARTOUM 00000928  002 OF 002 
 
 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Although the two parties had already identified the court 
in the Hague as a possible arbitration mechanism, it is nonetheless 
an additional sign of progress and a positive confidence-building 
measure that they finalized another agreement on Abyei.  Although 
the parties could have gone further and named an administration, 
their mutual assurances that candidates would be named in the coming 
days should keep the momentum going, but such unwritten agreements 
have a way of unraveling in Sudan (so do written ones).  Progress on 
the elections law is somewhat more dubious, as neither party is 
particularly eager to move forward with elections planning now. 
They will need a nudge in that direction and the international 
community needs to think seriously about what it expects from 
elections, and how it should interact with the parties to ensure 
that this CPA milestone can be met without destabilizing both the 
North and the South.
