¶1. (U) Below is Embassy Panama's input for the congressionally 
mandated annual report on investment disputes as contemplated in 
Section 527 of the FY 94-95 Foreign Relations Authorizations Act. 
 
The United States is aware of one case in which United States 
citizens have an outstanding claim against the Government of Panama. 
 There are no new cases since Embassy Panama's filing of the 2007 
report. 
 
¶2. (U) Last Update: 12 June 2008 
a.  Claimant A 
b.  2005 
c.  In 1998, Claimant A invested $11 million in a Panamanian energy 
company's equity and arranged for the company to receive a $17 
million bank bridge loan convertible into bonds.  Claimant A alleges 
that both the equity and debt investments are subject to equal value 
tax credits under Panamanian Law No. 28 of 1995.  In March 2005, the 
Vice-Minister of Finance notified Claimant A that the sale of the 
original $11 million in stock was not subject to any tax benefits. 
Claimant A has taken the matter to arbitration under the U.S.-Panama 
Bilateral Investment Treaty.  Currently, jurisdictional matters are 
being studied and Panama has until August to make a jurisdictional 
claim.  Panama may claim that the Claimant A is not a US company, 
but rather a Bahaman company.  Post believes the company is 
American.  Claimant A is also in litigation with various Panamanian 
banks regarding payment of its bridge loan.  The parties have come 
to agreement if a judge approves the settlement. In previous years, 
Claimant A sought assistance from various USG agencies in this 
matter. 
 
POST ACTION:  Previously, Post had urged the GOP to resolve the tax 
credit dispute promptly and fairly; but given that the matter is now 
in arbitration and in the courts, Post plans no further action. 
Post remains in contact with Claimant A and is monitoring the 
matter. 
 
List of Claimants: 
 
Claimant A: Corporacion Panamena de Energia S.A. (70% interest held 
by U.S. controlled companies, Unisource Energy Corporation and 
Electric Machinery Enterprises Inc.)
