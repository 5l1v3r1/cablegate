¶3. On September 25, 2008, Export Control Attach Peter 
Liston and ICE LES Sergey Kishkimsky conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with JSC Novo, 
Dubki Street 6, Moscow, Russia. The export control 
team met with Vladimir Filippovsky, President, and 
Andrey Kaznin, Commercial Director. 
 
¶4. JSC (Joint Stock Company) Novo was established 
circa 1992 and was founded by former Soviet officials 
of State owned institutions.  JSC Novo is located in a 
stand-alone two-story office building that house their 
production facility, administrative offices and sales 
department.  JSC Novo has 50 employees and 
manufactures police and security electronics such as 
detection equipment, x-ray, and metal detectors.  JSC 
Novo attends international security and police trade 
shows as an exhibitor and has established an export 
branch within their sales department. 
 
¶5. The Export Control Attach office provided a copy 
of the Commercial Invoice of the commodities for 
subject cable to JSC Novo one day before the PSV 
because Novo indicated that they do not believe that 
they had been in receipt of any commodities that would 
warrant the visit from the ECO.  During the PSV visit 
to Novo, Vladimir Filippovsky explained to the ECO 
that he carefully reviewed the Commercial Invoice with 
his Commercial Director and did not find any line 
items that Novo purchased.  Vladimir Filippovsky 
stated that JSC Novo has a long and respected history 
with the Intermediate Consignee Altex Co, and stated 
that it is possible that Altex made the purchase and 
stocked the line items in anticipation of orders from 
JSC Novo in the future. 
 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC Novo, Dubki 
Street 6, Moscow, Russia as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
