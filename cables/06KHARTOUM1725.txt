Joint Commission Meeting 
 
You will recall that the 13th June 2006 meeting of the Joint 
Commission was inconclusive because of differences regarding the 
nature and extent of participation in the meeting by those who are 
not signatories to the DPA.  The meeting was suspended to allow for 
consultations on these issues and find a way forward.  It was agree 
that the Commission would reconvene soon after the AU Summit in 
Banjul.  Indeed, recent developments in Darfur have increased the 
necessity for the Joint Commission to start functioning well. 
 
The chairperson of the Commission, Ambassador Baba Gana Kingibe, was 
nonetheless unable to convene the Joint Commission after the AU 
Summit because of the exigencies arising from developments on the 
ground in Darfur, which were very preoccupying and the preparations 
for the AMIS pledging conference scheduled to take place in Brussels 
on 18 July 2006.  He however wishes to inform that a consultative 
meeting with members of the Commission and observers from the 
international partners will be convened soon after the pledging 
conference and in light of what was discussed there, to sort out the 
contentious issue of participation and agree on how to proceed. 
 
Best regards, 
 
(signed) 
 
Mrs. Monique Mukaruliza 
Deputy Head of Mission
