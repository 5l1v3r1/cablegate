--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
Mr. Ambassador, 
 
I have the honor to confirm receiving Diplomatic Note number 137 of 
April 2, 2008, which has the following content: 
 
"I have the honor to refer to the Implementing Arrangement between 
the Government of the United States of America and the Government of 
the Federative Republic of Brazil for the Design, Development, 
Operation and Use of Flight Equipment and Payloads for the 
International Space Station Program (the Arrangement), signed at 
Brasilia October 14, 1997. 
 
Based on discussions between representatives of the Government of 
the United States and the Government of Brazil concerning the 
implementation of the Arrangement and the progress in completion of 
the International Space Station, I have the honor to propose that 
the Arrangement be suspended for an indefinite period of time. I 
also have the honor to propose that the suspension of the 
Arrangement shall take effect upon receipt of your signed note in 
reply. 
 
Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration." 
 
¶2.  Regarding this matter, I would like to inform you that the 
Government of Brazil agrees with the suspension of the Implementing 
Agreement, with the objective of evaluating future opportunities of 
additional cooperation in this area. 
 
¶3.  The Government of Brazil equally agrees that both the referenced 
Note and the present responding Note are part of the understanding 
of the two Governments for the suspension of the referred 
Implementing Agreement, and will go into effect the moment that you 
receive the present Note. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to renew, Excellency, the 
assurances of my highest consideration.
