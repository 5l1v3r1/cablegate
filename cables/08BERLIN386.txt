CERTIFICATION 
 
REF: STATE 27762 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Per reftel request, Embassy Berlin has 
found no evidence that would suggest that United Nations 
Volunteers (UNV) or its affiliate organizations have ties to 
groups that support pedophilia.  Per UNV representatives, the 
organization does not grant official status, accreditation, 
or recognition to any organization that promotes, condones, 
and/or seeks the legalization of pedophilia, or that has any 
subsidiaries or member organizations that do.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Post contacted a representative from UNV, whose 
headquarters are located in Bonn, who provided us with a 
website listing their partners.  The website can be found at 
http://www.unv.org/partners/partnership-list/ print.html. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The list of partner agencies includes 22 UN 
agencies and seven other agencies.  Information about the 22 
UN agencies is either requested directly from other posts in 
reftel, or is most readily attainable from USUN; as such, 
Embassy Berlin will not look into these agencies.  Of the 
seven other agencies, two of them -- the European Union and 
the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent -- 
are based outside of Germany and have a regional or global 
reach that spans well beyond Germany. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The other five agencies listed as partners with 
UNV were not readily known to Embassy Berlin personnel, and 
were examined in accordance with reftel instructions, 
utilizing the internet.  Results were as follows: 
 
-- CIVICUS:  This is a South African-based NGO that seeks to 
strengthen citizen action and civil society throughout the 
world.  Our investigation yielded no overt ties to groups 
that support pedophilia. 
 
-- International Association for Volunteer Effort (IAVE): 
This is a California-based NGO that seeks to promote the 
development of volunteering worldwide.  They already have 
special consultative status with the UN ECOSOC Committee, and 
associate status with the UN Department of Public 
Information.  Our investigation yielded no overt ties to 
groups that support pedophilia. 
 
-- Inter-American Development Bank (IADB):  This is a 
U.S.-based international development bank that serves as the 
main source of financing for economic development in Latin 
America and the Caribbean.  Our investigation yielded no 
overt ties to groups that support pedophilia. 
 
-- New Academy of Business:  This is a UK-based NGO that 
seeks to provide leaders with insights on organizational 
responsibility.  Our investigation yielded no overt ties to 
groups that support pedophilia.  Post notes there is a 
limited amount of information about this NGO on the internet. 
 Embassy London may have additional information. 
 
-- OneWorld: This is a UK-based NGO that seeks to promote 
democracy worldwide through modern medium such as the 
internet.  Our investigation yielded no overt ties to groups 
that support pedophilia.

complying with this request was 4.5 hours.
