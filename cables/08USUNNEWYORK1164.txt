SUBJECT: NEW YORK: DFI NEGOTIATIONS UPDATE 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Ambassador Khalilzad met with Iraqi PR Bayati on 
December 9 to discuss a draft Security Council resolution 
renewing immunities for Iraqi assets including the 
Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) and extending the 
International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB).  The 
Ambassador encouraged Bayati to focus on getting yes votes 
from Russia, South Africa, Indonesia and Libya, urging Bayati 
to use the Arab League to lobby Libya and South Africa, and 
the OIC to lobby Indonesia.  Bayati said he would do so 
immediately, and noted that FM Zebari would likely arrive in 
New York on December 14 to lobby for adoption of the 
resolution.  Bayati said he had spoken to the Russian Deputy 
PermRep, who told him that Moscow in general had no problem 
with the resolution, but would probably request more 
oversight by the Security Council, including reports and/or 
briefings on DFI/IAMB. 
 
¶2. (SBU) USUN distributed the draft resolution to the P5 on 
December 9 and to the full Council on December 10, with 
possible adoption on December 17.   In preliminary reactions 
from the P5 expert level on December 9, Russia said (tracking 
with what Bayati told Amb. Khalilizad) that it would ask for 
DFI/IAMB briefings by both the UN and the IMF.  Russia noted 
that they would like to increase Council oversight of 
DFI/IAMB.  (Note:  Last December, the Security Council 
received a DFI/IAMB briefing by the UN Comptroller, but an 
attempt to schedule a briefing with the IMF in Washington was 
not successful.  End Note.)  France also intimated that it 
would agree to increased oversight by the Security Council. 
A possible solution is to include language in the resolution 
to schedule either quarterly or 6-month briefings on 
DFI/IAMB. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  USUN is pursuing the following timeline for 
adoption of the DFI/IAMB renewal resolution: 
 
December 9: Distribution to the P5 
December 10: Distribution to the full Council 
December 12: First meeting of Council experts to discuss the 
resolution 
December 15 (if necessary): Second meeting of Council experts 
December 16: Resolution goes into "blue" 
December 17: Adoption (and possible UN Comptroller briefing 
on DFI/IAMB)
