Classified By: POLOFF DAVID ALLEN SCHLAEFER FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Poloff spoke with Veikko Suralahti in the Office for 
Caribbean and Central American Affairs at Finland's MFA and 
confirmed that there has been no change in Finland's policy 
toward or contacts with Cuba since Ref. B was drafted. 
Finland does not have an Embassy in Havana and has little 
contact with the Cuban Government.  There is no direct 
bilateral development assistance from Finland to Cuba, and no 
current plans for such assistance in the future.  Finland 
supports and will continue to support the EU common position 
on Cuba.

of trade with Cuba: 
 
2003:

Imports:  9.210 million Euro
