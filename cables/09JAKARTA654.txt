¶1.  (U) This message was coordinated with Consulate Medan. 
It is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Polling in Aceh was smooth and calm on 
election day, despite tensions and intimidation in the run-up 
to the legislative elections.  Security was tight, with 
police and military on duty in small numbers at each polling 
station.  Foreign observers from the U.S. Mission, the Carter 
Center and elsewhere were well dispersed across the province, 
helping to safeguard peaceful and fair elections.  Septels 
review the situation nationally and in Papua.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SMOOTH IN ACEH 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Aceh legislative elections were pleasantly 
uneventful, according to a wide spectrum of observers we 
consulted after noontime closing of polls on April 9.  In 
contrast to several months of sporadic political violence and 
intimidation preceding the elections, election-day incidents 
were limited to mistakes on the registration rolls, crowded 
polling stations, and other such glitches common across 
Indonesia. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Organizers from Partai Aceh (PA), the party of 
former separatists, complained of threats at one polling 
station in the political tinderbox of Central Aceh Province. 
A PA leader in Central Aceh also called us complaining that 
large numbers of PA supporters were not listed on the rolls 
in one area, but this type of problem also occurred in other 
parts of the country.  However, even former Free Aceh 
Movement (GAM) local political leaders told ConGen Medan that 
they are pleased with the fair process so far. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The only real concern at this point is proper 
tallying of the votes, although political party monitors were 
present at all the polling stations observers visited. 
Furthermore, seven Carter Center observers in Aceh will be 
watching the vote counting process.  PA is largely expected 
to garner a large plurality of the vote (reftel). 
 
SECURITY TIGHT 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Security was tight but non-threatening at polling 
stations.  Small numbers of police and military were posted a 
proper distance from the polls, although in some cases they 
were posted right outside the stations, not allowed by 
election rules.  Some observers witnessed poll workers being 
overly helpful with voters, assisting them to mark ballots 
and to put ballots in the boxes. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) A Finnish diplomat witnessed police, rather than 
elections officials, instructing voters to return home to get 
their registration letters at a station in Aceh Besar, 
northern Aceh.  Police asked this diplomat and two diplomatic 
colleagues from Finland and Germany to go to a police station 
for brief questioning, the only election day report of 
problems for observers.  U.S. Mission and Carter Center 
observers all received full support by authorities in 
observing the election.  In the isolated western coast, which 
receives less foreign scrutiny, voters and officials at 
polling stations met U.S. Mission observers nervously. 
 
VOTING FOR ITS OWN LEGISLATURE--WITH ITS OWN PARTIES 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Aceh was unique nationwide as the only province 
allowed to have local parties compete for local legislative 
seats, a component of the 2005 Helsinki peace MOU.  This 
factor contributed to tension in these elections, as 
anti-separatist elements are worried that a strong PA showing 
could lead to a referendum for independence.  This is an 
unlikely outcome.  While complex dynamics in this formerly 
war-torn province could still spark post-election conflict in 
the coming months, the apparent smooth and fair conduct of 
this election bodes well for continued consolidation of 
peace.  Carter Center observers will remain in Aceh for at 
least another month to scrutinize the process and U.S. 
diplomats will continue to visit Aceh frequently. 
 
¶9.  (U) Septels review the situation nationally and in Papua.
