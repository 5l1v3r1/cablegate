REFERRALS, REPATRIATIONS 
 
¶1. (U) In an August 5 meeting with Emboff, International 
Organization on Migration (IOM) Interim Country Director 
Meltem Ersoy asserted that an increase in TIP victim 
referrals from the GOT to IOM is a direct result of 1) a 
series of IOM-funded law enforcement training sessions that 
focus police efforts on screening potential victims; 2) a 
growing commitment at the Ministry of Interior (MOI) to 
combat trafficking; and 3) the establishment of NGO 
facilities in Istanbul to shelter victims while police 
conduct anti-TIP investigations.  "At this time last year," 
Ersoy noted, "we couldn't have imagined that the police would 
be so cooperative," Ersoy said. 
 
¶2. (U)  Ersoy noted that since January 2004, the MOI has 
referred 37 victims to IOM for repatriation.  IOM provided 
the following details about the victims:
