¶10. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:  The MediaOn event is an annual 
international seminar on online journalism and journalist from all 
over Brazil, Latin America and Africa will be in attendance.  The 
main topics for this edition will be: electoral coverage on the web 
(exploring the fact that this year is also a municipal election year 
in Brazil) and social networking sites.  The event is organized by 
Terra Networks Group and Instituto Cultural Itau, with whom the U.S. 
Mission in Sao Paulo has an excellent working relationship, and is 
supported by CNN and BBC Brazil. 
 
It is evident that changes in communication technology may play an 
important role in influencing electoral behavior.  The Internet may 
enhance voter information about candidates and elections, and in 
turn stimulate increased participation. The Internet has become a 
potent political tool in terms of campaigning, fundraising, and 
civic engagement.  Brazilian audiences often look to U.S. internet 
sources for models of efficient use of the internet- election 
politics is no exception.  Not surprisingly, Brazilian media sources 
have noted that 33 percent of younger U.S. voters have gotten 
political news and information from social networking sites. 
Especially for presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama, the net 
has been a boon to fundraising. More than $100 million, or 40 
percent of his money, has come from online contributions.  Seminar 
attendees have a high interest in learning more about this internet

phenomenon and also how campaigns use social networking sites to 
attract traditionally hard-to-target teens and young adults to sites 
such as MySpace, Hi-5, Bebo and Facebook.
