SUBJECT: CSI VISIT FIRMS UP TURKISH SUPPORT FOR PROGRAM 
 
REF: ANKARA 3464 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Representatives from DHS, DOE, USCG and post 
visited Izmir June 14-16 to assess the port's suitability for 
participation in the DHS Container Security Initiative (CSI). 
 The two-day visit included meetings with Turkish officials 
from Customs, Foreign Trade, the Coast Guard, the Maritime 
Authority, the Railroads Authority (who currently is 
responsible for port operations), and the Izmir Exporters 
Association and a tour of the port on one of its busiest days 
of the week.  CSI's willingness to go forward with the 
assessment succeeded in increasing Turkish support for the 
program.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  In what was categorized by CSI officials as a 
well-organized event, Turkish and USG officials met June 
14-16 in Izmir to discuss the CSI program and to conduct 
DHS's assessment of the port, one of the necessary 
requirements for implementing CSI in Turkey.  DHS, DOE, USCG 
and embassy representatives met with a Turkish delegation, 
led by Atilla Bastirmaci, Head of America's Department at the 
GOT Foreign Trade Undersecretariat (FTU), that included 
officials from Turkish Customs, Coast Guard, Maritime 
Authority, Railroads Authority (who currently hold 
responsibility for port operations), and the Izmir Exporters 
Association. 
 
¶3.  The meetings provided an excellent opportunity for the 
two sides to discuss in detail the program and its 
implementation process in Turkey.  Turkish officials were 
able to express their concerns and expectations about 
starting the program and stationing personnel in Izmir as 
well as to clarify information and procedures.  One of the 
most positive outcomes of the visit was the support for the 
program gleaned from the exporters in Izmir after they were 
able to directly question CSI officials about the program and 
its potential effects on their business.  At a subsequent 
meeting in Izmir, representatives from the exporters 
association told us that they are very enthusiastic about the 
program.  We encouraged them to communicate this support to 
Turkish government officials. 
 
¶4.  Comment:  The CSI team's visit increased Turkish support 
for the program and renewed the enthusiasm of those in the 
Turkish government who have supported it from the beginning. 
We will turn our efforts now to working on a final CSI 
agreement document that will meet the needs of the parties 
involved.  End comment.
