SUBJECT: FINLAND RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON SYRIA 
 
REF: STATE 150032 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Charge delivered subject demarche to Finnish MFA 
Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Markus Lyra 
September 13.  She emphasized that the US and EU share 
the goal of preventing new hostilities in Lebanon and 
the rest of the region, but that our views on contacts 
with Syria continue to differ.  She outlined carefully 
the four principles that underpin our Syria policy, and 
reminded Lyra that EU contacts with Syria over the past 
year have not yielded a positive change in the SARG's 
behavior. 
 
¶2. (C) Lyra responded by thanking Charge for sharing the 
principles that guide our Syria policy and by calling our 
points "totally valid;" the EU agrees that Syria's 
behavior needs to change in all four areas.  However, he 
reminded, the EU has concluded it must reach out to all 
parties who can have an impact on promoting peace in 
Lebanon and the wider region.  Syria is indeed a bad 
actor, Lyra said, but it is "a relevant party" and 
therefore one with whom the EU wants to have dialogue. 
"The Union is united in our approach," he said, adding 
that even France's objections to contacts with Syria have 
been "overstated."  In any case, Lyra said, the GOF and 
the EU appreciate US concerns and views, and would seek 
to reflect those views in any future conversations with 
the SARG.
