¶1. (U) Summary: Rwanda is a net importer of staple foods and supports 
initiatives aimed at improving agricultural productivity, increasing 
access to science and technology and removing barriers to trade in 
staple 
foods.  The government of Rwanda (GOR) does not impose any official 
export 
restrictions on staple foods although some local infrastructure and 
market 
barriers continue to inhibit local and regional food distribution.  The 
GOR is cognizant of the benefits of biotechnology and mindful that 
biotechnology products are becoming a reality in the region. 
Legislation 
governing national biotechnology and biosafety policy for Rwanda is 
currently in Parliament pending approval.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Emboffs met with Acting Secretary General Ministry of 
Agriculture - 
Pelagie Mukayiranga - and presented talking points of reftels a,b,d. 
The 
Acting Secretary General noted that Rwanda does not currently have 
sufficient domestic production of rice, wheat and maize and imports 
most 
food staples.  Mukayiranga advised she was "not aware of any export 
restrictions" on agricultural staples and said the GOR supports 
measures 
that would improve regional food distribution.  Local barriers to trade 
such as high transportation costs, inefficient market information 
systems 
and inadequate food storage facilities continue to inhibit local food 
distribution (Ref E). 
 
¶3. (U) Separately, Emboffs spoke with Mark Bagabe - Director of the 
Ministry of Agriculture Research Institute - who advised that a draft 
law 
governing biotechnology and biosafety is currently pending 
parliamentary 
approval.  Bagabe noted that the GOR was "mindful of the realities of 
GM 
(genetically modified crops) and biotechnology" and aware that both 
Kenya 
and Uganda are moving forward with biotechnology programs.  Bagabe 
agreed 
that biotechnology is needed to advance regional food security but was 
not 
able to advise when the new law would be approved or implemented.
