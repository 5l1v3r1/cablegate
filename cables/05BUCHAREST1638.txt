(SBU)  Poloff discussed coordination of constitutional 
assistance to Iraq July 15 with MFA Director for the Middle 
East, Asia and Africa, Andreea Pastarnac, providing her a 
nonpaper that stressed the importance of the international 
community's support for Iraq's constitutional process (Ref). 
During a July 18 follow-up conversation, Pastarnac told 
PolOff that Romania remains committed to tangibly assisting 
the development of democratic institutions in Iraq.  She 
noted that Romania had, indeed, committed to providing 
support for constitutional reform, although there are no 
programs currently underway.  She added, however, that 
Romania plans "institutional reconstruction" support for the 
Iraqi justice sector, as well as other areas (Septel).  She 
also stated that the GOR would welcome further suggestions 
from the U.S. in regard to possible support it could provide 
to further of Iraq's constitutional process.
