SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  In May 2008, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of 9 Embassy registered property claims. With the 
inclusion of these 9 claims resolved in May, the GON has so far 
resolved 21 claims during the 2007-2008 waiver year.  The Property 
Office database now includes 647 unresolved registered property 
claims belonging to 305 Amcits.  To date, most resolutions have 
involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds 
 
("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of May 31, 2008, the 
GON has issued BPIs with a face value of $336,998,984 to 
Embassy-registered claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, 
the Ortega administration has resolved a total of 26 claims, 21 
during this waiver year.
