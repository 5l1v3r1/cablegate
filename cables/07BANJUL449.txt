SUBJECT: CASAMANCE REBELS SKIRMISH IN THE GAMBIA 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Post received a note verbale addressed to all 
diplomatic missions in The Gambia, dated August 16, from the 
Department of State (Ministry) for Foreign Affairs, 
documenting two casualties (one death) from an encounter 
between rival Senegalese rebel groups along the Casamance 
border on July 31.  The note indicates that a skirmish 
occurred between the Jakai and Salif Sarjo rebels in the 
vicinity of Bai Pol Village in Foni Kansala, a constituency 
in the Western Division of The Gambia, resulting in civilian 
casualties.  This was reportedly documented by senior Gambian 
officials who visited the village.  One of the villagers was 
hit in the arm by a bullet, while another was hit in the 
chest and killed.  Enclosed with the note were rather 
gruesome pictures of the victims and their wounds. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The note verbale also conveys to the Senegalese 
authorities the GOTG's "grave concern over the incident, 
particularly the loss of life," and stated that the GOTG 
"will no longer tolerate such incidents."

¶3.  (SBU)  This is the first Post has heard of the reported 
incident.  It appears the shootings were not intentional, but 
the uncharacteristic note verbale to all diplomatic missions 
and gruesome photos seems to indicate the GOTG is trying to 
milk the incident for international sympathy in the ongoing 
Casamance dance between Senegal and The Gambia.   We will 
report on any further information we receive.  END COMMENT
