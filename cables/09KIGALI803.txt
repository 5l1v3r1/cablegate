¶1. (U) Summary: On November 28th, Commonwealth heads of 
government meeting in Trinidad and Tobago decided to admit 
Rwanda as their group's newest member.  Although concrete 
benefits to membership appear modest, Rwandan officials 
anticipate expanded business and trade opportunities and 
welcome the opportunity to join another regional grouping 
that embraces globalization, trade and economic integration. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U)  Rwandan Foreign Minister Rosemary Museminali told the 
local press November 29th that Rwanda is "looking forward to 
working with our new partner states to strengthen economic, 
trade, cultural and political ties" and affirmed Rwanda's 
commitment to contribute to the group's aspirations including 
promoting peace and prosperity in the region.  Rwanda's 
formally launched its bid to join the Commonwealth in 2007, 
supported by the UK, Australia, Canada, India, South Africa, 
as well as its East African neighbors Kenya, Tanzania and 
Uganda. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Commonwealth is a club of 54 nations with a 
population of more than two billion and $2.8 trillion in 
annual trade.  Rwanda is only the second country, after 
Mozambique, to join the organization without having a British 
colonial past or constitutional link to Britain.  In addition 
to potential trade, business linkages and economic benefits, 
UK poloff explained to us that by joining the Commonwealth, 
Rwanda could more easily access technical assistance programs 
offered by Commonwealth professional associations and NGOs. 
A variety of scholarship programs benefiting Commonwealth 
members would also become available, the poloff added. 
 
¶4. (U)  Comment:  Rwanda's successful bid to join the 
Commonwealth is consistent with its ambition to become a 
regional trade hub, broaden its economic base through 
regional integration and attract new investment by building 
partnerships with larger trading blocks.  Senior Rwandan 
leaders have also pointed out that joining the Commonwealth 
is not incompatible with continued membership in 
Francophonie, the association of French-speaking countries, 
and that they intend to remain part of that grouping as well. 
 End Comment.
