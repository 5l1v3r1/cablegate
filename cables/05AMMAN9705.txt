OCV VOTE COUNT PROCEEDS SMOOTHLY 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) OCV vote-counting in Jordan began separately at 
each of the thirteen individual voting sites on Friday, 
December 16 at 8:00AM.  Vote counting at the five sites 
visited by Embassy observers proceeded smoothly, 
professionally, and without incident.  A large number of 
political party observers, as well as International Mission 
for Iraqi Elections (IMIE) and other NGO observers, were 
noted at each site. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Several party observers had notebooks and were 
carefully noting each vote as the ballots were read out. 
Both IMIE and Allawi's campaign headquarters in Jordan told 
Emboff that they had personnel stationed throughout the day 
at each polling station in Jordan and reported no 
significant problems. 
 
PRELIMINARY OCV TURNOUT BREAKDOWN 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Amman-based Independent Election Commission of 
Iraq (IECI) OCV chief Hamdia al-Husseini gave Emboff at 
4:00PM a preliminary and approximate country-by-country 
breakdown of Iraq OCV voter turnout worldwide.  Preliminary 
breakout follows: 
 
Australia - 12,000; Austria - 1,500; Canada - 9,000; 
 
Denmark - 13,500; Germany - 27,500; Iran - 59,000;

NO DECISION ON PUBLISHING OCV VOTE RESULTS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) IECI's Husseini told Emboff that plans for further 
handling of OCV ballots and voting results are still being 
studied.  She asserted that no decision has been made to 
publish country-by-country OCV voting results as opposed to 
turnout.  Emboff noted that OCV voting results were 
available after the January, 2005 elections.  Husseini said 
she will seek guidance on the issue from IECI headquarters 
in Baghdad.
