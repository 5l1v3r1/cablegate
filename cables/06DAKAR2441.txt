¶1.  In general, Guinea-Bissau has little in terms of water drainage, 
sewage canalization or treatment, or waste management.  Although 
there exists a bountiful water table, the country lacks adequate 
infrastructure to efficiently access it.  When Bissau's Director of 
Urban Planning, Alfredo Antonio da Silva, was asked what his office 
needed most, he replied, "Maps."  The aerial maps on which 
infrastructure projects are based date back to 1986.  During the 
past 20 years, there have been different migrations -- before, 
during, and after the civil war -- with many people having returned 
to Bissau to reconstruct homes often without registration or 
permits.  These migrations have led to people building anywhere, 
without organized parceling, permits, or building codes.  The 
general lack of building organization is a major cause of flooding, 
fires, and disease outbreaks.  Up-to-date aerial maps would allow 
the city government to better design infrastructure projects and to 
manage their registration system. 
 
¶2.  Dutch NGO SNV ended a project in 1994 that improved Bissau's 
parceling system and installed a new drainage system in 10-15 new 
areas outside of the old city.  Approximately 7,000 city dwellers 
relocated into new homes in the areas, built with materials provided 
in-kind by GOGB.  However, the rest of the city is still largely 
without drainage.  Although there are a few colonial era gutters on 
a few streets downtown, they fill up with trash and contribute to 
the street floods that cause frequent cholera outbreaks. 
Guinea-Bissau's residents for the most part have septic tanks or 
outhouses.  No sewage system exists. 
 
¶3.  Celina Tavares Monteiro, the Vice President of Bissau's city 
council, cites trash as the main sanitation problem in the urban 
areas.  The current landfill in Mantula is close to overflowing and 
floods often, and there are not enough trucks or funds to collect 
all of the city's garbage.  The city council is conducting a 
feasibility study to locate a new landfill site, to create a 
recycling center, to place trash bins strategically around the city, 
and to implement a new, graded, fee based trash removal service. 
They need new trucks, truck repairs and more drivers.  The city 
government manages trash collection and disposal with its own budget 
funded by property, gas and sales taxes collected from local 
businesses.  They receive no federal financing and have an annual 
budget of approximately 1.1 billion CFAF (USD 2.2 million) with most 
revenues coming from land sales and business taxes.
