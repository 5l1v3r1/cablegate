SUBJECT: APPARENT CHANGES IN GOC MANAGEMENT/LOGISTICS 
POLICIES 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: USINT has noticed several changes in the 
way the GOC is handling management/logistics issues that may 
indicate some changes in policy. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The following is a list of apparent policy changes 
regarding management/logistical issues between USINT and the 
GOC: 
 
      - Increase in local staff hiring: CUBALSE, the Cuban 
government employment office that services diplomatic 
missions, has begun to provide candidates for local staff 
positions.  A year ago USINT had close to 50 local hire 
vacancies; now there are less than 20. 
 
      - Increase in facilities maintenance support: After 
waiting more than a year, the GOC provided a crane last week 
to lift an 8-ton air conditioning chiller onto the roof of 
the Interests Section.  The Cuban agency responsible for 
providing houses to USINT personnel recently has been 
noticeably more responsive in maintaining and repairing our 
properties.  The Refugee Annex project, which languished for 
almost two years, was completed last month. 
 
      - Increase in pre-approvals to import supplies and 
equipment: Though the GOC rejects some 25% of unclassified 
pouches, it has increased the number of pre-approvals to 
import official supplies and equipment via sea and air 
freight, rather than the pouch.  During the first week of 
April we received seven pre-approvals (for items as diverse 
as automobile parts, fire detectors, and air conditioning 
Freon) and no refusals.  During the same week, only two 
pouches were rejected. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) There have been other noticeable aesthetic changes 
around the Interests Section, which may be the result of 
policy decisions, including: 
 
      - Offensive signboards removed: Two especially 
offensive large billboards facing the Interests Section - one 
comparing President Bush to Adolph Hitler and the other with 
a thinly veiled sexual innuendo - have been dismantled. 
Another anti-American billboard at the end of the block has 
also come down.  in all cases the frames remain, so it could 
be a short-lived reprieve.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  On the other hand, the clumsy hostility remains. 
After months of neglect, rust and deterioration, the GOC has 
shown renewed interest in sprucing up the "flag farm" in 
front of the Interests Section.  The poles have been painted 
(without removing the rust, however) and outfitted with new 
Cuban flags replacing the former black flags.  We'll see how 
long the Cuban flags, which are already shredding in the 
steady Malecon wind, will last.
