ENGAGEMENT REGARDING LEBANON 
 
REF: STATE 52061 
 
¶1. (U) On May 14 the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
released the following statement on the recent violence in 
Lebanon. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic 
condemns the attempts to solve the constitutional crisis in 
Lebanon in a violent way and appeals to all parties concerned 
to immediately cease violence and refrain from further acts 
of violence.  In this critical period we appeal to all 
parties involved to return to their dialogue in order to come 
to a compromise.  We fully support the efforts of the 
government of Prime Minister Siniora to ensure security and 
stability in the territory of Lebanon.  The reopening of 
Rafik Hariri International Airport and restoration of its 
regular operation will as well undoubtedly help to ease the 
situation. 
We evaluate the active role played by the League of Arab 
States and support its efforts leading to the solution of the 
impasse in Lebanon.  Its three-item plan should become the 
starting point leading to the solution of the present crisis. 
 
All the relevant resolutions adopted by the UN Security 
Council must be fulfilled.  First of all, the disarmament of 
all militias, including Hezbollah, must be achieved in 
Lebanon.  We welcome the establishment of the Special 
Tribunal for Lebanon in accordance with the UN Security 
Council's Resolution 1757. 
End of Czech Statement. 
 
¶2. (SBU) While this statement addresses many of the issues 
raised in Ref A, Embassy Prague still attempted to contacted 
several key Czech MFA officials to discuss USG concerns 
regarding the need to improve the bargaining position of the 
Lebanese government, condemn violence, and address Hizballah. 
 Given the concurrent travel of key Czech officials, however, 
post has only been able to convey these concerns to an 
official within the Czech Middle East Department that does 
not normally cover Lebanon.  If and when post receives a 
response to these specific concerns, post will provide an 
update.
