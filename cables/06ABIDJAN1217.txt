1)  (U)  On October 30, Econ Chief delivered demarche and 
non-paper attachments in reftel A and B to Deputy Director 
General Joachim ANVIRE of UN Affairs at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
 
2)  (SBU)  Concerning reftel A, ANVIRE indicated that issues 
concerning Lebanon are particularly sensitive to Cote 
d'Ivoire, considering the country's large and commercially 
influential Lebanese contingent.  The government of Cote 
d'Ivoire is therefore attentive to the suffering of the 
Lebanese people, and in general is disposed to vote for 
resolutions made on their behalf.  However, in this instance, 
recognizing Cuba's willingness to exploit issues in order to 
put the U.S. in an uncomfortable position, ANVIRE said he 
would explore with the Ivorian Mission at the UN as well as 
his superiors at the MFA whether Cote d'Ivoire could abstain 
from upcoming votes on UNGA Agenda Items 63(a) (The Situation 
of the Lebanese Children) and 67(b) (Consequences of the 
Israeli Invasion on the Human Rights Situation in Lebanon). 
 
3) (SBU)  Econ Chief also discussed talking points in reftel 
¶B.  ANVIRE said he would communicate his government's 
position on the continuing appropriateness of the referenced 
anti-Israel bodies once his government has had the 
opportunity to consider the matter.
