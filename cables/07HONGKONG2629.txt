¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
pre-license checks (PLCs) at Cyber On-Air (Asia) Ltd. (Cyber 
On-Air), Unit 309, Fook Hong Industrial Building, 19 Sheung Yuet 
Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong and Companhia de Telecomunicacoes de Macau 
S.A.R.L., Rua de Lagos, Telecentro, Taipa, Macau (CTM). The PLCs 
concerned a cesium clock valued at USD 30,692.  The license 
applicant is Symmetricom Inc., of San Jose, California.  The item is 
classified under ECCN 3A002 and is controlled for national security 
reasons (NS). 
 
¶3.  Cyber On-Air is a Hong Kong registered company that has been in 
existence since 1994.  Its directors are Hong Kong residents Choi, 
Wing Kin and So, Kam Wing.  The paid-up capital of the company is 
the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 12,500. 
 
¶4. On October 5, 2007, the ECO visited Cyber On-Air at the address 
above and met with Ms. Connie Wong, Sales Admin Officer.  Ms. Wong 
provided a general overview of the company (consistent with 
information on the company's web site: www.cyberonair.com).  The 
company serves primarily Hong Kong and Macau based customers.  CTM 
is a long-standing customer of Cyber On-Air.  Ms. Wong provided the 
ECO with a copy of the CTM purchase order to Cyber On-Air.  In this 
transaction, Cyber On-Air is the distributor for Symmetricom and 
will provide installation and other support as well. 
 
¶5.  CTM has been providing a range of telecom services in Macau 
including fixed line, mobile, internet and IDD related services 
since the 1980s. Cable & Wireless of the United States is a 51% 
shareholder.  Other major shareholders are CITIC Pacific and 
Portugal Telecom.  Additional information is available at 
www.ctm.com.mo. 
 
¶6.  On October 9, 2007, the ECO visited CTM at the address 
referenced above and met with Mr. Filipe Antonio, General Manager, 
Transport Network, Network Operations.  Mr. Antonio provided an 
overview of CTM (summarized above) and then described the purpose 
behind CTM's intended purchase of the cesium clock.  Mr. Antonio 
stated that CTM will use the item as a network timing device. 
Presently, CTM uses GPS receivers for these purposes but these are 
subject to radio interference.  CTM is familiar with Symmetricom 
products and has elected to purchase this item based on their 
positive experiences with Symmetricom products.  Mr. Antonio 
provided the ECO with a copy of the purchase order for the item as 
well as a copy of the CTM end-user statement.  Mr. Antonio also 
showed the ECO where the clock will be installed within one of CTM's 
switching rooms. 
 
¶7. At the time visited, both Cyber On-Air and CTM appeared to be 
suitable recipients of the subject controlled item since they 
cooperated with the PLCs and their activities are consistent with 
the use of the ordered item.  The ECO recommends that this PLC be 
Favorable.
