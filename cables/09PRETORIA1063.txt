DST Contacts See Advantages in Pandor's Political Connections 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶12.  (U) DST working staff does not see Pandor's lack of S&T 
credentials as a problem because she is an experienced Minister. 
DST contacts comment that Pandor will probably initiate new science 
development programs, especially in the education arena.  They note 
that she has championed educational reform aimed at improving the 
quality of math and science teaching at lower levels so that high 
school students will be prepared for universities.  One contact 
notes that Pandor has been interacting with the broader scientific 
community as part of this process and thus has a familiarity with 
some S&T groups. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Comment: Few Substantive S&T Policy Changes Expected 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶13.  (SBU) Comment.  Naledi Pandor is the first S&T Minister from 
the ANC.  This may mean that her initiatives will be implemented 
with greater success than those of her predecessors Mosibudi 
Mangena, who came from the Azanian People's Organization (AZAPO), 
and Ben Ngubane, who came from the Inkatha Freedom party (IFP). 
Pandor is expected to push for better science education at the 
primary and high school levels.  No major policy shifts are expected 
in S&T issues.  End Comment.
