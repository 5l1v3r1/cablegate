SUBJECT: JERUSALEM OLD CITY SHOOTING 
 
 
¶1.  (U) At approximately 11:15 a.m. local time August 10, an 
unknown Palestinian male assaulted an Israeli security guard, 
took his firearm, and shot him in the shoulder at an Ateret 
Kohanim yeshiva in Jerusalem's Old City Christian Quarter, 
according to Israeli press.  A second security guard chased 
the attacker through the Old City and killed him.  Press 
reported that eight to eleven people were wounded during the 
chase by shots and ricocheting bullets.  According to initial 
reports received by ACS, no U.S. citizens were involved in 
the incident. 
 
¶2.  (U) Press reported that police raised the alert level in 
the Old City and that Jaffa Gate was closed immediately 
following the attack.  Magen David Adom rescue services 
transported the injured to hospitals.  Four reportedly 
received medium injuries, and the rest were injured lightly. 
 
¶3.  (U) Security sources reported publicly that the attacker 
was approximately 20 years old and carried no identification. 
 Shin Bet and the police are attempting to locate his family. 
 A witness told Israel Radio that the guard continued 
shooting after it was clear that the attacker had been 
killed, but Jerusalem District Police Commander Aharon Franco 
defended the guard's response as "professional". 
Commissioner of Israeli Police Dudi Cohen said after police 
had been deployed throughout the Old City that East Jerusalem 
was at maximum security and safe for visitors. 
 
¶4.  (U) RSO sent out an SMS message to all Consulate 
employees and eligible family members instructing them to 
stay out of the Old City until the end of the day.
