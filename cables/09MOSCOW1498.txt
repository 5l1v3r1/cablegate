REFTELS: REQUEST #4210014; DATED 5/19/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, T-Platforms, Moscow, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license applications: NLR as 
the ultimate consignee of one infiniband switch and accessories, 
auto processing units and transmission equipment. The licensee is 
Silverstorm Technologies, 680 American Ave., Suite 100, King of 
Prussia, PA 19406. 
 
¶3. On June 4, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of T-Platforms, Leninsky Prospekt 113/1, 
Suite E-715, Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Lia 
Ketiladze, Head of Procurement Department. 
 
¶4. T-Platforms was established six (6) years ago by the current 
General Director Vsevolod Opanasenko and has approximately 100 
employees. T-Platforms rents a factory inside a facility that is 
closed to non- Russians. T-Platforms claims to produce turn-key 
integrated hardware/software solutions for high performance 
computers (HPC) optimized for each customerQs specific needs. 
T-Platforms offers a wide range of products for high performance 
computers and data centers, including cluster systems and 
shared-memory Linux-based supercomputers, servers, storage systems 
and any architecture, cluster system and management software. 
T-Platforms performs a full production cycle and support for its HPC 
solutions, from project design to warrantee and post-warrantee 
support. T-Platforms is the only Russian-based company to hold a 
number of patents related to supercomputers and develop proprietary 
supercomputer components. 
 
¶5. The export control team was not able to conduct a site visit of 
T-Platforms business operations and on-site security. Lia Ketiladze 
advised the export control team that its production facility is 
secure and has the necessary manned guard and electronic access 
security features to make it compliant with obtaining controlled 
items from the United States.  Ketiladze stated that T-Platforms has 
its own research and development department and has produced two 
 systems to date that are on the top 500 list for supercomputers. 
The export control team found no indications of impropriety at 
T-Platforms. The consigneeQs answers were not evasive and the reftel 
commodity appears to be used for the end use for which it was 
licensed. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends T-Platforms, Moscow, Russia, as 
a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
