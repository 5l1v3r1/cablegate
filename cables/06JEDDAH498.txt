¶1.  On July 22, Econ Counselor met with two senior Islamic 
Development Bank officials in Jeddah.  They are Amadou 
Boubacar Cisse (VP for Operations) and Rami Ahmad (Deputy 
Director of Operations in charge of Middle East projects). 
Cisse briefed on Iraq, Gaza and more generally on how the IDB 
makes project decisions: 
 
--  IRAQ. The IDB allocated $500 million for Iraq in 2005, 
for a five-year period.  Consulting with the Iraqi government 
it selected education and electricity as the top priorities. 
To date, it has approved only one project, worth $12.8 
million, to build 15 elementary schools and train teachers, 
including by the World Bank in Washington.  The IDB is aware 
of the UN/World Bank trust funds but prefers to fund 
countries directly, and is awaiting the Iraqi Government to 
provide further projects for IDB staff evaluation. 
 
--  Iraqi Central Bank Governor Sinan al-Shabibi visited the 
IDB last year, at which time the IDB cleared out overdue dues 
unpaid by Saddam and restored Iraq to full IDB membership. 
 
--  GAZA. Cisse said the proposed Egypt-Gaza electricity 
transmission project is under technical review, and not fully 
approved as yet by the IDB Board. IDB projects for the 
Palestinians are often done directly with contractors and not 
funded through the Palestinian Authority, he said. 
 
--  IDB at the Singapore meeting.  IDB President Madani leads 
the IDB delegation to the annual Bank/Fund meetings in the 
Fall and will be in Singapore in September.  VP Cisse 
generally leads the IDB delegation to the annual Bank/Fund 
Spring meetings in Washington. 
 
--  Who Makes IDB decisions?  The IDB has 56 member 
countries, and not all have Muslim majorities (Russia has 
applied for observer status).  There are seven permanent 
board members:  Saudi, Kuwait, UAE, Iran, Turkey, Libya, and 
Egypt.  The three Gulf countries contribute the majority of 
the IDB's capital (Saudi is the largest with 22 percent, 
roughly the same as US's contribution to the World Bank) and 
thus together can control project allocation, per Cisse. 
 
¶2.  Comment:  IDB staff described Cisse as a former PM of 
Niger and former World Bank staffer of some 15 years.  On 
Iraq, IDB appears to rely heavily on the World Bank for 
information. For instance on the proposed Iraq Compact 
meeting of July 20, IDB was planning on getting a readout 
from the World Bank office in Amman, though the IDB received 
an invitation to attend.
