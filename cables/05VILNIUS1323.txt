DELEGATION TO AFGHANISTAN COMPACT 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 226670 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 227560 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered ref A and B points regarding the 
upcoming January Afghanistan Compact in London and the 
proposed troop drawdown in Afghanistan to Vytautas 
Leskevicius, head of the MFA's NATO division, on December 21. 
 We also delivered ref B points December 20 to Alvydas 
Kunigelis, Acting Director of the MOD's International 
Relations department. 
 
Afghanistan Compact 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Leskevicius said that the GOL had not yet received a 
formal invitation to the Compact but expects to participate 
with MFA Undersecretary Dalius Cekuolis likely heading the 
Lithuanian delegation.  Leskevicius said that he could not 
comment on any new financial pledges from Lithuania, since 
internal discussions are ongoing and will continue until 
mid-January.  Leskevicius mentioned that FM Antanas Valionis 
hopes to push the European Commission and the EU to pledge 
substantially towards reconstruction, possibly including 
funds for provincial reconstruction teams. 
 
No Worries about Troop Reductions 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Leskevicius did not have any immediate comment on 
the drawdown, but asked about USG plans for troop levels in 
Iraq.  Drawing on recent guidance, we explained our 
benchmarks, and how the USG will reevaluate deployment levels 
as democracy, security and reconstruction improve and as NATO 
assumed a larger role.  Kunigelis, who had previously 
received the same guidance, said that the news of the 
drawdown neither concerned nor surprised the GOL.  He said 
that he had seen a short media report on the drawdown and 
welcomed the additional details we provided.
