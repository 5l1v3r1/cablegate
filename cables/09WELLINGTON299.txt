REF: 09 STATE 112828; State 098567, USUN 0958 
 
¶1.  (U)  PolOff delivered Reftel demarche to Michael McBryde, 
MFAT's United Nations, Human Rights and Commonwealth Division 
Deputy Director and encouraged GNZ to support USG's position during 
the November 4 UNGA Goldstone Report debate.  Mr. McBryde met 
separately with MFAT's Middle East Division and UN Division 
Directors to discuss this demarche prior to responding. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  According to McBryde, Foreign Minister McCully is 
following this issue closely and intends to be in phone contact 
with Jim McClay, NZ's UN permanent representative during the 
debate.  GNZ views this as a "fast moving situation", and its 
response will crystallize as events unfold.  McBryde did say that 
the proposed resolution language is surprisingly mild which 
indicates that the Palestinian delegation authors are seeking to 
build a broad support base.  The resolution currently calls upon 
both Israel and the Palestinians to investigate alleged human 
rights abuses.  If the final version is altered and demands only 
Israeli investigations, GNZ will not vote for it. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  GNZ will not support a resolution endorsing the 
Goldstone Report.  Instead, it prefers language that "takes note" 
of the report and its recommendations.  GNZ is not concerned about 
attempts to direct the Security Council (SC) to take up this matter 
because the SC decides which topics it will discuss, and GNZ 
believes that it is unlikely to add this debate to its agenda. 
According to McBryde, the current resolution text does not mention 
sanctions or make any reference to the International Criminal Court 
or the International Court of Justice, and GNZ does not believe 
that these options will be suggested during the debate.  Finally, 
GNZ is not opposed to time limits for completing investigations 
into alleged abuses. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U)  McBryde stated that there is a robust, ongoing dialogue 
between our two countries' UN delegations regarding the Goldstone 
Report, and he is confident that this will continue during the Nov 
4 debate.
