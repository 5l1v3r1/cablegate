¶1. (U) Deputy Senior Advisor on Iraq Robert Deutsch and his 
State and DoD team visited Skopje April 5-6 to thank GOM 
officials and parliamentarians for Macedonia's support for 
international efforts in Iraq, and to discuss developments in 
Iraq.  (NOTE: Macedonia currently has 40 troops deployed to 
Iraq in support of MNF-I.)  Deutsch and his team met with 
Deputy Foreign Minister Hasanovic; CHOD MG Stojanovski; MOD 
State Secretary Petroski; the national security advisers of 
the Prime Minister and the President; and with the Chairs and 
Deputy Chairs of the Parliamentary Defense and Foreign Policy 
Committees.  They also met with Macedonian Special Forces 
troops who had served in Iraq. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Referring to the U.S. as Macedonia's "strategic 
partner," Deputy FM Hasanovic outlined Macedonia's active 
contributions to the war on terror, especially in Iraq, and 
said the government would continue that support in the 
future.  He said the GOM was proud to be part of the 
international effort to bring security and development to 
Iraq, and indicated that Macedonia would be willing to do 
even more to support that effort if necessary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Both the CHOD and MOD State Secretary echoed 
Hasanovic's remarks concerning Macedonia's continuing 
commitment to the Iraq effort.  They also reiterated the 
offer to provide three officers to the NATO Training 
Mission-Iraq, and said they were awaiting an official reply 
from NATO to that offer.  The CHOD noted the expense involved 
in supporting their Iraq and Afghanistan deployments and 
expressed the hope that Macedonia's U.S. Foreign Military 
Financing funding would -- at a minimum -- be restored to 
previous years' levels. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Parliamentary Foreign Policy Chair Teuta Arifi told 
the team that there had never been any dilemmas or doubts 
about Macedonia's support for the Iraq effort.  Responding to 
a question about whether upcoming parliamentary elections 
might delay parliamentary approval of the mandate for the 
next rotation of Macedonian troops to Iraq, Arifi said the 
U.S. could "count on a timely renewal."  Arifi added that "we 
want an Iraqi success story," underscoring how crucial that 
would be for the region as a whole.  In a subsequent 
discussion, the national security advisers to the Prime 
Minister and the President both reassured the Deutsch team 
that there would be no delay in the approval of the June 
mandate for the next troop rotation. 
 
¶5. (U) Comment: The interagency team's visit to Skopje was 
much appreciated by Macedonian interlocutors, who were 
pleased to hear USG words of praise for Macedonia's 
contributions.  The visit received positive press coverage in 
the country's most prominent foreign affairs newspaper and in 
several other media outlets.  Although political and public 
support for Macedonia's deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan 
remains strong, the visit nevertheless was a useful exercise 
in coalition maintenance, and allowed the GOM to underscore 
its longer-term commitment to the Iraq effort.
