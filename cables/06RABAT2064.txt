IMPLEMENTATION OBLIGATIONS 
 
REF: STATE 178365 
 
¶1.  (U) Per reftel, Poloff met November 3 with Azzedine 
Farhane, Chief of the United Nations Division at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, to urge Morocco to fulfill its Article 
VII national implementation obligations, including the 
implementation of national legislation that criminalizes 
activities prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention 
(CWC).  Farhane was accompanied by UN Division Disarmament 
officer Siham Mourabit.  Farhane explained that Morocco's 
latest draft text of the implementing legislation had 
recently been finalized by the Ministry of Justice and 
approved by Morocco's National Authority, which since January 
2005 has been the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  (Note: Prior 
to January 2005 the Ministry of Trade and Industry was 
responsible for the National Authority and CWC 
implementation. End Note.)  According to Farhane, the draft 
text of the legislation is currently with the Government's 
Secretary General awaiting approval.  Farhane added that once 
 
SIPDIS 
the Secretary General approves the draft text, the 
legislation will then be sent to the Council of Government 
(chaired by the Prime Minister), then to the Council of 
Ministers (chaired by the King), followed by the Parliament 
for adoption.  Once adopted by the Parliament, the 
legislation must be published in the official bulletin before 
going into effect.  Poloff left behind reftel talking points 
as a non-paper with Farhane. 
 
¶2.  (U) Mourabit added that the MFA was currently in the 
final stages of developing Morocco's national plan, which she 
hoped would be delivered to the OPCW at December's meeting. 
Mourabit, however, hinted that Morocco may need more time 
since the plan will require interagency review. 
 
¶3.  (U) In closing, Mourabit explained that Morocco is 
preparing for the Sixth Review Conference of BWC States 
Parties scheduled to begin November 20 and wondered what 
position the United States will take at the meeting.  Post 
would appreciate any information that could be passed to the 
GOM regarding the U.S. position.
