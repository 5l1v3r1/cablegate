¶1.  U.S.-Israel Relations 
 
¶2.  Mideast 
 
¶3.  Israel-South Africa Relations 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
HaQaretz reported that a Qsenior AmericanQ conveyed a message to PM 
Benjamin Netanyahu demanding that Israel not surprise the U.S. with 
an Israeli military operation against Iran.  Israel Radio quoted a 
senior Israeli diplomatic source as saying that Israel acceded to 
the U.S. administrationQs demand.  The radio reported that 
NetanyahuQs emissaries -- Uzi Arad, Yitzhak Molcho, and Ron Dermer 
-- are preparing NetanyahuQs trip to Washington.  As a note of 
speculation, Israel Radio reported that two weeks ago CIA Director 
Leon Panetta visited Israel on behalf of President Obama.  Leading 
media reported that yesterday members of NetanyahuQs coalition urged 
him Qnot to give in to pressureQ regarding the two-state solution 
during his visit to Washington. 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe quoted IAF commander Maj. Gen. Ido Nehushtan as 
saying yesterday that Israel has no answer to the rocket problem. 
He was quoted as saying that Syria is devoting most of its efforts 
to developing missiles.  However, The Jerusalem Post quoted him as 
saying that the Iron Dome missile system, which is designed to 
intercept Qassam and Katyusha rockets from Gaza will be deployed in 
¶2010. 
 
The media reported that the trial of former president Moshe Katsav 
will open at Tel AvivQs District Court today.  He is accused of rape 
and other sexual offences. 
 
All media reported that yesterday Pope Benedict XVI branded the West 
Bank separation fence a symbol of "stalemate" between Israel and the 
Palestinians, urging both sides to break a "spiral of violence." 
The pope also called for "a sovereign Palestinian homeland." 
"Towering over us, as we gather here this afternoon, is a stark 
reminder of the stalemate that relations between Israelis and 
Palestinians seem to have reached -- the wall," he said, standing by 
the fence at a refugee camp in Bethlehem.   He held a Mass in 
Nazareth this morning.  Maariv reported that Interior Minister Eli 
Yishai has rejected on security grounds a Vatican request to issue 
entry visas to 500 priests from Arab countries.  Maariv reported 
that the Pope and Netanyahu will discuss the issue today. 
 
HaQaretz cited a forecast by the PAQs Central Bureau of Statistics 
that within seven years the populations of Arabs and Jews between 
the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea will be equivalent. 
 
HaQaretzQs Washington correspondent described the recruitment and 
training process of CIA agents, who she says are required to visit 
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum before being assigned to 
positions overseas. 
 
HaQaretz reported that Palestinian interest in the intentions of the 
new Israeli government tends to focus on one small area in the West 
Bank, Ma'aleh Adumim and its environs, particularly the area known 
as E1 linking the settlement to East Jerusalem.  E1 is the only area 
that Benjamin Netanyahu explicitly committed to developing, on the 
eve of February's elections.  His political rival, Labor Party 
chairman Ehud Barak, also publicly expressed support for building 
there.  In an unrelated development, HaQaretz reported that 
yesterday the High Court of Justice issued an interim injunction 
asking the state to justify within 90 days why it does not evacuate 
the unauthorized West Bank outposts of Givat Assaf, MaQaleh Rehavam, 
Mitzpe Yitzhar, and Mitzpe Lakhish. 
 
Israel Radio reported that yesterday the Security Council reviewed a 
UN report blaming Israel for attacks on the organization's buildings 
during the Gaza offensive, but went no further than expressing 
concern about its findings. The members of the council expressed 
their concern about the findings of the report.  The Council has not 
brought to a vote a draft resolution by Libya, the Council's lone 
Arab member, which would condemn the Qdirect and intentional Israeli 
military strikes against United Nations premises." 
 
HaQaretz reported that President Shimon Peres will meet with King 
Abdullah II in Jordan on Sunday to discuss the regional peace 
process.  Peres is expected to stress the commitment of the 
Netanyahu government to the peace process and interest in holding 
negotiations with the Palestinians.  HaQaretz quoted Foreign 
Ministry sources as saying that Peres was invited to take part in 
the Davos Forum in Jordan.  Netanyahu was also reportedly invited, 
but he will not attend due to his trip to Washington, but he may 
visit Amman to visit the King. 
 
Maariv reported that FM Avigdor Lieberman will make an official 
visit to Russia in early June.   Leading media reported that 
yesterday Lieberman and British Foreign Secretary David Miliband 
issued a joint statement expressing deep concern about IranQs 
nuclear ambitions and its actions meant to destabilize the region. 
 
The Jerusalem Post and other media quoted Nidal Kabalan, the newly 
appointed Syrian Ambassador to Ankara, as saying on Tuesday that 
Syria is reportedly ready to resume Turkish-mediated talks with 
Israel, despite NetanyahuQs statements that he would not cede the 
Golan in a future peace agreement with Damascus. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Norwegian Ambassador to Israel 
Jakken Biorn Lian told the newspaper yesterday that the 
international communityQs major donors to the Palestinians are 
satisfied that mechanisms now exist to enable the flow of 
reconstruction funds into Gaza while bypassing Hamas. 
 
Maariv quoted the Italian daily Corriere Della Sera that Italy has 
acceded to IsraelQs request that it help in thawing relations with 
Libya. 
 
Major media reported that Israel has announced that it will open an 
embassy in TurkmenistanQs capital of Ashgabat, located just 32 
kilometers from the Iranian border. 
 
HaQaretz reported that the naming of the square at the entrance to 
Jaffa for Yossi Carmel, the late military attache and one of the 
founders of Tel Aviv University, has angered local residents, who 
want the square be named in honor of the Nobel Peace Prize winners 
Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin. The square, to be dedicated tonight, 
abuts the well-known Jaffa clock tower. Residents say they want the 
landmark to bear a name that represents co-existence between Jews 
and Arabs.  HaQaretz quoted Saliman Setel, leader of the southern 
branch of IsraelQs Islamic Movement in the city, as saying: "The 
[Tel Aviv-Jaffa] Municipality does all these things as if there were 
no Arabs living in Jaffa." 
 
HaQaretz reported that a classified Iranian document regarding the 
allegations of spying against Iranian-American journalist Roxana 
Saberi cited five visits she made to Israel. 
HaQaretz reported that on Sunday the America-Israel Cultural 
Foundation will resume distributing grants.  It had lost most of its 
funds to Bernard MadoffQs scheme. 
 
HaQaretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that on Tuesday President 
Obama declared May Jewish-American Heritage Month, saying: "The 
United States would not be the country we know without the 
achievements of Jewish-Americans."  He called on all Americans to 
"commemorate the proud heritage of Jewish-Americans with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities," noting that "unyielding in the face of 
hardship and tenacious in following their dreams, Jewish-Americans 
have surmounted the challenges that every immigrant group faces, and 
have made unparalleled contributions."  He noted the contribution of 
American Jews to U.S. government at all branches, as well as to the 
U.S. Armed Forces.

¶1.  U.S.-Israel Relations: 
-------------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Liberal columnist Uzi Benziman wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv: QWe can assume that Netanyahu will carry [the] weight [of 
his first term] with him when he leaves in a few days for a meeting 
with President Obama. 
 
Political columnist Matti Tuchfeld  wrote in the independent Israel 
Hayom: QA crisis with the United States may be caused as a result of 
stating half-truths and making promises that we do not plan to keep. 
 Netanyahu, it is quite likely, will refrain from this. 
 
Liberal columnist Larry Derfner wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post: QI feel no inner conflict in rooting for 
Obama against Netanyahu, because I trust the U.S. administration's 
commitment to this country's well-being.   Beyond trusting Obama, I 
trust America.

¶I.  "Washington Won't Buy It" 
 
Liberal columnist Uzi Benziman wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv (5/14): QOne of the main criticisms of Netanyahu's actions as 
prime minister in the years 1996-1999 was over his inability to 
maintain good relations with the U.S. administration.... We can 
assume that Netanyahu will carry this weight with him when he leaves 
in a few days for a meeting with President Obama.... Not only is 
Israel now facing a young, opinionated and innovative American 
administration, but Netanyahu's performance up until now, in his 
second term as prime minister, corroborates the diagnosis that this 
is the same Netanyahu from ten years ago.  It is enough to observe 
the portfolio distribution in his government, the ideological 
contradiction embodied in the coalition's composition, the 
decision-making process on the state budget and his conduct toward 
his fellow ministers and toward top officials in order to be 
convinced that the frenzied days of 1996-1999 are on their way back. 
 No polished speech or nicely phrased proverb will cover up for the 
internal turmoil. 
 
II.  QThey'll Agree Yet 
 
Political columnist Matti Tuchfeld  wrote in the independent Israel 
Hayom (5/14): QContrary to the common depictions of pressure and 
approaching conflict with the United States, U.S. President Barack 
Obama believes in the exact same method: to start from the 
grassroots.  It is true that for Israelis it is unpleasant to hear 
of the dialogue that the United States plans to hold with Iran amid 
the latter's progress in attaining a nuclear weapon; but in fact, if 
one listens closely to Obama, another significant aspect is to be 
found: one cannot fail to notice that that the American president is 
unwilling to say how he sees the process with Iran coming to an end. 
 And the same could be said about Cuba or North Korea.... Such is 
also the case with the supposed pressure.  Obama is indeed 
attempting to promote a process at the end of which there will be 
two states for two peoples, but after his meeting with Netanyahu he 
will understand that this cannot practically be achieved without a 
process of peace building and the recognition of the Palestinians of 
Israel as a Jewish state.... A crisis with the United States may be 
caused as a result of stating half-truths and making promises that 
we do not plan to keep.  Netanyahu, it is quite likely, will refrain 
from this. 
 
III.  QYes to Obama, No to Bibi 
 
Liberal columnist Larry Derfner wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (5/14): QWe all know what the two-state 
solution entails, and we all know that the Obama administration is 
in favor of it and the Netanyahu government is against it.... There 
is no peace camp left in this country, there is no opposition, there 
is no potential leader or alternative government that might reverse 
the nation's course.   The only loyal opposition is Obama, and I 
stress the word QloyalQ.... This is why I feel no inner conflict in 
rooting for Obama against Netanyahu, because I trust the U.S. 
administration's commitment to this country's well-being.   Beyond 
trusting Obama, I trust America.   I may disagree with this or that 
U.S. policy, but I have total confidence that America wants Israel 
to thrive, that it will never deliberately sabotage this country's 
vital interests.  I know it from history.   Every single U.S. 
president from Harry Truman to George W. Bush has been a friend to 
Israel, in different ways, and I have no doubt that Obama will be 
one, too.

¶2.  Mideast: 
------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Settler leader Israel Harel wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
HaQaretz: QA demographic majority is not enough to maintain Jewish 
sovereignty for the generations to come in Israel.  Sovereignty also 
depends on a geographic majority.

"Forever the Land Shall Not Be Sold" 
 
Settler leader Israel Harel wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
HaQaretz (5/14): QA demographic majority is not enough to maintain 
Jewish sovereignty for the generations to come in Israel. 
Sovereignty also depends on a geographic majority.  The Basic Law on 
Israel Lands was passed to insure that this would be the case in the 
distant future, so Qownership shall not be transferredQ (from the 
state to individuals).... State lands, in addition to their intended 
purpose for housing, farming or public use, are the fundamental 
asset for promoting the Jewish people's national goals in its 
historic homeland.  We must not have a policy of hiding our heads in 
the sand.  The members of the Arab nation who live among us are 
trying to take over Israel Lands Administration property out of 
openly declared motives of nationalist interest, and in the Galilee 
and Negev they are succeeding.  Now, with state lands to be offered 
to all comers -- foreigners, directly, or through Israeli straw 
companies -- will be able to institute a hostile takeover (money and 
motivation to act against Israel are not in short supply in the Arab 
oil countries) of a good part of Israel's land reserves that were 
intended for the generations to come.  And the Jewish state -- how 
long will it last?

¶3.  Israel-South Africa Relations: 
---------------------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Senior foreign affairs commentator Adar Primor wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning HaQaretz: QIf the new Israeli 
administration continues to oppose the two-state solution, South 
Africa will have a pretext for downgrading relations. 
 
Block Quotes:

"Zuma and the Original Sin" 
 
Senior foreign affairs commentator Adar Primor wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning HaQaretz (5/14): QIsrael is in large part 
still paying for its original sin -- forging comprehensive security 
ties with the Apartheid regime and Qselling its soul and morality to 
a racist, oppressive devil.Q  In the words of former South African 
ambassador to Jerusalem Fumanekile Gqiba: QIsrael must refrain from 
putting a question mark in front of our relations with the 
Palestinians.  It must remember that it was, in the past, of the 
same flesh as the apartheid regimeQ.... If the new Israeli 
administration continues to oppose the two-state solution, South 
Africa will have a pretext for downgrading relations.  For [incoming 
South African President Jacob] Zuma, Benjamin Netanyahu's verbal 
contortions of Qeconomic peaceQ and Palestinian QautonomyQ simply 
will not suffice.
