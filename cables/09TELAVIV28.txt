¶1.  This is a joint Embassy Tel Aviv and Consulate General 
Jerusalem message. 
 
¶2.  Due to ongoing military activities in the Gaza Strip, and 
ongoing rocket fire at southern Israeli cities (including a strike 
on the south Tel Aviv suburb of Rehovot on January 6), and regular 
demonstrations in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Embassy Tel Aviv 
and Consulate General Jerusalem request Department assistance with 
deferring all non-Mission Critical visitors at this time.  Embassy 
and Consulate General resources have been strained by demands 
associated with the situation in Gaza and southern Israel, and we 
are unable to provide support for non-essential travel.  We 
appreciate the Department's assistance with this matter, and will 
review our visit support capabilities as events unfold.
