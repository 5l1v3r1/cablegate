REF: STATE 151767 
 
¶1. Poloff on November 8 conveyed to the MFA reftel points 
urging China to support the conclusions of the 
Independent External Evaluation (IEE) of the United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and to support a 
leaner budget for the FAO.  MFA International Organizations 
and Conferences Department Economics Division Deputy Director 
Guo Xuejun offered no substantive reply but said that China 
would seriously consider U.S. views. 
 
¶2. FAS Beijing on November 9 conveyed the points to Ministry 
of Agriculture Department of International Cooperation 
Director Luo Ming.  Luo said China supports the reform of the 
FAO, but he was non-committal on China's support for the IEE 
in its entirety and for the lean FAO budget.  Given the 
expected controversy surrounding these two issues, China is 
still considering its position and consulting with other 
countries.  China does not expect to make a final decision 
until the FAO Conference begins, Luo said.
