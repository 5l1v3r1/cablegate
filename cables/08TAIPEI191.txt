SUBJECT: 2008 G/TIP INCLE AND ESF FUNDING PROPOSALS: TAIWAN 
 
¶1. Summary: Per G/TIP instructions, AIT submits five 
trafficking in persons project proposals for ESF and INCLE 
funding. One proposal is from a Taiwan university, three 
proposals are submitted by Taiwan non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), and one proposal is submitted by the 
Department of Justice, Office of Overseas Prosecutorial 
Development, Assistance and Training (DOJ/OPDAT).  The 
proposals have been ranked according to AIT funding 
preferences.  Post will email to G/TIP the full proposals for 
the projects listed below.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Proposal 1: Training for Taiwan TIP Prosecutors 
 
(A) Applicant Name: Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of 
Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training 
(OPDAT) 
 
(B) Funding Requested: $228,748 
 
(C) Project Title: Intermittent Legal Advisor position in 
Taipei 
 
(D) Project Duration: Three-month startup, intermittent 
follow-up visits. 
 
(E) Proposal Abstract: Current Taiwan laws are particularly 
insensitive in treating trafficking victims and witnesses. 
There is poor cooperation between local law enforcement and 
NGOs.  TIP victims are often unwilling to cooperate with 
government officials, and without their testimony, 
traffickers often receive light sentences.  DOJ/OPDAT 
proposes to post an Intermittent Legal Advisor (ILA) to 
Taipei on a TDY basis, for up to 3 months, to implement a 
package of TIP programs that would include specialized 
support to the Taipei High Court prosecution unit and locally 
designated prosecutors, training for local prosecutors with 
emphasis on treatment of victims and witnesses in TIP cases 
and encouraging greater cooperation by prosecutors with NGOs, 
with the goal of increasing sentences rendered in TIP cases. 
The ILA would be a highly qualified current federal 
prosecutor, selected from the ranks of DOJ's most experienced 
anti-TIP attorneys. 
 
¶3. Proposal 2: Increasing Access to Migrant Services for 
Indonesian Migrant Workers 
 
(A) Applicant Name: International Catholic Migration 
Commission (ICMC) 
 
(B) Funding Requested: $499,869 
 
(C) Project Title: Increasing Access to Migrant Services for 
Indonesian Migrant Workers in Taiwan 
 
(D) Project Duration:  15 months 
 
(E) Proposal Abstract: ICMC proposes a three-part project to 
improve access to shelter, legal assistance, counseling, and 
medical services for Taiwan's large population of Indonesian 
foreign workers.  Part One: ICMC will compile an island-wide 
directory of service providers for migrant workers, to be 
disseminated by government offices, NGOs, places of worship, 
and other facilities.  ICMC will conduct "sensitization 
workshops" for Muslim religious leaders and Indonesian 
migrant worker associations to encourage their increased 
assistance to Indonesian workers, especially TIP victims. 
ICMC will host formal dialogues between Muslim religious 
leaders and existing migrant worker service providers to 
increase cooperation and to foster service referrals.  Part 
Two: ICMC will enhance the capacities of three different 
service providers through training and small grants.  ICMC 
will arrange for counseling, shelter management, and legal 
assistance experts to conduct training workshops for the 
designated service providers, each of which will also receive 
approximately $25,000, to be used to hire Indonesian-speaking 
Muslim women as outreach workers, and to defray TIP victims' 
 
TAIPEI 00000191  002 OF 003 
 
 
legal assistance and repatriation expenses.  Part Three:  To 
encourage the Indonesian government to more effectively 
engage with the Taiwan government, ICMC will collaborate with 
the Indonesian Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Taiwan 
NGOs to document and report the challenges faced by 
Indonesians working in Taiwan. 
 
¶4. Proposal 3: Multidisciplinary Community Response Model 
 
(A) Applicant Name: Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF) 
 
(B) Funding Requested: $98,422 
 
(C) Project Title: Establishment of a Multidisciplinary 
Community Response Model 
 
(D) Project Duration: One year 
 
(E) Proposal Abstract:  To organize a one year research 
project aimed at building a multidisciplinary community to 
focus on the prevention of human trafficking, protection of 
trafficking victims and prosecution of traffickers.  The 
process will begin at a local level with the establishment of 
a community task force.  This task force should incorporate 
policymakers, law enforcement, and NGOs.  The task force will 
implement awareness-raising activities and training programs 
for local law enforcement officials, NGOs and other potential 
service providers.  The goal is to improve knowledge of 
victim identification and to build partnership to enhance 
coordination and cooperation among the different sectors 
involved.  The TWRF will serve as the community-based 
advocate to coordinate training programs targeting law 
enforcement officials and potential service providers. TWRF 
will also conduct surveys of local law enforcement officials, 
NGOs, and other service providers to determine the adequacy 
of resources currently available to trafficking victims, 
obstacles to adequate care, and recommendations for 
improvement. 
 
¶5. Proposal 4: Coordinated Victim Protection Program 
Conference 
 
(A) Applicant Name: Garden of Hope Foundation (GOH) 
 
(B) Funding Requested: $100,955.40 
 
(C) Project Title: Combating Human Trafficking Through a 
Coordinated Victim Protection Program; 
 
(D) Project Duration: 8 months 
 
(E) Proposal Abstract: GOH proposes a three-day training 
conference to help government officials, law enforcement 
agencies, prosecutors, and NGOs develop an integrated 
protection system for trafficking victims, including shelter, 
medical care, legal aid, social welfare services and 
immigration services.  After the conference, GOH will publish 
a report on the current state of protections for TIP victims 
in Taiwan.  GOH will also publish a handbook, written by 
conference trainers, aimed at overcoming the difficulties 
associated with the establishment of an integrated protection 
system for TIP victims. 
 
¶6. (U) Proposal 5: Local and International Team Building 
 
(A) Applicant Name: Department of Political Science and 
Graduate Institute, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) 
 
(B) Funding Requested: $100,550 
 
(C) Project Title: International Cooperation on Combating TIP 
- A Team Building Perspective 
 
(D) Project Duration: One year 
 
(E) Proposal Abstract: Taiwan has difficulty fostering 
 
TAIPEI 00000191  003 OF 003 
 
 
international cooperation because it lacks formal diplomatic 
relationships.  Cooperation with labor source country 
governments is also limited by language, distance, and 
networking difficulties.  NCKU proposes improving 
cross-border anti-TIP cooperation by building teams of TIP 
experts from Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, 
Thailand, and if possible, China.  These teams (including 
police, immigration officers, prosecutors, and academics) 
will conduct research, and will meet in Taiwan and in the 
aforementioned labor source countries to discuss and 
formulate mechanisms to improve cross-border cooperation 
between government agencies, NGOs, and other entities 
involved in combating TIP.  The expert teams will also 
generate training programs and materials for law enforcement 
officials in Taiwan and other participating countries.  These 
meetings will culminate in an international conference to be 
held in Taiwan.
