Discussion on Sand Exports to Taiwan 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. At the November 14 regular Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) 
press briefing, spokesperson Fan Liqing introduced DG Tang 
Wei and DG Liang Shuhe of the Ministry of Commerce and TAO 
Deputy Director Li Jiansheng to report on the current 
situation of a ban on sand exports to Taiwan and discussions 
held yesterday with six Taiwan companies on how to push for 
the early resumption of sand exports to Taiwan. 
 
TAO Defers to MFA on U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. When asked for comment on the United States Defense 
Department announcement of its intention to sell Patriot 
missile upgrades to Taiwan, Fan told reporters that the MFA 
had already answered the question. (See reftel for a report 
of the Chinese demarche to the Charge on this issue.) 
 
Stamps Propagate "Taiwan Independence" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Responding to a question on "UN membership referendum" 
stamps issued in Taiwan, the spokesperson said the stamps 
constitute "flagrant manipulation" of the Taiwan Post Company 
for the purpose of "propagating Taiwan independence," violate 
Taiwan compatriots' freedom to communicate across the Strait 
and with foreign countries, and have "of course" been 
received by the Taiwan people with protest and condemnation. 
Fan said the Taiwan Post Company has realized letters with 
"referendum" stamps are being returned from the Mainland, a 
result for which only the Taiwan authorities can be held 
responsible. 
 
Willing to Negotiate on Basis of 1992 Consensus 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. The TAO announced a "common will" (gongtong de yuanjing) 
with the KMT in 2005 to resume negotiations and discuss any 
issue on the basis of the 1992 Consensus.  This was in 
response to a request for comment on KMT presidential 
candidate Ma Ying-jeou's reported intention to support a 
"peace agreement" with the Mainland if the Mainland removes 
missiles aimed at Taiwan. 
 
DPP Should Remove Trade Barriers 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked for comment on Frank Hsieh's reported comments on 
cross-Strait trade policy, opening and developing Taiwan 
investment in the Mainland and granting amnesty to Taiwan 
businessmen who have broken Taiwan laws of investment on the 
Mainland, Fan acknowledged that the TAO has seen the relevant 
reports.  She added that the DPP should remove obstacles to 
cross-Strait economic exchange and cooperation. 
 
"Unification Referendum" Ads in Taiwan 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Peaceful development ought to become the main topic in 
cross-Strait relations, said Fan, when asked about 
advertisements in Taiwan in favor of a "referendum on 
 
BEIJING 00007097  002 OF 002 
 
 
unification" sponsored by United Microelectronics Corporation 
Honorary Chairman Robert H.C. Tsao.  She described the 
promotion of peaceful development of cross-Strait relations 
and opposition to Taiwan independence as "positive efforts" 
that deserve approval and encouragement. 
 
Fugitive Wang Yujun, Journalism Cooperation, More 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶8. Other questions were asked on topics of fugitive Wang 
Yuyun, cross-Strait journalism cooperation, Taiwan insurance 
companies on the Mainland and organ transplant specialist Dr. 
Zhu Zhijun's reported travel to Taiwan.
