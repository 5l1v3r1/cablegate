¶1. (SBU) Summary: On November 14, Finance Minister Zakhilwal told 
U.S. Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for Technical Assistance 
Policy Larry McDonald and Ambassador Wayne that the U.S. Treasury's 
technical assistance support had helped strengthen his Ministry's 
credibility and transparency.  Minister Zakhilwal said corruption is 
a serious challenge within MoF but reiterated his determination to 
eradicate it.  He also stressed his hope to focus on several top 
reforms in the year ahead that will improve service delivery to the 
population.  Zakhilwal asked that more resources be channeled 
through Afghanistan's core budget since public financial management 
systems are now sound enough to handle larger inflows.  Minister 
Zakhilwal credited U.S. support as being crucial to GIRoA's 
negotiations with the IMF and in the HIPC debt relief process.  End 
summary. 
 
SEEKING DEMAND-LED GROWTH IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE 
 
¶2. (SBU) Visiting DAS McDonald confirmed Treasury's ongoing 
commitment to Afghanistan and asked the Minister about additional 
needs for technical assistance.  The Minister requested assistance 
to strengthen the audit functions in the Ministry of Finance's (MoF) 
Budget and Treasury departments and provincial Ministry offices 
(Mustofiats).  Minister Zakhilwal stated that Treasury support has 
been critical to modernizing the budget process in his Ministry. 
Moving forward, he would like to see the budget become more 
innovative and include incentives.  Internal audit capacity needs to 
be significantly strengthened before the MoF can take full advantage 
of the recent reinstatement of Article 61, a World Bank Afghanistan 
Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) benchmark which enables MoF to 
audit other GIRoA agencies.  Minister Zakhilwal also wants to 
implement a new tax collection system within the Provincial 
Mustofiats whereby revenues are remitted to the Revenue Department 
instead of to the Administration Department, both under the Ministry 
of Finance.  He emphasized that growth in technical assistance 
should be demand-driven and organic. 
 
NEW REFORM AGENDA TO COMBAT CORRUPTION 
 
¶3. (SBU) Minister Zakhilwal stated that Afghanistan is on a path 
toward a "new beginning," emphasizing the need to improve the donor 
community's trust in GIRoA. Once the new Cabinet is established, he 
will begin work on a reform package that will be driven by the GIRoA 
and supported by the U.S. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In response to Ambassador Wayne's question on the reform 
agenda, Minister Zakhilwal said he will propose a plan at the next 
Joint Coordination Management Board (JCMB) meeting to use funds from 
the Civilian Technical Assistance Plan (CTAP) (ref: Frej/Z cable) to 
carry out targeted reforms at the top 5-6 ministries responsible for 
80-90% of GIRoA's economic development initiatives.  He said reforms 
will focus on up to ten areas selected by the potential to increase 
service delivery, reduce corruption, and increase government 
revenue. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Minister Zakhilwal emphasized the importance of building 
capacity in tax collection and non-tax revenue.  Non-customs revenue 
from the provinces remains very low.  While improving tax collection 
capacity is more difficult than increasing customs capacity, it will 
provide a more sustainable source of revenue over the long term. 
The Minister will also enforce stronger collection efforts on such 
high money flow areas as wedding halls, rents in expensive 
neighborhoods in Kabul, and large international companies. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Minister Zakhilwal highlighted the recent anti-corruption 
success of firing customs officials at the Kabul Airport. These 
high-ranking airport administrators are currently on administrative 
leave and likely to be replaced.  Minister Zakhilwal said that he 
monitored the case himself after receiving two tips (one from the 
U.S. Embassy), and he estimated that $30-50 million dollars may have 
been diverted from government coffers by the alleged offenders. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Note: This law enforcement action was handled by Minister 
Zakhilwal's personal bodyguards, who had no formal authority to make 
arrests.  This raises a red flag that Afghan officials may be prone 
to using extra-legal methods to combat corruption.  Such methods can 
produce quick results but ones that may not stand up in a court of 
law.  Zakhilwal told Ambassador Wayne that he had called Interior 
Minister Atmar to get a proper investigation under way.  End note. 
 
LIMITING TAX EXEMPTIONS ON FOREIGN FIRMS 
 
¶8. (SBU) Minister Zakhilwal stated that large international 
contractors hired by U.S. and other foreign assistance agencies have 
 
KABUL 00003724  002 OF 002 
 
 
sought unwarranted and excessive tax exemptions that protect their 
profits from sales to non-assistance-related activities.  He 
believes that his Revenue and Customs Departments have granted 
50-60% more tax exemption than is appropriate.  Moving forward, he 
stated that MoF needs to know specific details of each foreign 
assistance contract to ensure international firms are not exploiting 
their tax-exempt status. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Note: The U.S. mission has noticed an uptick in putative 
MoF enforcement measures against contractors, many of which violate 
the terms of bilateral agreements between the USG and Afghanistan. 
We are able to resolve most issues at the working level, but it is 
clear the MoF sees contractors, who are fully tax-exempt under the 
Status of Forces Agreement and other bilateral agreements, as 
potential sources of revenue and will continue to explore the limits 
of the broad existing agreements. (Note: In a conference in Kuwait 
last year, the military committed to a principle of sharing 
contracts and contract values with Afghan Ministry of Finance, to 
ensure that local firms winning business opportunities would pay 
appropriate taxes).  End note.
