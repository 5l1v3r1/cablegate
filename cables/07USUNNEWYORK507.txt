RWANDA'S PROSECUTOR GENERAL NGOGA DISCUSSES COMPLETION 
STRATEGY 
 
 ¶1.    Amb. Gerald Scott, USUN Senior Area Adviser for 
Africa,and USUN Legal Adviser Carolyn Willson met on June 21 
with Rwanda's Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga and the GOR's 
representative to the ICTR, Mutabingwa Alloys, at their 
request, to discuss Rwanda's role in the ICTR's completion 
strategy. Ngoga was in New York to address the Security 
Council on June 18 and to meet with Council members to convey 
Rwanda's views on the process of winding up the Tribunal. 
Ngoga thanked the U.S. (as he had done in his public 
statement) for assistance with capacity building and noted 
that an American NGO is working to organize a donor's 
conference. 
 
¶2.  Ngoga also raised the issue of ICTR fugitives and the 
Security Council's role in bringing them to justice.  He 
noted a recent arrest in Philadelphia and several in Europe, 
but said that European states have not yet acted to extradite 
detainees that they hold to Rwanda.  Ngoga said Council 
assistance is needed to oblige member states to arrest 
fugitives and extradite them to Rwanda. 
 
¶3.  The Legal Adviser noted the timeliness of the meeting 
since the Council members are just beginning discussions with 
Tribunal officials on steps to be taken to prepare for 
closing the Tribunals. It was clear, she said, that Rwandan 
judicial authorities have a key role to play during this 
period and their input is important.  She urged Ngoga to 
provide points in writing to members of the Council and to 
continue a dialogue as discussion of "legacy" issues 
progresses.  This could be done on a bilateral basis or by 
participation in the informal meetings which are taking place 
in New York between Council members and representative of 
interested states (Netherlands, Tanzania). 
 
¶4. Comment.  These Rwanda jurists made an impressive 
presentation.  They are deeply engaged and have obviously 
given careful consideration to Rwanda's role in the post ICTR 
period.  Their perspective is well informed and their input 
important.  USUN will encourage other Council members to 
include Rwandan representatives in plans for future work on 
Tribunal issues. End Comment.
