¶1.  (U) Summary.  At a breakfast meeting at the Ambassador's 
residence on September 15, the Ambassador emphasized to MOL 
Raul Izurieta the importance of combating child labor and 
inquired into current MOL efforts to do so.  Izurieta 
described efforts the Ministry is already taking towards 
eliminating the worst forms of child labor, and looked 
forward to the implementation of the USDOL-funded education 
project.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Izurieta said the MOL will conduct a study, with the 
help of INEC (the National Institute of Statistics and 
Census) to determine the actual number of child workers in 
Ecuador.  Previous studies by UNICEF estimated about 700,000 
child workers while First Lady Ximena Bohorquez, as head of 
INNFA (the Institute for the Child and Family) put the number 
around 1.2 million.  Izurieta believes the number is much 
lower-no more than 300,000. 
 
¶3.  (U) Izurieta expressed appreciation for the Department of 
Labor's planned $3 million education program to combat child 
labor.  Izurieta did not want the money spent on more 
studies, however, and would like "99.9%" of funds to go 
directly to project implementation.  Izurieta also spoke of 
the need for a publicity campaign to raise rural parents' 
awareness of the importance of education for their children. 
Many of these parents pull children out of school to work on 
the family farm.  Izurieta said an awareness campaign was 
needed in the business sector as well. 
 
¶4.  (U) Izurieta also spoke enthusiastically of the work of 
the Banana Social Forum which brings together the government, 
banana industry and unions to combat child labor.  (The 
Banana Social Forum has conducted six inspection methodology 
workshops for inspectors and monitors in Guayas, Los Rios and 
El Oro Provinces.  They have also had six child labor 
awareness workshops for banana employers and workers.) 
Izurieta would like to emulate the model in a 
soon-to-be-created Flower Social Forum targeting Ecuador's 
expanding cut-flower industry. 
 
¶5.  (U) Izurieta said one child labor inspector resigned last 
week but that he would hire four more inspectors this week. 
Izurieta stated he believes his child labor inspectors have 
done a good job of identifying which of the larger companies 
are violating child labor laws. 
 
¶6.  (U) Comment.  We believe Izurieta is willing to "do the 
right thing" on child labor but needs our encouragement to 
push things forward.  Izurieta was eager to maintain a high 
level of communication and work with us on child labor issues.
