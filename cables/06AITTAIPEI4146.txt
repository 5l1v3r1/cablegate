Â¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused their 
coverage December 19 on Taiwan's new regulations on international 
air tickets.  The issue is that abbreviations, codes, and 
information regarding weight allowances on international tickets are 
hard to understand.  Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration has 
therefore summoned airlines for a meeting, and they reached an 
agreement to add Chinese-language explanations to these tickets 
starting July 2007. In terms of editorials and commentaries, 
Commentator Antonio Chiang opined in the mass-circulation "Apple 
Daily" that the Six-Party Talks are never-ending but in vain. 
Chiang elaborated that this is because the Bush administration has 
become a lame duck, and it cannot deal with the nuclear issue in 
Iran and on the Korean Peninsula at the same time.  Chiang suggested 
that the United States allow all countries in East Asia to join the 
nuclear club [in order to solve the DPRK issue].  End summary. 
 
A) "Never Ending Talk" 
 
Commentator Antonio Chiang opined in the mass-circulation "Apple 
Daily" [circulation: 500,000] that (12/19): 
 
"... The United States originally took a strong position toward Iraq 
in terms of the development of nuclear weapons, but now it can do 
almost nothing.  In order to improve the situation in Iraq, some 
have proposed that the United States should improve relations with 
Iran, or even cooperate with Iran.  The Bush administration has 
become a lame duck, and it cannot deal with the nuclear issue in 
Iran and on the Korean Peninsula at the same time. 
 
"Although China and South Korea do not hope that North Korea 
develops nuclear weapons, they are more worried about the disaster 
that will happen after the collapse of the North Korean regime. 
Hence, China and South Korea can only persuade North Korea 
indirectly, and the international pressure has not really pressured 
North Korea. 
 
"Several U.S. experts consider that the United States cannot control 
this situation [of developing nuclear weapons] even if it wants to. 
Why not just let China and South Korea face directly the 
consequences of nuclear weapons [development] in North Korea? Why 
not just let Japan, South Korea, or even Taiwan develop nuclear 
arms, and let them all join the nuclear club?"
