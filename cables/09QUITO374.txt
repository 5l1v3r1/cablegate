EVENTS 
 
¶1. (U) In celebration of World Intellectual Property Day (April 26), 
the Embassy collaborated on several events in Ecuador.  Economic, 
Public Affairs, and Foreign Commercial Service staff obtained 
promotional materials from WIPO and helped organize and support an 
IPR awareness roundtable held by the American Chamber of Commerce. 
The event took place in Quito on April 29, since countrywide 
elections were held on April 26. 
 
¶2. (U) Speakers at the well-attended roundtable included the former 
head of Ecuador's Intellectual Property Institute (IEPI) and current 
IP negotiator in Ecuador's trade talks with the EU, and a famous 
Ecuadorian song-writer, "Damiano."  The former IEPI head discussed 
the importance of IPR protection in developing countries and 
emphasized how IPR can benefit Ecuadorians in many industries.  He 
also noted that Ecuador's requested geographical indications in the 
Andean Community-EU trade talks - Montecristi hats (panama hats) and 
a special type of cacao that only grows in Ecuador - could bring 
major benefits to the country.  Damiano, whose songs are often 
played at football games and on telenovelas (without royalty 
payments), complained that the culture of non-payment of royalties 
to artists in Ecuador has caused a decline in the development of 
local artists and musicians.  He noted that ten years ago there were 
16 CD production companies in Ecuador, and now there are none. 
 
¶3. (U) In addition to the IPR roundtable, the Embassy obtained WIPO 
promotional posters and comic books on copyright protection (in 
Spanish) for dissemination in movie theaters in the major cities of 
Quito and Guayaquil.  The comic books are particularly effective in 
reaching young audiences and explaining the importance of copyright 
protection. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy officials also met with the current President of 
IEPI to encourage the GOE to promote World IP Day, and suggested 
possible activities.  In response, IEPI held IPR awareness events in 
the cities of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca between April 20 and 23, 
calling it "World IP Week."  Using WIPO promotional materials that 
the Embassy brought to their attention, IEPI advertised and held 
roundtables and panels with experts on authors' rights, traditional 
knowledge, and trademarks and patents, among others.  Speakers 
included government officials, lawyers, and experts in biodiversity. 
 
 
¶5.  (U) On May 18, Quito's leading economic newspaper ran a lengthy 
article reporting on joint efforts by a law firm, IEPI, the Attorney 
General's office, and the police to combat trademark piracy.  On May 
20, the same paper published a second lengthy article reporting on 
software piracy, drawing on data from the Business Software 
Alliance. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  In a country where IPR enforcement is weak and 
piracy widespread, it was encouraging to see a relatively concerted 
effort by a number of IPR supporters, including the new head of 
Ecuador's Intellectual Property Institute, to emphasize World IP Day 
and promote IPR awareness.
