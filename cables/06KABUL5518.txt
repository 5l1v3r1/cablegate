SUBJECT: PRT GHAZNI - MULLAHS ADOPT A PRO-GOVERNMENT 
RESOLUTION 
 
 ¶1.  (U) SUMMARY.  At a meeting of Ghazni mullahs 
called by former Governor Sher Alam, the mullahs 
heard a series of speeches stressing the mullahs' 
responsibility, and past failures, to bring peace 
and stability to Afghanistan.  While the meeting 
was taking place, a small group of mullahs 
drafted a seven-point resolution (text below). 
The resolution is pro-government and also reminds 
the government of its role to support Islam. 
There is no information on whether the message 
was later preached in the mosques.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Former Ghazni Governor Sher Alam (whose term 
ended on September 19) called a meeting of Ghazni 
mullahs on September 14.  In his opening address, 
the former governor called on the mullahs to talk 
to the people and to protect them from criminals. 
The Governor stated that due to past disagreements 
which the mullahs should have helped resolve 
but did not, Afghanistan faced many problems. 
The Governor said the lack of unity was a 
root cause of the current security problems.  He reminded 
the mullahs of the accomplishments of the past 
four years (highlighting that there 
is now a legitimate government), and told them 
there is still time to get ride of the criminals. 
He then reminded the mullahs that Islam is a faith 
of peace and that they should not be killing each 
other, adding that Islam says all have the right 
to be free.  He acknowledged that corruption 
exists and asked for the people's help in 
cleaning up the government.  Finally, he called 
upon the public to send their adult sons to join 
the ANA and ANP. 
 
¶3.  (U) Other elders and provincial 
council members continued with the themes of 
responsibility and the legitimacy of the current 
government.  A representative of the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs who was brought to the meeting 
by Coalition Forces, made very strong arguments 
for the normalization of Afghanistan and urged 
the mullahs to preach support for the government. 
He reminded the mullahs of the need to meet with 
the people and noted that all benefit from 
national unity. 
 
¶4.  (U) While the meeting was taking place, a 
small group of attendees worked on a seven-point 
resolution to present to the group.  At the end 
of the meeting the resolution was read aloud and 
circulated for signature.  We cannot confirm whether 
the message was later preached in mosques. 
 
¶5.  (U) PRT translated text from the Ghazni 
Mullah 7-Point Resolution signed by over 40 
Mullahs and read to over 200 present during the 
September 14, 2006 Ghazni mullah shura: 
 
  BEGIN TEXT.  From the Members of the 
  Afghanistan Mullah's Shura: 
 
  ¶I.  We are seriously asking the Afghanistan 
  Government and the people of Ghazni to try 
  their best to implement the Regulation of 
  Islam and the Holy Koran. 
 
  II.  The interference of neighbor countries 
  is perfectly illegal, and we denounce and 
  condemn it. 
 
  III.  The Afghanistan Government, which is 
  elected by Afghan people, is completely 
  real and legal, so it is the responsibility 
  of everyone to back it up. 
 
  IV.  The Constitution must be supported 
 
KABUL 00005518  002 OF 002 
 
 
  must be supported by Afghans, and we hope it 
  be implemented in the society. 
 
  ¶V.  We want Afghan Government to accord the 
  needs of the people to build some Religious 
  Schools. 
 
  VI.  The media and newspapers should be 
  broadcasted according to Islam and Afghan 
  culture. 
 
  VII.  The peace and security is the only 
  desire of Afghans - we want the people to 
  work together in order to bring National 
  unity and brotherhood to our country. 
 
  We are supporting the resolutions of all 
  Afghanistan's mullah shuras around the 
  country.  And we want these resolutions to 
  be implemented in the community.  END TEXT.
