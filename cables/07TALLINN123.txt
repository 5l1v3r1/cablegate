REF: A) STATE 23001 B) STATE 19372 
 
(U) On February 26, we delivered reftel points to Marin 
Mottus, MFA Director for Middle East Affairs, to inform 
the GOE of U.S. views on Iranian compliance with UN 
Security Council (UNSCR) 1737.  Mottus thanked us for 
the information.  As Estonia has no diplomatic presence 
in the region, Estonia is dependent upon the United 
States and other EU members for information on Iran. 
Estonia continues to support the EU's common position on 
Iran, and Mottus reiterated the importance of Washington 
and Brussels working together on this sensitive issue.
