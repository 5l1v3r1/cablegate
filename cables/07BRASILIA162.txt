SUBJECT: BINDING MERCURY POLLUTION REDUCTION TARGETS - NO POSITION 
FOR BRAZIL 
 
REF:  (A) 06 STATE 202028, (B) BRASILIA 50 
 
¶1. On January 25, 2007, SCI Officer met again with Otavio Trindade 
of the Ministry of External Relations' Division for Environmental 
Policy and Sustainable Development for follow-up discussions 
regarding demarche request in Ref A.  Trindade reiterated Brazil's 
support for UNEP voluntary mercury partnerships and its opposition 
to binding mercury pollution reduction targets via the creation of a 
new international legal framework. 
 
¶2. Trindade went on to explain, however, that he had recently been 
informed that the European Commission (EC) may introduce an 
amendment to the Stockholm Convention at the UNEP GC meeting in 
Nairobi that would call for binding mercury pollution reduction 
targets.  In light of this new (to the GOB) information, and since 
the EC's proposal would be an amendment to an existing legal 
framework to which the GOB is a party, he could not confirm whether 
the GOB would support or oppose such an amendment.  Trindade added 
that it was also not clear whether the GOB would establish its 
position on the potential amendment prior to the February 5 UNEP GC 
meeting in Nairobi. 
 
¶3. Trindade opined that given the Ministry of Environment's (MMA) 
assessment that there has been a reported reduction in mercury 
pollution over the last year in Brazil, and that primary mining of 
mercury is already illegal in Brazil (although illegal mining and 
black market sales continue), GOB support for the amendment remains 
a possibility because the proposed targets may be easy for Brazil to 
meet.  On the other hand, it is also not clear whether the GOB would 
be able to consistently meet such binding targets in the future. 
Trindade added that via similar logic, it may also be possible that 
the GOB would support a global prohibition of mercury exports. 
 
¶4. On a related note, Trindade concluded the meeting by emphasizing 
that Itamaraty supports a voluntary mercury partnerships between EPA 
and MMA as envisioned by UNEP, and that it would welcome an exchange 
of letters of cooperation in this regard.  Post is currently working 
with EPA to develop such a draft letter (to be sent to Washington 
for clearance prior to submittal to the GOB).  Post will continue to 
communicate with the GOB on these issues in the lead up to the 
Nairobi meeting and report to Washington with any updates.
