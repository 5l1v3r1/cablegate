SUBJECT: USG VIEWS FOLLOWING IAEA BRIEFING ON IRANIAN 
NON-COMPLIANCE AND WEAPONIZATION-RELATED ACTIVITIES 
 
REF: STATE 19694 
 
Per retel, Political Counselor contacted Julian Juarez, 
Deputy Director General for UN Affairs in charge of 
international security issues to brief him on our reaction to 
the rollout of the IAES report on Iranian non-compliance. 
Political Counselor raised the points in reftel. Juarez said 
the GOM had looked at the report and also noted 
inconsistencies cited in reftel.   Juarez said he was aware 
of Iranian efforts to gloss over the report and said they 
were to be expected.   Mexico continues to believe Iran needs 
to do a better job accounting for past activities and live up 
to its current obligations to the UN.
