LACK OF RESOURCES AND ENFORCEMENT 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary.  Responsibility for environmental 
preservation and protection in Yemen is divided between the 
Ministry of Water and Environment and the Environmental 
Protection Authority (EPA).  Due to budget shortages across 
the ROYG, environmentally affiliated agencies are suffering 
from a lack of resources.  Yemen's environmental issues are 
slowly but surely being recognized by the international donor 
community.  Due to the enormity of environmental challenges 
facing Yemen, international donor community interest, 
including USG support, in assisting Yemen face climate change 
and promote clean fuel is crucial.  End Summary. 
 
ROYG INSTITUTIONS STRIVE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  (U) Responsibility for environmental preservation and 
protection in Yemen is divided between the Ministry of Water 
and Environment and the Environmental Protection Authority 
(EPA) (formerly Council).  While the Ministry focuses on 
policy and regulations, the EPA primarily works on 
implementing activities.  According to Dr. Hussein al-Gunied, 
Deputy Minister for Environmental Issues, topics that have 
appeared prominently on the Ministry's agenda in the recent 
past include climate change, the 2008 floods in Hadramout, 
drought, and air pollution.  Although the ROYG has a 1995 
Environmental Law, it has not been updated to include 
pressing environmental issues, and Gunied admitted that 
"enforcement is an issue."  A country still run on leaded 
gas, Yemen also does not have a national policy for clean 
fuel, but, according to Gunied, is interested in introducing 
new legislation.  Due to a general lack of awareness, it is 
challenging to introduce, implement, or enforce any 
legislation. 
 
¶3.  (U) Established in 2005, the ROYG's EPA works with line 
ministries in implementation of environmental policy, 
including both green issues (biodiversity) and brown issues 
(climate change and environmental preservation).  The EPA has 
a mandate to undertake environmental impact analysis for 
industrial plants and to serve as the focal point for 
international conventions.  (Note: EPA's predecessor, the 
Environmental Protection Council, was more of a coordination 
body.  End Note.)  The EPA has established six 
environmentally protected areas throughout Yemen, including 
Socotra, where it protects the ecosystem and unique species. 
Chairman Mahmoud Shidiwah told EconOff on October 20 about a 
showcase program in which animal waste from two cows 
generates enough biogas for five households to be sufficient 
in terms of electricity and cooking.  The EPA is interested 
in attracting investment from companies that employ clean 
energy practices and have activities that reduce emissions. 
 
LACK OF RESOURCES, CAPACITY PLAGUE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) Due to budget shortages across the ROYG, 
environmentally affiliated agencies are suffering from a lack 
of resources.  Gunied said that the Ministry has suffered a 
60 percent cut in its budget in 2009.  The Ministry relies 
heavily on cooperation with donors in order to fund and 
implement many of its projects.  Even with continued 
involvement from the Water Sector Support Program (WSSP), 
which includes the World Bank, Germans, and Dutch, the donor 
community has the impression that the Ministry of Water lacks 
the capacity to implement most programs.  Ali Kassim 
Manshalin, Senior Program Officer at KfW (German development 
bank), told EconOff on October 21 that "political will is a 
must now," in order to revive the water sector.  Dr. Riyal 
Mohammed of the Yemen Association for Environmental 
Protection (YAEP), lamented the low priority of environmental 
issues within the ROYG, saying on October 20 that the 
"Ministry of Water and Environment does not do much besides 
attend seminars."  (Note: The Ministry's Gunied asked for 
assistance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
particularly from the EPA-supported United Nations 
Environment Program (UNEP) Partnership for Clean Fuels and 
Vehicles.  He also requested assistance from the USG in 
drafting new bylaws for clean fuel, air pollution, and 
emissions control.  End Note.) 
 
¶5.  (U) Yemen's environmental issues outside of the water 
sector are slowly but surely being recognized by the 
international donor community. The World Bank is inviting 
Yemen to participate in the Pilot Program for Climate Change 
(PPCR) as one of the nine pilot countries globally.  The 
program will help the ROYG integrate climate risk and 
 
SANAA 00002084  002 OF 002 
 
 
resilience into core development planning.  On November 15 to 
16, the Ministry of Water and Environment held a workshop on 
climate change and adaptation in conjunction with the United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank to 
discuss Yemen's issues and future cooperation.  The ROYG's 
EPA will act as the lead agency in implementing the World 
Bank's adaptation to climate change projects. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Due to the enormity of environmental challenges 
facing Yemen, particularly in the water sector, international 
donor community interest in assisting Yemen face climate 
change is crucial.  Because of resource and capacity issues 
in the environmental agencies, the ROYG could use additional 
assistance, specifically in regulating clean fuel.  The ROYG 
has requested USG assistance in participation in the EPA's 
UNEP Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles and in drafting 
new bylaws for clean fuel, air pollutants, and emissions; the 
requests appear serious and assistance would be welcome. 
End Comment.
