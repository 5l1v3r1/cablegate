SUBJECT: INDONESIA -- HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ROLLOUT 
 
REF: STATE 24302 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) On March 12, Mission publicly disseminated the 2007 
Country Report on Human Rights Practices chapter on 
Indonesia.  Mission's Public Diplomacy Section posted the 
full text of the Indonesia chapter on Mission's web-site 
(www.usembassyjakarta.org), as well as a story about 
Secretary Rice's delivery of the report to Congress.  A 
 
SIPDIS 
translated version of the report will be widely distributed 
and posted on Mission's web-site by mid-April per the 
legislative mandate (reftel). 
 
¶2.  (U) In addition, poloff disseminated the report to key 
contacts in the government and the human rights community, 
Recipients included:  the National Commission on Human 
Rights; the National Commission on Violence Against Women; 
the Director General for Human Rights; and over a dozen major 
human rights NGOs and key contacts in government. 
 
¶3.  (U) In the first few hours since Mission disseminated the 
report, we confirmed that several key contacts had received 
the report and were reviewing it.  Leading human rights 
activists told poloff that they appreciated receiving the 
report and promised to share reactions to the full text as 
soon as they have time to digest it.  Because the report just 
came out, there has not yet been any press reaction.
