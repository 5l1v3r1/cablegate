¶1.  (U) Russian Ambassador Jakov Gerasimov paid a courtesy call 
on Defense Minister Vucinic on May 18.  According to press 
reports, the Ambassador proposed an agreement on technical 
cooperation and military education and indicated plans to assign 
a defense attache to the Russian Embassy in Podgorica soon. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Emboff spoke with the Deputy Defense Minister who was 
very uncomfortable when inquiry was made as to the type of 
assistance that might be forthcoming.  He fell back on the 
standard line that Montenegro seeks good relations with all 
countries and wanted to create space for cooperation and 
goodwill with all.  He alluded to a Russian-Slovene agreement as 
an example for Montenegro and said that no firm decision had 
been taken, but he thought that perhaps a Montenegrin officer 
would be sent to a Russian Military academy. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) Comment: Press coverage of the office call was delayed by 
Montenegrin holidays, but the timing is significant as the key 
figures in the Government of Montenegro, smarting from the 
uproar over the signing of SOFA and exchange of notes on Article 
98, seek to find ways to portray themselves publicly as charting 
an independent course.  While the opposition continues to charge 
that Government decisions will complicate the path to the EU, 
government has made the point, albeit slowly, that agreements 
with the U.S. are essential in preparing for NATO admission.  A 
VOA interview with DAS DiCarlo underscoring U.S. support for 
Montenegro's integration into European institutions has received 
wide press play and been very helpful.
