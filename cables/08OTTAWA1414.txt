SUBJECT: PM HARPER CONGRATULATES PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA 
 
¶1.  (U)  In a statement on November 4, Canadian Prime 
Minister Stephen Harper offered congratulations to 
President-elect Barack Obama and all incoming Members of 
Congress and Governors.  He pledged to continue to cooperate 
to "strengthen the special bond" between our two nations.

¶2.  (SBU)   Comment:  The bilateral relationship with the 
U.S. remains of paramount importance to Canada, and PM Harper 
and members of his Cabinet will be keen quickly to establish 
productive working relationships with the Obama 
administration.  Many Canadians also strongly hope that, 
given the importance of these ties, Canada will be the first 
destination of the new President in 2009, or that Prime 
Minister Harper will receive one of the first invitations to 
meet the next President.  End Comment.

Statement by Prime Minister Stephen Harper on the election of 
Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States of 
America 
 
4 November 2008 
Ottawa, Ontario 
 
On behalf of the Government and the people of Canada, I want 
to congratulate Senator Barack Obama for his victory in 
tonight's United States Presidential Election. 
 
I look forward to meeting with the President-elect so that we 
can continue to strengthen the special bond that exists 
between Canada and the United States. 
 
In the weeks and months ahead Canadian officials and 
diplomats will be working closely with members of 
President-elect Obama's transition team.  Ministers in our 
government look forward to building a strong working 
relationship with their counterparts in a new Obama cabinet. 
 
I would also like to congratulate all incoming Members of 
Congress and Governors.  Given the challenges facing the 
world economy, it is vital that Canadian and American 
legislators continue to work together on the important issues 
facing families on both sides of the border.
