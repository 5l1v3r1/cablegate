SUBJECT: Health Cooperation Q Moving Toward a New 
Framework 
 
REF: A) Jakarta 1065 and previous 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified. 
Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  This message outlines a vision of 
greater health cooperation with Indonesia and 
provides building blocks for the June 25 Sub-IPC. 
The United States now has an opportunity to transform 
our health cooperation with Indonesia into a true 
partnership.  However, the GOIQs granting of six- 
month visa extensions to staff of the Naval Medical 
Research Unit (NAMRU-2) gives us a short time to 
affect that transformation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SUMMARY CONQD:  During that period, we must 
develop a framework for broader health cooperation as 
part of our Comprehensive Partnership, finalize a 
memorandum of understanding regarding the joint 
laboratory that will be the core of this arrangement 
and discuss GOI concerns regarding the transfer of 
materials to any new facility.  This is an ambitious 
agenda--but one that we can achieve.  The first step 
will be to dispatch an interagency team to Jakarta 
the week of July 13 for discussions with the GOI. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
WHY GREATER HEALTH ENGAGEMENT? 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Indonesia wants to explore greater health 
cooperation with the United States as a possible part 
of our Comprehensive Partnership.  Health Minister 
Supari supported the NAMRU visa extension to give 
both parties time to work out a new model for 
research cooperation. SupariQs primary interest is 
that the new model reflects a true partnership 
through shared leadership by the U.S. and Indonesian 
health ministries. Supari also expressed interest in 
a Joint Consultative Forum on Health Cooperation, 
which she and Health and Human Services Secretary 
Sebelius would announce at their next meeting, should 
Secretary agree to the Forum. This forum would 
require annual ministerial meetings, supported by 
separate annual senior official meetings at the 
assistant secretary level. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) We believe greater collaboration on health 
research and public health surveillance makes sense. 
Indonesia is the fourth most populated country in the 
world with poor public health infrastructure, and 
indicators reflecting deterioration in the provision 
of basic health services.  Indonesia is also a 
reservoir of emerging infectious diseases including 
many of international concern. With densely populated 
communities living in close contact with livestock 
and new settlements encroaching on wildlife 
reservoirs, Indonesia creates ideal opportunities for 
new infectious diseases to emerge.  In addition, the 
poor provision of health services is also leading to 
reemergence of old diseases such as drug resistant 
TB. U.S. interests are served with increased research 
cooperation. 
 
----------------------- 
BUILDING BLOCKS FOR IPC 
------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) We suggest that the IPC focus on the 
following: 
 
-- INSTITUTE VERSUS LABORATORY:  We believe an 
institute versus laboratory model for joint 
engagement may resonate better with the Indonesians 
and would appear less like the existing NAMRU 
laboratory. From a political standpoint, the new 
proposed model must appear sufficiently different 
 
JAKARTA 00001075  002 OF 003 
 
 
from NAMRU and have co-leadership from HHS so that 
NAMRUQs detractors are managed. However, post 
believes that NAMRU will continue to be the most 
important and largest part of the new model. 
 
-- INTERAGENCY ENGAGEMENT AND CONSIDERATION OF 
FOUNDATION INVOLVEMENT:  SupariQs team recognizes 
that a joint laboratory or institute would include 
the presence of multiple U.S. agencies, including the 
military, but with new additional partners.  Supari 
has expressed particular interest in deepening ties 
with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and also 
exploring potential clinical research programs with 
the U.S. National Institutes of Health.  She is also 
very interested in cultivating new partners such as 
the Gates Foundation.  U.S agencies should begin 
exploring internally what kind of new model may work 
to best include interagency presence and also ability 
to include foundation partners. 
 
-- JOINT CONSULTATIVE FORUM:  We support IndonesiaQs 
proposal for a joint consultative forum but recognize 
that an annual meeting between Ministers may need to 
occur on the margins of a World Health Assembly or 
else be held every two years, to be realistic.  We 
support the idea of an annual senior officials 
meeting. 
 
-- DELEGATION TO VISIT IN JULY:  We recommend a 
multi-agency visit after the July 8 Presidential 
election to explore Indonesian interest in a joint 
institute, determine if Indonesian interests are 
compatible with US priorities, and begin a dialog on 
the conceptual framework.  In addition to a State 
Department Delegation Chief, potential participants 
who could be particularly helpful include Health and 
Human Services (Dan Miller), Naval Medical Research 
Center (Stephen Walz), US CDC (Steve Blount/Nancy 
Cox), and US NIH (Gray Handly). 
 
-- DISCUSSION OF MTA SHOULD NOT BE PRIMARY FOCUS: 
Although the delegation may need to hear IndonesiaQs 
views about the MTA, this should not be a primary 
focus of the visit. At the same time, we believe it 
is important to begin a dialogue on US expectations 
of this partnership, particularly in terms of 
transparency in data sharing, participation in 
outbreak investigations, and development of 
surveillance systems to characterize infectious 
disease threats. 
 
WHITE PAPER 
 
¶7.  (U) MissionQs interagency health team supports 
the vision of a joint laboratory outlined in the 
attached white paper. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF WHITE PAPER: 
 
Indonesian-American Joint Medical Research Laboratory 
 
Objective: 
 
We seek to establish a joint medical research 
laboratory where Indonesian and American scientists 
conduct mutually beneficial research on re-emerging 
and newly emerging infectious diseases. 
 
Key elements: 
 
-- Coordination:  A Joint Research Coordinating 
Committee would oversee the laboratory.  An equal 
number of Indonesians and Americans would sit on the 
Committee, which would be co-chaired by one 
Indonesian and one American representative.  All 
decisions would be taken by mutual consent. 
 
-- Joint Research:  The Joint Research Coordinating 
 
JAKARTA 00001075  003 OF 003 
 
 
Committee would make recommendations on the 
development, implementation, and evaluation of the 
laboratory's research. 
 
-- Transparency:  The Indonesian government has the 
right to access all facilities and research results 
at any time. 
 
-- Contribution:  Each side would provide qualified 
scientists to conduct research projects of mutual 
interest.  Indonesia would provide rent-free 
facilities; the U.S. would maintain and repair those 
facilities. 
 
--Financial Management:  An American comptroller 
would control U.S. government funds and an Indonesian 
comptroller would control Indonesian government 
funds. 
 
-- Publication:  Authorship on publications would be 
based on each authorQs scientific contribution in 
accordance with internationally accepted criteria for 
authorship (e.g. International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors). 
 
-- Specimens:  The laboratory would comply with all 
Indonesian laws and regulations related to specimens.
