¶1. As Taiwan's travel industry eagerly awaits a cross-Strait 
agreement on tourism, now expected to be finalized in spring 2007 
(reftels), Beijing announced revised regulations making it easier 
for foreign travel agents to operate in China.  The China National 
Tourism Administration Director General Shao Qiwei announced on 
January 18, 2007, that China would ease capital requirements for 
foreign travel agents to establish subsidiaries in China.  The 
required investment will be lowered from Renminbi (RMB) 2.5 million 
(US$320,000) to RMB 300,000 (US$39,000) starting in July 2007. 
Beijing also eliminated quota restrictions on the number of offices 
that could be opened.  However, foreign firms will still be limited 
to offering only domestic China tourism services. 
 
¶2. Taiwan's two largest tour companies, Set Tour and Phoenix Tours 
International Inc., have reacted to the announcement by saying they 
would like to have the ability to offer international travel 
services from China-based offices.  Nevertheless, both said they 
would take advantage of the new measures to establish wholly-owned 
subsidiaries in China in expectation of future market opening.  Set 
Tour has already set up offices in Shanghai and Dalien through a 
joint venture with a local travel agent.  With its own offices, the 
firm hopes to more effectively take advantage of the anticipated 
opening of Taiwan to Mainland tourists.
