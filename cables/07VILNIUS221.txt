We delivered ref A points to Martynas Lukosevicius, the 
Attache responsible for implementing sanctions in the MFA's 
Arms Control, Non-Proliferation, and Disarmament Division, on 
March 27.  He told us the GOL welcomes the new sanctions on 
Iran (ref B).  He added that the GOL finds it useful to 
receive details about implementation from the USG.
