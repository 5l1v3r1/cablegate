Rock two Egyptian C-130 aircraft containing Katrina relief, 
including 3,000 blankets, 1.1 tons of jam, and 1.3 tons of 
powdered milk.  Post requests that Task Force ensure that 
OFDA/FEMA approve the donation and that clearances are 
granted for the aircraft to land on Sept. 8. 
 
¶3.  The Egyptian Defense Attache in Washington has requested 
diplomatic clearance for the two C-130s containing the first 
load of supplies, described in para two, to land in Little 
Rock.  Although the aircraft are scheduled to arrive on Sept. 
8 at 1630Z hours, landing clearances have not yet been 
received.  The total GOE donation for Katrina victims will 
include seven tons of bottled water, 20,000 blankets, 25 tons 
of macaroni, 1.1 tons of jam, 8.3 tons of powdered milk, 10 
tons of medical supplies, and up to 10,000 sets of underwear. 
 
 
¶4.  Post also requests Task Force assistance with obtaining 
OFDA/FEMA acceptance of the remainder of the GOE donation, 
which will be ferried to the U.S. via a U.S. military C-17 
that will be returning to the U.S. on Sept. 10.  This portion 
of the donation will include seven tons of bottled water, 
seven tons of powdered milk, 17,000 blankets, up to 10,000 
sets of underwear, 10 tons of medical supplies, and 25 tons 
of macaroni. 
 
¶5.  This U.S. military C-17 is scheduled to depart Cairo on 
Sept. 10 empty (after having unloaded its cargo in support of 
operation Bright Star).  Post plans to transport the 
remainder of the GOE Katrina donation to the U.S. on this 
C-17.   Please provide acceptance of the full donation and 
flight clearances for this delivery as soon as possible.
