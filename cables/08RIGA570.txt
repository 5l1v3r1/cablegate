¶1. Latvia has not directly countered Russian claims of genocide in 
South Ossetia, but senior officials have always rebutted it when 
asked.  According to MFA contacts, Latvia prefers to work through 
international organizations to counter such claims rather than risk 
a bilateral spat with Moscow in which Russia inflames the issue of 
ethnic Russians living in Latvia.  PM Godmanis has said that he 
believes an international investigation should examine these Russian 
claims. 
 
¶2. Following the September 15 GAERC decision to deploy an EU mission 
to Georgia, Latvia decided to send five people, drawn from both the 
Defense and Interior Ministries, to participate in the mission.
