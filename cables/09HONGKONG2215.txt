     ¶B. BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN 00282 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel A request, post conducted a pre-license 
end-use check on Foreign Consignee Sino Technology Co. Ltd. 
Post determined that Sino Technology does not have a true 
physical presence in Hong Kong.  Since Sino Technology does 
not have a true physical presence in Hong Kong and appears to 
be using a business service provider for a Hong Kong 
address/phone number/fax number, post defers to AIT Taipei 
for an assessment of the reliability of foreign consignee 
Long Sion Corp AKA Sino Technology Corp. to be a recipient of 
USML items. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post notes that reftel A request contained 
incomplete contact information for Sino Technology in Hong 
Kong since the contact information included only the street 
address of the office (582-592 Nathan Road) and the name of 
the shopping center (Sino Centre), but no unit / office / 
flat / room number.  Moreover, the phone number included with 
the Hong Kong contact information is a Taiwan mobile phone 
number.  Post Blue Lantern Coordinator (BLC) visited the Sino 
Centre on November 24 and determined there was no office for 
Sino Technology.  Post's Economic Specialist also called the 
Sino Centre management office and the operator said Sino 
Technology did not have an office there. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post Economic Specialist then called the Taiwan 
mobile phone and spoke with Mr. Charlie Chen, who said he was 
the responsible person for Sino Technology in Hong Kong.  Mr. 
Chen said he was in Taiwan and would not be able to meet BLC 
in Hong Kong.  Mr. Chen confirmed the end user for the 
transaction was Thailand Armed Forces Security Center and 
said a Thai company was also involved in the deal.  Mr. Chen 
provided his e-mail address: Charliechen960(atsign)gmail.com. 
 Mr. Chen could not recall the full address of his company in 
Hong Kong, but said it was somewhere on Nathan Road.  Mr. 
Chen also said Sino Technology had an office in Taiwan near 
Taoyuan Airport called Long Sion Corporation, confirming 
information in reftel A.  When Post Economic Specialist asked 
why Mr. Chen chose a Hong Kong company rather than a Taiwan 
company as the importer for this shipment, Mr. Chen said it 
is not convenient to do this business in Taiwan. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post BLC sent Mr. Chen an e-mail on November 25 
requesting Sino Technology's registered address in Hong Kong 
along with the Hong Kong company registry number to assist in 
local due diligence.  Mr. Chen responded on November 27 with 
additional contact information and scanned copies of two 
documents related to Sino Technology.  Additional contact 
information included: e-mail: tomachi(atsign)ms38.hinet.net; 
mobile phone: 886-988-387863; China mobile phone: 
139-22520820; skype: luckycharlie; Long Sion Corp phone: 
886-3-2160030; Long Sion Corp fax: 886-3-2150420; Long Sion 
Corp website: www.longsion.com.tw.  The two documents 
included a Certificate of Incorporation of International 
Business Company in Brunei Darussalam for Sino Technology, 
containing information detailed per reftel B; and contact 
information for the company in Hong Kong, including the full 
Hong Kong office contact information: Room 804, Sino Centre, 
582-592 Nathan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong; Phone: 
852-2384-0332; Fax: 852-2771-7211.  Post BLC provided this 
contact information to AIT Taipei BLC on November 30 to 
assist in AIT's efforts to contact Mr. Chen. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post Economic Specialist called the listed phone 
number and found it belonged to a business service provider 
called Power Point International Company Ltd.  Local research 
shows the company provides corporate secretarial service, 
business management and consulting services, corporate 
management, and investment advisory service.  An internet 
search using the address and phone number for Sino Technology 
yielded over a dozen other companies with the same address 
and phone number presumably using Power Point's business 
services. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Since Sino Technology does not have a true physical 
presence in Hong Kong and appears to be using a business 
service provider for a Hong Kong address/phone number/fax 
number, post defers to AIT Taipei for an assessment of the 
 
reliability of foreign consignee Long Sion Corp AKA Sino 
Technology Corp. to be a recipient of USML items.
