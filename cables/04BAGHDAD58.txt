SUBJECT:  USEB 039: IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT DECREE ON THE 
DEFENSE OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  THE IRAQI INTERIM GOVERNMENT (IIG) ENACTED 
A DECREE ON THE DEFENSE OF NATIONAL SECURITY TODAY.  THE 
LAW IS AIMED AT BETTER COMBATING THE INSURGENCY WHILE 
MAINTAINING BASIC RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE LAW 
COMPLIES WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE TRANSITIONAL 
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW (TAL), WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN IRAQI 
BILL OF RIGHTS.  POST PROVIDES COMMENTS ON THE LAW AND THE 
FULL TEXT OF THE LAW BELOW.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) ON WEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 2004, THE IRAQI INTERIM 
GOVERNMENT PASSED A DECREE ON THE DEFENSE OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY.  POST'S VIEW IS THAT THE LAW IS NOT DESIGNED TO 
GRANT THE IIG VAST ADDITIONAL POWERS.  TO THE CONTRARY, 
MOST OF WHAT THE DRAFT PERMITS COULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN DONE 
UNDER EXISTING IRAQI LAW.  THE DRAFT SERVES AS AN OMNIBUS 
ORDER, CONSOLIDATING IRAQI PROCEDURES WITHIN A RULE OF LAW 
FRAMEWORK FOR READY USE IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.  THE 
IIG AS SOON AS IT WAS FORMED SIGNALED AN INTEREST IN SUCH 
AN ACT TO WORK WITH CPA AND US TO ENDEAVOR THAT THE FINAL 
DRAFT COMPORTED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS UNDER BOTH THE 
TAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.  POST VIEWS THE OUTCOME AS 
FAVORABLE.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LAW FOLLOW IN PARAGRAPH 3 AND 
THE FULL TEXT OF THE LAW AS TRANSLATED BY THE U.S. EMBASSY 
IS IN PARAGRAPH 4. 
 
¶3. (U) HIGHLIGHTS. 
 
-- THE DECREE IS NOT SELF-EXECUTING.  BOTH THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENCY (UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THREE 
PERSONS) MUST DECLARE AN EMERGENCY CONDITION FOR THE DECREE 
TO HAVE EFFECT. 
 
-- THE DEFINITION OF "EMERGENCY CONDITION" LIMITS 
APPLICATION TO A CONTINUOUS, SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE 
IN A PARTICULAR PART OF IRAQ THAT THREATENS THE PERSONAL 
SAFETY OF IRAQIS.  AN EMERGENCY CONDITION DOES NOT 
AUTOMATICALLY APPLY NATIONWIDE. 
 
-- ANY DECLARED EMERGENCY CONDITION AUTOMATICALLY SUNSETS 
AFTER 60 DAYS AND EVERY 30 DAYS THEREAFTER UNLESS 
REAFFIRMED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENCY. 
 
-- ALL SEARCHES AND SEIZURES MUST COMPORT WITH THE TAL AND 
THUS REQUIRE JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION IN THE ABSENCE OF 
EXTREME EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES. 
 
-- ALL DETAINEES MUST BE BROUGHT BEFORE A JUDGE WITHIN 24 
HOURS, CONSISTENT WITH THE IRAQI CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. 
 
-- ALL EXECUTIVE DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE DECISION TO 
DECLARE AN EMERGENCY, ARE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW AND 
OVERSIGHT BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL. 
 
-- TO THE EXTENT NEW POWERS OR PROCEDURES ARE AUTHORIZED, 
THEY APPLY ONLY IN AREAS OF A DECLARED EMERGENCY AND EXPIRE 
AFTER THE EMERGENCY. 
 
SUCH NEW POWERS AND PROCEDURES INCLUDE: 
 
-- LIMITED CONTROLS ON MOVEMENT, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, AND 
EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION TO ORDER CURFEWS FOR A FIXED PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
 
-- CLOSING OR RESTRICTING ACTIVITIES OF PRIVATE 
ORGANIZATIONS, UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS, AFTER OBTAINING A 
COURT ORDER. 
 
-- ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN COVERT SURVEILLANCE MEASURES UPON 
JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION. 

-- ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND FOR IRAQI 
SECURITY FORCES, ALL OF WHOM WILL REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE 
PRIME MINISTER OR HIS DESIGNEE. 
 
-- BROAD POWER TO DELEGATE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY FROM THE 
PRIME MINISTER TO CIVILIAN OR MILITARY OFFICIALS WHERE 
NECESSARY. 
 
-- AUTHORITY TO ORDER THE ISOLATION AND ENCIRCLEMENT OF 
AREAS EXPERIENCING WIDESPREAD INSURRECTION. 
 
-- AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE PRIME MINISTER, WITH PRESIDENCY 
APPROVAL, TO GRANT PARDONS AND IMMUNITY. 
 
THE FORMER REGIME HAD SUCH POWERS BUT THEY WERE NOT 
ESTABLISHED IN WRITING, THEY WERE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES, 
AND THEY WERE SUBJECT TO ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT. 
 
-- THE DECREE REAFFIRMS THE IIG'S COMMITMENT TO CARRYING 
OUT ELECTIONS BY JANUARY 1995, SAYING "IT IS NOT 
PERMISSIBLE TO USE ANY PROVISIONS OF THIS ORDER TO DELAY 
... 
IONS UNDER 1546, 
OR IRAQI SECURITY FORCES OPERATING UNDER UNIFIED MNF-I 
COMMAND.
