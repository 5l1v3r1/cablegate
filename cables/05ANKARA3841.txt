¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  According to a Turkish MFA water 
expert, the GOT is indifferent to an announced increase 
of Euphrates flow from Syria to Iraq as a means to 
increase Iraqi electricity production.  Euphrates flow 
from Turkey to Syria has not been increased, although 
Turkey continues to more than comply with its agreement 
to provide Syria with 500 cubic meters per second.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  EST specialist inquired with MFA about press 
reports attributed to Syrian Irrigation Minister Nader 
al-Buni that as a "gesture of solidarity" with Iraq, 
Syria has increased the flow of water from the 
Euphrates to Iraq in order to boost Iraqi power 
generation.  (Given that the Syria-Iraq bilateral water 
agreement allows Syria use of 42% of the Euphrates 
water it receives, and given Syria's repeated demands 
for more water from Turkey, this could imply that 
Turkey is providing additional flows to Syria.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  However, MFA Hydropolitics Advisor Yavuz 
Cubukcu said there had been no increase in flows from 
Turkey and that none was foreseen.  The average flow 
for 2005 is anticipated to be the same as 2004, i.e. 
850 cubic meters per second.  Cubukcu said the minimum 
flow at the Syrian border likely to be 600-650 cubic 
meters per second, which is more than the agreed 
minimum flow of 500 cubic meters per second. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Cubukcu offered the opinion that electricity 
shortages Iraq resulted from inadequate infrastructure, 
not water scarcity.  He emphasized that Turkish water 
infrastructure projects on the Eurphrates should not 
have a major impact on flows downstream (other than to 
smooth variations).  Only 17% of the GAP region's water 
infrastructure completed and the GOT does not have 
discretion over Birecik Dam (the last major dam before 
the Syrian border) reservoir storage since the dam is 
operated by an outside consortium that requires a 
minimum flow to operate the dam's hydropower plant. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Cabukcu said the Turkish government remained 
positive about the Turkey-Iraq technical committee 
meeting agreed by the Turkish State Hydraulics Works 
(DSI) and Minister Rashid during PM Jafari's visit to 
Turkey.  The GOT is waiting for the Iraqis to approach 
them with proposed dates and content for the meeting. 
Cabukcu said that, contrary to media reports citing al- 
Buni, there were no plans for a tripartite Iraq-Syria- 
Turkey meeting on water sharing.
