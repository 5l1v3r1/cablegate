Summary 
------- 
¶1. (SBU) In a statement issued late June 14, Fiji's Office of 
the Prime Minister defended the interim government's (IG) 
decison to declare Michael Green, New Zealand's High 
Commissioner to Fiji, "persona non grata."  The statement 
claimed Green had interfered in Fiji's domestic affairs, but 
gave few specifics.  The statement said that Fiji-New Zealand 
relations have been strained since the December military 
takeover, that Fiji's representative in Wellington had been 
"snubbed" by NZ authorities, and that Green's "attitude" had 
not helped the situation.  The PM's office insisted that the 
decision should not impact Fiji's relations with other 
countries.  Initial reaction from non IG-sources in Fiji has 
been strongly negative.  Leading Fiji human rights activist 
Shamima Ali said the action shows that the interim regime 
will not tolerate dissenting views from any quarter, even 
from diplomats.  She and others urged the regime to 
reconsider.  End summary. 
 
PM's Office Defends PNG Decision 
-------------------------------- 
¶2. (U)  Several hours after the government of New Zealand 
announced that New Zealand High Commissioner to Fiji Michael 
Green had been declared "persona non grata" by Fiji's interim 
governent (IG), Fiji's Office of the Prime Minister issued a 
statement defending the decision.  The statement reads: "It 
is with deep regret and reluctance that the Government of the 
Republic of Fiji Islands have come to the decision to issue 
Persona Non-Grata to H.E. Michael Green.  The practice of 
quiet diplomacy was foremost (sic) given all the chances to 
prevail by Fiji authorities in our efforts to seek 
understanding of H.E. Mr. Green to stop interfering in Fiji's 
domestic affairs given our status as a sovereign nation." 
"At official level, the (Fiji-NZ) relationship has remained 
somewhat strained since 5th December, despite best of efforts 
on part of Fiji to re-engage with New Zealand.  Our High 
Commissioner in Wellington has continuously been snubbed by 
the New Zealand Government authorities.  The attitude of his 
counterpart here in Fiji H.E. Mr Green has done little to 
help the situation."  "Government deeply regrets this action, 
but in the circumstances it has had little choice." 
 
¶3. (U)  The statement ends by insisting that this action 
should not have any impact on Fiji's relations with other 
countries.  "It is the considered view of Government that 
this is purely a bilateral matter between Fiji and New 
Zealand and it in no way should have implications on Fiji's 
bilateral relations with other countries, including its 
commitments and obligations to the International Community as 
well as the Pacific Island Forum." 
 
Action Against NZ High Commissioner Dominates Fiji Media 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
¶4. (SBU)  The early afternoon announcement from New Zealand 
about the IG's decision dominated Fiji's airwaves June 14. 
Television, radio and websites highlighted New Zealand FM 
Peters' statement that the government of New Zealand deplores 
this action by Fiji's interim regime and that there are 
likely to be serious consequences for all of Fiji's 
international relationships, including with the Pacific 
Island nations, Australia, the United States and the EU. 
Peters said the NZ government would undertake a full review 
of aspects of its relationship with Fiji, but that it did not 
plan to PNG Fiji's High Commissioner to New Zealand.  All 
media outlets reported statements by PM Clark that NZ had 
tried to convince the interim governent to "pull back" from 
this decision over the last several days, to no avail, and 
that the action was "a giant step backward." 
 
Initial Reaction Harshly Negative 
---------------------------------- 
¶5.  (SBU)  Comments from non-IG sources in Fiji have been 
strongly negative so far. Deposed PM Qarase called the 
decision "immature."  Former opposition leader Mick Beddoes 
said the IG's reasoning for the move, which he interpreted to 
be Green's extensive contacts with former members of 
Parliament and opposition figures, was "absurd."  "This is 
definitely not something I would classify as a smart move," 
he said.  The National Federation Party expressed concern 
about the hardship NZ retaliatory measures could impose on 
Fiji citizens who regularly travel to, or have relatives in 
 
SUVA 00000320  002 OF 002 
 
 
New Zealand.  He asked the IG to reconsider its stance. 
Leading activist Shamima Ali, head of the Fiji Women's Crisis 
Center, said the action reflected the fact that "even 
diplomats are not at liberty to express an opinion that shows 
any opposition to the interim regime."  It is very 
unfortunate, she went on, that someone like Green with a deep 
understanding of Fiji should be asked to leave.  She urged 
the IG to reconsider.
