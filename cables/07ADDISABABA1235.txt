TERRORISM A TRUE REGIONAL THREAT 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Tekeda criticized the assertion that Ethiopia was 
exaggerating the threat of terrorism in the region.  Such 
allegations from "experts" had hampered Ethiopia's capacity 
to build counter-terrorism relationships within and outside 
the region, and thwarted coordination efforts.  Underscoring 
that Ethiopia was an "honest broker," Tekeda highlighted that 
Ethiopia had long faced numerous terrorist threats, including 
a 1996 assassination attempt on one of its government 
ministers, serious bomb threats, and other narrowly averted 
violent attacks. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Tekeda noted that the April 13 IGAD Ministerial 
communique (reftel) acknowledged Ethiopia's leadership role 
in the region.   (NOTE: The communique, inter alia, 
"expresses its appreciation to the Ethiopian government for 
all the sacrifices it has made to promote the common position 
of IGAD Member States... to protect the region from terrorist 
and extremist force."  END NOTE.) 
 
¶7. (SBU) Tekeda repeatedly asserted that only in "recent 
months" had the U.S. and Ethiopia aligned their 
counter-terrorism efforts, with Washington taking Ethiopian 
counterparts seriously.

ETHIOPIAN AMONG YOUNG AND FRAGILE DEMOCRACIES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Lack of sustainable resources and of security on the 
continent made it simpler to destabilize African governments, 
Tekeda said.  Although both the TFG and IGAD have had their 
share of challenges, both continued to act as governing and

coordinating bodies, helping to "grow" democracy in the 
region.  Western partners may not appreciate how difficult 
and lengthy a process democratic institution-building is in 
the region, Tekeda said.  He noted that he had spent much of 
the previous week in Nairobi, discussing organizational 
issues and fundraising with the organizing committee for 
Somalia's national reconciliation conference.  In contrast, 
in Asmara, a Somali contingent with Eritrean backing was 
likely plotting a new government for Somalia, he said, 
serving to counter regional peacekeeping efforts. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Tekeda said Ethiopia was among a growing number of 
young and fragile democracies.  Western partners should 
therefore show more patience with Ethiopia's fledgling brand 
of democracy, and be aware of the impact of populist anti-GOE 
rhetoric.  Some allegations of GOE human rights abuses were 
simply false; it was "untrue" that Western partners cared 
more about democracy in Ethiopia than Ethiopians themselves 
did. 
 
¶10. (U) Poverty was one of the GOE's largest security 
threats, Tekeda said.  The GOE was balancing the need to 
bridge the gap between the rich and poor, with how it invited 
multinational enterprises to help grow its economy.  Striking 
a careful balance among business growth, trade relationships, 
inflation management, and poverty alleviation, were GOE 
priorities. 
 
¶11. (SBU) COMMENT: Tekeda's comments echo those of other GOE 
principals, underscoring that counter-terrorism and promoting 
regional security are the GOE's external priorities, while 
building democracy and alleviating poverty are its domestic 
priorities.  Tekeda's assertion that the U.S. has only 
"recently" aligned its counter-terrorism efforts with 
Ethiopia is likely meant to underscore that Ethiopia has long 
supported Somalia's TFG, despite U.S. reluctance to do so 
earlier.  END COMMENT.
