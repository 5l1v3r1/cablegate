¶2.  (SBU) Environment, Science and Technology Counselor met on 
August 14 with the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations (MRE) 
Director of the Department for the Environment and Special Themes, 
Min. Luis Alberto Figueiredo Machado, and per reftel urged Brazil to 
approve Measure 1 (2003) of the Antarctic Treaty System.  Figueiredo 
Machado responded that the Brazilian government was supportive of 
the Measure.  Since the Measure had financial implications for the 
government, he explained, it would need congressional approval.  He 
could not give an estimate of when he expected to obtain that 
approval.  He did understand the significance of obtaining the 
approval of the four outstanding members before the April 2009 
meeting in Baltimore.
