SUBJECT: CHINESE DELEGATIONS VISIT KIGALI 
 
 ¶1.  (U) Two Chinese delegations visited Kigali the week of 
August 28.  A Communist Party delegation, led by Wu 
Guanzheng, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the Central Committee, conducted closed-door 
discussions with the Secretary General Francois Ngarambe and 
other RPF officials.  Chinese Minister of Cooperation Wang 
Jiarui led separate discussions with Minister of State 
Rosemary Museminali under the aegis of the Fifth Rwanda-China 
Joint Committee on Economic, Technical and Trade Cooperation. 
 Local media gave prominent place to the  Chinese financing 
of a new office building for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
and a railway feasibility project.  According to the minutes 
of the Joint Committee meeting, supplied to the embassy by 
Foreign Ministry contacts, the Chinese also agreed to 
consider construction of a new football stadium, a women's 
center, and a Confucius Institute.  At the meeting Rwanda 
formally requested duty-free access to Chinese markets, and 
also expressed appreciation for completed rice and road 
projects. 
 
¶2. (U) The visit of the delegations coincides with 35 years 
of diplomatic relations between the two governments.  In a 
public meeting with Wu Guanzheng, President Kagame pledged to 
attend the upcoming China-Africa forum. The two leaders 
pledged to seek stronger economic ties, and, at a later 
dinner, the two men witnessed the signature of several 
technical and development agreements. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  The prominent press coverage given to the 
financing of the new Foreign Ministry building (something 
previously agreed to) conforms to the Chinese predilection 
for announcing large public projects in the visited nation's 
capital.  The railway feasibility study concerns a project 
long dear to the GOR, the construction of a railway line from 
Isaka in western Tanzania to Kigali and Bujumbura.  Many of 
Rwanda's imports pass through the dry-port of Isaka, routed 
the rest of the way by road.  An extended railway line would 
greatly reduce freight costs.
