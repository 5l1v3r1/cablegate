SUBJECT: SIGN OF IMPROVING RELATIONS -- TURKS FIGHT FIRE IN 
SYRIA 
 
 
¶1.  Turkish officials over the past year have spoken often of 
improving relations with Syria.  But so far it has been 
mostly talk, until October 27, when in a surprising show of 
cooperation, Syria asked for and Turkey delivered planes and 
fire fighters to put out a blaze along the border of Turkey's 
Hatay province, which as recently as 1998, looked to be on 
the front lines of a war between the two countries over 
Syria's protection of PKK units and leaders. 
 
¶2.  On October 26, a serious fire broke out in Latakia 
province, which borders the Turkish province of Hatay. 
Syrian officials were forced to evacuate 25 villages and 
needed help to control the blaze.  Hasan Ipek, head of 
Turkey's Emergency Management Agency told us Syrian Prime 
Minister Al-Utri called Turkey's Prime Minister Erdogan that 
night asking for help.  Erdogan authorized Ipek to arrange 
for three planes from the Turkish Army, two Forest Service 
helicopters and other equipment and personnel to be sent to 
Syria.  After the two foreign ministries worked out details 
to allow the Turkish planes to cross into Syria, at 5:00 am 
the equipment and personnel were on their way to Syria.  By 
10:00 am, the fire was out.
