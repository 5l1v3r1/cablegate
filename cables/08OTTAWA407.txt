SUBJECT: CANADA CARES ABOUT TIBET, TOO 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Several hundred protesters -- apparently including 
large numbers of ethnic Tibetans -- staged a peaceful protest 
march on March 20 from Parliament Hill to the Chinese 
Embassy, passing en route in front of the U.S. Embassy.  They 
variously chanted "China out" or "Free Tibet," among other 
slogans, and carried numerous Tibetan flags and placards 
denouncing China's actions in Tibet, calling for respect of 
Tibetan human rights, or expressing outrage over the upcoming 
Beijing Olympics.  A spokesman told reporters that many of 
the protesters had come from Toronto, which he described as 
having the largest Tibetan diaspora population in the world, 
after Dharmasala. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Prime Minister Stephen Harper separately issued a 
statement of concern on March 20: 
Begin quote 
Canada shares the concerns about what is happening in Tibet. 
As His Holiness the Dalai Lama told me when I met him and as 
he has been saying recently, his message is one of 
non-violence and reconciliation and I join him in that call. 
Canada calls upon China to fully respect human rights and 
peaceful protest.  Canada also calls on China to show 
restraint in dealing with this situation.

¶3.  (U)  On March 13, Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier had 
publicly expressed the government's concern over allegations 
of human rights abuses in Tibet on the floor of the House of 
Commons, and on March 16 issued the following statement on 
Tibet: 
Begin quote 
The Government of Canada is alarmed at the deteriorating 
situation, including increasing reports of violence.  We have 
expressed concern to the Chinese ambassador and through our 
embassy in Beijing to the Chinese government. 
 
We urge restraint.  I have called on the Government of China 
to respect the right of Tibetans to protest peacefully and to 
take steps to improve the human rights situation in Tibet. 
 
Canada is working to obtain further information, through its 
embassy in Beijing, on the current situation in Lhasa and the 
status of Canadians in the affected area. 
 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada has issued an 
official travel warning for Canadians to avoid all 
non-essential travel to the region. 
End quote 
 
¶4.  (U)  Prime Minister Harper met with the Dalai Lama in 
Ottawa on October 29, 2007, drawing the ire of the Chinese 
Embassy here.  Chinese government officials subsequently 
declined to meet in Beijing with visiting Canadian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Len Edwards.  The Prime Minister's annual 
holiday card also included a photo of him with the Dalai Lama 
(as well as photos with other dignitaries), again provoking a 
controversy with the Chinese. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Canada's Parliament granted honorary citizenship to 
the Dalai Lama in June 2006, at the request of the Harper 
government.
