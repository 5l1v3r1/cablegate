FY09 1206 TRANCH 2 PROPOSAL 
 
REF: PANNAMAN-AFRICOM/SSP 03/27/09 E-MAIL ENTITLED 
     "TUNISIA FY09 1206 TRANCHE 2" 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  As requested in Reftel, OSC Tunis submitted a FY09 
Section 1206 Tranche 2 proposal to AFRICOM Security 
Assistance Branch via e-mail on 27 March 2009. The proposal, 
entitled "Tunisian Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) 
Vessel Enhancement Package," seeks to provide approximately 
$7.5 million in immediate assistance to the Tunisian Navy for 
the acquisition of interdiction vessels necessary to counter 
the emerging terrorist threat posed by Al Qaida in the Lands 
of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and growing regional security 
threats linked to illicit weapons and smuggling drugs.  As 
AQIM continues to evolve into a more effective and lethal 
organization capable of developing new tactics, techniques 
and procedures to move and employ personnel and materiel 
throughout the region, the requirement to effectively and 
safely conduct fast-response maritime interdiction/boarding 
operations becomes important to the security of US interests 
in the region. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Specifically, this 1206 proposal seeks to provide 
the Tunisian Navy with the vessels necessary to support fast 
response interdiction operations into its economic exclusion 
zone, support its transition from Level I/Level II 
(compliant/non-compliant) boardings to Level IV (opposed) 
boardings, and support its mission of force 
protection/high-value asset protection.  Due to a lack of 
surface interdiction vessels with sufficient range, armament 
and operability across all sea states, the Navy is currently 
unable to conduct sustained fast response missions in its 
economic exclusion zone and the type of opposed boardings 
required to effectively conduct maritime counter-terrorism 
operations.  The addition of six high-speed boats with 
improved range (doubling the range of Tunisia's current fast 
response capability) and lethality will increase the 
effectiveness of the Tunisian Navy's counter-terrorism 
operations. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  I urge the Department and USAFRICOM to support this 
proposal and continue to back the Tunisian Government's 
efforts to combat the transnational terrorist threat posed by 
AQIM as well as other illicit activities which could be 
employed by AQIM to further their cause.
