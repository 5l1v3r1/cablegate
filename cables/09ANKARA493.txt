¶1. Although Turkey has now passed two major stimulus 
packages (see reftels), neither set of legislation 
contained any major initiatives on green investment.  The 
upcoming third package is expected to focus on credit 
guarantees, and there has not yet been any discussion of a 
fourth package. 
 
¶2. The GOT did grant an amnesty on taxes and fines for 
people who trade-in vehicles older than 30 years for a new 
car, partially with the intent of removing high-emission 
vehicles from the road, but more as a means to spur new car 
purchases.  The success of this plan has been limited, for 
reasons outlined in Ref C.  More successful has been the 
temporary removal of the special consumption tax on new 
vehicles (Ref D), which has sparked a sharp uptick in new 
vehicle sales and will tangentially help replace older 
vehicles with newer, low-emission models.  Again, the goal 
was less to help the environment than to spur the 
automotive industry, and if there is a net gain in overall 
cars on the road the emissions picture may actually worsen. 
 
¶3. Prior to the passage of the stimulus package, there had 
been some expectation that there would be tax incentives 
for automotive firms researching clean technologies and 
retail tax incentives for consumers purchasing green 
vehicles, but neither proposal was included in the final 
plan.
