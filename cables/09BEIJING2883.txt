¶1. PolOff and Russian Embassy Second Secretary Andrey 
Chernyshov delivered reftel demarche informing China that the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) 
Exercise Planning Group (EPG) meeting scheduled for November 
had been postponed to January 19, 2010 to MFA Arms Control 
and Disarmament Department Nuclear Division Officer Xu Feng 
on October 15.  Xu said that his office was "thinking 
positively" about attending the meeting especially since it 
supported the planned Nuclear Summit.  Xu asked whether his 
office could receive more information about the planned 
November 24-26 COBALT exercise and suggested that such 
information be posted on the webpage described in reftel.  Xu 
suggested that, by providing more information about the 
exercise, the USG would help the MFA persuade other Chinese 
ministries to send observers. 
 
¶2.  In a pull-aside, Xu asked PolOff whether Washington could 
provide more information about the planned International 
Technical Working Group on Nuclear Detection seminar 
scheduled for November and the Nuclear Smuggling Outreach 
initiative.  Xu indicated that MFA had been invited to 
participate in those events but needed more information.
