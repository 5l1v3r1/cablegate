SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - MEXICO, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AFTERMATH 
 
 
¶1. On July 7, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 102,000) 
carried a column by Alvaro Vargas Llosa entitled, "Calderon's 
Difficult Challenges."  Quote: 
 
"Calderon's victory is a counterweight against populism. We must not 
forget that Calderon's campaign frontally opposed populism, not just 
with respect to Lopez Obrador, but also (Venezuelan President Hugo) 
Chavez....  For an important part of Mexico's left, Lopez Obrador 
was a way to weaken ties with the U.S. and strengthen them with a 
South America where the left has made significant progress. 
Calderon has praised Chile and has spoken about strengthening ties 
with Brazil and Central America, where the moderate left and the 
center-right prevail. But Latin America's left will fall on Calderon 
sooner or later as it did on Fox.  What remains to be seen is if 
Calderon will form a tacit alliance with other countries or will 
choose to endure the attack alone, as did Fox to some degree." 
 
¶2. On July 7, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 102,000) 
ran an editorial entitled "Mexican Election, A Test for Its 
Institutions."  Quote: 
 
"Taking into account Mexico's size, its population, and the number 
of voters--over 41 million--Congress' fragmentation, and a six-year 
presidential term, it is not hard to conclude that Mexico does not 
have the best scenario for political stability and government 
efficiency.  Mexico is an important actor in Latin America, which is 
why it must have the mechanisms and institutions to promote good 
government....  From the regional viewpoint, Mexico should have 
leaders that favor moderation. Given Latin America's current 
configuration, moderation is a condition of special interest to 
Chile, which has many elements to cultivate with Mexico, in addition 
to a political strategic alliance." 
 
¶3. On July 7, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 116,807) ran an editorial entitled, "The Disputed 
Mexican Election."  Quote: 
 
"The international community has closely followed Mexico's election 
and is watching with special concern Lopez Obrador's reaction, which 
could create instability and damage Mexico's reputation and 
influence.  We must note that the shadow of Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez--with whom the leftist Mexican candidate sought ties 
during the campaign--lingers over this election and over Latin 
America in a sort of regional 'Cold War.'"
