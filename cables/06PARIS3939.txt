SUBJECT: WEDGEWOOD DEMARCHE PROMPTS MFA REQUEST TO BACK 
FRENCH CANDIDATE 
 
REF: STATE 85722 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Embassy delivered diplomatic note June 5 to MFA IO 
A/S-Equivalent Sylvie Berman seeking support for Professor 
Wedgewood's reelection to the Human Rights Committee and 
followed up June 6 with IO Human Rights DAS-Equivalent 
Beatrice Le Fraper, who in turn sought U.S. backing for the 
reelection of French citizen and Human Rights Committee 
Chairman Christine Chanet.  Le Fraper presumed the USG would 
welcome the candidacy of Chanet, underscoring her position as 
the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner of Human 
Rights on the Human Rights Situation in Cuba, the equivalent 
of a UN Special Rapporteur.  Le Fraper said a diplomatic note 
would be forthcoming. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Although Le Fraper, as in the past, 
implied positive Franco-American convergence on human rights 
objectives, she did not indicate French voting intentions on 
the Wedgewood candidacy.
