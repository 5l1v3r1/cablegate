¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  King Norodom Sihamoni seized the occasion of the 
Ambassador's long-awaited presentation of credentials at the Royal 
Palace to be one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate 
President-elect Barack Obama on his inauguration day (with January 
20 coming 12 hours earlier in Phnom Penh than Washington), and to 
express his sincere thanks to President Bush and the American people 
for their assistance to his country. In the short but cordial 
meeting, the Ambassador expressed her determination to enhance and 
strengthen our bilateral relationship, particularly in the 
political, economic and cultural sectors. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador presented her credentials to King Sihamoni 
on January 20, almost three months after her November 5, 2008 
arrival in Cambodia.  The King opened by saying that since 1991 the 
U.S. and Cambodia have been developing trust and a strong bilateral 
relationship, and that he hoped the Ambassador would help enhance 
this relationship during her tenure.  He expressed his gratitude to 
President Bush and to the American people for helping assure peace, 
security and stability in his country and for their generous 
contributions to the development of Cambodia and assistance in the 
education, health and social development sectors.  The King also 
noted USG contributions to the Cambodian military and demining 
efforts. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ambassador assured the King that she would convey his 
regards to our Presidents, old and new, and that she was looking 
forward to continuing our friendship and cooperation in the 
economic, political and cultural spheres.  She paid particular 
attention to the latter, stating that there has been a noticeable 
cultural renaissance in Cambodia and that the Embassy would be 
interested in helping to provide a broader stage on which to 
showcase the country's visual and performing arts.  The Ambassador 
mentioned the upcoming exhibition of Cambodian bronze figures at the 
Freer/Sackler Galleries in 2010 and suggested that the exhibit may 
provide an opportunity for the King to travel to the U.S. in order 
to introduce the art of his country to the American people. The 
Ambassador further assured the King that she would work to preserve 
continuity in our bilateral relationship as we transition from one 
administration to the next, and that she will encourage future 
high-level USG visits which would serve to deepen and strengthen our 
bilateral ties. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In response King Sihamoni provided his sincere wishes of 
success to both the Ambassador and the new President as he takes the 
oath of office, and reiterated his hopes for health and happiness to 
outgoing President Bush and to the American people.
