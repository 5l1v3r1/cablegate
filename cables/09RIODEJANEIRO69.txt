SUBJECT: Media Reaction, Jornal do Brasil Newspaper, "Automakers 
trying to catch their breath" 
 
Center-left Jornal do Brasil commented on page A8 (03/31/2009): "The 
real-life soap-opera starring the USG and American automakers 
continues with twists and turns in every new chapter.  Recently, 
General Motors confirmed the resignation of its CEO, Chrysler and 
Fiat announced a global alliance and President Barack Obama demanded 
promptness on restructuring plans.  Meanwhile, in Brazil, the GOB 
reduced taxes on cars, motorcycles and trucks to facilitate sales. 
In different ways, governments are trying to take the reins of the 
situation, attempting to avoid unemployment and trying to save a 
crucial sector of their national economies from the abyss. 
 
In the United States, the automakers, which were poorly managed and 
not very competitive with their foreign competitors, were completely 
hit by the economic crisis... GM and Chrysler alone have received 
more than USD 17 billion from the USG, and they are asking for more 
to ensure their survival... With the same goal of keeping jobs, 
spurring consumption and stimulating this key sector of Brazilian 
economy, the GOB announced a mini-package yesterday, including the 
extension of tax incentives over car sales for an additional three 
months.  The measure is conditioned by a no-firing policy by 
automakers in Brazil and was negotiated between the government and 
unions.  While the situation looks critical in the U.S., here 
Finance Minister Guido Mantega is more optimistic.  According to 
him, the Brazilian automobile industry was less affected by the 
crisis... All government efforts are valid in this sui generis 
moment of the global economy.  Resuming economic growth is the top 
priority."
