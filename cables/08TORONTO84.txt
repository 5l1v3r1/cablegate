SUBJECT: Canada in the Americas: Liberal Foreign Affairs Critic 
Warns Against Protectionism, Argues For More Canadian Diplomacy 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - Please Protect Accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  In a March 20 speech before the Canadian Council 
on the Americas, Liberal Foreign Affairs critic and newly elected 
Member of Parliament Bob Rae argued for increased resources and 
better coordination among Canadian foreign affairs agencies, and a 
stronger Canadian commitment to the Americas.  Rae also warned of 
the dangers of protectionism, particularly in the United States, and 
noted that renegotiating NAFTA would put "everything" on the table, 
to include energy and bulk water exports.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rae criticized what he described as Prime Minister Harper's 
hostility toward the professional Canadian foreign service, and 
noted that Harper's (and previous governments) efforts to cut back 
and marginalize the public service contradict the increased burden 
placed on Canadian diplomacy worldwide.  Harper's "command and 
control" style of management, according to Rae, is ill-suited for 
the management of highly complex organizations like the Canadian 
federal government. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rae said Canadian diplomacy needs more resources as well as 
much better coordination and the elimination of "silos" between 
DFAIT and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).  He 
specifically cited President Bush's request for increased State 
Department funding and staffing as an example of what Canada needs. 
Canadian public diplomacy should be reinvigorated, with more focus 
on education and selling Canada as a unique "brand" to worldwide 
audiences, he argued. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Rae was cautious about the extent of Canada's influence in 
the Americas.  He said he believes Cuba's transformation "may be 
about to begin" and argued that Canada's policy of limited 
engagement is the right course because it gives Canada opportunities 
to influence the transformation that are unavailable to the U.S.  He 
expressed disagreement with Venezuela and Hugo Chavez's politics, 
but noted that each country is free to choose its own path.  He 
described Chavez's recent referendum defeat as a hopeful sign of 
democracy in Venezuela.  Rae also argued for increased engagement 
with Mexico and Brazil as their economic influence grows. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In response to audience questions, Rae criticized 
protectionist impulses throughout the hemisphere and said Canada is 
far too dependent on trade to restrict it.  Canadian policymakers, 
Rae said, should emphasize to U.S. leaders the dangers of 
restricting trade.  He also noted that if the U.S. wants to 
renegotiate NAFTA, "everything" would be on the table, particularly 
oil and gas and "better protection of our water resources." 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Rae, likely to be a foreign affairs "heavyweight" 
in the Liberal caucus in the Commons, presented a spirited case for 
increased resources for Canadian international engagement.  With the 
exception of his comments on NAFTA, his view of Canada's role in the 
world is non-controversial from the U.S. perspective.  However, his 
remarks on Harper's leadership style and attitude towards the 
Canadian public service may be a preview of his lines of attack when 
he takes his seat in Ottawa after Parliament sits again on March 31. 
 END COMMENT.
