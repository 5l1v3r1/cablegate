¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  With over 600 soldiers, police officers, 
and military observers currently deployed to seven countries, 
the Philippines remains an important contributor to 
international peacekeeping efforts.  These deployments 
highlight the government's continuing policy of supporting UN 
peacekeeping operations despite its own manpower shortages, 
particularly in the Philippine National Police (PNP), as well 
as the overall high quality and good English language skills 
of the Philippine participants.  The government has been 
appreciative of U.S.-funded peacekeeping-related training and 
assistance in the past, and is likely to sign up for the 
Global Peace Operations Initiative and to continue to 
volunteer for various UN peacekeeping operations. End Summary.

¶2.  (U)   According to statistics from the United Nations 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO), the 
Philippines (as of May 2007) had 627 peacekeepers currently 
deployed in seven countries:  Timor Leste, Liberia, Sudan, 
Kosovo, Haiti, Afghanistan, and the Ivory Coast.  (Statistics 
in para 6.)  Among ASEAN countries, the Philippines ranks 
behind Indonesia and Malaysia in terms of total peacekeepers 
deployed, but is first for police personnel in the field. 
Worldwide, the Philippines the 29th largest contributor of 
peacekeepers.   Philippine participants in peacekeeping 
operations in Liberia, Timor Leste, and Haiti have won 
special commendations from the UNDPKO, which has frequently 
sought to extend the tours of high performing individuals. 
Among other qualifications, the high English language skills 
of Philippine troops are especially welcome. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Philippine officials including Foreign Secretary 
Alberto G. Romulo have reiterated repeatedly their 
government's commitment to continuing to play an active role 
in UN peacekeeping operations, while senior officers of the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the PNP have noted 
how much their own troops welcome the opportunity to serve in 
these capacities and how much they themselves benefit from 
the experiences.  Officials have commented, however, that 
resource constraints, notably a manpower shortage in the PNP, 
are a limiting factor.

U.S. Assistance for Philippine Peacekeeping 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Both the government and the AFP have specifically 
welcomed various U.S. training for Philippine peacekeepers. 
Through the Joint U.S. Military Action Group (JUSMAG), the 
Embassy extended peacekeeping operations training to six AFP 
personnel in FY 2006 and six more thus far in FY 2007. 
JUSMAG most recently arranged training for several AFP 
personnel at a Peacekeeping Operations Seminar in Cambodia, 
and is currently vetting two additional soldiers for the 
Multinational Peace Support Operations Exercise in Mongolia 
in August.  In the immediate future, JUSMAG plans to invite 
the AFP to nominate additional personnel for a number of 
upcoming peacekeeping courses hosted regionally, including 
courses on civil military coordination, peace operations 
instructors training, and United Nations staff officers 
training.  The AFP is now considering standing up a dedicated 
AFP battalion to support UN peacekeeping operations, 
according to AFP Chief of Staff General Hermogenes Esperon.

Comment:  GPOI participation likely 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) While the Philippine government has yet to respond 
to our invitation to participate in the Global Peace 
Operations Initiative (GPOI), Embassy has high confidence 
that we will receive a positive answer in the coming weeks. 
Both Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political 
Military Affairs and Pacific Commander Admiral Keating have 
raised GPOI with senior Philippine officials during recent 
visits, and heard expressions of high interest and general 
support, especially in light of our willingness to provide up 
to $394,000 in GPOI funding to train and equip Philippine 
peacekeepers.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is now "fast 
tracking" our invitation; we suspect the only slow down is 
the detailed examination by DFA legal experts of the required 
section 505 agreement.  We also expect to see Philippine 
 
MANILA 00002259  002 OF 002 
 
 
participation in many UN peacekeeping operations in the 
future, as in the past.  End comment
