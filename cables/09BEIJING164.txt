Wen Jiabao to Visit Europe 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the January 20 regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesperson 
Jiang Yu said Premier Wen Jiabao will visit Switzerland, Germany, 
Spain and the United Kingdom from January 27-February 2, where he 
will meet with the leaders of those countries and also meet with EU 
President Jose Barroso.  The Premier plans to attend the upcoming 
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  The purpose of Wen's 
visit is to help the international community build "strategic 
consensus" and "work together" on the Global Financial Crisis. 
China also seeks to "further enhance" the mutual understanding and 
trust of the China-EU "strategic partnership" in the new year. 
While specific details of the Premier's trip have not yet been 
released, Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Hongbo plans to provide a 
background briefing on the visit at the MFA on January 22. 
 
U.S.-China Relations in the New Administration 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Jiang reiterated the importance of China's relations with the 
United States as President-elect Obama prepares to take office.  She 
said good U.S.-China relations are in the fundamental interests of 
both countries and are conducive to peace, stability and 
development.  The present situation is an important "strategic link 
between past and future."  China has a long-term perspective on the 
relationship and believes it is in our common interest to promote 
the long-term "healthy" and "stable" development of U.S.-China 
relations into a "new era."  On arms sales to Taiwan, however, Jiang 
said the United States should abide by its obligations under the 
three joint communiques, especially the August 17, 1982 communique, 
and support "peaceful development" of cross-Strait relations with 
"concrete actions." 
 
Bird Flu Cases: China's Response 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. In answer to a question on China's response to the recent 
outbreak of a few cases of bird flu, Jiang said China has taken 
control measures with respect to the "highly infectious bird flu," 
and reported its actions to the WHO, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan 
authorities, and to relevant foreign countries.  Jiang underscored 
that these were "sporadic" individual cases. 
 
PRC's Ties with the DPRK, Tensions on the Peninsula 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. Jiang said this year marks the 60th anniversary of the PRC's 
relations with the DPRK and it will be a "year of friendship" with 
multiple bilateral exchanges.  China looks to deepen "mutually 
beneficial cooperation" and "friendly relations" with North Korea. 
Asked about the DPRK's recent hostile statement to the ROK, she said 
China hopes that South and North Korea can "resolve" differences 
"through dialogue," as is in the "fundamental interests" of those on 
the Korean Peninsula.

¶6. Questioned about the possible detainment of activist Yao Lifa, 
who reportedly was taken into custody before his planned attendance 
at an inauguration event at the U.S. Consulate General in Wuhan, 
Jiang referred interested parties to the "local authorities." 
 
Update on the Dumpling Case in Japan 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. With respect to the tainted dumpling case in Japan, China 
attaches "great importance" to food safety and public health 
concerns, Jiang said.  China has taken "active measures" on the 
dumpling case and has been in full communication with relevant 
authorities in Japan.  The PRC supports a full investigation into 
this case so that the "truth" can be "exposed."
