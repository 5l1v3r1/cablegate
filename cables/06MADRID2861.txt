ESTHOFF made reftel points November 7 to Health Ministry 
Deputy Director General for International Affairs Jose Perez 
Lazaro, encouraging Spain to make an additional and 
substantial contribution to the Global Polio Eradication 
Initiative (GPEI).  Perez Lazaro told ESTHOFF that Spain 
planned to make an additional contribution to the GPEI in 
Â¶2007.  He said he could not provide the exact figure, which 
he described as "important but modest," as the issue was 
still pending before the Spanish Council of Ministers (i.e., 
the Cabinet).  Perez Lazaro thought the transfer to the GPEI 
would be approved by the Council on either December 8 or 
December 15 (the Council meets every Friday).  Post will 
EMail the figure to OES/IHA once it is approved by the 
Council.
