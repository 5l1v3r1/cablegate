¶1.  (U) The 2006 UNESCO Literacy Prize Winners were announced 
yesterday, 21 June 2006.  The winners are:  Cuba, Morocco, Pakistan, 
Rajastan (India), and Turkey. 
The prizes are expected to be presented on 8 September 2006, 
International Literacy Day. 
 
¶2. (U) The UNESCO International Reading Association prize was 
awarded to Pakistan (National Commission for Human Development NCHD, 
for its National Literacy Program, which aims to increase the 
literacy ration by the year 2015 to meet EFA goals. 
 
¶3. (U) One of the two UNESCO King Sejong Prizes was awarded to 
Turkey (Mother Child Education Foundation).  The other UNESCO King 
Sejong Prize was awarded to Cuba (Youth and Adult Literacy and 
Education Chair of the Latin American and Caribbean Pedagogical 
Institute) for its work to advance individual and social potential 
through innovative teaching methods with successful outcome in 15 
countries, notably in Ecuador and Venezuela. 
 
¶4. (U) One of the two UNESCO Confucius Prizes was awarded to Morocco 
(Ministry of National Education).  The other UNESCO Confucius Prize 
was awarded to Rajastan (India) (Directorate of Literacy and 
Continuing Education for its Useful Learning through Literacy and 
Continuing Education Program 
 
¶5. (U) Prize winners are designated by the Director General on the 
recommendation of a jury, made up of least five persons of different 
nationalities appointed by the Director General for a minimum of 
three years.  Mr. Shigeru Aoyagi and Ms. Namtip Aksornkook are the 
two education sector staff members who have been responsible for the 
program. 
 
¶6. (U) Jury members for the International Reading Association, King 
Sejong and Confucius prizes: 
Alan Farstrup, (US) 
Choi Un Shil (Korea) 
Ghada Ragheb Al-Jabi (President) (Syria) 
Gorgui Sow (Senegal ) 
Mirian Masaquiza (Ecuador) 
Dong Jiang Song (China) new member added because of the Confucius 
prize 
 
¶7. (SBU) According to a conversation with Alan Farstrup, the US 
member of the jury, 47 candidatures were reviewed, having been 
nominated by NGO's or National Commissions.  He said that overall, 
they were of poor quality, with only six candidates really worth 
considering.  One other candidate, an Africa project, was ruled out, 
as it had been nominated by Spain, and not by an NGO or National 
Commission, according to the prize rules. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Farstrup indicated that there was a great deal of pressure 
from Ecuador to award a prize to Venezuela, but he was able to 
counter the push successfully.  He said that the rules of procedure 
are questionable, and need to be looked at, regarding term limits, 
conflict of interest, and selection of candidate for prizes. 
 
¶9. (SBU) As already reported, apparently at least two members of 
UNESCO's ED/BAS/LIT staff, pushed the prize nominations to the 
Director General's office without going through channels, which 
included Peter Smith, ADG, Education, and Jim Kulikowski.
