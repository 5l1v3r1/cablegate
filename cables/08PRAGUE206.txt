GYMNICH 
 
REF: STATE 30504 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Emboff met with Slavomir Goga and Magdalena 
Janesova, Desk Officers in the MFA's Department of Common 
Foreign and Security Policy, to discuss Czech views prior to 
the March 28-29 Gymnich. They were supportive of the USG 
positions in reftel. Both officials confirmed that Foreign 
Minister Schwarzenburg will attend the Gymnich. End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Western Balkans - Kosovo 
---------- 
2, (SBU) The MFA is supportive of our position on Kosovo. 
They are especially concerned about the setting up of 
parallel structures in Serbian majority areas. The Czechs 
intend to recognize Kosovo, but the recognition question has 
become hostage to "coalition politics." They could not 
provide an estimate on when the Czechs will recognize Kosovo. 
 
---------- 
Middle East/Syria 
---------- 
¶3. (SBU) Overall, they are very supportive and appreciative 
of U.S. efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East.  On 
Syria, Goga and Janesova believed the EU should limit high 
level visits, while still keeping open a dialogue with 
Damascus. They see Syria as a key player in achieving Middle 
East peace. 
 
---------- 
Russia 
---------- 
¶4. (SBU) Goga and Janesova stressed the need for a untied EU 
position towards Russia, but believe this could be difficult 
to achieve. The Czechs are in favor of negotiating a new 
partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA), but believe the 
new PCA must include strong commitments to human rights and 
democracy. 
 
---------- 
Tibet 
---------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Tibet will only be discussed during the working 
lunch. They did not expect any new communiques or statements 
beyond urging Beijing to show restraint towards peaceful 
demonstrations. The Czechs also do not plan to boycott the 
2008 Beijing Olympics.
