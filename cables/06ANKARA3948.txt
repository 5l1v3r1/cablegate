¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on 
PKK violence in Turkey (see ref b).  Our primary sources for 
these reports are mainstream Turkish press services, such as 
the Anatolian News Agency, and international wire services. 
While these sources are more reliable than most Turkish press 
sources, they are not necessarily unimpeachable.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenberg 
People's Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report 
higher numbers of Turkish Security Forces casualties. 
 
¶2. (U) According to press reports, two members of the Turkish 
Security Forces were killed and six wounded over the period 
June 12 - July 2.  Five civilians were wounded.  During the 
same period, 20 PKK terrorists were killed, including 11 in 
clashes June 23 in Hakkari Province.  The press further 
reported that three PKK terrorists surrendered to Turkish 
authorities in the Turkey-Iraq border town of Silopi.  These 
are usually PKK members who have voluntarily returned from 
northern Iraq and seek to leave terrorism behind; typically 
they provide a debrief to Turkish authorities and reintegrate 
into Turkish society. 
 
¶3. (U) The Turkish Defense Minister announced in Parliament 
June 21 that 5968 Turkish security personnel (soldiers and 
police) were killed and 11,794 wounded in PKK violence since 
1984, when the PKK started its violent separatist campaign.
