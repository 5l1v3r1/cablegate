In Today's Papers 
 
Debate over Headscarf Ban Continues in Turkey 
All papers report the new constitution draft excludes the ban on 
headscarves at universities and in public institutions.  Prime 
Minister Erdogan stated "nobody can be deprived of a university 
education on the grounds of their dress, if it is not against 
general morality and criminal law."  University rectors agree that 
the ban on wearing the headscarf at universities should remain in 
place.  In fact, one rector said that putting such an article in the 
constitution would "poison Turkey's secular system." 
 
Opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal said Erdogan reached a new stage 
in Turkish politics by branding the headscarf as a 'political 
symbol.'  Baykal warned that Erdogan is dragging Turkey onto a 
dangerous path.  Far-right MHP leader Devlet Bahceli said the PM's 
comments are "dynamiting social harmony" and that "Erdogan 
undermines public peace with his comments about the headscarf." 
Mainstream Milliyet says in a news commentary that by describing the 
headscarf as a 'political symbol,' Erdogan has paved the way for the 
manipulation of religious beliefs in politics.  According to 
Milliyet, Erdogan does not seek a sweeping compromise and wants to 
handle the matter through constitutional reforms. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Erdogan's Comments on Headscarf Ban 
Bilal Cetin wrote in the mainstream Vatan (1/16):  "At the press 
conference in Madrid the other day, Prime Minister Erdogan said he 
is seeking a tension-less solution to the turban issue.  Although 
the Prime Minister desires this kind of solution, it doesn't seem 
that this will be an easy task.  PM Erdogan said "suppose this 
(turban) is a political symbol; can you ban all kinds of symbols?" 
This is the part of this issue which will cause tension; the turban 
was banned because it is a symbol of political Islam.  This carries 
the debate from freedom of education to secularism, political Islam 
and fundamentalism.  After admitting the turban is a political 
symbol, the prime minister will find it hard to reach a consensus on 
the turban issue.  Whether the PM likes it or not, his use of the 
word 'symbol' poses a risk for social and public consensus and it 
indicates new tensions in Turkey." 
 
Turkish Jetfighters Bomb Northern Iraq, General Saygun Visits 
Baghdad 
All papers report 14 Turkish F-16 fighter jets took off from 
Diyarbakir and bombed the PKK camps in Zap, Avashin and Hakurk in 
northern Iraq.  A statement from the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
said, as in previous operations, care was shown not to harm 
civilians.  Mainstream Milliyet reports TGS sources said the strikes 
were a response to the January 4 bomb attack in Diyarbakir.  Papers 
report Secretary Rice, who paid a surprise visit to Baghdad on 
Tuesday, held talks with President Talabani and the Kurdish regional 
administration leader Massoud Barzani in the Iraqi capital when 
Turkish warplanes attacked the PKK camps.  Hurriyet reports 
unidentified TGS who said the Turkish attacks shows "the tripartite 
mechanism's determination to crush the PKK." 
 
Meanwhile, papers report Deputy Chief of the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) General Ergin Saygun went to Baghdad for a one-day working 
visit.  Mainstream Hurriyet says the visit helped put into effect 
the tripartite Turkey-US-Iraq mechanism which was discussed between 
Prime Minister Erdogan and President Bush in their November 5 
meeting at the White House.  Saygun met with Nasier Abadi, the 
deputy chief of staff of the Iraqi military, and General David 
Petraeus.  Saygun and Petraeus discussed the fight against the PKK 
and possibilities for long-term cooperation against the terrorist 
group.  Hurriyet writes that, according to military sources, Saygun 
briefed the Iraqi government about Tuesday's Turkish air operations 
into northern Iraq.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak claims Secretary 
Rice joined the meeting between Saygun and Petraeus. 
 
President Gul Visits Egypt 
 
ANKARA 00000091  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
All papers report Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with visiting 
Turkish President Abdullah Gul in Cairo to discuss bilateral ties 
and international issues of joint concern. 
Mubarak told a Turkish television station that Turkish investments 
in Egypt have increased with plans for the establishment of a new 
Turkish industrial zone.  Mubarak voiced hope that Turkey would 
continue to support peace efforts in the Middle East. 
 
In a joint press conference with Gul, Mubarak said that he helped 
prevent a war between Turkey and Syria in 1998 over Damascus' 
sheltering of  PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.  Mubarak said he has 
agreed with Gul to intensify efforts to establish a Palestinian 
state.  Mubarak declined to answer questions about the energy deal 
signed by his country with southern Cyprus, say Turkish papers.  Gul 
said he discussed with Mubarak the situation in Iraq, the new phase 
of things in the region following the Annapolis meeting, and the 
Lebanon question.  Gul also noted Turkey's relations with the Arab 
world should not be seen as an alternative to its relationship with 
the European Union. 
 
Later in the day, Gul said in a meeting with the Turkish-Egyptian 
Business Council that a pipeline to carry Egyptian natural gas to 
Europe through Turkey was under construction.  He also lobbied for 
the interest of Turkish businessmen in the Egyptian banking sector, 
and invited Egyptian entrepreneurs to invest in Turkey.  Gul later 
called on the Arab League headquarters and had talks with its 
Secretary General Amr Moussa to discuss the Middle East peace

process after the Annapolis conference and the developments in 
Palestine. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Iran 
Hikmet Bila commented in leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet (1/16): 
"Why did Bush come to the Middle East?  Most likely, he came to 
witness the bloodshed in Iraq and Palestine.  He plans to turn Iran 
into a sea of blood before he leaves power and is sowing new seeds 
of war.  Bush's remarks in Israel resemble the lies told by the 
Pentagon prior to the Iraq war, namely that Iraq harbored weapons of 
mass destruction (WMDs).  Since the Iraq war began, no WMDs have 
been found and 1.5 million Iraqis, most of them children, have died. 
 Now Bush is planning to attack Iran because he thinks Iran is 
planning to attack the US with nuclear weapons.   How can the US 
attack Iran if it can't control Iraq and Afghanistan? If the US 
thinks it can deal with Iran through only an air bombardment, she is 
very much mistaken.  Iran is not same as Iraq.  Iran has historic 
roots as the Asian gate to Europe and the Middle East.  Moreover, 
Iran is the energy source for giant Asian countries.  Even though 
Israel supports a war against Iran, Arab countries are very 
disturbed by this whole situation.  Arab people don't deserve this 
at all."
