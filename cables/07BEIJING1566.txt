SIX-PARTY TALKS, SECRETARY GATES ON CHINA, MILITARY SPENDING,

LATIN AMERICA 
 
¶1. Key points made at the March 8 MFA Press Conference were: 
 
-- China's State Council issued a report on the Human Rights Record 
of the United States in 2006 as "a mirror for the United States to 
view its own human rights" situation and to question American 
"double standards" in criticizing other nations' human rights. 
 
-- News on Six-Party denuclearization working groups will be 
released before March 19.  The MFA has no information on Kim 
Kye-gwan's visit to Beijing. 
 
-- China hopes the United States Defense Secretary's comments that 
China is a strategic partner are sincere.  China's first ever 
aircraft carrier would be used to safeguard sovereignty and rights 
in the high seas. 
 
-- Japan should appropriately deal with comfort women and history 
issues with the goal of improving bilateral relations. 
 
-- An oil project with Angola that failed due to reported Chinese 
profiteering was a natural commercial exchange. 
 
-- Amid reports of a rise in illegal Chinese immigrants in Latin 
America, China stands firm against human smuggling. 
 
Human Rights Reports 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang said at the March 8 regular press 
briefing that the Human Rights Record of the United States in 2006 
issued today by China's State Council Information Office serves as 
"a mirror for United States to view its own human rights condition" 
and "understand why it has no right to use double standards in 
criticizing other countries."  Qin continued, saying the MFA would 
give the State Department copies of the "Four Books and Five 
Classics" of Chinese literature as a guide to good governance. 
Asked if the report constituted a double standard on China's part by 
interfering in the domestic affairs of the United States, Qin 
referred the reporter to his previous statement. 
 
Meetings of US-DPRK, Japan-DPRK 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Qin announced that news on the working groups for the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would be released before 
March 19.  China hopes Japan and the DPRK can solve their disputes 
in proper and timely fashion so as to move toward the normalization 
of relations and talks between the two sides taking place in Hanoi 
signify an important step in the implementation of the initial 
actions, Qin said.  He praised the positive attitude of the United 
States and DPRK sides, giving no information on Kim Kye-gwan's visit 
to Beijing. 
 
Military Issues: Gates' Comments, Aircraft Carrier 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4.  China hopes that comments by Secretary of Defense Gates are 
"sincere," Qin said, responding to questions about recent Senate 
testimony by Defense Secretary Gates that China is a strategic 
partner of the United States, not an enemy.  China looks to increase 
cooperation, mutual trust and understanding with the United States. 
 
¶5.  When asked to provide information and justification for Chinese 
Navy plans to build an aircraft carrier by 2010, Qin explained China 
must adequately protect its long sea boarder while safeguarding its 
sovereignty and "sea rights".  China has a defensive military policy 
that is not expansionist and will not enter into any arms race. 
 
Japan Should Properly Deal with Comfort Women 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Qin referred to abuse of comfort women as one of the serious 
crimes committed by Japanese militarists.  China hopes Japan will 
seriously and properly deal with comfort women and other historical 
issues with the goal of improving bilateral relations.  Qin did not 
confirm if Wen would discuss these issues in his upcoming visit to 
Tokyo. 
 
Angola Oil Snub a Normal Commercial Exchange 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  A Portuguese reporter asked for comment on recent reports that 
Angola has ended talks with Sinopec on a $4 billion refinery project 
due to Chinese profiteering.  Qin said the process was a normal part 
of "commercial exchange," while reaffirming China's fair and 
mutually beneficial trade practices and the importance of 
cooperation with African countries. 
 
China Investigates Illegal Immigrants in S. America 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶8.  China stands firmly against the "worldwide issue" of illegal 
immigration and human smuggling, said Qin when asked about conflicts 
in Peru, Columbia and Argentina in recent months involving Chinese 
illegal immigrants, mostly from Fujian Province.  China continues to 
counter such activities through law enforcement, education and 
various measures dictated by international treaties to which China 
is a signatory.  In the case of Peru, China is conducting an 
investigation, which will be followed by repatriation if necessary 
and will handle the matter in accordance with the law.
