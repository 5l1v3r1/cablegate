Reporting Period 
 
1)           July 7- EXBS Advisor met with Undersecretariat 
for Customs Head of Data Processing and Communication 
Department Nurcan Ozyazici to discuss the Product 
Identification Tool (PIT) project.  Ozyazici informed EXBS 
Advisor that she was still awaiting final approval from 
Customs undersecretary concerning the use of US funding for 
the customization project.  Once this is received, detailed 
coordination with the selected customization contractor, 
Docuart International, can begin.  EXBS Advisor proposed a 
meeting for August 4th, with the US DOC contractor of the PIT 
project in Ankara.  This would allow all individuals that 
will now be involved in the project to have their questions 
answered by the PIT designers.  Ozyazici agreed this would be 
beneficial to the project and should allow the PIT 
customization to move forward quickly.  The follow-on meeting 
was scheduled. 
 
EXBS Advisor met with Customs Enforcement Deputy Director 
General Mehmet Guzel to discuss recent Turkish Customs 
activities.  Guzel informed EXBS Advisor that he had just 
recently been promoted to the position of DDG.  EXBS Advisor 
provided Guzel with an update on the Targeting and Risk 
Management Workshop.  Guzel stated that Turkish Customs would 
like to change the location from the Port of Izmir to Mersin, 
as they feel it could have a wider benefit to the customs 
officials at this Port.  EXBS Advisor agreed and stated that 
this should not be difficult to change at this time. 
Finally, Guzel reviewed recent customs cases to show how 
close cooperation between Turkish Customs and other customs 
services successfully stopped the illegal transfer of  dual 
use items through Turkey. 
 
EXBS Advisor met with DG for EU and External Relations Riza 
Korkmaz.  Korkmaz provided additional information on recent 
Turkish Customs case involving a shipment of materials to 
Iran and the level of cooperation between other countries and 
Turkey in stopping this activity.  Korkmaz also confirmed 
that Turkish Customs had submitted 4 major projects for 
consideration in the next round of EU/World Bank accession 
funding for Turkey. Korkmaz added that he will continue to 
encourage senior customs officials to voice their support for 
the NP Agreement with Turkish Parliament contacts. 
 
2)         July 12 - EXBS Advisor held monthly update meeting 
with MFA First Secretary for Arms Control and Disarmament 
Guven Begec to discuss current projects in Turkey, including

Training (CIT), Product Identification Tool (PIT) and Second 
Line of Defense (SLD). EXBS Advisor updated Begec on 
activities that are being planned with Turkish Customs and 
Foreign Trade concerning the ICP and PIT projects and also 
the upcoming workshops which will be held in Izmir and Mersin 
at the ports.  Begec commented that this increased 
cooperation between US and Turkey should help to strength the 
our ties while also making it more difficult for those 
wanting to violate international law.  Begec also discussed 
new Global Security Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
 
ANKARA 00004563  002 OF 002

DOC personnel.  EXBS Advisor provided updates on program and 
all projects underway in Turkey, along with planning for 
future activities.  EXBS Advisor conducted detailed planning 
for upcoming CBP Targeting and Risk Management Workshop and 
CG Port Security/ Port Vulnerability Workshop.  DOE/INECP 
discussed ideas for increasing the participation of Turkish 
representatives in regional workshops and training 
activities, such as including them as speakers/instructors 
and leaders of break-out groups.  This would further 
demonstrate increased multi-national efforts to stop
