SUBJECT: PRC PROPOSES ISSUING LIMITED NUMBER OF ONE YEAR 
MULTIPLE ENTRY VISAS TO U.S. SIX-PARTY TALKS DELEGATES 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MFA Office of Korean Peninsula Affairs Deputy 
Director MA Jia called representatives from the U.S., 
ROK and Japanese Embassies February 7 to deliver 
diplomatic notes proposing to issue one-year multiple 
entry diplomatic visas to four officials from the 
United States, Japan and ROK who work on Six-Party 
Talks.  In return, China requests the United States, 
Japan and the ROK issue comparable visas to four PRC 
officials working on the Six-Party Talks. (See 
paragraph 4 for the translated note text.)  Ma said 
that Chinese, Russian and DPRK diplomats do not need 
visas to enter each other's countries.  Ma said China 
is making this offer to make it easier for U.S., 
Japanese and South Korean officials to travel to China 
on Six-Party Talks-related business. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poloff asked if the PRC is requesting that 
the United States reduce the number of one-year 
multiple entry visas issued to MFA officials to four, 
to which a taken aback Ma responded "most definitely 
not!"  Poloff noted that a number of PRC MFA officials 
who travel frequently to the United States already 
have one-year multiple entry visas.  Poloff noted that 
by making this offer, China accepts in principle that 
the PRC can issue such visas and that Beijing is 
willing to do so when it is in China's interest, but 
only as a special favor.  Undertaking to report the 
PRC proposal to Washington, Poloff suggested that 
issuing longer validity multiple entry visas to 
officials with a clear need for frequent travel should 
not be viewed as a favor but rather as in the mutual 
interest of all parties. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Noh agreed with Poloff's position, making the 
point that four visas are far too few.  Suzuki said 
some of the Japanese delegation members, like MOFA DDG 
Sasae, already have one-year multiple-entry visas and 
inquired if China would issue four additional visas. 
Ma responded that China would issue four visas in 
total for each country's delegation.  Poloff commented 
that some of the members of the PRC's Six-Party Talks 
delegation already have one-year multiple entry visas 
and asked if they would count against the total, to 
which Ma made clear that the PRC is seeking four 
additional multiple entry visas to be issued to Asian 
Affairs Department officials.  Ma said she would 
convey the responses to her superiors. 
 
¶5.  (U) Action Request:  Please provide post with 
points to respond to the Chinese suggestion. 
 
¶6. (U) Text of diplomatic note: 
 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic 
of China 
 
(2006) Ministry note 11 
 
The United States Embassy in China, 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's 
Republic of China presents its compliments to the U.S. 
Embassy in China and has the honor to inform it of the 
following notice: 
 
In order to facilitate the mutual efforts of China and 
the United States and to promote the process of the 
Six-Party Talks, China is willing to issue one-year 
multiple-entry visas during 2006-2007 to four key 
participants in the Six-Party talks from the U.S. 
Department of State.  The United States is free to 
decide the recipients. 
 
The Chinese hopes the United States will, in 
accordance with the principle of reciprocity, issue 
one-year multiple-entry visas during 2006-2007 to four 
key participants in the Six-Party Talks from the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic 
of China. 
 
(complimentary closing)
