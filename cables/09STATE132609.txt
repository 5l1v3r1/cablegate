SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING: SUDAN 
 
STATE 00132609  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1. The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the 
risks of travel to Sudan, and recommends that all travel 
to Sudan be deferred due to uncertain security 
conditions and the possibility of violence and 
harassment targeting westerners.  This Travel Warning 
for Sudan updates and replaces the Travel Warning issued 
on April 8, 2009. 
 
¶2. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Sudan despite 
the Travel Warning should maintain contingency plans to 
depart Sudan in the event of an emergency.  The U.S. 
Embassy is committed to assisting U.S. citizens to the 
extent possible, but the Embassy's ability to assist is 
limited, and dependent on the permissiveness of the 
security environment in Sudan.  The ability of the 
Embassy to provide assistance to U.S. citizens is 
particularly limited in Southern Sudan and in Darfur. 
 
¶3. On January 1, 2008, two U.S. Embassy employees were 
assassinated while traveling in their vehicle in 
Khartoum.  In May 2008, the city of Omdurman, adjacent 
to Khartoum, was attacked by armed militias.  The 
Embassy has implemented heightened security measures to 
protect Embassy personnel in Sudan, which include 
obtaining advance permission for travel outside of 
Khartoum and requiring transportation in Embassy- 
operated vehicles at all times. 
 
¶4. The Department of State continues to warn U.S. 
citizens against all travel to Sudan, particularly in 
the Darfur area, where outbreaks of violence between 
Sudanese government forces and various armed militias 
continue.  U.S. citizens and Europeans have been victims 
of kidnappings, carjackings, and armed robberies while 
traveling in Sudan.  There have been several kidnappings 
of European NGO workers and Chinese oil workers over the 
past eighteen months.  Land travel at night should be 
avoided. 
 
¶5. Travelers are reminded that the U.S. Government has 
received information on terrorist threats against U.S. 
and European interests in Sudan.  Terrorist actions may 
include suicide operations, bombings, and kidnappings. 
U.S. citizens should be aware of the risk of 
indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in public 
places, including tourist sites and locations where 
expatriates are known to congregate, and commercial 
operations associated with U.S. or European interests. 
Anti-U.S./European demonstrations occur periodically, 
mostly in the capital city of Khartoum. 
 
¶6. Travel anywhere in Sudan, including Khartoum and the 
adjacent town of Omdurman, is potentially dangerous. 
Militia forces have instigated sporadic violence and 
have attacked locations in Southern Sudan.  Threats have 
been made against foreigners working in the oil industry 
in Upper Nile state. 
 
¶7. The Department of State urges U.S. citizens to take 
responsibility for their own personal security while 
traveling overseas, to review emergency procedures and 
contingency plans, and to remain aware of their 
surroundings at all times.  U.S. citizens in Sudan 
should ensure they have sufficient water, food, and 
supplies on hand in the event of an emergency.  The 
dynamic political situation may require the U.S. Embassy 
in Khartoum or the U.S. Consulate General in Juba to 
close for safety and security reasons, without advance 
notice.  The Embassy will seek to notify U.S. citizens 
of such closures via warden message, which are posted at 
 
STATE 00132609  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
http://sudan.usembassy.gov/warden_messages.ht ml. 
 
¶8. U.S. citizens should note that the Embassy may vary 
its operating hours without advance notice due to 
changes in the political and security situation. 
Services for U.S. citizens are available by appointment 
only.  Requests for an appointment may be made by e- 
mailing KhartoumConsular@state.gov, or by clicking on 
the link found on the following web page: 
http://sudan.usembassy.gov/service.html.  U.S. citizens 
may request emergency services at any time by calling 
the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, but the ability of the 
U.S. Embassy or the Consulate General in Juba to assist 
U.S. citizens in an emergency is limited. 
 
¶9. The U.S. Embassy is located at Sharia Ali Abdul 
Latif, Khartoum; tel. (249) 1-8701-6000.  U.S. citizens 
may contact the consular section by phone or by email at 
KhartoumConsular@state.gov.  Additional information and 
U.S. Embassy warden messages are available on our 
website, http://sudan.usembassy.gov.  For after-hours 
emergencies, please call 091-253-4200 and ask to be 
connected to the embassy duty officer. 
 
¶10. U.S. citizens should also consult the Department of 
State's Country Specific Information for Sudan and the 
Worldwide Caution, both located on the Department's 
Internet website at http://travel.state.gov.  The latest 
safety and security information is also available toll- 
free at 1-888-407-4747 from within the United States and 
Canada, or at regular toll rates at 1-202-501-4444 for 
callers outside the United States and Canada, from 8:00 
a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday 
(except U.S. federal holidays). 
 
¶11. U.S. citizens living or traveling in Sudan are 
encouraged to register with the U.S. Embassy through the 
State Department's secure travel registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov. 
 
¶12. Minimize considered.
