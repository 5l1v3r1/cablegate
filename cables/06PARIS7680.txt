Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On November 30, the French Constitutional Council indicated 
that the GOF energy bill was constitutional with two changes:  1) 
the Suez-Gaz de France (GDF) merger cannot legally take place before 
July 1, 2007, when GDF loses its monopoly to supply gas to private 
homes; 2) the GOF energy bill's provisions on regulated prices are 
invalid since they are incompatible with the 2003 EU energy 
directives.  The Suez-GDF deal, which looked like a done deal a few 
weeks ago, could become an issue for debate in the upcoming 
Presidential campaign, with reversal all but certain in the case of 
a center-left victory by Segolene Royal, and possible even if the 
center-right wins.  End Summary. 
 
Privatization of Suez-GDF postponed until July 2007 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) The merger of French energy groups GDF and Suez hit trouble 
on November 30 when the Constitutional Council, which rules on the 
conformity of government legislation with the French Constitution, 
decided to delay the deal until July 1, 2007.  This is the date on 
which France will fully deregulate its natural gas market, ending 
GDF's monopoly as a public gas service.  The companies and the GOF 
had hoped to finalize the 83.0 billion euro (USD 106.8 billion) 
merger by the end of this year.  However, the Council stated that 
the postponement did not preclude preparation for the merger.  As a 
result, the annual general shareholders' meetings of both Suez and 
GDF are expected to take place early next year, and the management 
of the two firms will continue to discuss the details of the merger. 
 Although this is clearly a setback for the GOF, the government 
claimed victory, indicating that the court found the legislation and 
the merger constitutional. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The 120 Socialist and Communist parliamentarians who 
brought the case before the Constitutional Council likewise claimed 
victory.  Together with the GDF unions, they oppose a deal entailing 
GDF privatization.  National Assembly Socialist Party faction leader 
Jean-Marc Ayrault stated that the Council had put "the future of GDF 
in the hands of the French people" and that "a majority on the left 
would be in a position to put an end to this privatization" 
following the election.  The CGT Communist-led union called the 
Council decision "a major slap for (French Prime Minister Dominique 
de) Villepin and (French Economy and Finance Minister Thierry) 
Breton." 
 
¶4. (SBU) This decision follows another major legal setback on 
November 21 when the Paris Court of Appeals ordered a postponement 
of a GDF board of directors meeting, scheduled to discuss the 
planned merger, to provide the GDF workers' council sufficient time 
to review the merger proposal and give its opinion.  The court also 
granted the GDF workers' council the right to designate an expert to 
review the proposed merger.  The GDF workers' council, which 
represents employees and unions, filed a suit to delay the GDF board 
meeting until it has enough information on the social impact of the 
merger.  During Parliamentary debates, French energy unions claimed 
that dozens of thousands of jobs would be lost as a result of the 
Suez-GDF transaction.  GDF immediately appealed, but the appeals 
court upheld the original ruling.  The delay in the shareholders' 
vote on the deal until next spring means that it will take place 
during the campaign for the April and May 2007 presidential and the 
June 2007 legislative elections. 
 
Ruling against regulated energy tariffs 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) While the energy bill was being debated in the National 
Assembly, legislators from all political parties introduced a 
formula for regulating tariffs on energy prices, to be renewed every 
year.  Their clear hope was to protect themselves against 
anti-merger sentiment in their campaign for the June 2007 
Parliamentary elections.  They argued that gas prices would rise 
more quickly under a privatized entity than under state control. 
However, the Constitutional Council ruled against these 
parliamentary amendments, indicating that they were contrary to the 
EU energy directives.  Although this part of the Council's decision 
has received very little press and public attention, it effectively 
restores the original purpose of the GOF energy bill, which was to 
liberalize the French energy market and transpose the 2003 EU energy 
directives into French law.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The two appeals this month prove that the unions and their 
political supporters on the left intend to fight GDF's privatization 
and make it a political issue during the upcoming Presidential and 
legislative elections.  Doing the deal before the election would be 
tricky, but postponing it until July 2007 will be even harder. 
Socialist candidate Segolene Royal, has vowed to renationalize GDF 
if she wins.  Likely ruling UMP candidate Nicolas Sarkozy might drop 
his half-hearted support for the merger.  Energy experts, however, 
are relieved that the Constitutional Council eliminated the 
regulated tariffs, and markets welcomed the news by bidding up EDF 
share prices.  The decision is an important step in fully opening 
French energy markets to competition by July 1, 2007.  End Comment.
