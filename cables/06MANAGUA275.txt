SUBJECT: NICARAGUA ONE STEP CLOSER TO CAFTA RATIFICATION: 
U.S. MEAT AND POULTRY INSPECTION SYSTEM DECLARED EQUIVALENT 
 
REF: A. MANAGUA 0026 
 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 0256 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Denis Salgado, Nicaragua,s Director 
General of Animal and Plant Health, told Econoffs on February 
2 that the Ministry of Agriculture (MAGFOR) has found the 
U.S. meat and poultry inspection system 
&equivalent8 to the Nicaraguan inspection regime.  This 
essential step for entry into force of CAFTA-DR came after a 
whirlwind trip by six Nicaraguan inspectors to USDA 
headquarters and various meat and poultry facilities in the 
U.S.  The trip was hastily arranged in an effort to clear the 
way for entry into force before March 1 (all requirements for 
which must be completed by February 16).  While the 
Nicaraguan audit team reported some "deficiencies,8 they 
were satisfied overall. Salgado expected to send a letter 
formalizing the determination of equivalency at any time, 
although it is also possible that equivalency will instead be 
granted through a ministerial agreement. (MAGFOR is 
evaluating which is required.)  Post extends its gratitude to 
FAS and the entire USDA team in Managua, San Jose, 
Washington, and several states for their efficiency, 
responsiveness, and professionalism in organizing a 
successful audit by MAGFOR inspectors.  Hurculean efforts to 
pull together an audit agenda and fund travel of the 
Nicaraguan inspectors - all within three days - were a 
crucial contribution to the implementation of CAFTA-DR.  USDA 
also deserves credit for deftly handling potential problems 
during the inspections.  End Summary. 
 
Something to Crow About

¶2. (SBU) Despite the GON,s inability to fund travel for the 
MAGFOR audit team and the difficulty of arranging the trip on 
very short notice, the Nicaraguans were able to assess USDA 
inspection procedures in a variety of settings.  The audit 
team accompanied USDA inspectors at several beef, pork, and 
poultry processing plants in three states.  According to USG 
sources and Salgado, most of the stops went reasonably well, 
and the overall determination of MAGFOR was to recognize the 
USDA meat and poultry inspection system as equivalent to 
Nicaragua,s own regime.  Department of Agriculture officials 
who accompanied the MAGFOR personnel report that the 
Nicaraguans seemed 
&professional and not political.8  The reason for the lack 
of lead time in arranging the inspection tour was a joint USG 
and GON desire to meet all preconditions for CAFTA-DR by 
February 16, in order to qualify for entry into force on 
March 1.  This hurdle has now been cleared.  (Comment: Other 
preconditions, such as legislative action on Intellectual 
Property Rights and Penal Code reforms still remain, although 
there remains cause for cautious optimism for meeting the 
February 16 deadline.  See REFTEL Managua 0256.  End Comment). 
 
Inspectors Have Some Beefs

¶3. (SBU) The visits to the meat and poultry processing plants 
were not without problems.  At a poultry facility in Georgia, 
there was miscommunication within the company about the level 
of access the audit team should have.  The group was told the 
next day that they could return to the plant, but the 
Nicaraguans declined, saying they obtained enough information 
from their visit to a second plant in the area.  While stops 
at two beef and one pork plant in Texas went well, a second 
pork facility that made sausage had a few regulatory 
compliance issues.  The Nicaraguan auditors acknowledged that 
the USDA official acted appropriately to address the 
situation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Nicaraguan auditors noted some differences 
between what the FSIS inspectors look for when they come to 
Nicaragua and what the inspectors in the U.S. plants look 
for.  Salgado also mentioned factors, that in his view, give 
Nicaraguan inspectors more authority than their U.S. 
counterparts.  The GON plans to write a report including a 
list of suggestions for improvements to the U.S. system. 
(Comment: MAGFOR sees these recommendations as constructive 
and they are not offering the report just to be critical. 
Perhaps this is a positive indication that MAGFOR takes its 
role in protecting animal and human health seriously.  End 
Comment). 
 
Will Nicaraguan Audit Herd Other CAFTA Countries to Action?

¶5. (SBU) Salgado indicated that MAGFOR,s initiative in 
conducting an equivalency audit had elicited strong, negative 
reactions from the other CAFTA signatory countries, 
especially from the Honduran and Salvadoran Ministries of 
Agriculture.  When asked what factors set Nicaragua apart in 
its more deliberative approach on the equivalency, Salgado 
suggested that his Central American counterparts, and their 
supervisors in government, have a "closer relationship with 
the private sector.  Some are producers themselves."  He also 
noted that Nicaragua set a precedent; other signatory 
countries are now taking action and planning to conduct 
similar audits of the U.S. meat and poultry evaluation system.
