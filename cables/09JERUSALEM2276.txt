PLO Central Council Meeting 
--------------------------- 
 
The three dailies lead with news on the opening session of the PLO 
Central Council Meeting in Ramallah yesterday. Palestinian Authority 
(PA) President Mahmoud Abbas is quoted saying that he won't run for 
re-election and accused Hamas of obstructing national reconciliation 
efforts by not signing the Egyptian proposal. He reiterated that the 
Palestinians will not resume negotiations with the Israelis without 
a complete cessation in settlement activity. Abbas also stated that 
the PA will not accept a Palestinian state with temporary borders, 
and noted that they will seek a UNSC resolution that recognizes the 
1967 borders as the borders of the Palestinian state.

Khaled Misha'l in Iran: 
----------------------- 
 
PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and independent Al-Ayyam front 
page news on the head of the Hamas Political Bureau Khaled Mishal's 
visit to Iran yesterday. During a press conference in Tehran, Mishal 
noted that the release of kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit 
will be achieved only when Israel agrees to Hamas conditions 
regarding the deal, and is quoted saying "If Netanyahu and Israeli 
officials don't agree to our conditions, they will not see Shalit 
again." 
 
---------------------------------- 
Arrest Warrant Against Tzipi Livni 
--------------------------------- 
 
The dailies continue to report on the arrest warrant issued by a 
British court against former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni 
for her involvement in Israel's assault on Gaza last winter. 
Independent daily Al-Ayyam front pages news citing AFP that Israel 
will not let Britain play a key role in the peace process unless the 
latter takes appropriate measures to prevent such warrants against 
Israeli officials. According to independent news outlet Maan, a 
statement was released by the Israeli Foreign Ministry stating that 
"Israel rejects the cynical legal move made in the British court 
against the Head of the Opposition, MK Tzipi Livni, at the behest of 
radical elements."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Hani Habib writing in Al-Ayyam under the title "The Central Council 
Restores its Role" opines that "President Abbas did not present 
anything new in the PLO Central Council meeting and nothing has 
changed in the Palestinian position regarding negotiations or 
elections ... However, what is new is that the PLO bodies are 
reclaiming their role, which was taken from them for many years."
