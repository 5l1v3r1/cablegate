SUBJECT: UNFICYP CONSULTATIONS, DECEMBER 5, 2008 
 
(U) 1. This is an action request.  USUN is instructed to draw 
from the discussion elements below during the United Nations 
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) consultations 
scheduled for December 5, 2008. 
 
Begin elements: 
 
-The United States welcomes Special Representative Zerihoun 
to the Council and thanks him for his comprehensive briefing 
today and for the service that he, as well as Special Advisor 
Downer, provide to the international community.  The United 
States would also like to recognize the positive leadership 
of Mr. Christofias and Mr. Talat.  It is encouraging that 
they have taken on primary responsibility for managing the 
negotiation process and reaching mutual agreement.  With this 
in mind, we would like to make the following points: 
 
-First, the United States welcomes the Secretary General,s 
report and agrees with his recommendation for an extension of 
UNFICYP,s mandate. 
 
-Second, we share the Secretary General,s assessment that 
progress has been made, especially since commencement of the 
full-fledged negotiations in September.  The leaders have met 
nine times and these meetings have enjoyed a positive and 
constructive dialogue. 
 
-The United States would also like to emphasize the 
tremendous goodwill both sides and their leaders have 
exhibited.  In this light, the United States joins the 
Secretary General in commending both sides for mutually 
agreeing to cancel their main annual military exercises.  We 
call on the two sides and their leaders to continue to 
support such gestures and to continue to engage the Cypriot 
communities to promote unity and understanding. 
 
-Nevertheless, we also urge both sides to build upon the 
current momentum and to recognize the necessity of 
intensifying the pace of the negotiations, using the 
technical committees, working groups, and additional informal 
consultations as necessary, to facilitate the process. 
Special Advisor Downer plays a critical role in this regard. 
 
 
-Third, the United States along with the international 
community continues to fully support this process which has 
as its goal the achievement of a bi-zonal, bi-communal 
federation. 
 
-Finally, we would like to stess that a lasting and durable 
settlement lies with the Cypriot communities themselves.  The 
United States urges the communities to take full advantage of 
the current unique and auspicious opportunity to achieve even 
more significant and decisive progress in the near future. 
 
  End Elements.
