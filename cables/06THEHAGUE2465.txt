(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche November 17 to Pieter 
van der Vliet, Head of the MFA's UN and IFIs Political and 
Legal Affairs Division.  Van der Vliet said that initial 
Dutch opposition to the resolution has weakened in the face 
of an evolving EU majority that looks set to support the 
resolution.  Van der Vliet said at this point, the Dutch are 
likely to abstain.  However, he noted, the GONL is still 
seeking textual revisions that would allow it to join the EU 
majority in favor.
