¶1.  (U) Action Request; please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The UK has contributed some 40 million British 
Pounds Sterling (BPS) to the Common Humanitarian Fund for 
Sudan (CHF) this fiscal year (April-March); it is up to UN 
Humanitarian Coordinator Manuel da Silva to disburse it as he 
sees fit.  That is HMG's answer to reftel demarche, conveyed 
to Poloff October 10 by FCO-DFID Sudan Unit Deputy Head James 
Thornton, who noted that the UN channels more CHF aid to 
southern Sudan than to Darfur, which would be politically 
impossible for the UK to do directly given the British 
public's strong and urgent interest in Darfur. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Thornton, speaking after consulting higher 
officials, added that HMG urges the USG to start thinking 
about what more it can do to bolster AMIS with or without a 
timely transition to the UN.  He was under the impression 
that the USG was unwilling to give any more support to AMIS 
absent such a transition. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action Requested:  We would be grateful for any 
update on USG thinking regarding support for AMIS that we can 
share with FCO in response to the point in paragraph 3 above.
