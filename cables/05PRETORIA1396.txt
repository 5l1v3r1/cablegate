Pretoria supports the recommended continuation of the multi- 
country Africa Malaria Global Fund project (MAF-202-G01-M- 
00).  The proposed extension is well-justified and we 
believe the additional funding will be effectively utilized. 
Post has received no negative feedback about the project or 
its implementation.  We appreciate the opportunity to 
contribute to the review of Global Fund awards.
