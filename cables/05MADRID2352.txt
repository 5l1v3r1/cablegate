¶2. Elena Rojas Romero 
   Senior Officer 
   Department of Legal Coordination and International 
Relations 
   Ministry of Justice 
 
Ms. Rojas prepares legal and policy recommendations for the 
Ministry of Justice on IPR-related matters, particularly the 
Ministry's position on the GOS's anti-piracy plan.  She is a 
good Embassy contact and enthusiastic about IPR issues.  She 
has worked for a law firm where knowledge of English was 
required and has studied twice in the United States for brief 
periods.  Ms. Rojas is available for the September 12-16 
program.  Post has Spanish CV for Ms. Rojas - we are prepared 
to translate the CV into English and transmit electronically 
to the Department and USPTO per request. 
 
¶3. Jesus Jose Tirado Estrada 
   Office Director 
   National Prosecutor's Office (Fiscalia General del Estado) 
 
Mr. Tirado has been a prosecutor for twenty years.  He is a 
good Embassy contact and should also prove to be a good 
conduit for additional nominations in years to come.  Mr. 
Tirado is committed to the fight against IPR piracy.  A key 
U.S. IPR policy goal in Spain is to encourage more forceful 
prosecution of IPR cases - nominating Mr. Tirado is 
consistent with that objective.  Mr. Tirado has participated 
in numerous national and international working groups on a 
variety of issues.  He has an interest in policy, which 
should be very useful as we encourage the GOS to prosecute 
IPR violators more vigorously.  Mr. Tirado has also published 
extensively,including, a 1998 article called "IPR-related 
Crimes:Analysis of articles 270 to 272 of the Criminal Code". 
Embassy has a Spanish CV for Mr. Tirado, which we are 
prepared to translate upon request. Mr. Tirado would prefer 
to attend the September session.
