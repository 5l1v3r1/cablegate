SUBJECT:  MGLE01: NATIONAL DIALOGUE POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER 
THE RETURN OF DRUZE LEADER JUMBLATT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The national dialogue came to a temporary halt on 
March 7 following a dispute between Hizballah SYG Nasrallah 
and Speaker Nabih Berri on the one hand and Minister of 
Information Ghazi Aridi, representing Druze leader Walid 
Jumblatt, on the other.  The disagreement arose over a 
statement made by Druze leader Walid Jumblatt in Washington 
in which Jumblatt labeled Hizballah as a militia and refuted 
Lebanese claims to Sheba'a farms.  Speaking to the 
participants in the session, Nasrallah said "I cannot 
continue the dialogue in the absence of Jumblatt," while 
Berri decided to postpone the dialogue until after the 
return of Jumblatt, despite strong opposition from Aridi. 
At last word, the dialogue will resume on March 13, 
following what Speaker Berri described as an opportunity for 
the dialogue participants to consult with their 
constituencies. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) It appears that Hassan Nasrallah used statements 
made by Jumblatt in Washington as a pretext to halt the 
current national dialogue.  Minister of Industry Pierre 
Gemayel, who is participating in the dialogue, told us March 
7 that at the initial session of that day's dialogue 
meeting, Nasrallah said that Hizballah couldn't continue the 
dialogue in the absence of Walid Jumblatt.  Gemayel told us 
Nasrallah argued that, "it does not make sense for us to 
continue the dialogue as long as Jumblatt is making his 
remarks outside the country."  Nasrallah added, "we came to 
the table with an open mind and we are aware that in the end 
we will have to give concessions, but entering in a dialogue 
does not mean that others should impose on us what they 
think is right."  Gemayel said that with that statement, 
Nasrallah walked out of the room. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Gemayel blamed Jumblatt for stirring up problems 
with Hizballah and noted that participants had been able to 
convince Nasrallah to agree to disarm Hizballah provided 
that Lebanon has a strong army that could defend the 
country.  Gemayel feared that friction with Jumblatt might 
bring Nasrallah to take a harder line with the other 
dialogue participants.  Other participants also echoed 
similar position and blamed Jumblatt for the deadlock.  MP 
Boutros Harb said, "Jumblatt's comments were unproductive," 
while MP Elie Skaff described them as "unhelpful and 
distractive." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Minister of Information Ghazi Aridi told us March 
7 that Hizballah used Jumblatt's comments, which he said 
were not new, as a pretext to foil the national dialogue. 
Aridi indicated that he rejected attempts to blame Jumblatt 
for the cessation of the talks and said that he rejected 
Speaker Berri's decision to adjourn the session until the 
return of Jumblatt.  Aridi said that Berri agreed to a 
conciliatory gesture toward Jumblatt and issued a press 
statement indicating that talks were postponed because there 
was a disagreement over the issue of Sheba' and not over 
Jumblatt's remarks.
