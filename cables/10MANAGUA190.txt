SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) During the January 28 Property Working Group 
 
meeting, Government of Nicaragua (GON) officials stated that the 
GON wants to improve its cooperation with U.S. citizen claimants to 
advance their claims, noting that the GON hopes to exceed the 
number of claims resolved during the last waiver year by February. 
One GON official reported that the National Property Appeals Court 
has been closed and all of the cases have been transferred to civil 
court.  Econoff pressed officials to advance claims with favorable 
court decisions, as well as non-waiver cases.  Econoff also 
emphasized the importance of confirming dates for the bilateral 
review, noting that these consultations are considered one of the 
benchmarks in granting a Section 527 waiver.  We believe that GON 
officials are promoting cooperation with U.S. claimants, and 
promising more progress on resolving claims, so that Attorney 
General Hernan Estrada can argue that his participation in a 
bilateral review during this waiver year is not necessary. 
 
 
 
IMPROVING COOPERATION WITH CLAIMANTS 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On January 28, Econoff held the monthly Property Working 
Group meeting with Ruth Zapata, Head of the Office of Assessment 
and Quantification (OCI); Magally Bravo, the Attorney General????s 
Executive Coordinator for Property Issues; Alfonso Solorzano, 
member of the National Confiscations Review Commission (CNRC); and 
Rebeca Zuniga, Coordinator of the Office of U.S. Citizen Claims. 
Zapata stated that the GON seeks to improve its cooperation with 
U.S. claimants to resolve more claims during this waiver year 
compared to the 2008-2009 waiver period (48) by February.  Zuniga 
provided Econoff a list of claimants and asked him to contact them 
so that she could either call or meet with them to discuss their 
claims. 
 
 
 
CLOSURE OF NAT'L PROPERTY APPEALS COURT 
 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Solorzano mentioned that the Nicaraguan Supreme Court 
closed the National Property Appeals Court (Ref A) on December 8, 
2009, because it had been slow and inefficient in adjudicating 
cases (septel).  He said that all of the cases have been 
transferred to civil court.  Econoff inquired whether the National 
Assembly amended Law 278/1997, which established the court, to 
close it.  Solorzano responded that he was not aware of the 
authority the Supreme Court invoked to close the court.  Econoff 
asked GON officials to provide information on how this appellate 
body had been closed to inform U.S. claimants with pending cases in 
the court. [Note: There are at least 15 U.S. claimants who have 
cases that await a decision in the National Property Appeals Court. 
End Note]. 
 
 
 
CLAIMS WITH FAVORABLE COURT RULINGS AND NON-WAIVER CASES 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Econoff pressed GON officials to advance claims 
 
with favorable court decisions and non-waiver cases.  Econoff noted 
that there are at least five claims with favorable court decisions 
that order the return of property to claimants, but the GON has 
failed to act.  With regard to non-waiver cases, he reminded them 
that the Embassy advocates on behalf of all U.S. citizen property 
claims regardless whether they fall under Section 527.  He 
emphasized that all U.S. property claims should be afforded equal 
due process to defend their property rights. 
 
 
 
BILATERAL REVIEW 
 
---------------- 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Econoff urged GON officials to confirm the dates for the 
bilateral review during this waiver year.  He explained that the 
bilateral review is considered one of the benchmarks in granting a 
Section 527 waiver.  Zuniga said that Attorney General Hernan 
Estrada would respond to the Ambassador's December 17, 2009 letter 
regarding possible dates for the bilateral review in March. 
 
 
 
COMMENT 
 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The GON's expression of improved cooperation with U.S. 
claimants should be interpreted with a degree of skepticism.  We 
believe that Attorney General Estrada is promoting this 
cooperation, and asserting further progress on resolving claims, to 
avoid his participation in the bilateral review in March or any 
time during this waiver year.
