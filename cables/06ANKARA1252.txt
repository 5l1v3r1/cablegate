SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE GRANTED FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
DANIEL FRIED, AMBASSADOR STEVEN MANN AND DELEGATION TO 
TRAVEL TO TURKEY MARCH 16 - 20, 2006 
 
REF: A. STATE 37043 
 
     ¶B. STATE 38462 
 
¶1. (U) Mission warmly welcomes and grants country clearance 
to Assistant Secretary Daniel Fried, Ambassador Steven Mann, 
and Elizabeth Rood to travel to Turkey from March 16 - 21, 
2006 for meetings with government officials. We understand 
that A/S Fried will depart Turkey on March 17, and Ambassador 
Mann and Ms. Rood will continue to Istanbul on March 19th, 
and leave Turkey on March 21, 2006.  We also understand, by 
separate communication, that David Merkel will not be 
accompanying the delegation. 
 
The point of contact for the visit is Political Officer Linda 
Fenton who can be reached at (90)(312) 455-5555 extension 0, 
24 hours a day or via cell phone at 0555 358 6805.  Hotel 
reservations have been made at the Ankara Sheraton, Noktali 
Sokak No. 47, Kavaklidere, Ankara, Phone Number 
90-312-468-5454, fax number 90-312-467-1136, for A/S Fried 
and Elizabeth Rood at the rate of 130 USD per night, 
excluding VAT and breakfast.  Istanbul arrangements and 
control officer information will be forwarded in separate 
communications. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Travelers are requested to forward fiscal data for 
after-hours and overtime transportation expenses. 
 
¶3. (U) Visas:  All Americans traveling to Turkey must have a 
valid visa.  Travelers without a visa can obtain a visa valid 
for one entry/three months at port of entry upon payment of a 
USD 20 fee.  This fee is payable only in U.S. dollars cash. 
There is no fee for official travel if the visa is obtained 
outside of Turkey. 
 
¶4. (U) Health Safety:  Information on vaccinations and other 
health precautions can be obtained from the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention hotline for international 
travelers (tel: 1-877-394-747); fax 1-800-232-3299; or via 
the internet at HTTP//www.cdc.gov. 
 
¶5. (U) Security Assessment:  In the aftermath of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom (OIF) there continues to be the potential for 
both transnational and indigenous terrorist groups to target 
U.S. interests in Turkey.  After the Gulf War, the 
predecessor to the Turkish Terrorist Group Revolutionary 
People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) assassinated four 
Americans in Turkey and carried out numerous bombings of U.S. 
targets (mostly private sector businesses, although two 
rockets were directed toward the Consulate General in 
Istanbul).  Subsequent to the ending of OIF hostilities, 
there have been isolated terrorist bombings attributed to 
DHKP/C and other indigenous terrorist groups in protest of 
OIF.  Other Turkish terrorist groups with anti-Western 
sympathies include Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (MLKP), 
Turkish Communist Party/Marxist Leninist (TKP/ML), Turkish 
Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Army (TIKKO) and Islamic 
Greater Eastern Raiders/Front (IBDA/C). 
 
Al-Qa'ida threats to target U.S. facilities in Turkey have 
been public knowledge for some time.  On November 15, two 
synagogues in Istanbul were the targets of suicide car bombs. 
On November 20, 2003, the British Consulate General and the 
London-based HSBC bank in Istanbul were damaged by powerful 
explosions, killing dozens and wounding hundreds.  These 
incidents represent a significant change from prior attacks 
in Turkey, which have previously involved small-scale, random 
bombings and small numbers of casualties.  The investigations 
of these incidents in Istanbul remain open but transnational 
terrorist links are suspected.  The potential for violence 
and terrorist actions against U.S. citizens and interests 
continue. 
 
The Turkish National Police (TNP) is quite responsive in 
their role as protector of U.S. diplomatic and military 
interests in Turkey.  The TNP has provided enhanced coverage 
at each of our facilities in Ankara, Istanbul, Adana and 
Izmir.  The incidence of crime, both violent and the more 
traditional tourist crimes (pick pocketing, purse-snatching, 
etc.), is relatively low throughout Turkey.  Visitors to 
Istanbul should be aware that tourist-type crimes are more 
prevalent there, especially in the traditionalist tourist 
areas, such as Sultanahmet and Istiklal Caddesi.  The 
security office encourages visitors to report any security 
incidents, including surveillance, to the RSO immediately.
