(SBU) Emboffs raised reftel points with Deputy Finance 
Minister Sergey Storchak and Special Envoy to Iraq Sergey 
Kirpichenko.  Storchak reported that Russia's bilateral 
agreement with Iraq was close to completion but offered no 
details regarding what issues remained pending.  Kirpichenko 
told Econoff he expected the agreement to be signed soon but 
was not familiar with the technical aspects of the 
discussions.  Storchak and Kirpichenko expressed confidence 
that the matter would be resolved before the planned signing 
of the International Compact for Iraq in mid-December.
