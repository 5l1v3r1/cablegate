¶1.  (SBU)  Summary. On June 16, the DCM delivered the 
Trafficking in Persons (TIP) demarche to Cambodian National 
Police Commissioner Hok Lundy.  While praising Cambodian 
actions to earn the upgrade from Tier 3 to Tier 2 Watch List, 
the DCM noted that arrests and prosecutions for TIP are down 
this year and urged greater activism by police, including in 
cooperation with NGOs and in confronting corruption in police 
ranks.  Lundy  stressed that anti-TIP work was one of the top 
three priorities of the Cambodian police force and pledged 
full cooperation.  End Summary.

TIP DEMARCHE 
------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On June 16, DCM delivered the Trafficking in 
Persons demarche to Police Commissioner Hok Lundy and 
informed Lundy that as a result of Cambodia's efforts it had 
been raised from Tier 3 to Tier 2 Watch List (Refs A and B). 
DCM thanked Lundy for his efforts to improve police 
enforcement on anti-TIP issues and urged increased 
cooperation by the Cambodian National Police (CNP) with NGOs. 
 DCM noted that arrests and prosecutions are down so far this 
year.  He asked that the police improve its performance in 
arrests and prosecutions.  He also urged the police to work 
harder to eliminate corruption by the police. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Lundy was delighted that Cambodia had been 
upgraded.  He promised to continue to work hard to 
investigate and prosecute those involved in TIP.  Lundy told 
the DCM that TIP was one of three issues, including narcotics 
and robbery, discussed at every monthly meeting of provincial 
police chiefs.  He commented that the national police have 
benefited from cooperating with NGOs, particularly 
International Justice Mission (IJM).

CORRUPTION IN THE POLICE 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Lundy emphasized how much corruption complicated 
his work, noting, for example, that twelve prisoners broke 
out of a prison last week and that three prison employees had 
been subsequently detained for complicity in the escapes. 
Lundy urged the Embassy to provide any information that may 
be helpful in investigating corruption or any other crimes. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  At this point, the A/RSO provided Lundy with 
information about a case of a suspected American pedophile 
active in Phnom Penh.  Lundy promised rapid investigation and 
complete cooperation with USG officials on this case.  Later 
in the day, General Un Sokunthea began working with ICE 
agents to prepare a warrant for the individual's arrest.
