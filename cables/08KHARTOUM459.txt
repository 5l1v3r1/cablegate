¶1. (SBU) MFA Protocol Director Ambassador Ali Yusuf called in CDA 
Fernandez and the UK Ambassador March 27, 2008 to advise us that 
both the US Embassy and the UK Embassy had been approved by the 
Sudanese Government to use non-diplomatic license plates for both 
official vehicles and personal vehicles in Sudan "in order to help 
protect our staff."  The measure will go into effect immediately and 
will remain in effect for a period of three months, though 
Ambassador Yusuf said it could be extended if the embassies felt 
that it is required.  Ambassador Yusuf said the embassies could 
request non-diplomatic plates for any number of our vehicles. The 
plates will be produced next week and the numbers assigned will be 
closely held by the MFA. There is a 50 dollar charge per license 
plate and the diplomatic plate must be exchanged for the regular 
plate (there was no flexibility on this point) but each vehicle will 
retain its diplomatic registration to show to police if stopped. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post will work out the logistics of the transfer of plates 
over the next week.
