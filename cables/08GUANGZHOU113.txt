¶1. (U) A Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region man has died of avian 
influenza (AI), according to the Health Ministry.  The Ministry said 
the patient was a 41-year-old unemployed man (surnamed Liang) from 
Xi Xiang Tang District in Nanning, the capital city of Guangxi. 
Liang developed symptoms on February 12, was admitted to a hospital 
for treatment on February 14 and died on February 20. 
 
¶2. (U) On February 20, laboratory tests performed by Guangxi Centre 
for Disease Control and Prevention yielded positive results for 
H5N1.  China CDC subsequently conducted its own test and confirmed 
the Guangxi results on February 21.  According to press reports, 
China's Ministry of Health has notified WHO, authorities in Hong 
Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as some foreign governments about 
the case.  This is the second confirmed human case of AI in China 
this year (ref A). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Epidemiologists concluded that the patient had come into 
contact with sick or dead poultry.  Those who came into close 
contact with the patient are currently under medical observation, 
but have shown no abnormal symptoms so far.  Dr. Chen Jie, Deputy 
Director of Guangxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told 
Congenoff that the government has not begun to cull poultry because 
this case appears to be an isolated one and authorities have not 
detected large-scale poultry deaths in Guangxi.
