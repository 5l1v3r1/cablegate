Address Enforcement Deficiencies 
 
REF: Guangzhou 701 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Science Fellow (ESF) provided environmental 
permit training on May 14 to Shenzhen Environmental 
Protection Bureau (EPB) experts in response to Pearl River 
Delta environmental authorities' concerns over deficiencies 
in their enforcement program.  ESF explained how the U.S. 
EPA uses permits to control industrial and municipal 
pollutant dischargers.  Training covered the permit 
system's legal framework, the use of general and individual 
permits, technology-based and water quality-based permit 
limitations, monitoring, and reporting.  Shenzhen 
environmental officials - widely regarded as having one of 
the most advanced and innovative environmental programs in 
China - responded positively to the training, while 
Guangdong EPB and the Guangzhou State Environmental 
Protection Administration (SEPA) officials declined to 
attend. 
 
¶2. (U) ESF also provided training in Beijing on April 19-20 
for SEPA and EPB officials on hazardous waste management, 
permit systems for power generators, treatment and disposal 
facilities, inspection tools and enforcement. 
 
¶3. (U) Participants inquired about how EPA and States 
delineate respective jurisdictional authorities, how EPA 
makes sure State agencies comply with requirements, and 
about permit fees.  ESF distributed sample permit 
application forms, showed participants copies of actual 
permits, and described the permit public notice process.  A 
major part of the training focused on the development of 
permit limitations and a discussion on technology-based 
limitations for industry and secondary treatment for 
municipal dischargers.  ESF stressed that monitoring and 
other reporting are an integral part of the overall permit 
program and necessary for effective compliance and 
enforcement. 
 
¶4. (U) EPB compliance and enforcement efforts vary widely 
depending on location and local government support.  Permit 
training in other large mainland cities will help companies 
know precisely what is expected of them and will help the 
Chinese develop a fair and transparent compliance and 
enforcement system.
