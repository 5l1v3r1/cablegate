Control and Disarmament Director Laura Kansikas-Debraise on 
November 2.  Kansikas-Debraise expressed appreciation for 
the letter and for U/S Joseph's position on UNSCR 1718, 
underscoring the importance that the GOF attaches to this 
resolution and its faithful implementation.  Finland's

matches that of the US; "there is no ambiguity" on this 
issue, she added.
