Health and Security Information 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Health: In general the health problems in Morocco are 
very similar to those of the United States with a few 
exceptions.  There are no required immunizations for entry 
into Morocco. Recommended vaccines are Hepatitis A and B, 
Typhoid, Rabies pre-exposure and current Tetanus/Diptheria. 
The number one risk for serious medical problems in Morocco 
is traffic accidents.  The range in the availability and 
quality of health care varies from almost non-existent in 
many rural areas to good care available in Rabat, Casablanca, 
and some of the other metropolitan areas.  Emergency services 
are not comparable to what we would find in the United 
States.  Therefore, injury prevention is extremely important 
as you move about the country. 
 
¶4.  (U) Terrorism: In March/April 2007, a series of terrorist 
bombings occurred in Casablanca, two of which simultaneously 
targeted the U.S. Consulate General and the private American 
Language Center.  In 2003, a series of similar attacks in 
Casablanca targeted hotels and restaurants.  The potential 
for terrorist violence against American interests and 
citizens remains high in Morocco.  Moroccan authorities 
continue to disrupt groups seeking to attack U.S. or 
Western-affiliated and Moroccan government targets, arresting 
numerous individuals associated with international terrorist 
groups.  With indications that such groups still seek to 
carry out attacks in Morocco, it is important for American 
citizens to be keenly aware of their surroundings and adhere 
to prudent security practices such as avoiding predictable 
travel patterns and maintaining a low profile. 
Establishments that are readily identifiable with the United 
States are potential targets for attacks.  These may include 
facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners 
congregate, including clubs, restaurants, places of worship, 
schools, hotels, movie theaters and other public areas.  Such 
targets may also include establishments where activities 
occur that may offend religious sensitivities, such as 
casinos or places where alcoholic beverages are sold or 
consumed.  Travelers should stay abreast of recent 
developments within the country and read the latest State 
Department Consular Information Sheet covering travel to 
Morocco and any current Worldwide Caution Messages about 
travel to the Middle East and North Africa before arrival in 
country.  The Mission takes all information concerning 
terrorist incidents and terrorism very seriously.  The 
Mission investigates all incidents fully in conjunction with 
Moroccan authorities.  All travelers are expected to report 
any suspicious incidents or information to the RSO 
immediately, 24 hours a day, at Tel. 0537-76-96-39. 
 
¶5.  (U) Crime: The threat level for crime in Morocco has been 
designated "high".  Crimes including aggressive panhandling, 
pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, theft from vehicles and 
harassment of women are reported most frequently.  They are 
more likely to occur in crowded market areas, transportation 
centers, parks and beaches.  Additionally, criminals have 
brandished weapons, primarily knives, during some street 
robberies.  These have generally occurred at night in either 
isolated places or areas less frequented by visitors.  It is 
always best to have a travel companion and utilize taxis from 
point to point, particularly at night. 
 
Taxis and trains in Morocco are generally crime-free, though 
city buses are not considered safe.  Avoid carrying large 
sums of cash and be particularly alert when utilizing ATM 
machines.  In the event you are victimized by crime or an 
attempted crime please report the incident to the Consulate 
General in Casablanca as soon as possible. 
 
¶6.  (U) Demonstrations and Harassment: Demonstrations occur 
frequently in Morocco and usually center on local domestic 
issues.  During periods of heightened regional tension, large 
demonstrations may take place in the major cities.  All 
demonstrations require a government permit, but on occasion 
spontaneous unauthorized demonstrations may occur. Avoid 
demonstrations if at all possible.  If caught in a 
unauthorized demonstrations, remain calm and move away 
immediately when provided the opportunity.  Women walking 
alone in certain areas of cities and rural areas are 
particularly vulnerable to harassment from men.  Women are 
advised to avoid walking or traveling alone.
