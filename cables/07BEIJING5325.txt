¶2. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Chen Zhishan of 
the MFA's Department of International Organizations on August 
¶13.  Chen said he would convey our message but noted that the 
UN Security Council had passed resolution 1769 relatively 
recently, so the United States "should have some patience." 
He also stressed the need to include the Government of Sudan 
in any solution.  On August 14, Poloff contacted Chen again. 
He said the MFA is not yet prepared to offer a substantive 
response.
