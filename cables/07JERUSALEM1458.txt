POORLY-RUN CHECKPOINTS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) ConGenOffs traveled on July 12 and 13 throughout 
the areas surrounding the West Bank cities of Tubas, Nablus, 
Salfit, and Qalqiliya for a snap-shot view of the movement 
and access issues facing Palestinians.  Several truck loads 
of freshly-picked Jordan Valley vegetables waited in a 
four-to-six hour long line to pass through al-Badhan 
checkpoint, which is located between the agriculturally-rich 
governorate of Tubas and the city of Nablus.  Nearby 
residents said that this wait occurs every day.  An area 
store owner said that traffic was normal July 12, as was the 
wait at the nearby checkpoint.  Due to the checkpoints, a 
trip by truck from Tubas to Ramallah takes around six to 
seven hours, while the trip to Amman takes roughly 12 hours - 
four times more than the same trips eight years ago, 
according to several residents. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ConGenOffs observed July 13 that a number of 
Palestinian villages north of Ramallah and south of Nablus 
remained closed off from major access roads.  Berms, boulders 
and gates placed by the IDF prevented Palestinians in these 
areas from reaching main roads or moving between nearby 
villages. 
 
Lack Of Consistent 
Handling At Checkpoints 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Many Israeli soldiers at the checkpoints did not 
use hand-signals or give clear instruction to vehicles 
waiting for passage.  ConGenOffs observed that the soldiers' 
practices were often inconsistent and confusing.  ConGenOffs 
observed IDF soldiers requesting Palestinian men to exit 
their cars and taxis for questioning.  These men were left 
standing in lines on the side of the road.  During passage 
through the Nablus-area Huwwara checkpoint, as the Israeli 
soldiers questioned the U.S. staff regarding their travels in 
the area, one of the soldiers shouldered his rifle and 
pointed it at the vehicle's rear door window, asking the U.S. 
staff whether it was really bulletproof. 
 
Barrier Construction Moves 
Forward Near Ariel Settlement 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Israeli separation barrier construction surrounding 
the Ariel and Emmanual settlements continues.  In what 
resembles the construction of a four-lane highway, land has 
been cleared and finely graded in preparation for the actual 
separation barrier's construction.
