 ¶1. (SBU) Ref A requested Embassy assistance in conducting a 
post-shipment check on license 05-050080456 for export of 
unclassified pizoresistive accelerometers to IABG mbH in 
 
SIPDIS 
Lichtenau, Germany.  Ref requested that post contact the 
foreign end user and confirm receipt of the item, exact 
quantity, specific type and intended use.  The reason for 
this end-use check is these articles represent a sensitive 
commodity with potential for diversion.  The stated 
application for these articles is to measure the shock 
environment during blast experiments simulating terrorist and 
crime attacks against civilian armored vehicles  intended for 
use by non-military government and business administration 
personnel and cash transports. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post received an e-mail March 12 from IABG with an 
attached bill of delivery confirming that three 
accelerometers model 7270A-60KM6 arrived in Lichtenau on 
February 4, 2008.  The e-mail from IABG listed the individual 
identification numbers for the three accelerometers as 
F24083, F30828 and F30913.  IABG's e-mail stated that the 
company has no intention to redistribute the items to a third 
party after completion of testing.  Global Affairs officer 
confirmed in a February 14 telcon with IABG that the testing 
scenario is as described in paragraph one and ref A.  Post 
forwarded the IABG e-mail March 12 to PM/DTCC Blue Lantern 
Coordinator (ref B).
