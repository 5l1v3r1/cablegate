¶1.  (SBU)  The Charge chaired on April 6 a meeting of the 
Embassy's Homeland Security Working Group (HSWG).  A/DCM, 
RSO, LEGAT, ORA, DEA, CONS, and ECPO attended. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  ECPO solicited input from HSWG members for the 
Embassy's response to ref A, concerning the Department-wide 
assessment of the Global War on Terror.  HSWG input was 
incorporated into Cairo's response, sent later on April 6 
(ref A). 
 
¶3. (SBU) ECPO led a discussion among HSWG members on recent 
developments in terrorism cases, reported in detail in ref C. 
 HSWG members agreed the GOE's aggressive prosecution of 
these terrorism cases was indicative of Egypt's resolve to 
maintain a vigilant counterrorism program. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ECPO and HSWG members discussed modalities for 
staging the second U.S.-Egypt Counterterrorism Joint Working 
Group, tentatively proposed for Washington in June.  ECPO 
noted financial considerations would form part of the GOE's 
calculus in determining whether to come to Washington. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The Consul General updated the HSWG on efforts 
return an abducted AmCit minor to the child's mother, in 
accordance with an Egyptian judicial order.  The Consul 
General advised that he was writing to a key contact in 
Egyptian State Security to reinforce frequent oral messages 
urging implementation of the Egyptian court order in the 
mother's favor. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Consul General thanked the Legal Attache's 
office for a recent Visa Viper submission and also urged all 
members of the HSWG to remain vigilant for information that 
could be used for new Viper entries.
