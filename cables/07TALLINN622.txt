(SBU) On August 27, we delivered reftel points to Riho 
Kruuv, MFA Director for Armament and Strategic Goods 
Control and Kadri Jogi, MFA Middle East Desk Officer, on 
urging support for the consensus package on the Middle 
East resolution.  On September 21, Jogi informed us that 
the Government of Estonia (GOE) abstained from 
supporting the common EU position at the IAEA general 
conference.  According to Jogi, the language of the EU's 
position was too weak, especially in regards to Iran. 
Jogi told us off-the-record that a number of other EU 
members abstained for the same reasons as the GOE. 
Together with these countries, Jogi said that the GOE 
will continue to lobby within EU fora to "toughen up" 
the EU's common position.
