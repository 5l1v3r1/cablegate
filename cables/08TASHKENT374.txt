¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post requests assistance in notifying Allied Joint 
Forces Command (JFC) Headquarters to disseminate required 
procedures for personnel transiting Uzbekistan territory via 
the Uzbek-German Air Base in Termez.  Post also requests the 
Department's and Embassy Kabul's assistance in disseminating 
correct information to relevant audiences.  The procedures 
apply to all U.S. military and diplomatic personnel assigned 
to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and/or 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) duty seeking 
transit through Termez when traveling on official business 
into and out of Afghanistan through Uzbekistan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The United States has only recently begun to 
exercise the "case-by-case" transit rights extended recently 
by the Government of Uzbekistan, and in each instance where 
U.S. personnel assigned to NATO/ISAF seek transit via Termez 
Airbase, the following procedures apply: 
 
(a) Each transit at present is considered on a case-by-case 
basis, and requests must first be submitted to the Defense 
Attache Office (DAO) of Embassy Tashkent for review; 
 
(b) The Embassy will then inform and seek transit permission 
from the Government of Uzbekistan by way of diplomatic note; 
 
(c) Under the present agreement with the Government of 
Uzbekistan, the right of transit via Termez Airbase is 
strictly for U.S. personnel assigned to NATO/ISAF in the 
conduct of official business.  Contractors are not authorized 
to use this air bridge. 
 
¶4. (U) Embassy Tashkent greatly appreciates assistance in 
this matter from the Department, Embassy Kabul, and the Joint 
Forces Command to ensure any transit by U.S. personnel via 
Termez Airbase is in accordance with the criteria of the 
transit agreement as understood by the Government of 
Uzbekistan.
