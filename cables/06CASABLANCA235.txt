protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) Summary: The Government of Morocco reported 
recently that the number of strikes in Morocco's 
private sector rose by 10 percent in 2005, compared to 
¶2004.  In contrast, however, the number of work-days 
lost to strikes fell to a low not seen since before the 
enactment of the new Labor Code.  In addition, the GOM 
claims that labor inspectors have had a strong hand in 
averting numerous work stoppages and settling worker 
claims in the informal process. End Summary.

Strike Styles Change 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) According to statistics from Morocco's 
Directorate of Labor, the number of strikes in the 
private sector rose 10 percent to 154 in 2005, compared 
to 140 in 2004, 146 in 2003, and 237 in 2002.  The 
increase is surprising considering the downward trend 
seen since the implementation of the new Labor Code. 
Even more surprising are related statistics.  In 2005 
the number of days lost to strikes dropped a 
significant 27.5 percent to 72,745 compared to the 
previous year's 100,301.  The number of workers 
participating in strikes, however, increased by a 
whopping 66.6 percent. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Labor Inspectors Making a Difference 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Morocco's approximately 300 labor inspectors 
are struggling under the new, more stringent, Labor 
Code, however, they appear to be making a difference. 
Unfortunately, according to the inspectors themselves 
they feel that they are stretched too thin to 
accomplish all that is required of them under the new 
code with the limited number of inspectors available. 
They appear to be somewhat successful, nevertheless, at 
assisting in mediating settlements of individual 
claims.  The inspectors maintain that, due to their 
intercession, 680 Moroccan firms were able to avoid 832 
threatened actions such as work stoppages, slowdowns, 
and strikes.  In addition, through intervention, the 
inspectors claim to have mediated disputes between 
individuals and firms settling claims allowing wage 
earners to recover more than 244.17 million dirhams in 
unpaid leave and other compensations, as well as 
payment for unlawful dismissals. 
 
--------------------------- 
Still no Strike Legislation 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) In 2003, Morocco's social partners attempted to 
hash out with the GOM, new legislation regulating the 
rules on workers' rights to strike(ref C).  After an 
initial year-long frenzy, with the proposed bill being 
passed to tripartite representatives for input, the 
bill faded into oblivion due to lack of willingness on 
the side of all three the social partners to 
compromise.  It has languished on the shelf for nearly 
two years.  (Note: According to some union 
representatives speaking unofficially, there is a 
chance that the bill may be resurrected at the time of 
the May Day labor celebrations.)

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Despite the increase in the actual number of 
strikes reported in Morocco in 2005, it appears the 
overall news is good on the labor front.  The fact that 
the number of days lost to actions is down and 
participation of employees is up could indicate a 
greater awareness on employees' part of the overall 
effect of the actions.  Morocco's Director of Labor, 
Abdelaziz Addoum, is optimistic about the future of 
Morocco's labor sector but admits there is still a long 
way to go.  In recent meetings with Laboff, he voiced 
his satisfaction with the USDOL Social Dialogue project 
but at the same time made it clear that he would 
welcome any further assistance available from the USG 
in areas still struggling to comply with the new code. 
The areas most in need of improvement are health and 
safety, mediation and arbitration, labor statistics and 
gender issues.
