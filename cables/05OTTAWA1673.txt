START MEMO POST-OBJ: 
Zarina Mulla is social planner for the City of Vancouver's 
Drug Policy Program. In this capacity, she is responsible 
for developing drug prevention programs that educate 
Vancouver's public on the dangers of drug abuse. Zarina has 
a strong interest in visiting U.S. municipal drug prevention 
programs to learn more about effective ways of providing 
community-based drug abuse education. We believe she is an 
excellent candidate for the IVL Multi-Regional Project on 
Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Education scheduled for 
November 10 - December 1, 2005. 
In 2001, the City of Vancouver's Drug Policy Program 
implemented the Four Pillars Drug Strategy, its nationally 
acclaimed policy and plan for reducing drug-related harm in 
Vancouver. The plan called for efforts to address drug abuse 
through four areas: harm reduction, enforcement, treatment 
and prevention. To date, most attention from politicians and 
policymakers has been given to the first pillar of harm 
reduction. Harm reduction receives public support from all 
directions to promote efforts to reduce the harm drug 
abusers inflict on themselves through controversial programs 
such as the Supervised Injection Site. Enforcement efforts 
make news daily, though primarily on arrests rather than 
convictions. Treatment receives some additional attention 
through a focus on needle exchange programs, methadone 
clinics, and the medically prescribed heroine trials 
currently underway known as the NAOMI Project. 
The pillar of drug prevention, however, receives very little 
public attention despite its goal of educating the public on 
the dangers of drugs. Zarina Mulla leads her office to 
create programs that aim to foster dialogue at community 
centers and schools on drug abuse education. She organizes 
dozens of creative programs, but Vancouver officials and the 
local media fail to promote them actively. Zarina is open to 
new, innovative approaches to community drug prevention 
programs that will catch the public's attention. We believe 
that participation in the IVL program will give her the 
opportunity to study such innovative approaches currently in 
use in the U.S. The knowledge she would gain through the 
program could then be applied to her efforts to provide 
Vancouver's population with effective drug prevention 
programming. 
Zarina came to Vancouver's Drug Policy Program in 2003, 
bringing extensive experience working with young ex-drug 
abusers during a stint overseas in Thailand. She works 
directly under Donald MacPherson, the Drug Policy 
Coordinator for Vancouver and chief architect of the Four 
Pillars Drug Strategy. Zarina is committed to a career in 
drug policy planning and will continue to play an important 
role in designing Vancouver's drug prevention programming 
and policy for years to come. For these reasons, we believe 
she is an ideal IVL Program candidate.
