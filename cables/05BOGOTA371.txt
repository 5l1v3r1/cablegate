E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: CASC PREL CO FARC
SUBJECT: PRESIDENT URIBE OFFERS REWARD FOR HOSTAGES AND 
FARC LEADERS 
 
 
¶1. (U) President Uribe addressed the nation from Serrania del 
Chiribiquete, Guaviare Department, on New Year's Eve 
highlighting his plans for 2005, including initiating a 
bounty hunter price against two FARC leaders, and a reward 
for the release of 63 hostages.  Uribe recognized the efforts 
of the police and military against Colombia's illegal armed 
groups and announced his hopes to reclaim the nation and 
finish the long journey towards peace by 2006. 
 
¶2. (U) President Uribe took aim at FARC Secretariat leaders 
Manuel Marulanda and Jorge Briceno by directing an 
unprecedented appeal to FARC members close to them, including 
radio operators and bodyguards.  He offered a reward of five 
billion Colombian pesos (roughly USD 2.2 million) to anyone 
who provided authorities with information leading to the 
leaders' capture.  He also urged guerrillas to desert and 
begin the demobilization and reinsertion program as 10,000 of 
their former comrades did in 2004. 
 
¶3. (U) Uribe went on to offer the same reward in exchange for 
information leading to the release or rescue of the 63 
hostages held by the FARC: three American hostages (Thomas R. 
Howes, Marc D. Gonsalves, and Keith D. Stansell), one German, 
and 59 Colombian nationals, including former senator and 
presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt.  He concluded with 
his hopes to strengthen the economy, employment 
opportunities, and social justice in 2005.
