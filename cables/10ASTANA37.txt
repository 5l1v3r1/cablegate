¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) This is an action request (see para 9). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On January 6, Post received a Kazakhstani 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' diplomatic note (see para 7), which 
outlined Kazakhstan's proposal to hold a Global Initiative to 
Counter Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) conference in Astana in April or 
May 2010.  On January 13, Kazakhstani Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 
Director of the Security Division of the Multilateral Cooperation 
Department, Anvar Tanalinov, asked PolOff and two Russian Federation 
representatives if the United States and Russia, as GICNT co-chairs, 
would support Kazakhstan's initiative.  Tanalinov also requested 
U.S. and Russian suggestions on the event's timing, topic, and 
audience.  Post recommends support for this initiative and seeks 
guidance for a response.  END SUMMARY. 
 
KAZAKHSTAN RESURRECTS PLAN TO HOST NON-PROLIFERATION EVENT 
 
¶4.  (SBU) During a January 13 meeting, Kazakhstani Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs' Director of the Security Division of the 
Multilateral Cooperation Department, Anvar Tanalinov told PolOff and 
Russian representatives that Kazakhstan seeks to hold a meaningful, 
timely, and substantive workshop.  He asserted Kazakhstan wants to 
host the event to meet the needs of the GICNT community, not merely 
to satisfy its own national interests.  (COMMENT:  Kazakhstan hosted 
two Global Initiative exercises in 2008, and had announced its 
intention to host two more exercises in 2009.  These 2009 proposed 
exercises were postponed indefinitely, reportedly due to Kazakhstani 
government budget constraints as a result of the economic crisis. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
AGENDA TO BE COUNTERING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING NUCLEAR SECURITY 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In response to Counselor of the Russian Embassy Vladimir 
Kuznetsov's query about possible topics and intended participation, 
Tanalinov emphasized Kazakhstan's openness "to any agenda related to 
combating nuclear terrorism and enhancing the physical security of 
nuclear facilities and materials."  Tanalinov stated Kazakhstan's 
plan to invite representatives of all government agencies with 
counter-terrorism responsibilities in the fields of nuclear and 
radiological materials, as well as those who guarantee the security 
of nuclear facilities and liaise with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA).  He also underlined that target participants 
would include representatives of special forces and academic 
institutions with nuclear-security related responsibilities. 
Tanalinov said the event would be geared toward senior experts, not 
Ministers.  Kazakhstan's Anti-Terrorist Center and Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs would organize the event, with the participation of 
specialists from the Ministry of Emergency Situations and Ministry 
of Interior. 
 
KAZAKHSTAN FLEXIBLE ON TIMING 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Underscoring Kazakhstan's desire for the event to 
complement the U.S. Government's April 12-13 Global Nuclear Security 
Summit, Tanalinov expressed the Kazakhstani government's willingness 
to hold the event before or after the summit.  Nonetheless, 
Tanalinov highlighted Kazakhstan's readiness to consider other 
proposed times should April not be suitable for the United States or 
Russia.  Most importantly, Tanalinov emphasized, Kazakhstan needs 
two months to plan adequately.  Tanalinov, therefore, requested that 
the United States inform Kazakhstan by February if it concurs with 
Kazakhstan's plan to host an April event. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) An unofficial translation of the Kazakh-language text of 
Kazakhstani Ministry of Foreign Affairs' diplomatic note number 
10-2/11 follows. 
 
 
ASTANA 00000037  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of 
America, and informs the United States that the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan proposes holding a Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism conference in Astana in April 
or May 2010.  In case of approval, the dates, agenda, and 
participants of the seminar can be coordinated via diplomatic 
channels. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan avails 
itself of this occasion to renew to the Embassy of the United States 
of America the assurances of its highest consideration. 
 
END TEXT. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) COMMENT:  While the initial reaction of some might be that 
this is part of a cynical effort to counteract the recent Associated 
Press article alleging a possible effort by "some elements" in 
Kazakhstan to smuggle 1,350 tons of yellowcake uranium to Iran, 
there is reason to look at this proposal objectively.  In 
recognition of Kazakhstan's accomplishments and nearly two decades 
of strong cooperation on non-proliferation issues (reftel), as well 
as to assist its continued efforts to combat nuclear proliferation 
and ensure the security of nuclear facilities and materials, Post 
strongly recommends support for Kazakhstan's offer.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests guidance on responding to 
Kazakhstan's proposal, including specific recommendations regarding 
timing, agenda, and suggested participants for this event.
