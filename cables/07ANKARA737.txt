¶1.  SUMMARY:  (SBU) The Turkish MFA was pleased with the kick-off 
planning meeting for the 2009 World Water Forum (WWF) conference in 
Istanbul (ref A) and the subsequent "River Basin Management" 
Conference in Antalya.  On the margins of the latter, Turkish, 
Iraqi, and Syrian ministers restarted trilateral water discussions, 
dormant since 1992.  With the announcement of approval by Austrian, 
Swiss, and German export agencies, Turkey is poised to start 
construction of the Ilisu Dam on the Tigris.  According to a Turkish 
MFA rep, Iraq and Syria did not express any opposition to Ilisu Dam. 
 The MFA rep also asked us to resubmit our proposal for the 
Turkey-Iraq water VolVis program, noting that he thought MFA could 
view it favorably, but regretting that Syria was not invited.   End 
Summary.

World Water Forum Gig 2009 in Istanbul 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Director General for Water 
and Energy Vural Altay told us March 30 that he was pleased with the 
March 19-20 World Water Forum (WWF) kick-off planning meeting in 
Istanbul (ref A).  He noted that the municipality of Istanbul, the 
State Water Administration (DSI), the World Water Council, and the 
GOT MFA would be working together to plan the 2009 WWF in Istanbul. 
He implied that the GOT had not yet given detailed thought to their 
objectives, other than to successfully host the big event aimed at 
20,000 participants.  MFA would in particular be involved with 
organizing the Ministerial conference associated with the WWF. 
Altay said that the WWF Secretary General would be Oktay Tabasaran, 
a recently retired Turkish-German academic apparently resident in 
Germany.

Turkey-Iraq-Syria Trilateral Talks on Water 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Altay also expressed satisfaction with the subsequent 
"River Basin Management" Conference held in Antalya March 22-24, 
attended by 700 participants from 70 countries.  For Turkey, the 
most remarkable result was a meeting of the ministers responsible 
for transboundary water issues from Turkey, Iraq, and Syria.  Altay 
said the three agreed to restart trilateral technical meetings on 
transboundary water in Damascus in May -- dormant since 1992 -- and 
the ministers would meet again in Damascus in June.  Altay 
reiterated that the GOT had provided information repeatedly about 
Ilisu Dam to its downstream neighbors and insisted that the Iraqis 
said they had nothing against the project, at least in the meeting, 
if perhaps not publicly.  Given the recent announcement of approval 
of export credit agency financing by Austria, Switzerland, and 
Germany, Altay said that the GOT would imminently start construction 
of the dam on the Tigris River.

Turkey-Iraq Water VolVis - Again 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Asking that we resend the revised version of the program 
for the proposed Water VolVis, Altay expected that the MFA would 
look at it favorably.  Noting that the MFA could not schedule 
participation of one of its professionals for the original two-week 
program, he opined that the ten-day core program might be 
acceptable.  We cautioned that the timing would have to be 
readdressed and we could not guarantee that the budget was still 
available for 2007, given the passage of time.  Altay also said that 
in his opinion the program would be more valuable if it included 
Syrian participants. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Environment Minister Cancels Trip to U.S. 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Altay confirmed that Environment Minister Osman Pepe had 
had to cancel his April 12-14 trip to the United States that was 
being organized by the U.S. Forest Service.  Altay referred to 
political contingencies (the upcoming Presidential election by the 
Parliament) and said he hoped that the trip could be rescheduled.
