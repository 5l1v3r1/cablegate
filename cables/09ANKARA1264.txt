SUBJECT: GOT PROTESTS GEORGIAN SEIZURE OF MERCHANT SHIPS 
 
REF: TBILISI 1587 
 
¶1. (SBU) The GOT has protested the seizure of two ships, 
which, it claims, were stopped by the Georgian Coast Guard in 
international waters in the Black Sea off the coast of 
Georgia and taken into the port of Poti (see reftel).  The 
Turkish-crewed Panamanian-flagged oil tanker "Buket," which 
was carrying fuel from Turkey, was seized August 15.  The 
Cambodian-flagged "Afro Star," also sailing under a Turkish 
crew, was seized August 19.  It was carrying cargo from 
Turkey.  According to Turkish press reports, the ships, crew 
and cargo remain under Georgian custody and Georgian 
authorities are demanding payment of a fine. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) Maritime Department Section Head Haldun Tekneci, the 
Turkish embassy in Tbilisi demarched the Georgians on the 
seizures last week.  The MFA also convoked a Georgian 
diplomat to protest the seizures and demand the immediate 
release of the ships, crew and cargo. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Tekneci, the Georgian MFA responded 
with a diplomatic note, which asserted that the seizures are 
consistent with Georgian law and Georgia's jurisdiction over 
its "maritime space" (see ref a).  Tekneci described the 
issue as at a stalemate.  He added that he found the Georgian 
reaction frustrating.  Tekneci noted that the Turkish MFA 
issues a notice to mariners cautioning Turkish vessels about 
operating  in "restricted areas" off the coast of Abkhazia. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: The seizures have received limited media 
coverage and the MFA appears intent upon quietly trying to 
gain the release of the ships, crews and cargos.
