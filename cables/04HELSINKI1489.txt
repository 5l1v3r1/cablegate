ANTI-SEMITISM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 239529 
 
Â¶1.  (U)  Embassy Helsinki addressed anti-Semitism in Finland 
in our draft 2004 Human Rights Report submitted in October. 
There has been nothing new to report in the intervening 
month.  The Department can draw upon our draft HRR for 
information for the new congressional anti-Semitism report. 
We will be pleased to clarify any examples or information if 
necessary.
