¶1.  EmbOffs have delivered the 2007 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) 
reports to the Governments of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, and the 
reports have been posted on the embassy Web site in English and 
French or Portuguese.  In the course of related discussions, Embassy 
learned that the computer equipment provided to Senegal's Judicial 
Police to set up a trafficking database in 2004 has yet to be 
populated with information about traffickers.  The database of 
talibes at the Ginddi Center, however, is being populated, and we 
are encouraging the Ministries of Interior and Family to share 
information.  We believe that persuading the police that the 
database could be used for all criminal gangs involved in smuggling 
people, narcotics ad weapons may be the most effective approach at 
this point. 
 
¶2.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) told DCM that the 
European Union (EU) has launched a new initiative with the 15 
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) member countries 
to assist with updating and implementing TIP legislation.  The EU 
has suggested that Senegal revise its TIP legislation to 
discriminate between TIP and migrant smuggling, which the April 2005 
legislation does not.  The EU is also working with Guinea-Bissau's 
National Popular Assembly to get TIP legislation enacted before 
legislative elections in March or April 2008.
