SUBJECT: AI APRIL 3 UPDATE: TWO NEW CONFIRMED CASES IN 
RAFAH; CULLING TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 1327 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) World Health Organization (WHO) Representative 
Mahmud Daher reported to EconOff April 3 that two new cases 
of Avian Influenza (AI) had been confirmed in two egglayer 
farms in Rafah.  Each farm has 2,000 egglayers.  Daher said 
the PA planned to cull the infected flock immediately.  He 
added that by day's end April 3, the total number of birds 
culled by the PA in Gaza will number 250,000. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The World Food Programme (WFP) reported April 1 
that the AI outbreak had caused an increase in the demand for 
alternative protein sources.  Given that beef is largely 
imported, high demand for fish has resulted in a serious 
depletion of available fish stocks due to over-fishing and 
the continued pollution of Gaza coastal waters.  The report 
said Gaza's inability to procure frozen fish imports from 
Israel (1,300 metric tons per year) during closures has 
amplified over-fishing.  Pesticides used on agriculture are 
not sufficiently diluted because of limited water supplies 
and run into the shallow waters along the coast, poisoning 
marine life, further limiting fish stocks.  According to WFP, 
the PA Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries cautioned that 
if the already-limited space for fishing grounds are not 
expanded and pollution reduced, the fishing industry will 
cease being viable by October 2007.  (Note: Although the 
Interim Agreement stipulated that fishing grounds would 
extend 20 miles from the Gaza coastline, the current fishing 
zone is limited to six nautical miles off-shore by the GOI. 
End Note.)
