SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) In recent days, statements and actions by the Prime 
Minister, parliamentarians, and others have pointed up the 
GOI's heightened concern over corruption -- but there is also 
recognition that the GOI has a ways to go in establishing a 
strong anti-corruption regime.   END SUMMARY. 
 
PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT: CORRUPTION AS "WHITE TERRORISM" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In a February 18 press statement, PM Nuri Al-Maliki 
stressed the GOI's determination to conduct a "war" against 
corruption, describing it as "white terrorism." He asserted 
that no mercy would be shown those stealing government funds, 
saying they were no different from terrorists in terms of the 
seriousness of their crimes against the public. 
 
MAJOR CORRUPTION SCHEME THWARTED 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.(U) A spokesman for the Council of Representatives' (COR) 
Complaints Committee told the media February 17 that the 
Committee had thwarted a major corruption scheme at the 
Municipalities and Public Works Ministry.  The spokesman said 
the scheme involved Ministry officials issuing false 
contracts valued at $126 million. He added that the COR 
Complaints Committee had acted in cooperation with the 
concerned Minister, who had established a committee composed 
of the Ministry's Inspector General and other senior 
officials to investigate the scheme. The spokesman reported 
the arrest and sacking of various officials implicated in the 
scheme. 
 
RECOVERY OF FUNDS BY MINISTRY 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry announced 
February 15 that it had recovered 1.75 billion dinars 
(approx. $1.5 million) distributed to ineligible persons 
under the anti-poverty social welfare program (Social 
Protection Network program) run by the Ministry.  According 
to the Ministry's statement, 80,000 current and retired 
Ministry employees had wrongfully obtained these funds. 
(NOTE: This program, established in 2005, has long been 
plagued by allegations of abuses by Ministry employees.  As 
reported in reftel, in December 2008 the Ministry's Inspector 
General claimed in a press statement that 70 percent of the 
funds allocated to the program were siphoned off by corrupt 
employees and others. END NOTE) A source at the Ministry 
corroborated the reported recovery of funds, but indicated 
that there were no plans to sanction those implicated in the 
wrongdoing. 
 
CALL FOR INVESTIGATION OF CORRUPTION IN PROVINCIAL COUNCILS 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The chairman of the COR's Legal Committee, in a recent 
press statement, called for the investigation of possible 
corrupt practices at the provincial level.  He stated that, 
following the January 31 Provincial Council elections, 
allegations of corruption by outgoing Council members needed 
to be examined.  The media suggested possible implication of 
provincial officials in alleged corruption schemes involving 
U.S. military officials and others currently being 
investigated by U.S. authorities in connection with 
U.S.-funded reconstruction projects in Iraq. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The recent spate of GOI statements and actions 
against corruption are welcome signs of officials' heightened 
concern over the seriousness of this problem.  However, the 
GOI also recognizes that it has far to go in establishing a 
strong anti-corruption regime and ensuring that those guilty 
of abuses are brought to account -- as evidenced by the 
failure, according to our source, to impose sanctions on 
those implicated in the siphoning off of funds from the Labor 
Qthose implicated in the siphoning off of funds from the Labor 
and Social Affaris' social welfare fund.   END COMMENT.
