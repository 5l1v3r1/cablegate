¶1. This is an action cable - see paragraphs 4, 5 and 6. 
 
¶2. The Administration and the Department view the deployment 
of 4,000 peacekeeping troops, including from Egypt, Ethiopia 
and Rwanda, to Darfur as one of its highest priorities for 
the remainder of 2008.  The Ethiopians and Egyptians were 
originally scheduled to deploy to Darfur in the first quarter 
of 2008, but to date only small advance companies have been 
deployed in order to prepare the ground for follow-on units. 
Ethiopia is ready to deploy, thanks in part to U.S. training 
and equipping, and sent an August 29, 2008 letter to the 
United Nations (UN) requesting approval to self-deploy 
personnel to Darfur.  The United States supports this effort; 
however, troops cannot deploy to Darfur until their 
contingent-owned equipment (COE) has arrived in theater.  The 
UN will engage with Ethiopia to deploy its personnel once 
their COE has arrived at its final destination.  Egypt says 
it is ready to deploy but is blaming UN regulations for its 
inability to self-deploy, a claim we continue to pursue with 
the Egyptian Government (NOTE: The UN has received nothing in 
writing from Egypt asking to self-deploy). 
 
¶3. According to UNAMID deployment projections, Indonesia, 
Pakistan, and Bangladesh are all scheduled to deploy elements 
to UNAMID in autumn/ winter 2008.  In the interest of meeting 
or exceeding our 4,000-troop goal by the end of December, we 
are seeking the Indonesian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi 
governments to reconfirm their pledges to UNAMID and give an 
update on the status of these projected contributions. 
 
¶4. ACTION JAKARTA:  Indonesia is scheduled to deploy a 
140-person Formed Police Unit (FPU) to North Darfur in 
October.  At the highest level possible, Post is requested to 
contact high-level host government counterparts to assess the 
readiness of the host government to make good on this pledge 
to UNAMID.  Post should urge counterparts to press forward 
with key steps in the deployment process.  Post is also 
requested to urge government officials to seriously consider 
self-deployment of police and equipment and to ascertain any 
additional impediments to deployment (NOTE: The USG is not 
prepared to offer specific assistance to host governments for 
deployment of its forces, but Post is encouraged to consider 
ways in which the USG might help resolve any obstacles to 
such deployment). 
 
¶5. ACTION DHAKA:  Bangladesh is scheduled to deploy a 
327-person multi-role logistic unit to South Darfur in 
October.  Post is requested to contact host government 
counterparts to assess the readiness of the host government 
to make good on this pledge to UNAMID.  Post should urge 
counterparts to press forward with key steps in the 
deployment process.  Post is also requested to urge 
government officials to consider self-deployment of troops 
and equipment and to ascertain any additional impediments to 
deployment (NOTE: The USG is not prepared to offer specific 
assistance to host governments for deployment of its forces, 
but Post is encouraged to consider ways in which the USG 
might help resolve any obstacles to such deployment). 
 
¶6. ACTION ISLAMABAD:  Pakistan is scheduled to contribute a 
329-person engineer company to West Darfur and a 156-person 
Level III hospital to South Darfur, which requires airlift of 
COE in December.  Post is requested to contact appropriate 
host government officials to assess the readiness of the host 
government to make good on this pledge to UNAMID.  Post 
should urge counterparts to press forward with key steps in 
the deployment process.  Post is also requested to urge 
government officials to seriously consider self-deployment of 
troops and equipment and to ascertain any additional 
impediments to deployment (NOTE: The USG is not prepared to 
offer specific assistance to host governments for deployment 
of its forces, but Post is encouraged to consider ways in 
which the USG might help resolve any obstacles to such 
deployment). 
 
¶7. Please submit responses to demarche request by Tuesday, 
October 14, 2008.  For further information on this cable, 
please contact AF/SPG Josh Drake, 202-647-2348 or AF/SPG
