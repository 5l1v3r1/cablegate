FIRE SAFETY TRAINING 
 
REF: (A) BASRAH 0031 
 
¶1.      Summary.  On March 23, the Regional Embassy Office (REO) 
in Basrah hosted 25 children from a local orphanage for a visit 
to the REO Fire Station.  The children learned about fire safety 
and prevention while also watching a demonstration on the use of 
fire extinguishers.  Local and international media covered the 
event.  The visit ended with each child receiving a certificate 
and a bag of candy.  The smiles and good will generated by the 
visit has encouraged the REO to plan similar public outreach 
events with local schools and orphanages. End summary. 
 
 
¶2.      The Deputy Regional Coordinator (DRC) organized a day of 
fire safety and prevention for local orphans with the help of 
Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) employees of the REO Fire Station. 
The purpose of the event was to not only open the doors of the 
REO to a small part of the local community, but to teach Iraqi 
children the basic skills of fire safety and prevention. 
ORFACT, a private local orphanage, was invited to send a group 
of 25 children to the REO for a morning of training and fun. 
The children were between the ages of 5 and 14 and included 11 
boys and 14 girls.  ORFACT was founded by Basrah Provincial 
Council member Dr. Wathib Al Amood in 2003 and currently cares 
for 60 children. 
 
¶3.      The KBR Fire Chief organized a tour of the Fire Station 
and fire fighting equipment including the fire trucks.  The 
children learned how to "Stop, Drop and Roll" during a fire and 
how to use a fire extinguisher.  They also saw a demonstration 
of the main water hose of the fire truck and were encouraged to 
try on various pieces of fire fighting gear.  Interestingly 
enough, the girls in the group were more eager and outgoing than 
the boys.  The morning ended with a "graduation ceremony" in the 
Fire Station where each child received a Basrah Fire Department 
Certificate of Training.  In addition, the KBR dining facility 
donated 30 bags of candy and ice cream bars. 
 
¶4.      Comment:  The event generated tremendous good will between 
the REO and local community. Two local TV stations, two 
newspapers, one radio and one international media correspondent 
were present to film and record the event.  One of the local 
teachers that accompanied the children exclaimed that she had 
never seen the children so excited and happy. In fact, the 
children had learned a song in English that they presented when 
they arrived.  When they left, they did so with smiles and high 
fives.  End Comment.
