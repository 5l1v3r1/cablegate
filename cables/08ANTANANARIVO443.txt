SUBJECT: COMORAN PRESIDENT VISITS IRAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On June 14, Union of the Comoros President Ahmed 
Abdallah Sambi and a high-ranking political and economic Comoran 
delegation arrived in Tehran for a three-day visit that included 
meetings with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Supreme Leader 
Ayatollah Khamenei, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki and a visit 
to the holy city of Mashhad. Iranian and Comoran officials 
reportedly signed two letters of understanding and one agreement on 
Tehran's assistance to Moroni in different development projects. 
Comoran Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaffar conveyed to Embassy 
Antananarivo that the Comoros continues to support the USG position 
on Iran's nuclear program and that President Sambi's visit had 
nothing to do with this issue. END SUMMARY. 
 
STRENGTHENING COMOROS-IRAN BILATERAL TIES

¶2. (U) President Sambi's meeting with Iranian President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad was preceded by an official welcome ceremony where the 
two countries' national anthems were played and the two presidents 
reviewed the guard of honor. Subsequently, they met privately to 
discuss strengthened bilateral ties in all fields. Sambi reportedly 
requested Iran's experience for his country's development and 
progress. Media reports quote Ahmadinejad as saying, "The Islamic 
Republic of Iran sets no limits to the transfer of its experiences 
or workforce to Comoros," whether in the political, economic, 
agricultural or educational fields. Iranian and Comoran officials 
reportedly signed two letters of understanding and one agreement on 
Tehran's assistance to Moroni in different development projects. 
Speaking to reporters, President Sambi referred to his visit to Iran 
as "positive" and "successful." 
 
RECEIVES WARNING MUSLIMS MUST UNITE DESPITE THE "ENEMY"

¶3. (U) According to media reports, in a meeting on June 16, Supreme 
Leader Khamenei told President Sambi that Muslims should put aside 
their geographical, racial and religious difference and take 
practical measures to secure a permanent seat at the UN council. 
Khamenei called on Islamic countries to forge unity against the 
"enemies" and take "practical" steps for realizing their wishes. He 
said, "Islamic Ummah is in dire need of unity; unity and cooperation 
among world Muslims will bring them more strength ... However, 
imperial powers are apposed to such an achievement in the world of 
Islam." Referring to Iran's nuclear developments, Khamenei said, 
"The enemies of Islam are well aware that Iran's nuclear program is 
peaceful, however, they spare no efforts to halt the program, for 
they consider the Iranian nation's move an upward step." He also 
said, "The enemies have employed all means to sow the seed of 
discord among Muslims by creating disputes between Shiites and 
Sunnis ... Unfortunately, some of the politicians, intellectuals and 
Ulema in Islamic countries have been caught in the trap." In 
return, President Sambi reportedly expressed satisfaction with the 
meeting and called for expansion of bilateral relations. Sambi 
again urged the need for his country to benefit from the invaluable 
experiences of Iranian experts for its development, saying, "Comoros 
needs the views of Iranian experts to implement developmental 
projects." 
 
COMOROS STILL BACKS USG ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR ISSUES

¶4. (SBU) Embassy Antananarivo contacted the Government of the Union 
of the Comoros several times to receive clarification on President 
Sambi's visit. Through staff contacts, Comoran Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Jaffar conveyed to the Embassy that the Comoran Government 
does not support Iran's nuclear program, asserting that President 
Sambi's visit to Iran had nothing to do with this issue. Jaffar 
emphasized that the Comoran government will always support its key 
partners such as the U.S. and the League of Arab States, who are 
resolutely against Iran's nuclear program. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: While Sambi's visit to Tehran certainly raises a 
red flag, Post notes that President Sambi seemed to be using the 
same talking points he regularly uses with the United States and all 
major partners -- a request for greater economic and development 
assistance to pull his country out of desperate poverty. Throughout 
his discussions with Post over the last several years, President 
Sambi and his government have repeatedly emphasized that they seek 
expanded partnership and development assistance from partners around 
the world, including the Middle East, but with "no strings 
attached." That said, it appears likely that Iran will expect - at 
a minimum - Comoran support for its positions in international fora. 
Sambi's ability to maintain a degree of independence may well 
depend on what alternative sources of development assistance are 
available to him. END COMMENT.
