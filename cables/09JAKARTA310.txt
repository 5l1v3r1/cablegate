SUBJECT: Opportunity for President Obama to Address World Islamic 
Economic Forum 
 
REF: A) Jakarta 136; B) Jakarta 54 
 
¶1. (SBU) Conference organizers for the 5th World Islamic Economic 
Forum held in Jakarta on March 2-3 have requested that President 
Obama deliver taped video remarks during the Forum's opening 
ceremony.  The Forum's key themes are the global financial crisis, 
alternative energy, and food security.  Indonesian President 
Yudhoyono will deliver opening remarks and be joined by other Muslim 
and non-Muslim economic and political leaders, including Malaysian 
Prime Minister Badawi, during the Forum. 
 
¶2. (SBU) No formal invitation has been sent yet, but conference 
organizers have reiterated their interest in having President Obama 
speak via taped video remarks (ref A).  A senior advisor to Forum 
co-chairman, State-Owned Enteprises Minister Sofyan Djalil, told us 
on February 23 that Minister Djalil would be willing to send a 
letter of invitation as co-chairman to President Obama. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A request from President Yudhoyono to President Obama to 
speak to this group is unlikely.  Tri Sukma "Nanu" Djandam, an 
advisor to the President on international affairs, told us on 
February 23 that President Yudhoyono does not want to press 
President Obama to address the World Islamic Economic Forum.   Nanu 
said the President decided not to co-sign the letter as he was very 
pleased with Secretary Clinton's visit and had reiterated his 
invitation for President Obama to visit in November.  Given this, 
Yudhoyono did not want to press President Obama with another 
invitation at this point.  This information contradicts discussions 
with Presidential advisor Dino Djalal in early January (ref B). 
 
¶4. (SBU) If President Obama would like to speak to the Forum by 
video tape, Embassy Jakarta will work with the conference organizers 
to make appropriate arrangements. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Forum background: The World Islamic Economic Forum is an 
outgrowth of economic meetings at the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference.  Designed as a "mini" Davos, the Forum brings together 
Muslim and non-Muslim political and business leaders to discuss 
critical economic issues and showcase investment opportunities in 
the Muslim world.  Malaysian Prime Minister Badawi (a founding 
member of the Forum), the Crown Prince of the UAE, and the Deputy 
Prime Minister of Qatar are confirmed participants.  Islamic 
Development Bank President, Qatar Islamic Bank Chairman, HSBC Amanah 
CEO, and other business leaders are also slated to attend. 
Caterpillar and Coca Cola are both sponsors and are sending 
representatives.  The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council is also soliciting 
further participation by its members.
