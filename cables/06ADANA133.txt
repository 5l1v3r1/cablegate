SUBJECT: TURKEY: SATURDAY BOMBING IN MERSIN 
 
¶1. (U) One police officer and twelve civilians were wounded by a 
bomb which exploded at 11:40 am on Saturday, June 3, 2006, in 
downtown Mersin.  The bomb reportedly was planted in a black 
plastic bag.  Some press accounts attribute the detonation to a 
remote control device.  No American citizens were injured.  The 
bomb was placed in front of a tobacco kiosk on Ataturk Street 
which is in a busy shopping district.  Mersin has increased 
numbers of foreign tourists, especially western Europeans, 
during the summer season. 
 
¶2. (U) This is the second bomb in less than a week in Mersin. 
On Monday, May 29, 2006, at 10:30 am a small percussion-like 
bomb, which was placed in a trash barrel, exploded on Silifke 
Street near the fish market.  There were no injuries. 
 
¶3. (U) The Kurdistan Ozgurluk Sahinleri (also known by their 
Kurdish name, Teyrebazen Azadiya Kurdistan - TAK) Freedom Hawks 
of Kurdistan, have claimed responsibility for the June 3 
incident, and police tell us that they suspect the same 
organization of perpetrating the May 29, 2006 incident.
