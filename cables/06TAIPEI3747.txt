¶2.  AIT Econoffs delivered reftel talking points on U.S. 
priorities for APEC to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department 
of International Organizations Chief WANG Liang-Yu on 
November 1.  Ms. Wang stated that Chinese Taipei generally 
agreed with U.S. priorities, and will support US language for 
Statement on APEC WMD Trafficking and WMD Financing. 
 
¶3.  In addition, Ms. Wang took the opportunity to advise that 
Chinese Taipei was generally opposed to holding informal 
ministers meetings, and did not support holding a ministers 
meeting to discuss North Korea.  If an APEC meeting is held 
to discuss North Korea, it Chinese Taipei's position that the 
meeting should be open to all APEC members.  AIT notes that 
Chinese Taipei has imposed trade and financial sanctions on 
North Korea (ref B). 
 
¶4.  Ms. Wang also asked for the U.S. reaction to the recent 
South Korean nomination for the Chair of the 
Counter-Terrorism Task Force.  AIT requests guidance from 
Washington agencies on how to respond to Chinese Taipei.
