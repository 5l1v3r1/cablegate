Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Under pressure from Movimiento por Nicaragua 
(MpN) and other civil society groups (reftel), Nicaragua's 
National Assembly voted on August 4 to extend the deadline 
for soliciting the national voter/ID card from August 6 to 
August 21.  The media reported and CSE officials confirmed an 
immediate drop in applications on August 5 and 6 after 
potential voters learned they had two more weeks to 
procrastinate.  CSE official Rodrigo Barreto informed Emboffs 
that the CSE does not plan to postpone release of the 
official voters list (padron) or make other modifications to 
the Electoral Calendar based on the deadline change; however, 
he did claim that the CSE faces a budget crisis because the 
Assembly did not approve additional funds.  NDI and Etica y 
Transparencia (EyT) officials later reported that only about 
20 percent of cedula applicants are receiving their document 
in a timely manner, delays which threaten the ability of 
thousands to vote in the November 5 elections.  End Summary. 
 
ASSEMBLY VOTES TO EXTEND APPLICATION DEADLINE, BUT NOT ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR CSE

¶2. (C) During a special plenary session on August 4, the 
National Assembly approved a proposal by President Bolanos 
that extends the cedula application deadline from August 6 to 
August 21.  The Assembly was pressured on the cedula issue by 
the Presidency, MpN, and other civil society groups concerned 
that large numbers of eligible voters, especially young 
voters, had not yet filed applications (reftel).  The long 
lines of applicants evident the previous week dissipated in 
most areas of the country as Nicaraguans took advantage of 
the reprieve to procrastinate. 
 
¶3. (C) Emboffs met with senior CSE official Rodrigo Barreto 
on August 7 to ask about the implications of the deadline 
postponement for the Electoral Calendar.  Barreto claimed 
that the CSE has no plans to push back any of the dates that 
depend on the cedula application deadline (such as the 
release of the updated padron), but will instead work harder 
to make up for the delay.  He stated, however, that because 
the Assembly failed to approve additional funds, and the CSE 
will have to pay an extra 12-15 million cordobas 
($686,000-$857,000) to contract employees working on cedula 
applications, the Council will not have funds to pay salaries 
in October and November.  Barreto also confided that the 
pressure to issue cedulas has caused some CSE employees to 
approve applications without fully vetting applicants with 
the civil registry, padron, and police records, which has 
weakened safeguards against fraud. 
 
NDI: CSE FAILS TO ISSUE CEDULAS EFFICIENTLY

¶4. (C) NDI and EyT officials met with Ambassador and emboffs 
on August 7 to present a report on cedula issuance and 
distribution.  The report, based on a sample of 500-600 
cases, revealed that only about 20 percent of cedula 
applicants receive a cedula within 90 days (the CSE's 
self-designated waiting period) of filing their paperwork, 
though this figure rises to 30 percent for "persistent" 
applicants.  The study also indicated that 43 percent of 
applicants that enjoyed some sort of assistance from a 
political party were able to obtain a cedula within that time 
period (although NDI officials cautioned that this figure is 
based upon a very small sample).  On the positive side, 
researchers confirmed that valid applicants are almost always 
immediately entered into the padron. 
 
¶5. (C) NDI officials noted that some local electoral 
authorities are more efficient at issuing cedulas within the 
90-day time period than others: from over 60 percent in some 
Departments to zero percent in others.  NDI will focus on 
these good and bad performers and work with IFES to identify 
"road blocks" in the cedulation process.  EyT director 
Roberto Courtney commented that even the "efficient" 
authorities will likely not be able to produce and deliver 
sufficient voting documents before the elections, so the CSE 
may have to consider other alternatives, such as allowing 
citizens to vote with a colilla (cedula application receipt). 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: NDI officials requested Embassy's advise on how to present findings and recommendations to the CSE. Ambassador cautioned that the CSE is reeling from a constant barrage of criticism over the cedula process and very defensive. Hence, the report should lead with positive findings, such as the efficient padron updates and examples of local authorities who are processing applications efficiently, and focus on constructive recommendations.
