Condemnation of "Referendum" on UN Membership 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the opening of the June 13 regular TAO press briefing, 
spokesman Yang Yi expressed the Mainland's strong opposition 
to Chen Shui-bian's "referendum" on joining the UN under the 
name "Taiwan," calling the move a serious step toward "de 
jure independence," which seeks to deceive the Taiwan masses 
and obtain fraudulent votes in order to realize this attempt 
at separatism.  Chen's aim is to provoke a cross-Strait 
conflict, which could endanger the peace and stability of the 
Asia-Pacific region.  Yang expressed the TAO's grave concern 
and intention to never allow "Taiwan separatist" forces to 
split Taiwan from China under any name or by any means. 
 
¶3.  Yang also bashed the "Second Republic Constitution" and 
"one country on each side" proposals as part of Chen 
Shui-bian's "conspiracies" to separate Taiwan from China, 
when asked for comment on Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) 
Chairman Chen Ming-tong's reported wish to seek the TAO's 
opinions on his draft "Second Republic Constitution".  Asked 
for comment on today's media reports that Chen Ming-tong 
visited the Mainland in 2005 as a "scholar" to hold 
discussions with high-level government members, Yang said he 
did not know anything about the matter. 
 
Olympic Torch: "Third Party Location" Arrangement? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4.  The spokesman had not heard of a so-called "Third Party 
Location" arrangement mentioned by a reporter as a 
consideration for the Olympic torch route, but emphasized 
that Beijing released a route in strict accordance with the 
Olympic Charter and the rules of the International Olympic 
Committee.  Yang expressed the Mainland's hopes to exclude 
political interference in the matter and implement the 
consensus already reached by the two sides. 
 
Opportunity for Fresh Cross-Strait Consultations? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5.  Yang reiterated that the Mainland welcomes any individual 
who recognizes the "1992 consensus" and the "one-China 
principle" to visit the Mainland, regardless of party or 
government affiliations or previous behavior, when asked 
about Mainland scholar Huang Jiashu's assertion that a new 
opportunity for cross-Strait negotiations could arise if the 
DPP recognized Taiwanese people were Chinese. 
 
Cross-Strait Fugitives 
---------------------- 
 
¶6.  Yang said he knew nothing about the murder case of Taipei 
County Councilor Wu Shan-jeou, after a reporter asked about 
cross-Strait cooperation in arresting a suspect in Guangzhou. 
 The spokesman completely ignored the second question---which 
was also omitted from the Chinese on-line transcript---on the 
case of a Taiwan fugitive living on the Mainland named Wang 
Yongqing, who the reporter claimed recently held a public 
book-signing event.  The reporter also noted that TAO 
Director Chen Yunlin had written a prologue to Wang's book. 
 
Ma Ying-jeou Promotes Cross-Strait Transportation 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶7.  The TAO hopes for direct cross-Strait links to be 
established as soon as possible, when asked about Taiwan 
media reports that Ma Ying-jeou will make the issue a 
priority if elected in 2008. 
 
TAO Encourages Taiwan Enterprises on the Mainland 
--------------------------------------------- ----

¶8.  Asked about Taiwan media reports that the Mainland is 
requiring Taiwan subsidiary companies to sever ties with its 
parent companies in Taiwan, Yang stated that the Mainland 
promotes the expansion of financial channels for Taiwan 
enterprises and encourages them to enter the Mainland market 
under the appropriate conditions.  Yang noted there are 
already seven Taiwan enterprises in the Mainland's "A stock 
market," and that there is no special policy toward those 
enterprises currently going through the approval process.
