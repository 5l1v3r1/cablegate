REF: A. SECSTATE 51536 
     ¶B. ATHENS 611 
 
¶1. (U) Ref B discussed post's actions regarding promotion of 
May 21 as the "Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People."  In 
addition, Ambassador has placed an editorial on Cuba and the 
Day of Solidarity in the daily free-press Metro newspaper, 
which everyday reaches a quarter of a million average Greeks, 
including a large number of young people.  Post is posting 
the editorial on its Embassy website.  Post has also provided 
a prominent link on its website to www.solidaridadcuba.org. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As discussed in ref B, post's options for promoting 
solidarity with the Cuban people are limited.  We will, 
nevertheless, continue to look for opportunities, both with 
the GOG and with the Greek public, to heighten awareness of 
the situation in Cuba.
