¶1.  (SBU)  Post delivered reftel points April 24 per an 
exchange of cables reported separately. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The French MFA reported the following exchange at 
its April 25 press briefing between reporters and its 
spokesperson, Pascale Andreani (the English translation comes 
from the French MFA's website): 
 
Begin text: 
 
Andreani:  We were in contact yesterday with the Americans at 
their initiative, and we exchanged analyses and intelligence. 
 
It is essential for Syria to give a full accounting of its 
past and present nuclear activities in accordance with its 
international obligations, particularly with respect to the 
IAEA.  The secret construction of a nuclear reactor would be 
a serious violation of Syria's non-proliferation obligations. 
 
We also remain very concerned about North Korea's 
proliferation activities.  UN Security Council resolution 
1718 prohibits any export of sensitive goods from North Korea. 
 
We hope that North Korea, as it pledged at the Six-party 
discussions, makes a complete and verifiable declaration of 
all its nuclear programs, including its external 
proliferation activities. 
 
Q:  About Syria's nuclear activities.  You have to prove that 
these are military nuclear activities because civilian 
activities are permitted. 
 
A:  That's what we're talking about.  We have doubts with 
respect to some of Syria's activities, and we're asking Syria 
to act in accordance with its international obligations, 
particularly with respect to the IAEA.
