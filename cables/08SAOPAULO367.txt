Lost opportunities during G-8 and G-5 meeting 
 
Editorial in business-centered Valor Econtmico (7/10) says: "The 
meeting in Japan of the leaders of the world's largest economies was 
a wasted opportunity to open room for joint actions to fight the 
world's main short-term problems: rise in oil prices, rise in food 
prices and reduction of carbon emissions.... Even if still 
pessimistic, the G-8's position on fighting global warming has 
advanced. The U.S. accepted the goal of lowering emissions of 
CO2-50% by 2050.... Developing countries, however, walked in with a 
pre-set package that holds rich countries accountable for the 
problem and did not accept any goal for themselves.... The fight 
against global warming will not be effective without the 
participation of the world's largest polluter until yesterday, the 
U.S. But it will also not advance without the commitment of today's 
main polluters, such as China and India remained unbending in the 
meetings."
