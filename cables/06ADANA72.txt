¶1. (SBU) Civil unrest in Turkey's southeast (reftels) has 
subsided, though problems continue throughout the region. 
While no new deaths were reported on April 4, security forces 
continue to detain and arrest protestors, and tensions remain 
high in many southeast towns that have been affected over the 
past few days by violent civil unrest.  . 
 
¶2. (SBU) A contact in Diyarbakir told us that the situation 
there has mostly returned to normal, with all shops and schools 
open.  A large police presence remains throughout the city, 
especially in front of banks and police stations.  The director 
of GUN TV, which launched limited Kurdish broadcasting on March 
x, told us that their broadcasting continued unhindered 
throughout the unrest in Diyarbakir.  He emphasized that people 
were still tense and were expecting a democratic solution to the 
problems of Kurds, since the violence had not been productive 
for either side. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Our contact in Kiziltepe told us that the situation 
there remains very tense, with large numbers of police and 
jandarma deployed throughout the city.  All schools and shops in 
the city were closed on April 3, and most shops remained closed 
on April 4.  Many families have elected to not send their 
children to school, according to our contact. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The mayor of Viranshehir, a small town about half way 
between Mardin and Sanliurfa, told us that on April 3 he had 
been fired upon by village guards while he was talking to a 
crowd in an attempt to disperse them.  He said that a group of 
five thousand marched peacefully on April 3.  Schools and some 
businesses were closed.  He described the situation as calm and 
normal on April 4. 
 
¶5. (U) The press reported that a large crowd in Sanliurfa threw 
stones at, and attempted to set on fire, a PTT (Post, Telephone 
and Telegraph) branch building.  The crowd dispersed when 
security forces intervened. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The media reported that a large crowd set up 
barricades, burned tires and chanted pro-PKK slogans on April 3 
in various locations throughout Adana.  The crowd dispersed when 
police intervened.  The Chief of the Riot-Police in Adana told 
us on April 4 that clashes between protestors and police have 
occurred every night in parts of Adana over the past few days. 
 
¶7. (U) The Batman Director of the Democratic Society Party (DTP) 
was arrested on April 3 for inciting violence, according to the 
press.
