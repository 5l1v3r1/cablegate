¶1. (U) SUMMARY: From October 21-29, the number of confirmed 
H1N1 infections in Germany rose by 3,075 to a total of 29,907 
cases. Four more H1N1 deaths have been reported for a total of 
6 deaths in Germany.  In an October 26 meeting, the Vice 
President of the Robert Koch Institute stated that we are at 
the beginning of a second wave of infection, which will 
continue as the flu season progresses.  Following an October 
28 Pandemic Influenza Working Group meeting, Mission Germany 
remains at tripwire two, which indicates clusters of infection 
with only localized human-to-human transmission.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) On November 2, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute confirmed a total of 
3,075 new (laboratory and non-laboratory) H1N1 cases in 
Germany over the period October 21-29, increasing the total 
number of H1N1 cases to 29,907.  Bavaria (bordering the Czech 
Republic and Austria) is now the German state with the highest 
number of confirmed virus cases with a total of 7,477, 
followed by Nordrhein-Westfalen (6,991) and Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(4,192). 
 
 
Four Deaths Reported 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Four additional H1N1 deaths have been reported since 
October 23.  A 65-year old man from Mannheim (Baden- 
Wuerttemberg) died on October 23.  He was considered to be a 
"risk patient" and had multiple underlying health conditions. 
Three deaths occurred on October 30.  A five year old boy 
suffering from pneumonia died in Neuenkirchen (Saarland).  A 
16-year old severely-disabled patient died in Augsburg 
(Bavaria).  A 48-year old woman with asthma and liver disease 
died in Bonn (Nordrhein-Westfalen).  This brings the total 
number of H1N1 deaths in Germany to six. 
 
 
RKI VP Predicts Start of Second Wave of Infection 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. (U) In an October 26 meeting, the Vice President of the 
Robert Koch Institute told us that he expects a rapid increase 
in H1N1 infections as the flu season continues through 
January.  He attributed Germany's remarkably few H1N1 deaths 
to its aggressive program of early detection, treatment and 
isolation of patients.  He was also clearly frustrated about 
the local controversy over the decision to use different H1N1 
vaccines for certain German government officials/the German 
military and the German public, blaming an incompetent 
procurement strategy and a bad communication plan for this 
needless distraction.  He stressed that the local vaccine is 
safe. 
 
 
Pandemic Influenza Working Group Meeting 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) A core group of Mission Germany's Pandemic Influenza 
Working Group (PIWG) met on October 28 to review the current 
H1N1 situation in Germany.  Mission Germany remains at 
tripwire two, which indicates clusters of infection with only 
localized human-to-human transmission.  All sections continue 
to implement the Department's recommended preparations for a 
potential increase in cases this fall.  The Health Unit hopes 
to receive H1N1 vaccine from Washington in late November or 
December.    The Consular Section has printed and is posting 
signs in German and English to encourage sick customers to 
stay home.  These same signs will be soon be posted at all 
visitor entrances adjacent to local guard screening areas. 
The Management Section confirmed that additional FOBs are 
available.  These would allow more Mission Staff to work from 
home if infections increase as predicted, but will only be 
distributed with clearance from the EAC.
