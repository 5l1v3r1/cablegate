REF: SECSTATE 165106 
 
¶1.    (U)  The following is in response to a potential 
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) program to 
support loans to Microfinancing Institutions (MFI) and, in 
particular, the Bolivian MFI, Fundacion Boliviana para el 
Desarrollo de la Mujer (FUNBODEM).  FUNDOBEM is part of the 
Women's World Banking (WWB) network and OPIC's proposal to 
help support the NGO has the Mission's approval. 
 
¶2.  (U)  As of December 2006, FUNDOBEM had reached almost 
5,000 borrowers, mostly women in the city of Santa Cruz and 
the surrounding area.  The institution's financial profile 
looks strong; however, since it is a non-regulated 
microfinance NGO, external funding is always needed because 
they cannot raise deposits directly from the public.  The 
current GOB initiative to regulate credit unions will not 
affect FUNBODEM, so although there are vague GOB plans to 
strengthen regulation of NGOs, FUNBODEM will probably not be 
affected in the near future.  In sum, external financing will 
continue to be needed in the medium term to extend outreach. 
 
¶3.  (U)  USAID/Bolivia has not worked directly with FUNBODEM 
recently, but is in frequent contact with the microfinance 
NGO association FINRURAL and there appears to be no reason to 
object to this proposal.  FUNDOBEM has no know ties to 
terrorism, money laundering, corruption, or legal violations. 
 Post appreciates OPIC's initiative in support of Bolivia's 
microfinance sector. 
 
Minimize considered.
