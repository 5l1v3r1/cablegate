REF: SECSTATE 29448 
 
¶1.  (U)  ESTHOFF passed reftel points March 9 to several 
senior officials at Spain's Agency for International 
Cooperation (AECI), encouraging senior level attendance at 
the March 16 ICI meeting in New York.  POLOFF passed same 
request to MFA's Iraq office.  Both ESTHOFF and POLOFF 
encouraged their interlocutors to develop a robust assistance 
package for Iraq. 
 
¶2.  (U)  AECI informed ESTHOFF March 13 that AECI Director 
General (A/S equivalent) for Africa, Asia, and East Europe 
Ricardo Martinez would lead the Spanish delegation to the 
March 16 meeting. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Martinez is the key AECI official on 
Iraq assistance issues.  His attendance means that the 
Spanish are taking the ICI process seriously and suggests 
that Spain plans to channel significant amounts of assistance 
via the ICI process.
