REF: KUWAIT 90 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (U) on February 3, three weeks after the Minister of 
Health approached Ambassador for assistance in sending relief 
supplies to Haiti, final clearances were received permitting 
space-available transportation of 300 Kuwait Red Crescent 
Society-donated tents for Haiti onboard a 747 cargo plane 
returning to the U.S.  The plane departed Kuwait with US 
military cargo and six pallets of tents, en-route to Dover 
Air Force Base.  Econoff was told that tents would be 
off-loaded at Dover, trucked to Charleston South Carolina Air 
Force Base, hub for Haiti relief operations, and then 
transported to Haiti. 
 
¶3.  (U) The 300 tents,  valued by KRCS at USD 47,000, account 
for only a portion of the original USD 330,000 in in-kind 
assistance the KRCS had earmarked for Haiti (this amount on 
top of the USD 1 million in cash already donated).  On 
February 3, the KRCS retrieved from the military side of KCIA 
the remaining supplies for which USG transport was denied, 
including 30 tons of UK manufactured medical supplies, 8 tons 
of blankets, and 50 tons of family food parcels.  According 
to KRCS officials, they will likely route these supplies to 
Yemen. 
 
¶4.  (U) Action Request:  According to Yousef Al Merag, 
Director of Disaster Management at KRCS, his organization has 
a substantial number of additional tents and would be happy 
to contribute them to Haiti relief if further U.S. airlift 
could be identified.  Please advise as to how we may respond 
to this inquiry.  End Action request.
