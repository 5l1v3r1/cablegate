  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"It is hard for the U.S. Congress to change its view on China" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (10/19)(pg 4): "On 
October 16, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China issued a 
'Human Rights Report on China.'  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs believes that the report is full of ignorance and prejudice. 
 The Commission should stop issuing reports that distort the facts 
and interfere in China's internal affairs.  Experts note the irony 
that the report's data are not from the Chinese government or the 
UN, but rather come from a variety of channels that are not 
authoritative.  Zhang Liping, Director of the Office of U.S. Studies 
at the China Academy of Social Sciences, said that the reason that 
the Commission issues such a report every year is to try to maintain 
its influence over China and to prevent the White House from gaining 
a monopoly on diplomatic initiatives with China.  However, the 
report's influence is limited.  Since Obama currently needs 
cooperation from China, he will not easily swing the human rights 
stick at China like his processors did." 
 
¶2.  'POISONOUS DRYWALL' 
 
"The U.S. wants compensation from China for 'poisonous walls'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/19)(pg 11): "Zhou Shijian at the China 
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) said that 
the U.S. needs to issue an authoritative report [on the toxic 
drywall issue] that is recognized by both the U.S. and China. 
Chinese products exported to the U.S. have to go through three 
checks: Chinese quality control, the Chinese Exports Inspection 
Department, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  If the walls 
are really poisonous, then both the U.S. and China are responsible. 
The U.S. should not blame China.  According to an American 
consulting company, the toxic drywall issue will cause $1.5 
billion-$2.5 billion in economic losses.  Zhou argued that any 
compensation should be based on an authoritative report.  However, 
due to the complexity of the technology involved and insufficient 
resources, it is still unclear when such a drywall report can be 
issued." 
 
¶3.  SOUTH AND CENTRAL ASIA COOPERATION 
 
"Central and South Asia are increasing interactions" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) 
(10/19)(pg 3): "There are three reasons that the level of 
interaction between Central and South Asia is increasing.  First, 
the situation in Afghanistan is a common concern for both regions. 
Both Central Asia and South Asia are willing to create a better 
environment for peace and stability in Afghanistan.  Second, both 
regions can further their geopolitical interests through 
cooperation.  India and Pakistan both want to expand their influence 
in the region and are also eager for [access to] the region's 
plentiful oil and mineral resources.  Through South Asia, Central 
Asia can open a door to the outside world and decrease its 
dependence on Russia.  Third, the U.S. is also working behind the 
scenes, pushing for collaboration between the two regions in order 
to advance its own interests.  The new U.S. strategy on Afghanistan 
and Pakistan involves seeking a 'radical resolution' to the 
Afghanistan issue.  The U.S. is happy to see 'resource cooperation' 
between India and Pakistan and Central Asia.  Therefore, it is 
undeniable that cooperation between the two regions will have 
far-reaching influence on European and Asian geopolitics."
