¶1. We delivered ref A text of proposed assurances to the 
North America desk of the Indonesian Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DEPLU) on October 3.  We asked for confirmation that 
the GOI in fact wanted the spare parts in question.  We also 
advised that the GOI consider offering blanket assurances 
based on the same text to facilitate future transfers.  We 
noted that much of the text of the assurances was similar to 
language in the recently enacted Section 505 Agreement (ref 
B), a fact which might speed the GOI clearance process. 
 
¶2. DEPLU officials said they would discuss the request with 
relevant agencies and reply to our questions.
