"The speech and the practice" 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (6-10) by Jihad Hassan Hammade, 
president of the National Union of Islamic Entities and 
vice-president of Wamy LatinAmerica, states: "....Barack Obama's 
speech.... generated euphoria in the Middle East, but with a certain 
dose of distrust.....nonetheless, speeches like this need, above 
all, concrete actions as the Islamic world doesn't believe in 
promises that are not accompanied by attitudes that confirm 
them....Today, the Islamic community in Brazil [which he says is 
composed by around 1.5 million people], is optimistic with [Obama's] 
speech and expects that the promises made are true ones.....The 
'islamophobia' must be eliminated from the society and from the 
media......Brazil is seen with good eyes by Islamic and Arab 
countries, because internally there is a pluralist society and a 
reasonable mutual respect as regards to religious diversity."
