¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  In a September 11 courtesy call Quito Mayor Paco 
Moncayo avoided controversial political issues and focused on a 
review of ongoing municipal projects.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mayor Moncayo warmly welcomed the Ambassador and commented 
on his good relations with the Embassy over the years.  He focused 
his comments largely on explaining municipal responsibilities, 
including water, park and airport management (noting that the city 
does not maintain a police force and that the central government is 
responsible for security).  He mentioned that Quito has two 
sister-cities in the United States, Louisville and Atlanta, and 
talked a bit about how Quito was chosen as a world heritage site by 
UNESCO.  Moncayo expressed firm support for technical exchanges of 
expertise between sister cities and distaste for charity 
relationships.  He also thanked Ambassador for the recent expansion 
of $20,000 worth of English language scholarships for local students 
and USAID assistance in making two city parks accessible to persons 
with disabilities. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Moncayo described how Quito's unified municipal government 
(a city council and a single mayor for eight administrative 
districts) makes the city's management strong in comparison to that 
of many others in Latin America.  Finally, he and his advisor for 
International Affairs, Rene Pinto, both stressed that they hoped the 
municipality's close relationship with the Embassy would continue, 
and invited the Ambassador to participate in Quito's twice annual 
cultural history course. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  The tone of the meeting was very pleasant. 
Moncayo, who is an Ecuadorian war hero and strong political figure, 
did not delve into any of the currently politically sensitive topics 
such as the new Quito airport, or the upcoming referendum on 
Ecuador's draft Constitution.  He did mention the need for closer 
cooperation with the central government, particularly in the area of 
municipal security, but focused on providing a cordial welcome for 
the Ambassador.
