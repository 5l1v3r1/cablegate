REMANUFACTURING TEXT 
 
REF: STATE 107233 
 
¶1.  Econoff and an official from the Japanese Embassy delivered 
reftel points to officials of the Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign 
Trade (COMEX) on October 30.  Though the Costa Ricans did not commit 
to co-sponsor the negotiated text, COMEX officials had "no 
differences" with the U.S.-Japan-Switzerland proposal.  In Costa 
Rica, manufactured and remanufactured goods receive the same market 
access:  there are no differences.  The GOCR does require labeling 
on goods which distinguishes manufactured from remanufactured goods 
(per the Consumer Protection Law, number 7472). 
 
¶2.  COMEX officials Dr. Francisco Monge Arino, COMEX's Director of 
Trade Monitoring, and Indiana Trejos, COMEX Advisor, raised one 
issue with the U.S.-Japanese demarche team.  They requested the need 
for a clear distinction between used goods and remanufactured goods. 
 Though admittedly not as relevant with "hard" goods, the concern 
focused on donated used goods, particularly clothing that may have 
been exposed to disease such as dengue fever.  Though not mentioned 
by Monge or Trejos, this concern could be relevant with "hard" goods 
in the medical field.  In this area, the distinction between used 
and remanufactured can denote a significant difference in safety. 
 
¶3.  Advisor Trejos will travel to Geneva for the upcoming week and 
will consult with COMEX's WTO representative in Geneva.  Econoff 
invited Trejos to attend the November 4 workshop on remanufactured 
goods.  Trejos did not indicate whether she would attend but 
acknowledged the invitation with interest.  Econoff gave COMEX a 
non-paper of the talking points and anticipates support from the 
GOCR.
