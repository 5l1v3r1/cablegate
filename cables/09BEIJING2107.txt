  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. U.S.-CHINA 
 
"Strategic dialogue can eliminate conflict from the very beginning" 
 
The official popular newspaper Beijing Youth Daily (Beijing 
Qingnianbao) (07/23): "Zhu Shida, a research fellow at the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences' American Society and Culture Research 
Division, said an important aspect of Obama's 'New Deal' is to 
abandon unilateralism and upgrade U.S. participation in the S&ED, a 
vivid example of Obama's multilateralism.  Zhu said regular 
strategic dialogue can eliminate conflict from the very beginning. 
A stable bilateral relationship is indispensable for U.S. economic 
recovery as well as for the wellbeing of the Chinese people.  China 
and the U.S. can only enhance bilateral relations through: 
understanding and cooperation in tackling crises, economic balance, 
and building a strong financial system." 
 
¶2.  U.S. MEDIA ON "CHINESE ECONOMIC SPIES" 
 
"American media hype surrounding 'Chinese economic spies'" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (07/23): "Every 
now and then, the U.S. catches a few so-called 'Chinese Spies' and 
then the American media surrounds this with a lot of hype.  "The 
allegation that a Chinese person stole trade secrets in the United 
States and gave them to China is a pure fabrication made up from 
ulterior motives," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.  Jin Canrong, 
a professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin 
University, said the claim that 3,500 Chinese students and Chinese 
decedents overseas are acting as spies reflects the fact that the 
U.S.'s elite strategists have no understanding of China's 30 years 
of transformation, and that the Americans have overestimated the 
Chinese government's capability.  Shi Yinhong, a professor of 
International Relations at Renmin University, said the Chinese 
government has never had any policy to steal technology through its 
people.  There are Americans violating Chinese law here but it 
hasn't been hyped by the Chinese media and the Chinese government 
doesn't criticize the U.S. just because of its citizens' behavior. 
" 
 
¶3. U.S. BACK IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
 
"The U.S. is back in Southeast Asia, move to crowd China out" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (07/23): "Niu 
Xinchun, a researcher at the China Institute of Contemporary 
International Relations, said the reason why the U.S. sent Secretary 
of State Clinton to the ASEAN forum was based on considerations of 
maritime security and resources and joint anti-terrorism efforts. 
Niu argued that 'U.S.-Mekong cooperation' is also strongly desired 
by Mekong countries (i.e. countries bordering the Mekong River, 
which include Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam).  They welcome 
the U.S. to put more importance on them.  Although these nations 
rely more on China for trade, they hope they can rely more on the 
U.S. for security and politics.  Shi Yinhong, a professor of 
International Relations at Renmin University, said Obama will pay 
more attention to implementing 'smart power' in Southeast Asia.  Shi 
also argued that the U.S. has not set ambitious goals in the region 
because it wants to lay solid diplomatic foundations without 
offending anyone."
