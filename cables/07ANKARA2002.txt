In Today's Papers 
 
Speculation on Presidency Continues 
All papers report CHP leader Deniz Baykal called on the AKP to 
nominate a presidential candidate who would be approved by all 
parties, warning that otherwise the Turkish people could be 
distressed again.  Islamist-oriented Zaman criticizes Baykal for 
displaying no change in attitude since the presidential crisis in 
April.  Mainstream Vatan reports MHP sources as claiming Gul will 
announce Monday his withdrawal from the race, the sources stressing 
that the AKP does not want fresh tensions with the military. The 
paper says Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul is the AKP candidate for the 
top job.  Mainstream Hurriyet quotes unidentified AKP sources as 
saying that Gul will not become parliament speaker if he decides to 
pullout of the presidential race, but will keep the post of Foreign 
Minister.  The Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak says in a commentary 
that in their hours-long meeting on Wednesday, the AKP leaders 
Erdogan, Bulent Arinc, and Gul have decided to follow the "Omerta" 
rule and will not talk to the press on the matter. 
 
CHP Report Blames All but the Party for Election Defeat 
All papers report CHP has refrained from self-criticism in a report 
evaluating the results of the July 22 elections.  The report says 
the AKP victory in the elections came about because of the support 
of the EU and the US for the AKP, religious sects and imams as well 
as the "bribes" offered to voters by AKP municipalities.  Those who 
want a "second republic" in Turkey are very influential in the media 
and they have influenced the public with their brainwashing efforts, 
the CHP report says.  It claims religious sects, which are gaining 
ground in Turkish state institutions, business life, education and 
media, supported the AKP.  It says in eastern and southeastern 
Turkey, the AKP deceived voters with confusing messages on the fight 
against terror.  The AKP has also not hesitated to exploit the 
religious feelings of voters, according to the report. 
 
Novak Voices Opposition to US-Turkey Action against the PKK 
All papers report The Washington Post columnist Robert Novak 
confirmed at the Heritage Foundation on Thursday that the 
information featured in his recent column about a "secret" Capitol 
Hill briefing on possible US-Turkey joint operations against the PKK 
came from a Congressman who was against the idea.  Novak reportedly 
said "the Congressman and I are happy if we helped prevent it; this 
operation had no relation to US security."  Papers report when asked 
if he realized this had angered the Turks, Novak said, "It depends 
whose side you are on.  A terrorist to some can be a freedom fighter 
to others." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Possible US-Turkey Operations against the 
PKK 
Hasan Mesut Hazar writes in the conservative daily Turkiye: "The 
stories in the American press about a joint US-Turkish operation 
against the PKK were distorted and sensationalized by the Turkish 
press.  First of all, taking joint steps against the PKK is not a 
brand new project and the two countries have long been talking about 
it.  The special envoy mechanism has lead to some important 
developments.  However, the challenges faced by the US in Iraq are 
making things even more difficult and are preventing the US from 
taking fast action.  However, the unfulfilled promises regarding the 
fight against the PKK presence in Iraq have caused severe 
disappointment in Turkey. This inaction is the main reason for 
growing anti-Americanism in Turkey; and also sets a bad example in 
the broader context of the global fight against terrorism.  The US 
has taken positive steps against the PKK, including efforts to cut 
off financial links and a successful push to get both NATO and the 
EU to recognize the PKK as a terrorist organization.  Yet, the 
essence of the problem stems from the fact that Northern Iraq is 
still a shelter for terrorists and they continue their attacks on 
Turkey from there.  Eventually, this issue will be solved and drop 
from the Turkish-American agenda because a solution not only serves 
Turkish and American interests, it enhances both regional and world

peace.  During this process, Turkey has to revise its policy, be 
cool and be realistic.  Turkey can't turn its back on Iraqi Kurds, 
and it must not be carried away by provocative nationalist 
sentiments." 
 
Mustafa Balbay writes in the nationalist-leftist daily Cumhuriyet: 
"The recent story about a secret operation by the US against the PKK 
is a comedy because the US reportedly is very upset following the 
leak of this plan to the press.  Are we supposed to believe that 
such secret plans to fight terrorism are presented to Congress 
before taking action?   The fact of the matter is that the US cannot 
take any action anywhere in Iraq that might upset the Iraqi Kurds. 
What we see today is a game played by the US: Trying to be nice to 
Kurds while also trying to make it look to Turks as if the US is 
really fighting against terrorism." 
 
US-Sought Ukrainian Hacker Captured in Turkey 
Milliyet, Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, Zaman and others report 
Ukranian hacker Maksym Yastremsky., arrested by Turkish police near 
Antalya, was on the US wanted list for crimes related to 
international hacking.  Reportedly, Yastremsky has so far stolen 
credit card information of 50,000 to 60,000 people including 1200 
Turks.  Papers report the prosecutor's office and police said he had 
no ties with al-Qaeda, as had previously been reported by a Turkish 
media outlet.  The Prosecutor's office said there is a 60-day period 
for extradition under international regulation, and the Ukrainian 
hacker could be handed over to the US once the investigation in 
Turkey as well as international formalities have been completed.
