NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE MEMBER JALALI OCTOBER 13, 14 COMMENTS 
 
DUBAI 00000438  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
(U) The following are translations of comments from IRIG 
officials on nuclear-related topics during the period October 13 
to 14. 
 
 
 
OCTOBER 14 
 
------------------- 
 
 
 
- FM Mottaki On Secretary Clinton's Iran Comments (IRNA): 
 
 
 
 [Question: What is the IRIG position re comments made by the 
Russian and US Foreign Ministers]: 
 
 
 
"Clinton's positions are inconsistent with the prevailing 
realities and with the results obtained from the Geneva talks 
and methods such as this dual track are models that have lost 
their luster and which lack utility.  We suggest that Clinton 
adopt some realism and refrain from repeating the fruitless 
slogans of the Bush era." 
 
 
 
[in reference to Iran's proposed package]: 
 
 
 
"Iran's proposed package and that which was obtained between the 
meetings of the Geneva conference can move the sides towards new 
grounds in the light of justice and constructive discussions." 
 
 
 
OCTOBER 13 
 
-------------------- 
 
 
 
- Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Commission 
Rapporteur Kazem Jalali to reporters (ISNA): 
 
 
 
[On Secretary Clinton's Russia Visit]: 
 
 
 
"Some countries are trying to rally an alliance against Iran 
and/or taking steps to create conditions of a psychological war 
and a negative atmosphere against Iran and negotiations.  These 
actions are not realistic and we don't accept using tricks and 
the media to create such an alliance.. those days are gone.  In 
its package Iran has stressed that we can find a common way 
forward to solve regional and international problems." 
 
 
 
[On Common US-Israel Joint Military Exercises]: 
 
 
 
Jalili emphasized that the behavior of the Zionist Regime in 
threatening Iran with military attack and the silence of the 
international community was undiplomatic and inconsistent with 
international standards, adding that]: "Iran sees all these 
actions as political bluffs and we have the necessary 
preparedness to counter any aggression.. the Zionist Regime is 
too vulnerable to wish to attack us and if such an act is to 
occur we will stand against it..  US-Zionist Regime Joint 
Military Exercises are to the detriment of the US and are 
inconsistent with [President] Obama's slogan of 'change' and 
indicates that the Zionist Regime has a decisive role in 
American policy." 
 
 
 
DUBAI 00000438  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
[On the Fordo Installation]: Jalali said that members of the 
National Security Commission would be inspecting Fordo in the 
near future. 
 
 
 
- AEOI Announces Creation of Two New Medical Isotopes 
(AEOI/Dowlat): 
 
 
 
AEOI announced the production of two new medical isotopes in the 
Nuclear Science and Technology Research Center, against the 
backdrop of a sales embargo of special medical isotopes to Iran. 
  These medical isotopes are in the final stages of approval for 
use and will start mass production as soon as permission is 
received from the Health Ministry.
