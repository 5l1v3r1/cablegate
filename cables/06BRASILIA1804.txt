SUBJECT: TORRES STRAIT - DEMARCHE ON AUSTRALIAN COMPULSORY PILOTAGE 
REGIME DELIVERED TO BRAZIL 
 
REF: STATE 136187 
 
Econoffs delivered reftel talking points to Michel Arslanian Neto, 
First Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Division of 
Services, Investments and Financial Affairs.  Arslanian did not know 
the status of Australia's decision on the Torres Strait and 
expressed surprise at the October 6 implementation deadline.  While 
Arslanian could not give an official answer, he said that another 
colleague from the Ministry would reply to our request as soon as 
possible.  He stated that he understood that time was a factor. 
Arslanian said that the potential for important thoroughfare 
countries like Panama to also make pilotage requirements was 
disturbing.  Brazil clearly recognizes that a domino effect would be 
detrimental to trade flows and could affect exports.  Post will 
forward the Ministry's official response when we receive it.
