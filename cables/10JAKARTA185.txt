SUBJECT: Indonesian National Agency for Drug and Food Control (BPOM) 
Agrees to Engage with Post to Resolve Challenges Related to its 
System of Product Registration (ML) for Processed Food Products 
 
(U) On February 10, 2010 representatives from the Foreign 
Agricultural Service's (FAS) Jakarta office met with representatives 
from BPOM as a follow-up to a meeting on February 2, 2010 between 
officials from BPOM, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 
and FAS' Jakarta and Washington offices.  The topic of the initial 
meeting was BPOM's ML system for processed food products and the 
resulting challenges U.S. exporters face when attempting to export 
processed food products to Indonesia. 
 
The objective of the February 10 meeting was to continue the 
dialogue initiated on February 2, and to further seek solutions for 
a more workable ML system for U.S. processed food products.  FAS 
asked BPOM for weekly meetings until the scheduled visit of 
President Obama to Indonesia in late March.  BPOM agreed to this 
request and Friday, February 12, 2010 was identified for the next 
meeting.  Furthermore, FAS asked BPOM to broaden the discussions to 
include private sector industry representatives, to which BPOM also 
agreed. FAS stressed the need to find a mutually agreeable, workable 
process to advance Indonesian food safety, as well as facilitating 
trade. 
FAS Jakarta is currently identifying and coordinating appropriate 
industry representatives.
