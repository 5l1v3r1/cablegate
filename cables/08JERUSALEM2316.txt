AIRSTRIKES; ROCKETS CONTINUE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  From 1300 to 1800 local on December 30, 
17 Palestinians were injured in Israeli airstrikes in the 
Gaza Strip, and at least 10 more rockets hit Israel.  At 
least 360 Palestinians have been killed and 1100 injured in 
airstrikes through 1800 on December 30.  Clashes broke out in 
the West Bank near Qalandiya, in which eight Palestinian 
youths were injured.  President Mahmud Abbas (Abu Mazen) 
cancelled planned PA Christmas and New Year's celebrations. 
Hamas spokesmen attacked Abbas and claimed PA leaders are 
planning to displace Hamas in Gaza at the conclusion of 
Israeli military operations there.  End summary. 
 
17 Injured in Airstrikes; 
Grad-Type Rocket Stretches East to Rahat 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gaza-based contacts and Israeli press report that 
IAF airstrikes hit several houses and "government" facilities 
in the Gaza Strip, but significantly decreased from 1300 to 
1800 local on December 30 compared to earlier periods. 
Gaza-based contacts report that IAF fire destroyed a Hamas 
military-wing leader's house in Gaza City at about 1500 on 
December 20, and that Israelis speaking Arabic called the 
house minutes before the airstrike and demanded the residents 
evacuate.  A defunct dairy processing plant in the same 
neighborhood was also hit and heavily damaged, according to 
these contacts.  At 1430, Palestinian press reported two 
airstrikes in northern Gaza near Bayt Hanun injured three 
Palestinians.  Gaza-based contacts said the strike appeared 
to target a Hamas military-wing training facility.  At 1515, 
several IAF planes fired rockets into open areas in northern 
Gaza outside Bayt Hanun, without causing injuries, according 
to a political contact in north Gaza.  Airstrikes were also 
reported at around 1520 in Khan Yunis. 
 
Qassams, Grads Strike Negev Towns 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) From 1300-1315 on December 30, Gaza-based contacts 
report two Qassam rockets were fired from northern Gaza and 
landed in fields near Sderot, and three others landed over 
1km away from Sderot.  Israeli press did not report injuries 
or property damage from these strikes.  At around 1425, a 
Qassam rocket hit a house in Sderot, causing significant 
damage but no injuries.  At around 1530, two Qassam rockets 
landed in the Shaar HaNegev region, without causing reported 
injuries or property damage.  At 1555, Hamas outlets claimed 
to have launched a Grad rocket toward Beer Sheva.  Israeli 
press reported that a Grad-type rocket struck near Rahat, but 
did not cause injuries or significant damage.  (Note: Rahat 
is roughly 16km north of Beer Sheva, and this Grad is likely 
the rocket Hamas intended for Beer Sheva.  Rahat is an 
Arab-Israeli town approximately 35km from likely Gaza launch 
points, and has not previously been targeted by rockets.  End 
note).  A rocket hit Ashkelon at around 1715, but Israeli 
press did not report injuries or property damage. 
 
West Bank and Jerusalem Clashes 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) At 1300 local, clashes between Palestinian 
protesters and the IDF/border police erupted near Qalandia 
checkpoint (south of Ramallah). Protesters threw rocks and 
Molotov cocktails at Israeli forces and burned tires near the 
checkpoint.  The IDF dispersed rioters with teargas and 
rubber bullets.  At least eight Palestinian youths were 
injured.  Two demonstrations were organized in Asira 
al-Shamaliya and Qusin villages in the Nablus area. No 
clashes with the IDF reported.  A few dozen Palestinian and 
international protesters demonstrated in front of the U.S. 
Consulate General facility in East Jerusalem, protesting IDF 
operations in Gaza.  The protest was peaceful and did not 
disrupt USG operations. 
 
Political Reactions 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) President Abbas issued a decision to cancel all New 
Year and Christmas celebrations "to protest the Israeli 
aggression on Gaza." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Hamas pledged to continue resistance in Gaza, with 
senior Hamas spokesman Ismayil Radwan claiming that "in the 
face of this terrorist and barbaric aggression, we affirm 
that our will won't be broken, we won't hoist the white flag 
to the criminal occupiers and will face the Zionists with 
more steadfastness." Radwan threatened to "step up 
retaliation against Zionist occupiers."  Hamas outlets 
 
JERUSALEM 00002316  002 OF 002 
 
 
claimed President Abbas "is working in coordination with 
Israel and the Egyptian authorities, and is preparing to take 
control of Gaza following the IDF military operations." 
Hamas claimed that "President Abbas ordered PA officials in 
Ramallah to set up an operations room in preparation for what 
he termed 'the downfall of the Hamas regime in Gaza' and this 
scheme is supported by the PA interior minister and security 
chiefs."
