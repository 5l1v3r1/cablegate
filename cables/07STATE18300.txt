Communique of the International Contact Group on Somalia 
 
The International Contact Group on Somalia met in Dar es 
Salaam on 9 February to review the political, security, 
development, and humanitarian situation in Somalia.  The 
Contact Group pledged its support for the commitment of 
President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed at the African Union Summit 
on 29 January to engage in political reconciliation leading 
to all-inclusive governance in Somalia.  The Contact Group 
will further support the efforts of the Transitional Federal 
Government to ensure rule of law, stability and security, and 
to promote national unity. 
 
The Contact Group welcomes the recent decision of the African 
Union to deploy a peace support mission in Somalia to help 
contribute to the stabilization of the country, provide 
security, and create the space for a continued process of 
inclusive dialogue and reconciliation.  The Contact Group 
welcomes the pledges of several African countries to provide 
troops, logistical support, training and financial 
assistance, and encourages others to support this effort. 
The Contact Group appeals to the international community to 
provide urgent support to the African Union and the troop 
contributing countries to permit rapid deployment, as well as 
support those who have offered to train the Somali security 
forces.  The Contact Group welcomes the United Nations 
Security Council Press Statement of 2 February and looks 
forward to the adoption of a Resolution that modifies 
Resolution 1725 to authorize the African Union Mission in 
Somalia (AMISOM). 
 
The Contact Group reiterates its commitment to support the 
Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) and the Somali 
people in pursuing an inclusive political process.  The 
Contact Group welcomes the initiative of President Yusuf to 
convene a National Reconciliation Congress to engage in 
dialogue with clan elders, religious leaders, the business 
community, and civil society.  The Contact Group recognizes 
the centrality of this Somali-owned National Reconciliation 
Congress and expects it to contribute towards the 
establishment of inclusive and effective governance 
structures at the local, regional, and national level within 
the framework of the Transitional Federal Charter.  The 
Contact Group stresses that those who renounce violence and 
extremism and pledge to constructively engage in achieving a 
sustainable political settlement in Somalia should be 
included in this process.  The Contact Group condemns all 
acts of violence and extremism inside Somalia, including 
statements urging continued violence. 
 
The Contact Group urges the donor community to provide 
additional resources in a coordinated manner to the 
reconciliation process and to enable the TFIs to establish 
administrative institutions, including for the rule of law, 
and expand social service provision, as well as to support 
post-conflict reconstruction and development.  The Contact 
Group remains concerned by the persisting complex 
humanitarian emergency in Somalia.  The Contact Group urges 
the international community to increase its humanitarian 
assistance and calls on all parties to ensure free access and 
safe environment for relief efforts.
