Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage May 25 on the year-end legislative elections, on an alleged 
corruption scandal involving the renovation of the National Palace 
Museum, and on other local issues.  The centrist, KMT-leaning "China 
Times" front-paged an exclusive banner headline that read "Revamping 
the Party Charter and Moving toward Nativism; KMT Removes 
Unification and Adds Taiwan [to Its Party Charter]."  In terms of 
editorials and commentaries, an op-ed piece in the pro-unification 
"United Daily News" commented on AIT Director Stephen Young's 
remarks on cross-Strait trade relations in a speech to Taiwan's 
Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce Monday.  The 
article said that Taiwan needs to pay attention to Young's call for 
further opening of cross-Strait trade relations because, as an 
onlooker who sees most of the game, Young is more objective in 
pointing a way for Taiwan to get out of its current predicament. 
End summary. 
 
"Stephen Young Knows about the Predicament of a Frog Being Cooked in 
Lukewarm Water" 
 
Associate Professor Pang Chien-kuo of Chinese Culture University's 
Sun Yat-sen Graduate Institute opined in the pro-unification "United 
Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] (5/25): 
 
"AIT Director Stephen Young has again emphasized before President 
Chen Shui-bian recently that a critical way to improve the 
U.S.-Taiwan trade partnership is for Taiwan to further open its 
economic relationship with China.  The question is:  the speaker was 
talking with great earnestness, but what about the listener? ...  If 
[Taiwan] does not want to become a frog cooked in lukewarm water, it 
has to pay attention to Young's remarks.  Why does Young, who is 
generally believed to be very friendly with President Chen, have to 
speak [such remarks] out loud repeatedly?  What Young has been 
pleading for are of course the interests of U.S. businesses.  But it 
is exactly because Young is an onlooker who can see clearly most of 
the game, he is more objective in pointing out to Chen how Taiwan 
can get out of its [current] predicament. 
 
"It is already common sense [for people] that Taiwan's stalling in 
opening [cross-Strait] direct transportation, which has hindered the 
free flow of people, goods, and capital across the Taiwan Strait, 
has done serious damage to Taiwan's competitiveness.  The general 
public may not understand the basic truth about globalization, but 
they are aware that, if there is no breakthrough in the cross-Strait 
relations, the only way for them to make more money will be to 
withdraw money from the banks and the stock market and use it to buy 
all kinds of mutual funds that invest in Chinese or foreign 
enterprises or stock markets.  As a result, Taiwan's economy will 
continue to linger in the doldrums, rendering the island more and 
more like the frog caught in lukewarm water. 
 
"Will there be risks if [Taiwan] loosens its policies on 
cross-Strait [trade relations]?  Of course.  But as in the case of 
confronting the competition created by globalization, risks and 
opportunities always co-exist.  To be a winner, one must be able to 
control risks and seize opportunities.  Taiwan has already missed 
the optimal timing, and if it continues procrastinating, it will 
only be pushed to the edge of the big platform of globalization and 
regional integration.  Let us wait and see if Chang Chun-hsiung's 
Cabinet is able to break through the impasse across the Taiwan 
Strait, control the risks and seize the opportunities."
