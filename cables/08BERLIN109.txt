¶1. (SBU) Summary: The German delegation to the second Major 
Economies Meeting has been finalized and will now include a 
representative of the Federal Chancellery in addition to 
those from the Environment and Foreign Affairs Ministries. In 
response to the action request (REF A), the Environment 
Ministry provided additional feedback on MEM agenda items on 
January 24. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As previously noted (REF B), the German delegation 
will be led by Environment Ministry State Secretary Matthias 
Machnig. The team will also include his colleagues Karsten 
Sach and Carolin Zerger, as well as Foreign Ministry 
representative Reinhardt Krapp. It is now confirmed that Dr. 
Peter Roesgen, the Deputy Director General for 
Infrastructure, will represent the Federal Chancellery. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a discussion with EconOff on January 24, Ms. 
Zerger relayed Germany's top concerns about the MEM II. 
Zerger said that delegates must first speak about exactly how 
the MEM will contribute to the UNFCCC and which specific 
topics should be included in MEM discussions (noting some 
topics should not be addressed, REF B). Second, Germany wants 
to talk about peak emissions in the context of discussions 
about a Long Term Goal. Germany supports the IPCC 
recommendation that this should happen in the next 10 to 15 
years. Third, Zerger stressed that Germany will talk about 
technological sectoral approaches only in the context of 
absolute numerical targets that she said are needed in the UN 
process. Finally, Zerger repeated that Germany does not want 
to discuss forestry, adaptation or measurement in the Major 
Economies Process.
