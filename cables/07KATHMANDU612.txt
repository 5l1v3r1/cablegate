Andrei Trofimov on March 21 asked Nepal's Foreign Minister 
K.P. Oli to endorse in writing the Statement of Principles 
for the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and 
agree to Nepal's participation in the third meeting of the 
initiative (Ref B).  Noting Nepal's strong support for

for counter-proliferation measures, Oli assured the 
Ambassadors that Nepal would carefully review and consider 
endorsing the Global Initiative Statement of Principles.
