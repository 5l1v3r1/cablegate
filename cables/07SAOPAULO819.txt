SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX BREAKS RECORD 
 
REF: SAO PAULO 709 
 
¶1.  On September 27, the primary index on Brazil's stock exchange 
surpassed 60,000 points for the first time in its history.  The 
Ibovespa, the main indicator of the Brazilian stock market's average 
performance, gained nearly 11 percent in the month of September, and 
is up 36 percent in 2007.  It is the only Latin American index to 
recover all its losses in the wake of the August U.S. sub-prime 
credit crisis (reftel). 
 
¶2.  A rush of foreign capital is contributing to the Ibovespa's rise 
as investors seek to take advantage of growth in emerging markets. 
Executives from Banco Itau and Unibanco, two of Brazil's largest 
banks, pointed to turmoil in the U.S. and Europe as one of the 
primary drivers for an increase in foreign portfolio investment 
particularly in emerging markets such as Brazil.  Brazil is an 
attractive option because of high commodity prices, the strength of 
the currency (Real), and the view that the growth of the Brazilian 
economy is stable and may be accelerating.  In the first three weeks 
of September alone, foreign portfolio investment in the Brazilian 
stock market totaled approximately USD 970 million. 
 
¶3.  Bank representatives stated that they remain optimistic for 
further growth of the Ibovespa as they view Brazilian stocks as 
undervalued.  They estimated that Ibovespa would continue to climb 
in coming weeks until reaching 65,000 points, when investors could 
begin to sell off their investments, which would cool the overall 
growth of the market.  Their collective forecast for the year-end 
Ibovespa performance is on the order of 63,000 which would result in 
an end of year performance of 39 percent for 2007. 
 
¶4.  A research analyst at Morgan Stanley also informed Econoffs that 
during a recent series of meetings with clients in Europe and the 
U.S., investors displayed very high levels of confidence in Brazil 
and see strong economic fundamentals and growing domestic demand as 
driving future growth in the country.  In addition, the analyst 
pointed out that Mexico and Argentina did not have the confidence of 
investors which may also be contributing to larger inflows of 
investment into Brazil as investors seek to invest in those emerging 
markets with the most sound fundamentals and prospects for positive 
returns. 
 
¶5.  Comment:  Although the consensus suggests that Brazil's positive 
stock market performance is here to stay, Brazil is entering 
uncharted territory.  While low inflation, interest rates 
approaching single digits, and an exchange rate beneath the 
psychological barrier of USD 2 to 1 Real point to continued positive 
returns in the Ibovespa, much of this rise is due to foreign 
investment which is highly agile and can move quickly.  While there 
remain concerns over the lack of reforms, infrastructure obstacles, 
a less than friendly business environment, and other economic 
challenges, the overall sense seems to be that the lack of reforms 
in these areas is merely a missed opportunity and is not of 
overriding concern for the near term.  End Comment. 
 
¶6.  This cable was coordinated with Embassy Brasilia.
