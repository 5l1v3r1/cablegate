Summary: 
-------- 
 
¶1.  Ambassador Struble traveled on 9/15 with government 
Ministers, Congresspersons and local leaders to close the 
bilateral New Horizons Humanitarian Exercises in Lambayeque 
Province.  The group visited a medical readiness site, a 
school, and a well drilling project, all built compliments of 
New Horizons.  National and local officials were pleased with 
the projects and the visit generated favorable publicity. 
Peru's MOD expressed an interest in having the Peruvian 
military acquire similar social work capabilities.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador Struble traveled to Chiclayo in Lambayeque 
Province with the Minister of Defense (MOD) Alan Tizon 
Wagner, Chief of the Joint Command General Jose Williams 
Zapata, Minister of Health (MOH) Carlos Vallejo.  Commanding 
General of the Peruvian Army Cesar Reinoso joined the 
Ambassador in Lambayeque.  The group visited selected New 
Horizons sites, generating favorable press and underscoring 
the value of U.S. assistance. 
 
¶3.  After the closing ceremony in Chiclayo, the AMB and his 
invitees departed by Blackhawk helicopter to visit select 
project sites, where local mayors greeted them.  The sites 
visited were: 
 
--A U.S. Navy-run Medical Readiness Exercise (MEDRETE) in 
Morrope, which was treating approximately 1,500 
poverty-stricken civilians per day for a variety of 
illnesses.  AMB did an on-site interview via cell phone with 
Peru Radio Programs (RPP) anchorman, Raul Vargas. 
 
--A two-room school built in Hornitos during the exercise. 
AMB and the MOD inaugurated the school.  A substantial local 
crowd held up signs thanking the United States and the GOP 
and gave handmade gifts to the AMB and MOD. 
 
--A site containing one of three water wells provided by New 
Horizons.  Again, a large crowd welcomed the USG and the GOP 
with signs thanking the United States for the Embassy's help 
in obtaining water for their village.  While the drilling 
operation went on, a gusher of water spewed forth from the 
well.  Locals cheered and clapped. 
 
¶4.  The group finished by attending a lunch in Chiclayo, 
which featured press interviews and an exchange of highly 
favorable comments about the value of the humanitarian 
assistance.

¶5.  MOD reps were particularly impressed with the 
well-drilling site.  One of President Garcia,s campaign 
promises was, "Water for all," and this activity addressed 
that issue.  MOD Wagner told the Ambassador that he would 
like the Peruvian military to do more humanitarian 
assistance. 
 
¶6.  The visit was well-received, provided an effective 
demonstration of USG humanitarian assistance and underscored 
our close partnership with the Peruvian military and elected 
representatives from Lambayeque.
