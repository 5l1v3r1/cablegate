¶1.  (U)  Summary.  The widely publicized Thai labor problems 
relating to construction of Kaohsiung's subway continue to simmer. 
Huapan Management, the company that recruited the laborers, in 
February filed an NTD 19.7 million lawsuit against fourteen of the 
laborers involved in the initial riot last August 21 (reftels). 
However, following scathing criticism from Premier Su Tseng-chang, 
the company reduced the requested damages to a single NTD. 
Separately, total of nine criminal indictments, eight for corruption 
and one against two of the laborers, have resulted thus far.  The 
laborers staged a brief work stoppage on 31 March, but were 
convinced to return to work by 3 April.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Prosecutor Kao Ta-fang, the lead investigator in the case, 
confirmed that Huapan Administration Consultant Company had filed a 
criminal complaint against the fourteen Thai laborers who initiated 
the riot last August.  In February, 2006 Huapan filed a civil 
lawsuit requesting damages of 19.7 million NT dollars for damage to 
facilities.  However, in response to scathing criticism by Premier 
Su Tseng-chang and a variety of labor leaders, Huapan reduced the 
requested compensation to 1 NT Dollar.   Premier Su had urged that 
Huapan drop the lawsuit altogether.  Su also directed Kaohsiung Mass 
Rapid Transit Corporation (KRTC) to provide assistance to the 
laborers in defending the case. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Prosecutor Kao told AIT/K that his office has brought a 
total of eight corruption indictments against several persons 
including Kaohsiung city government officials, KRTC executives, and 
Huapan owners.  Chen Che-nan, (former Presidential adviser and 
father of former Acting Kaohsiung Mayor, Chen Chi-mai) who has been 
widely rumored to have been involved in the scandal (see reftels), 
has also been indicted.  In addition, the Kaohsiung Prosecutors' 
Office has brought in indictments against two Thai laborers 
suspected of instigating the riot.  Prosecutor Kao pointed out that 
these indictments have already been passed to the Kaohsiung District 
Court, which will determine when the cases will be heard. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Additionally, on March 31, six hundred Thai laborers 
staged a three day work stoppage, reportedly to express their 
dissatisfaction over living conditions at their dormitories in 
Kaohsiung County.  However, Mayor Yeh Chu-lan told AIT/K that the 
work stoppage resulted from a misunderstanding about wage levels and 
that once the misunderstanding was cleared up, the workers agreed to 
return to work immediately.  Press reports claimed that KRTC agreed 
to make further improvements in living conditions.  In any case, the 
Thai laborers returned to work on April 3. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  On April 3, AIT Director Stephen Young visited Acting 
Mayor Yeh Chu-lan.  During the meeting, Yeh emphasized that the 
Kaohsiung Subway is being built under the build-operate-transfer 
(BOT) model.  She added that KRTC, a private contractor, is fully 
responsible for the construction and initial operation of the 
subway.  Yeh also said that although local prosecutors have brought 
indictments against some of the city's Rapid Transit Bureau 
officials, the guilt or innocence of the officials has yet to be 
determined by the courts.  Yeh opined that Huapan's poor management, 
rather than governmental corruption, was the root cause of the riot. 
  She also told us that Chen Che-nan is under detention and 
investigation for incidents completely unrelated to the Kaohsiung 
Subway labor scandal. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The KRTC currently employs 1,500 Thai laborers.  The 
corporation has decided to reduce gradually the use of Thai workers 
as the construction is completed at several sites next year.  A KRTC 
executive told AIT/K that he estimates that there will be no foreign 
laborers working on the subway construction by July, 2007.
