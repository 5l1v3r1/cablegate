REF: LONDON 778 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Greg Berry for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Kosovo Charge Muhamet Hamiti informed Political 
Minister Counselor that he will travel to Pristina the week 
of May 31 to complete the "bureaucratic" procedures for his 
appointment as Ambassador to the Court of St. James, with 
accreditation to New Zealand (per reftel, the GONZ has agreed 
to this arrangement).  The process consists of a panel review 
(consisting of foreign ministry, civil service and civil 
society sector representatives) followed by the Prime and 
Foreign Ministers' final approval.  Although there are a 
number of candidates in the running, Hamiti was confident 
his name would be presented to HMG for agrement in 
mid-to-late June, and he has encouraged his ministry to 
expedite the process so it can be completed prior to the UK 
summer holiday season. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Hamiti was optimistic that the number of countries 
recognizing Kosovo's independence would grow from its current 
¶96.  He said that Saudi Arabia's decision to recognize would 
open the door for other Islamic countries to do likewise, 
after a "waiting period so they do not seem like followers." 
Hamiti was hopeful that the May 25 Organization of Islamic 
Countries ministerial statement noting the "progress made 
towards strengthening democracy in Kosovo" and calling on the 
"international community to continue contributing to the 
fostering of Kosovo's economy" would help to shift the 
position of harder-line countries, such as Libya.  Hamiti 
appreciated the support the U.S. and UK were giving Kosovo's 
recognition campaign and the efforts of both to encourage 
Belgrade to take a more positive approach towards Pristina 
and regional stability.
