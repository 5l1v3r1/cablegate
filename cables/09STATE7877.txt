SUBJECT: ENGAGING THE ROC REGARDING THE M/V MONCHEGORSK 
 
REF: A. STATE 5968 
        ¶B. EUR/SE-EMBASSY O-I OF JANUARY 26 
 
 
Classified by:  ASSISTANT SECRETARY DANIEL FRIED, EUR. 
Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an Action Request. Please see 
paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  (S)  Background and Objective: The M/V MONCHEGORSK, a 
Cypriot-flagged, Russian owned vessel leased by Islamic 
Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), left Bandar 
Abbas, Iran in mid-January, bound for Latakia, Syria. On 
January 19 and 20, U.S. naval forces in the Red Sea 
twice boarded the vessel with the master's consent to 
inspect the cargo.  Initial reports indicated that the 
cargo consisted of large-caliber cannon shells and small 
arms ammunition-related components.  A more thorough 
examination of the data resulting from the inspection 
indicates that the portion of the cargo that was 
inspected consisted of components, including propellant, 
for various caliber artillery, tank, and small arms 
rounds.  Based on these additional details, we consider 
this shipment of "arms or related material" from Iran a 
violation of UNSCR 1747. 
 
¶3. (S) The Republic of Cyprus (ROC) agreed to take 
action as the flag state and issued a voluntary recall 
of the Monchegorsk to port in Cyprus.  Updated 
information as of 1900 EST, January 28, 2009, indicated 
the vessel was prepared to proceed to Limassol, Cyprus 
and would probably arrive early the morning of 29 
January.  The Department requests Embassy Nicosia to 
urge the ROC to be as assertive as possible in 
encouraging the ROC to conduct a  thorough inspection of 
the cargo. 
 
¶4. (S/REL CYPRUS) Action Request:  Embassy Nicosia is 
asked to use, as needed, the following points with ROC 
officials. 
 
Begin Points 
 
-- There is continued concern at the highest levels of 
the USG about the cargo of the M/V Monchegorsk. 
 
--Following the U.S. Naval personnel boarding of the M/V 
Monchegorsk on January 19 and 20, the USG believes the 
transfer of cargo on board may be a violation of UNSCR 
¶1747. 
 
--Given our knowledge of this transshipment, we may need 
to raise this issue at the UN Security Council. 
 
--We would like to fully coordinate any actions taken by 
our Mission in NY with your government. 
 
--We would especially like to be able to refer to the 
positive actions taken by Cyprus to ensure this ship was 
not allowed to violate the terms of UNSCR 1747. 
 
--In particular, we would again strongly urge the ROC to 
be as assertive as possible in instructing the 
Monchegorsk to dock in Cyprus, so a thorough inspection 
of the cargo can take place. 
 
-- However, if the ship arrives in Syria, without the 
ROC's best efforts to support the relevant UNSCRs, the 
USG would not be able to portray the ROC's actions in 
the most positive light. As UNSCR 1747 makes clear in 
para 5, "States shall prohibit the procurement of such 
items from Iran by their nationals, or using their flag 
vessels or aircraft, and whether or not originating in 
the territory of Iran. 
 
--The USG remains willing to assist in any way possible. 
 
End Points 
 
¶5. (S/REL CYPRUS) The following points may also be 
reiterated at Post's discretion.  These points are drawn 
from Ref. B. 
 
Begin Points 
 
--Under Article 41 of the UN Charter, the Security 
Council may decide what measures are to be employed to 
give effect to its decisions and it may call upon Member 
States to apply such measures.  Under Article 25 of the 
Charter, UN member states have agreed to accept and 
carry out the Council's decisions in accordance with the 
Charter. 
 
--Under operative paragraph 5 of UNSCR 1747, unanimously 
adopted under Article 41, the Security Council decided 
that: 
 
-Iran shall not supply, sell or transfer directly 
or indirectly from its territory? any arms or 
related materiel; and 
 
-all states shall prohibit the procurement of such 
items from Iran? using their flag vessels or 
aircraft. 
 
-The Cypriot-flagged vessel M/V MONCHEGORSK is carrying 
Iranian-origin arms-related military cargo to Syria. 
 
-An inspection conducted by a US Navy ship on January 19 
and 20 revealed containers carrying 120 mm, 122 mm, 125 
mm, and 160 mm high explosives that originated in Iran 
and are destined for Syria.  Inspection also revealed 
7.62 mm shell casings, compressed gunpowder, silver 
dollar-sized slugs, primer, and magnesium primers. 
 
-Consequently, Cyprus has an obligation to prevent the 
use of the M/V MONCHEGORSK - a Cypriot-flagged vessel -- 
from participating in this transaction. 
 
-In addition, Operative Paragraph 11 of UNSCR 1803 calls 
upon states to inspect cargoes to and from Iran, of 
aircraft and vessels, at their airports and seaports, 
owned or operated by Iran Air Cargo and Islamic Republic 
of Iran Shipping Line, provided there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that the aircraft or vessel is 
transporting prohibited goods. 
 
-It is extremely important that Cyprus take positive 
action to stop this shipment in order to protect the 
integrity and sound reputation of its ship registry.
