¶1. NAME AND DPOB: Marcelo Fabian Aldas 
 
 
 
¶2. DPOB: September 23, 1943; Carchi, Ecuador 
 
 
 
¶3. PASSPORT DATA: 016421071 issued on February 29, 2000; Full 
Validity 
 
 
 
¶4. PERSONS TO CONTACT: Carmela Burbano, wife,  703-431-8090 
 
 
 
¶5. POST ACTION TO DATE:  ConOff has extensively liaised with Mr. 
Aldas' sisters and wife, as well as with the hospital and clinic 
where Mr. Aldas has been treated, to monitor this elderly AmCit's 
medical condition. Due to long-standing disagreement between Aldas' 
relatives, ConOff and FBU representative have visited elder care 
facilities in the Quito area to assess suitability for Aldas.  When 
no affordable alternative was encountered, ACS Quito reached out to 
OCS for further assistance locating a facility in the United States 
(preferably near his wife's residence in Northern Virginia). ConOff 
has continued attempts to resolve complications with the payment of 
Social Security benefits. 
 
 
 
¶6. PRIVACY ACT AUTHORIZATION: Aldas was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 
disease in 2001 and is not in a mental state to give consent. At 
this time, next-of-kin Carmela Burbano has legal authority to make 
decisions on his behalf. 
 
 
 
¶7. ASSISTANCE REQUIRED: Post requests that the Department 
coordinate with HHS/ISS to locate an elder care facility that 
provides 24 hour care. Specific HHS assistance detailed in 
paragraph 9. 
 
 
 
¶8. RETURN PLANS: As soon as possible. 
 
 
 
¶9. HHS ASSISTANCE: U.S. Embassy in Quito requests the assistance of 
HHS for placement in a care facility in the United States near Mr. 
Aldas' family in the Northern Virginia Area.  Upon location of a 
facility, the Embassy will coordinate his repatriation to the 
United States with medical escort. The Embassy also requests that 
HHS provide a medical escort between U.S. gateway (Miami) and final 
destination (Washington, DC area).  Upon arrival in the U.S., Aldas 
and a medical escort should be met by ISS and taken to final 
destination.

Fairfax, VA.

¶13. OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Aldas' wife, Carmela Burbano, was 
previously the representative payee of his monthly Social Security 
 
payments totaling $915. However, due to an unapproved change in 
representative payees, Aldas' benefits are currently on hold and 
not being paid to anyone. Aldas also maintains Blue Cross/Blue 
Shield Medical Insurance. Aldas is currently receiving care at the 
Hermanas Hospitalarias del Sagrado CorazCHermanas Hospitalarias del Sagrado CorazC 
 
¶24. A family feud between Aldas' siblings and his wife has been 
apparent throughout the Consulate's interaction with the interested 
parties. The siblings do not agree for their brother to be placed 
in a certain care facilities and have taken it upon themselves to 
relocate him to Clinica Guadalupe, but have not provided payment to 
the facility. 
 
 
 
¶25. Aldas' wife, who has legal authority to make decisions on his 
behalf, has stated that she cannot pay out of pocket for the more 
expensive clinics. Medicare does not cover medical expenses in 
Ecuador. Burbano has expressed her desire for Aldas to be 
repatriated to the U.S. and placed in a care facility that can be 
covered by Social Security payment. However, on February 8, the 
Consular Section learned that Aldas' sister, Rosa Sheta, based in 
the U.S. was named representative payee. Since she is not 
physically located in the same country as Aldas, payments have been 
indefinitely suspended.
