REF: STATE 41768 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to the Swine Flu outbreak in Mexico and 
cases in the U.S. and other countries, on April 26 Hong Kong 
raised its 3-tier pandemic response level from Tier-1, 
"Alert", to Tier-2, "Serious".  Hong Kong's move is 
precautionary and follows established protocols. There have 
been no reported or suspected cases of Swine Flu in Hong Kong 
to date. This response-level change provides the legal basis 
for increased health screenings at ports-of-entry and 
additional authority to quarantine arriving passengers with 
an identifiable fever or exhibiting flu-like symptoms.  The 
government has also issued a health advisory suggesting that 
individuals planning travel to areas of known Swine Flu 
activity consider altering their travel plans and 
recommending, if they do travel, passengers take precautions 
to lessen the risk of exposure.  As of April 27, 
HKG-identified locations of Swine Flu concern include Mexico, 
California, Kansas, Texas, New York, Ohio, and the Canadian 
Provinces of Nova Scotia and British Columbia. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Responding to Department guidance (REFTEL) and the 
HKG pandemic influenza response level change, Post's Avian 
Influenza Working Group (AIWG) met on April 27 to review 
pandemic influenza tripwires and discuss additional possible 
courses of action.  All Post preparations, including 
recommended levels of medical supplies, were in order. Post 
has sent out notices to both Consulate General staff and the 
AMCIT community informing them of the HKG decision to upgrade 
the response level, precautions to take, and where to go for 
official updates and authoritative information.  Post has 
reached out to contacts in the HKG and Hong Kong's medical 
community and continues to actively monitor the situation.
