¶1. As requested Ref A, Yekaterinburg Pol/Econ officer asked 
Vasiliy Volovod the questions in para 4.  His answers (keyed to 
the questions) were: 
 
--End users of the ammunition are:

Dmitriy Terentiev 
Andrei Lebedev 
Andrei Kochegarov 
Vyacheslav Skulin

--The previous order dealt with Berger bullets.  Now we are 
ordering Hornady and Sierra bullets produced by different 
manufacturers. 
 
--Each shooter uses about 200-300 rounds of ammunition per 
month.  A team uses about 2,000 rounds of ammunition monthly. 
The license is valid for several years and the bullets will be 
used within this period of time. 
 
--The bullets will not be re-sold or used for commercial 
purposes. 
 
--All bullets will be used domestically in Russia strictly for 
sport shooting and hunting.  They will not be used for any other 
purposes.  They will not be re-exported. 
 
--I am aware of the prohibition against unauthorized re-export 
of US-origin defense articles.  I treat those laws with respect. 
 
¶2. A check with Russian authorities indicates that Volovod does 
have authorization to import ammunition and/or ammunition 
components and provide them to other individuals in Russia. 
 
¶3. Post notes that both target shooting and hunting are popular 
sports in this region of Russia.  If you have further questions, 
please contact Pol/Econ officer Carol Trimble 
(trimblec.a.state.gov).
