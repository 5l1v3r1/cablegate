SUBJECT: BRAZIL: DEMARCHE ON LEGACY PILOTS DELIVERED 

REF: STATE 186511 

Classified By: Classified by CG Simon Henshaw, reasons 1.5 b and d 

¶1. (U) CG Henshaw delivered demarche per reftel instructions to Ministry of External Relations Director for the Department of Brazilian Overseas Communities, Ambassador Manoel Gomes Pereira on November 18. 

¶2. (C) Ambassador Pereira said that he would pass our concerns to the appellate court reviewing the pilots' request to be allowed to depart Brazil. He said he would do so orally, as he feared formal written communication may produce a backlash against the pilots. He said he would reply to our demarche as soon as possible.
