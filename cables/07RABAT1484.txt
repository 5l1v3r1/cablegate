RESPONSE 
 
REF: A. STATE 128336 
     ¶B. STATE 080345 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff first discussed the points conveyed reftels 
during a June 15 meeting with Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Division Chief for International Organizations Ahmed Faouzi, 
urging the Government of Morocco to support holding the WIPO 
Director General accountable for his actions and abuses.  At 
that time, Faouzi was guarded in his remarks, but speculated 
that it would be difficult garnishing support for the 
resignation of the Director General without also recommending 
another African replacement.  Faouzi pledged to pass the 
information and U.S. position to Morocco's ambassador to its 
permanent mission in Geneva, Mohammed Loulichki. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a follow-up conversation on September 18, Faouzi 
was again noncommittal in his country's position, reiterating 
that it was an issue that would be handled and decided by 
Ambassador Loulichki.
