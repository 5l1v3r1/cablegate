SUBJECT: U.S.-RUSSIA AGREEMENT FOR PEACEFUL NUCLEAR 
COOPERATION 
 
¶1.  The President has approved the proposed Agreement Between 
the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Russia Federation Concerning Cooperation in 
the Field of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and has 
authorized its execution (P.D. 2008-19 dated 5 May 2008).  A 
copy of the Presidential Determination was faxed to Post CC 
Colin Cleary. 
 
¶2.  Accordingly, Ambassador (or Charge) is authorized to sign 
the Agreement on behalf of the United States. 
 
¶3.  Department has prepared the two English language texts 
(see 11 FAM 730.4) for signature.  The texts are identical 
except for reflecting the principle of the Alternat (see FAM 
730.5).  These texts have already been e-mailed to post.  It 
is our understanding that the GOR will be preparing the two 
Russian-language texts for signature, likewise reflecting the 
principle of the Alternat.  (Note:  Department's Language 
Services has compared the Russian and English language texts 
and certified on April 21, 2008 that they have the same 
meaning in all substantive respects but one, which was 
subsequently resolved.) 
 
¶4.  Following signature, the signed USG's original in the 
English and Russian languages should be sent to Department by 
fastest available means (via e-mailed .pdf-scanned file, and, 
if possible, hand-carried).  Originals should be delivered to 
L/T (Room 5420 HST), with copies to ISN/NESS, attention John 
Dooley (Room 3320 HST).  Embassy should also retain copies as 
backup.  Department will thereafter consider appropriate 
timing for submission to Congress for the statutory review 
period of ninety (90) days of continuous session.  At the end 
of the review period, absent enactment of legislation to 
disapprove the Agreement, it may be brought into force by an 
exchange of diplomatic notes signifying that the two sides 
have completed their respective internal procedures (see 
Article 20(1) of the Agreement).
