Key stories in the media:

Israel Radio reported that Hams has handed over to Israel a recent 
video recording of Gilad Shalit in exchange for the release by 
Israel of 20 female Palestinian prisoners, and that IDF Chief of 
Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi has viewed the cassette.  HaQaretz 
reported that the German mediator looked at the cassette and 
reported that Shalit is alive and well.  The media reported that 
Israel will release an extra woman prisoner, since one of those of 
the list was already released on Wednesday as her term was up. 
 
Leading media reported that last night the PA agreed to delay until 
March a vote set for today at the U.N Human Rights Council that 
would have endorsed the Goldstone Report.  Endorsement would have 
opened the door for the U.S. Security Council to bring Israelis 
before the International Criminal Court at The Hague for prosecution 
Goldstone crisis averted until March.  HaQaretz quoted an Israeli 
official as saying that the decision appears to be the results of 
pressure exerted by way of U.S. representatives in Geneva, as well 
as through contacts between Washington and Ramallah.   The Obama 
administration has reportedly told the Palestinians that a renewal 
of the peace process must come before any diplomatic initiatives 
based on the Goldstone report, or any other initiatives that could 
stifle efforts to renew Israel-PA negotiations.  HaQaretz quoted an 
Israeli official as saying that this position was coordinated with 
Israel.  HaQaretz quoted a source as saying that the Palestinian 
decision not to push the report was Qproof that Israel was right not 
to cooperate with the commissionQs investigation and that it was a 
political tool that can be blocked through diplomatic activity. 
Yediot reported that Israel clarified to the U.S. that the 
Palestinian proposal will harm the pace process.  Yediot quoted 
Israeli diplomatic sources as saying that the Palestinians have a 
lot to lose.  Israel Radio quoted Israel's Ambassador to the U.N. 
institutions in Geneva, Aharon Leshno-Yaar, as saying that he 
received a phone call from a Palestinian diplomat who told him that 
the purpose of the Palestinian decision was to prevent harm to the 
peace process. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that PM Netanyahu directed the Defense, 
Justice, and Foreign Ministers at yesterdayQs cabinet meeting to 
present him with proposals, by next week, on how to fight what he 
called the delegimitization of Israel that goes beyond the Goldstone 
Commission Report.  The newspaper also reported that the IDF Judge 
Advocate-General will transfer the findings from the various IDF 
inquiries into Operation Cast Lead to Attorney-General Menachem 
Mazuz for a final decision on whether to press charges against 
soldiers. 
 
HaQaretz reported that yesterday FM Avigdor Lieberman met with the 
foreign ministers of 15 different countries, and asked them to 
support efforts to counter the Goldstone Report.  In a conversation 
with foreign ministers from Brazil, Russia, and the European Union 
among others, Lieberman warned that the report is a dangerous 
development that could threaten the ability of democracies to defend 
themselves.  "This is only the first step," Lieberman was quoted as 
saying, adding, "the next step will be similar efforts against NATO 
forces in Afghanistan and Russian forces in Chechnya. 
 
Leading media reported that yesterday President Obama presented an 
ultimatum to Iran, saying that it must allow inspectors into its 
nuclear reactor near Qom within two weeks.  Maariv cited Qcautious 
optimismQ at the seven-party talks in Geneva.  Senior Netanyahu 
adviser and former Pensioner Affairs Minister Rafi Eitan was quoted 
as saying in an interview with Maariv that President Obama has 
understood from the Iranian reaction that the Islamic Republic is 
cheating on him and that his previous approach has failed.  Eitan 
added that he believes that IsraelQs current government will not 
attack Iran and that efforts should be made to handle the Iranian 
regime, not the Iran bomb. 
 
Maariv cited the Israeli defense establishmentQs concern that Hamas 
may be bracing for a new round of fighting with Israel.  Hamas is 
placing trailers and reportedly settling civilians a few hundred 
meters from the Gaza-Israel border in order to dig tunnel under the 
trailers. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that former DM Shaul Mofaz called on PM 
Netanyahu to build in the controversial E-1 area between Jerusalem 
and MaQaleh Adumim, despite American opposition.  He was visiting 
the side yesterday. 
 
Leading media reported that President Shimon Peres told visiting 
Russian Deputy PM Victor Zubov that Iran must stop threatening 
Israel that, like any other country, has to utilize its right to 
remain alive. 
 
HaQaretz reported that the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee 
acclaimed the success of a general strike held earlier in the day in 
Arab communities across Israel to mark the anniversary of the 
October 2000 riots.  Knesset Member Mohammad Barakeh (Hadash) 
praised the strike, saying the work stoppage "sends a clear message 
to the Government and to the arbiters of the racist Israeli policies 
that have been carried out for decades."  According to Barakeh, 
Israel's "disgraceful" polices toward the Arab public "will lead to 
the explosion of the Arab sector."  Barakeh warned that the strike 
was only the first in a series of protest actions planned by the 
Arab public.  Following smaller events in towns where people were 
killed, the strike's main event was a march through Arabeh in the 
Galilee to the town cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony, where 
Barakeh and other Knesset members spoke before thousands. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Argentina's former president Carlos Menem 
was charged Thursday with obstructing a probe into the 1994 bombing 
of a building housing Jewish charities in Argentina that killed 85 
people.  The radio said that Menem faces up to 25 years 
imprisonment. 
 
Yediot (Ronen Bergman) reported that it was not a conspiracy that 
led the Israeli Embassy to abandon Jonathan Pollard outside its 
gates, that successive Israeli governments were really active in 
promoting his release, but that they did not succeed in part due to 
mistakes made during the campaign. 
 
The media reported that yesterday the Tel Aviv District Court 
indicted business tycoon Arkady Gaidamak and several senior Bank 
Hapoalim officials for laundering money through the bank and 
defrauding it of 650 million shekels (around $160 million).  Media 
reported that Gaidamak announced yesterday he would return to Israel 
following the indictment. 
 
Maariv reported that the Transportation Ministry has authorized 
imports of U.S.-made Tesla Roadster automobiles -- for testing 
purposes. 
 
HaQaretz (English Ed.) reported that Israelis seeking compensation 
from American businessman Abraham Enden from New York, suspected of 
real estate fraud, complained this week that police are not doing 
enough to investigate allegations against the man, who is implicated 
in forgery, withholding payment and libel.  Complainants were quoted 
as saying that despite numerous fraud complaints and lawsuits in 
civil court against him, Enden visited Israel this week, without 
being called in for questioning.

¶I.  "Only an External Probe Will Do" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (10/2): QPrime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak oppose 
an external investigation into the events of Cast Lead, viewing this 
as a no-confidence vote in the army and its probes.  Instead of 
examining whether there is any justice to Goldstone's accusations, 
they are waging a diplomatic battle against him.  But they are 
wrong.  Only a commission whose members are not appointed by the 
government will be trusted both at home and abroad.  A governmental 
inquiry committee, or any other body whose members are appointed by 
the premier or defense minister, will not enjoy the necessary degree 
of local and international confidence, even if it is granted real 
investigative powers.  Only a state commission of inquiry headed by 
a jurist with an international reputation can address the Goldstone 
report with the requisite seriousness, clarify the suspicions of war 
crimes and lay down rules for the future.  The Government must 
authorize the establishment of such a commission, thereby 
demonstrating that it has nothing to hide and no one to protect. 
 
II.  "Signs of Life" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (10/2): 
QThe onus has always been on kidnappers to prove that their hostages 
are alive and well.  Yet this week, the Government of Benjamin 
Netanyahu paid Hamas to do just that. While paying Hamas's price 
will end the Shalit family's ordeal, it will also have two perilous 
repercussions: some of Hamas's most able QengineersQ and tacticians 
will resume their careers; and the movement's standing within the 
Palestinian polity -- and in the international arena -- will further 
E 
solidify.  Palestinians assert that Israel is holding 9,000 
prisoners.  If one Israeli soldier can buy 1,000 prisoners, how many 
will it take to deliver the other 8,000?  From Hamas's vantage 
point, all this could not come at a better time.  The Islamists, 
under Egyptian auspices, may soon sign a Qnational unityQ pact with 
Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah, paving the way for West Bank and Gaza 
elections in 2010.  Hamas will then reasonably campaign as the 
QresistanceQ faction that can QdeliverQ Israeli concessions. Much 
as we Israelis welcome a sign of life from the soldier whose fate is 
so much in our hearts, it is the Government's duty to pursue his 
freedom mindful of the many other lives at stake down the road. 
 
III.  "Wage a Legal War" 
 
The nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe editorialized (10/2): 
QDespite all the justified considerations against the establishment 
of a commission of inquiry [into the events of Operation Cast Lead]. 
It should not be ruled out.  The main rationale in favor of it is 
strategic.  On the basic legal level ... an Israel commission of 
inquiry will earn the trust of at least IsraelQs friends and further 
international factors that have confidence in IsraelQs legal system. 
 Such confidence is highly significant.  Moreover, the international 
legal arena has become our national radar for vital strategic 
threats.

¶I.  "Just DonQt Go It Alone" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz (10/2): QAs an outstanding 
orator, Bibi did a good job [at the U.N.] in getting the sane 
countries to focus on Iran.  Whether he is made of the leadership 
material to drag the country into an independent military operation 
against Iran is a pointless question.  Iran is a threat to the sane 
world. Europe, the Arab states and Obama, as the leader of the 
world, have a problem.  We must not isolate ourselves from the whole 
world, but operate as part of the international community, and not 
by any means go it alone. 
 
II.  "Is Obama a Mollusk?" 
 
Columnist Shmuel Rosner, who was HaQaretzQs correspondent in 
Washington, wrote in the popular, pluralist Maariv (10/2): Q[Akin to 
some American intellectuals], very high-ranking sources in the 
Israeli Government  believe that last summer, at the time of the 
disturbances in Iran, Obama missed a golden opportunity to undermine 
the AyatollahsQ regime.  But the Obama administration no longer 
considers this option.... [Anyway] nothing good came for the 
administration from the dialogue [with Iran].  This week it turned 
out that even the U.S. Jews -- who are among the PresidentQs most 
faithful and devoted supporters Q are worried. 
 
III.  "Put Limits to Iran" 
 
Geneva correspondent Nadav Eyal wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv (10/2): QAt last weekQs dramatic press conference in 
Pittsburgh, when the United States, Britain, and France announced 
the uncovering of the nuclear installation near Qom, President Obama 
took care not to present Iran with timed ultimatums.  But the French 
President was unambiguous and strong-minded.... There was a single 
disastrous blow that caused the Europeans to distaste Iran -- the 
recent elections there.... For the first time since the [Islamic] 
Revolution, EuropeQs political and public institutions viewed the 
Iranian regime as almost illegitimate.
