REF: STATE 76746 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel requests, AIT/T contacted Taiwan Air Force and 
the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC). 
Investigation results showed that these two business orders came 
from AIDC, and the reason for going through New Zealand-based 
company was because it served as a broker. 
 
¶2. All spare parts mentioned in reftel went to AIDC who is 
responsible for maintenance of military aircraft. 
 
Case 05-050095335 
----------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Major Lee from Air Force Logistics Command confirmed this 
order and suggested AIT/T contact AIDC's Aircraft Maintenance and 
Avionics Office for details.  Ms. Wu from this office echoed Major 
Lee's remarks, and further explained that AIDC ordered 17 pieces of 
SHIM.  They already received 13 pieces, and are expecting the rest 
shortly. 
 
¶4. Ms. Wu said that AIDC could only get this specific SHIM from New 
Zealand's Customs Aeronautical Solutions (CAS). 
 
Case 05-050097129 
----------------- 
¶5. (SBU) AIDC Procurement Manager Hsu explained that AIDC started 
the procurement of subject spare parts for military two and half 
years ago.   It is a four-year procurement contract with several 
shipments. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Hsu further explained that AIDC went through many agents to 
gather required spare parts.   Most agents in the U.S. could find 
those commodities in the subject exporter, S.O.I. Aviation.   But 
there were some parts that AIDC could only find at CAS.  Therefore, 
AIDC gets 90 percent of needed spare parts from S.O.I. Aviation, and 
the rest from CAS.  AIDC started to do business with CAS about one 
year ago.
