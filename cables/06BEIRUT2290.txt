SUBJECT: MGLE01:  FORMER PRESIDENT ELIAS HRAWI PASSES AWAY 
ON JULY 7 
 
REF: BEIRUT 2174 
 
¶1.  At about 3:00 PM local on July 7, former Lebanese 
President Elias Hrawi passed away from cancer.  Reftel 
describes in detail the record and legacy of President Hrawi, 
who served in office from 1989 to 1998. 
 
¶2.  With Hrawi's death occurring only a few hours ago, 
funeral arrangements are still being worked out by the Hrawi 
family.  The funeral will most likely take place on Sunday, 
July 9.  While there will be a series of condolence events, 
we do not expect the government to close for a day of 
mourning. 
 
¶3.  Embassy recommends the prompt issuance of condolence 
messages along the lines suggested paras 17-18, reftel.  The 
Ambassador spoke with Hrawi's widow, Mona, on the afternoon 
of July 7 to convey sympathies.
