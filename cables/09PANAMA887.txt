USG-GOP Security Dialogues 
 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  This cable is a response to ref A. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (C//NF)  As Panama has no military, there are no formal POL-MIL 
or MIL-MIL dialogues between the GOP and the USG. Our robust 
security cooperation is coordinated through high level meetings 
between the Ambassador and various senior GOP officials, including 
the President, Vice-President/Foreign Minister, the Minister of 
Government and Justice (MOGJ), and the Minister of the Presidency 
(MINPRES).  There has been a recent attempt to formalize a 
bi-weekly meeting of the Ambassador, DCM, and Pol/Security officer 
(POL/MIL, without the Military) and the VP/FM, MOGJ, and the 
MINPRES. There has been one meeting so far, so it is unclear if 
this format will solidify. If so, this meeting could become a vital 
tool for coordinating with a government that has enormous problems 
collaborating internally. Some issues will need to be taken to an 
even larger group, including the security service chiefs, to make 
sure everyone is on the same page. There is also a deep and wide 
working level collaboration, including almost daily law-enforcement 
and intel cooperation among several USG agencies and their GOP 
counterparts. 
 
 
 
Maritime Counter-Narcotics Coordination 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The GOP and the USCG recently held their second 
bilateral meeting on the implementation of the Salas-Becker 
Agreement, which details the rules for cooperation between the USCG 
and the Panamanian National Aero-Naval Service (SENAN) on 
counter-narcotics operations. It was agreed at this meeting that 
these meetings will become annual, as was stipulated in the SBA 
agreement but never carried out before this series of meetings. The 
meetings have been very useful, establishing a mechanism for 
clarifying misunderstandings, and bringing all members of the GOP 
involved in maritime counter-narcotics work together with their 
Embassy and USCG colleagues to establish effective SOPs. 
 
 
 
Darien Coordination 
 
 
 
¶4.  (C)  Post has also established a dialogue with the GOP on the 
implementation of the USG/GOP Darien strategy, which is being 
partially funded by 1207 funds. This dialogue has mostly been with 
officials from the Ministry of the Presidency, who are in charge of 
coordinating the civilian "all of government" approach for the GOP 
on the joint strategy, designed to deny the FARC safehaven in the 
Darien. Coordination of the security aspects of this strategy have 
taken place at the meetings described in paragraph one. 
 
 
 
Assessment 
 
 
 
¶5.  (C//NF)  The Embassy is highly involved in Panamanian security 
affairs, and frequently acts as the GOP's strategic planning and 
 
analysis arm, due to the lack of security expertise within the GOP. 
The GOP now consistently briefs visiting delegations the exact 
analysis of the security situation in Panama that Post's LESWG 
briefed to the incoming government on June 23 (ref B). The 
Embassy's forward leaning position on security has been necessary 
because the GOP does not have great bandwidth on security issues, 
but faces a grave crisis as narco-trafficking skyrockets, and crime 
rates and gang activity climb at alarming rates. This creates a 
situation where the Embassy makes bold strategic and tactical 
proposals, that often end up getting diluted and/or modified as the 
GOP attempts to execute. The Embassy's proposal for the GOP to send 
two interceptor boats and 20 men to Puerto Pinas, on the Darien 
Pacific coast, to work with JIATF-S assets in the area to cut the 
littoral drug-trafficking route is a case in point. The idea was to 
create a strong presence in one critical area, which was key to 
FARC drug trafficking, rather than dispersing limited assets 
through Panama's territorial waters. After two months of inaction, 
the idea evolved into a proposal to create 11 naval stations - 
which will severely tax Panama's limited personnel, equipment and 
logistical capability. The Joint Task Force that was part of the 
proposal may yet prove to be effective - showing why coordinating 
security strategy with the GOP is worthwhile, though not always 
easy. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (C)  This problem is the result of a weak leadership structure 
within the GOP, where the President makes strong impulsive 
decisions with minimal information, Ministers and security leaders 
do not share information or coordinate actions, and there is no 
middle level security bureaucracy to plan, evaluate or execute 
strategies. Nevertheless, Panama is critical to U.S. national 
security, and the Embassy will remain heavily engaged in this 
issue. Critical to our success so far has been the tight 
coordination among all Country Team members, leading to coherent 
proposals that have inter-agency support. It is Post's evaluation 
that our security dialogue  is vibrant and essential, but that 
implementation will continue to be a challenge.
