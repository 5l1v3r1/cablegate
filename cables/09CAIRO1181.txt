SUBJECT: NDP INSIDER PRESSING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS 
 
REF: A. CAIRO 1059 B. CAIRO 814 C. 08 CAIRO 2405 D. 04 CAIRO 1708 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor William R. Stewart for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
1.(C) XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that the GOE is "responding positively" to XXXXXXXXXXXX recommendation XXXXXXXXXXXX to abolish prison sentences for journalists from the penal code, as President Mubarak pledged in 2004 (refs B and D). XXXXXXXXXXXX said he is working with the GOE on legislation to close legal loopholes that enable lawsuits restricting free expression. Per ref C, citizens affiliated with the NDP have successfully filed suits resulting in fines against journalists for insulting government figures. XXXXXXXXXXXX noted he is "working with the GOE on bloggers," and that the NCHR wants "the bloggers out of jail." He said President Mubarak wants uniform regulations for constructing mosques and churches that would give him the power to intervene to ensure fairness.

2.(C) XXXXXXXXXXXX. (C) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXXX appears serious about pushing for these reforms and XXXXXXXXXXXX is well positioned to do so. However, conservatives in the Interior Ministry and in the NDP's upper echelon will probably be resistant to many of these reforms. The outcome of this process could provide insight into the influence of the reform-minded NDP officials close to Gamal Mubarak. We will continue to press the GOE for progress on democracy and governance issues. SCOBEY
