ESTHOFF passed reftel points May 9 to Health Ministry Deputy 
Director General for International Affairs Jose Perez Lazaro, 
urging Spain to support the unrestricted sharing of pandemic 
influenza virus samples and increased access to influenza 
vaccines, while opposing any date-certain for destruction of 
authorized smallpox virus stocks.  Perez Lazaro told ESTHOFF 
May 14 that Spain had not yet determined its position 
regarding the sharing of influenza virus samples, but 
believed that the developed world needed to "guarantee 
developing world access to influenza vaccines at accessible 
prices."  Regarding the smallpox virus stocks issue, Perez 
Lazaro said that Spain supported the U.S. position against 
any date-certain destruction of authorized smallpox virus 
stocks.
