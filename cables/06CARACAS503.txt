REF: A) STATE 21256 B) STATE 27174 C) CARACAS 00492 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Third Secretary for 
Multilateral Affairs Aldo Perfetto had no substantive 
response to ref A regarding the US government's conditions 
for providing future financial assistance to the new 
Palestinian Authority government.  Perfetto agreed, however, 
to pass talking points to Vice Minister for North America 
Maria Pilar Hernandez for further consideration. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Separately, Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel 
commented February 13 that the BRV would be open to receiving 
members from the Hamas movement and Islamic militant groups 
if they visited Venezuela during a tour of several South 
American countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. 
As noted in ref C, however, government officials have 
stressed privately that the BRV has not extended any official 
invitations for these groups to visit.
