GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT 
 
REF: TAIPEI 03782 
 
 ¶1.   SUMMARY.  Eight months into his term as Academia Sinica 
President, Wong Chi-huey is concerned about the inability of 
Taiwan to attract research talent from overseas and the 
disconnect between research and the legal infrastructure that 
is stifling development of Taiwan's scientific potential.  He 
said Taiwan's two main high-tech advantages, biotech and 
digital display need a boost in order to be competitive in 
today's world.  Academia Sinica has a wealth of areas that 
could be shared with the rest of the world, notably history, 
the Chinese classics, biotech research but lately much of the 
organizations' focus has been local, not international.  A 
legal framework and government policies more in tune with the 
academic world would be necessary to encourage a more global 
engagement.  Wong is working to identify areas within 
Academia Sinica that would benefit from such an approach. 
END SUMMARY 
 
REVERSING BRAIN DRAIN 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  AIT ESTH officer called on Academia Sinica President Wong 
Chi-huey on May 10.  Since Wong took over from Lee Yuan-tseh 
a little over eight months ago, he has carefully crafted a 
new image at Academia Sinica.  Gone are the occasional 
comments on the political scene that sometimes bedeviled his 
predecessor.  Instead, Wong is focused on reversing the brain 
drain which he sees as a serious problem for Taiwan's 
scientific community.  Wong said Taiwan suffers from one of 
the highest rates of non-return for students going overseas: 
78 percent versus 22 percent for the PRC and 2 percent for 
Japan.  He says Taiwan's poor academic and political 
environment does not attract potential returnees after their 
studies overseas.  Wong also noted that research at 
institutions for higher learning was hurt by the small 
science budget allocated to them.   He said Academia Sinica 
takes 10 percent of the central science budget, far higher 
than for universities.  Wong is seeking to transfer some of 
that budget to the universities. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENCOURAGE BIOTECH DEVELOPMENT 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4.  Wong believes that Taiwan's future science potential lies 
in biotechnology and information technology.  Citing 
biotechnology as one area where Taiwan has potential but 
lacks both the right incentives and legal framework to 
encourage development, Wong said the government sees only 
short-term gains but not long-term potential.  A case in 
point is the low value the market places on stocks from 
companies that have long-lead times developing new products, 
such as biotech and drug companies.  The market favors 
companies with short lead times such as the electronics 
industry according to Wong.  In order to encourage R&D, IPR 
protection needs to be strengthened, because without legal 
protection, nascent knowledge-based industries will not have 
a chance to survive.  He criticized the top-down policy 
approach of the bureaucracy which enacts regulations without 
considering the opinions of academia or society.  One example 
he cited is the government's policy on carbon dioxide 
emissions.  It has set no target on CO2 emissions and has not 
consulted researchers in academia to formulate a sound 
policy.  Instead it continues to enact half-way measures to 
placate industry.  Educating policy makers to coordinate 
policy with academic experts will take time and effort said 
Wong, suggesting holding symposiums to bring bureaucrats and 
researchers and NGOs together. 
 
STRONG HUMANITIES POTENTIAL 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Wong cited Academia Sinica's strong humanities research 
particularly in the area of Chinese history.  He mentioned 
that Ming-Ching history (14th-19th century AD) is the 
academy's forte, recognized even by PRC academics.  Taiwan's 
edge in this field is strengthened because it continues to 
use traditional characters (compatible with old historical 
texts) which allows researchers greater comprehension. 
Because of growing international interest in Chinese history 
and culture, he cited the digitization of the Palace Museum's 
archives as an example of how Taiwan's wealth of archival 
material (historical and cultural) could be disseminated 
around the world.  While ESTH officer spoke with him, Wong 
introduced a representative of the publishing industry who 
was preparing a digital encyclopedia of Taiwan (Note: this

project is being chaired by Wong's predecessor Lee Yuan-tseh. 
 End Note). 
 
A GLOBAL VIEW VERSUS LOCAL FOCUS 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Wong lamented that the academic world in Taiwan is too 
focused on its own backyard and lacks a global view.  One way 
to become more engaged globally was to participate in joint 
research projects with other countries.  He was hopeful that 
Academia Sinica could consider funding from overseas 
organizations as a means to expand the scope of its research. 
 He recently obtained a $10 million grant from the Bill Gates 
Foundation for an AIDS vaccine research project and hoped to 
build more partnerships with U.S. institutions.  However, 
with decreasing numbers of foreign-trained scientists 
returning to Taiwan, Wong felt the valuable connections and 
global view that are so important for the research community 
here would gradually be lost and be focused locally. 
 
NO COMPROMISE ON TAIWAN'S IDENTITY 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  In closing, Wong complained that the PRC continues to 
pressure organizers of scientific conferences to label 
Taiwan's academic contributions under the term "Taiwan, 
China."  He said that Taiwan's participation in the global 
scientific community should not be subject to the dictates of 
the PRC. 
(Note: Wong's comment comes as the PRC pushes for a 
resolution at the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) 
meetings to change Taiwan's name from the current term 
"Taipei China" to "Taiwan, China."  End Note.)
