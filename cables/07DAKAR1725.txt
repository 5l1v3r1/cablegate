the current investment in an auto and truck assembly plant by 
Iranian automaker Khodro.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MORE PROMISES 
------------- 
¶2.  (U) During a July 28-29 visit to Dakar, Senior Iranian officials 
Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Sharoudi, Chief of the Judiciary of Iran 
and Mohamed Reza Baghrei, Special Envoy of President Ahmadinejad 
presented the Iranian goal of creating a new organization, the 
International Union of Islamic Countries, which Iran hopes to 
formally launch during the next Islamic Conference (OIC) Summit, 
scheduled to take place in Dakar in March 2008.  Sharoudi noted this 
union will allow Islamic countries to resist pressure from entities 
such as the European Union, "harmonize differences" in positions 
between Islamic countries, and "restore the great Islamic 
civilization."  Sharoudi also indicated Iran will hold an 
international meeting within four months to further the project, 
which he claims already has a Secretariat in place in Teheran and 
the backing of forty countries.  On judicial cooperation, Sharoudi 
noted Iran has harmoniously integrated Sharia Islamic Law into its 
legal system and could share Iran's experience with Senegal and 
other Muslim countries. 
 
¶3.  (U) President Wade, in giving his account of the meetings 
between his government and Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Sharoudi, Chief 
of the Judiciary of Iran and Mohamed Reza Baghrei, Special Envoy of 
President Ahmadinejad, directed his cabinet to prepare an 
Iran-Senegal cooperation committee as soon as possible.  According 
to local press, Wade stated Iranian authorities made the commitment 
to implement "all agreements signed with Senegal."  Wade asserted 
Iran will: 
 
-- accelerate the construction of the Khodro car assembly plant near 
Thies (historically a stronghold for opposition to Wade's ruling PDS 
party); 
 
-- construct a new petroleum refinery and a petrochemical plant in 
Senegal; 
 
-- host Senegalese experts to study Iran's agricultural system; 
 
-- build vocational schools in Senegal; 
 
-- assist Senegal in preparation for the upcoming OIC Summit, 
scheduled for March 2008 in Dakar; 
 
-- contribute USD 100 million to the IOC Solidarity Fund for the 
reduction of poverty; and 
 
-- in support of Wade's proposal to build a civilian nuclear power 
plant in the Casamance, provide scholarships to Senegalese students 
to specialize in nuclear physics. 
 
¶4.  (U) In June, Iran's Export Development Bank announced plans to 
front USD 40.6 million to Senegal's national power company (Senelec) 
for the construction of a power transmission line that will provide 
electricity to more than 200,000 people in the cities of Tobene, 
Touba, Tivaouane and Kaolack, as well as other upgrades to the 
country's electrical grid. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5.  (SBU) President Wade's grand plan to build a nuclear power plant 
is very much more likely dream than reality, although he could 
believe it enough to follow-up on Iran's offer to provide some 
degree of technical nuclear training to Senegalese citizens.  [Note: 
 as reported in reftel, French President Sarkozy also paid lip 
service to the possibility of assisting Senegal's "nuclear program." 
 End note.]  Since Wade's election in 2000, several official visits 
have been made by Iranian and Senegalese officials, including heads 
of state.  However, we have seen few indications of serious movement 
on the numerous economic agreements signed.  For instance, promises 
to upgrade Senelec have not yet materialized.  Over the past two 
 
DAKAR 00001725  002 OF 002 
 
 
years, Iran has certainly raised its profile as a potential 
development partner for Senegal, but it's not yet clear if the 
official visits and promises of cooperation will succeed in steering 
Senegal towards Iran's international objectives.
