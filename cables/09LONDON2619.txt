REF: SECSTATE 119211 
 
Poloff delivered reftel demarche to PSI POC Edward Evans, Missile Policy Desk Officer in the Counter-Proliferation Department at the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), on November 20.  Evans responded that while the FCO had a keen interest in attending the PSI Exercise LEADING EDGE, due to travel funding contraints it would most likely be unable to attend.  Evans said, however, that the UK would be sending three Customs experts to the LEADING EDGE.  Poloff left talking points and logistical information as non-paper per reftel, and Evans passed along the information to key PSI players within the UK government.
