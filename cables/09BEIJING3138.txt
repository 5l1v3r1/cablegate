SUBJECT: NOVEMBER 19 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: OPPOSITION TO JEWISH 
SETTLEMENTS, U.S. ENVOY VISIT TO NORTH KOREA, STRENGTHENING 
SINO-JAPANESE RELATIONS 
 
¶1.  Key points at the November 19 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- China opposes Israel's plans to build new Jewish 
settlements in East Jerusalem, viewing the move as likely to 
undermine trust and security in the region. 
 
-- The decision not to accept journalist questions following 
the meeting between President Obama and President Hu was 
reached by both countries. 
 
-- China supports the upcoming planned visit to North Korea of 
U.S. Special Envoy on North Korea Policy Stephen Bosworth and 
hopes that bilateral dialogue between the United States and 
North Korea will lead to the resumption of the Six Party Talks 
and to peace on the Korean peninsula. 
 
-- The Chinese Foreign Minister is on an official visit in 
Japan, and China believes that regular high-level visits 
between the two countries will advance the strategic Sino- 
Japanese relationship and enhance dialogue and coordination. 
 
Israeli Plans to Build New Jewish Settlements 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2.  Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Qin Gang noted at the 
November 19 regularly scheduled press briefing that China is 
concerned by Israel's recent approval of plans to build new 
Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem, adding that China 
opposes the plan and any other action that undermines trust 
and security in the region. 
 
No Questions Taken at Obama-Hu Press Conference 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3.  When asked why China was the only country in President 
Obama's trip to East Asia not to accept journalist questions 
following the meeting between the two countries' leaders, Qin 
explained that decisions regarding this and other aspects of 
the visit were reached by both countries.  Qin added that the 
presence of such a large number of journalists at the event 
was evidence that valuable information had been relayed even 
in the absence of opening the floor to questions. 
 
Hijacked Chinese Vessel 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  Regarding the Chinese-flagged vessel De Xin Hai, Qin noted 
that the Chinese government is making an "all-out effort" to 
rescue the ship with full consideration for the safety of the 
sailors.  Qin added that in the interests of the sailors and 
the Chinese effort to rescue them, he could provide no further 
details on the situation. 
 
Sino-Japanese Relations 
----------------------- 
 
¶5.  Qin confirmed that the Chinese Foreign Minister is on an 
official visit in Japan, though he would not confirm whether 
one purpose of this trip is to pave the way for a visit by 
President Hu Jintao.  Qin added that regular high-level visits 
between the two countries are designed to advance the 
strategic Sino-Japanese relationship and enhance dialogue and 
coordination and that, as neighbors, China hopes to 
continually strengthen bilateral relations with Japan. 
 
Land Border Issues 
------------------ 
 
¶6.  When asked about China's recent agreement with Vietnam on 
the two countries' land border -- and about China's ongoing 
disagreement with India over their shared border -- Qin noted 
that China's position is to resolve border disputes peacefully, 
being sure to analyze the effect on international relations. 
Qin noted that discussions with India on this topic are in 
progress as both sides look for an acceptable resolution. 
 
Talking about the Six Party Talks 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Qin noted that China supports the upcoming planned visit 
to North Korea of U.S. Special Envoy for North Korea Policy 
Stephen Bosworth, and that China hopes bilateral dialogue 
between the United States and North Korea will lead to the 
resumption of the Six Party Talks and to peace on the Korean

¶8.  Qin said he has no details regarding allegations that 
China Metallurgical Group had provided a USD 30 million bribe 
to Afghan Minister of Mines Mohammed Ibrahim Adel in late 2007 
in order to win a large copper mining contract in Logar 
province.   Qin added that China supports the Afghan 
government and efforts to improve the country's economic 
infrastructure, and that China wishes to congratulate Afghan 
President Hamid Karzai on his recent re-election.
