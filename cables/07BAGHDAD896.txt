SUBJECT:  Iraqi Kurdistan Region Media Summary -- 
      March 11, 2007 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is a Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT) cable. 
 
KRG Publishes Draft Federal Oil and Gas Law in English and Arabic 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2.  (U)  The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) spokesman published 
an authorized English translation of the draft Federal Oil and Gas 
Law of Iraq today.  The original Arabic draft, also published by the 
KRG today, was approved by the Oil and Energy Committee of the Iraq 
Council of Ministers.  The English translation published today was 
prepared and authorized by the KRG.  "These are the drafts which are 
recognized by the KRG," said KRG Natural Resources Minister Dr. 
Ashti Hawrami in a statement. "Old and inaccurate translations of 
this vital draft law have been circulating in the media in recent 
weeks.  By publishing the original Arabic and the authoritative 
English translation together, we hope to make the picture clearer 
for potential investors in Iraq."  Dr. Hawrami represents the KRG on 
the Oil and Energy Committee. 
 
Female Parliamentarians Propose Changes to KRG Personal Status Law 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3.  (U)  Newspapers reported that Women's Rights Protection 
Committee of the Kurdistan National Assembly is preparing to submit 
a proposed Bill of Rights that would make a number of changes to the 
KRG personal status code aimed at increased gender equality in the 
Kurdistan Region.  According to the committee, the proposed 
amendments are based on international agreements and Kurdish 
community standards and will maintain compliance with Islamic law. 
 
Byblos Bank plans Iraq expansion from Kurdish North 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4.  (U)  Major newspapers wrote that Byblos Bank, Lebanon's 
third-largest lender, will open a branch in Iraq next month using 
the safety of the Kurdish north as a platform for expansion into a 
country that holds 10% of the world's oil reserves.  "Iraq is very 
important, there is huge potential there," said Chairman Francois 
Bassil in an interview from his office in Beirut on March 6.  Byblos 
will open its branch in Erbil because the city is more secure than 
other parts of the country, he said. 
 
Shahid Khalid Hospital Opens in Koya 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U)  Newspapers reported on the opening of the Shahid Khalid 
hospital in Koya.  After 4 years of renovation the hospital now has 
8 labs, 2 large operation rooms, and an intensive care unit.  The 
hospital was opened in a ceremony led by the KRG Minister of Health 
who said that his ministry will try to send some of the hospital's 
doctors and staff abroad for training. 
 
Commentaries: 
------------- 
 
¶6.  (U)  A. M. Pers writes in a column in the KDP's Khabat Newspaper 
that although he is optimistic Kirkuk will come back to the 
Kurdistan region, he is disappointed the KRG is not doing more to 
ensure the result.  He says that Kurds are asking for their rights 
bashfully and ends his column by asking the question, "Has the 
Kurdish spell been dissolved after the death of Mustafa Barzani?" 
 
¶7.  (U)  In an article in the PUK-run Kurdistani Nwe, Rezhein Kurd 
writes about the use of headscarves by women in Kurdish society. 
Rezhein thinks religion should not be the motivator for wearing 
headscarves, but rather represents a cultural phenomenon.
