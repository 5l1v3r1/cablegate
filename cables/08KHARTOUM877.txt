¶1. Summary:  From May 19 to 23, a USAID team, including officers 
from the Office of Food for Peace (USAID/FFP) and Office of U.S. 
Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA), reviewed the humanitarian 
situation in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State (NBEG).  The team looked 
at the problem of malnutrition and food insecurity, as well as the 
overall situation of returnees in the state.  In terms of food 
security, the team found that although NBEG had lower than normal 
agricultural production in 2007 and the grain trade from the North 
was stopped for several months due to border insecurity, these food 
security stresses have not resulted in a crisis to date.  The main 
reasons for this situation relate to the affected population's 
ability to resort to traditional coping mechanisms to supplement 
food intake, including fishing, foraging for wild foods, and milk 
consumption, as well as aid agencies' varied food security and 
nutrition activities.  According to the U.N. Mission in Sudan's 
Return, Reintegration, and Recovery report, NBEG has received 
approximately 417,800 returning internally displaced persons (IDPs) 
and refugees since 2004 -- more than any other state in Southern 
Sudan.  The returnees' arrival and reintegration into home 
communities has gone relatively smoothly, without major problems. 
End Summary. 
 
Returns 
------- 
 
¶2. Out of the ten states in Southern Sudan, NBEG has received the 
highest number of returnees.  According to the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM), 70,000 people returned to NBEG in 
¶2007.  Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Nyamlel, Aweil West 
County told the USAID team that an estimated 75 percent of the 
returnees settled in Aweil West and North Counties.  Adeptly 
managing the recovery and reintegration process of this large cohort 
of returnees is a daunting task for humanitarian organizations and 
local authorities and will require focused attention and resources 
for several more years. 
 
¶3. To date, the 2008 returns season has seen fewer returns than the 
previous two years, with only 7,246 organized returnees and 8,000 to 
10,000 spontaneous returnees verified as of May 2008.  Returns 
agencies that met with the USAID team cited insecurity along the 
North-South border areas, particularly in the Abyei area, as the 
major reason that fewer returnees arrived in NBEG this season. 
Specifically, the closure of the Meriam-Aweil road due to insecurity 
from December 2007 to April 2008 blocked a major return route to the 
state. (Note:  In a meeting with a local official, the road closure 
was blamed on northern attempts to prevent the return of southerners 
in time for the April census.  End Note.)  In addition, aid agencies 
believe that the persistent border insecurity reduced the number of 
Dinka IDPs in South Darfur returning spontaneously from the Ed Daein 
area. 
 
¶4. Return organizations noted difficulties with ongoing 
state-sponsored returns from Khartoum and Omdurman, especially the 
lack of prior notice of arrival of truck convoys, which slows the 
assistance, such as food and household items, provided by agencies. 
Also, some returnees do not have a clear idea of the lack of 
services and infrastructure in rural destinations.  USAID raised 
these points in a meeting with the Deputy Governor who agreed to 
give advance notice to U.N. agencies and NGOs on the state-organized 
convoys.  USAID also encouraged U.N. agencies and NGOs to actively 
seek cooperation from the local authorities on this issue. 
 
Recent Displacement from Border Areas 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Another layer of complexity to the population movement dynamics 
in the state is the renewed internal displacement of populations. 
According to NGOs, the border demarcation issue is affecting the 
area, specifically the disputed border between NBEG and South Darfur 
and the border between Abyei and NBEG.  Aid organizations and local 
authorities are dealing with recovery and reintegration of returnees

on one hand, and on the other with the relief needs of the newly 
displaced.  In December 2007, insecurity displaced an estimated 
12,000 people from areas close to the South Darfur-NBEG and the 
Abyei-NBEG borders. 
 
¶6. The current Abyei crisis has brought a new wave of IDPs to NBEG. 
As of May 27, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA) reported that nearly 1,200 IDPs had arrived in Mabil 
and Malualkon towns in Aweil East County from Abyei.  On May 22, the 
USAID team visited the IDP site at Mabil, met humanitarian agencies 
and local authorities, and interviewed several IDP families.  The 
U.N. and NGO team found that some of the IDPs who fled fighting in 
Abyei are also returnees, who were slowly making their way to areas 
of origin in NBEG and had stopped in Abyei.  In addition, some of 
the Abyei IDPs who initially fled into NBEG are ethnic Twic Dinka 
and are expected to travel onwards to Twic County, Warrab State, in 
order to reside with relatives. 
 
¶7. The USAID team found that local authorities and return agencies 
in NBEG have responded quickly and effectively to the newly 
displaced from Abyei.  Non-food items (NFIs) and food assistance was 
provided within days of the Abyei IDPs' arrival.  Verification of 
the newly displaced is fast and well managed, and coordination is 
strong.  Of particular interest to the USAID team was the 
effectiveness of local authorities in tracking and monitoring the 
newly displaced, as well as the ongoing returns.  In the previous 
two years of heavy returns, it was impossible to know how many 
people had actually returned.  Agencies reported numbers and 
locations of IDPs that received assistance to return, but estimate 
that 90 percent of the returnees travel on their own and are were 
not well tracked. 
 
¶8. This year, USAID/OFDA funded returnee enumerators in every payam 
(district) in Southern Sudan, as part of a grant to IOM.  The payam 
enumerators, who work for the Southern Sudan Relief and 
Rehabilitation Commission, were given bicycles and cash incentives. 
County coordinators were given motorbikes and satellite phones.  The 
information is fed up through state offices to Juba and Khartoum. 
This year for the first time, a fuller picture is emerging of the 
total number of returnees and villages of return, which facilitates 
planning and provision of assistance by NGOs and U.N. agencies in 
the more remote, rural areas. 
 
Malnutrition 
------------ 
 
¶9. Malnutrition rates are chronically high in NBEG due to a variety 
of cultural and environmental factors, particularly during the rainy 
season, which corresponds with the hunger gap, starting from May 
until the main sorghum harvest in September-October.  However, 
relief organizations now fear t
