SUBJECT: GERMANY REQUESTED TO PROVIDE IDENTIFIER 
INFORMATION ON ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE ANNEXES OF 
UNSCRS 1737 AND 1747 
 
REF: STATE 89511 
 
¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer delivered ref demarche to 
German MFA UN Policy Division Desk Officer Mirko Schilbach 
July 2.  Schilbach thanked us for the identifying information 
provided for the Iranian entities and individuals listed in 
the Annexes of UNSCRs 1737 and 1747.  He said he especially 
appreciated the dates and places of birth of the listed 
individuals because of the difficulty in tracing names in 
Iran without such information.  As Schilbach noted, the 
commonness of certain surnames and fornames in Iran 
complicates the German Government's ability to trace 
individuals there, even when using variant spellings of the 
names. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Schilbach said he will pass the information to 
appropriate German officials, including in the Federal 
Intelligence Service (BND), for further review.  He 
identified the German Government's competencies in 
implementing UNSCRs 1737 and 1747: The Ministry of Economics 
and Technology has the lead in overseeing the implementation 
of the sanctions; the Federal Banking Supervisory Office has 
shut down the sanctioned activities of the Frankfurt branch 
of Iran's Bank Sepah; the Deutsche Bundesbank is responsible 
for freezing the assets of sanctioned entities and 
individuals; and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs monitors the 
travel ban on snctioned individuals or representatives of 
sanctoned entities.  Schilbach said he will pass to us ny 
available German Government information identfying the 
sanctioned Iranian entities and indiviuals. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will report any additional Geran response septel.
