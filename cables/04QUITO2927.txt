Your excellency: 
 
On behalf of the Ecuadorian people and the Government I 
preside, it is a great pleasure for me to extend to Your 
Excellency my warmest congratulations for your recent 
re-election as President of the United States of America. 
 
I am convinced that the task entrusted to you by your people 
to continue exercising the highest mandate of your country is 
the motivation that will allow your Administration to 
decisively face the new challenges of the international 
agenda and to contribute with your best efforts to the 
well-being of the American people. 
 
I make vows for your success in this new stage in the 
performance of your delicate duties, and I would like to 
extend an invitation for you to visit my country, at a date 
suggested by Your Excellency through the Department of State. 
 
 
Your visit will be an occasion to strengthen even more the 
excellent relations of friendship happily existing between 
our countries, and it will allow us to set new goals in the 
common road of cooperation and understanding that we 
personally and our Governments have been able to develop. 
 
I avail myself of this opportunity to reiterate to Your 
Excellency the assurances of my most distinguished 
consideration. 
 
Lucio Gutierrez Borbua, Constitutional President of the 
Republic of Ecuador.
