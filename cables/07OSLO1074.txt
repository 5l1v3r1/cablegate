 (SBU) On October 30, we spoke with MFA East Africa Director 
General Hans Jakob Frydelund, who noted that a preparatory 
meeting next week was "a little early" for the Norwegians. 
He recently received an Italian concept paper, and pledged to 
stay in close contact with his Italian colleagues.  Frydelund 
will also continue to be in close contact with his State 
Department interlocutors.
