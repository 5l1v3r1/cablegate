SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL DISCUSSES OCT SYG REPORT ON UNMIS 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  On November 5, A/SYG Mulet briefed the 
Security Council on the SYG's October 20 report on Sudan in 
an open meeting.  In the discussion that followed, Council 
members discussed the ICC indictment of Bashir, pending 
elections, Abyei, oil revenue sharing, and reconfiguration of 
UNMIS troop deployments.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 5, UN Assistant Secretary General for 
the Department of Peackeeping Operations Edmond Mulet briefed 
the Security Council on implementation of the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement (CPA) in the Sudan and the activities of the 
United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS).  Mulet 
highlighted that, while there have been no major ceasefire 
violations during the reporting period, implementation of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) has been mixed.  Mulet 
warned that the issuance of an ICC decision on Bashir could 
have implications for UNMIS and UNAMID and potentially derail 
the CPA. 
 
ICC Indictment of Bashir 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mulet's remarks during the open meeting led to many 
SC members commenting on the ICC indictment of Bashir along 
predictable lines.  Libya urged the Council to take heed of 
the "warning" in paragraph 81 of the SYG report that ICC 
actions will influence developments in Sudan and encouraged 
the SC to activate Article 16 of the Rome statute at a 
minimum.  Costa Rica countered that the GOS must respect the 
judicial independence of the ICC and assist UNMIS in 
fulfilling its mandate.  The UK, Belgium, Croatia, and Panama 
emphasized that the GOS must cooperate with the ICC. South 
Africa and Burkina Faso emphasized the negative impact ICC 
actions could have on the peace process, and China urged the 
Council to act when appropriate to insulate the peace 
process. 
 
Elections 
--------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  During the open meeting, Mulet noted that the GOS 
expects elections to take place on time, but that the July 9 
date set forth in the CPA occurs during the middle of the 
rainy season when it will be nearly impossible to conduct 
elections, and that voter education is needed in the South, 
where many are illiterate.  France asked Mulet to comment on 
whether the Secretariat believes elections are achievable in 
July 2009. China asked how the UN could speed up the process 
for holding elections. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Mulet responded that it is not realistic to have 
elections in July 2009, but that only the parties can agree 
to postpone elections under the terms of the CPA.  He further 
noted that the parties have not discussed an alternative date 
for elections. In response to China's inquiry, Mulet said 
that the UN cannot speed up the process for holding 
elections; it is the parties' responsibility.  Mulet posited 
that if the National Election Commission (NEC) is 
established, requests for UN assistance can be formed, 
suggesting that the Council consider urging the GOS to 
establish the NEC quickly.  During their remarks, both the 
U.K. and the U.S. flagged setting up the NEC as a priority 
item. 
 
Abyei 
----- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Mulet acknowledged that implementation of the 
Abyei Roadmap is behind schedule.  The UK noted that while 
forces have left the roadmap area, UNMIS still does not have 
complete freedom of movement.  The US stressed that as long 
as the Abyei Interim Administration is not funded, no 
substantial progress can be made on the ground.  Russia 
countered that the leaders of the Interim Administration are 
in place, and that there is no restriction on UNMIS movement. 
 
Oil Revenue Sharing 
------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Russia specifically noted disagreement with 
paragraph 79 of the SYG report, which recommends that parties 
to the CPA initiate discussion on a long-term wealth sharing 
agreement beyond 2011, when the people of Southern Sudan and 
Abyei will exercise their right to vote for either unity with 
or separation from Northern Sudan.  Russia argued that this 
appeal is premature and could be misunderstood, asserting 
that this issue should only be addressed at a later stage. 
France emphasized its support for paragraph 79.  In his 
closing remarks, Mulet admitted that distribution of oil 
revenue is an explosive issue, but also an important

confidence building measure for both parties.  He stressed 
that both parties must look to the future, regardless of the 
results of the 2011 referendum, noting that if this issue is 
not resolved, it will be the source of future conflicts. 
 
Reconfiguring UNMIS Troop Deployment 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  (SBU) In his October 20 report, the SYG recommended 
deployment of additional companies and a re-distribution of 
existing troops to areas of potential conflict where they are 
most needed.  (Note: The proposed increase in UNMIS force 
strength would be from 9,375 to 9,975, which is still within 
the mandated strength of 10,000 under Resolution 1590.  End 
Note.)  The U.K., Russia, Costa Rica and the U.S. all stated 
that they agreed with this proposed reconfiguration.
