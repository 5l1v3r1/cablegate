SUBJECT: Somalia - Puntland Success in Anti-Piracy Operation 
 
REF: Nairobi 02231 
 
¶1. On October 14, security forces from Somalia's semi-autonomous 
Puntland Region completed a successful operation against pirates 
operating off Somalia's coast.  On October 9, pirates seized the 
Panamanian-flagged vessel "The Wail" while it was en route from Oman 
to the Bossaso port in Puntland.  On October 14, Puntland security 
forces raided the ship and successfully liberated the vessel and its 
crew of nine Syrians and two Somalis. 
 
¶2.  On October 15, Puntland Foreign Minister Ali Abdi Aware 
contacted us to discuss the successful mission.  He told PolOff "We 
have now completed big operations and have been victorious.  Even 
when our forces were wounded, we did not give up."  Puntland forces 
made a first attempt to free the ship on October 19, engaging in an 
armed confrontation with the pirates that reportedly resulted in the 
death of two pirates and one of Puntland's security officers.  Aware 
said, "We can do more." 
 
¶3.  Minister Aware then put Puntland President Mohamed Muse Hersi on 
the line and we congratulated him on the mission.  President Hersi 
stated that while other international forces are just observing the 
activities of the pirates and nations are encouraging piracy with 
the payment of high ransoms, Puntland is ready to take action. 
Hersi said that although they have only three low-speed boats, they 
have been able to accomplish two successful operations.  (Note: In 
April, Puntland rescued an Indian ship and crew after they were 
given permission to interdict).  President Hersi concluded, "We need 
help - we need a coast guard." 
 
¶4.  Minister Aware continued the telephone call stating that with 
the recent capture of these ten pirates, Puntland has more than 30 
persons in its jails for piracy-related offenses.  "Our jails are 
full and we do not know what to do with all of these criminals who 
are using Puntland as a base for their activities."  Aware echoed 
once again a plea for assistance and requested a more detailed 
discussion of the points raised in President Hersi's response to 
Assistant Secretary Frazer's letter urging more action on piracy 
(reftel).  He said that an investment in developing Puntland's 
maritime security capacity would benefit the international 
community. 
 
¶5.  Transitional Federal Government Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Information, Youth and Sports Ahmed Abdisalam Adan told 
us on October 15 that throughout Somalia, piracy is now considered a 
legitimate business.  Young people with no opportunities are 
especially vulnerable and they increasingly are looking to support 
their families through activities on the high seas, Minister 
Abdisalam said. 
 
¶6.  There have been more than 70 piracy attacks off the coast of 
Somalia this year.  The most recent vessel, a Philippine bulk 
carrier flying a Panamanian flag, was seized on October 15 in the 
Gulf of Aden while on its way to Asia.  The International Maritime 
Bureau reports that eleven hijacked ships remain in the hands of 
pirates, along with more than 200 crew members.
