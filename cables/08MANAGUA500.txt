REF: MANAGUA 451 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli for reasons 1.4(b,d) 
 
¶1.  (C) In an April 18 meeting with us, Magda Enriquez 
Beitler, Director for International Organizations at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), discussed Miguel d'Escoto 
Brockman's potential presidency of the 63rd UN General 
Assembly (UNGA).  Before outlining his priority issues, 
Enriquez acknowledged USG concerns about D'Escoto's past and 
recent outspoken criticism of the U.S., but insisted that 
d'Escoto "will not take personal positions" and "he 
understands that he represents all nations" in the UN system. 
 Further, she said D'Escoto's "cabinet" would include 
"representatives from around the world" in order to 
"represent the UN's membership diversity." 
 
¶2.  (C) According to Enriquez, d'Escoto's priority issues for 
his presidency include: Disarmament, hunger and poverty 
alleviation, terrorism and human rights, climate change, 
women and children's issues, and democratization of the UN. 
(NOTE:  These priorities are largely consistent with those 
outlined in an April 4 letter (reftel) to Secretary Rice from 
FM Samuel Santos soliciting support for d'Escoto's candidacy. 
 END NOTE) Enriquez, who will join d'Escoto's New York team 
in a yet-to-be-determined role, was careful to stress that 
d'Escoto is "not placing any one issue above the other." 
Prior to assuming the presidency, d'Escoto and his advisors 
are planning to "meet with experts from all over the world in 
these priority areas" over the next two months "to gain a 
better understanding." 
 
¶3.  (C) On the issue of "democratization of the UN," Enriquez 
quoted d'Escoto as likening the UNGA to a "parliament" and 
the Security Council to an "Executive Committee" within the 
"framework of globalization."  She indicated d'Escoto would 
start by "strengthening the General Assembly," but did not 
offer specific details.  Enriquez mentioned that d'Escoto 
will push to expand the membership of the Security Council to 
include an additional four permanent and four or five 
non-permanent positions.  d'Escoto would like to see 
permanent council seats for Germany, India, Brazil, and 
Japan.  Enriquez emphasized that d'Escoto "doesn't want 
revolution within the UN structure," stating that "he 
believes in multilateral relationships and sees them as the 
basis of power for small countries." 
 
¶4. (C) Separately, but on this theme, on April 16 the 
Colombian Ambassador in Managua recounted to us details of a 
recent session here between d'Escoto and local GRULAC Chiefs 
of Mission that he described as "just plain frightening."  He 
said d'Escoto launched into a barrage of anti-U.S. rhetoric 
and claimed that his mandate would be to remove the UN system 
from the thrall of the imperialist U.S.  d'Escoto reportedly 
said he hopes to "completely re-order and reform" the UN and 
the way it treats the developing world.  d'Escoto also 
reportedly said that he planned to assemble a staff of "25 of 
the brightest minds in the world" who will assist him in his 
task. 
 
¶5. (C) COMMENT:  The Ortega Administration appears to have 
put a great deal of planning and effort into d'Escoto's UNGA 
presidency campaign.  Begun nearly one year ago, the GON 
successfully lobbied for support within the NAM and exploited 
the main vulnerability of their own GRULAC regional grouping 
-- its pathological need for consensus -- to outflank any 
potential challengers.  However, all this careful spadework 
may be for naught given that the GON (and apparently d'Escoto 
himself) does not appear to truly understand the complexity 
of the UN, especially the sensitive topic of UN reform and 
the negative reaction likely to follow his first outrageous 
anti-U.S. screed.  Ultimately, d'Escoto himself may be his 
worst enemy.  The combination of his deep loathing of the 
U.S., his impatience for those who can't grasp the grandeur 
of his "unity" vision, and his generally unpleasant personal 
demeanor suggest an administration of conflict, ill will and 
squandered opportunities.
