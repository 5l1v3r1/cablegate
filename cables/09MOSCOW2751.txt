SUBJECT:  EXBS: RUSSIA ADVISOR MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE - OCTOBER 
2009 
 
¶1.  Begin summary: BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY 
MANAGERS: EXBS has been approached by Russian Central Customs 
Administration (Moscow) to support an IVP to US ports of entry. 
EXBS is working with CBP and ICE on this visit.  A new Russian 
federal agency, Rosgranitsa, has also asked EXBS and CBP's help to 
conduct a similar IVP.  Rosgranitsa is charged with ensuring 
security of facilities and IT infrastructure at ports of entry. 
EXBS is working with CBP and the Russian Embassy in Washington to 
develop this visit.  Planning with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
proceeds on the reinstituted Program Review and additional Export 
Licensing Exchange scheduled for the first week of February in 
Washington.  Advisor participated in consultations in Washington 
October 13-14.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  Completed Actions for Reporting Period. 
 
¶A.  Site Assessments and Meetings During the Reporting Period. 
 
i.  October 6 - EXBS Advisor met with DCM Eric Rubin to report on 
progress and challenges for the EXBS program in Russia.  DCM was 
pleased with cooperation from Russian stakeholders and US 
interagency partners.  DCM agreed to host reception for Customs 
Attache Club in the nearest future.  DCM approved EXBS Advisor's 
request for reinstatement on Country Team, which had been suspended 
since the time of the previous Advisor. 
 
ii.  October 26 - Ambassador Beyrle visited the Law Enforcement 
Section, where EXBS is located, to solicit input on ways that law 
enforcement could advance the US-Russian strategic relationship. 
The EXBS Advisor and EXBS Assistant cited the upcoming Program 
Review (requested by MFA) and export licensing exchange as examples 
of enhanced cooperation.  In addition, we mentioned the export 
enforcement seminar that will take place in 2010 as an example of 
new areas of cooperation in law enforcement. 
 
iii.  October 28 - EXBS Advisor met with Jules Silberberg of the 
Political Section to update him on EXBS activities and identify 
areas of mutual interest.  The meeting was requested by Mr. 
Silberberg, who is doing a return tour of duty in Moscow after being 
away for eight years.  We agreed that periodic contact and 
information exchange would be mutually beneficial. 
 
iv.  October 29 - EXBS Advisor and ICE representatives attended the 
Customs Attache Club meeting and reception at the Finnish Embassy. 
Finnish customs officers reported on approaches to inspect, 
interdict, and prosecute export controls violators.  Present were 
several representatives of Russian Customs from the international 
cooperation section, including their chief, Mr. Sergei Konovalenko. 
Also present was Mr. Aleksei Vasiliev, head of the Northwest Region 
(St. Petersburg) Administration; and Ms. Yekaterina Grigorevna, from 
the Central Region (Moscow) Administration.  The Advisor had 
constructive conversations with all of the Russian officers to 
advance planned activities, including the Central Region IVP in 
December and Advanced Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) training in St. 
Petersburg at a later date. 
 
¶B.  Training Conducted During Reporting Period. 
 
i.  EXBS continues to support DOE/INECP's targeted export controls 
training for managers at Roskosmos and Rosatom.  The EXBS Assistant 
attended two export controls workshops organized by DOE/INECP 
October 6-8 for Roskosmos employees, and October 21-23 for Rosatom 
employees.  The workshops consisted of presentations by Roskomos and 
Rosatom, respectively; FSTEK (the federal licensing authority), 
Customs, and specialized labs on their agencies' relationship to 
export controls.  Both workshops were held in St. Petersburg with 
EXBS funding, attracting 30-40 attendees to each event.  The 
Roskosmos event also included a presentation on internal compliance 
by Dr. James Smith, formerly of The Boeing Company, now working as a 
consultant. 
 
¶C.  Equipment Delivered During Reporting Period. 
 
i.  The EXBS Russia program does not distribute equipment. 
 
¶3. Imminent Training or Equipment Status Update 
 
i.  EXBS is working with CBP and ICE on an IVP requested by the 
Central Region (Moscow) Customs Administration scheduled for 
mid-December.  The delegation will visit ports of entry in Southern 
California, including Los Angeles (Long Beach) and San Diego to 
observe procedures and technologies for processing passenger and 
cargo traffic. 
 
¶4.  Significant Developments in Export Controls, Nonproliferation, 
or Related Border Security 
 
i.  A brouhaha over fears by academics that bureaucratic barriers 
could hamper their efforts to publish and travel abroad seems to 
have died down.  In early October, an internal document from St. 
Petersburg State University was posted on a popular Internet forum. 
The document called for faculty members to provide copies of texts 
to be published abroad so that they could be reviewed for violations 
of intellectual property law or possible export controls violations. 
 This requirement would have been extended even to the humanities. 
The ensuing outcry from academics and attention by the media led to 
a statement issued by university authorities in early November 
overturning this requirement for researchers in the humanities and 
social sciences. 
 
¶5.  Country Plans and Other Assistance 
 
i.  This material was transmitted separately to Action Officer 
Rachel Owen.
