CONFERENCE IN BEIJING 
 
REF: STATE 224126 
 
(SBU) In response to reftel:  While the New Zealand 
government is very supportive of the Chinese effort to host 
the first ARF Security Policy Conference (ASPC), it still is 
trying to determine who will represent New Zealand at the 
November 4-6 event in Beijing.  The government is 
disappointed with the invitation's tardiness, making it more 
difficult to identify its representative, according to 
Bronwyn Evans-Kent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade's Security Policy Division.  New Zealand probably will 
send a representative from its embassy in Beijing and, 
possibly, from the ministry.  The ministry official would be 
at the deputy director (deputy assistant secretary- 
equivalent) level.  Ms. Evans-Kent would be interested in 
learning about U.S. participation.  Meanwhile, she will keep 
post updated on her government's plans.
