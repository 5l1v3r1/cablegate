(SBU) On July 18, CDA delivered the talking points in reftels 
to Foreign Minister Norman Caldera.  Caldera stated that, in 
the main, the GON supports the U.S. position on U.N. Security 
Council reform.  Caldera said that he had communicated this 
position to high level Department officials while in 
Washington last week.  He noted that while Nicaragua supports 
Japanese and German permanent membership in the Security 
Council, it does not support India or Brazil, because of the 
nuclear policy of the former and doubts about the democratic 
stability of the latter.
