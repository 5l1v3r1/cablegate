SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON ANTI-COUNTERFEITING TRADE AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 182554 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)  Econ Counselor raised reftel demarche last week in 
separate meetings with Houda Marrakchi, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Abdallah Ouadghiri, Director of the Moroccan 
Copyrights Office (BMDA), and Aziz Bouazzaoui, Director of 
the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property 
(OMPIC).  All expressed interest in the proposal, though they 
had questions regarding how it would relate to Morocco's 
existing obligations under its bilateral free trade 
agreements.  Marrakchi committed to circulate the text of the 
concept paper to members of the GOM's inter-ministerial 
working group on IPR issues, which includes the Ministry of 
Communications, Justice Ministry, BMDA and OMPIC. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Inter-ministerial coordination on the 
question will likely take some time, and it is doubtful we 
will receive a detailed reaction by the envisioned December 
date for an intial meeting of interested countries.  We will 
continue to push the concept in our meetings with IPR 
contacts, however.  End Comment.
