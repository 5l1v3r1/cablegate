SUBJECT: NOMINATION FOR 2010 SECRETARY'S WOMEN OF COURAGE 
AWARD 
 
REF: STATE 111471 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per Reftel, Embassy Baghdad is pleased to submit its 
nominee for the Secretary's 2010 Award for International 
Women of Courage, keyed to the priorities in the reference. 
The nominee has been informed of the Ambassador's intention 
to nominate her and is available to travel in March 2010. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Nominee: Iman Kadhim Abood Al-Bawi 
Date of Birth: August 16, 1967 
Country of Birth: Iraq 
Citizenship: Iraqi 
Job Title/Association: Senior Program Manager, CHF 
International 
Address: CHF Ramadi Compound, Ramadi, Iraq 
Telephone: 964 (0) 780-143-2946; 
Email: ekadhum@chf-iraq.org 
 
¶3. (SBU) Iman Abood is a Senior Program Manager with CHF 
International, a development and humanitarian organization 
involved in health, governance, infrastructure, economic 
development and housing projects in Iraq. Many of the 
programs support women's political, economic and social 
advancement.  In 2007, CHF was looking for volunteers to 
establish a variety of USAID Community Action Programs (CAP) 
in war-torn Anbar Province.  At the time, Anbar had only 
recently emerged from three years of incessant combat between 
Coalition Forces and a determined Sunni insurgency, lead by 
Al-Qaida.  No one wanted to take the job, except Iman. 
 
¶4. (SBU) As a liberal Shi'a woman, Iman was a very unlikely 
candidate to spearhead community-based programs in an 
almost-exclusively Sunni province dominated by conservative 
Bedouin tribes.  In some areas of Anbar, women are still 
persecuted for attempting to hold positions in government and 
are beaten for working with NGOs.  Iman has personally faced 
mortal danger on more than one occasion, having recently 
survived a car bombing in Ramadi, ad yet she has not only 
persevered, but has excelled in her job. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Anbar Province contains a disproportionate amount of 
war widows, having experienced the brunt of combat during the 
insurgency years.  As a prime implementer for the Marla 
Ruzicka Fund, Iman has supported more than 2,000 individual 
and community projects that directly benefit these widows. 
The fund provides them with vocational training and 
equipment, in addition to micro-loans for the establishment 
of small businesses.  By giving these women the tools to 
become active participants in the local economy, the Marla 
Ruzicka Fund has advanced the cause of women's rights in 
Anbar Province and prompted a re-evaluation of their role in 
this conservative society. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In addition, Iman has managed and executed CAPIII 
projects such as school renovations, literacy programs, 
neighborhood cleanups, water and sewage rehabilitation, and 
small infrastructure repairs in the cities of Falluja, 
Ramadi, Hit, Haditha, Anah, Rutbah and Al-Qa'im.  Between the 
Marla Ruzicka Fund and the CAPIII program, Iman has managed 
over $4,000,000 in USAID grants since 2007. 
 
¶7. (SBU) It is important to note, as well, that Iman 
developed and implemented these programs from scratch.  When 
she arrived in Anbar, CHF had no presence in the province. 
Since taking the position in 2007, she has established 
offices in some of the most conservative and dangerous cities 
in Iraq, such as Rutbah, Rawah and Al-Qa'im.  She traveled to 
Anbar by herself, recruited and trained her staff, and 
pitched CAP programs to local mayors, city council members, 
directors general and tribal sheikhs.  She has succeeded in 
implementing these programs through sheer determination and 
force of will. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Iman's efforts have been a fundamental component of 
the USG's reconstruction and capacity-building mission in 
Anbar Province, and have produced tangible results that have 
improved the lives of the Anbari people. 
Qimproved the lives of the Anbari people.
