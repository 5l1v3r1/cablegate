¶1.  Summary.  The Government of National Unity (GNU), Government of 
South Sudan (GOSS), and humanitarian community continue to respond 
to flooding that has affected hundreds of thousands of people 
throughout Sudan in July.  The GNU Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) 
estimates that flooding has damaged or destroyed 50,000 homes 
countrywide.  The situation is expected to worsen as the rainy 
season continues in August and September.  The most affected states 
to date are Khartoum, Northern Kordofan, and Kassala; however, new 
preliminary reports suggest that damage in parts of Southern Sudan 
may be equally as extensive.  The most urgent need in northern and 
eastern Sudan is shelter, as rains and flooding have washed away 
tens of thousands of mud-brick homes.  The needs remain unclear in 
Southern Sudan, where assessment teams are still collecting 
information.  As a first step in response, USAID's Office of U.S. 
Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) is sending two airlifts to 
Khartoum with a total of 1,300 rolls of plastic sheeting - enough to 
provide shelter for 78,000 individuals.  The U.N. is tapping into 
two emergency funding mechanisms and may issue a flash appeal. 
USAID will consider additional assistance as the situation unfolds 
and needs are identified.  End summary.

Northern Sudan Situation Update 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The U.N. Resident Coordinator's Office is leading northern Sudan 
humanitarian planning efforts at the national level, with GNU 
participation.  At the state level, USAID partners, U.N. agencies, 
and other NGOs report good collaboration with local officials, 
strong government leadership, and few bureaucratic impediments to 
access.  (Note:  Sudanese Military Intelligence recently denied a 
USAID team permission to visit flood-affected areas in Kassala 
State.  End note.)  The GNU has declared some flood-affected states 
disaster areas, a distinction that allows NGOs to obtain documents 
under the "fast-track" procedures initially developed for Darfur; 
the non-governmental organization (NGO) Oxfam recently received an 
entry visa for Red Sea State within the 48-hour limit described in 
the guidelines. 
 
¶3.  The U.N. sector leads are still compiling information from NGOs 
regarding efforts to date and plans for additional activities.  The 
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. Joint Logistics Center 
(UNJLC), and the NGO CARE International have provided NGOs supplies 
such as plastic sheeting, sleeping mats, blankets, mosquito nets, 
cooking sets, and water containers through the common pipeline 
system.  NGOs have distributed the supplies to more than 192,000 
people countrywide.  To address water, sanitation, and hygiene 
needs, UNICEF has tankered water to 10,000 people and plans to 
provide water for 100,000 more.  UNICEF has chlorinated water 
sources for 500,000 individuals and plans to chlorinate the water 
supply of an additional 500,000 people.  The U.N. World Health 
Organization (WHO) is focusing on stocking medicines, providing 
human resources, controlling vectors, and preventing the spread of 
water-borne illnesses.  WHO has launched a countrywide media 
campaign to increase public awareness of potential disease outbreaks 
associated with flooding.  WHO reports that flood-affected 
populations have little or no access to health care facilities Jebel 
Aulia IDP camp in Khartoum, and parts of eastern Sudan and Northern 
Kordofan State.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) has assisted 
40,000 flood-affected individuals in White Nile, Northern Kordofan, 
and Kassala states. 
 
¶4.  On July 22, U.S. Charge d'Affaires (CDA) Fernandez and USAID 
staff traveled to El Obeid, Northern Kordofan State, to visit 
flood-affected areas and review response efforts.  Flooding resulted 
in the deaths of 9 people and injury to 42 others, according to 
state officials.  More than 4,000 homes were destroyed, and 9,000 
households, or approximately 57,000 people, were affected.  Local 
officials and NGOs visited three affected areas of El Obeid town 
with the USAID team and CDA.  The state government and NGOs have 
formed an emergency committee to provide assistance, including food, 
plastic sheeting, sandbags, tents, and USAID-funded relief supplies. 
 WHO reported that the number of suspected malaria cases rose from 
2,855 during the first week of July to 3,820 during the week of July 
¶20.  The Sudanese Red Crescent Society, which has opened three 
mobile clinics in the state, reported rises in diarrheal diseases, 
acute respiratory infection, food poisoning, typhoid, and 
conjunctivitis. 
 
¶5.  Heavy rains and flooding significantly damaged homes in Kassala 
and Khartoum states.  Efforts are underway to assist approximately 
 
KHARTOUM 00001210  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
118,000 people in both locations.  Of additional concern is Tokar 
town, located in a delta of the Baraka River in Red Sea State. 
Tokar is situated below the river's water level, and is typically 
linked to the rest of Sudan by roads that are now impassible due to 
floods.  Approximately 42,000 individuals are now inaccessible, and 
government agencies are racing to build barriers to prevent the 
entire town from submersion.  The Red Sea State Government has been 
planning the relocation of the entire town for some time, fearing 
this situation.  However, infrastructure in the town's new location 
is insufficient to accommodate the move at this time.

Southern Sudan Situation Update 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  On July 20, the GOSS declared disasters in Upper Nile, Jonglei, 
Unity, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Lakes, and Warrap state due to 
flooding.  As many as 12,000 homes may be damaged or destroyed, 
according to initial NGO and government reports.  The preliminary 
information available suggests that eastern Upper Nile State and 
Unity State are the most-affected areas.  Assessments are still 
underway, and the humanitarian community is in the process of 
consolidating and evaluating information before determining a 
collective plan of action.  The GOSS and the U.N. are leading 
efforts to coordinate assistance. 
 
¶7.  USAID/OFDA is collecting information from NGO partners, U.N. 
agencies, and the GOSS.  USAID will provide more detailed reporting 
on the situation in the coming week, as reliable estimates of 
damage, needs, and gaps become available. 
 
------------------------------ 
USG and International Response 
------------------------------ 
¶8.  Many existing USAID partners are responding to the floods 
throughout Sudan.  Due to a lack of available plastic sheeting, 
USAID/OFDA is providing in-kind donations of plastic sheeting valued 
at USD 604,000 to UNICEF and the Non-Food Item (NFI) Common 
Pipeline.  The plastic sheeting is scheduled to arrive on airlifts 
on August 8 and 9, pending GNU clearances.  The USAID team in Juba, 
Southern Sudan, is analyzing needs and possible assistance options. 
USAID is prepared to respond quickly in Southern Sudan once needs 
are known. 
¶9.  The humanitarian community is relying on multiple mechanisms to 
fund flood-response efforts.  The U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for 
Sudan has allocated USD 4.87 million from the U.N. Common 
Humanitarian Fund for Sudan to cover immediate needs.  Additionally, 
the humanitarian community is requesting USD 11.5 million from the 
global U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund for activities 
addressing two- to-three-month needs.  The U.N. also plans to issue 
a flash appeal, the amount of which is presently unknown.  The NFI 
Common Pipeline is issuing a separate appeal for USD 3.5 million; 
the USD 604,000 in USAID funding falls under this appeal.  In 
addition, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies launched an appeal for USD 1.6 million in early July, and 
NGOs are issuing separate appeals for their operations.
