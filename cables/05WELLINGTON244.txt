(U) Classified by DCM David R. Burnett.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and 
(d). 
 
(U) Following is post's response to ref A, keyed to questions 
listed in ref A's Paragraph 10. 
 
¶A. (U) No/no assets have been frozen, forfeited or seized in 
New Zealand pursuant to UNSC Resolutions 1267 and 1373. 
 
¶B. (C) The New Zealand government, wanting to be seen as a 
mediating force and as a defender of small countries' 
interests in the region, generally is reluctant to co-sponsor 
initiatives just with the United States in multilateral 
forums.  Cooperation with New Zealand also is hindered by the 
fact that it still is working to strengthen its 
anti-terrorism laws and provisions for designating terrorists 
that are not listed by the United Nations (ref B).  The 
government has not yet made such designations. 
 
¶C. (U) The New Zealand government is willing to accept USG 
training and technical assistance, including an assessment of 
training needs.  In fact, post has attempted to identify 
appropriate training opportunities in Washington for New 
Zealand officials, but has not been successful (ref D); we 
have been told that New Zealand is not among countries 
considered priorities for such training.  The New Zealand 
government is particularly seeking training in techniques in 
investigating terrorism finance and in tracking terrorist 
cells. 
 
¶D. (S) We would rank New Zealand as "low" in terms of risk 
that it will be used as a site for significant fund raising 
or for significant banking services for terrorists.  So far, 
New Zealand has identified no assets held in the country by 
terrorists designated through the UN 1267 Committee process. 
New Zealand has built its efforts against terrorism financing 
on a strong banking, financial reporting and enforcement 
regime that has been in place to combat money laundering. 
While the New Zealand government is investigating various 
individuals who may have connections to terrorist 
organizations such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelan, 
Ansar Al-Island and al Qaida, those investigations have 
focused on determining the nature of any such relationships 
and have not uncovered any indication of criminal behavior 
(ref C).  The Embassy also has no information indicating that 
a terrorist cell is operating in New Zealand.
