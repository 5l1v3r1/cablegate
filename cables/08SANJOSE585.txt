¶1. On July 2, Minister of Public Security Janina Del Vecchio 
signed Reftel Search and Rescue Memorandum of Understanding 
(SAR MOU) between Costa Rica and the United States.  The GOCR 
made no changes to the text. 
 
¶2. As per Para 3c of Reftel, Post requests authority for our 
Chief of the Office of Defense Representative (ODR), 
Commander Mark Camacho, USCG, to sign the agreement on behalf 
of the United States Coast Guard.  (He is the senior, and 
only, U.S. Coast Guard rep. in country.) 
 
¶3. Conclusion of this SAR MOU would fulfill the respective 
SAR Convention obligations of the U.S. and Costa Rica, as 
well as the goals of the 1997 IMO Pacific Ocean Regional 
Conference.  This SAR MOU will directly support and improve 
coordination and cooperation between the USG and GOCR in SAR 
operations in both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
