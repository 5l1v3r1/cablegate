¶1. (SBU) PolOff discussed Costa Rica's views of the proposed 
G-4 resolution for expanding the UN Security Council with MFA 
Acting Director for Foreign Policy Edwin Arias on July 12, 
¶2005.  At that time, Arias said Costa Rica opposed permanent 
membership but had not yet finalized its position.  Arias 
quizzed PolOff at length on our public support for Japan's 
permanent membership.  In a follow-up conversation on July 
15, Arias confirmed that Costa Rica has decided to oppose the 
G-4 framework and any other expansion plans involving new 
permanent members.  Arias said Costa Rica wants to see the 
Security Council's membership significantly broadened but 
with new members serving six-year terms, eligible for 
re-election twice.  Arias added that his government had 
already communicated this position to the government of Japan. 
¶2. (SBU) Foreign Minister Tovar had told Charge on May 16 
that Costa Rica preferred that new UN Security Council 
members not be made permanent, but rather serve renewable 
terms (ref C).
