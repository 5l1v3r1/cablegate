SUBJECT: NEW FUNDING PROGRAM FOR CANADIAN MARINE FACILITY SECURITY 
 
REF: 03 HALIFAX  0349 
 
¶1.  In a May 7 press conference at Pier 21 in Halifax, Canada 
attended by Consul, Canadian Transport Minister Tony Valeri 
announced a three-year, $115 million federal program to assist 
Canadian ports and ports facilities upgrade their security. 
This program will enable Canada to not only comply with new 
International Maritime Organization security requirements which 
take effect July 1, but will also bring Canada into compliance 
with stricter North American requirements.   According to 
Valeri, the security funding - using the general 10:1 yardstick 
- favorably compares with that which the USG is devoting to the 
same purposes and matches the U.S. program to assist ports and 
port facilities.   The funding will be distributed under a 75 
percent government/25 percent recipient cost-share formula, for 
a total of $150 million in enhancements on such things as 
surveillance, fencing and other perimeter controls, command, 
control and communications structures, and infrastructure 
protection by guards or police. 
 
¶2.  While this Marine Facility Security Contribution Program 
funding is in addition to the $308 million already announced as 
earmarked for marine security, both are part of the five-year 
$690 million new national security policy announced April 27. 
Fisheries and Ocean Minister Geoff Regan and Defense Minister 
David Pratt then provided further details on how the marine 
security funds will be spent on the Coast Guard and Navy.  Major 
projects are creation of joint marine security operations 
centers in Halifax (Trinity) and Esquimalt, B.C. (Athena), 
secure communications capability for Coast Guard vessels, 
increased on-water days for both the Navy and Coast Guard, and 
increased aerial surveillance time.
