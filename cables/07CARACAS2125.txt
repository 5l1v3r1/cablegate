¶1. (SBU) Summary.   Truckers ended a 97-day binational 
blockade of bridges joining Venezuela and Colombia on October 
13 after the Colombian government agreed to relocate toll 
booths, giving motorists alternate local routes to avoid the 
Colombian tolls.  Truck drivers from both countries were 
protesting the Colombian levy with a series of blockades 
since July 2.  The blockades cost the local Venezuelan 
economy an estimated USD 5-6 million per day in lost revenue 
and required the personal efforts of the Colombian Foreign 
Minister to end the blockade.  End Summary.

¶2.  (SBU) Venezuelan and Colombian truckers started this 
bilateral disagreement by blockading border crossings in 
Tachira because of Colombia's decision to charge tolls at 
border crossings between Tachira State and the Colombian city 
of Cucuta.  The 97-day spat eventually closed several 
international bridges that connect Tachira State to 
Colombia's Norte de Santader Department.  Losses to trade as 
a result of the protests and border closures--through which 
70 to 80 percent of Venezuelan-Colombian trade is 
conducted--were estimated as high as 5-6 million a day.  An 
IVP alumn in Tachira told Poloff that the closures had 
damaged the economies of the Venezuelan towns of Bolivar and 
Pedro Maria Urena, but both are now recovering. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Venezuelan government officials supported the 
demand that Colombia withdraw the tolls.  Foreign Minister 
Maduro urged Colombia on August 10 to eliminate the toll 
charges and asked that it behave in the same "neighborly 
spirit" as Venezuela.  Vice Foreign Minister Pavel Rondon 
acted as an intermediary between the protesters and the 
Colombian governemnt.  Colombian Foreign Minister Fernando 
Araujo announced October 12 the relocation of toll booths 
four kilometers further down the road in Colombia, allowing 
motorists a local traffic route to avoid the tolls.
