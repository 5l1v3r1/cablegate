SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE - JANUARY 8 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Kerem Shalom crossing and Nahal Oz fuel transfer 
station were open to shipments on January 8.  Attempts to use Erez 
for shipments were unsuccessful due to the deaths of Palestinian 
workers from IDF fire.  UNRWA and the ICRC have announced that they 
are suspending operations due to multiple incidents involving IDF 
attacks on convoys, including during the three-hour "pause". 
Electrical supply remains limited due to damage to the grid, though 
some feeder lines have been repaired.  UNRWA reports that at least 
750,000 Gazans are without running water.  End Summary. 
 
January 8: Crossings open to limited shipments 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to UN contacts, as of 1700 local, an estimated 
40-50 truckloads (33 for UN agencies and the rest for the private 
sector) entered via Kerem Shalom; approximately ten entered via 
Rafah on January 8.  PA Fuel Agency and EU contacts reported that 
400,000 liters of power plant fuel and 200 tons of cooking gas were 
transferred through Nahal Oz pipelines on January 8. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Plans to bring shipments in via Erez crossing on January 8 
were suspended after IDF tank fire killed two forklift operators on 
the Palestinian side of the crossing.  ConGen contacts reported that 
a number of dual nationals evacuated via Erez on January 8, but we 
do not have confirmed numbers or nationalities. 
 
¶4. (SBU) UN contacts confirm final crossings numbers for January 7: 
65 truckloads via Kerem Shalom, including 30 for aid agencies; seven 
truckloads of medical supplies, three ambulances, and 29 medical 
evacuees via Rafah; 362,000 liters of power plant fuel, 92,000 
liters of diesel for UNRWA, and 43 tons of cooking gas via Nahal OZ. 
 According to UNRWA, an additional 135,000 liters of power plant 
fuel were transferred back-to-back at Kerem Shalom and transported 
to the Gaza power plant. 
 
Aid Agencies Suspending Operations 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Movement within Gaza remained difficult and dangerous, even 
during the second "humanitarian pause."  UNRWA and ICRC contacted 
RefCoord on January 8 to report they are suspending operations in 
Gaza after several incidents today, including the one at Erez 
mentioned above.  The other incidents were: 
 
- During the 3-hour "pause", an UNRWA convoy of three armored 
vehicles and one ambulance was fired on by the IDF.  No injuries 
reported. 
 
- An ICRC truck was fired on; five rounds went through the 
windshield. 
 
¶6. (SBU) ICRC and UNRWA reported that they feel strongly that the 
"pattern and failure of coordination with the IDF" over the past 72 
hours, resulting in the death of transport workers and paramedics, 
"must be corrected" before they can restart operations. 
 
Water/Shelter 
------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) UNRWA reports on January 8 that at least 750,000 people do 
not have access to running water.  UNRWA reports that roughly 20,000 
people are now sheltered in 27 UNRWA facilities.  UNRWA distributed 
food and water trucks to all 27 of its emergency shelter locations, 
but the agency reports there is still a severe shortage of blankets 
and mattresses. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) UNRWA is providing flour and cooking gas to a commercial 
bakery to bake roughly 120,000 pieces of pita per day for the 20,000 
people in UNRWA shelters.  UNRWA reports that flour is generally 
unavailable in the market.   WFP reports that it has delivered food 
to roughly 50,000 out of 235,000 beneficiaries since 27 December. 
 
Electricity/Fuel 
---------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The Gaza Power Plant now has approximately three days 
worth of fuel.  However, PA Gaza Fuel Agency Director Amir Bashir 
said that high-voltage transmission lines from the plant were downed 
in recent days.  Technicians from the Gaza Electricity Distribution 
Company (GEDCO) are working to access those lines.  According to EU 
contacts, until the lines are repaired, no power can reach the 
grid. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) According to UN reports, GEDCO repaired a number of 
downed Israeli feeder lines in recent days.  Nine of the ten feeder 
 
JERUSALEM 00000079  002 OF 002 
 
 
lines are functioning.  Nevertheless, Gaza City's two main 
electricity distribution transformers were destroyed December 29-31, 
disabling most of Gaza City's power distribution, according to 
PalTel and EU contacts. 
¶11. (SBU) The UN reports that there is "extensive" damage to the 
electricity network.  GEDCO reports that it needs 20 transformers, 
10km of cable, and at least 100 low-voltage disconnectors.  USAID 
Gaza staff and the UN report that many families are without cooking 
gas. USAID Gaza staff report that 100 tons of cooking gas remains 
uncollected on the Palestinian side of Nahal Oz, due to security 
concerns.
