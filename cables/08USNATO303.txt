SUBJECT: NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL CONDEMNS RUSSIAN RECOGNITION 
 
¶1. (SBU) On Wednesday, August 27, the North Atlantic Council 
issued a statement in regards to Russian recognition of South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The text of the statement follows: 
 
Statement 
 
by the North Atlantic Council on the Russian recognition of 
South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of Georgia 
 
The North Atlantic Council condemns the decision of the 
Russian Federation to extend recognition to the South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia regions of Georgia and calls upon Russia to 
reverse its decision. 
 
Russia's decision violates the many UN Security Council 
resolutions it has endorsed regarding Georgia's territorial 
integrity, and is inconsistent with the fundamental OSCE 
principles on which stability in Europe is based.  Russia's 
actions have called into question its commitment to peace and 
security in the Caucasus. 
 
Georgia's recovery, security and stability are important to 
the Alliance.  NATO calls on Russia to respect Georgia's 
territorial integrity and to fulfill its commitments under 
the six-principle agreement signed by President Saakashvili 
and President Medvedev (FOOTNOTE). 
 
FOOTNOTE: As complemented by President Sarkozy's 
clarifications and correspondence on this issue.
