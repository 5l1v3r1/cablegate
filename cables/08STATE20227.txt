REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 050085764, 050041335, 
050024484, 050074594, 050064829, 050040825, and 050057178 for 
the export of firearms and components to Canada . Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. 
Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for Request: To ensure that the items 
received by end-user are the same as the defense articles 
authorized by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls 
(DDTC) in the licenses detailed below. Also, to verify that 
the defense articles are being used for the purposes stated 
in their respective licenses. Confidential reporting has 
suggested that U.S. exporter, Questar, may exporting 
unauthorized items such as threaded barrels and telescoping 
stocks. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
intelligence indicates end-user, Mark Herzog, may have a 
criminal record. 
 
¶4. (U) Action Request: Post is requested to verify that the 
items received by end-user, Mark Herzog, match those 
authorized by the licenses detailed below. Post is also 
requested to verify that the authorized defense articles are 
being used for the purposes stated in these licenses. In 
doing so, Post should review end-user's records to establish 
the ultimate end-users of all defense articles that were 
resold on the commercial market. Post should verify that the 
ultimate end-users reside in Canada. 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any other 
information pertinent to these transactions, in particular 
the security of facilities, the discovery of prohibited items 
such as threaded barrels and telescoping stocks, or concerns 
about the entities involved. DDTC recommends that Embassy 
enlist the support of law enforcement personnel at post such 
as ICE and ATFE for technical expertise in identifying 
possibly unauthorized items.
