PolMilOff delivered reftel points to MFA Disarmament Head of 
Department Bulent Meric March 23, emphasizing the importance 
of this final prepcom before the 2005 revcon.  Meric said he 
would review the US points and noted that, like the USG, the 
GOT was "disturbed that the NPT has shortcomings" as revealed 
in the cases of Iran and DPRK.  The GOT was prepared to 
devote much effort to making the New York prepcom a success. 
Meric asserted that a WEOG meeting to coordinate positions 
prior to the prepcom would be very useful
