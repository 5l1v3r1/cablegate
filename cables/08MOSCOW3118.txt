REF: STATE 102660 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Kumertau Aircraft Production Enterprise 
representatives told us their company is ultimately controlled by 
RosOboronExport (ROE).  TechPromService representatives told us, 
however, that the company is a private enterprise not affiliated 
with ROE.  We were unable to conduct site visits to assess the 
security of the companies' facilities, but both companies told us 
the security at their facilities must be tight in order to handle 
state secrets.  Kumertau Aircraft Production Enterprise produces and 
sells civilian and military helicopters; it is not a broker. 
TechPromService, however, is a broker.  This particular United 
States Munitions List (USML) item will be installed on helicopters 
that TechPromService will lease to OboronProm Leasing, a company 
that is ultimately controlled by ROE.  Neither Kumertau Aircraft 
Production Enterprise nor TechPromService provided us with copies of 
the contract regarding this transaction, but General Director of 
TechPromService did send us a letter that said his company would 
install SX-16 infrared searchlights on the helicopters.  Both 
Kumertau Aircraft Production Enterprise and TechPromService 
understand restrictions on USML items, including their re-export. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) In an October 17 meeting Kumertau Aircraft Production 
Enterprise Deputy Director General Sergey Sayganov told us his 
company has been in business since 1962.  The General Director of 
the company is Mikhail Malarenko.  According to Sayganov, 100 
percent of the company's shares are owned by the GOR.  Kumertau 
Aircraft Production Enterprise is controlled by Kamov Holding 
Company, which is controlled by Helicopters of Russia, which is part 
of OboronProm, which is part of ROE, which is controlled by 
RosTekhnologii. 
 
¶3. (U) TechPromService Legal Counselor Sergey Khomenko told us 
October 16 that his company is a private enterprise founded on 
August 31, 2000.  The General Director is Oleg Yunusov and the 
Commercial Director is Rafail Rafikov.  Khomenko told us his company 
was not affiliated with ROE. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We were unable to conduct site visits to assess the 
security of the facilities for either company.  Sayganov and 
Khomenko told us, however, that their companies collocate their 
civil and military production facilities, and so are secure enough 
to house state secrets. 
 
¶5. (U) Kumertau Aircraft Production Enterprise produces and sells 
civilian and military helicopters and spare parts.  It does not act 
as a broker.  TechPromService, however, is a broker.  It refurbishes 
old helicopters, such as those produced by Kumertau Aircraft 
Production Enterprise, and then resells or leases them to other 
entities. 
 
¶6. (U) Kumertau Aircraft Production Enterprise typically sells its 
helicopters to customers in Russia and the CIS, including the 
Russian military.  TechPromService often works with Kumertau 
Aircraft Production Enterprise, Kamov Holding Company, RosVertol, in 
Russia, and Motor Sich, in Zaporozhiye, Ukraine. 
 
¶7. (U) While we did not receive a copy of the contract related to 
this transaction, we did receive a letter from the TechPromService 
General Director that said this USML item will be installed on 
KA-32A11BC search and rescue helicopters.  According to Sayganov, 
TechPromService will lease the helicopters to OboronProm Leasing, a 
company which is controlled by OboronProm, which is controlled by 
ROE.  The helicopters will be used only in the Russian Federation. 
 
¶8. (U) Kumertau Aircraft Production Enterprise and TechPromService 
understand the restrictions on USML items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports.
