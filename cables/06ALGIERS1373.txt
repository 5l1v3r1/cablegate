HARIRI THANKS GOA; RECEIVES SUPPORT FOR CEASE-FIRE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶1.  (U) Saad Hariri, the leader of the largest political party 
represented in the Lebanese parliament and son of the slain Lebanese 
prime minister, visited Algiers July 23.  In public remarks reported by 
the press, he thanked "Algeria, its president and head of government fo 
their support" and underscored that Algeria was "the first country to 
have supported Lebanon and rapidly sent aid."  After his meeting with 
President Bouteflika, Hariri told the press he had asked Bouteflika to 
use his influence to establish a cease-fire in Lebanon.  (Note: 
President Bouteflika made no public remarks following the meeting.  End 
Note.) 
 
¶2.  (U) After his earlier meeting with Hariri, Prime Minister Belkhadem 
remarked to the press that the Israeli aggression against Lebanon was 
"strongly supported by permanent members of the Security Council." 
Belkhadem called on the international community to act to stop the 
bloodshed.  He added that a solution was not within the purview of an 
Arab League Summit meeting but rather through bringing "the Security 
Council to make decisions to put a stop to the [Israeli] aggression." 
 Belkhadem characterized the "Israeli aggression" as "unacceptable and 
unjustifiable." 
 
¶3.  (U) MFA separately released a statement July 23 calling on the 
international community to "abandon its silence of complicity in which 
it has taken refuge" and "condemn without complacency the Israeli 
aggression against Lebanon."  The statement, which made reference to 
recent remarks given in New York by Algeria's permanent representative 
to the UN, Youcef Yousfi, called for "imposing an unconditional 
immediate cease-fire" in order to find a "fair and lasting" solution to 
the crisis in the Middle East. 
 
DEMONSTRATIONS EXPECTED AROUND THE COUNTRY, 
BUT NOT IN ALGIERS, OVER THE WEEKEND 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) While post is unaware of any demonstrations or rallies planned 
for the local July 27-28 weekend (see Ref A) in the capital, Embassy 
contacts report that the main political parties are expected to organiz 
rallies and demonstrations in cities around the country.  (Note:  Under 
the Emergency Law, demonstrations are not allowed in the capital but ar 
permitted elsewhere.  End Note.) 
 
INDEPENDENT PRESS CALLS FOR BOYCOTT OF PRESS EVENT 
ABOARD VISITING COAST GUARD VESSEL 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post also notes that a long list of journalists signed a 
petition, as reported in the July 24 press, calling for a boycott of 
the press conference scheduled to take place July 27 near Algiers aboar 
the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Northland in "solidarity with Lebanon and 
Palestine...to denounce...the Israeli aggression against the Lebanese 
people."  State media have told PAO that they will participate in the 
press conference, but it appears likely that the independent media will 
largely respect the boycott and stay away from the event.
