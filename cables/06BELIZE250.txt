¶1.  (U) Per reftel A, in response to post's inquiry, the 
Government of Belize (GOB) indicates that it will not send a 
delegation to the Sixth Regular Session of CICTE in Bogota, 
Columbia.  GOB did send Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the

year. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs North American Desk 
officer Aisha Borland, Ministry of Home Affairs National 
Security Coordinator Rhea Rodgers, and Ministry of Home 
Affairs Administrative Officer Errol Gentle cited recent 
directives of GOB cutting back travel to short-term 
conferences (Note. Defined locally as less than 3 days. End 
Note). Gentle stated that GOB officers are encouraged to 
seek other financial support to attend such events, and the 
host, OAS, was not able to provide funding.
