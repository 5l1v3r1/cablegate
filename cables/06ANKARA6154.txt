¶1.  SUMMARY: Turkey's MFA welcomed the U.S. proposal on an 
environment initiative with BSEC (Ref A) and supported the concept 
in principle, as part of a positive message on BSEC potential for 
bringing broader Black Sea countries together to discuss critical 
issues.  MFA's BSEC point person told us that the meeting of BSEC's 
Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Moscow on November 1 
would be too early to introduce a new initiative.  Rather, the 
initiative should be worked and fleshed out in BSEC's Environment 
Working Group.  End Summary.

Environment Critical - Work through Working Group 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2.  MFA DDG Ahmet Asim Arar, the GOT's working level BSEC 
coordinator, told us that environment was a critical area for Black 
Sea cooperation.  Welcoming the U.S. initiative - and welcoming the 
U.S. actively using its new observer status, he said that Turkey 
could be supportive, but would need to evaluate details of the 
resolution, including financing aspects, and consult within the 
environment working group.  Noting that Turkey was the coordinator 
of this working group through the end of 2007, Arar stated that it 
would be useful to have a concrete proposal for the next working 
group meeting, tentatively targeted for next March.  In the 
meantime, he promised to consult with Serbia on its work program for 
its Chairmanship, which would start on November 1, followed by 
Turkey's six months later. 
 
¶3.  GOT MFA Environment Department Head Namik Erpul was also 
supportive of the U.S. environment initiative, promising to consult 
with other countries.  He noted the importance of broader Black Sea 
countries working together to grapple with the challenge of serious 
pollution in the Black Sea.  Erpul stressed the need for 
coordination with initiatives already underway under auspices of the 
EU (DABLAS - Danube River) and the Black Sea Commission (charged to 
implement the Bucharest Convention on Environment), but agreed that 
BSEC was well placed to be more active in environmental protection. 
 
----------------- 
Revitalizing BSEC 
----------------- 
 
¶4.  Noting that BSEC was still a relatively young organization, Arar 
emphasized the enormous possibilities for action on critical issues. 
 Turkey is eager to find ways to revitalize BSEC as part of its 
six-month chairmanship starting in May next year, which would also 
coincide with the 15th anniversary summit.  Arar noted that Greece 
and Turkey were working together constructively on revitalization, 
pointing out that the combination of the new Greek Secretary General 
Leonidas Chrysanthopoulos and his Turkish deputy Murat Sungar had 
been a positive development.  Arar was realistic about the 
challenges of the disparate group that included some countries with 
fragile relations.  He noted the plethora of agreements and MOU's 
that were not effectively implemented or enforced.  He held out hope 
for the BSEC reform process, which would include empowering the 
Committee of Senior Officials.  Arar noted the challenge of 
financing in BSEC, observing that some countries were not paying 
dues.  He hoped that the project development fund could be expanded 
to be more meaningful. 
 
¶5.  COMMENT: Arar was much more positive about BSEC with us than 
some previous interlocutors at MFA.  Turkey holds a special pride of 
authorship in advancing its BSEC vision, while acknowledging the 
disparate interests and conflicts embodied in the group. 
Environmental protection is an obvious target for the U.S. to seek 
to productively use its new observer status, but it will have to 
work patiently within the BSEC structure.
