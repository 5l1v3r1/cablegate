On October 29, we passed the UNSC Resolution 1267

Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and Organized Crime.  No 
substantive response was received, but, per established 
procedure regarding UNSC designations, the MFA will follow 
its routine procedures of notifying Costa Rican banking 
oversight agencies and coordinating with Interpol.
