SUBJECT:  USAID Acting Administrator Meeting with State Minister of 
Humanitarian Affairs in Khartoum 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  On October 24, USAID Acting Administrator Alonzo 
Fulgham and Acting Assistant Administrator for USAID's Bureau for 
Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/DCHA) Susan 
Reichle met with State (Deputy) Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, 
H.E. Dr. Abdel Bagi El-Geilani as part of an October 24 to 27 
delegation visit to Sudan.  Discussions centered on NGO security, 
disposition of expelled non-governmental organization (NGO) assets, 
and Sudanization.  End summary.

SECURITY 
-------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) USAID Acting Administrator Alonzo Fulgham began the meeting 
thanking the Minister for his efforts to facilitate humanitarian 
work in Sudan.  The Acting Administrator expressed concern regarding 
the recent kidnapping of an International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) international staff member and highlighted the fact that 
impunity for the abductors impinges on security and impedes 
humanitarian work.  The State Minister replied that the Government 
of Sudan (GOS) condemns the abductions and opined that as long as 
people in Darfur are poor, illiterate, and armed, such kidnappings 
would continue.  The State Minister later noted that ICRC had 
received a phone call from the kidnapped staff member but that no 
money had been demanded to date.  (Note: International media sources 
also indicate no ransom demand as yet for the ICRC kidnapping.  End 
note.)  He said that the GOAL kidnapping took a long time to resolve 
because no ransom was paid (Note: October 26 press reports indicate 
that the Minister had said that money was paid to "facilitate" the 
work of mediators for the release of the GOAL staff, held captive 
over 100 days. End note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) The State Minister proposed that the GOS develop an 
infrastructure of "smart intelligence" surrounding NGO guesthouses 
and offices, including a protective eye of unarmed guards.  (Note: 
This is likely a reference to increasing National Intelligence and 
Security Service (NISS) presence near NGO compounds.  End note.) 
The State Minister has traveled to El Fasher to discuss the matter 
with humanitarian agencies.  The State Minister relayed that UN 
African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) and Red Cross 
representatives had agreed with the proposal.  In addition, the GOS 
has appealed to the local administration to mobilize and highlight 
the issue of kidnapping in tribal meetings, urging the groups to 
collectively tackle the wave of abductions.  The State Minister 
indicated that the GOS would work to bring the kidnappers to 
punishment by all means. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The State Minister further opined that the solution to the 
kidnapping lies in development of the area and that current 
humanitarian operations create dependency.  The State Minister 
stated that development is possible in Darfur, as the area is 
stable, with only banditry continuing to create problems.  The State 
Minister further asserted that internally displaced persons (IDPs) 
are returning voluntarily due to the improved security and that the 
remaining challenge will be to determine how to keep returnees in 
their villages. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Following earlier meetings in which negative press about 
NGOs was discussed (see reftel), Acting Administrator Fulgham asked 
the State Minister to describe GOS efforts to combat negative media 
messages.  The State Minister stated that his role is to highlight 
international NGO work and that his office is open to promoting 
positive messages in the press.

BUREAUCRATIC IMPEDIMENTS AND ASSET DISPOSITION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (SBU) Acting Administrator Fulgham relayed NGO concerns regarding 
facilitation of humanitarian work that the GOS had promised but not 
delivered, including handing over expelled NGO assets to new 
affiliate NGOs. The Acting Administrator noted that the GOS had 
agreed to return assets of all U.S.-funded NGOs.  The State Minister 
replied that he had not previously heard that such problems remain 
and that from the GOS perspective, facilitation of humanitarian work 
is on track. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The State Minister further asserted that NGO country 
agreements state that assets brought in to the country by NGOs 
belong to the GOS and that if an NGO is expelled, the assets are 
turned over to the government.  The Government of National Unity is 
 
KHARTOUM 00001236  002 OF 002 
 
 
not involved in the contract between donors and NGOs, which may 
delineate donor expectations regarding asset disposition.  The 
Acting Administrator noted that continued obstruction on this issue, 
with NGOs still lacking access to the assets, reflects poorly upon 
the GOS commitment to move forward with the GOS-U.S. relationship. 
The State Minister replied that the GOS is ready to make assets 
available for affiliate NGOs working in the same areas and 
conducting the same programs as expelled NGOs.  (Note: This 
distinction is not contained in the GOS-USSES agreement and confuses 
the issue, as most affiliate NGOs have redesigned program activities 
and areas due to gap-filling by other NGOs and UN agencies 
post-March 4.  End note.)  Fulgham stated that U.S. Government takes 
seriously any seizure of U.S.-funded assets and will continue to 
follow up on this issue. 
 
------------ 
SUDANIZATION 
------------ 
 
¶8.  (SBU) During a brief mention about the recent push for 
"Sudanization" of humanitarian work, the State Minister noted that 
the Sudanization policy came as a presidential directive and, 
therefore, must be respected, noting that the Ministry of 
Humanitarian Affairs (MoHA) has plans for implementation of the 
directive.  However, the State Minister assured the USAID Acting 
Administrator that further expulsions will not be linked to this 
directive and that, on the contrary, the GOS desires close 
cooperation with international NGOs.  The State Minister also stated 
that many NGOs are present within Sudan and that capacity-building 
is necessary to enable these organizations to conduct the work. 
 
¶9. (U) The delegation cleared this cable prior to departure.
