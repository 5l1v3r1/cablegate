SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON THE EXPORT OF U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES CITING THE CANADIAN 
EXEMPTION 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on transactions citing the 
Canadian exemption for the export of inertial navigation 
units to Canada.  Embassy is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Under ITAR 126.5 (Canadian Exemption), 
certain United States Munitions List (USML) items may be 
exported to Canada without a license.  Some items on USML 
Category VIII - which includes inertial navigation units - 
may be subject to Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) 
restrictions and may require a license depending on commodity 
specification and type.  DDTC requests this check based on 
vague description of commodity and end-use in export filing. 
 
¶4. ACTION OTTAWA: Mission Canada is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate L-3 Communications officials to 
obtain all relevant details regarding the export of inertial 
navigation units to Canada citing the Canadian exemption, 
including exact commodity description and technical 
parameters for performance and capability, number, type, 
dollar value, and serial number of items.  (See paragraph 5 
for details of export, including filer identification and 
shipping reference numbers.) 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--What were the exact United States Munitions List (USML) 
articles exported to you on June 27th, November 28th, and 
November 30th of 2007, and May 23rd 2008?  (Automated Export 
System (AES) filing data provides the following information, 
"inertial navigation unit".)  Please provide detail on model, 
type and technical specifications. 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will L-3 
Communications be the sole end-user and retain positive 
control over the inertial navigation units at all times? 
Will they be transferred to other end-users in Canada or 
re-exported? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
