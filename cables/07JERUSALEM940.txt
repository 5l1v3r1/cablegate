¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Following a new, Egyptian-brokered 
ceasefire agreed to at 1500 local on May 19, internal 
Palestinian fighting has subsided to sporadic levels. One 
Palestinian was killed in Fatah-Hamas clashes May 18 (prior 
to the ceasefire).  25 Palestinians were killed by Israeli 
air strikes and tank fire since the evening of May 18, and 
Palestinian militants fired 57 Qassam rockets into Israel 
during this period.  End summary. 
 
Intra-Palestinian Clashes Subside 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At 1500 local on May 19, Fatah and Hamas 
representatives agreed to a renewed ceasefire commitment 
under the auspices of the Egyptians, represented locally by 
MG Burhan Hamad.  Since the ceasefire took effect, 
interfactional violence has declined to sporadic levels.  The 
ceasefire agreement established a high-level follow-up 
committee to ensure compliance.  The committee is made up of 
Fatah representatives Rawhi Fatuh and Gaza presidential 
security advisor Abd al-Razaq Mujaydah; Hamas representatives 
PM Ismayil Haniyah and PLC member Khalil al-Haya and 
PIJ/PFLP/DFLP/minor faction representatives.  The National 
and Islamic Forces (NIF) continue to monitor factional 
fighting at roadblocks and record violations, according to 
Gaza security contacts. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Prior to the latest ceasefire, one Palestinian died 
in interfactional clashes, and another died from previously 
sustained injuries. 
 
Qassams and Israeli Air Strikes Increase 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Palestinian militants fired 57 Qassam rockets into 
Israel from 1600 (local) on May 18 to 1400 on May 21, 
resulting in property damage but no deaths and three minor 
injuries.  Israeli air strikes and tank fire directed at 
Hamas and PIJ leadership and Qassam teams killed 25 
Palestinians during this time period. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Palestinian security contacts and Arabic-language 
press report that an IAF airstrike on Hamas PLC member Khalil 
al-Haya's home killed 8 Palestinians (including 7 members of 
al-Haya's family; al-Haya himself was not present) late on 
May 20, and another strike killed 4 PIJ members traveling in 
a vehicle in northern Gaza on May 21.  Of the 25 Palestinians 
killed in Israeli attacks since May 18, Hamas has claimed 6 
as its members, while PIJ acknowledged the 4 killed May 21 as 
its militants. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The factions maintain a wary eye on the each 
others' activities, but their public statements and 
activities are now focused on Israeli attacks, which most 
Gazans perceive as a common threat and which make 
intra-Palestinian violence politically unacceptable while 
they continue.
