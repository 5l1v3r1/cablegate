REF: STATE 75702 
 
(SBU) Polchief discussed reftel points July 16 with Klaus 
Famira, MFA European Correspondent.  Famira offered the 
following information on the GAERC agenda items: 
 
-- Iran Sanctions: Famira said participants at the GAERC will 
discuss a set of proposed, tougher sanctions on Iran, but he 
did not expect them to reach agreement on the measures 
because member states remain divided.  He acknowledged that 
Austria is among a minority of member states resisting the 
measures.  But he averred that as long as there was no 
consensus, the GOA was not under pressure to change its 
position. (Note: Septel will report on subsequent exchange on 
Iran between U/S Burns and Austrian State Secretary Winkler. 
End Note). 
 
-- Somalia: FMs will discuss how the EU can implement UNSC 
sanctions.  They will also discuss how to promote stability 
in the country. 
 
-- Chad: The EU mission in Chad is scheduled to end March 15. 
 GAERC participants will discuss the current mission and the 
need to begin preparing for a transition to a follow-on UN 
mission. 
 
-- Zimbabwe: Representatives will approve additions to 
existing EU sanctions that will expand the freezing of assets 
and add to the list of individuals under travel bans.  Travel 
bans will be expanded to prohibit travel for participation in 
meetings with EU bodies. 
 
-- Middle East: Special Envoy Blair will brief ministers on 
the situation in the West Bank and Gaza. 
 
-- Western Balkans: The GOA will brief participants on a 
program that provides student visas to about 200 Serbs a year 
for study in Austrian universities. 
 
-- Transatlantic Relations: There will be a discussion of 
transatlantic relations based on an article jointly written 
by the French, Spanish, and Portuguese FMs and published June 
14 in Le Monde.
