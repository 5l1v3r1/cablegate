¶1. (SBU) The Canadian Department of Justice on November 3 proposed 
amending Canadian regulations in order to include offenses against 
the Copyright Act under Proceeds of Crime provisions.  This change 
will allow law enforcement officials to seize assets that were paid 
for with money gained from activity in violation of Canada's 
Copyright Act.  It will act as an incentive for law enforcement to 
investigate copyright crime and a disincentive to commit these 
crimes.  According to Chris Grey, Director of the Canadian 
Intellectual Property Council, while this is forward progress, the 
Government's action does nothing to address industries' key issues 
of copyright modernization and improved enforcement and is only a 
small step forward. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) The full text of the proposed amendments can be found at:

¶3. (SBU) Comment: Amending these regulations is an easy and 
non-controversial action for the Government of Canada and we agree 
that the amendments, while positive, are underwhelming.  This small 
step does not change the pressing need for the Government to 
quickly act on prior commitments to implement the WIPO internet 
treaties and increase Canadian law enforcement officers' 
authorities to stop the flow of counterfeit goods.  End Comment.
