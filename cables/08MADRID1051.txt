 ¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Luis Gomez Nogueira, the Chief of 
Disarmament in the MFA's DG for Strategic Issues and 
Terrorism, has indicated to Post that Spain, while wanting to 
make known several observations and suggestions about the 
draft text, would co-sponsor the reftel resolution. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Gomez said Spain had no objection in principle to 
the draft as it exists, but the GOS nevertheless has several 
suggestions for the USG to consider.  He claimed that the 
wording of current US draft in 2008 had been based on the 
original draft resolution submitted in 2005 (A/C.1/60/L.1, 
dated October 5, 2005) rather than the revised version 
(A/C.1/60/L.1/Rev.1, dated October 27, 2005) which Spain 
co-sponsored and had actually been passed by 163-0-10, as 
described in Reftels. Gomez suggested it made sense for the 
current US draft to be based on the version that actually 
passed and encouraged the USG to do so. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Gomez offered several small changes to the current 
text that he said were part of the final 2005 version and 
should be represented in the new 2008 resolution. In the 
third paragraph of the preamble, he suggested adding the word 
"peace" to the end of the sentence, so that it reads 
"...regional and global peace, security, and stability." In 
paragraph 5 of the Resolution, he recommended adding the 
wording "with those obligations" so that it reads, "... back 
into compliance with those obligations." As a last item, 
Gomez indicated that the GOS would prefer to continue 
including the final paragraph of the 2005 version as last 
paragraph of the current resolution. That paragraph would 
read: "7. Decides to be remain seized of the matter." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: While Gomez acknowledged to PolOff by phone 
that the suggestions and word changes were not important, the 
GOS did make a point of including them in the fax that 
conveyed GOS intent to co-sponsor the Resolution. Embassy 
Madrid recommends that the GOS be given advance notice if the 
USG decides not to include the revisions in the final draft.
