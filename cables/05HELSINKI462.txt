¶1.  (U)  Poloff delivered Ref A demarche to officials in the 
MFA's Global Affairs Bureau, noting that Secretary Rice's 
participation in the Ministerial meeting reflects the 
importance the U.S. attaches to the Community of Democracies. 
 As of April 20, the MFA was still unsure if any officials 
from Helsinki would attend the meeting.  However, Finland's 
Ambassador to Chile, Pekka Korvenheimo, and the Political 
Counselor at the Finnish Embassy in Santiago, Pirjo 
Suomela-Chowdhury, have confirmed their attendance.  The 
Global Affairs Bureau did not indicate that there were any 
specific issues or projects that Finland would put forward 
during the meeting.

Ref B, we have shared the concept paper on election standards 
with the Finns, and encouraged their support, noting the U.S. 
and Finnish governments shared commitment to promotion of 
democracy around the world.
