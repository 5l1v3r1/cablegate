SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: PRE-LICENSE CHECK: RIRT (RUSSIAN 
INSTITUTE OF RADIONAVIGATION AND TIME), ST. 
PETERSBURG, RUSSIA, D374598 
 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, RIRT, 
St. Petersburg, Russia. The company is listed on BIS 
license application D374598 as the ultimate consignee 
of environmental test chamber with interior dimensions 
of 36X36X36. These items are controlled for national 
security and missile technology reasons under ECCN 
1B018. The licensee is Abbess Instruments and Systems, 
Inc., 70 Bartzak Dr., Holliston, MA 01746. 
 
¶3. On July 4, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted a pre- 
license check at the offices of Russian Institute of 
Radionavigation and Time (RIRT), St. Petersburg, 
Russia. The export control team met with Oleg Osipov, 
Chief Engineer. 
 
¶4. RIRT was founded in 1957 to study long-distance 
navigation systems automation for marine and aviation 
use.  The institute developed the precision timing 
apparatus for major radio navigation networks for the 
Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, including 
"Alfa" (similar to the U.S. "OMEGA" low-frequency 
aviation navigation system), "Chaika" (similar to the 
U.S. "LORAN" low-frequency marine/aviation navigation 
system), "Parus" (similar to "TRANSIT" satellite 
geolocation system) and GLONASS (similar to GPS). RIRT 
has been working in joint programs with the United 
States since 1991, including the synchronization of 
LORAN and Chaika systems as well as integrating 
GLONASS technology into GPS equipment.  In addition, 
the company produces GLONASS/GPS receivers and other 
navigational equipment.  The institute employs 900 at 
a facility located in the city of St. Petersburg. 
 
¶5. RIRT will utilize the commodity in reftel to test 
satellite components, circuit boards and equipment 
prior to installation and launch.  RIRT produces 
precision timing instrumentation for the GLONASS 
system, geophysical survey and telecommunications 
satellites.  The chamber will be used to test boards 
in vacuum conditions similar to those encountered in 
orbit.  The system will not be used for other 
purposes, nor does RIRT plan on removing or using the 
vacuum pump for other than the purposes stated above. 
RIRT plans to purchase two additional test chambers as 
well.  Mr. Osipov noted that a European model chamber 
would have been modular, requiring the pump to be 
mated to the chamber.  The decision to buy the U.S. 
built chamber was the fact that it was integrated. 
 
¶6. The RIRT facility is a closed area, requiring a 
security clearance for entry.  All visitors are 
escorted, and the building has 24-hour security 
services.  Access is controlled by a proximity card 
system, and employees may not remove equipment from 
the building without clearing the movement with 
security.  Seven specialists will have access to the 
equipment.  Mr. Osipov is personally responsible for 
all the lab equipment, maintains the logbook of 
equipment, and conducts yearly inventories.  Mr. 
Osipov was made aware of the anticipated license 
conditions by the exporter. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Russian Institute 
of Radionavigation and Time (RIRT), St. Petersburg, 
Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
