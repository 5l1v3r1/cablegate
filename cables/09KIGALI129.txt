REF: STATE 18282 
 
Charge delivered reftel demarche on the Human Rights Council 
and draft outcome document for the Durban Review Conference 
to IO Director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ben 
Rutsinga on February 27.  Rutsinga listened attentively to 
reftel talking points on USG concern over the draft document, 
and asked what the USG wished Rwanda to do.  Charge reviewed 
reftel para 9 points a-e and asked that Rwanda do what it 
could to moderate the draft text, pointing out that in the 
lead-up to the 2001 WCAR itself, Rwanda's Permanent Mission 
had played an extraordinary role working with the U.S. on 
similar issues.  Rutsinga pledged to discuss the outcome 
document with Rwanda's ambassador in Geneva; he was unaware 
of the depth of the Rwandan delegation's involvement to date 
in that draft text.
