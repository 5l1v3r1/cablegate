REF: SECSTATE 33709 
 
Poland committed to vote on Kosovo membership before May 5 
and is leaning toward a favorable position, but still may 
formally cast an abstaining vote.  DCM delivered reftel 
demarche on April 9 to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MFA) 
Political Director Witold Sobkow.  Sobkow noted that Poland 
has recognized Kosovo and is supportive of Kosovo's bid in 
principal, but said no decision had been made.  Acting Econ 
Counselor later met with Michal Baj, Director of 
International Relations at the Ministry of Finance.  Baj 
reassured us that Poland would cast their votes by May 5.  He 
strongly believes that Poland will vote in favor of Kosovo 
membership, but is waiting for an opinion from the MFA. 
While Poland is supportive of Kosovo's membership bids, the 
Poles are sensitive to Serbian pressure, particularly because 
Serbia is in their constituency group at the IMF and has 
threatened to leave the group over the issue.  The Poles 
believe the Swiss may abstain for that reason also.  As of 
April 17, the MFA still had not expressed an opinion.  Post 
will continue to follow up with the MFA and MOF and report 
any decision.
