Media Reaction - Western Hemisphere: Cuba, governance 
 
Title- "Darkness at noon" in Cuba 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-10) states: 
"....seven decades after the infamous Moscow Processes [purges] that 
allowed Josef Stalin to exterminate imaginary enemies of the 
Bolshevik elite, here the same pattern resurfaces on the unfortunate 
island of Castro, with the only difference being that in this case, 
the purged ones remain alive, bearing the humiliation of the farce 
they agreed to take part in to 'continue serving the 
Revolution'......in the Castro brothers gerontocracy there is 
nothing to be remodeled in politics or in economy. Because there is 
not a political life or a modern economy.  We must await the death 
of the last of them [Castro brothers] to see what comes next." 
 
Title- Purges show new challenges to Cuban regime 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Economico (3-10) says: "....In 
Cuba internal problems also mirror external challenges.  With Barack 
Obama's arrival to power in the archrival U.S. and his gestures of a 
change in U.S. relations with Cuba, Raul Castro will [probably] be 
in an uncommon position....- [to see]  a proposal for peace and 
understanding [between Cuba and the U.S].  This is something 
absolutely encouraging, but equally dangerous for the Cuban 
bureaucrats, that they maintain a majority of their popularity 
thanks to the memories of the attempted Cuban invasion [Bay of 
Pigs], the odious economic embargo and the antagonistic political 
myopia from U.S presidents in relation to the island.  This way, a 
"closure" of the regime, unveiled by the purging [of Cuban 
officials], would be a preparation for the dialogue with the U.S. 
and not a negation".
