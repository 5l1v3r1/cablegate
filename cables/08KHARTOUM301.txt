SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: SPECIAL ENVOY WILLIAMSON IN SUDAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The media reaction to Special Envoy Williamson's 
visit to Sudan was a rollercoaster ride, swinging wildly up and down 
but ultimately ending up where it began.  Mirroring the GOS's hopes 
for the trip, the press coverage began as cautiously optimistic. 
After the first day's impromptu press conference at the MFA, the 
press heralded a "breakthrough" as the Foreign Minister announced 
"normalization of relations" within "4-6 months."  The next day, 
however, State Department spokesman Tom Casey's remarks in 
Washington quelled the media's discussion of the "timetable."  Press 
coverage in Khartoum waned as the Special Envoy visited Darfur and 
the south.  Over the weekend and this Sunday, as the Special Envoy 
finished his trip back in Khartoum, media coverage returned to the 
cautious optimism it had begun with. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On February 26, the media's optimism surrounding Foreign 
Minister Deng Alor's comments about "normalization of relations" 
between the U.S. and Sudan ruled the airwaves and newspaper 
headlines.  Most of the local Arabic papers in Khartoum, including 
Al-Sahafa, Al-Sudani, and Al-Rai Al-Aam, zeroed in on Alor's 
statements, announcing "a return of a U.S. ambassador, the lifting 
of... sanctions imposed on Sudan, and the clearing of Sudan from the 
State list of terror sponsors." 
 
¶3. (U) Of particular note, however, was a column by Baha'el-deen 
Eisa, a respected senior reporter at the liberal Al-Sudani daily, 
who was somewhat prescient in pointing out that neither the Foreign 
Minister nor the Special Envoy had elaborated on exactly what steps 
were to be taken in bringing about "normal relations." 
 
¶4. (U) February 27 brought forward accusations that the U.S. was 
"reneging on its promise" of normalization after State Department 
spokesman Tom Casey's remarks contradicted those of the Sudanese 
Foreign Minister.  The press reaction, mirroring the government's, 
turned decidedly more negative.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali 
Al-Saddiq was quoted by several papers as saying "the Special Envoy 
does not carry with him a 'special wand' that will resolve all the 
crises."  In addition, Manahil Hammad, a commentator for the 
virulently anti-U.S. newspaper Al-Intibaha, dwelled on the low 
points of U.S.-Sudanese relations while Hamza Baloul, a columnist 
for the Al-Ahdath dahly newspaper, took ao e#onomic"jab,$uggastingm

their reporting of the Special Envoy's visit, with most papers 
skipping editorial commentary.  Of note, however, was an opinion 
piece by Ayub Mohamed Abbas in the ordinarily anti-U.S. Akhir Lahza 
daily newspaper, in which the writer reflected positively on the 
Special Envoy's visit.  Saying it "represented a shift in U.S. 
policies" and that "the Special Envoy seemed keen to contribute to 
efforts to realize peace in Darfur," Abbas put forward support for 
"the political process" and recognized Williamson's focus on 
"pushing for the full deployment of the a hybrid force."
