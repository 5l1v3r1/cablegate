¶1.  Summary. As of mid-day January 6 there are three 
confirmed deaths resulting from bird flu.  The third death 
has not confirmed as H5N1, however the three positive cases 
yesterday have now been confirmed as H5N1. European Union 
and WHO teams arrived in Turkey January 5 and travelled to 
the affected region on January 6.  The Agriculture Ministry 
continues to be proactive in culling and quarantining, 
including in areas of suspected-but unconfirmed-outbreaks. 
Prime Minister Erdogan has denied the swirl of accusations 
of government mishandling and said the Government will use 
mosque sermons and schools to get the public awareness 
message out. End Summary. 
 
--------------- 
Cases in Humans 
--------------- 
 
¶2.  The GOT Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed a third 
death from AI in Turkey: an 11-year old who was a member of 
the same family in which two members had previously died 
(reftel).  Contrary to press reports, the MOH official told 
us the third case has so far tested negative for AI, 
however.  Another family's separate, fourth case of illness 
who is still living, as well as the two earlier death cases, 
have now been confirmed as having the N1 strain of the H5 
virus.  The MOH official specified that the standard 
procedure is for the samples to be tested locally as well as 
sent to London for further testing. 
 
¶3. The MOH official said there are 12 cases under 
observation, all in Van (far-eastern Turkey, near the 
Iranian border).  All 12 of these cases have been treated 
with Tamiflu. Two of the death cases were also treated with 
Tamiflu but the treatments were begun late in the 
progression of the illness.  The MOH official added that 
there are other outpatient cases but they may be "panic 
cases" unrelated to AI.  The MOH official also said samples 
from the 12 cases under observation have been sent to a 
laboratory in Istanbul but no results as of mid-day local 
time.  (We received conflicting information from the 
laboratory itself which said it had received samples from 
only 4 cases.) Results are expected late today local time. 
 
¶4. Turkish media coverage has been extensive and 
sensationalistic, including exaggerated reports of 
additional outbreaks.  In an effort to reassure the public, 
on the morning of January 6, Prime Minister Erdogan, 
commenting on the situation for the first time, denied 
allegations-increasingly heard in the Turkish press-of a 
slow or inadequate GOT response. Erdogan called on the 
public to report sick animals and said the Government would 
use the Government-controlled Friday sermon in mosques, as 
well as schools, to get the public awareness message out. 
Nonetheless, most Turks remain furious over what they 
perceive to be government misrepresentation of the initial 
facts and subsequent inadequate efforts to contain and 
resolve the problem. 
 
¶5. Press has reported that affected villages have been 
 
ANKARA 00000104  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
quarantined.  However, it is our understanding that only in 
Dougbeyazit-the site of the deaths-have there been 
restrictions on movement of people.  The authorities have 
requested that poultry farmers remain in Dogubeyazit. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Poultry Outbreaks and Government Actions 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Over 4,000 birds have been culled in the confirmed 
outbreak areas. There has been more culling as precautionary 
measures in other areas, so in total over 5,000 birds have 
been culled.  Agriculture Minister Eker announced that 
animal quarantine measures are in place in all provinces 
from which they received notification of sick birds, without 
waiting for test results.  He said animal quarantine 
measures were in effect in eight provinces with confirmed or 
suspicious cases: Van, Igdir, Mus, Agri, Ardahan, Erzurum, 
Sanliurfa, and Yozgat.  (Note: All of these provinces-- 
except Yozgat--are in far eastern Turkey.  The test results 
are expected later on January 6 for the cases in Yozgat, 
which is in central Anatolia, approximately 200 km east of 
Ankara.  End Note.) 
 
¶7. In the areas under animal quarantine, entry and exit of 
all animals is prohibited. Agriculture Ministry and traffic 
police officials are inspecting vehicles at the borders of 
the affected towns in order to prevent transportation of 
live animals from the affected towns. 
 
------------------------- 
International Cooperation 
------------------------- 
 
¶8. Experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), the 
European Union (EU) Center for Communicable Disease and a 
European Commission veterinary expert (OIE/FAO) arrived in 
Ankara January 5, met with GOT officials and are currently 
in the affected region in eastern Turkey. We will get more 
detailed information about these meetings with the GOT and 
intended actions later on January 6. 
 
---------- 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
¶9. January 6 is the last official business day for the 
Government of Turkey prior to the 10-day Kurban Bayram 
holiday.  However, both the GOT and this mission will 
continue ongoing efforts and we will provide Washington with 
regular updates on developments here.
