REF: STATE 1923 
 
¶1. The USG provides no direct funding to Zimbabwe's central 
government.  But USG funding does support provision of assistance to 
specific elements of the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ).  This 
includes substantial assistance under the PEPFAR program to 
government-led efforts combating HIV/AIDS, assistance through an NGO 
to the Prime Minister's office, assistance through the UNDP to the 
effort to reform the constitution, and assistance through partners 
to the national legislature.  Although assistance to Zimbabwe is 
subject to restrictions under U.S. legislation, all activities are 
covered by existing authorities or appropriate waivers. 
 
¶2. Formal dollarization of Zimbabwe's economy in 2009 significantly 
improved the GOZ's fiscal transparency. 
Now that the Zimbabwe dollar no longer circulates, the Reserve Bank 
of Zimbabwe (RBZ) cannot finance GOZ expenditures, thus forcing the 
Ministry of Finance to operate on a cash basis.  This has eliminated 
the ad-hoc fiscal habits that previously made GOZ spending almost 
entirely opaque. 
 
¶3. The demise of the Zimdollar also ended the large-scale 
quasi-fiscal activities of the RBZ, which in some years has exceeded 
the GOZ's official budget.  While the RBZ did direct financial 
support to some state-owned enterprises in 2009, this amounted to a 
small fraction of total GOZ expenditure.  Furthermore, the GOZ has 
reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the details of 
this activity, which has since ceased. 
 
¶4. The GOZ's budget is available to the public.  Following the 
Finance Minister's annual presentation of the budget to Parliament, 
the GOZ publishes estimates of expenditure by agency, broken down 
into major categories.  The published budget also includes revenue 
estimates by source.  Daily newspapers also publish the budget 
estimates, and the Ministry of Finance posts them on its website. 
 
¶5. As long as the GOZ is confined to cash budgeting, the published 
budget serves as a reliable upper bound for actual expenditure. 
Revenue estimates in the 2010 budget may be somewhat optimistic, but 
the GOZ's interim public reports on revenue performance over the 
course of the year are likely to be reliable.  Management of revenue 
flows through state-owned enterprises remains a concern, however. 
The Ministry of Finance does not have direct control over all 
enterprises in which the GOZ owns shares, and financial reports 
published by these companies are not always complete, timely, or 
reliable. 
 
¶6. Beginning in March 2009, Zimbabwe's transitional government has 
worked to restore order to public-sector expenditure.  The Ministry 
of Finance, in particular, has been broadly successful in 
re-asserting formal control over the work of the RBZ.  In addition, 
the GOZ has had external support that has improved fiscal 
transparency.  This has included technical support from the IMF, 
which resumed in May 2009.  Additionally, from the African 
Development Bank and through a multi-donor trust fund administered 
QDevelopment Bank and through a multi-donor trust fund administered 
by the World Bank, the GOZ receives technical support to improve its 
public financial management system.  These efforts include 
installation of new budgeting software and staff training.
