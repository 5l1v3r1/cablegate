SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: NCP REFUSAL TO ATTEND ADDIS MINISTERIAL 
WITH SECRETARY RICE 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Khartoum daily newspapers reported December 5 
the refusal of the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) to accept 
the Secretary's invitation to meet in Addis Ababa, adding that the 
NCP "does not object" to the American effort.  All reports noted 
that the SPLM had accepted the U.S. invitation.  The 
government-sponsored media expressed "regret" that President Bashir 
and his deputies are too busy in Khartoum dealing with pressing 
national issues, including implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement (CPA), the very subject of the Addis meeting.  Opposition 
papers said the U.S. had "failed" to bring the parties together. 
Several papers noted the discrepancy evident in the NCP's initial 
insistence that it had not received an invitation. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Most of Khartoum's daily newspapers had front page coverage 
of the NCP's decision not to attend the Addis Ababa Ministerial with 
Secretary Rice, noting that the Government extended its "regrets" to 
 
SIPDIS 
the parties involved.  Khartoum daily Akhbar Al Youm quoted Mutrif 
Siddig, MFA Under Secretary, as saying there was no way for the 
President and his two deputies, Vice presidents Kiir and Taha, to 
attend as they were presently involved in resolving outstanding CPA 
issues.  Siddig was quoted as saying the NCP had no objections in 
principle to the U.S. initiative.  However, the paper also quoted 
Ambassador Al Dirdeiri Mohamed Ahmed (one of the NCP's CPA 
negotiators and an Embassy contact) as saying that the Government 
does object to addressing the crisis outside the CPA's bilateral 
framework.  Like many papers, Akhbar Al Youm specified that the SPLM 
delegation in Addis was to be led by Pagan Amum, and would include 
Deng Alor and Kosti Manibe, among others. 
 
¶3. (U) Daily Al Rai Al Aam likewise noted the NCP's excuse that it 
was "preoccupied with many national concerns."  The paper said the 
Secretary would be discussing other international Great Lakes issues 
 
SIPDIS 
besides the CPA. 
 
¶4. (U) Al Sudani's headline states that "The U.S. Initiative Failed 
to Gather the Two Partners in Addis Ababa."  The paper notes the 
NCP's "regrets," but also quotes comments by CDA Fernandez.  It says 
the CDA "declined to comment" on the NCP's regrets, but that he said 
the U.S. seeks "to safeguard the peaceful process and progress in 
Sudan."  In addition, Al Sudani noted the SPLM's stated intention to 
explain to the IGAD states in Addis its views on the causes of the 
current stalemate with the NCP.  It said "the SPLM will work for 
urging these states to contribute in rescuing the CPA." 
 
¶5.  (U) Al Sudani notes that initially the NCP had insisted publicly 
that it had never received an invitation to the Addis conference. 
It then quotes CDA Fernandez as confirming that invitations had been 
extended to both parties. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  In the overall press coverage of the Addis 
Ministerial, the NCP does not come off well.  While some newspapers 
seem to accept the ruling party's explanation of its decision not to 
attend, the NCP's initial denial that it had received an invitation 
made its later public excuses less credible.  The NCP's refusal to 
attend the Addis Ministerial is consistent with its strategy to 
prevent any "internationalization" of CPA implementation, and to 
insist that the impasse with the SPLM is a bilateral one best 
addressed within the framework of the CPA.
