¶1.   THE NOVEMBER 11 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
    WEEKLY "THE SUNDAY MAIL" CARRIED A LENGTHY OP-ED PIECE 
    BY OLLEY MARUMA CENTERING ON THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN 
    AGAINST TERROR.  UNDER HEADLINE "WAR WILL NOT SOLVE 
    CURRENT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WOES," MARUMA ARGUES: 
 
¶2.   "THE CURRENT WAR AND CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN HAS SHOWN 
    BEYOND DOUBT THAT THE U.S. WILL HAVE TO DRASTICALLY 
    CHANGE ITS FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS MANY REGIONS OF THE 
    THIRD WORLD, IF IT IS TO GAIN GENUINE FRIENDS AND 
    ALLIES IN THOSE AREAS. . .  IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW 
    THE AMERICANS WILL CREATE A 'POST-TALIBAN' GOVERNMENT 
    WITHOUT GETTING BOGGED DOWN IN A VIETNAM-STYLE QUAGMIRE 
    IN AFGHANISTAN.  HISTORY HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT THE 
    AFGHAN PEOPLE'S ABHORRENCE OF FOREIGN RULE OR CONTROL 
    RUNS VERY DEEP INDEED.  SHOULD THE AMERICANS OPT THE 
    MOST LOGICAL SOLUTION, INSTALLING A PRO-WESTERN 
    GOVERNMENT IN KABUL, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT 
    GOVERNMENT WILL BE STABLE OR DURABLE. . .  WHATEVER 
    HAPPENS TO AMERICA'S WAR AGAINST AFGHANISTAN, 
    INTRODUCING A NEW ERA OF MCCARTHYISM IN INTERNATIONAL 
    RELATIONS WHERE THERE IS A 'THEM' AGAINST 'US' IS NOT 
    GOING TO ERADICATE THE SCOURGE OF TERRORISM.  NOR WILL 
    IT WIN GENUINE FRIENDS. . .  AS LONG AS WE HAVE SELF- 
    RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE AND NATIONS THAT PROMOTE HATRED AND 
    BIGOTRY AGAINST OTHER NATIONS OR AGAINST CERTAIN 
    RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC GROUPS, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE HATRED 
    AND SENSELESS VIOLENCE AMONGST US; WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE 
    WARS."
