¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "SAVIMBI'S DEATH: A CHANCE FOR 
   PEACE IN ANGOLA," THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE ZIMBABWE 
   MIRROR" DEDICATED ITS MARCH 1 EDITORIAL TO URGING THE 
   GOVERNMENT OF ANGOLA TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DEATH OF 
   UNITA LEADER JONAS SAVIMBI BY PUSHING FOR PEACE. 
   EXCERPTS: 
 
¶2.   ". . .THE DEMISE OF SAVIMBI OFFERS THE PEOPLE OF 
   ANGOLA A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE.  IT IS AN 
   OPPORTUNITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS 
   MUST SEIZE WITHOUT ANY DELAY.  THE INTERNATIONAL 
   COMMUNITY, SOUTHERN AFRICA IN PARTICULAR, CAN 
   CONTRIBUTE IN EFFORTS FOR A LASTING PEACE, BUT IT WILL 
   BE UP TO THE ANGOLANS THEMSELVES TO ENSURE THAT PEACE 
   REMAINS FOREVER.  TO THAT END, PRESIDENT DOS SANTOS 
   WILL HAVE TO SHOW MAGNANIMITY TO THOSE OF HIS SURVIVING 
   FOES.  HE HAS ALREADY MADE STATEMENTS TO THAT EFFECT 
   DURING HIS VISITS TO LISBON AND WASHINGTON THIS WEEK. 
   DEEDS MUST FOLLOW HIS WORDS. . . ."
