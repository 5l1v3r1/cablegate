Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  On November 5, 2006, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) convened a Technical Task Force (TTF) meeting on Avian 
Influenza (AI).  FAO and the Government of National Unity's (GNU) 
Federal Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries (FMARF) are to 
finalize, in coordination with all stakeholders, the nomination of 
the permanent members for the Rapid Response Team (RRT).  The last 
H5N2 positive cases in Juba were reported on November 1, and since 
then no new cases have been reported.  At this time, no new cases of 
AI have been reported in humans or poultry in any of the fifteen 
northern states.  The FAO consultants who visited Juba during 
October drafted an action plan for Southern Sudan with specific 
objectives and activities to be implemented.  At the November 5 
meeting, the TTF reviewed the draft National Guidelines for Poultry 
Vaccination; the final version of the guidelines will be discussed 
at the November 19 TTF meeting.  End Summary. 
 
--------------- 
Outbreak Update 
--------------- 
 
¶2.  On November 5, FAO convened the meeting for the Technical Task 
Force on AI in Khartoum.  No cases were reported from any of the 
poultry farms in the northern states.  The last H5N2 positive cases 
reported from Juba were on the November 1, and since then no new 
cases reported samples.  At this time, no human cases of AI have 
been reported in the country. 
 
¶3.  In late August, the Ministry of Interior's Wildlife 
Administration collected blood samples from dead wild birds in White 
Nile State.  To date, Wildlife Administration authorities have not 
released these samples for testing and analysis.  At the November 5 
meeting, the TTF tasked FMARF to continue making the necessary 
contacts with Wildlife Administration authorities to ensure the 
samples' release.  In addition, FAO indicated willingness to make a 
contribution to cover expenses incurred by the Wildlife 
Administration if reasonable and necessary.

National Guidelines for Poultry Vaccination 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  At the November 5 TTF meeting, the FMARF representative 
presented a draft of the National Guidelines for Poultry 
Vaccination.  The guidelines establish procedures to be followed 
during outbreaks both in households' backyards and poultry farms. 
During outbreaks in households' backyards, localized culling, free 
poultry vaccination, and immediate compensation to the household are 
required.  In poultry farms, poultry is to be culled in the infected 
zone and free vaccination to all poultry in the buffer zone is to be 
provided.  The guidelines state that vaccination should not be 
carried out in non-infected states.  During outbreaks, vaccines are 
to be provided free of charge to households and poultry farms that 
lose poultry and plan to restock.  For broilers - chickens smaller 
than roasters - vaccination is optional and could be carried out at 
cost.  However, new investors to the poultry industry should pay for 
vaccines. 
 
¶5.  The H5N2 vaccine used in Sudan since June 2006 is manufactured 
by Intervet Company.  The vaccine is being used in East Asia, Egypt, 
Hong Kong, Italy, and the Netherlands.  The vaccine reduces the 
shedding of the virus and protection occurs three weeks after 
vaccination.  Three doses of the vaccine are needed per bird. 
According to the guidelines, a stock of vaccines equal to 30 percent 
of the poultry population should be available in the country.  The 
FMARF should have control over national vaccination stocks and 
should provide the vaccination guidelines to states authorities, who 
are responsible for data collection on vaccination rates, 
mortalities, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, bio-security 
measures, and pre- and post-vaccination sero-surveillance results. 
This data should be reported regularly to the FMARF and decision 
makers.

Coordination

¶6.  In coordination with all stakeholders, FAO and FMARF are to 
finalize the nomination of the permanent members of the RRT, which 
will include one representative each from the Federal and State 
ministries of agriculture and health, FMARF, FAO, UN World Health 
Organization (WHO), and Central Veterinary Research Laboratory 
(CVRL).  The main function of the RRT will be to ensure active 
surveillance and guarantee that proper control measures are promptly 
carried out when an outbreak is reported. 
 
----------------- 
USG Contributions 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  The USG consultant seconded to FAO to assist with AI control 
activities returned from Juba after a two-week visit where he 
participated in training for veterinarians from different states of 
Southern Sudan.  The consultant will assist in the establishment and 
training of the RRT.  Another consultant is expected to arrive 
during the second week of November and participate in training of 
communities and poultry farm owners on community-based participatory 
surveillance as the most appropriate and cost effective strategy. 
 
----------------------------- 
Southern Sudan - Preparedness 
----------------------------- 
 
¶8.  The FAO consultants who visited Juba drafted an action plan for 
Southern Sudan.  The plan's objectives is to combat and control the 
spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), prevent the 
introduction Q HPAI into disease-free areas, eradicate HPAI, and 
declare Southern Sudan free of AI.  Detailed activities necessary to 
attain these objectives are outlined in the action plan.  The 
consultants suggested that more coordination between the FMARF and 
the Government of Southern Sudan will be required.
