  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S. POLICY 
 
¶A. "It is no harm to cheer for U.S. healthcare reform" 
 
The international news commercial publication of the People's Daily, 
Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/30)(pg 14): "U.S. President Obama 
has sent a wonderful Christmas gift to 46 million Americans who 
cannot afford health care.  It really deserves our congratulations. 
Obama holds high the banner of healthcare reform for the benefit of 
more poor people.  In the face of the financial crisis, the adverse 
situation it created, the resistance of numerous vested interests 
and the Republicans, Obama's healthcare reform bill was passed by 
the U.S. Senate and House, which was really not that easy.  Obama's 
'health care for all' plan has finally come true.  It reflects the 
U.S. government's 'sense of fairness,' which is well worth 
recognizing.  We do not need to worry about where the money for 
health care reform comes from and what we need is to take good care 
of our own money bag.  The U.S. government's proactive actions have 
no doubt provided a mirror for China's health care reform.  The 
United States' healthcare reform, in essence, is a competition 
between government's fairness and the market's efficiency.  It is 
also a 'political struggle' between ideology and values." 
 
¶B. "If a foreigner violates the law, s/he must be punished like an 
ordinary Chinese people" 
 
The international news commercial publication of the People's Daily, 
Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/30)(pg 14): "Akmal Shaikh, who was 
executed yesterday for drug smuggling, is not the first foreigner 
punished according to Chinese law and will not be the last.  Chinese 
judicial authorities and the public are obviously not prepared for 
the rapid increase in the number of crimes conducted by foreign 
nationals.  The Akmal case is a vivid legal lesson for Chinese 
people as they will see for themselves that all are equal before the 
law.  After all, foreigners, when breaking the law in China, must be 
treated in strict accordance with China's legal procedures.  Whether 
foreigners who break the law will be treated the same as Chinese 
people is a matter of justice.  Chinese law can only be credible to 
the Chinese people and the world by upholding fairness, equality, 
standards and justice." 
 
¶2. ENVIRONMENT 
 
"Copenhagen's ladder over the wall" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper, 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(12/30)(pg 
3):"Developed countries could refuse to re-confirm emission 
reduction targets with the excuse that the 'Copenhagen Agreement' is 
not a legal binding treaty.  They could also use the four technical 
loopholes in emissions accounting method to avoid responsibility. 
Yang Fuqiang, WWF's Director of Global Climate Solutions, said 
January 31st will be the real litmus test for developed countries 
and we will be able to see whether or not they are actively 
promoting global climate negotiations.  Yang also noted that due to 
all kinds of loopholes in developed countries' emission reduction 
commitments made at the Copenhagen Conference, the agreement which 
will be reached in the future faces the risk of failure."
