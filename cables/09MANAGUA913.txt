¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On September 10, 2009, more than a year after 
Nicaragua was the only country (besides Russia) to recognize 
the "independence" of the breakaway Georgian republic of 
Abkhazia, the two countries have now signed agreements to 
establish formal diplomatic relations.  The agreement also 
came on the same day that news outlets reported that 
Venezuela had officially recognized the "independence" of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  This has been widely seen as 
another step by President Ortega to strengthen Nicaragua,s 
bilateral relationship with Russia. END SUMMARY 
 
----------------------------------------- 
FORMAL DIPLOMATIC AGREEMENT WITH ABKHAZIA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 10, 2009, Nicaragua signed an agreement 
with the breakaway Georgian republic of Abkhazia to establish 
formal diplomatic ties.  The signing ceremony took place 
within days of the first anniversary of Nicaragua,s 
recognition of Abkhazia,s "independence" (see reftel B, C). 
The official Sandinista party news website "El 19" lauded the 
agreement that was signed by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister 
Samuel Santos and Abkhazian "Deputy Foreign Minister" Maxim 
Kvindzhiya.  Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega met 
separately with Kvindzhiya and reiterated his support of the 
"independence" of Abkhazia. Ortega also invited Abkhazian 
"President" Sergei Bagapsh to visit Nicaragua.  Kvindzhiya 
delivered a letter from "President" Bagapsh to Ortega 
expressing gratitude to Nicaragua for its support. It was no 
surprise that Russia,s ambassador to Nicaragua, Igor 
Kondrashov, praised the signing by exclaiming "these 
documents have special significance...and they will help 
flesh out the bilateral relationship with tangible content." 
 
¶3. (SBU) The formal diplomatic agreement signed by Santos and 
Kvindzhiya contained language not only about future 
diplomatic cooperation, but also about development and mutual 
collaboration on political, scientific, ecological, 
humanitarian and cultural issues.  Both countries agreed to 
cooperate in establishing direct diplomatic relations between 
their respective governments, as well as developing ties 
between social organizations at a local level.  (NOTE: The 
full text of the agreement has not yet been made public.  END 
NOTE)

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (C) As we noted in reftels B & C, Nicaragua,s recognition 
of Georgia,s two breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia in September 2008 had everything to do with 
strengthening Ortega,s relationship with Russia.  For more 
than a year, Nicaragua was the only country besides Russia to 
recognize the breakaway republics.  Now, the signing of a 
formal diplomatic agreement with Abkhazia is another "down 
payment" by Ortega to Russia.  We note that Ortega, who 
regularly gives speeches that fondly recall the Cold War Era 
and Moscow,s support of the Nicaraguan Revolution, is again 
actively courting the Kremlin.  Ortega seems to believe that 
this political step - which he can only view as "low-cost" - 
will generate increased Russian military and economic 
assistance that will offset the U.S. and European Union aid 
that was withdrawn after Nicaragua,s fraudulent local 
elections in November 2008.  We believe that Ortega wants to 
recreate the bipolar conflict and clientelism that once 
existed between Russia and the West in Central America. 
 
¶5. (C)  To a small extent Ortega,s hopes for Russian 
reciprocity have materialized. As reported in reftel A, 
Russia "donated" 130 city buses to ease traffic congestion in 
Managua, as well as a military helicopter to transport 
President Ortega. These Russian "donations" were heralded by 
Ortega as "without imposing political or economic 
conditionality" as opposed to "Yankee (aid) interference" in 
Nicaragua,s internal affairs.  However, a closer look shows 
that these Russian gifts "with no strings attached" were not 
donations, but in the case of the buses at least, vehicles to 
enrich Ortega and his party while bypassing any normal 
budgeting process through the National Assembly.
