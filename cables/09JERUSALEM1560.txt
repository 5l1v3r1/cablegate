REF: 8/28 MARCHESE/MORENO EMAIL 
 
¶1.  (U)  This message includes an action request in para 7. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary.  On August 25, the IDF raided the popular 
Palestinian radio station "Bethlehem 2000," confiscating two 
transmitters.  The PA Ministry of Telecommunications 
protested the lack of warning and coordination, and requested 
USG assistance in raising the issue with the GOI. End Summary. 
 
IDF Raid Shuts Down Popular Palestinian Radio Station 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On the night of August 25, the IDF raided the office 
of Palestinian radio station "Bethlehem 2000", located in the 
West Bank town of Beit Jala, and confiscated two 
transmitters, forcing the station to cut its broadcast. 
Bethlehem 2000's broadcast covers Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and 
Ramallah. The station describes itself as "a voice for social 
justice and reconciliation" that broadcasts news, music, 
political, social, and children's programs.  The station is 
also part of the Internews/USAID development program, and was 
recently vetted by USAID. 
 
Interference with Aviation or Israeli Radio Station? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) An IDF spokesman told the press that the station was 
raided because it interfered with transmissions at Ben Gurion 
Airport, a claim echoed by the Israeli Ministry of 
Communication to Embassy Tel Aviv (ref email).  However, 
COGAT informed both the Embassy and the PA Ministry of 
Telecommunications that Bethlehem 2000's transmission was 
interfering with the Israeli radio station Galgalatz's Eilat 
broadcast on the same frequency (106.4 FM). 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to Bethlehem 2000 station manager George 
Canawati, the station has been operating with the same 
frequency type and strength for the past eight years, and has 
the required permit from the PA (a copy dated January 1, 2009 
was passed to the ConGen.)  Canawati explained that, five 
months ago, the GOI confiscated some transmission equipment 
belonging to Bethlehem 2000's Hebron frequency (108 FM), 
claiming that it interfered with Israeli aviation 
communication.  Bethlehem 2000 changed its frequency from 108 
FM to 89.8 FM, and the equipment was returned.  (Note:  GOI 
officials may be confusing the Hebron incident with the 
latest raid, which may explain the two different explanations 
for the August 25 equipment seizure.) 
 
PA: Coordination with GOI on Previous Cases Successful 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Both Galgalaz and Bethlehem 2000 have been 
broadcasting on the same frequency for years, and similar 
cases of transmission interference between the Palestinian 
and Israeli radio stations has occurred due to technical 
reasons, according to PA Deputy Telecom Minister Suleiman 
Zuhairi.  However, he said, previous cases were successfully 
resolved through coordination between the PA and the GOI.  In 
the past, the GOI would inform Zuhairi, and he would instruct 
the radio station to lower its antennae or adjust its filter 
to put a stop to any transmission interference.  Zuhairi said 
that, in this instance, neither the PA nor the radio station 
had been informed of the interference, and the raid had been 
conducted without any warning.  Zuhairi said that the PA 
planned to send a letter to the GOI and the International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU) protesting the raid and 
requesting the return of the transmitters. 
 
¶7. (U) Action Request:  Post recommends that the issue be 
raised with appropriate GOI officials to determine how it can 
be resolved and the transmitters returned, so that Bethlehem 
2000 can return to the air.
