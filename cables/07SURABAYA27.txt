¶1. Despite reports that the Bupati of Sidoarjo planned to evict 
forcibly all residents of the refugee camp at the Porong market 
on August 10, an estimated 2,500 villagers displaced by the 
Lapindo mud flow remained in residence as of August 13. 
According to a volunteer from TAGANA (a humanitarian 
organization which maintains a booth at the market), in 
anticipation of possible violence, many of the women and 
children temporarily evacuated the market before the August 10 
deadline, but returned over the weekend.  Residents armed 
themselves with pointed bamboo spears against the anticipated 
eviction and held a "people's forum" of speakers protesting the 
actions of the government and Lapindo in failing to compensate 
sufficiently the displaced villagers.  The Bupati of Sidoarjo 
had denied the Consulate's request for the Ambassador to visit 
the market during his August 8 visit to the mud flow because of 
the potential for violence. 
 
¶2. Our TAGANA contact told us that in an August 12 meeting at 
the market, the Vice Regent of Sidoarjo urged the refugees to 
accept the compensation package and relocate to another site so 
that the market could open for business.   He insisted that the 
government had no plans to evict the refugees or to cut off 
food, water and electricity, but was still working to identify a 
suitable relocation site for the villagers.  The Vice Regent 
suggested that undefined "parties" were spreading rumors about a 
"deadline" in an attempt to cause unrest. 
 
¶3. The Sidoarjo authorities are trying to convince the remaining 
refugees to accept Lapindo's proffered compensation package, 
which provides for a 20% down payment and rent money, with total 
compensation paid in two years.  The Porong market refugees are 
demanding 50% in up-front compensation, full compensation within 
three months, and relocation as a village.  Contacts in the 
market tell us, however, that there are growing divisions within 
the market residents about accepting Lapindo's offer.   Refugee 
advocate groups are also urging creation of a rehabilitation 
program of skills job training and advice of how to invest bulk 
compensation payments.  An additional 500 refugees in a separate 
location reportedly accepted the Lapindo compensation plan over 
the weekend, but the remaining residents are holding out.   The 
2,500 refugees currently located in the Porong market represent 
an estimated 7% of the total numbers displaced thus far by the 
mud.
