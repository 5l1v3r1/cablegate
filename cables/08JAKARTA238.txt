REF: STATE 6031 
 
(U) Embassy Jakarta welcomes the possibility of OECD enhanced 
engagement with Indonesia and would be pleased to participate in a 
contact group with other OECD members.  The OECD has in the past set 
up useful seminars in Indonesia including on such subjects as 
tracking of donor funds in relation to the 2004 tsunami disaster, 
anti- corruption, transparency and benchmarking in procurement, and 
other subjects.  These outreach efforts, however, have not always 
resulted in high-level participation from the Government of 
Indonesia.  A contact group seek out themes that would assist the 
GOI with its key priorities.  We look forward to the roadmap 
currently being developed and will support the success of these 
efforts.
