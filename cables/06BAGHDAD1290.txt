¶1. (U) This is an action request; please see para 6. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: Post requests the Department to 
demarche the Government of Poland regarding the Poles' 
role in leading a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) 
in Qadisiyah.  The Poles' experience in the region 
makes them the optimal choice to lead the PRT, and 
their established working relationships and expertise 
in the area is crucial to achieving our goal of 
building a durable democracy in Iraq.  Proposed 
talking points appear in para 7.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Building the capacity of the Iraqi provincial 
governments is a critical step in ensuring the 
continued development of a decentralized and 
democratic government that is transparent and 
responsive to the needs of its citizens.  The melding 
of Coalition military and civilian assets is crucial 
to expediting the Iraqi transition to self-reliance 
and is necessary to support robust engagement at the 
provincial level.  It is most effective to have 
established teams in place and ready to engage as soon 
as possible when the new provincial governments are 
seated.  This will enable assistance during the 
critical formative stages and will help ensure long- 
term success. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The PRTs assist Iraqi provincial governments 
to develop a transparent and sustained capability to 
govern; promote increased security and rule of law; 
promote political and economic development; and 
provide the provincial administration necessary to 
meet the basic needs of the population.  The PRT 
initiative is flexible and facilitates integration of 
development and reconstruction activities in a 
province.  Fifteen PRTs and one Regional 
Reconstruction Team (RRT) are planned, led by the 
U.S., Coalition partners, and a few Iraqi-staffed 
offices.  Four PRTs currently are operating, with one 
additional U.S.-led and one Coalition-led PRT 
scheduled to open officially in April. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Polish Coalition Forces operate from Camp 
Echo in Qadisiyah.  They host the regional 
communication servers for the South Central division 
area; maintain a helicopter medevac; and provide quick 
reaction force (QRF) capability at Camp Echo.  In 
several conversations with Emboffs, Polish civilian 
and military leaders have indicated an interest in 
supporting a PRT.  In late February, at a Coalition 
coffee meeting sponsored by Ambassador Khalilzad, 
Polish Ambassador Krystosik announced Poland's intent 
to sponsor a PRT in Qadisiyah.  On April 11, Polish 
Commander MG Gruska was enthusiastic in his 
discussions with the National Coordination Team (NCT) 
Deputy, although Gruska stressed that any final 
decision must be reached between Warsaw and the USG. 
 
¶6. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests that the 
Department demarche the Government of Poland in 
Washington and Warsaw at the earliest possible date. 
Proposed talking points for this demarche are included 
in para 7.  END ACTION REQUEST. 
 
-------------- 
TALKING POINTS 
-------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Proposed talking points: 
 
-- The Government of Poland has a strong relationship 
in Qadisiyah from which to facilitate the rapid 
establishment and integration of a PRT.  Your 
government has performed excellently in the region and 
has achieved commendable progress towards enhancing 
the stability of the province and improving the 
welfare of Qadisiyah's citizens. 
 
-- The USG requests that the GOP consider 
participation in the PRT initiative as a full partner 
by hosting and supporting a PRT for Qadisiyah Province 
at Camp Echo. 
 
-- The USG encourages the GOP to make a decision 
quickly to move ahead with the establishment of a PRT 
 
BAGHDAD 00001290  002 OF 002 
 
 
and provide the necessary work and housing space at 
Camp Echo. 
 
-- The USG invites the GOP to assume the lead for the 
PRT by providing a civilian team leader if it so 
desires, a military co-deputy team leader (the U.S. 
also would provide a co-deputy), a quick reaction 
force, movement security personnel, a civil affairs 
element, and medical support.  If you opt not to 
appoint a civilian team leader, the USG is prepared to 
do so. 
 
-- The U.S. would provide a Department of State/USAID 
officer, Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) 
Provincial Program Manager (PPM), Iraq Provincial 
Action Officer (IPAO), Rule of Law Coordinator, local 
governance contractors, and engineer. 
 
-- A PRT in Qadisiyah is vital to continuing the work 
your government has already begun in the province.  A 
PRT will assist with further developing the capacity 
of the provincial government, and your government is 
in the best position to do this due to your experience 
and established ties. 
 
END TALKING POINTS.
