REF: A. CAIRO 1487 
     ¶B. CAIRO 489 
 
Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (U) On December 29, the Cairo Administrative Judicial 
Court dismissed a lawsuit aimed at shutting down 51 websites 
belonging to Egyptian human rights organizations, opposition 
groups and individual bloggers.  As a legal basis for its 
ruling, the Cairo court cited  Article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, along with Articles 47 and 48 of 
Egypt's Constitution. (Note: Article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights reads as follows: Everyone has 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right 
includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any 
media and regardless of frontiers. End note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) A senior judge in Alexandria, Abdel Fatah Murad, 
filed the lawsuit in May 2007, apparently in a personal 
capacity (ref A).  Murad reportedly was angered by blog 
entries and a subsequent lawsuit accusing him of plagiarizing 
portions of a legal text he wrote. Murad could appeal the 
court's ruling. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bloggers and human rights groups responded quickly 
and positively to the ruling. Well known Egyptian blogger 
"Sandmonkey" called the ruling a "victory for freedom of 
speech." The Hisham Mubarak Law Center, a human rights 
organization whose website was targeted by the lawsuit, 
immediately issued a statement labeling the ruling a "gift" 
from Egypt's judiciary to the "cause of freedom of 
expression."  One of the group's lawyers told us that he was 
especially gratified - and surprised - that the Cairo court 
was willing to rule against a fellow judge.  He also noted 
the court's reliance on the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and said that, as far as he knew, this is the first 
time an Egyptian court has used international human rights 
law to justify a ruling.  A self-described apolitical blogger 
whose site was also a target of the lawsuit told us that 
while the lawsuit had scared her, she now is optimistic about 
the future of Egypt's blogging community. 
 
¶4. (SBU) One blogger from Alexandria reminded us that this 
ruling does nothing to address the conviction and 
imprisonment of fellow blogger Abdel Karim Nabil Soliman, 
currently serving a four-year prison sentence for allegedly 
offensive web postings (ref B). Nonetheless, while Egyptian 
bloggers and journalists face pressures from the government, 
it is difficult to interpret the court's decision in this 
case as anything but a victory for freedom of expression.
