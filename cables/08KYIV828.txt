¶1. Deputy Econ Counselor delivered reftel points on the 
2008 Special 301 report to Valentin Chebotaryov, Deputy 
Chairman of the State Department of Intellectual Property 
(SDIP), on April 24.  Chebotaryov thanked the USG for its 
recognition of progress made in recent years and was 
delighted to learn that Ukraine would be moving from the 
Priority Watch List to the Watch List.  Deputy Econ 
Counselor encouraged the GOU to continue the progress, with 
the goal of removing Ukraine from the Watch List entirely, 
and highlighted the USG desire to develop a joint action 
plan for this purpose.  Chebotaryov expressed SDIP's 
willingness to continue cooperation, and had previously 
mentioned at a meeting of U.S.-Ukraine IPR Enforcement 
Cooperation Group (septel) that the government was 
considering the development of such an IPR action plan. 
 
¶2. Chebotaryov also provided a letter addressed to 
Ambassador Susan Schwab (USTR), with background information 
on recent IPR-related developments in Ukraine.  Post will 
send a copy of the letter to Washington by email and, if 
desired, the original letter through the pouch. 
 
¶3. DCM and Economics Counselor also on April 24 reviewed 
reftel points with Head of the Second Territorial 
Directorate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ihor 
Hrushko.  Hrushko also expressed appreciation for the USTR 
decision and felt it reflected improved IPR protection on 
the ground in Ukraine. 
 
¶4. Post will follow up the verbal demarche with letters 
outlining reftel points to the head of SDIP, to the 
Ministry of Economy, and to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.
