¶1.  (U)   This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)   As reported REFTELS B-E, despite several 
demarches, we have not been successful in obtaining a firm 
commitment from the Government of Iraq (GOI) regarding the 
size of the contribution they will provide to build the 
proposed new UN Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) UN 
integrated compound in Baghdad.  The SYG,s revised proposal 
(in A/62/828 - preliminary cost estimate of $98.6 million) to 
build the compound at a new site, formerly known as the 
Al-Sijud Palace, will be considered by the Fifth Committee of 
the GA during the main part of the 63rd GA in the Fall. 
Mission reiterates its view that there is a high risk that 
both the ACABQ and the Fifth Committee will not approve (or 
will defer action on) the project without a commitment from 
the GOI to fund a significant part of the costs involved - at 
least 50 percent. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  As noted in REF A, the Department has been asked 
by the French whether the USG could support a proposal that 
the GOI should assume full responsibility for constructing 
the new compound and in turn lease the facilities to the UN. 
As anticipated by the Mission, the UN, at the working level, 
has indicated that it does not favor such a proposal because, 
in their view, it would significantly delay the project and 
risk undermining the security aspects of the project.  As we 
understand, part of the concern driving the French proposal 
was its fear that the UN was not capable of delivering on the 
project in a timely manner.  Their concern may be assuaged by 
the recent UN report on the project referred to above. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  If the timely construction of the UNAMI compound 
remains a high priority for the USG, Mission recommends we 
consult further with the French stressing the UN's 
reservations and ask them to work with us and the UK to 
secure GOI agreement to fund a significant part of the 
project.  Mission also recommends we continue to seek a firm 
commitment of the GOI to fund a significant part of the 
project, at least 50 percent, as soon as possible, in order 
to facilitate GA approval of the project in the Fall.
