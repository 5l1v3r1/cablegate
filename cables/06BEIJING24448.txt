THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY MODEL FOR DRUG REHABILITATION 
 
REF: CHENGDU 1083 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Chinese National Narcotics Control 
Commission officials expressed eagerness to proceed 
with expansion of a United States NGO's model for 
therapeutic community-based drug rehabilitation in 
China during a December 4 meeting with visiting INL 
Deputy Director Thomas Browne in Beijing.  They 
requested INL assistance to train qualified personnel, 
including police academy professors and detox center 
and NGO staff and proposed to draft a training work 
plan or MOU for signature in early 2007.  End summary. 
 
Change Ordered From the Top 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a December 4 meeting with visiting INL 
Deputy Director for Anticrime Programs Thomas Browne, 
Deputy Secretary General of China's National Narcotics 
Control Commission (NNCC) Li Yuanzheng said he had 
been charged by Public Security Minister Zhou Yongkang 
to institute therapeutic community model treatment for 
drug rehabilitation patients, based on a model 
established by a United States NGO, in all of China's 
700 drug rehab centers.  (Note: Li said these centers 
can accommodate a total of 300,000 patients.  End 
note.)  The NGO, Daytop International, has been 
working in China's Yunnan Province since 1992 and 
opened a voluntary drug treatment facility in Kunming 
City in 1998, with some INL support (reftel).  China 
has since successfully expanded the model to a few of 
its Ministry of Public Security (MPS)-run mandatory 
detox centers.  In a nationwide meeting in June, 
Minister Zhou told counternarcotics officials that 
they should make the establishment of therapeutic 
rehabilitation centers an important goal of anti-drug 
efforts over the next two years, Li related. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Li told Browne and accompanying delegation 
members from Daytop International, Daytop China and 
the Embassy that he had just returned from Yunnan 
Province where he had met with Public Security chiefs 
from around the country to press the Minister's 
message with local counternarcotics officials.  Li 
complained that, although Public Security officials 
understood that they would have to establish such 
centers, none had the knowledge or tools to do so. 
Li, who has visited Daytop Yunnan and is familiar with 
the program, acknowledged frankly that convincing 
Public Security officials to undertake therapeutic 
rehabilitation work may be difficult.  He noted, 
however, that the order to change comes straight from 
the top, providing considerable motivation. 
 
China Eager to Expand Daytop Model 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Li said he is anxious to begin working on 
the details of an expansion of the Daytop model in 
China and suggested that NNCC would draft a work plan 
that could subsequently be signed by NNCC and INL. 
Browne said the work plan should address the issues of 
who should be trained and how and where the training 
would be conducted.  Consultations with agencies in 
China would be necessary to determine how to adapt the 
model to China's particular conditions, Browne noted. 
Follow-up training and support should be built into 
the program, noted Daytop International's Executive 
Director Aloyisius Joseph. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Li agreed and suggested that the targets for 
training should include professors from police 
academies, detox center staff and staff from NGOs who 
are running voluntary detox centers.  Li further 
advocated more broad-based training and awareness 
raising for local police forces who are on the front 
lines of dealing with drug addicts.  "This kind of 
 
BEIJING 00024448  002 OF 002 
 
 
approach fits with the current emphasis in training 
police forces," Li said, "and we want to educate as 
many officers as possible, at least on the basic 
principles."  MPS Foreign Affairs DDG An Guojun 
suggested distributing a VCD to local police forces to 
introduce broad-based training. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Regarding the location of the training, Li 
and Browne agreed that training should be based in 
centers that are currently using the Daytop model in 
China.  Currently, centers are located in Yunnan, 
Hunan and Hubei Provinces and in Beijing.  Duration of 
training courses could vary, but some "core 
implementers" would need longer and more intensive 
courses, Browne and Li agreed.  In concluding the 
meeting, Li stated that he would work to put together 
a draft training plan to be discussed further and 
possibly signed in the spring on the margins of the 
Joint Liaison Group meeting in Beijing. 
 
Comment: Promoting NGO Collaboration 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Daytop's work in China since 1992 has 
established a firm foundation for cooperation with the 
Chinese Government on therapeutic community 
rehabilitation programs, which the Chinese have found 
to be more effective than their traditional compulsory 
detox programs.  Expanding the therapeutic comunity 
model will not only increase availabilit of more 
effective treatment in China, but wil build on an 
established and successful NGO collaboration and 
promote NGOs as capable ad necessary partners of the 
Government. 
 
¶8.  (U) Deputy Director Browne cleared this message.
