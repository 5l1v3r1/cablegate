SUBJECT:  Major Visa Fraud Arrest in Sao Paulo 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  On Sept. 23, 2008, a joint Fraud Prevention Unit 
(FPU)/Assistant Regional Security Officer Investigator (ARSO-I) 
investigation resulted in the detention of a document producer, a 
document vendor and three non-immigrant visa applicants.  Police 
were filing charges against them for respectively producing, selling 
and submitting packages of fake supporting documents in furtherance 
of fraudulently obtaining Non-Immigrant United States visas.  The 
applicants gave statements, and the vendor and producer were charged 
under Brazilian Law with Article 171, Fraud.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On Friday, September 19, 2008, RSO assets advised FPU that 
five individuals who had purchased document packages from a known 
vendor, Luis Carlos de Aguiar, were applying for visas.  When the 
individuals appeared at pre-screening, their documents were sent to 
the FPU for analysis.  FPU contacted ARSO-I, but local police were 
unavailable, so the documents were retained and the applicants 
refused under 221g with a request to return the following Monday. 
The information from the applications - business names, phone 
numbers, children's schools, and address - were entered as Consular 
Consolidated Database Watchphrase Alerts.  The five individuals did 
not return on Monday. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On Tuesday, the applications of six additional applicants 
(three adults presenting applications for themselves and three minor 
children not present) matched to the Watchphrase Alerts.  Their 
documentation was collected by FPU and the case passed to ARSO-I. 
ARSO-I contacted the Brazilian civil police, who swiftly responded. 
In the meantime, FPU obtained confirmation that the documentation 
for the banks and schools was false. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) After the applicants were denied and left the Consulate 
grounds, police took them into custody.  The applicants led the 
police into the Blue Planet Travel Agency, directly across the 
street from the public consular section entrance.  The "travel 
agency" (the city of Sao Paulo indicated it has no business license) 
was set to open the next day.  The three applicants admitted to 
paying the "travel agency" owner, Luis Carlos de Aguiar, the 
equivalent of USD 24,000, collectively, for the purpose of 
fraudulently obtaining United States tourist visas.  Inside Blue 
Planet Travel, police found Luis Carlos, a small staff, and evidence 
implicating him in this fraudulent activity.  Luis Carlos was 
arrested on charges of Article 171 Fraud, and en route to the police 
station, confessed to purchasing the documents from Estevan Da 
Silva, who was also found and taken into custody. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) A Text Search of telephone numbers associated with Luis 
Carlos de Augiar indicate he had been operating for roughly 12 
months.  Prior to September 23, 31 clients were identified, 17 of 
whom were issued visas and 14 refused. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  The detection and arrest of this document vendor 
resulted from the close collaboration between FPU, ARSO-I, and 
excellent cooperation from the Civil Police in Sao Paulo.  It also 
illustrates the immense value of the CCD Watchphrase Alert feature. 
End Comment.
