DEMOCRATS MAY TRY TO "SABOTAGE" VISIT 
 
 
¶1. Summary:  Sudan welcomes the visit of Special Envoy 
Natsios, but believes "Democrats within the US State 
Department" are trying to sabotage his mission before it 
takes off, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in an October 
5 press release.  Natsios will be granted a visa, provided 
both his mission and its program are "constructive," 
according to the statement.  He should support the Darfur 
Peace Agreement, recognize the basic role of the African 
Union, address development and rehabilitation issues in 
Darfur, correct the negative impact of past UN resolutions, 
and improve bilateral relations by lifting sanctions. 
However, the Ministry also warned that Democrats continue to 
influence US policy towards Sudan, and were already trying to 
pre-empt Natsios's visit with stories that Sudan had denied 
his visa.  The statement cited an October 2 Washington Post 
editorial by Susan Rice, Anthony Lake, and Donald Payne, and 
accused the Democrats of trying to continue the "failed 
hostile policy" against Sudan they launched during the 
Clinton Administration.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The full text of the release reads as follows: 
 
With reference to the statement made by the spokesperson of 
the U.S. State Department on 29 September 2006 that the 
Sudanese Authorities did not grant a visa to the US Envoy to 
Darfur Mr. Andrew Natsios, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
the Republic of the Sudan wishes to clarify the following: 
 
-- At the time the above captioned statement was made no 
request for a visa to enter the Sudan had ever been submitted 
by the said U.S. Envoy, who according to one of his 
assistants, was not yet issued a passport as an Envoy. 
Accordingly, no visa was denied.  The Ministry views such a 
statement as an attempt from within the U.S. State Department 
to pre-empt and sabotage the mission of the U.S. Envoy to the 
Sudan before taking off.  The article published by the 
Washington Post on Monday, October 2, 2006, by Susan Rice, 
Anthony Lake, and Donald M. Payne is a very clear 
manifestation of the influence of the Democrats over the U.S. 
State Department policy under Condoleezza Rice towards the 
Sudan and the situation in Darfur in particular. 
 
-- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the 
Sudan reminds all that the failed U.S. hostile policy against 
the Sudan was not started by the current U.S. Republican 
Administration, but by those very Democrats who were the 
architects of this hostile policy against the Sudan when they 
were in office a few years ago.  The Ministry regrets that 
such a statement would only complicate the issue and can only 
contribute to more suffering of our citizens in Darfur.  It 
also reflects the influential interference of the Democrats 
as well as the disharmony within the U.S. State Department in 
handling the situation in Darfur.  The Ministry calls for 
rectification of this situation. 
 
-- The Ministry welcomes the mission of the U.S. Envoy 
provided it is a constructive mission based on a constructive 
program.  The mission should aim at supporting the Darfur 
Peace Agreement, recognize the basic role of the African 
Union, address the urgent issues of development and 
rehabilitation in Darfur, revise and correct the negative 
impact of past UN resolutions, and remedy the situation of 
bilateral relations between the United States of American and 
the Republic of the Sudan through the lifting of U.S. 
sanctions.  The Ministry looks forward to a constructive 
dialogue that would yield positive results that would foster 
the peace process in Darfur.  The U.S. Envoy would be granted 
a visa to the Sudan, and his mission would be facilitated in 
accordance with the recognized diplomatic customs and 
practices. 
 
-- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the 
Sudan also welcomes the recent support package made by the 
United Nations to the African Union Mission in Sudan, and 
calls upon the United Nations and the International Community 
to continue extending their support to AMIS in full 
recognition of the Darfur Peace Agreement and until all the 
tasks, duties, and obligations therein are fulfilled. 
 
-- Issued in Khartoum, the Sudan, on 5 October 2006.
