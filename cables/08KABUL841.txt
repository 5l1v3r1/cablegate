SUBJECT: NEW GERMAN REINFORCEMENTS HELP PRT KUNDUZ REGAIN THE 
INITIATIVE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The arrival of both a German airborne infantry 
company and additional reconnaissance assets has increased PRT 
Kunduz's ability to provide security and conduct reconstruction 
activities in Kunduz province.  The new company has disrupted 
insurgent attacks and discovered weapons caches.  As a result, the 
PRT is now in a better position to counter the insurgency's spring 
activities.  The German PRT's military leadership understands that 
this pro-active posture requires a greater willingness to accept 
casualties in pursuit of success.  No decision has yet been reached 
on whether the airborne company will be replaced when they depart at 
the end of June 2008. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In 2007 there was a significant increase in insurgent 
activity in Kunduz province, both in quantity and quality of 
attacks.  A May 19 suicide attack that killed three German soldiers 
prompted the PRT to cease foot patrols in Kunduz city and tighten 
vehicle movement restrictions.  The October 5 suicide attack in 
Chahar Dara that wounded two German soldiers demonstrated that not 
only Kunduz city was dangerous.  Nine rocket attacks in the fourth 
quarter resulted in "hardening" of temporary housing facilities. 
The German force protection elements were occupied responding to 
threats, rather than escorting civil-military affairs teams, human 
intelligence and information operations elements into the field. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In response, Berlin dispatched a 200-strong airborne 
infantry company to neutralize the threats and regain the 
initiative.  The paratroopers are responsible for the PRT's 
near-perimeter security, freeing up existing force protection units 
to accompany patrols into the districts.  Additional mixed 
reconnaissance assets arrived to improve overall situational 
awareness. 
 
¶4. (SBU) With the Kunduz reinforcements and the summer arrival of 
the Quick Reaction Force in Mazar-e Sharif, Germany will brush up 
against its maximum authorized contingent size of 3,500 in 
Afghanistan.  The PRT has already been asked to eliminate 25 
positions of the authorized 650. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Since its arrival at the end of February, the airborne 
company has disrupted several insurgent attacks and discovered 
weapons caches.  Intelligence has highlighted the insurgents' 
frustration as to their restricted ability to operate effectively 
(the most recent rocket launches have landed several kilometers from 
the PRT).  Current threat warnings and attacks, including the March 
27 improvised explosive device (IED) attack that wounded three 
German soldiers, indicate a possible shift in insurgent tactics from 
rockets to IEDs. 
 
¶6. (SBU) While PRT Kunduz spent most of 2007 reacting to insurgents' 
efforts to disrupt the security in the province, in 2008 it has 
begun to regain the initiative.  The new personnel have contributed 
to PRT security; however, a new forward-leaning military PRT 
commander is also to thank.  He has been careful, however, not to 
lose sight of the goal of enabling the civilian elements to better 
complete their reconstruction and governance tasks.
