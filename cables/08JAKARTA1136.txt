SUBJECT: ARREST OF INDONESIAN TIGER TRAFFICKERS HIGHLIGHTS 
CONSERVATION CHALLENGE 
 
REF: JAKARTA 328 
 
¶1.  Summary.  The recent arrest of four members of a tiger trading 
ring in North Sumatra underscores the threat facing the endangered 
Sumatran tiger.  Although it was an example of successful 
cooperation between the police, forestry officials, and a locally 
active NGO, the arrests highlighted the wider, continuing, problem 
of illegal trade in wildlife throughout Sumatra.  It might also 
reflect a shift in tiger poaching activity from southern to northern 
Sumatra.  Other recent wildlife seizures by government officials 
underscore the problem.  End Summary. 
 
Tiger Trafficking Ring Busted 
----------------------------- 
¶2.  On May 23, the police in Tina Binanga, North Sumatra, in 
cooperation with forestry officials from the Natural Resources 
Conservation Center (BKSDA), arrested four suspected members of a 
wildlife trafficking ring.  The four, one of whom is a member of the 
military, had a complete tiger pelt and one handgun in their 
possession. The officials made the arrests and seizure with 
information provided by an ongoing undercover Wildlife Conservation 
Society (WCS) investigation into the illegal tiger trade. An NGO 
spokesman claimed that the skin -- probably poached from Gunung 
Leuser National Park in Aceh -- was being shipped to Medan, North 
Sumatra, for sale for approximately $1400.  WCS is following the 
case closely to try and secure prosecutions, working with local NGOs 
and journalists to keep the case in the media -- and public -- 
spotlight. 
 
Tiger Poachers Shifting to Northern Sumatra? 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶3.  According to a member of WCS' Wildlife Conservation Unit in 
Lampung Province, southern Sumatra, the May 23 arrests indicates a 
trend: a movement of illegal tiger traffickers from southern to 
northern Sumatra.  Other NGOs contest this claim.  However, in a 
recent report, TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, found 
no trade in tiger parts in Lampung Province, although it found tiger 
parts that probably totaled 23 tigers (in 2006) in other Sumatran 
provinces (reftel).  The apparent shift in poaching activity is 
supported by the fact that tiger poaching cases in Bukit Barisan 
Selatan National Park (BBSNP) in Lampung declined from 13 in 2003 to 
only 1 in 2007.  However, the illegal trade in wildlife continues to 
be widespread throughout Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia. 
 
The Threat 
---------- 
¶4.  Still, the threat is clear.  One conservation NGO worker 
estimates that 66 Sumatran tigers have been killed in the last two 
years.  WCS says it has unpublished information on the apparent 
deaths from poaching in Aceh of 47 tigers in the period 2006-2007. 
 According to raw survey data that WCS is currently analyzing, there 
may actually have been an increase in BBSNP's tiger population. 
However, in Way Kambas National Park, also in Lampung Province, WCS 
project staff fear there has been a decline in the tiger population, 
probably due to poaching (reftel). 
 
More Wildlife Seizures 
---------------------- 
¶5.  On June 2, officials from the Forest Protection and Nature 
Conservation (PHKA) office in Medan arrested two more suspected 
traffickers and seized two dead tiger cubs.  Separately, in Kota 
Singkawang, Kalimantan Barat, BKSDA officials seized a mixture of 
6,334 green turtle and hawksbill turtle eggs (both endangered 
species, and protected under Indonesian law) and arrested their 
owner.  The owner admitted he had been engaged in the egg trade for 
the past year, obtaining eggs from hunters on various islands in 
Riau Province.
