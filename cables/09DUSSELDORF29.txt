REF: 07 DUESSELDORF 32 
 
¶1.       (U) Continuing their series of comic books designed to 
combat extremism  amongst German youth in North Rhine-Westphalia 
(NRW), the state's Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
(OPC) is expecting to release a third volume of the Andi series, 
Andi 3 (see reftel), by the end of the year.  The series has 
been very successful, a source at the OPC told Poloff, with Andi 
2, the comic book designed to combat Islamic extremism, 
scheduled to become part of the regular curriculum for some 
schools this fall.  The OPC in coordination with the NRW 
Ministry of Education has designed new teacher supplements for 
Andi 2. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (U)  The new volume will follow another of the regular 
cast of characters as he encounters left-wing extremism and 
violence between left-wing and right-wing extremists.  By 
discussing left-wing extremism, the series will now have a 
companion piece for Andi 1, which was about right-wing 
extremism.  According to our source at the OPC, Andi 1 has been 
the most popular edition so far with 380,000 copies printed. 
The OPC has printed 200,000 copies of Andi 2. 
 
 
 
¶3.       (U)  The comic series has also been adopted outside of 
NRW in Hamburg and Lower Saxony.  Hamburg schools currently use 
both volumes now in print, while Lower Saxony is expected to 
start distributing the books to students in this coming school 
year.  Our source at the OPC expressed appreciation that other 
states were starting to use the comics to combat extremism and 
noted that the production of the books was relatively 
inexpensive.  Each comic cost 20,000 Euros to make initially and 
then 20,000 Euros per 100,000 copies printed. 
 
 
 
¶4.       (U)  This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
