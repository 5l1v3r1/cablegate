SUBJECT: GERMANY H1N1 UPDATE: 5,324 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 906, B) Berlin 903 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 infections in Germany rose 
by 879 cases to a total of 5,324 on July 30. The majority of 
new infections occurred abroad, mainly during travel to 
Spain.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  At its July 30 press briefing, the National Reference 
Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
announced 879 new (laboratory and non-laboratory) confirmed 
cases of H1N1.  This increases the total number of H1N1 cases 
to 5,324.  New cases were distributed among all federal 
states: North Rhine-Westphalia (486), Baden-Wuerttemberg (72), 
Lower-Saxony (69), Hesse (49), Bavaria (34), Rhineland- 
Palatinate (33), Saxony-Anhalt (26), Saarland (26), Thuringia 
(25), Saxony (17), Bremen (14), Berlin (11), Brandenburg (9), 
Hamburg (6), Schleswig-Holstein (1) and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 
(1). 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, the increase in the number of 
infections is mainly due to people returning from travel 
abroad (710 new cases), with most of the reported infections 
occurring while in Spain.  Newly confirmed cases include 
laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 as well as non-laboratory- 
confirmed cases, mainly from people who have showed symptoms 
after being in contact with a patient who has been tested 
positive at a labor for the new virus.  So far, all cases are 
reportedly mild. 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) remains the German state 
with the highest number of virus cases among all German states 
with a total of 2,184, followed by Lower-Saxony (971) and 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (511 cases).  Less than 22 percent (1151) 
of all confirmed infections in Germany have resulted from 
domestic transmission.
