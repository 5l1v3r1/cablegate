SUBJECT: CANADA SEEKS CLOSE COORDINATION IN RUN UP TO 
SINGAPORE ARF MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 08005 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Policy Advisor for the Asia Pacific 
region Philip Cordier, Canada is generally in agreement with 
our concept paper on the ASEAN Regional Forum Workplan for 
Counterterrorism and Transnational Crime (reftel).  The 
Division of International Crime and Terrorism will have 
primary responsibility.  The Canadian Embassy in Jakarta will 
represent Canada at the February Inter-Sessional Meeting. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cordier noted that Canada had made similar, albeit 
less comprehensive, comments on its own and that Canada is 
broadly in favor of anything that would make the ARF more 
effective and capable.  At the April 3-4 Inter-Sessional 
Meeting in Ottawa, Canada will focus on these papers in an 
effort to spark discussion on how to strengthen the ARF as a 
mechanism for concrete action, but Cordier predicted that it 
will be an "uphill battle," given the resistance of Laos and 
Vietnam, as well as older ASEAN members.  Canada hopes that 
like-minded members - especially the U.S. -- will be 
available for discussions in the lead-up to the meeting in 
order to strengthen the process.
