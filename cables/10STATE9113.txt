¶1.  Please deliver the following message from Secretary 
Clinton to President Gul.  There will be no signed 
original. 
 
¶2.  Begin Text: 
 
Dear Mr. President: 
 
Thank you for your recent letter regarding the interest 
of the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish Air Force in 
human spaceflight.  I congratulate Turkey on the 
upcoming 100th anniversary of the Turkish Air Force. 
The United States greatly values the strong cooperation 
between our countries' air forces, as well as the work 
we have done together in the areas of science and 
technology.  We look forward to continuing our strong 
partnership. 
 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
is retiring the Space Shuttle in 2010 or shortly 
thereafter.  All of the crew assignments for the five 
remaining flights have been filled for some time given 
the advance planning and training required for each 
flight.  As a result, it will not be possible to 
schedule a Turkish pilot to fly on the Space Shuttle to 
the Space Station in 2011. 
 
Nonetheless, the United States is continuing plans for 
future human space flight missions on vehicles being 
developed to replace the Space Shuttle.  We anticipate 
significant international participation in that effort. 
In the interim, there are also opportunities for 
cooperation on research on the Space Station on a 
bilateral basis.  NASA will engage the appropriate 
authorities in Turkey to explore possibilities for 
future cooperation. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton
