NONCOMPLIANCE FOLLOWING IAEA TECHNICAL BRIEFING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 19694 
 
(SBU) PolOff delivered non paper, per reftel, to Svetlana 
Geleva, MFA Director for Multilateral Affairs on February 28. 
Geleva had been briefed by the Macedonian delegation in 
Vienna on the February 25 technical briefing of the IAEA 
Deputy Director General for Safeguards.  She stated that 
Macedonia shares the USG's concerns regarding Iran's rhetoric 
related to the February 22 report on its nuclear program. 
Macedonia, Geleva noted, firmly supports the USG position 
related to Iran's nuclear program, respects the authority and 
competence of the IAEA, and would turn a deaf ear to any 
Iranian propaganda related to the report and technical 
briefing.
