SUBJECT: May Day- An Urgent Call for Help 
 
 
  ¶1.   (SBU) Summary: The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade 
Unions (ZCTU) and government-backed Zimbabwe Federation 
of Trade Unions (ZFTU) held rival May Day celebrations. 
While ZCTU focused on tax policy and wages, ZFTU focused 
on health and safety in the workplace. ZCTU attracted 
crowds throughout Zimbabwe despite government 
intimidation. End summary. 
 
ZCTU TURNOUT DESPITE INTIMIDATION 
------------------------------------ 
¶2. (SBU) ZCTU leaders declared May Day events a success 
despite government attempts to scare people from 
attending. ZCTU estimates 10-15,000 in attendance while 
government and other sources estimate 5-7,000. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to ZCTU General Secretary Wellington 
Chibebe, The city councils of Norton and Chiredzi refused 
to allow ZCTU-sponsored May Day celebrations. Zanu-PF 
youth warned Mbare residents to stay away from ZCTU 
celebrations or risk eviction from their homes.  A hotel 
owner in Kwekwe, (who also represents Zanu-PF on a local 
level) called the police and ordered all ZCTU personnel 
out of his hotel. The owner dismissed the manager who had 
accepted the ZCTU deposit. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ZCTU President Lovemore Matombo exhorted the 
crowd to join new demonstrations in the coming weeks. 
ZCTU also emphasized tax reform, quarterly wage reviews, 
and a Z$1 Million minimum monthly wage (US$188). ZCTU 
argued that government should not tax people earning 
under the Z$861,000 poverty line (US$161). 
 
¶5. (SBU) Other ZCTU leaders blamed low turnout on fears 
of government reprisals. Deputy General Secretary Collen 
Gwiyo also suggested poor advertising contributed to the 
low turnout. In Mutare, he estimated a crowd of 3-5000. 
Information Officer Mlamileli Sibanda noted several 
companies set up booths at the rally. 
 
PRO ZANU-PF ZFTU DRAWS LARGE CROWD 
------------------------------------ 
¶6. (SBU) ZFTU focused on health and safety in the 
workplace in rival May Day celebrations that drew 15000. 
They also touted success in reinstating or securing 
restitution for wrongfully or unfairly dismissed 
employees.  Some in attendance advocated engagement 
amongst trade unions, government, and employers in a 
social contract dialog- a clear reference to the 
suspended Tripartite negotiations. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Minister of Public Service, Labour, and Social 
Welfare Paul Mangwana failed to attend either the ZCTU or 
ZFTU events despite committing to speak at both events. 
 
COMMENT 
--------- 
¶8. (SBU) Reports of ZCTU's demise are premature. The 
larger ZFTU rally included a soccer match between two 
popular teams and famous singer Simon Chimbetu. ZCTU's 
ability to attract thousands without big name 
entertainment demonstrates its strong membership base. 
However, the continuing emphasis on demonstrations as a 
change mechanism once again suggests a lack of new ideas.
