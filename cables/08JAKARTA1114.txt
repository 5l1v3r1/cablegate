SUBJECT: UPDATE ON SATELINDO BROADCASTING OF AL-MANAR TV
REF: (A) STATE 44312 (B) 00922

Classified By: Economic Officer Yvonne Gonzales for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Based on meetings with Indosat and
Government of Indonesia (GOI) officials, they are not
inclined to stop broadcasting Al-Manar in Indonesia without a
legal basis. While Indosat responded positively towards our
arguments, they said they would not cancel their contract
with Al-Manar until the GOI determined that Al-Manar violated
broadcasting regulation. However, the GOI says Al-Manar has
not violated broadcasting regulation. The Embassy met with
Indosat Deputy President Director Dr. Kaizad B. Heerjee and
his staff, Ministry of Communication and Information
Technology Director General of Posts and Telecommunications
Basuki Yusuf Iskandar and his colleague at the Ministry
Deputy Director General for International Affairs Ikhsan
Baidirus and PT Asia Global Media Head of Programming Brad
Cox. PDAS Gerald Feierstein S/CT also raised the issue with
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Director of International
Security and Disarmament Desra Percaya. We did not get a
requested meeting with Chairman of the Indonesian
Broadcasting Commission (IBC) Sasa Djuarsa Sendjaja, but we
did receive a letter from him. END SUMMARY.

 ¶2. (C) INDOSAT WANTS LEGAL COVER: Heerjee said Indosat did
not want to be involved with a terrorist organization.
However, he said Indosat faced financial penalty or a
possible lawsuit if the company breaks its contract with
Al-Manar without a GOI determination that Al-Manar is in
violation of Indonesian law. Heerjee said, &I have to be
fair commercially.8 He recommended formal communication
from the USG stating the request to end broadcasting of
Al-Manar as well as consequences that could be applied to
Indosat as a New York Stock Exchange listed company. He said
the communication could be addressed to Indosat, the Ministry
of Communication and Information Technology or the MFA.
Heerjee said Indosat shared our concerns about keeping this
issue out of the media.

¶3. (C) GOI FINDS NO FAULT WITH AL-MANAR: After repeated
requests for a meeting, Sendjaja replied by letter. The text
of the letter reads as follows:
&I have received your facsimile message dated May 7th 2008
regarding Request for Appointment,. We deeply regret that
due to the very tight schedule and many activities to run, we
have not had any good opportunity to arrange any meeting or
appointment on the day that you proposed.
However, concerning the broadcasting of Al-Manar satellite
television, I would like to give a brief explanation of how I
view the broadcasting:

¶1. Based on the democratic spirit that inspires the realm of
broadcasting, our country gives the rights to the people to
access any information as well as to express ideas through
satellites to and from around the world. Also, due to the
Open Sky Policy that will enable greater choice for
consumers, I find that Al-Manar television is one of the many
other cable television stations to augment the choices for
the audience throughout the world.

¶2. In the perspective of the content, I have observed and
made an analysis and have come to the conclusion that we have
no problem with what Al-Manar has broadcasted.

¶3. I have also consulted with the Directorate General of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and he states that with regard to
the rules and regulations, the Government of Indonesia cannot
ban the access of any satellite television to the people.
Besides, he also asserts that thus far he finds no problem
with the television st
