  ¶1. SUMMARY: DONOR COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION IN 
  ZIMBABWE IS A CORE COMPONENT OF THE U.S. MISSION'S 
  RESPONSE TO THE HIV/AIDS CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE.  THE 
  U.S. MISSION, AND ITS E.U. PARTNERS, ARE TAKING THE 
  LEAD IN THE DONOR COMMUNITY IN MITIGATING THE 
  HIV/AIDS CRISIS.  THE U.S. MISSION PLAYED AN 
  IMPORTANT ROLE IN MOBILIZING THE DONOR COMMUNITY TO 
  COORDINATE AND COLLABORATE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE 
  IMPACT OF WHAT REMAIN LIMITED DONOR RESOURCES.  THE 
  U.S. MISSION SUPPORTS THE INTENSIFIED COMMITMENT 
  FOSTERED AT THE QUELUZ SUMMIT TO ADVANCE U.S. - E.U. 
  COOPERATION ON HIV/AIDS. END SUMMARY 
 
  ¶2. BACKGROUND: THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC HAS PROPELLED 
  ZIMBABWE RAPIDLY TOWARDS A CRISIS AT BOTH THE 
  HOUSEHOLD AND NATIONAL LEVELS.  THE STATISTICS 
  PORTRAY AN ALARMING SITUATION: UNAIDS ESTIMATES 25% 
  OF THE SEXUALLY ACTIVE ADULT POPULATION TO BE HIV- 
  INFECTED AND THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 500,000 ORPHANS 
  IN ZIMBABWE. SHOCKING AS THE CURRENT SITUATION IS, 
  THE FULL IMPACT OF THE DISEASE HAS YET TO BE FELT. 
  GIVEN THE HIGH PREVALENCE, MORTALITY RATES WILL 
  CONTINUE TO ESCALATE IN COMING YEARS.  THE HIGH 
  DEATH RATE WILL RESULT IN EVEN MORE ORPHANS -- AN 
  ESTIMATED 910,000 BY THE YEAR 2005. 
 
  ¶3. U.S. EMBASSY RESPONSE: GIVEN THE GRAVITY OF THE 
  CRISIS, U.S. AMBASSADOR MCDONALD HAS MADE HIV 
  PREVENTION A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE PROGRAMS SPONSORED 
  BY THE MISSION. THE AMBASSADOR MOBILIZES OTHER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  05624  01 OF 02  041356Z 
  MEMBERS OF THE DONOR COMMUNITY, INCLUDING 
  REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE EU DELEGATION, FREQUENTLY 
  HOLDING INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH FELLOW AMBASSADORS 
  ABOUT PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO COMBAT THE 
  EPIDEMIC.  THESE TALKS SET THE TONE AND TENOR FOR 
  THE REST OF THE MISSION AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE 
  GOZ,OUR MULTIPLE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS AND THE 
  DONOR COMMUNITY. 
 
  ¶4. USAID PROGRAMMING: USAID PROGRAMMING CONTINUES TO 
  PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN THE U.S. MISSION'S HIV/AIDS 
  ACTIVITIES.  USAID'S BUDGET FOR HIV/AIDS HAS MORE 
  THAN DOUBLED TO USD $7.2 MILLION THIS YEAR AND 
  REPRESENTS OVER 50 PERCENT OF USAID/ZIMBABWE'S 
  ANNUAL BUDGET. HIV/AIDS CRISIS MITIGATION IS ONE OF 
  THE USAID MISSION'S CORE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  THIS 
  PROGRAM IS A DYNAMIC AND INNOVATIVE, FIVE-YEAR, $35 
  MILLION EFFORT FOCUSED ON BEHAVIOR CHANGE, POLICY 
  AND ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES FOR CHILDREN 
  ORPHANED BY AIDS. FOR SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THE U.S. 
  MISSION RESPONSE, STRATEGY AND ACTIVITIES SEE REF A. 
 
  ¶5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION: AN OVERARCHING 
  COMPONENT TO USAID'S HIV/AIDS STRATEGIC PLAN IS 
  COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION WITH DONORS WHOM THE 
  U.S. MISSION CONSIDERS AS PARTNERS.  THE USAID 
  MISSION HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN HIV/AIDS 
  DONOR COLLABORATION, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING AN 
  HIV/AIDS TECHNICAL GROUP, WHICH MEETS BI-MONTHLY TO 
  SHARE TECHNICAL INFORMATION, COORDINATE STRATEGIES 
  AND DISSEMINATE RESULTS OF PROGRAM ACHIEVEMENTS.

  ¶7. EU SUPPORT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST AIDS IN ZIMBABWE: 
  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IS A RELATIVELY NEW 
  COOPERATING PARTNER IN THE HEALTH SECTOR IN 
  ZIMBABWE, APART FROM EXTENSIVE SUPPORT TO LOCAL 
  FACILITIES THROUGH ITS MICROPROJECTS FUND, SUPPORT 
  FOR THE HEALTH SECTOR UNDER THE SEVENTH AND SIXTH 
  EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND (EDF) WAS MINIMAL.  THERE 
  WAS, HOWEVER SOME SUPPORT FOR AIDS ACTIVITIES UNDER 
  A REGIONAL PROGRAM.  UNDER THE EIGHTH EDF, WHICH 
  RUNS FROM 1996-01, THE SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT. 
  OF THE TOTAL NATIONAL INDICATIVE PROGRAMME (NIP) OF 
  EURO 110 MILLION, EURO 24.5 MILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN 
  COMMITTED FOR THE HEALTH SECTOR SUPPORT PROGRAMME I 
  (HSSP I).  THIS WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO 
  DECENTRALISATION AND THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE 
  COLLABORATIVE FRAMEWORK.  ABOUT 70% OF THE TOTAL 
  FUNDS WILL BE USED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH 
  SERVICES FUND (HSF). 
 
   A FURTHER EURO 30 MILLION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO 
PRESERVE THE HUMAN CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY IN THE 
FACE OF THE SEVERE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC INCLUDING; 
 
     ¶A.   PROVISION OF ESSENTIAL DRUGS AND SUPPLIES FOR 
       TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS, 
       INCLUDING HIV/AIDS AND TB.  (THE WORLD BANK WAS 
       SUPPORTING THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE IN THE PROVISION 
       OF THESE DRUGS UNTIL 1999).  THE EU ALSO PROPOSES TO 
       SUPPORT THE PROPOSED COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE 
       GOVERNMENT MEDICAL STORES.

     ¶B.   REVITALIZATION OF THE NATIONAL BLOOD TRANSFUSION 
       SERVICE (NBTS). 
 
  ¶8. E.U./U.S. QUELUZ SUMMIT: IN RESPONSE TO THE 
  SUBJECT SUMMIT, THE U.S. MISSION HAS MET WITH THE 
  FRENCH EMBASSY AND E.U. WE HAVE ALSO SHARED THIS 
  CABLE WITH THE E.U. IT WAS AGREED THAT THE HIV 
  TECHNICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH GROUPS NOTED ABOVE 
  WERE SOUND AND USEFUL FORA FOR E.U./U.S. HIV/AIDS 
  DONOR COLLABORATION. ADDITIONAL MEETINGS BETWEEN THE 
  E.U. AND PARTNERS WILL BE SCHEDULED TO EXPLORE 
  CREATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR FURTHER COLLABORATION AND 
  IMPLEMENTATION OF HIV/AID'S ACTIVITIES.
