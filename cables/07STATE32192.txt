¶2. (U) The year 2007 marks the 60th anniversary of the 
Marshall Plan, arguably the most significant American

the economies of a continent devastated by two wars in 
thirty years. 
 
¶3. (U) In his famous remarks on June 5, 1947 at Harvard 
University, Secretary of State George C. Marshall offered 
U.S. support if Europe were to launch an initiative for 
its own recovery. On July 12, 1947, representatives of 16 
European nations and the western zones of Germany met in 
Paris to plan a joint response to Marshall,s offer.

are organizing a symposium on June 13th at the George C. 
Marshall Center in the Hotel de Talleyrand, entitled,  The 
Marshall Plan: Lessons Learned for the 21st Century.8 
 
¶5. (U) The symposium will review historic, diplomatic, 
economic, and strategic aspects of the program in an 
effort to address their applicability today. Scholars, 
historians, government officials, students and business

lessons the Marshall Plan holds for today,s challenges,
