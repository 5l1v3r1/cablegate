SUBJECT: NEW CANADIAN PLEDGE TO THE WORLD BANK'S 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION 
 
 
¶1.  ON DECEMBER 14, CANADIAN FINANCE MINISTER FLAHERTY 
ANNOUNCED THAT CANADA WILL CONTRIBUTE CDOLS 1.3 BILLION TO 
THE WORLD BANK'S INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION.  "OUR 
GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING CANADA'S INTERNATIONAL 
ASSISTANCE IS EFFECTIVE AND THAT TAXPAYERS' MONEY IS WELL 
SPENT, THE MINISTER TOLD THE PRESS.  HE ADDED THAT "THE 
CONTRIBUTION, A 25-PERCENT INCREASE, IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF 
THAT COMMITMENT.  IDA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING 
ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES THAT NEED IT MOST, AND HAS 
ESTABLISHED A REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTIONS." 
 
¶2.  THE THREE-YEAR CONTRIBUTION TO THE 15TH REPLENISHMENT OF 
IDA WAS CONFIRMED AT THE BERLIN REPLENISHMENT MEETING ON 
DECEMBER 13-14.  THE MONEY REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF CDOLS 
262 MILLION AND WILL PUSH CANADA'S SHARE OF IDA FUNDING TO 
NEARLY 4 PERCENT, CANADA'S HIGHEST SHARE IN 10 YEARS.  THE 
CONTRIBUTION IS ALSO PART OF THE 2007 CANADIAN FEDERAL BUDGET 
COMMITMENT TO DOUBLE CANADIAN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE BY 
2010-11 FROM 2001-02 LEVELS.  IT IS ALSO PART OF THE HARPER 
GOVERNMENTS INTENTION TO DOUBLE INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO 
AFRICA BY 2008-09 FROM 2003-04 LEVELS, AS 50 PERCENT OF IDA'S 
RESOURCES ARE EXPECTED TO GO TO AFRICA. 
 
¶3.  CANADA BELIEVES THAT THE NEW FINANCING WILL ALLOW IDA TO 
ENHANCE ITS FOCUS ON EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF AID, FINANCING FOR 
LARGE REGIONAL PROJECTS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND SPECIAL 
ASSISTANCE FOR FRAGILE STATES SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN AND HAITI, 
WHILE ENSURING THAT COUNTRIES DO NOT TAKE ON UNSUSTAINABLE 
LEVELS OF DEBT.
