Dear Dr. Fadel: 
 
Thank you for your recent visit to Washington.  I am pleased 
that we had open and fruitful discussions and have laid the 
groundwork for resolving the matter of the claims of U.S. 
victims of the Saddam Hussein regime. 
 
I understand that you have now returned to Baghdad to report 
on our discussions.  I have briefed Secretary Clinton, who 
expressed her support for continuing collaboration between 
our governments to resolve claims against Iraq brought by 
U.S. victims of the Saddam Hussein regime. 
 
You should be aware that there is strong and increasing 
Congressional interest in quickly addressing such claims.  We 
expect that when the Beaty case is argued to the Supreme 
Court on April 20 there will be additional interest from 
Congress and perhaps the media, as well. 
 
We discussed the possibility, if authorized by your 
government, of an Iraqi delegation returning to Washington in 
April to open negotiations.  We would urge you to follow-up 
soon to confirm this approach.  At such a meeting, we would 
be prepared to propose concrete ideas for a 
government-to-government resolution of these claims and to 
incorporate the ideas and concerns of the Iraqi Government so 
that together we can make tangible progress toward reaching a 
mutually acceptable resolution of this problem.  We share 
with Iraq the common goals of securing legal peace with 
respect to U.S. victims' claims and providing suitable 
compensation, in a manner acceptable to both governments. 
 
I appreciate your readiness to work collaboratively to 
achieve these goals and look forward to speaking with you 
again soon in order to confirm the details surrounding your 
return with a delegation to Washington. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Joan Donoghue 
Acting Legal Adviser 
Office of The Legal Adviser
