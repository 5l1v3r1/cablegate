¶1. (SBU) MFA PSI Action Officer Casper Nervil confirmed June 
9 that MFA State Secretary Michael Zilmer-Johns will 
represent Denmark June 23 at the High-Level Political Meeting 
for the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in Warsaw. 
As an Under Secretary-equivalent in the MFA, he currently has 
broad responsibility for international security matters, NATO 
and EU affairs, and bilateral relations with most OECD 
countries.  Zilmer-Johns was the Senior Foreign Policy 
Advisor to Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen (National 
Security Advisor-equivalent). 
 
¶2. (SBU) On the margins of the upcoming PSI High-Level 
Political meeting, Zilmer-Johns intends to firm up planning 
with Poland and Russia for a September PSI exercise in the 
Baltic Sea.  Nervil noted that Denmark has been trying to 
negotiate this exercise with the Russians for approximately 
two years, and is now cautiously optimistic that it will 
finally go forward.  Denmark is also looking forward to 
participating in the panel on PSI industry outreach during 
the upcoming Warsaw meeting.
