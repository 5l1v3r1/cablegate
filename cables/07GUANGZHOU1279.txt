¶1. (U) Summary: Findings from the December 8 Guangdong Department of 
Health conference on infectious disease outbreaks during the winter 
and spring seasons suggest that the risk of SARS is low, but there 
is the possibility for "sporadic" human avian influenza infection 
and/or reemergence of an animal plague epidemic. Conference experts 
promoted a four-fold prevention plan, involving forbidding the 
breeding, sales, and eating of wild animals; strengthening poultry 
vaccination; sharing information sharing and establishing joint 
prevention efforts between Guangdong's Agriculture and Health 
Departments; and increasing supervision of, and training in, area 
hospitals.  End summary.

Guangdong: A Possible Breeding Ground for Disease 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In Guangdong Province, a sub-tropical area along the Pearl 
River Delta, winter and spring represent especially vulnerable 
periods for the spread of respiratory infectious diseases.  As a 
result, the Guangdong Department of Health held a conference to 
address the likelihood of the occurrence of infectious epidemics in 
the province, primarily SARS, human AI, and animal plagues. 
 
¶3. (U) Experts concluded that Guangdong's risk of a SARS outbreak is 
lower than last year. There is the possibility of a reemergence of 
an animal plague epidemic, such as the porcine reproductive and 
respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), or porcine blue ear disease, 
which afflicted Guangdong pig farms earlier this year. Experts also 
confirm "sporadic" human AI infection, such as that witnessed this 
month in Jiangsu province, is possible but suggested that the risk 
of human-to-human transmission is limited. 
 
----------------------------- 
Prevention is the Best Policy 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Conference experts promoted a four-fold prevention plan. The 
first step involves strictly forbidding the breeding, sales, and 
eating of wild animals, including the civet cat, which was 
attributed to the SARS outbreak of 2002. The second step is to 
strengthen poultry vaccination, to which Guangdong's government has 
paid increasing attention in light of September's avian influenza 
outbreak. Third, experts suggested enhancing information sharing and 
joint prevention efforts between Guangdong's Agriculture and Health 
Departments. Lastly, the provincial government was encouraged to 
establish increased supervision of, and training in, area hospitals, 
especially with regard to handling reported pneumonia cases with 
unknown causes, an initial indicator of possible AI infection. 
 
¶5. (U) Guangdong's Health Department currently engages in a number 
of respiratory infectious disease preventative measures. On a 
monthly basis, the Department collects approximately 50 samples from 
1-2 poultry wholesale markets for AI and SARS testing. From January 
to April 2007, 205 samples were collected; all testing was negative 
for SARS. One sample tested positive for H5N1; samples from 10 
nearby stalls were taken and tested negative. No poultry traders 
showed signs of health problems. 
 
¶6. (U) In addition to collecting samples, the Department of Health 
plans to implement many of the preventative measures suggested by 
experts including the adoption of an "early detection, early 
reporting, early isolation and early treatment" policy.  The 
Department also plans to enforce strict inspections of restaurants 
and markets that sell and serve civet cats and other wild animals, 
including Guangzhou's Qing Ping market, a location historically 
infamous for selling these at-risk delicacies. The provincial 
government will also extend information sharing beyond the Health 
 
GUANGZHOU 00001279  002 OF 002 
 
 
and Agriculture Departments to the Forestry and Inspection and 
Quarantine Departments. Increasing public awareness of prevention 
and treatment options, as well as rapid response to outbreaks also 
remain focal points of the provincial government's ongoing strategy.
