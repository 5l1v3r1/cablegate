¶1. SUMMARY: Post delivered the messages indicated in reftels to the 
Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA).  MAPA agrees with many of 
the arguments stated and shares many common positions with the U.S. 
government. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) USDA Under Secretary Mark Keenum and FAS Administrator 
Michael Yost both utilized the Third Meeting of the USA-Brazil 
Consultative Committee on Agriculture (CCA), on May 20, 2008 in 
Brasilia to convey to MAPA the demarche message regarding the 
benefits of biotechnology, as well as the harm caused by food export 
restrictions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Celio Porto, Under Secretary for International Relations, 
both in the CCA and in the joint press conference with Under 
Secretary Keenum, expressed frustration with the export restrictions 
put in place by Argentina.  MAPA also expressed support for the 
position regarding biotechnology, but noted that, although Brazil 
has a modern legal framework in place to regulate biotechnology, the 
GOB still faces opposition from some anti-biotech groups in Brazil. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following the CCA, FAS Brasilia delivered three demarches 
(reftels) to Mr. Celio Porto.  These demarches were "Request to End 
Food Staple Export Restrictions", "The President's Global Food 
Security Initiative and Trade" and "Biotechnology and Food 
Security".  He acknowledged receipt of these messages and commented 
that Brazil and the United States have similar positions in these 
areas and are key players in the world to resolve food shortages. 
Post will follow up as further information becomes available.
