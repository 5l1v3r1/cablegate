REF: STATE 99425 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel, Political/Economic Chief and Defense Attache 
personnel have raised the issue of security arrangements for the 
National Reconciliation Congress (NRC) with Ugandan Peoples' Defense 
Forces Joint Chief of Staff BG Robert Rusoke and UPDF Spokesman 
Major Felix Kulayigye on July 18 and 20.  The talking points and 
Joint Security Mechanism responsibilities also were given to 
Minister of Defense Crispus Kiyonga. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Kulayigye stated that Captain Paddy Ankunda's comments 
were taken out of context.  The UPDF is stretched thin and each of 
the 900 participants in the NRC cannot expect personal security 
guarantees.  Rusoke and Kulayigye both stated that the UPDF 
considers providing security for the NRC as part of its mandate and 
would participate on the Joint Security Mechanism.  Rusoke 
emphasized that the AMISOM's top priority is providing protection to 
the Transitional Federal Government.
