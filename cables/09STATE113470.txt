SUBJECT: SOMALIA: AF A/S CARSON,S MEETING WITH ASHA HAGI 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  AF Assistant Secretary (A/S) Johnnie 
Carson met with the Chairperson of Save Somali Women and 
Children (SSWC) Asha Hagi on Thursday, October 15, to discuss 
Hagi,s peacebuilding and humanitarian efforts in Somalia. 
Hagi voiced her support for countering al-Shabaab,s 
influence, empowering Somalia,s Transitional Federal 
Government (TFG) and developing the economic capacity of the 
Somali people.  A/S Carson largely supported Hagi,s views, 
noting the alignment between her ideas and U.S. Government 
(USG) policy.  The A/S pledged to look more closely at some 
of her suggestions and noted that the Department is exploring 
options to support the TFG,s underfunded and underequipped 
radio station in Mogadishu.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Chairperson of SSWC, Asha Hagi, met with A/S 
Carson on October 15, 2009.  Hagi is the winner of the 2009 
Clinton Global Citizen Award and the 2008 Right Livelihood 
Award for her human rights and peacebuilding work in Somalia. 
 Hagi was a member of the High Level Political Committee 
during the Djibouti Peace and Reconciliation talks in late 
2008 and early 2009 that resulted in the formation of the 
current TFG and helped create &the Sixth Clan8 to insert 
female representation into Somali politics. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Hagi highlighted five points to consider as the 
United States works with the TFG to advance the Djibouti 
Peace Process: reshape strategy against al-Shabaab to focus 
on gaining control in the central regions of Somalia; assist 
the TFG in developing a local security force; support 
economic development for the Somali people that will counter 
terrorism and piracy; utilize the population,s anger against 
al-Shabaab to amass confidence in the transitional 
government; and improve the TFG,s message domestically and 
internationally through public affairs assistance. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A/S Carson agreed with all of Hagi,s suggestions 
and said he would seek a way to address each.  While we do 
not have on-the-ground access in Somalia, he stated, we can 
offer assistance if the TFG can point to opportunities with 
local institutions in the central regions.  However, A/S 
Carson underscored that the United States will not support 
any groups that do not support the TFG, and we will work 
through the TFG in any assistance we provide.  A/S Carson 
acknowledged the need for a Somalia National Security Force 
and noted that while the African Union Mission in Somalia 
(AMISOM) has done good work, it must be supported locally. 
He highlighted the need for economic development and agreed 
to look at a forthcoming economic development proposal 
created by SSWC.  A/S Carson informed Hagi that the USG is 
willing to assist the TFG in delivering critical services in 
areas it controls, such as healthcare and education, if the 
TFG can produce an implementation plan. 
 
¶5. (SBU) At the end of the meeting, A/S Carson expressed 
particular interest in supporting a strong TFG public 
diplomacy and public affairs (PDPA) program.  He requested 
that AF/PDPA work with the Somalia Unit in Embassy Nairobi to 
improve the TFG,s radio broadcasting capabilities in and 
around Mogadishu.
