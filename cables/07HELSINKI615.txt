SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE: DEBRIEF OF JULY 30 U.S.-RUSSIA 
EXPERTS MEETINGS ON MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 107265 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
(C) PolChief delivered subject demarche to A/Director for 
Arms Control and Disarmament Nina Nordstrom August 10. 
Finnish officials fully understand the technical errors and 
intentional misrepresentations inherent in Moscow's public 
arguments against the placing of missile defense assets in 
Poland and the Czech republic.  The GOF has not taken a 
public stance on the missile defense issue, aside from 
welcoming US efforts to dialogue with Moscow.  Nordstrom 
said she did not expect any of this to change, but 
reiterated the GOF's appreciation for our willingness to 
share with partners the substance of our talks with Russia.
