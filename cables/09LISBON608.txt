SUBJECT: IBERO-AMERICAN SUMMIT DOMINATED BY HONDURAS DISPUTE 
 
¶1.  (U) Delegations from twenty-two Iberian and Latin 
American nations attended the nineteenth Ibero-American 
Summit in Estoril, Portugal November 29-December 1.  The 
summit's theme was "Innovation and Knowledge" and featured 
discussions on technology and innovation collaboration, 
social development and regional cooperation.  Delegations 
from Andorra, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Portugal, and 
Spain were led by their heads of state, with the remaining 
nine attending delegations led by lower level officials. 
Leftist Latin American regimes presented lower profiles at 
this year's summit, as Hugo Chavez, Daniel Ortega, RauQ 
Castro, and Evo Morales were all absent. 
 
¶2.  (U) Despite the theme, the summit was dominated by 
efforts to develop a consensus statement about the ongoing 
Honduran leadership crisis and the November 29 elections. 
Strong delegation positions either supporting or condemning 
the elections made for a contentious debate that threatened 
to extend the summit, but attendees ultimately released a 
"special statement" which was mute about the elections but 
condemned the June 28 coup and called for ousted President 
Zelaya's reinstatement. 
 
¶3.  (U) The "Lisbon Declaration" released on December 1 
delineated the results of the summit, including thirty-three 
"agreements" and fourteen "special communications."  The 
agreements touched on numeQs issues, including support for 
technological collaboration, expanded investment in broadband 
and informationQchnology infrastructure, national 
responsibilities to fight global climate change, and active 
involvement in financial reforms to counter harmful effects 
of the global financial crisis.  The "special communications" 
included statements calling for an end to the U.S. embargo of 
Cuba (including the Helms-Burton Act), reiterating support 
for the Alliance of Civilizations (led by former President of 
Portugal Jorge Sampaio), supporting Portugal and other 
Ibero-American nations as members of the UN Security Council, 
continuing the fight against corruption, and condemning 
terrorism. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  Although the Lisbon Declaration lists an 
impressive array of issues, the prolonged debate about 
Honduras was obviously a disappointment to most of the summit 
delegations.  Brazilian President Lula da Silva, for example, 
said publicly that he would not have attended had he known 
Honduras would dominate the program.  The attendance of ten 
Latin American heads of state at the summit, however, can be 
viewed as a modest success for Portugal, more than making up 
for the minimal substantive progress.
