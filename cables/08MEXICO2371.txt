SUBJECT: PGR SHAKE-UP 
 REF: MEXICO 2085 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Leslie A. Bassett, reason: 1.4 ( 
b),(d). 
 
¶1. (C) According to post's law enforcement community (LEC), 
evidence from A U.S. law enforcement source (see reftel) 
uncovered high-level corruption within the Attorney General's 
Office (PGR) -- suggesting several officials had been 
compromised by the Sinaloa cartel.  The evidence, shared with 
Attorney General Medina Mora, led to the requested 
resignation of all five Deputy Attorney Generals and the 
arrest of several SIEDO investigators detailed from the 
military.  PGR's investigation on this matter is ongoing and 
they have requested that information not be disseminated. 
 
¶2.  (C) The only publicly confirmed move is that of Noe 
Ramirez Mandujano who served as the head of PGR's 
anti-organized crime unit, SIEDO.  PGR's official statement 
said the resignation was part of a rejiggering in anti-crime 
efforts requested by President Calderon and "failure to 
perform" on Ramirez's part.  The new, but only temporary, 
head of SIEDO is Marisela Morales Ibanez, who previously 
headed up the agency's people-trafficking unit. 
 
¶3. (C) The other four deputy attorney generals (DAGs) who 
were requested to resign are Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos 
(who is responsible for legal and international affairs); 
Victor Emilio Corzo (regional controls and injunctions); 
Felipe Munoz (federal crimes); and Juan de Dios Castro (human 
rights).  Of these four, Santiago Vasconcelos is the only one 
expected to be removed and may be replaced by one of the 
other DAGs.  A reorganization of PGR is expected to take 
place within the next 15 days.
