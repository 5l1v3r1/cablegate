SUBJECT: NON-PAPER ON U.S. RESPONSE TO LATEST IAEA REPORT 
ON IRAN PASSED TO FRENCH MFA 
 
REF: STATE 57726 
 
(SBU)  We passed the non-paper in reftel to the French MFA's 
offices handling Iran and nuclear nonproliferation on May 30. 
 Due to the short notice, we were unable to arrange meetings 
to discuss France's reactions to the points contained 
therein.  Embassy reporting, however, has regularly 
emphasized the GOF's strong and mostly compatible views on 
Iran's nuclear program and shared concerns over possible 
research into weapons development.
