¶1. (SBU)  Summary:  Continuing to seek permission for Radio 
Sawa to retransmit its signal in Egypt, the Charge sent a 
letter on March 31 to newly appointed Minister of 
Information Anas El Fekki reiterating the U.S. Broadcasting 
Board of Governors's (BBG's) long-standing request for 
facilities to retransmit its signal in Egypt.  The Charge 
repeated post's willingness to meet with the GOE at any 
time to discuss the matter in more detail.  Refs A through 
F describe post's earlier efforts on this subject.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The BBG sent then Minister of Information Safwat 
El Sherif a letter on May 26, 2004, requesting to install 
an FM transmission tower for Radio Sawa in Cairo's Media 
City.  Ambassador Welch presented this letter to the 
Minister in person on June 2, 2004.  Minister Sherif was 
replaced shortly thereafter, and the Charge sent a follow- 
up letter to his replacement, Minister Mamdouh El Baltagui, 
on July 18.  In a courtesy call on September 26, 2004, 
Ambassador Welch also broached the Radio Sawa issue with 
Minister Beltagui (ref B).  During a January 27, 2005, 
luncheon meeting, Ambassador Welch again raised the issue, 
but Minister Beltagui was still non-committal (ref A). 
Minister Beltagui was replaced on February 15, 2005, by 
Anas El Fekki. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Charge Gray sent a follow-up letter to Minister 
El Fekki on March 31, 2005, referencing previous 
correspondence.  To date, post has not received any reply 
to our repeated inquires on the subject from the Ministry 
of Information.  Post will continue to press the GOE and 
work with BBG on next steps on this issue.
