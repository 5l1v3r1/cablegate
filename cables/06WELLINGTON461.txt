SUBJECT: NOMINATING REGIONAL IVP CANDIDATES IN SUPPORT OF 
SHARED OBJECTIVES IN THE PACIFIC 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) A recent sub-PCC in Washington explored ways to 
enhance USG work in the Pacific Islands. U.S. influence in 
the Pacific is greatly constrained by a lack of public 
diplomacy resources, including very limited exchange 
opportunities.  U.S. policies on global terrorism, good 
governance, the development of democratic institutions, 
climate change, and trade and economic development are often 
poorly understood, especially by mid-level officials who have 
had little exposure to the U.S.  Yet the region's nations 
have twelve votes in the UNGA and in other important fora. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassies Wellington, Canberra, Apia, Port Moresby 
and Suva believe that our outreach to the region would be 
greatly enhanced if the Department were to allocate more U.S. 
International Visitor program slots to our posts.  Embassies 
Canberra and Wellington would devote the new slots to 
programs for host government officials, NGOs, and academics 
who work on Pacific Island issues.  This would enhance their 
capabilities as well as increase our partnership with 
Australia and New Zealand in the PICs.  For Suva and Port 
Moresby, which normally receive only 2 IV slots between them, 
the additional candidates would be drawn from future leaders 
and other candidates best able to help foster 
democratization, the rule of law, fiscal responsibility, 
environmental policies and economic development in Fiji, PNG, 
Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and  other PICs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ECA should also consider designing a Regional 
Program (RP) for PIC participants.  While there is certainly 
great diversity among the needs of Pacific Island countries 
(which in turn affects these countries' bilateral 
relationship with the U.S.), they have many issues in common. 
  Examples include capacity problems due to acute population 
pressures, lack of good governance tools and structures, 
disproportionate exposure to natural disasters and disease, 
and fragile economic structures relying on a very limited 
supply and range of endangered natural resources (principally 
fisheries).  Regional Programs could introduce up and coming 
leaders in the PICs to U.S. approaches to these critical 
problems.   Regionally-oriented programs would enhance 
cooperation with the U.S. and Australian and New Zealand 
participants in the program and help focus cooperation among 
the PICs on areas especially important to the United States. 
 
¶4. (U) We see these proposals as a first step to an enhanced, 
cooperative program of "Transformational Diplomacy in the 
Pacific Islands."  Posts will offer further ideas in future 
reporting on how we may better reach this overall goal. 
 
¶5. (U) Embassies Canberra, Port Moresby, and Suva have 
participated in the drafting of this cable.
