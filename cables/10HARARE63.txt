¶1.  Ambassador presented Demarche (Ref) and talking points to 
Zimbabwe Minister of Environment Frances Nhema on January 29. 
 
¶2.  Nhema responded that in his opinion the Copenhagen Accord 
was not a formal agreement to which the Government of 
Zimbabwe could associate; further he did not know what the 
implications of association would be.  He noted that the GOZ 
had ratified the Kyoto Protocol and that the Copenhagen 
Accord appeared to contain provisions of the Protocol. 
 
¶3.  On January 27, polecon chief talked with Godfrey 
Magwenzi, Director of Multilateral Affairs in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Magwenzi said the GOZ believed climate 
change was real and had high hopes that Copenhagen would be a 
continuation of Kyoto with binding commitments by developed 
countries, including the U.S., and funding commitments to 
developing countries to mitigate the effects of climate 
change and to help in adopting new technologies.  Instead, he 
felt the outcome was political and a step back from Kyoto.
