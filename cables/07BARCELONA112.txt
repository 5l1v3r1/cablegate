¶1. (U) The following submission provides Post's contribution to 
the Department's "Country Reports on Terrorism 2007" report. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Andorra continues to be a supportive partner in the 
global war on terrorism.  The government has cooperated to build 
law enforcement capacity, enhance border security, and combat 
money laundering and terrorist financing.  Changes from previous 
year's reports are few as no significant domestic or 
internationally-related terrorism occurred in the country in 
¶2007.  The government of Andorra is neither a sponsor of 
terrorism nor does it provide safe haven to terrorist 
organizations. 
 
--  After September 11, 2001, the government of Andorra signed 
three conventions in the Council of Europe (Convention on the 
Suppression of Terrorism, the Criminal Law Convention on 
Corruption and the Civil Law Convention on Corruption) and two 
conventions in the United Nations (International convention on 
Suppression of the Finance of Terrorism and the Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime), all still pending 
ratification.  The government of Andorra continues to point to 
staff shortages for translations and other necessary paper work 
before they are ready for ratification in Parliament. 
Nonetheless the Andorran government has reiterated as well that 
ratification will take place within the current term of 
Parliament. 
 
--  Andorra joined the GRECO (Group of States Against 
Corruption) on January 26, 2005.  Andorra is also member of 
Moneyval, the Council of Europe's group to fight money 
laundering.  Since March 2003, Andorra is a signatory to the 
Geneva Convention on the prohibition of developing, producing, 
storage, and use of chemical weapons and also on their 
destruction. 
 
--  In September 2006 the Minister's Council approved the 
ratification of the Council of Europe's Convention on Terrorism 
prevention signed by the Andorrans in Warsaw on May 16, 2005. 
The Andorran Parliament ratified it last November. 
 
--  The Money Laundering Prevention Unit, a governmental 
organization aimed at detecting criminal organizations in the 
Principality, works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department's 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) and the Egmont 
Group.  Andorra does not have stock exchange or casinos. 
Securities and real estate are very controlled and all such 
sources of income must be declared. 
 
--  In September 2005 a new Penal Code came into force.  The 
Penal Code's article on terrorism has increased punishment of 
terrorist individuals or groups who can now be sentenced to 
twenty years in prison if found guilty.  Penalties for money 
laundering and organized crime have also been increased. 
 
--  The government of Andorra's cooperation with U.S. 
antiterrorism efforts is marked by efforts to combat terrorist 
financing and through adherence to international antiterrorism 
conventions. 
 
--  The Andorran government sends financial support to the 
Together Foundation aimed at helping children affected by the 
war in the former Yugoslav Republic.  The Andorran government 
makes a yearly voluntary contribution to the United Nations for 
the Peace Maintenance project. 
 
--  No U.S. citizen has suffered kidnapping or death in the 
preceding five years and no case has arisen in Andorra requiring 
government cooperation with the U.S to prevent acts of terrorism 
against U.S. citizens in the country.
