REF: A. 08 STATE 125595 
     ¶B. 07 RABAT 1238 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable responds to Ref A request for information 
on UN efforts to combat trafficking in persons (TIP) and 
sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) involving UN peacekeeping 
mission personnel in the Western Sahara and Moroccan 
peacekeepers in Cote d'Ivoire.  This message was cleared with 
CONGEN Casablanca and represents coordinated Mission views. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to the Government of Morocco (GOM), TIP 
and SEA are not a problem with the United Nations Mission on 
the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).  Azzedine 
Farhane, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) UN Division Head, 
told PolOff on January 12 that MINURSO personnel have 
cooperated fully with the GOM in efforts to deal with illegal 
migrants and trafficked persons in the Western Sahara. 
Furthermore, the GOM is satisfied with MINURSO's efforts to 
control SEA and TIP in the region. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MINURSO Conduct and Discipline Officer Claudio 
Santorum told PolOff on January 13 that there were no cases 
of SEA or TIP misconduct in 2008.  As Conduct and Discipline 
Officer, Santorum briefs and trains all new arrivals on SEA, 
TIP and other comportment issues and conducts regular 
refresher training thoughout the year. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) MINURSO Civil Affairs Officer Claire Bamber 
reported that in 2007 there was one case of misconduct 
involving a Pakistani peacekeeper and a local civilian.  The 
case was disclosed and thoroughly investigated.  MINURSO 
ordered the Pakistani officer be sent home as a result of the 
investigation.  The incident was fully reported to the UN 
Secretariat and the Security Council. 
 
¶5.  (U) In July 2007, Moroccan peacekeepers in Cote d'Ivoire 
were accused of sexual abuse involving underage girls.  The 
GOM fully supported UN efforts to investigate the 
accusations.  An inquiry team, consisting of UN investigators 
and Moroccan army officers, was unable to unearth any 
conclusive evidence of abuse.  No formal charges were filed 
(Ref B). 
 
¶6.  (U) MINURSO Head of Mission and Special Representative of 
the Secretary General for the Western Sahara Julian Harston 
strongly endorses the UN's zero-tolerance policy regarding 
sexual exploitation and abuse. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Mission did not hear of any other official reports 
in 2008 of SEA or TIP incidents involving MINURSO personnel 
or Moroccan peacekeepers in Cote d'Ivoire.  Human rights NGOs 
in Laayoune do not believe there are SEA or TIP problems 
connected to MINURSO.
