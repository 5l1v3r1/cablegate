SUBJECT: MALAYSIA LOSES GAME OF "CHICKEN" WITH SINGAPORE OVER BRIDGE

4 b and d. 
 
¶1. (C) On April 12, the Government of Malaysia announced that 
Malaysia would abandon its plan to build a new bridge across 
the Johor Strait between Malaysia and Singapore.  When 
Singapore's leaders had balked at Malaysian plans to replace 
an existing 82-year old causeway with a new bridge, the 
Malaysian government announced that they would build a 
"scenic" half-bridge to join up with Singapore's side of the 
causeway at the boundary line.  This plan, which local MP Nur 
Jazlan privately described to us as "a game of chicken", had 
some serious flaws -- it did not take into full account the 
need to maintain rail links and a water pipeline that 
supplies the island republic with fresh Malaysian water. 
Demolishing its own side of the causeway could have put 
Malaysia in breach of a longstanding bilateral water sharing 
agreement with Singapore.  Malaysia had wanted to build the 
bridge to improve shipping access to and between the ports of 
Johor Baru and Port Tanjung Pelepas (PTP), as well as to 
enrich contractors linked to Malaysia's ruling political 
coalition.  Press reports indicate that the bridge 
contractors will be paid some 27 million USD in compensation 
on what was to have been a 300 million USD project. 
 
¶2. (C) Malaysia's government-controlled press was filled with 
articles justifying the project's cancellation and blaming 
the move on Singaporean intransigence.  Johor state 
politicians have been vocal in their opposition to supposed 
Singaporean conditions for agreeing to the bridge project -- 
free passage through a small area of Malaysian airspace in 
order to facilitate access to international airspace for 
military training and exercises, and permission to purchase 
Malaysian sand for Singaporean land reclamation projects. 
These influential politicians, including the state's Chief 
Minister Abdul Ghani Othman, outspoken Backbenchers' Club 
President MP Sharir Samad, and MP Nur Jazlan owe their local 
political reputations to standing up to and playing tough 
with Singapore.  While Singaporean tourists in search of 
bargains make an important contribution to the local economy, 
the richer, more successful Singaporeans also generate 
resentment in neighboring Johor.  One discordant voice in the 
chorus of those supporting the decision was Mahathir Mohamad, 
the former PM, who himself originally proposed replacing the 
causeway with a bridge in 1996.
