TOPICS: 
 
 
 
- NSC Head Jalili: We Want Ironclad Guarantees; P5+1 Still 
Dithering (Nov 24) 
 
- MFA Spokesman Rahminparast: The Other Side Should Give [100 
percent] Fuel Guarantee Solution (Nov 24) 
 
 
 
¶1. NSC HEAD JALILI: WE WANT IRONCLAD GUARANTEES; P5+1 STILL 
DITHERING 
 
 
 
National Security Council Secretary Saeed Jalili told press on 
November 24 that: 
 
 
 
- Iran it must have ironclad guarantees for fuel procurement and 
if they aren't provided, it has other options it will put 
forward. 
 
 
 
- [Iran's opinion on P5+1's latest position]: "As we have 
previously announced, Iran is ready have discussions concerning 
its package of proposals and the topics that were put forward in 
that package.  We stated this matter clearly in Geneva and we 
agreed to pursue discussions on Iran's proposed package and its 
topics and now they apparently are busy talking internally and 
they aren't ready.  Whenever they are ready to talk about the 
Iranian package and the joint concerns within it, we will 
welcome it.  We think Iran's proposed package has good topics 
for forming cooperation concerning mutual concerns." 
 
 
 
- [Re TRR]:  "As we've said before, the issue of providing fuel 
for TRR is not political and doesn't have any relation to talks 
with the P5+1. It isn't a talk that has even technical or legal 
aspects: it is simply a commercial issue." 
 
 
 
- "Iran has requests in conjunction with the rights it has, and 
it has asked the IAEA to act according to its supporting and 
facilitating function. Of course we have other options for 
procuring this fuel.  In this regard, if people in this regard 
act according to our requests in a timely manner, this in itself 
adds to our lack of confidence in the behavior of these nations." 
 
 
 
- [On Any Role Turkey Might Have in a TRR Deal]: Iran has asked 
for TRR fuel from the IAEA in the context of the rights it had, 
and the IAEA is obligated to relay Iran's request to those 
countries who can fulfill it.  In this regard, there must be 
discussions which have only a commercial and economic aspect and 
there must be no political considerations.  Iran needs fuel and 
wants to buy it, people can put it at our disposal and other 
countries can make statements in this regard but they have no 
role. 
 
 
 
- "What Iran has said is that we need ironclad guarantees for 
procuring fuel and if we don't have them, we have options that 
we will put forward." 
 
 
 
¶2. MFA SPOKESMAN RAHMINPARAST: THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD GIVE [100 
PERCENT] FUEL GUARANTEE SOLUTION 
 
 
 
In his November 24 weekly press conference, MFA spokesman Ramin 
Mehmanparast said: 
 
 
DUBAI 00000507  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
 
- "We will not present a solution in relation to 100 percent 
guarantee of fuel provision.  The solutions that various 
countries propose must create these guarantees...One of these 
guarantees can be an exchange of fuel inside Iran." 
 
 
 
- [Russia and Bushehr]: The delay in Bushehr has been due to 
technical reasons.  The latest agreements we have with Russia 
calls for them to complete their commitments by the end of the 
Christian year [i.e. 2009]~we hope these commitments are carried 
out in such a timeframe. 
 
 
 
- [Re Turkey's stated willingness to add itself to the P5+1]: 
"In relation to Turkey's efforts to create a role for itself one 
must say that many friendly countries have, with the intention 
of helping on some issues, announced their willingness to help 
us pursue our national interests and gain our basic rights, 
which is important.  We welcome anything that can help us 
achieve our rights.  Iran's nuclear issue must be removed from 
the political sphere.  This issue has been settled.  Iran is an 
NPT member and according to the NPT the fuel we need must be put 
at our disposal~this is purely a commercial matter and must be 
addressed in the language of commerce." 
 
 
 
- "Our young scientists have the ability to enrich uranium to 20 
percent and according to the NPT there is no bar to enriching 
above 5 percent, but in the current conditions one of the 
suggestions of our officials is buying 20 percent fuel for the 
TRR. 
 
 
 
- [Question: If Iran can enrich above 20 percent, has it taken 
any steps to do so?] "If you had studied the statements of 
[Deputy NSC Head] Baqeri, he also emphasized that we have not 
taken steps in this regard; we have the ability to do so, and 
can do so any time we wish." 
 
 
 
- [Question: does Iran agree in principle with sending out its 
uranium?]: Iran has three ways to procure TRR fuel: 1) buying 20 
percent fuel, 2) we ourselves act to produce 10 [sic - typo?] 
percent fuel, 3) we have a type of exchange between our 3.5 
percent fuel and 20 percent fuel.  No one in Iran has ever said 
we oppose sending out 3.5 percent fuel: what we said was the 
manner of sending it out and if it is said we are seeking 100 
percent guarantees it is because this fuel will only be sent out 
when we have 100 percent assurance of receiving 20 percent 
fuel~. 
 
 
 
- We want 100 percent guarantees.  The countries with whom we 
are having discussions haven't left a good impression in 
[Iranian] public opinion.  We have had commitments from France, 
the UK and America which unfortunately~they haven't lived up to, 
which has created a lack of confidence. So as not to repeat 
previous problems we are seeking 100 percent guarantees.
