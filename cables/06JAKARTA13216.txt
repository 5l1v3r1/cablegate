 ¶1. (SBU) The GOI is ready to move forward with negotiations 
on a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S.  On 
November 15, Director of the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU) Directorate for Treaties on Political, Security, and 
Territorial Affairs Arif Havas Oegroseno told Poloff and DOJ 
Resident Legal Advisor Robert Strang that DEPLU would send a 
formal letter to us and to the Department as early as next 
week indicating their willingness to begin negotiations. 
Oegroseno stated that the letter would include a template 
that could be used as a starting point in the negotiations, a 
copy of which was given to us at the meeting. He also 
welcomed the opportunity to see a draft text from the U.S. 
side prior to the first meeting.  We have been promised an 
electronic version of the template and will forward that to 
Washington when received. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Oegroseno stated that he would be the lead 
negotiator on the Indonesian team, which would include 
officials from the Department of Law and Human Rights, the 
Attorney General's Office, Interpol and possibly the 
Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal, and Security 
Affairs.  He expressed his hope that the negotiations could 
be completed after only two formal sessions, one in Indonesia 
and one in the U.S.  He was also receptive to the idea of 
holding the first session in late January, as suggested in 
reftel.  Finally, Oegroseno raised the possibility of holding 
an informal meeting prior to the first formal session in 
order to discuss potential issues identified in the initial 
comparison of the draft texts.  We would welcome input from 
L/LEI and DOJ/OIA on the usefulness of such a meeting.
