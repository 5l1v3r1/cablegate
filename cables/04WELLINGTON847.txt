SUBJECT: TERRORISM FINANCE COORDINATION OFFICER AT EMBASSY 
WELLINGTON 
 
REF: STATE 201391 
 
(SBU) Keyed to request in reftel, Paragraph 5: 
 
a) Embassy Wellington's Terrorism Finance Coordination 
Officer (TFCO) is: 
 
David R. Burnett 
Deputy Chief of Mission 
Tel: 64-4-462-6101 
e-mail: burnettDR@state.gov 
 
Post's deputy TFCO is: 
 
Joy Yamamoto 
Economic Officer 
Tel: 64-4-462-6182 
e-mail: yamamotoJO@state.gov 
 
b) Post's DCM -- as its TFCO -- chairs terrorist finance 
meetings.  As a SEP post, Embassy Wellington has found it 
efficient to include both terrorist finance and law 
enforcement issues in both scheduled and informal meetings, 
as necessary.  We had not formally included terrorist 
finance issues in our Visas Viper Committee meetings, but 
are doing so now. 
 
c) Because the New Zealand government has taken a concerted 
approach to fighting terrorist financing, we have focused on 
ensuring that it has the information and training required 
for its efforts.  While we have achieved a good flow of 
information, we have been less successful in identifying 
appropriate training opportunities. 
 
d) Although post also coordinates with Legatt at Embassy 
Canberra as appropriate, we are not involved in regional 
meetings. 
 
e) Post has engaged in limited public information efforts on 
terrorist financing.  These efforts have included 
distributing the State Department e-journal "The Global War 
on Terrorist Finance" to Embassy contacts.  The distribution 
list included appropriate officials from the Ministries of 
Justice, Police, Defense and Foreign Affairs.  Interested 
media and academics also received copies. Post would welcome 
further suggestions. 
 
f) Both TFCO and deputy have not received FSI or other 
training on combating terrorist financing. 
 
g) Post would welcome information on opportunities for 
training of New Zealand nationals in fighting terrorist 
financing.
