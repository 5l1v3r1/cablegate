¶2. Summary: Turkish businessman Hasan Akincioglu has 
offered 1.2 million bottles of US Army VETCOM approved 
water to the relief efforts.  Akincioglu has worked for 
35 years with the US military stationed at Incirlik Air 
Force Base in Adana.  He requested assistance from the 
USG in transporting the cargo to the US.  If it is 
possible to load this cargo on the empty planes 
returning daily from Incirlik, or if sea transport can 
be arranged, this is a golden opportunity to help those 
in need.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. On September 5, Turkish businessman Hasan Akincioglu 
offered to donate 100,000 cases (1.2 million bottles) of 
US Army VETCOM approved drinking water to relief 
efforts. He has worked for 35 years with the US military 
stationed in Turkey and is experienced in moving large 
amounts of cargo.  The water is located in Adana near 
the Incirlik base. 
 
¶4. Akincioglu requested assistance in transporting the 
cargo from Adana to the US.  He suggested the military 
aircraft that regularly fly in and out of Incirlik. 
 
¶5. Comment:  According to DAO, Akincioglu is a trusted 
and experienced supplier who has worked with the US 
military in Turkey for many years.  If it is possible to 
load this water, which is already located at Incirlik, 
onto the empty planes that return daily from Incirlik to 
the US, or to find a way to transport the cargo by sea, 
this could be a golden opportunity to assist those in 
need.  End comment. 
 
¶6. Action Request: Post requests Department guidance 
regarding this offer.  Point of contact is Disaster 
Management Officer Rebecca Patrick (x.2255).
