REF: STATE 84207 
 
Â¶1. On June 25 we delivered reftel information to Andi 
Rachmianto, Deputy Director for International Security and 
Disarmament at the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs. 
Rachmianto asked how the Annex to UNSCR 1737 differed from 
E.O. 13382.  We explained that E.O. was a unilateral U.S. 
action and applied primarily to U.S. companies and banks 
involved in trade with Iran; it also affected third parties, 
however, who exported U.S. products or used U.S. banks in 
transactions with Iran.  We provided Rachmianto with a copy 
of the executive order.
