Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  Despite the spread of the avian influenza virus to 
some African countries, including neighboring Egypt, no 
cases of avian influenza have been reported in birds or 
humans in Sudan.  The Government of National Unity's 
(GNU) preparations to date have mainly consisted of the 
formation of committees, the development of plans, and 
the discussion of proposed budgets, with little action 
taken to fund plans to raise awareness and detection 
capabilities.  The lack of funds for plan implementation 
has prevented the GNU from carrying out meaningful 
awareness, prevention, and control measures.  End summary 
and comment.

¶2.  As a preventive measure, the GNU has banned the 
importation of birds and poultry products.  In addition, 
the GNU has developed a plan to raise awareness and 
prepare for a possible outbreak; however, it has not 
allocated any funding to support the plan.  In October 
2005, the GNU formed a national committee headed by the 
Under Secretary of the Ministry of Animal Wealth (MOAW), 
with representatives from the Ministry of Health (MOH), 
the private sector, and other institutions participating. 
A task force prepared a national plan with the objectives 
of raising awareness, providing correct information about 
the disease and potential hazards related to it, 
developing a surveillance system to ensure early 
detection of the disease, and building the capacity of 
the local laboratories to be able to diagnose the 
disease. 
 
¶3.  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is 
the lead U.N. agency for the avian influenza control 
efforts in Sudan.  FAO, in collaboration with WHO and the 
concerned ministries, reviewed the MOAW plan, which has 
an estimated budget of USD 10,626,000.  Although the 
Ministry of Finance approved the budget the task force 
submitted, no money was made available for implementation 
of the plan. 
 
¶4.  The MOH has formed a consultative technical committee 
to prepare plans for disease control, coordinate with 
other institutions and organizations, and report on the 
status of the avian flu in the country.  On March 8, the 
committee held the first of its bi-weekly meetings.  A 
draft plan was presented with a budget to address the 
surveillance, case management and laboratory 
requirements.  The Directorate of Preventive Medicine and 
Epidemiology has prepared a booklet that provides basic 
information about the disease and the preventive methods. 
 
¶5.  USAID continues to monitor the situation regularly 
and will provide periodic updates.
