SUBJECT:  Tsvangirai Seeks More Active SADC Involvement in 
Zimbabwean Impasse 
 
REF:  Kinshasa 826 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan's Tsvangirai's 
October 22 meeting with DRC President Joseph Kabila, Seraphin Ngwej, 
Ambassador-at-large in the presidency, said that Tsvangirai had 
briefed the DRC President on the current situation in Zimbabwe, 
including his decision to freeze relations with the Mugabe camp. 
Ngwej added that Tsvangirai pressed SADC (and by extension the SADC 
Chairman) to take a more active involvement in finding a political 
resolution to the internal Zimbabwean crisis.  Kabila, according to 
Ngwej, would travel with Mozambican President Guebuza, who chairs 
SADC's Organ on Politics, Defense, and Security, to Harare in the 
coming days to evaluate the situation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Tsvangirai pointed to the DRC's experience with political 
transition as something from which Zimbabwe could learn.  He added 
that as "guarantors of Zimbabwe's transitional inclusive government, 
SADC must live up to its responsibility by ensuring that all parties 
to the agreement abide by the letter and spirit of that agreement." 
A Tsvangirai aide said that Kabila promised to "actively resolve the 
crisis." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Kinshasa press speculated that Tsvangirai was concerned 
because Kabila, as SADC Chairman, had not taken the initiative to 
engage on the Zimbabwean crisis.  Robert Mugabe, according to one 
press report, had always fashioned himself as Joseph Kabila's 
godfather, pointing to the Zimbabwean president's political and 
military support for Laurent Kabila.  Pro-government press hailed 
Tsvangirai's visit as an indication that the DRC's experience with 
political transition could serve as a model for Zimbabwe. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: It is not clear how active the GDRC will want to 
be on the Zimbabwe issue given contradictory influences playing on 
its Zimbabwean policy (reftel).  There are many who remember the 
support Mugabe gave Laurent Kabila in his time of need and there are 
still commercial contacts stemming from this period.  However, the 
GDRC appears to clearly understand that Mugabe has become an 
embarrassment for SADC.  The GDRC will continue to take its lead 
from the South African Government, which appears to moving towards a 
more noticeable SADC involvement in resolving the crisis.  End 
comment.
