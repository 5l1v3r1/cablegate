SUBJECT: BRAZIL RESPONDS TO NAM MINISTERIAL DEMARCHE NOTING DISTRUST 
OF REFORM INITIATIVE AMONG THE G-77 
 
REF: STATE 83898 
 
¶1. Poloff delivered Reftel's talking points, June 21, to Bruno Brant 
of the MFA's Division for UN Affairs.  In a revealing conversation 
about a prevailing mood of "distrust" within the UN, Brant noted 
that the GoB tends to be one of the moderating influences among the 
G-77, but that hard-line USG and EU positions have made it difficult 
for Brazil to be a tempering influence.  In regard to Resolution 
60/260 Brant averred that Brazil had tried to breach differences and 
had actually been very close to a deal with EU members.  The GoB 
believes that there is very little that separates the developed 
nations from the rest but that a spirit of "political distrust" has 
invaded the UN, and this stems from the spending cap. 
 
¶2. Brant claimed that there is a perception of blackmail among some 
members of the G-77, as reform is being "held hostage" to the budget 
measures.  This impression, he reiterated, makes it difficult to 
moderate radical elements of the developing country block.  In a 
succinct evaluation of the situation Brant noted there are two 
elements vying in the UN, the power of the purse and the power of 
the vote. 
 
¶3. Addressing the reform measures highlighted in the talking points, 
Brant said he believes that there is a general consensus that the 
proposed package is very positive.  The GoB had few if any arguments 
with the purported reforms and believes that consensus would be 
easily achieved; if, of course, the U.S. and EU were willing to 
separate the two issues (Reform and the Budget).  When pressed as to 
whether the GoB would again vote with the G-77 in a deadlock, Brant 
demurred and said that he did not know the answer to that question. 
He believed, however, that the ball is in the U.S. court and that 
confidence building measures would help to avert a crisis.  In 
closing, Brant was upbeat stating that there is a strong desire and 
willingness to discuss reform, and that consensus was imminently 
possible.
