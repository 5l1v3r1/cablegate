SUBJECT: H1N1 IN POLAND: QUIET FOR NOW 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Poland's Chief Sanitary Inspectorate 
reports no deaths related to H1N1 and no major outbreaks. 
While Polish officials are watching the situation closely, 
they do not plan to implement extraordinary measures absent a 
dramatic change in the disease's behavior, despite 
substantial media attention to the situation in Ukraine. 
Health officials plan to purchase 4 million doses of the H1N1 
vaccine, but not until further testing is complete.  For now, 
they are focused on educating the public on preventing the 
spread of all types of influenza.  Poland will continue 
following EU and WHO recommendations while officials maintain 
direct contact with the US Center for Disease Control. 
Confirmed cases are very low (only 190) but that is likely 
the result of limited testing to discern between regular 
seasonal flu and H1N1.  End Summary. 
 
Only 190 Confirmed Cases? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On Thursday, November 05, 2009, EconOff met with 
Chief Sanitary Inspectorate to discuss Poland's current 
preparedness for the H1N1 influenza.  To date, there are only 
190 confirmed cases of H1N1, very low compared to neighboring 
Germany's 30,000 and Ukraine's 250,000.  However, there are 
approximately 10,000 reported cases of influenza-like 
illnesses, which would include unconfirmed cases of the H1N1 
strain.  Furthermore, Poles do not regularly seek medical 
attention for what they consider to be seasonal symptoms.  No 
deaths have resulted from H1N1 and only one critical case 
from last Spring, which involved an AmCit child who had 
traveled from the United States, have been recorded.  Poland 
is following EU and WHO recommendations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Regarding the drastically lower numbers of 
confirmed cases, the Chief Inspectorate reported that not all 
flu-like cases are tested for H1N1, which is why the numbers 
are so much lower than in neighboring countries.  Only 5% of 
General Practitioners are required, under the Sentinel 
System, to test all patients with flu-like systems.  The 
Sentinel System is a select group of doctors in each region 
that participate in reporting on all respiratory illnesses to 
the Ministry of Health.  Some independent reporting of H1N1 
has occurred when patients specifically mentioned travel to 
western Ukraine, but these numbers are minimal. 
 
For Now: Information but no Vaccination 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) There are no plans for closing borders or schools, 
or limiting travel.  Poland has 4 million H1N1 vaccines on 
order for the first priority group, in accordance with WHO 
guidelines, but is awaiting research confirming that the 
vaccine safe before final purchase (NOTE: Officials would not 
specify the research they had in mind).  The Ministry of 
Health is conducting an intense informational campaign, which 
relays information for all types of influenza.  While taking 
the necessary action to inform and treat H1N1 influenza, the 
Chief Inspectorate views seasonal influenza as a much greater 
threat to the Polish community. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Ministry of Health is also standing firm on not 
committing to purchase the H1N1 vaccines until further 
testing shows that it is safe.  The Chief Inspectorate stated 
they were pressured by an unnamed pharmaceutical company to 
purchase the vaccine, but the test results were not 
satisfactory and the contract would have freed the company 
from any liability.  In the meantime, the seasonal influenza 
vaccine is available and being distributed.  However, it is 
estimated that only 5% of the Polish population receives the 
vaccine and only 6% of medical doctors choose to take the 
vaccine themselves or even recommend it for their patients. 
Hence, the Ministry of Health must go against a population's 
superstition against vaccinations and is vigorously 
campaigning to educate about all kinds of influenza and 
encourage healthy living, which, they argue, includes 
vaccination.
