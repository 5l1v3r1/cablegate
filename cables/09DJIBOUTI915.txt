DEVELOPMENTS 
 
1.(SBU)  Summary:  Foreign Minister Mahmoud Youssouf briefed the 
diplomatic corps July 12 on regional diplomatic initiatives and 
military support for Somalia.  He noted agreement within both the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African 
Union (AU) on strengthening the mandate of the African Union 
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), and praised the willingness of the 
troop contributing countries to implement more muscular measures in 
support of Somalia's Transitional Federal Government (TFG).   Once 
the AMISOM mandate is changed to permit bordering countries to send 
troops, GODJ will consider a contribution.  IGAD members plan to 
lobby the UN Security Council in meetings at the end of this month 
to impose targeted sanctions on regional spoilers - notably 
Eritrean leaders and ruling-party-affiliated firms.   Commenting on 
heaving fighting in Mogadishu July 10-11, Youssouf said a number of 
foreign fighters had been captured, including two who committed 
suicide rather than be taken alive.  The TFG plans heavy media 
coverage of the presence of these fighters.  Youssouf reported on 
GODJ training of approximately 460 TFG recruits at Hol Hol, and 
thanked the U.S. and France for their material support to the GODJ. 
He stressed the need for additional training and material support 
to the TFG, adding that the Ethiopians are prepared to train 
"several thousand" if requested.   Youssouf's comments underscore 
continued active GODJ efforts to bolster the TFG.  End summary. 
 
 
 
AU Summit Results 
 
----------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) In substantive remarks during a farewell lunch for the 
departing Saudi Ambassador, Djiboutian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali 
Youssouf briefed the diplomatic corps on the outcome of the African 
Union summit (July 1-3) and the 33rd Extraordinary Session of the 
IGAD Council of Ministers (July 10).  After reviewing general 
points on the AU summit - including creation of the new AU 
"secretaries," efforts to integrate NEPAD, and the decision 
regarding the ICC and Sudanese President Bashir -- Youssouf focused 
on Somalia and Eritrea. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Youssouf said there was agreement at the AU summit to (1) 
revise the AMISOM mandate (authorizing more robust support of TFG 
forces and enabling "front-line states" - i.e., Djibouti, Ethiopia, 
and Kenya - to contribute troops), and (2) sanction individuals and 
states that undermine the peace process.  In response to questions, 
Youssouf said Djibouti was waiting for the formal change in mandate 
(by AU PSC and the UNSC) before determining its contribution to 
AMISOM, which could be either troops or logistical support.  On the 
Djibouti/Eritrea border dispute, the AU summit endorsed earlier 
calls by AU members urging Asmara to withdraw its troops from the 
border area and participate in international mediation.  Asked what 
specific sanctions should be applied to Eritrea, Youssouf specified 
the need for targeted "smart" sanctions to impose travel and 
financial restrictions on senior GSE leaders and 
ruling-party-affiliated companies, such as "Red Sea Trading 
Corporation." 
 
 
 
Next Diplomatic Moves in New York 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Youssouf highlighted a series of upcoming meetings of 
the UN Security Council, at which IGAD would push its agenda.  They 
include:  (1) a July 21 UNSC meeting on the Djibouti/Eritrea border 
dispute; (2) a July 22 meeting on post-conflict peace-building; and 
(3) a July 29 briefing and consultation on Somalia.   (Note:  We 
learned in a later discussion with visiting Somali Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Abdullahi Omar, that he, Youssouf, and Ugandan Foreign 
Minister Sam Kutesa would lead a delegation to New York to press 
for the AMISOM mandate change, further support to the TFG, and 
sanctions against Eritrea.  End note.) 
 
 
 
Fighting in Mogadishu 
 
DJIBOUTI 00000915  002 OF 002 
 
 
-------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Speaking briefly of the military situation in Mogadishu, 
Youssouf praised AMISOM for having taken the initiative and been 
"more pro-active" in support of the TFG in fighting July 10-11.  He 
said AMISOM was not waiting for the formal amendment of the mandate 
but was already proceeding to implement the intent of the AU 
leadership and the willingness of the TCCs to be more aggressive. 
With AMISOM support, the TFG had gained ground in the strategic 
Karan neighborhood overlooking the port, he said. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Youssouf reported the TFG had captured "some" (NFI) 
foreign fighters, and that two had committed suicide rather than be 
taken alive (one shot himself in the head, and the other took a 
suicide pill). The TFG is preparing to show the captured foreign 
fighters to the media to underscore that the fighting pits Somalis 
against foreign extremists.  Indeed, according to Yusuf, the 
intensity of the July 10-11 fighting was in part due to the 
foreigners fighting fiercely to avoid capture and exposure. 
 
 
 
GODJ Training of TFG Continues 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Youssouf told the diplomatic corps that 458 TFG recruits 
were in Hol Hol for training.  He thanked the USG and French for 
support to the GODJ.  He added that the French had committed to 
begin training "a battalion" (NFI) by the end of July.  Youssouf 
added that Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum told his IGAD 
counterparts that the GOE is prepared to train "several thousand" 
TFG forces at training sites that already exist in eastern 
Ethiopia. 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
------------ 
 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Youssouf's briefing underscored Djibouti's intense focus 
on Somalia developments, and the GODJ's active role in (1) 
diplomatic efforts at IGAD, the AU, and soon UNSC, and (2) direct 
military assistance and training, within GODJ's limited means, to 
the TFG.
