REF: STATE 23822 
 
¶1. (SBU) Acting upon reftel, Embassy Blue Lantern Officer and 
commercial specialist visited the office of Fury 
International Consultant, Ltd. in Haifa on April 18, and met 
with the owner and founder of the company, Shlomo Cohen. 
Based on the interview, the following was learned about Fury 
International Consultant, Ltd. (hereafter referred to as 
Fury): 
 
A) Fury is only a consulting agency.  It is not a consignee, 
and Shlomo Cohen said that he believes it was a mistake that 
Fury was ever designated as a consignee.  Cohen said that 
Fury will never handle the sensitive items referred to in the 
proposed transaction.  He clarified that, as of the date of 
the meeting, the proposed transaction remained in the 
pre-negotiation phase.  Cohen said he believes that Fury was 
mistakenly listed as a consignee because Lockheed Martin 
Sippican (LMS) sent a letter to the State Department 
notifying it that LMS would be entering into a transaction 
with the Israeli MOD on the supply of the SUBMATT kits, and 
the letter mistakenly listed Fury as the consignee or having 
a middle-man role between LMS and the MOD.  Cohen insisted 
that the only service Fury is providing is a consulting 
service. 
 
B) Fury is a two-person company that was founded in 2006. 
Shlomo Cohen -- once the Israeli Naval Attache at the Israeli 
Embassy in the U.S. -- is the founder and owner.  His 
daughter works as his secretary.  The company is named after 
his dog.  His study is the company's office, and is located 
in Cohen's apartment in Haifa.  At the time of the interview, 
Fury was providing consulting services to Lockheed Martin 
Company, LMS, General Dynamics, Fincantieri USA (part of an 
Italian company which produces diesel engines for IAI and 
Israel Shipyards, Ltd.), and Wartsila (a Finnish company that 
has a North American branch).  In Israel, Fury provides its 
services to Rafael, the National Security Council and the 
Prime Minister's Office.  Upon request, Cohen showed emboffs 
his records.  He maintains a copy of the ITAR.  Cohen 
stressed that he does not handle classified materials. 
 
C) Cohen was in the Israeli Navy for 32 years.  As a retired 
senior officer, he has contacts and friends throughout the 
Israel Defense Forces (IDF).  Fury focuses mainly on business 
development.  Cohen said he prefers providing assistance in 
cases that involve security or concern the navy. 
 
D) Cohen stated that, as far as he understands, LMS will 
deliver the SUBMATT kits to Israel's procurement mission in 
New York.  From there, they will be delivered to the Israeli 
MOD, and then to the Israeli Navy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On May 28, Blue Lantern Officer received the 
following letter from Israeli MOD Blue Lantern POC, Rami 
Yungman:
