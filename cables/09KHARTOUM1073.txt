SUBJECT:  Disaster Declaration - Khartoum Floods 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action message.  Please see Paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. (U)  Summary: In late August, heavy rains in Khartoum State 
caused massive flooding in Soba Aradi, Mayo, Jebel Aulia, and other 
settlements largely occupied by South Sudanese and Darfuri 
war-displaced populations. Houses and latrines overflowed and 
collapsed.  Sudanese officials, U.N. agencies, and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) responded to immediate response needs, but have 
requested international assistance.  The latter is needed to prevent 
a public health emergency due to the appalling sanitation situation 
that resulted from the flooding. The Government of Sudan (GOS) lacks 
the capacity to respond to the crisis and has requested 
international assistance.  It is in the foreign policy interest of 
the USG to assist Sudan.  Charge d'Affaires Robert E. Whitehead 
therefore declares a disaster due to the sanitation crisis due to 
flooding in Khartoum State.  End Summary. 
 
Government, NGOs Respond to Flooding, Request Assistance 
---------------------------- ---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U)  Between August 23-29, Khartoum State received unusually 
heavy rain resulting in widespread flooding and a 22-hour power 
outage throughout the region.  During August 29- 30, Sudanese 
government officials and humanitarian organizations conducted joint 
assessments of flood damage and immediate needs.  According to 
Catholic Relief Services (CRS), which works in the IDP settlements 
and participated in the assessment, flooding affected 22,291 
households and damaged or destroyed 6,750 latrines.  Local media 
reports indicated that rain storms had resulted in the death of at 
least 14 people and the collapse of 68 schools. 
 
¶4. (U)  Government agencies and NGOs responded immediately with 
assistance for shelter and clean drinking water for those displaced 
by the floods.  However, on September 6, the Khartoum State Ministry 
of Health requested additional assistance to respond to public 
health concerns caused by damaged and flooded latrines.  CRS notes 
that many affected people remain without appropriate shelter, and 
that additional assistance is required. 
 
Disaster Declaration 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  As Chief of Mission, I hereby declare a flooding disaster in 
Sudanese state of Khartoum due heavy rain, and requests USAID/OFDA 
assistance be made available to assist the affected communities in 
Soba, Mayo, and other IDP settlements around Khartoum State.  The 
scale of the sanitation emergency exceeds the Government of Sudan's 
and the State of Khartoum's joint capacity to respond, and poses a 
severe public health risk to the community.  The Government of Sudan 
has indicated it wishes to receive USG assistance.  It is in the 
interest of the United States to provide help based on local needs 
assessments conducted by U.N. agencies and NGOs.  Such assistance 
will help prevent an outbreak of cholera and other waterborne 
diseases in these densely populated areas. 
 
¶6. (U)  The Charge requests USD 50,000 through the Chief of Mission 
authority to support CRS efforts to respond to the public health 
risk in Khartoum.
