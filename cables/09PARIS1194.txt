     ¶B. STATE 87596 
     ¶C. STATE 87597

¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. With several specific exceptions, France is 
generally supportive of U.S. proposals for the September 
21-25 Australia Group plenary.  Specific feedback is 
summarized below in informal translation, arranged by reftel. 
 The original responses, in French, will be sent separately 
by email to POC.  Post notes that, in response to Ref A, the 
GOF supports the creation of an experts group to discuss 
chemical micro-reactors, but prefers that such a group be 
restricted to government experts and not include industry 
representatives. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary of French response to Ref A (STATE 87595): 
The Australia Group (AG) currently does not currently deal 
with micro-reactors, which can however produce between 20 - 
300 milliliters per minute but are small enough to fit into 
compact locations.  They can also produce chemical agents 
with a level of purity that reduces the need for extra 
purification stages and the amount of waste produced.  Before 
submitting these production systems to AG control, it is 
necessary to answer the following questions: what are the 
current production capabilities of micro-reactors? How are 
they integrated into the chemical industry?  What are 
emerging trends?  France also supports the creation of a 
group of experts to examine the proliferation risks of micro- 
and meso-reactors.  However, France prefers that this group 
be restricted to governmental exports, who would be 
responsible for liaising with their national industry. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Summary of French response to Ref B (STATE 87596): 
The addition of a technical note under the "Valves" section 
(NOTE: French original incorrectly references item "number 9" 
here. END NOTE) clarifying the term "nominal size" is logical 
and acceptable.  However, the technical note under the 
"Pumps" section restricting the term rotors to vacuum pump 
rotors only is too restrictive, since other types of pumps, 
including centrifuge pumps, also have rotors. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Summary of French response to Ref C (STATE 87597): 
France supports the addition of a technical note specifying 
that listed alloys are those that "contain a higher 
percentage by weight" of the named metal than any other 
metal.  Setting a lower limit of a 35% by weight fluorine 
composition for controlled fluoropolymers is also logical. 
Since the compounds with the lowest amount of fluorine by 
weight contain 39%, the lower limit could even be set at 38% 
or 39%.  Regarding the technical note on ferrosilicon, it 
would be logical to clarify that the controlled ferrosilicon 
alloys in the "Pumps" section are those containing 10-18% 
silicon to distinguish them from other silicon-containing 
alloys.  Due to the anti-corrosive and anti-abrasive 
properties of certain ceramic materials, France also agrees 
on the need to include mention of ceramics in the control 
language in the "Pumps" section.  However, this language 
should also be maintained in the "Valves" section, as 
recently added. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Summary of French response to Ref D (STATE 88010): 
The argument to add a technical note to set a control 
threshold of 2.5 millimeters or greater for fluoropolymer 
coatings on products is convincing.  However, although a 2.5 
millimeter coating is necessary to protect against abrasion, 
coatings as thin as 0.75 millimeters could protect against 
corrosion.  Therefore, a lower threshold of 1, 1.5, or 2 
millimeters might be considered, although administratively it 
will be necessary for the control limits for anti-corrosion 
and anti-abrasion coatings to be identical, given the 
practical impossibility of determining whether the end user 
wishes to protect against corrosion or abrasion.
