1.(SBU) Summary.  APHIS and Indonesian health authorities 
co-sponsored a Geographic Information System/Global Positioning 
System training workshop in Tangerang from October 22-31. 
Government of Indonesia (GOI) officials attributed delays in 
Tangerang Trilateral Project implementation to GOI funding 
shortfalls during an October 24 meeting on the project.  The 
Ministry of Health (MOH) is planning a simulation exercise for rapid 
containment of an epicenter outbreak of avian influenza in March 
¶2008. USAID delivered 100,000 new sets of personal prevention 
equipment (PPE) to GOI during the month of October.  According to a 
public opinion poll commissioned by Tempo Magazine (Indonesia's 
leading weekly news magazine), the MOH headed by Siti Fadilah Supari 
received the third highest performance rating among Indonesia's 
ministries.  The MOH confirmed two new cases of avian influenza 
during the week of October 31, raising total confirmed cases to 112, 
with 90 deaths.  End summary.

APHIS Hosts GIS/GPS Workshop 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Over 60 Tangerang municipal government health and agriculture 
workers participated in a Geographic Information System (GIS) and 
Global Positioning System (GPS) training workshop during October 
22-31 sponsored by APHIS/USDA, National Committee for Avian 
Influenza Control and Pandemic Preparedness (KOMNAS), and the 
Tangerang Secretariat. Two scientists from USDA's Center for 
Epidemiology and Animal Health conducted the training.  USDA is 
providing 50 hand-held GPS devices, five desktop computers, and GIS 
software to support the Tangerang Trilateral Project. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Tangerang Project Stalls Due to Lack of GOI Funds 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In an October 24 meeting with Regional Emerging Diseases 
Intervention (REDI) Centre and Embassy officials, Center for 
Diseases Control and Environmental Health Director General Dr. 
Nyoman Kandun and members of the Tangerang Secretariat attributed 
projected delays to GOI funding shortfalls. Although the U.S. and 
Singaporean support for the project is now in place, GOI reportedly 
used 2007 money planned for Tangerang towards an important poverty 
program. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Kandun was not optimistic that additional GOI funds would 
be available for 2007. He believes that most of the requested $2.3 
million for 2008 for Tangerang will materialize, but access to funds 
may be delayed until April or May.  Kandun promised to do everything 
possible to secure the funds for next year.  The Ministry of 
Agriculture did not request specific 2008 funds to support AI 
control in poultry.  Without some assurance of GOI funding, the 
project will remain stymied. 
 
¶5. (SBU) AI surveillance in poultry by the local Animal Health 
Service and the Participatory Disease Surveillance team in Tangerang 
indicates that AI is endemic in the district and that more human 
cases can be expected if appropriate control measures are not 
instituted.  Since most of the Tangerang cases (13 of 14 cases) 
occurred in the district and not in the municipality, the 
Secretariat recommended expanding the trilateral project coverage to 
 
SIPDIS 
the district.

CDC COLLABORATES ON PLANS FOR SIMULATION TRAINING 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶6. (U) U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is working closely 
with the MOH, KOMNAS, the Indonesian military, Indonesian police, 
and other key Ministries to plan a field simulation exercise for 
rapid containment of an AI outbreak with sustained human to human 
transmission. The simulation exercise will test operational plans 
(developed by inter-sectoral working groups), for rapid containment 
 
JAKARTA 00003075  002 OF 002 
 
 
of an avian flu outbreak in Jembrana District, Bali in March 2008 
(date TBD). 
 
¶7. (SBU) CDC is also working with the MOH zoonosis sub-directorate 
on a communication strategy for AI at the provincial and district 
levels.  Recruitment is underway for an Egyptian consultant to 
assist MOH establish a work plan for the BSL3 laboratory.  The MOH 
together with CDC plan to revitalize the CDC Field Epidemiology 
Training Program (FETP) in Indonesia.  A team of external 
consultants will arrive November 4-14 to review activities and 
assist in the development of a long-term plan. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
USAID EXPANDS PPE DISTRIBUTION AND TRAINING 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) In October, USAID provided 100,000 new sets of Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to the GOI for use in human and poultry 
surveillance and response activities.  USAID is sending a portion to 
KOMNAS for an emergency stockpile and distributing other PPE to 
about 100 referral hospitals in Indonesia. USAID will provide 
additional PPE as the current stock is depleted. 
 
¶9. (U) USAID Community Based Avian Influenza Control program (CBAIC) 
trained 13,138 volunteers to support AI prevention and surveillance 
services to communities throughout Java, Bali, and parts of Sumatra. 
With support from USAID, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) commenced refresher as well as expansion training of animal 
health surveillance and response officers and expect fully trained 
officers covering all districts on Java, Bali, and Sumatra by the 
end of May 2008. 
 
¶10. (U) The World Health Organization (WHO), with support from 
USAID, continues to train human surveillance officers.  To date, 
authorities have trained 104 officers to cover most districts in 
Java, Bali, and parts of Sumatra.  Training in North Sumatra will 
commence on November 5.

INDONESIANS SATISFIED WITH MINISTRY OF HEALTH 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶11. (U)  In a recent public opinion poll of President Susilo Bambang 
Yudhoyono and his government published in Tempo weekly magazine, 
Indonesians ranked the MOH, headed by Minister Supari, as third 
highest in performance(75.9%)of all the Ministries after the 
Indonesian Military (84%) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs 
(77.6%).
