¶1. (SBU) On April 16, the Egyptian Ministry of Health and 
Population (MOHP) confirmed its seventh human avian influenza 
(AI) case this year: a 2-year-old boy from the Sharqia 
Governorate north of Cairo.  This marks Egypt's 50th 
confirmed AI case overall, and the third in the month of 
April.  The child was hospitalized the day after he fell ill. 
The treating physicians administered Tamiflu to him 
immediately, and he, unlike the last two AI victims, is 
expected to recover (ref A). 
 
¶2. (SBU) A notable spike in AI cases occurred earlier this 
year when the virus struck four Egyptians over a course of 
ten days in late February and early March (refs A and B).
