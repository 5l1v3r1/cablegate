SUBJECT: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS PROGRESS: FEBRUARY 2007 
 
 
¶1. Summary: In February of the 2006-2007 waiver year, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) did not resolve any Embassy-registered property claims. Since January 1995, Embassy-registered property claims of 654 American citizens (Amcits) have been resolved. There remain 682 registered property claims belonging to 297 Amcits, after the deactivation of two ineligible claims. Including Amcits' claims not registered with the Embassy, a total of 4,529 Amcits' claims have been resolved since January 1995. Most have involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds (bonos de pago de indemnizacion or BPIs). As of December 31, 2006, the GON has issued BPIs with a face value of US$319,700,000 to Embassy-registered claimants. End Summary.
 
NO RESOLUTIONS IN FEBRUARY 2007 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  There were no Amcit resolutions reported for February 2007. 
This inaction can be explained in part by the transition from the 
Bolanos to the Ortega administration.  President Daniel Ortega was 
inaugurated on January 10, 2007.  On January 22, 2007, Mireya Molina 
Torres was named the Superintendent of Property (septel). 
 
STATUS OF AMCIT PROPERTY AS OF 02/28/07 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The following is a snapshot of current Amcit property claims. 
To differentiate between claims registered before and after the July 
31, 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act deadline, the Embassy 
maintains separate registers.
