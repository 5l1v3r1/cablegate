¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: Mission requires the Department's urgent 
assistance in securing Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) 
clearance for two GOI officials who hope to travel to 
Washington for anti-corruption consultations with the FBI and 
other USG officials.  These officials were specifically 
invited by the FBI for these meetings.  Facilitating this 
travel is a United States priority.  As reftels have 
outlined, this is one of a series of difficulties we have had 
with the SAO process for key Indonesian officials.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Mission requests the Department's urgent assistance 
in securing interagency SAO clearance for two Indonesian 
officials to travel to Washington on December 13 for meetings 
with FBI Director Mueller at FBI Headquarters and with 
Attorney General Mukasey.  These officials are part of a 
delegation whom FBI Deputy Director Pistole met during his 
recent visit to Indonesia and specifically invited to 
Washington for this purpose.  The head of the delegation, who 
is an important partner in the War on Terrorism, fighting 
corruption and transnational crime, has threatened to cancel 
the entire trip if these two individuals cannot travel.  Both 
are senior officials well known to the Mission.   Hamzah is 
the Chief of the Indonesian Anti-Corruption Commission's 
(KPK) Investigative Unit and therefore must be included on 
the trip. 
 
¶3.  (U) Consular Acting Chief Paul Howard sent particulars of 
the two individuals by email in an expedite request to Laura 
Stein in CA/VO.  Their names are Chandra Hamzah, 
Commissioner, and Budi Ibrahim, Director. 
 
¶4.  (U) Fighting corruption in Indonesia and building 
cooperative links between GOI law enforcement officials and 
their USG counterparts is a key USG priority here.  The 
difficulties Hamzah and Ibrahim are having with the SAO 
process threaten progress on this important objective.  This 
is not the first time the SAO process has created 
difficulties for senior GOI officials, as noted in reftel. 
Mission requests that the Department work urgently to address 
this problem.
