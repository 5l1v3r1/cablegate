OZGUR GUNDEM:   A bomb explosion took place on Friday (05/19) 
in a trash can located in front of the apartment building where 
Sabahattin Suvagci, former DEHAP (Democratic People's Party) 
provincial chairperson, has been living in Hakkari.  No 
casualties have been reported.  The daily hints that bombings 
are being orchestrated to refute claims that bombings in the 
region that took place in the second half of 2005 abruptly 
stopped when defendants of Semdinli case were arrested.  PKK, 
according to the paper, had already denied any links with the 
May 3 bombing incident this year in Hakkari, which targeted a 
school bus.  That bombing, the daily hints, has reportedly 
already been used by the defendants themselves in a May 4 court 
session to prove that bombings did not abruptly stop following 
arrest of Semdinli case defendants.
