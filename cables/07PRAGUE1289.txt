REF: STATE 163955 
 
(SBU) Czech Ambassador Josef Koutsky in the MFA Office for 
Middle East and Africa Affairs informed Embassy officials 
that Deputy Foreign Minister Tomas Pojar will represent the 
GOCR at the December 17 donors conference in Paris.  What, if 
any, assistance the Czech Government will provide is 
currently under discussion within the relevant MFA offices. 
While Koutsky did not reference any specific amounts, we were 
given the impression that if any bilateral assistance is 
provided, it is likely to be relatively modest.
