SUBJ: MGSF01 - SWINE FLU UPDATE FOR NEW ZEALAND 
 
WELLINGTON 00000106  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  There are currently 10 probable cases and 56 
suspected cases of Swine Flu in New Zealand, all New Zealanders who 
returned from Mexico on April 25 via Los Angeles, or who have had 
contact with them.  The GNZ expects the World Health Organization 
(WHO) lab in Melbourne, Australia to confirm within the next two 
days whether the 10 probable cases have Swine Flu. The GNZ is urging 
all incoming airline passengers from North America and Mexico to see 
a doctor if flu-like symptoms occur and is preparing to issue a 
travel warning, urging New Zealanders to avoid non-essential travel 
to Mexico.  Embassy Wellington has posted a Swine Flu notice and 
information update on its website.  End Summary. 
 
Swine Flu Makes Big News in NZ 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On Saturday, April 25, a group of 22 Spanish language 
students and three teachers from Rangitoto College (an Auckland high 
school) returned to Auckland after three weeks in Mexico.  The group 
traveled from Mexico, boarded Air New Zealand Flight 1 in Los 
Angeles, and landed in Auckland Saturday morning.  Upon landing, 
thirteen students and one teacher experienced flu-like symptoms. 
Nine or 10 had mild symptoms; and three or four had moderate to 
severe symptoms and one of that number was hospitalized as a 
precaution (and was subsequently released).  All were tested for 
Influenza A (of which H1N1, or Swine Flu, is a subset).  The results 
were positive and were forwarded to the WHO lab in Melbourne, 
Australia for a determination of whether the victims have Swine Flu. 
 The results should be known in a day or two, but NZ health 
officials say it is "probable" that 10 of the tests will reveal 
Swine Flu.  For that reason, and out of an abundance of caution, 
health authorities are treating those cases as H1N1 Swine Flu.  The 
ill students and their families are in voluntary quarantine. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Another group of 14 students, two staff members and two 
parents from Northcote College (another Auckland high school) 
returned to Auckland from Mexico on Saturday morning via Air New 
Zealand Flight 5 from Los Angeles, arriving shortly after Flight 1. 
Three of the students were experiencing flu-like symptoms and were 
tested for Influenza A, but results were negative. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)In addition to the 10 probable Swine Flu cases, the MOH and 
local health authorities are  presently monitoring 56 other cases in 
NZ which are "suspected" to be Swine Flu and are located throughout 
the country.  All are being quarantined and all have been given 
Tamiflu. 
 
None of the Suspected Cases are Severe 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) None of the probable or suspected cases are severe. 
Health Minister Tony Ryall announced that those students who tested 
positive for Influenza A are all responding well to treatment and 
their cases are relatively mild.  Nevertheless, local NZ health 
authorities have asked all of the potential victims and their 
families to stay at home. 
 
The GNZ Response 
---------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The NZ Ministry of Health (MOH) is attempting to contact 
all passengers on both of the flights (364 passengers on Flight 1 
and 269 on Flight 5) and has asked, through the media, that 
passengers contact NZ health authorities for information.  The MOH 
contacted the Embassy's consular section in Auckland on Tuesday, 
promising to forward the names of Americans on the two flights.  MOH 
asked the consular section to check its consular records for any 
contact information it might have for these Amcits.  As of COB 
Tuesday, the list of Amcits had not been received from the MOH. 
When and if Post receives the list, we will reach out to any Amcits 
on the list whose contact information we have. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) On Monday, NZ health officials began screening incoming 
airline passengers from North America and Mexico and are urging them 
to see a doctor if they experience flu-like symptoms.  Prime 
Minister John Key stated to the media that New Zealanders should 
 
WELLINGTON 00000106  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
think carefully before visiting Mexico.  According to Nik Kiddle, 
the NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) official who is 
directing the Ministry's Swine Flu response, MFAT will be issuing a 
travel warning later today consistent with the PM's statement.  The 
warning will urge New Zealanders to avoid non-essential travel to 
Mexico.  According to Kiddle, MFAT was motivated to issue the 
warning after the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) posted a 
similar warning on its website. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The MOH reports that it has 1.4 million doses of Tamiflu. 
NZ health authorities have offered the anti-viral drug to all 
potentially infected individuals. 
 
Obtaining Information from GNZ Sources Difficult 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The Swine Flu situation in Mexico and the potential spread 
of the virus to NZ has received prominent front-page coverage in 
both national papers for the last two days.  The MOH hotline is 
clogged with requests for information, and even MFAT is having 
difficulty getting briefed on recent developments.  According to 
Kiddle, MFAT is planning to conduct a briefing for the Wellington 
diplomatic corps, but he has not been able to obtain regular updates 
from the MOH.  Poloff's attempts to obtain information from MOH 
officials also proved unsuccessful.  In Poloff's discussion with MOH 
Deputy Director for Public Health Fran McGrath, McGrath declined to 
answer questions.  She stated that the MOH is routinely sharing 
information with the WHO and the US CDC, and the USG should first 
directly request information from those organizations.  If those 
requests are not answered, McGrath said she would then respond to 
written inquiries from Embassy Wellington. 
 
Embassy Wellington Response 
--------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (U) The US Consulate in Auckland has added the following 
advisory to Embassy Wellington's website: 
-- Notice to Americans in New Zealand About Swine Flu: 
The US Centers for Disease Control is presently assisting the World 
Health Organization and Mexican Ministry of Health in responding to 
this public health concern.  Information concerning swine flu and 
the epidemiological investigation underway can be found at 
www.cdc.gov/swineflu.  Additional information on swine flu and 
pandemic influenza can be accessed through www.pandemicflu.gov. 
 
Up-dated information from New Zealand's Ministry of Health is 
available at http: //www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf 
/indexmh/mexican-swine-influenza-update-27040 9. 
 
-- Update: from New Zealand Ministry of Health 
If you were a passenger on Air New Zealand Flight NZ1 from Los 
Angeles arriving in Auckland at FIVE AM on 25/04/2009, the New 
Zealand Ministry of Health asks you to please contact the Public 
Health Service urgently to discuss the possible need for protective 
measures such as antiviral medication. 
Anyone who has travelled from Mexico or North America in the last 
two weeks, especially if you have since developed flu-like symptoms, 
should contact the Ministry of Health hotline (0800 611 116) for 
information. 
 
Possible MFAT Request for USG Assistance 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU) MFAT's Kiddle stated that if Swine Flu is confirmed and 
the spread of the illness from trans-Pacific air passengers becomes 
worse, the GNZ may ask the USG to assist in screening the health of 
passengers before they embark on flights to NZ.  Kiddle also 
mentioned that MFAT would appreciate anything the USG could do to 
help raise awareness among the Pacific Island Countries who receive 
direct flights from the US, such as Samoa and the Cook Islands.
