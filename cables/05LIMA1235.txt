 ¶1. Answers to Ref D questions: 
 
CONFIRM THAT THE AIR FORCE RECEIVED THE COMMODITIES LISTED IN 
REF D, PARAGRAPH 4 BELOW FROM NEDISA PERUANA? 
-- Answer: Yes. The end-user, Air Force Grupo 42 Commander in 
Iquitos, Loreto Department, confirms receipt, and said the 
parts were delivered on time. 
 
IS NEDISA PERUANA PERFORMING MAINTENANCE WORK FOR THE

HOW LONG HAS THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE DONE BUSINESS WITH 
NEDISA PERUANA? 
-- Answer: For Grupo 42, only in 2003. 
 
DOES THE MOD VIEW THE COMPANY AS A RELIABLE SUPPLIER? 
-- Answer: The Grupo 42 Commander considers Nedisa to be a 
reliable supplier, since the one and only Grupo 42 order was 
received on time. (Note: According to the principal Air Force 
procurement officer (Ref A), the Air Force decided to not 
make any more purchases from Nedisa due to long delays in 
delivery of other ordered parts. End Note. ) 
 
DOES THE MOD PLAN TO CONTINUE USING NEDISA PERUANA AS A 
SUPPLIER FOR AIRCRAFT 
PARTS? 
 
-- Answer:  The Air Force Grupo 42 Commander would like to 
use Nedisa in the future.  (Note: The Peruvian Air Force 
National Command is not/not now using and does not/not plan 
to use Nedisa in the future (Ref A). End Note.)
