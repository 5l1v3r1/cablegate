¶1. (U) Summary:  A ceasefire in Malakal between the Sudan Armed 
Forces (SAF) and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) appears 
to have held through December 1, although sporadic gunfire and 
looting continues.  UN agencies and NGOs are providing initial 
humanitarian assistance, including assisting the wounded and burying 
the dead.  Initial estimates by aid workers in Malakal project 
roughly 250 civilian and military deaths from violence that erupted 
November 27 (reftel).  The UN estimates that 300-400 civilians were 
wounded.  End summary.

Ceasefire Holding 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The ceasefire agreement, brokered on November 29 by UNMIS 
personnel under the auspices of the Combined Joint Military 
Commission (CJMC), a body set up under the 2005 Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement (CPA), appears to have ended fighting.  The fighting in 
Malakal is the most serious between SAF and SPLA units since the CPA 
was signed.  Under the Malakal ceasefire, the parties agreed to 
cease hostilities, permit the local population to return to their 
homes, and turn over the bodies of dead combatants to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for burial. 
Subsequent to the agreement, SPLA forces reportedly withdrew to 
positions in the southern part of Malakal and the SAF reoccupied 
various locations, including its headquarters, which had been 
briefly captured by the SPLA.

Looting, Threats Continue on November 30 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Though SPLA and SAF units withdrew from the center of 
Malakal, other armed elements continued to loot houses and threaten 
civilians in residential and commercial areas of the town.  A UN 
security official based in Juba called the looters "opportunistic" 
local militia.  Another UN official, speaking from Malakal, says 
some SAF soldiers participated in the looting.  The CJMC reportedly 
ordered that no one would be permitted to bear weapons in Malakal, 
and that no more than five persons could gather at any one place. 
Despite these orders, there were several reports of looting in 
Malakal on November 30, including specific accounts of the targeting 
of males believed to be supporters of the SPLA, beatings and 
shootings of women and children, firing into the air, and threats 
against persons who objected to the looting.  A group of 
approximately 100 SAF soldiers reportedly attempted to return to the 
SAF barracks, but was interdicted by the SPLA.  UNMIS officers 
intervened, and UNMIS troops escorted the SAF forces back to their 
barracks.

Deaths, Woundings Estimated in the Hundreds 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Tallying the number of dead and injured in Malakal remained 
impossible as of December 1 due to insecurity.  Some of the 
estimated 300-400 civilians injured, according to humanitarian 
workers, were still unable to reach medical assistance because of 
ongoing instability.  One senior UN official, who requested 
anonymity, estimated the total civilian and military death toll at 
¶250. 
 
¶5. (SBU) UN sources confirmed that SAF had requested assistance in 
burying casualties formally on November 30.  According to the same 
sources, the SAF lost a total of 30-35 soldiers, including 4 senior 
officers.  A senior SPLA official told Consulate General Juba 
officers on November 30 the SPLA had yet to determine its losses. 
However, reports from humanitarian workers in Malakal suggested the 
SPLA had lost at least 11 soldiers.  On the night of November 30, 
the ICRC transported eight SPLA bodies to the SPLA barracks south of 
Malakal.  Another three SPLA bodies reportedly remained at the SAF 
barracks. 
 
¶6. (SBU) A senior SPLA official advised Consulate General Juba 
officers that 57 wounded SPLA soldiers had been evacuated to Yei in 
Western Equatoria.  Another 91 SPLA casualties, according to UN 
sources, were evacuated to Khorflus.

¶7. (U) On November 30, the UN Office of the Deputy Resident and 
Humanitarian Coordinator in Khartoum announced that the UN had begun 
delivering medical assistance to the estimated 300-400 civilians 
injured during the two days of violence in Malakal.  The UN is 
working to provide food, water, and shelter materials to those who 
fled to escape the fighting.  Humanitarian teams are assessing 
civilian casualties, infrastructure damage, and he availability of

food, water, and medical supplies for ongoing assistance. 
 
¶8. (U) The Malakal Teaching Hospital sent out an urgent request on 
November 30 for assistance, including nursing support; ambulances, 
fuel, and ambulance spare parts; blankets and mattresses; and 
medications.  Some of the requested material was delivered via a UN 
support flight on December 1.
