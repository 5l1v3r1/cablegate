REF: 09 STATE 120803 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. (U) SUMMARY:  The United States Department of 
Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) 
and the United States Department of State are sponsoring a 
Regional Energy Planning and Nonproliferation Workshop in 
Muscat, Oman, from May 9 to 13, 2010 (see reftel).  The 
United States Government values opportunities like this 
workshop for peaceful nuclear cooperation with states party 
to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
The event, sponsored by DOE/NNSA's International Nuclear 
Safeguards and Engagement Program (INSEP) and DOS's 
Partnership for Nuclear Security (PNS), will (1) raise 
awareness of key elements of energy planning by providing 
participants with a basic overview of various energy options, 
including renewable forms of energy, fossil fuels, and 
nuclear energy; (2) help participants understand the 
implications of particular energy choices, including the need 
for associated infrastructure development; (3) provide 
explicit understanding of the nexus between nuclear energy 
and nonproliferation, linking this option to relevant global 
norms and responsibilities; and (4) identify specific topics 
for follow-on bilateral and other forms of engagement.  Three 
representatives each from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, 
Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, 
Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates will be invited to 
participate in this seminar. A representative from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Arab Atomic Energy 
Agency will also be invited to attend.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (U) BACKGROUND:  The United States Department of 
Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) 
and the United States Department of State (DOS) are 
sponsoring an energy planning and nonproliferation workshop 
in Muscat, Oman, from May 9 to 13, 2010.  The United States 
Government values opportunities like this workshop for 
peaceful nuclear cooperation with states party to the Treaty 
on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The event, 
sponsored by DOE/NNSA's International Nuclear Safeguards and 
Engagement Program (INSEP) and DOS's Partnership for Nuclear 
Security (PNS), will be a follow-on activity to the March 
2009 Middle East Infrastructure Preparedness Workshop, held 
in Amman, Jordan.  During the energy planning session of the 
March 2009 Workshop, several participants expressed an 
interest in learning more about energy planning and the tools 
available for modeling.  In response to this interest, INSEP 
organized a pilot energy planning workshop in September 2009 
in Amman, Jordan, to determine the best model for a regional 
workshop, and to provide training to individuals in Jordan 
who will serve as co-instructors for the May 2010 course. 
 
¶4. (U) Following the pilot workshop, INSEP outlined the 
following four objectives for an international energy 
planning course:  (1) raise awareness of key elements of 
energy planning by providing participants with a basic 
overview of various energy options, including renewable forms 
of energy, fossil fuels, and nuclear energy; (2) help 
participants understand the implications of particular energy 
choices, including the need for associated infrastructure 
development; (3) provide explicit understanding of the nexus 
between nuclear energy and nonproliferation, linking this 
option to relevant global norms and responsibilities; and (4) 
identify specific topics for follow-on bilateral and other 
forms of engagement. 
 
¶5. (U) INSEP and PNS plan to invite three participants each 
from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, 
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Iraq, and the United Arab 
Emirates to participate in the event.  A representative from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Arab Atomic 
Energy Agency will also be invited to participate in the 
 
STATE 00004712  002 OF 003 
 
SUBJECT: INVITATION TO DOE/NNSA EVENT ENTITLED "REGIONAL 
ENERGY PLANNING AND NONPROLIFERATION WORKSHO 
workshop.  The current draft of the workshop agenda includes 
five days of activities, beginning on a Sunday, and lasting 
from 8:30 AM to 2:30 PM daily.  INSEP and PNS will cover the 
costs of those attending the workshop from outside of the 
host country, as well as logistical support during the event. 
 Note that some of the more affluent Gulf States (e.g., UAE 
and Qatar) have declined these funds for previous DOE/NNSA 
workshops.  END BACKGROUND.
