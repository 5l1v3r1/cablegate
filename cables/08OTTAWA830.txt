SUBJECT: 2010 G8 MEETING TO BE HELD IN CENTRAL ONTARIO 
 
¶1.  On June 19, Canadian Prime Minister Harper announced that 
the Canadian-hosted 2010 G8 Summit will be held at the 
Deerhurst Resort in Huntsville, Ontario.  Canada last hosted 
the G8 Summit in Kananaskis, Alberta in 2002.  Harper noted 
that "Huntsville is a jewel in the Canadian Shield and an 
ideal location for this gathering of world leaders.  Our 
international guests will be charmed by the uniquely Canadian 
beauty of the region and by the warm hospitality of 
Muskokans."  Clearly Harper intends to host the G8 meeting, 
but he must be returned to office in a federal election which 
must be held before October 2009. 
 
¶2.  The Prime Minister emphasized that the Summit will be a 
tremendous opportunity to promote Canada's values and 
interests on the world stage; to advocate for open markets 
and free trade; to insist on truly global action against 
global warning; and to champion freedom, democracy, human 
rights, ad the rule of law.  Speaking to a domestic audience, 
Harper also noted that Huntsville and the surrounding Muskoka 
region in central Ontario will benefit from the significant 
economic activity associated with the Summit, noting that the 
Kananaskis Summit generated an estimated C$300 million for 
the regional economy.  He added that the international media 
attending the Summit would introduce millions of potential 
tourists to the attractions of Ontario's cottage country 
which is full of beautiful lakes, forests and wetlands and a 
popular summer resort for Ontario residents. 
 
¶3.  Embassy comment:  Another probable factor in the site 
selection left unstated by Harper is the area's relative 
remoteness from Canada's major population areas.  Toronto is 
2 1/2 hours' drive from the site (135 miles) and Ottawa is 4 
hours' drive (215 miles).  This should make it easier for 
security to keep the inevitable demonstrators at bay from the 
resort and minimize disruptions to a lightly populated area. 
Lessons learned from the Kananaskis Summit include the 
advantage of fostering an intimate atmosphere and the ease of 
controlling the message with restricted media space and 
access to leaders.  End comment.
