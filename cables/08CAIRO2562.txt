SUBJECT: UPDATE ON BABY TRAFFICKING NETWORK

¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  This cable updates ref (A) which reported 
ongoing investigation into child trafficking in Egypt.  Another 
Egyptian doctor and couple have been arrested by Egyptian State 
Security Investigative Services (SSIS) for their involvement in the 
baby trafficking network uncovered by the Cairo Fraud Prevention 
Unit (FPU).  The recent arrests by SSIS have revealed that many more 
babies may have been trafficked by this network over at least the 
last six years.  The review by the Fraud Prevention Manager (FPM) 
and A/RSO-I of past American Citizen Services (ACS) cases for 
Consular Reports of Birth Abroad (CRBA) takes into account the 
possibility that this baby trafficking network may have been in 
operation for as long as 20 years.  In addition, the FPM and A/RSO-I 
have uncovered at least three cases of children who may have 
fraudulently obtained U.S. citizenship and are now adolescents or 
teenagers growing up as American citizens.  End Summary. 
 
The Arrests 
----------- 
 
  ¶2.  (SBU) The latest arrests by SSIS involve a doctor who admitted 
to falsifying more than 500 letters for couples stating he had 
personally delivered infants in his clinic.  The clinic was 
subsequently closed by SSIS. In addition, the doctor admitted to 
receiving anywhere between 10 Egyptian pounds (LE) to 1000 LE (USD 2 
- 200) for each fraudulent letter.  SSIS has also arrested an 
American woman and her Egyptian husband who had appeared at the ACS 
unit in October attempting to document a newborn as their natural 
child.  At the time, the couple fit the profile of past cases 
described in reftel and processing was suspended.  When SSIS 
recently arrested the couple, they immediately asked for a lawyer 
and have refused to cooperate.  The lawyer is the same one requested 
by another couple and is well known in Egypt as a vocal, sometimes 
provocative, advocate of the Coptic community.  To date, SSIS has 
arrested a total of eight individuals involved in this baby 
trafficking network and is searching for another two doctors. The 
ACS unit has reported the arrests of the Amcits (see refs B and C) 
and will be following up with a visit by a consular officer. 
 
The Rescues 
----------- 
 
 ¶3.  (SBU) SSIS has reportedly rescued four babies that had been 
bought by individuals who were attempting to leave Egypt with them 
falsely documented as American citizens.  In all of the cases except 
one, the individuals have been arrested.  In one case, the couple, 
both American citizens, have returned to the United States leaving 
the baby in the care of another individual to whom they paid 3000 LE 
(USD 600).  This individual, an Egyptian national, has been detained 
and questioned by SSIS.  She admitted to having accompanied the 
Amcit couple to the house of a Coptic nun and having witnessed a 
payment of money for the newborn.  SSIS is trying to determine 
whether this nun and the one described in reftel are the same 
individual.  The individual has also implicated a Ministry of Health 
official who she claims facilitated the issuance of false birth 
certificates. 
 
 
 
Where are the children? 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) An exhaustive review of ACS historical files has 
identified more than a dozen cases of suspected related fraud 
stretching back as far as 1989.  These past cases have been flagged 
as possible fraud with processing at ACS Cairo suspended if the 
application is still pending.  However, extensive searches by the 
FPM and A/RSO-I of the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) have 
identified some cases where the Amcit parents appear to have 
documented the child at another U.S. consulate and brought him or 
her to the United States.  In three cases the children are now 
either adolescents or teenagers living in the United States with 
their "parents."  DS investigations have been opened on these U.S. 
cases.  With regards to the possibility that hundreds of other 
babies were bought, and then later obtained fraudulent valid 
Egyptian birth certificates, SSIS is still questioning the arrested 
individuals.  The cases that FPU has uncovered in ACS have all 
indicated that the babies were being bought by childless Coptic 
couples, at least one of whom was an American citizen. 
 
Suggested Press Guidance 
------------------------ 
 
CAIRO 00002562  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Post recommends that responses to media inquiries be 
limited to the following: 
 
We do not comment on ongoing investigations. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
 ¶6.  (SBU) Due to the apparent largely Coptic involvement in these 
cases, the inevitable press coverage may well take a sectarian 
slant.  A brief story regarding the investigation appeared in a 
limited circulation independent newspaper on December 21, and we 
expect more to follow.  Given Egypt's already highly-charged 
sectarian environment, and the occasional accusations that the U.S. 
and other Western Embassies see themselves as "protectors" of the 
Coptic minority, this case may elicit strong reactions from the 
Egyptian media and public. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  To add fuel to the possible fire, the arrested Coptic nun 
has reportedly told SSIS that she was bringing the babies into the 
Coptic Church by selling them to Coptic couples, implying that some 
of the babies may have been non-Christian.  In Egypt, there are few 
issues more provocative than religious conversion, and some will 
undoubtedly view the adoption of a Muslim child by a Christian 
couple as akin to forced religious conversion. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)   The case has high-level attention from the Ministry of 
Interior.  Post will continue to closely coordinate with the GOE, 
and to report on developments both in the investigation and in the 
political, media and public reaction to the case.
