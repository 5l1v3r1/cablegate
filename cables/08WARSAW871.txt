¶1. (SBU)  Post regrets that it does not have any names 
meeting criteria contained in reftels to recommend for the 
Maktoum Foundation Entrepreneurs Conference.  Ref A requested 
that discussion of the event and potential invitees be 
restricted to USG only.  If that restriction were removed, 
post might be able to identify potential candidates, through 
its Muslim outreach program.
