SANCTIONS 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  The Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) announced on 
January 7 that it converted its reserves to the euro and other 
currencies, and that it will no longer use the U.S. dollar for 
financial transactions.  The CBOS named U.S. sanctions as one of the 
primary reasons for this change.  Leading economic analysts and 
businessmen have been less than supportive of this decision, 
predicting this change will negatively impact Sudan's small 
businesses and that the CBOS will ultimately return to using the 
dollar.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) At a January 7 press conference, Dr. Sabir Mohamed Hassan, 
the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan and his two deputies, 
Elijah Malouk and Bader El-Din Mahmmoud Abbas, announced that the 
CBOS completed the conversion of the bank's reserves from the U.S. 
dollar to other foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the 
sterling, and currencies from Arab Gulf states. Hassan stated that 
U.S. economic sanctions imposed on Sudan since 1997 are one of the 
primary reasons for this decision.  Hassan specifically mentioned 
that the continued use of dollars has led to frozen assets, delays 
in transfers, and an overall increased risk of having any 
transaction blocked. 
 
¶3. (U)  Hassan stated that it is advisable, though not compulsory, 
for the private sector and Sudanese citizens to follow suit and 
avoid using the U.S. dollar.  He added that the private sector and 
Sudanese citizens have the right to keep their accounts in U.S. 
dollars, but warned that these individuals must realize the risk 
involved with potentially having these transactions and transfers 
blocked. 
 
¶4. (U)  The Governor also stated that the CBOS completed the 
conversion of Sudanese Dinars (SD) to the new Sudanese Pound (SDG) 
in full compliance with the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. He 
stated that the total cost of this conversion was $150 million 
dollars, as estimated by the International Monetary Fund. He stated 
that partners in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development 
(IGAD) and the international community provided $40 million, 
international donors contributed $30 million dollars, and the U.K. 
and Holland contributed $10 million. He reported that only $22 
million of these funds were received and the remaining $110 million 
will be paid by the Sudanese Government of National Unity (GoNU). 
 
¶5.  (U) On January 8, Abdel Rahim Hamdi, an ex-Minister of Finance 
turned businessmen and NCP advisor, told EconOff that the CBOS's 
conversion to the euro will have an impact on Sudanese businesses. 
He said that "businessmen will need to become aware of this change 
and react accordingly."  Hamdi added that the CBOS needs to ensure 
that there are sufficient euros in Sudan for sustained business 
activity.  He noted that small international businessmen will be 
impacted the most, particularly when working in geographic areas 
that prefer the dollar. Hamdi specifically mentioned that Arab Gulf 
States prefer to operate with dollars, as oil is priced and paid for 
in U.S. currency.  He also said that businessmen will be hurt by the 
one-half to one percent exchange fees that will incur when 
transferring their money back and forth between different 
currencies, and that this will ultimately hurt their profits.  He 
noted "these business people might have to sacrifice a bit and they 
are apprehensive about this." 
 
¶6.  (U)  Professor Ali Abdalla Ali, an advisor at the Khartoum stock 
exchange and lecturer of Economics at Sudan University, told EconOff 
on January 8 that the CBOS's move to the euro "is an emotional 
political reaction rather than sound economic policy."  Ali 
predicted that the Sudanese will find this conversion to the euro 
unmanageable and "depending on the political mood" will return to 
the dollar in six months to a year.  Ali also expressed concern 
about the value of the Sudanese Pound, as the exchange rate of the 
pound is managed with respect to the dollar.  He also stated that if 
the CBOS's conversion to euro is to be successful, there will have 
to be a change in the overall mentality of Sudanese citizens "who 
prefer to calculate the value of items in dollars and Sudanese 
pounds, not the euro or other currencies." 
 
¶7.  (U)  COMMENT:  The CBOS's decision to move to the euro and other 
currencies represents one of the most significant and concrete 
actions taken by the Government of Sudan to circumvent U.S. 
sanctions.  While the government immediately sold off some of its 
assets and placed minor restrictions on foreign currency 
transactions following the May 28, 2007 tightening of U.S. 
sanctions, the Government of Sudan repeatedly denied that these 
actions in May and June were related to U.S. sanctions.  GoS 
officials and the CBOS leadership have all acknowledged that this 
latest move to the euro will mitigate the pressure of U.S. 
sanctions, though it remains to be seen whether this action will be 
economically tenable for months and years to come.  END COMMENT.
