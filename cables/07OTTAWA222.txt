¶1.  (U) Two weeks after the January 23 implementation of the 
Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) rule requiring 
U.S.-bound air travelers to hold a passport as proof of 
identity and citizenship, there have been no serious problems 
or delays reported at any of Canada's airports.  Having been 
advised of the DHS phased-in implementation period (whereby 
travelers who are qualified in all respects except possession 
of a passport will be admitted to the U.S.), air carriers 
have allowed passengers to board or go to Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) preclearance without a passport.  As it 
turned out, by January 29 over 99 percent of Canadian and 
American U.S.-bound air travelers checking in at Canadian 
airports did have passports.  The chaos and disruptions 
anticipated by many, including the media, did not 
materialize. 
 
¶2.  (U) Consulates across Canada have reported on the initial 
implementation of the January 23 air rule and filed 
subsequent updates with Embassy Ottawa.  The small number of 
passengers who checked in without passports (or had expired 
passports) were allowed to board after being given the 
passport requirement information and advised to obtain a 
passport.  In only three instances were passengers denied 
boarding, and two of these three appear not to be 
WHTI-related denials.  Implementation has been variously 
described by CBP officers, airlines, and airport authorities 
as "problem-free," "a non-issue," "painless," and "a 
non-event event." 
 
¶3.  (U) Canadian media representatives present at the 
airports looking for delays and long queues, irate 
passengers, or "horror stories," were disappointed.  There 
were no big problems.  Passengers at some airports were in 
visibly good spirits, possibly because the anticipated hassle 
at check-in did not occur.  One reporter expressed 
disappointment that there was no story--everything was going 
fine.  Though WHTI implementation was not considered 
newsworthy, the delay in issuance of passports to Canadian 
citizens was, and several stories have run on that problem 
over the past two weeks. 
 
¶4.  (U) On January 25, Ambassador Wilkins sent his 
congratulations to Mission Canada employees for the 
successful implementation of the WHTI air rule.  He noted 
that this team effort--in publicity and outreach to inform 
the public, and in talking with airlines, airport 
authorities, and Canadian government officials--had averted 
the confusion which many expected.  Now we turn our sights to 
the 2008 implementation of the WHTI land and sea rule, and 
the debate over "acceptable alternative documents" that might 
be used in lieu of a passport.
