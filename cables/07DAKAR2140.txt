SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1. The United Nations Office o\Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in 
conjunction with the GOGB a finalizing a project proposal 
for immediate and sustained assistance to Guinea-Bissau to 
fight narcotics trafficking and reform the justice sector. 
The progr is a responk to President Joao Bernardo fNino" 
Vieira's complaint to the UN Secretary General that UNODC was 
not responding quickly enough to the drug trafficking threat. 
 The final proposal will be distributed to donors in advance 
of a planned December 1) donor's confkrence in Lisbon.  GOGB 
strongly supportsthe project.  Action Request: Post requests 
INL identify funds to increase the U.S. contribution, 
preferably in time to be announced at the donor's conference; 
see paragraph7.  End Summary. 
 
PHASE ONQ9 PRE-ELECTION 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. The three-year UNODC project has two phases; phase one has 
already started with internal financing and the second will 
begin when the new government takes office after thezwall 
2008 lUgislative elections.  Phase one, which is pojected to 
run through June 2008, will have a price tag of approximately 
USD 5.8 million.  Under the objective of fighting drug 
trafficking, targets include poQting a law enforcement 
advisor in Bissau and improvingcapacity of the Judicial 
Police, judges and prosecutors by providing training, 
equipment, and a forensic center.  A third target has already 
been addressed: in late October UNODC appointed{Augusto 
Pinheiro, former Chief of the Cape Verde National Police, as) 
an interim Anti-Narcotics Consultant in Bissau. 
 
¶3. Also addressed in phase one under the objective of 
strengthening the judicial system will be Zhe urgent need for 
a prisun.  Currently, no medium or Kqgh-level secmity prison 
exists in the country.  In addition to refurbishing a 
building to serve as a prison, phase one will establish a 
legal framework for aQministration of justice, and training 
for judges, guarQi and prison administration officials.  A 
detailed projct proposal including both phases will be 
emailed to AF/W and INL/AAE. 
 
THE PROJECT WILL BE WELL-RECEIVED 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. For the firsQ9time this year, Guinea-Bissau was mentioneQ 
in a White House press release as a country of concern for 
the Major's List of drug producing and transshipment 
countries.  The announcement was big news in Guinea-Bissau 
and came as an ominous sign of what may corc if the GOGBxdoes 
not make headway against traffickers.  Prime Minister 
Martinho N'Dafa Cabi is frank when he talks about 
Guinea-Bissau's meager advances against drug traffickers and 
his lack of resources but he continues to fiOht ) winning a 
major victor earlier this month in removing reputed drug 
kingpin Baciro Dabo as Interior Minister.  Cabi continues to 
express his desire for the return of the U.S. Embassy Qn 
Bissau, a statement he reiterated to Poloffs on Octo2]r 24. 
 
¶5. Drugs are no longer exclusively an issue of 7igh-level 
concern; it has gripped the national consciousness. 
Journalists continually push the envelope on reporting about 
drug trafficking and receive regular`death threats as a 
result.  Civil society organizations place banners around the 
city warning about the dangers of drug consumption.  Human 
Rights organizations lament increasing violent crime which 
they say is gelated to drUfs.  Many observers have told 
Poloff they believe the country is becoming less stable and 
evidence is starting to emerge which may support that view. 
On October 23 press reported a "large quantity" of military 
grade weapons discovered by JudicI Police in an abandoned 
house in Bissau.  Armed Force Chief General Batista Tagme Na 
Waie said the find was worrying because they were not the 
property of the Guinea-Bissau army.  Three army trucks were 
used to hAl it all away.
