SUBJECT: ARAMCO CEO:  THE OIL ERA IS NOT OVER 
 
Classified by Consul General John Kincannon for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) At a dinner on May 14 hosted by businessman Badr 
Al-Suwaidan, President and CEO of Al-Bilad, and attended by 
the CG and FCS Off, Abdullah Jumah, CEO of Saudi Aramco, 
commented in response to a query that U.S. energy policy is 
"confusing" and "has no logic."  He claimed that the U.S. was 
sending "mixed signals" about its energy policy, but the only 
specific issues he cited were the negative impact of U.S. 
environmental regulations on new refinery development and the 
proliferation of different grades of gasoline.  He said that 
Aramco wanted to send a clear message to Washington:  "The 
oil era is not over."  He noted that unconventional sources 
of petroleum like tar sands, oil shale, and Orinoco Belt 
heavy oils may have reserves of 3 trillion barrels:  "If 
technology can give us only 10 percent of that, it will equal 
all of the oil pumped in the world since the beginning of 
time." 
 
¶2.  (C) Jumah described Saudi Aramco's move into new refining 
projects as "reluctant" because "the returns on refining are 
only 6 to 10 percent, but it is the right time for us to 
enter this sector."  He mentioned that Saudi Aramco is about 
to sign two large refinery deals with Total and 
Conoco-Phillips.  Turning to China, he described its 
conservation practices as poor even as Chinese demand for 
energy grows.  "If the Chinese ever reach the economic 
development level of Brazil, they will need more energy than 
the U.S."  Finally, he dismissed Matt Simmons's peak oil 
thesis:  "I know Matt.  I think he is a very nice guy.  But 
he's a banker.  He came to Aramco for two weeks and suddenly 
he thinks he's a geologist.  The book is just rubbish.  I've 
met him, but I've never discussed the book with him." 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment:  It is highly unusual that Jumah would 
attend this sort of dinner, which Al-Suwaidan hosted as part 
of ongoing discussions between Al-Bilad and the U.S. firm 
Global SantaFE about a potential deal to supply four offshore 
rigs to Saudi Aramco.  Eastern Province (EP) Governor Prince 
Mohammed bin Fahd (MbF) is the owner of Al-Bilad, and Jumah's 
attendance probably represents his deference to MbF's 
presumed personal and financial interest in this potential 
business deal.  End comment. 
 
¶4.  (C) Bio note:  Badr al-Suweidan was born in 1958 and took 
over Al-Bilad in late 1990s.  Prior to that, he was a career 
Saudi MFA employee who served in the Eastern Province during 
the early to mid-1980s as a protocol officer.  In 1985, he 
used his connections to get posted as Saudi Consul in Bonn. 
In 1989, he was involved in a serious auto accident that 
almost crippled him and required extensive hospitalization. 
End bio note.
