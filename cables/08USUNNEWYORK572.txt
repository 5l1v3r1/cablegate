SUBJECT: SPECIAL AFGHANISTAN ALLOWANCE APPROVED 
 
¶1.  THE UN ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUDGETARY 
MATTERS (ACABQ) TODAY APPROVED THE SECRETARY-GENERAL'S (SYG) 
REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FOR INTERNATIONAL STAFF 
SERVING IN THE UN ASSISTANCE MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN (UNAMA). 
THIS WAS THE SYG'S SECOND REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL UNAMA 
ALLOWANCE, THE FIRST HAVING BEEN DENIED IN DECEMBER, 2007. 
THE SPECIAL ALLOWANCE REQUEST WAS MADE TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT 
ONGOING PROBLEMS WITH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF QUALIFIED 
INTERNATIONAL STAFF IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
¶2.  THE SPECIAL ALLOWANCE WAS APPROVED FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 
2008 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2009, 
 
¶3.  COMMENT:  THE ACABQ REACHED CONSENSUS APPROVAL OF THE 
SYG'S REQUEST AFTER EFFORTS TO DEMARCHE MEMBER STATES WITH 
EXPERTS ON THE COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT OF THE SPECIAL UNAMA 
ALLOWANCE.  THE COMMITTEE ALSO EXPRESSED AN EXPECTATION THAT 
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WILL TAKE ACTION ON HARMONIZING 
CONDITIONS OF SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE UN SECRETARIAT.  GETTING 
THE UNAMA SPECIAL ALLOWANCE THROUGH THE ACABQ PROVED MORE 
DIFFICULT THAN WE ANTICIPATED AND THE COMMITTEE CHAIR SUSAN 
MCLURG WAS UNSURE TO WHAT EXTENT THE DEMARCHE EFFORT MAY HAVE 
INFLUENCED THE COMMITTEE'S ACTION.  END COMMENT.
