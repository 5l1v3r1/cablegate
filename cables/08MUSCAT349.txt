(SBU) Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusef bin 
Alawi is accompanying Sultan Qaboos to official meetings 
abroad in May (ref B) or will be otherwise occupied in Muscat 
for the month.  It is therefore very unlikely that he will 
attend the International Compact with Iraq (ICI) Ministerial 
in Stockholm on May 29 (ref A).  Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Secretary General Sayyid Badr al-Busaidi, who has ministerial 
rank and often attends events in bin Alawi's stead, will also 
be unavailable for the meeting in Sweden as he will 
participate in the senior-level Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI) event in Washington, D.C. on May 28 before 
traveling onward to another commitment.  Post will provide 
further information via septel on who may represent the 
government of Oman at the ICI Ministerial.
