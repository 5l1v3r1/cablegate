¶1. (SBU) DCM delivered reftel points regarding the Cuba embargo 
resolution October 26 to MFA Second Territorial Department Director 
(A/S equivalent) Ihor Hrushko.  Hrushko noted that Cuba continues to 
provide substantial assistance for the "Chornobyl children" 
(belonging to families affected by the 1986 Chornobyl nuclear 
disaster) and that Ukraine's position is to oppose the U.S. trade 
embargo on Cuba.  Notwithstanding, MFA had decided October 25 that 
Ukraine would support the EU statement on the annual UNGA resolution 
introduced by Cuba condemning the U.S. economic embargo against 
Cuba.  The statement, he noted, had two aspects: while it condemned 
the U.S. trade embargo, it was also quite critical of the Cuban 
regime's human rights violations.
