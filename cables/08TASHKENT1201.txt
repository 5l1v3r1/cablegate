 \
UNDP and Uzbek Customs Launch New Web Site \
------------------------------------------ \
¶1. (C) The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and \
Uzbekistan's State Customs Committee have launched a new \
website (www.customsreform.uz), which will include updates on \
the latest changes in Customs regulation and discussions of \
the new Customs Code.  An English-language version is in the \
works. \
 \
Non-Stop Service to Switzerland \
------------------------------- \
 \
¶2. (C) Uzbekistan Airlines last week announced the expansion \
of its route network to include a new non-stop flight linking \
Tashkent and Geneva.  At first glance this seems like an \
unusual choice since the airline already serves several major \
European hubs and Geneva is not a particularly large city; \
Zurich is also a more of a gateway airport.  We can't even \
convince the Government of Uzbekistan to extend prison visit \
agreements with the Geneva-based International Committee of \
the Red Cross.  The main reason may be that the new Uzbek \
Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva happens to be \
President Karimov's daughter, Gulnora Karimova, who would \
otherwise be subjected to time-consuming layovers in Paris, \
Frankfurt, or Milan on her commutes.  The direct flight may \
also prove popular with Uzbek "biznessmen" seeking to do \
anonymous banking. \
 \
Russian Ambassador Moving On \
---------------------------- \
¶3. (U) The Russian MFA reported on its website that the \
Russian Ambassador to Tashkent, Farit Muhametshin, has been \
appointed the head of the Federal Agency for Commonwealth of \
Independent States (CIS) Affairs, Citizens Living Abroad, and \
International Humanitarian Cooperation.  The Charge \
d'Affaires will be Vazyh Ibragimovich Serazaev until a new \
envoy is named.  In an October 18 article the Uzbek website \
uzmetronom.com credited Muhametshin, an ethnic Tatar, with \
the "restoration of friendly and allied relations between the \
states." \
 \
Russia's Economy and Uzbek Migrants \
----------------------------------- \
¶4. (C) The effect of the world economic crisis on Uzbekistan \
was the topic of discussion at a meeting of embassy and IFI \
economists hosted last week by the Tashkent office of the \
EBRD.  A significant portion of the discussion was devoted to \
the effect a downturn in the Russian economy would have on \
the up to 5 million Uzbek migrant laborers in Russia.  A \
representative of the Russian trade mission assured us that \
the Russian migration service would be ruthless and efficient \
in deporting undocumented laborers, but his assertion was met \
with raised eyebrows.  Other participants posited the more \
believable notion that highly qualified Uzbeks working in \
Russia will always find work and will remain through any \
recession, whereas unskilled laborers employed mainly in the \
construction industry may flood back to their family bases in \
Uzbekistan.  Given that officially acknowledged remittances \
amounted to USD 1.6 billion in 2007 (nearly 9% of the Uzbek \
GDP), a mass return of unskilled laborers could be the most \
significant manifestation of the world economic crisis in \
Uzbekistan. \
 \
Iranian Ambassador Takes Four Months to Present Credentials \
--------------------------------------------- ------------- \
¶5. (C) Iran's new ambassador to Uzbekistan Muhammad \
Keshovarzoda was in Tashkent for four months before \
presenting his credentials to President Karimov on October \
¶15.  That Karimov was clearly in no hurry to receive \
Keshovarzoda can be seen as a reflection of GOU attitudes \
about Iran generally and suspicions about Tehran's motives in \
the region. \
