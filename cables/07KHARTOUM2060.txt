SUBJECT: REPORTS OF SPLA CLASHES WITH MISSERIYA ARABS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Sudanese news media reported December 24 that 
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) forces clashed with nomadic 
Misseriya Arab tribesmen on December 22 and December 23 along the 
Kordofan-Bahr al Ghazal border.  Newspapers quoted Misseriya sources 
claiming 30 SPLA soldiers and nine Misseriya tribesmen killed, while 
SPLA sources reportedly claimed 20 SPLA soldiers and 30 Misseriya 
tribesmen killed. An SPLA spokesmen in Juba told emboffs December 27 
that the reports were exaggerated and claimed that while a Misseriya 
cattle herder was involved, there was no clash between SPLA and 
Misseriya tribesmen. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The clash, first reported by a local daily Al-Sahafa 
December 24, reportedly started when SPLA soldiers arrested a Dinka 
cattle herder working for Arab Misseriya tribesmen on December 22, 
accusing him of carrying weapons.  This reportedly resulted in an 
altercation which left four Arab tribesmen dead.  The following day, 
Misseriya tribesmen reportedly attacked an SPLA camp in Grenti in 
northern Bahr Al-Ghazal with the assistance of Sudanese Armed Forces 
(SAF) and Popular Defense Forces (PDF).  The SAF has denied they or 
the Popular Defense Forces (PDF) took part in any attack. 
 
¶3. (SBU) An international NGO in Abyei told poloff on December 27 
that a UN security briefing in Abyei confirmed the reports of 
clashes between SPLA forces and SAF supported tribesmen. The UN 
reported that a joint military team composed of SAF and SPLA forces 
will travel to the area tomorrow which the UN identified as being 
230 kilometers north of Abyei. According to the UN, fighting 
continues. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Separately, SPLA contacts told emboffs December 27 that 100 
Misseriya tribesmen attacked a platoon-sized element of the SPLA on 
December 22 in an area near Grenti, killing 22 SPLA soldiers. During 
an SPLA counterattack, the Misseriya suffered an unknown number of 
casualties. According to the SPLA, there was no further fighting 
after December 24 and the situation is stable. The SPLA contact 
opined that the SAF encouraged the Misseriya to attack the SPLA to 
destabilize the area around the 1/1/56 border.  The contact said 
that a committee, which includes SPLA Major General Paul Malong, is 
heading to the Aweil area on December 28 to prevent further conflict 
between the two forces. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Due to the scarcity of reliable observers in the 
area, there are a number of discrepancies in these reports. 
However, multiple reports to date indicate that a high-level joint 
SPLM-SAF team will travel to Grenti to assess the actual situation 
and attempt to prevent further conflict.  Given the impending 
redeployment of both SAF and SPLA forces to their respective sides 
of the 1/1/56 border, this incident may offer either side a pretext 
to delay or halt further troop movements, at least in this 
particular area close to the oil fields.  Observers note that there 
have historically been seasonal skirmishes between Arab Misseriya 
herders and SPLA (predominantly Dinka) soldiers in this region, as 
the herds move south in search of better grazing.
