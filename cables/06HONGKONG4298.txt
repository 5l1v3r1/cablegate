SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: 
SENGITAL LTD. 
 
REF: A) USDOC 04720 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) and FCS Vice Consul Tyler 
Warren conducted a post shipment verification (PSV) at 
Sengital Ltd. (Sengital), Unit 207, Building 5, No. 6 
Science Park West Avenue, Hong Kong.  The items in 
question are hybrid integrated circuits exported to 
Sengital on June 6, 2006 and valued at USD 16,500.  The 
ECCN listed on the SED is 7A994 and these items are 
controlled for anti-terrorism reasons. The exporter is 
Kionix Inc. of Ithaca New York. 
 
¶3.  The ECO and Vice Consul Warren visited Sengital on 
October 27, 2006 and met with Mr. Alan Lam, Chief 
Technical Officer of Sengital. Mr. Lam provided 
background on Sengital and its business, which includes 
design and production of controllers for video games 
(more background can be found at www.Sengital.com). 
 
¶4.  Mr. Lam stated that the integrated circuits had 
been used in the production of hand held video game 
controllers sold under the brand name E-Dimensional 
(www.edimensional.com).  These were produced at 
Sengital's contract manufacturing facility in Shenzhen. 
 The integrated circuits supplied by Kionix include 
motion sensing features which allows their use, in this 
instance, in video game controllers that translate user 
motion into computer action. 
 
¶5. At the time visited, Sengital appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the commodities shipped since 
Sengital cooperated with the PSV and provided all 
requested information concerning the use and final 
disposition of the items.  At the same time, the ECO 
and Vice Consul Warren were not able to inspect the 
subject items as they had already been incorporated 
into video game controllers.  Consistent with guidance 
on reporting of PSVs where the items cannot be 
physically inspected, the ECO and Vice Consul Warren 
recommend that this PSV be classified as Limited.
