REF:  STATE 66363 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 23, Acting DCM shared the USG's health-related 
priorities for the 2008 G-8 Summit with MFA North America Department 
Director Igor Neverov.  Post also shared the USG health priorities 
with Deputy Minister of Finance Dmitriy Pankin (Russia's G-8 
Sous-Sherpa), and with GOR officials at the International 
Departments of the Ministry of Health and Social Development (MOHSD) 
and the Federal Surveillance Service for Consumer Rights Protection 
and Human Well-Being (Rospotrebnadzor). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Yevgeniy Slastnykh, Head of the Office of Bilateral 
Cooperation in the MOHSD International Department, expressed 
interest in the USG initiative to train health care workers.  He 
noted that Russia currently hosted about 6,000 foreign medical 
students, many of whom were studying on GOR-funded stipends and 
fellowships under bilateral agreements with various countries 
administered by the Ministry of Education and Science.  He believed 
Russia could consider hosting more medical students and increasing 
the number of GOR-funded stipends and fellowships.  Alexander 
Kucherenko, head of the Rostpotrebnadzor International Department, 
noted that his agency would likely be interested in supporting the 
USG initiative on neglected tropical diseases.  We will continue to 
follow up with GOR officials regarding their reaction to the USG's 
G-8 health priorities.
