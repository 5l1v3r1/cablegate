SUBJECT: IPR Roundtables on Apparel and Sporting Goods: Legal 
Restraints and Enforcement Strategies 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: China's IPR regulations are vague and its 
enforcement agencies are weak, according to apparel and 
sporting-goods companies as well as U.S. and Chinese lawyers.  The 
IPR enforcement efforts of most companies are primarily focused on 
shutting down domestic IPR violators and preventing the export of 
counterfeits.  Companies encouraged the U.S. Government to target 
trade fairs and publicize "hot spots" to domestic audiences.  A Nike 
representative said Guangzhou wholesale markets and trade fairs 
continue to be full of fake shoes.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Legal Restraints 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) At a recent seminar led by Tim Browning, Attorney Advisor 
with the Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. lawyer and Amcham-South 
China IPR Committee head David Buxbaum said that while China's 
national IP laws are generally good, the regulations are often vague 
and should be strengthened.  Jason Yao, Asia-Pacific Counsel for 
golf manufacturer Acushnet, said China took a step backward by 
eliminating a provision requiring violators with multiple IPR 
offences to face criminal penalties.  Yao said that it is too 
difficult to use landlord liability laws to remove infringing 
markets.  He added that China's new IPR complaint centers are "a 
joke," as the telephone operators are unable to provide any 
assistance other than to refer the case to the relevant authorities. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Several of the participants said that documentary 
requirements for IPR cases continue to be overly burdensome, 
including notarization, legalization, and approval from a U.S.-based 
Chinese Consulate.  A U.S. lawyer said he encourages all U.S. 
companies to register their patents in China, regardless of whether 
they plan to manufacture there.  Other lawyers noted that because IP 
classifications differ among countries, companies need to be careful 
when registering abroad.  A Chinese lawyer added that foreign 
companies should always have an IPR agreement with OEM 
manufacturers. 
 
Central-Local Divide 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Participants differed on whether central or local 
authorities are more to blame for China's lack of progress in IPR 
enforcement.  David Hon, owner of a folding bicycle manufacturer, 
said central authorities are unwilling to pressure local officials 
to implement the law.  Others said central authorities simply lack 
the ability to control local offices and ensure adequate 
enforcement.  Buxbaum pinned much of the blame on the inherent 
weakness of the IPR enforcement agencies, including AIC, IPO, the 
courts, and the PSB.  He said these agencies need to professionalize 
and institute "pay as you go" systems in investigations to generate 
sufficient resources. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Buxbaum noted that improved IPR enforcement is in China's 
self-interest, since the vast majority of cases involve Chinese 
companies.  Browning said he had calculated that only 2.4 percent of 
China's civil IPR cases have involved foreign litigants (those from 
Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are counted as domestic). 
 
Enforcement Strategies 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Several company representatives said they will continue to 
target most of their enforcement efforts in shutting down domestic 
violators.  Acushnet places more emphasis on exports than domestic 
sales and has pursued vendors in the United States with mixed 
success.  Sharla Settlemier, General Manager of Production in Nike's 
Guangzhou office, said Nike actively tries to identify U.S.-based 
distributors of counterfeit goods. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Hon said trade shows remain his primary concern because 
they are a crucial marketing venue for counterfeiters.  He 
encouraged the U.S. Government to press China to improve trade fair 
IPR enforcement.  Acushnet's Yao said industry and government should 
publicize to Chinese audiences the names of cities with high rates 
of counterfeiting (similar to what is done in the USTR's Special 301 
Report).

Fake Shoes Everywhere 
--------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Nike's Settlemier said wholesale counterfeit markets in 
Guangzhou continue to sell large volumes of fake shoes.  Many of the 
vendors are not even interested in discussing single item purchases. 
 She recently visited a fair in Guangzhou where a local equipment 
manufacturer was displaying shoe manufacturing equipment identical 
(including the color of paint) to the equipment being sold by a 
well-known Italian shoe company also at the fair.
