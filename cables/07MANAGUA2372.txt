¶1. Summary. Preliminary reports by Nicaraguan authorities indicate that 20,266 people have been affected by floods, mostly in the northwest of the country, but scattered over other regions as well, with 8 known deaths and two missing persons. There are no known U.S. citizen casualties. The floods have most seriously affected agricultural crops, including beans and corn, and caused significant damage to road infrastructures. USAID is working with its partners to assess the disbursement of the USD 50,000 emergency relief authorized by OFDA upon the Ambassador's declaration of a disaster. Initial assessments indicate that the greatest needs are for food, seeds and tools, and road infrastructure. The GON is promising an updated report of damages on October 23.

¶2.  The GON's Center for Disaster Operations released a 
preliminary report on October 21 showing that there are 
20,266 people affected from the flooding (4,008) families. 
There were 8 known dead, and two missing persons.  The 
Nicaraguan authorities report that 6,470 persons were 
evacuated from danger areas and moved to 76 temporary 
shelters.  The areas worst hit are in the northwest of the 
country, in the departments of Chinandega and Leon;  however, 
there was also serious damage in Esteli, Jinotega and 
Matagalpa, and the victims of the flooding are scattered 
throughout the country in over 170 communities in 9 different 
Departments.  The Nicaraguan Center for Disaster Operations 
has promised an updated assessment on/or about October 23.

¶3.  Coming on the heels of Hurricane Felix, the cumulative 
effect of this round of flooding, especially on roads and 
crops, is significant.  The Nicaraguan Ministry of 
Agriculture and Forestry released calculations last week that 
predict a crop loss of 19,526 hectares in the west and north 
of the country as a result of the rains and flooding.  This 
calculated total is broken down between the local staples, 
with 14 percent loss of the bean crop (14,376 hectares) and 
3.9 percent loss of the corn crop (5150 hectares).  USAID 
partners are conducting surveys and report that there are 
short term immediate food needs in several flood-affected 
communities. 
 
¶4.  Initial reports indicate that the damage to the frail 
road infrastructure has been considerable as well.  While the 
Pan American Highway is currently open, traffic is restricted 
and slow on several sections due to surface deterioration and 
subsidence.  Most major arteries are passable, but the side 
roads to small villages are in some cases nearly impassable. 
There have been small scale mud- and land-slides that have 
blocked traffic on some roads; however, with the saturated 
ground, there exists a possibility for future large scale 
mud- or land-slides, which could be catastrophic.

¶5.  The Embassy's flood disaster working group met on October 
22 to review the state of the flood-related damage and assess 
Mission response.  USAID is accepting proposals from its 
partners for the distribution of the USD 50,000 authorized 
for immediate disbursement in response to the COM disaster 
declaration message.  Local partners are examining other 
options, including reallocation of existing in-country stocks 
of emergency relief supplies to meet the immediate need of 
flood victims.  USAID OFDA representative visited the 
affected region on October 21 and reported that the major 
needs include food, seeds and tools, and road infrastructure. 
 As these assessments proceed, it may be necessary to 
identify additional funds to meet the medium term recovery 
needs for the affected regions.

¶6.  The Embassy has released a warden notice in response to 
the flooding.  The American Citizen Services section of the 
Embassy dispatched a locally engaged employee to make contact 
in person with the wardens in Chinandega and Esteli.  There 
are no known American casualties, and there have been no 
requests to the Embassy from U.S. citizens for assistance 
related to the floods.  There are 605 U.S. citizens 
registered with the Embassy as resident in the four most 
affected departments:  194 in Chinandega, 235 in Leon, 150 in 
Esteli, and 26 in Jinotega.

¶7.  The Embassy released a press release on October 22 
announcing that the U.S. is donating USD 50,000 in relief 
funds as an initial response to the flood disaster.  The 
press release highlights that the OFDA assistance aims to 
assist those who have suffered losses of property, crops, and 
infrastructure.  Also noted is the fact that the U.S. 
Government has donated more than USD 3.2 million over the 
past two months for hurricane Felix recovery and provided USD 
7 million through OPIC for home reconstruction loans on the 
Atlantic Coast.
