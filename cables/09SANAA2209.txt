SUBJECT: YEMEN: 2010 NTE CHAPTER ON THE ARAB LEAGUE TRADE 
BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 118737 
 
On November 24, EconOff met with Mojeeb Mohammed Othman, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) official in charge of Arab 
League affairs in the MFA's Arab Countries Department, and 
gathered the following information on the latest 
boycott-related developments in Yemen in response to REFTEL 
request: 
 
- The ROYG continues to enforce the primary aspect of the 
Arab League Boycott (ALB), namely prohibiting the importation 
of Israeli-origin goods and services into Yemen.  The ROYG 
does not enforce the secondary and tertiary aspects of the 
boycott and does not require participation in or with any 
other international boycotts. 
 
- The ROYG's boycott practices have a minimal impact on the 
imports and sales of U.S. goods and services, as the 
practices are not very well enforced. 
 
- The ROYG does not maintain an ALB office in Yemen.  The 
ROYG participates in the annual meeting of the Central 
Boycott Office (CBO) in Damascus. 
 
- The ROYG is implementing a 1995 governmental decision to 
renounce observance of the secondary and tertiary aspects of 
the boycott. 
 
- The ROYG has not made any concrete efforts to stop 
enforcing the primary aspect of the ALB, and still actively 
supports it. 
 
- Yemen does not trade with Israel, and thus does not have 
offices set up to facilitate such trade.
