Policy for National Socialization 
 
JAKARTA 
 
¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  the Indonesian National Police (INP) has 
approved their Use of Force Policy (UOF) and Use of Force Continuum 
Policy for nationwide socialization. The new policy is inclusive a 
UOF Report that requires police supervisors to report use of force 
incidents to track data where police officers responded to a threat 
using non-lethal or lethal force. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) POLICIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY: A central focus of Chief 
General Sutanto's vision was to increase organizational 
transparency, accountability, and responsiveness of the INP to the 
Indonesian public. Human rights violations by police were recognized 
as a major issue that had to be immediately addressed.  In 2005 the 
Indonesian National Police (INP) and DOJ/ICITAP worked 
collaboratively to develop a national Use of Force Policy (UOF) for 
the police that was signed into decree in September 2005.  The 
second collaboration involved the development of an accompanying Use 
of Force Continuum that articulates the appropriate use of 
non-lethal and lethal responses to physical threats presented police 
under the color of their authority in the performance of their 
official duties. The purpose of the development of the parallel 
policies is to establish consistent, actionable, published, and 
enforceable regulations, procedures, and training for INP personnel 
to reduce human rights violations commensurate with internationally 
accepted standards and practices. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A MAJOR STEP FORWARD -THE INP USE OF FORCE REPORT 
 
The INP and DOJ/ICITAP worked for months through a 
cross-representational working group on the acceptance, development 
and implementation of a standardized Use of Force Report and policy. 
 The policy requires that in incidents where an officer has to use 
force beyond passive resistance, a report is generated on the nature 
of the threat presented and the officer's response to the threat. 
The report is evaluated for violations of law and the INP Code of 
Ethics and Disciplinary Code. If required an internal investigation 
into the officers conduct is initiated.  In all cases the UOF Report 
data will be collated in a central repository. 
 
¶5. (SBU) NATIONAL UOF POLICY SOCIALIZATION: The INP and DOJ ICITAP 
developed a scenario-based VDC, student manual, student tests, and 
instructor workbook to socialize the parallel policies to be 
delivered by an instructor cadre to train police throughout 
Indonesia. The national socialization is expected to take 
approximately six (6) months. 
 
¶6. (SBU) A NEW LEVEL OF TRANSFORMATION: The development and 
implementation of a UOF Policy and UOF Report is foundational to 
building a responsive, accountable, and transparent law enforcement 
organization.  Human rights violations will not be significantly 
impacted without the institutionalization of these polices, 
regulations and training that govern the behavior and response of 
police officers facing threatening situations and reacting 
appropriately.  General Sutanto's INP has reached a new level of 
democratization with few peers in Asia.
