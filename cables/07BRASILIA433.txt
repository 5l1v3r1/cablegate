Secretary Rice and Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim signed a 
 
SIPDIS 
Memorandum of Understanding on March 9, 2007, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, 
to advance cooperation on biofuels. 
 
Text follows: 
 
"Memorandum of Understanding Between the United States and Brazil to 
Advance Cooperation on Biofuels 
 
The Government of the United States of America and the Government of 
the Federative Republic of Brazil (henceforth referred to as the 
"Participants"), 
 
Recognizing the common interests shared by the Participants toward 
the development of affordable, clean, and sustainable energy 
sources; 
 
Considering the strategic importance of biofuels to be a 
transformative force in the region to diversify energy supplies, 
bolster economic growth, advance social agendas, and improve the 
environment. 
 
Aware of the benefits of forging a U.S.-Brazil partnership to 
leverage our collective public and private sector resources toward 
the advancement of biofuels and related technologies; 
 
Taking into account the existing mechanisms and ongoing cooperation 
in the fields of energy, agriculture, environment, and science and 
technology regarding biofuels; 
 
Bearing in mind that this Memorandum is intended to provide a 
general framework and express the cooperative intent of the 
Governments; 
 
Noting that issues relating to domestic trade or tariffs should be 
raised in other multilateral, regional or bilateral fora. 
 
Hereby express their intention to cooperate on the development and 
deployment of biofuels through a three-pronged approach (bilateral, 
third countries, and global): 
 
Â¶I. Bilateral: The Participants intend to advance the research and 
development of next generation biofuels technology leveraging - 
wherever possible - work being done in the framework of the 
Brazil-U.S. Commercial Dialogue (2006), the Consultative Committee 
on Agriculture (2003), the Consultative Group on Energy (2003), the 
U.S./Brazil Common Agenda for the Environment (1995), and the Joint 
Commission on Cooperation in Science and Technology (1984) - amended 
and extended by the Protocol signed on March 21, 1994. 
 
II. Third Countries: The Participants intend to work jointly to 
bring the benefits of biofuels to select third countries through 
feasibility studies and technical assistance aimed at stimulating 
private sector investment in biofuels. The Participants intend to 
begin work in Central America and the Caribbean to encourage local 
production and consumption of biofuels, with a view to continue 
joint work in key regions across the globe. 
 
III. Global: The Participants desire to expand the biofuels 
marketplace through cooperation on the establishment of uniform 
standards and codes. To achieve this goal, the Participants intend 
to cooperate through the International Biofuels Forum (IBF), 
leveraging existing work being carried out between the U.S. National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National 
Institute of Metrology, Standards and Industrial Quality of Brazil 
(INMETRO) and coordinating with existing and complementary 
international fora; 
 
The Participants intend to establish a Steering Group to oversee the 
work being carried out under this MOU so that proper coordination is 
maintained across each of the three areas of cooperation. 
 
The Government of the United States appoints the Under Secretary of 
Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs, U.S. Department of 
State, as its primary representative for implementation of this MOU; 
 
 
The Government of Brazil appoints the Under Secretary General for 
Political Affairs, Ministry of External Relations as its primary 
representative for implementation of this MOU;

information regarding actions taken by the Government that 
designated him or her. 
 
This Memorandum is to take effect on the date of signature. 
 
Signed at Sao Paulo, in the English and Portuguese languages, on the 
9th day of March, 2007."
