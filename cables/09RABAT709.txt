SUBJECT: USG COMMENTS ON MOROCCO'S PROPOSED UNGA GICNT 
RESOLUTION DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 83499 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 14, 2009, Acting Polcouns and Acting 
D/Polcouns delivered ref record copy with USG comments on 
Morocco's draft resolution in support of the Global 
Initiative for Combating Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) to 
Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Head of United 
Nations Division Redoune Houssaini.  Mr. Houssaini said that 
his office will review the U.S. and Russian amendments to the 
resolution.  If the language is acceptable, MFA will open a 
dialogue with the USG and GOR on a mutually acceptable target 
date for introducing the resolution at the United Nations 
General Assembly (UNGA) this fall, most likely during the 
general debate. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Houssaini said the MFA would consult with USG and 
GOR to devise a strategy for expanding consultation on the 
draft resolution to include other countries before its 
introduction to the General Assembly in order to maximize its 
chances of being adopted.  Houssaini considered consultations 
with the U.K., France, China, and India to be at the top of 
the list, but solicited U.S. input in this regard.  If the 
amended language of the draft resolution is not acceptable to 
the GOM, MFA will amend and return the resolution for USG and 
Government of Russia (GOR) review. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  At a follow-up meeting on August 18 with Acting 
Polcouns, Houssaini mentioned that the make-up of the 
Moroccan delegation to the UNGA this fall will include at 
least Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri as delegation head, 
MFA Director General for Multilateral Affairs (and Chief of 
Staff) Ambassador Nasser Bourita, and MFA Head of 
International Organizations Directorate Azzedine Farhane. 
The Moroccan delegation is tentatively scheduled to arrive in 
New York on September 22.
