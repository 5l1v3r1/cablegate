SUBJECT: BRAZIL:  POLICE SEIZE URANIUM ORE 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Brazilian Federal Police announced on Aug 24 the 
seizure last month of 1,320 pounds of uranium and thorium 
ore, the first time, according to press reports, that such a 
seizure has occurred in Brazil.  (Note:  In 2003 GOB 
officials told Poloff that they were unaware of any illicit 
trafficking of nuclear materials within Brazil. End note) 
The uranium and thorium ore, in granulated form, was taken 
from a van that was stopped for routine inspection about 120 
km. from Macapa, Amapa State.  The alleged owner of the ore 
was captured and charged with wrongful possession of illegal 
materials, punishable by up to six years in prison.  Police 
revealed that the shipment was bound for Sao Paulo for likely 
transshipment out of the country.  Value of the shipment was 
placed at USD 466,000.  Since the material seized by police 
was raw natural ore, the U-235 isotope content was no more 
than 0.7 percent. 
 
¶2.  (U) Experts from Brazil's National Nuclear Energy 
Commission and the National Department of Mineral Production 
told the press that while this was the first seizure of this 
type in Brazil, they suspected it was not the first time raw 
uranium ore had been smuggled from the remote mining site in 
Amapa State.  Officials described the amount of the seizure 
as "very large" and the operation as "not amateurish."
