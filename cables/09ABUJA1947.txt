--------------------------------------- 
UPCOMING AU AND ECOWAS MEETINGS IN ABUJA 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) will convene a "consultative meeting of major 
Nigerien actors" in Abuja October 30 under the chairmanship 
of ECOWAS Mediator for Niger General Abdulsalami Abubakar. 
An ECOWAS representative informed PolMilOff October 22 that 
ECOWAS would invite members of Tandja's government, Niger 
opposition parties, and key Niger stakeholders to the meeting 
but did not yet release an agenda or a list of planned 
participants.  This meeting will fall on the heels of the 
October 29 African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council 
(PSC) meeting, which will focus on Darfur and likely also 
address Guinea and Niger. 
 
------------------- 
SUSPENSION OF NIGER 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) ECOWAS suspended Niger membership October 22, under 
its Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance, after Niger 
ignored an October 17 request by Heads of State to postpone 
its October 20 legislative elections.  In a statement, ECOWAS 
President Dr. Mohamed Ibn Chambas condemned Niger's "serious 
breaches of the ECOWAS Protocol," noting that "the 
authorities of Niger have clearly moved to further entrench 
the constitutional illegality currently prevailing in the 
country."
