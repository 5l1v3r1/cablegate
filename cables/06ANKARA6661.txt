SUBJECT: SECI ANTI-OC TRAINING SHOULD BE IN TURKEY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Embassy Ankara recommends the U.S. take advantage 
of the existing advantages of Ankara-based TADOC for anti-organized 
crime training under the SECI umbrella as described reftel.  Not 
only is TADOC a well-functioning international training academy but 
by using TADOC the USG will help reinforce Turkish engagement with 
SECI as well as U.S.-Turkish law enforcement cooperation, a key 
pillar in the bilateral relationship. End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
An Established, Well-Regarded Academy 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy Ankara sees little downside and much upside to 
pursuing the use of the Ankara-based TADOC (Turkish International 
Academy Against Drugs and Organized Crime) as the locus of anti-OC 
task force training under SECI auspices.  TADOC is a 
state-of-the-art training facility that already offers 
anti-organized crime training to countries in the Balkans, Central 
Asia and Caucasus regions, much of it with UNODC funding.  UNODC 
helped create TADOC and continues to support it financially.  Some 
EU member countries (UK, Germany, Netherlands) have funded and 
organized training programs held at TADOC, as has the U.S.   We 
question the use of USG funds at an untested facility when a 
well-functioning alternative already exists: as post understands it, 
the Sofia-based alternative is not yet a fully-functioning academy. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Turkey Receptive but Unlikely to Add Funds 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Our informal, preliminary inquiries with TADOC and MFA 
officials suggest Turkey in general and TADOC in particular would be 
very receptive to playing an enhanced role in organized crime 
training under a SECI umbrella provided the details could be worked 
out.  Turkey's is a middle income economy under fiscal austerity and 
an IMF program and it has large and pressing development needs.  As 
such, it is unlikely to provide substantial additional funding 
beyond what it already contributes to TADOC. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Turkish MFA officials tell us this year Turkey will 
contribute $1.2 million to UNODC, well beyond the $500,000 required 
to sustain Turkey's major donor status.  MFA officials told us that 
UNODC rules allow Turkey to use a portion of their contribution to 
fund TADOC when the academy has needs, thereby helping to ensure 
that TADOC has a reliable backstop funding source.  Turkey has 
allocated $200,000 to TADOC this year.  The MFA officials also said 
that Turkey is the second largest funder of SECI after the U.S., 
whereas other SECI countries contribute very little.  Though Turkey 
is highly unlikely to fund travel and per diem costs for trainees 
from other countries, one advantage of using TADOC is the relatively 
low cost of lodging: currently $65 dollars per night. 
 
----------------------------- 
Embassy Engagement with TADOC 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Multiple sections and agencies at Embassy Ankara are 
engaged with TADOC.  DEA, FBI, Justice and State/INL have all used 
its facilities for training programs.  TADOC's director, Celal 
Bodur, is a highly-respected and cooperative post contact.  Going 
forward, if the U.S. decides to fund SECI anti-organized crime 
training at TADOC, Embassy Ankara will be as helpful as possible. 
Post reminds the Department that State Department staff  available 
to work on these issues have been cut with the elimination in fiscal 
year 2007 of the junior officer position that has handled narcotics 
and anti-crime issues. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post sees substantial diplomatic and law enforcement 
advantages to using TADOC for the SECI training. First, by directing 
SECI training to a Turkish academy, we would help reinforce Turkey's 
commitment to SECI.  As the largest country in SECI and the transit 
country for most Afghan-sourced opiates it is hard to overstate the 
importance of  Turkish engagement to Southeastern European law

enforcement cooperation in general and SECI in particular.  (For the 
same reason, Turkey is a crucial partner for DEA.)  The timing is 
good with regard to Turkey's relationship with SECI:  Turkish 
officials seem to have gotten over their dismay at the failure of 
their candidate to win the SECI executive directorship in 2005 and 
we understand that the Turkish police are considering stationing a 
representative at SECI in Bucharest. MFA officials tell us Turkey's 
main reservation about SECI is that it does too little: they would 
be happy to see a stronger, more operational SECI. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Second, the relationship between U.S. and Turkish law 
enforcement has been a pillar of the broader bilateral relationship: 
law enforcement cooperation has been steady throughout the recent 
ups and downs in the broader relationship.  The Turkish law 
enforcement community is one constituency within the Turkish state 
that sees the importance of maintaining strong U.S.-Turkish 
relations.
