SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-LICENSE/PRE-SHIPMENT 
END-USE CHECK ON LICENSES 050170678 AND 050170688 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on license 050170678 and 
050170688 for the export of ammunition to South Africa.  Post 
is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 
days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect 
pending and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: These are the first two PM/DDTC export 
licenses to which end-user African Outdoor Sports is  party. 
The import authorization documentation submitted in support 
of these licenses is not/not specific to the transactions. 
The document submitted for 050170678 appears to be a letter 
from the South African Police Service explaining in general 
terms the regulations of unprimed cartridge cases.  The 
document submitted for 050170688 appears to be an 
authorization for African Outdoor Sports to import firearms 
and ammunition in general.  Therefore, it is unclear if the 
proper import authorization for these specific transactions 
was granted.  This request is to establish the bona fides of 
the company and these transactions and to establish the 
annual sales for African Outdoor Sports. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of end-user African Outdoor Sports and these 
transactions by making inquiries to representatives of the 
company and appropriate authorities of the Government of 
South Africa.  Post is also requested to establish the 
company's annual sales and determine if the large quantity of 
ammunition on these licenses is warranted.  The following 
points are included for guidance: 
 
(To the African Outdoor Sports) 
 
--When was your company established and who are its 
principals?  What products and services does your company 
provide? 
 
--How long have you been in the business of importing and 
selling defense articles?  Who are your regular customers and 
where do they reside? 
 
--What specific ammunition components will you import on 
these licenses?  What calibers will the finished ammunition 
be?  For what is ammunition of this caliber generally used 
for in South Africa? 
 
--Why did you issue two separate purchase orders on these 
transactions as opposed to placing one order with the U.S. 
vendor? 
 
--What are your annual sales of firearms and ammunition? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To GOSA Export/Import Authorities) 
 
--Is African Outdoor Sports properly authorized to import and 
sell defense articles in South Africa?  Is the company 
properly authorized to import this large quantity of 
ammunition components? 
 
--What authorization is required to import ammunition 
components into South Africa?  Are there any restrictions on 
the calibers and quantities of ammunition that is sold 
commercially? 
 
--Do you have any information on African Outdoor Sports that 
would question their reliability as a recipient of U.S. 
defense articles? 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
