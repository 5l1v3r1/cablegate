¶1. (SBU) On March 6, we delivered reftel points to Linyi 
Baidal, the MFA's new Deputy Director of Foreign Policy. 
Baidal "welcomed" the U.S. back as an observer to the UNHRC, 
and she repeated Costa Rica's view that it was better to work 
from within the Council (Refs B and C); if not, it left the 
space open for other countries to hijack human rights issues. 
 Baidal told us again that Costa Rica would not seek a UNHRC 
seat during the current administration (which ends in 2010) 
due to its small staff and other ongoing GOCR priorities, 
such as the UNSC. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Regarding the Durban Review Conference text, Baidal 
understood the U.S. posture but offered no substantive 
response.  She told us that the GOCR had just begun the 
process of developing its own position in consultation with 
other governmental entities and NGOs.  She felt certain that 
the GOCR position would be consistent with its past views on 
this issue.  Baidal reiterated the GOCR's support for 
Universal Periodic Review (Ref B).
