Upcoming Taiwan Election 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. At the March 6 regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesperson Qin 
Gang said the upcoming election in Taiwan is an election of a local 
leader, not a Presidential election.  Qin referred the question to 
"other relevant authorities." 
 
President Hu's Visit to Japan Under Discussion 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. President Hu's visit to Japan is still under active discussion, 
Qin said.  This visit will promote "long-term stability" and 
"healthy development" of China-Japan relation, Qin added.  Both 
countries are committed to establishing a strategic partnership. 
 
Japan Dumpling Case 
------------------- 
 
¶4. Regarding the case of Chinese poisoned dumplings found in Japan, 
Qin said relevant Chinese authorities have taken every measure 
necessary to carry out a "serious and responsible investigation" and 
have released the initial results of that investigation.  To find 
the truth, the Chinese investigation will continue, Qin added. 
Until the completion of a "fair and scientific" joint investigation, 
neither side should draw unilateral conclusions.  China hopes to 
establish a long-term mechanism with Japan on food security 
cooperation. 
 
China's Role on the International Stage 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. "China would like to create a world of lasting peace, common 
development and prosperity," Qin said regarding China's role in the 
international stage in the next five years.  China follows a 
"foreign policy of peace and common development," Qin added.  With 
regard to the DPRK nuclear issue and other disputes, China believes 
all countries should follow the "five principles of peaceful 
coexistence."  In sum, China will continue to adhere to a "path of 
peaceful development" and "open policies of mutual benefit." 
 
Australian Hostage Case Still Under Investigation 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶6. Asked about the recent case of Australians being taken hostage in 
Xian, Qin said the case is still under investigation.  Qin confirmed 
that all hostages have been safely rescued and expressed sympathy to 
those held hostage.  The Chinese Government has always attached 
great importance to protecting the security of foreign citizens in 
China and will continue to provide a safe environment for foreign 
tourists, Qin added.  Especially with the upcoming Olympics, China 
will carry out more effective measures in this regard.
