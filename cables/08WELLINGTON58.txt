SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND DOES NOT SUPPORT ISRAELI MEMBERSHIP IN 
JUSCANZ GROUP 
 
REF: STATE 16185 
 
Classified By: Embassy Wellington DCM David J. Keegan. Reasons: 1.4 (b) 
 and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) DCM David Keegan presented reftel demarche February 21 
to Carolyn Forsyth, Deputy Secretary in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) responsible for 
international organization issues. After DCM reviewed U.S. 
concerns and our assessment of the importance of Israel into 
full membership and participation the JUSCANZ group, Forsyth 
responded that New Zealand's position has not changed since 
Foreign Minister Peters was demarched by the U.S., Australia, 
and Canada in May 2006. New Zealand does not support Israel's 
membership, but it recognizes the importance of this issue to 
the United States, and it will therefore not stand in the way 
of a genuine consensus in favor of Israel's membership. 
However, it does not conclude that such a genuine consensus 
exists. 
 
¶2. (C) New Zealand supports Israel's participation in WEOG 
for electoral purposes, Forsyth said. It does not consider 
this to be a precedent for Israel's participation in other 
WEOG groups. JUSCANZ in particular, she noted, is a 
"like-minded" group in New Zealand's view. It is not a group 
simply for information sharing. New Zealand does not consider 
Israel to be "like-minded" on the issues of human rights 
given its treatment of Palestinians. Forsyth hastened to add 
that New Zealand recognizes there are faults on the 
Palestinian side, "but that is not the issue here." 
 
¶3. (C) Before considering Israel's membership in JUSCANZ, New 
Zealand is seeking and believes other JUSCANZ members are 
seeking a discussion of the criteria for membership and the 
purpose of the group. In such a discussion, she indicated 
that New Zealand would argue that JUSCANZ is a group of 
"like-minded" members for the purpose of policy coordination, 
and it would raise the human rights concerns which lead New 
Zealand to find Israel not to be "like-minded." 
 
¶4. (C) DCM emphasized the importance we attach to Israel's 
participation in JUSCANZ and our judgment that Israel is as 
qualified for such membership and participation as the 
current members of the group. Forsyth said simply that New 
Zealand does not accept that view. If a full discussion leads 
to a consensus in favor of Israel's membership, New Zealand 
"would give way if it is the last one standing" in deference 
to the U.S. interest.
