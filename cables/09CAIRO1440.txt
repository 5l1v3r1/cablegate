SUBJECT: EGYPT'S ECONOMY: JULY 27 PRESS ROUND-UP 
 
¶1. (U) The following are notable economic news stories that appeared 
over the past week in the Egyptian press: 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Tax Revenues Increased 21% in FY2008/09 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Egypt's tax revenues increased 21% to LE140.5 billion 
(US$25.27 billion) in FY2008/09, with LE89 billion (US$16 billion) 
from income taxes and LE51 billion (US$9.16 billion) from sales 
taxes, compared to LE76 billion (US$13.67 billion) and LE42 billion 
(US$7.55 billion) in income and sales taxes in FY2007/08, 
respectively, according to the chairman of the Egyptian Tax 
Authority, Ashraf Al Araby. He added that the global financial 
crisis did not impact tax revenues in FY2008/09, although he expects 
it to negatively affect tax revenues in the current fiscal year due 
to the drop in real growth and decreased private sector earnings.

Egypt Sets Targets for Food Self-Sufficiency

¶3. (U) Amin Abaza, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation,

million acres of land by 2030 in order to achieve self-sufficiency 
in strategic crops, including wheat, maize, and sugar, at a total 
investment cost of LE34 billion (US$6.12 billion). Moreover, he 
added that Egypt is planning to increase the total area of wheat

Egypt and Russia Discuss Nuclear Cooperation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy, Hassan 
Younis, met with the head of the Russian Atomic Energy Agency, 
Sergei Kiriyenko, to discuss ways forward for bilateral cooperation 
on nuclear power plants and technical training. Egypt and Russia 
agreed last year to significant Russian support for Egypt's nascent 
nuclear energy industry. (Al Ahram, 7/19/09)

Government Postpones Fixed-Line Phone Tender Again 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5. (U) The Egyptian Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology (MCIT) again postponed the sale of a second fixed phone 
line operator license, citing continued financial turbulence and 
slow recovery in capital markets. The sale of the tender would end 
Telecom Egypt's current monopoly over the market. The Ministry had 
previously delayed the tender for a year in September 2008. However, 
according to MCIT statements, the Ministry is expected to revisit 
the issue over the next several months. (Al Mal, 7/19/09)
