In Today's Papers 
 
Americans Voters Elect Barack Obama 
Broadcast and internet news outlets this morning feature Barack 
Obama's electoral victory as their feature story.  NTV reports in, 
"The First Black President," that "The dream came true."  CNN Turk 
headlines with "The Dream Comes True," as "Obama writes history," 
but notes, "While Barack Obama is the first black person to be 
elected president, racial discrimination still continues in the 
U.S."  Mainstream Hurriyet carries the headlines, "The American 
Dream Comes True," and "Obama: The World's New Boss," on its 
website.  Islamist-oriented Zaman carries the headline, "Change Has 
Come to America," on its website.  In a related story, Zaman reports 
in "The Dark Picture of Racism in America," that "despite the fact 
that Obama is elected the first African-American President, racism 
still continues against African-Americans in healthcare, the 
economy, and the court system."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak 
carries the headline, "A Black President Goes to the White House," 
on their website.  Liberal Radikal carries the headline, "They Said 
This Day Would Never Come," on their website.  Mainstream Sabah's 
website quotes from the President Elect's victory speech in the 
headline, "We Will Build a New Country."  Far-right Ortadogu reports 
on its website, "Obama owes his victory to votes from 
African-Americans, women, Hispanics and young people."  Conservative 
Turkiye reports, "The U.S. Salutes its First Black President." 
Economic daily Referans reports, "The New U.S. President is taking 
control of a country with a ruined economy." 
 
 
The World's New Boss: From mainstream Hurriyet's web page; 
www.hurriyet.com.tr 
 
Cartoon from today's mainstream Sabah entitled, "The World 
Rejoices," as one man asks "Are you happy that America has a new 
President?" and the answer is "No, it's that the old President is 
going." 
 
Editorial Opinion on President Elect Barack Obama 
Hasan Cemal wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "Let's hope Barack Obama 
makes history in the White House by bringing change, which is very 
important not only for Americans but also for the entire world. 
Let's hope his policy approach includes diplomacy and dialogue, as 
opposed to the Bush administration's unilateral and know-it-all 
approach.  It seems there will be a better future with a Barack 
Obama presidency." 
 
Hasan Bulent Kahraman wrote in mainstream Sabah: "The Bush 
administration undoubtedly will leave a black mark on American 
history.  Yet what matters now is what will happen after the 
elections.  Had McCain been elected, the world would have suffered 
even more from neo-conservative globalization and the use of force. 
With Obama's victory, the main question is - how much will the 
United States actually change?  That is important about America's 
future as well." 
 
Kursat Bumin wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "The most 
meaningful part of the election results comes with the fact that 
citizens of a country had the capacity to change themselves.  They 
elected a black person as their leader while the same country and 
the same citizens are remembered for serious racism issues not so 
long ago." 
 
Cengiz Candar wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "Obama is an 
American but he has characteristics from all of us in the world.  He 
is a reflection of us and he is aware of this capacity.  And this 
very American has been elected President of the United States, which 
is the best news of 2008."

PM Erdogan's Remarks Stir Controversy 
During his trip to the largely Kurdish Southeast of Turkey over the 
weekend, PM Erdogan angered many Kurds when he said, "Those who 
reject the concept of one flag and one nation are free to leave and 
go anywhere they want," which many media outlets translated as 
"Turkey - love it or leave it." In the front page headline "The 
Sheriff" Vatan mocked Prime Minister Erdogan's approach to the 
issue.  Leftist Taraf characterized the words as "horrifying." 
Referring to PM Erdogan's comment that "citizens armed with 
pump-action rifles had the right to defend themselves," main 
opposition leader Baykal said, "If people are left to defend 
themselves, there is no reason for a prime minister and a 
government.  Erdogan has no right to say 'Turkey - love it or leave 
it.'  He should leave if he fails to fulfill his responsibilities, 
but we will all continue living together."  Daily Taraf notes "even 
Baykal tells the truth." 
 
All papers report CHP leader Baykal's reactions to PM Erdogan's 
comment and they also add DTP leader Ahmet Turk's further reaction. 
During his party group meeting at parliament, Chairman Turk 
expressed concern that PM Erdogan is encouraging attacks against the 
DTP. 
 
Almost a Fist Fight at Parliament 
Due to Radio Television Supreme Board (RTUK) Chairman Zahid Akman's 
inclusion in the controversial Deniz Feneri corruption case in 
Germany, the CHP members of the RTUK commission refused to let Akman 
present a budget to the Commission, which nearly resulted in a fist 
fight between AKP and CHP members. In fact, bodyguards and security 
officials had to intervene to end the fighting. Radikal carries the 
headline, "Fist Fight for Akman" and Hurriyet says "AKP Assaults CHP 
for Akman's Sake" while both draw attention to the escalated tension 
in Parliament regarding RTUK. 
 
The EU Calls for a Free Press in Turkey 
Mainstreams Hurriyet and Milliyet report that EU Commissioner for 
Enlargement Olli Rehn told the European Parliament, "The freedom of 
the press and the freedom of expression should be included in 
Turkey's reform process."  Rehn also noted, "The negative stance 
towards the media in Turkey has become a serious source of concern. 
Reforms should be made immediately." 
 
Duchess of York:  "I had no Political Goals" 
Liberal Radikal and leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet report that Sarah 
Ferguson, theDuchess of York, responded to criticism from the 
Turkish government for secretly taking photos of poor conditions in 
Turkish orphanages.  She told the press, "I had no political goals 
or bad intentions."
