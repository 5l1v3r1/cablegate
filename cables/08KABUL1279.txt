SUBJECT: CANADIAN ACTIVITIES IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. Canadian contributions to rebuiling Afghanistan have been 
substantial both in miliatry and in development terms. The 
Canadian military presence in Afghanistan constitutes its 
largest deployment since the Korean War.  In terms of aid, 
Canada is one of the world's top donors to Afghanistan, 
making it Canada's largest ever bilateral recipient of aid. 
 
¶2. Military Contribution 
 
Not only does the Canadian military deployment to Afghanistan 
represent its largest since the Korean War, but Canadian 
sacrifice in terms all lives lost can not be overestimated. 
In proportion to the size of its deployment, Canada has lost 
more soldiers than any other country and is Canada's largest 
since the Korean War. 
 
Canadian efforts in Kanadahar. 
 
¶3. Canadian Aid to Afghanistan 
 
Following the 2002 Tokyo Conference on Afghan Reconstruction, 
Canada responded to the Government of Afghanistan's appeal 
for long-term development investment by significantly 
blostering its commitment to the country, making it Canada's 
largest ever bilateral aid recipient.  Canadian funding goes 
to support projects consistent with the three pillars of the 
Afghanistan Compact: security, governance and socio-economic 
development.  For fiscal year 2006-2007, their bilateral 
assistance totalled more than $179 million.  Of that, $49 
million was disbursed in Kandahar. 
 
¶4.  Canadian projects in Afghanistan - 2006-07 Fiscal Year: 
 
      a.  Sustainable Rural Livelihoods and Community-based 
Development - $50 million 
 
      Includes contribution to the National Solidarity 
Program (NSP), the Afghan Government's primary program for 
community development.  Other programs focus on mine 
cleareance, food security and alternative livelihoods. 
 
      b.  Democratic Development and Effective Governance - 
$58 million 
 
      The main thrust in this area is through direct 
contributions to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund 
(ARTF).  The ARTF supports the Afghan Government's efforts to 
re-establish a fully functioning and representative 
government system.  Funding also goes to efforts to 
strengthen the rule of law, aid subnational governance and 
others. 
 
      c.  Role of Women and Girls in Society (including 
Education) - $34 million 
 
      The majority of funds under this heading go to support 
microfinance in Afghanistan.  Funds also go to assist widows, 
promote gender equality and girls' primary education. 
 
      d.  Kandahar Specific Initiatives - $38 million (note: 
some of the funds for the nationwide projects above are also 
directed to Kandahar bringing the total to $49 million for 
Kandahar) 
 
      Highway construction, emergency food assistance and 
polio eradication account for the bulk of this $38 million.
