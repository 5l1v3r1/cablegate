SUBJECT: WESTERWELLE WILL NOT ATTEND LONDON CONFERENCE ON 
YEMEN 
 
REF: STATE 6940 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Poloff met with MFA Desk Officer responsible for 
Yemen Gudrun Masloch January 26 to provide reftel points and 
discuss Germany's approach to Yemen.  Gudrun said that due to 
Bundestag meetings, Foreign Minister Westerwelle will not 
attend the January 27 London Conference on Yemen, but will 
send MFA State Minister Werner Hoyer and MFA Near East 
assistant secretary equivalent Andreas Michaelis.  Masloch 
(only one week in her position, coming from Riga) said that 
reftel talking points are fairly general, but appear to track 
German thinking.  She said she would confer with colleagues 
and notify us of any substantive responses to the points. 
Masloch asked whether Yemen had indicated it would commit to 
any IMF programs.  Masloch also provided Poloff with an MFA 
non paper on Yemen which post will email to NEA/ARP 
separately.
