SUBJECT: FOOD SECURITY OPPORTUNITY FOR PRESIDENTIAL VISIT 
 
REF: (A) 09 JAKARTA 2031; (B) 09 JAKARTA 1473; (C) 10 JAKARTA 62 
 
¶1. We have an opportunity to develop a real U.S.-Indonesia 
Partnership on Agricultural Innovation and Investment as part of 
joint efforts on food security for President Obama's planned March 
visit.  President Yudhoyono has publicly stated interest for a U.S. 
partnership on food security.  Indonesians value cooperation with 
the United States and want a stronger partnership.  They are 
considering regulatory changes that would facilitate greater use of 
biotech crops and agricultural investment, an area where U.S. 
companies are ready to compete.  We need quick Washington action to 
seize this opening. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶2. To meet these goals before a POTUS visit, Post requests the 
following: 
 
-- Include Indonesia in the Food Security Initiative (Ref A). 
 
-- Approve funding for a marine research center (Ref B), to enable 
Indonesia to better manage its fisheries and ensure the continued 
supply of a vital food source. 
 
-- Approve funding for Post's proposed biotech workshop as part of 
joint food security efforts (Ref C), so that it can be held by late 
February.  Identify a high-level Washington visitor who could 
participate in the workshop. 
 
Food Security Goals 
------------------- 
 
¶3. Food Security Initiative:  Almost half of Indonesia's 240 million 
population lives on less than $2 a day.  Thirteen million children 
are malnourished.  Most poor families live in rural areas and depend 
on the agriculture sector for family incomes.  The best 
opportunities for raising rural family incomes, reducing poverty, 
and increasing food security are in small-holder cash commodities: 
horticulture and fish for the demanding urban market, and coffee and 
cocoa for export. To revitalize Indonesia's rural agriculture 
sector, the U.S. and other donors need to return to substantial, 
steady investment in the rural agricultural sector, giving first 
priority to agriculture and fisheries institutions for teaching, 
research and extension. 
 
¶4. Fisheries Center:  Sustainable fisheries are critical to 
Indonesian food security.  60% of Indonesian's protein comes from 
fish.  The Embassy has promoted the concept of a Center for 
Sustainable Ocean Fisheries to encourage fisheries research, 
fisheries management, and monitoring.  Such a center would focus on 
healthy, sustainable ocean fisheries, but would also address climate 
change impacts on oceans and coastal communities and the importance 
of climate change adaptation. 
 
¶5. Biotech and Investment Workshop:  The United States and Indonesia 
would like to jointly host a workshop on Agricultural Innovation and 
Investment the last week in February.  The workshop will generate an 
action plan to further agricultural innovation and investment, 
including biotech crops, as part of efforts to enhance food 
security, for senior policy review by both parties.  That agenda 
will focus on broad bilateral policy coordination to stimulate 
private sector engagement and collaboration between the United 
States and Indonesia to promote agricultural innovation and 
investment.  U/S Otero will be in Jakarta that week, and we would 
welcome her participation.
