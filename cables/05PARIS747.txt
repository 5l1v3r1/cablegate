SUBJECT: OFFICIAL GOF REACTION TO DEATH OF TOGO PRESIDENT 
EYADEMA 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  Both President Chirac and the MFA issued brief 
communiques following the death on February 5 of Togo's 
President Gnassingbe Eyadema.  Informal Embassy translations 
of both texts follow: 
 
¶2.  (U)  Elysee Communique (February 5, 2005): 
 
BEGIN COMMUNIQUE: 
 
--  It is with profound sadness that I learn of the sudden 
death of Gnassingbe Eyadema, President of the Republic of 
Togo. 
 
--  With him disappears a friend of France who was for me a 
personal friend. 
 
--  In these sad hours, I address to his family my very 
sincere condolences. 
 
--  My thoughts turn to the Togolese people.  They will find 
themselves, I am sure, brought together democratically 
through this ordeal, which takes place at the very moment 
when new perspectives were beginning to appear for Togo. 
 
--  I am certain that Africa feels cruelly the loss of he 
who, for so many years, consecrated his efforts to regional 
cooperation, mediation, and the search for peace. 
 
END COMMUNIQUE. 
 
¶3.  (U)  MFA Communique (February 6, 2005): 
 
BEGIN COMMUNIQUE: 
 
--  On the day after the disappearance of President Eyadema, 
France considers indispensable respect for the Togolese 
Constitution.  The transition should therefore be assured, in 
conformity with the dispositions of this Constitution, and in 
strict respect of legality, by the President of the National 
Assembly.  Beyond this intermediate period, it belongs to the 
Togolese people to express themselves freely and 
democratically. 
 
--  In this new phase which opens for Togo, it is essential 
to oversee that the process of dialogue with the European 
Union, begun under the aegis of President Eyadema, continues 
and succeeds as rapidly as possible. 
 
END COMMUNIQUE. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Abidjan minimize considered.
