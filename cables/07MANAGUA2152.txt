¶1. (U) Summary: On August 23, the National Port Authority (EPN) 
signed a $510,000 grant agreement with the United States Trade 
Development Agency (USTDA) for technical assistance in drafting a 
National Ports Law.  The new law will allow, for the first time, 
public-private investment in the country's small and inadequate 
ports.  Noting that almost 60% of all Nicaragua maritime trade must 
pass through either Honduras or Costa Rica, EPN President Silva 
asserted that private investment in this sector is vital for 
modernization and for Nicaragua to be competitive.  In his remarks 
at the event, the Ambassador sent a strong message about the 
importance of a clear and stable legal environment in attracting 
foreign investment.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On August 23, the National Port Authority (EPN) hosted a 
signing ceremony to publicize a grant agreement between EPN and the 
United States Trade Development Agency (USTDA) for technical 
assistance in drafting a National Ports Law.  The $510,000 award 
will help create a law which would allow, for the first time, 
public-private investment in the country's small and inadequate 
ports (Ref B).  The Ambassador signed the grant agreement on behalf 
of USTDA and EPN President Virgilio Silva signed the agreement on 
behalf of EPN.  Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs for Cooperation 
Valdrack Jentske and Minister of Finance Alberto Jose Guevarra 
topped the list of Nicaraguan officials attending the ceremony. 
 
¶3. (U) EPN President Silva used the ceremony as a political platform 
to both criticize the previous EPN administration for "bankrupting" 
the maritime agency (a charge that has not been proven) and promote 
the development of a National Ports Law.  Silva asserted that 
private investment "is vital to the modernization of the country's 
port" and that the creation of National Ports Law is "a necessity to 
be competitive."  A brief slide show featuring photos of a 
dilapidated Port of Corinto on the Pacific coast and the lack of a 
port of the Atlantic coast supported Silva's message.  "Almost 60% 
of all Nicaragua maritime trade must pass through either Honduras or 
Costa Rica and travel overland to Nicaragua," Silva asserted.  "This 
demonstrates a profound lack of shipping capacity and economic 
competitiveness in the region." 
 
¶4. (U) In his remarks, the Ambassador addressed the misuse of a tax 
lien to attach Exxon assets at the Port of Corinto (Ref A) and sent 
a strong message about the importance of clear and stable law in 
attracting foreign investment.  "We are supporting the creation of a 
port's law because foreign investment can only be achieved inside a 
stable legal framework, where the rules of the game are clear," 
stated the Ambassador.  While Exxon is a large company able to 
weather the storm, other smaller investors "see the horror of the 
government taking private property and using it for their own 
purposes."  "How does this impact the perception of foreign 
investors?" the Ambassador asked the audience of 25 Nicaraguan 
officials and maritime industry leaders. 
 
¶5. (U) The USTDA grant is the third in Nicaragua under USTDA's 
Commercial Integration Initiative.  Currently in Nicaragua USTDA is 
funding a $470,000 feasibility study for the expansion of the Port 
of Corinto and a $320,000 study for the expansion of cargo handling 
facility at Managua International Airport.  USTDA has invested more 
than $6.2 million in Central American countries via its Commercial 
Integration Initiative.
