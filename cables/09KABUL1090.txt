Mission Afghanistan 
 
1.A/COM INTRODUCTION: I endorse the following message 
from Kabul Chief Knowledge Officer (CKO) Kathleen Lively, 
and ask Department and USAID leadership's support for our 
plan.  CKO Lively has been leading an IM interagency task 
force combining civilian agencies under COM authority and 
USFOR-A J6.  This team's goal is to improve intra-USG 
Information Communication Technology (ICT) systems and 
exploitation of them, with a longer-range goal of 
improving USG collaboration via ICT with host nation, 
third country, and NGO partners.  We believe this goal is 
directly in line with President Obama's "whole of 
government" philosophy. 
 
Begin CKO plan: 
Summary 
======= 
¶2. We must move forward as a Mission, not a collection of 
disparate Agencies, to succeed in Afghanistan.  It is 
thus critical to create and maintain effective 
collaboration and robust Knowledge Management across USG 
agencies and elements throughout Afghanistan, and between 
us and colleagues in Washington, Islamabad and CENTCOM. 
To do so we must overcome the seams among our many 
custom-built IM networks we all access.  U.S. Mission 
Afghanistan requests the Department's (including USAID's) 
assistance in three keys areas: 
 
      -- 1) The migration to one Unclassified network as 
discussed in KABUL 1089 to improve policy coordination 
and management efficiencies while meeting the business 
requirements of all agencies; 
 
      -- 2) Extensive promotion of and training on 
existing collaboration tools such as Intelink, Net 
Centric Diplomacy (NCD), Communities at State, SharePoint 
and Adobe Connect to Mission staff; and 
 
      -- 3) Resources to fund and implement a method to 
create a timely, seamless flow of information from 
unclassified sources and networks to higher-level, secure 
government networks. 
 
Improving System Performance 
============================ 
¶3. While one network will be a great leap forward in 
terms of coordination, U.S. Mission Afghanistan's limited 
communication infrastructure and staff are also 
impediments to success.  We request that IRM engineers 
explore ways to improve the performance of our 
collaboration tools on both the Classified and 
Unclassified networks so that Mission users can access 
and use these tools more quickly and efficiently. 
 
Training and Subject Matter Expertise Needed 
============================================ 
¶4. We need assistance from the Department and other 
experts in sensitizing and training our staff regarding 
existing tools such as Intelink, uGov mail, NCD, 
SharePoint , and Communities at State. We are requesting 
a joint IRM and RM/IRP team travel to post to train all 
Mission staff in the effective use of these tools.  This 
training must be complemented by efforts in Washington to 
ensure that staff traveling to post have Intelink 
Passports and that Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) 
employees also have uGov mail accounts.  This area is 
ripe for collaborating with our host nation, third 
country and NGO/private sector partners.   We request 
that the Department reach out to experts such as 
Microsoft that have partnered with us in the past on 
SharePoint and other collaboration tools to assist us 
with establishing an effective collaboration site, 
sharing government best practices for collaboration 
standards and processes, and helping us to get the most 
out of these robust tools. 
 
Tapping into Critical Unclassified Information 
============================================= = 
 
¶5. There are many important inputs from the PRTs and 
others located off the Embassy compound, such as our 
implementing partners and NGOs, that exist in the 
unclassified realm, but with too limited access to 
government networks.  We need an easy way to ensure that 
this wealth of information can enter our collaboration 
space and be made available to all Mission elements. 
Other Agencies, implementing partners, and PRT officers 
require a better way to exchange and access information 
before stovepipes lead to ill-informed decisions on 
critical issues.  Accordingly, important ground-truth 
information from a variety of reporters needs to make a 
seamless migration to the classified enclave for analysts 
and policymakers who exist virtually only on higher 
networks.  Mission Afghanistan requests that the 
Department send a software development team to gather 
requirements in order to make this important pathway for 
information sharing a quick reality. 
 
We Succeed Together 
=================== 
¶6. While we are making progress on leveraging existing 
tools such as Intelink and uGov email we request the 
Department's assistance on these issues to meet the 
President's objectives in Afghanistan; State and USAID 
need to be in lockstep on one network, existing tools 
need to be familiar and dependable for all Mission 
employees, and a connector between the unclassified and 
classified enclaves needs to be built to tap the wealth 
of information that is available on the unclassified 
side. We ask for Department (including USAID) 
leadership's support and active engagement to realize 
these goals.
