  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S. SUDAN POLICY 
 
"Subtle changes" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(10/23)(pg 
3): "The Obama administration's new strategy on Sudan signifies that 
the U.S. government has subtly changed its attitude towards the 
government in Sudan from one of 'sanctions' to one of 'dialogue.' 
The U.S. is also focusing on both long-term and short-term issues in 
Sudan, rather than on just short-term issues.  The U.S. has adopted 
a more active attitude towards Sudan.  This policy adjustment is 
both flexible and realistic.  However, whether or not the U.S. can 
implement this new strategy remains to be seen.  Some aspects of the 
new strategy remain unchanged and are still obstacles for the 
improvement of U.S.-Sudan relations." 
 
¶2.  JCCT 
 
"Three U.S. departments low-profile on JCCT outreach" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(10/23)(pg 3): 
"Washington scholars believe that the fact that the U.S. has taken 
such a low-profile approach [in the media] towards the upcoming 
Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) indicates that the 
meeting will not achieve any significant results.  It also reflects 
the current subtleties in U.S.-China trade and economic relations. 
The IPR issue will be the major focus of the JCCT.  However, U.S. 
officials have not given any clear indications on discussing the 
market economy position of China.  They have also been vague about 
whether or not the RMB exchange rate issue will be included in the 
agenda.  The U.S.-China trade policy still faces a severe challenge 
since high unemployment in the U.S. will continue until at least the 
end of the year." 
 
¶3.  AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN 
 
"Little chance of winning the 'Afghanistan and Pakistan War'" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(10/23)(pg 2): 
"The 'Afghanistan and Pakistan War' is an extension of the war in 
Afghanistan.  Obama has clearly shifted his diplomatic focus to 
Afghanistan and Pakistan and has been trying hard to remedy Bush's 
quagmire in Iraq.  However, he is likely to fall into another 
quagmire.  It is useless for the U.S to send endless troops to 
Afghanistan, since the Europeans are not interested in this matter 
and the United States' foes, the Taliban and al-Qaeda, are always 
hidden in the dark.  The so-called 'War on Terror' is very different 
from a traditional war.  The suffering in a traditional war is 
short, whereas a new war like the 'War on Terror' will never end and 
is full of political stratagems, military frustration, extremist 
hysteria, and the blood and tears of the civilian population.  It is 
not wise for Obama to shift the focus from Iraq to Afghanistan and 
Pakistan.  If the U.S. really wants to fight against terrorists, the 
most effective way to do so is to seek the cooperation of multiple 
parties.  Additional economic assistance could also bring more 
benefits to the local people and decrease the influence of the 
Taliban and Al-Qaeda.  Endlessly increasing troops will cause the 
U.S. to spend more than it can afford.  At this point, [University 
of Chicago historian] John Mearsheimer's 'offshore balancing 
strategy' is cleverer than the military resolution advocated by the 
neo-conservatives."
