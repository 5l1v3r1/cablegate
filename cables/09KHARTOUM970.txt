¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Congressman Keith Ellison traveled to El Fasher, 
North Darfur on August 6 to visit the Zam Zam Internally Displaced 
Persons (IDP) camp.  Conditions at the camp have deteriorated 
following an influx of 30,000 IDPs from South Darfur in February and 
the expulsion of humanitarian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
in March.  North Darfur Assistant Governor Idriss Hassan told the 
Congressman his government cannot meet the needs of returnees, and 
asked for assistance.  UN African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) 
troop deployment is currently at 71 percent and will reach 96 
percent by year end. The Government of Sudan has delayed visas for 
50 top Western military officers, leaving UNAMID with only four 
experienced Western officers; UN officials asked the United States 
to intervene.  Delays in the deployment of two Formed Police Units 
(FPUs) has left only one FPU available to patrol three large camps 
with IDPs totaling more than 140,000.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Governor Asks Help with Returns 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Congressman Keith Ellison, Charge' d'Affcires (CDA)  and 
accompanying delegation met Assistant Governor (Wali) of North 
Darfur, Idriss Abdalla Hassan in the Wali's offices in El Fasher on 
August 6.  Hassan thanked the delegation for their visit, which he 
viewed as a sign of improvement in the "special relationship" 
between Sudan and the United States.  Security in North Darfur has 
improved dramatically in the last year, Hassan said, the result of 
diminishing friction between the Darfuri rebels and the Government 
of Sudan (GOS), and reestablishment of the social fabric in North 
Darfur.  The Wali's office is cooperating with UNAMID and the NGOs 
operating in North Darfur, which Hassan called a positive 
development for all partners.  Hassan told the Congressman that 
while El Fasher-based IDPs are eager to return home, assistance is 
needed to support their returns, reconstruct their former homes, and 
develop the local agrarian economies upon which most IDPs formerly 
depended.  Hassan cited a recent figure of 1,127 IDPs who had 
returned recently from North Darfur to Haskanita, South Darfur, but 
admitted that the GOS was ill-equipped to fully assist them.  "The 
government gave them necessities, but what we have is not enough," 
Hassan said.  "When we conclude it is beyond our capacity, then we 
need external support." 
 
Zam Zam Conditions Deteriorating 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Escorted by UNAMID police and Rwandan peacekeepers, 
Congressman Ellison, CDA and accompanying delegation traveled 17 
kilometers southwest of El Fasher to Zam Zam IDP camp.  Home to over 
100,000 Zaghawa IDPs, Zam Zam once hosted large-scale USAID-funded 
relief projects through partners CHF International and International 
Rescue Committee, both of which were expelled in March. 
Representatives from Relief International (RI) in North Darfur told 
Congressman Ellison that RI is working to fill the gap left by the 
expulsion of the NGOs in March 2009, but the need for large-scale 
emergency humanitarian relief is growing.  Conditions in the camp 
are deteriorating, the RI representative said. 
 
¶4.  (U) Visiting the location of the former CHF clinic in Zam Zam, 
Congressman Ellison was greeted by young Darfuri students who had 
crowded to the location after GOS authorities converted the 
straw-walled structures into a school.  Amid the heavy stench of 
untreated sewage, teachers and students all pleaded for more 
assistance to the location, saying it lacked teachers, books, 
classroom materials and transportation.  Badr Ishaq, a former 
administrator for CHF who has spent four years running the clinic in 
Zam Zam, added that conditions at the school are not optimal for 
learning.  "We need CHF," he told Congressman Ellison. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Zam Zam IDP leaders, including Zam Zam Umda (chief leader), 
Adam Omar Ahmed, detailed the deterioration of services within the 
camp since the arrival in February of up to 30,000 new IDPs fleeing 
conflict in South Darfur, followed closely by the expulsion of CHF, 
IRC and Oxfam UK from the camp in March.  Umda Ahmed and other 
leaders asked the U.S. to further press the GOS on increasing 
humanitarian aid to the camp. The Umda told the delegation, "We are 
completely dependent on the international community."  Zahar 
Mansour, the appointed speaker for the young women among the recent 
arrivals to Zam Zam, said that the situation is particularly 
difficult for women in the camps.  Citing the scarcity of water and 
lack of medical facilities, she told Congressman Ellison, "Our 
suffering is your responsibility."   "No one is speaking on our 
behalf except Allah and the international community," a young man 
told the Congressman. 
 
UNAMID Deployment at 71 Percent 
 
KHARTOUM 00000970  002 OF 002 
 
 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Meeting at UNAMID headquarters in El Fasher, Darfur, AU-UN 
Joint Special Representative (JSR) Rodolphe Adada told the 
delegation that UNAMID peacekeeping troop deployment stands at 
13,938 troops, 71 percent of the total allowed under its mandate. 
JSR Adada expects steady progress on military deployment until the 
end of the year, when the total should reach 96 percent of 19,630 
total peacekeeping troops.  The end of Darfur's rainy season in 
September will bring with it increased mobility for UNAMID troops, 
but slow movement of contingent-owned equipment (COE) from source 
countries delays deployment to points far afield in Darfur. Colonel 
Noddy Stafford, Chief of J5 plans, suggested that the United States 
can assist by providing airlifts for COE from Port Sudan to El 
Fasher and Nyala. 
 
GOS Refusal to Grant Visas Serious Problem for UNAMID 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Adada called the GOS's refusal to grant visas to 
experienced Western military officers a "serious problem."  UNAMID 
currently projects that by the end of August this year, only four 
Western officers will remain with the mission, two from(Italy, one 
from Germany and one from the UK.  "The GOS is limiting visas to 
sensitive nationalities," Adada said, and urged the United States to 
raise the issue in discussions with the Sudanese.  Adada said that 
the current wait list for senior Western officers now includes over 
50 officers, but that does not take into account countries such as 
France that have stopped sending officers to UNAMID due to the 
delay. 
 
Police Units Deployments Delayed 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Elizabeth Muwanga, UNAMID Deputy Police Commander and 
Officer in Charge of UNAMID's substantial contingent of Formed 
Police Units (FPUs), told the delegation that while UNAMID's 
military deployment continues apace, UNAMID is facing a shortage of 
FPUs.  Tasked to patrol the IDP camps and coordinate with the GOS 
police to develop community policing centers, the FPUs are under 
deployed and under equipped for the task of policing among Darfur's 
2.7 million IDPs.  Muwanga asked that contributing countries send 
more female police officers and policing equipment.  She also 
requested that the international community address delays in the 
deployment of FPUs.  Police Colonel Johni Asadoma, leader of the 
Indonesian Formed Police Unit (FPU) that escorted the delegation on 
August 6, noted that his contingent was also under equipped and 
spread too thin.  According to Asadoma, ideally, El Fasher's three 
IDP camps would be patrolled by one FPU each, but delays in 
deployment have hamstrung the Egyptian and Jordanian FPUs meant for 
the other camps. For that reason, the 140-man Indonesian force has 
to patrol Zam Zam, Abu Shouk and Al Salaam IDP camps, a total 
population of around 140,000 IDPs. 
 
¶9. (SBU) COMMENT: Thanks to the GOS's recent affection for U.S. 
Congressional delegations, Rep. Ellison's visit to Darfur proceeded 
smoothly.  Local authorities permitted the delegation to access 
honest perspectives from a wide variety of parties on the ground in 
El Fasher.  Zam Zam IDPs would agree with the Assistant Wali's 
assessment of GOS capacities in Darfur: the GOS cannot handle the 
humanitarian effort on its own.  For example, piecemeal GOS attempts 
to return educational services to Zam Zam have resulted in one 
underfunded school in a camp that once hosted 20 functioning IRC 
kindergartens (ref B).  UNAMID's struggles to deploy fully are 
well-known, but significant progress will have been achieved by the 
end of this year.  Post agrees with the assessment by JSR Adada that 
the refusal to issue visas to Western officers is a "serious 
problem," and his newfound honesty may reflect the fact that Adada 
is due to depart the mission within a few months.  Post will 
continue to follow the FPUs closely, as they bear the responsibility 
for bringing 24/7 security to the camps.  END COMMENT.
