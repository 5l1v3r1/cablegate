SUBJECT: COSTA RICA NOT YET COMMITTED TO PSI ENDORSEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 50811 
 
 ¶1.  On June 1, Post hosted a digital video conference (DVC) 
between members of the Costa Rica Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) and several officials in Washington from the Bureau of 
International Security and Nonproliferation as well as a 
Department of Defense official.  The Costa Rican delegation 
included Jorge Aguilar, Director of the Treaty Department at 
the MFA, Carlos Cordero, Director for Multilateral Policy at 
the MFA, and Victor Murillo, Technical Assistant for 
Multilateral Policy at the MFA.  Polish Ambassador, Andres 
Braitor, formerly a Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) 
negotiator, also attended the DVC. 
 
¶2.  The Washington delegation urged Costa Rica to endorse the 
PSI's Statement of Interdiction Principles in advance of the 
PSI Senior Level Political meeting in Poland later this June. 
 Costa Rica's participation in that conference was also 
urged.  Jorge Aguilar, who has an international law 
background, had several questions about the PSI and what 
Costa Rica's participation would require.  At the end of the 
conference, the Costa Rican delegation indicated that they 
would have to consult with Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno 
before committing in any way to the PSI.  Subsequently, 
Cordero told us that any decision pertaining to the PSI would 
have to wait until Foreign Minister Stagno returned on June 
16 from a trip to Europe.
