ON APPLICATION 050106202 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests AIT's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050106202 for the export 
of F-5 spare parts to Taiwan.  AIT is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of response to 
a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  GUO-Tong Technology Company (GUO), 
unfamiliar foreign consignee. 
 
¶4. ACTION: AIT is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate Taiwan R.O.C. Air Force (ROCAF) officials to 
determine if it ordered the items from GUO and that the 
articles are being used for the purpose stated on the 
license.  ROCAF POC is Col. An Bao-Chian, reference PO # 
GP97337P134PE dated May 26, 2008.  Department also requests 
that AIT conduct a site visit to GUO in order to provide an 
assessment of its business operations, on-site security, and 
general reliability as a recipient of United States Munitions 
List (USML) items. GUO POC is Hsin-i Huang, General Manager, 
TEL: 886-2-2871-6965, reference PO # GP97337P134PE dated May 
12, 2008.  The following questions are offered as suggested 
guidance with GUO: 
 
- Can GUO provide documentation (e.g. purchase order, 
contract, letter of intent) from the ROCAF establishing it as 
the end user for items in question? 
 
- Who are GUO's main clients? 
 
- Does the company understand the restrictions on Unites 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-export and retransfer? 
 
If a site visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case 
officer.   END ACTION.
