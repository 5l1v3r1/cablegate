¶1. (SBU) Atilla Fodor, First Secretary of the Hungarian Embassy in 
Pristina, briefed us Friday, October 16, on Hungary's hopes to 
represent Spain in Kosovo, during Spain's January-June 2010 EU 
presidency.  According to Fodor, intensive bilateral talks are 
underway, and a decision is expected no later than mid-November. 
Fodor expressed his ministry's desire to work closely with the 
United States on Kosovo issues both during the local presidency, 
should Spain select Hungary to represent it, as well as in its 
scheduled presidency in the first six months of 2011.  He noted that 
the Western Balkans would be Hungary's top priority in its 2011 
presidency.  In response, we told Fodor that the USG desires close 
coordination and cooperation with the EU, and that the Embassy looks 
forward to working closely with his mission, both in its capacity as 
local EU presidency, if selected, and in 2011. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶2. (SBU) While it is an internal matter to be decided by Spain and 
Hungary, the prospect of a state that recognizes Kosovo (Hungary) 
replacing a strident non-recognizer (Spain) as the local face of the 
EU presidency is nothing but positive.  We will work closely with 
the Hungarian Embassy in Pristina when it joins the European Troika.
