"Unacceptable Delay" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de Sco Paulo (8/2) 
editorialized: "After four years and at least 180,000 deaths, the UN 
has finally taken a concrete step to end the genocide in Darfur.... 
What is impressive in the case is the UN's delay in taking an 
action. Despite news reporting the bloodshed, UN diplomats were 
involved in an endless discussion whether the definition of genocide 
included in the 1948 Genocide Convention would apply or not to the 
situation in Darfur. Such inaction concealed other interests. China 
buys Sudanese oil. Russia, with its Chechen problem, is allergic to 
the word 'genocide' to justify interventions and embargos. In the 
beginning, the US preferred not to question Khartoum because of its 
support for anti-terrorism efforts. More recently however, in one of 
his few correct foreign policy decisions, President Bush increased 
pressures and imposed an embargo on Sudan. But the situation only 
changed with the election of a new British prime minister, Gordon 
Brown, and a new French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Both need to 
show that although members of the same party, they are different 
from their predecessors."
