¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Tactica Ltd., Moscow, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application: NLR as the ultimate 
consignee of parts and accessories for riflescopes and 
monoculars. The licensee is Leupold and Stevens, Inc., 
14400 NW Greenbrier Parkway, Beaverton, OR 97006. 
 
¶3. On March 27, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Tactica 
Ltd., 138 Varshavskoe Shosse, Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Sergey Korznikov, 
Commercial Director and Alexander Zviagin, General 
Director. 
 
¶4. Tactica is a retail sporting goods and tactical 
supplies store, specializing in optics.  Mr. 
Korznikov, a former member of the Federal Security 
Service (Russian acronym FSB) Alfa Group, founded the 
company in 2004.  NOTE: FSB Alfa Group is a special 
operations capable anti-terrorist unit. END NOTE. The 
company started as an internet-based business, but 
expanded within weeks to a showroom when Korznikov's 
neighbor decided to invest 200,000 USD in the new 
venture.  Tactica imports 90% of its inventory from 
the United States, and is a distributor for U.S. 
manufacturers such as 5.11, Blackhawk, SureFire, and 
others. The company employs 11 and operates from its 
showroom and office in a multi-tenant commercial 
building in southern Moscow. 
 
¶5. Tactica is the official law enforcement and 
military distributor for Leupold and Stevens in 
Russia. In addition, Tactica sells a variety of 
optical products and accessories to hunters and 
shooting sports enthusiasts.  The team was allowed to 
examine the purchase records, and was given copies of 
the end use statements and invoices. The items in the 
NLR shipment include rangefinder monoculars, rings, 
and lens caps for sporting rifle sights. The items 
have either been sold or are in stock.  Stock is 
maintained in a locked storeroom on site, and the 
store is protected by an electronic alarm system with 
remote monitoring by the security guards at the 
building complex. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends Tactica Ltd., 
Moscow, Russia as reliable recipients of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities.
