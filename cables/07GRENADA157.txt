SUBJECT: GRENADA WEEKLY ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 28 -  NOVEMBER 03, 
2007 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Grenada's weekly activity report (GWAR) provides 
a little detail about events of interest that do not merit 
longer reporting at this time. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin GWAR Text: 
 
¶A. Cuba's Ambassador In Grenada Attacks Embargo Unchallenged 
 
The Cuban ambassador to Grenada, Margarita Delgado accused 
Washington of wanting to cause hunger and desperation in Cuba. 
In the Grenada Advocate last weekend, she claimed that the aim 
of the U.S. is to deprive the Cuban people of their sovereignty 
and to return Cuba to the neo-colonial status. 
 
All reporting on the embargo in Grenada's media - newspaper, 
radio, and television - was one-sided.  Only one Grenadian media 
outlet sought to get the U.S. perspective on the embargo, and 
then did not air the interview with Chargi d'Affaires Karen Jo 
McIsaac. 
 
¶B. Disaster Preparedness Planning Training 
 
The office of National Disaster Management Agency (NaDMA) ran a 
short training course in Disaster Preparedness Planning with 
various groups including government ministers, permanent 
secretaries, pharmacists, Disaster Management district 
 
SIPDIS 
coordinators and other agencies.  The aim is to be better 
prepared in the event of a disaster.  The workshop was sponsored 
by USAID and conducted by Keith Ford a former employee of USAID. 
 The participants at the Friday's workshop expressed the need 
for all the groups to come together so everyone is on the same 
page. 
 
¶C. PM Asks Investors To Help Train 
 
Prime Minister Mitchell met with foreign and local investors to 
discuss employment and training for young people.  The meeting, 
which included representatives from Port Louis, Prickly Bay, 
Grand Harbour, Bacolet Bay, Quadriga, Four Seasons and Levera 
Resort, focused on getting the developers and investors involved 
in the Grenada Training and Employment Project (GTEP).  While 
the developers agreed it was a good idea, no one made any 
commitments, so it remains to be seen if they will follow 
through. 
 
¶D. PetroCaribe: First Shipment Arrives 
 
Grenada received the first shipment of fuel under the 
PetroCaribe agreement on October 25, but only reported this 
week.  According to the Spice Isle Review newspaper, at the 
ceremony marking the arrival of the first shipment, Managing 
Director of GRENLEC said that the new deal is more beneficial 
than the previous one with Texaco.  He said that his company has 
found a strategic partner and he expects a reliable supply of 
quality fuel. 
 
¶E. Minister for Tourism calls for Oprah to visit 
 
Minister for Tourism Clarice Modeste-Curwin asked the father of 
Oprah Winfrey to encourage his famous daughter to visit the 
Spice Isle.  Mr. Winfrey and his wife were on a visit to Grenada 
to mark the 24 anniversary of the 1983 American-Caribbean 
intervention.
