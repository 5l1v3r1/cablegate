Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida lead with news that Egypt has 
delivered to Palestinian "officials", invitations for a summit with 
all Palestinian factions, and a draft plan for ending the 
Palestinian "political crisis."  The "comprehensive national 
dialogue" meeting is set for November 9 in Cairo.  Al Quds quotes 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas in its front page story 
pledging to, "adhere to any Arab League decision about [unity] 
talks" and stressing the need for:  Arab oversight of security 
service reform, formation of a national unity government and 
commitment to PLO-signed agreements. 
 
Al Quds runs a lead story on "extremist Jews" illegally entering the 
Al Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem under heavy Israeli police 
protection on October 19, and injuring three mosque guards. 
Articles appear on inside pages calling for greater protection of 
the mosque and holding Israel responsible for any, "triggered 
reactions" by Palestinians to the mosque breeches.  The other two 
dailies also run front page stories on the incident, with Al Ayyam 
including news about Israeli West Bank settler violence against 
Palestinian farmers in the same story.  A photo of settlers guarded 
by Israeli soldiers near Nablus in the West Bank, appears on the 
front pages of Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida. 
 
All front pages report on statements by Israeli President Shimon 
Perez and Defense Minister Ehud Barak about the need to shift the 
peace process to include negotiations between Israel and all Arab 
countries, as well as the Arab League. Barak is quoted calling for 
an Israeli peace initiative similar to the Arab one.  Reporting does 
not reveal any details about Barak's plan. 
 
Al Quds' front page reports on Hamas' statements about the "calm" 
with Israel quoting Hamas spokesman Abu Obayda saying, "Israel has 
not adhered to the calm agreement, which is not a permanent one.  We 
have no confirmation of Israel's request that Egypt resume efforts 
to extend the calm."  Al Quds adds that the Popular Liberation Front 
and Islamic Jihad factions also believe that Israel has not abided 
by the conditions of the calm.  Another front page story about Gaza 
in Al Quds reports that Israeli protesters blocked the Kerem Shalom 
crossing to Gaza on October 19, calling for the release of kidnapped 
Israeli soldier Shalit.  Protesters threatened to stop food supplies 
to Gaza until they had updated news of Shalit.  Finally, Al Hayat Al 
Jadida reports on its front page that UNRWA has called for a lifting 
of Gaza crossing closures immediately.  UNRWA's Operations Director 
John Ging is quoted stating, "poverty has reached unprecedented 
levels in the Gaza Strip." 
 
Al Ayyam and Al Quds report on inside pages that Israel has begun 
expansion of the Kharsina settlement in eastern Hebron in the West 
Bank.  The paper, citing Wafa, reports that Israel has built three 
new buildings and constructed infrastructure in the settlement. 
 
Al Quds reports on an inside page that U.S. Consulate General and EU 
delegations visited the police academy in the West Bank city of 
Jericho on October 19 and expressed satisfaction over Palestinian 
Authority police computer and IT skills. 
 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam run a front page AFP wire story about former 
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell "abandoning" John McCain by 
endorsing Barack Obama for president.  Another wire story (DPA) on 
Al Ayyam's front page states that credit cards could cause another

financial crisis in the U.S. because of credit agreements cancelled 
by banks.

Weekend stories 
--------------- 
 
Sunday, October 19 
 
All dailies ran similar headlines that, "Jewish settlers disrupt the 
Palestinian olive harvest." The papers reported on settler attacks 
on Palestinian and international activists throughout the West Bank. 
 The latest attacks took place in Hebron during which one journalist 
and a foreign activist were injured and Israeli soldiers arrested 19 
activists.  All dailies feature the clashes, especially the attack 
on journalists, in front page photo coverage. 
 
A front page photo of Consul General Jake Walles and Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas introduced reporting on a meeting between 
the two officials to discuss, "latest developments," in Al Hayat Al 
Jadida.  Walles and Abbas met in Ramallah on October 18 to, "discuss 
efforts aimed at pushing the peace process forward." 
 
The Jordanian King feels pessimistic about the peace process, "for 
the first time," according to headlines in all three dailies.  The 
reporting came a day after Secretary General of the Arab League 
Mousa's comments appeared on all front pages, giving a read out of 
recent New York meetings and characterizing the peace process as, 
"chasing illusions." 
 
Al Quds' front page reported news about a "verbal letter" sent by 
Secretary Rice to Hamas requesting that Hamas, "look at the changes 
taking place around" them.  Hamas member Mahmud Al Zahar responded 
during an October 18 press conference in Damascus that Hamas, 
"always looks around, and we are always reassured of our political 
convictions. We stress that what we hear from the Americans is not 
sacred and has only brought disaster upon our nation."  In October 
18 reporting in Al Hayat Al Jadida and Al Ayyam, Hamas leader 
Haniyyah was quoted calling the economic crisis, "divine punishment 
of America." 
 
Al Ayyam's front page reported comments made by Hamas leader Said 
Siyam stating that, "nobody, not any of the PLO factions, nor the 
regional or international powers, can give [Palestinian Authority 
President] Abbas legitimacy [after January 9, the date Hamas 
contends Abbas' term ends.]  In Fatah news, all dailies reported on 
the successful completion of preparations for the sixth general 
party conference to be held by the end of the year. 
 
Saturday, October 18 
 
Scores of anti-separation barrier protesters were injured in the 
weekly protests in the West Bank communities of Bilin, Nalin, Al 
Ma'sara and Im Salmona, according to all front pages.  The coverage 
highlighted that Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets and stun 
granades at protestors. 
 
Al Quds led with the headline, "Announced last August 22 by Israeli 
newspapers, but largely unnoticed:  New Israeli plans put a freeze 
on East Jerusalem construction and development, while allowing for 
the continuation of drilling and digging activities in the Old City 
and underneath Al- Aqsa Mosque."  The story quoted Mohammad Al 
Qaymery, an engineer and city planner who filed a request to extend 
the period to appeal the Jerusalem municipality "Plan 2020," noting 
 
JERUSALEM 00001911  003 OF 003 
 
 
that it will make development in the Old City and East Jerusalem, 
"extremely complicated if not impossible because of unreasonably 
stringent rules and regulations."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Bilal Al Hasan opines in Al Quds under the title "Acre events: 
Omen for a third Palestinian intifada"(10/20): "If the impetus for 
the two Palestinian intifadas came from the Israeli-Arab conflict... 
then a [third] Palestinian intifada launched from within the state 
of Israel will be based on different issues... related to equality 
and racial discrimination... Lawyer Hasan Jabarin asks if Israel can 
be brought before a UN international court...  The answer is no, 
because Israel has not signed the Rome document authorizing the 
court... [Conflict between Arabs and the state of Israel] continues 
to grow in a new violent dimension, strengthened by Israeli 
intransigence and a growth in extremist political movements inside 
Israeli society.  The elements of confrontation are gathering 
together as dark clouds gather before a storm." 
 
¶2.  Regular columnist Talal Okal opines in Al Ayyam under the title, 
"Calm - a cost-benefit analysis" (10/20):  "Only the naive believe 
that the calm [in Gaza] served Palestinian interests, since Israel 
alone has benefited from it, [taking the opportunity to] escalate 
aggression against the West Bank... To date, Israel has refused to 
abide by its commitments under the calm agreement, specifically the 
lifting of all restrictions on the flow of goods into Gaza... For 
some time now we have been reading and hearing statements made by 
leaders of different [Palestinians] factions, including Hamas, 
indicating... the need to reconsider [renewing the calm]... 
extending the agreement should be based on new conditions and 
ensured guarantees."
