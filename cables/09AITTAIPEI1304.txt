¶1. (SBU) Summary: Per reftel request, AIT/T Econ Officer and FN 
visited Sum-Mit Co. and interviewed the President, Mr. Joseph G.L. 
Cheng.  Collected response shows the bona fides of the subject 
broker. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The company was established in 1989 and now has 10 
employees.  The reference, provided by Mr. Cheng, of the company's 
address and contact information is identical to that stated in the 
company's registration form from the database of the Bureau of 
Foreign Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The company serves as the sole agent in Taiwan for Philips 
and Essco, and as one of a few sales representatives for L3 systems. 
 The company focuses on marketing radar systems and other related 
satellite and communication systems for these companies. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sum-Mit's major customers for defense-related articles are 
military units and the National Space Program Office (NSPO).  It 
does not have customers outside of Taiwan. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Sum-Mit's mission is market promotion.  In other words, the 
company targets potential customers and introduces products for 
Philips or Essco to potential customers.   When customers request 
more details about a product or a price quote, Sum-Mit will contact 
Philips or Essco for the customer and provide a response.  When the 
order is placed, however, the customer will place the order directly 
with Philips or Essco.  Therefore, Sum-Mit is not involved in 
finalizing contracts and the goods are delivered directly to the 
customer after its arrival in Taiwan. 
 
¶6. (SBU) On some occasions, Mr. Cheng receives copies of contracts 
from Philips or Essco for future reference.  Mr. Cheng is the only 
person in his company who has access to the contract files. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The building in which Sum-Mit resides maintains a guard 
presence at the front desk.  Upon entry, each visitor must obtain an 
elevator key programmed to access a specific floor.  Sum-Mit does 
not maintain a warehouse facility, either on site or at another 
facility, and therefore does not maintain an inventory of products. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Sum-Mit maintains contracts with Philips and Essco for 
market-promotion services, which is renewed every two years.  In 
general, the commission Sum-Mit receives from these companies is 
approximately 2-3 percent of the trading value of the sales 
contracts that customers ultimately conclude with Philips and Essco. 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Neither AIT nor its Taiwan law-enforcement sources has 
derogatory information in its files concerning Sum-Mit Co. or Mr. 
Cheng.
