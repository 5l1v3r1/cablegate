(S) On February 8, PolChief delivered subject demarche to 
Laura Kansikas-Debrais, Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit 
for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-proliferation. 
Kansikas-Debrais told PolChief that the GOF has no evidence 
of any contact between the Iranian entity Ghoods Aviation 
Industries and any Finnish firm.  However, she did note that 
she has become aware, through MTCR channels, that Ghoods has 
approached some MTCR Partner countries.  She assured us that 
if such contact were to occur, Finland's concern about the 
volatile situation in Iran would ensure deep suspicion toward 
any potential sale to Ghoods and an almost certain denial of 
export license from her office.
