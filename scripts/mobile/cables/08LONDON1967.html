(C) As reported ref a, HMG is currently engaged in cross-departmental discussion on its role in the NATO Training Mission - Iraq (NTM-I).  The discussions will continue throughout August and September, according to MOD Deputy Director for Iraq Joint Commitments Daniel Hughes, who is drafting proposals for his superiors to review "within the next few weeks."  One proposal he will advance, and for which he thinks there will be significant support in Whitehall, would have the UK assume the role of "Prime Coordinating Nation" (PCN) for military officer training within NTM-I. Hughes also said that the broad themes of his paper would be based on the assumption that the UK presence in Basra will draw down significantly sometime in 2009.  The UK will remain engaged on a bilateral basis in Basra in "niche areas," including military training, where the U.S. and Iraqis think most useful, and where UK resource limitations allow.  One example of this would be naval training in Um Qasr port.

Through NTM-I the UK would continue its officer training/staff college efforts. He noted the difficulties of implementing the courses through NTM-I rather than bilaterally but recognized the advantages outlined ref b in a sustained coalition approach. Hughes will therefore recommend to his superiors that the UK work to fix, rather than abandon, NTM-I.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX TUTTLE</p>
