Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) On November 27, Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos 
Restrepo briefed Ambassador on developments in the peace 
process with the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia 
(AUC): 
 
-- Bananero Bloc: demobilization is complete.  Thirty-seven 
are implicated in major crimes and will stay in the 
demobilization zone. The rest will report to the reinsertion 
center in Turbo. 
 
-- Catatumbo Bloc: next to demobilize.  The Army has devoted 
a counterguerrilla battalion from Arauca to secure the area. 
 
-- Cordoba: Protests from cattle ranchers fearful of FARC 
retaliation forced Restrepo to halt demobilization.  He is 
concerned but working with the military to secure the area. 
 
-- Elmer Cardenas Bloc: the independent paramilitary group 
powerful in Choco and coastal Antioquia agreed not to invade 
former Bananero Bloc territory and proposed a peace process 
with several conditions short of declaration of a cease-fire. 
 The Bloc commander claims the Marines are complicit in drug 
trafficking by illegal armed groups and independent 
traffickers in the area.  Restrepo believes trafficking is a 
growing problem along the border with Panama. 
 
-- Others: Small groups in Cundinamarca and southern 
Magdalena Departments will be completed this year.  Three 
blocs in Valle del Cauca and Cauca Departments are scheduled 
for early 2005.  Restrepo is concerned about drug traffickers 
taking over the territory. 
 
¶2. (C) Restrepo said the GOC will unilaterally release up to 
50 imprisoned FARC guerrillas to prove its commitment to 
securing the release of FARC hostages.  Restrepo advised the 
GOC to publicize its latest draft of the Law for Justice and 
Reparations but wait until March to present it formally to 
Congress.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Bananero Bloc Demobilization Completed 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Restrepo expressed satisfaction with the November 25 
demobilization of the Bananero Bloc in Turbo, Antioquia 
Deparment (ref A).  On November 29, the demobilized 
paramilitaries guilty only of membership in an illegal armed 
group will depart the demobilization zone and report to the 
reinsertion center.  There are 37, including Bloc Commander 
Ever Velosa ("Hernan Hernandez"), accused of serious crimes 
who will remain in the demobilization zone.  Restrepo is 
working with the Prosecutor General's Office ("Fiscalia") to 
bring investigators to the zone to interview the 
paramilitaries and process their cases.  The police and 
military increased their presence to secure the areas 
formerly controlled by the Bananero Bloc.  Even in the 
conflictive area of Nuevo Antioquia, police coverage 
prevented nearly all residents from fleeing the area in fear 
of guerrilla retaliation. 
 
------------------- 
Catatumbo Bloc Next 
------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) President Uribe authorized Restrepo to begin the 
demobilization of the Catatumbo Bloc in Norte de Santander 
Department on November 29.  It is the largest and most 
well-armed bloc to demobilize this year.  The 1,500 members 
have at least 900 weapons.  The Army will move a 
counterguerrilla battalion from Arauca Department to the 
areas formerly dominated by the Catatumbo Bloc, and Restrepo 
discussed with Counternarcotics Police Commander General 
Gomez the possibility of increasing aerial eradication. 
Ideally, Restrepo would like Navy patrols on the Catatumbo 
River and aerial coverage from the Air Force but neither 
service has identified resources to do so, although they know 
security must be improved.  The Presidential Council for 
Social Action is preparing social outreach and civic action 
projects. 
 
--------------- 
Cordoba Delayed 
--------------- 
¶5. (C) Restrepo tried to begin demobilizing parts of 
Mancuso's Northern Bloc in Cordoba Department but protests 
from local cattle ranchers forced him to stop.  They view the 
paramilitaries as necessary to their security and fear the 
security forces are not prepared to prevent the FARC from 
entering the area, especially on the coast where drug 
trafficking flourishes.  They threatened to take up arms if 
necessary.  The FARC have a presence in northern (Abibe 
mountain range), southern (Nudo de Paramillo) and eastern 
(Puerto Libano) Cordoba.  First Division Commander General 
Montoya, who has been named to lead a pilot inter-service 
unit for the Caribbean coast, will travel to Cordoba on 
November 30 to coordinate security.  Plans include using at 
least two helicopters, a counterguerrilla battalion, and a 
separate battalion on the coast. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Elmer Cardenas Bloc Still Skeptical 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) In mid-November Restrepo met with "Aleman," commander 
of the independent Elmer Cardenas Bloc (ECB), which operates 
in Choco and coastal Antioquia Departments, has 1,500 ) 
1,800 members, and is well-financed and organized.  Aleman 
agreed not to invade former Bananero Bloc territory and gave 
Restrepo an 11-point peace process proposal, which did not 
include a declaration of a cease-fire.  He claims, with some 
accuracy, that the ECB is in regular contact with the FARC, 
and therefore could not comply with a full cease-fire.  His 
conditions include a mutual cease-fire in exchange for an 
increased presence of security forces in nine specific areas, 
financial support for his troops, and negotiations on 
regional political issues.  Aleman has complained that some 
members of the Marines cooperate with drug traffickers. 
Restrepo asserted that the drug trafficking industry on the 
coast near Panama is growing quickly, and that the security 
forces do not appear to be well informed about the extent of 
the problem. 
 
------------------------------ 
Other Upcoming Demobilizations 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (C) Restrepo does not expect difficulties with two small 
demobilizations planned in Cundinamarca and southern 
Magdalena Departments later this year.  Demobilizing the 
paramilitary groups on the conflictive eastern plains 
("Llanos") continues to be problematic.  In early 2005, 
Restrepo plans to demobilize Hernan Hernandez's Calima Bloc, 
Diego Murillo's ("Don Berna") Pacific Bloc, and Pablo 
Sevillano's Liberators of the South in Valle del Cauca and 
Cauca Departments.  Restrepo is concerned about the Valle 
Cartel's ability to take over former paramilitary territory. 
He estimates there are at least 4,000 hectares of coca in the 
area.  Restrepo said the GOC will unilaterally release up to 
50 imprisoned FARC guerrillas to prove its commitment to 
securing the release of FARC hostages. 
 
------------------------------- 
Law for Justice and Reparations 
------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) The GOC revised its April version of the Law for 
Justice and Reparations to include some aspects of Senator 
Rafael Pardo's draft (ref B).  Restrepo advised President 
Uribe and the Minister of Interior and Justice to hold public 
debate on the draft and present it formally to Congress as 
urgent legislation when Congress re-convenes in March. 
Restrepo is concerned that there is not enough time left in 
this year's legislative session to get the bill passed.  He 
noted, however, that it was not his decision.  The Ambassador 
asserted that it was important to get a workable law passed 
as soon as possible.
