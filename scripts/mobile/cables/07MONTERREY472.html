¶1. (SBU)  During a private meeting on April 27, the Consul 
General asked Nuevo Leon Governor Natividad Gonzalez Paras about 
recent public statements made by the State Assistant Attorney 
General, Aldo Fasci Zuazua.  Without being solicited, Fasci told 
reporters on April 24 that photographic or video evidence may 
surface linking State and Federal Governments to organized 
crime, and that the public should disregard this evidence as a 
smear tactic on the part of drug cartels.  Public discussion 
ensued and focused on the question of why Fasci would make such 
a statement unless he already knew that the evidence existed. 
On April 25, State Attorney General Luis Carlos Trevino publicly 
recanted Fasci's statement and said that the Assistant Attorney 
General had not been speaking on behalf of the Nuevo Leon State 
Government. 
 
¶2. (S)  During the CG's meeting, Governor Gonzalez confided that 
he had seen "the video" to which Fasci was alluding.  During a 
recent drug cartel raid, the Nuevo Leon State Police had 
recovered a video hidden within a stash of money.  The Governor 
said that the video showed an unidentified man, wearing only a 
bloody undershirt and underwear, saying that Governor Gonzalez's 
Chief of Staff, Rogelio Cerda, was a corrupt official in the 
pockets of the drug cartels.  According to the Governor, the 
unidentified man also said that some of the highest ranking 
members of the Mexican government are on the narco-traffickers' 
payroll, and specifically mentioned Mexican Secretary of 
Defense, Gen. Guillermo Galvan, and Mexican President Felipe 
Calderon.  Governor Gonzalez stated that the unidentified man 
making these allegations appeared calm, with his legs casually 
crossed, and so the Governor thought that the videotape was 
"staged."  When asked where the tape was, Governor Gonzalez said 
that he had shown it to President Calderon in Mexico City and 
that the President had immediately called Attorney General 
Rafael Macedo de la Concha and told him to launch an 
investigation. 
 
¶3.  (S)  COMMENT.  Unfortunately, without seeing the alleged 
videotape, it is difficult to ascertain the validity of the 
Governor's statements, particularly about it being "staged" 
because the video clearly was not meant to be found in a stash 
of money in a narco safe house.  While Post law enforcement 
officials have long believed that certain individuals in 
Governor Gonzalez's cabinet are corrupt, including Chief of 
Staff Rogelio Cerda and Secretary of Public Security Antonio 
Garza, without knowing the identity of the man in the videotape, 
it is difficult to determine the weight his allegations should 
be given.  Governor Gonzalez has indicated his strong 
willingness to fight corruption and narco-violence in the State, 
and is pushing for the establishment of a vetted State Police 
unit, an endeavor Post feels would help mitigate the rising 
insecurity in Nuevo Leon.  Post will continue to maintain an 
open line of communication with Governor Gonzalez about this 
issue.  END COMMENT.
