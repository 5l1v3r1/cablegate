(C) PolOff met with Heidi Marttila, Finnish MFA Unit for Asia 
and Oceania on April 23.  Marttila reiterated the Government 
of Finland's (GOF) position that rewards should not be given 
for a deterioration in the status quo; GoF does not want to 
send the wrong message to the Burmese Government.  She noted 
that nothing has worked to improve conditions.  Marttila 
quoted the Special Envoy's conclusions that something new 
must be done, but noted that he is looking into what 
"something new" would be.   She said that the GoF agrees with 
holding dialogue.  She expressed concern that the opposition 
in Burma is divided between those who view the 2010 elections 
as a "little window of opportunity" and criticize sanctions 
and those in the opposition who view the elections as a 
"joke" and support strengthening sanctions.  (Note: GoF has 
no Embassy in Burma and operates through Bangkok.  Marttila 
pointed out that Burmese activist Ko Ko Thett resides in 
Helsinki where he works as an independent researcher. End 
Note.)
