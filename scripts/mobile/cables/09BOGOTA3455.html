<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>(C) On November 26, the Colombian National Police, with support of 
the DEA Bogota Country Office, arrested three individuals and were 
looking for a fourth in connection with the wiretaps scandal 
(reftel).  The four suspects were OswaldoVillamilTorralba, Ferney
Galvis Garcia, Aldo Francisco PerezYosa, and Edwin Nicolas Acuna 
Chitiva.AcunaChitiva remains at large.  The four are accused of 
using the legal wire intercept system known as Esperanza to 
illegally tap the phone of Supreme Court Auxiliary Magistrate Ivan 
Velazquez, who was leading the "parapolitica" investigation of ties 
between paramilitaries and the Colombian Congress.  Investigators 
believe that Villamil, a Colombia National Police (CNP) official 
who had worked in an Esperanza listening room, had conspired with 
his longtime neighbor Perez, an official at the National Technical 
Corps (CTI, the Prosecutor General's judicial police force), to 
intercept Velazquez' phone.  Villamil allegedly bribed CNP official 
Galvis to carry out the intercepts in the listening room.Galvis
had to involve his CNP supervisor, Acuna, in the process.  Galvis, 
Acuna, and Perez signed the official order that piggybacked 
Velazquez' number onto a wiretaps in a legitimate investigation.
Police investigators believed these arrests would unearth new 
information about the purpose of intercepts and who ordered them.
