<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>1.(C) In a February 26 meeting with Bahraini Minister of Justice Sheikh Khalid bin Ali al Khalifa, Treasury Undersecretary Stuart Levey asked if Bahrain intended to request the extradition from Qatar of Qatari national Khalifa al Subaie, who had been convicted by a Bahraini court on January 16 of financing terror and sentenced to serve six months in prison. The Justice Minister replied that that would be difficult since al Subaie is a Qatari national who is presently in Qatar. It is not customary for GCC states to extradite their nationals, unless there are explicit legal provisions in force allowing for that. Such was not the case between Bahrain and Qatar.
</p><p>2.(C) Sheikh Khalid stated that Bahrain, through its Ministry of the Interior, had officially notified the Government of Qatar of the judgment against al Subaie. He added that Bahrain was taking two additional actions with regard to the case: they had notified Interpol and would make a formal request of the Government of Qatar to execute the judgment against al Subaie in Qatar.
</p><p>3.(C) The Ambassador asked whether it was possible that the Government of Qatar lacked required information necessary to take further action on the case. Sheikh Khalid replied, "We have informed Qatar about the procedures. As a matter of knowledge, they know. We will make it a formal notification through the Ministry of Interior." The Ambassador has meetings scheduled this week and next with the Prosecutor General and Ministry of Interior to follow up on this issue.
</p><p>4.(S) The Minister of Justice was receptive to Undersecretary Levey's proposal to seek UNSCR 1267 designations for convicted al Qaeda financiers al Subaie, Jaffar Ali and Abdul Khaliq. He readily agreed to work with Treasury, State and the Bahraini Foreign Ministry on the modalities necessary to make this happen. 5.(U) Undersecretary Levey cleared this message. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI</p>
