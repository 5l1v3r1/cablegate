¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Swindells recently met with NZ 
Foreign Minister Phil Goff to discuss the latter's visit to 
Washington.  Goff painted an upbeat message about his recent 
U.S. visit, but obviously had heard Washington's tougher 
message regarding the negative effect of New Zealand's 
policies on its prospects for an FTA.  Goff's unacceptable 
response -- that New Zealand is happy working around the 
edges of the status quo -- was considerably more inflexible 
than the Prime Minister's words on the issue (ref B ).  This 
may reflect 1) Goff's own feelings regarding the importance 
of the nuclear ban; 2) the refusal of National Party leader 
Don Brash to admit during a weekend news interview that he 
favors ending the ban; 3) the consensus of the Cabinet, which 
met on June 13, that the ban must stay; or some combination 
of the three.  Whatever the reason, we appreciate 
Washington's consistent message to Goff and will continue to 
work quietly on a strategy for an improved U.S.- New Zealand 
dialogue during the weeks or months before New Zealand's 
general election . END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) Ambassador Swindells met on June 13 with Foreign 
Minister Phil Goff to discuss the latter's recent visit to 
the United States and Canada.  Goff was enthusiastic about 
his meetings in Washington, which he said had offered him a 
chance to meet with newly-appointed officials whose 
responsibilities include New Zealand.  He appreciated the 
chance to talk with his counterparts about a wide range of 
issues, including China, Indonesia, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 
------------------------ 
Still Bucking for an FTA 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (C) Goff had obviously heard loud and clear in his 
meetings that New Zealand will not be able to begin FTA 
negotiations with the United States at this time.  In 
describing his FTA-related Washington conversations to the 
Ambassador, the Minister nevertheless put a positive spin on 
New Zealand's prospects for an eventual agreement.  While 
acknowledging that Deputy Secretary Zoellick had cautioned 
that CAFTA must first get through Congress and the United 
States must follow through on negotiations with countries 
already in the queue, Goff stressed that Congress seemed 
positive regarding a possible trade deal with New Zealand. 
Furthermore, he noted that the Deputy Secretary had said that 
USTR Portman would take the lead on any US-NZ FTA.  The 
latter is a good friend to New Zealand, Goff said.  He added 
that the Deputy Secretary had not said anything to indicate 
he would oppose a trade deal. 
 
¶4.  (C) We could not help but notice, however, that Goff was 
somewhat less exuberant about the prospects of an FTA in the 
near term than he had been after his last trip to Washington. 
 He no longer spoke of the growing numbers of members in the 
Friends of New Zealand caucus.   Instead, he only said that 
there seems to be an appreciation of New Zealand's position 
in Congress.  He also said for the first time that it is in 
the end the Administration's choice whether or not to pursue 
a trade deal.  (He did add that it seems NZ is in a better 
position for this than before.) 
 
¶5.  (C) Goff admitted things with CAFTA look difficult and it 
is likely it will take Congress until December to approve it. 
 The Ambassador said that the Administration would also need 
to get Congress to renew Trade Promotion Authority.  Goff 
said that New Zealand favored CAFTA as a way of assuring a 
stable, prosperous Central America and a means by which the 
United States could pass democratic values on to the region. 
For this reason, Ambassador Wood would promote CAFTA on the 
Hill, including with Friends of New Zealand Caucus co-chair 
Congresswoman Tauscher, who opposes the Central American deal. 
 
------------------ 
A Line in the Sand 
------------------ 
 
¶5.  (C) Goff also played down any message he had heard 
regarding Washington's continued concern over New Zealand's 
nuclear ban.  The only meeting in which he mentioned the 
issue had come up was his session with Acting Deputy 
Secretary of Defense England.  Even here, Goff said he had 
 
SIPDIS 
anticipated the Acting Deputy Secretary would raise the 
issue, and he had done so in the context of a broader, 
positive discussion.  DoD is pleased New Zealand is 
increasing its defense budget, Goff stressed. 
 
¶6.  (C) The Ambassador then described his own recent trip to 
Washington.  He had heard nothing but positive things about 
New Zealand, he said, but also a lot of questions about how 
we could raise the level of bilateral cooperation.  Because 
of all the challenges in the world, it is important to find 
flexibility.  As he had remarked to PM Clark during their 
meeting last week, the degree to which we can do this can 
only be known if we keep talking.  We should do this sooner 
rather than latter, the Ambassador said.  Goff said he 
appreciated the Ambassador's wish to move the relationship 
forward, and assured him that the PM and he shared this wish. 
 It makes not sense not to do so, when, for example, we are 
cooperating so much in Operation Enduring Freedom.  It is 
strange not to conduct military exercises together when we 
are fighting together. 
 
¶7.  (C) But, said Goff, like many small countries, New 
Zealand fiercely maintains its independent way of thinking. 
The Ambassador said he understood the country's sense of 
independence and individuality, but NZ officials might be 
surprised how much flexibility NZ could maintain and still 
address Washington's concerns.  Goff said flexibility is a 
good thing.  The Prime Minister has said that New Zealand 
cannot alter its legislation.  The key was therefore to try 
to move forward within this limitation.  There was no reason 
why any ship other than a carrier or sub could not come to 
New Zealand.  New Zealand has no need or desire for nuclear 
power, and Kiwis would not shift the anti-nuclear policy 
willingly.  In fact, Goff said, the harder they are pushed on 
this issue the more dug in they will become.  (Comment: The 
same can obviously be said about Minister Goff's own views on 
the legislation.  End Comment.) 
 
¶8.  (C) The Ambassador said that the issue nuclear propulsion 
was really the issue of America's naval presence in the 
region.  Japan, Taiwan, and Korea all want us here, he said. 
We need to discuss this.  Even if nothing changed, we'd know 
we had tried.  Goff said that New Zealand was happy living 
with the status quo but loosening it around the edges.  He 
stressed that the Government has said and will continue to 
say it wants the United States in the region.  In fact, Goff 
said that during his meetings he had encouraged U.S. 
officials to engage more, given China's "charm offensive" in 
Asia.  He said he hoped that Secretary Rice would attend the 
Asia Regional Forum meeting. 
 
¶9.  (C) Goff reiterated that his Government is keen to work 
together with the United States within the parameters of no 
change to the nuclear legislation.  He said that NZ officials 
feel in some sense that the initiative is with the United 
States, and added that New Zealand would respond positively 
to a non-nuclear U.S. ship visit if the United States Navy 
made this offer.   The PM's yearly blanket approval of C-17s 
has not been a problem. The question is how we can improve 
relations militarily and otherwise.  The Ambassador asked if 
this meant New Zealand officials would have an open mind and 
come to a meeting, which would be "under the radar."  Goff 
said that the Government could not do anything other than 
what it had committed to the electorate to do.  Any Labour 
attempt to repeal the legislation would be seen as a 
betrayal, he said.  Such a move would destroy the National 
Party as well, he said, as witnessed by National Party leader 
Don Brash's unwillingness to openly admit he supported ACT 
Party's Ken Shirley's members bill that would revise the ban. 
 (NB: The bill, which had been submitted months ago, has 
recently come up for inclusion on Parliament's calendar, 
probably late next month or early in August.) U.S. 
politicians would understand Labour's position, Goff added. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10.  (C) Comment: Goff's hard nosed approach after the PM's 
apparently more conciliatory message last week is striking. 
We suspect that because National's Brash has (understandably) 
refused to make this an election issue, Labour feels 
emboldened to harden its line.  That being said, the wind is 
going out of the Government's sails on the FTA and it is 
obvious that they are reacting to a harder message from 
Washington.  Their probing for a ship visit while still 
refusing to even discuss the ban is an indication that they'd 
like to have their cake and eat it too.  We thank Washington 
officials for their unified message to New Zealand 
counterparts, and continue to believe that -- after elections 
-- the Government may be willing to come to a dialogue if 
they know they need to.  If they don't, calling them publicly 
into account would be appropriate on our part.  End Comment.
