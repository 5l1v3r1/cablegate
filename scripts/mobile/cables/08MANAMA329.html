<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>1.(C) Minister of Oil and Gas Affairs Dr. Abdul Hussein Ali Mirza May 26 confirmed to Econoff local press reports quoting his statement that a Bahraini delegation would travel to Tehran that day to continue negotiations that could lead to a deal for Iran to sell Bahrain natural gas.
</p><p>2.(C) Mirza confirmed again that he was aware of deep U.S.G. concern over a potential deal. He asserted that the delegation's negotiations in Tehran this week were a previously-scheduled continuation of talks that had begun several months ago (refs A and B). He said the current round of talks did not reflect a new breakthrough. (Note: The joint Bahraini-Iranian committee currently conducting negotiations was established in August 2007 and held its first meeting the following month (ref B). The parties agreed at the time that the committee would meet monthly, with venues alternating between Manama and Tehran. Bahrain will host the June meeting. End Note.)
