¶1. (U) This is an action request -- please see Paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (U) Post on August 29 delivered reftel demarche to the New 
Zealand Agency for International Development, which handles 
issues related to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
 
¶3. (C) On September 2, a representative of New Zealand's 
Treasury noted Zimbabwe's decision to pay back US $120 
million of the US $290 million it owes the Fund.  The 
representative asked whether the U.S. government would now 
consider Zimbabwe to be in compliance with its IMF 
obligations, or whether the United States still believes 
Zimbabwe should be expelled from the Fund.  Post seeks 
Department guidance on how it should respond to these 
questions.  Post also notes that the Treasury representative 
is due to deliver a recommendation on the issue to New 
Zealand's Finance Minister on September 5 and that a response 
by COB September 2 (Washington) would be very helpful.
