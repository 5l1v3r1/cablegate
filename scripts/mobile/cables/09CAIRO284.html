  		<h1>COURT FINES INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST FOR DEFAMING CONTROVERSIAL MP REF: A. CAIRO 180 B. CAIRO 70 C. 08 CAIRO 2405 D. 08 CAIRO 2280 E. 08 CAIRO 2198 F. 08 CAIRO 2001 Classified By: ECPO Counselor Catherine Hill-Herndon per 1.4 (d).1.(C) Summary and comment: On February 10, a court fined independent newspaper editor Yasser Barakat LE 40,000 (7,000 USD) for allegedly defaming controversial MP Mustafa Bakry in a series of 2007 and 2008 articles criticizing Bakry's GOE connections and business dealings. Human rights activists criticized the fine as harsh and commented that the court's decision continues a recent trend of fining, but not jailing, journalists in an attempt to silence the press. The GOE has been using this strategy to intimidate journalists, while aiming to avoid international criticism. The fine is lighter than many recent press case judgments, but could still be painful for a small independent paper. We do not believe the fine is heavy enough to jeopardize the newspaper's financial viability. Because Bakry is widely rumored to be a State Security confidante, the judgment has taken on a political dimension of the regime supporting "one of its own" against an independent journalist. End summary and comment.</h1>
