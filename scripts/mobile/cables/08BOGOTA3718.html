SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (U) The conflict between President Uribe and the Supreme 
Court spilled into the judiciary after the Superior Judicial 
Council (CSJ)--one of Colombia's four top courts--ordered the 
Supreme Court to delete all references to Social Protection 
Minister Diego Palacio from its ruling accepting the guilty 
plea of former Congresswoman Yidis Medina.  The Court 
refused, arguing its rulings are not subject to modification. 
 Colombia's Constitutional Court may now weigh in on the 
issue.  Constitutional Court magistrate Manuel Cepeda told us 
Uribe's allies packed the CSJ with party loyalists to use it 
to head off the Supreme Court's parapolitical investigations. 
 The judicial turf wars and charges of politicization are 
unlikely to end anytime soon, especially given the polarized 
political climate generated by the parapolitical 
investigations and a possible third term for President Uribe. 
 End Summary. 
 
TWO HIGH COURTS DISPUTE FACTS, JURISDICTION 
------------------------------------------- 
¶2.  (U) Colombia's Superior Judicial Council on October 1 
ruled that the Supreme Court should strike all references to 
Social Protection Minister Diego Palacio from the guilty plea 
of former Congresswoman Yidis Medina.  Medina pled guilty to 
bribery in June, alleging Palacio and other officials in 2004 
had arranged for plum jobs for her supporters in exchange for 
her vote to change the Constitution to allow Uribe's 2006 
re-election (reftel). 
 
¶3.  (U) Using a constitutional mechanism known as a "tutela" 
(guardian plea) Palacio protested the inclusion of his name 
in the conviction, contending it violated his right to a 
presumption of innocence.  The  Prosecutor General's Office 
(Fiscalia) is investigating Palacio and former Justice and 
Interior Minister Sabas Pretelt. The Council--one of 
Colombia's four high courts along with the Supreme Court, 
Constitutional Court, and State Council--ruled that the 
Supreme Court's wording took Palacio's involvement as a 
proven fact, not an unproven allegation.  The Council noted 
this could prejudice Palacio's right to due process and a 
fair trial, though the body also stressed its ruling had no 
bearing on the Fiscalia's ongoing investigation. 
 
¶4.  (U) The Supreme Court responded that its rulings were 
"unchangeable," the Council's ruling "foolish," and suggested 
the Council was trying to distort the Court's motivations.  A 
Supreme Court statement noting that it had not implied 
Palacio's guilt and "categorically" rejected efforts to 
interfere with its investigations.  Further muddying the 
waters, Inspector General (Procurador) Edgardo Maya on 
October 2 asked the Constitutional Court to annul Medina's 
conviction on the grounds that bribery requires at least two 
parties.  The absence of a conviction against someone for 
bribing Medina implied her innocence. 
 
AND A THIRD HIGH COURT MIGHT FAIL TO RESOLVE 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶5.  (C) The "train wreck" between competing high courts will 
likely move to the Constitutional Court.  The Constitutional 
Court has the final word on constitutional matters, but has 
been involved in its own jurisdictional battles with the 
Supreme Court.  Constitutional Court Magistrate Manuel Cepeda 
told us he was unsure if/when his body would rule on the 
matter, as six of its nine members are due to be replaced by 
March 1, 2009.  Still, he said President Uribe and his 
Congressional allies, under pressure due to the parapolitical 
investigations, packed the Superior Council with party 
loyalists rather than judicial experts.  He voiced concern 
that the same would happen with the Constitutional Court. 
President Uribe, the Supreme Court, and the CSJ will each 
name two candidates to fill the six vacancies that must be 
filled by March 1, 20009. 
 
¶6.  (C) Cepeda said the Supreme Court recently altered its 
position on hearing tutelas in an effort to block the CSJ 
from receiving more tutelas challenging Supreme Court 
rulings.  Still, it is unclear if the Council will accept the 
Supreme Court ruling.  Council Magistrate Angelino Lizcano--a 
staunch Uribe ally and former Secretary General of the House 
of Representatives--told us the Council acted in response to 
"questionable and political" Supreme Court rulings.  Lizcano 
noted that numerous media reports had detailed suspect ties 
between Supreme Court magistrates and known narco influences. 
 The problem, Lizcano added, is that individual cases have 
become hostage to the Uribe-Court and intra-Court 
battles--with all sides accusing the other of "politicizing" 
the cases and rulings. 
 
¶7. (C)  The battles among the various courts could affect a 
possible third term for President Uribe, since a third term 
referendum to amend the constitution (now in Congress) must 
be approved by the Constitutional Court.  In 2005, the 
Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of the 
amendment allowing a second Uribe term, but it said an 
amendment to permit a third term would violate the 
Constitution's essence and would be unconstitutional. 
Constitutional Court Magistrate and former Uribe legal 
advisor Mauricio Gonzalez told us the current Court would 
likely not approve a third term, but he expects the new Court 
members to be more friendly to Uribe.  He predicted that the 
judicial turf battles and charges of politicization are not 
likely to end anytime soon.
