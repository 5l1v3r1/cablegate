¶1. (U)  PolOff asked Veikko Soralahti, Counselor, Unit for 
Latin America and the Caribbean at the Finnish MFA on January 
8 if there had been any changes in the Finnish relationship 
with Cuba since the EU dropped sanctions.  He said that there 
had not. 
 
¶2. (C) Post provides the following responses to reftel A 
questions: 
 
- Has the host country, in Post's opinion, worked to promote 
the advancement of democracy and human rights in Cuba? 
 
Soralahti reiterated the Government of Finland (GoF) interest 
in promotion and advancement of democracy and human rights in 
Cuba and believes that this can be done via an EU 
relationship with Cuba.  The GoF works on promoting human 
rights and democracy in Cuba by supporting common EU 
positions and statements. 
 
--------- 
 
- Has the host country made public statements or undertaken 
other governmental actions, such as resolutions in the 
national assemblies condemning human rights abuses in Cuba; 
or actions in support of civil society in Cuba through host 
country's diplomatic missions or other fora. 
 
The GoF has no Embassy in Cuba.  The GoF works in concert 
with the EU on Cuban human rights and civil society issues. 
 
--------- 
 
- Have there been any high-level diplomatic visits between 
Cuba and the host country in the past six months? 
 
An official human rights delegation from Cuba visited Finland 
and Norway approximately two months ago. 
 
--------- 
 
- Did the host country offer or deliver humanitarian or other 
assistance to the Cuban people in the wake of the 
major damage caused by Hurricanes Gustav (August 30) and Ike 
(September 8)? 
 
GoF contributed to disaster relief through general Caribbean 
earmarks processed via multilateral organizations. 
 
--------- 
 
- What is the nature of investments (and names, if known) 
that host country businesses have in Cuba?  What host 
country businesses participated in the Havana Trade Fair 
(November 3)? 
 
Major Finnish companies such as Wartsila and Nokia have 
investments and sell products and services in Cuba. 
However, we have no information to suggest that these 
businesses have trafficked or that they have any intention 
to traffic in confiscated Cuban properties.  Post was unable 
to determine if any businesses participated in 
the Havana Trade Fair. 
 
--------- 
 
- Are there any bilateral trade agreements or other 
cooperative agreements between host country and Cuba? 
 
GoF does not have bilateral trade agreements with Cuba.  GoF 
works through the EU delegation on trade and 
cooperation issues. 
 
--------- 
 
- Are there any exchange programs between host country and 
Cuba, including but not limited to: scholarships for host 
country nationals to study in Cuba; Cuban-paid medical travel 
for host country nationals; and Cuban doctors 
working in host country? 
 
Post knows of no significant government-funded exchange 
programs. Generally, Cubans in Finland are in Finland as a 
result of economic or family-based immigration and not as 
part of a Cuban or Finnish Government funded program.
