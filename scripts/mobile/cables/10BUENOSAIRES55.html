</p><p>Summary 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶1.  (C) In a January 26 meeting with the Ambassador and DCM, 
</p><p>Economy Minister Amado Boudou emphasized the positive despite the 
</p><p>many challenges he faces.  Confident and composed despite the late 
</p><p>hour of the meeting and the severe political pressure he has faced 
</p><p>in the past month, Boudou insisted that the GOA's plans to reengage 
</p><p>international markets are moving ahead, and that the plan to use 
</p><p>Central Bank reserves to guarantee 2010 debt service payments (the 
</p><p>controversial Fondo Bicentenario) would be implemented. 
</p><p>Frustrated with the imbroglio surrounding the leadership of the 
</p><p>Central Bank, Boudou said that the situation ""would be resolved 
</p><p>this week.""  While claiming that the proposed debt restructuring 
</p><p>would move ahead, Boudou asked that the Embassy convey to the U.S. 
</p><p>Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the importance of speed 
</p><p>and flexibility in its review of the GOA's submissions for 
</p><p>regulatory approval of the debt swap.  Boudou agreed to work with 
</p><p>the Embassy to manage the GOA reaction to the upcoming publication 
</p><p>of the Investment Climate Statement, which might contain language 
</p><p>critical of aspects of Argentina's investment climate.  Finally, on 
</p><p>ICSID, Boudou was non-committal, listening approvingly to the DCM's 
</p><p>discussion of the importance of the GOA's efforts to reach an 
</p><p>agreement with Azurix, but without pledging to move ahead on other 
</p><p>ICSID cases.  End Summary. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Boudou to Redrado: ""You're Fired"" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (C) On the issue of the leadership of the Central Bank (BCRA), 
</p><p>Boudou expressed frustration that the situation has dragged on for 
</p><p>so long, lamenting that ""we've wasted the whole month on this.""  He 
</p><p>vowed that the saga would end soon and that the status of (former) 
</p><p>BCRA President Martin Redrado will ""be resolved this week.""  Saying 
</p><p>that Redrado no longer has the luxury of resigning, Boudou stated 
</p><p>emphatically that ""we're firing him.""  He emphasized that the GOA 
</p><p>now considers former BCRA Vice President Pesce to be the head of 
</p><p>the Bank.  Boudou backed away from his comments earlier this month 
</p><p>that Mario Blejer would succeed Redrado as BCRA head.  He said that 
</p><p>he met with him two weeks ago, but Blejer, an experienced and 
</p><p>respected economic figure (and former BCRA head), is wary of being 
</p><p>involved in this controversial and unpredictable situation. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Holdout Proposal 
</p><p> 
</p><p>----------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (C) Boudou argued that the controversy regarding the BCRA is 
</p><p>unrelated to progress on the proposed debt restructuring proposal, 
</p><p> 
</p><p>BUENOS AIR 00000055  002 OF 003 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>which the GOA is now working hard to get through the international 
</p><p>regulatory approval process.  Quick SEC approval is vital, he said, 
</p><p>since regulatory agencies in Italy and Germany will only act after 
</p><p>the SEC issues its findings with regard to the debt swap.  The SEC 
</p><p>is working along three separate tracks, reviewing current economic 
</p><p>developments in Argentina, examining the technical aspects of the 
</p><p>proposed agreement, and developing a set of ""warnings"" to potential 
</p><p>investors regarding the risks (as is usual practice in developing 
</p><p>the prospectus for a securities issuance).  Boudou explained that 
</p><p>the SEC has asked for clarifications from the GOA in several areas 
</p><p>and that the GOA has done its best to respond as fully as possible. 
</p><p>However, he noted that the SEC needs to understand that the GOA is 
</p><p>not in a position to deal with controversial aspects of its 
</p><p>economic policies, such as the problems associated with the 
</p><p>government's statistics agency, INDEC.  Doing so would exact a huge 
</p><p>political price from the GOA, given the local media's aggressive 
</p><p>campaigns against the government.  Boudou acknowledged the 
</p><p>problematic nature of some GOA policies, but he opined that the SEC 
</p><p>should respond expeditiously and show some understanding of the 
</p><p>government's difficult political position so that the debt swap 
</p><p>could advance. He also noted that bondholders who are the GOA's 
</p><p>intended partners in this deal know Argentina's economic situation 
</p><p>well and don't need the SEC to spell it out for them.  In response, 
</p><p>the Ambassador and DCM pointed out that the SEC is an autonomous 
</p><p>regulatory agency which works independently of the executive 
</p><p>branch.  Boudou indicated that he understood that they could not do 
</p><p>anything beyond passing along the substance of his remarks. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Paris Club, ICSID 
</p><p> 
</p><p>---------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4.  (C) Despite the controversy surrounding the creation of the 
</p><p>Bicentennial Fund to use BCRA reserves to guarantee the payment of 
</p><p>debt service due in 2010, Boudou said that the GOA would proceed 
</p><p>with establishing the fund.  In addition, he also noted that the 
</p><p>government intends to normalize relations with the Paris Club, but 
</p><p>would not move seriously on that until after a debt swap deal with 
</p><p>the bondholder holdouts is completed.  On the issue of ICSID 
</p><p>judgments and the Azurix case in particular, the DCM explained that 
</p><p>the U.S. is encouraged by Argentina's engaging in negotiations to 
</p><p>reach an agreement with Azurix, and stressed the importance of 
</p><p>finalizing the deal so that Azurix would drop its petition to 
</p><p>remove GSP preferences from Argentine exports.  He added that the 
</p><p>GOA should build on this to address other ICSID cases as well. 
</p><p>Boudou listened attentively, but did not give a substantive 
</p><p>response on the issue. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Spending is Good for the Economy 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5.  (C) The Ambassador asked Boudou about the concerns of private 
</p><p>economic analysts regarding the increasing rate of government 
</p><p>expenditure growth, and noted the potential negative impact this 
</p><p> 
</p><p>BUENOS AIR 00000055  003 OF 003 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>could have on inflation.  Boudou responded by noting the long-term 
</p><p>success of the GOA's economic policies and defended the 
</p><p>counter-cyclical spending policies as necessary to promote economic 
</p><p>growth, adding half-jokingly that ""we're just following your 
</p><p>example.""  He said that the government would continue to spend on 
</p><p>public investment and employment, and added that it would 
</p><p>intelligently use the reserves in the Bicentennial Fund for the 
</p><p>benefit of the Argentine people. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Investment Climate Statement Release 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6.  (C) The Ambassador noted that the Investment Climate Statement 
</p><p>(ICS) would be issued in the coming weeks, and hoped that the 
</p><p>Embassy and the GOA would work together to minimize any negative 
</p><p>reactions from the government that could complicate the bilateral 
</p><p>relationship.  Boudou noted that the Argentine press has a tendency 
</p><p>to exaggerate and sometimes forces the government to respond more 
</p><p>harshly to perceived slights than warranted.  However, he agreed 
</p><p>that the GOA and the Embassy should work together to prepare for 
</p><p>the release of the document and contain any negative fallout. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Comment 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7.  (C) Boudou has been under tremendous political pressure this 
</p><p>past month, since the imbroglio over the Bicentennial Fund and the 
</p><p>leadership of the BCRA began.  Press rumors are rampant that his 
</p><p>position as Economy Minister is imperiled by the Kirchners' 
</p><p>dissatisfaction over his handling of the Redrado affair.  But 
</p><p>Boudou did not behave like a man whose career is hanging by a 
</p><p>thread.  The meeting occurred in the evening after being delayed 
</p><p>several times due to Boudou's appearance before the Congressional 
</p><p>committee investigating the Redrado situation.  He was then 
</p><p>convoked to the President's office.  Despite the lateness of the 
</p><p>hour and his marathon grilling before the committee (and perhaps in 
</p><p>the Casa Rosada as well), Boudou was fresh, enthusiastic, calm, and 
</p><p>totally composed during the meeting.  He appears committed to 
</p><p>completing the debt swap and then moving forward on dealing with 
</p><p>the Paris Club debt.  Whether he gets the chance to see these 
</p><p>things through depends ultimately on his future standing with CFK 
</p><p>and her husband.  As the sacking January 27 of Osvaldo Guglielmino, 
</p><p>the Attorney General in the Treasury suggests, the standing of 
</p><p>senior government officials in the eyes of the Kirchners, always 
</p><p>tenuous even in the best of times, can change very quickly in the 
</p><p>current environment.
