Pres-Elect Martinelli's Cabinet Takes Shape 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) Four days after his May 3 landslide electoral victory, 
Panamanian President-elect Ricardo Martinelli has made 
significant progress naming his cabinet.  On the evening of 
May 6, Panama's Electoral Tribunal (TE) formally declared 
Martinelli the victor in the May 3 after analyzing every vote 
tally sheet.  His "Alliance for Change" (Alianza por el 
Cambio) coalition also took 42 of 71 National Assembly seats, 
guaranteeing it a wide majority with a few seats still to be 
assigned.  As of the morning of May 7, post believes that the 
following members of his complex four-party alliance have 
been tapped for ministerial positions in the Martinelli 
Administration: 
 
-- Minister of Foreign Affairs:  VP Juan Carlos Varela; 
-- Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs: Meliton Arocha; 
-- Minister of Government and Justice: Anibel Galindo; 
-- Minister of the Canal: Romulo de Roux; 
-- Minister of Industry and Commerce: Roberto Henriquez; 
-- Minister of Public Works: Ricardo Quijano; 
-- Minister of Social Development: Guillermo Ferrufino; 
-- Minister of Housing: Carlos DuBois; 
-- Minister of Economy and Finance: Alberto Vallarino; 
-- Vice Minister of Economy and Finance: Frank De Lima; 
-- Director of the National Police: Gustavo Perez; 
-- Director of Immigration: Maria Cristina Gonzalez.

¶2.  (C)  Martinelli has moved quickly to designate the most 
important positions, which bodes well for his ability to 
prepare a smooth transition of power. Post does not expect a 
formal presentation of the full government until Tuesday, May 
12, but we are already reaching out to those whose 
appointment we have confirmed to brief them on key aspects of 
the bilateral relationship.
