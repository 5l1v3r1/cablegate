¶1. (C) Summary:  In a cordial meeting with presidential 
candidate Rafael Correa on October 26, the Ambassador 
underscored USG impartiality in the upcoming November 26 
election and commitment to a fair and transparent electoral 
process.  She said we will seek to pursue areas of 
convergence with the next government, whoever is elected. 
Correa responded favorably, taking pains to signal openness 
to continued security cooperation against transnational 
threats, and downplayed points of potential bilateral 
contention.  In alleging widespread fraud in the first round, 
he focused his complaints against Ecuadorian electoral 
authorities, and not the OAS. Correa clearly saw the meeting, 
which we requested, as useful to his efforts to re-position 
himself as more moderate in the second round, and invited 
press to photograph the opening of the meeting. He welcomed 
the Administration's backing of ATPDEA renewal for Ecuador 
but privately and later publicly reiterated his opposition to 
a FTA. The Ambassador also has a pending meeting with 
presidential front-runner Alvaro Noboa. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The meeting was arranged at the Ambassador's 
request, but the venue and publicity were selected by Correa. 
 It follows a similar but more private encounter during the 
run-up to the first round of presidential voting on October 
15, in which Correa placed second to Alvaro Noboa.  A similar 
request is pending with Noboa, to continue the Ambassador's 
ongoing private dialogue with him.  
</p><p>This meeting took place, at Correa's suggestion, in a private suite in a Quito hotel. 
The Ambassador was accompanied by the DCM.  Correa was joined 
by his running mate, Lenin Moreno, and Vinicio Alvorado 
Espinel, whom he introduced as his campaign manager and 
director of communications, apparently a new member of the 
team (Alvorado's business card indicates he is president and 
creative director for "Creacional," a PR firm with offices in 
Quito and Guayaquil).  Correa requested the Ambassador's 
permission to admit the press for a photo-op; she consented 
and press coverage was widespread.  During the photo session, 
Correa joked to the press, "look at the communist/terrorist, 
meeting with the American Ambassador." 
 
Areas of Convergence Welcomed 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) Correa welcomed the Ambassador's overture to finding 
areas of mutual interest with a potential Correa government. 
On economics, he agreed that competitiveness reforms and 
anti-trust laws were potential areas of convergence.  The 
U.S. anti-trust law is a model for the world, he said--no 
modern, market economy could function without similar 
constraints.  He rejected the characterization of his 
programs to generate employment and production as statist, 
with the exception of Petroecuador, which he would 
"incorporate but retain 100% state control with no private 
investment." He discussed increasing investments in 
agricultural modernization, microcredit and education. His 
overarching development goal, he said, lapsing into English, 
is to create a "huge middle class" in Ecuador.  When asked 
what would be his most important economic reform, he focused 
on ending collusion within the banking sector.  He said he 
was pro-trade, but reiterated his belief that Ecuador was 
"not ready" for a FTA with the U.S. and lamented the 
constraints on macro-economic policy of dollarization. 
 
¶4. (C) Correa strongly signaled his commitment to collaborate 
in the fight against narco-trafficking under a Correa 
government.  Asked by the DCM if he would be open to 
extradition of Ecuadorian narcos to the U.S., Correa said he 
saw no reason not to (comment:  apparently unaware of the 
current constitutional bar on extradition of Ecuadorian 
nationals). Correa seemed unaware of the challenges to USG 
interdiction efforts caused by Ecuador's 200-mile sovereign 
claim in the maritime sector. We chose not to raise access to 
the Manta base, nor did he. 
 
¶4.  (C) Correa, ever the economist, at one point suggested 
the U.S. might legalize drugs to correct the illegal market 
dynamics (Moreno reacted strongly against this--citing the 
social costs of drug use, including alcoholism). 
 
¶5.  (C) Correa said he would maintain the current level of 
8,000 troops on the northern border with Colombia, but would 
seek compensation for Ecuador's costs.  Ideally, he said, an 
international force could help secure Colombia's side of the 
border, but he recognized that was an unlikely and difficult 
proposition.  He would have "zero tolerance" for the presence 
of any illegal armed groups in Ecuador, or incursions by the 
Colombian military, for that matter.  On the issue of the 
FARC specifically, he confessed that "I'm just a middle class 
guy. If I call the FARC terrorists and lose the election, who 
is going to protect me and my family (from them)?" 
 
¶6.  (C) Asked which political reform he would prioritize, 
Correa said voting by district, "just like in the U.S."  To 
do so, a referendum on a constituent assembly was 
unavoidable.  Asked how he felt about the appropriate role of 
the military in the economy, Correa said "none, but what they 
do have is actually minimal." 
 
¶7.  (C) Correa had much to say about the dirty campaign to 
discredit him, ascribing blame mainly to Leon Febres Cordero 
and also to his opponent, Noboa, whom he closely associated 
with Febres Cordero.  He lamented that his campaign could not 
match the resources Noboa had access to, and called for the 
TSE, OAS, and international community to speak out against 
 
SIPDIS 
campaign overspending and impunity demonstrated by the Noboa 
campaign. 
 
¶9.  (C) Correa spoke at length about fraud in the first round 
of voting, but blamed Ecuadorian election authorities, not 
the OAS, for the failures to detect the fraud.  As examples 
he said some PAIS poll watchers were paid to leave the 
polling stations early on election day; votes were bought; 
and whole voting boxes were substituted.  Fraud was most 
rampant in the Amazon region, Manabi province and the eastern 
Sierra region.  He contended that some towns in the Amazon 
and in Manabi, (including where Moreno's family lives in the 
Amazon), reported 100% of the votes for Gutierrez or Noboa, 
which was just not credible in his view.  The Ambassador 
urged Correa to share any evidence of fraud with the OAS. 
Correa said the OAS had great credibility, but worried that 
fraud was just as likely to occur in the second round.  To 
monitor and prevent fraud would have required 10,000 PAIS 
observers, and we had 3,000, he said.  The lack of a quick 
count for the second round would make it easier to commit 
fraud, he asserted.  Though he needed to focus on the 
campaign, he would dispute fraudulent results strongly if and 
when they occurred. 
 
Correa Makes Hay 
---------------- 
 
¶10.  (U) After the meeting, Correa told the press that he 
insisted to the Ambassador he would not enter into an FTA 
agreement with the U.S. as currently negotiated.  He said he 
continued to press for ATPDEA renewal, which Ecuador deserved 
for its continued cooperation against narco-trafficking. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶11.  (C) Correa appeared tired and his earlier infectious 
sense of confidence seemed dimmed by misfortune in the first 
round of voting.  Nevertheless, his tone was good humored, 
and never shrill.  We sensed that he realizes that his best 
chance may have passed, but he is by no means giving up the 
fight.  He clearly sought to emphasize common ground during 
the conversation, speaking repeatedly about his very positive 
regard for the American people and rejecting as ludicrous the 
labels of communist, etc. that have been used against him. He 
twice apologized for the comment he had made about President 
Bush, saying that while he thought it was amusing, it was 
inappropriate and he regretted having said it. His invitation 
to the press and later remarks were clearly an attempt to 
moderate his image and to appeal to more centrist voters.
