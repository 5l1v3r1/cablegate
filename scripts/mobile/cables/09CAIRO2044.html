<br>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: UNGA THIRD COMMITTEE PRIORITIES 
<br> 
<br>REF: STATE 109397 
<br> 
<br></pre></p></div><p>1.(C) On October 26, we delivered reftel points to MFA Deputy Director for Human Rights Omar Shalaby. Shalaby doubted that postponing the defamation of religions resolution would be effective in light of U.S. and EU conceptual opposition to the resolution. He said the MFA would not instruct its New York mission to urge the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to postpone the resolution, but that the New York mission would be open to discussing potential changes to the text. He assessed that if the U.S. and the EU accepted the defamation of religions concept, there could be discussions in New York on a resolution text on the basis of religious stereotyping language adopted in the 2009 UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) freedom of expression (FoE) resolution. Shalaby noted that the MFA was troubled by recent USG testimony to Congress criticizing Egypt's human rights record in the context of comments on the FoE resolution.
</p><p>2.(C) Shalaby made the following responses to the other demarche items: -- No-Action Motions: Egypt would be ready to support no-action motions in the context of the GOE's "principled opposition" to country-specific resolutions. -- Country-Specific Resolutions: Egypt would most probably oppose the resolutions on Iran, Burma and the DPRK due to its principled opposition policy. The MFA told the Canadian Ambassador that Egypt would review Canada's Iran resolution. -- Elections Resolution: Egypt would consider supporting this U.S.-sponsored resolution. Shalaby asked for a copy of the text.
</p><p>3.(C) Shalaby asked for the U.S. to support the GOE position that the Mexican-sponsored resolution on human rights and counterterrorism should not refer in any way to UNHRC Special Rapporteur Scheinin's report. He urged the U.S. to advocate on Egypt's behalf with Mexico. Shalaby stressed that the GOE "deeply regrets" Scheinin's report, specifically its references to GOE actions against homosexuals. Shalaby underlined the GOE view that such references are outside Scheinin's mandate. Shalaby said that Egypt will break consensus on any resolution referring to Scheinin's report.
</p><p>4.(C) Shalaby criticized U.S. opposition to the October 16 UNHRC Goldstone resolution as undermining U.S. credibility on human rights. He asked for the U.S. not to oppose the Non-Aligned Movement UNGA resolutions on the right to development and unilateral coercive measures, which Egypt will present. Scobey</p>
