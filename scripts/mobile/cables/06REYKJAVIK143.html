¶1. (C)  Post presented ref A points to Icelandic MFA Acting 
Political Director Thordur Bjarni Gudjonsson April 24. 
Gudjonsson stated that Reykjavik has not adopted a formal 
position on the U.S.-UK proposal for a NATO "Global 
Partnership," adding that: 
 
-- In principle, cooperation with NATO should be open to any 
like-minded country. 
-- Iceland supports efforts to make partnership with NATO 
more "interesting" for potential partners. 
 
¶2. (C) Poloff noted ref B report that Iceland thought 
"international" a more appropriate term than "global" for the 
partnership, and Gudjonsson remarked that Iceland, while it 
agrees with the U.S. and UK on substance, might have some 
issues with our packaging.  He did not elaborate. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment:  Judging by Gudjonsson's comments and his 
government's current focus on homeland air defense, Iceland 
will not make "Global Partnership" a foreign policy priority. 
 The GOI's consistent support for Alliance engagement with 
other countries bodes well for Icelandic cooperation as we 
try to realize U.S.-UK goals.  On the other hand, the 
'international versus global' semantic issue bespeaks 
Icelandic concern, with Naval Air Station Keflavik soon to 
close, that NATO not ignore core Euro-Atlantic security 
issues in its pursuit of global ambitions.  End comment.
