¶1.  (C)  In a February 29 meeting with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) Europe Division Director, 
George Kroup, and Europe Policy Officer Kate Russell, 
Pol/Econ Counselor outlined planning for an upcoming donors 
conference regarding Kosovo, provided the needs table 
included in reftel A, and encouraged the GNZ to respond 
positively to an invitation to the conference.  Kroup 
reminded Pol/Econ Counselor that the GNZ's stance towards 
Kosovo remains tentative.  He referred to an earlier exchange 
between DCM and MFAT Deputy Secretary Hamilton (Reftel B), 
adding that the paper on Kosovo is with the Prime Minister. 
Any decision regarding possible assistance to Kosovo would 
emanate from the PM's office, Kroup noted, adding that he 
does not know how long that might take.  Pol/Econ Counselor 
asked if the GNZ would consider sending an official from 
their EU mission Brussels to observe in June.  Kroup 
demurred, saying it was possible that New Zealand may not be 
present. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Comment:  The issue of Kosovo's independence is 
sensitive enough that direction from the Prime Minister's 
office will be necessary before MFAT can make any decisions 
regarding related issues surrounding Kosovo.  Even an 
observer at a donor meeting could be perceived as tacit 
endorsement of Kosovo's independent status.  MFAT officials 
have promised to keep the Embassy apprised of any 
developments.
