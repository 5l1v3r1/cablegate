</p><p>Summary and Introduction 
</p><p>------------------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶1. (C) This cable takes an in-depth look at President Nestor 
</p><p>Kirchner's closest advisors.  It is based on interviews with 
</p><p>the Ambassador, DCM, and other Embassy Officers who have met 
</p><p>with members of Kirchner's inner circle, numerous discussions 
</p><p>with Embassy contacts in the Argentine political 
</p><p>establishment, as well as biographies and press articles 
</p><p>written about Kirchner's key associates.  The goal is to 
</p><p>provide Washington with a better understanding of the 
</p><p>individuals with the most influence over President Kirchner. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (C) Since coming to office in May 2003, President Kirchner 
</p><p>has largely relied on a handful of individuals -- most of 
</p><p>whom he brought with him from Santa Cruz province -- to help 
</p><p>him make his most important decisions.  Others outside of 
</p><p>this inner circle have an important role in advising Kirchner 
</p><p>on specific issues, such as Minister of the Economy Roberto 
</p><p>Lavagna on the debt exchange.  However, these individuals are 
</p><p>not part of Kirchner's circle of trust and are not included 
</p><p>in major policy discussions outside of their area of 
</p><p>expertise. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (C) Those identified by all sources as being in Kirchner's 
</p><p>inner circle are his wife Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner; 
</p><p>Secretary for Legal and Technical Affairs Carlos Zannini; 
</p><p> 
</p><p>SIPDIS 
</p><p>Santa Cruz Governor Sergio Acevedo; Minister of Federal 
</p><p>Planning, Public Infrastructure and Services Julio De Vido; 
</p><p>Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez; and Secretary General of the 
</p><p>Presidency Oscar Parrilli.  There are numerous other personal 
</p><p>confidants of Kirchner, such as Presidential Spokesman Miguel 
</p><p>Nunez, who have a long history of close friendship with 
</p><p>Kirchner and may well have influence over his decision-making 
</p><p>from time to time.  Post has focused this cable on those who 
</p><p>Kirchner seeks daily advice from on policy decisions and 
</p><p>long-term political and economic strategy. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (C) The members of Kirchner's inner circle are very 
</p><p>hard-working, loyal, and committed first to President 
</p><p>Kirchner above any personal ambition.  Most have a connection 
</p><p>to Patagonia and a personal relationship with Kirchner that 
</p><p>stretches back years.  The majority of them are 
</p><p>left-of-center politically, although Alberto Fernandez and 
</p><p>Oscar Parrilli are exceptions to this rule.  Most lack a 
</p><p>depth of expertise in politics beyond the provincial level 
</p><p>and have been learning the ropes of international relations 
</p><p>and national politics at the same time as Kirchner.  The 
</p><p>primary thing that Kirchner demands from his close advisors 
</p><p>is loyalty and it is their proven loyalty, rather than their 
</p><p>competence, that brought them into Kirchner's inner circle. 
</p><p>End Summary and Introduction. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------------------- 
</p><p>Cristina Kirchner: Two for the Price of One 
</p><p>------------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) Cristina is President Kirchner's most valued advisor 
</p><p>on most issues, functioning as his close confidant and 
</p><p>political partner for the last 30 years.  Cristina Kirchner 
</p><p>has been the main person to energize and motivate her husband 
</p><p>throughout his political career, especially during difficult 
</p><p>times.  She also has great influence in determining who is 
</p><p>and is not in the inner circle. President Kirchner has great 
</p><p>respect for her political judgment.  A businessman who is 
</p><p>close to President Kirchner recently told the Ambassador that 
</p><p>then-Governor Kirchner originally accepted former President 
</p><p>Eduardo Duhalde's offer to be Duhalde's chief of staff in 
</p><p>¶2002.  After discussing it overnight with Cristina, who felt 
</p><p>it was a bad political move, Kirchner called Duhalde back the 
</p><p>next day and turned it down.  Although Kirchner frequently 
</p><p>seeks his wife's political advice, long-time Kirchner 
</p><p>associate Luis Corsiglia reported to POLOFF that President 
</p><p>Kirchner generally does not seek her advice on economic 
</p><p>issues.  He tends instead to consult with his key economic 
</p><p>advisors De Vido and Lavagna on matters related to the 
</p><p>economy. 
</p><p>¶6. (C) Cristina enjoys traveling to the United States and has 
</p><p>been described as having a positive view of the U.S. 
</p><p>However, she has never learned English because, as she 
</p><p>explained in a recent speech at Berkeley University, she ""is 
</p><p>part of a generation in which learning English was seen 
</p><p>almost as a defect because of the  Yankees go home, 
</p><p>attitude prevalent at the time.""  Cristina was the main 
</p><p>instigator for her husband's first trips to the United States 
</p><p>(to Miami and New York), where she introduced him to her 
</p><p>extensive contacts in the Democratic Party and the academic 
</p><p>and think tank communities.  She also keeps in close touch 
</p><p>with former President Carter and the Carter Foundation. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C) Cristina Kirchner has told the Ambassador that she is 
</p><p>always available to meet with him and take on issues of 
</p><p>importance to the U.S.  At the Ambassador's suggestion, 
</p><p>Cristina met with President Carter at the Carter Center 
</p><p>during a visit to Atlanta to discuss the political crisis in 
</p><p>Venezuela.  As a result of her visit, Cristina played a 
</p><p>proactive role in encouraging President Kirchner to press 
</p><p>Venezuelan President Chavez to hold the Recall Referendum and 
</p><p>to meet with members of the opposition Democratic 
</p><p>Coordinating Group during his two visits in 2004 to Caracas. 
</p><p>Cristina has also conditioned any potential visit to Cuba on 
</p><p>being able to bring Hilda Molina back with her and meet with 
</p><p>the wives of jailed dissidents. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (C) Cristina is a force in her own right, working 
</p><p>tirelessly as a senator from Santa Cruz with ambitions of 
</p><p>becoming a senator from the politically most important 
</p><p>province of Buenos Aires in 2005.  She is not shy about 
</p><p>expressing her views in the Senate.  Her biographer Jose 
</p><p>Angel Di Mauro describes her as being a poor negotiator, 
</p><p>preferring instead to use a confrontational style with her 
</p><p>political opponents.  She has publicly clashed with many 
</p><p>political figures, including Elisa Carrio, Hilda ""Chiche"" 
</p><p>Duhalde, and Vice President Daniel Scioli on the floor of the 
</p><p>Senate.  Di Mauro reports that President Kirchner has 
</p><p>frequently made use of this personality trait to let 
</p><p>Christina play the role of ""bad cop"" in political conflicts, 
</p><p>allowing President Kirchner to act more conciliatory.  She is 
</p><p>said to never attend meetings of the Peronist Party (PJ) bloc 
</p><p>of Senators, instead relying on her allies in the bloc Miguel 
</p><p>Pichetto and Nicolas Fernandez to get the other PJ senators 
</p><p>to toe the Kirchner line. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (C) Cristina Kirchner was born in 1956 in La Plata in the 
</p><p>province of Buenos Aires.  Cristina met Nestor Kirchner while 
</p><p>they were both studying law at the Universidad Nacional de La 
</p><p>Plata and they were married in 1975.  The Kirchners have two 
</p><p>children.  Cristina was first elected as a Deputy to the 
</p><p>Santa Cruz Provincial Legislature in 1989.  She was elected 
</p><p>in 1995 as a National Senator for Santa Cruz, but was forced 
</p><p>to leave the Senate to become a National Deputy in 1997 due 
</p><p>to conflicts with the PJ bloc leadership.  In 2001 Cristina 
</p><p>Kirchner was again elected to a National Senate seat for 
</p><p>Santa Cruz, which she continues to hold.  She is reportedly 
</p><p>very particular about her appearance, spending thousands of 
</p><p>dollars every year on the latest fashion and having silicone 
</p><p>injections on her face and hair extensions to make her appear 
</p><p>younger. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>-------------------------------- 
</p><p>Carlos Zannini: The Strategy Man 
</p><p>-------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (C) Carlos Zannini, the Secretary for Legal and Technical 
</p><p>Affairs, is Kirchner's most trusted official and is the main 
</p><p>person that conceptualizes and plans the strategies for 
</p><p>Kirchner.  Kirchner seeks Zannini's advice on every decision 
</p><p>he makes.  Zannini lacks experience in international 
</p><p>relations and managing national politics in Buenos Aires, so 
</p><p>he is at a disadvantage when he attempts to guide Kirchner on 
</p><p>foreign relations and sophisticated national political 
</p><p>issues.  By most accounts, Zannini is honest by Argentine 
</p><p>standards. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11. (C) Since accepting his current position in May 2003, 
</p><p>Zannini has taken part in all relevant meetings where 
</p><p>presidential decisions are made and is one of the few 
</p><p>associates that the Kirchners regularly invite to their 
</p><p>Saturday coffee sessions at the Quinta de Olivos to discuss 
</p><p>tactics and strategy.  Zannini reviews and signs off on every 
</p><p>major piece of legislation and Kirchner Administration policy 
</p><p>initiative, including providing clearance on draft texts of 
</p><p>IMF agreements, which he discusses with Kirchner in meetings 
</p><p>at the Casa Rosada that sometimes go to midnight.  Carlos 
</p><p>Zannini is also very close to Cristina Kirchner, with whom he 
</p><p>speaks with at least two or three times a day to give her 
</p><p>legal and political advice, according to the leading weekly 
</p><p>magazine Noticias. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (C) Zannini plays a moderating influence on Kirchner on 
</p><p>economic issues.  He shares Kirchner's obsession with 
</p><p>balanced budgets and fiscal orthodoxy.  POLOFFS who have meet 
</p><p>Zannini describe him as fiercely loyal to Kirchner and 
</p><p>unwilling to express views of his own.  He is readily 
</p><p>accessible to meetings with the Ambassador and DCM.  In 
</p><p>person he is amicable and engaging.  He has a way of putting 
</p><p>his visitors at ease, even when he disagrees with them.  He 
</p><p>reportedly regularly works 16-hour days.  Zannini told DCM 
</p><p>and POLOFF in a recent meeting that he cut his Christmas 
</p><p>vacation short in Rio Gallegos in order to get back to work 
</p><p>in Buenos Aires. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (C) A well-known lawyer in Santa Cruz, Zannini served as 
</p><p>a member of Kirchner's provincial cabinet when Kirchner was 
</p><p>governor.  Those close to Zannini often refer to him by his 
</p><p>nickname ""El Chino,"" which is a reference to his years as a 
</p><p>Maoist activist in his youth.  He spent three years in prison 
</p><p>for his political activities between 1976 and 1979.  Carlos 
</p><p>Zannini was born in Cordoba in 1954, but moved to Santa Cruz 
</p><p>in 1984 on the advice of friends.  In 1995 Zannini was 
</p><p>elected as a Provincial Congressman, serving after his 
</p><p>reelection in 1999 as the President of the PJ bloc.  He 
</p><p>resigned his seat in 2001 to accept a position on the 
</p><p>Provincial Supreme Court and with Kirchner's help he became 
</p><p>the president of the Court only 20 days later.  He is married 
</p><p>to a fellow lawyer, who works as a Cabinet Advisor in the 
</p><p>Provincial Government of Santa Cruz, and with whom he has 
</p><p>four children. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------------- 
</p><p>Sergio Acevedo: Kirchner's Rear Guard 
</p><p>------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶14. (C) Sergio Acevedo, the Governor of Santa Cruz and former 
</p><p>head of the intelligence service SIDE, acts as a 
</p><p>trouble-shooter for the Kirchners and protects their 
</p><p>interests in their home province.  The Kirchners chose 
</p><p>Acevedo to be the one to publicly defend Cristina when she 
</p><p>and Hilda ""Chiche"" Duhalde clashed early in 2004 in a 
</p><p>fractious, Peronist Party convention.  President Kirchner 
</p><p>also sent Acevedo, together with Alberto Fernandez, to the 
</p><p>Ambassador's residence in May 2004 to get a clarification 
</p><p>when some of A/S Noriega's comments were misconstrued in the 
</p><p>Argentine press.  Kirchner sent Acevedo to the U.S. last 
</p><p>December to meet with senior U.S. officials ahead of Foreign 
</p><p>Minister Bielsa's trip to Washington to ensure Kirchner's 
</p><p>message of pragmatism and desiring better relations was 
</p><p>properly delivered.  In his current role as governor, Sergio 
</p><p>Acevedo gives Kirchner the ability to continue to control the 
</p><p>politics of Santa Cruz while he focuses on national political 
</p><p>issues in Buenos Aires. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶15. (C) Acevedo is the idealist of the inner circle and the 
</p><p>only close advisor of President Kirchner who reportedly will 
</p><p>tell him things that Kirchner does not want to hear.  It is 
</p><p>reported that Acevedo will always give the President his 
</p><p>frank opinion, but will close ranks behind him even when 
</p><p>Acevedo disagrees with Kirchner's decisions.  For example, 
</p><p>Acevedo has long urged the repatriation of the province's 
</p><p>funds that Kirchner sent abroad in 2001, but his loyalty to 
</p><p>the President prevents him from publicly challenging Kirchner 
</p><p>on the issue. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶16. (C) Despite his left-wing antecedents, Acevedo professes 
</p><p>to be pro-American.  Before Kirchner's election as President, 
</p><p>Acevedo had little foreign policy experience or exposure to 
</p><p>the U.S.  However, Acevedo seems to have been a driving force 
</p><p>in the Kirchner administration for better ties with the 
</p><p>United States.  The Embassy worked closely with him on 
</p><p>counter terrorism during his time in SIDE.  Later when he 
</p><p>became governor, he invited the DCM to travel to Santa Cruz 
</p><p>to meet with him and his key officials and has actively 
</p><p>sought U.S. investment capital to develop his province's 
</p><p>hydrocarbon and mining resources. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶17. (C) Acevedo wants to attract U.S. investors and supports 
</p><p>free trade with the United States.  He has repeatedly told 
</p><p>EMBOFFS that he thinks U.S. companies come to compete 
</p><p>honestly in Argentina, while he lambastes the unfair business 
</p><p>practices of many European companies, especially those from 
</p><p>Spain.  He has generally supported U.S. oil companies 
</p><p>operating in Santa Cruz facing strong pressure from labor and 
</p><p>piquetero groups.  He has indicated to EMBOFFS that he 
</p><p>supports the FTAA and thinks Chile has benefited from its 
</p><p>free-trade agreement with the United States.  Acevedo even 
</p><p>attempted to find a way to ""grandfather"" Santa Cruz and the 
</p><p>other Patagonian provinces into the Chile FTA.  Acevedo is 
</p><p>also a strong proponent of an Open Skies Agreement allowing 
</p><p>for unrestricted air routes of foreign commercial carriers to 
</p><p>Santa Cruz as a way to develop tourism. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶18. (C) Sergio Acevedo was born in Chubut in 1956, but has 
</p><p>spent almost his entire life in Santa Cruz.  He began his 
</p><p>political career as mayor of the small hamlet of Pico 
</p><p>Truncado in Santa Cruz in 1983, later becoming a provincial 
</p><p>deputy in 1991.  He served as a national deputy for Santa 
</p><p>Cruz between 1995 and 1999, returning then to be Kirchner's 
</p><p>vice governor until 2001 when he again became a national 
</p><p>deputy.  In May 2003 he was appointed the director of the 
</p><p>national intelligence service SIDE before returning to Santa 
</p><p>Cruz at Kirchner's request to run for governor in October 
</p><p>¶2003.  After winning the elections, he assumed office in 
</p><p>December 2003.  He is divorced and has three sons. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- - 
</p><p>Julio De Vido: Infrastructure and Project Czar 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- - 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶19. (C) Julio De Vido has been the main person managing 
</p><p>Kirchner's public works and procurement programs for the past 
</p><p>decade and a half and functions as one of his most important 
</p><p>economic advisors.  He is a long-time collaborator and 
</p><p>confidant of President Kirchner, dating back to Kirchner's 
</p><p>first forays into politics in Rio Gallegos in the 1980s. 
</p><p>President Kirchner appointed De Vido as the Minister of 
</p><p>Federal Planning, Public Infrastructure and Services in May 
</p><p>¶2003.  De Vido manages Argentina's substantial public works 
</p><p>program and is jointly responsible with Minister of the 
</p><p>Economy Lavagna for the renegotiation of the nation's public 
</p><p>service contracts.  Minister De Vido is responsible for the 
</p><p>management of over 30 billion pesos (USD 10 billion) per year 
</p><p>and has under his jurisdiction five secretariats, ten under 
</p><p>secretariats, eight regulatory agencies, the Yacyreta 
</p><p> 
</p><p>SIPDIS 
</p><p>Binational Entity, the Salta Binational Entity, the Atomic 
</p><p>Energy Committee, and the control of all matters related to 
</p><p>government procurement. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶20. (C) De Vido is the member of Kirchner's inner circle most 
</p><p>likely to push him to expand the role of the state in the 
</p><p>economy, which he sees as providing the most opportunities 
</p><p>for national and personal gain.  De Vido's influence over 
</p><p>economic policy now rivals that of Minister Lavagna, who had 
</p><p>unchallenged authority over economic issues during the 
</p><p>Duhalde administration.  Kirchner biographers Valeria Garrone 
</p><p>and Laura Rocha report that Kirchner is using De Vido's 
</p><p>expanded role in the economy to blunt Lavagna's political 
</p><p>ambitions by reducing Lavagna's prominence and share of the 
</p><p>credit for the improving economic situation. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶21. (C) De Vido is described as a traditional, left-wing 
</p><p>Peronist, although Senior Embassy Officers report that he has 
</p><p>gone out of his way to maintain good relations with the U.S. 
</p><p>De Vido has attended four ""sectoral"" dinners at the 
</p><p>Ambassador's Residence to meet with U.S. investors.  De Vido 
</p><p>has been very careful to not publicly criticize the U.S. 
</p><p>When De Vido traveled to Washington, he eagerly changed his 
</p><p>schedule at the Ambassador's suggestion to meet with U/S 
</p><p>Larson.  De Vido has been very forthcoming in discussions 
</p><p>with the Ambassador about the concerns of U.S. companies 
</p><p>operating in Argentina.  He has repeatedly stated that he 
</p><p>prefers the presence of U.S. companies because of their 
</p><p>honesty, managerial excellence, and technological edge. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶22. (C) De Vido has been uniformly friendly in his contacts 
</p><p>with Embassy Officers, visiting USG officials and many U.S. 
</p><p>executives, but has been known to lose his temper in dealing 
</p><p>with some European government officials.  In July 2003, he 
</p><p>sharply told the press that if visiting French Minister of 
</p><p>Economy Francis Mer was coming to talk to him only about the 
</p><p>renegotiation of public service contracts for French 
</p><p>companies (in this case a tariff increase for 40 percent 
</p><p>Suez-owned Aguas Argentinas), he would refuse to meet with 
</p><p>him.  The main reason for the different attitude toward U.S. 
</p><p>and European visitors is that the U.S. public and private 
</p><p>sector visitors have generally come to him in private to 
</p><p>discuss common concerns, while the European visitors have 
</p><p>gone to the press to advance the interests of individual 
</p><p>companies. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶23. (C) De Vido's relationship with Kirchner is described as 
</p><p>being close, but not having the same level of trust as 
</p><p>Kirchner's relationship with Cristina, Zannini, or Acevedo. 
</p><p>Kirchner respects De Vido's intellect and organizational 
</p><p>ability, but knows that De Vido, if anyone, is the one that 
</p><p>has the most dirt on him.  When Kirchner was hospitalized 
</p><p>briefly in April 2004, De Vido was not on the list of those 
</p><p>allowed to visit him in the emergency room, which was limited 
</p><p>to his wife, Zannini, and Acevedo.  Nevertheless, De Vido is 
</p><p>frequently on call to participate in visits to the provinces 
</p><p>and sit in on meetings in the Casa Rosada.  He once told the 
</p><p>Ambassador that he preferred to come to a dinner, rather than 
</p><p>a lunch, because he never knew if he would have to cancel at 
</p><p>the last minute to attend a meeting at the Casa Rosada.  De 
</p><p>Vido is in constant contact with Kirchner by cell phone.  The 
</p><p>Ambassador's and other visiting USG officials' meetings and 
</p><p>dinners with De Vido have often been interrupted by a cell 
</p><p>phone call from Kirchner.  Kirchner usually takes advantage 
</p><p>of these occasions to send greetings to De Vido's hosts 
</p><p>and/or guests. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶24. (C) Since his days in Kirchner's Santa Cruz government, 
</p><p>Julio De Vido has been dogged by allegations of corruption, 
</p><p>although none of these have been proven.  One of De Vido's 
</p><p>main functions during his time in Kirchner's provincial 
</p><p>government was managing the province's large public works 
</p><p>program, Cuatrienal, which the political opposition later 
</p><p>accused of corruption in its awarding of public contracts. 
</p><p>De Vido is currently under investigation by Federal Judge 
</p><p>Jorge Urso for irregularities with the renegotiation of a 
</p><p>public service contract with Aguas Argentinas, the purchase 
</p><p>of locomotives, and with the awarding of a contract to build 
</p><p>a gas pipeline in the northwest part of the country.  His son 
</p><p>Facundo served as his private secretary until a government 
</p><p>internal security source informed Kirchner that Facundo was 
</p><p>taking bribes from private companies in exchange for 
</p><p>arranging appointments with his father.  Kirchner told De 
</p><p>Vido to remove Facundo and Facundo is now a travel guide in 
</p><p>Santa Cruz Province. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶25. (C) Julio De Vido was born in Buenos Aires in 1949 and 
</p><p>was trained as an architect at the University of Buenos 
</p><p>Aires.  He began work as a draftsman at ENTEL, the state 
</p><p>telephone company, in 1974.  He later was promoted to 
</p><p>supervisor, but then was exiled to manage ENTEL works in 
</p><p>Patagonia by the military government in 1976.  He resigned 
</p><p>from ENTEL in 1982 and moved to Rio Gallegos to work for a 
</p><p>private company.  There was a Peronist Party office across 
</p><p>the street from his new home where he first met Kirchner and 
</p><p>established the political partnership that took him to 
</p><p>national prominence.  When Kirchner became mayor of Rio 
</p><p>Gallegos in 1988, he appointed De Vido to be the Director 
</p><p>General of Public Works at the Santa Cruz Institute of Urban 
</p><p>Development and Housing and in 1991 as the head of the 
</p><p>Provincial Highway Bureau.  In 1991, Governor Kirchner 
</p><p>appointed him as Minister of Economy and Public Works, and in 
</p><p>1999 as Minister of Government.  De Vido was a key campaign 
</p><p>organizer and the chief fund-raiser for Kirchner's 2003 
</p><p>presidential campaign.  He is married and has five children.

</p><p>Alberto Fernandez: Kirchner's ""Prime Minister"" 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- - 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶26. (C) Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez is Kirchner's main 
</p><p>advisor on Buenos Aires politics and on the workings of the 
</p><p>national PJ party structure.  Kirchner values Alberto 
</p><p>Fernandez's analysis of people, frequently seeking his advice 
</p><p>on how to work with a given political figure.  Kirchner uses 
</p><p>Fernandez as one of his key people to work behind the scenes 
</p><p>to accomplish his national political goals.  Fernandez is 
</p><p>present at all important meetings.  Fernandez is the one 
</p><p>member of Kirchner's inner circle who really understands the 
</p><p>workings of the PJ at a national level.  He also has an 
</p><p>intricate knowledge of the workings of the Argentine 
</p><p>Congress, and understands how the Buenos Aires provincial and 
</p><p>city party mechanics operate and can be influenced.  As such, 
</p><p>he is Kirchner's ""real world"" front-line political operator 
</p><p>that can make things happen. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶27. (C) Alberto Fernandez lacks the personal history, 
</p><p>connection to Patagonia, and ideological affinity with 
</p><p>Kirchner that others in the inner circle have.  He was 
</p><p>associated with former President Carlos Menem in the past and 
</p><p>comes from a center-right political background.  He is a 
</p><p>conservative on economics and is the member of the inner 
</p><p>circle most likely to encourage President Kirchner to 
</p><p>maintain neo-liberal economic policies. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶28. (C) Fernandez has become one of Kirchner's close advisors 
</p><p>through his proven loyalty and tireless work over the past 
</p><p>few years.  A Senior Embassy Officer compared Alberto 
</p><p>Fernandez to Leon Panetta, who entered the Clinton 
</p><p>administration as a hired gun, but grew to become one of 
</p><p>Clinton's most trusted advisors.  Alberto Fernandez may not 
</p><p>be trusted as much as other members of the inner circle, but 
</p><p>Kirchner appreciates the fact the Fernandez lacks the 
</p><p>presidential ambitions of other officials like Minister 
</p><p>Lavagna.  Kirchner frequently calls on Fernandez to keep the 
</p><p>other ministers in line.  Senior Embassy Officers describe 
</p><p>Alberto Fernandez as being fairly low-key, content to operate 
</p><p>in the background while the Kirchners and other advisors take 
</p><p>more of the spotlight. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶29. (C) Alberto Fernandez was born in Buenos Aires in 1959. 
</p><p>He received his law degree from the University of Buenos 
</p><p>Aires in 1983.  In 1985 he became Records Director for 
</p><p>Juridical Affairs at the Ministry of the Economy and was 
</p><p>later promoted to Deputy Director.  In 1989 he was appointed 
</p><p>as the Insurance Superintendent of the Nation.  He served as 
</p><p>the Vice President of Grupo BAPRO between 1996 and 2000, 
</p><p>where he was responsible for the development of companies 
</p><p>associated with the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires. 
</p><p>Fernandez was also an Assistant Professor of Penal Law at the 
</p><p>University of Buenos Aires Law School.  In June 2000 he 
</p><p>became a legislator of the City of Buenos Aires for the PJ, 
</p><p>serving in this capacity until accepting his current position 
</p><p>in Kirchner's cabinet in May 2003.  He served as Kirchner's 
</p><p>presidential campaign manager.  He is married, but separated 
</p><p>from his wife, and has one son. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------- 
</p><p>Oscar Parrilli: The Door Keeper 
</p><p>------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶30. (C) In his current position as Secretary General of the 
</p><p>Presidency (Casa Rosada Chief of Staff), Oscar Parrilli 
</p><p>controls President Kirchner's schedule.  Senior Embassy 
</p><p>Officers report that Kirchner does not generally seek 
</p><p>Parrilli's advice on policy matters, as Kirchner does not 
</p><p>have a great respect for his intellect.  However, Parrilli is 
</p><p>present at almost every major policy meeting that Kirchner 
</p><p>attends.  Kirchner does value Parrilli's organizational 
</p><p>skills and his ability to bring harmony to the Casa Rosada 
</p><p>staff.  Parrilli is the go-to person for Kirchner on key 
</p><p>issues like his personal security and managing presidential 
</p><p>travel, including the presidential aircraft Tango 01. 
</p><p>Parrilli is also a person with whom Kirchner can vent his 
</p><p>frustrations.  Parrilli does not have a connection to Santa 
</p><p>Cruz, but his long history of activism in PJ politics in the 
</p><p>Patagonian province of Neuquen gives him a natural affinity 
</p><p>with Kirchner. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶31. (C) The one policy issue that Kirchner has entrusted to 
</p><p>Parrilli is relations with the piqueteros.  Parrilli 
</p><p>regularly meets with Raul Castells and other piquetero 
</p><p>leaders to try to advance Kirchner's agenda of keeping the 
</p><p>movement under control.  Kirchner has also used Parrilli to 
</p><p>attempt to draw more moderate piquetero elements into 
</p><p>Kirchner's Transversal political movement.  Kirchner gave 
</p><p>Parrilli the piquetero issue because Kirchner recognized that 
</p><p>Parrilli's mild temperament would help him manage the 
</p><p>often-volatile relations between the Casa Rosada and the 
</p><p>protest movement. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶32. (C) In meetings with Embassy officers, Parrilli is 
</p><p>positive and engaging.  The Ambassador and DCM maintain close 
</p><p>lines of communication with him and have the ability to make 
</p><p>an appointment with Parrilli at any time to discuss any 
</p><p>issue.  Senior Embassy Officers describe Parrilli as a 
</p><p>centrist politically.  Parrilli is reportedly not good at 
</p><p>managing his own schedule, which compounds Kirchner's natural 
</p><p>tendency to be late to meetings. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶33. (C) Oscar Parrilli was born in 1951 in San Martin de los 
</p><p>Andes in Neuquen province.  He is an attorney by training, 
</p><p>receiving his law degree from the University of Buenos Aires 
</p><p>in 1976.  Kirchner and Parrilli first met and became friends 
</p><p>in the 1970s when both were active in Peronist politics in 
</p><p>Patagonia.  Parrilli first held political office as a 
</p><p>provincial PJ legislator in Neuquen in 1983, serving in this 
</p><p>capacity until 1987.  In 1989 he was elected as a National 
</p><p>Deputy.  He unsuccessfully ran for Neuquen governor in 1991 
</p><p>and then left politics for a private law practice when his 
</p><p>term as National Deputy ended in 1993.  In 1998 he joined the 
</p><p>Grupo Calafate, an alternative movement of Peronist activists 
</p><p>opposed to the national PJ party structure dominated by 
</p><p>former President Carlos Menem.  Parrilli worked diligently on 
</p><p>Kirchner's presidential bid and was appointed to his current 
</p><p>position when Kirchner assumed office in May 2003.  He is 
</p><p>married and has four children. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p>Comment 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶34. (C) Kirchner's refusal to hold cabinet meetings and 
</p><p>preference for making policy decisions with a handful of key 
</p><p>advisors makes understanding his inner circle of confidants 
</p><p>crucial to comprehending and predicting Argentina's policy 
</p><p>directions.  Each member of Kirchner's inner circle of 
</p><p>advisors provides their particular expertise, but for 
</p><p>Kirchner the most important thing they offer him is their 
</p><p>unswerving loyalty.  All sources emphasize that ultimately, 
</p><p>after taking in the advice of those important to him, 
</p><p>Kirchner makes all of the decisions himself.  Kirchner has 
</p><p>developed a much greater network of informal advisors than 
</p><p>when he first entered office and he has numerous competent 
</p><p>officials to utilize for policy advice.  However, in the end, 
</p><p>the real decision-making in Argentina is made at the Saturday 
</p><p>afternoon coffees at the Quinta Olivos where Kirchner and his 
</p><p>wife meet with a few long-time intimates. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶35. (C) The political background of most of Kirchner's inner 
</p><p>circle gives some of them a tendency to mistrust U.S. 
</p><p>policies.  In fact, Kirchner vowed to end ""carnal relations"" 
</p><p>with the U.S. during his 2003 campaign for the Presidency. 
</p><p>Nonetheless, Kirchner and his inner circle recognize the 
</p><p>importance of a positive relationship with the U.S and have 
</p><p>given the Ambassador and Senior Embassy Officers an open door 
</p><p>to meet with them to discuss issues.  The inner circle 
</p><p>members are careful to not be seen as being too close to the 
</p><p>U.S. in public, but at the same time they carefully avoid 
</p><p>publicly criticizing the U.S.  The Embassy maintains a 
</p><p>positive dialogue with them in private.  Post will continue 
</p><p>to engage these individuals, providing an excellent 
</p><p>opportunity to act as a positive influence on Kirchner and 
</p><p>Argentine policy.
