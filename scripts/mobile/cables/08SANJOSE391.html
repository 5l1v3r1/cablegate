¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Costa Rican MFA said on May 14 that it 
would not/not co-sponsor the US/EU-backed UN Prisoners of 
Conscience Declaration. After stating on May 9 that it would 
co-sponsor, on May 12 MFA staff remained noncommittal in 
written communications and continued to urge inclusion of 
text calling for access to prisoners of conscience by 
international entities, as well as an additional mention of 
just and fair trials. If there remains any way to show 
flexibility on adding text to accommodate these elements, 
Costa Rica might reconsider. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On May 9, ADCM spoke to the FonMin's Chief of Staff, 
Antonio Alarcon, who said the GOCR would support (and 
presumably co-sign) the declaration. Working level MFA staff, 
however, transmitted a diplomatic note on May 12 that did not 
directly mention co-sponsorship and continued to call for the 
declaration to include access to prisoners of conscience. 
Additionally, the diplomatic note for the first time added a 
request for text calling for guarantee of a fair trial for 
detainees. An unofficial translation follows. 
 
¶3. (U) Begin unofficial translation of May 12 diplomatic note 
(salient portions): 
 
The Office of Foreign Policy of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Religion informs the Embassy that the Government 
of Costa Rica shares the concerns of the United States and 
other Co-sponsors of record on the "Declaration on Prisoners 
of Conscience" and would be interested in having the text of 
the declaration expressly mention the right of visitation 
that the detainees have, and the guarantee of a fair trial, 
which up to now have not been included in the text. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion of Costa Rica 
hopes that in the process of negotiation these amendments can 
be duly considered. 
 
End text. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Further, on the morning of May 13, Post received a 
May 12 after-hours email communication from the MFA's Adriana 
Murillo, Human Rights Officer, reiterating that the MFA is 
interested in the initiative but would like to see the 
declaration take into account the two elements above. The 
evening of May 13, Alarcon relayed the same message to ADCM; 
the GOCR would "probably" sign, but wanted its views taken 
into account in the final declaration text. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On May 14, we arrived to find an email from Deyanira 
Rodriguez, MFA's UN Desk Officer, stating that because they 
have received a verbal response in New York that new language 
cannot be included, Costa Rica regrets that it cannot join 
the US, the EU and other Co-sponsors on this declaration. 
 
¶6. (U) Begin unofficial translation of May 14 MFA email 
(salient portions): 
 
For Costa Rica the topic is very important, and although 
(Costa Rica) does share the concerns expressed by the 
Co-sponsors of this declaration, we consider that there are 
fundamental principles that should not be excluded from the 
declaration, such as the right of visitation that the 
prisoners have and the guarantee to a fair trial. 
 
We have let that be known both in corresponding delegations 
in New York, as well as verbally from the MFA. To now we have 
only received a verbal response in New York by which we are 
told that it will not be possible to include new language in 
this declaration. 
 
It is for the above reasons that Costa Rica regrets that in 
this opportunity, it cannot join the US, the EU and other 
Co-sponsors in this declaration. 
 
End text. 
 
¶7. (C) COMMENT: As renowned advocates for global human 
rights, President Arias and Costa Rica clearly want to be a 
part of this initiative. Alarcon, well aware of USG interest 
in the Declaration, seemed uncomfortable that his government 
was dragging its feet. Showing flexibility on the text might 
help (unless there is some substantive or political reason to 
the contrary). As we requested previously (Ref B), please 
advise whether the GOCR's suggestions can be incorporated 
 
into the declaration text. END COMMENT.
