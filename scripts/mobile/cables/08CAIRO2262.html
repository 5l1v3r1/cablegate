  		<h1>NOMINATION OF NEHAD ABOUL KOMSAN FOR THE 2009 SECRETARY'S AWARD FOR INTERNATIONAL WOMEN OF COURAGE REF: A. STATE 99729 B. CAIRO 22511.(SBU) Summary: Nehad Aboul Komsan, Embassy Cairo's nominee for the Secretary's International Women of Courage Award, deserves USG commendation for her tireless campaigning on behalf of women's rights in Egypt in an often hostile public environment. Aboul Komsan's efforts as Chair of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights (ECWR) range from providing training for female political candidates to raising societal awareness of the growing problem of sexual harassment and assault, to providing legal assistance for impoverished women. ECHR is a small, independent NGO that receives funds from the EU, MEPI and private foundations. Aboul Komsan has courageously pressed for advancement on women's issues in the face of government policy that is often indifferent to women's concerns and sometimes obstructionist. A lawyer by training, she has used her skills to provide legal aid to impoverished women, and legal representation for the plaintiff in the October 21 landmark ruling against a perpetrator of sexual assault (ref B). She has used her political skills to provide training for female candidates who successfully ran in 2005 and 2008 elections that were marred by government interference. Aboul Komsan has deployed her public relations skills in ECWR's campaign to raise awareness of sexual harassment and assault, and to publicize the dangers of female genital mutilation (FGM) -- playing an important role in the passage of the June 2008 Child Law that criminalizes the practice. End summary.</h1>
