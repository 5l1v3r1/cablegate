 ¶1. Summary. Opposition National Party leader Don Brash is 
entering the 2005 election season with a sense of a cautious 
optimism about his party's chances of regaining power.  While 
concerned about recent setbacks that have seen him labeled 
"anti-women" and "anti-Maori," Brash regards the Labour 
Government's weakness in addressing scandals in the education 
sector as a sign of vulnerability ready to be exploited. 
Foreign affairs, including discussion of the GoNZ's 
anti-nuclear legislation, are not areas he believes either 
major party will pursue in the campaign.  Recently Brash has 
faced criticism about his leadership style from those  both 
in and outside of his party, making it clear that more than 
one party member is nipping at his heels for the chance to 
take over as leader.  Even if National wins the election, 
Brash will face an uphill battle in forming an effective 
government, as his choice of coalition partners is small and 
shrinking.  Whether or not his party wins, the election will 
test Brash's abilities as a leader.   End summary. 
 
Getting the Message Out ) Scandals Aside 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) PolCouns and Poloff met with Opposition National Party 
leader Don Brash and National party strategy advisor Peter 
Keenan February 14.  Brash began the meeting by admitting 
that it was incredibly hard while in Opposition to set the 
election agenda, especially when the economy is doing so 
well.  He added that National will continue in the coming 
year to push its key policy planks )- law & order, social 
welfare reform, Treaty issues and education -- which are 
currently enjoying the spotlight.  Despite recent setbacks, 
including the demotion of welfare spokeswoman Katherine Rich, 
which overshadowed Brash's major policy announcement on 
welfare on January 25 (reftel,) Brash was cautiously 
optimistic about his Party's overall position in the build-up 
to the 2005 election, widely projected for September.  While 
his welfare speech was generally well-received, and was well 
covered by the media, Brash laughingly noted that a 
photograph of him seated between conservative Christian 
leader Brian Tamaki and Maori activist Tame Iti at NZ's 
national Waitangi Day celebrations provided more press than 
his speech. 
 
¶3. (C) Brash was very forthright on recent accusations that 
he was anti-women, noting that his demotion of Katherine Rich 
from the welfare portfolio after she publicly refused to 
support the party's position probably gained him votes among 
men, who saw it as the move of a strong leader, but lost him 
votes among women, who see a front bench devoid of females. 
He noted that it was "unfortunate" that women's issues were 
being addressed in the manner the media had chosen. He 
compared it to criticisms last year after his January 2004 
speech to the Orewa Rotary Club against racial preference 
that National was anti-Maori. Brash reiterated that National 
had the best policies for Maori ) noting that five of the 
nine National candidates announced on February 13 to stand in 
Auckland in the upcoming election were Maori. 
 
A Lost Chance, An Isolated Island Nation 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Brash agreed with our assessment that foreign policy 
was not likely to figure as an election issue, although free 
trade agreements would likely be a recurrent topic. 
National's primary foreign policy goal, he said, was to 
rebuild the relationship with Australia, which could only 
truly be done by building a better relationship with the U.S. 
Brash commented that National should have overturned the 
nuclear ban when it had the chance in 1992 with the release 
of the Somers Report, but that his party would be unable to 
move on the issue in the build-up to this election.  In part 
this was due to the infamous incident in which Brash was 
misquoted as having told Senator Nichols that were he Prime 
Minister the ban would be "gone by lunchtime," which Labour 
continues to use against him to this day.  (In her recent 
State of the Country address to Parliament, PM Clark said 
that under her government, NZ's "status as nuclear free would 
not be gone by lunchtime.") But Brash said time would also be 
needed to lay groundwork before the public was ready to 
discuss the issue.  He reiterated his interest in approaching 
the issue after a National Government was safely in control 
of Parliament.  (Note: A National Party media advisor 
indicated to Poloff that the nuclear ban issue would most 
likely be addressed in a second National Party term -- 2008 
at the earliest.) On New Zealand's FTA negotiations with 
China, Brash said that National is probably in agreement with 
Labour on moving forward, and he visited Beijing last year to 
make that well known to Chinese leadership. 
 
¶5. (C) Brash added that National is committed to increasing 
spending on defense, which he noted had been low not only 
during Labour's tenure, but in the mid-90s under the previous 
National government.  However, he has been advised by 
military experts that any defense spending increase must be 
done incrementally, as any equipment purchases must be 
matched with personnel increases and a long training 
pipeline.  He therefore does not have definite plans for 
either materiel procurement or recruitment increases. 
(Comment: This strategy also allows Brash to avoid his party 
being accused of being war-mongering, but it puts him in an 
odd position vis a vis the Labour government, which claims to 
be increasing military spending.  End Comment.) 
 
The Cheese Stands Alone 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Discussing possible future coalition partners, Brash's 
optimism over election results was replaced with a far more 
negative outlook.  While almost dismissive of partnering with 
ACT (which has been polling at less than 2 percent and may 
disappear off of the political radar, and whose leader 
recently criticized Brash in the media), he was optimistic 
about the chances of working with Peter Dunne's centrist 
United Future Party. Brash bluntly dismissed the possibility 
of allying with Winston Peters, whose NZ First Party is 
polling well, and may be the decisive factor in either a 
National or Labour-led government  Brash noted that many in 
his caucus are completely against working with Peters again 
after Peters served disastrously as Deputy PM under a 
National Government in 1996.  Personally, said Brash, he 
distrusts Peters, who he says lacks both a framework and an 
ideology, with policies that merely reacted to whichever way 
the wind blows. 
 
¶7. (C) Comment: Brash is treading a narrow path in this 
election year, balancing attacks against the government with 
defending his party from recurrent internal conflicts.  He 
freely admits that his party, who remain underdogs after 
their pitiful result in the 2002 election, faces an uphill 
battle as Labour uses its substantial financial surplus and 
the benefits of strong economic conditions to sway voters to 
the status quo.  But Brash seems to us to be gaining 
confidence, both in his ability to hold his party together 
and in his efforts to gain public support.  He may be drawing 
strength from his frequent under-the-radar trips to court 
voters around the country, although we have seen no specific 
evidence of this.  He may also be heartened by a recent bump 
in the polls, although he claimed to us it was too early to 
consider the gain as significant.  There is no doubt, 
however, that members of Brash's caucus have been very 
successful recently in drawing media attention to areas of 
government weakness, such as the recent debacle over 
scholarship exams.  As the saying goes, the election may not 
be his to win, but Labour's to lose.
