Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal via telephone on July 29.
First, they discussed the issue of the Saudi humanitarian aid
convoy to Lebanon (Ref A). The Ambassador assured the
Foreign Minister that Post staff was working in coordination
with Saudi government officials on this issue. The FM stated
that the Saudis wish to avoid an incident similar to the one
experienced by the UAE convoy the other day (Ref B).
</p><p>¶2. (C) Secondly, the Ambassador raised the visa issue of
Riyadh Consul General-Designate Ted Halstead, who has not
received his visa following the submission of his application
on July 1. The Foreign Minister seemed genuinely surprised
and said that he would check into it (Note: Post learned
today Consul General-Designate Halstead's visa has been
issued and he is expected shortly. End Note.).
</p><p>¶3. (S) Lastly, the Ambassador thanked the SAG for assistance
in denying overflight of the Syrian IL-76 from Tehran to
Damascus (Ref C), and informed the Foreign Minister that
there were indications that Tehran might try it again. The
Ambassador thanked the SAG for their assistance to Lebanon
and to Prime Minister Abbas to aid the Palestinians.
