¶1. (S/NF) In response to reftel, Post country team has 
discussed the likely domestic NZ response to a potential U.S. 
and UNSCR designation of  the Kuwait-based Revival of Islamic 
Heritage Society (RIHS). We believe there would be little if 
any reaction to a designation. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) Post is not aware of the presence or ongoing 
activity of RIHS in New Zealand. The GNZ conducts thorough 
periodic review of charitable institutions operating in New 
Zealand, which, combined with the strong domestic social 
welfare state and relatively small Islamic community here, 
make it unlikely that RIHS would establish a foothold in New 
Zealnd. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) The largest domestic Islamic group in country is 
the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIANZ) 
established in 1979 to support education and charitable 
activities. It is a federation consisting of regional Muslim 
associations whose purpose is to foster good relations with 
Muslim countries and international Muslim organizations. 
FIANZ president, Javed Khan has told Post in the past that 
his organization takes the threat of terrorism seriously and 
remains proactive in preventing New Zealand Muslims from 
becoming ensnarned in terrorist related activities 
particularly were it involves alms giving.
