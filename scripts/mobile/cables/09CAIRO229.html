  		<h1>STATE SECURITY DETAINS EGYPTIAN-GERMAN BLOGGER AND GAZA ACTIVIST REF: A. 09 CAIRO 79 B. 08 CAIRO 2431 C. 08 CAIRO 862 D. 08 CAIRO 797 Classified By: ECPO Mincouns William R. Stewart for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(C) Summary and comment: Egyptian State Security (SSIS) arrested Egyptian-German student, blogger, film-maker and pro-Palestinian activist Philip Rizk February 6 following a small rally in Ismailia calling for opening the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Rizk's sister told embassy contacts that prior to the arrest, SSIS urged Rizk to stop his pro-Palestinian political activism and film-making. SSIS continues to hold Rizk, and raided his family's home in the early morning hours of February 9, apparently with the Interior Minister's personal approval, to search for evidence against Rizk. The German Embassy has formally requested information about the arrest and consular access, which SSIS has thus far ignored. The Germans told us they have not approached the MFA, and prefer to deal directly with SSIS. The Germans have strongly urged us not to raise the case with the GOE because they fear that heightening the issue's political profile would jeopardize Rizk's release. SSIS' arrest of Rizk may stem from the GOE's fear that Rizk and other educated, tech-savvy activists have the capability to publicly embarrass and challenge the government. End summary and comment.</h1>
