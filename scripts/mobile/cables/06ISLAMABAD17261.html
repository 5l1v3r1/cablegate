¶1.  (C/NF)  On August 25, PolCouns met LTC Imran Farooq, 
MoI/National Crisis Management Cell Operations, to solicit 
his assessment of his visit to the detention facilities at 
Guantanamo (GTMO).  LTC Imran said that interviews with the 
Pakistani detainees went well.  The Pakistani delegation left 
with the impression that most of the Pakistani detainees are 
individuals who were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," 
not extremists who pose a serious threat.  LTC Imran said 
that the Pakistani delegation provided an out-brief to "the 
four intelligence agencies" at GTMO before departing. 
 
¶2.  (C/NF) Imran said that the delegation discussed 
repatriation of the detainees with these intelligence 
agencies and the force commander at GTMO; the delegation left 
with the impression that no major obstacles remain to the 
repatriation of six of the Pakistani detainees. This includes 
Saifullah Paracha, provided that the GOP makes arrangements 
to keep him in detention here in Pakistan.  LTC Imran said 
that GTMO officials told the delegation that if the 
Government of Pakistan (GOP) submits a formal request for 
repatriation, it will be favorably received. Upon his return 
to Islamabad, LTC Imran prepared a report for the MFA in 
support of a formal request for repatriation.  In addition to 
six of the GTMO detainees, Imran said that the GOP would be 
requesting the release of 20 Pakistani nationals currently in 
Bagram. 
 
¶3.  (C/NF)  PolCouns advised LTC Imran that the Embassy had 
yet to receive a response from the GOP regarding the USG 
request for written assurances regarding access, etc. (Ref A, 
B), for detainees released to Pakistani custody; that it 
would be important for the US to receive this before any new 
request for expedited repatriation.  (Note:  Following this 
meeting with LTC Imran, Embassy received the requested 
written assurances from the MFA on August 29; see para. 7, 
below. Post will fax/email a copy of the MFA note to SCA. 
End note.) 
 
¶4.  (C/NF)  Imran warned that for the GOP to keep Saifullah 
Paracha in custody, it would need information/evidence from 
the USG to justify his continued detention, noting that 
Paracha's family has a petition protesting his detention 
pending in the Pakistan Supreme Court.  Without some evidence 
to support a longer detention, LTC Imran said, Pakistani law 
would only permit his detention for three months. (Note: 
Post will pursue the question of the GOP's ability to hold 
detainees in custody with the MFA and other interlocutors. 
End note.) 
 
¶5.  (C/NF)  LTC Imran concluded by requesting that PolCouns 
poll USG colleagues in Washington for agencies' views on 
prompt repatriation of the Pakistani detainees.  PolCouns 
agreed to solicit interagency position, but warned that it 
would be difficult to share these views frankly when the GOP 
continues to leak stories proclaiming the detainees  imminent 
release to the local press.  Stressing that the USG wants to 
work with the GOP to resolve the GTMO cases, PolCouns noted 
that this is a sensitive process that must take place 
quietly, not in the newspapers, so as not to create inflated 
expectations. 
 
¶6.  (C/NF)  Comment:  Post appreciates word that DOD is 
prepared to move forward crisply with the repatriation of 
certain Pakistani detainees (Ref C) and looks forward to 
working with OSD, S/WCI and SCA on facilitating this process. 
 Post requests guidance from Department on next steps, 
including interagency coordination and coordination with the 
GOP of any press statements preceding or following the 
repatriation. 
 
¶7.  (C/NF)  Text of diplomatic note received August 29, 2006 
responding to Embassy's note verbale of July 24, 2006 (Ref A): 
 
(Begin text.)
