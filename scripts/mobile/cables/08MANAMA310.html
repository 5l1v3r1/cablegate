</p><p>2.(C) CDA and poloff met May 18 with MFA Director of Bilateral Relations Dr. Dhafer Al-Umran to convey reftel demarche. Al-Umran was the most senior substantive MFA official who was not in Doha or in Sharm el-Sheikh. In response to reftel points, Al-Umran said Bahrain was deeply worried that a "formula" would emerge from Doha that gave Hizballah too much. He said Bahraini FM Sheikh Khalid and UAE FM Shaikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nayhan were in Doha as "the right and left hands of the Saudis" and were working quietly to avoid such an outcome. As for public statements, he reiterated that Bahrain's line to date had been measured and would remain so as long as Bahrain and its Arab partners saw hope of minimizing Hizballah's gains. If not, his assessment was that the Saudis and other Arabs will "turn on" Syria. Al-Umran undertook to convey reftel demarche to the FM in Doha.
</p><p>3.(SBU) Bio note: Al-Umran, a Sunni, is half Lebanese on his mother's side. He said he spent 16 years of his youth in Lebanon. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** HENZEL</p>
