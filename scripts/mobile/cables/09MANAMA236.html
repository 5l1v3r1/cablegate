</p><p>¶1. (SBU) Bahrain is eager to see the Obama
administration,s peacemaking efforts succeed, and your visit
April 20 will be big news here. King Hamad will receive you
at his palace in Safariyah, joined by Foreign Minister Shaikh
Khalid bin Ahmad bin Mohammad, and others. Ambassador Ereli,
who is nearing the end of his TDY in Iraq, will be in Bahrain
for your visit.
</p><p>Moderates vs. Extremists
------------------------------
</p><p>¶2. (S) King Hamad presides over a genteel tug-of-war
between modernizers and reactionaries in his own Al-Khalifa
clan. The modernizing elements (led by his son, Crown Prince
Salman, and Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid) are actively
seeking a means by which to outflank and marginalize
extremists, both within Bahrain and in the Arab world. The
Crown Prince has told us explicitly that as long as the
Israeli)Palestinian conflict festers, it will provide fuel
to the conservative Sunni elements within Bahrain that oppose
the openness and reform that he sees as indispensable for the
country's growth and prosperity. It also empowers Hamas,
Hizballah and Iran, whom the Bahraini leadership consider a
threat to the region and their regime. Crown Prince Salman
and Shaikh Khalid have urged the USG to make it clear to
those supporting extremism that they will pay a price in
terms of their relationship with the U.S. They are referring
principally to Qatar, whose foreign policy ) particularly
its support for Hamas - is viewed in Manama as dangerous.
The Crown Prince and Shaikh Khalid view other Arab moderates
like the UAE and Jordan as natural allies, and often
collaborate with them.
</p><p>The &Other8 Shaikh Khalid
-------------------------
</p><p>¶3. (S) On the other side of the tug-of-war, occasionally
(and temporarily) pulling Bahrain's foreign policy in
unhelpful directions, are Al-Khalifas close to the Sunni
religious parties who are the majority in Bahrain's elected
lower house of parliament. For instance, they successfully
advocated for Khalid Mishaal,s official visits to Bahrain in
September, 2008 and March, 2009. They also oppose compromise
with Bahrain's Shia majority, and are sullen over the mass
pardon the King granted this week to 178 Shia security
detainees. The Minister of the Royal Court, Shaikh Khalid
bin Ahmad bin Salman (not to be confused with FM Shaikh
Khalid bin Ahmad bin Mohammad) is one of these hard-liners,
and may join your meeting with the King. If this &other8
Shaikh Khalid is present, you may find FM Shaikh Khalid more
circumspect than he was in Washington.
</p><p>FM,s Plan to Engage with Israeli Media
--------------------------------------
</p><p>¶4. (S) FM Shaikh Khalid appreciated his meeting with you in
Washington, and told me April 16 that he would try to find
some steps that could be taken within the spirit of the Arab
Peace Initiative in order to support you and the new
administration. He added that he would like to engage with
the Israeli media, and that it would help him if you could
tell the King that GOB contact with Israeli media would be
helpful. In response to my observation that Bahrain had gone
much further than this over the past two years, engaging
directly with the Israeli government publicly and privately,
the FM said he could no longer defend internally his past
&close8 contacts with Israel, in light of FM Lieberman,s
statement about Annapolis. Shaikh Khalid hopes the U.S. and
moderate Arabs will be able to persuade the Netanyahu
government to walk back from this position, and attend a
Moscow &Annapolis II8 meeting.
</p><p>Regional Proposal: Shelved for Now
-----------------------------------
</p><p>¶5. (S) Last September, FM Shaikh Khalid proposed a new
regional organization that would have included Iran and
Israel. (The proposal was reportedly the result of an
early-2008 brainstorming session between King Hamad and
</p><p>MANAMA 00000236 002 OF 002
</p><p>President Gul of Turkey.) The proposal never came to much,
but it was an indicator of Bahrain's desire to be seen as a
creative contributor to Arab-Israeli diplomacy. The FM told
me April 16 that during Gul,s visit to Bahrain April 15, Gul
and King Hamad had agreed that the proposal for a new
organization proposal should be shelved until after &we
re-start a dialogue8 with Israel.
