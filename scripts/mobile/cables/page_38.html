REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) GOL officials are hurriedly pulling together arrangements for a meeting of heads of state from Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) member states, scheduled to take place in Tripoli June 10-13. MFA Secretary for European Affairs (U/S-equivalent) told the U.K. Ambassador on June 7 that the presidents of Mauritania, Algeria and Tunisia, together with Moroccan Prime Minister Abbas el-Fassi, would arrive June 10 for a meeting of the AMU. Egyptian PolCouns Ahmed Abdel Halim told P/E Chief on June 9 that the Egyptian Embassy had received the same information regarding participants and the notional dates.  Morocco has reportedly refused to be represented by King Muhammad VI because of ongoing disagreements with Algeria over the Western Sahara. (Note: Post's understanding is that a full quorum of AMU heads of state has not convened since 1994; the last senior-level meeting of the AMU, in mid-2005, was derailed in part by Morocco-Algeria contretemps.  End note.)  Echoing dynamics reported reftel, Abdel Halim said "there are concerns" that bad blood - between Algeria and Morocco, and between Libya and Mauritania (Mauritania has alleged Libyan complicity in an attempted coup in Nouakchott), among others - could derail what he described as "a Libyan initiative to reinvigorate the AMU".  2. (C) In typical fashion, the GOL has delayed finalizing preparations until the last minute.  Guests in Tripoli's only five-star hotel, including several official USG travelers, were informed late on June 8 that they would have to check out not later than June 9 by order of the GOL to make room for senior AMU leaders and their retinues.  Delegations are scheduled to begin arriving in Tripoli late on the afternoon of June 10.  The event is scheduled to kick off that evening with a late night coffee 'majlis', with formal meetings to follow on June 11 and 12.  3. (C) Abdel Halim confirmed reports in the Arabic-language newspaper al-Hayat and elsewhere that a visit to Libya by Syrian President Bashar al-Asad would coincide with the AMU meeting (local reports differ as to whether it will be labeled a "summit" or not).  Asad's arrival date had not been fixed, and the Egyptian Embassy's information was that it was still being decided whether he would participate in the AMU meeting as a guest observer, or would only make a cameo appearance and then have bilateral meetings with Muammar al-Qadhafi.  The Egyptian Ambassador had been told that Asad's Tripoli visit was part of a follow-on to his recent tour of Gulf states, where he thanked Arab heads of state who attended the recent Arab League Summit in Damascus.  Saying it was "expected" that Asad would have discussions with al-Qadhafi and other AMU leaders on the Middle East Peace Process and Syria's negotiations with Israel over the Golan, Abdel Halim said there was considerable confusion about what else might be on the agenda for the AMU meeting.  Abdel Halim said the Egyptian Embassy in Tripoli had not yet been informed whether Egyptian President Husni Mubarak would also travel to Tripoli to join the conclave, but noted that many GOL officials appeared to believe that Mubarak would come.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: In a strongly worded speech at what was characterized as a mini-Arab League summit, Muammar al-Qadhafi sharply criticized a French-backed Mediterranean Union proposal, claiming that attempts to incentivize southern Mediterranean states with investment schemes were insulting.  Claiming that the new entity would undermine Arab and African member states' commitments to the Arab League (AL)and African Union (AU), respectively, he suggested that an alternative could be formal EU cooperation with the AL and AU, to be coordinated through the headquarters of the latter two organizations.  A visit to Tripoli by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair coincided with the mini-summit; al-Qadhafi reportedly told Blair he was concerned that the Mediterranean Union proposal represented an effort by southern European states to create a de facto North African bulwark against illegal migration from sub-Saharan Africa, and to "further legitimize" Israel at the expense of Arab states.  End summary.  2. (U) At a mini-Arab League (AL) summit meeting in Tripoli on June 10, Muammar al-Qadhafi made a strong case against a Mediterranean Union modeled on and linked to the European Union (EU), an idea championed by French President Nicholas Sarkozy that would comprise the 27 EU nations and a dozen non-EU countries located along the southern Mediterranean littoral. The meeting was attended by heads of state from Mauritania, Algeria, Tunis and Syria, and by Moroccan Prime Minister Abbas el-Fassi.  Originally billed to some Arab diplomats in Tripoli as an Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) summit plus Syrian President Bashar al-Asad and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (ref A), late innings controversy about the refusal of King Muhammad VI of Morocco to attend reportedly prompted the Government of Libya (GOL) to recast the event as a mini-AL summit.  3. (U) Orchestrated by al-Qadhafi, the Tripoli meeting was designed to muster Arab opposition to the Mediterranean Union proposal in advance of a broader gathering in Paris on July 13 to formally unveil the plan.  In a strongly-worded opening address, al-Qadhafi characterized the French proposal as an attempt to undermine the unity of Arab League and African Union member states.  Describing Sarkozy's proposal as "a passing fad", he likened it to the failed Barcelona Process initiated in 1995, and said attempts to incentivize AL and AU states to join the new union with large-scale investment proposals were "an insult".  Striking a populist tone, he stressed that Arab and African states were "not hungry to this extent; we're not dogs that they can wave a bone in front of and we'll run after it". Arab and African unity "should not be sacrificed for transient investment projects".  Emphasizing that member states' commitments to the extant AL and AU trumped those to any nascent Mediterranean Union, he suggested that a viable alternative to a new structure could be formal cooperation between the EU and AL and AU states, to be coordinated through AL headquarters in Cairo and AU headquarters in Addis Ababa.  Al-Qadhafi's sarcastic references to "my dear Sarkozy" took observers by surprise and has left some wondering whether the bonhomie engendered by the latter's visit to Tripoli in July 2007 has begun to ebb.  French diplomats in Tripoli offered no comment, noting only that they had not yet received instructions from Paris on whether or how to respond.  4. (C) Al-Qadhafi was the only leader to offer public remarks before the meeting adjourned to a reportedly heated session of principals plus one.  Egyptian and Algerian diplomats told us Morocco was isolated in its support for the Mediterranean Union proposal and by the fact that it was represented at the PM, vice head of state, level.  Libyan MFA interlocutors conceded that a closing statement had been expected and desired by al-Qadhafi; however, the group was unable to achieve consensus on its position concerning the union, let alone language for a summary statement.  In a further sign of discord, President Mubarak ultimately did not attend (he cited a heavy schedule), despite persistent efforts by al-Qadhafi to lure him to Tripoli to broker a truce with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad.  The Egyptian PolCouns told us al-Qadhafi called Mubarak twice - once while in the car with Asad on their way into town from the airport - to urge him to come to Tripoli (further details on Asad's visit were reported ref B)  5. (C) The mini-AL summit coincided with a visit to Tripoli on June 10 by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.  U.K. Deputy Head of Mission Mark Matthews told P/E Chief June 11 that al-Qadhafi stressed to Blair in their private meeting concern that Sarkozy's proposal represented an effort by southern European states to create a de facto North African bulwark against illegal migration from sub-Saharan Africa. Recapitulating themes we've heard publicly here, al-Qadhafi insisted the key to mitigating illegal migration flows to Europe  TRIPOLI 00000457  002.2 OF 002   was to reduce "push" factors by promoting greater development in source countries.  The two specifically discussed the possibility of Libyan investment in Sierra Leone and Rwanda, countries in which Blair's charitable foundation has a strong interest (further details on Blair's visit septel).  Al-Qadhafi also voiced suspicion that the Mediterranean Union could be used as a forum in which to encourage further Arab-Israeli rapprochement as a means by which to "further legitimize" Israel at the expense of the Arabs.  6. (C) Comment: Al-Qadhafi's speech offers a snapshot of Libya's unique vision of overlapping pan-Arab and pan-African aspirations.  While striking vintage pan-Arab themes - "we are fully committed to the Arab League, which we hope will one day lead us to an eventual Arab union" - he was also careful to stress that Arab Maghreb states were African and had responsibilities to their sub-Saharan counterparts that trumped any notional partnership with Europe.

<li><h3><a href='/mobile/cables/08TRIPOLI494.html'>JOURNALIST JAILED FOR CRITICIZING GOVERNMENT'S POORLY-COORDINATED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  CLASSIFIED BY: Chris Stevens, CDA, U.S. Embassy Tripoli, Dept of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary:  A respected Libyan journalist was jailed on charges that a column he wrote criticizing the government's poorly-coordinated urban development efforts had incited negative public opinion and called into question the "people's authority".  Released from prison pending trial after the intervention of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, the case may stem from tension between Saif al-Islam and the Prime Minister, who has reportedly led the charge to try and sentence the journalist. End summary.  JOURNALIST JAILED  2. (C) Opposition websites reported in early May that Muhammad Tarnesh, a journalist and Executive Director of the Human Rights Society of Libya (HRSL - affiliated with the Qadhafi Development Foundation), was arrested and charged in connection with a column he wrote criticizing the fact that after twenty-five years of inactivity in the area of urban development, the Government of Libya (GOL) had undertaken a hasty, poorly coordinated campaign of housing and infrastructure development that featured as its primary accomplishment to date the seemingly random destruction of large numbers of residences and businesses.  Lamenting the suffering caused by the widespread "'Izaala" campaign (a word that translates as "removal", and is written on buildings slated for destruction), Tarnesh's column pointedly asked readers whether anyone had seen the homes of government ministers destroyed.  3. (C) Tarnesh's column first appeared on April 1 in the "Maal wa A'mal" newspaper, published by al-Izdihar Press in Misurata. Tarnesh was subsequently arrested, the paper's editor-in-chief, Khalifa Muqattaf was questioned and al-Izdihar Press was closed by order of the Secretary of the General People's Committee for Information, Nuri Hmeidi.  The column was subsequently posted in early May on the website "Libya al-Youm" ("Libya Today"). "Libya al-Youm" reported that a group of prominent Libyan journalists had met at the Journalists' League in Tripoli in early May to express solidarity with Tarnesh and Muqattaf and criticize the GOL's abuse of restrictive press laws to muzzle criticism.  CHARGES MAY STEM FROM PERSONAL ANIMUS BETWEEN SAIF AL-ISLAM AND PRIME MINISTER  4. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E Chief on May 28 that he was arrested on three charges in late April under Press Act 76 of 1972: 1) inciting negative public opinion; 2) criticizing the leaders of the Revolution, and; 3) casting doubt on the ability of secretaries of the General People's Committees (GPC's), and thereby questioning the "people's authority".  xxxxxxxxxxxx was in custody for some 10 days during the initial part of the investigation.  Officials from the Prosecutor General's office told him Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi had taken particular umbrage at Tarnesh's column, had orchestrated his arrest and had evinced a personal interest in seeing Tarnesh tried and sentenced.  Al-Mahmoudi, who was widely rumored to have fallen from favor with Leader Muammar al-Qadhafi and was expected to have been sacked at the March session of the General People's Conference, is reportedly highly sensitive to criticism of development projects, in part because Housing and Infrastructure Board Chairman Dorda - a more charismatic figure - has received credit for the progress that has been made while al-Mahmoudi has born the brunt of criticism.  Hoping to forestall criticism and possibly save his job, al-Mahmoudi undertook a poorly-received campaign of personal appearances and press availability sessions at a number of housing and infrastructure sights in the run-up to the March session of the General People's Congress.  After officials from the quasi-governmental Qadhafi Development Foundation (QDF), headed by Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, intervened with the Prosecutor General's office, Tarnesh was ultimately released from prison pending his trial.  5. (C) Noting that officials from the Prosecutor General's office told him they believed the charges were frivolous and unlikely to stand up in court, xxxxxxxxxxxx offered that he would personally be less confident about his case if it were not for the personal interest of Saif al-Islam, who was following his case and who, according to QDF Executive Director Dr. Yusuf Sawani, had personally raised it with al-Mahmoudi. (Note: xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E Chief that Saif al-Islam had personally recruited him to head the HRSL because he was an avid reader of his columns and appreciated xxxxxxxxxxxx's willingness to openly question GOL officials' competence.  End note.)  Al-Mahmoudi had persisted in his efforts to have xxxxxxxxxxxx re-incarcerated until  TRIPOLI 00000494  002 OF 002   his trial, so far to no avail.  Claiming it was well-known that al-Mahmoudi and Saif al-Islam didn't see eye-to-eye, xxxxxxxxxxxx said some had speculated that al-Mahmoudi orchestrated xxxxxxxxxxxx's prosecution to strike an oblique blow at Saif al-Islam.  As it stood, xxxxxxxxxxxx believed he stood a good chance of being acquitted on all three charges; the next hearing is scheduled for late-June.  Laughingly noting that there was "no such thing as justice in Libya", xxxxxxxxxxxx joked that it was fortunate for him that a son of the Leader with no official position (a reference to Saif al-Islam) could trump a Prime Minister.  ARTICLE STRIKES A CHORD  6. (C)    Post spoke with a number of Libyans who had read xxxxxxxxxxxx's column.  The broad consensus was that xxxxxxxxxxxx had given voice to commonly held frustration with what they view as an arbitrary and fruitless "development" program. (Note: xxxxxxxxxxxx is a regular columnist and is well and favorably known in Libya's sterile media environment as the author of articles that gently criticize and poke fun at government incompetence and inconsistencies.  End note.)  A young taxi driver who had until recently managed his family's clothing store on Djeraba Street complained bitterly that the GOL had given his family less than a week's notice that the store was slated for destruction, and had ultimately provided compensation for only one-tenth of its value.  Noting that he had to delay his wedding because his family finances had suffered, he echoed comments by other Tripolitanians to the effect that the development projects and related destruction of existing structures had been badly coordinated by the GOL.  7. (C) Comment: xxxxxxxxxxxx's case underscores the personal and at times petty nature of intra-regime politics in Libya, where the limits of public discourse remain narrowly circumscribed.  It is blatantly obvious to local observers that the rush to tear down old facades and put up new buildings as evidence of the revolution's benefits (keyed to the 40th anniversary of the revolution, which will fall on September 1, 2009) has placed a considerable burden on a system characterized by limited capacity.  Libya, however, remains a place where one does not lightly tell the emperor he has no clothes.  End comment. STEVENS</a></h3><p>Tags: PGOV PREL PHUM PINR LY - 08TRIPOLI494</p></li>
