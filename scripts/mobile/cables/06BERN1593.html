<br>SUBJECT: (CORRECTED COPY) SWISS FOREIGN MINISTER \
<br>CALMY-REY EMPHASIZES IMPORTANCE OF U.S.-SWISS \
<br>RELATIONS, REGRETS "MISUNDERSTANDING" CONCERNING HER \
<br>RECENT REMARKS TO THE SWISS AMBASSADORS' CONFERENCE \
<br> \
<br> \
<br></pre></p></div><p> \
¶1. (C) Charge Urban met with Swiss Foreign Minister Calmy-Rey \
this afternoon at the FM's invitation.  The FM wished to \
clarify remarks she made about the U.S. during her August 21 \
speech to the Swiss ambassadors conference in Bern.  Asked to \
speak first, the Charge noted concerns in Washington over the \
FM's singling out of the United States for criticism in a \
public forum (press had been invited to cover the speech) \
without any mention of the positive aspects of the U.S.-Swiss \
relationship.  She emphasized that it was difficult to \
reconcile the FM's remarks with the several U.S-Swiss \
cooperative efforts and successes of the past year. \
 \
-------------------------- \
"Not Meant as a Criticism" \
-------------------------- \
 \
2.(C) The 45 minute meeting, which included Swiss State \
Secretary (and Political Director) Ambuehl and POL/ECON \
 \
SIPDIS \
Counselor, was extremely cordial, and Calmy-Rey took pains to \
express her concern over the "misunderstanding" that her \
remarks had created.  She blamed this partially on the press, \
noting that her remarks about the United States had been \
taken out of context.  She protested that her remarks were \
perhaps not "la formule la plus elegante" (not the most \
elegant formulation) but that they were simply  "une \
constatation" (statement of fact) and not meant to be taken \
as a criticism or "singling out" of the United States.  She \
was simply trying to lay out the parameters and limits of \
Swiss foreign policy "based on principles of international \
law" to her assembled ambassadors.  Ambuehl added that \
Calmy-Rey had put great emphasis on the U.S.-Swiss \
relationship in previous speeches, and is planning another \
speech in the near future that will focus on the \
relationship, which he noted is based on common values. \
 \
--------------------------- \
Importance of Political MOU \
--------------------------- \
 \
3.(C) Calmy-Rey went on to state that Switzerland needs a \
"coherent foreign policy" with the United States, and \
repeated several times that she was proud of the recently \
signed MOU that provides for enhanced U.S.-Swiss political \
cooperation, and which she counted as one of her personal \
successes.  She emphasized that the MOU framework must be \
"institutionalized as soon as possible" and that she was \
looking forward to an early meeting in Bern between A/S Fried \
and Ambuehl, hopefully at the end of September or in early \
October.  She promised that important topics would be raised, \
and she hoped for positive press coverage to set the record \
straight.  Ambuehl added that Calmy-Rey had already chaired \
two meetings to discuss possible topics for the discussions, \
and that they had developed a good list of substantive \
issues.  He promised to share them with the Embassy soonest \
in order to speed preparation for the high-level meeting. \
 \
¶4. (C) Comment:  Calmy-Rey and Ambuehl obviously realized \
that her recent speech was unbalanced and were extremely \
polite and apologetic.  They were eager to repair any damage \
done and were intent on establishing a positive tone for the \
upcoming talks under the political framework MOU.  Embassy \
will follow up on their proposed "substantive agenda" and \
provide EUR with comments and suggestions.  End comment. \
