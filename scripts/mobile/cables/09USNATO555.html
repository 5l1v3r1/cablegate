¶1. (SBU) This is a request for guidance.  See para 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Several non-NATO troop contributing nations to the 
NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in 
Afghanistan, particularly Australia and New Zealand, have 
pressed for a larger role in the ISAF-related decision 
process at NATO HQ in Brussels.  They have received support 
from a number of Allies, including the UK.  In response to 
these requests, NATO Secretary General Rasmussen distributed 
to Allies on November 23 a non-paper proposing a number of 
pragmatic steps for strengthening in the short-term our 
dialogue and consultation on Afghanistan with non-NATO ISAF 
contributors (see para X below).  He intends to have an 
informal PermRep discussion of the non-paper on Tuesday, 
December 1. 
 
¶3. (C/REL NATO) Recommendations: We strongly support finding 
ways to further involve non-NATO troops contributing nations 
(NNTCNs), while also recognizing that there will be limits to 
how far we can go.  With this in mind, we recommend the 
following response to the Secretary General's proposals: 
 
-- For the foreseeable future, Afghanistan will remain NATO's 
top operational priority and should be discussed at NATO 
ministerials and Summits; 
 
-- If Afghanistan is going to be discussed at a ministerial 
or summit, then the standard operating procedure should be to 
do this in an ISAF-format meeting, with both Allies and 
non-NATO troop contributors; 
 
-- Moreover, any document that is going to be put out in the 
name of ISAF contributors, not NATO, should be negotiated 
from the beginning with non-NATO troop contributors.  Summit 
and Ministerial statements are good examples of when this 
might apply; 
 
-- We recognize that there may be times, however, when 
negotiating "at 45" may be too ponderous and that numbers 
might need to be reduced.  In those cases, we would recommend 
that Allies negotiate with a representative sample of 
non-NATO troop contributors.  This could be accomplished by 
meeting in a format where each Regional Command is 
represented by a non-NATO troop contributing nation.  We 
could, therefore, meet "at 33" (28 Allies, plus 5 NNTCNs 
representing the Regional Commands), rather than at 45.  The 
NNTCN representation within each Regional Command would 
rotate. 
 
-- We oppose the proposal in the non-paper of a Troika.  This 
was proposed by the UK and seems to be intended to ensure the 
long-term involvement of Australia and New Zealand, but would 
run the serious risk of creating divisions by appearing to 
set a "two-tier standard" for involvement of non-NATO troops 
contributors.  In a November 27 meeting with Ambassador 
Daalder, the Australian and New Zealand Ambassadors 
acknowledged this and said that they were planning to tell 
the UK they opposed the proposal.  (Note: They also indicated 
that they were extremely happy with the paper overall.) 
 
-- We must continue to maintain the distinction between 
non-NATO troops contributors and other partners, such as 
Russia, who do not contribute troops. 
 
¶4. (C) RFG: Unless otherwise directed, Ambassador Daalder 
intends to draw from the recommendations in para three above 
during the December 1 PermRep discussion. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The text of the SecGen's non-paper (which was 
e-mailed to EUR/RPM) is reproduced below:

BEGIN TEXT 
 
ISAF Decision Making -- Involving the Non-NATO Contributing 
Nations 
 
¶1. At Bratislava, several Defence Ministers of non-NATO ISAF 
contributing nations intervened strongly on the issue of 
consultation and involvement in the development of policy 
documents. While actions have been taken in recent months to 
strengthen their involvement, a number of these nations 
remain dissatisfied with current arrangements. This non-paper 
sets out pragmatic and quick to implement proposals for 
improved dialogue and consultation with regard only to the 
ISAF operation. In the longer term we might wish to consider 
whether the Political-Military Framework for NATO-Led 
Partnership for Peace Operations needs to be revised. 
 
¶2. Council Meetings. One of the most vocal complaints of 
non-NATO ISAF partners is a lack of early involvement in 
issues of interest, associated with a compressed timescale 
for them to consider issues in capitals. While an increasing 
number of ISAF issues are discussed in ISAF format, we could 
do more. Our default position should be that key ISAF 
decisions are from the outset discussed formally in ISAF 
format. This will require the scheduling of additional 
meetings in this format (Council, Policy Coordination Group, 
Military Committee, Working Groups, etc.), but it provides an 
opportunity which should be well received by non-NATO ISAF 
partners, and which can be implemented immediately. We will 
also need to consider the handling of such issues in an 
informal setting. Frequently, key issues are discussed in a 
luncheon (or similar) format before placing them on the 
agenda for regular Council meetings. The consequence of this 
is that ideas can become crystallized before they are 
discussed in a formal setting, and non-NATO ISAF partners can 
be left with the impression that they are being presented 
with a fait accompli. We should therefore also consider 
holding informal Council discussions in ISAF format when key 
issues justify this. On the other hand, we should not exclude 
that some issues related to our engagement in Afghanistan 
would be sensitive to the Alliance's interests as such and 
that Allies therefore would need to discuss such issues at 
¶28. This may particularly be the case as the group of 
non-NATO ISAF contributing nations continues to widen, both 
geographically and politically. 
 
¶3. Ministerial Meetings and Summits. It is increasingly the 
case that high-level meetings of the Council are scheduled in 
ISAF format. This should be the norm, at least while the 
tempo of the mission remains at current levels. However, we 
need to consider also the involvement of other stakeholders 
in these meetings. The presence of EU, UN and Afghan 
authorities is important, but there is a risk that discussion 
will be inhibited in the presence of these players. We should 
consider scheduling Ministerial meetings where attendance is 
limited only to Allies and non-NATO ISAF partners. This in 
itself would be a strong signal to our partners. We would 
need, however, to schedule a further session in an expanded 
format when the inclusion of other stakeholders was 
considered necessary. 
 
¶4. Development of Policy Documents. Once again, committee 
procedures have already been adapted to be more inclusive. 
However, while non-NATO ISAF partners are kept well informed 
throughout this process, they are not invited to contribute 
formally until an issue is agreed 'at 28'. It is seldom the 
case that comments subsequently provided by non-NATO ISAF 
contributors require us to re-open an issue, but this could 
be partly due to a reluctance on the behalf of our partners 
to delay the process. We should therefore consider inviting 
input from non-NATO ISAF contributors throughout the 
development process while Allies' deliberations are going on.

This would strengthen the principles of transparency and 
inclusion of the Political-Military Framework, and it would 
reflect the importance of non-NATO involvement in the ISAF 
mission. And it could be a pragmatic start from which we will 
gain experience for a potential subsequent revision of the 
Political-Military Framework. 
 
¶5. Improved Information Sharing. There will inevitably be 
issues that come up at 28, either by circumstance, or by 
necessity. We should institute a system of prompt ex post 
facto briefings to inform non-NATO contributing nations when 
this occurs, probably delivered by the Assistant Secretary 
General for Operations. We might also elevate the current 
regular informal working level meetings that the Assistant 
Secretary General for Operations currently holds with 
non-NATO contributors to Ambassadorial level from time to 
time. 
 
¶6. A Non-NATO 'Troika'. It has been suggested that a smaller 
group of non-NATO nations might be formed as a conduit for 
information flow regarding Afghanistan. This concept might 
see a single representative nation, supported by two others 
on a rotational basis. Arguably, this would be less 
cumbersome, and logistically easier than holding meetings 'at 
43'. A variation on this idea might be to have each of the 
Regional Commands represented by a single non-NATO 
Contributing Nation. But there are dangers here. Could such a 
group be truly representative of 'the 15', and would it be 
seen as divisive? By definition, some nations would receive 
key information before others, and this is likely to generate 
a 'them and us' split within the group of partners. 
 
¶7. In summary, we have improved our consultation with 
non-NATO ISAF partners considerably over the recent years; 
but it is clear that a number of these nations feel strongly 
that we could do more. The steps outlined above are 
consistent with our aspiration for full transparency and 
involvement, and would be seen as a pragmatic approach which 
addresses concerns raised at Bratislava and elsewhere. In 
addition, they are quick deliverables. There are potential 
implications for the wider Political Military Framework, but 
they will have to be addressed at a later stage.
