Istanbul. 
 
¶2. (C) Summary.  Turkey's Religious Affairs Directorate 
(Diyanet) recently described two outreach initiatives 
targetting Turkey's Alevi community.  The new programs 
include more in-depth training on Alevism for Sunni religious 
officials, government sponsored trips to Europe for Alevi 
religious leaders to support Alevi education and plans to 
publish a definitive Alevi history.  Our Alevi contacts 
criticized GOT efforts as insincere and charged that they 
fall considerably short of achieving the equality of faith 
they seek.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Diyanet's Efforts at Alevi Outreach 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.(SBU) Turkey's estimated 15 to 20 million Alevis have 
several long-standing disputes with the GOT, not least of 
which are assessments of the community's size, which the GOT 
asserts is seven million (ref B).  Far from a cohesive group, 
Alevis hold diverse opinions concerning religious identity. 
The government considers Alevism to be a heterodox Muslim 
sect, however most Alevis view their faith as distinct from 
Sunni Islam.  Their most pressing demands are equal treatment 
in public school religion courses and in the allocation of 
government resources for the construction and administration 
of Alevi gathering places (cem evi). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Diyanet Foreign Relations Vice Chair Mehmet Gormez 
recently told us that the Diyanet is increasing its outreach 
efforts to Alevis to dispel the notion that the Diyanet is an 
exclusively Sunni organization.  Gormez said the Diyanet has 
incorporated materials on Alevi history, traditions, and 
principles in its training programs for government-appointed 
muftis (religious officials) in Turkey and abroad.  The 
education effort, according to Gormez, is part of Diyanet 
President Ali Bardakoglu's effort to "broaden the Diyanet 
tent" by helping muftis better address Alevi concerns. 
 
5.(SBU) Gormez told us the Diyanet bases its Alevism 
teachings on academic findings made over four years of 
studying original Alevite sources.  Based on its rigorous 
academic research, the Diyanet plans to publish a written 
record of Alevi history that will prevent distortions of 
Alevi principles for political gain.  The Diyanet recently 
published the first three (of 17) books of Alevi writings 
with Turkish translations.  Gormez said the Diyanet will send 
these books to all its Muftis and sell them in its bookstores. 
 
6.(SBU) The Diyanet also recently began a program to send 
Alevi Elders (Dedes) to Europe to assist in Alevi education 
efforts, Gormez said.  At the request of three Alevi 
associations in Germany, the Diyanet sent several Dedes to 
Germany to participate in conferences, speaking engagements, 
and other educational efforts held at cem houses.  Most 
Alevis responded positively, Gormez said, and the Diyanet 
plans to continue the effort.  Some "radical" Alevi 
organizations rejected the program, claiming it will hinder 
efforts to promote their own versions and approaches to 
Alevism, according to Gormez. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Alevis Remain Unimpressed, Critical of Diyanet 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7.(C) Alevi contacts and academic experts criticized the 
Diyanet's efforts as insincere and hypocritical.  Pir Sultan 
Abdal Alevi Association President Kazim Genc told us the 
Diyanet remains an exclusive, discriminatory Sunni 
organization.  The Diyanet employs only Sunnis, and only 
meets with Alevi groups that share its views, he said. 
Middle East Technical University (METU) Anthropology 
professor Aydan Erdemir, Turkey's foremost expert on Alevi 
issues, agreed.  He told us the Diyanet has never asked to 
 
ANKARA 00000747  002 OF 002 
 
 
speak to a diverse set of Alevi organizations in order to 
avoid hearing conflicting views.  "This discriminatory 
attitude discredits and delegitimizes the Diyanet's efforts," 
Erdemir stated. 
 
8.(C) Alevis also resent the Diyanet's attempts to publish an 
authoritative interpretation of Alevism.  According to Genc, 
there is no grassroots Alevi demand for the Diyanet to 
publish what it believes to be the authoritative version of 
Alevism.  Such an "absurd" idea was akin to the Catholic 
Church publishing an authoritative Orthodox canon to explain 
to Orthodox Christians the true, correct meaning of Orthodox 
writings.  Professor Erdemir told us the Diyanet's research 
and publishing endeavor showed a "shocking" level of 
ignorance of Alevi theology because it ignores the fact that 
most Alevis value oral tradition much more than written 
texts.  The Diyanet's teaching of "truths" based on written 
text was based on a faulty premise, he explained. 
 
9.(C)  Genc and Erdemir both found the Diyanet's labeling of 
certain Alevi groups as "radical" unacceptable.  The Diyanet 
labels as "radical" any group that advocates a position 
distant from Sunni teachings or opposed to the interests of 
the Diyanet, Genc said.  Erdemir charged that the Diyanet has 
no authority or mandate to label different factions within 
non-Sunni religious groups in a pejorative manner. 
 
10.(C) Comment:  Many of Turkey's Alevis have long found it 
offensive that the GOT does not recognize them as a distinct 
relgious group or allow them to freely practice their 
religion.  They do not buy the Diyanet's outreach attempts, 
which they see as window-dressing to placate the EU's demand 
for more tolerance toward Alevis.  The Diyanet's attempts at 
inclusivity are at least a positive step, but the depth of 
the Alevi reaction illustrates how wide the gap remains.  The 
GOT will not placate many Alevis until it recognizes their 
faith as a distinct, official religion.  Rather than 
interpreting Alevi doctrine, Alevis want the government to 
treat Alevism equally in public school religion courses and 
in the allocation of public funds for the construction and 
administration of cem houses.  End comment.
