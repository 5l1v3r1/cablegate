(C) HMG concurs with points contained in U.S. nonpaper (ref a) on the need for ISAF nations to provide enhanced security assistance in the run-up to and during the 2009 Afghan Presidential election.  FCO Afghanistan Office Director Matthew Lodge said that the UK is currently engaged in a cross-departmental policy examination of the British security and civilian presence in Afghanistan, the result of which will be a Cabinet endorsed paper to be released sometime in mid-to-late January 2009.  Lodge was unsure if the paper would be ready in time for the January force generation conference, but promised to keep us apprised on its progress.  
</p><p>¶2.  (C)  Lodge said that the mid-March RC-South meeting to be hosted by the British in London would provide a good opportunity to encourage more burdensharing among coalition members.  He suggested that a U.S./UK bilateral in Washington prior to the RC-S meeting would be useful to ensure Washington and London's policies and priorities were in synch.  Per ref b, we followed up with Lodge to suggest early March as the optimal time for such a meeting.  He will inform us of exact dates and proposed British attendees in early January 2009.
