¶2.  (C) Text of the letter to the above eight individuals follows 
below: 
 
February 4, 2008 
 
Dear (Name): 
 
This is to notify you that indications you may be involved in 
supporting, inciting, and perpetrating inter-ethnic violence in Kenya 
are relevant to your and your family's eligibility for U.S. visas. 
 
The U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act provides for the denial of 
visas to individuals for a variety of reasons.  The U.S. Department 
of State reserves the right to make such a determination and reserves 
the right to suspend action on a visa application until such time 
that a determination of an individual's visa eligibility can be made. 
 
We request any and all information from you in writing detailing your 
efforts to promote an end to violence and the achievement of 
political and ethnic reconciliation in Kenya. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
Michael E. Ranneberger 
Ambassador 
 
¶3.  (C) Post will convey identical letters to additional individuals 
in Kenya as warranted.
