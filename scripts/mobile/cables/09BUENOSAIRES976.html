</p><p>¶1. (C) Summary: CDA met August 24 with Minister of Economy 
</p><p>and Public Finances Amado Boudou and discussed the upcoming 
</p><p>G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh, Argentina's re-engagement with the 
</p><p>IMF, an agreement with Paris Club debtors and bond holdouts, 
</p><p>as well as Argentina's fiscal and economic outlook.  Not 
</p><p>surprisingly, Boudou was generally upbeat about Argentina's 
</p><p>current economic situation and prospects in the coming year. 
</p><p>While Argentina wants to regain access to the international 
</p><p>credit markets and hopes to have an agreement with the IMF 
</p><p>and its Paris Club creditors by year's end, Boudou stressed 
</p><p>that Argentina is under no fiscal pressure to do so but 
</p><p>rather is doing so in order to help lower borrowing costs for 
</p><p>Argentine producers and stimulate employment.  End Summary. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (C) CDA, accompanied by EconCouns, opened the meeting by 
</p><p>asking Boudou (who was alone) Argentina's perspective on the 
</p><p>upcoming G-20 Summit.  Boudou noted that he will be attending 
</p><p>the meeting next week of G-20 finance ministers in London in 
</p><p>preparation for the September 24-25 G-20 Summit in 
</p><p>Pittsburgh.  He said that Argentina is going into the meeting 
</p><p>with a fairly strong financial and fiscal position.  The 
</p><p>level of public debt is low; the Government has easily met 
</p><p>its relatively low debt servicing obligations, and will 
</p><p>continue to do so through 2010; and the GoA's fiscal and bank 
</p><p>liquidity situation is ""very good.""  Boudou said that the 
</p><p>government's strategy now is to lower the opportunity and 
</p><p>borrowing costs for private sector producers through lower 
</p><p>interest rates which can be achieved if Argentina has access 
</p><p>to international credit markets. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (C) CDA asked if reaching an accommodation with the IMF is 
</p><p>part of the GOA strategy.  Boudou said that the GOA wants to 
</p><p>normalize relations with the IMF, including a possible 
</p><p>Article IV review by year-end, so long as the review does not 
</p><p>include IMF prescriptions/conditionality.  Boudou said that 
</p><p>the GOA also wants to re-engage with EXIM and other foreign 
</p><p>export credit agencies, recognizing this will require working 
</p><p>with the U.S. and other official creditors to clear 
</p><p>Argentina's Paris Club arrears through either 
</p><p>(IMF-sanctioned) rescheduling or other means which Argentina 
</p><p>hopes to achieve by the end of the year.  Boudou confirmed 
</p><p>recent press reports that the GOA is also discussing ways to 
</p><p>reach a settlement with the private bond holdouts. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (C) Boudou stressed that, while Argentina very much 
</p><p>welcomes new foreign investment and access to foreign capital 
</p><p>that will boost Argentine employment, the GOA is under little 
</p><p>fiscal or economic pressure to do so.  While 2009 will be a 
</p><p>bad year, with zero economic growth, Boudou said the GoA 
</p><p>forecasts growth between 3-4 percent in 2010, giving 
</p><p>Argentina positive growth in seven out of the last eight 
</p><p>years.  CDA asked if reports of fiscal problems in the 
</p><p>provincial budgets were true.  Boudou said the situation in 
</p><p>some of the provinces has deteriorated, blaming them for 
</p><p>building up their payrolls unsustainably.  He contrasted this 
</p><p>with the GoA's ""more responsible"" countercyclical approach, 
</p><p>which he claimed had boosted aggregate demand during this 
</p><p>recessive period through increased public investment rather 
</p><p>than via current expenditures.  He said the GOA would not 
</p><p>authorize provincial governments to issue bonds as a way out 
</p><p>of the mess, noting that he intended to turn down such a 
</p><p>request by Cordoba, the country's second-most-populous 
</p><p>province.  (Officially, that request is pending.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) On the issue of inflation, Boudou said that there has 
</p><p>been an overemphasis on data in Buenos Aires that indicates 
</p><p>continued upward pressure on prices for higher value goods. 
</p><p>Boudou said that GoA data shows that, as is historically 
</p><p>true, prices remain stable in most of the provinces outside 
</p><p>Buenos Aires, as well as for lower value goods generally, 
</p><p>meaning that rising inflation has not adversely impacted 
</p><p>Argentines at the lower end of the wage scale.  Boudou also 
</p><p>noted that the Argentine Central Bank (BCRA) has a monetary 
</p><p>plan in place to ensure price stability. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (C) Comment: Now a month in office, Boudou seemed much 
</p><p>more loquacious and confident than his predecessor, Carlos 
</p><p>Fernandez, and more comfortable in his skin than Martin 
</p><p>Lousteau, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's first Economic 
</p><p>Minister.  He came across as a poised, confident interlocutor 
</p><p>who is eager to engage on resolving the legacy issues that 
</p><p>stand in the way of Argentina returning to the international 
</p><p>credit and capital markets.  He'll need those skills and more 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>as he attempts to sell economic policies that are broadly 
</p><p>seen as negligent and irresponsible.  Boudou's optimism 
</p><p>contrasts sharply with new reports that the GoA's fiscal 
</p><p>situation continues to decline along with an economy now 
</p><p>firmly in recession, and highlighted by Lousteau in an August 
</p><p>24 television interview in which he described the GoA as in 
</p><p>denial over the deteriorating fiscal/financial situation. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C) Boudou must perform a delicate balancing act to 
</p><p>achieve the rapprochement with capital markets that he 
</p><p>professes to want.  He needs to constructively engage key 
</p><p>foreign interlocutors, including the Fund, the Paris Club, 
</p><p>and the hold-outs, without losing the confidence of his de 
</p><p>facto boss, Nestor Kirchner.  Given that dilemma, his rosy 
</p><p>presentation of Argentina's fiscal and economic situation was 
</p><p>not surprising, nor was his assertion, in classic Kirchner 
</p><p>style, that Argentina is ready to deal, but only on its terms 
</p><p>and without pre-conditions.  But Boudou's charm offensive 
</p><p>with international capital markets is clearly on.  The GoA 
</p><p>press line was that the meeting with the CDA was part of the 
</p><p>GoA's newly launched campaign to rejoin international capital 
</p><p>markets, and this campaign will likely be its theme at 
</p><p>upcoming G-20 meetings.  Boudou is also meeting this week 
</p><p>with IMF Director Western Hemisphere Director (and former 
</p><p>Chilean Finance Minister) Nicolas Eyzaguirre on the margins 
</p><p>of a Council of Americas meeting in Buenos Aires which the 
</p><p>GoA is publicly promoting.  End Comment
