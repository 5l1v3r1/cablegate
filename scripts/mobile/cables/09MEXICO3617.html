¶1. (C) Reftel provided a summary of the GOM's plans to make 
the federal police the coordinating force for security 
operations in Ciudad Juarez, with the military playing a 
supporting role.  On December 22, Facundo Rosas Rosas, chief 
of the federal police force (SSP) under Public Security 
Secretary Garcia Luna, provided the AMB and Embassy staff 
with an update of the GOM's plans. Rosas said that 1600 
federal police had already been deployed to Juarez. No formal 
announcement has yet been made by President Calderon. Mostly 
likely, the formal announcement will be deferred into the new 
year, once the new security arrangements are fully in place 
and operational. Facundo Rosas will remain the point person 
coordinating the new operational arrangements on behalf of 
the federal police. A new command structure is being created 
under SSP state representative Vidal Diaz Leal Ochoa. 
¶2. (C) Rosas told us that four areas of operation have been 
created for the security forces in Juarez: 
-- Street patrols in high-crime areas: The municipal police 
will be concentrated in these neighborhoods. In some 
instances, SEDENA will be patrolling with the municipal 
police, but only until the point that there is sufficient 
municipal police capacity to take on all preventive controls, 
without the support of SEDENA. 
-- Black holes or hot spots: These are areas with a large 
preponderance of bars, billiard halls, strip clubs, and 
prostitution houses. Rosas characterized these as the areas 
where drugs and arms are traded and deals are cut. Patrolling 
these areas, investigating operations in these 
establishments, using legal authorities to shut down 
operations, and acting against criminal operations, would be 
the principal responsibility of the federal police working in 
close coordination with the Procurator General. 
-- Extortion and kidnapping: Federal police has already sent 
a strong contingent of investigators that will be built up 
eventually to a total of 500. The contingent will include 
negotiators and analysts; operations will be based out of the 
C4 (command, control, coordination and communications) Center 
in Juarez. Federal police will lead this effort. The intent 
is to reach out to victims and seek their cooperation in 
investigations and prosecutions. Rosas said the federal 
police will be working closely with the Procurator General's 
office. 
--High-value targets: Action against high-value targets will 
be based out of the recently created UNITO (tactical 
operations unit), which is based out of SEDENA's military 
base in Juarez. All federal security agencies will continue 
to participate in coordinating activities against high-value 
targets. SEDENA will be expected to concentrate most of its 
activities in this area as well as in securing transit routes 
in and out of the city. 
¶3. (C) Rosas also indicated that federal police recognizes 
that it must coordinate with parts of the government running 
socioeconomic programs in order to reduce incentives for the 
unemployed and disaffected to join the narcotraffickers. From 
the discussions with Rosas as well as others, it is clear 
that this part of the agenda in Juarez still requires the 
greatest degree of additional planning.
