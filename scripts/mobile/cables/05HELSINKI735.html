 ¶1.  (U)  This is an action request, please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (S)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Finnish 
officials from the MFA's Middle-East Bureau and 
Non-Proliferation Unit.  The officials were unaware of the 
MOU cited in reftel and said that they would need to 
investigate the issue further before responding.  They said 
that Finland in general shared US concerns about Iranian 
nuclear proliferation, strongly supported ongoing EU-3 
efforts to reach agreement with Iran, and understood US 
concerns about possible transfers of BW technologies to the 
Iranians.  The Finns did not know what the reference in 
reftel points to the "Academy of Finland" referred to. 
 
¶3.  (S)  Action Request:  The fourth bullet in reftel talking 
points states that IROST signed a memorandum of understanding 
for scientific cooperation with the Academy of Finland. 
Finnish MFA officials did not know what institution this 
referred to.  Post requests clarification on exactly what 
institution signed the MOU with the Iranians.  It would be 
most helpful to have the Finnish name of the institution in 
question.
