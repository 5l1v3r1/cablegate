¶1. (S)  SUMMARY: Nearly 48 hours after Chavez ordered ten 
battalions to the Colombian border, there has been only small 
scale movements of troops or equipment from major combat 
units.  Less than 12 light tanks or armored fighting vehicles 
have been seen preparing for movement at Carora in the 
western state of Lara and at Fuerte Mara in the border state 
of Zulia.  Despite confident interviews by the commanding 
general in the local press, no units of the IV Armored 
Division - including the presumably highly mobile 42nd 
Parachute Brigade - have deployed. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Fuerte Mara, First to Fight? 
---------------------------- 
¶2. (S) Fuerte Mara in Zulia is 55 kilometers from the 
Colombian border.  Local press reported seeing six light 
tanks on flatbed trucks entering Fuerte Mara on the afternoon 
of March 3, followed by a convoy of soldiers in trucks a few 
hours later.  Maracaibo contacts also reported OV-10 Bronco 
aircraft flying over the city.  Other sources identified the 
armor as French AMX-13 light tanks.  Fuerte Mara is home to 
the "Apure Braves" Armored Battalion, the 112 Mechanized 
Infantry Battalion and the 105 Engineering Battalion of the 
First Infantry Division. 
 
Carora 
------- 
¶3. (S) The Carora barracks are 300 Km from the border in the 
western state of Lara.  Sources report five French-made 
AMX-30 main battle tanks and accompanying cargo trucks were 
being made ready for transport.  The front page of a 
Venezuelan tabloid showed two British-made Spartan Armored 
Fighting Vehicles (AFV) with "Lara" markings on a commercial 
trailer.  (Note:  Modern tanks and AFVs are trucked to the 
front, saving fuel as well as wear and tear on the vehicles 
treads.  A shortage of Heavy Equipment Transporters (HET) in 
the Army will restrict their ability to move units quickly. 
End Note) 
 
Other Units 
----------- 
¶4. (S) According to the local press, units of Venezuela's IV 
Division in Valencia and Maracay have executed a recall order 
bringing troops in from leave.  Although General Tineo Pena 
told the local press that "they are on alert" he said they 
were awaiting further orders.  Other sources report about 30 
tanks and AFVs are being prepared for movement.  There has 
been no indication of movement at the 42nd Parachute Brigade. 
 
¶5. (C) Comment:  A lack of training, rehearsal and failure to 
invest in unglamorous military equipment like trailers and 
cargo planes has slowed the Venezuelan military's 
mobilization. This may explain the lack of patriotic visuals, 
from this otherwise propaganda savvy leader, of troops 
marching to the front.  End Comment.
