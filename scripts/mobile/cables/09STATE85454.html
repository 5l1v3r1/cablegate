¶1.  (C)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS GREATLY APPRECIATED THE 
INFORMATION PROVIDED IN REFTEL AND PREVIOUS REPORTING 
PERTAINING TO POLICE VIEWS ON THE ERGENEKON INVESTIGATION AND TRIAL PROCESS.  WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE ERGENEKON PROCESS AS THIS REMAINS A TOPIC OF HIGH POLICYMAKER INTEREST.  WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION POSTS CAN PROVIDE REGARDING VIEWS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE TURKISH GENERAL 
STAFF (TGS) RELATED TO ERGENEKON, AS TIME, RESOURCES, AND CURRENT WORKLOAD PERMIT. WE ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN ANY ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS POSTS CAN PROVIDE ON THE QUESTIONS BELOW.  THANK YOU. 
 
¶A.  (C)  TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE TGS OR OTHER PARTS OF THE 
MILITARY, SUCH AS THE NAVY, INVOLVED WITH THE ERGENEKON 
NETWORK? 
 
¶B.  (C)  WHAT IS THE TGS' ATTITUDE TOWARD THE INVESTIGATION? TO WHAT EXTENT DO THEY FEAR THE INVESTIGATION IS GROWING AND/OR MOVING BEYOND THEIR ABILITIES TO INFLUENCE IT? 
 
¶C.  (C)  WHAT INDICATIONS, IF ANY, WOULD SUGGEST THAT TGS 
MEMBERS ARE AWARE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INVESTIGATION THAT ARE NOT YET PUBLIC? HOW DOES THE TGS KEEP INFORMED OF THE ERGENEKON TRIAL AND RELATED DEVELOPMENTS? 
 
¶D.  (C)  WHAT, IF ANY, BACK-CHANNEL DISCUSSIONS, MEETINGS, OR NEGOTIATIONS RELATED TO ERGENEKON ARE TAKING PLACE BETWEEN TGS LEADERSHIP AND THE JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (AKP)? 
 
¶E.  (C)  AT WHAT POINT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ERGENEKON 
INVESTIGATION OR RELATED ISSUES WOULD THE TGS OR ELEMENTS THEREOF BE LIKELY TO INTERVENE IN SOME WAY IN THE AKP GOVERNMENT? WHAT SHAPE WOULD SUCH AN INTERVENTION TAKE? 
 
¶F.  (C)  WHAT IS TGS CHIEF ILKER BASBUG'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE INVESTIGATIONS?  WHAT, IF ANY, INDICATIONS WOULD INDICATE THAT BASBUG APPROVES OF THE INVESTIGATION AND/OR IS TRYING TO USE THE INVESTIGATION TO ENHANCE HIS OWN AUTHORITY OR OTHERWISE "CLEAN HOUSE" WITHIN TGS AND THE HIGH COMMAND? WHAT INDICATIONS, IF ANY, WOULD SUGGEST THAT HE IS TRYING TO IMPEDE OR STOP IT? 
 
¶G.  (C)  WHAT INDICATIONS, IF ANY, WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT BASBUG MIGHT TRY TO MAKE HIS OWN DEAL WITH PROSECUTORS TO AVOID ACCUSATIONS OF CORRUPTION OR ASSOCIATION WITH ERGENEKON ACTIVITIES?  WHAT ARE BASBUG'S VIEWS ON CORRUPTION? 
 
¶H.  (C)  TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE TGS CONCERNED THAT FORMER TGS CHIEFS HILMI OZKOK OR YASAR BUYUKANIT MIGHT BE COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATORS?

REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
