¶1.  (C) SUMMARY.  On April 13, Ambassador Wayne and Interior 
Minister Anibal Fernandez met to review the broad range of 
bilateral security cooperation. Ambassador noted success of 
Operation ""Todo Inclusivo,"" a DEA-supported effort to target 
cocaine trafficking out of Ezeiza airport and Fernandez 
reported that the GoA will be unveiling a series of decrees 
in the following week to enhance counternarcotics efforts. 
The Ambassador noted the importance of showing concrete 
progress in the fight against trafficking in person and the 
Minister said he would work to get pending legislation passed 
before he and First Lady Cristina Kirchner travel to the U.S. 
in early May (reported septel). They discussed nuclear 
terrorism training, airport security issues, and moving 
forward with the stalled Megaports Initiative.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------- 
Trafficking in Persons 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) On April 13, Ambassador held one of his regular 
meeting with Minister of Interior Anibal Fernandez to review 
our varied bilateral security agenda.  The Ambassador noted 
that the Department was in the process of preparing its 
annual TIP report.  He explained that Argentine Susana 
Trimarco, recent recipient of the Secretary's International 
Woman of Courage Award, had raised awareness of the TIP issue 
in Argentina and that much attention was being focused on the 
country.  Ambassador stressed that it was important to 
continue to show concrete progress and that progress would be 
good before Argentine First Lady Cristina Kirchner and 
Fernandez visited Washington on May 3-4.  Fernandez noted 
that, following last year's TIP report and Argentina's 
downgrading to Tier II Watchlist, he had become personally 
involved in the TIP issue, creating a special victims 
attention unit in his Ministry.  He said that he expected the 
Lower House to complete deliberations on pending TIP 
legislation soon, and said he would push to get the 
legislation passed before he and the First Lady made their 
planned trip to the U.S. in early May.  (Additional TIP 
reporting SEPTEL). 
 
---------------- 
Counternarcotics 
---------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Ambassador applauded a DEA-supported, Argentine 
inter-agency effort (Operation ""Todo Inclusivo"") targeting 
drug trafficking from Buenos Aires' Ezeiza international 
airport to Spain.  Although information is still being 
compiled, the operation netted numerous arrests and cocaine 
seizures and was a good example of Mission efforts to 
encourage Argentine interagency cooperation, in this case 
between Customs and Airport Police (PSA). 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Fernandez said that the government will unveil 
eight counternarcotics presidential decrees (executive 
orders) in the next week designed to strengthen 
narcotrafficking investigations, better control the diversion 
of precursor chemicals, establish and strengthen 
investigative laboratories and establish a number of common 
databases.   Fernandez also said the government will announce 
plans to establish two new drug testing labs in Misiones and 
Salta Provinces and is close to completing a bilateral 
counternarcotics agreement with Spain.  He added that the MOI 
is moving forward on a memorandum of understanding with the 
Health Ministry that will draw on the latter's expertise to 
study and test the quality of interdicted illegal drugs 
before destroying them.  The Ambassador applauded the 
Minister for his continuing efforts to better coordinate 
Argentina's four security forces' counternarcotics efforts. 
The Minister indicated that the GoA would continue to 
emphasize the importance of bilateral counterdrug 
initiatives, and underscored that cooperation in these areas 
has been outstanding.  At the Ambassador's invitation, 
Fernandez also indicated that representatives from the 
Argentine Federal Police and the Gendarmeria would attend an 
international drug enforcement conference in Madrid in May. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
ATA Training, CT, Megaports and Airport Security 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5.  (C) On counterterrorism, Fernandez was again enthusiastic 
about current and future bilateral cooperation.  He said his 
government would happily receive the Anti-Terrorism 
Assistance (ATA) program team in late June or early July and 
expressed gratitude for USG police training assistance.  The 
minister said he was also eager to meet with Tom Fuentes, 
Agent In Charge, FBI Office of International Operations and 
member of the Interpol Executive Committee, when Fuentes is 
in town April 30th.  The Ambassador encouraged the Minister 
to send, along with Argentine security peronnel, members of 
Argentina's national intelligence and nuclear regulatory 
agencies to an FBI nuclear terrorism conference in June. 
Fernandez indicated he would consider the suggestion. 
 
¶6.  (C) Fernandez also expressed GoA intentions to 
collaborate on Megaports and aviation issues.  The Ambassador 
reiterated that the U.S. DOE is anxious to move forward on 
Megaports cooperation.  Fernandez said Argentine Customs will 
take the lead on Megaports, and the MoI will play a 
supporting role (see reftel for more details).  He added that 
the government just bought eight new mobile scanners to 
improve Customs' inspection capabilities.  Regarding airport 
security, the Ambassador also thanked Fernandez for the GoA's 
flexibility and understanding in extending PSA coverage for 
inspecting baggage an extra 30 days while U.S. and other 
carriers identified suitable private companies to perform 
cargo and baggage screening.  The Minister replied that he 
was glad to help and noted that working with the Airport 
Police Director Marcelo Sain, whom Fernandez characterized as 
like ""an elephant on amphetamines in a bazaar,"" was very 
difficult.  Fernandez also said the GoA has approved USD40 
million to invest in airport security this year.
