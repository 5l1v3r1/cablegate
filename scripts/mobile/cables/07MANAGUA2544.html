¶1. (C) According to a November 28 circular memo sent to all 
airlines operating out of Managua's international airport, 
the Government of Nicaragua (GON) now will allow all Libyan 
and Iranian passport holders (diplomatic, official and 
regular) to enter Nicaragua without visas.  The GON states 
that it is making the change "to deepen ties with brother 
nations" and because Nicaragua does not have diplomatic 
missions in these countries.  An unofficial translation of 
the memo follows in para. 4. 
 
2 (S) Nicaragua coordinates its visa policy with Guatemala, 
El Salvador, and Honduras as part of the "Central American 
Four" (C-4) agreement, which permits border crossing with 
minimal documentation.  The GON had been discussing with the 
other C-4 nations its proposal to permit diplomatic and 
official passport holders from Iran and Libya to enter 
Nicaragua without a visa.  NOTE: The GON's proposal met with 
some resistance inside the C-4, including Honduran media 
reports that Iranians were entering Honduras illegally after 
flying into Nicaragua without any immigration checks.  END 
NOTE. 
 
¶3. (S) COMMENT: Over the past several months, there have been 
confirmed incidents of Iranians, mainly on official visits or 
using official passports, being waved through Nicaraguan 
customs and immigration at the airport with no checks at all. 
 However, this formal announcement and its inclusion of 
Iranian and Libyan regular passport holders was unexpected. 
This announcement is the latest in a series of steps by the 
Ortega Administration to deepen and expand relations with 
countries of concern, especially Iran, Libya and Venezuela. 
The growing lack of transparency by this government in all 
areas, coupled with Ortega's express intent to expand ties 
with Iran, and support for Iran's defiance of the 
international community, raise the likelihood that this new 
move will make Nicaragua a convenient entry point to the 
region for Iran as it seeks to expand its influence and 
operations in the Hemisphere. 
 
¶4. (C) UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION OF DGME CIRCULAR 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
TO:  Airlines operating out of the Augusto Cesar Sandino 
International Airport 
 
FROM: Captain Lenin Flores Aleman, Migration Office 
 
SUBJECT: DGME/MANS Circular 182/11/2007 
 
DATE: Managua, November 28, 2007 
 
Following the instructions of the Director General for 
Migration, Commandante Maria Antonieta Novoa, I have the 
honor to present to you Circular DGME/MANS/182/11/2007 which 
says: 
 
Reaffirming the will of the Government of Reconciliation and 
National Unity to deepen ties of fraternity with brother 
countries, which are providing valuable cooperation 
unconditionally and in a sustainable manner to our people, 
 
 
MANAGUA 00002544  002 OF 002 
 
 
That the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation has 
established, as a policy of the State, the facilitation of 
entry into the National Territory of citizens of these 
brother countries. 
 
The strengthening of relations with countries of the world 
who are lovers of peace and progress is a priority of our 
Government, and taking into consideration that the lack of 
diplomatic representation in these countries makes their 
travel to Nicaragua difficult, established: 
 
First: Nationals of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 
Grand Al-Jamahiria Arab Popular Socialist Libya, carrying 
diplomatic, service, official or regular passports, move from 
category "C" to category "A," exempt from the visa 
requirement. 
 
Second: This circular shall be made known to all airlines and 
national border posts for their immediate application.
