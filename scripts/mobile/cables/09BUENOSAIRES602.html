</p><p>¶1.  (C) Summary.  On May 20, the Ambassador paid a farewell 
</p><p>call on Minister of Justice Anibal Fernandez and thanked him 
</p><p>for the Ministry of Justice's (MoJ) collaboration in 
</p><p>promoting human rights and addressing international crime, 
</p><p>including drug trafficking, trafficking in persons (TIP), 
</p><p>money laundering, and terrorism finance.  The Minister 
</p><p>thanked the Ambassador for the USG's excellent cooperation in 
</p><p>law enforcement issues and noted the progress the Government 
</p><p>of Argentina (GoA) is making in fighting TIP and drugs.  He 
</p><p>accepted the Ambassador's offers of additional training 
</p><p>opportunities in the area of bulk cash smuggling and 
</p><p>hostage-taking crisis management as well as proposed 
</p><p>counterdrug bilateral exchanges sponsored by Southern 
</p><p>Command.  The Ambassador informed Fernandez that he would 
</p><p>soon sign in a low-profile ceremony with Central Bank 
</p><p>President Redrado an agreement to provide technical 
</p><p>assistance to Argentine regulators, focused on enhancing the 
</p><p>prevention and detection of terrorism finance. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (C) After the meeting, the Minister and Ambassador 
</p><p>jointly addressed the press where both underscored the 
</p><p>importance of working together to fight crime.  The Minister 
</p><p>also used the press opportunity to defend a recent court 
</p><p>verdict to uphold the ruling Victory Front's (FPV) decision 
</p><p>to run symbolic candidates in the midterm elections.  In the 
</p><p>press event, the Ambassador and Minister both made strong 
</p><p>statements against recent anti-Semitic violence (ref A).  End 
</p><p>summary. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>The GoA Makes Progress Against TIP... 
</p><p>------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (C) The Ambassador thanked Minister Fernandez for the 
</p><p>excellent human rights cooperation from the MOJ's National 
</p><p>Anti-Discrimination Institute (ref B) and its cooperation in 
</p><p>fighting TIP.  He informed the Minister that the Department's 
</p><p>TIP report would be published in June, and that it would 
</p><p>likely note Argentina's progress to date.  He said that the 
</p><p>report would also reiterate the need to prosecute, convict, 
</p><p>and sentence those involved in TIP crimes and to provide more 
</p><p>care options for those freed from trafficking situations. 
</p><p>The Ambassador recalled a previous conversation with the 
</p><p>Minister, where Fernandez had indicated that the judicial 
</p><p>sector needed to do more to convict human traffickers.  He 
</p><p>offered USG support to assist GoA efforts to strengthen 
</p><p>judicial capacity to convict these crimes. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (C) The Ambassador then noted that the Department had 
</p><p>approved a proposal by TIP activist and 2007 International 
</p><p>Woman of Courage Award Winner Susana Trimarco to set up 
</p><p>specialized anti-trafficking units at the provincial level. 
</p><p>Minister Fernandez welcomed the news and asserted that the 
</p><p>MOJ gives Trimarco's anti-TIP foundation 100,000 pesos (about 
</p><p>US$27,000) every two months to pay for the foundation's 
</p><p>victim's assistance programs. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) Fernandez proudly informed the Ambassador that the 
</p><p>MOJ's specialized TIP units had conducted 177 raids, made 206 
</p><p>arrests, and rescued 287 TIP victims, including 90 minors. 
</p><p>He reiterated the need to train judges on the specifics of 
</p><p>the new anti-TIP law, and recalled a case where a judge tried 
</p><p>to prosecute a TIP victim who had been forced to abort a 
</p><p>child in the brothel where she was exploited. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>...but Changing Cultural Attitudes an Uphill Battle 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (C) Fernandez stated that the GoA's TIP public awareness 
</p><p>campaign would begin soon.  Fernandez underscored the need to 
</p><p>change cultural attitudes that accept the sexual exploitation 
</p><p>of women and children as normal.  He explained that the 
</p><p>sexual exploitation of women has long been glorified in 
</p><p>Argentine tango lyrics, and recalled one song that even 
</p><p>talked about police complicity with brothel owners.  The 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Minister recounted that in the Interior provinces, some 
</p><p>parents will voluntarily hand over their virgin daughters to 
</p><p>satisfy the demands of landowners. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C) The Ambassador then noted recent press reports that 
</p><p>alleged TIP activity taking place in brothels in the 
</p><p>Kirchners' hometown province of Santa Cruz (reftel). 
</p><p>Fernandez claimed that federal and provincial authorities 
</p><p>were working together to collect criminal intelligence to 
</p><p>crack down on illicit TIP activity taking place in brothels. 
</p><p>Poloff noted that the press quoted provincial authorities 
</p><p>explaining that the brothels serve a purpose for lonely 
</p><p>workers and helped keep the number of rape crimes down.  She 
</p><p>added that this suggests a need for greater awareness among 
</p><p>provincial authorities on how TIP and prostitution can 
</p><p>intersect and that prostitution is not the best way to 
</p><p>prevent rape. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8.  (C) The Minister argued that the brothels in Santa Cruz 
</p><p>have helped prevent rape.  He explained that most of Santa 
</p><p>Cruz's residents emigrated to the province where they work 
</p><p>primarily in the oil and gas industries.  He said these 
</p><p>workers ""make a lot of money, and if they do not have a place 
</p><p>to spend the money, they are likely to rape women to satisfy 
</p><p>their desires.""  When poloff noted that Argentine federal law 
</p><p>prohibited brothels, the Minister asserted that each province 
</p><p>has the right to decide whether brothels are legal or not, 
</p><p>and that brothels are legal in Santa Cruz.  That said, there 
</p><p>should be good regulations of legal brothels to ensure there 
</p><p>is no trafficking underway. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (C) The Minister reiterated that the government has an 
</p><p>uphill battle in changing cultural attitudes, particularly in 
</p><p>the interior provinces.  He then disclosed to the Ambassador 
</p><p>that he personally believed that the Aleh family, a prominent 
</p><p>family in Tucuman province, was behind the 2003 kidnapping of 
</p><p>Susana Trimarco's daughter, Marita Veron.  Fernandez referred 
</p><p>to the Ale patriarch as Argentina's very own ""godfather"" who 
</p><p>in an effort to launder his money from illicit activities is 
</p><p>now President of Tucuman's soccer club, Club Atletico San 
</p><p>Martin.  Fernandez said he felt sure they were involved in 
</p><p>the Veron kidnapping, but lamented that he ""can not prove it."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>MOJ Accepts Counternarcotics Training and Exchanges 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (C) The Ambassador thanked the Minister for the MoJ's 
</p><p>continued cooperation to fight drugs.  He indicated that 
</p><p>Southern Command officials were interested in visiting 
</p><p>Argentina to meet with their Border Patrol and Coast Guard 
</p><p>counterparts and would like to invite the MoJ to send a 
</p><p>General-equivalent from each of these agencies to visit the 
</p><p>Joint Interagency Counterdrug Task Force in Key West, Florida 
</p><p>and other national counterdrug agencies in Washington, DC. 
</p><p>The Ambassador also offered a training program in managing a 
</p><p>hostage-taking crisis sponsored by the Embassy's Military 
</p><p>Group.  The Minister accepted the offers and expressed 
</p><p>appreciation for these types of bilateral exchanges and 
</p><p>training programs. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>...but Notes Challenges in Winning the War on Drugs 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11. (C) Fernandez said that he does ""not want to delude 
</p><p>anyone that the government can win the battle against drugs"" 
</p><p>but emphasized the GoA would persist in its efforts.  Asked 
</p><p>by the Ambassador about efforts to control precursor 
</p><p>chemicals, Fernandez noted the recent arrest of Mario Roberto 
</p><p>Segovia, the so-called ""king of ephedrine"" and disclosed that 
</p><p>the MoJ is working on a case that would be finalized in the 
</p><p>next 30 days.  He pointed to the challenging economics of 
</p><p>controlling drugs.  He stated that a ton of ephedrine shipped 
</p><p>to China was worth $50; but a ton of methamphetamines was 
</p><p>worth $50,000 in the United States.  He also noted the ease 
</p><p>with which one could convert over-the-counter drugs into 
</p><p>ephedrine.  Fernandez said he knew who was producing 
</p><p>precursor chemicals in Argentina, and that producers would 
</p><p>soon have to re-register with the GoA to continue producing. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (c) The Minister added that Argentina signed an agreement 
</p><p>with the Bolivian government to enhance coordination to 
</p><p> 
</p><p>control precursor chemicals.  He claimed that President Evo 
</p><p>Morales was receptive to working together to fight drug 
</p><p>trafficking along Argentina's 720 kilometer border with 
</p><p>Bolivia.  The Minister said he knew what company in Salta was 
</p><p>shipping significant quantities of precursor chemicals into 
</p><p>Bolivia for illegal drug processing and would crack down on 
</p><p>it as soon as the new regulations are issued.  He claimed 
</p><p>that GOA agencies were now working together well and that MOJ 
</p><p>and the Drug Control agencies were collaborating effectively 
</p><p>on the new regulations.  Under the proposed plan, officials 
</p><p>from the Federal Police and the Ministry of Health would both 
</p><p>have to verify all movements of precursor chemicals, he 
</p><p>stated. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (C) He also recalled his earlier personal battles with 
</p><p>Jose Ramon Granero, the head of Argentina's Drug Control 
</p><p>agency, SEDRONAR, and Gabriel Aboud, the National Director 
</p><p>for Controlling Precursor Chemicals, calling the latter 
</p><p>""nefarious.""  He implicitly criticized Granero's resort to 
</p><p>the press to defend SEDRONAR saying, ""If Granero wants to 
</p><p>talk, great.  If not, he should keep his mouth shut."" 
</p><p>Fernandez said he had been behind the move to eliminate 
</p><p>SEDRONAR's former sole authority over the importation of 
</p><p>pre-cursor chemicals, saying that it was now a matter for the 
</p><p>Ministry of Health and the federal police (though SEDRONAR 
</p><p>also participates in the new multi-agency pre-cursor 
</p><p>commission). 
</p><p> 
</p><p>MoJ: ""The Year to Fight Money Laundering"" 
</p><p>----------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶14. (C) The Ambassador expressed appreciation for the 
</p><p>Minister's support for a new training program on bulk cash 
</p><p>smuggling with a live exercise component.  He also noted that 
</p><p>the USG has finalized an agreement with the GoA's Ministry of 
</p><p>Justice, Central Bank, Securities Exchange Commission, and 
</p><p>Insurance Regulator to provide technical assistance to 
</p><p>Argentine regulators, focused on enhancing the prevention and 
</p><p>detection of terrorism finance.  The Ambassador explained 
</p><p>that he planned to sign the agreement with Central Bank 
</p><p>President Martin Redrado in a low-profile ceremony. 
</p><p>Fernandez welcomed the assistance, and agreed that the 
</p><p>ceremony should be kept low-profile.  He stated that ""this is 
</p><p>the year to fight money laundering.""  He indicated that all 
</p><p>government agencies are now required to declare suspicious 
</p><p>activity, and he assured the Ambassador that such activity 
</p><p>would be investigated.  He asserted that the GoA will have ""a 
</p><p>strong response"" for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). 
</p><p>(Comment: We presume he was referring to the FATF mutual 
</p><p>evaluation of Argentina scheduled in October/November of this 
</p><p>year). 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Press 
</p><p>----- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶15. (C) After the meeting, the Ambassador and the Minister 
</p><p>gave a joint press conference and fielded questions from 
</p><p>print, television and radio media.  Per ref A, both made 
</p><p>strong statements condemning recent anti-Semitic violence in 
</p><p>Buenos Aires.  Fernandez said the meeting was an opportunity 
</p><p>to discuss joint cooperation in counternarcotics, TIP, 
</p><p>homeland security.  The Ambassador thanked Minister Fernandez 
</p><p>for the MoJ's productive cooperation on law enforcement 
</p><p>issues.  He noted that there is still much work to be done to 
</p><p>fight organized crime, and stressed the need for convictions 
</p><p>against criminals.  When asked about a court's recent verdict 
</p><p>to uphold the ruling party's decision to run ""symbolic 
</p><p>candidates"" for the upcoming mid-term elections, the Minister 
</p><p>praised and defended the decision, noting the opposition 
</p><p>party's right to appeal.  He went on to scold the opposition 
</p><p>for constantly complaining that Argentina's electoral system 
</p><p>is too complicated.  Despite opposition claims that voters do 
</p><p>not know how to split ballots, he said, ""voters know how to 
</p><p>vote.""  The Ambassador stressed that regular elections are 
</p><p>important to democracy and that Argentines will soon have the 
</p><p>opportunity to vote for the candidates that will represent 
</p><p>their interests best. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Comment 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶16. (C) In good times and bad, Minister of Justice Anibal 
</p><p>Fernandez has been one of the most accessible and 
</p><p>forward-leaning member of President Cristina Fernandez de 
</p><p>Kirchner's Cabinet.  While other Ministers, such as Defense 
</p><p>Minister Nilda Garre, can be problematic or prickly to work 
</p><p>with, Minister Fernandez has welcomed USG training 
</p><p>initiatives on a wide range of law enforcement topics. 
</p><p>Although Minister Fernandez' high political profile as a 
</p><p>staunch defender of Kirchner interests has generated much 
</p><p>public skepticism about his role on security and justice 
</p><p>issues, the fact remains that law enforcement cooperation 
</p><p>with Argentina's security agencies under his authority has 
</p><p>been productive.
