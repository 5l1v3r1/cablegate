Kuwait Finance House (KFH) confirmed to Econoff on May 12 
that they have frozen the accounts of the three terrorist 
financiers Hamed Al-Ali, Jaber Al-Jalahmah, and Mubarak 
Al-Bathali, upon instruction of the MFA. 
</p><p>¶2. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx told Econoff that CBK had notified 
all Kuwaiti financial institutions to freeze the assets of 
the three individuals in compliance with UNSCR 1267. xxxxxxxxxxxx
also confirmed to 
Econoff that after receiving official notification from CBK 
to freeze the assets of the individuals, to include their 
government salaries, KFH did freeze the assets and has barred 
all incoming and outgoing bank transactions. xxxxxxxxxxxx also 
underscored KFH's intention to permanently close the three 
accounts in the near future. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) Earlier on May 12, on the margins of a meeting with 
S/CT Dailey and the Ambassador (septel), MFA Director of 
Follow-up and Coordination Department assured Econoff that 
the GOK had instructed CBK to freeze the assets of the 
three terrorist facilitators. 
</p><p>Comment 
------ 
</p><p>¶4. (C) This is a major action by the GOK. While long 
overdue, it is nevertheless a very positive development. 
It demonstrates that when the GOK wants to act against 
terrorism, it can. It is likely that the embarrassment 
over the alleged role of Kuwaiti Guantanamo returnees in 
recent suicide attacks in Iraq played a role in forcing 
the GOK's hand.
