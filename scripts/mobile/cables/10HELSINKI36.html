¶1. (C)  SUMMARY.  At the London Conference Finland will 
announce its plans to increase its contributions to 
Afghanistan.  On January 22 President Halonen and the 
Government decided to increase its military and civilian 
presence and to direct additional development assistance to 
the northern provinces.  By early 2011 Finland should 
complete deployment of roughly an additional 50 troops, 
bringing the total to 195.  Those troops likely will end up 
at the PRT in Mazar-i-Sharif, though the Government could 
consider additional troops to a possible Nordic OMLT.  The 
Government will add two development positions in Afghanistan, 
and could increase from 24 to roughly 30 EUPOL trainers.  It 
also will consider sending civilian advisors to UNAMA.  The 
Government will confirm later whether it is re-directing 
existing funds to the north, or additional funds, and whether 
it will contribute to the Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a January 25 meeting, Director for the MFA's Unit 
for Security Policy and Crisis Management told Pol-Econ Chief 
that at the January 28 London Conference the Government of 
Finland (GOF) would announce its plans to increase its 
contributions to Afghanistan.  Kantola accepted reftel 
points, raising only his interest in the question of civilian 
structures within NATO, the EU and UN. Specifically, he 
wondered about whether plans to increase would substitute or 
supplement existing civilian offices in NATO and the EU. 
Regarding post-Lisbon EU organization, he assumed the Foreign 
Affairs Committee would discuss this on January 25, but he 
could not predict the outcome.  Kantola said Finland is 
willing to consider providing a seconded advisor to NATO 
Senior Civilian Representative staff, and to UNAMA as well 
should the UN open secondments beyond military and police. 
 
FINLAND INCREASES MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS 
 
¶3. (C)  On January 22 the GOF announced its plan to increase 
its troop level from 145 to 195.  Kantola pointed out that 
Finland's own announcement is confusing, as it refers to 
"approximately 50" additional troops while also describing 
195 as a maximum.  Prime Minister Vanhanen, when announcing 
the plan, referred to "roughly 200."  Kantola said that the 
GOF wants to retain some flexibility on the number, but that 
the Parliament might insist on a hard ceiling. The GOF 
intends to deploy the troops through 2010, with all being in 
place by early 2011. Kantola could not provide any timetable 
for deployment, in part because the Finns await the results 
of German-Swedish decisions regarding the PRT in 
Mazar-i-Sharif.  The Defense Ministry will clarify the 
deployment timetable later. 
 
¶4. (C) Kantola said most of the additional troops would go to 
the PRT, but could not say definitively all would go there. 
Of the outstanding 145 slots 30 are for OMLTs.  Kantola held 
out the possibility of additional contributions to OMLTs, 
perhaps to a Nordic OMLT, but conceded that Finland still has 
empty slots to fill.  He pointed out that the new GOF plan 
permits contributing to battalion-level OMLTs, adding that 
going down to the battalion level is the only way Finland 
would be able to fill outstanding positions. 
 
¶5. (C) The GOF's announcement described the increase as 
"temporary."  Kantola stated that "temporary" is not 
accurate, and struggled to find the correct English word to 
describe the GOF's decision; he said that the GOF's mandates 
are typically open-ended, and this is no different.  However, 
it appears that an open-ended mandate for these additional 
troops was politically difficult, resulting in the explicit 
promise from the GOF that it would periodically re-visit its 
decision. 
 
MORE CIVILIANS, PERHAPS MORE DEVELOPMENT FUNDING 
 
¶6. (C) The GOF announced publicly that it would direct 
additional development funding for the northern provinces. 
Kantola could not confirm whether this meant additional 
development funding or a reapportionment of existing funds, 
but he suspected the latter.  (NOTE: In a January 22 meeting 
an official with the MFA's European Security and Defense 
Policy Office told Poloff that Finland likely would focus 
more attention on agricultural development with a view to 
providing livelihoods to demobilized fighters.  END NOTE.) 
 
Nor could Kantola confirm a GOF contribution to the Peace and 
Reintegration Trust Fund. He said that the GOF would add two 
development positions in Afghanistan, one based in the 
Embassy and one in the PRT.  The Embassy slot should be 
filled this Spring; Kantola could not say when the other 
might be filled.  (NOTE: We had not received elaboration from 
the MFA's Afghanistan Office before the deadline. END NOTE.) 
Kantola also said that the decision whether to contribute 
more police trainers rested with himself.  He had not decided 
yet, but thought it likely the GOF would increase, perhaps 
from 24 to approximately 30.  He reiterated that Finland 
would also consider providing civilians to UNAMA, especially 
if they opened additional offices in the northern provinces. 
 
PARLIAMENT TO DEBATE GOF PLAN 
 
7 (C) According to Kantola, the GOF's plan could go before 
Parliament for debate and a vote as soon as the first week of 
February.  The GOF does not need Parliament's approval for 
the increases: as Kantola noted, the decision on troops 
belonged to the President, and the EUPOL decision was 
effectively his. However, Kantola pointed to Parliament's 
negative view in 2008 of Finland's support for 
battalion-level OMLTs, which led to the GOF removing that 
option. He stated Parliament, or the Foreign Affairs 
Committee alone, could force the government to change its 
plan if it issued direct and blunt criticism.
