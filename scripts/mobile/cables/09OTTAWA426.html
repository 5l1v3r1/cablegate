(DFAIT) Director for Defence and Security Relations Shelley
Whiting conveyed to Embassy on June 4 the second of two
Canadian diplomatic notes seeking U.S. military-to-military
support in advance of and during the February 2010 Winter
Olympic and Paralympic Games in Vancouver. Whiting stressed
the importance of the Games to Canada, as well as Canadian
appreciation for U.S. support. Admitting the late date of
this request, she emphasized Canada's hope that the USG would
respond positively and quickly -- within the next 30 days --
to the specific Canadian requests contained in the dipnote
and its three annexes. Whiting also requested an update on
Canada's first Olympics-related dipnote, which Embassy
conveyed to State for ExecSec transmittal to DOD for action
in January, but which has not yet elicited an official
response, despite Canada's request at that time for 30-day
turn-around. (Note: Reftel contains IDR-007, the first of
two Canadian dipnotes seeking U.S. mil-to-mil support for the
Vancouver Olympics. End note)
¶2. (SBU) Begin Canadian dipnote text:
Diplomatic Note No. IDR-0435
The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States
of America and has the honour to refer to recent discussions
between officials of our Governments, including the
Department of National Defence and the Office of the
Coordinator for 2010 Olympic and G8 Security, concerning
military-to-military and other assistance in support of
providing security for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games
to be held in Vancouver, British Columbia.
The Department wishes to advise the Embassy that Canada is
herewith making a request for the provision of certain
capabilities which, it is understood, could be made available
by the United States Department of Defense, the United States
Postal Service, the United States Coast Guard and other
Agencies. This current Note will be specific to the
military-to-military assistance desired to augment Canada
Command in its responsibilities in support of the 2010 Games,
whether fulfilling its defence mandated maritime surveillance
task, supporting the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP),
which is the agency responsible for security of the 2010
Games, or in Canada Command's support to Canadian civil
authorities who have the lead in consequence management
operations.
The request for United States Postal Service support in mail
screening will be addressed in a separate Note, as will the
establishment of integrated marine security operations to
take place on the west coast between Vancouver and Washington
State, planning for which was initiated by Diplomatic Note
No. GGA-0ll sent on March 11,2009
The specifics of the military-to-military assistance desired
to augment Canada Command are detailed in the attached three
Annexes. The 19 June 1951 Agreement Between the Parties to
the North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of Their
Qthe North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of Their
Forces would apply to any United States Forces deployed to
Canada in response to this request. Force protection would be
the responsibility of the RCMP. United States Forces and
personnel deployed to Canada pursuant to this request would
be transferred to the control of Canada Command, the specific
command and control authorities to be agreed between United
States Forces and Canada Command.
The detailed arrangements are to be completed through direct
coordination between the respective relevant military
authorities in accordance with the 13 March 1968 Exchange of
Notes between Canada and the United States of America on the
Principles and Procedures for Temporary Cross Border Movement
of Land Forces; the Canada-US Civil Assistance Plan and
existing orders and regulations. This current Note is
OTTAWA 00000426 002 OF 004
considered to constitute the formal clearance through
diplomatic channels as required by the above Exchange of
Notes of 13 March 1968. The duration, timing, modalities of
transfer of equipment and personnel, and other related
logistics of the elements of this request, would be
coordinated directly between Canada Command and the relevant
United States military authorities. The military point of
contact for this request is Canada Command Deputy Chief of
Staff Operations, Captain (Navy) Kevin Greenwood,
613-995-5826.
Further to discussions between officials of our Governments,
the Department wishes to express Canada's appreciation for
the expressed intent of the Government of the United States
of America to waive reimbursement of any incremental
operational expenses incurred during the provision of this
assistance.
The Department wishes to draw attention to the fact that
confirmation of the availability of the requested
capabilities is of critical importance to the planning
process for the security of the Games and the preceding
exercises. The Department would therefore be grateful for a
response to this note within 30 days.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of
the United States of America the assurances of its highest
consideration.

¶3. (S/REL-CANUS) ANNEX A
Begin Canadian Annex A text:
ANNEX A to Note IDR-0435
Dated: June 03, 2009
Canada requests the following capabilities to be provided for
the duration of the Games:
a. A command, coordination and liaison element positioned in
British Columbia, and linked to Joint Task Force Games, prior
to the start of the 2010 Games. The Canadian Forces would

during the 2010 Games and potentially remain until
consequence management operations are complete.
b. Ship boom force protection equipment sufficient to provide
security for three key locations in Vancouver Harbour.
c. A maritime surveillance capability, positioned in
international or US territorial waters, to assist Joint Task
Force Games and Joint Task Force Pacific in establishing

End Annex A text.
¶4. (S/REL-CANUS) ANNEX B
Begin Canadian Annex B text:
ANNEX B
to Note IDR-0435
Dated: June 03, 2009
Canada requests that specific consequence management
capabilities, listed below, be made available for
catastrophic scenarios, if necessary. These capabilities
would be stationed in the US and put on standby to be made
available to Canada, if required, for the duration of the
Games or as long as consequence management operations are
ongoing. These capabilities, and associated operational
support requirements, would be employed under the guidelines
laid out in the Canada-US Civil Assistance Plan.
OTTAWA 00000426 003 OF 004
Requested capabilities:
a. Mobile chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
reconnaissance and surveillance platform capabilities to
conduct protected sampling and delineation of chemical,
biological, radiological or nuclear contaminated areas.
b. An emergency medical capability (pre-hospital) capable of
extracting casualties from highly contaminated areas,
conducting the necessary medical triage and provision of
medical support to decontaminate and stabilize casualties
prior to evacuation to a civilian medical facility.
c. A medical facility (early entrance hospital element)
capable of decontamination, stabilizing and conducting
emergency procedures (including surgery) on a large number of
contaminated or non-contaminated casualties.
d. An aeromedical evacuation support facility to assist and
support contaminated or non-contaminated aeromedical
evacuations.
e. An operational support element to coordinate and support
the staging and reception requirements related to the
deployment of US military chemical, biological, radiological
and nuclear consequence management capabilities into Canada.
f. A chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
consequence management capability to extricate,
decontaminate, medically treat, and transport mass casualties
of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack in
Canada.
g. A high altitude airborne radiological sensing capability.
h. Strategic lift capability sufficient to transport a
Canadian Forces Operational Reserve (up to 350 personnel)
with its personal weapons, winter equipment, vehicle
complement, and 72 hours of consumables from its location in
Canada to a designated location within Canada.
i. Rotary wing capability sufficient to transport the
Vanguard Company (130 personnel) of a Canadian Forces
Operational Reserve with its associated personal weapons,
winter equipment, a limited number of vehicles, and 24 hours
of consumables from a receiving airport of disembarkation to
a designated point in the affected area of operations. The
Government of Canada is aware of the need to address the
question of accreditation of US health services professionals
in advance of any deployment of emergency medical
capabilities, and is committed to resolving this issue with
the appropriate provincial authorities in advance of the
Games.
End Annex B text.
¶5. (SECRET REL-CANUS) ANNEX C
Begin Annex C text:
ANNEX C
to Note IDR-0435
Dated: June, 03, 2009
Although unlikely, Canada could potentially face the threat
of an improvised or military nuclear device being constructed
in, or imported to, its national territory. Canada does not
currently possess the capability for the rendering safe of a
nuclear device.
Canada therefore requests that, if required, US capabilities
and technical assistance for 'render safe' operations and
transportation of an improvised nuclear device and/or a
radiological dispersion device be made available to Canada.
Render safe operations would be conducted under the
provisions of an agreed protocol, which is currently under
Qprovisions of an agreed protocol, which is currently under
revision.
