¶1.  (C) Summary:  During Parliament's last "Question Time" 
before election recess, Foreign Minister Phil Goff again 
highlighted tidbits of Codel Nickles' January 2004 meeting 
with National Party leadership to claim National has a hidden 
agenda to lift the country's nuclear ban.  No doubt in 
response to the Embassy's protests after Minister Mallard 
claimed US-interests were funding National's campaign, Goff 
limited his criticism to remarks allegedly made to the Codel 
by the Nat's foreign affairs spokesman, Lockwood Smith. 
While quoting Senator Nickles' response, Goff characterized 
it as "appropriate."  The Embassy has not yet been asked to 
comment on the latest outburst, but if we are we will reissue 
our previous statement that the U.S. Government has neither 
sought nor received assurances from any NZ political party. 
Labour clearly believes that stirring up anti-American 
sentiment is a vote-getter, and will continue to play the 
anti-U.S. card in the run up to September's elections.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During Parliament's final question and answer 
session on August 2, Foreign Minister Goff claimed that Smith 
had asked the visiting U.S. Senate delegation if assistance 
from a United States think tank would be worthwhile for a 
public campaign on New Zealand's nuclear-free policy.  Once 
again citing confidential minutes taken by an MFAT official 
at the January 2004 meeting (reftel), Goff claimed that 
delegation head Senator Don Nickles had responded that the 
"(nuclear-free policy) was an internal issue for New Zealand, 
and as such should be left to a New Zealand think tank." 
Goff said that the United States recognized, as Smith had 
not, that it was inappropriate for U.S. interests to 
intervene in New Zealand's domestic affairs.  ACT MP Rodney 
Hide promptly duly remarked that this claim completely 
contradicted Labour's previous innuendoes that Washington is 
funding National's campaign.  (Comment: We note that no one 
in Parliament or the media has asked how much the Labour 
government has spent lobbying the U.S. Congress for a Free 
Trade Agreement.  End Comment.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The new public allegation against Smith escalates 
the Labour Party's effort to paint the National Party as 
seeking to change the landmark legislation that bans nuclear 
arms and nuclear-propelled vessels from New Zealand.  The 
story commanded top billing in New Zealand's print media and 
led morning reports on radio.  It therefore handily pushed to 
the margins coverage of the trial that began this week in 
Christchurch for 5 policemen and a civilian driver accused of 
driving at speeds of up to 170 km to get Prime Minister Clark 
to the airport in time to catch a flight to a rugby match 
last July.  (The PM will not be asked to testify: she claims 
she was reading at the time and failed to notice the speed.) 
 
¶4.  (C) National has strongly denied the Government's claims, 
but its unclear whether the response will resonate with the 
public.   During Goff's barrage, Smith hotly denied he had 
made any proposal for a U.S.-funded campaign to change 
anti-nuclear legislation.  He challenged Goff to table the 
entire transcript of the Codel meeting, which Goff refused to 
do, arguing that he needed to protect the confidentiality of 
the Senators' remarks.  (Comment: Apparently, Goff believes 
that former Senator Nickles' remarks are no longer covered by 
that policy.  End Comment.)  In a radio interview this 
morning, Smith said that what he was trying to address was a 
need to bring enough information to the public that they can 
make an informed decision about whether the legislation, and 
the current problems in US-NZ relations, are in New Zealand's 
interests.  National Leader Don Brash told one TV journalist 
yesterday evening that he could not recall if Smith made the 
alleged comment, noting that it was a long time ago.  The 
Prime Minister, quipped Brash, cannot recall whether her 
motorcade was speeding and that was only a year ago.  He did 
own that "it would be inappropriate for any foreign think 
tank or lobby groups to be used to influence public opinion 
in New Zealand."  He reiterated -- often -- that National has 
pledged not to alter the nuclear legislation without a 
referendum.  Brash left out (no doubt intentionally) that the 
party has also previously said it might change the 
legislation if elected on a platform that pledged to do so. 
 
¶5.  (C) In a supplementary question, Ken Shirley MP of the 
ACT Party asked Goff if the anti-nuclear legislation banned 
nuclear electricity generation or a small nuclear reactor 
that has been operating in suburban Wellington since the 
1960s.  Goff responded that nothing in the legislation 
"prohibits a nuclear power plant, but no party in this House 
has ever been stupid enough to advocate that."  Goff's 
comment represents the Government's  clearest acknowledgment 
to date that there are notable exceptions to the New 
Zealand's nuclear-free legislation and its associated 
policies.
