<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>1.(C) Poloff raised reftel resolutions with MFA Bilateral Affairs Director Dhafer Al Umran and reviewed Bahrain's reversal on last year's Iranian no-action motion and the Iran resolution itself. Al Umran confirmed that Bahrain changed its vote after a call from Iranian FM Mottaki to the Bahraini FM. He did not offer any further explanation or detail on the conversation. Poloff pressed for a commitment to vote against this year's no-action motion, or at least be absent, and pointed out that the situation was different this year in the wake of the post-election unrest in Iran. Al Umran said he would discuss the matter with FM Khalid bin Ahmed.
</p><p>2.(C) Comment: Last year Iran lobbied Bahrain heavily and managed to sway its vote. If they repeat these tactics this year, it would likely require higher level intervention by the USG to prevail. ERELI</p>
