¶1.  (C) Summary:  In a meeting with President Uribe on March 
15, INL A/S Charles and Ambassador Wood welcomed Uribe's 
March 22-25 visit to Washington, lauded the decrease in 
violence under Uribe, stressed the need for eradication in 
national parks, and reiterated the importance we place on 
extradition in the context of negotiations with the 
paramilitaries.  President Uribe reiterated his commitment to 
extradition and the need for continuation of Plan Colombia 
beyond 2005.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) INL A/S Bobby Charles and Ambassador Wood met with 
President Uribe on March 15 in Bogota.  The U.S. side 
included INL/LP Director Tom Martin, NAS Director Phyllis 
Powers, NAS Deputy Roger Carignan, and Poloff Brian Walch 
(notetaker).  Uribe was accompanied by Foreign Minister 
Carolina Barco, Defense Minister Jorge Alberto Uribe, and 
Plan Colombia Coordinator Luis Alfonso Hoyos. 
 
¶3.  (C) Uribe reaffirmed his tough line on negotiations with 
the paramilitaries, but expressed concern that they were 
asking for relief from the possibility of extradition as a 
condition for concentrating their forces.  Uribe noted that 
concentration of paramilitaries was the only way to ensure 
that they stopped their violent actions and complied fully 
with their promised cessation of hostilities.  Ambassador 
Wood stressed the importance that the U.S. places on 
insulating the question of extradition in the negotiation 
process (and in deliberations on the conditional parole 
bill).  Ambassador Wood also noted that the Uribe 
Administration's discussions with the paramilitaries had 
already greatly reduced violence against civilians.  A/S 
Charles and the Ambassador advised Uribe to refrain from any 
decision on the peace process until he had completed his 
upcoming visit to Washington. 
 
¶4.  (C) Uribe called for continuation of Plan Colombia beyond 
¶2005.  He stated that had it not been for the program, 
criminal and terrorist elements would have won out in 
Colombia.  A/S Charles agreed, stressing that it is important 
to finish building the "entire house."  Ambassador Wood noted 
that the original goal of Plan Colombia was 50 percent 
eradication by 2005.  While that goal has been surpassed, 
much work needs to be done to reach 100 percent.  Ambassador 
Wood lamented that the GOC's seized assets program was facing 
difficulties owing to fear on the part of potential 
legitimate buyers. 
 
¶5.  (C) A/S Charles stressed the importance of beginning 
eradication programs in Colombia's national parks. 
Ambassador Wood reminded Uribe that coca cultivation was far 
more detrimental to the environment than chemicals used in 
eradication.  Uribe agreed on the need to address the parks 
problem.
