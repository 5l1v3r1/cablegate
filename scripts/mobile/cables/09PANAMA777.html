Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)  Olmedo Alfaro, Executive Secretary of the 
Council of Public Security and National Defense (Consejo), 
engaged in two tense encounters with DEA personnel last week, 
indicating continued tension over the Embassy decision to 
remove the Matador judicialized wiretap program from the 
control of the Consejo and put it entirely under the control 
of the Attorney General. After berating DEA and FBI agents, 
Alfaro declared that he did not need DEA because other USG 
agencies would give him what he needed. Alfaro's attitude, 
together with an apparent attempt to place an un-vetted 
officer on the DEA Sensitive Investigations Unit (SIU), 
indicate that members of Martinelli's security team are 
nervous about placing our judicialized wiretap program under 
the Attorney General's oversight. End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
I Don't Need You! 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  On October 7 a DEA agent and a TDY FBI agent who 
were conducting routine activities in the Matador wireroom 
(located on the Consejo office complex and still under the 
control of Consejo) were called into Alfaro's office and 
told, in a disrespectful tone, that "we know why they fired 
your boss! How are we supposed to trust you!" (Note: Country 
DEA attach departed Post two weeks ago for personal reasons. 
End Note.) He went on to say, "I don't care about DEA because 
the CIA will give me everything I need." He further 
complained about delayed payments from DEA for the wireroom. 
Alfaro then announced, "if you play hardball with us, we will 
play hardball with you." Alfaro then calmed down, and 
apologized for his outburst, saying he needed to "vent." 
 
--------------------- 
But Let's Make a Deal 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  (S//NF)  Two days later, Alfaro called the DEA agent in 
charge of Matador into his office to discuss Matador. Alfaro 
suggested that the dispute over Matador had been a personal 
problem with the previous attach, and that now that he was 
gone, Consejo and DEA should "sit down and work out a deal." 
Alfaro proposed that the first element of the deal be that 
DEA accept his original choice as wireroom supervisor. (Note: 
Consejo's firing of the long time Consejo wireroom 
supervisor, and attempt to impose an unknown officer was the 
beginning of the crisis over th Matador program. End Note.) 
He went on to insist that DEA give him an access card to the 
wireroom. The DEA agent explained that Consejo held all the 
access cards and he could go in whenever he wanted, but 
Alfaro insisted that DEA give him a card, "as an act of 
confidence." 
 
--------------- 
SIU Shenanigans 
--------------- 
 
¶4. (S//NF)  In the same week, the Panamanian National Police 
officer who serves as deputy head of the DEA SIU, Capt. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX, received a phone call from Sub-Commissioner 
Carrillo, his supervisor and the Director of the Judicial 
Investigative Police (DIJ), telling him that he was sending 
an officer to incorporate into the unit, assuring him that he 
had already passed local vetting, and was all right (Note: No 
PNP officers may join the SIU until they have been 
polygraphed and vetted by DEA. This officer had not been. End 
note.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  Alfaro's actions are increasingly unpredictable. 
DEA has always had excellent relationships with Consejo and 
all Panamanian law enforcement agencies, and routinely allows 
Panamanian law enforcement agencies and the GOP to take 
credit for huge drug seizures which are actually the work of 
DEA. Alfaro seems to give no importance to the long-standing 
close ties to USG partners, and to be entirely fixated on 
keeping control over the equipment used in the judicialized 
Matador program. Post has taken an irrevocable decision to 
move the Matador program from its present physical location 
on the Consejo grounds, and to put it entirely under the 
control of the Attorney General at a location controlled by 
her. Vice President and Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Varela 
has been informed of this decision, and he told the 
Ambassador that he had informed Alfaro and Minister of 
Government and Justice Jose Raul Mulino and would inform 
President Martinelli soon. 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  Alfaro's comments on not needing the DEA may 
indicate that the GOP now realizes it cannot use Matador for 
political espionage, especially when taken together with the 
increasing contact between the GOP and Israeli security 
companies. The government's concern that Matador not be 
turned over to the A/G, however, and the attempt to place an 
officer in the SIU without coordination, may indicate a shift 
in concerns from finding dirt on others to protecting 
themselves. There are members of the government with 
suspected ties to drug trafficking, and there is no reason to 
believe there will be fewer acts of corruption in this 
government than in any past government. By asking to 
renegotiate the Matador deal, and placing un-vetted officers 
in the SIU, the GOP may be trying to keep track of DEA 
activities to protect themselves from getting caught up in a 
U.S. investigation.
