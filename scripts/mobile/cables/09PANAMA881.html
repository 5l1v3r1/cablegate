¶1. (S//NF) Senior GOP leaders have told the Embassy that they have 
suspended discussions with the Israeli security firm Global CST. 
Minister of the Presidency Jimmy Papadimitriu told the Ambassador 
on December 13 that "the issue is closed" and that the GOP would 
not entertain further consideration of a consulting contract for 
Global CST. 
 
 
 
¶2. (S//NF) In a November 25 meeting with President Martinelli, Vice 
President Varela and Papadimitriu, Ambassador told of the problems 
that Global CST had created in Colombia and Peru, and advised them 
to speak further with Colombian national police director General 
Oscar Naranjo for details (refs A, B).   She emphasized that the 
presence of Israeli contractors in Panamanian ministries would by 
necessity restrict USG security cooperation and information 
sharing.  President Martinelli was surprised at the revelations, 
but said, "We don't want to change friends" and he promised to 
speak with President Uribe about Global CST.  In the weeks 
following, we began to hear reports that the GOP would drop Global 
CST, and that was finally confirmed by Papadimitriu on December 13. 
 
 
 
¶3. (S//NF) Post appreciates Embassy Bogota's frank assessment of 
Global CST's performance and its relationships with key GOC 
officials (refs C, D).  The information that Bogota provided helped 
us formulate a demarche that delivered our desired result.
