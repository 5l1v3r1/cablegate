¶1. (U) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Finnish 
CFSP Director and European Correspondent Jarno Syrjala 
March 28.  Syrjala offered the following comments of 
interest regarding the March 30-31 GYMNICH: 
 
¶2. (C) MISSILE DEFENSE: Although a discussion of US 
plans to place missile defense assets in Poland and the 
Czech Republic is not on the GYMNICH agenda, German FM 
Steinmeier intends to add it under "any other business," 
Syrjala said.  Finland and many others do not support 
addressing missile defense issues in the GYMNICH 
context, and they hope discussions will be brief. 
However, the issue could prompt some debate, depending 
on how Steinmeier phrases his comments, and Finland 
would defer to the Czechs or Poles to respond, Syrjala 
opined.  The "any other business" agenda will be 
crowded, he added, with the Belgians seeking to raise 
the situation in Congo and the British and Irish 
planning to raise Sudan and Zimbabwe. 
 
¶3. (C) MIDDLE EAST / NUG: In general terms, Syrjala 
said, no one doubts that Hamas is an extremist 
organization and must be considered "a dangerous 
animal."  However, the EU also believes it must find a 
way to engage with the NUG on some level; otherwise, 
President Abbas "will be left out in the cold."  Syrjala 
acknowledged that Finnish FM Erkki Tuomioja has been 
"among the avant-garde" in pressing for engagement with 
the NUG, and that most other EU member states have taken 
a markedly more cautious approach.  (COMMENT: With the 
Social Democrats' defeat in Finland's March 18 election, 
this will be Tuomioja's final GYMNICH.  There is the 
possibility that he will seek to 'go out with a bang' by 
offering an overly strong valedictory in favor of robust 
EU engagement with the NUG.  However, most Finnish 
officials espouse a much more guarded position toward 
the NUG.  Following Tuomioja's departure, we expect 
Finland to move toward the EU center as regards the NUG, 
rather than continuing to be an "outlier.") 
 
¶4. (C) WESTERN BALKANS: UN Special Rep Martti Ahtisaari 
has made a late decision not to attend the GYMNICH. 
According to Syrjala, this is "both good and bad," given 
the signs that EU unity behind Ahtisaari's 
recommendations to the UNSC may be flagging in some 
quarters.  The Finns believed that a briefing from 
Ahtisaari might serve to shore up unity at this crucial 
moment; on the other hand, Ahtisaari's absence might 
allow some countries like Italy to speak more openly 
about where they really stand vis--vis Ahtisaari's 
recommendations. 
 
¶5. (SBU) EUROPEAN NEIGHBORHOOD: The EU will be unable to 
bring Belarus into full ENP partnership any time soon, 
but it cannot slam the door either, Syrjala said.  The 
Belorussians "know what the EU wants" in terms of 
democratic reform and an improved human rights record, 
and that "there is no flexibility" in these areas.  The 
EU can be flexible on "small steps," such as human 
rights dialogue or cooperation on environmental and 
educational programs; it is currently in the 
Belorussians' court to show responsiveness in these 
areas.
