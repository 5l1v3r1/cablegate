<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>¶1. (C) Post delivered reftel demarche August 19 separately
to MFA Cabinet staff member Nazih al Negeiry and Arab League
Chief of Staff Hisham Youssef, ahead of an August 20
ministerial meeting at Arab League headquarters focused on
Lebanon. Negeiry committed to delivering the message to
Minister Aboul Gheit and to providing a readout of the August
20 gathering at the League. Negeiry avoided speculation on
what the senior Arab officials would conclude during their
talks, but believed the planned absence of Syrian Foreign
Minister Muallem would lower tensions.
</p><p>¶2. (C) Arab League Secretariat Chief of Staff Hisham Youssef
confided that ministers would meet at 1400 for a private,
closed-door working lunch hosted by Egypt, followed by
another closed door meeting starting at 1600 at League
headquarters, which would likely conclude by the early
evening. Secretary General Amre Moussa and the current Chair
of the Council of Ministers (United Arab Emirates) are
expected to address the media following their meeting. The
agenda for the formal session includes reconstruction
assistance for Lebanon, the holding of an extraordinary Arab
summit on Lebanon, and an AL proposal to initiate
Arab-Israeli peace talks under the auspices of the UN
Security Council (ref B). Youssef promised to convey the USG
message to Moussa, and to provide a read-out following the
meeting.
