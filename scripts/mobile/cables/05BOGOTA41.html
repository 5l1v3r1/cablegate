¶1. (U) The following is an update of Plan Colombia-related 
activities reported during December, 2004. 
 
---------- 
DOJ/ICITAP 
---------- 
 
¶2. (U) On December 21, 2004, twenty-one judicial police 
investigators and forensic experts graduated from the 
240-hour Forensic Linguistic Course taken at the Colombian 
Institute "Caro y Cuervo".  Forensic Linguistics is vital in 
investigations of kidnappings, extortion, and 
terrorist-related crimes, where voice samples from cassette 
tapes or recorded telephone calls are obtained as evidence 
for introduction at trial. 
 
-------- 
DOJ/JSRP 
-------- 
 
¶3. (U) During the month of December, the Justice Sector 
Reform Program (JSRP) intensified its assistance to the GOC 
in preparation for the implementation of the new Criminal 
Procedure Code.  This Code will come into effect in Armenia, 
Bogota, Manizales, and Pereira on January 1, 2005. 
 
¶4. (U) DOJ provided training in the new Code to: 360 police 
investigators in 6 different cities through its two-week 
"Investigator as a Witness" course; 120 prosecutors in Bogota 
through its two-week criminal trial advocacy course; and 120 
judges in three courses with respect to the implementation of 
the new Code.  In CY 2004, DOJ trained a total of: over 5,000 
police investigators, over 500 prosecutors, and over 300 
judges.  DOJ has also assisted both the Prosecutor General's 
Office (Fiscalia) and the Police with establishing monitoring 
groups to mentor and assist with the implementation of the 
new Code, as well as to report on the progress of the 
implementation. 
 
-------- 
MILGROUP 
-------- 
 
¶5. (S) The new Joint Task Force Omega Commander, Major 
General Carlos Alberto Fracica Naranja, has been quick to 
take the reins and imprint his leadership style on the task 
force.  MG Fracica is much more reliant on, and demanding of, 
his staff than was MG Reinaldo Castellanos Trujillo, and was 
quick to bring in his field commanders to define his 
strategy, set priorities, and outline his vision.  (Note: MG 
Castillanos was in command ten months before he brought his 
subordinate commanders to meet at a single location. End 
note.)  Indications are that MG Fracica will be aggressive 
and results oriented.  MG Fracica has emphasized mobility 
(both air and ground), small unit operations, fire support 
and psychological operations as being key to defeating the 
FARC in the Plan Patriota 2, Part B area of operations. 
 
¶6. (U) SOUTHCOM J3, MILGP and COLMIL Joint Staff conducted 
the culminating exercise for the six-month Joint Operations 
and Intelligence Center project during the week of December 
¶5. The exercise and associated training greatly improved 
COLMIL staff procedures and functions, information flow, and 
integration of intelligence.  It also identified systematic 
problems/improvement areas. USMILGP/SCJ3 anticipates follow 
on exercises to further enhance participating nation 
capability after the installation of the 
communications/intelligence hardware and software packages 
supporting Plan Patriota 2, Part B. 
 
--- 
NAS 
--- 
 
¶7. (U) December 18, the Colombian National Police received an 
additional DC-3 aircraft.  This is the first of three such 
aircraft that will complement the CNP's anti-narcotics 
programs.  These aircraft -- vintage 1940s -- are totally 
rebuilt, equipped with turboprop engines, and are well-suited 
for operation at locations with unimproved airstrips. 
¶8. (U) NAS personnel participated in DOD's annual Plan 
Colombia Helicopter Program Interim Review.  Among the topics 
discussed was the refinement of objectives and milestones for 
helicopter nationalization. 
 
--- 
RSO 
--- 
 
¶9. (U) Anti-Kidnapping Initiative: The next six-week crisis 
response training (CRT) for GOC anti-kidnapping officers 
(Grupo de Accion Unificada para la Libertad Personal, or 
GAULA) will begin on January 24, 2005.  DS/ATA is still 
searching for a full-time program manager.  A temporary 
program manager is in place and doing an outstanding job. 
RSO will propose to DS/ATA that the temporary manager be 
given the position on a trial basis for six months, or the 
equivalent of two CRT courses. 
 
¶10. (U) VIP Personal Protection Training Program: Twenty new 
members of the President's protective security detail 
graduated on December 17th.  Training will begin again in 
early January. 
 
----- 
USAID 
----- 
 
¶11. (U) President Uribe visited the Agro-Industrial Center in 
Villagarzon (Putumayo) to publicly recognize USG economic, 
social and humanitarian assistance to Putumayo and Colombia. 
Since 2001, the USG has allocated a total of US $458 million 
to implement democracy, alternative development and 
humanitarian assistance programs nationwide.  In Putumayo, US 
$57.4 million has been invested to transform the department's 
socio-economic landscape.  USAID program activities there 
have supported the improvement of 130 kilometers (80 miles) 
of roads, built and equipped 37 schools, and promoted 
livestock and poultry production.  In addition, the 
cultivation of nearly 30,000 hectares of licit crops such as 
cassava, plantains, rubber, black pepper, and heart of palm 
has provided socioeconomic benefits to roughly 20,000 
families.  The department's illicit coca-based economy has 
been dramatically reduced from 66,000 hectares in 2000 to 
less than 10,000 hectares in 2003. 
 
¶12. (U) On December 17, President Uribe and the DCM launched 
the new joint USAID/GOC rubber projects in El Bagre 
(Antioquia).  The projects are part of an agro-industrial 
development program being implemented in alliance with the 
private sector.  USAID's contribution of nearly US $1.8 
million to the total US $6.4 million cost of this project 
leveraged 72.6 percent in complementary funding from the 
private sector.  The projects will benefit 343 families 
through the cultivation of 1,372 hectares in six 
municipalities in northern Antioquia and one in Cordoba. 
With these projects, USAID is providing alternative and 
sustainable economic growth opportunities to rural 
populations that are vulnerable to illicit crop production. 
 
¶13. (U) The governors of Caldas, Risaralda, and Quindio 
publicly recognized the USAID "Economic Assistance Program" 
serving Colombia's large internally displaced persons 
population.  The program generates new employment and 
promotes sustainable economic growth through activities such 
as technical training, job placement and support to 
micro-enterprises.  To date, the program has benefited 
roughly 3,000 families in the region and more than 9,000 
nationwide.  In addition, the initiative has received nearly 
US $700,000 in matching contributions from more than 35 
organizations in the region and over US $6 million nationwide.
