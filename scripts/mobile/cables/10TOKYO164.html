¶1. (C) Summary: The Nago election result will not be a 
decisive factor in resolving the Futenma issue and a variant 
of the current plan remains on the table, Deputy Chief 
Cabinet Secretary and PM confidante Matsuno told Embassy 
Tokyo January 26.  Hinting at current Kantei (Prime 
Minister's Office) thinking, Matsuno mused whether a move to 
an existing facility on Okinawa, such as within or adjacent 
to Camp Schwab, or in the Northern Training Area, would be 
acceptable to the USG if the new plan were operationally 
sound and could be implemented as quickly as the currently 
envisioned plan.  He emphasized that the Camp Schwab landfill 
option is ""dead.""  The Kantei quietly pulled for the pro-base 
candidate in the Nago election ""because this would have 
preserved more options for us,"" Matsuno revealed, but added 
that Mayor-elect Inamine might accept a modified version of 
the current plan.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary and PM Hatoyama 
confidante Yorihisa Matsuno told Political M/C and Pol Deputy 
January 26 that the PM's resolve to settle the Futenma issue 
by May remains ""unshaken"" by the results of the Nago mayoral 
election (reftel).  While the results to some extent reflect 
the ""will"" of the citizens of Nago, the vote was nearly 
evenly split between the candidate who opposes the Futenma 
move to Henoko (52%) and the incumbent who supports it (47%). 
 ""Even the citizens of Nago aren't unified on this issue,"" 
Matsuno observed. 
 
¶3. (C) Japan's national security will not be decided by local 
governments, Matsuno continued.  The election result will 
thus not be a critical factor in the PM's ultimate decision, 
and a variant of the current Futenma plan remains one option 
on the table.  ""PM Hatoyama continues to have a 'free hand,'"" 
Matsuno said several times.  In response to Pol M/C's 
statement that the current Futenma plan remains the best and 
most viable option, Matsuno wondered aloud whether a new plan 
that had no operational downsides and could be implemented as 
quickly as the current Futenma option would be acceptable to 
the USG.  Hinting at current Kantei thinking, Matsuno mused 
that perhaps the Northern Training Area or inside/adjacent to 
Camp Schwab would be suitable options (Note:  presumably, 
""adjacent to"" refers to the Central Training Area), noting 
that these could be ""quick"" choices because they don't 
involve moving people or tearing down houses.  Matsuno 
stressed that the Camp Schwab landfill option was ""dead,"" 
citing the likelihood of protests in and around the 
construction area. 
 
¶4. (C) PM Hatoyama and the Okinawa Working Group will have to 
consider ""for form's sake"" Futenma options outside of 
Okinawa, but the only realistic options are to move Futenma 
to Camp Schwab or another ""existing facility,"" Matsuno 
continued.  Even though Mayor-elect Inamine has expressed his 
opposition to the current Futenma plan, he might accept a 
modified version.  In truth, Matsuno and the PM's office had 
been quietly pulling for the incumbent's victory in Nago, ""as 
this would have preserved more options for us,"" Matsuno said. 
 To his knowledge, no senior government official supported 
Inamine's campaign.
