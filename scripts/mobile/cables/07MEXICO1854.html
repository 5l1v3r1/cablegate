¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The February 27 visit by John Walters (ONDCP) 
helped initiate coordination with the newly installed 
Calderon Administration.  In separate meetings with Attorney 
General Medina Mora and Public Security Secretary Garcia 
Luna, Director Walters emphasized the importance of 
information sharing for interdiction and for attacking drug 
trafficking organizations.  Noting that the U.S. was awaiting 
Mexican thoughts about a strategic counter-drug partnership, 
he urged early operational cooperation, and discouraged 
megaprograms as likely to be too ponderous to be effective. 
He emphasized U.S. willingness to work in partnership with 
Mexico at the Southwest Border, and on database and 
information sharing, arms trafficking, specific law 
enforcement operations, and training and equipment suited for 
requirements identified by Mexico.  While ONDCP Director 
Walters pressed Mexican naval officials for progress on a 
maritime agreement, they remained reticent on the subject 
although generally open to better U.S.-Mexico cooperation. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 27, John Walters (Director of the White 
House Office of National Drug Control Policy - ONDCP) and 
staff visited Mexico City for meetings with leaders of the 
newly installed Calderon Administration, including Eduardo 
Medina Mora (Attorney General) and Genaro Garcia Luna 
(Secretary for Public Security). Walters also met with the 
Army (SEDENA), the Navy and GOM health authorities. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In Walters, meeting with Eduardo Medina Mora, the 
AG reemphasized many topics raised with recent USG visitors 
(reftels), including the GOM's priority on attacking the 
cartels, improving interdiction (with an emphasis on 
methamphetamines and a reorientation towards Mexico's 
southern border), improving eradication, improving anti-money 
laundering efforts, stemming the growth of small-scale drug 
dealing, promoting prevention and rehabilitation, improving 
intelligence gathering and assessing and countering arms 
trafficking. The AG emphasized the need for both governments 
to break down the partitions that artificially divide our 
respective anti-money laundering efforts, and to seek new 
means to pursue money launderers. The AG also focused in on 
the threat of Chinese exports of methamphetamine precursors, 
asking for USG help in urging the Chinese to better control 
their exports and in improving coordination of inspection of 
trade and interdiction of illicit goods transiting Long Beach 
destined for Mexico. 
 
¶4. (C) Walters expressed his concern for ensuring that 
top-level people in the Mexican policy community have 
adequate personal protection to prevent traffickers from 
defeating significant reforms by intimidation and selective 
assassination. With respect to Mexican concerns about weapons 
entering from the United States, Walters told Medina that ATF 
was prepared to conduct serial number traces of all weapons 
referred by Mexican authorities, and that the U.S. would 
initiate proactive surveillance and investigation of gun 
shows and other sources in the Southwest Border area, 
particularly the sales of armor piercing munitions. Medina 
acknowledged the importance of serial number traces, but 
requested a level of information sharing that would provide 
Mexican access to information about purchasers of 
military-style munitions and pro-actively put them in a 
position to arrest and prosecute. 
 
¶5. (C) With respect to cash movements, Walters said the U.S. 
would be prepared to follow Mexico's lead, but suggested that 
strengthening investigations and invocation of U.S. foreign 
assets control legislation could effectively hit traffickers 
cash supply and cause considerable disruption. 
 
¶6. (C) Turning to methamphetamine, Walters reviewed 
consultations with his German, Indian and Chinese 
counterparts, as well as in international organizations, 
noting U.S. interest in working to control precursor 
chemicals at the source. He added that if the Attorney 
General thought it would advance policy, the two of them 
might approach the Chinese jointly -- a proposal Medina 
accepted. 
 
¶7. (C) Moving to legislation currently in the Mexican 
Congress to expand the authority of state and local 
jurisdictions to enforce drug laws, Walters suggested a 
sustained dialogue as the legislation advanced. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Walters discussed the pending reorganization of the 
federal police forces into a single entity in his meeting 
with Genaro Garcia Luna. GGL is ambitious, hoping to reverse 
the endemic corruption that has afflicted the SSP personnel, 
essentially by paying his staff better, introducing more 
stringent selection criteria and vetting all 20,000 of them. 
(In coming years, this staffing level will likely rise to 
40,000.) Walters also emphasized the USG's desire to see 
better coordination with ATF on arms trafficking. 
 
¶9. (SBU) In meetings at SEDENA with Gen. Oliver Cen (Deputy 
Chief of Staff for Operations) and Gen. Morafin 
(Intelligence), the Army emphasized its need for help with 
demand reduction amongst its own elements, as well as more 
broadly; this was especially true with regards to 
methamphetamine use in Mexico. Gen. Oliver also noted the 
shift of responsibility for all forms of eradication to the 
military, with the Office of the Attorney General (PGR) 
transferring to SEDENA the equipment (aircraft, parts and 
facilities) PGR had used previously for aerial fumigation of 
opium poppy. SEDENA planned to adopt a new standard operating 
procedure in its manual eradication activities, employing 
dozens of surge operations with a more focused approach for 
maximum impact, instead of permanently deploying the 
20,000-30,000 troops that SEDENA and Marina have fielded in 
the past. They also discussed VIP security, which is the 
responsibility of SEDENA. Walters noted that ATF was willing 
to work with SEDENA to address the rampant arms smuggling 
that feeds into the violence associated with Mexico's drug 
trafficking organizations (DTOs). 
 
¶10. (SBU) In a working lunch with the DCM and Navy (Marina) 
Admiral Enrique Henaro Galan (Chief of Staff, CNO), Admiral 
Roberto Gomez Caranza (Deputy Chief of Operations) and 
others, Walters pressed for Mexican consideration of a 
maritime agreement. While generally friendly, the Navy 
delegation indicated that cooperation could be improved 
outside the context of a formal agreement, and suggested that 
the Secretariat of Foreign Relations (SRE) was the better 
place to press the issue of an agreement. The luncheon made 
clear the excellent relationship that exists between the Navy 
and the U.S. Coast Guard representative at post, and 
highlighted the Navy's general interest in cooperating with 
the U.S. 
 
¶11. (SBU) In a final meeting with Mauricio Hernandez Avila 
(Under Secretary of Health for Prevention and Promotion) and 
Dr. Carlos Rodriguez Ajenjo (Technical Secretary of National 
Council Against Addiction - CONADIC), Walters shared insights 
on the means by which ONDCP tracked real-time changes in drug 
usage in the United States. Hernandez recounted his hope that 
the past de facto policy of tolerance for illicit use of 
drugs and alcohol by minors at the individual level would be 
changed in the Calderon administration. There was a huge 
bulge in the population profile, with a youth cohort aging 
into adulthood, and with high levels of abuse of all drugs of 
concern, including tobacco. The powerful alcohol industry 
created demand in ads aimed at youths and young adults, 
complicating any message the GOM might put out. Hernandez 
also noted a desire to pair cities along the border in an 
attempt to address illicit consumption of drugs, alcohol and 
cigarettes among youth.
