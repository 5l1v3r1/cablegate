</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p>Acevedo Steps Down from Tumultuous Governorship 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (SBU)  The Governor of Santa Cruz Province, Sergio 
</p><p>Acevedo, abruptly resigned on March 15 for what he claimed 
</p><p>were ""strictly personal reasons.""  Acevedo declined to give a 
</p><p>press conference, answer questions or give any further 
</p><p>justification for his departure.  This unanticipated and 
</p><p>unexplained mid-term resignation has led to much speculation. 
</p><p> The most frequently reported hypotheses center around 
</p><p>several high profile social and political incidents that 
</p><p>occurred in his province in recent months.  Incidents such as 
</p><p>the controversy surrounding the repatriation of provincial 
</p><p>funds from Swiss banks (deposited by Acevedo,s predecessor, 
</p><p>President Kirchner, just before the 2001 economic crash), the 
</p><p>conflict with oil and gas workers in February (Reftel A) - 
</p><p>which involved roadblocks, salary demands, one killed police 
</p><p>officer and a heavy Gendarmeria presence ) and President 
</p><p>Nestor Kirchner,s apparent reluctance to associate himself 
</p><p>with the governor recently, have all played into theories as 
</p><p>to what precipitated the resignation.  Vice-governor Carlos 
</p><p>Sancho will replace Acevedo.  (COMMENT: Others cite the 
</p><p>infighting between Kirchner insiders, Local Secretary Carlos 
</p><p>Zannini, Minister of Planning Julio De Vido and Acevedo. 
</p><p>Sources report that De Vido has been keen on ousting Acevedo 
</p><p>as a means to position himself for his run at the 
</p><p>Governership in 2007.  Acevedo told DCM the morning after his 
</p><p>resignation that pressure from Buenos Aires (i.e. President 
</p><p>Kirchner and Casa Rosada officials) made it impossible for 
</p><p>him to govern the province and comply with his mandate as 
</p><p>governor.  The resignation of Acevedo narrows Kirchner's 
</p><p>already limited circle of advisors and removes from the scene 
</p><p>one of Kirchner's more honest and pro-U.S. officials.  END 
</p><p>COMMENT.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (U)  In related news, the salary demands first heard at 
</p><p>the Las Heras oil workers protests in Santa Cruz, appear to 
</p><p>have had their desired effect: on March 15 the GOA announced 
</p><p>that in April the taxable income floor will be raised to 2400 
</p><p>AR pesos (estimated 800 US dollars) per month for single 
</p><p>people and 3200 AR pesos (estimated 1066 US dollars) for 
</p><p>married couples. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p>Narcotics Update:  That which was lost is now found 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) On March 18, responding to an anonymous phone tip the 
</p><p>Federal Police searched a shipping container bound for Spain 
</p><p>looking for cocaine.  A cursory search of the container 
</p><p>failed to turn up any narcotics, but after a second call the 
</p><p>Federal Police completely unloaded the container and 
</p><p>discovered between 300 and 350 kilos of cocaine concealed 
</p><p>inside a shipment of frozen fish.  Gendarmeria General Anibal 
</p><p>Maizteguai confirmed to DEA that the shipment included the 
</p><p>160 kilos of cocaine that the Gendarmeria had previously lost 
</p><p>during a botched controlled delivery operation.  He asserted 
</p><p>that the seizure contained the exact number of identically 
</p><p>wrapped packets bearing the same seal as the lost cocaine, 
</p><p>and agents who worked that case were even able to identify 
</p><p>the incisions they had made on some of the packets to test 
</p><p>for purity prior to the controlled delivery operation. 
</p><p>(COMMENT: If as seems likely, the cocaine is indeed the 160 
</p><p>kilos lost during the recent controlled delivery, this could 
</p><p>help defuse press criticism regarding the botched operation. 
</p><p>News sources and pundits have loudly criticized the handling 
</p><p>of the controlled delivery while largely ignoring the fact 
</p><p>that eight of the nine suspects in that case are already in 
</p><p>custody.  END COMMENT.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (C) The Federal Police believe the seizure is related to 
</p><p>the February 23 seizure in Argentina of 200 kilos in a 
</p><p>similar shipment (Reftel B) and the March 9 seizure of 400 
</p><p>kilos located in frozen fish by Spanish authorities following 
</p><p>information provided by GOA law enforcement.   Also of note, 
</p><p>the cocaine not believed to be part of the control deliver 
</p><p>bore the marking common to the Salta based Motok family.  The 
</p><p>Motok family, the second biggest narcotics transportation 
</p><p>crime group based in Argentina, was a major target of the DEA 
</p><p>funded Northern Border Task Force (NBTF) and has been largely 
</p><p>dismembered.  (COMMENT: The fact that this seizure appears to 
</p><p>connect three of the highest-profile narcotics investigations 
</p><p>of the year serves to illustrate the complex and 
</p><p>interconnected nature of narcotics smuggling operations in 
</p><p>Argentina. END COMMENT.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>----------------------- 
</p><p>Telerman Takes the Helm 
</p><p>----------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (U) On March 13, Jorge Telerman was formally sworn in as 
</p><p>Mayor of Buenos Aires, following the March 7 vote in the 
</p><p>Buenos Aires legislature to remove Anibal Ibarra from office. 
</p><p>(Reftel C)  In his inaugural speech, Telerman acknowledged 
</p><p>the ""weaknesses of the State"" that allowed the Cromagnon 
</p><p>tragedy that precipitated the downfall of his predecessor. 
</p><p>Telerman praised President Kirchner and the Buenos Aires 
</p><p>legislature.  Telerman also thanked on several occasions his 
</p><p>political ""teacher and father,"" 1980s Peronist Party (PJ) 
</p><p>strongman Antonio Cafiero, who brought Telerman into 
</p><p>politics.  Vice President Daniel Scioli, several Cabinet 
</p><p>members, and a host of Peronist leaders from the Capital and 
</p><p>Buenos Aires province were in attendance. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (U) Telerman has announced he plans to form a cabinet 
</p><p>modeled on the cabinets of the provincial governors.  His 
</p><p>nominations are largely all Kirchneristas or from Ibarra's 
</p><p>team, including Raul Fernandez as Secretary General, Donato 
</p><p>Spacavento as Minister of Health, Javier Gonzalez Fraga as 
</p><p>Production Minister, and Diego Gorgal as Minister of 
</p><p>Government. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (C) Bio Note: In the 1970s, Jorge Telerman was active in 
</p><p>the Communist Youth Federation, along with former Mayor 
</p><p>Anibal Ibarra.  Telerman started his career as a journalist 
</p><p>in the 1980s on ""Badia y Compania"" TV show on Channel 13. 
</p><p>Through his personal friendship with Antonio Cafiero, who he 
</p><p>met in 1981, he became Cafiero's spokesman when he was 
</p><p>Governor of Buenos Aires province (1987-1991).  He later 
</p><p>served under Foreign Minister Guido di Tella in the Menem 
</p><p>administration.  He became Menem's Ambassador to Cuba in 
</p><p>¶1998.  In 1999, he served as Eduardo Duhalde's spokesman and 
</p><p>campaign advisor during Duhalde's 1999 presidential campaign. 
</p><p> Telerman was one of two Peronists that Anibal Ibarra 
</p><p>incorporated into his administration when he became Buenos 
</p><p>Aires Mayor in 2000, with Telerman serving as Ibarra's 
</p><p>Secretary of Communication (July 2000-2003).  Telerman ran on 
</p><p> 
</p><p>SIPDIS 
</p><p>Ibarra's reelection ticket as the Deputy Mayor and head of 
</p><p>the City Secretariat of Social Development (mid-2003 ) Nov. 
</p><p>2005).  Since November 14, 2005 Telerman has been the acting 
</p><p>Mayor of Buenos Aires.  Jorge Telerman was born November 29, 
</p><p>1955 in Buenos Aires City.  He is married and has children. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (C) Although Jorge Telerman has long been active in the 
</p><p>Peronist Party, he has had  difficult relationship with the 
</p><p>current head of the Buenos Aires City branch of Peronism, 
</p><p>Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez.  His friction with Fernandez 
</p><p>and his reputation for independence has earned him the 
</p><p>moniker of ""Non-PJ Peronist,"" a characterization that 
</p><p>Telerman does not deny.  Telerman recently told the 
</p><p>Ambassador that he does not consider himself a Peronist, but 
</p><p>does have good relations with the Buenos Aires Peronists. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------- 
</p><p>Misiones Province in Flames 
</p><p>--------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11. (U)  On March 13, a group of 3,000 farmers and forestry 
</p><p>workers in the central Misiones town of San Vicente 
</p><p>vandalized the town hall, demanding that Mayor Luis Benitez 
</p><p>be removed from office.  Although these protesters were not 
</p><p>professional piqueteros responding to a larger piquetero 
</p><p>organization or leader, as we have seen in other instances, 
</p><p>they did employ the same tried and true tactics: the 
</p><p>protesters stormed the municipal building and adjacent police 
</p><p>station with sticks and stones, set it on fire and obstructed 
</p><p>firefighters, access to the blaze.  The day of riots left 
</p><p>the building completely destroyed and the streets strewn with 
</p><p>litter. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (U)  The group of agricultural workers, which began as a 
</p><p>collection of roughly 400 people demanding the federal 
</p><p>subsidies last Tuesday, had grown to an angry mob of 3,000 
</p><p>within a week.  They accuse Benitez of misappropriating 
</p><p>$99,000 pesos in federal subsidies disbursed to the 
</p><p>municipality as federal relief for farmers following the 
</p><p>severe droughts in January and February.  They are also 
</p><p>accusing Benitez of illicit enrichment, irregularities in his 
</p><p>administration and neglect of local roads.  Following the 
</p><p>arson seventeen people were arrested, though eleven were 
</p><p>later released.  The director of the local hospital confirmed 
</p><p>32 injured, the majority of which were police officers. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (U)  Mayor Benitez has defended himself by blaming the 
</p><p>media for ""political intentionality,"" and strongly accused a 
</p><p>local radio station and television channel of encouraging 
</p><p>people for the last three months to ""attack police and burn 
</p><p>the town hall.""  The radio and television stations he blames 
</p><p>are owned by a vocal opponent of his administration.  Also 
</p><p>pointing fingers in a similar direction is the secretary of 
</p><p>the Agricultural Producers Association of Misiones (APAM), 
</p><p>the group that initiated the demands a week ago.  He says he 
</p><p>thinks the main perpetrators were ""government operatives 
</p><p>supported by anti-Benitez councilmen"" who infiltrated the 
</p><p>group and provoked violence.  The investigating judge that 
</p><p>arrested the protesters has said that he too suspects 
</p><p>""infiltrators"" and that he will investigate at least one 
</p><p>member of the city council.  He has also said he will 
</p><p>investigate the radio station for ""instigating violence."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶14. (U)  The episode, while abnormally violent, is not the 
</p><p>first symptom of political instability in the town.  San 
</p><p>Vicente has had seven mayors in the last eight years. 
</p><p>Benitez,s predecessor is a fugitive wanted on corruption 
</p><p>charges, and even Benitez himself has previously been accused 
</p><p>of corruption.  In 2005 he was dismissed on charges of 
</p><p>mismanagement of funds and illicit enrichment, only to regain 
</p><p>his seat through appeal.  Benitez has said publicly he will 
</p><p>not resign, but has asked the city council for a leave of 
</p><p>absence.
