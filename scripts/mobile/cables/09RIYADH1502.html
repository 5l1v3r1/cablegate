<br></pre></p></div><p>¶1. (U) Summary: Assistant Secretary for Political-Military
Affairs Andrew Shapiro met on October 24 with Prince Miteb
bin Abdullah Al-Saud, Assistant Deputy Commander for Military
Affairs of the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Prince Miteb
described the problems faced by Saudi Arabia in Yemen and
pressed for the U.S. to actively support the Yemeni
government. End Summary.
SANG: A-OK
-----------
¶2. (C) A/S Shapiro conveyed assurances to Prince Miteb that
the U.S. wanted to be fully supportive of the National Guard
and its U.S. advisory group, the Office of the Program
Manager - Saudi Arabian National Guard (OPM-SANG). Prince
Miteb expressed appreciation for the support, and reported
that SANG was doing well and that he was pleased with the
work of his American advisers.
Yemen: The Houthi have an army
------------------------------
¶3. (C) Prince Miteb warned that al-Qaeda,s main home is now
in Yemen, and that the U.S. will have to regain the trust of
the Yemenis. He said that Saudi Arabia is limited in what it
can do to help quell the problems in Yemen. "We will not get
involved," he said, adding, "it is time for you to help them,
and to understand that the Iranians are supporting them."
Saudi Arabia must be cautious, he explained, because of the
sensitive situation on the Saudi-Yemeni border. Every day
Saudi Arabia captures three
to four thousand persons coming across the border. Further
problems are likely to occur as Saudi Arabia implements plans
to build a border wall, which will cut through towns
straddling the border.
¶4. (C) Prince Miteb pointed out that it appears that the
Houthi have developed an army, evidenced by their ability to
resist government forces. "The sooner that Yemen finishes
the Houthi, the better it will be for them." He urged that
the U.S. take the Yemeni situation very seriously to prevent
the situation from getting worse. Another reason he cited
for increased U.S. involvement is that it would help the U.S.
to "reclaim lost trust" and re-establish U.S.credibility.
