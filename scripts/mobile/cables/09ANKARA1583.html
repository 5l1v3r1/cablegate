¶1. (C) Summary:  During an October 21 meeting with MFA 
Undersecretary Sinirlioglu, the Ambassador challenged Prime 
Minister Erdogan's recent dismissal of international 
community allegations that Iran intends to acquire nuclear 
weapons as "gossip."  The Ambassador emphasized Iran will be 
the single most important topic when Erdogan and POTUS meet 
in Washington December 7.  In contrast to Erdogan, President 
Gul November 2 pressed Iran to be transparent with IAEA 
inspectors.  We will urge Gul and senior Turkish bureuacrats 
to curb Erdogan's damaging defense of Iran's nuclear 
activities.  End Summary 
 
¶2. (C) During an October 21 meeting with MFA Undersecretary 
Sinirlioglu, the Ambassador challenged PM Erdogan's public 
statement, made the previous day while he was in Tehran, 
dismissing allegations of Iran's intent to acquire nuclear 
weapons as "gossip."  Holding a copy of President Obama's 
Pittsburgh Summit comdemnation of Iraq's nuclear ambitions, 
the Ambassador asked Sinirlioglu if "this was the 'gossip'" 
to which Erdogan had referred.  The Ambassador emphasized 
that Erdogan's statement made Turkey vulnerable to 
international community criticism should Iran balk on IAEA 
inspection of its Qom reprocessing facility or second-party 
reprocessing of its low-enriched uranium stockpile.  Erdogan 
was, in effect, allowing the Iranians to infer a weakening of 
the international community consensus against them.  The 
Ambassador warned Sinirlioglu that Washington was now 
wondering if it could any longer count on Turkey to help 
contain Iran's profound challenge to regional peace and 
stability. 
 
¶3. (C) Implying Erdogan's use of the term "gossip" was 
unconfirmed, Sinirlioglu claimed that the Turkish government 
"fully supports the P5-plus-1."  He asserted the prime 
minister's principled opposition to nuclear weapons in the 
region.  He argued Erdogan's rhetoric is a tactical effort to 
gain him credibility with the Middle Eastern street so he can 
better place the anti-nuclear weapons message.  Though Turkey 
"doesn't believe in sanctions," Sinirlioglu said, "we will 
support consensus" in the Security Council.  The Ambassador 
responded that Iran would be the single most important topic 
of conversation when Erdogan and POTUS meet in Washington on 
December 7. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In marked contrast to Erdogan, President Gul 
November 2 said Turkey is against nuclear weapons in its 
region and the world, "especially in neighboring countries." 
In remarks to reporters while enroute to Slovakia, Gul 
reaffirmed Turkey's preference for diplomatic means (as 
opposed to the use of military force) to compel Tehran's 
adherence to its international obligations, but insisted that 
Iran "...must be transparent and open to IAEA inspection in 
order to overcome suspicions." 
 
¶5. (C) Comment:  Erdogan's recent comments on Iran's nuclear 
program amount to a defense of Tehran's defiance of the 
international community's will.  His desire for a "good" 
Washington visit is the goad we will continue use to try to 
turn him back towards the international community consensus 
on Iran.  We will also emphasize to Erdogan's senior 
bureuacrats and, when the opportunity arises, to President 
Gul their interest in reining in Erdogan on Iran.
