SUBJECT: Peru Signs Counternarcotics Information Sharing Agreement 
with Mexico 
</p><p>CLASSIFIED BY: Robert C Ward, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, STATE, NARCOTIC 
AFFAIRS SECTION; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
</p><p></p><p>¶1.        (C) Summary:  On November 6, officials in the Peruvian 
and Mexican Governments signed an agreement in Mexico City designed 
to improve coordination and cooperation to fight crime.    For 
Peru, the goal is to obtain intelligence to identify and capture 
Mexican drug traffickers, whose expanded presence in Peru in recent 
years represents a growing threat, according to Peruvian 
authorities.  The Peruvian police participant in the talks provided 
NAS Lima a copy of the agreement and background information on 
Mexicans in Peru.    End Summary. 
</p><p>¶2.       (C) On November 13, Peruvian National Police (PNP) 
Anti-Drug (DIRANDRO) XXXXXXXXXXXX 
briefed NAS officers on the recent history of Mexican drug 
traffickers in Peru, and on a new agreement signed by the 
Government of Peru (GOP) and the Government of Mexico (GOM) 
designed to improve intelligence sharing.  XXXXXXXXXXXX was on the GOP 
delegation to Mexico City for talks November 5-6.  This follows a 
GOP-GOM meeting held in Lima in February 2009.  XXXXXXXXXXXX also noted 
that there had been two previous coordination meetings between the 
two governments, in 2001 and 1996. 
</p><p>¶3.       (SBU) The purpose of the agreement signed November 6 in 
Mexico City is to "deepen the coordination and cooperation between 
the countries" in order to prevent and combat crime.  The agreement 
establishes a working group which will begin meeting by 
videoconference.  The first session is scheduled to occur December 
¶9.  Second, the agreement names specific persons who will be the 
liaisons for information exchange.  From Mexico, it will be the 
Head of the National Center for Planning, Analysis and Information 
to Combat Crime (CENAPI).  For Peru, it will be Colonel Cesar Arevalo, the head of the Office of Intelligence of the Anti-Drug Police 
(DIRANDRO).  The agreement also calls for sharing customs-related 
information.  In the accord, Mexico offers to share information 
about its proposal regarding the Hemispheric System to Identify 
Ballistic Fingerprints.  The GOM works with the FBI on this, 
XXXXXXXXXXXX said, adding that Peru is interested in doing the same. 
</p><p>¶4.        (SBU) In the agreement Peru expresses interest in 
learning more about the Mexican experience with organized crime, 
and seeks a workshop for police, judges, and prosecutors who are 
specialists in this area.  The GOM commits to sharing with the GOP 
information about specialized training in the field of synthetic 
drug materials and chemical composition.  The GOP invites the GOM 
to a seminar on precursor chemicals to take place in June 2010 in 
Lima, co-hosted by Germany.  Finally, the agreement calls for 
cooperation to reduce the local demand for drugs.  The agreement 
was signed by Maestra Marisela Morales Ibanez, the Assistant 
Prosecutor of Investigation into Organized Crime in Mexico, and by 
Romulo Pizarro, the head of the National Commission for Development 
and Life Without Drugs (DEVIDA) in Peru. 
</p><p>---------------------- 
Mexicans in Peru 
---------------------- 
</p><p>¶5.        (C)   Coca cultivation in the Puno region of Peru, on the 
border with Bolivia, is increasing, and Mexicans are behind it, 
XXXXXXXXXXXX said.  He noted that in the past year, 1091 Mexicans 
suspected of drug trafficking had entered Peru.  Authorities at 
Lima's international airport now have a computerized program that 
contains samples of real and fraudulent documents from many 
countries, allowing for better detection.  Also, very soon Peruvian 
authorities will have the ability to run the names of passengers 
through a database with Interpol.  Despite these advances, XXXXXXXXXXXX 
noted that many drug traffickers enter Peru with fraudulent 
passports, or by private plane that lands in a clandestine 
airstrip, avoiding immigration altogether.  XXXXXXXXXXXX was confident 
that information will be shared by Mexico and Peru more frequently 
and faster as a result of this agreement. 
</p><p>¶6.        (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX stressed that there are no Mexican cartels 
in Peru, but there are "representatives" of the cartels here. 
Their presence, he said, has resulted in a "climate of violence" 
including targeted assassinations.  For example, on June 30, 2005, 
Peruvian judge Mariano de la Cruz released Mexican drug trafficker 
Miguel Morales Morales (aka "Malamud") from prison.  Morales was a 
representative of the Tijuana cartel, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, and had 
been caught with 1750 kilos of cocaine.  Judge de la Cruz was 
accused of accepting USD 250,000 to free Morales.   XXXXXXXXXXXX also 
cited the case of judge Hernan Saturno Vergara, who was 
assassinated July 19, 2005 presumably by Mexican assassins after 
rejecting a request to set free 25 drug traffickers associated with 
the Tijuana cartel.  A third example offered by XXXXXXXXXXXX was the May 
10, 2007 murder of Mexican drug trafficker Emigdio Alejandro Pineda 
Jimenez in Lima, with newspapers reporting he was suspected of 
stealing 52 kilos of cocaine from the Tijuana cartel. 
</p><p>--------------------- 
History of Cases 
--------------------- 
</p><p>¶7.        (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX cited other notable cases in Peru in the last 
few years connected to Mexican traffickers.  Operation Lena 
(Firewood) in 2002 resulted in the seizure of 6000 kilos of cocaine 
in Arequipa, Peru.  The drug trafficker was Mexican Rafael Alvarez 
Navarro (aka Ricardo Garixax).  The Miraflores Case in 2003 
involved the detention of a Colombian drug trafficker, Manuel 
Rivera Niebla (aka Manuel Lopez Rivas) connected to the Sinaloa 
cartel in Mexico; he was working with Mexican traffickers Ricardo 
Antunez Medina and a Peruvian fisherman, Jose Manuel de la Jara 
Arrue, to export cocaine by boat from Peru to Mexico.  In the Pota 
Case in 2004, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, Mexican police seized seven tons of 
cocaine on the ship Colibri coming from Callao port (Lima); Mexican 
drug trafficker Jorge Perez was the mastermind of the shipment.  In 
the 2005 Maracuya case, Mexican drug trafficker Luis Gabriel Najera 
Estrada was caught trying to ship 408 kilos of cocaine in frozen 
fruits from Peru to Mexico.  In 2006, Bolivian drug trafficker Luis 
Amado Pacheco Abraham was arrested in connection with the seizure 
of 864 kilos of cocaine; years earlier he had been behind the 
attempt to move four metric tons of cocaine to Mexico via Air 
Bolivia.  In 2006, the boat "Ceci" was intercepted going from Peru 
to Mexico with four metric tons of cocaine.  In 2007, Mexican drug 
traffickers Ramon Francisco Guerra Gonzalez, Antonio Avalos 
Valencia, and Enrique Ochoa Garcia were caught with 108 kilos of 
synthetic drugs.  In the Paprika case in 2008, 711 kilos of cocaine 
were found mixed in eight tons of paprika destined for Mexico. 
Four Mexican drug traffickers, Jose Luis Romero Soto, Javier Gomez 
Morales, Ricardo Rivera Landell, and Eric Omar Angulo Urtusuastegui 
were detained in connection with the seizure of 210 kilos of 
cocaine in the Pirana case.  In May 2009, Peruvian flagged vessel 
"Fausaqui 1" was interdicted by a U.S. navy ship and found to have 
250 kilos of cocaine.  In June 2009, Mexican drug trafficker Saulo 
Mauricio Parra Tejada was arrested after police found 106 kilos of 
cocaine in his car. 
</p><p>¶8.        (U) XXXXXXXXXXXX provided the following statistics: 
</p><p></p><p>a)      The number of Mexicans who visited Peru in 2008: 
</p><p>106,590 entered 
</p><p>105,587 exited 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>b)       The number of Mexicans arrested in Peru for drug

</p><p>2004: 12 
</p><p>2005: 25 
</p><p>2006: 17 
</p><p>2007: 20 
</p><p>2008: 13 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>c)       The quantity of cocaine seized from Mexican passengers 
transiting Peru, in kg: 
</p><p>2003:     35 
</p><p>2004:    254 
</p><p>2005:   2133 
</p><p>2006:   1192 
</p><p>2007:    342 
</p><p>2008:   2256

</p><p></p><p>¶9.       (C)  Comment:  The agreement signed November 6 calls for 
cooperation by Peru and Mexico to fight a wide range of criminal 
activity; however, Peru is clearly most focused on identifying and 
capturing Mexican drug traffickers.  According to Peruvian 
authorities, Mexican drug traffickers are expanding their presence 
and operations in Peru.  Most of the Mexican traffickers in prison 
in Peru are low level mules.  Major traffickers (Mexican and other 
nationalities) have eluded Peruvian police.  This agreement 
represents a small step forward in tackling the growing problem of 
increasing presence of Mexican drug traffickers in Peru.
