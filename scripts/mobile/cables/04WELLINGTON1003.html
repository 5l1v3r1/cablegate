¶1. (C) The Government of New Zealand formalized diplomatic 
relations with Cuba in 2001, with its Ambassador resident in 
Mexico City accredited to Havana.  The GoNZ uses meetings 
with Cuban officials to express its concern over the human 
rights situation in Cuba (ref B), according to Mike Shaw, 
Americas Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
This is consistent with the GoNZ's policy of engagement with 
states that have poor human rights records.  Post is unaware 
of any NZ entity or nationals who would be subject to Title 
III of the LIBERTAD Act.  The GoNZ would strenuously object 
to any effort to apply Title III to a NZ national or entity 
on extraterritorial grounds.  The GoNZ is strongly supportive 
of U.S. positions on Cuba's human rights record, and use of 
Title III would jeopardize continued good-faith cooperation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Economically, Cuba was New Zealand's 45th largest 
trading partner in the year ending June 2004, with exports to 
Cuba at NZ$61.8 million (USD43.2 million) and imports at 
NZ$919,000 (USD643,000).  Of these exports, 97 percent were 
in the dairy sector, specifically milk powder.  Culturally, 
ties continue to strengthen.  In October, the Cuban 
Ambassador to New Zealand, who is resident in Canberra, 
hosted a film festival in New Zealand, in response to a New 
Zealand film festival held in Havana in February.
