¶1.  (C) Summary:  Leyla Zana and the three other 
recently-released DEP deputies hosted a lunch on July 5 for 
diplomats from the EU and U.S.  Although Zana and the other 
deputies said people in southeastern Turkey do not want 
violence, some EU diplomats -- and we -- left the lunch 
frustrated that Zana and the others stopped short of 
condemning the PKK (aka Kongra Gel, KHK, etc).  Zana and the 
others put forth no new ideas for the southeast.  End Summary 
 
A Media Event 
 
¶2.  (C) The lunch, which the Zana and the other hosts billed 
as an opportunity "to meet and exchange ideas," was a media 
event.  A swarm of Turkish electronic and print media was 
present outside the restaurant, and Zana and the deputies 
permitted them inside for photographs but no questions at the 
top of the lunch.  As EU President, the Dutch Embassy 
reportedly tried unsuccessfully to postpone the lunch due to 
concerns about media hype.  The Turkish Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) was reportedly also concerned the lunch would 
be a publicity stunt; although Zana invited FM Gul, no MFA 
official attended.  Embassy Ankara Deputy Political Counselor 
attended for the U.S. 
 
Zana Talks the Talk.... 
 
¶3.  (U) Zana made prepared remarks at the beginning of the 
lunch.  She cited the "winds of change" in Turkey and called 
on all parties to "forget the past."  She pointed out that 
she selected white decor for the lunch to symbolize a "white 
page in politics and a purged and pure political stance." 
She called for a new era of peace, reconciliation and 
dialogue, and pledged to pursue those goals "even at the cost 
of being politically isolated." 
 
¶4.  (U) She said that during her highly-publicized visit to 
the southeast following her release that she found the people 
there want to abandon "arms, denial, destruction, 
assimilation and separatist approaches."  She declared "the 
EU presents a new way of life for Turkey, for Turks and 
Kurds."  She called for the Kurdish issue to be solved 
"through peaceful and lasting means" and expressed hope the 
EU would grant Turkey a date to begin accession talks. 
 
...But Balks at Condemning the PKK 
 
¶5.  (U) In response, the Dutch Ambassador (as current EU 
President), the Irish Ambassador (the outgoing President) and 
the Austrian Ambassador all called on Zana to be more clear 
in her condemnation of terrorism in the southeast.  The Irish 
Ambassador pointed out that Zana had not criticized PKK 
violence.  (Zana condemned the July 2 bomb attack on the 
governor's convoy in Van, for which the PKK denied 
responsibility.  Yeni Safak columnist Fehmi Koru hinted 
sarcastically that Zana's condemnation of the attack proved 
the PKK is not responsible.)  Zana balked at the opportunity 
to condemn the PKK.  She repeated that her trip through the 
southeast suggested that "the people" in the southeast do not 
want violence although some "small, marginal groups" support 
terrorism. 
 
¶6.  (C)  The ex-DEP deputies were no more forthcoming about 
the PKK in one-on-one discussions.  Asked if he considered 
the PKK a terrorist organization now that both the U.S. and 
EU list it as such, Selim Sadak replied "ask the people."  He 
considers violence the natural result of conditions on the 
southeast, and compared it to the reaction of an animal poked 
at with a stick.  Sadak advocates a general amnesty for the 
PKK and more democratization in order to end violence. 
European Commission political officer Sema Kilic asked Sadak 
why PKK violence continues despite a string of improvements 
in the human rights situation in the southeast; Sadak replied 
"ask the PKK."  When UK Political Chief Ajay Sharma pushed 
ex-deputy Orhan Dogan on the PKK, Dogan told him that the 
ex-deputies do not have the political stature to break with 
Abdullah Ocalan and the PKK. 
 
¶7.  (C) Comment:  Zana and the others put forth no new ideas 
about the southeast at the luncheon.  Several EU diplomats, 
including the UK, Irish, Danes and Austrians, although 
pleased by Zana's release, left the lunch frustrated by her 
failure to condemn the PKK.  So did we.  End Comment.
