  ¶1.  C)  Summary  DHS Secretary Chertoff stressed with 
Mexico's Minister of Government Mourino the 
      importance the U.S. attached to greater access to 
Special Interest Aliens (SIAs) illegally in 
      Mexico.  He requested Mexico consider requiring 
passenger manifest information on a mandatory 
      basis.  Mourino conveyed concern about violence on the 
border and urged the U.S. to do more to 
      combat arms trafficking.  Both sides agreed to work to 
exchange more intelligence and deepen 
      cooperation as part of a concerted effort to disrupt 
smuggling and trafficking organizations 
      along the border.  End Summary. 
 
Merida Initiative Sends Important Message to Traffickers 
 
¶2.  (U)  In a 2/28 meeting with Mexico's Minister of 
Government Juan Camilo Mourino on the margins of the SPP 
meeting in los Cabos, Mexico, DHS Secretary Chertoff praised 
the Calderon administration's efforts to combat organized 
crime and the coordination between the U.S. and Mexico that 
has proven so crucial to this campaign.  He assured Mourino 
that winning passage of the Merida Initiative remains a 
priority.  Mourino acknowledged that Mexico needs the 
assistance the Merida Initiative promises but insisted Mexico 
considers the initiative as valuable for the message it sends 
to traffickers that the U.S. and Mexican governments are 
working together in their fight. 
 
Dealing with SIAs 
 
¶3.  (C)  Secretary Chertoff recounted how in the past Mexico 
had held Special Interest Aliens (SIAs) illegally in Mexico 
upwards of 30 days allowing U.S. law enforcement authorities 
access to them before their release.  He lamented an apparent 
change in policy that facilitates their rapid release ) 
sometimes in as few as five days -- often effectively denying 
U.S. officials access to these individuals, including the 
ability to obtain their fingerprints.  Separately, the U.S. 
was concerned simple release of SIAs allowed for them to 
resume their trip north.  Chertoff informed Mourino that the 
U.S. was prepared to assist in flying SIAs back to their 
country of origin, confident this measure reduced their 
prospects of making it into the U.S. 
 
¶4.  (C)  According to Mourino and GOM CISEN officials, 
complaints by NGOs about allowing foreign officials access to 
third country nationals had prompted Mexico to change its 
policy with regard to allowing USG officials access to SIAs. 
Mexico was prepared to share information it acquired from its 
own interviews with SIAs.  Mourino hoped adoption of a new 
policy in short order would require aliens to return the same 
way they had arrived within three days of release. 
 
Providing Manifest Information on a Mandatory Basis 
 
¶5.  (C)  Airlines flying to Mexico provide advanced passenger 
information (API) on a voluntary basis, which is then 
forwarded to DHS for analysis against lookout date.  CARICOM 
has agreed to the same but on a mandatory basis.  Chertoff 
told Mourino the U.S. was prepared to work to continue 
funding GOM cooperation on this issue but requested Mexico 
make this transmittal of API mandatory as was the case with 
many countries around the world.  Mourino said that he would 
have to look into this issue. 
 
Joining Efforts to Reduce Border Violence, Target Organized 
Crime 
 
¶6.  (C)  Chertoff Indicated that closer coordination in 
targeting particular organizations could strengthen efforts 
to reduce violence along the border.  Mourino agreed but 
conveyed concern about CBP's use of tear gas and the 
attention this was drawing in the Mexican press. Chertoff 
said the U.S. would look into adopting the use of 
interoperable radios at the command level as a way of 
improving coordination and consequently reducing violence on 
the border.  He suggested law enforcement authorities from 
both sides should strengthen joint targeting  of high 
priority smuggling and trafficking organizations.  At 
 
MEXICO 00000714  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Mourino's suggestion, they agreed to consider the Tijuana 
area of operation and to follow-up again in the near future 
to discuss how to advance this approach. 
 
Stepping Up Cooperation on Combating Arms Trafficking 
 
¶7.  (C)  Mourino stressed Mexico's concern about the 
trafficking of arms across the U.S. border both in small and 
large shipments via purchases made at gun shows as well as 
transshipments merely moving through the U.S. from third 
countries.  Mexico appreciated the USG's e-trace program but 
maintained it did not apply to large weapons and did not 
represent a solution to the problem in and of itself. 
Mourino was pleased to learn of "Armas Cruzadas," an 
initiative that would improve coordination among ICE, ATF, 
CBP, and other agencies as part of efforts to tackle more 
effectively arms trafficking but requested the U.S. do more 
to publicize this initiative.  Chertoff stressed the need for 
better intelligence on arms trafficking.  He conveyed a 
desire to revisit this issue in the officials' upcoming visit 
on the border. 
 
¶8.  (U)  Secretary Chertoff's delegation cleared this 
message.
