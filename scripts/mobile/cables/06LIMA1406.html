</p><p>¶1.  (C)  Jaime Yoshiyama, former Minister and President of 
Congress under Alberto Fujimori and top advisor to Santiago 
Fujimori, Alberto's brother and the Fujimorista Alliance for 
the Future (AF) party's candidate for First Vice President 
and Congress, was jubilant over the election results during a 
4/11 breakfast with Polcouns.  Yoshiyama said that the AF 
expected to win at least 15 seats in the new legislature, 
which would give it bargaining power with the two candidates 
in the second-round run-off to exchange AF's support in 
return for "guarantees" that Fujimori and former officials of 
his regime would receive "just treatment." 
</p><p>¶2.  (C)   According to Yoshiyama: 
</p><p>--  Alberto Fujimori has communicated from his detention in 
Chile that he is "very pleased" with the election results. 
</p><p>--  In addition to AF's strong showing in the congressional 
races, the Fujimoristas were delighted to see that their 
principle political enemies, Fernando Olivera's Independent 
Moralizing Front (FIM) party and Valentin Paniagua's Centrist 
Front, did so poorly (the FIM does not look like it will 
qualify for congressional representation, while Paniagua is 
on track to receive less than six percent of the vote and the 
Centrist Front legislative slate no more than a handful 
seats). 
</p><p>--  AF will also have a highly competent legislative bloc, 
headed Keiko Fujimori (Alberto's daughter and former First 
Lady), with the brains supplied by Santiago Fujimori, former 
Congress President Martha Hildebrandt, and Alberto Fujimori's 
lawyer, Rolando Sousa. 
</p><p>--  Santiago Fujimori will request permission to depart the 
country (he is being tried on corruption charges) to visit 
his brother and seek specific guidance on how AF should 
conduct its negotiations with the two candidates in the 
second-round presidential run-off vote, whom the Fujimoristas 
expect will be Union por el Peru's Ollanta Humala and APRA's 
Alan Garcia. 
</p><p>--  The Fujimoristas currently plan to negotiate principally 
with APRA, whose leaders they view as capable and 
responsible, as well as people with whom they feel they can 
"do business." 
</p><p>--  The Fujimoristas will also keep the door open to Humala, 
both as an incentive for APRA to negotiate in good faith, and 
as an insurance policy.  While the Fujimoristas question the 
UPP candidate's economic policies and ability to govern, they 
do not/not demonize him. 
¶3.  (C)  COMMENT:  The election results to date are 
everything the Fujimoristas hoped for (Reftel):  a 
significant congressional bloc (at least the fourth largest 
in the next legislature), the most voted for congressional 
candidate (Keiko Fujimori), affirmation of large popular 
support for Alberto Fujimori, and the defeat of their most 
inveterate political opponents.  While Yoshiyama stated that 
the Fujimoristas would prefer to swing a deal with Alan 
Garcia for the second round, he was also clear that they are 
prepared to talk turkey with Humala should the negotiations 
with APRA prove unproductive.  END COMMENT.
