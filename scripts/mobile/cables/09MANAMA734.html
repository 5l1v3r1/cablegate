<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>1.(C) We delivered ref A demarche to Sheikh Abdullah Al Khalifa of the MFA's Bilateral Relations Directorate on December 22. He took the points on board, but had no substantive comment. We followed up by phone on December 23 and Al Khalifa reported that he had discussed the matter with Undersecretary Abdullah Abdulatif Abdullah, who said that it was difficult for the government to justify to parliament PKO outlays at Level B when there are other GCC states with higher GDP per capita than Bahrain who remain in Level C. Poloff reiterated USG opposition in principle to Level C. He added that Bahrain's moving to Level C would send the wrong message and urged the GOB to reconsider.
</p><p>2.(C) Despite the push to move to Level C for PKO contributions, Bahrain continues to do its part in other areas. On December 16, a company of Bahraini Special Security Force Command policemen deployed to Camp Leatherneck in Helmand Province, Afghanistan (ref B). The GOB spent approximately USD 10 million to prepare and equip the group to support MARCENT operations. Current plans call for four consecutive six-month deployments. ERELI</p>
