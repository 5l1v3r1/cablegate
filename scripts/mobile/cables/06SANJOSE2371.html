¶1.  (U) In the past week, both Venezuela and Guatemala 
continued their diplomatic lobbying efforts in Costa Rica for 
the 2007 GRULAC UNSC seat. In a circular Diplomatic Note 
dated 18 October (Ref A), the GOV reiterated that "it was 
maintaining and would maintain until the end" its candidacy, 
because the "government wishes to continue to contribute to 
the advancement of activities (in the UNSC) for the benefit 
of the region and to represent the voice of the people of the 
third world." Venezuela's candidacy, the note concluded, "has 
the objective of fighting for the democratization of the UN 
and for international social justice" (informal translation). 
 
 
¶2.  (U) On October 23, the Guatemalans responded in kind, 
circulating a Note which covered MFA Press Communique 
122-2006, which detailed why the GOG was continuing its 
candidacy.  The full text is on the Guatemalan MFA website. 
Key points follow (informal translation): 
 
-- Given the "polarized environment" because Venezuela would 
not withdraw "gallantly," the normal action in voting 
situations such as this, the GOG sees only two options to 
resolve the impasse: either Guatemala continues its efforts 
to attract enough votes to be elected, or the GRULAC will 
have to find a third, consensus candidate "that would not be 
charged with the unfair stigma assigned (to Guatemala) for 
being linked to the foreign policy of a Permanent Member of 
the Security Council (the United States)." 
 
-- The MFA release went on to reaffirm Guatemala's continued 
candidacy and to "logically" reject the second option 
(withdrawal) as "unjust" for three reasons: 
a) with little effort, another country would be able to build 
on Guatemala's "intense" efforts to launch its campaign; 
b) Guatemala had built an "insurmountable lead" in votes; and 
c) withdrawing now would disqualify Guatemala to become the 
consensus candidate for reasons "not based on reality" (the 
U.S.-linked stigma noted above). 
 
¶3. (C) Given the extensive (and conflicting) media coverage 
about the October 25 GRULAC meeting, including the rumored 
contest between Bolivia and Costa Rica as possible consensus 
candidates, we conferred with FM Stagno's Chief of Staff, 
Antonio Alarcon, that same day.  He confirmed that Costa 
Rica's position, "in support of Guatemala until the end," has 
not changed.  Separately, President Arias was quoted by media 
on October 24 as reaffirming that a UNSC seat for the 2008 
session (not 2007) remained Costa Rica's objective. 
 
¶4. (C) COMMENT: We have no reason to doubt Costa Rica's 
position, which has been reiterated to us by Alarcon and 
number of senior MFA officials since October 16. President 
Arias himself made clear to USOAS Ambassador Maisto on 
September 29 that the GOCR was focused on taking the 2008 
GRULAC seat (Ref B).  Nontheless, the GOCR is no doubt 
enjoying the positive attention.
