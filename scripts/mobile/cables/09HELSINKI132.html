 ¶1.  (C) On April 3, PolOff met with Sari Makela, Finnish MFA 
Legal Counselor and Tony Paso, Counselor, Unit for EU 
Enlargement and Western Balkans (Kosovo & Serbia).  Makela 
said that the Government of Finland (GoF) intends to submit a 
brief to the ICJ by April 17.  She stated that the main legal 
argument will be, as she phrased it,"that territorial 
integrity can be overwritten in exceptional cases as a 
response to situations where opportunities for internal 
determination cannot be exercised in a meaningful way 
creating the need for external determination or secession." 
She acknowledged that this is an unusual case, factually, and 
added that should be taken into account.  Makela also stated 
that Serbia sent 80 letters this winter looking for support 
for their side of the legal argument. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Separately, Paso noted that the Finnish 
Parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee will be visiting 
Kosovo and Serbia in approximately three weeks.  A new 
Finnish Charge went out 3 days ago as part of the status 
upgrade from Finnish Mission to Finnish Embassy at the 
beginning of February.  The Embassy will be overseen from 
Sofia instead of Belgrade going forward.  Paso said that 
Finnish interest in Serbia is picking up as well.  He 
indicated that the Finnish Prime Minister is in the very the 
early stages of planning a Kosovo visit.
