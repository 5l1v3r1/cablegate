<br>SUBJECT: UPDATE ON DRUMMOND GAS DISCOVERY 
<br>
<br>REF: BOGOTA 7731 
<br>
<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>1 (C) The President of Drummond Coal Colombia, Augusto 
Jimenez recently met with embassy officials to give an update 
on Drummond gas and coal projects in Colombia. He also 
discussed expanding the La Loma/Santa Marta coal railway. 
</p><p>2.(C) Drummond plans to start extracting natural gas (reftel) 
at the end of 2007 or early 2008 in La Loma. Drummond 
currently has a 200 MW power plant that feeds the national 
electric grid. They plan to power their own extensive mining 
operation and sell electricity to the national grid for 
distribution. The company is also discussing a joint venture 
with ISAGEN (Colombia's largest electric company) to build a 
500MW power station in La Loma using La Loma gas and to 
generate electricity via an ISAGEN transmission line to 
Bogota. This is Drummond's preferred option. Drummond's 
alternative plans -- should the ISAGEN arrangement not 
materialize -- include exploring gas liquification for export 
or exporting to Venezuela through the Ecopetrol pipeline. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) Drummond also has exploration rights in La Guajira, 
with preliminary data showing  potential for up to 3 trillion 
cubic feet of gas, and is engaged in a joint venture with 
Ecopetrol for natural gas exploration in Sogamoso on the 
Boyaca plateau, with a potential of 9 trillion cubic feet in 
gas deposits. 
</p><p>¶4. (C) Drummond's primary business in Colombia remains coal. 
Jimenez estimates 2006 coal exports will reach 22 million 
tons (vice 26 million tons planned until Drummond was hit by 
a lengthy strike). Next year they plan to export 30 million 
tons of coal (mainly to the United States). Drummond 
estimates that between the La Loma mine and the soon to be 
opened El Descanso mine (in La Guajira) they have coal 
reserves of 2.2 billion tons. 
</p><p>¶5. (C) Drummond has purchased and rehabilitated the rail line 
from its La Loma mine to its private port in Santa Marta. 
This has increased the cargo capacity for coal from 20 to 35 
million tons annually. Drummond is building a second parallel 
track on the same right of way. When completed in 2008/2009, 
coal cargo capacity will increase to 80 million tons per 
annum. Drummond is also involved in rehabilitating the Santa 
Marta/La Dorada line for the GOC for a fee (not disclosed by 
Jimenez). The La Dorada line would follow the Magdalena River 
to an area some 120 kilometers from Bogota by air, but 
several thousand feet below Bogota in elevation. 
</p><p>¶6. (C) Jimenez also raised concerns over the future of the 
Santa Marta port. He reported that the GOC wants to 
consolidate the coal ports in Santa Marta into one central 
area to make the area more compatible with tourist 
development. Jimenez claims that he has data to demonstrate 
that environmental damage occasioned by the port is minimal, 
and that the existence of the port is compatible with the 
area's tourism vision. Emboffssuggested  Jimenez take the 
environmental concerns seriously, and for Drummond to take a 
forward-leaning posture in demonstrating their activities are 
consistent with tourist development since the potential for 
politically motivated accusations would be real regardless of 
Drummond's scientific evidence. .
