¶1.  (C) On July 15, Pol-Econ Couns discussed the 
Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) 
with Taha Macpherson, Senior Policy Advisor at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (MFAT) Security Policy 
Division.  PolEcon Couns noted the importance of the 
Convention, and expressed hope that New Zealand would support 
its adoption. 
 
¶2.  (C) Macpherson said that New Zealand would be represented 
at the July consultations by Gabrielle Rush, MFAT Senior 
Legal advisor.  Macpherson confessed that because of resource 
restraints, New Zealand officials are still trying to 
establish what they can constructively contribute to the July 
discussions.  Macpherson stressed that New Zealand 
nevertheless strongly supports the Convention, and will try 
to help ensure that the text is wrapped up by year's end. He 
added that USUN staff are keeping NZ counterparts in New York 
well advised on U.S. views regarding the Convention. 
 
¶3.  (C) Macpherson said that he hopes Ministers will soon 
approve New Zealand's negotiating position on the Convention. 
 He promised to share it with Pol-Econ Couns as soon as it is 
approved.
