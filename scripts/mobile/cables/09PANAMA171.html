SECRET/NOFORN 
 
(U) The responses are keyed numerically to the questionnaire 
provided in ref A.  Ref B is Post's previous SEPQ from August 
¶2008. 
 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
 
¶I. (U) Demonstrations 
 
¶A. Are there any ethnic or religious communities in-country 
prone to carrying out significant anti-American 
demonstrations?  If yes, please describe. 
 
(U) Capable, Yes. The Muslim community in Panama is estimated 
to be between 8,000 and 10,000 people.  This community held 
Anti-American demonstrations in 2007 but did not in 2008. 
 
  i.  (U) Yes.  On 20 December 2008, there were approximately 
60 demonstrators in front of the old chancery to commemorate 
the anniversary of the U.S. Operation: Just Cause.  This 
protest occurs every year and includes leftist labor unions 
and family members of Panamanian personnel killed during the 
U.S. invasion.  The protest was peaceful but did include 
burning a U.S. flag that a demonstrator had brought with him. 
 
  ii. (U) Yes, reference demonstration in (i) took place in 
front of the former chancery which is still considered a 
diplomatic facility. 
 
  iii. (U) 30-60 people. 
 
  iv. (U) When they have occurred it has been because of U.S. 
Foreign Policy Initiatives and military action 
 
¶B.  Are demonstrations generally violent or peaceful? 
 
(U) Demonstrations are generally peaceful, however there have 
been incidents where the protesters and police have clashed. 
When these incidents occur, there are massive traffic 
disruptions and property damage along the route of the march. 
 
   i.  (U) No 
 
   ii. (U) No 
 
 
¶C. Have any anti-government demonstrations taken place in the 
country within the last 12 months? 
 
(U) Yes, with the Presidential election scheduled for May, 
there are almost daily anti-government protests and marches. 
 
  i.  (U) Yes, anti-government demonstrations have taken 
place near the old chancery on Balboa Ave., usually in the 
form of walking marches.  Numerous demonstrations have taken 
place to protest everything from social security reform to 
transportation reforms, and from teacher salary disputes to 
construction worker safety. 
 
  ii.  (U) The average size of an anti-government 
demonstration could range from 15 to 200 persons.  However, 
on Aug 14th, 2008 various labor union groups representing 
teachers, nurses, and construction workers organized a large 
march in downtown Panama City that numbered close to 5,000 
persons.  The protesters marched from rally points to the 
Presidential Palace to protest against a variety of labor 
related issues. 
 
  iii. (U) Generally peaceful 
 
  iv.  (U)  No 
 
II. (U) Macro Conflict conditions 
 
¶A. (S/NF) There is no interstate or intrastate conflict in 
Panama.  However, the GOP continues to make efforts at 
combating the international narco-trafficking elements as 
well as elements of the FARC in the Darien Province. 
Historically the GOP efforts in successfully engaging 
narco-traffickers and elements of the FARC have met with 
mixed results.  However, recently the USG has noticed an 
improved interest and ability on the part of the GOP to 
interdict international criminal organizations. 
 
¶B. (U) N/A 
 
¶C. (U) N/A 
 
¶D. (U) N/A 
 
III. (U) Host Country Capabilities 
 
¶A. (U) Are law enforcement agencies professional and 
well-trained? 
 
¶A. (S/NF) The Panamanian police services are structured and 
professional.  However, they are hampered by several factors; 
non-responsiveness, lack of manpower, lack of technology, and 
lack of mobility all create challenges within the Panamanian 
law enforcement community. (Note: All of the U.S. law 
enforcement agencies within Embassy Panama report a good 
working relationship with local police agencies.)   Law 
enforcement officers in Panama receive limited initial 
training but future training opportunities are stunted. 
Additionally, the law enforcement community is highly 
politicized and aggravating this problem is the fact that 
there is no civil service system in place in Panama, officers 
and inspectors can be fired with little recourse or redress. 
 
¶B. (U) Have they been trained by U.S. Agencies? 
 
(S/NF) Multiple agencies at Post have offered a wide variety 
of training (ATA, NAS, LEGATT, DEA, NCIS, ICE, DOD, CBP, 
USCG, etc).  Specialized vetted units and individual officers 
and inspectors have demonstrated an ability to perform 
effectively but there are large sections of the police and 
security services which remain ineffective.  The 
effectiveness of the training has been hampered by a lack of 
appropriate planning on the part of Panamanian officials in 
respect to personnel rotation and lack of retention of those 
who have received specialized or technical training. 
Refresher training for those specialized skills is lacking. 
 
¶C. (U) Are law enforcement agencies confronted with serious 
widespread corruption inside their agencies? 
 
(S/NF) Panamanian law enforcement agencies are confronted 
with serious corruption issues.  The corruption issue 
continues to hinder Panamanian law enforcement, and almost 
weekly the local media reports another officer or official 
involved in a corruption scandal. At times the mentality 
within the law enforcement community is that if an officer 
does nothing, one will not be fired, so why risk one's job. 
Several Panamanian National Police officers were implicated 
in the kidnapping of a USC from a neighborhood in Panama City 
in April 2008.  Additionally, corruption within the Servicio 
Nacional AeroNaval (SENAN) which has the responsibility for 
maritime drug interdiction, is widely reported.  The former 
Director of the SENAN (then referred to as the SMN) is 
currently in prison and awaiting trail for smuggling, money 
laundering, and other illicit activities.  However, there 
have been some efforts with in the police services to combat 
corruption by the establishment of a disciplinary body and an 
internal affairs section to investigate allegations. 
 
¶D. (U) Are the intelligence services professional and capable 
of deterring terrorist actions? 
 
(S/NF) Yes.  However, host country capabilities are 
constrained by lack of resources and training that can limit 
their ability to respond and neutralize a threat. 
 
¶E. (U) Have the intelligence services been cooperative with 
U.S. Embassy requests? 
 
(S/NF) Yes.  The intelligence service is fully cooperative 
when they perceive that a particular issue, such as a 
terrorist attack, is a threat to Panama. 
 
¶F. (U) Assuming there have been significant terrorist threats 
in recent years, have host country services had any major 
anti-terrorism successes? 
 
(S/NF) Yes.  Two Iranian "journalists" filming areas of 
interest, to include the Panama canal and the airport, were 
briefly detained by Panamanian authorities in late June 2006. 
 Though not necessarily viewed as an anti-terrorism success, 
it is certainly viewed as a success for the Panamanian law 
enforcement community. 
 
¶G. (U)  Has host country been responsive to U.S. Embassy 
requests for protective security? 
 
(SBU) Yes.  From October 2006 until May 2007 and again in 
January 2008, we had an on-going protective detail for 
President Bush's daughter who had been living in Panama.  In 
2008, the GOP was very responsive in providing protective 
security for several USG delegations including; FLOTUS, the 
Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services.  The cooperation between Panamanian protective 
security and the embassy has been outstanding. 
 
¶H. (U) How does the Embassy assess the overall security at 
major airports? 
 
(S/NF) Good overall, very good for the region.  Tocumen is 
the International Airport.  It is a modern airport that has 
received major renovations and funding from US agencies to 
update and streamline the customs and immigration procedures 
and resources.  Each U.S. airline also employs private 
security at their individual boarding gates.  (Note: There is 
a concern that there is insufficient control or screening of 
passengers transiting Panama.  If a passenger arrives from 
another international airport, they do not have to go through 
any additional screening prior to boarding their connecting 
flight, except for those boarding US. bound flights as the 
individual airlines employ security personnel to inspect the 
carry-on luggage of all departing passengers.) 
 
¶I. (U) How effective are customs and immigration controls 
agencies? 
 
(S/NF) Average.  Panama does not have the technology systems 
to implement customs and immigration screening similar to 
what is found in the US.  Corruption is also a concern in the 
customs and immigration procedures. 
 
¶J. (U) How effective are border patrol forces? 
 
(S/NF) Average.  Technology, manpower, mobility, and 
impenetrable jungle greatly complicate border patrol 
operations in Panama's Darien province on the border with 
Colombia.  The FARC and criminal organizations operate freely 
across the Panama-Colombia border.  The FARC maintains 
semi-permanent to permanent bases in this remote region. 
Panamanian officials do not have a TECS or NCIC type system. 
If there is a BOLO for a person entering or exiting Panama, 
the authorities have to post the suspect's photograph at the 
inspection station.  Panama is in the process of creating a 
border police force with a greater emphasis in military style 
training and organizational structure.

¶E. (U) No. 
 
 
VI.  Transnational Terrorism 
 
(U) Transnational Terrorism Indicators 
 
¶A. Are there any foreign terrorist groups that have a 
presence in-country? 
 
(S/NF) The FARC has an established logistical network in 
Panama and has used Panama to launder funds, move arms, and 
transport narcotics.  It also sustains a constant low level 
presence in Panama's Darien province operating from 
semi-permanent and permanent bases.  In January 2006, it 
kidnapped a dual U.S.-Spanish citizen, and his Spanish 
citizen father.  The two were subsequently released unharmed 
in early April 2006. 
There are also "indicators" that money is being funneled to 
Hizballah and possibly Hamas from Panama to include the Colon 
duty free zone.  In 2008, the FARC kidnapped a U.S. citizen 
from a suburb of Panama City where U.S.G. employees reside 
and did not release him until February 2009. 
 
¶B. (U) How does Post assess this presence? 
 
(S/NF) The FARC can be categorized as support and finance 
cells (57th Front).  These cells have traditionally been 
logistical in nature, but there has been some activity in the 
Bahia Pina area where recreational fishermen from a nearby 
fishing lodge were fired upon by a suspected FARC go-fast 
boat which had apparently broken down and was adrift. 
Additionally, there were recent reports that elements 
associated with the FARC raided a village and robbed local 
stores of supplies. With regards to Hizballah and Hamas, 
there is a strong suspicion, as yet unconfirmed, that 
financial cells exist in Panama. 
 
¶C. (U) Is the host government sympathetic to these groups? 
 
(S/NF) In regards to the FARC, the Panamanian Government has 
historically had a "Live and Let Live" policy.  There are 
individuals within the Panamanian security services who are 
reluctant to challenge the FARC out of concern that the FARC 
would take retaliatory measures in Panama that the government 
would be ill-equipped to respond to.  As an indication of 
this attitude, the GOP generally prefers to refer to them as 
armed Colombian criminal organizations and not use the 
acronym FARC.  The GOP has recently expressed its intent to 
take a more active role in combating the FARC and the GOP has 
arrested several FARC logistical operatives in Panama City. 
Regarding Hizballah and Hamas, and other Islamic terrorist 
groups, the Panamanian Government is not sympathetic to their 
goals and works with USG agencies to identify any potential 
terrorist threat. 
 
¶D. (U) Are there suspect non-government organizations in the 
country that have a relationship with these groups? 
 
(S/NF) There is unconfirmed information that the FARC in the 
past has used religious NGO's to launder their funds. 
 
¶E. (U) Are there any ethnic or religious communities 
in-country that are sympathetic to these groups. 
 
(S/NF) Some of indigenous communities (Embera Wounaan) have 
supported the FARC, but Post suspects that this is out of 
fear and poverty, not shared ideology.  Four members of the 
Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) - Tied group Askapena 
visited the Kuna Indians in San Blas in the fall of 2006. 
The ETA affiliated visitors were reaching out to the 
indigenous population in Panama in an effort to strike up 
unity among the two groups and met with the leadership of 
several leftist student and union groups in Panama City 
before they left. 
Additionally, there are ten mosques throughout Panama, and 
between 8,000 and 10,000 Muslims living in Panama.  The 
majority of the Muslims are originally from India and 
Lebanon.  The Lebanese community conducted peaceful marches 
to protest the summer of 2006 conflict between Israel and 
Lebanon. 
 
¶F.  (U) How does Post assess the level of hostile 
intelligence services? 
 
(S/NF) The only possible hostile intelligence service in 
Panama with a history connected to anti-American terrorist 
acts is Libya.  Note:  The Libyan Government announced that 
it will be closing its mission in Panama.  However, the 
Russian, Cuban, Chinese, and Venezuelan governments all 
maintain diplomatic missions in Panama and while they may not 
foster terrorist acts are hostile to U.S. Government goals. 
 
¶G. (U) How does Post assess the availability of weapons and 
explosives in-country? 
 
(S/NF) Panama is a transit area for the illicit arms market, 
as such weapons and explosives are easily obtainable.
