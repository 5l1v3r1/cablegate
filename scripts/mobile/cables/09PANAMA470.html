Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)  "Thank you for convincing us to support this 
operation. It has really worked," Panamanian President Martin 
Torrijos told the Ambassador June 5, referring to Operation 
Goal Line Stance (aka Conjuntos-09). This DEA-funded maritime 
drug interdiction operation used JIATF-South and Panamanian 
National Aero-Naval Service (SENAN) assets (including four 
SOUTHCOM donated Nortech boats, two NAS donated interceptors) 
to effectively cut the Eastern Pacific littoral drug 
trafficking route through Panama from May 19 through June 4. 
The key to this operation was the GOP allowing a U.S. Navy 
asset, the frigate USS Gary, to patrol in and around its 
territorial waters (TTW) with an embarked SENAN officer 
coordinating with SENAN interceptor boats. The ship, 
stationed off the coast of Panama's Darien province, also 
made it difficult for FARC forces based nearby to resupply or 
carryout their drug and weapons trafficking operations. 
President Torrijos has authorized the operation to continue 
until June 26, and Post is working with the incoming 
Martinelli government to get open-ended approval to continue 
the operation. Vice President-elect Varela told the 
Ambassador on May 29 that he would support continuing the 
operation under the incoming government. Post strongly 
recommends that JIATF-S continue to deploy US assets to the 
area for the foreseeable future, given the demonstrated 
ability of the deployment to push drug traffickers away from 
the coastal trafficking route that is doing so much damage to 
our Central American partners.  End Summary 
 
------------------ 
Impressive Results 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  As a result of Operation Goal Line Stance (GLS), 
U.S. and Panamanian forces: (1) intercepted two go-fasts 
carrying cocaine, one possibly carrying weapons (the cargo 
was jettisoned and sank), and two carrying illegal 
immigrants; (2) disrupted four go-fasts attempting to 
transit; (3) seized 836 kilos of cocaine; and (4) detained 16 
suspects and 23 illegal immigrants. Most importantly, from 
May 21 to June 4 no go-fast activity was detected in Panama's 
Pacific TTW. Indications are that the Drug Trafficking 
Organizations (DTOs) in Colombia were aware of the presence 
of the U.S. and Panamanian assets, and placed a fishing boat 
on station to keep watch. DEA also received reports that 
several DTOs were getting frustrated, as multi-ton loads 
stacked up on Colombian beaches. The operation also involved 
coordination with the Colombian Navy, through TAT Colombia, 
and on June 6, as the operation was winding down, five 
go-fast boats attempted to break through. While two 
succeeded, three were turned around by the Gary and Colombian 
naval forces, and subsequently seized by the Colombians. In a 
conversation aboard the Gary on June 5, First VP and FM 
Samuel Lewis asserted that while the operation was underway, 
the murder rate in Panama had plummeted. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶3. (C)  GLS was designed by JIATF-S and the SENAN, following 
President Torrijos' approval for a U.S. Navy asset (a "gray 
hull" as opposed to a USCG "white hull") to operate in 
Panama's TTW (see reftel B). Panama has historically resisted 
allowing "gray hulls" the same access to its waters that it 
grants "white hulls" due to sensitivities about allowing a 
U.S. military presence in the country (see reftel A). 
Torrijos was convinced to allow the operation as a test case 
on hearing from the Ambassador about the successful 
deployment of the USCGC Sherman and USCGC Hamilton off the 
Darien from March  15 to March 22, during which period six 
go-fasts were seized. In April, the Ambassador explained to 
 
Torrijos that since three times as many "gray hulls" were 
available as "white hulls," a dedicated deployment would 
require approval for a "gray hull" operation. 
 
-------------------------- 
Operation Goal Line Stance 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  GLS involved the USS Gary and more than ten SENAN 
assets patrolling Panama's Pacific littorals (including at 
one point all four SOUTHCOM donated Nortech interceptor 
boats, two NAS donated interceptor boats, and a USG donated 
and NAS refurbished 82' vessel acting as a "mother ship" for 
the interceptors) from May 18 until June 7. The Gary 
concentrated on the area off the village of Jaque in the 
Darien, close to the Panama-Colombia border. SENAN assets 
were stationed across the Gulf of Panama. The SENAN's 
deployment was paid for with DEA funds, and they would not 
have been able to maintain their forces deployed without the 
assistance. Most events through the operation took place off 
the Darien coast, and in the future a much more modest SENAN 
deployment in or near the Darien should be sufficient to 
support U.S. assets in the area and allow for an effective 
deterrent. During the operation, SENAN achieved a very high 
level of operational efficiency, putting more boats in the 
water, and achieving better communications with and among 
them, then it has been able to do at any point in the last 
few years. 
 
------------------- 
Pressuring the FARC 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  In designing GLS, a secondary intention was to 
put pressure on the FARC 57th Front camp near Guayabito, on 
the Darien coast, where 57th Front Deputy Commander Luis 
Fernando Mora, aka "Silver," has his base of operations. 
Silver runs a drug trafficking and logistics network for the 
FARC based on his ability to move goods up and down Panama's 
coasts from his beach front camp. The area of operation of 
the Gary was in this area, making it very hard for the FARC 
to move drugs, weapons and other supplies either to their 
camp, or into or out of Colombia. Post has received 
information from sensitive sources that the operation 
substantially impacted the ability of the FARC to conduct 
drug trafficking, and that a prolongation of the naval 
presence could seriously impact Silver's operation. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Support of the New Administration 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  The Ambassador briefed Vice President-elect and 
Foreign Minister-designate Juan Carlos Varela on the success 
of the operation during a May 29 visit to the USNS Comfort. 
Varela expressed his support for continuing the operation 
under the incoming administration to suppress drug 
trafficking and to weaken the FARC in the Darien. 
 
----------------- 
Visiting the Gary 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (C)  On June 5, Torrijos, Lewis, SENAN Director Rigoberto 
Gordon and the Ambassador visited the Gary to be briefed on 
the operation and see the Gary first hand. Following his 
briefing, President Torrijos praised the operation and the 
positive effects it was having on crime in Panama City. He 
noted that the view of his government was that Panama's 
security problems were law enforcement-related, and that this 
operation had demonstrated that law enforcement means were 
the best way to confront DTOs and the FARC. Torrijos 
personally thanked the crew, noting that they were protecting 
the U.S., Panama and all of Central America at the same time. 
While on board, Torrijos authorized JIATF-S to back fill the 
Gary with a second gray-hull until June 26. He specified, 
however, that he did not want to turn the country over to 
President-elect Martinelli on July 1 with a "gray hull" 
operating in Panama's TTW. 
 
-------------------- 
 
Gray-hull Guidelines 
-----------------==-- 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  The standing rules for gray-hulls in Panama's TTW 
now stand as follows: Gray-hulls may only operate regularly 
in Panama's TTW as part of a specific authorized operation, 
and should have a SENAN shiprider on board. Other gray-hulls 
may enter Panama's TTW on the specific request of the GOP to 
assist SENAN, or if they are chasing a suspect vessel into 
Panama's TTW, as long as they have the oral permission of the 
SENAN Director or his immediate subordinates as relayed to 
JIATF-S or USCG D-7 or D-11 by TAT Chief Panama. 
 
------------ 
Thanks/Kudos 
------------ 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  Post would like to thank OSD, SOUTHCOM, 
JIATF-South, USNAVSO, and our colleagues in the Department 
for their support of the short-fuse request to support 
Torrijos' visit to the Gary. We would also like to give kudos 
to the Captain, officers and crew of the Gary, including the 
USCG LEDET, who did a fantastic job briefing the delegation. 
The concern and dedication they showed to their mission was 
one of the key take-aways for the delegation, and placed the 
role of gray-hulls in counter-drug operations in just the 
right perspective. Congratulations and thanks to all!

Comment 
------- 
 
¶10. (S//NF)  This operation has been a great success. From a 
political perspective, we overcame resistance to accepting 
the presence of U.S. Navy vessels in Panamanian TTW - and did 
it with such style we earned the President's gratitude 
instead of resentment. It was also a home run from an 
operational perspective: the suppression of all drug 
trafficking activity in Panama's TTW for over two weeks 
proves that with available assets the USG and our partners 
can push drug trafficking away from Central America's 
littoral waters. As RADM Nimmich, outgoing JIATF-S commander, 
told the Embassy's Country Team on January 15, the littoral 
drug trafficking route is so destructive of the societies of 
the Central American countries where it is taking place that 
it is putting their very stability at risk. This operation 
has shown that it is possible to block this route, at least 
with regard to Panama, by using a USN asset in close 
coordination with host nation assets, and with close 
coordination among neighboring countries. Post notes that 
JIATF-S has agreed to back-fill the Gary with the USS Carr, 
and encourages JIATF-S to consider making the deployment 
ongoing while Post works with the GOP to strengthen the SENAN 
to a point where it can take over this responsibility. 
However, Post notes, however, that the critical importance 
that sea based air assets have played in the success of this 
operation calls into question the likelihood that Panama will 
be able to take full responsibility for policing its own 
waters without USG support any time soon.
