</p><p>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The Finnish Embassy believes that despite the 
</p><p>bilateral frictions that the Argentina-Uruguay pulp mill 
</p><p>dispute has created, the mill project will open as scheduled 
</p><p>in October with a minimal possibility of violence.  The 
</p><p>Embassy discounts as spurious Argentine environmental 
</p><p>activists' complaints, saying that both federal and 
</p><p>provincial governments have politicized the protest movement 
</p><p>and resisted any attempts at dialogue with Botnia.  President 
</p><p>Kirchner has failed to see how ""damaging"" his actions have 
</p><p>been to Argentina's own international investment image.  The 
</p><p>Embassy praised the King of Spain's mediation effort, but 
</p><p>said this effort, as well as the GOA-GOU International Court 
</p><p>of Justice case, are ""going nowhere.""  The Embassy said that 
</p><p>the Government of Uruguay (GOU) has been ""terribly 
</p><p>disappointed"" with Brazil and Mercosur for its lack of 
</p><p>support in the dispute, which has in turn forced the GOU to 
</p><p>consider building ties outside the trade bloc.  The Embassy 
</p><p>said this dispute is ""vastly more important"" for Uruguay than 
</p><p>it is for Argentina.  The Embassy said Botnia chose Uruguay 
</p><p>over Argentina for this pulp mill due to the former's more 
</p><p>salutary environment with respect to anti-corruption laws, 
</p><p>rule of law, and forestry management.  END SUMMARY. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>-------------------------- 
</p><p>Pulp mill ""perfectly safe"" 
</p><p>-------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (C) EconOff met Ms. Petra Theman, Charge of the Finnish 
</p><p>Embassy, on August 23 to discuss the Finnish-based Botnia's 
</p><p>pulp mill project in Uruguay (reftel).  The Finnish Embassy 
</p><p>in Buenos Aires is 
</p><p>also accredited to Uruguay.  Ms. Theman has been in Argentina 
</p><p>for over a year, and appears to be very 
</p><p>knowledgeable about the pulp mill issue.  She described the 
</p><p>long and conflict-ridden history of this project.  While 
</p><p>neither her Government nor Embassy has any direct role in 
</p><p>this Finnish private sector project, it has at times been 
</p><p>drawn into the debate, and provided general advocacy for the 
</p><p>project. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (C) Theman said that the GOA, media and analysts have long 
</p><p>known ""perfectly well"" that the GOA and Gualeguaychu 
</p><p>activists have ""no case"" on the environmental merits.  She 
</p><p>said that it is well known that the Botnia technology is 
</p><p>safe, and uses the most advanced technology.  Theman said her 
</p><p>Embassy had been in contact with Greenpeace and other 
</p><p>environmental NGOs throughout this conflict, and they had all 
</p><p>long ago dissociated themselves from the Gualeguaychu 
</p><p>protests, recognizing early on the mostly political nature of 
</p><p>their cause.  She said that this particular pulp mill 
</p><p>technology has not been an issue for Greenpeace for a long 
</p><p>time.  She said that Finland itself has a dozen or so mills 
</p><p>exactly the same as this one in Uruguay. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------- 
</p><p>Mediation ""still going nowhere"" 
</p><p>------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (C) Theman said that the International Court of Justice 
</p><p>case between the GOA and GOU might last several more months 
</p><p>or longer, as it decides on the central issue of whether the 
</p><p>GOU violated the 1975 Treaty of the Rio Uruguay (joint 
</p><p>oversight of the river).  She said the GOU and GOA were 
</p><p>submitting reports and counter-reports to the ICJ, and this 
</p><p>could take time.  She said that, unfortunately, neither side 
</p><p>ever did exchange any actual physical note agreeing to allow 
</p><p>the pulp mill.  The leaders did verbally agree to allow it to 
</p><p>move forward, but other than ""some speeches"" to this effect, 
</p><p>there were nothing more concrete, which was ""a slight problem 
</p><p>for the (GOU).""  She said that the King of 
</p><p>Spain's mediation effort has also seen ""little progress,"" 
</p><p>although she praised the Spaniards for their ""great job."" 
</p><p>She understood that the King of Spain has high hopes to be 
</p><p>able to announce something concrete during the November 
</p><p>Ibero-American summit in Chile. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
</p><p>""Fifteen minutes of fame"" for ""uneducated"" protesters 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) Ms. Theman said she had visited Gualeguaychu, 
</p><p>Argentina, and Fray Bentos, Uruguay many times, and appeared 
</p><p>to know these communities well.  Theman said that many 
</p><p>Gualaguaychu activists liked to portray their town as kind of 
</p><p>""environmental haven, but in fact it is a big polluter.""  She 
</p><p>said that like many small Argentine towns in the interior, it 
</p><p>in fact has big pollution problems: factory air and water 
</p><p>pollution, solid waste, and the community's wastewater goes 
</p><p>untreated directly into the Rio Uruguay itself.  She said 
</p><p>that Botnia has for years attempted to inform and include the 
</p><p>Gualaguaychu community in the project: invitations to visit 
</p><p>Finland and its (identical) pulp mills there, invitations to 
</p><p>attend community information sessions, and many press and 
</p><p>information notices to local newspapers to counter the 
</p><p>""totally false propaganda.""  However, all such advances have 
</p><p>been rejected.  She said that Entre Rios Governor Jorge Busti 
</p><p>threatened to cut off all official advertising to newspapers 
</p><p>carrying any ""pro-Botnia"" advertisements.  She said that, in 
</p><p>fact, the very few Argentines who do attempt to learn more 
</p><p>about the Botnia issue, or even express neutrality, are ""cut 
</p><p>off"" from the community, and have even been threatened.  She 
</p><p>said that one journalist who did take up the Botnia offer to 
</p><p>visit Finland returned with a more ""open mind,"" but was also 
</p><p>shunned.  She said that another frustration for Botnia is 
</p><p>that, and contrary to what most Argentines think, 
</p><p>Gualaguaychu is actually around 18 miles away from the River 
</p><p>Uruguay, and even the small tourist beach area with which it 
</p><p>is associated is six miles away from a site across the river 
</p><p>from the Botnia plant.  Theman said that the ""educational 
</p><p>level"" of many of the most vocal protesters did not seem too 
</p><p>high, and that for some, the protest was an ""interesting 
</p><p>wagon to ride on,"" and an opportunity for their ""15 minutes 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>of fame."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p>Entre Rios Province and GOA's ""unhelpful"" roles 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (C) Theman explained that, as Gualaguaychu has 
</p><p>traditionally been Radical Party territory, the decision by 
</p><p>Peronist Governor Busti to joining the cause was an 
</p><p>""opportunity to co-opt this group"".  Now, he ""is more or less 
</p><p>stuck with the role.""  Theman also said that Busti has had 
</p><p>good relations with the Kirchners, was an early supporter of 
</p><p>then-Governor Nestor Kirchner's 2003 presidential bid, and 
</p><p>has also helped Mrs. Kirchner financially in her own 
</p><p>presidential campaign.  This close relationship has 
</p><p>contributed to the GOA's own support of this cause. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C) Theman said that her Embassy and its contacts are 
</p><p>certain that the GOA, among other groups, has financed the 
</p><p>protesters, and she indicated that these otherwise ""marginal"" 
</p><p>protesters had no other means of support.  She said that the 
</p><p>GOA has not been at all helpful during this near two-year 
</p><p>ordeal.  The Finnish Embassy and Botnia's main interlocutor 
</p><p>at the MFA was initially the ""very difficult"" MFA 
</p><p>Environmental Affairs official, Raul Estrada Oyuela.  (Post 
</p><p>has also found Estrada Oyuela to be recalcitrant and 
</p><p>officious.)  Theman said that Estrada Oyuela was ""totally on 
</p><p>the side"" of the protesters, and always resisted Finnish 
</p><p>attempts to talk or exchange views.  Theman said that there 
</p><p>is wide agreement in the Argentine scientific community, and 
</p><p>even in the GOA scientific community, that there is no 
</p><p>environmental danger from the pulp mill, but the GOA forced 
</p><p>its own experts to keep quiet.  Theman actually marveled at 
</p><p>the level of expertise among the Argentine environmental 
</p><p>community, in and outside government, but said it was ""a 
</p><p>pity"" that they could not speak out.  She also noted how, for 
</p><p>the GOA, this dispute was a great natural fit in the GOA 
</p><p>populist ""blame game"" campaign against outside interests: to 
</p><p>blame ""multinationals"" for treating Argentina as a ""waste 
</p><p>dump."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (C) Speaking more generally about Argentina citizens' 
</p><p>propensity for conflict, Theman cited the ""remarkably low 
</p><p>trust"" that residents of Gualaguaychu, and Argentines in 
</p><p>general, have towards their own government, businesses, and 
</p><p>institutions.  She said that a big contributor to this 
</p><p>conflict has been citizens' own lack of confidence and trust 
</p><p>in their own institutions, politics, politicians, 
</p><p>international organizations, and multinational corporations. 
</p><p>Thus, ""it was only natural to have little faith in Botnia."" 
</p><p>She said that perhaps the only institutions that enjoy a 
</p><p>modicum of trust or respect in Argentina are the Catholic 
</p><p>Church and universities. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
</p><p>Uruguay ""terribly disappointed"" with GOA, Brazil, Mercosur 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (C) As non-resident diplomats, Theman and her ambassador 
</p><p>visit Uruguay fairly often, and her ambassador has met with 
</p><p>President Vazquez and senior GOU officials.  She said that 
</p><p>the GOU has been ""terribly disappointed"" by the GOA, 
</p><p>Lula/Brazil and Mercosur, for its lack of action or support. 
</p><p>She said, partly as a result of this ""betrayal,"" the GOU, 
</p><p>including Vazquez, has mentioned its interest in reducing its 
</p><p>Mercosur ties, opening up more to the world in the ""Chile 
</p><p>fashion"" (i.e., opening much more to the rest of the world, 
</p><p>albeit with a foot still in Mercosur).  She said that 
</p><p>Brazilian President Lula will have a state visit in Finland 
</p><p>in the coming weeks, and Botnia will surely be on the agenda. 
</p><p> Theman said that, although it is widely assumed that 
</p><p>Kirchner has his hands tied in opposition to the mill, it was 
</p><p>actually GOU President Vazquez who really had his hands tied, 
</p><p>given the ""extremely fragile"" leftist Frente government, and 
</p><p>that Vazquez ""cannot go too far left or right to maneuver."" 
</p><p>She also said that there is ""universal"" support all over 
</p><p>Uruguay for this project, and that the issue is ""vastly"" more 
</p><p>important in Uruguay than it is here.  She agreed with our 
</p><p>assessment that, media coverage notwithstanding, this is 
</p><p>virtually a non-issue for 98% of Argentines. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
</p><p>Beefed up security for Finnish Embassy and staff residences 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (C) In response to a question if the Embassy or staff 
</p><p>felt threatened, Theman expressed a general sense of 
</p><p>satisfaction with security and that her Embassy staff thought 
</p><p>there was ""nothing to worry about.""  But as a ""precaution,"" 
</p><p>the Finnish Embassy had increased security at the Embassy (a 
</p><p>fifth floor office in a downtown high-rise) and at the 
</p><p>residences of the Ambassador and the Mission's three-member 
</p><p>staff. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>---------------------------------------- 
</p><p>Damage to Argentina's investment climate 
</p><p>---------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11. (C) Theman said that Kirchner, perhaps due to his 
</p><p>""provincial background,"" did not seem to grasp, in this 
</p><p>""globalized world of instant communications,"" just how 
</p><p>damaging the GOA's stance has been for Argentina's own global 
</p><p>investment perception.  She said that GOU officials from 
</p><p>President Vazquez on down know all too well that they could 
</p><p>never have undone this project (which they inherited from 
</p><p>the previous GOU administration).  If they had canceled the 
</p><p>project, she said, it would have been a ""monumental disaster"" 
</p><p>for their future investment prospects.  Theman said that many 
</p><p>potential Argentine sub-contractors and suppliers had lost 
</p><p>out on opportunities, many out of fear of reprisal from 
</p><p>Argentines.  Many other Argentine sub-contractors had already 
</p><p>lined up work, but had to cancel in the face of this 
</p><p>pressure. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------ 
</p><p>Why Uruguay? 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (C) Theman discussed some of the reasons that Botnia 
</p><p>chose Uruguay for its site in the first place.  She noted 
</p><p>that Argentina, and in particular, Governor Busti's own Entre 
</p><p>Rios Province, had itself courted pulp mills for its 
</p><p>territory.  Theman mentioned the widely-cited high levels of 
</p><p>corruption in Entre Rios province and Argentina as a whole, 
</p><p>compared to the much lower levels in Uruguay.  Theman also 
</p><p>cited several other important reasons that Uruguay was chosen 
</p><p>for the pulp mill project: a better 
</p><p>tree-growing climate and soil, rule of law, and relatively 
</p><p>skilled workers.  She particularly highlighted what she said 
</p><p>were the GOU's ""model, advanced"" forestry legislation, 
</p><p>management and long term planning. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------------ 
</p><p>Recent industrial accident at Botnia 
</p><p>------------------------------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (C) As mentioned in reftel, on August 14, there was a 
</p><p>highly publicized leak of a mixture of sodium sulphide at the 
</p><p>Botnia plant.  A small amount of this chemical, a material 
</p><p>with which Botnia employees routinely work, was accidentally 
</p><p>released in the air during a period of high wind.  According 
</p><p>to a Botnia press release, two workers downwind showed skin, 
</p><p>eye and upper respiratory symptoms, but according to medical 
</p><p>professionals, there were no major clinical symptoms. 
</p><p>Nonetheless, this incident prompted more GOA and activists' 
</p><p>complaints.  Theman said that a group of Brazilian 
</p><p>subcontractors, in violation of procedures, transported a bag 
</p><p>of sodium sulphide during high winds, and it spread about 12 
</p><p>meters around. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------------------ 
</p><p>Next steps: face-saving deal in the works? 
</p><p>------------------------------------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶14. (C) Speaking of the likely October mill opening - ""right 
</p><p>at the same time as the presidential elections!"" - Theman 
</p><p>largely downplayed any possibility of major violence.  She 
</p><p>said that everyone to whom she speaks on this matter also 
</p><p>dismisses the chance of violence.  However, she would not 
</p><p>rule out the possibility of ""a lone person or small group 
</p><p>doing something,"" like disrupting a shipment to or from the 
</p><p>plant, along the River Uruguay.  She hoped that during the 
</p><p>late October-through-early December 10 GOA presidential 
</p><p>transition, there might be a face-saving solution, but did 
</p><p>not hold out a lot of hope for this.  Theman said that one 
</p><p>possible deal that she had heard about was that, in exchange 
</p><p>for the GOU and Botnia delaying the mill's opening, the GOA 
</p><p>would withdraw its ICJ complaint.  But Theman herself did not 
</p><p>give this theory too much weight.  She said that that what 
</p><p>might likely occur is just more blockades and protests, which 
</p><p>would gradually taper off as the project goes on line and 
</p><p>""people slowly start to see that there really is no major 
</p><p>environmental problem to the mill.""  Theman was not sure if 
</p><p>there were even any GOA-GOU talks going on at all.  She noted 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>that GOA Chief of Staff Alberto Fernandez and GOU Secretary 
</p><p>of the Presidency (Chief of Staff) Gonzalo Fernandez were 
</p><p>three-decade-old friends from the University of Buenos Aires, 
</p><p>and assumed that they're in touch on this pulp mill issue as 
</p><p>well.  (These two reportedly met in person last week in 
</p><p>Uruguay, but no reports have surfaced on the content of their 
</p><p>discussion.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>-------- 
</p><p>Comment 
</p><p>-------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶15. (C) Most, if not all, of Theman's comments track closely 
</p><p>with Embassy's own reading of events.  The conflict has 
</p><p>always been mostly about politics rather than the 
</p><p>environment.  The coming weeks will be a sensitive time, with 
</p><p>the opening of the mill roughly coinciding with the GOA's 
</p><p>October 25 presidential election.  Post will continue to 
</p><p>monitor this case, especially for any indication of violence.
