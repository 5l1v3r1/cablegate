¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Several of Embassy's liberal and activist 
contacts have expressed distress over American policy 
regarding Lebanon, as well as concern about the ramifications 
of the current crisis on Egyptian reform efforts.  In a 
series of meetings with a range of reform-minded contacts, 
poloff was told repeatedly that momentum for political reform 
has been ""set back,"" and that the crisis has further 
radicalized Egyptians and broadened support for Islamists. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) In an August 6 meeting with poloff, Nasser Amin 
(General Director, Arab Center for the Independence of the 
Judiciary and Legal Profession) opined that the Lebanon 
crisis is a ""golden opportunity"" for the GOE, as it provides 
for channeling the Egyptian activist community,s energies 
into protesting against the USG and Israel, vice protesting 
against the Egyptian regime.  Asserting that, ""we have been 
set back 2-3 years in terms of momentum for internal reform 
in Egypt,"" Amin also observed, ""Kefaya and other reform 
advocates do not want U.S. pressure now for domestic reform, 
because if they welcome American support, they will be 
tainted as being traitors and accomplices of the war crimes 
the U.S. and Israel are committing in Lebanon ... the U.S. 
has become a pariah in Egyptian public opinion."" 
 
¶3. (C) During an August 7 meeting, Mona Zulficar (a prominent 
lawyer, leading womens' rights advocate, and member of the 
National Council on Human Rights) echoed Amin's comments, 
telling poloff, ""those who were pushing for reform before are 
now in the streets protesting against the 'Great Satans' of 
Israel and America.  All momentum for political reform in 
Egypt has been lost.""  Zulficar lamented that she had to 
cancel upcoming TV appearances to discuss human rights and 
reform issues, ""as I know I'll be asked about Lebanon, and I 
would have to declare my support for Hizbullah, because it is 
impossible now for even we liberals to make distinctions 
between the resistance that Hassan Nasrallah represents and 
the fundamentalist ideology he propogates - I must support 
him irrespective of my abhorrence of his Islamist agenda."" 
 
¶4. (C) At an August 6 meeting with Ghada Shabunder of the 
reform group Shayfeenkum (""We See You"") and Engi El Haddad of 
the Afro-Egyptian Human Rights Organization, poloff was told 
that the USG and Israel are ""systematically rallying support 
for Hizbullah by your appalling policies ... who can blame 
the demonstrators?""  Bemoaning that Lebanon will likely 
""overshadow"" reform activities in the coming months, 
Shabunder criticized the U.S. position as a ""betrayal"": ""you 
are pushing even secular, educated Egyptians to support 
Hizbullah.""  Both expressed anxiety about continuing to 
accept USG funding via MEPI grants to their NGO's in the wake 
of the Lebanon crisis. 
 
¶5. (C) In an August 8 meeting, leader of the leftist 
opposition party Al Taggamu, Refaat Said, opined that U.S. 
policy ""in support of Israel is further radicalizing Egypt 
and pushing public opinion towards Hizbullah, and therefore 
towards Islamists writ large ... You have created a new Arab 
hero - Hassan Nasrallah is the 21st century's Hassan Al 
Banna."" (Note: Al Banna founded the Muslim Brotherhood in 
¶1928. End Note).  Said asserted that the current crisis has 
resulted in, ""general enmity towards the central idea of 
peace, and undermined U.S. credibility in terms of pushing 
for democratic principles."" 
 
¶6. (C) Gehad Auda, Chair of the Helwan University Department 
of Political Science and reform advocate,  advised poloff on 
August 1 that, ""the U.S. must regain your honest broker role 
... the same Egyptian forces that were demonstrating two 
months ago for democracy are now protesting for war.  The 
dynamic has been radically changed ... the U.S. must 'hit' 
Israel somehow, rhetorically or via policy, in order to 
salvage the American image among Arabs.8 
 
¶7. (C) Unlike his counterparts, Hisham Kassem, liberal 
publisher of the independent Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Yom, 
asserted to poloff on August 3 his continued support of U.S. 
policy, despite Lebanese civilian losses, as ""we need to be 
in a war against Hizbullah.""  He nonetheless highlighted that 
he was ""troubled and saddened"" by the sight of Egyptians 
demonstrating in support of Nasrallah.
