  		<h1>INFUENZA CONFERENCE REVIEWS VIRUS SITUATION IN EGYPT Sensitive but Unclassified. Please handle accordingly. 1.(SBU)Summary: At the avian and human influenza strategic review workshop on June 22-23 in Cairo, the first ever lead by USAID, senior Ministry of Health (MOH) and Agriculture (MOA) officials, as well as representatives from UN agencies, the World Bank, and the Communication for Healthy Living Project, examined the H5N1 situation in Egypt and identified ways to improve prevention and control of the virus. Panel discussions also discussed the rapid emergence of the H1N1 virus and the potential implications which arise when in an H5N1 environment. End Summary. ------------------ Tracking the Virus ------------------2.(SBU) USAID and Egyptian authorities recognized that nearly three and a half years into Egypt's H5N1 program (the first human case was reported in March 2006), the time had come for an assessment of the overall on-the-ground situation. USAID's Dennis Carroll, Director of Avian Influenza and Pandemic Preparedness in the Global Health Office, posed two key questions at the workshop's opening session: how best to support GOE efforts to combat the virus in the next 12 months and whether current program investments are consistent with data emerging about the virus. While the detection of H5N1 human cases in Egypt is faster and the fatality rate is lower in comparison to other developing countries, Carroll stated significant problems and gaps in information remain about the virus.</h1>
