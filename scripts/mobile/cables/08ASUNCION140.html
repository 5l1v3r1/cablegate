<br>

¶1.  (SBU)  President Nicanor Duarte Frutos condemned March 4 
Colombia's actions in killing FARC Commander Raul Reyes, 
stating that Paraguay condemned Colombia's "external 
agression" and reaffirmed "the sovereignty of nations" such 
as Ecuador.  A confidential message from the Paraguayan 
government to the OAS obtained by the newspaper ABC Color 
indicated that Paraguay formally acknowledged its support for 
Ecuador and opposition to Colombia's action.  Ecuadorian 
Ambassador to Paraguay Julio Prado Espinosa told ABC Color 
March 4 that Duarte had expressed solidarity with Ecuador 
following Colombia's incursion into Ecuadorian territory to 
kill Reyes.  (NOTE:  Paraguayan diplomatic sources indicated 
to ABC Color that Duarte phoned Ecuadorian President Rafael 
Correa personally to offer his support.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶2.  (C) COMMENT:  President Duarte took a nationalistic and 
populist stance yet again.  This is in keeping with his 
ongoing domestic campaign prior to April's presidential and 
congressional elections here.  Duarte did not mention the 
Venezuelan government's response to the killing, and has 
avoided all press reports regarding FARC's presence in 
Ecuador in the first place.  As a result, Duarte appears to 
be balancing his own populist rhetoric by showing his 
solidarity with Ecuador and its ally, Venezuela, without 
taking the controversial stand of acknowledging support for 
Venezuela in this conflict.  COMMENT.
