</p><p>¶1. (C/NF) FM Miliband will travel to Kyiv on August 27 to reinforce support for Ukraine's European and Transatlantic aspirations, and to demonstrate British solidarity with the Ukrainian people during a difficult period, as he did with the Georgians during his August 20 visit to Tbilisi (septel). The Head of the FCO's Eastern Europe and Neighbourhood Team (EUR/UMB equivalent) David Bendor emphasized that the visit will not dwell on details such as WTO accession, energy or trade, but will rather be a morale boosting exercise for the government and citizens of Ukraine.
</p><p>¶2. (C/NF) Miliband, who will be accompanied by FCO Director for Russia, South Caucuses and Central Asia Michael Davenport, will also encourage President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Tymoshenko to put aside personal and political differences and pull together for the good of Ukraine at this critical period in the country's history and to disprove the European nay-sayers (read Germany) who have limited confidence in Kyiv's ability to be a productive Transatlantic partner.
</p><p>¶3. (C/NF) The visit will include a "major speech" which will deal not only with Ukraine's particular situation but with the state of the entire region, Russia's unacceptable behavior in Georgia, and the future of European political and security structures and institutions. According to Bendor, the UK Mission in Kyiv will extend an invitation to the U.S. Ambassador or Charge to attend the speech and subsequent reception with Miliband.
