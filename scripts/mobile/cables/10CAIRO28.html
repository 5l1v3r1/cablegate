  		<h1>WORLD BANK OFFICIAL FRUSTRATED BY LACK OF EGYPTIAN TRANSPARENCY Classified By: ECPO Minister-Counselor Donald Blome for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(C) Key Points -- The World Bank's lead economist in Egypt says that lack of GOE transparency is impeding the work of the Bank. -- He told us that despite claims to the contrary, the GOE intervenes often in foreign exchange markets, and that the methods by which they account for such interventions do not meet international standards. -- Though working directly with the GOE on projects, data provided by the GOE to the WB is often insufficient to do proper financial and budgetary analysis.</h1>
