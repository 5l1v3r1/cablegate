(C) During a meeting with Special Envoy Mitchell (septel), President Mubarak warned the U.S. against sending additional troops to Afghanistan. He advised that a more successful strategy would be to limit U.S. presence and work through the "tribes and local people." Additional troops, he argued, would create the same problems that the Russians faced during their experience in Afghanistan. "Tell President Obama that Egypt can help, " Mubarak said, as "we know some elements" inside the country.

Mubarak noted that he would be sending President Obama and Special Representative Holbrooke a separate message on recommendations for Afghanistan. Scobey</p>
