<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>2.(C) Deputy Envoy Hale met with Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa on December 5 at Bahrain's MFA to discuss recent developments in the peace process. Ambassador Hale told Sheikh Khalid that we were working on a package of measures to enable a resumption of direct negotiations. It was important that Arab states help Abbas put his political problems behind him to enable progress. The FM agreed, noting that Abbas' current weakness makes it dangerous to seek reconciliation now - "He can't handle Hamas on his own." Sheikh Khalid lamented that the recent Israeli settlement moratorium neglected "the central issue of Jerusalem," and said pointedly that, "There is no way we can sell Netanyahu's offer to our people or our parliament." He noted that we need the right atmosphere and people on both sides if the process is to move forward, and asked what could be done to strengthen Abbas. Hale stressed that political and tangible financial support offered the best hope to do so, and position Abbas to take steps toward direct negotiations when the time is right, soon.
</p><p>3.(C) Sheikh Khalid expressed appreciation for the USG's clear and helpful statements following the recent Israeli announcement. He reaffirmed Bahrain's commitment to the peace process and to the Arab Peace Initiative, adding, "You can count on us to help you." He said that he would point out to Egyptian FM Aboul Gheit the dangers reconciliation presents to Abbas when the Egyptian visits Manama later this week, and that the two would discuss how to best prepare the Arabs and the Palestinians so as to be ready once the U.S. has laid out the principles for direct negotiations.
