Â¶1. (C) In a meeting with PolMinCouns on February 25, Auditor
General of Canada Shelia Fraser said that she was "deeply honored"
that the USG had nominated her as a candidate for the head of the
UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). She asked,
however, that the USG withdraw her nomination. She explained that
she was wholeheartedly committed to serving out her current mandate
as Auditor General through May 2011, after which she planned to
take at least six months to decide on future employment options, if
any. She said that she was well aware of the important role of
OIOS and has known Inga-Britt Ahlenius for many years. She added
that no one from the UN had yet contacted her about this
nomination, so our request to meet came as quite a surprise. She
reiterated deep appreciation that the USG had thought highly enough
of her and her agency to consider this nomination.
