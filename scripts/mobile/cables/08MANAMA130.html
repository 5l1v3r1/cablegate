(Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Abdullah al Khalifa was in Cairo attending an Arab League ministerial.)
</p><p>2.(C) Ambassador told Sheikh Abdulaziz that Resolution 1803 specifically cites Banks Melli and Saderat and urges member states to exercise vigilance over their activities. Sheikh Abdulaziz said that this should provide sufficient basis for Bahrain to act against Future Bank. The Ambassador stressed to the Undersecretary that this meant either pulling the bank,s license or otherwise shutting it down. He added that if action was not taken within a week, the U.S. would most likely move to designate.
</p><p>3.(C) Sheikh Abdulaziz spoke shortly thereafter with the Foreign Minister in Cairo, who said that he would work to get "a political decision" to shut down the bank before March 11. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI</p>
