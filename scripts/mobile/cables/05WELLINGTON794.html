¶1. (C) Summary: New Zealand Deputy Secretary for Asia and 
Americas John McKinnon will visit Washington from October 17 
to 20.  He will seek U.S. views on evolving regional security 
architecture and the potential for improving the U.S.-New 
Zealand relationship.  McKinnon will acknowledge that all 
issues should be on the table in discussions of the 
relationship and, while there is no immediate prospect for 
New Zealand's repeal of its anti-nuclear legislation, he will 
want to hear why the legislation is still significant to the 
U.S. government.  McKinnon also will seek a frank assessment 
of New Zealand's chances for free-trade negotiations with the 
United States.  New Zealand remains concerned with its public 
face if it were to enter dialogue with the United States 
without knowing if a free-trade deal were a possible outcome. 
 End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) In a meeting October 12 with the Charge, Simon 
Murdoch, chief executive of the New Zealand Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), said that although the new 
government had not yet been formed, he knew that Phil Goff 
would remain as foreign minister.  Moreover, Murdoch knew the 
government-in-waiting wanted to be seen as responding 
constructively to Ambassador Swindells' suggestion for an 
enhanced dialogue on the bilateral relationship, which he 
made both to the Prime Minister and in his July 4 speech (ref 
B).  John McKinnon's visit to Washington is seen by the 
ministry as part of that constructive response.  (Note: The 
Labour Party is negotiating with minor parties to form a 
government after winning the most votes in the September 17 
elections. End note.) 
 
¶3. (C) As his visit's main goal, McKinnon -- the ministry's 
senior official responsible for the U.S.-New Zealand 
relationship -- will explore whether a durable process can be 
set up for discussing the bilateral relationship and what 
each partner can do to add value to that relationship, 
Murdoch said.  He added that New Zealand wants a constructive 
relationship.  While anti-American rhetoric from some Labour 
candidates during the election campaign might have suggested 
otherwise, New Zealand wants to think of itself as a friend 
to the United States. 
 
¶4. (C) Murdoch understood that U.S. officials in Washington 
viewed the New Zealand government as making a serious effort 
in pursuing possible dialogue and were prepared to receive 
McKinnon on that basis.  "We've gone down this track as 
realists, but what's significant is that we wish to get 
things on a different footing," Murdoch said.  Whereas State 
officials had told New Zealand officials that McKinnon should 
not come to Washington unless he had something to say, 
Murdoch remarked, "We'll come with what we can say.  It's not 
for us to determine whether we have enough."  The Charge 
noted that Washington officials have a lot on their plates. 
He underscored the importance of McKinnon either making clear 
what New Zealand can do for an enhanced relationship or, at a 
minimum, coming away from the visit with recommendations to 
the new Cabinet on what it will take to keep Washington's 
attention. 
 
¶5. (C) Acknowledging that the United States would want to 
include New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy in bilateral 
discussions, Murdoch said all issues would have to be on the 
table.  McKinnon will ask USG officials why New Zealand's 
anti-nuclear policy remains a matter of importance and 
concern to the United States.  McKinnon hopes to bring back 
an explanation that will register with his government's 
leaders, Murdoch said. 
 
¶6. (C) However, Murdoch noted that repeal of the anti-nuclear 
legislation would not occur  under the incoming government. 
While such action might have been possible before the 
September 17 elections, the campaign "sharpened" the issue 
and made a change unlikely, Murdoch said.  He expects that 
when the government returns to business and he asks Goff 
which issues he considers to be mandated by his 
constituencies, the preservation of New Zealand's 
anti-nuclear policy will be among them.  The Charge said he 
hoped this would not preclude the government from thinking 
about what it could do, if anything, short of repeal to meet 
U.S. concerns. 
¶7. (C) Murdoch said that, in any dialogue, New Zealand will 
want to discuss our countries' common interests, particularly 
in the Pacific region with the security architecture 
changing.  New Zealand is looking out for its own interests 
in trying to demonstrate its value as a contributor to the 
region's security and development, since it would be easy for 
larger powers to marginalize the small country.  The Charge 
responded that it would be helpful for McKinnon to spell out 
that motivation -- that New Zealand is acting out of its 
interests rather than out of ideology -- during his visit. 
If he also could be specific about concrete measures that New 
Zealand might take in response to changes in regional 
security arrangements, the Charge said that, too, would be of 
interest. 
 
¶8. (C) McKinnon will draw attention to New Zealand's 
contributions outside the region, including in Afghanistan. 
Murdoch said he will make the point that "somehow, our 
politicians have the sense that it doesn't seem to matter 
what we do, to (receive) constructive signals that we are 
valued."  The Charge said that U.S. officials feel compelled 
to thank New Zealand officials for their country's 
contributions in Afghanistan at every meeting because there 
was so little else to discuss. 
 
¶9. (C) Murdoch asked the Charge what other issues should be 
raised by McKinnon.  The Charge suggested that, while it was 
clear that New Zealanders desire to have some distance from 
the U.S. government, each government needed to think about 
how much distance is necessary or useful, and why.  Murdoch 
remarked that New Zealand is a relatively new country still 
defining itself in relation to the world.  He pointed out 
that New Zealand and the United States collaborate closely in 
the sharing of intelligence and that they could build on that 
cooperation.  The Charge warned that while such cooperation 
had grown rapidly, it would likely run up against limits 
imposed by the nuclear issue sooner or later. 
 
¶10. (C) Finally, Murdoch said another objective of McKinnon's 
visit was to ascertain New Zealand's ability to obtain 
free-trade negotiations with the United States.  The New 
Zealand government wants to know whether it is a serious 
prospect for a free-trade agreement and would not want 
McKinnon returning home without its status clarified.  "We 
can take a candid comment on that," Murdoch said. 
 
¶11. (C) New Zealand continues to believe what it was told by 
the Deputy Secretary when he was the U.S. Trade 
Representative: While the United States cannot commit to 
free-trade negotiations at this time, they have not been 
ruled out.  Murdoch said New Zealand is also mindful of the 
USTR's recent announcement on four other countries being 
priorities for free-trade deals and of the closing window 
before trade promotion authority expires.  New Zealand simply 
wants to know if it will be onboard the next sailing.  The 
Charge responded that it would be worthwhile to seek a clear 
answer, but cautioned that the USG might not be eager to 
close the door, even if New Zealand preferred a closed door 
to the current uncertainty.  He also urged New Zealand to 
consider whether some of its concerns might be better handled 
through bilateral investment discussions, especially if New 
Zealand were not in the queue for free-trade talks. 
 
¶12. (C) Murdoch noted that his government needed to figure 
out how it would publicly manage the relationship if New 
Zealand proceeded with dialogue with the United States 
without the prospect of an FTA.  In the meantime, he 
suggested that McKinnon's discussions be conducted under 
media and diplomatic radar.  His government will describe 
McKinnon's visit as taking advantage of an opportune time to 
exchange views before the Pacific Islands Forum and the APEC 
summit.  (Note: The Assistant Secretary and Prime Minister 
Clark are not scheduled to be at the Forum at the same time 
and are unlikely to be able to meet.  The New Zealand 
government hopes the Secretary and PM Clark might meet during 
the APEC meetings.  We did not encourage that hope.  End 
note.) 
 
¶13. (C) Comment:  John McKinnon is a smart, reasoned and 
pragmatic diplomat.  His visit is an opportunity to provide 
New Zealand with a frank assessment of U.S. views on the 
bilateral relationship, the possibility of dialogue, New 
Zealand's nuclear policy and its chances for a free-trade 
agreement.  The New Zealand government at times has had 
unrealistic expectations of the United States, which have 
contributed to the strain on our relationship.  McKinnon's 
visit presents a chance to quell those expectations and tell 
it like it is.
