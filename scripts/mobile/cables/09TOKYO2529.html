Ambassador to Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF)
Minister Hirotaka Akamatsu, the DCM met with MAFF Vice
Minister for International Affairs Shuji Yamada November 2 to
convey U.S. commitment to build upon progress at
recently-concluded talks in Santiago and reach an agreement
in negotiations on the future of the International Whaling
Commission (IWC). Yamada, along with Fisheries Agency
Counselor Joji Morishita and Assistant Director of the Far
Seas Fisheries Division Toshinori Uoya, readily acknowledged
that progress in talks in Santiago presented an opportunity
to move forward in the IWC. They urged the U.S. to show
leadership in this "last chance" to ensure a positive future
of the IWC, and said they looked forward to discussions on
November 4 with U.S. Commissioner to the IWC Monica Medina.
</p><p>¶2. (C) Yamada inquired about an investigation into the tax
status of the U.S.-based NGO Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society and repeated Japan's request for the U.S. to take
action against the organization, which he said created a very
dangerous situation on the seas. The DCM replied that the
U.S. places the highest priority on the safety of vessels and
human life at sea, and added that if any violations of U.S.
law are discovered, we will take appropriate enforcement
action. Morishita went on to say it would be easier for
Japan to make progress in the IWC negotiations if the U.S.
were to take action against the Sea Shepherd.
