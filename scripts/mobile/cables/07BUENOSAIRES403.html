</p><p>¶1. (C) Summary.  U/S Burns and A/S Shannon, accompanied by 
</p><p>Ambassador, met February 9 with Minister of Planning and 
</p><p>Infrastructure Julio De Vido and discussed the public 
</p><p>controversy over Embassy support for a proposed U.S. 
</p><p>company's investment, broader investment concerns, and 
</p><p>respective plicies toward Venezuela.  U/S Burns noted 
</p><p>concerns of some U.S. companies regarding Argentina,s 
</p><p>uncertain regulatory environment and our unpleasant surprise 
</p><p>at President Kirchner's public response to press stories 
</p><p>regarding a commercial advocacy case for U.S. investment firm 
</p><p>Eton Park.  De Vido noted the good mechanism for 
</p><p>communication he enjoyed with the Embassy and blamed the 
</p><p>incident on the local press.  U/S Burns raised concerns about 
</p><p>Hugo Chavez, negative influence in South America and 
</p><p>discussed the USG,s desire to work with Argentina, Brazil 
</p><p>and other democratic countries in the  region to promote 
</p><p>stability and democracy in Bolivia.  De Vido detailed 
</p><p>Argentina's plans for economic ties with Caracas.  U/S Burns 
</p><p>also extended an invitation to De Vido to visit Washington. 
</p><p>End Summary.

</p><p>U.S. INVESTMENT PROSPECTS IN ARGENTINA 
</p><p>------------------------------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (SBU) U/S Burns and A/S Shannon, accompanied by the 
</p><p>Ambassador, met with Argentine Minister of Planning and 
</p><p>Infrastructure Julio M. De Vido on February 9.  The Minister 
</p><p>began by highlighting U.S. investment in Argentina and noted 
</p><p>that several U.S. companies had signed recent deals and were 
</p><p>investing in Argentina,s energy sector, including that of a 
</p><p>USD 50 million agreement between ENARSA (Energia Argentina 
</p><p>Sociedad Anonima) and GX Technologies for offshore oil 
</p><p>exploration.  The Minister also said that several U.S. energy 
</p><p>companies are seeking business opportunities throughout 
</p><p>Argentina, including Apache, AES in Santa Fe Province, Duke 
</p><p>Energy in Rio Negro Province, and GE in Chubut Province. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>""THE LETTER"" 
</p><p>------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (C) The Under Secretary and Ambassador expressed their 
</p><p>disappointment over the public manner with which GOA dealt 
</p><p>with the Argentine media,s publication of a commercial 
</p><p>advocacy letter the Embassy had sent the Minister the prior 
</p><p>week on behalf of U.S investment fund Eton Park,s interest 
</p><p>in buying a share of Argentine power distribution company 
</p><p>(Transener) from Brazil's Petrobras.  The U/S said that the 
</p><p>Ambassador was doing his job of advocating on behalf of an 
</p><p>American business and was surprised by President Kirchner,s 
</p><p>negative criticism about being pressured by a foreign 
</p><p>country.  The Under Secretary stressed that such open 
</p><p>criticism of foreign investment could affect American 
</p><p>businesses, opinion about Argentina,s business climate. 
</p><p>De Vido said that he did not need to explain his President,s 
</p><p>comments, but noted that his office enjoyed good relations 
</p><p>with the Embassy and that the Embassy and the Ministry had a 
</p><p>good mechanism for quietly resolving such issues. De Vido 
</p><p>said he had considered the letter as coming from a friend and 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>not as pressure, but he had shredded it given the tendency of 
</p><p>things to leak to the press in Argentina.  He said the GOA 
</p><p>regulatory body had issued a negative opinion on the proposed 
</p><p>Eton Park investment on February 7, which may have sparked 
</p><p>the press story.  He said he hoped the incident would not 
</p><p>interrupt the good working relationship with the Ambassador 
</p><p>and that he looked forward to continuing roundtables with the 
</p><p>Ambassador and U.S. businesses, similar to the one the 
</p><p>Ambassador recently hosted with aviation companies.  Both 
</p><p>parties agreed to put the matter to rest and to consider it a 
</p><p>""misunderstanding."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>BIOFUELS AND A PIPELINE 
</p><p>----------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (SBU) The Minister said that Argentina is searching for 
</p><p>alternative energy and hopes that five percent of 
</p><p>Argentina,s fuel will come from biofuels by 2010.  According 
</p><p>to the Minister, they plan to construct 40-50 small biofuel 
</p><p>distillers throughout the country, each to group four or five 
</p><p>smaller farmers.  He acknowledged that Argentina,s biofuel 
</p><p>development was not as advanced as that of Brazil or the U.S. 
</p><p> U/S Burns explained the basis of the biofuel initiative with 
</p><p>Brazil, with its focus on research and development and the 
</p><p>aim of stimulating regional markets in North, Central and 
</p><p>South America, and the Caribbean.  The U/S noted that the 
</p><p>intention was to start with Central America and the 
</p><p>Caribbean, but that the U.S. had joined Brazil,s 
</p><p>international forum to take the concept global and create 
</p><p>worldwide demand and markets.  The U/S explained  that the 
</p><p>United States had promising new biofuel  technologies with 
</p><p>""enormous promise"" and hoped that private  investment could 
</p><p>help Argentina and other countries, beyond  Brazil, improve 
</p><p>their ethanol-based industries. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>BOLIVIA AND VENEZUELA 
</p><p>--------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (C) The discussion turned to Bolivia and Venezuela with 
</p><p>the U/S noting our desire for good relations and open 
</p><p>channels of communication with President Morales.  He said, 
</p><p>however, that relations with Venezuela were completely 
</p><p>different.  U/S Burns said that the U.S. was willing to 
</p><p>engage with Venezuela, but that Chavez was not interested in 
</p><p>talking to the U.S.  A/S Shannon explained that the USG was 
</p><p>interested in a positive and constructive relationship, 
</p><p>focused on concrete issues, such as counter terrorism, 
</p><p>counter narcotics, and trade and energy issues, with both 
</p><p>President Chavez and Bolivian President Morales.  A/S Shannon 
</p><p>noted that we have tried reaching out to Venezuela but have 
</p><p>been rebuffed on several occasions.  The  Under Secretary 
</p><p>noted that he viewed Brazil and Argentina as  ""guarantors of 
</p><p>stability"" in the region, but warned that  Venezuela,s 
</p><p>growing influence was more of a ""danger here  (South America) 
</p><p>than in the United States."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (SBU) De Vido explained that the GOA had good relations 
</p><p>with Chavez based on economic and commercial issues.  He 
</p><p>described the 2004 ""fiduciary exchange"" agreement the 
</p><p>countries signed in which Argentina would buy winter fuel 
</p><p>oil and Venezuela would, in turn, use these revenues to buy 
</p><p>Argentine agriculture products, tractors, healthcare 
</p><p>supplies, and other industrial products. This agreement had 
</p><p>grown from USD 200-300 million in 2004, to USD 800 in 2006. 
</p><p>He also described the joint exploration deal between 
</p><p>ENARSA/PDVSA in the Ayacucho area of the Orinoco Basin.  He 
</p><p>said this was the largest of Argentina,s ventures with 
</p><p>Venezuela, noting that the potential yield from the venture 
</p><p>could equal Argentina,s known petroleum reserves.  De Vido 
</p><p>said that they were looking to partner with private companies 
</p><p>as well.  Finally the Minister also described plans (with a 
</p><p>laser pointer on the map) to build an oil pipeline linking 
</p><p>Venezuela with Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia by 2015.  The 
</p><p>Minister noted several pending gas pipeline issues with 
</p><p>Bolivia. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (C) De Vido noted that these were very ""particular"" times 
</p><p>politically in Venezuela.  He said, ""We would not say that 
</p><p>Venezuela was not a democracy, although it is not like the 
</p><p>U.S., Argentina or Brazil.  Each democracy is different."" 
</p><p>He further opined that he understood U.S. concerns with 
</p><p>Venezuela and that the GOA too had been surprised by his 
</p><p>radical rhetoric, but that he did not see Chavez as a danger, 
</p><p>that he was mostly talk, but that he needed to be contained. 
</p><p>Bringing Chavez into MERCOSUR, De Vido said, was just such an 
</p><p>effort.  He noted the growing common interests between Brazil 
</p><p>and Argentina -- much like the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. 
</p><p>and Mexico -- but asserted that a three-way dialogue was 
</p><p>necessary.  The Minister suggested that a tripartite dialogue 
</p><p>between Argentina, Brazil and the U.S. was the best bet for 
</p><p>guaranteeing regional stability.  He urged the U/S and A/S to 
</p><p>consider organizing such a three-way discussion. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (U) The Under Secretary closed the meeting by inviting the 
</p><p>Minister to visit the United States in the near future, 
</p><p>perhaps when he traveled to Atlanta to participate in 
</p><p>Secretary Gutierrez' competitiveness forum.
