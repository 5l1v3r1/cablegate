Ambassador and acting SIRO chief on July 21 that the GOJ
received a request for overflight permission, and denied it.
He said Syrian authorities complained to him about the GOJ,s
refusal; Dhahabi claimed to have replied that Syrian behavior
that was threatening to the interests of Jordan and the
region, and that Syria's facilitation of Iranian support for
Hizballah should cease. He told the Ambassador he had
suggested to the King that the flight be shot down if it
violated Jordanian airspace; he said the King was reserved
about that idea and suggested it be forced to land instead.
Dhahabi viewed the overflight request as further evidence the
Iranians think they are on the offensive and can bully others
in the region.
