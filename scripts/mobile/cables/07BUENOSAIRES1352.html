</p><p>------- 
</p><p>Summary 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶1. (C) Major U.S. investment fund Eton Park's two year effort 
</p><p>to buy a minority stake in Argentina's regulated electricity 
</p><p>transmission grid from Brazil's Petrobras offers a snapshot 
</p><p>of GoA machinations to favor local -- and presumably more 
</p><p>easily controlled -- capital investment in strategic assets. 
</p><p>It also offers insight into how less than transparent 
</p><p>mechanisms have reportedly been used by the GoA Planning 
</p><p>Ministry to reward friends and allies of the Kirchner 
</p><p>administration.  Eton Park officials outlined to Ambassador 
</p><p>their legal efforts to overturn the GoA's February 2007 
</p><p>rejection of Eton Park's bid in favor of a competing joint 
</p><p>bid by Electro Ingeneria, an Argentine construction company 
</p><p>close to the Kirchner administration, and a state-owned 
</p><p>energy company.  The GoA claims that Eton Park had neither 
</p><p>experience in the sector nor the long-term commitment 
</p><p>required to run a public service company effectively. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (C) Eton Park alleges that Planning Minister Julio De Vido 
</p><p>stands to directly benefit from Electro Ingeneria being 
</p><p>selected and so he interfered to stymie Eton Park's efforts 
</p><p>to have its bid reconsidered.  Eton Park also alleges that 
</p><p>ABN-AMRO bank agreed - at the behest of Venezuelan President 
</p><p>Chavez and against the bank's better judgment - to fund a 
</p><p>loan to support Electro Ingeneria's counter-offer.  According 
</p><p>to Eton Park, Chavez made this financing a quid pro quo for 
</p><p>ABN to continue to do business with the GoV.  Eton Park is 
</p><p>currently considering an appeal to the Argentine Supreme 
</p><p>Court.  Other sources tell us that, irrespective of whatever 
</p><p>corruption may be involved, top GoA officials want national 
</p><p>businessmen to control key economic sectors and that, had 
</p><p>Eton Park played its cards a bit differently, it might have 
</p><p>been allowed to be a major shareholder in an ""Argentine"" 
</p><p>appearing entity. End Summary. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p>GoA Forces Petrobras to Divest Transener Stake 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (SBU) Ambassador met July 10 with Dirk Donath, New 
</p><p>York-based Managing Director of U.S. investment fund Eton 
</p><p>Park and with Federico Ravazzani, local Eton Park 
</p><p>representative and head of Buenos Aires-based Pent Capital, 
</p><p>to review the state-of-play of Eton Park's efforts to 
</p><p>purchase a minority 26% stake in Argentina's regulated 
</p><p>national electricity transmission grid from Brazil's 
</p><p>Petrobras. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (U) In 2003 Petrobras acquired Pecom Energa from the 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Perez Companc Group, becoming the second largest oil producer 
</p><p>in Argentina.  One of the numerous Argentine energy sector 
</p><p>assets held by Pecom Energia was its 50% stake in Compania 
</p><p>Inversora en Transmisin Electrica (""Citelec""), the 
</p><p>controlling 52% shareholder in Argentina's electricity 
</p><p>transmission company  Compana de Transporte de Energia 
</p><p>Elctrica S.A. (""Transener"").  Due to antitrust 
</p><p>considerations, GoA authorities ordered Petrobras to divest 
</p><p>its interests in Transener and other electricity transmission 
</p><p>companies.  In September 2005, Eton Park Capital Management 
</p><p>began discussions with Petrobras to acquire its 50% equity 
</p><p>stake in Citelec and a 20% stake in Yacylec. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (U) Transener is Argentina's largest electricity 
</p><p>transmission company (95% market share) which also controls 
</p><p>Transba (electricity transmission in the province of Buenos 
</p><p>Aires) and Transener International (a foreign subsidiary 
</p><p>conducting non-regulated electricity transmission businesses 
</p><p>in Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Paraguay and Panama).  Yacylec is 
</p><p>an Argentine company responsible for the operation and 
</p><p>maintenance of 281 km of electric lines between the Yacyret 
</p><p>Hydroelectric Power Station (Corrientes province) and 
</p><p>Resistencia (Chaco province). 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- 
</p><p>Eton Park Agrees to Purchase Petrobras' Stake 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (U) Eton Park, one of the world's largest investment funds 
</p><p>with over $5 billion under management, is managed by a group 
</p><p>of former Goldman Sachs partners headed by Eric Mindich.  The 
</p><p>fund acquired significant investments in power and utilities 
</p><p>elsewhere in Latin America through its purchase of a stake in 
</p><p>Prisma, the company that acquired Enron,s international 
</p><p>portfolio from Enron,s creditors in early 2006. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (U) In August 2006, Eton Park and Petrobras agreed on 
</p><p>terms and conditions for Eton Park to acquire Petrobras' 
</p><p>entire stake in Transener and signed a stock purchase 
</p><p>agreement for Eton Park to pay $54 million for the Citelec 
</p><p>shares and $6 million for the Yacylec shares.  Eton Park made 
</p><p>a $12 million, 20% down-payment to Petrobras with the stock 
</p><p>purchase agreement to become effective once regulatory 
</p><p>approval was granted by the GoA's electricity regulator, the 
</p><p>Ente Nacional Regulador de la Electricidad (ENRE); by the GoA 
</p><p>Ministry of Economy's Secretary of Energy Daniel Cameron; and 
</p><p>by the GoA's anti-trust body, the Comision Nacional de 
</p><p>Defensa de la Competencia (CNDC). 
</p><p> 
</p><p>-------------------------------------------- 
</p><p>GoA: Maintaining Argentine Operating Control 
</p><p>-------------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (SBU) Petrobras' local partner in Transener was Pampa 
</p><p>Holdings (formerly the Dolphin Group), an Argentine-managed 
</p><p>investment fund controlled by prominent entrepreneur Marcelo 
</p><p>Mindlin.  Eton Park's Donath estimates that 90-95% of Pampa's 
</p><p>capital is, in fact, held by U.S. and European investors, 
</p><p>with Eton Park itself one of Pampa Holding's three largest 
</p><p>investors.  Pampa and Eton Park were to share control of 
</p><p>Transener once the Eton Park acquisition won regulatory 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>approval.  To address GoA concerns about maintaining 
</p><p>Argentine operating control of the entity, Eton Park had 
</p><p>granted Pampa the right to name the President and CEO of 
</p><p>Transener.  According to Eton Park, Pampa had developed a 
</p><p>close working relationship with Eton Park, was supportive of 
</p><p>Eton Park,s acquisition of the Petrobras stake in Transener, 
</p><p>and had made this known to Planning Minister De Vido and to 
</p><p>President Kirchner on several occasions. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (C) By September 2006, Eton Park had presented all 
</p><p>required documentation to GoA regulatory agencies involved. 
</p><p>According to Eton Park, both the Energy Secretary and the 
</p><p>CNDC had told them unofficially that they had no objection to 
</p><p>the transaction going forward.  Eton Park then met numerous 
</p><p>times with ENRE officials and also held private meetings with 
</p><p>President Kirchner and with Minister De Vido during September 
</p><p>2006 UNGA meetings in New York, and again with Minister De 
</p><p>Vido November 17 in Buenos Aires.  At that last meeting, Eton 
</p><p>Park reported De Vido confirmed there were no/no GoA 
</p><p>objections to the transaction and that he believed all 
</p><p>regulatory approvals would be forthcoming shortly. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p>GoA 180: Electro-Ingeneria as National Champion 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (C) During January 2007 conversations with EconCouns, 
</p><p>Eton Park expressed concern at ongoing delays in regulatory 
</p><p>approval and market rumors that Planning Minister De Vido had 
</p><p>decided -- late in the game -- to go back on his earlier 
</p><p>assurances to Eton Park and instead favor a rival bid for 
</p><p>Petrobras' stake in Transener by Cordoba-based construction 
</p><p>company Electro Ingeneria (EI).  Eton Park noted that EI's 
</p><p>book of public infrastructure project business, including the 
</p><p>construction of electricity transmission lines for Transener, 
</p><p>had had grown dramatically during the Kirchner 
</p><p>administration; that De Vido's son worked for EI, and that De 
</p><p>Vido himself likely had a ""personal stake"" in EI's success. 
</p><p>Eton Park also noted that EI principal Gerardo Luis Ferreyra 
</p><p>was an ex-Montonero guerilla who, during the 1976-82 military 
</p><p>dictatorship, had shared a cell with current Presidential 
</p><p>Legal and Technical Secretary (and close confidant) Carlos 
</p><p>Zanini.  Eton Park noted that Ferreyra had accompanied De 
</p><p>Vido (along with other Argentine businessmen) to Germany in 
</p><p>January 2007 and they believe that, during that trip, the 
</p><p>decision was taken to give the deal to EI. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11. (C) Ambassador Met January 15 with Planning Minister De 
</p><p>Vido to raise a number of U.S. company advocacy issues, 
</p><p>including Eton Park (Ref A).   When Ambassador noted Eton 
</p><p>Park's concerns over ongoing delays in regulatory approval, 
</p><p>De Vido replied that he understood Petrobras was still in the 
</p><p>process of accepting bids from potential buyers.  Eton Park 
</p><p>later confirmed that De Vido was well aware that Eton Park 
</p><p>had signed a binding stock purchase agreement with Petrobras 
</p><p>months earlier.  At Eton Park's request, an advocacy letter 
</p><p>from Ambassador to De Vido was sent in late January 2007 
</p><p>noting that final GoA approval of Eton Park,s investment in 
</p><p>Transener would be seen as a positive signal by the GoA to 
</p><p>the institutional investment community in the United States. 
</p><p>The letter also noted that, at a time when Argentina was 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>seeking expanded foreign direct investment in strategic 
</p><p>sectors related to infrastructure and energy, Eton Park,s 
</p><p>interest should be welcome. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (SBU) On January 29, Argentina's largest daily, Clarin, 
</p><p>reported that the GoA was considering rejecting the sale of 
</p><p>Transener to Eton Park in favor of a new competing joint bid 
</p><p>by Electro Ingeneria and recently formed state-owned energy 
</p><p>company ENARSA.  On February 8, President Kirchner reacted 
</p><p>angrily to follow-on press reports in Clarin of the existence 
</p><p>(but not the text) of the Ambassador's advocacy letter on 
</p><p>behalf of ""a U.S. company.""  Kirchner stated that his 
</p><p>administration was transparent and that Argentina was not a 
</p><p>""banana republic"" that could be pushed into making decisions. 
</p><p> On February 9, the CNDC officially rejected Eton Park's bid, 
</p><p>claiming that it had neither ""roots"" nor experience in the 
</p><p>sector and that, as an investment fund, it did not have the 
</p><p>long-term commitment required to run a public service company 
</p><p>effectively.  Local media interpreted the President's 
</p><p>statement and the subsequent CNDC opinion as a GoA effort to 
</p><p>retain national control of a strategic energy sector.  Media 
</p><p>also noted that the Electro Ingeneria/ENARSA consortium would 
</p><p>have to seek public or private sector funding in order to 
</p><p>match Eton Park's bid. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (C) Eton Park appealed the CNDC ruling in March 2007 to 
</p><p>the Argentine Civil and Commercial Appeals Court, confiding 
</p><p>to EconCouns that its legal counsel considered the CNDC's 
</p><p>ruling weak and easily overturned.  However on June 22, the 
</p><p>3-judge appeals court rejected Eton Park's appeal, opening 
</p><p>the way for Electro Ingeneria's bid to go forward.  The 
</p><p>Appeals court judge ruled that the GoA had ""complied with its 
</p><p>duty to safeguard the public interest,"" and also argued that 
</p><p>Eton Park had not demonstrated sufficiently that it had 
</p><p>electricity sector experience. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------- 
</p><p>(C) Eton Park Alleges Foul Play 
</p><p>------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶14. (C) In a July 10 meeting with the Ambassador, Eton Park 
</p><p>principals noted that they had heard from reliable sources 
</p><p>that an Argentine Appeals Court ruling favorable to Eton Park 
</p><p>was originally to have been issued in early June.   With this 
</p><p>same information, Eton Park alleged, Electro Ingeneria filed 
</p><p>for a two week stay that permitted Planning Minister De Vido 
</p><p>sufficient time to have the Appeals Court ruling re-written. 
</p><p>Some in the GoA had been able to influence Appeals Court 
</p><p>judges, Eton Park alleged, by threatening to publish recorded 
</p><p>phone conversations that would have been embarrassing to some 
</p><p>or all of the judges on the appeals panel. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶15. (C) Earlier in May, confident that the Appeals ruling 
</p><p>would be favorable, Eton Park had floated a proposal to the 
</p><p>GoA to address its concerns about keeping Transener under 
</p><p>""national control"":  Eton Park had approached Gerardo 
</p><p>Wertheim, principal of the prominent Argentine Wertheim 
</p><p>family group that has substantial interests in Argentine 
</p><p>financial services, natural gas transportation infrastructure 
</p><p>and paper mills.  To provide a local face to the transaction, 
</p><p>the Wertheim group agreed to hold a 51% voting share in an 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Eton Park/Wertheim partnership, while Eton Park provided 80% 
</p><p>of the investment capital.  Eton Park principals called the 
</p><p>proposed Transener ownership of 50% Werthiem /Eton Park and 
</p><p>50% Pampa Holdings a ""dream team"" that was well received in 
</p><p>informal discussions they held with both Chief of Cabinet 
</p><p>Minister Fernandez and Legal and Technical Secretary Zanini 
</p><p>in late May.  According to Eton Park principals, Fernandez 
</p><p>took the Eton Park proposal to President Kirchner, who then 
</p><p>consulted with Planning Minister De Vido.  De Vido allegedly 
</p><p>told the President that backtracking on the GoA's original 
</p><p>decision would make the President look bad. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p>(C) GoV Pushes ABN to Finance Electro Ingeneria 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶16. (C) The difficulty that an Electro Ingeneria /ENARSA 
</p><p>partnership faced in obtaining private funding for its 
</p><p>proposal to match Eton Park's bid -- or the need to seek 
</p><p>financing from state-owned bank -- was long seen by analysts 
</p><p>and media as the Achilles heel of this group's joint bid. 
</p><p>Eton Park principals said that the Jorge Britto, President of 
</p><p>Banco Macro (a fast growing private Argentine bank close to 
</p><p>the GoA) had told them the some in the GoA were pushing 
</p><p>""allied"" private banks to fund the deal.  Eton Park 
</p><p>principals noted that ABN-AMRO bank had decided to fund a $60 
</p><p>million bridge loan to support the deal and that, according 
</p><p>to ABN loan officers they spoke with, ABN's funding of this 
</p><p>deal was against the bank's better judgment but done at the 
</p><p>behest of Venezuelan President Chavez who made this deal a 
</p><p>quid pro quo for ABN continue to do business with the GoV. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>---------------------- 
</p><p>Eton Park:  Next Steps 
</p><p>---------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶17. (C) Confessing that the saga of their attempt to purchase 
</p><p>a stake in Transener was ""worthy of a cheap novel,"" Eton Park 
</p><p>principals told Ambassador they are not ready to give up. 
</p><p>Still confident that the Appeals court ruling is 
</p><p>fundamentally flawed, Eton Park is considering appealing the 
</p><p>adverse ruling to the Supreme Court.  They admitted that Eton 
</p><p>Park's position was weakened somewhat by the June 29 expiry 
</p><p>of their purchase contract with Petrobras, but noted that 
</p><p>Eton Park has declined to take back its $12 million deposit 
</p><p>from Petrobras to maintain its claim.  Eton Park also noted 
</p><p>the possibility of local media investigative reports on the 
</p><p>transaction coming out soon.  In the current scandal-ridden 
</p><p>political environment, Eton Park suggested, such media 
</p><p>attention could push the GoA to again reverse course. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- 
</p><p>(C) Comment: Corruption and Economic Nationalism 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶18. (C) Minister De Vido's Planning Ministry has increasingly 
</p><p>concentrated control over GoA authorization and funding of 
</p><p>major domestic energy and transportation infrastructure 
</p><p>projects.  The Planning Ministry also controls rapidly 
</p><p>expanding GoA subsidy payments to public service providers in 
</p><p>the energy and transportation sectors.  The 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>less-than-transparent mechanisms used by the GoA to award 
</p><p>infrastructure projects and to distribute subsidy payments, 
</p><p>along with high profile and persistent media attention to a 
</p><p>number of procurement and financing scandals (including the 
</p><p>ongoing Skanka gas pipeline scandal that post has reported on 
</p><p>extensively, Refs B and C), have fed public perceptions that 
</p><p>some senior members of President Kirchner's self-described 
</p><p>""manos limpios"" (clean hands) administration are corrupt. 
</p><p>The rapid rise of Electro Ingeneria as a GoA contractor 
</p><p>during the Kirchner administration and the GoA's dogged 
</p><p>backing of its bid to buy Transener appear to support Eton 
</p><p>Park allegations of Planning Ministry interference.  However, 
</p><p>Embassy stresses that its information of apparent 
</p><p>irregularities is based on hearsay information provided by 
</p><p>Eton Park. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶19. (C) The Eton Park case can also be explained as one of a 
</p><p>growing number of GoA efforts to ensure that strategic 
</p><p>national assets remain in Argentine hands.  Recent examples 
</p><p>include the GoA's state-owned bank financing of a debt 
</p><p>re-financing package for Cotos Supermarket in the face of a 
</p><p>foreign buy-out offer; the Venezuela-financed rescue package 
</p><p>of Argentina's emblematic San Cor Dairy Cooperative in the 
</p><p>face of a U.S. Soros Group buy out proposal; and the GoA's 
</p><p>current support for the local Eskenazi/Peterson group's 
</p><p>efforts to buy a 25% stake in Spanish-owned Argentine energy 
</p><p>giant Repsol-YPF (Ref D). 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶20. (C) Billions in international arbitration claims filed by 
</p><p>foreign multinationals in the wake of Argentina's 2001/2 
</p><p>economic collapse are still outstanding (Refs E and F), an 
</p><p>object lesson for a Kirchner administration that sees foreign 
</p><p>control of key national assets as limiting its ability to 
</p><p>mold national economic policy.  One prominent energy 
</p><p>businessman told us recently that, had Eton Park not tried to 
</p><p>structure its deal as it did and rather prepared initially to 
</p><p>buy a stake in a clearly Argentine-led entity, he deal may 
</p><p>well have proceeded without objections.  He cited other more 
</p><p>successful infusions of foreign capital from multinationals 
</p><p>whose local operations are led by Argentine CEOs.  He said 
</p><p>the current administration clearly wants to rely more on a 
</p><p>""national bourgeoisie"" in strategic sectors like energy 
</p><p>transmission.  Similarly, parliamentarians aligned with 
</p><p>Kirchner's Victory Front have recently introduced legislation 
</p><p>to limit the ability of foreign ""vulture"" investment funds to 
</p><p>invest in Argentine assets.  Kirchner's economic nationalism 
</p><p>seems to play well with his populist support base, which
