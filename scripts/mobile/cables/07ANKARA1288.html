1.(C) Summary: Several leftist Alevi organizations failed to 
agree on an election strategy at a May 19-20 Istanbul 
conference.  Some attendees supported the recently concluded 
center-left alliance, while others insisted it was not nearly 
broad enough to represent their interests.  The conference 
reflected the eclectic nature of Alevis and their increasing 
frustration that no party advances their causes.  Our 
contacts believe that despite this disillusionment, most 
Alevis will stick to tradition and vote for a mainstream 
center-left party such as the Republican People's Party 
(CHP).  Overtures from other parties to run Alevi candidates 
and incorporate some of the issues Alevis support into a 
party platform are unlikely to do much to change the 
equation.  End summary.

Alevis Groups Attempt to Combine Forces, Strengthen Influence 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
2.(C) Several leading Alevi organizations, including the Pir 
Sultan Association, Haci Bektasi Association, and El-i-Beyt 
Foundation, met May 19-20 in Istanbul to formulate a strategy 
for the July 22 parliamentary elections.  Kazim Genc, 
President of the Pir Sultan Alevi Association, told us he 
organized the conference to strengthen the political 
influence of Turkey's large Alevi population.  Until now, 
according to Genc, Alevi influence has been 
disproportionately weak -- Alevis make up approximately 20-25 
percent of Turkey's population.  Genc described Alevis as 
independent-minded and unwilling to tie themselves to a 
specific political party. 
 
3.(C) Genc hoped that he could increase the influence of Pir 
Sultan's 25,000 members by joining with other Alevi groups. 
Alevis are disappointed with the current parties, none of 
which sufficiently address Alevi concerns, according to Genc. 
 The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is, he 
claimed, interested in establishing sharia law and is 
corrupt.  CHP is now alarmingly close to the military and has 
failed to reward Alevis for their support during the 2002 
election.  By combining forces, Alevis could magnify their 
influence on parties' platforms, he explained. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Fractured Groups Unable to Unite 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.(C) Despite high hopes, Alevis were unable to forge 
consensus, and left the conference almost as divided as they 
came.  Attendees told us that prominent Alevi Veliyettin 
Ulusoy led a "moderate leftist" camp that declared it would 
support the CHP-DSP alliance.  The "hardcore leftists," such 
as Genc, rejected the CHP-Democratic Left Party (DSP) 
alliance unless it significantly broadened its tent.  Most 
individuals criticized Alevis who planned to run with AKP or 
the new Democrat Party (DP) -- the result of the Motherland 
Party (ANAVATAN) and True Path Party (DYP) merger. 
 
5.(C) Many participants signed a broad statement released at 
the conference's conclusion, with three main points: 
 
-- No political party had recognized in its platform the 
plight of Alevis. 
 
-- Political Islam, supported by the U.S.'s "moderate Islam 
project," had been trying to take full control of the 
government, as evidenced by AKP's attempts to control the 
Presidency, Speakership, and Prime Ministry.  This political 
Islam promotes racism, backwardness, and sharia. 
 
-- The best solution is a broad alliance of leftist parties, 
unions, and other groups.  The alliance of CHP and DSP is not 
sufficient because it excludes many leftist groups. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Alevi Groups Continue to Weigh Options 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6.(C) Following the conference, most of our Alevi contacts 
remained unwilling to commit to a party and open to 
 
ANKARA 00001288  002 OF 002 
 
 
overtures.  While Genc continued to espouse a broad coalition 
of leftists parties, one of his Vice Presidents said he would 
consider supporting AKP or DP if they agreed to address Alevi 
concerns. 
 
7.(C) Alevi expert Dr. Aykan Erdemir of Middle East Technical 
University (METU) was not surprised by the lack of unity. 
"It is impossible to characterize Alevis as supporting one 
political line -- the community is quite heterogeneous," he 
told us.  Some at the conference largely discouraged the use 
of military intervention to solve Turkey's Kurdish problems 
in the southeast, but others pushed for such intervention. 
Some Alevis practice their religion devoutly, while many are 
purely secular.  Erdemir predicted most Alevis would unite 
around a common fear that AKP is trying to increase the 
influence of Sunni Islam in society by consolidating control 
of government institutions such as the Religious Affairs 
Directorate (Diyanet).  The unifying concern would lead them 
ultimately to vote for a mainstream leftist political party 
such as DP. 
 
8.(C) Comment:  As the conference showed, the Alevis' 
heterogeneity makes it difficult for them to form a cohesive 
bloc in support of one candidate or party.  Several parties, 
including AKP, are courting Alevi voters and seeking Alevis 
to run as candidates.  Center-right parties, however, are 
unlikely to meet their specific, long-standing demands, and 
AKP is clearly anathema to many Alevis.  In the end, most 
Alevis will probably stick to tradition and vote for a 
mainstream center-left party such as CHP.  End comment.
