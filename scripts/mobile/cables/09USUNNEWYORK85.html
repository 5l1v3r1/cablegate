<br></pre></p></div><p> REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  In an introductory call by Ambassador Rice, 
New Zealand PermRep Rosemary Banks lobbied for U.S. support 
for former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark's candidacy 
to become Administrator of the UN Development Program.  Banks 
also urged the U.S. to join the UN Human Rights Council, 
albeit hoping the U.S. would not undermine New Zealand's own 
candidacy for a seat on the body this year.  Ambassador Banks 
spoke in favor of a draft General Assembly resolution on 
climate change and the Security Council sponsored by Pacific 
Island states, and hoped for a "behind the scenes" USG role 
in promoting UN budget reform when the time comes. 
Ambassador Rice summarized her top priorities at the UN, and 
pledged to cooperate closely with her New Zealand 
counterpart.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) CLIMATE CHANGE.  New Zealand PermRep Ambassador 
Rosemary Banks welcomed Ambassador Rice to her mission during 
a February 2 introductory call and solicited the new U.S. top 
objectives for the crowded UN agenda.  Acknowledging that New 
York was not the center of international efforts to address 
climate change, Amb. Rice described her role as trying to 
assist U.S. efforts to smooth the path to a new international 
agreement in Copenhagen in December, pointing out the 
powerful climate change team in place in Washington. 
Ambassador Rice noted that Secretary-General (SYG) Ban had in 
mind a "mini-summit" in the spring to spur momentum in 
international talks, but said the U.S. sought more detail 
before evaluating the offer.  Ambassador Banks acknowledged a 
certain fatigue over high-level UN events that produce little 
more than rhetoric.  Agreeing that climate change and 
development issues intersect, Banks also noted that the 
Pacific Island states were pushing a General Assembly 
resolution linking climate change with the UN Security 
Council.  New Zealand is a co-sponsor of the resolution, but 
Banks realizes that China, Russia and others have deep 
reservations.  She urged Ambassador Rice to hear directly 
from the Pacific states as to what they hope to achieve from 
the resolution. 
 
¶3. (C) UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL. Ambassador Banks appreciated 
the new Administration's priority on nuclear nonproliferation 
and UN peacekeeping operations, which the New Zealander 
agreed were nearly in a state of crisis.  But Banks quickly 
turned the conversation to the UN Human Rights Council and 
the "universal" hope that the U.S. would soon join the 
organization, though without jeopardizing New Zealand's own 
candidacy to fill a Western Europe and Other Group (WEOG) 
seat in 2009 elections for the next term.  Ambassador Rice 
noted that the Administration's decision was pending. 
 
¶4. (C) UNDP SUCCESSION.  Ambassador Banks made a plea for 
U.S. support for former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen 
Clark's candidacy to fill the UN Development Program (UNDP) 
Administrator vacancy.  Banks noted that Clark has received a 
positive response internationally to her candidacy, and that 
there did not appear to be many other serious candidates in 
the race.  Ambassador Rice praised Helen Clark as a strong 
candidate and conveyed that the USG had just put forward a 
short list of highly qualified U.S. candidates for the 
position, each of whom has an impressive background in 
development issues and strong leadership and management 
skills.  The two ambassadors shared notes and rumors as to 
other potential candidates, primarily from African and 
European countries, and pledged to keep in touch regarding 
all candidacies.  Ambassador Banks opined that the SYG's 
January 31 deadline for applicants will not stick, and that 
the ultimate decision could be a long time in coming.  She 
confessed that states seem to place high value on leadership 
skills, which Clark has in abundance, but also highly value a 
background in development issues, for which Clark has less 
experience. 
 
¶5. (C) UN REFORM.  Appreciating Ambassador Rice's busy 
agenda, Ambassador Banks shared her own interest in UN 
management and budget reform, saying she highly values the 
close working relationship that she has had with the U.S. 
Mission regarding UN's 5th Committee issues.  While a mixed 
bag, Banks felt there has been decent, incremental progress 
made in UN reform of late, and wondered if the time is coming 
to take on the controversial issue of reforming the UN's 
budget cycle.  Banks lamented that SYG Ban has not given the 
topic the concentrated and strategic attention it requires, 
but sees some signs that developing states are realizing that 
the UN's current budget cycle system can be run much more 
efficiently.  Noting the danger of too-visible a USG role, 
 
 
Banks hoped the U.S. could play a vital "behind the scenes" 
role should a critical mass of developing states agree to 
meet on the topic.  Ambassador Rice noted that the SYG 
stressed his commitment to UN reform in both her meeting with 
him, and in his conversation with President Obama, but 
offered little in the way of specifics.  Banks said SYG Ban 
tends to only get engaged when things "are a big mess." 
 
¶6. (U) NETWORKING.  Ambassador Banks noted that the informal 
meeting of female PermReps initiated by Madeleine Albright 
continues to meet periodically, and hoped to have a meeting 
soon in which to welcome Ambassador Rice.  Banks said senior 
UN officials are also included, and opined that the group 
could productively meet more often, but currently meet about 
every other month.  Ambassador Rice said she looked forward 
to being involved.
