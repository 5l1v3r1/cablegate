Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)  The FARC had taken over the village of 
Pavarando, leading to the flight of 200 Embera, who are still 
displaced from their homes, Edilberto Dogirama, the President 
of the Council of the Embera Comarca, told EMBOFFs on 
December 19. He said it took over two weeks for the GOP to 
send forces to the village. Dogirama asserted that senior GOP 
officials were most concerned that the Embera stop talking to 
the Embassy and the press. He asserted that a group of 200 
heavily armed FARC from the 58th Front (Note: Subsequent 
information and analysis revealed that these FARC members 
belonged to the 57th Front. End Note) appeared around 
Pavarando on December 14 and were trapped by the mountains 
for up to 10 days before escaping to Jaque. He said 
Panamanian Frontier police finally entered the village after 
the FARC had left. The SENAFRONT officers reportedly left the 
village on December 28. End Summary.

FARC Arrive in Pavarando 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  Edilberto Dogirama, President of the Council of 
the Embera Comarca (the administrative apparatus of the 
Embera semi-autonomous government), told EMBOFFs on December 
19 that armed members of the FARC had taken over the Embera 
village of Pavarando in the Embera Comarca (autonomous 
region) of Sambu, on December 7. He said six self-identified 
members of the FARC, five men and one woman, had entered the 
village and told the inhabitants that they would not hurt 
them, though they could not promise the same for those who 
would come after them. They took control of the one phone in 
the village and began buying food and medical supplies for "a 
large number of men." According to Dogirama, the FARC members 
tried to pay for all the supplies they bought with $100 
bills. As the Embera could not change the money, they "gave" 
them the supplies for free. Dogirama said there had been 
reports of strange movements, supposedly by the FARC, around 
the town since December 1.

Embera Flee

¶3.  (S//NF)  According to Dogirama, the Embera leadership 
alerted the National Frontier Service (SENAFRONT) police, and 
were told that forces would be sent from Manene. SENAFRONT 
police had been sent to Manene after reports that 
"irregulars" had kidnapped several teachers in that town (see 
reftel A).  Dogirama said Embera residents in Pavarando 
reported that SENAFRONT officers subsequently called 
Pavarando on December 9 and spoke with members of the FARC. 
SENAFRONT officers reportedly ordered the FARC to leave the 
town and were told that the FARC would be waiting for them. 
Following the firefight in Manene on December 11, reported in 
reftel, most of the Embera from Pavarando and Boca Guina (the 
next village north of Pavarando on the Sambu river) departed 
the area on December 12. Dogirama said approximately 200 
Embera left the villages without taking any of their 
possessions, eluding the FARC by claiming they were going to 
swim on the river. They then fled in boats to Puerto Indio, 
the Comarcal capital further north on the Sambu river. 
Dogirama reported that UNHCR was helping to feed the 
internally displaced Embera, but had asked that they not go 
public with the fact (Note: Due to the holidays, Post was 
unable to contact UNHCR. We will report on such contact 
septel. End Note) The  people of Pavarando and Boca Guina 
were staying with family members or in empty houses in Puerto 
Indio. The Embera Gran Cacique (Chief) Betanio Chiquidama, 
told POLOFF by phone on December 24 that he would not allow 
the displaced Embera to go home until the situation on the 
ground was totally safe. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
GOP: Don't Tell the Gringos! 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (S//NF)  On December 12 Chiquidama called POLOFF and gave 
a rough report of these events. Other EMBOFFs met with him 
later in the day to get more details of the unfolding events. 
On the evening of December 12, 1st VP and FM Samuel Lewis 
told the Ambassador he was very concerned about recent events 
in the Darien, and requested urgent USG assistance, including 
Night Vision Goggles (NVG) (see reftel B). Dogirama said that 
when the Embera leadership met with Minister of Government 
and Justice Dilio Arcia on December 14 he was upset with them 
for having called the Embassy. Arcia asked the Embera to calm 
their people down and not to go to the media. They asked him 
to establish a permanent SENAFRONT police presence in 
Pavarando. President Martin Torrijos then met privately with 
Chiquidama, Dogirama asserted, and asked the cacique to stop 
calling attention to the matter. Chiquidama told Torrijos 
that he would oblige as long as SENAFRONT police established 
a permanent post in Pavarando, according to Dogirama. 
Finally, Vice Minster of Government and Justice Severino 
Mejia met the Embera leadership on December 16, and promised 
to send SENAFRONT officers to Pavarando. Dogirama said at the 
December 19 meeting that the Embera would meet with MOGJ 
officials on December 22, and that if they did not hear that 
SENAFRONT had established a presence in Pavarando the would 
go to the media on December 23. On December 23 Dogirama told 
POLOFF that the Embera had confirmed the presence of 30 
SENAFRONT police officers in Pavarando, adding that the 
Embera would not go to the media. Dogirama said he had 
received an angry phone call from Major Felipe Cruz (date 
unclear), in charge of intelligence for SENAFRONT police, 
complaining that they had gone to the "gringos," and saying, 
"This is none of their business." Cruz told EMBOFFs on 
December 29, "Don't believe everything the Embera tell you."

58th Front Lost? 
---------------- 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  According to Dogirama, on December 14-15 
approximately 200 heavily armed men with sophisticated 
communications equipment (satellite phones) appeared on the 
outskirts of Pavarando following the confrontation in Manene 
on the December 11. They were camped out about 15 minutes to 
the south of the village. He explained how he had this 
information by saying that there were still nine Embera men 
in the town, and that they were able to occasionally report 
out. He said that as of December 19 there were 20 armed men 
in Pavarando itself. Dogirama asserted that the men were from 
the 58th Front of the FARC, and that they had been driven out 
of Colombia by a Colombian military offensive. (Note: 
Subsequent information and analysis revealed that these FARC 
members belonged to the 57th Front. End Note) As a result, 
they were not familiar with the area and could not find their 
way to the Jaque valley, where the 57th Front has a camp. He 
said they had been overheard discussing coordinates with the 
57th Front in Jaque by sat phone, reporting they had wounded 
and urgently needed to cross the mountains to the South and 
get to the Jaque valley where they could get medical 
attention. According to Dogirama, they are trapped in the 
Sambu valley because they did not know how to get through the 
mountains that Dogirama asserted were extremely treacherous. 
He said the Embera had refused to help them make their way 
over the mountains. On December 18, according to Dogirama a 
seriously wounded man appeared in Pavarando apparently 
wounded during the fighting in Manene on December 11. He said 
there were three other moderately wounded men. Dogirama said 
the Embera believed the woman who first appeared in Pavarando 
had died in the fighting in Manene because she has not been 
seen again. Dogirama told POLOFF on December 24 that the 
armed men had passed through the mountains to Jaque, prior to 
the arrival of 30 SENAFRONT officers to Pavarando Cruz told 
EMBOFFs December 29 that the officers had pulled out of 
Pavarando on December 28, because it was too expensive and 
dangerous to leave them there.

Comment 
 
------- 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  Dogirama's story helps explain many confusing 
aspects of this incident. While Post has no insight into what 
this group was doing in Panama, it now seems clear that small 
groups were sent out to several towns, including Manene and 
Pavarando to acquire supplies for a large group of men, who 
appear not to have been familiar with the area. As a result, 
following the confrontation in Manene, the main body of this 
group made a major mistake of moving west, into the Sambu 
Comarca and valley. There had never been a large scale FARC 
incursion into this area as far as Post knows, and now we 
know why. The area is a trap, with access cut off by 
virtually unpassable mountains. On a map it appears 
tantalizingly close to the headwaters of the Jaque valley, 
where the 57th Front has a base, but in reality it is almost 
impossible to reach there without local help. Once they were 
trapped by SENAFRONT to the East, and the mountains to the 
south and west, a standoff developed. SENAFRONT could not 
send its police officers in to meet what appeared to have 
been a large and well armed force, and the Embera were 
demanding immediate action, bringing the Embassy and the 
media into the mix. Presumably, it was in everyone's 
interests that someone help this group get over the 
mountains, though we have no information on how that finally 
happened. 
 
¶7.  (C)  With the GOP refusing to keep a SENAFRONT garrison 
in Pavarando (see reftel), it remains to be seen how this 
will end. The Embera are insisting that they need a 
detachment there to protect the entire Comarca/valley from 
the FARC and drug traffickers. The Embera are now very happy 
with the Embassy, crediting it with helping to pressure the 
GOP to take action in Pavarando. While the GOP at multiple 
levels was clearly not happy about the "gringos" being 
brought into the middle of this issue, we will take advantage 
of our ties with the Embera to promote our strategy of 
improved governance in the Darien and make our point with the 
GOP that we can only have an effective partnership if we have 
a clear vision of events on the ground. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  The development of this connection, which may now 
prove very valuable, is a product of the excellent teamwork 
between USAID and members of Post's Law Enforcement Support 
Working Group in developing Post's Darien strategy.
