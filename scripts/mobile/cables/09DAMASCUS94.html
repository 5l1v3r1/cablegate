¶1.  (C)  Summary:  In a January 31 meeting with CODEL Smith, 
President Bashar al-Asad expressed hope for better relations 
with the new U.S. administration, called for immediate and 
sustained U.S. engagement in the region, and defended Syria's 
relations with Iran, Hizballah and Hamas.  On Iran, Asad 
disputed assertions that Iran's nuclear program was military 
in nature.  Successfully dealing with Iran would require the 
West to drop its demand that Iran freeze its enrichment 
activities as a condition for further discussions.  Western 
countries could succeed only by recognizing Iran's NPT right 
to pursue a civilian nuclear program and moving the 
politicized issue out of the UN Security Council.  On 
U.S.-Syrian bilateral relations, Asad maintained the Syrian 
people were reacting positively to the new administration; a 
frank bilateral dialogue based on U.S. and Syrian interests 
could help to construct a mechanism for promoting 
cooperation.  Asad argued the region needed U.S. involvement 
to reverse the damaging legacy of the previous 
administration.  Peace with Israel was the only way for Syria 
to achieve prosperity for its people, but Gaza had inflamed 
the region and would pose difficult obstacles to re-starting 
peace discussions. Syria and Israel, he revealed, had been "a 
few words away" from moving to direct peace negotiations 
before Israeli military operations in Gaza had disrupted the 
talks.  FM Muallim responded to CODEL calls for re-opening 
the American School in Damascus and helping the Embassy build 
a new embassy compound by arguing the U.S. first needed to 
ease economic sanctions.  The positive atmospherics of this 
meeting and the subsequent positive local press play suggest 
guarded Syrian optimism.  The lack of any concrete Syrian 
commitments to improve bilateral ties indicates the Syrians 
are still taking measure of Washington's intentions. End

What Does Syria Want from the U.S.? 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) A confident Bashar al-Asad greeted the largest U.S. 
CODEL since Speaker Pelosi's April 2007 trip to Damascus with 
 
DAMASCUS 00000094  002 OF 006 
 
 
expressions of hope for better bilateral relations and a call 
for reinvigorated U.S. engagement in the region.  After 
exchanging greetings with President Asad and introducing 
CODEL members, Congressman Smith said the election of 
President Obama had resulted in a new openness to dialogue 
and created an opportunity to explore new approaches to 
foreign policy.  The CODEL's primary interests and concerns 
were Iran's nuclear program and the war on terrorism.  Which 
issues were most important to Syria? he asked. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Asad responded it was first necessary to begin with 
an assessment of national interests.  The U.S. defined 
priorities in terms of its role as a global power, whereas 
Syria defined its interests as a regional player.  Syria's 
relations with the previous administration had not been good, 
even though both countries shared common interests. 
Washington tended to focus on the "20 percent that divided 
us," rather than the 80 percent of issues upon which there 
were overlapping equities.  While it was normal for there to 
be differences between countries, Syria hoped the new 
administration would recognize and emphasize the 
commonalties.  Syria remained a developing country, and the 
SARG was committed to improving education, standards of 
living, and achieving greater prosperity.  The key to 
achieving these goals was peace with Israel, which continued 
to occupy Syrian land. 
 
¶5.  (C)  The subject of peace required discussion of WMD, 
Asad continued.  The Syrian government agreed that preventing 
the spread of WMD and curbing terrorism were important 
objectives.  Syria had launched a proposal for a WMD-free 
Middle East as a UN Security Council member; the proposal was 
now in the UNSC's inactive "blue file."  Regarding terrorism, 
Asad commented, the U.S. has been fighting it since September 
11, 2001, whereas Syria had been fighting terrorism since the 
1950s.  The point, said Asad, was that discussing objectives 
was not enough.  Both sides needed to expand the dialogue to 
include views on approaching these objectives and identifying 
common ground for cooperation.  Syria's wish-list from the 
U.S. included three items, Asad explained.  These were:  (1) 
No additional U.S. wars in the region; (2) finding a solution 
for Iraq; and (3) active U.S. involvement in promoting 
comprehensive peace. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Asad on Gaza, Hamas, Hizballah, and Peace Talks with Israel 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶6.  (C)  Congressman Smith agreed with Asad that Syrian 
society was largely secular.  Yet, while Syria rejected and 
actively fought al-Qaeda, Syria maintained close relations to 
Hamas and Hizballah, both of which emphasized a 
religious-based state and the use of violence.  "Your 
relations with these groups pose a challenge for us," said 
Congressman Smith. 
 
¶7.  (C)  Asad replied that treatment of these political 
issues first required discussion of their social dimension. 
Hamas and Hizballah were products of their societies, and 
their reliance on extremist ideologies were functions of 
Israeli occupation, the political reality Israeli policies 
had created, and the lack of actions by leaders to oppose 
Israel.  Asad argued, "We don't have Hizballah or Hamas in 
Syria."  Syria could not ignore the political necessity of 
dealing with these actors because of their influence on the 
ground.  He conceded that Syria's embrace of secularism ran 
contrary to the ideological banners of Hamas and Hizballah, 
noting at one point that "Hamas is technically an illegal 
organization" in Syria because of its close association to 
the Muslim Brotherhood.  But, he continued, "not accepting 
these groups' ideologies is not the same as not dealing with 
them." 
 
¶8.  (C)  Asad said he understood the U.S. had a different 
view of Hamas and Hizballah, but Syria defined its relations 
with these groups based on its interests as a regional 
player.  Hizballah was an influential group integrated deeply 
into Lebanese society and politics.  Syria had differences 
 
DAMASCUS 00000094  003 OF 006 
 
 
with Hizballah, but it could not afford to exclude dealing 
with it.  Likewise, Hamas represented important 
constituencies in the Palestinian arena and could not be 
excluded because of ideological differences.  Asad 
distinguished between a regional culture that made it 
impossible to exclude groups because of disagreement over 
worldviews and the U.S. "politics of labeling" groups.  In 
fact, these actors were reacting to Israel's continued 
illegal occupation of Arab land which made resistance 
necessary.  Most Arabs viewed them as organs of resistance 
rather than terrorism, Asad continued. 
 
¶9.  (C)  CODEL members argued U.S. concerns about Iran, 
Hamas, and Hizballah reflected the harm these and other 
actors were doing to regional stability.  Hamas, for example, 
continued to advocate Israel's destruction and had chosen 
violence when other forms of resistance were available 
options.  It was advocacy and use of violence that undermined 
the possibility of regional peace, and this was why the U.S. 
executive and legislative branches viewed these groups with 
deep suspicion and scrutiny. 
 
¶10.  (C)  From Syria's perspective, Asad replied, the goal 
was a region free of militants.  Getting rid of Hamas and 
Hizballah would not achieve this goal, however, since there 
would be 10 groups willing to take their place.  Israeli 
policies of occupation and reliance on violence were the root 
of the problem and were making the situation worse.  Israeli 
violence in Gaza had strengthened the Palestinian desire for 
armed resistance, despite Israeli objectives to the contrary. 
 Moreover, Israeli policies were feeding the spread of 
extremism through the region. 
 
¶11.  (C)  Prior to Israel's late December/early January Gaza 
incursion, the mood in Syria about peace with Israel had been 
positive, reported Asad.  With Turkish assistance, Israel and 
Syria were "a few words away" from achieving an agreement to 
move to direct negotiations.  Hamas had at least implicitly 
acknowledged Israel's existence through Khaled Mesha'al's in 
principle acceptance of a Palestinian state within 1967 
borders.  But Gaza had changed the situation completely, Asad 
observed.  Syria hoped to return to peace talks, but doing so 
would require time. 
 
¶12.  (C)  Congressman Smith replied that Mesha'al could help 
things by making the point more publicly and consistently. 
Other Hamas leaders were still holding onto the goal of 
destroying Israel and this was undermining peace in the 
region.  Of course they were, said Asad, but what else should 
be expected when Israel was conducting military operations in 
Gaza?  CODEL members argued strenuously that Hamas itself 
bore at least some responsibility for provoking Israel 
through continuing rocket attacks.  Asad countered that 
Israel's prolonged blockade of Gaza left Palestinians no 
choice but to fight, prompting CODEL members to assert the 
importance of Special Envoy Mitchell's efforts to revive the 
peace process. 
 
----- 
Iran 
----- 
 
¶13.  (C)  CODEL members argued Syria could play an important, 
positive role in helping to convince Iran to change its 
nuclear policies.  Asad resisted this notion, saying Western 
countries had erred by referring a highly politicized issue 
to the UN Security Council.  Iran had agreed in 2003-2004 to 
allow IAEA monitoring.  But a confrontational U.S. approach 
relying on unsubstantiated reports of "illegal" activities 
led Iran to suspend its cooperation.  Under  current 
circumstances, Iran would not cave to international pressure 
to suspend its enrichment activities as a condition to 
further discussions, since this was a right afforded to it as 
an NPT signatory.  The West needed to understand that Iran 
was pursuing interests as a regional actor.  Those interests 
included securing and defining its borders with Iraq and 
Afghanistan and improving ties in the Arab world, Asad 
offered. 
 
 
DAMASCUS 00000094  004 OF 006 
 
 
¶14.  (C)  At different times throughout the meeting, CODEL 
members stressed the prevailing international view that Iran 
was pursuing nuclear weapons.  There was growing concern that 
Iran would probably cross the threshold within the next 12 
months.  That left the international community a short window 
of opportunity to reverse the situation.  Syria, CODEL 
members stressed, could play a positive role in influencing 
Iranian thinking and averting the need for deploying military 
options to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions. 
 
¶15.  (C) Asad rejected the assumption that Iran's nuclear 
program was military in nature.  IAEA Director General 
Mohammed al-Baradei had publicly stated the IAEA lacked 
sufficient evidence to make this determination.   Moreover, 
continued Asad, Iran would do what it assessed to be in its 
interests;  the use of military power against it would 
succeed only in strengthening Iran's resolve against Western 
demands.  Syria would have little influence on Iranian 
thinking in this regard.  The best advice from Syria to the 
West was to remove the Iranian nuclear file from the UN 
Security Council and treat it as a technical monitoring issue 
in the IAEA.  Iran might then respond positively to such a 
gesture, contended Asad. 
 
¶16.  (C)  CODEL members stressed the urgency of the Iranian 
nuclear issue, noting their strong support for President 
Obama's policy, according to which Iran could not be allowed 
to become a nuclear weapons state.  Israeli officials had 
stated repeatedly they would act to prevent Iran from 
crossing this threshold.  Syria could and should use its good 
relations with Iran to prevent such a scenario, CODEL members 
reiterated.  Asad again rejected the assumption that Iran's 
nuclear ambitions were military in nature.  "We are against a 
military program," he said, arguing Syria shared a common 
objective.  Syria preferred a different, non-politicized 
approach, however.  "You must accept Iran's right to develop 
a civilian nuclear program," the Syrian President stipulated. 
 Iran would not listen to the West or even to Syria unless 
this condition were met.  Moreover, the West needed to 
recognize that Iran had legitimate security interests in the 
region, Asad repeated. 
 
---- 
Iraq 
---- 
 
¶17.  (C)  In response to CODEL inquires about Syria's 
relationship with Iraq,  Asad reaffirmed Syria's interest in 
better relations with its eastern neighbor.  Asad referred to 
his 2007 meeting with Iraqi President Talabani in Damascus 
and said little had improved concretely, despite continuing 
Syrian efforts to engage Baghdad.  The Syrian regime had 
criticized Iraq's Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) because 
the Iraqi government was clearly acting at the behest of the 
United States.  U.S. influence had directed Baghdad away from 
better relations with Syria and had blocked the 
implementation of economic cooperation MOUs despite their 
mutual benefit to both countries.  At present, Syria held a 
negative view of the Iraqi political process because it had 
excluded important voices.  Syria believed U.S. domination 
had prevented a serious reconciliation effort and that Iraq's 
confessionally-based political system was likely to collapse 
due to unmitigated factional rivalries. 
 
¶18.  (C)  On the subject of Iraqi refugees, Asad contrasted 
the 1.5 million Iraqi refugees in Syria with the 500,000 
Palestinians, noting Iraqis had a state to which they could 
return.  He commented the large influx of Iraqis in a short 
two-year period had led to a significant increase in Syria's 
population and was a drain on Syria's economy.  Asad 
complained that Iraq had enjoyed budget surpluses of $40 
billion during each of the previous two years, but Baghdad 
had not contributed any money to educating Iraqi children in 
Syria.  As a political/social issue, however, the Iraqi 
refugees posed several challenges that Syria could not afford 
to ignore.  Iraqi refugees were moving toward narcotics 
trafficking, prostitution, and terrorism.  The SARG had 
focused on opening Syrian schools to Iraqi students in order 
to prevent the loss of an Iraqi generation, he said.  Syrian 
 
DAMASCUS 00000094  005 OF 006 
 
 
officials feared that the next generation of Iraqi youth 
would return to their country unprepared for the challenges 
awaiting them.  They would be "a bomb that would explode 
Iraq" and provide a fertile ground for extremism.   This was 
a problem neither the U.S., nor Syria, nor Iraq could avoid, 
Asad argued. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Improving U.S.-Syrian Bilateral Relations 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶19.  (C)  CODEL members said Syria, and not just the U.S., 
needed to demonstrate a desire for better relations.  They 
argued Syria could take positive steps such as re-opening the 
American School in Damascus and granting permission for the 
U.S. Embassy to build a new compound.  Asad responded that he 
saw the new U.S. administration as a new opportunity.  Syria 
was interested in improving the lives of its people and 
needed U.S. engagement to achieve peace in the region.  The 
U.S. was not a great power because of its military, he added, 
but rather because of its moral authority, economic might, 
and technological sophistication.  The U.S. had failed to 
dominate the region by force alone and now had to confront 
the consequences of previous failed policies.  But Syria 
wanted the U.S. to lead so long as it did so without relying 
exclusively or even principally on military force. 
 
¶20.  (C)  Dialogue remained essential between the U.S. and 
Syria, Asad asserted.  He agreed with CODEL arguments that 
small steps could improve atmospherics, but asked the group 
to understand the depth to which relations had sunk with the 
previous administration.  Asad explained he had faced a 
choice after the October 26 U.S. attack on Abu Kamal that had 
killed eight innocent Syrian civilians.  "I could have closed 
the American school or sent Syrian troops into Iraq to target 
American soldiers," he argued.  Choosing the former option 
had signaled Syria's interest in preserving the possibility 
of better relations with the new administration. 
 
¶21.  (C)  Congressman Smith replied that both sides could 
dwell on past grievances, but this would not yield any 
positive results.  Asad concurred, saying Syria wanted and 
was trying to turn a new page.  He had agreed in principle to 
reopening the American school with former President Jimmy 
Carter in December; the new Administration should signal its 
respect for Syria.  As a practical matter, Asad added, it 
would be difficult to open the school at present because 
students were now studying elsewhere and it would take time 
for the school to make the necessary preparations to resume 
operations. 
 
¶22.  (C)  FM Muallim interjected that Syria's major bilateral 
issues were with the U.S. Congress.  He complained that U.S. 
economic sanctions, particularly the 2003 Syria 
Accountability Act (SAA), prevented U.S. companies from 
selling  medical technology to Syrian hospitals and spare 
parts for commercial aircraft.  In light of these 
restrictions, he asked, "How can you ask us about schools and 
Embassy buildings?"  Congressman Smith argued the U.S. 
Congress had passed the SAA for specific reasons.  "These are 
past us," replied Muallim, arguing that Syrian troops had 
left Lebanon for good.  The U.S. was now focusing on Syria's 
potential contributions for regional stability, answered 
Congressman Smith.  The President had hired key officials, 
such as APNSA Jones, with regional experience and had 
dispatched Senator Mitchell to the region less than a week 
into his term.  Congress also played a role and would look 
into existing legislation concerning Syria, Congressman Smith 
added. 
 
¶22.  (C)  Ending the conversation where it started, Asad and 
CODEL Smith discussed Hamas's role in the current regional 
crisis.  Hamas ideology ran contrary to the pursuit of peace, 
argued CODEL members.  In addition, added one CODEL 
participant, Americans regarded Iranian President Ahmedinejad 
as negatively as Syrians and Iranians appeared to regard 
former President Bush.  Asad responded that Hamas had 
expressed a willingness to live within 1967 borders.  "Why 
 
DAMASCUS 00000094  006 OF 006 
 
 
don't you take this positive development and build on it," he 
argued.  Hamas was incapable of amending its position 
quickly, he added. Regarding the American school, Asad 
suggested "we can look at the SAA and schools together."  For 
Iran, Asad summarized, Syria's approach had the most 
credibility because it was based on mutual trust.  The 
importance was to continue the conversation and to reach 
agreement on the right mechanism to coordinate U.S. and 
Syrian positions, Asad said.  Asad stated he was willing to 
make positive statements about future U.S.-Syrian relations 
and hoped there would be similar remarks coming out of 
Washington. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶23.  (C)  Asad was cautiously optimistic about, and seemed 
genuinely open to improved bilateral relations.  Local 
post-CODEL press play was generally upbeat and positive.  The 
SARG's unwillingness to avoid any concrete commitments at 
this stage suggests Asad is still taking measure of the new 
U.S. administration, a process that is likely to continue for 
some time.  Asad's reliance on international relations jargon 
in defense of Syria's relationships with Iran, Hamas, and 
Hizballah reflected some refinement of his talking points, 
but the Syrian President's positions indicated no increased 
understanding of USG priorities and decisionmaking.  FM 
Muallim's efforts to transform Asad's in principle agreement 
with President Carter to reopen the American School into an 
issue linked to the easing of U.S. economic sanctions 
demonstrates Syrian guile at its best and worst.  Changing 
the terms of the deal is a common feature of doing business 
in the souks of Syria.  The President's office is no 
exception. 
 
¶24.  (SBU)  CODEL Smith did not have an opportunity to clear 
on this cable.
