</p><p></p><p>------- 
Summary 
------- 
</p><p>¶1. (C)  Colombia's new military high command contains a 
potentially promising line-up of leaders but they are off to 
a rocky start.  The new COLMIL Commander's lack of tactical 
experience has undermined his credibility with service chiefs 
and opened the way for the Army Commander to usurp his 
authority over joint commands.  This in turn could complicate 
the Plan Patriota campaign.  End Summary. 
</p><p>-------------------------- 
Overview: New Appointments 
-------------------------- 
</p><p>¶2. (U)  In mid-August the GOC and COLMIL ushered in new 
leadership to the military high command.  Incoming Defense 
Minister Juan Manuel Santos tapped General Freddy Padilla as 
Armed Forces Commander.  Santos named the service chiefs as 
follows: General Mario Montoya remains as Army Commander; 
Vice Admiral Guillermo Enrique Barrera assumes the Navy 
command; General Jorge Ballesteros takes charge of the Air 
Force; and General Jorge Daniel Castro remains as Police 
director.  In mid-September, the COLMIL announced the 
transfer of Joint Task Force Omega commander General Gilberto 
Rocha to an unspecified position, along with the accelerated 
field deployment of 58 new officers to alleviate acute COLAR 
command shortages. 
</p><p>------------------------------------------ 
Santos: Civ/Mil Relations and Public Image 
------------------------------------------ 
</p><p>¶3. (C)  The appointment of Juan Manuel Santos as Minister of 
Defense may bode well for COLMIL relations with the 
government and the Colombian public.  As founder of the U 
party and a cousin of the Vice President, Santos is well 
connected to President Uribe.  This may allow him greater 
ministerial autonomy, buffering Uribe's tendency to 
micro-manage field commanders, a regular source of past 
friction.  Santos is believed to aspire to the presidency in 
2010 and may be more results oriented and press-seeking than 
his more reclusive predecessor.  However, Santos' personal 
ambition also risks provoking resentment within the military 
and/or resistance from political rivals. 
</p><p>------------------------ 
Padilla: Early Stumbling 
------------------------ 
</p><p>¶4. (C)  Like Santos, new Armed Forces Commander GEN Padilla 
is a political operator.  However, his tactical command has 
been limited to engineering and intelligence brigades. 
Padilla has served mainly in staff officer roles, including 
as Joint Staff Chief, and is the Army's highest-ranking 
officer.  Padilla is seen as a politician and planner likely 
to focus on strategic joint staff issues like budgeting, 
personnel, and doctrinal reform while leaving operations to 
the field command.  Still, that formula does not appear to be 
working for Padilla so far.  In a recent meeting with Santos 
and his service chiefs, his operational inexperience led 
Padilla to make foolish remarks, denting his credibility.
The Defense Minister later rejected every one of Padilla's 
recommendations. 
</p><p>---------------------- 
COLAR Command Tensions 
---------------------- 
</p><p>¶5. (C)  Santos reportedly strongly dislikes Army Commander 
GEN Montoya.  Padilla and Montoya are opposites in 
personality.  Padilla is reflective and intellectual, while 
Montoya is brusque and aggressive.  Their skills could be 
complementary, with Padilla focused on institutional 
priorities while allowing Montoya to run his command.  In 
practice, however, Montoya appears to be usurping Padilla's 
authority and assuming joint command functions, something he 
was unable to do under former Armed Forces Commander GEN 
Ospina, due to the latter's field expertise.  Montoya has few 
friends among his fellow service chiefs, and his behavior 
could cause rifts.  While Padilla is likely to retain Plan 
Patriota's focus on high value targets (HVTs) and support 
Joint Task Force Omega, Montoya is a more conventional combat 
officer who may seek to undermine special operations. 
</p><p>------------------------------ 
Rocha: Annointed or Sidelined? 
------------------------------ 
</p><p>¶6. (C)  In mid-September, the COLMIL announced additional 
promotions related to Joint Task Force Omega (JTF-O) which 
may signal a cascade of changes in 2007.  Current commander 
General Gilberto Rocha will be transferred in December to an 
unspecified position, handing over his command to his former 
FUDRA (rapid response unit) commander GEN Navas, who in turn 
will be replaced by new war college grad COL (promotable to 
GEN) Leyseca.  Rocha's availability might confirm rumors that 
the COLAR's current Padilla-Montoya partnership may be of 
limited duration.
