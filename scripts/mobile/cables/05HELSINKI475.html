¶1. (C) On April 22 we met with Jarno Syrjala, Finnish MFA's 
new European Correspondent, to review the agenda for the 
April GAERC meeting (Reftel).  Finnish views follow, by 
subject.  See below for bio information on Syrjala, who has 
just taken over this position. 
 
¶2. (C) Iraq: Syrjala said he expected the conclusions on Iraq 
to be "routine"; the GoF believes a more consequential 
discussion will take place in the May GAERC. 
 
¶3. (C) Middle East Peace Process: Syrjala predicted that the 
Ministers' statement will welcome the appointment of James 
Wolfensohn as Special Envoy for Gaza Disengagement.  He 
expressed some concern over the latest developments in 
Israeli settlement policy, particularly the construction of 
new West Bank housing units.  The Finns assume that the 
announcement of this construction was withheld until after PM 
Sharon's latest meeting with the President so that it would 
not spark contention at the meeting; they also assume the new 
construction decision is dictated by Sharon's domestic 
political need to "balance" the Gaza withdrawal.  But during 
FM Tuomioja's recent visit to the region, accompanied by 
Syrjala, the Finns "got a strong feeling from the 
Palestinians, and also some unofficial Israelis" that they 
fear an "Intifada III" -- one that focuses on the West Bank 
and Jerusalem in particular -- could be sparked by GoI 
settlement action. 
 
¶4. (C) Lebanon: Syrjala said it would be ideal for the 
elections to happen before the end of May, and the Finns are 
encouraging the Lebanese to hold to the schedule.  That 
doesn't leave much time, however, and he felt that a "brief 
delay shouldn't bother the U.S. or the EU."  He said the GoF 
has had some contact with the Lebanese government regarding 
election monitors, which the Finns are ready to provide upon 
Lebanon's request. 
 
¶5. (C) Sudan: The Finns expect that the Ministerial 
discussion will be a largely technical one, concentrating on 
the details of sanctions implementation.  In a separate 
conversation April 21, MFA Director General for Africa and 
the Middle East Aapo Polho told us the GoF is very pleased 
with the results of the Oslo meeting, especially the extent 
of aid pledged.  Polho said Oslo has demonstrated that the 
international community is able to take action on Darfur 
without losing sight of what has been achieved in bringing 
peace to the north-south conflict. 
 
¶6. (C) Zimbabwe: Regarding the election, Syrjala said that 
"our opinion is perhaps not so strongly worded as yours," but 
the GoF certainly agrees with the USG assessment of the 
status of democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe.  He 
believes Ministers will conclude that there is no 
justification for changing EU policy with regard to Zimbabwe. 
 Certainly the Finns do not support expanding contacts with 
Mugabe. 
 
¶7. (C) Great Lakes: It seems that the U.S. and EU are in 
close agreement, said Syrjala.  The Ministers are likely to 
report some very general conclusions, calling on the 
international community to remain united in pursuit of free 
elections, disarmament of rebels, and reform of the security 
sector. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Tsunami follow-up: Syrjala said the Ministers will 
review several documents -- two from the Commission and one 
from Solana -- regarding the Indian Ocean tragedy and lessons 
learned regarding civil crisis management.  The GoF believes 
the documents and discussion would remain just as valuable if 
the word "tsunami" were dropped, since the issue is how to 
prepare different sectors and ministries to cooperate to meet 
a civil crisis of any kind. 
 
¶9. (C) EU/Russia: The Ministers will review preparations for 
the upcoming summit.  As to substance, there are two issues 
that particularly matter to the Finns: 
 
-- Russia is collecting "quite substantial" fees from 
commercial airlines that overfly Siberia en route to Asia. 
Shifting to a southern route, however, would cost even more, 
so the GoF is hoping for united EU pressure on the Russians 
to reduce the fees. 
 
-- The Finns also are anxious to see a visa facilitation 
agreement signed between the EU and Russia.  Current Russian 
visa policy can vary from EU member to member, and is a 
function of the bilateral relationship with each country. 
 
Bio Note 
-------- 
¶10. (C) A number of Department bureaus will be familiar with 
Jarno Syrjala, who was Political Counselor at the Finnish 
Embassy in Washington 2000-2003.  Two years ago he returned 
to Helsinki to be the MFA's "Regional Manager" for Israel, 
the PA, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Middle East Peace 
Process.  It seemed to us at the time that in career terms 
this position was basically a lateral move.  With his new 
job, he seems to have resumed his rise through the MFA ranks. 
 Syrjala tells us he did not bid on the job when it came 
open, but was asked to take it by "the Political Department 
and the Minister's staff" -- which we interpret as meaning FM 
Tuomioja and Political Director Pilvi-Sisko 
Vierros-Villeneuve. 
 
¶11. (C) Syrjala has been an excellent contact and a close 
friend of the United States, although he has not always 
agreed with us -- especially on Middle East policy, his 
strong support for the road map notwithstanding.  Before his 
Washington tour, Syrjala was GoF representative to the 
Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, operating out of East 
Jerusalem.  In his new position he is likely to retain his 
passionate interest in the Peace Process.  In informing us of 
Syrjala's new appointment, Vierros-Villeneuve said that it 
was done with Finland's upcoming (July-December 2006) EU 
presidency very much in mind.  Syrjala is well aware of the 
significance of that.  The Finns see these presidencies as a 
rare opportunity for the small EU nations to make a 
difference, and want to make the most of the opportunity. 
Moreover, if the Constitution Treaty takes effect in November 
2006 as scheduled (admittedly a big "if"), Finland will 
preside over the European Union's shift to its new structure. 
 And finally, there is a growing sense in the GoF that the 
Finns may inherit several major unresolved issues.  Syrjala 
told us that for FSOs of his generation, this EU presidency 
could be the pivotal event of their careers.
