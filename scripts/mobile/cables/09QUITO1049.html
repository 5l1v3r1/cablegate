SUBJECT: Ecuadorian Navy Proposes Info-Sharing Agreement 
 
REF: HOTR IIR 6 828 0059 10; QUITO 883 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Heather M. Hodges, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(A), (B), 
(C), (D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  Navy Commander Admiral Molestina approached the 
Embassy on September 1 to propose formalizing information sharing 
between the Ecuadorian Navy and USG.  While Molestina's motivation 
for signing such an agreement may include protecting his own 
position and his personnel, other contacts within the Ecuadorian 
Navy claim that the timing is good to formalize intelligence 
cooperation.  Such an agreement should be limited in scope 
initially, but allow for future expansion.  The Embassy supports 
this initiative as a counter to increasing resistance by the 
Ecuadorian military to engage with the USG.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
Navy Suggests Information Sharing Agreement 
 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) Navy Commander Admiral Aland Molestina asked the 
Embassy's Naval Attache on September 1 to initiate a request to 
formalize information sharing between the Ecuadorian Navy and USG 
(Ref B), to focus on maritime interdiction.  The Defense Attache 
Office in Quito has worked with counterparts in the U.S. 
intelligence community and USSOUTHCOM to confirm the viability of 
such cooperation, with positive feedback to date. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (C) Admiral Molestina explained that his motives for this 
request were to ensure continued cooperation after potential 
changes in military leadership in the next few months and to 
protect personnel from unwanted political and judicial prosecution. 
Molestina, who is also a candidate to become the next Chief of 
Defense, may want to ensure that any intelligence relationship with 
the USG is fully disclosed.  Molestina has already raised the idea 
with Minister of Defense Javier Ponce (Ref A). 
 
 
 
¶4.  (C) The USG signed two special unit information sharing 
agreements with the Ecuadorian National Police in July 2009.  The 
Ecuadorian Navy has cited these agreements as a model for an 
information sharing agreement between the two navies.  According to 
Ecuadorian Navy contacts, the current Ecuadorian political climate 
is right to forge and receive approval for such an agreement. 
 
 
 
Initially Limited But Open to Future Expansion 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
 
¶5.  (C) Any information sharing agreement between the U.S. and 
Ecuadorian navies that would most likely be limited in scope -- 
defining the Ecuadorian Navy's role in support of U.S. efforts to 
combat illicit activities in and around Ecuadorian maritime and 
territorial domains.  However, any such agreement should permit 
multiple USG agencies to work at multiple levels with the 
Ecuadorian Navy and associated agencies as necessary.  In addition, 
such an agreement should allow for future expansion to other 
agencies or activities, following interagency coordination and 
concurrence. 
 
¶6.  (S/NF) The Embassy supports establishing an information sharing 
agreement between the U.S. and Ecuadorian navies.  The Ecuadorian 
Navy is currently the main player in interdiction and we need to 
maintain cooperation.  Signing an agreement would also mark a 
departure from an increasingly negative trend in Ecuador to limit 
military-to-military relations (Ref B).
