¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  On July 11, after a week of 
back-and-forthing between San Jose, Washington and New York, 
the MFA confirmed support of the U.S. draft UNSC Zimbabwe 
sanctions resolution.  However, the MFA said that PermRep 
Urbina would offer an explanation for the vote -- presumably 
to signal the GOCR's disappointment in not having all its 
desired language included.  We believe this reflects the 
strong GOCR interest in making a mark on the UNSC, especially 
on human rights- or democracy-related issues, which Costa 
Rica views as areas of expertise.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) For the record, on July 9, we delivered talking 
points on the US Zimbabwe sanctions resolution, per Ref A, 
to Antonio Alarcon, Chief of Staff to FonMin Stagno; Adriana 
Murillo, MFA UNSC Team Leader; and Juan Salas, UNSC 
Desk Officer.  We reported delivery of the demarche on July 9 
in Ref B.  Last week's phone call by AS Shannon to FonMin 
Stagno evidently helped keep the MFA energized on this issue, 
although Stagno was inclined to take a strong stance anyway. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Also on July 9, Alarcon told DCM that the GOCR was 
supportive of the resolution, and Alarcon did not discount 
the GOCR's UN Mission finally signing on the resolution as 
is.  However, he said that Costa Rica would continue to push 
to add language concerning democracy and free elections (see 
below), which the MFA believed made the resolution 
stronger. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The MFA provided us its recommended changes later on 
July 9, which we forwarded by separate email on the OpenNet 
(Ref C).  Please find the unofficial translation of pertinent 
text of the GOCR's introduction and the text of 
the GOCR's desired changes, as of the afternoon of July 9, 
below.  Murillo specifically requested clarification on the 
time line for the resolution (which we understand may have 
been voted on today, July 11.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) Begin unofficial translation of MFA rationale for 
changes and English-provided text of the requested changes: 
 
Costa Rica considers free and fair elections a central 
element in the promotion and protection of Human Rights and 
the State of Law. 
 
States have the responsibility to assure necessary measures 
to facilitate effective participation in their electoral 
processes. 
 
The situation in Zimbabwe, since last March, the disrespect 
of the will of its people, the political violence, the 
murders, torture, generalized aggressions and detentions of 
presumed opposition-party members, obliges the Security 
Council to respond and act accordingly. 
 
Costa Rica: 
 --Welcomes the draft resolution presented and considers it a 
positive step for Council action. 
 --Welcomes with special approval the inclusion of language 
regarding the necessity to establish responsibilities in 
relation to human rights abuses and to establish justice. 
 --Signals as especially important that the parameters for 
establishing sanctions are clearly defined. 
 --Considers that this is a grand opportunity for democracies 
and that the triggering elements for Security Council 
intervention should be adequately framed and clearly 
established. 
 
In this sense, Costa Rica proposes to make reference to the 
beginning of periodic and genuine elections in the 
Universal Declaration, according to the following language: 
 
PP 4 bis 
Recalling relevant General Assembly resolutions with regards 
to enhancing the effectiveness of the principle of  periodic 
and genuine elections, including resolutions 45/150 and 
62/150). 
 
PP 14.1.bis 
Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted 
on 10 December 1948, in particular the principle that the 
 
SAN JOSE 00000594  002 OF 002 
 
 
will of the people, as expressed through periodic and genuine 
elections, shall be the basis of government authority, as 
well as the right freely to choose representatives through 
periodic and genuine elections, which shall be by universal 
and equal suffrage and held by secret vote or by equivalent 
free voting procedures (62/150). 
 
PP 14.2.bis 
Stressing its conviction that periodic and genuine elections 
are a necessary and indispensable element of sustained 
efforts to protect the rights and interests of the governed 
and that, as a matter of practical experience, the right of 
everyone to take part in the government of his or her country 
is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment by all of a 
wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
embracing political, economic, social and cultural rights 
(45/150). 
 
The proposed language is the language accorded by General 
Assembly resolutions A/RES/45/150, approved with 129 in 
favor, 8 opposed and 9 abstentions, and A/RES/62/150, 
approved with 182 in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions. 
 
END TEXT of MFA communication. 
 
¶6. (SBU) On July 11, we delivered Ref E to Adriana Murillo, 
MFA UNSC Team Leader who was handling the Zimbabwe issue. 
She reiterated that Costa Rica would vote in favor of our 
resolution because they considered the situation in Zimbabwe 
unacceptable. However, the GOCR felt "obliged to give an 
explanation of vote." (Based on her reply, we assume that 
their statement will have to do with all their desired 
language not being included.) 
 
¶7. (C) COMMENT:  We understand that energetic USUN lobbying 
evidently resolved the language issue late on July 9.  We 
also understand that the proposed Costa Rican changes 
actually went deeper into preambular and operative language 
than we were led to believe by our interlocutors here (who 
may not have had the absolute latest information when we 
contacted them).  Given the fluid and fast-moving nature of 
these discussions in New York, and the likelihood that 
there will be similar situations in the future, we appreciate 
any Costa Rica-specific details or "color" that USUN or 
IO/UNP can provide (by email or phone) to better equip us to 
help in cases like this.  When it is feasible to get Costa 
Rica's input and buy-in during the drafting process of 
(especially human rights- or democracy-related) resolutions, 
Costa Rican cooperation may increase.  Like the earlier 
Prisoners of Conscience Declaration (Ref F), the Zimbabwe 
resolution seems to reflect the strong GOCR interest in 
making a mark on the UNSC, especially on human rights- or 
democracy-related issues, which Costa Rica views as areas of 
expertise.  We expect that the GOCR will continue to insist 
that its views be given more weight in these areas.
