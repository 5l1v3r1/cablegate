1.4(B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C)   SUMMARY.  In the run-up to the general elections in 
Ecuador on April 26, 2009, Participacion Ciudadana (PC) has 
prepared 8400 youth volunteers to serve as election 
observers.  In Guayas province, 1452 volunteer observers and 
supervisors have been trained and equipped to assist the 
organization's 30-person technical staff in monitoring the 
general elections that will select candidates for 5,964 
positions, including Ecuador's President, Vice President, and 
members of both the National and Provincial Assemblies.  In 
conversations with mission officers in Quito and Guayaquil, 
PC officials were largely optimistic that these elections 
would be free and fair.  However, our contacts reiterated 
concerns about campaign finance violations on the part of the 
Correa government (reftel), and the blurring of lines between 
Correa the President and Correa the Candidate.  PC is also 
concerned about  unpublicized last-minute changes to the vote 
counting process that would give newly created intermediary 
electoral tribunals more authority on vote counting and reduce 
control of ballots and tally sheets.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  ConGen officers met with Participacion Ciudadana 
Technical Advisor, Ana Fajardo, on April 20, 2009, to discuss 
the organization's plans to observe the upcoming general 
elections.  At the national level, Participacion Ciudadana 
has recruited 8400 youth volunteers; most of whom are between 
18-25 years old.  Nationally, Participacion Ciudadana's 
30-member technical staff has led efforts to recruit, train, 
and equip volunteer observers.  Initial training and 
information sessions in Quito with the organization's team 
provided regional and provincial team leaders with the 
knowledge and resources to engage local youth in their 
respective electoral districts.  From there, each provincial 
team leader hosted information sessions, recruited 
volunteers, organized an election-day simulation, and 
conducted pre-election training days before the vote. 
 
¶3.  (C) Although Participacion Ciudadana's staff does not 
expect serious deficiencies in Ecuador's electoral process, 
they did express some concern about the role of the newly 
created intermediary juntas, which are tasked with reviewing 
tally sheets from each precinct.  PC Guayaquil told us that 
the intermediary juntas would have the authority to annul the 
results of the tally sheets.  However in an April 23 meeting, 
Participacion Ciudadana contacts in Quito contradicted this 
assessment and explained that the role of the intermediary 
juntas would be to review the tally sheets and decide which 
ones were not valid.  Only the next step up the chain, the 
provincial juntas, would be empowered to make the final 
decision after evaluating each tally sheet recommended for 
annulment.  With only two days before the election, formal 
rules establishing the role and scope of authority of these 
intermediary juntas had not yet been released. 
 
¶4.  (C)  PC contacts are also concerned about  a last-minute 
change in the chain of custody of election materials.  Unlike 
past elections, the tally sheets will be separated from their 
respective ballot boxes and passed directly to precinct 
coordinators.  In the past, these tally sheets would have 
traveled with the sealed ballot boxes to the provincial 
juntas under military escort.  By separating these tally 
sheets from the ballots, the electoral council has created a 
potential vulnerability in the electoral process.  Further 
cause for concern is the fact that this change was made at 
the last minute, and has not been announced to the public. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Since its establishment in 2002, USAID partner 
organization Participacion Ciudadana has led domestic 
election observation and campaign monitoring efforts.  On 
Election Day, Participacion Ciudadana will have a noticeable 
presence.  Observers will provide information to the call 
center independently at three times during the day, at poll 
opening (6:30 a.m.), mid-day, and poll closing (5:00 p.m.). 
Instead of relying on exit poll data, Participacion Ciudadana 
will conduct its own quick-count at 8,000 randomly sampled 
precincts, and report this information to Quito.  In case of 
technical difficulties or other problems reporting to the 
call center, observers can log-on online to provide their 
status reports and complete the end of day quick-count. 
 
¶6. (C) The role of the respected and autonomous observer 
Participacion Ciudandan will be of particular importance in 
these elections. Ecuador's new Electoral Council (CNE) has 
yet to prove itself as a neutral body.  It has not 
consistently spoken out against questionable practices by the 
government in circumventing strict campaign spending limits. 
It has not commented on government-controlled media's 
electoral coverage that has devoted considerably more air 
 
time to government candidates.  It made a serious error in 
leaving out three major political parties in a sample ballot 
published in Guayaquil on Sunday (reftel).  The introduction 
of intermediary juntas may indeed speed delivery and counting 
of ballots, but it introduces a level of uncertainty into the 
process, and the CNE's failure to clearly communicate the 
roles and procedures of the juntas is cause for concern.
