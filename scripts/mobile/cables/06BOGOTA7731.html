trillion cubic feet find of methane gas at their coal 
facility in La Loma, Cesar and at another block in La 
Guajira.  The deposits increase by more than one-third 
Colombia's total reserves, presently estimated at 4.7 
trillion cubic feet. The President of Drummond Colombia, 
Augusto Jimenez, told econoffs the company would like to sell 
some 80 percent of the gas, the remainder to be utilized in 
support of their coal operations.  Drummond plans to make a 
USD 1.3 billion investment to exploit the gas over the next 3 
years. 
</p><p>¶2. (C) Drummond estimates that 70 percent of the find is 
contained at its coal facility in La Loma, the remainder at 
theSutterhome facility in La Guajira, a 70/30 joint venture 
with state oil company Ecopetrol.  Although Drummond 
Corporation has never commercially exploited a gas deposit, 
Jimenez indicated that the company intends to do so on its 
own without outside partners.  Drummond currently employs 
3500 at its coal mining facilities, and 6500 throughout 
Colombia, including Bogota headquarters and part-time 
contractors at its port facility in Santa Marta.  Company 
officials claim that an additional 4000 jobs will be created 
through investment in the exploitation of the gas. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) It is unclear at this stage how the surplus gas will 
be utilized.  Newly installed Minister of Energy and Mines 
Hernan Martinez told the Ambassador in his introductory 
meeting on August 22 that a domestic electrical energy crisis 
was brewing, and that increased generation from thermal 
sources would be required.  The GOC may decide to utilize the 
gas to supply electricity to major nearby population centers 
of Barranquilla and Cartagena.  Colombia has no present LNG 
facility, complicating efforts to export the gas.  Although 
Jimenez told econoffs that Drummond was exploring exportation 
to Venezuela viathe La Guijira-Maracaibo pipeline presently
under construction (reftel), post regards this possibility as 
remote.  Jimenez added that should Colombia successfully find 
offshore deposits, a pipeline to Panama and Central America 
might become economically feasible. 
</p><p>4, (C) Drummond's exuberance over the gas has not been shared 
by the GOC since the company made public its finding without 
any prior notice or data sharing with the GOC. Minister 
Martinez -- a former coal executive with Exxon -- was clearly 
annoyed that Drummond has presented no data in public or 
private to back up its claim of "proven reserves".  Until 
such data is presented and verified by an independent third 
party, the GOC cannot legally certify the wells.
