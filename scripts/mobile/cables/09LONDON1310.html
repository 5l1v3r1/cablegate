HMT promised to do so, coordinating with FCO and UK Revenue and Customs, and appreciated the information as they are currently exploring the specifics of sanctioning IRISL using their Counter Terrorism Act (CT Act) powers. HMG is following up on its CT Act powers, looking to prohibit UK companies, including Iranian-owned subsidiaries, from doing business with IRISL and Bank Mellat Tehran. This is aimed at the P&I clubs and to stop Mellat London from transacting with its parent in Iran. The CT Act allows them to prohibit UK companies and sectors from doing business with specially designated entities or sectors if seen as a threat to the UK or if declared a problem under the guise of multilateral organizations such as the Financial Assets Task Force (FATF).
</p><p>2.(S/NF) HMT told us technical and legal interpretations remain to be worked out as the UK wants to get this absolutely correct. In mid-May we were told HMG would announce in early June that UK companies could engage in "no business with IRISL and Melli Tehran", giving UK companies 30-60 days to wind down existing business, cancel contracts, etc. HMT has backed off that timetable, and does not have a prediction of when these issues will be cleared up.
</p><p>3.(S) HMT Asset Freezing officials will soon request via Embassy London additional information on IRISL and its related companies and partners.</p>
