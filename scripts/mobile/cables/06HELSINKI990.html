¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The Oct. 2-3 informal EU defense 
ministers' meeting will focus on operations in Bosnia, Sudan, 
and Congo; review the EU's force catalogue and the state of 
civil-military coordination; and discuss the European Defense 
Agency's (EDA) long term planning scenarios.  NATO SYG de 
Hoop Scheffer and UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari will 
brief on EU-NATO cooperation and the Kosovo status talks, 
respectively.  The final session will be devoted to European 
(but non-ESDP) military support to UNIFIL in Lebanon.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Emboffs and DATT called on Finnish MFA Counselor for 
EU and ESDP Issues Mikko Kinnunen and Defense Ministry Policy 
Director Pauli Jarvenpaa on September 25 to obtain a preview 
of the EU's informal defense ministerial meeting to be held 
Oct. 2-3 in Levi, Finland. 
 
Bosnia 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The informal defense ministerial will open Oct. 2 
with a session on current ESDP operations in Bosnia, Sudan 
and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In Bosnia ministers 
will aim at coordinating a drawdown expected to begin shortly 
after the October elections. The EU acknowledges Althea to be 
an overstaffed mission, although there is still some 
disagreement among member states regarding the best "shape 
and size," as well as how quickly the drawdown should occur, 
Kinnunen said. (Britain and Netherlands favor reductions 
while Germany is more cautious.)  The Finns aim for a 
coordinated, planned reshaping and hope to avoid a string of 
unilateral reductions.  Finland would see its forces in 
Bosnia drop by 70 to about 100 on January 1 when they turn 
control of a Finnish-manned command and control center in 
Tuzla over to the Greeks. 
 
Sudan, Congo 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ministers will also consider the future of the AMIS 
mission in Sudan which, while not technically an ESDP 
mission, has been largely funded by the EU.  Tentative plans 
call for ad hoc British and Dutch financial support to float 
the mission during November and December, after EU funding 
runs out in October. The AU has agreed to add 4000 troops to 
the 7000 already on the ground, but funding the mission for 
early 2007 -- until the operation is hopefully turned over to 
the UN -- will be a central concern, according to Kinnunen. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The EU will evaluate the ESDP mission in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, slated to end four months after 
the first round of elections (Nov. 29).  Kinnunen noted that 
an extension of a couple of weeks would not be problematic. 
However Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands, in particular, 
are under pressue to wrap the current mission up promptly 
because the Dutch and German troops, as well as the Potsdam 
control center, are slated to serve the German-Dutch-Finnish 
EU Battle Group that goes on call on January 1. 
 
Capabilities and Civ-Mil 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ministers will likely approve the EU's 2006 Force 
Catalogue for adoption by the European Council in November or 
December. Jarvenpaa explained that the catalogue creates a 
standardized list of capabilities volunteered by EU member 
states for use in EU missions.  The catalogue will allow a 
comparison of the forces available with the forces needed in 
order to carry out desired EU operations, with the hope that 
EU members would step forward to fill any gaps revealed in 
the comparison. On civil-military relations, Finland has 
worked with the EU's situation center to develop 
recommendations for information and, to a more limited 
extent, intelligence sharing among civil and military units 
in an operational area.  Ministers will discuss the 
recommendations with an eye to having the Council adopt them 
in November. The board of the European Defense Agency -- 
which includes the ministers-- will meet on October 3 to 
discuss the EDA's analysis of the threat scenario 20-25 years 
hence and the crisis management tools that will be needed to 
address those threats. The EDA is also expected to approve 
the financing plan and priorities list for the next 3 years. 
 
EU-NATO Cooperation 
 
¶7. (C) The Finns hope to underscore the importance of EU-NATO 
cooperation throughout the meeting.  Jarvenpaa was visibly 
pleased that NATO SYG de Hoop Scheffer would be attending the 
first part of the ministerial and hoped that the Levi meeting 
would set a precendent for NATO SYG participation.  Kinnunen 
 
noted that Germany planned to make EU-NATO relations even 
more visible during its presidency and hoped that problems 
with individual countries such as Turkey and Cyprus would not 
impede this. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Kosovo and Lebanon will also be on the agenda, with 
ministers examining the future prospects for rule of law and 
police training missions.  An EU planning team was already 
preparing a future civilian crisis management operation in 
Kosovo, and the Council and Commission are considering the 
appropriateness of such a mission in  to bolster the Lebanese 
government's administrative capabilities.
