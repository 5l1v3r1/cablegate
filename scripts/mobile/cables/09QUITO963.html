¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  President Rafael Correa's visits to the UK and 
Russia on October 26-30 have elicited media carping on the large 
delegation, Correa's statement about considering recognition of 
Ossetia and Abkhazia, and what were seen as meager outcomes. 
Correa's backers and the MFA defended the seven agreements signed 
with Russia as the beginning of a new strategic relationship for 
Ecuador.  An MFA official told us that although the possibility of 
Ecuador's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia was played up 
in the press, Correa made no commitments to the Russian government. 
End Summary. 
 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
Big Trip, Big Cost - Correa on the Defensive 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ecuadorian press has covered President Correa's 
October 26-30 trip to England and Russia heavily, with numerous 
conflicting reports on who participated in the trips and what was 
accomplished for Ecuador.  The Embassy followed up with the MFA 
Director General of European Affairs Pablo Villagomez on November 
12 to get his take on the trip's outcome. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The cost of the President's foreign travel, during a 
period of economic challenges for Ecuador, was a major complaint of 
Correa's critics.  Press reports that the GOE's cost for the 
President and more than 40 other officials totaled approximately 
$108,000.  A request for a list of the officials traveling from 
each ministry was denied by the Presidency.  Correa defended the 
large delegation to Russia during his November 7 radio and TV 
address, detailing the number who went and emphasizing the results 
of the trip.  He took on directly the newspaper El Comercio, 
challenging it to identify what additional members of the 
delegation were not related to the objectives of the trip. 
 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
 
Correa Pays Unofficial Visit to the U.K. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Correa's visit to London on October 26-38 did not involve 
officials meetings with the government.  Instead, he spoke at 
Oxford University and the London School of Economics, and met with 
Ecuadorian residents, Noam Chomsky, and two members of House of 
Lords.  UK Ambassador Linda Cross expressed frustration over the 
GOE's mishandling of the planning for the visit and stated that she 
had done everything possible to get him a meeting with the 
government but without results, in part due to an official Indian 
visit at the same time.  Correa stated during his November 7 radio 
address that only his Foreign Minister, Environment Minister, 
Secretary of Migration, National Planning Secretary and a 
representative of the Yasuni-ITT initiative traveled with him to 
the U.K. 
 
 
 
------------------------------- 
 
To Russia, With (Official) Love 
 
------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) By contrast, the visit to Moscow on October 29-30 was 
official, and President Correa was accompanied by a delegation of 
over 100 people, including ministers, advisers and 59 commercial 
representatives from various sectors.  During this first ever 
official visit by an Ecuadorian President to Russia, Correa met 
with President Dimitri Medvedev, Prime Minister Putin, Patriarch 
Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church, Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, 
and Russian business executives.  After over 20 years of 
inactivity, the Russian-Ecuadorian Intergovernmental Commission for 
Economic and Energy Issues met on October 28, chaired at the 
ministerial level.  MFA Director General Villagomez described the 
purpose of the trip to us on November 12 as strengthening ties and 
establishing a strategic partnership with Russia, "as the bilateral 
relationship had languished due to minimal assistance from the GOR 
and lack of Russian investment in Ecuador."  Contrary to his 
positive spin, the Embassy has heard rumors that two 
recently-departed senior MFA officials were replaced because Correa 
was displeased with the results of the visit. 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
Ecuador to "Consider" Recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
 
 
¶6.  (C) On recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, President 
Correa announced on October 30 that "if both territories officially 
ask Ecuador to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent 
states, we will seriously consider this request."  MFA DG 
Villagomez told Poloff that the GOR did not officially raise the 
subject during the visit, that neither of the two territories had 
formally made a request, and that no decisions had been made. 
Villagomez speculated that the President's statement came as a 
response during his interview with RIA Novosti.  He repeated an MFA 
mantra that the GOE supports the peaceful handling of such issues 
by multilateral fora, the U.N. in this case. 
 
 
 
¶7.  (C) The President's comment was criticized by some commentators 
as following in the footsteps of other ALBA members.  So far, 
Nicaragua and Venezuela are the only countries in the region who 
have recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent.  A 
number of commentators considered the political price was too high, 
and did not rise to the level of what Ecuador was getting from the 
exchange.  Political analyst Grace Jaramillo argued that if the GOE 
were ready to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, it should also 
recognize Chechnya. 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
Agreements Promise Increased Cooperation, but No Timelines 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
 
¶8.  (C) The presidents signed a Declaration on the Strategic 
Partnership focusing on trade, economic development, education, 
technology and cultural exchange.  Correa kept with his tradition 
of asking new partners for financial assistance by seeking a loan 
from the Russian government; he announced on November 4 that 
Ecuador would receive $2.5 billion in financing for its strategic 
sectors, although only two of the seven agreements included 
specific promises of financing, totaling $185 million.  MFA 
Director General Villagomez clarified that no formal agreement had 
 
been signed regarding the loans, and that this financing and all 
bilateral agreements likely would be realized in the long-term, but 
without specific timelines. 
 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU) According to an MFA press bulletin, the presidents also 
signed four Memoranda of Understanding in the areas of alternative 
energy sources and petroleum exploration, peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy, fourth generation communication and wireless data 
transmission technology (with $50 million in financing for the 
project), and customs assistance.  A Letter of Intention was also 
signed for Russian company OAO Interrao UES to complete 
construction and supply equipment to two Ecuadorian hydroelectric 
power plants along theToachi andPilaton rivers, with $135 million 
in financing for both projects.  In addition, an agreement to 
establish Manta and Vladivostok as sister cities was signed by the 
two mayors.  In the MOU on petroleum exploration, Russian oil 
companies OAO Zarubezhneft and OAO Sroytransgaz have agreed to 
participate in the development of oil block 31 inside the Yasuni 
National Park -- Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tipuni (ITT) area (Ref B). 
The visit also defined cooperation in education, including an 
agenda of bilateral meetings to establish the work plan for four 
research projects in bioremediation, petroleum, satellite systems 
for hydroelectric and natural risk management, and information 
technology. 
 
 
 
--------------------- 
 
Looking for Investors 
 
--------------------- 
 
 
 
¶10.  (U) Correa met with approximately 80 business leaders on 
October 30 to speak on investment opportunities in Ecuador, 
asserting that "according to our constitution, (international) 
investment can enjoy absolute judicial security."  He stipulated, 
however, that any interested investors must meet four basic ethics 
criteria: social (respect for workers' rights), market (offer of 
goods and services at fair prices), environmental (respect for 
environmental rights), and fiscal (adherance to tax obligations). 
Correa clarified in his November 7 radio address that not all 
foreign investment is desirable, and that it ideally should 
establish companies, create jobs, offer competitive prices, pay 
taxes and transfer technology. 
 
 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Contrary to press reports and MFA bulletins, the Central 
Bank's database shows that Russia is Ecuador's largest importer of 
bananas, second largest importer of flowers, third largest importer 
of coffee and non-petroleum products in general, and the fifth 
largest overall importer of Ecuadorian products.  Ecuador 
specifically produces a type of rose, with longer stems and larger 
bulbs, that is targeted to the Russian market.  Correa announced 
during the visit that the Russian air company Polet would begin 
direct charter cargo flights with its IL-96-400T and AN-124 
aircraft by the end of November; MFA DG Villagomez noted these 
potential charter flights are intended specifically to assist in 
transporting Ecuador's flowers, and are still to be confirmed. 
Exports to Russia increased by 33% from $412 million in 2007 to 
$549 million in 2008, but only an annualized 4% in the first three 
quarters of 2009.  Exports from January through September of 2009 
totaled $427 million and imports totaled $28 million, and are not 
likely to reach the MFA's estimated $1 billion for calendar year 
¶2009. 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
Military Purchases: Not Really Part of the Visit 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
 
¶12.  (C) While press reports that the visit resulted in an 
agreement to buy two Russian Mi-171E troop transport helicopters 
for $22 million, MFA DG Villagomez said that the contract had been 
signed before the visit, and were being purchased without any 
Russian financing.  (Note: Purchases of military equipment without 
financing has not been the case recently in Ecuador.  End Note.) 
Defense Minister Ponce announced on October 30 that Russia would 
provide military air and ground transport assistance, such as 
trucks and buses.  According to the press, Ecuador also is 
considering the purchase of Su-30MK2 fighter planes and 
anti-aircraft defense systems at a total value of $200 million. 
However, Villagomez observed that nothing had been agreed, and that 
these eventual purchases remained only an initial discussion.

Comment

¶13.  (C) The media and educated opposition have found a ripe target 
for criticizing Correa, given the appearance of profligacy, few 
benefits for Ecuador, and intellectual hypocrisy of the Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia issue.  Nonetheless, this issue is far from the 
minds of ordinary Ecuadorians who are more concerned with the poor 
economy and disruptive blackouts.  Therefore, Correa is unlikely to 
suffer much political harm, assuming Abkhazia and South Ossetia 
fade away as an issue.  We do not expect President Correa to 
recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia unless it is part of a tit for 
tat where he gets something more significant than we have heard 
about so far in return.  Even considering recognition seems 
inconsistent with the GOE's past opposition to independence of 
Kosovo and recognition of separatist movements (Ref C), probably in 
part because some in the Correa government fear of separatist 
tendencies in Ecuador's largest city of Guayaquil.
