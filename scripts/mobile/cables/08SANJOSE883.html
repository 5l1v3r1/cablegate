1.(C) Under direction from the Ambassador, on November 10, 
DCM and Pol/C raised Ref A demarche with MFA senior staff 
Antonio Alarcon and Alex Solano.  Alarcon is FM Stagno's COS, 
and handled Third Committee issues when he was assigned to 
the Costa Rican UN mission. Alex Solano is the Deputy 
Director for Foreign Policy.  We expressed USG gratitude for 
Costa Rica's continued opposition to no-action motions in the 
Third Committee, and, noting that Iran was a particular 
priority, we urged the GOCR to vote again in favor of 
substantive motions on Iran, Burma, and the DPRK, as they did 
in 2007. We also asked Costa Rica's help in stiffening the 
support on these issues from regional neighbors Panama and 
Colombia.  IO's country-specific non-papers on all three 
countries were very useful (but would have been even more so 
in Spanish); we delivered these as part of the demarche. 
 
¶2. (C) Alarcon and Solano quickly responded that Costa Rica 
would continue to oppose no-action motions as a matter of 
principle, and would vote in favor of substantive motions on 
all three countries.  The two indicated that the GOCR 
expected our demarche, which followed a similar approach to 
the GOCR mission in New York by USUN. Solano explained that 
Japanese diplomats had recently demarched the MFA to consider 
softening the GOCR's position vis-a-vis a DPRK resolution in 
hopes of improving the DPRK's cooperation in the Six Party 
talks.  The MFA refused to change its views and link the two 
initiatives.  On Iran, Solano voiced Costa Rican concerns 
about discrimination against religious groups, in particular 
Christians, but also other groups such as Bahais.  On Burma, 
Solano said that the regime's human rights violations were 
well-known and long-standing; of course Costa Rica would 
continue to call for change there. As we reported in Ref B, 
however, Solano re-iterated the GOCR's reluctance to 
co-sponsor resolutions (in the Third Committee or elsewhere) 
unless Costa Rica's views and specific language proposals 
were given due consideration. 
 
¶3. (C) Solano expected Colombia to continue to abstain in 
Third Committee votes this year, to avoild inviting attacks 
on its own human rights situation.  He doubted the GOC could 
be persuaded to change that position.  Solano was slightly 
more optimistic about Panama, based on deeper Costa 
Rica-Panama relations opened by President Torrijos' October 
visit.  Neither Solano nor Alarcon explicitly promised that 
the GOCR would lobby Panama on Third Committee issues, 
however, (and as noted in Ref A, Panama and Costa Rica voted 
with the USG position on the Iran, Burman and DPRK 
resolutions in 2007, anyway).
