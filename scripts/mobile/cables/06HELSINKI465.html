¶1. (C) SUMMARY: U/S for Political Affairs Lyra told 
Ambassador that the US and EU are making good progress 
toward finalizing Summit Declarations, although more work 
needs to be done to create a real dialogue on climate 
change and to find language that is not counterproductive 
to our shared goals regarding energy security and Russia. 
Separately, Lyra said that a Finnish donation of excess 
military equipment to the Afghan security forces was 
"politically not easy," but expressed caution optimism.  He 
also raised a recent media report about an alleged 
rendition flight through Finland in 2004.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) Ambassador called on Finnish MFA Undersecretary for 
Political Affairs Markus Lyra May 24.  Lyra will visit 
Washington May 31 for consultations regarding Finland's EU 
Presidency and to discuss the ongoing US-EU Summit 
Declaration negotiations. 
 
Climate Change and Energy Security 
---------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Lyra said that climate change is at the top of the 
EU agenda for the Summit.  Europe and the US need to stop 
talking past one another and to begin an actual dialogue on 
this difficult challenge, Lyra said, acknowledging that 
this would require that Europe "avoid mentioning Kyoto." 
The EU has offered language for the Declaration that is 
"very reasonable," he continued, noting that most member 
states strongly support the current EU draft and are eager 
to see a declaration that allows Europe and the United 
States to start addressing in concrete ways the climate 
change problem.  Ambassador welcomed the idea of a dialogue 
centered around concrete actions, and noted that moving 
beyond Kyoto was a helpful place to start that process. 
 
¶4. (C) On energy security, Lyra said the US and the EU 
broadly agree on both desired end states and the means to 
get there: market-based pricing, adequate investment in 
infrastructure, diversity of supply, new technologies. 
However, Lyra cautioned, if the Summit language is too 
blunt, it will have a counterproductive result not only in 
Moscow but also in Central Asia.  For example, the EU and 
the US agree that a charter that effectively requires 
Russia to dismantle energy monopolies is clearly desirable; 
however, it will yield no results if the US and Europe 
"pre-cook a deal and present it as a fait accompli," he 
said.  No one underestimates the problems and, indeed, the 
obfuscation Russia is engaging in, Lyra continued.  Russian 
promises to "marketize" prices, de-politicize supply to 
certain of its neighbors, and increase investment (despite 
Gazprom's hollow assertions that investment has been 
sufficient) are not being fulfilled, which is troublesome. 
The key for the Summit and Finland's presidency will be to 
state and implement an agenda that brings Russia into a 
modern energy framework without exacerbating deeply 
ingrained suspicions.  The Ambassador responded by noting 
that while alienating the Russians is in no one's interest, 
neither is a status quo that permits Russia to cling to 
outdated, politicized means of supplying energy.  She 
acknowledged the EU's hesitancy about, for example, tough 
language in the Summit Declarations, but emphasized that 
Europe and the US needed to come together in a way that 
protects their own interests and lays down markers to 
Russia regarding what real partnership means. 
 
Afghan Arms Donation 
-------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) Turning to Afghanistan, the Ambassador reminded 
Lyra of the standing US request that Finland donate a large 
lot of excess AK-47s (and possibly some additional 
equipment) to the Afghan security forces (Refs A and B). 
Lyra was well-briefed on the issue, and noted that the 
Minister of Defense would be issuing a formal 
recommendation on June 5.  The MOD's position, as Lyra 
understood it, was that with ongoing upgrades and some 
changes in GOF defense planning, the AKs had indeed become 
excess and Afghan donation seemed like a logical means of 
disposal.  However, he added, "politically it is not easy." 
The GOF has had an unwritten but long-standing policy of 
donating only non-lethal equipment in unstable, conflict- 
prone regions, mainly for fear that ultimately the weapons 
could end up in the wrong hands.  On the other hand, the 
GOF was well aware that the Afghans' capabilities and 
professionalism had improved and that increased security 
problems demanded adequate equipment.  The Ambassador 
highlighted the needs in Afghanistan and noted that the US 
would not be making the request if it had strong doubts 
 
about where the weapons might end up.  Lyra acknowledged 
this and expressed guarded optimism that if the MOD 
strongly recommended in favor of the donation, the GOF 
would approve it. 
 
More Rendition Flight Allegations 
--------------------------------- 
¶6. (C) Finally, Lyra raised a May 22 Finnish television 
report alleging that a CIA rendition flight transited 
Helsinki in late 2004 (Ref C).  Lyra agreed that the report 
offered little evidence regarding the alleged flight, and 
accepted the Ambassador's statements indicating that the US 
does not condone torture but cannot comment on specific 
flights.  The Ambassador expressed appreciation that FM 
Tuomioja had sought to downplay the allegations in the 
press, and Lyra responded that the GOF did not wish to make 
a big issue out of the TV report.
