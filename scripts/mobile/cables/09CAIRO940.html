(C) The Ambassador spoke to FM Aboul Ghayt before his departure for the U.S. and asked that Egypt strongly consider voting for Yukiya Amano of Japan for IAEA Director General (ref A). He immediately responded "no." Egyptian views on the Japanese candidacy, he explained, stem from Egyptian experience with the Japanese "who never support us" and "who block us everywhere." He said they would vote for anyone but the Japanese candidate and indicated they would stick with their first-round candidate, Abdul Minty of South Africa (ref B). Aboul Ghayt left little room for discussion. The Ambassador noted strong U.S. interest in finding the most qualified person and believed it was the Japanese candidate. She indicated that the topic may come up for discussion again during his upcoming visit to Washington. Aboul Ghayt said Egypt's response would be the same. SCOBEY</h3><p><pre>09CAIRO940
