¶1. (C) SUMMARY: In meetings with MFA officials responsible 
for Afghanistan policy, poloff delivered reftel points 
regarding USG expectations of the new Karzai government and 
solicited information on the redesign of the Swedish-Finnish 
PRT.  The interlocutors noted a lack of USG emphasis on 
follow-on elections and economic development while signaling 
an interest in hosting a visit from USG officials once a new 
Afghanistan strategy has been decided in Washington.  The 
Swedish-Finnish PRT redesign is likely to receive 
political-level approval before mid-2010 but is not likely to 
result in a civilian-led PRT.  Finland is likely to remove 
its four civilians from Mazar-e-Sharif while maintaining the 
current level of military forces.  When NATO solicits views 
from non-ally ISAF troop contributors, the GOF would 
appreciate more time to provide its input. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) On November 18 poloff delivered reftel points to MFA 
Afghanistan desk officer Niko Heimola.  While affirming that 
Finland broadly shared the same view of what was required of 
the Karzai government, Heimola noted that our points did not 
appear to mention setting the conditions for future 
parliamentary elections or place much emphasis on 
growth/development.  Poloff responded that preventing 
corruption would be essential to both of these goals. 
Regarding the need for the international community to support 
Afghan-led reconciliation and reintegration efforts, Heimola 
confirmed that the frequent suggestions of Defense Minister 
Hakamies that Finnish MP and EU Sudan/Darfur mediator Pekka 
Haavisto would be a good candidate to serve as a mediator in 
Afghanistan had not been discussed in the GOF.  NOTE: This 
confirms what we had previously heard. END NOTE  He further 
mentioned that reintegration is already going on at the local 
level in the Finnish-Swedish area of responsibility and that 
Finland was working to create &alternative livelihoods8 for 
former fighters.  He agreed that the process must be 
Afghan-led, local, and that results won,t happen quickly. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Heimola indicated that the GOF would be eager to 
hear directly from U.S. officials after President Obama makes 
his decision on the new U.S. strategy.  He noted that many 
GOF officials will be difficult to reach from 25 December 
until 7 January. 
 
¶4. (C) In a separate November 23 meeting with the Director of 
the MFA's Security Policy unit, Timo Kantola, poloff 
solicited information regarding the possible reconfiguration 
of the Finnish-Swedish PRT based in Mazar-e-Sharif.  A 
somewhat uncomfortable Kantola was dismissive of media 
reports indicating that the PRT could become civilian-led and 
that the number of Finnish troops might be doubled to two 
hundred.  "This is not what the Swedes are planning," Kantola 
indicated, going on to explain that the Swedes and Finns were 
unlikely to adopt the model being used by the Turks, also in 
Mazar-e-Sharif, under which Turkish soldiers provide the 
force protection while civilians are responsible for most 
other duties.  Kantola revealed that Finland was nlikely to 
continue fielding the four civilians it had in the PRT due to 
problems they posed in maintaining a clear chain of command 
and the different security standards prevailing for civilians 
and soldiers.  Kantola expected that the Finnish military 
contingent of the PRT would remain at about 100 soldiers but 
that Finland would probably provide a few more police 
trainers to EUPOL in order to rise from the current 24 to the 
goal of 30.  A political decision on implementing a 
redesigned PRT, whatever it might look like, is likely to 
come before April or May, with implementation in the last 
half of 2010, according to Kantola.  NOTE:  GOF sources had 
previously indicated that a decision was likely after 
April/May 2010 with implementation in 2011.  END NOTE. 
 
¶5. (C) Kantola, whose unit is principally responsible for 
ISAF within the MFA, expressed some frustration with the 
short time windows in which non-ally ISAF troop contributors 
are asked to provide their input.  "We usually get a request 
for input in the evening and the response needs to be back in 
Brussels the next morning," he explained.  Even six more 
hours to formulate a response would be a welcome improvement 
and would go some way towards making Finland feel like its 
input was actually valued.  Kantola indicated that the GOF 
was examining its own internal information flow from its 
mission at NATO to ensure the speediest possible 
communication regarding ISAF matters.
