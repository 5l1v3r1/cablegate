  		<h1>EGYPTIAN RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON AN INTERNATIONAL PIRACY COURT REF: STATE 58579 Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs William R. Stewart for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(C) Summary: -- Post delivered reftel demarche and the non-paper on an international piracy court on June 23 to Egyptian MFA Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister for East and South African Affairs, Ambassador Abdelhameed Marzouk. Marzouk stated that the Government of Egypt (GOE) was one of the first countries to espouse some type of international court to prosecute pirates and it still supports the idea. -- The GOE believes that creating national piracy laws will take significant time and will lead to inconsistencies in punishments for pirates. -- Piracy has been around for some time and will continue to be a problem because of the situation on the ground in Somalia. An international piracy court is an appropriate long-term solution to deal with the piracy phenomenon.</h1>
