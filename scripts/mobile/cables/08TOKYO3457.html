¶1.  (C)  Summary: U.S. and Japanese negotiators reached an ad 
ref agreement on December 15 for a bilateral International 
Agreement (IA) committing the Japanese government to provide 
USD 2.8 billion to construct facilities and infrastructure on 
Guam to support the relocation of III Marine Expeditionary 
Forces (MEF) units from Okinawa.  The ad ref agreement meets 
all of the negotiating objectives contained in Reftel.  The 
text includes linkages, approved at the Prime Ministerial 
level, between construction of facilities on Guam and 
Japanese actions to complete the Futenma Replacement Facility 
(FRF).  The Japanese government agreed to measure its cash 
contributions for Guam projects in USFY2008 constant dollars 
and provide the U.S. government flexibility in funds 
management.  On December 13, the Ministry of Finance approved 
USD 336 million for Guam projects in the JFY2009 budget.  The 
Japanese government has also indicated plans to accelerate 
Diet approval of the IA in order to mitigate against the risk 
of an early election.  The decision to conclude a 
Treaty-level (on the Japanese side) agreement committing 
Tokyo to provide multi-year funding for Guam and compelling 
completion of the FRF as a precondition to relocating III MEF 
elements to Okinawa significantly reduces the risk that local 
politics in Okinawa or a change in government in Tokyo will 
result in the unraveling of the May 1, 2006 realignment 
package.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  U.S. and Japanese negotiators concluded an ad ref 
International Agreement (IA) regarding the implementation of 
the relocation of III MEF personnel from Okinawa to Guam on 
December 15.  The Japanese government requested a bilateral 
IA in order to secure multi-year funding from the Diet for 
the Guam relocation, part of the package of U.S. Forces 
realignment measures agreed upon at the May 1, 2006 Security 
Consultative Committee (SCC) meeting.  In addition to legally 
binding the current and future Japanese Cabinets to implement 
the political-level SCC agreement, the Japanese government 
sought clarity from the U.S. government on how Japanese funds 
would be managed.  Tokyo specifically requested assurances 
from the U.S. government on equal treatment for Japanese 
companies bidding on Japanese-funded projects, tax 
exemptions, and a mechanism for Japan to incrementally fund 
multi-year projects.  The Japanese side also sought to 
measure Japan's USD 2.8 billion (the cash portion of Japan's 
6.09 billion overall commitment) contribution in nominal 2008 
dollars (i.e. not to be adjusted for inflation).  The 
Japanese government also sought confirmation from the U.S. 
side that it remained committed to relocating to Guam, and 
that the U.S. would reach mutual agreement with Japan over 
 
TOKYO 00003457  002 OF 012 
 
 
any major actions that would affect the use of the facilities 
(such as a future Base Realignment and Closure decision to 
draw down forces in Guam). 
 
¶3.  (C)  In agreeing to enter into IA negotiations, the U.S. 
government insisted that the IA be part of an overall package 
to include: 1) an explicit linkage in the IA that the 
Relocation of III MEF elements to Guam be made contingent on 
completion of the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF); 2) full 
funding for JFY2009 projects on Guam identified by the Joint 
Guam Program Office (JGPO); 3) agreement on the flexible use 
of funds, including interest, deposited in the U.S. Treasury 
for Guam construction projects; 4) calculation of Japan's USD 
2.8 billion in constant dollars or agreement to off-set lost 
purchasing power through use of a nominal calculation; and 5) 
adequate funding for the FRF.  The U.S. side also made clear 
that the IA and the Implementing Guidance (IG) are linked and 
must be read together to constitute a whole agreement. 
Furthermore, the U.S. side made clear that the IA would be 
treated as an executive agreement by the United States 
Government and not made subject to Senate approval. 
 
---------------- 
Ad Ref Agreement 
---------------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  After a series of negotiating sessions in Washington 
and Tokyo from November 4 to December 15, the two sides 
reached substantive agreement on the IA and a set of side 
arrangements.  These side arrangements include detailed 
Department of Defense (DOD)-Ministry of Defense (MOD) 
Implementing Guidance (IG), an Exchange of Diplomatic Notes, 
and an oral commitment to be made by the Japanese Foreign 
Minister at the time of the signing of the IA.  The contents 
of all three separate arrangements were agreed upon at the 
same time as the ad ref agreement for the IA, and were 
confirmed only after the Japanese side reported that it had 
secured sufficient budget for Guam projects in the JFY2009 
budget request.  This set of arrangements meets the 
negotiating instructions contained in Reftel and addresses 
all the U.S. objectives stated in para 3 above.  Specifically: 
 
-- Objective 1:  Explicit linkage in the IA that the 
Relocation of III MEF elements to Guam be made contingent on 
completion of the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF): 
Preamble paragraph 9 and Articles 2, 3, and 9 incorporate 
this explicit linkage. 
 
-- Objective 2: Secure adequate funding for JFY2009: 
Immediately upon conclusion of a substantive agreement on the 
IA/IG texts, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) agreed to budget 
USD 336 million for Guam relocation projects in the JFY2009 
budget.  This budget will be approved by the Cabinet and made 
public on or about December 20. 
 
-- Objective 3:  Agreement on the flexible use of funds, 
 
TOKYO 00003457  003 OF 012 
 
 
including interest, deposited in the U.S. Treasury for Guam 
construction projects:  Through both the IA, especially 
Article 7, and the IG, the Japanese government agreed to the 
flexible use of Japanese funds to cover potential cost 
overruns and other contingencies (details contained in 
paragraph 3 (f) of the IG).  The Japanese side also agreed to 
seek additional funding if necessary to meet project-funding 
obligations (also para 3 (f) of the IG).  Moreover, Japan 
committed to transfer funds in a timely way each year.  The 
IG (paragraph 3 (a)) stipulates that Japan will transfer its 
annual contributions within 30 days of the annual Exchange of 
Notes (EON) confirming the proposed Guam-related budget for 
each fiscal year.  Japan's fiscal year begins on April 1 and 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has committed to 
completing the EON ""as soon as possible"" after the Diet 
enacts the annual budget in late March.  This commitment will 
be reaffirmed by the Foreign Minister at the time the IA is 
formally signed. 
 
-- Objective 4:  Preserve Purchasing Power of the Japanese 
Contribution: The Japanese government agreed to calculate its 
USD 2.8 billion contributions in 2008 constant (i.e., 
adjusted for inflation) dollars.  The Japanese side further 
agreed (IG paragraph 3 (b)) to discount their contribution 
using the specific index proposed by the USG (i.e., the 
Engineering News Record-Building Cost Index ""ENR BCI""). 
 
-- Objective 5:  Adequate funding for the FRF: MOD informed 
the Embassy that MOF approved nearly USD 300 million (total) 
for FRF projects in JFYs 2009 and 2010. 
 
-- Preserving the status as an Executive Agreement for the 
United States: U.S. commitments are caveated as being subject 
to the availability of funds, tangible progress on the FRF, 
and Japanese funding for Guam Relocation.  The U.S. entirely 
rebuffed Japanese pressure to grant new tax exemptions or 
allow incremental funding mechanisms for Japanese projects. 
The U.S. side made clear that all actions under the IA will 
be undertaken in accordance with relevant U.S. laws and 
regulations. 
 
------------------ 
Way Ahead/Timeline 
------------------ 
 
¶5.  (C)  Given the potential for a general election after the 
start of the Japanese fiscal year on April 1, 2009, the 
Japanese side has decided to accelerate Diet review of the 
IA.  The IA need only be approved by the Diet's Lower House, 
which is now dominated by the ruling coalition.  Even if the 
opposition-controlled Upper House were to vote it down or 
take no action, the IA would be ratified 30 days after Lower 
House approval.  In order to meet this timetable, MOFA has 
asked the U.S. to be prepared to sign the IA the weeks of 
February 9 or 16, either in Washington or Tokyo.  If this 
schedule holds, the timeline will be as follows: 
 
TOKYO 00003457  004 OF 012 
 
 
 
December 15: Ad Ref Agreement Reached 
December 19: Japan's Cabinet approves JFY2009 budget, 
including USD 336 million for Guam 
January 5: Diet regular session convenes 
Mid-January: JFY2009 budget submitted to the Diet 
Mid-February: IA signed by Japanese Foreign Minister and a 
U.S. counterpart 
Early March: JFY2009 budget enacted/IA submitted to Diet 
Mid/Late March: IA approved by Diet Lower House 
Mid/Late April: IA ratified

Begin draft text of the IA 
 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN CONCERNING THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RELOCATION OF III MARINE EXPEDITIONARY 
FORCE PERSONNEL AND THEIR DEPENDENTS FROM OKINAWA TO GUAM 
 
The Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of Japan, 
 
Affirming that the United States-Japan security arrangements, 
based on the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security 
between the United States of America and Japan signed at 
Washington on January 19, 1960, is the cornerstone for 
achieving common security objectives, 
 
Recalling that, at the meeting of the United States-Japan 
Security Consultative Committee on May 1, 2006, the Ministers 
recognized that the implementation of the realignment 
initiatives described in the Security Consultative Committee 
document, ""United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment 
Implementation"" (hereinafter referred to as ""the Roadmap"") 
will lead to a new phase in alliance cooperation, and reduce 
the burden on local communities, including those on Okinawa, 
thereby providing the basis for enhanced public support for 
the security alliance, 
 
Emphasizing their recognition of the importance of Guam for 
forward presence of United States Marine Corps forces, which 
provides assurance of the United States' commitment to 
security and strengthens deterrent capabilities in the 
 
TOKYO 00003457  005 OF 012 
 
 
Asia-Pacific region, 
 
Reaffirming that the Roadmap emphasizes the importance of 
force reductions and relocation to Guam in relation to the 
realignment on Okinawa and stipulates that approximately 
8,000 III Marine Expeditionary Force (hereinafter referred to 
as ""the III MEF"") personnel and their approximately 9,000 
dependents will relocate from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, in a 
manner that maintains unit integrity, and recognizing that 
such relocation will realize consolidation and land returns 
south of Kadena, 
 
Recalling that the Roadmap stipulates that United States 
Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters will be relocated from Marine 
Corps Air Station Iwakuni to Guam when the III MEF personnel 
relocate from Okinawa to Guam, the KC-130 squadron will be 
based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni with its 
headquarters, maintenance support facilities, and family 
support facilities, and the aircraft will regularly deploy on 
a rotational basis for training and operations to Maritime 
Self-Defense Forces Kanoya Base and Guam, 
 
Reaffirming that the Roadmap stipulates that, of the 
estimated ten billion, two hundred seventy million United 
States dollar ($10,270,000,000) cost of the facilities and 
infrastructure development costs for the III MEF relocation 
to Guam, Japan will provide six billion, ninety million 
United States dollars ($6,090,000,000) (in U.S. Fiscal Year 
2008 dollars), including two billion, eight hundred million 
United States dollars ($2,800,000,000) in direct cash 
contributions, to develop facilities and infrastructure on 
Guam to enable the III MEF relocation, recognizing the strong 
desire of Okinawa residents that such force relocation be 
realized rapidly, 
 
Reaffirming further that the Roadmap stipulates that the 
United States will fund the remainder of the facilities and 
infrastructure development costs for the relocation to 
Guam-estimated in U.S. Fiscal Year 2008 dollars at three 
billion, one hundred eighteen million United States dollars 
($3,180,000,000) in fiscal spending plus approximately one 
billion ($1,000,000,000) for a road, 
 
Recalling that the Roadmap stipulates that, within the 
overall package, the Okinawa-related realignment initiatives 
are interconnected, specifically, consolidation and land 
returns south of Kadena depend on completing the relocation 
of III MEF personnel and dependents from Okinawa to Guam, and 
the III MEF relocation from Okinawa to Guam is dependent on: 
(1) tangible progress toward completion of the Futenma 
Replacement Facility, and (2) Japan's financial contributions 
to fund development of required facilities and infrastructure 
on Guam, 
 
Have agreed as follows:

Preamble 
-------- 
 
¶9.  (C)  Most of the language in the Preamble came directly 
from existing public documents, especially the United 
States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation (""the 
Roadmap""), released by the Security Consultative Committee 
(SCC) on May 1, 2006.  The U.S. requested two specific areas 
of the public documents be clarified in the Preamble.  First, 
the U.S. requested that the Preamble introduce the idea that 
the ""approximately 9,000 dependents"" that will transfer with 
the 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam be described as 
""associated dependents"" to capture the idea that there may be 
more dependents joining the Marines on Guam than currently 
 
TOKYO 00003457  011 OF 012 
 
 
reside with those same Marines on Okinawa due to differing 
stationing policies.  The second was a U.S. request that the 
Preamble delete reference to the approximately one billion 
dollar military road on Guam.  This road was included during 
the April 2006 negotiations on cost-sharing as a way to 
increase the overall cost estimate (i.e., the denominator) 
and thereby reduce the share of total costs borne by Japan. 
During the negotiations over the IA Preamble language, the 
U.S. clarified that the United States would not consider the 
road an absolute prerequisite for the completion of the 
Relocation.  The Japanese side acknowledged both points, but 
strongly resisted any language that differed from existing 
public formulations out of concern that changes would draw 
Diet scrutiny that would distract from focus on the key 
issues in the IA.  Having registered these clarifications, 
and obtained satisfactory corresponding Japanese 
acknowledgment, the U.S. side acceded to the Japanese request 
to adhere to existing Roadmap language. 
 
¶10.  (C)  Separately, the U.S. introduced two issues into the 
Preamble that had not previously been in public documents. 
The first is paragraph four of the Preamble (""Emphasizing 
their recognition of the importance of Guam for forward 
presence"")  The U.S. had requested even stronger language to 
stress the unique capabilities of Guam in the context of 
overall U.S. Pacific Strategy.  However, MOD, reportedly at 
the level of Administrative Vice Minister Kohei Masuda, was 
not willing to use the words ""unique,"" ""strategic,"" or 
""location"" in a bilateral document due to ""political 
sensitivities"" (implying Japan's war-time history with Guam). 
 The U.S. noted its disappointment that the Japanese side was 
not willing to provide requested language. 
 
¶11.  (C)  Additionally, the U.S. proposed references to the 
opportunities provided by Guam relocation for increased 
Self-Defense Force (SDF) training.  Although explicit 
language exists in Agreed Implementation Plans (AIP) that 
points to specific commitment by Japan to maintain a 
near-continuous rotational presence on Guam for training, and 
although earlier SCC documents speak more generically about 
training opportunities offered by Guam, the MOD refused to 
mention training, again invoking AVM Masuda's personal veto 
of such a reference.  The MOD argued that reference to SDF 
training was outside the scope of the IA, would attract a 
number of distracting questions, and would leave MOD unable 
to address those questions given the undeveloped plans for 
SDF training on Guam.  The U.S. side registered its strong 
disappointment and pledged to work with the Japanese side to 
find other ways to promote the positive effect of U.S.-Japan 
training cooperation on Guam.

Article 1 
--------- 
 
¶12.  (C)  The purpose of Article 1 is to highlight Japan's 
 
TOKYO 00003457  012 OF 012 
 
 
obligations.  Paragraph 1 captures the Japanese government's 
overall commitment for multi-year funding, and paragraph 2 
notes that Tokyo's actual contributions will be decided 
annually based on the program implementation.  The ""further 
arrangements"" referenced in paragraph 2 are the annual 
Exchanges of Notes and Annexes (see para 7 above).  Japanese 
commitments are subject to conditions outlined in Article 9, 
displaced from Article 1 in order to keep the tone of Article 
1 ""more positive,"" at the direction of MOFA Administrative 
Vice Minister Mitoji Yabunaka. 
 
¶13.  (C)  Definitions: Article 1 includes the definition of 
""the Relocation"" as ""the relocation of approximately 8,000 
III Marine Expeditionary Force personnel and their 
approximately 9,000 dependents from Okinawa to Guam.""  The 
Japanese side specifically highlighted that this definition 
deliberately excludes a reference to ""by 2014"" as part of the 
IA obligation, thereby allowing Japanese funding to continue 
beyond 2014, if necessary.  The two sides had a frank 
discussion about the origins of the numbers 8,000/9,000 in 
relation to actual personnel and dependents on Okinawa who 
will move to Guam.  The number 8,000 refers to authorized 
positions in the units identified in the AIPs as relocating 
to Guam.  The number 9,000 dependents is based on a 
calculation of the number of dependents associated with such 
units if manned in full.  In the context of drafting the 2006 
Roadmap, both the 8,000 and the 9,000 numbers were 
deliberately maximized to optimize political value in Japan, 
but the two sides knew that these numbers differed 
significantly from actual Marines and dependents assigned to 
units in Okinawa.  To clarify the balance, the AIP also 
identifies that 10,000 Marines will remain on Okinawa, and 
lists the units associated with those 10,000 Marines.  In 
2004-2006, when the Roadmap was negotiated, the number of 
Marines assigned to the units in Okinawa was on the order of 
13,000, significantly less than the 18,000 authorized. 
Likewise, the total number of dependents on Okinawa was less 
than 9,000.  These numbers are regularly briefed by U.S. 
Forces Japan to various Japanese counterparts.  Japanese Diet 
members from Okinawa have also highlighted that the number of 
authorized Marine/dependents moving to Guam described in the 
public report does not match actual numbers on Okinawa today.
