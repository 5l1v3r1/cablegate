</p><p> 
</p><p>¶1.  (C) Summary: In a wide-ranging conversation with DCM, 
</p><p>Secretary General of the Presidency Oscar Parrilli said GoA 
</p><p> 
</p><p>SIPDIS 
</p><p>efforts to control prices were working and that the 2006 
</p><p>inflation rate would be lower than generally expected.  He 
</p><p>defended the government's approach to controlling the 
</p><p>piquetero movement and demonstrations, claiming recent 
</p><p>violence during a labor dispute in Santa Cruz province 
</p><p>(during which a policeman was killed) would have been much 
</p><p>worse had the police force been armed.  Regarding the 2007 
</p><p>presidential elections, Parrilli said President Nestor 
</p><p>Kirchner would not announce his decision on whether to seek 
</p><p>reelection until the end of this year but speculated he would 
</p><p>run and that his main competitor would be Neuquen governor 
</p><p>Jorge Sobisch.  End Comment. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (C) The DCM and PolCouns met on February 9 with Oscar 
</p><p>Parrilli, the Secretary General of the Presidency and one of 
</p><p>a small group of advisors considered to be in President 
</p><p>Kirchner's inner circle.  (See Reftel A for biographic 
</p><p>details on Parrilli and other inner circle members.)  To open 
</p><p>the discussion, the DCM noted recent developments in 
</p><p>U.S.-Argentine relations including the January 12 meeting of 
</p><p>Assistant Secretary Tom Shannon with Kirchner (Reftel B), the 
</p><p>visit of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Rogelio 
</p><p>Pardo-Maurer (Reftel C) and emphasized the importance of 
</p><p>continued assistance and cooperation on regional issues such 
</p><p>as Haiti and Bolivia and multilateral issues such as the 
</p><p>recent IAEA Board of Governors meeting in which Argentina 
</p><p>supported the reporting of Iran to the UN Security Council. 
</p><p>Regarding potential issues of concern, the DCM noted the 
</p><p>continued destabilizing activities of Venezuelan president 
</p><p>Hugo Chavez, the rising inflation rate in Argentina and labor 
</p><p>violence in Kirchner's home province of Santa Cruz (Reftel D). 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (C) Responding first to the issue of inflation, Parrilli 
</p><p>said the recent round of price control agreements with retail 
</p><p>and industry sectors had been successful and that the rate of 
</p><p>inflation in February would be significantly lower than in 
</p><p>January (when it reached 1.3 percent).  He opined the 
</p><p>government could keep the inflation rate during the remainder 
</p><p>of 2006 to under ten percent.  The DCM noted that while price 
</p><p>controls could provide short-term relief to inflationary 
</p><p>trends, ultimately, appropriate monetary and fiscal policies 
</p><p>were the only long-term solutions for controlling inflation. 
</p><p>Parrilli said the GoA was committed to maintaining high 
</p><p>reserves and a competitive exchange rate while at the same 
</p><p>time making the necessary infrastructure investments to 
</p><p>continue economic and social development. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4.  (C) On the question of Chavez, Parrilli said Argentina 
</p><p>had economic ties with Venezuela that could not be 
</p><p>discounted.  He noted in particular Venezuela's purchase of 
</p><p>Argentine bonds.  When pressed by the DCM on Chavez's 
</p><p>undermining of democratic institutions in Venezuela, Parrilli 
</p><p>only responded that the GoA's economic ties with Venezuela 
</p><p>did not mean support for Chavez's heavy-handed ways. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5.  (C) Turning to the violent labor dispute in Santa Cruz 
</p><p>province that left one policeman dead, Parrilli defended 
</p><p>government tactics in dealing with demonstrations and 
</p><p>piquetero groups.  He said the government's decision to use 
</p><p>only minimal force in dealing with protesters was the correct 
</p><p>one, even in the current situation.  Had the police responded 
</p><p>in kind to the strikers in Santa Cruz, there would have been 
</p><p>thirty dead instead of just one, he said.  More generally, 
</p><p>Parrilli said the government's strategy to isolate and/or 
</p><p>coopt piquetero groups had been successful and that the 
</p><p>number of protesters who now show up for demonstrations has 
</p><p>declined significantly in the last three years.  What 
</p><p>remained, he said, was a group of hard left, professional 
</p><p>agitators who refused to enter into any sort of dialogue. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6.  (C) When asked for his perspective on domestic politics, 
</p><p>Parrilli said Kirchner would not make any announcements 
</p><p>regarding his electoral intentions for 2007 until the end of 
</p><p>this year.  Speaking on a personal basis, Parrilli said it 
</p><p>would clearly be easier to move forward with the 
</p><p>administration's long-term goals for Argentina if Kirchner 
</p><p>remained as president for a second term.  Asked who his 
</p><p> 
</p><p>likely competitor might be, Parrilli said Governor Sobisch of 
</p><p>Neuquen Province would be the chief rival but added he would 
</p><p>not provide stiff competition for Kirchner.  He opined that 
</p><p>Buenos Aires city national deputy Mauricio Macri would opt 
</p><p>for the Buenos Aires city chief of government race. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7.  (C) Comment: Parrilli's role in the inner circle is 
</p><p>primarily that of Kirchner's gatekeeper.  While not a policy 
</p><p>advisor himself, his views certainly reflect Kirchner's 
</p><p>thinking on pivotal issues such as the economy.  What was 
</p><p>most striking about Parrilli's comments was their reflection 
</p><p>of old-school, classic Peronist thinking, in particular in 
</p><p>their faith in government intervention and price controls in 
</p><p>the economy.  Also notable (and consistent with classic 
</p><p>Peronism) was Parrilli's rejection of the hard left in 
</p><p>Argentine politics, which could presage a more firm 
</p><p>government response in the future to violent demonstrations. 
</p><p>End Comment.
