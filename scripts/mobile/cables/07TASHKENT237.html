 \
¶1. (C)  Summary: Zeromax, a Swiss-registered company linked \
to President Karimov's daughter, Gulnora Karimova, has made a \
strong mark in the gasoline service sector through its \
opening of over ten modern, full-service stations under the \
name UzGazOil.  UzGazOil appears to have a monopoly on \
high-octane gas and first-rights access to other octanes. \
Long lines are a common sight at these stations in Tashkent. \
Overall Uzbek production of petrochemicals fell in 2006 and \
will likely continue its downslide until foreign exploration \
results in actual extraction and production; something at \
least a few years away.  End summary. \
 \
SHINY NEW STATIONS PROLIFERATE . . . \
------------------------------------- \
 \
¶2. (SBU) In 2006, Zeromax expanded into the retail gas sector \
and now operates over ten cookie-cutter service stations in \
Tashkent under the name UzGazOil.  A business contact in the \
oil and gas industry told poloff the company plans to build \
more of these modern, bright red, full-service stations, \
squeezing out the privately-owned "Ma and Pop" stations.  The \
UzGazOil stations often charge about 100 soum/liter (30 cents \
per gallon) more than other stations for Uzbek-produced 80 \
octane gasoline.  It has a loose monopoly on importing Kazakh \
and Russian-produced, higher octane gasoline, and sells it \
for around 1,400 soum/liter ($4.25 per gallon).  However, the \
higher octanes (89 and up) are seldom available at UzGazOil \
and almost never at other stations.  (Note: Rumor is that \
only certain UzGazOil stations carry high-octane gas, which \
is provided to the well-connected in Tashkent to fuel their \
Mercedes Benzes.  A month ago, DCM visited three different \
UzGazOil stations in search of 93 and 95 octane gas.  He was \
told at each that they had not carried high octane for a \
month or more.  End note.)  Most of the gas pumps are \
identical to those used in the U.S.  Chevron-Texaco has \
expanded its business in Uzbekistan and supplies lubricants \
to UzGazOil for its oil-changing stations.  There are even \
car washes and car vacuums, but not all are in operation. \
 \
. . . GAS SHORTAGES AT MA AND POP STATIONS \
------------------------------------------- \
 \
¶3. (SBU) Every morning and evening during rush hour, the \
lines at the UzGazOil stations spill into the street for 80 \
octane.  Teenage entrepreneurs walk up and down the long \
lines offering car trinkets, such as air fresheners and \
sunglass holders.  These lines are not necessarily a signal \
of high demand, but of fuel shortages, especially at \
privately-owned stations.  While gasoline is not (yet) \
rationed in Tashkent as it is in the provinces, UzGazOil \
appears to have first-rights access to supplies. In the \
provinces, such as Urgench, Nukus and Ferghana, gasoline is \
often rationed and also resold on the black market, \
especially during the spring and fall harvest seasons.  For \
the moment, UzGazOil stations are only in Tashkent. \
 \
SLIGHT DECLINE IN PRODUCTION \
---------------------------- \
 \
¶4. (U) Uzbekistan must import oil to meet domestic demand. \
Official statistics state that domestic oil production peaked \
in 1999 at 8.1 million tons, but it has since slid down to \
under four million tons.  In 2006, oil production was 3,450 \
million tons, only 0.2 percent higher than 2005.  Domestic \
gasoline production is also sliding, along with other \
petrochemical products.  According to official 2006 \
statistics, Uzbekistan produced 1,370,000 tons of gasoline, \
down 1.8 percent from 2005; and fuel oil production slid 8.5 \
percent to 895,600 tons in 2006.  Combined, total \
petrochemical production fell approximately four percent in \
¶2006. \
 \
¶5. (C) Comment: Zeromax's connections through its unofficial \
CEO Gulnora Karimova to the state energy monopoly \
Uzbekneftegaz, and to Russian-owned Gazprom and Lukoil, \
lubricate business dealings and ensure UzGazOil's gasoline \
supplies.  Zeromax has a loose monopoly on high-octane gas, \
although it is not a reliable retailer of it.  The company \
appears to be quietly creating a monopoly over consistent \
supply of all other octanes. \
 \
¶6. (C) Comment cont.: Uzbekistan needs foreign investment to \
resuscitate its ailing petrochemical industry.  In 2006, \
 \
TASHKENT 00000237  002 OF 002 \
 \
 \
Uzbekistan diversified the cast of characters involved in the \
energy sector and signed exploration agreements with \
state-owned energy companies in Russia, Malaysia, China, and \
South Korea, among others.  Once oil and gas deposits are \
confirmed, actual production is still a few years away. \
Until gasoline production increases and the Uzbek elite \
weaken their stronghold on the energy sector, domestic \
consumers will continue to suffer shortages and high prices \
for high octane gasoline. \
