¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY.  Given the Houthis' opacity and the 
government's exaggerated claims about their goals, it is 
difficult to know what exactly they are fighting for.  The 
ROYG accuses the Houthis of wanting to restore clerical rule 
in Yemen, which they deny, insisting instead that they want 
basic citizenship rights and religious freedoms.  Although 
some Yemeni analysts believe the Houthis' goals may be 
broader, possibly including political control of Sa'ada 
governorate, most informed observers do not believe that the 
Houthis desire to re-establish the imamate or expand their 
control beyond Sa'ada.  In November 2009, the Houthis 
presented President Saleh with a list of conditions for 
guaranteeing a final resolution to the conflict.  These 
include reconstruction and compensation for war-time damage 
and looting, genuine economic development and delivery of 
basic services, and an end to cultural and political 
discrimination against Zaydis, who form the majority of 
Sa'ada governorate's population.  The Houthis, feeling that 
Zaydi Shi'ism is under threat from the growing influence of 
Sunni Salafism, also reportedly seek to establish their own 
madrasas (religious schools) and a university for Zaydi 
jurisprudence in order to preserve their unique identity, 
religious beliefs, and practices.  Understanding the Houthis' 
objectives can help shape a political solution to this 
complex conflict, though additional factors, such as tribal 
vendettas, will also need to be taken into account in order 
to bring the fighting to an end.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The information in this cable is compiled from 
PolOff interviews with sources who have first-hand contact 
with the Houthis, including journalists, relief workers, ROYG 
officials, and Houthi mediator and Haq party chief Hassan 
Zaid.  (Note: It is Post's policy not to communicate directly 
with the Houthis due to ROYG sensitivity.  End Note.) 
 
WHAT DO THEY WANT? 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Given the opacity of the Houthi rebels in the 
northern governorate of Sa'ada, as well as the government's 
misleading claims about the group's goals, it is difficult to 
answer the question, "What are the Houthis fighting for?" 
They are rhetorically anti-American, painting the slogan 
"Death to America" on buildings and boulders throughout 
Sa'ada governorate, but they have not targeted U.S. citizens 
or interests.  The Houthis are also anti-Israeli and 
anti-Semitic, and their threats against the Jewish community 
in Sa'ada (one of only two remaining Jewish communities in 
Yemen) caused the Jews to relocate to Sana'a in 2007. 
 
EVOLVING OBJECTIVES 
------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Houthis' objectives have evolved since the 
first Sa'ada war began in June 2004, when the Houthis were a 
small group of fighters defending a member of their family, 
MP Hussein al-Houthi, from arrest.  (Note: Hussein al-Houthi 
was reportedly one of 21 brothers, including current leaders 
Abdul-Malik and Yahya.  End Note.)  For almost three months 
Houthi and his supporters, who at that time claimed 
allegiance to the state, fought off government troops from 
his stronghold in the Marran Mountains, until he was killed 
on September 10, 2004.  In the years since, as the Houthis 
have gained supporters and territories, the group's 
objectives have expanded while becoming even murkier. 
According to the International Crisis Group, there is no 
evidence of a coherent ideology or political program: "Some 
groups fighting the government, though referred to as 
Houthis, appear motivated by multiple, mostly non-ideological 
factors having little in common with the leadership's 
proclaimed grievances."  These factors include 
disenfranchisement with the ROYG and the need to avenge the 
killings of family members or tribesmen unless blood money is 
paid. 
 
ROYG ACCUSATIONS ABOUT HOUTHI GOALS 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (S/NF) The ROYG accuses the Houthis of wanting to restore 
the clerical rule of the imamate overthrown in 1962 and 
 
impose draconian religious beliefs and practices on 
communities where they are in power.  Foreign Minister 
Abu-Bakr al-Qirbi said in an interview published in 
London-based Al-Sharq al-Awsat on September 12 that the 
Houthis "consider the current presidential system illegal and 
not in accordance with their creed."  Colonel Akram al-Qassmi 
of the National Security Bureau (NSB) told PolOffs on 
November 18 that re-establishing the imamate is not the 
Houthis' main priority now, but it is part of their ideology. 
 Instead, they are currently focusing on "standing up and 
strengthening" a Shi'a-dominated region along the 
Saudi-Yemeni border.  "With this deck of cards, the Houthis 
can abuse the Saudi and Yemeni governments," he said, much 
like Hizballah in Lebanon.  The ROYG )- along with many Arab 
governments in the region )- seeks to portray the Houthis as 
part of a regional, Iran-led Shi'ite conspiracy to expand 
influence and power at the expense of Sunni populations. 
 
¶6.  (S/NF) The Houthis deny such goals, however, and as a 
result, many of the Houthis' pronouncements are more about 
what they do not stand for than what they do. The Houthis 
proclaimed on their website, "The authority's accusations 
about the imamate are just a media war...  We are not asking 
for positions, we are asking for rights and justice.  The 
essence of the crisis is political."  In a letter delivered 
to President Saleh on November 22, Houthi spokesman Mohammed 
Abdulsalam attempted to correct the record, saying, "We hope 
that you do not (believe) the propaganda presented to you 
that we want to restore the imamate or that we have anything 
against the republican system."  He goes on to explain, "We 
do not want from you more than the right of equal 
citizenship."  In the letter, Abdulsalam attributed the 
misunderstanding and marginalization of the Houthis to "the 
persistence of the official media to deal with us as if we 
are from another planet." 
 
BASIC CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS OR BROADER AMBITIONS? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7.  (S/NF) Houthi mediator Hassan Zaid, a Zaydi Hashemite 
from a prominent Sana'a family and chair of the Haqq party, 
the legitimate political arm of the Zaydi movement, told 
PolOff on November 21 that the Houthis are fighting in 
self-defense and will stop as soon as the ROYG ceases to 
attack them.  He explained that the Houthis' political goal 
is to "benefit from the protection of the Constitution and 
the laws," including equal citizenship and freedom of 
expression and religion.  Mohammed al-Qadhi, correspondent 
for Dubai-based The National, however, told PolOff that the 
Houthis' goals may be broader than securing certain religious 
and political freedoms.  The Houthis' fight is "no longer 
about self-defense," he said.  "They may have their own 
political ambitions now."  He believes that their fight is 
partially motivated by outrage at the open secret that 
President Saleh is grooming his son Ahmed Ali for the 
presidency.  According to Qadhi, Saleh "keeps singing a song 
that offends them," referring to how the ROYG prides itself 
on having "toppled the hereditary rule of the imamate" but is 
"doing the same thing (hereditary rule) under the umbrella of 
the republic." 
 
¶8.  (C) Nabil al-Soufi of NewsYemen, who twice traveled 
secretly to Sa'ada governorate, told PolOff on November 18, 
"The Houthis have a political agenda, but the war they are 
waging lacks clear objectives."  He explained that the 
Houthis were dragged into the sixth war and have to keep 
fighting to defend themselves.  He believes their objective 
is to control Sa'ada governorate, not to spread Zaydi 
religious beliefs or to re-establish the imamate, although 
they use religious rhetoric to advance their political 
objectives.  U.S. academic Greg Johnsen, who has studied 
Yemeni politics for many years, has written, "Despite the 
religious rhetoric on all sides, the Houthis are primarily a 
group driven by the local politics of Sa'ada."  Chief among 
their complaints is the ROYG's "deliberate neglect" of the 
governorate and the traditional political elite's place 
within it.  The conflict also is believed to have originated 
as an inter-Zaydi battle of the social classes, as the 
Hashemite elite within the Zaydi sect felt excluded from 
their rightful place in government by Zaydis from lower 
social classes, such as Saleh. 
 
HOUTHIS' SPECIFIC DEMANDS 
------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (S/NF) The Houthis have presented President Saleh with a 
list of their conditions for "guaranteeing a final 
resolution" to the conflict (ref a).  In addition to 
releasing prisoners (including 18 members of the Houthi 
family who are in prison in Sana'a, according to Zaid), 
compensating civilians for looted property, and 
reconstructing war-damaged infrastructure, the Houthis demand 
the "normalization" and "demilitarization" of life in 
Sa,ada" through the following steps:  1) the army's 
withdrawal from villages and farms in order to demilitarize 
public and private properties in Sa,ada; 2) genuine economic 
development and delivery of basic services; 3) end cultural 
and political discrimination against the Zaydi population; 
and 4) allow civil servants to return to their jobs and give 
them back-pay for the time they were separated from their 
posts.  According to NDI Deputy Director Murad Zafir, the 
Houthis are also seeking to establish a university for Zaydi 
jurisprudence, as various universities for Sunni 
jurisprudence already exist in Yemen. 
 
WAR WITH RELIGIOUS ROOTS OR RELIGIOUS WAR? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶10.  (SBU) One of the deepest root causes of the conflict in 
Sa'ada is religious.  Over the past 20 years, Zaydis -) who 
have historically made up the majority of the governorate's 
population )- have felt increasingly threatened by the 
radical Sunni Salafism exported from Saudi Arabia (ref b). 
"Sa'ada is so Shi'a that even the stone is Shi'a," Abdulkader 
al-Hillal, former head of the Sa'ada Mediation Committee, 
told the Ambassador, quoting a Yemeni poet.  However, 
Sa'ada's unique Zaydi identity has been challenged by the 
establishment of Salafi schools and mosques in the 
governorate, and local residents founded a Zaydi revivalist 
group called the Believing Youth to teach young people about 
their Zaydi religion and history.  A branch of the Believing 
Youth later produced the more extreme Houthi ideology and 
organization.  NDI's Zafir told PolOff on November 21 that 
the Houthis are fighting to preserve their unique identity, 
religious beliefs and practices by seeking to establish their 
own schools and university. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶11.  (C) Contrary to the ROYG's claims, the Houthis do not 
appear to be fighting to restore clerical rule.  It is more 
likely that they are, as they claim, seeking greater local 
autonomy and respect for their religious beliefs and 
practices.  Understanding the Houthis' objectives can help 
shape a political solution to this complex conflict.  Yet 
even if such a settlement takes the Houthi leadership's 
grievances into account, the fighting will not end unless 
steps are taken to address the additional factors )- such as 
tribal vendettas -- that have motivated other individuals and 
tribes to join the Houthis' struggle despite not sharing 
their ideology.  END COMMENT.
