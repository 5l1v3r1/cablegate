¶1.  (C) On September 15, in a pull aside during local 
national day celebrations, DCM Brennan raised the Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia meeting idea with President Oscar Arias and 
FM Bruno Stagno as directed per Ref A.  Because of the 
setting, the conversation was brief and general.  Arias and 
Stagno supported the idea of an informal meeting, in 
principle. 
 
¶2.  (C) On September 16, Pol-Econ/Counselor followed up with 
Stagno,s COS, Antonio Alarcon, who echoed his minister,s 
and president,s views.  &Of course8  Costa Rica would 
support an informal (Arria-format) meeting, he said.  The 
GOCR remained in favor of &hearing all sides8 on the 
Georgia issue.  Alarcon could not say, however, whether or 
not the GOCR would actually vote against any official UNSC 
sessions to discuss the Georgia issue that include reps from 
the two break-away areas.  He agreed that Russia would 
certainly favor/push for official Abkhazia and South Ossetia 
inclusion in official sessions, but said he would have to 
check with Stagno before responding to us on the GOCR,s 
position. 
 
¶3.  (C) After conferring with FM Stagno, Alarcon confirmed on 
September 17 that Costa Rica strongly favors an informal 
&Arria8 style meeting on this issue so that all sides can 
be heard, and that Costa Rica would vote against any official 
UNSC meeting on Georgia that included representatives from 
the the breakaway areas.   Alarcon stressed that &we share 
your (USG) views on this,8 and he reiterated that position 
in a follow-up conversation with Pol-Econ Counselor on 
September 22 (based on Ref B).
