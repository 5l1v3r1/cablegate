¶1.  (C) Summary:  During a positive March 13 meeting with 
Defense Minister Sandoval, the Ambassador emphasized that we 
value our relationships with both Colombia and Ecuador and 
want to continue supporting GOE efforts on the Northern 
Border.  Sandoval recognized how inadequate his resources 
were to the task of controlling the border and welcomed 
continued USG cooperation.  He felt the Colombian military 
had betrayed him, and called Chavez' actions unhelpful.  The 
Ambassador sought to put to rest allegations of Manta FOL 
involvement and pressed for rapid conclusion of an exchange 
of diplomatic notes providing protections to temporary U.S. 
military personnel.  (End Summary) 
 
¶2.  (C) The Ambassador met March 13 with Defense Minister 
Wellington Sandoval; Under Secretary of Defense General Pena 
also participated.  Sandoval appeared grateful that the 
Ambassador requested the meeting.  The Ambassador underscored 
that the United States valued its relationships with both 
Colombia and Ecuador and that our support for Colombia did 
not mean we were against Ecuador.  Sandoval made clear that 
he felt personally betrayed by Colombia,s failure to give 
any notice of the impending incursion, citing good 
operational contacts with the Colombian military, who had 
often shared information that the Ecuadorian military acted 
on.  Sandoval volunteered that he knew Venezuelan President 
Chavez' support had been unhelpful to Ecuador's cause. 
 
¶3.  (C) The Ambassador highlighted U.S. interest in 
continuing to work with Ecuador in the Northern Border area. 
Sandoval acknowledged how strapped the Ecuadorian military 
was and that it could not control the border with what it 
had.  He cited the fact that, although the press reported 
major Ecuadorian troop movements, in fact the military had 
only one functioning helicopter that made ten trips to the 
border with 18 passengers each time.  Sandoval hoped the 
Ecuadorian military would now receive more government 
resources.  He noted that even if the radar had been on, it 
would not have detected the Colombian aircraft since they 
were flying very low.  Sandoval stated that it would take an 
enormous amount of resources to control the border 
effectively.  The Ambassador pointed out that a scape-goating 
witchhunt against Ecuadorian military leaders would not be 
productive; Sandoval agreed.  (Comment: We fear that pro-U.S. 
officers might be the victims of such an action.) 
 
¶4.  (C) The Ambassador raised the pending diplomatic note, 
which would provide protections for short-term visits by U.S. 
military personnel and allow suspended training and exercises 
to resume. These programs can help strengthen the capacity of 
Ecuador,s military to meet its Northern Border challenges. 
She explained that Fuerzas Comando (a large multilateral 
special forces exercise which Ecuador will host in June) 
would have to be called off soon if the exchange of 
diplomatic notes were not finalized.  That would mean the 
loss of an excellent opportunity to begin to rebuild regional 
trust and goodwill.  Sandoval promised to speak to the 
Foreign Minister on the subject the next day. 
 
¶5.  (C) The Ambassador offered assurances that the U.S. 
Forward Operating Location (FOL) in Manta had no role in the 
Colombian military operation, stressing that its assistance 
would not have been needed since Colombia had the capability 
to achieve this operation with its own Embraer Super Tucanos. 
Sandoval said he was now aware of that fact, although there 
had been some earlier confusion.
