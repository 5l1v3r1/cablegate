¶1. (C) We delivered the demarche points from Ref A-C messages 
to Leena Alto, deputy European Correspondent in the Finnish 
MFA, and to Jonna Partanen, Counselor in the Secretariat for 
EU Affairs in the office of PM Vanhanen.  Alto and Partanen 
briefed us on the positions FM Tuomioja will be taking to the 
GAERC meeting, as follows. 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
¶2. (U) Alto said the GoF agrees that the January elections 
are extremely important -- as is the political process that 
precedes them.  The Iraqi people deserve free and fair 
elections, and Finland has contributed to the International 
Reconstruction Fund Facility to help make that a reality. 
Alto added that Finland offers its firm support -- both 
nationally and through the EU -- to PM Allawi in the IIG's 
efforts to establish the institutions of civil society in 
Iraq. 
 
¶3. (C) Insofar as assistance to the Iraqi police is 
concerned, Finland (as Washington is aware) already 
contributes ten instructors to the academy in Jordan.  Alto 
said the GoF is willing to consider a joint EU project -- but 
anything the EU does in Iraq "must be carefully considered in 
light of the serious security situation that now exists." 
 
Sudan 
----- 
 
¶4. (C) Alto said, "We are on the same wavelength, very much 
so."  The GoF welcomes the resumption of the Abuja talks, and 
agrees the international community should keep up the 
pressure on both sides to reach an agreement.  At the same 
time, efforts must continue to find a solution to the 
humanitarian crisis on the ground.  The Finns "recognize the 
African ownership of the process," she said, and support AU 
efforts in Darfur.  Alto nevertheless noted there has been 
some talk of an EU police mission.  The GoF feels there needs 
to be more clarity regarding the modalities of such a 
mission.  If that needed clarity is supplied, she said, "we 
would consider positively" the idea of participating in a 
"well-planned police mission" in Darfur. 
 
Russia 
------ 
 
¶5. (C) Alto noted that the agenda for the upcoming EU-Russia 
Summit includes further negotiation on the four common 
spaces.  It seems unlikely to the Finns that all four can be 
completed at the Summit.  Finland strongly believes that 
nothing should be agreed until everything is agreed, even if 
that means that the four spaces all must be held over for 
further negotiation later.  Alto said the Finns will resist 
any suggestion that Russia and the European Union agree what 
they can now and defer the rest for later: doing so would 
allow the Russians to "pick and choose what they want" from 
the document. 
 
¶6. (C) She reiterated a complaint we have heard from the 
Finns before (e.g., Ref D): that the EU has no real unity 
regarding relations with Russia.  When the going gets tough, 
a few individual members break away to pursue their own 
bilateral relationships with Russia for their own national 
reasons.  At every EU meeting Finland (which still has the 
Union's longest border with Russia) stresses the need for 
unity on this matter.  "The EU is the main vehicle for 
conduct of relations with Russia," said Alto, "and we want to 
keep it that way." 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶7. (C) Alto said the Finns fully agree on the importance of 
the November 25-26 IAEA Board of Governors meeting.  They 
support unified U.S./EU pressure on the Iranians to suspend 
all enrichment-related activity. 
 
Middle East Peace Process 
------------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) The GoF welcomes PM Sharon's plan for withdrawal from 
Gaza, said Alto.  She added that the Finns consider the 
planned Palestinian elections a necessary test case for PA 
willingness to engage in democratic reforms.  Finland 
understands it is likely the EU will offer its help in 
organizing the elections, and the GoF supports such an offer.
