It now moves to the Shura Council, and once approved by the Shura, the King must ratify the law for it to enter into force. The version of the law passed by the lower house is the same version drafted by the government for which the Embassy and G/TIP had advocated passage early this year.
</p><p>2.(C) G/TIP Ambassador Lagon told the GOB Anti-Trafficking Task Force during his September 23 visit that the GOB needed to enact comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation, show evidence it was prosecuting traffickers, and become more pro-active on victim identification. By doing these three things the GOB could demonstrate its commitment to combating trafficking and make a strong case for improving its Tier III ranking.
</p><p>3.(C) Comment: The law has cleared its most significant hurdle and is unlikely to encounter serious opposition in the government-appointed Shura Council. Because the government's draft of the anti-trafficking law passed the lower house without amendment, we anticipate that the Shura Council will act quickly to approve it and send it on to the King for ratification. Post continues to impress upon GOB officials that, while a step in the right direction, enacting the anti-trafficking law will not be enough alter Bahrain's Tier III ranking; they must show progress on prosecutions and victim identification as well. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI</p>
