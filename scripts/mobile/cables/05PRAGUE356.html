<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>Â¶1. (C) Poloff was shown March 10 the request for an export license filed by the Czech firm that is working to provide an initial shipment of 23 Russian-made sea-skimming missiles (KH-31) to the US Navy. The application showed the name and address of the firm in Minsk that was supplying the missiles, but contained no other information about the role Belarus plays in this transaction. After issuing a preliminary opinion in favor of the transaction, partly in the belief that the U.S. supported the purchase, the Czechs are now putting the license application on hold while they gather more information and reconsider. The Czech government has been very critical of the Lukashenko regime, and some in the MFA, particularly those responsible for the promotion of human rights and democracy, have voiced objection to the deal. The matter has now been passed to XXXXXXXXXXXX, who will make the final decision, possibly over the next couple of weeks. Please provide the U.S. Government position on the proposed purchase.
