¶1.  (S/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS APPRECIATE POST'S EFFORTS TO 
PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO COLOMBIAN AND FARC MILITARY AND SECURITY 
ISSUES. MANY OF THE REPORTS RECEIVED HAVE BEEN USED IN 
ANALYTICAL PIECES AND HAVE HELPED TO FURTHER ANALYSTS' AND 
POLICYMAKERS' UNDERSTANDING OF KEY MILITARY AND SECURITY 
ISSUES IN COLOMBIA.  AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT, ANALYSTS 
WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE FURTHER REPORTING ON COLOMBIAN 
MILITARY PLANS AND PRECEPTS. 
 
¶A.  (S/NF)  HOW IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND 
ISRAEL?  IS COLOMBIA SEEKING ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE (MATERIEL 
AND TRAINING) FROM ISRAEL?  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF COLOMBIAN 
WEAPONS PROCUREMENTS FROM ISRAEL? IS COLOMBIA REACHING OUT TO 
ANY OTHER COUNTRIES FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE?  IF SO, WHICH 
COUNTRIES AND WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING TO GAIN FROM THEM?  AT 
WHAT PRICE MIGHT THIS ASSISTANCE COME? 
 
¶B.  (S/NF)  WHAT PROGRESS HAS COLOMBIA MADE REGARDING HUMAN 
RIGHTS?  HOW HAVE THE RECENT NEW HUMAN RIGHTS INITIATIVES 
BEEN RECEIVED BY THE RANK AND FILE CADRE?  DOES THE MILITARY 
FEEL WARY ABOUT CONDUCTING OPERATIONS FOR FEAR THEY WILL BE 
BROUGHT UP ON HUMAN RIGHTS CHARGES?  HOW ARE THEY 
COMPENSATING FOR THAT? WHAT SPECIFIC ACTIONS IS THE COLOMBIAN 
GOVERNMENT TAKING TO ROOT OUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE?  ARE THERE 
SPECIFIC SENIOR OFFICERS WHO ARE PERCEIVED AS RESISTING OR 
ASSISTING THESE EFFORTS?  HAVE EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS 
INCREASED OR DECREASED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE SOACHA 
SCANDAL?  ARE THERE NEW MANIFESTATIONS OF EJES BEYOND "FALSE 
POSITIVES," SUCH AS ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES? 
 
¶C.  (S/NF)  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF ARMY COMMADER GONZALEZ? 
WHAT IS HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH URIBE, MINISTER OF DEFENSE 
SANTOS, AND OTHER SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIALS?  HOW IS HE 
PERCEIVED BY THE RANK AND FILE?  HOW LONG DOES HE EXPECT TO 
HAVE HIS POSITION?  ARE THERE ANY CANDIDATES SLOTTED TO 
REPLACE HIM?  ARE THERE PLANS IN THE WORKS TO ORCHESTRATE HIS 
OUSTER? HOW MUCH LONGER DOES DEFENSE MINISTER SANTOS PLAN TO 
STAY IN OFFICE?  WHO IS URIBE LIKELY TO CHOOSE AS SANTOS' 
SUCCESSOR?  DOES SANTOS HAVE A PREFERRED SUCCESSOR?  IF SO, 
WHO AND WHY?  DO THE VICE MINISTERS OF DEFENSE PLAN TO STAY 
ON AFTER SANTOS LEAVES?  IF NOT WHY, AND WHAT ARE THEIR 
FUTURE PLANS? WHAT WOULD URIBE'S LIKELY REACTION BE TO 
EXTERNAL PRESSURE TO REPLACE GONZALEZ PENA? HOW WILL THE 
DEPARTURE OF MINISTER SANTOS IMPACT THE MINISTRY'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS PERFORMANCE? 
 
¶2.  (U)  PLEASE CITE C-AL9-00777 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
