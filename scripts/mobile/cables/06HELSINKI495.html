¶1. (C) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Laura 
Kansikas-Debraise, MFA Director for the Unit on Arms Control. 
 Kansikas-Debraise was unfamiliar with the Finnish company 
Mastsystem International which, as yet, has made no 
application for an export license to sell any communication 
or other equipment to the Government of Syria.  She noted, 
however, that the telescopic masts in question clearly have 
dual uses and that the GOF would view any such license 
request very skeptically.  Because Mastsystem has not yet 
applied, Debraise could not yet confirm with certainty that 
the GOF would deny its request.  However, she noted that MFA 
practice is to deny any remotely questionable sale to Syria. 
 
¶2. (C) Kansikas-Debraise promised to inform us promptly 
should Mastsystem make an application.
