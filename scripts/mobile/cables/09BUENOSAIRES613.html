¶1. (U) The Argentine presidency released to the press the 
text of President Obama's national day message for the May 25 
holiday (ref A), and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
(CFK) said ""it is something more than a gesture of greeting 
for all Argentines.  The text speaks of democracies that 
defend human rights, that we should deepen the bilateral 
relationship and forge new joint initiatives in the field of 
justice and social inclusion.  It identifies itself with what 
we have put forward and which (President Obama) himself put 
forward in his campaign and his administration."" 
 
¶2.  (C) CFK also characterized the letter as ""a gesture, just 
like it's a crystal-clear gesture (that the USG reportedly 
intends to nominate) the first woman Ambassador of the United 
States in Argentina and that she's someone with such a high 
profile...That's the only way to read it, and it's very 
promising.""  (CFK was referring to Ms. Vilma Martinez, the 
heretofore unofficial nominee as the next U.S. Ambassador to 
Argentina, whose name was leaked to the Argentine press by 
the GOA hours after it received an agrement request from the 
USG.) 
 
¶3. (U) Under the headline ""Obama sent a letter full of praise 
to the President and asked for more cooperation,"" daily 
newspaper of record ""La Nacion"" ran a subhead saying ""The 
president of the United States praised the role of the 
country as a defender of human rights.""  In the article, ""La 
Nacion"" quoted an unnamed adviser to FM Taiana who said, ""It 
is a letter of appreciation, not a mere formality.  It puts 
the spotlight on Argentina's role on the world stage, and on 
its role in the G-20.  It speaks of its influence in the 
region and beyond."" 
 
¶4. (SBU) Largest circulation daily ""Clarin"" also gave the 
message prominent coverage under the headline ""Obama's letter 
to Cristina: he praised the Argentine 'efforts.'""  Clarin 
published a facsimile of the text of the letter and quoted 
extensively from it throughout the article, claiming that 
""Obama's message holds out another bridge with the President 
while a meeting between the two continues to go unscheduled, 
at a time when Chilean President Michelle Bachelet was just 
invited to Washington.  But in Washington, Cristina's 
spirited defense of Obama did not go unnoticed last Friday 
when Hugo Chavez cast doubts (ref B) on the possibility of a 
positive change in U.S. policy toward the region with 
(President Obama's) arrival in power."" 
 
¶5. (C) Comment:  Argentine Obamamania seems to have prompted 
CFK to react euphorically to a routine, albeit warm and 
gracious, national day message.  The media, including outlets 
not normally disposed to support CFK, seems to have accepted 
her interpretation that the letter is an exceptional White 
House overture to Argentina.  Argentines have once again made 
a mountain out of a molehill -- but this time, happily, in 
our favor.  We take it as a sign that CFK and many other 
Argentines are anxiously looking for signs of President 
Obama's favor.
