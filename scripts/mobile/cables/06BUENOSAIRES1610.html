</p><p>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: On July 5, the DCM paid a farewell call on 
</p><p>Secretary General of the Presidency (President Nestor 
</p><p> 
</p><p>SIPDIS 
</p><p>Kirchner's chief of staff) Oscar Parrilli that included a 
</p><p>frank discussion on GOA policy in the region.  Attempting to 
</p><p>clarify Kirchner's recent comments about the U.S. in Madrid, 
</p><p>Parrilli said that Argentina valued U.S. support during the 
</p><p>crisis and that Kirchner wanted a ""mature"" relationship with 
</p><p>the United States.  Parrilli's comments reflected the view 
</p><p>that the GOA accepts the idea of the U.S. leadership in the 
</p><p>region, as long as it also benefits Argentina.  The DCM 
</p><p>raised the issue of Venezuela, stating that Kirchner's close 
</p><p>relationship with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and 
</p><p>Chavez's threats against democracy, as well as his penchant 
</p><p>for slandering President Bush and the USG made it difficult 
</p><p>for the Embassy to maintain constructive bilateral relations 
</p><p>with the GOA.  Parrilli responded by saying the GOA's 
</p><p>relationship with the GOV was based primarily on economics 
</p><p>and Mercosur.  The DCM next turned the discussion to Bolivia, 
</p><p>expressing the U.S. concern that Bolivian President Evo 
</p><p>Morales needs to respect Bolivia's constitutional democracy 
</p><p>and cooperate with the U.S. and regional neighbors to control 
</p><p>narcotrafficking.  Parrilli said that the GOA shares the U.S. 
</p><p>goal of ensuring President Evo Morales operates within a 
</p><p>democratic framework and said that the two nations should be 
</p><p>very clear with Morales on counternarcotics.  On the whole 
</p><p>question of hemispheric free trade, the DCM noted the U.S. 
</p><p>view that the Summit of the Americas was a success in the 
</p><p>sense that a majority of the region -- 29 countries -- said 
</p><p>that they wanted to continue discussions about creating an 
</p><p>FTAA.  END SUMMARY. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (C) On July 5, the DCM paid a farewell call on Secretary 
</p><p>General of the Presidency Oscar Parrilli that included a 
</p><p>frank discussion on GOA policy in the region.  Oscar 
</p><p>Parrilli, President Nestor Kirchner's chief of staff, is a 
</p><p>key Kirchner insider (See Reftel).  Parrilli has been a good 
</p><p>contact of the Embassy and is known for his calm disposition, 
</p><p>although he clearly shares the world view of the rest of 
</p><p>Kirchner's inner circle.  Parrilli began the discussion by 
</p><p>remarking on the good personal relations the Casa Rosada has 
</p><p>enjoyed over the past three years with the Ambassador and 
</p><p>DCM.  The DCM highlighted the strong background of incoming 
</p><p>Ambassador Wayne and corrected the misperception expressed by 
</p><p>some members of the GOA that Ambassador Wayne had praised 
</p><p>former President Carlos Menem during his recent confirmation 
</p><p>hearings. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (C) Attempting to clarify Kirchner's recent comments 
</p><p>about the U.S. in Madrid, Parrilli said that Argentina valued 
</p><p>U.S. support during the crisis and that Kirchner wanted a 
</p><p>""mature"" relationship with the United States.  ""President 
</p><p>Kirchner has acknowledged this publicly in the past.  Despite 
</p><p>our differences, the U.S. has come to Argentina's aid when 
</p><p>Argentina really needed it.""  Parrilli said that Argentina, 
</p><p>in turn, can help ensure ""tranquillity"" in the region.  He 
</p><p>said that at times in the past, the U.S. has not played the 
</p><p>leadership role necessary in the region.  Parrilli said that 
</p><p>Kirchner was referring to this ""historic debt"" of the U.S. in 
</p><p>the region, not necessarily about current U.S. policy.  ""What 
</p><p>Kirchner wants is a 'mature' relationship with the U.S."" 
</p><p>Parrilli further commented that ""what crashed in 2001 was not 
</p><p>the de la Rua government, but an economic model.  The model 
</p><p>of having your economy owned by foreign interests.  Countries 
</p><p>need to be able to defend their rights, their economy."" 
</p><p>(COMMENT: Parrilli's comments reflect the GOA view that they 
</p><p>acknowledge and accept the idea of the U.S. as the natural 
</p><p>leader of the region, but they want that leadership to act in 
</p><p>Argentina's and the region's interests.  In particular, he 
</p><p>mentioned that the GOA would like to see more U.S. economic 
</p><p>assistance to the region.  END COMMENT.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4.  (C) The DCM raised the issue of Venezuela, stating that 
</p><p>Kirchner's close relationship with Venezuelan President Hugo 
</p><p> 
</p><p>BUENOS AIR 00001610  002 OF 003 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Chavez and Chavez's threats against democracy, as well as his 
</p><p>penchant for slandering President Bush and the USG made it 
</p><p>difficult for the Embassy to maintain constructive bilateral 
</p><p>relations with the GOA.  The DCM said, ""One day Kirchner is 
</p><p>meeting with Chavez, and Chavez may be on good behavior 
</p><p>because Kirchner has asked Chavez to avoid incidents, but the 
</p><p>next day Chavez is calling President Bush a drunkard, a 
</p><p>genocidal maniac and worse than Hitler.""  The DCM said that 
</p><p>by so closely associating himself with a leader like Chavez, 
</p><p>Kirchner risks being viewed by Washington as sharing Chavez's 
</p><p>views. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5.  (C) Parrilli responded by saying that the GOA's 
</p><p>relationship with the GOV was based primarily on economics 
</p><p>and Mercosur.  Parrilli also said that the GOA does not agree 
</p><p>""with the message or the style of Chavez's attacks on 
</p><p>President Bush or the U.S.""  Parrilli added, ""Our 
</p><p>relationship with Venezuela is not an axis.  Argentina and 
</p><p>Brazil are the two main drivers of regional integration in 
</p><p>South America.  We need to include the other big countries in 
</p><p>the region -- Venezuela, Colombia, and Chile -- in this 
</p><p>process."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6.  (C) The DCM next turned the discussion to Bolivia, 
</p><p>expressing the U.S. concern that Bolivian President Evo 
</p><p>Morales needs to respect Bolivia's constitutional democracy 
</p><p>and cooperate with the U.S. and regional neighbors to control 
</p><p>narcotrafficking.  Parrilli said that the GOA shares the U.S. 
</p><p>goal of ensuring President Evo Morales operates within a 
</p><p>democratic framework.  Parrilli said that Morales is 
</p><p>defending and respecting the rights of the mainly indigenous 
</p><p>voters that elected him, who have been excluded from the 
</p><p>Bolivian political system until now.  Parrilli added that ""we 
</p><p>have to hope that Morales is successful.""  The DCM noted the 
</p><p>concern that the recent increase in Bolivian coca production 
</p><p>will lead to an increase in cocaine trafficking.  Parrilli 
</p><p>agreed that the two nations should be very clear with Morales 
</p><p>on counternarcotics. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7.  (C) On the whole question of hemispheric free trade, the 
</p><p>DCM noted the U.S. view that the Summit of the Americas was a 
</p><p>success in the sense that a majority of the region -- 29 
</p><p>countries -- said that they wanted to continue discussions 
</p><p>about creating an FTAA.  The DCM said that the Mercosur 
</p><p>objections to the FTAA over agricultural issues at least 
</p><p>leaves room for discussion, while Venezuela was the only 
</p><p>country in the region to object to the FTAA on ideological 
</p><p>grounds.  Parrilli responded by saying, ""In the past what you 
</p><p>were offering us in terms of free trade deals was not what 
</p><p>Argentina needed.""  The DCM pointed to the benefits of free 
</p><p>trade and noted that NAFTA is no longer an issue for the left 
</p><p>or the right in both Canada and Mexico.  ""NAFTA has been a 
</p><p>win-win for all countries involved."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p>COMMENT 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8.  (C) Oscar Parrilli shares the leftist world view of most 
</p><p>of Kirchner's inner circle, but like other Casa Rosada 
</p><p>insiders, always appears friendly and cooperative in private 
</p><p>to Embassy officials.  Parrilli clearly received the official 
</p><p>talking points on how to respond to questions about 
</p><p>Kirchner's recent statements on the U.S. in Madrid and on GOA 
</p><p>relations with Venezuela, as we have heard Parrilli's 
</p><p>comments on these two issues repeated on several recent 
</p><p>occasions by high-level GOA officials.  This continues a long 
</p><p>pattern in the Kirchner administration where GOA officials 
</p><p>tell us what they think we want to hear in private, while 
</p><p>Kirchner's actions and public statements project a different 
</p><p>image to the rest of the world. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9.  (C) Although Kirchner's inner circle may not diverge fromthe official line, engaging them is beneficial.  Messages 
</p><p>given to them are immediately conveyed to President Kirchner, 
</p><p>and Kirchner uses them to deliver his message to the USG. 
</p><p>With President Kirchner often inaccessible and relying on an 
</p><p> 
</p><p>BUENOS AIR 00001610  003 OF 003 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>ever-shrinking group of close advisors, engaging Kirchner's 
</p><p>inner circle is often the best way to maintain a dialogue 
</p><p>with the GOA.  We believe it would be far worse for U.S. 
</p><p>interests to discontinue dialogue with some of the only 
</p><p>people that can still influence Kirchner.  END COMMENT.
