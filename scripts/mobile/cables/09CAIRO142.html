(C) The wife of imprisoned Al Ghad Party leader Ayman Nour passed to us a handwritten letter from Nour to President Obama. An unofficial Embassy translation of the letter follows: Dr. Ayman Nour From Torah Al Mazra'ah Prison South Cairo January 22, 2009 Dear Mr. President Barack Obama, With my appreciation and friendship, I am honored to join, from my prison, the millions of those congratulating you for your inauguration in this worldwide wedding of Freedom, of which I breathed some of its breezes, through these historic moments, as my imprisonment did not prevent me from following the event that impacts this world which is restless from longing for change. In my second message to you, I would like to thank you for your kind gesture of pointing out my first message on your electoral website on the worldwide web. And also, to referencing my case on that same website, in the document titled, "Strengthening Our Common Security By Investing In Our Common Humanity." Mr. President, your election was, and still is, a source of great inspiration for nations that believe in their sacred right to justice, equality, freedom and deliverance from oppression, desperation, poverty and colonialism, in all its forms. Your Excellency, at a time when the world still suffers from massacres and prisons, detention camps and torture, all of which inject peoples with desperation and extremism, due to these problems remaining unresolved, your voice has brought hope to the hearts of many around the world, in a fresh start for new relations among peace and freedom-loving peoples and nations. Your Excellency, we have every confidence that a new spirit of trust, openness and communication will allow you to surpass all the difficult hopes and surmount chronic obstacles for a new world that your Excellency represents the first sign of its coming and much-awaited dawn. Therefore, we wish you and your small family and free nation success and God's blessings to tread the right path. We also pray for you as a young man who dared to dream and dared to fulfill his dream, which has opened the closed doors of dreams in all parts of the earth. My prayers, Faithfully, Dr. Ayman Nour SCOBEY</h3><p><pre>09CAIRO142
