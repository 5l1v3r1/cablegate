¶1.  (S/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS AT THE NATIONAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER (NCTC) GREATLY APPRECIATED EMBASSY 
REPORTING WHICH WAS USED IN A PDB, AN NTB AND A SETR (SENIOR 
EXECUTIVE TERRORISM REPORT).  THERE WAS GOOD FEEDBACK ON THE 
PIECE WITH THE DEPUTY SECRETARY, DHS, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
AND DIRECTOR, FBI READING THE PIECE AND TAKING THE MAIN 
POINTS ONBOARD.  THE DIRECTOR, NCTC BRIEFED THE PIECE IN THE 
OVAL OFFICE, AND THERE WAS A QUICK DISCUSSION OF HOW 
AL-QA'IDA TACTICS HAVE CHANGED IN THE PAST AFTER PUBLIC 
DISCLOSURES.  THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE FOUND THE PIECE 
VERY USEFUL AND TIMELY AS HE WAS MEETING WITH HIS BELGIAN 
COUNTERPARTS THE DAY THE PUBLICATION WAS RELEASED.  CONTINUED 
REPORTING WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  MANY THANKS, AND 
REGARDS FROM WASHINGTON.
