¶1. (U) On March 15 we met with Finnish MFA Acting European 
Correspondent Leena Aalto to review issues on the agenda for 
the March 16 GAERC, and to reinforce USG concern over the 
future of the EU's China arms embargo.  Following are Finnish 
views, by subject: 
 
¶2. (C) Croatia: Aalto said that "frantic diplomacy is still 
going on" today, as del Ponte talks to the presidency and 
COREPER discusses what steps to take.  Aalto assured us that 
the Finns agree with the U.S.: no date for accession talks 
should be set until/unless Croatia lives up to its obligation 
to cooperate fully with the ICTY.  She noted that on March 
11, Finland's Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security 
Policy (which includes President Halonen as well as PM 
Vanhanen and the cabinet) issued the following statement: 
 
"... One of the main issues to be discussed (at the GAERC) 
regards Croatia's decision on the handover of the indicted 
general, Ante Gotovina, to the Hague.  Finland is of the 
opinion that Croatia's full cooperation with the Tribunal is 
prerequisite for the opening of the negotiations on 17 March 
¶2005.  Finland also considers it important that the EU 
consistently adhere to the jointly adopted policy regarding 
cooperation with the Tribunal and that the EU assess 
Croatia's cooperation on the basis of the Tribunal's 
statement." 
 
¶3. (C) China arms embargo: As Washington is aware, the GoF 
believes that the Code of Conduct would be a better 
instrument for controlling the kinds of dual-use technologies 
the Chinese are most apt to want, if the Code were 
strengthened and made legally binding -- and that the current 
move to lift the embargo offers an opportunity to win those 
changes to the Code.  We asked Aalto whether that view still 
holds, give the Chinese legislature's passage of a law 
authorizing use of force against a future Taiwanese 
declaration of independence.  We also pointed out (again) 
that opposition to lifting the embargo comes not just from 
the United States but also from Japan and other nations in 
China's East Asian region. 
 
¶4. (C) Aalto said that the President's strong presentation on 
this issue during the February 22 meetings in Brussels made 
clear how important this matter is to the United States.  The 
question is on the agenda for next week's meeting of the 
European Council; in the meantime, the PSC has been 
discussing how to provide more information to, and organize 
more contacts with, the United States and Japan on the 
matter.  There is still a common understanding that the EU 
wants to brings this issue to a conclusion during the 
Luxembourg presidency, said Aalto, but the EU is not yet 
ready to do that. 
 
¶5. (C) Middle East/Lebanon/Hizballah: Aalto said that Finland 
strongly favors Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, and that the 
GAERC will call for implementation of UNSCR 1559.  The GoF's 
position on Hizballah has not changed, however, and it comes 
directly from FM Erkki Tuomioja.  Tuomioja believes that 
Hizballah's MPs still have a role to play in Lebanon's 
national reunification process, and that listing Hizballah as 
a terrorist organization at this juncture could make that 
process more difficult.  The Finns are following the 
situation carefully, said Aalto, and are aware that the 
positions of some EU nations are shifting toward listing, but 
"Finland will be among the last to change its view." 
 
¶6. (C) UNCHR: Septel will describe in more detail GoF views 
on the Commission's annual session.  Aalto did say the Finns 
were disappointed that the UNCHR will not consider a 
resolution on the human rights situation in Chechnya.  In any 
case, the GoF plans to take up this subject with the Russians 
in bilateral meetings, and it is sure to be part of the 
EU/Russian dialogue on human rights. 
 
¶7. (C) EU/Russia: Aalto said that as preparations for the 
April 1 Foreign Ministers' meeting and the May 10 summit go 
forward, the GoF continues to believe that all four common 
spaces must be adopted as a single package.  She added that 
the Finns are dissatisfied with the pace of negotiations, and 
hope the Commission will accelerate its efforts to achieve 
agreement on all four in time for the summit. 
 
¶8. (C) Russia/Moldova: Aalto expressed general agreement with 
U.S. views, and said that the Finns assume the new EU Special 
Representative -- whose mandate is due to begin April 1 -- 
will be included as an observer in the five-sided talks. 
 
¶9. (C) Russia/Georgia: Aalto noted that an options paper on 
an EU Border Monitoring Operation has been circulated, but 
that "it didn't gain outright support."  Asked why not, she 
said, "It had a lot to do with figuring out an exit 
strategy."  She said that the GoF is flexible on this matter; 
the Finns are ready now to help augment the team of EU 
Special Representative Talvitie, and "ready to look at other 
options too."
