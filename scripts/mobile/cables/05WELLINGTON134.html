¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The nascent Maori Party's impact on New 
Zealand politics (reftel) continues to be felt -- to the 
increasing discomfort of the ruling Labour party, and has 
raised doubts about Labour's historical alliance with an 
influential Maori organization, the Ratana Church.  Some 
Ratana followers are questioning the historical Ratana 
Church-Labour Party alliance, putting them at odds with the 
Church's leader, Harerangi Meihana, a staunch Labour 
supporter whose son is to stand as a Labour Party candidate. 
In addition, the administrator of a second Ratana center, Te 
Omeka Marae Trust Chairman Ron Smith, has challenged 
Meihana's position, accusing him of politicizing the Church 
to the detriment of its membership and credibility.  The 
divisions in this important Maori institution reflect the 
rise of an increasingly credible Maori political alternative 
to Labour.  End Summary. 
 
Decades-Old Alliance 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Maori Party's impact on New Zealand politics 
continues to be felt -- to the increasing discomfort of the 
ruling Labour party.  Recently, some members of the Ratana 
Church, an influential Maori organization, have been 
re-evaluating their Church's historical alliance with the 
Labour party.  The Church has helped ensure Labour's almost 
unbroken hold on Maori-designated parliamentary seats.  The 
alliance of mutual support between Ratana and Labour was 
forged in April 1936 between the Church's charismatic 
founder, T.W. Ratana, and then-Labour Prime Minister Joseph 
Savage.  Since 1936, Labour has lost the Maori-designated 
seats only twice:  in 1993 and 1996 when the New Zealand 
First party -- led by Maori Winston Peters -- captured the 
Maori vote.  Labour regained the seats in 1999, but the 
emergence of the Maori Party in July 2004, a reaction to 
Labour's controversial seabed and foreshore legislation, has 
spurred some members of the Church to call for a re-think of 
its allegiance to 
Labour. 
 
All in the Family 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  (U)  The political importance of the Ratana Church has 
ensured PM Helen Clark's regular attendance (twelve years 
running) at the annual January celebration honoring T.W. 
Ratana's birthday.  In 2002, the opposition National Party 
also started to show up for the first time.  With media 
speculating on Maori Party inroads on Labour's "safe" Maori 
seats, PM Clark appeared to be taking no chances at this 
year's gathering: she arrived at the Ratana site near 
Wanganui with 27 Labour ministers and MPs in tow.  The media 
has also been reporting Clark's successful courting of Errol 
Meihana, son of the Ratana Church president, to run as 
Labour's candidate in one of seven Maori parliamentary seats. 
 This seat, Te Tai Hauauru, is likely to be contested by 
Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia, who is also Meihana's 
aunt. 
 
Church Fissures 
--------------- 
 
¶4.  (U)  Errol's father, Ratana Church leader, Harerangi 
Meihana, has rejected rumors that the Church will break its 
ties to Labour.  He is also reportedly insisting that 
followers back Labour.  In so doing, Meihana has alienated 
some Church members -* a group which includes another son 
who has declared his support for the Maori Party.  But it is 
the administrator of a second Ratana center, Te Omeka Marae 
Trust Chairman Ron Smith, who has been at the forefront of 
challenging Meihana's political position. 
 
¶5.  (C)  In a meeting on February 4, Smith made it clear to 
visiting Auckland Consul General that he strongly disapproves 
of the close Meihana-Labour association.  He confirmed that 
an upcoming Church synod to be held around Easter would 
likely focus internal discussions on the question of 
political affiliation.  Smith maintained that his real 
interest concerns Church infrastructure.  He insisted that 
political matters are the provenance of the Church's 
political wing, based in Matatmata at his Te Omeka Marae, and 
not with the spiritual center near Wanganui.  (A Ratana 
Church spokesman, however, has questioned Smith's assertions 
as being "at best debatable.")  Admitting that it sounds like 
"sour grapes," Smith said that under Meihana's leadership, 
the spiritual wing had become more and more involved in 
politics, more and more interested in "getting on the right 
side of Helen Clark." 
 
¶6. (C) Smith lamented the social cost of the rift ) as 
Meihana engages in politics young Maori, left spiritually 
adrift, are being swept up into crime.  Maori families are 
struggling to cope with these social strains and upheavals. 
The Church offers them no support.  As a result, Church 
membership is declining.  Smith contended that the Church 
needs to pay attention to Maori spiritual needs if it is to 
staunch the membership decline.  (Note:  We have been unable 
to confirm Smith's charge that institutional numbers are 
declining.  Figures cited publicly range from 40,000 to 
70,000 Ratana members.   Smith, however, estimated the 
current number to be closer to 20,000.  End Note) 
 
¶6.  (C)  Smith further contended that the Church is also 
losing followers for a non-spiritual reason: members do not 
want to be told for whom to vote.  The foreshore and seabed 
legislation, for example, is a matter of interest to members, 
important enough to sway political inclinations.  Given his 
position as political wing administrator, Smith said he had 
been trying to monitor members' political feelings while 
making it clear to them that whom they voted for was their 
business.  Smith believed that, rather than switching 
political allegiance from one political party to another, 
members at the Easter synod would want to reject voting 
directives of any kind, opting to let members make up their 
own minds.  Maori party co-leader Tariana Turia has echoed 
this sentiment, saying publicly that the Labour-Ratana 
alliance is effectively over as no group can tell Maori how 
to vote. 
 
Maori Party Prospects 
--------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C)  Both Smith and Turia believe the Maori Party is 
finding support among increasing numbers of Ratana followers. 
 But when asked about the party's 2005 electoral prospects, 
Smith said he thought it could win 2-3 seats.  He was 
uncertain if it could win more.  He also said he did not 
think the Party would win any general (list) seats.  Smith 
criticized the recent selection of  "brash" Maori activist, 
Hone Harawira, as the Maori Party candidate for Te Tai 
Tokerau.  Harawira, he said, was the kind of candidate who 
could make even liberal-minded persons vote for the right. 
Smith confided that he had been very embarrassed at the 
turnout for a Maori Party get-together at his center.  Two 
young Ratana Church members had assured him that "thousands" 
would come out; the actual number had been 120.  He implied 
that the disappointing attendance, captured by television 
cameras, had detracted from his center's prestige and its 
billing as the Ratana Church's political center.  It was only 
after Smith heard that "no one" had turned up for the 
launching of Errol Meihana's political organizing committee 
that he had begun to feel better. 
 
¶8.  (C)  Smith, who is himself a T.W. Ratana relative, 
described upcoming efforts, to be taken with the support of 
other Ratana family relations, to "reaffirm Church theology 
and infrastructure."  He denied he is seeking to split the 
Church or to oust Meihana, his cousin.  How, he asked, could 
he split the Church when all he is doing is "reaffirming 
theology, reaffirming the value of the Te Omeka site and 
recognizing the power of the people?"  (The irony of his 
pressing the theological case while at the same time 
insisting on the separation of the Wanganui "spiritual" arm 
of the Church and his own "political" role was apparently 
lost on Smith.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶9.  (C)  Comment: Current trends are likely to bear out 
Smith's and Turia's predictions.  It seems reasonable that a 
significant number of Ratana Church members, particularly the 
younger set, will want to make their own voting decisions -- 
even if the Church old guard should retain its official 
alliance with Labour.  Furthermore, the Maori Party is likely 
be the biggest beneficiary of any switched political party 
votes.  Whatever the Church's actual membership numbers, PM 
Clark chose to turn up at the Ratana anniversary celebrations 
with an unusually large Labour entourage.  She also 
assiduously courted Errol Meihana to run for Labour.  With 
the emergence of a credible Maori political alternative, such 
moves signal that Clark wants to dispel any impression that 
Labour is taking the Maori vote for granted.
