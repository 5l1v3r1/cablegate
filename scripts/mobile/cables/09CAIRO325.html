Hossam Bahgat, Executive Director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights noted that the progress set in motion between 2003 and 2005 currently manifests itself in continuing demonstrations, strikes and protests. He criticized the stifling role of State Security (SSIS) in public life. Hisham Kassem, president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, cautioned that observers should not expect President Mubarak to make any significant concessions on political reform. Kassem described young bloggers as a powerful force for change. Engi Haddad, president of the Afro-Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, suggested that fighting corruption will drive a wedge between the ruling party and the business elite. Haddad described her organization's plans to try to block a potential GOE privatization vouchers plan, out of concerns over corruption.
