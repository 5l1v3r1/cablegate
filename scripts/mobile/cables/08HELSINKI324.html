1.(U) Poloff delivered GAERC talking points to Finnish MFA 
European Correspondent Leena-Kaisa Mikkola July 15. 
 
2.(C) IRAN: Mikkola said that the discussion would focus on 
Iran's reply to Solana. She expects he will brief the 
ministers on that reply and on the next steps for the EU. 
The GoF agrees that UNSCR 1803 should be implemented soon. 
 
 
3.(SBU) SOMALIA: Mikkola expects discussion on Somalia and 
the pirate threat to focus on an ESDP approach and 
coordinating national vessels. 
 
4.(SBU) SUDAN/DARFUR, CHAD & Central African Republic: 
Mikkola said that Sudan and Darfur do not appear on the 
current agenda but may come up in relation to Chad or ICC 
activity. No conclusions are planned. 
 
5.(C) ZIMBABWE: Mikkola expressed disappointment with the 
UN outcome on Zimbabwe and stated that it's up to the EU 
Ministers to demonstrate support for Zimbabwe's people by 
expanding the list of targeted sanctions. She expects 
further action in September if Zimbabwe shows no improvement. 
 
6.(C) UKRAINE: Mikkola thinks that Sweden and Finland will 
speak on behalf of Ukraine. Because of the Irish rejection 
of the Lisbon Treaty and general enlargement fatigue, the 
discussion would focus on recognition of the process and 
not Ukrainian membership. 
 
7.(C) MIDDLE EAST and WESTERN BALKANS: Mikkola said that 
the Middle East and Western Balkans were late entries to 
the agenda. Tony Blair may speak on the Middle East. She 
doesn't expect discussion on Kosovo as the conclusions 
are focused on welcoming the pro-EU government of Serbia.
