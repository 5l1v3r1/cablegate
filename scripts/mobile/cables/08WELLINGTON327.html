¶1.  (C)  In an October 6 meeting with Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade Deputy Secretary Caroline Forsyth and 
European Affairs Division policy officer Rob Little, Charge 
d'Affaires Keegan summarized the points in reftel.  He noted 
that the USG position remains that referring the question of 
Kosovo independence to the the International Court of Justice 
(ICJ) is a distraction and that ultimately, the independence 
declaration will be deemed legally sound.  The USG will vote 
no on the UNGA resolution, and he asked the MFAT officials if 
the GNZ had taken a decision on this matter. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Forsyth responded that the GNZ is still developing 
its position but warned that a no vote would be highly 
unlikely.  She promised, however, that USG points would 
receive full consideration.  The GNZ supports the rule of 
law, the machinery of the United Nations and the ICJ, and 
does not necessarily view ICJ consideration of the case as a 
negative, offered Forsyth.  She opined that the ICJ is 
capable enough to recognize the pitfalls surrounding the 
issue, its ramifications beyond Kosovo, and would not paint 
itself into a corner.  The Charge asked about Serbian 
government contacts with the GNZ and possible motivations. 
Forsyth responded that the Serb President had written to the 
Prime Minister on the subject, and Serbian Ambassador based 
in Canberra had approached the New Zealand mission.  The 
Charge noted that ICJ review of the matter will delay 
Kosovo's integration in the international community.  Forsyth 
responded that the GNZ was aware of the significance of the 
issue, but saw that placing the matter with the ICJ offered 
the Serbian government a certain amount of political cover. 
Rob Little offered that the Serbian position, as explained to 
the GNZ, rested on Belgrade's desire to ensure that Kosovo's 
unilateral declaration was consistent with UNSCR 1244.
