¶1.  (S)  On March 2, Acting DCM met with Jillian Dempster, 
Deputy Director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
International Security and Disarmament Division to discuss 
reftel points.  Dempster agreed with the USG views, noting 
that MFAT had forwarded draft statements on both Iran and 
Syria to Cabinet Ministers last week.  The Government of New 
Zealand's position on both Iran and Syria under the new 
National-led government of PM John Key is likely to remain 
similar to that of former Labour PM Helen Clark.  Dempster 
observed that in both the cases of Iran and Syria, the 
Director General's reports indicate that "the situation has 
not been fixed."   Iran has not complied with IAEA requests 
for comprehensive access, has not provided design 
information, and has built roofs over its installations 
thereby limiting satellite information that provided some 
level of data.  On Syria, the GNZ believes that the issues 
surrounding the discovery of uranium in the soil samples from 
the destroyed alleged reactor site "are concerning" and that 
the GNZ does not deem as fully credible the GOS explanation 
that the uranium derives from Israeli missiles. 
 
¶2.  (S)  Dempster added that New Zealand would be sending a 
new Ambassador to Tehran shortly -- Brian Sanders who is 
currently working in MFAT's Asia Division on Korea and Japan 
will be replacing Hamish McMaster, who will return to 
Wellington.  The MFAT official added that Sanders has 
previous Middle East experience, having served in Riyadh. 
She also said that the Iranian Embassy has been conspicuously 
silent in the lead up to the March Board of Governors 
meeting.  Usually, the Iranian government conducts a public 
diplomacy campaign and demarches the GNZ; this year, there 
have been no meeting requests with MFAT, said Dempster. 
 
¶3.  (S)  On issuing the Syrian report to the public, Dempster 
reported that some NAM members of the Board do not want 
either the Iran or Syria reports to be made public, and will 
try to block BOG release of the reports.  She said that the 
GNZ would stay in touch with like-minded governments in 
Vienna and "see what the traffic will bear."
