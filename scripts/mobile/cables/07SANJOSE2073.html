¶1. (SBU) On December 13, Public Security Minister Fernando 
Berrocal wrote President Oscar Arias a letter recommending 
that Costa Rican law enforcement personnel "could maintain a 
training scheme" at WHINSEC to receive counternarcotics, 
counterterrorism and other "strictly police" training.  (Full 
text and informal translation emailed to WHA/CEN and 
SOUTHCOM.) 
 
¶2. (C) Following the plan that Berrocal outlined to us after 
his November visit to Fort Benning, President Arias will not 
respond to this letter, and his silence will be treated as 
acquiescence.  Berrocal will then be authorized to resume 
unrestricted, non-military training for Costa Rican law 
enforcement personnel at WHINSEC. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: Berrocal's letter ended the controversy 
(reftel and previous), which began in May when Arias told 
School of the America's Watch (SOAW) representatives that the 
GOCR would no longer send students to WHINSEC.  However, two 
areas of potential concern remain, especially since this 
"private" correspondence will likely surface in the media 
sooner or later: a) the use of "could" (quoted in para 1 
above) instead of the stronger "will" or "should" might 
provide an opening for a SOAW counterattack that Costa Rica 
is not fully committed to training at WHINSEC, after all; and 
b) an implicit (and false) expectation, that the USG will 
help equip the Air Section of the Ministry of Public Security 
with two additional helicopters.  (Berrocal and his staff 
made this pitch during their visits to JIATF-South and 
SOUTHCOM in November.)  On balance, however, we welcome the 
letter; Berrocal kept his word, and WHINSEC training for 
Costa Ricans can continue.
