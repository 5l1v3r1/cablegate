(C)  Leena Riitola, Acting Director of the Finnish MFA's 
Department for Africa and the Middle-East, told Poloff on 
August 3 that the GoF had finished its review of information 
concerning Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) detainees at Camp Ashraf 
who claim ties to Finland and determined that none of the 
detainees has a valid claim to residency, temporary or 
otherwise, in Finland.  She said that the detainees would 
likely be denied entry to Finland even if they were applying 
for a tourist visa with valid passports.  Riitola further 
said that the expired travel documents the detainees had 
provided to the CPA in support of their claim(s) to Finnish 
residency were over ten years old and did not transfer 
residency rights even when in effect.  Other Embassy sections 
also conferred with Finland's security community about the 
issue and received the same response;  there is no interest 
in interviewing the detainees or admitting them for any 
reason into Finland.
