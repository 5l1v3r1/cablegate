¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Japan has faced a variety of natural 
disasters and other historical challenges to its critical 
infrastructure and systems.  As a result, the country has 
developed preparations and capacity for responding to known 
threats, such as earthquakes, and has a record of willingness 
to share this information with others to help develop their 
abilities to prepare for and cope with disasters. 
Compartmentalization and risk aversion within the 
bureaucracy, however, could increase Japan,s vulnerability 
to threats for which it is less prepared, such as a pandemic. 
 Given the integration of the U.S. and Japanese economies as 
well as Japan,s status as the world's second largest 
economy, the potential consequences of a catastrophic event 
in Japan could be major. It would be useful to develop 
further bilateral exchanges on the subject of critical 
infrastructure and its protection and to include Japan in any 
work on critical infrastructure and emergency response.  End 
Summary. 
 
Introduction 
------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Japan and the U.S. are the world's two largest 
economies, closely linked to each other and to other major 
world economies.  A catastrophic event or major 
infrastructure failure in Japan, therefore, would negatively 
affect the U.S., the rest of Asia, and the global economy as 
well. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The infrastructure and systems that most directly 
connect the U.S. and Japan include information and 
communications, transportation and distribution, and 
financial systems.  Japan's industrial and R&D 
establishments, some of which have become sole providers for 
extremely specialized high-tech equipment or technologies, 
mean Japanese inputs are valuable, and sometimes essential, 
to numerous U.S. industries. 
 
Information and Communications Systems 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) A failure of information and communications systems 
would have an immediate impact.  These systems are connected 
globally in real time.  A major failure could affect 
transportation, energy, defense, financial, health care, and 
other critical industries and services. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The greatest risk to such systems seems to be 
virtual, from cyber-warfare or cyber-crime.  Such attacks are 
regarded as easier and could have a wider potential impact 
than attacks on physical infrastructure.  Attacks could also 
be launched against system infrastructure, content or 
operations on networks, or against individuals or commerce 
active over such networks.  Cyber-security threats seem an 
inescapable part of life on the Internet and the capabilities 
of potential attackers and those administering networks are 
already advanced and growing continually. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Still, physical damage to global information 
networks remains a threat, particularly involving 
trans-oceanic cables or remote infrastructure.  Given the 
redundancy and ability to reroute signals over networks, 
however, such an incident might have less severe impact on 
the U.S, although the time and cost of repairing a 
transpacific cable could be substantial. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Japan is pursuing policies to address risks and 
improve its cyber-security profile.  Japan has both public 
and private sector entities focused on cyber-security in an 
effort coordinated by the National Information Security 
Council (NISC), a cabinet office, and the Japan Computer 
Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC).  The 
country is currently in the second year of its Secure Japan 
three year plan. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The U.S.-Japan Cyber-Security Dialogue, lead by DHS 
and NISC, also continues to share information and explore 
areas of cooperation.  One example is participation by 
Japanese observers in the March 2008 CyberStorm II exercise. 
These efforts should improve international coordination of 
planning and cyber-security response capabilities, 
demonstrate best practices and refine national programs.

Aviation and Maritime Ports 
--------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) Transportation links between Japan and the U.S. too 
are critical to global as well as bilateral commerce. 
Two-way merchandise trade in 2006 between the two countries 
equaled USD 207.7 billion.  On average, USD 569 million worth 
of goods passed through Japanese ports every day on their way 
to or from the U.S. 
 
¶10. (U) Japan's three largest airports with traffic to the 
U.S. are Narita (Tokyo-Yokohama), Kansai (Osaka-Kobe), and 
Chubu (Nagoya).  In addition to serving passengers to both 
countries, they are vital hubs for trans-pacific passenger 
traffic.  In terms of passenger traffic to the U.S., 50 
flights and 13,000 passengers per day arrive in the United 
States from Narita (second only to London Heathrow). 
Disruption of these airports, therefore, would have serious 
consequences for the U.S. and Asia. 
 
¶11. (U) Cargo traffic through these airports is also a vital 
economic link.  In 2007, roughly USD 20 billion of shipments, 
or almost 13 percent by value of all Japanese exports to the 
U.S., went as air cargo out of Narita airport.  By value, 
more trade passes through this airport than through any other 
port in Japan.  Narita handles roughly twice the value of 
global two-way trade as the port of Tokyo.  Narita handles 72 
percent more than Nagoya port, which processes the most trade 
by value of any Japanese maritime port. 
 
¶12. (U) Japan's maritime ports are also vital economic links. 
 Japan's five largest maritime ports are Tokyo, Yokohama, 
Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe.  In 2006, they processed over one 
million containers (1.43 million TEU) to/from the U.S. 
 
¶13. (SBU) Japan has established agencies and policies 
providing for port security, both infrastructure protection 
and border controls, consistent with international standards, 
such as the International Ship and Port Facility Security 
Code.  Operational U.S. agencies such as Customs and Border 
Protection, the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. 
Coast Guard have ongoing dialogue and information sharing 
programs with Japanese counterparts.  Other examples of 
specific initiatives to strengthen the security of ports and 
shipping include the Megaport program.  Japan looks to launch 
a Megaports pilot project in Yokohama and is working with DHS 
and DOE on plans. 
 
Financial Market Infrastructure 
------------------------------- 
 
¶14. (SBU) Financial markets are a clear example of other 
infrastructures that closely connect the two economies.  A 
failure in Japan's financial system infrastructure, or the 
interruption of financial transaction clearing, would have 
serious repercussions for the U.S. and the rest of the world. 
 
¶15. (U) Establishment, maintenance, and protection of 
financial system infrastructure have been left to the private 
sector, under the supervision of the financial services 
regulator, the Financial Services Agency, and the Bank of 
Japan, which is responsible for the payments system. 
 
Disasters and Threats in Japan 
------------------------------ 
 
¶16. (U) Japan's has a history of catastrophic natural 
disasters.  Historically, the greatest natural threats were 
earthquakes and volcanoes, storms, and fires.  The great 
Kanto (Tokyo) earthquake of 1923 was of magnitude 7.9 and 
killed roughly 105,000 people; the Hanshin (Kobe) earthquake 
of 1995 was magnitude 7.3 and killed 6,437.  Between 1996 and 
2005, 20.8 percent of the world's earthquakes of 6.0 or 
greater occurred in Japan.  Seven percent of the world's 
active volcanoes are located in Japan and Mt. Fuji, although 
it last erupted in 1707-08, is still active and a threat to 
the greater Tokyo area with its 30 million inhabitants. 
Storms are another problem, with the 1959 Ise Bay Typhoon 
taking 5,098 lives.  There is a clear downward trend in the 
numbers of lives lost in disasters in Japan, however. 
Factors contributing to this development include improved 
technology and engineering, stronger safety standards, and 
better emergency preparations and response. 
 
¶17. (SBU) Japan faces other types of threats, with pandemics 
 
TOKYO 00000727  003 OF 003 
 
 
one of the most serious.  The SARS and Avian Influenza did 
not greatly affect Japan, but the country is potentially 
vulnerable to a pandemic.  In addition, Japan has also 
experienced terrorism, for example, with the taking of 
hostages at the Japanese Embassy in Peru and the Sarin gas 
attack in the Tokyo subway system.  The 1995 Sarin attack 
killed 12, injured 1,034, and undermined public confidence in 
the safety of Japan's mass transit system. 
 
¶18. (SBU) Japan relies heavily on nuclear power for roughly 
30 percent of its electricity needs.  While Japan has never 
had an attack on a nuclear facility, several Japanese 
facilities have experienced safety incidents, some resulting 
in fatalities and prolonged shutdowns.  In the most recent 
case, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant located in 
Niigata Prefecture and the world's largest in terms of 
electrical generating capacity, remains off line following a 
July 2007 earthquake.  Also during summer 2007, the Hokkaido 
Electric Power Company was criticized for failing to prevent 
suspected arson at a reactor construction site at its Tomari 
nuclear power plant. 
 
¶19. (SBU) Japan's political leaders and public profess 
concern about the country's continued dependence on imported 
food as well as on imported oil.  Some Japanese still recall 
post-war shortages.  However, as Japan is less than 40 
percent self-sufficient in food production, despite concerns 
about food security, Japan's only practical resource security 
will come from stable and reliable flows. 
 
Emergency Preparedness and Response 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶20. (SBU) The GOJ has taken steps to prepare for such 
threats.  Japan has established legislative and 
organizational frameworks for disaster management and 
emergency response.  The GOJ has developed response 
capabilities at the national, regional, and local levels as 
well.  A Minister of State for Disaster Management oversees 
disaster management efforts, coordinated by the Cabinet 
Office, and involving 23 government entities and 63 public 
and private corporations.  The legal basis for Japan's 
Disaster Management System were set out in 1961 by the 
Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act. 
 
¶21. (SBU) Japanese bureaucracy and planning can be 
inflexible, with the result that Japan may be still 
vulnerable to threats that are less well understood, or which 
require different sorts of preparation.  A pandemic or a 
major cyber attack would require different responses from 
those appropriate to an earthquake, and could catch both the 
GOJ and private sector unprepared.  Such a situation in turn 
could result in prolonged loss of critical systems or 
services. 
 
¶22. (C) Comment:  Highly advanced technology and its 
application for industrial and consumer use has long been a 
key factor in Japan's economic growth and a reality for 
leading U.S. and other companies.  Disruption in the supply 
lines would have significant consequences.  Likewise, Japan's 
role as an international financial services and a 
communications/transportation hub would mean an attack or 
other serious development that disrupted these activities 
here, would likely seriously affect the U.S. and other 
allies.  As the U.S. proceeds with the effort described in 
ref, it may be useful to consider reaching out to Japan to 
discuss steps we can take to prevent a possible disruption or 
to mitigate the negative effects should one occur.  End 
Comment.
