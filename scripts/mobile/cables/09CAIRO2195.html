  		<h1>EGYPTIAN MFA ADVISOR ON SUDAN, NILE BASIN REF: 08 CAIRO 1963 Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs Donald A. Blome for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(C) Key Points: -- The Egyptian MFA's cabinet advisor on African Affairs Mohamed El Mullah said the Government of Egypt (GoE) will continue to support the unity of Sudan until the January 2011 referendum. However, he said Egypt will accept and support the South if it chooses independence. -- According to El Mullah, President Mubarak agreed with a proposal by Sudanese President Bashir for Egypt to host a conference on Darfur reconstruction after the signing of a peace accord. Egypt also supports a French proposal for a summit in Sharm El Sheikh to discuss how to deal with the outcome of the January 2011 referendum. -- A recent joint MFA and Ministry of Water Resources trip to upstream Nile Basin countries to discuss the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) did not produce any significant results, according to El Mullah. He said Egypt offered to help upstream countries develop hydro-electric power, but maintained that Egypt's quota of water must not be affected.</h1>
