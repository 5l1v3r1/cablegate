SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) In a May 11 meeting, Defense Minister Elias Murr told 
Charge that Hizballah fighters were moving into his 
neighborhood to take up positions around Michel Aoun's 
residence.  Murr thinks that the incidents of 8-10 May prove 
that Army Commander Sleiman and Army Intelligence Chief 
Georges Khoury are "in the pocket" of Hizballah and that 
everyone has made a deal for their own benefit. Murr 
expressed an unwavering commitment to the government saying 
they (Hizbullah) would have to enter his house and kill him 
before he gives up on the two cabinet decisions that led to 
Hizbullah's actions on the streets of Beirut. Murr 
anticipates trouble among army officers, especially the 
Sunnis, based on the Army's performance in Beirut where they 
allowed Hizballah to take over Sunni-dominated West Beirut. 
Murr feels that Saudi Arabia and Egypt are the most important 
players to affect the current situation in Beirut, "if they 
are in the deal." Murr has been under increasing criticism 
from Lebanese politicians about his relationship with the USG 
saying his alliance has been a "failure" because there has 
been no real assistance to help Lebanon against Syria and 
Iran. 
 
¶2. (C) Charge, accompanied by Defense Attach and PolOff, met 
with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Elias Murr 
at his residence in Rabieh on Sunday, May 11 at 10:00 a.m. 
 
HIZBALLAH IS JUST OUTSIDE MY WALLS 
OVER 200 FIGHTERS MOVED IN LAST NIGHT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Murr set the stage for our early Sunday morning by 
telling us about his newest neighbors. Evidently, Free 
Patriotic Movement (FPM) leader Michel Aoun has received 200 
new body guards to protect his residence in Rabieh which is 
not far from Murr's home. These fighters had infiltrated into 
Rabieh on dirt tracks that were not guarded. Now, according 
to Murr, his nine year old daughter asks him, "who are those 
dirty men with beards outside?" (Comment. If Murr were really 
in distress about this new development, it is unlikely that 
he would still have his two children in the house while his 
ex-wife was out of the country. End Comment.) 
 
¶4. (C) In addition to the 200 fighters around his house, Murr 
told us that he knew of an additional 400 fighters that had 
infiltrated the Dikwayne areas of the Metn. Murr assessed 
that all of these forces were being brought in to intimidate 
Amine Gemayel's Phalange Party and to prepare to cut the main 
highway leading north out of Beirut. (Note. Defense Attach 
noted a significant increase in the number of LAF armored 
vehicles deployed on this highway on the morning of 11 May. 
This was the first time Defense Attach has seen armored 
personnel carriers on this highway in the last two years. End 
Note.) 
 
ARMY COMMANDER AND INTELLIGENCE CHIEF 
IN HIZBULLAH'S BACK POCKET 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Murr, clearly upset with the LAF's lack of 
performance, told Charge that Sleiman was a "coward."  Charge 
recalled USDP Edelman's question to Sleiman about a lack of 
LAF action leading to questions of either caution or 
collusion on the part of the LAF. Murr agreed saying , "these 
are Sleiman's three C's; caution, coward, collusion."  (Note.
