¶1. (C) The Government of New Zealand formalized diplomatic 
relations with Cuba in 2001, with their Ambassador resident 
in Mexico City accredited to Havana.  According to Mike Shaw, 
Americas Division, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade, the GoNZ uses meetings with Cuban officials to 
"express its concern over the human rights situation in Cuba, 
and encourage moves towards democratization and the promotion 
of human rights.  These include the proper treatment of those 
who hold political views in opposition to the Cuban 
government."  This is consistent with the GoNZ's policy of 
engagement with states that have poor human rights records. 
Post is unaware of any NZ entity or nationals who would be 
subject to Title III of the LIBERTAD Act.  The GoNZ would 
strenuously object to any effort to apply Title III to a NZ 
national or entity on extraterritoriality grounds.  The GoNZ 
is strongly supportive of U.S. positions re Cuba's human 
rights record, and use of Title III would jeopardize 
continued good-faith cooperation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Economically, Cuba was New Zealand's 40th largest 
trading partner in calendar year 2003, with exports to Cuba 
at NZ$68 million (USD42.1 million,) and imports at NZ$934,000 
(USD579,000.)  97 percent of these exports were in the dairy 
sector, specifically milk powder.
