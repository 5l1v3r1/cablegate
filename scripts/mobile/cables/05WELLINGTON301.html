¶1.  (C) Summary: Minister for Disarmament Marion Hobbs has 
expressed regret at causing offense during her February 
meeting on Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) issues with 
Ambassador Sanders (Ref B), claiming she had only been trying 
to say that all parts of the NPT are equally important and 
should lead to the complete elimination of all nuclear 
weapons.  Hobbs stressed several times that she is not 
singling out the United States and believes all nuclear 
states must disarm.  Her anxiety to set the record straight 
is significant, as it reflects a growing sensitivity among 
New Zealand officials that their U.S. counterparts are not 
happy with how the GONZ views the United States.  However, 
Hobbs stopped short of endorsing our position that 
proliferation is currently the greatest nuclear threat to 
global security.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) At an April 4 meeting with DCM and Pol-Econ Couns, 
New Zealand's Minister for Disarmament Marion Hobbs expressed 
regret for any misunderstanding during her February 11 
meeting with Ambassador Sanders (Ref B) concerning New 
Zealand goals for the May NPT Review Conference (Revcon). 
Hobbs said that she was surprised to learn that any offense 
had been taken by her remarks concerning the responsibility 
of the United States to disarm its nuclear weapons.  She said 
that as she remembered the conversation, she and Ambassador 
Sanders had agreed that New Zealand and the United States 
share the ultimate goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons. 
 
¶3. (C) Hobbs said that what she actually had been trying to 
say was that New Zealand fears the Revcon will result in a 
trade-off between disarmament and nonproliferation.  That 
must not happen.  She stressed that New Zealand wants Iran to 
stop its illegal nuclear program, although she admitted that 
the IAEA was having a hard time getting Iran to verify and 
said Germany had asked for the Kiwis' help to get Iran on 
board.  The DCM said the United States  appreciated New 
Zealand's previous work as IAEA Board member in trying to get 
Iran to cooperate with the IAEA.  Pol-Econ Couns said that 
our goal, too, is to prevent one part of the NPT from being 
traded for another.  But proliferation has increased even as 
the nuclear states have disarmed.  The greatest immediate 
threat to global security is nonproliferation and this should 
be the RevCon's focus. 
 
¶4.  (C) Hobbs said New Zealand believes the nuclear states 
must also submit their programs to verification.  She assured 
us that since her meeting with Ambassador Sanders, she had 
made the same point to Russia's senior NPT negotiator.  She 
admitted that she has not yet had the chance to raise the 
issue with China and the UK, and that it would be a long time 
before she could discuss the NPT with France.  (Comment: 
Thanks to the 1985 Auckland bombing by French intelligence of 
the Greenpeace ship the "Rainbow Warrior," New Zealand's 
history with France on nuclear issues is even more fraught 
with conflict than our own. End comment.)  Hobbs repeated 
that New Zealand officials are pushing the need for 
disarmament because they believe it is necessary to make 
progress on all parts of the NPT, with the ultimate goal of 
eliminating all nuclear arms in all states. "I see two 
groupings of countries," she said, "nuclear states, 
non-nuclear states, and a few in between." 
 
¶5.  (C) The DCM noted that some non-nuclear states use 
Article VI as an excuse to move ahead on their illegitimate 
nuclear programs. The U.S. record on disarmament is 
exceptional, as Ambassador Sanders noted during her visit and 
in her article in the recent U.S. electronic journal on 
nuclear issues (Ref A).  The DCM provided Minister Hobbs with 
a hard copy of the journal.  He noted that all U.S. 
discussions with New Zealand on nuclear matters carry 
baggage, but that it is important that we work together when 
we can.  We also recognize that one problem is that 
NPT-compliant countries don't have as much leverage as those 
states that are trying to break their NPT commitments.  Bad 
behavior gets rewarded, and we are looking at ways to change 
this and encourage peaceful use of nuclear technology. 
Closing the meeting, Hobbs said she would be going to Mexico 
before the NPT Revcon. 
 
¶6.  (C) Comment:  We had let it be known through our Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs contacts that Ambassador Sanders and her 
team did not appreciate Minister Hobbs' linking of U.S. NPT 
disarmament commitments with Iran's nonproliferation 
obligations (Ref b).  The Minister knew she had offended the 
group in some way (and remarked on this briefly to Pol-Econ 
Couns at an official dinner the next night) but seemed 
genuinely surprised at the reason. While Minister Hobbs had 
sought out the meeting with the DCM and went to huge lengths 
to stress that New Zealand believes all nuclear states must 
disarm, she stopped short of saying that Iran poses a greater 
threat.  Although Deputy Foreign Secretary Rosemary Banks 
assured us the day after our meeting that this was because 
Hobbs wanted to avoid all Iran/U.S. analogies this time, it's 
also clear that Hobbs (and others in the GONZ) still believe 
that  nuclear states must disarm if others are to be 
successfully encouraged to give up their nuclear weapons 
programs.  End Comment.
