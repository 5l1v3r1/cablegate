This message was drafted by ConGen Auckland and approved by 
Embassy Wellington. 
 
¶1.  (C) During a recent visit to Auckland, Cook Islands 
Deputy Prime Minister Sir Terepai Maoate, along with 
Associate Minister Junior Maoate (his son) and CEO Ratu Mato, 
met with the Ambassador and Auckland CG.  Maoate explained 
that the Cooks are anxious to expand their thin economic base 
beyond fishing and tourism.  The GCI is particularly 
interested in finding ways to exploit what Maoate described 
as vast mineral wealth under the seabed.  Maoate claimed that 
the sea floor of the Cooks's economic exclusion zone (nearly 
700,000 square miles) held vast reserves of manganese and 
other minerals potentially worth billions of dollars to the 
small island nation.  Maoate insisted that much of this is 
recoverable with current technologies and could transform the 
Cooks's economy.  Maoate expressed great interest in U.S. 
investment in mineral exploitation. 
 
¶2.  (C) Maoate also explained that the GCI is hamstrung in 
its efforts to patrol its economic exclusion zone.  The 
country's lone patrol boat depends on private, island-hopping 
aircraft for leads on vessels fishing illegally, vessels that 
inevitably disappear long before the patrol boat can 
intercept them.  The Deputy PM sought U.S. help in expanding 
an airfield in the Cooks to beef up patrolling. 
Specifically, expanding the facilities at this airfield would 
make it usable for a French government aircraft that provides 
surveillance for French territories in the region.  In 
exchange for use of the facility, Maoate suggested, the 
French would help patrol the Cooks's territorial waters. 
Maoate proposed a "joint venture" with the U.S. to expand the 
airstrip. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Maoate also strongly encouraged the Ambassador to 
visit the Cooks in the near future; an invitation the 
Ambassador promised to take advantage of as soon as his 
schedule allowed. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment.  Maoate seemed only superficially aware of 
the USG's proposed Bilateral Maritime Security Treaty 
(reftel).  Not surprisingly, Maoate was less interested in 
how such an agreement would aid USG efforts to combat drug 
smuggling in the Caribbean than in how it might help the GCI 
police its own territorial waters.  End comment.
