¶1.  (SBU) The Ambassador paid his introductory and farewell 
call on newly appointed Foreign Minister Murray McCully 
December 15. They agreed that there had been dramatic 
improvement in our bilateral relationship during Ambassador 
McCormick,s tenure due to the efforts of many leaders in 
both governments. McCully said he had taken the opportunity 
of the recent APEC meetings in Lima to thank Assistant 
Secretary Christopher Hill personally. 
¶2.  (C) Early in the conversation, FM McCully said that he 
anticipated that New Zealand,s acting High Commissioner to 
Suva might be expelled shortly. He explained that during the 
recent trip of Pacific Island Forum (PIF) foreign ministers 
to Fiji he had been summoned to the office of acting Prime 
Minister Bainimarama. Bainimarama had said that Fiji was 
still waiting for New Zealand to issue a student visa for the 
son of the President,s Private Secretary. If the visa were 
not issued Fiji would expel the High Commissioner. McCully 
said that the visa applicant had had a student visa to New 
Zealand before and might well qualify on his own, but he fell 
under the visa prohibition against members of the interim 
government and their families. McCully made it clear that he 
considered Bainimarama,s threat to be an effort to 
intimidate the New Zealand,s new National Government, and 
the Government would not buckle. In the next day or two he 
would be drafting a response with the bad news, and he 
expected the High Commissioner,s expulsion to follow soon 
after. He expressed the hope that the U.S. would support New 
Zealand if these events occurred. The Ambassador made it 
clear that we understood New Zealand,s situation and 
supported its response. Embassy Wellington understands that 
Ambassador McGann in Fiji has informed Washington that he 
stands ready to express our disapproval if Bainimarama moves 
toward such an action. 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ambassador said that New Zealand,s role in the 
Pacific is one which the United States highly values. He 
highlighted the importance of our working with the Pacific 
Island Countries to address issues such as sustainable 
fisheries and renewable energy. McCully said that the new 
National Government is looking at what steps it can take to 
bring a new intensity and focus to these efforts. Ambassador 
McCormick urged New Zealand particularly to consider the 
value of taking the lead with the U.S. in renewable energy 
efforts. He suggested that the installation of even a single 
wind turbine on each Pacific island would remind governments 
and peoples of our continuing commitment to them. McCully 
said that he fully shared that sentiment. He said that he had 
heard Australian Prime Minister Rudd had suggest that 
Australia and New Zealand were spending one billion dollars 
between them in the Pacific, and they needed to be sure that 
they were actually buying something with that expenditure. 
¶4.  (SBU) McCully concluded the call by saying that he looked 
forward to visiting Washington at an appropriate time, and he 
would defer to us on what the best time might be.
