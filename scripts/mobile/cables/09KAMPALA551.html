</p><p>¶1. (SBU) Summary: This cable is a periodic update on the 
regional military operation against the Lord's Resistance 
Army (LRA) known as Operation Rudia II. This report is not 
meant to provide an overarching narrative or polished 
analysis of the operation, but rather offers spot information 
gleaned in Uganda only, from credible U.S. Mission sources 
here. We recognize the regional scope of the operation and 
the fact that our sources may be limited in their knowledge 
and perspective on Rudia II. End Summary.

MILITARY SITUATION UPDATE

</p><p>¶2. (S NF) Ugandan military operations on the ground continue 
to make steady progress. The Ugandan Peoples Defense Forces 
(UPDF) are actively pursuing LRA groups and has successfully 
laid ambushes, killing senior LRA commanders. Between May 18 
and 29, the UPDF killed 41 LRA fighters, including Brigadier 
General Cesar Achellam and Lt. Col. Okello Okuti. Six 
non-combatants were rescued during this period. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) The U.N. Mission in Congo (MONUC) office in Kampala 
confirmed that the World Food Program (WFP) has planned air 
drops of food in LRA-affected areas of northeastern 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). WFP says that the 
oncoming rainy season will make it difficult for larger 
aircraft to deliver food into Dungu. As a result, WFP had 
conducted several "test drops" of food by helicopter in and 
around Dungu. Similar operations will be conducted in 
Doruma, Bangadi, Duru, and Faradje. WFP reportedly 
coordinated with MONUC and the Congolese Armed Forces. 
However, the drops were not coordinated with the UPDF, which 
had reported it had found LRA carrying donor food near 
Faradje. REFCOORD met with WFP on June 1 to get more details 
and urge WFP to coordinate with the Ugandan military. We 
will report out on the issue septel.

</p><p>¶4. (C) The contract of U.N. Special Envoy for LRA-Affected 
Areas Joachim Chissano expires on June 30 andwill not be 
renewed at his request. Nuno Tomas, Chissano's Kampala 
office director, said that LRA leader Joseph Kony shows no 
interest in signing the peace deal and that Chissano has many 
pressing commitments. Chissano would be available should 
Kony change his mind. Uganda's Minister of State for 
International Relations Henry Okello Oryem told us that the 
Ugandan Government accepts the move, but is concerned that 
northern Ugandans might perceive it as an indication that 
there is no chance for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. 
Oryem said that the Government would reassure northerners 
and remind the LRA that Kony could call Ugandan President 
Yoweri Museveni if he decides to sign the peace agreement. 
Oryem also said that the Ugandan Government is concerned that 
Government of Southern Sudan Vice President Riek Machar might 
exploit Chissano's departure to try to re-open the peace 
process. 
</p><p>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX an analyst XXXXXXXXXXX
 briefed the diplomatic community XXXXXXXXXXXX.. 
She stated  that it had been "pretty clear" that the Juba Peace
talks had  not been "going anywhere," and that Kony had not bee
 and was not now interested in peace. She recommended that the 
military operations continue with a focus on killing the 
senior LRA leadership and increasing efforts to protect the 
Congolese civilian population. She advocated a multi-lateral 
discourse on planning and increased MONUC capability, along 
with increased U.S. Government support, including planning 
support, intelligence, and logistics. She explained that 
Congolese President Kabila's internal problems, including 
opposition to the operation from eastern DRC 
parliamentarians, had been a problem, but that the lack of 
human rights abuses by the UPDF coupled with continued LRA 
depredations resulted in a positive perception of the UPDF 
presence among Congolese civilians. This has dissipated 
parliamentary opposition, according to Spiegel. (Comment: 
Spiegel, like most other non-governmental observers, publicly 
expresses surprise at the number of Ugandan troops still in 
the DRC and that the Ugandan troop strength has not been 
publicly discussed. We note that the Ugandan Government has 
deliberately (and successfully) kept quiet its troop strength 
and regular engagements with the LRA in order to keep a 
Congolese face on the operation. End Comment.)
