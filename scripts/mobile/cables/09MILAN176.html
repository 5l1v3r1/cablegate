¶1. (C) As mentioned in reftel, the 67 year-old founder of the 
Northern League (LN) political party, Umberto Bossi, remains 
in poor health due to a stroke he suffered in 2004.  Though 
Bossi continues an active and provocative political life, 
constantly in the media and public eye, judging by 
appearances and our personal interactions with him he seems 
decidedly unwell. He has refused to quite smoking, and 
requires a personal assistant to ensure he gets up and ready, 
and stays on track during the day.  As Bossi is the 
undisputed leader and spiritual guru of the party, his 
decline is a topic (unspoken generally) of concern among 
Leghisti and has led to much speculation over the future 
direction and philosophy of this increasingly mainstream (at 
least north of the Po River) party.  There is a clear first 
rank of ""colonels"" in their 50s, including current Ministers 
Roberto Maroni and Roberto Calderoli and former Minister 
Roberto Castelli, who will probably stake claims to the party 
leadership when Bossi goes.  However, the longer term picture 
will depend also on those young LN leaders who are being 
primed for influential seats at the table.  The following 
cable looks at six of the next generation that we think it 
wise to keep an eye on. 
 
Giancarlo Giorgetti (born in Cazzago Brabbia (Lombardy), 
December 16, 1966, married to Laura Ferrari) 
 
¶2. (C) Numerous political contacts speculate that Giorgetti 
is the logical successor to Bossi because of his impeccable 
LN pedigree, ironclad personal ties with the boss, and 
extensive experience in Rome.  He is the national secretary 
of the Lombard League (LN,s ""flagship"" regional branch) and 
comes from Varese, the hometown of LN heavyweights including 
Bossi and current Interior Minister Roberto Maroni.  With a 
degree in economics from Milan's prestigious Bocconi 
University, Giorgetti is sharp and well-respected both inside 
and outside of his party.  He was elected to the Chamber of 
Deputies in 1996 and has been reelected in each subsequent 
session.  He served as president of the powerful Treasury 
Committee from 2001-06, and from 2008 to the present (he 
served as vice president of the Committee when the 
center-right was in the opposition from 2006-08).  He has 
also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and is a member 
of the Italian Parliamentary delegation to NATO. 
 
Flavio Tosi (born in Verona (Veneto), June 18, 1969, married 
to Stefania Villanova) 
 
¶3. (C) Tosi began his political career in 1995 when he was 
elected to the Verona city council. From 1997 to 2003 he 
served as provincial secretary for the LN.  He held the 
office of regional health assessore until June 25, 2007, when 
he resigned to become mayor of Verona.  Although Tosi has a 
history of fiery rhetoric and populist action (or 
trouble-making depending on one's viewpoint), he is an 
efficient administrator and has a strong base of supporters 
due to his attention to detail.  He has earned kudos from 
Veronese voters in particular for cleaning up the streets and 
public spaces through a ""zero-tolerance"" campaign against 
crime and delinquency.  As a measure of his personal 
popularity and the success of his anti-crime image, Tosi 
recently was given direct supervision of the local police (a 
role held normally by the central government's Prefect). 
This pilot project, launched by Minister Maroni, should give 
Mayor Tosi a further opportunity to burnish his image in 
Verona and Veneto as a ""Law and Order"" candidate. 
 
¶4. (C) As noted in reftel, Tosi is a front-runner (along with 
Luca Zaia, see below) to become regional governor of Veneto 
in elections next March.  This is important for the United 
States since Veneto is one of Italy's economic powerhouses 
and hosts Vicenza army base (the headquarters of Africom's 
army component and soon to be the home of the re-consolidated 
173rd airborne brigade).  Perhaps in pursuit of this 
political step up, Tosi is trying to construct a more 
moderate image by strengthening his ties with the United 
States -- making himself regularly available to meet with 
U.S. diplomats and publicizing our trips to the Verona area 
in the local media.  Though considered to be one of the more 
controversial Leghisti on matters of immigration, Tosi has 
also stated publicly that immigrants who work legally are a 
necessary part of the economy of Veneto and Italy. 
 
¶5. (C) Tosi was recently convicted of violating the Mancino 
law (which condemns racist slogans, actions, or gestures 
during political campaigns) for a petition he organized in 
 
MILAN 00000176  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
2001 urging citizens to support the removal of a Roma camp 
outside Verona.  However, his two-month sentence was 
suspended and the court wiped the conviction from his 
permanent record.  Considering the anti-immigrant political 
mood in Italy, and the strength of the LN's position in 
Veneto, this conviction, which he has been portrayed as 
another ""abuse of justice"" at the hands of ""activist"" and 
""left-wing"" judges, is likely to bolster his image among his 
power base.  We have no evidence one way or the other on the 
alleged politicization of the lengthy legal procedure. 
 
¶6. (C) Though Tosi is not one of the ""Lombard League,"" 
Bossi's original party and the nucleus of the Northern 
League, he is head of the ""Veneto League"" component of the LN 
and is trusted and liked by Bossi.  Tosi is reportedly 
influential in LN policymaking both regionally and 
nationally.  Should he not be elected regional governor in 
2010, contacts say he would likely get a national ministerial 
role. 
 
Luca Zaia (born in Bibano (Veneto), March 27, 1968, married 
to Raffaella) 
 
¶7. (C) Minister of Agriculture Zaia entered politics in 1995 
as the Treviso provincial councilmember for agriculture.  He 
was provincial president from 1998-2005 and regional vice 
president of Veneto until becoming minister in 2008, and is 
considered one of the two frontrunners (alongside Mayor Tosi) 
for the governorship of Veneto in 2010.  His position as 
Minister of Agriculture is an important placement for LN and 
especially the Veneto region. He is an active promoter of the 
small and medium-sized enterprises that are the backbone of 
Veneto's and Italy's economy.  We note that Zaia is probably 
one of LN's most ""palatable"" leaders.  He is very sharp and 
pragmatic, but is not as publicly well-known as Tosi, for 
instance.  Zaia is well-educated (a graduate of one of the 
country's top oenological institutes and of the University of 
Udine) and has shown himself able to tackle large problems 
and forge important agreements.  He is also a fantastic 
public speaker (especially off-the-cuff).  We witnessed him 
talk circles around a political rival, current Veneto 
Governor Giancarlo Galan, during a recent public event. 
 
¶8. (C) Zaia may very well become governor of Veneto, though 
contacts tell us he is not interested in the job.  However, 
we don't believe he is a serious candidate to replace Bossi 
because he is not one of the insiders of the Lombard League. 
 
Matteo Salvini (born in Milan, March 9, 1973, separated) 
 
¶9. (C) Salvini is a firebrand populist and professional 
journalist with a hand in LN's press message.  He is 
responsible for the majority of youth interaction on behalf 
of LN due to his roots as a DJ on Radio Padania, the local LN 
radio station. He was first elected to the Milan city council 
in 1993 and is currently the leader of the LN in the council. 
 He is vice secretary of the LN national party alongside 
Marco Reguzzoni (see below).  Salvini was in the European 
Parliament from 2004-06, the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 
2008, and was elected again to the European Parliament in 
June 2009.  The international press recently speculated that 
his resignation from the Italian parliament was in reaction 
to his recitation in a beer tent of an anti-Neapolitan song. 
However, in fact, Salvini's resignation was necessary to 
accept his new appointment in Brussels, not a result of 
pressure over his comments. The media also made much of a 
public pronouncement by Salvini in May 2009 that there should 
be Milan subway cars designated for Milan citizens only. 
 
¶10. (C) Because Salvini's role to date has largely been 
mouthpiece and ""provocateur,"" it is difficult to know for 
sure his personal positions.  Publicly he is always on the 
radical end of the spectrum, but he has never had to put his 
policies in action because he has never held local 
administrative office above city councilmember.  Nonetheless, 
Salvini is a leading light in the core Lombard League and was 
present at the creation of the Northern League.  With some 
national political experience under his belt, now, Salvini is 
likely to play a more important policy role within the party. 
 
Massimo Giordano (born in Novara (Piedmont), September 16, 
1969, married to Simona Castellani) 
 
¶11. (C) Giordano joined the LN in 1996 and served as an 
assessore in Novara beginning in 1997.  He has been mayor of 
Novara (Piedmont's second-largest city after Turin) since 
2001, winning re-election by a large margin in 2006.  A 
lawyer by profession, Giordano was elected to office by 
supporters across party lines (Piedmont is traditionally a 
 
MILAN 00000176  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
Democratic Party stronghold) due to his reputation as a 
pragmatic leader. His ability to gain support and build 
consensus without resorting to LN's typical incendiary 
tactics make him a bastion of moderation within the party. 
 
¶12. (C) Though less populist than Tosi, Giordano is also an 
intense personality.  His attention to detail and the 
importance he places on personal relationships with his 
constituents has worked well for LN.  Contacts believe that 
in 2011 at the conclusion of Giordano's second, and final, 
term he will certainly try for national office.  Giordano is 
planning to go to the United States on an International 
Visitor program in 2010. 
 
Marco Reguzzoni (born in Busto Arsizio (Lombardy), May 30, 
1971, married to Elena) 
 
¶13. (C) Reguzzoni stands out a bit from the others on this 
list as he is a successful businessman as well as a career 
politician.  He has a degree in engineering management from 
Politecnico di Milano and since 1995 has worked as a business 
consultant and helped start Biocell Center, a multi-national 
stem cell research company (with a branch in Boston).  He 
also worked with the committee that brought Expo 2015 to 
Milan.  Reguzzoni was a participant in an International 
Visitor Program in 2005. 
 
¶14. (C) At the same time, Reguzzoni has been a hard-core 
member of LN, joining the Lombard League in 1986 at the age 
of 15.  Since 2007 he has shared with Salvini the post of 
vice secretary of LN.  Reguzzoni's first political job was in 
the city council of Busto Arsizio, where he served from 
1993-97 before being elected to the Varese provincial 
council.  In 2002 he was the youngest person elected as the 
president of Varese province, a politically influential 
province as it hosts Milan's Malpensa International Airport. 
Varese, as mentioned earlier, is also a key city in the LN 
mythology because it has produced several LN senior leaders. 
Reguzzoni served as president until 2008, when he stepped 
down to run -- successfully -- for the Chamber of Deputies. 
 
¶15. (C) Reguzzoni's father-in-law has family connections to 
Bossi and for this reason Reguzzoni was pulled into LN 
politics at a young age and is extremely loyal to Bossi. 
Like the others listed here, Reguzzoni was extremely popular 
in his administrative positions for his effective civic 
management style and ability to tackle popular issues. 
Although moderate in his rhetoric and policies, Reguzzoni has 
a personal and emotional bond to LN's core positions 
(particularly support for small business and fiscal 
federalism).  We believe that Reguzzoni could very well be on 
track for more senior regional political positions.  Despite 
his ties to Bossi and LN, however, we've not heard him spoken 
of as someone in line for a major national role in the near 
term. 
 
Comment: Will The Young Inherit the Party? 
 
¶16. (C) Naturally this cable does not look at all possible 
future leaders of LN.  However, it does give an idea of the 
factors that are key to moving up in the party: a Veneto or 
Lombardy background, loyalty to and a strong personal 
relationship with Bossi, and evidence of administrative 
competence.  Education is not essential, with these 
up-and-comers evenly split between college and high-school 
grads, nor is extensive Rome experience.  Finally, we should 
note that while LN apparently does see the value of grooming 
young talent for national success, something that the other 
Italian mainstream parties don't do as well, it's unlikely 
that when Bossi dies his immediate circle of older ""colonels"" 
will turn over the reins right away.
