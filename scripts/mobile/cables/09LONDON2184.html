(Ref)  In a follow-on conversation with Poloff on September 18, Evans stated that since U.S. Embassy Tripoli had already raised this matter with the GOL, he did not expect HMG to issue demarche instructions to UK Embassy Tripoli.  Evans said that HMG is in broad agreement with USG policy on this issue and wants to continue to work in close coordination with the USG on all Libya issues, which he described as "very sensitive at the moment."  Evans also noted that FCO's Libya desk would probably wait for guidance from UK Embassy Tripoli about whether a separate demarche would be constructive. HMG would most likely not issue an action request without prompting from UK Embassy Tripoli, he stressed.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
