¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  In a July 31 emergency session, the 
"General Committee of Egypt's People's Assembly" condemned 
Israel's "war crimes" and "American complicity with Israel in 
preventing the UNSC for carrying out its role."  The Arab and 
Foreign Affairs and National Security Committee of the Shura 
Council (the upper house of parliament) urged August 1 
"serious and swift efforts to reach an urgent and 
unconditional resolution by the UNSC on halting Israeli 
military operations inside Lebanon."  According to press 
reports, during an August 1 meeting of the influential NDP 
Policies Committee, NDP Secretary General Safwat al-Sherif 
condemned the Israeli attack on Qana as "a criminal massacre 
and a war of annihilation and state terrorism" and NDP 
Assistant Secretary General Gamal Mubarak reportedly 
"expressed rejection of ideas about a 'new Middle East'."  On 
August 1, the influential Judges Club and Egyptian Labor 
Union separately issued statements condemning Israel and the 
U.S., and the Arab Lawyers Union called for a boycott of 
American and Israeli products.  We anticipate that other 
groups, both governmental, opposition, and professional, will 
issue further such statements in the coming days.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.   (SBU)  An emergency meeting of the "General Committee of 
Egypt's People's Assembly" was convened July 31 by Ahmed 
Fathy Sorour, Speaker of the Parliament and ruling National 
Democratic Party (NDP) MP, following which Sorour made a 
statement "deploring U.S. connivance with Israel by 
encouraging its assault on Lebanon and hindering the UNSC's 
role." (Note: The General Committee is chaired by Sorour, and 
its membership is comprised of Zainab Radwan (Deputy Speaker 
of Parliament), Abdel Aziz Mostafa (Deputy Speaker of 
Parliament), NDP bloc leader Abdel Ahad Gamal El Deen, Al 
Wafd Party SYG Mahmoud Abaza, Mohamad Shaban (Tagammu Party), 
Zakareyya Azmy (NDP MP and President Hosni Mubarak's chief of 
staff), Mohammad Dakroury (appointed MP and Mubarak's 
lawyer), Mohammad Ramzy El Shaer (appointed MP), Farouk 
Ashour (NDP MP) and Kamal Ahmad (former Nasserite and current 
independent bloc leader) End note).  The emergency session of 
the General Committee followed the NDP MP's successful 
blocking of an effort by opposition and independent 
parliamentarians to force an emergency session of the full 
Parliament to debate the Lebanon crisis. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Following the emergency meeting, the General 
Committee issued a statement that: 
 
-- declared that permanent UN Security Council (UNSC) 
members, especially the United States, bear responsibility 
for violations of international law, and appealed to UN 
Secretary General Kofi Annan to call on the UNSC to shoulder 
 
SIPDIS 
its responsibility pursuant to Chapter Seven of the UN 
Charter; 
 
-- condemned American complicity with Israel in preventing 
the UNSC in carrying out its role; 
 
-- condemned Israel's "war crimes" that violate the Fourth 
Geneva Convention, warning of the dire consequences of the 
current crisis for the Middle East peace process; 
 
-- rejected the "new Middle East Project" which "some sides" 
are advancing at the expense of countries in the region; 
 
-- called on families of victims of Israeli attacks to file 
lawsuits in Belgium, France and Spain; 
 
-- emphasized the legitimacy of the actions of the Lebanese 
resistance against occupation; and 
 
-- rejected "fallacious" Israeli "pretexts" for the attacks, 
as well as Israel's claim of self-defense, describing it as 
"lacking legal justification." 
 
¶4. (C) In an August 2 meeting with poloff, NDP parliamentary 
bloc leader Abdel Ahad Gamal El Deen reviewed the General 
Committee's statement, and urged the U.S. to push for an 
immediate cease-fire. "I am angry and embarrassed by 
America's policy," he stated, lamenting that, "I am a friend 
of America, but I can't defend you now in front of Egyptians 
... where has the 'honest broker' gone?  Why have your 
principles, and your sense of justice vanished?  You are 
hurting your friends in the Middle East, not just yourself. 
 
CAIRO 00004760  002 OF 002 
 
 
It is in the interests of us all - the U.S., Israel, and your 
Arab supporters - that you change your approach, immediately." 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Media reports also note that the Arab and Foreign 
Affairs and National Security Committee of the Shura Council 
(the upper house of parliament) denounced the "Israeli 
carnage in Qana" during an August 1 meeting.  A statement 
released following the meeting, which was chaired by NDP 
Secretary General and speaker of the Shura Council Safwat 
 
SIPDIS 
al-Sherif, "asserted support for statements by President 
Hosni Mubarak, in which he called for avoiding any attempts 
to drag Egypt into an irrational and illogical conflict," and 
"asserted the need for serious and swift efforts to reach an 
urgent and unconditional resolution by the UNSC on halting 
Israeli military operations inside Lebanon."  The statement 
also called for the "unity of Arab ranks" and the need to 
activate "joint Arab action." 
 
¶6. (SBU) According to press reports, during an August 1 
meeting of the influential NDP Policies Committee, NDP 
Secretary General al-Sherif condemned the Israeli attack on 
 
SIPDIS 
Qana as "a criminal massacre and a war of annihilation and 
state terrorism."   NDP Assistant Secretary General Gamal 
Mubarak reportedly "expressed rejection of ideas about a 'new 
Middle East,' stating that they are just like previous ideas, 
aiming at dissolving the Arab identity and dragging the 
region into conflicts and alliances that do not achieve Arab 
interests." 
 
¶7. (SBU)  In the wake of the deaths at Qana, the influential 
Judges Club held an August 1 emergency meeting to discuss the 
Lebanon crisis, and issued a statement condemning the "Qana 
Massacre" and calling for Arab and Muslim states to pressure 
Israel "and its ally the United States," for an immediate 
cease-fire, withdrawal from Lebanon, an international trial 
of Israel for its military operations, and compensation for 
Lebanese civilian victims of Israeli attacks.  Also on August 
1, the Arab Lawyers Union called for a boycott of American 
and Israeli products, and urged Arab Chambers of Commerce to 
freeze relations with both the U.S. and Israel.  The Egyptian 
Labor Union issued an August 1 statement denouncing U.S. 
policy in support of Israel and U.S. "hegemony" over the UNSC 
and international organizations.  Also on August 1, a 
conference was convened by Egyptian First Lady Suzanne 
Mubarak at the National Council of Women, under the banner 
"Together for Lebanon and Palestine."  The gathering voiced 
solidarity with Lebanese women, and warned that the Israeli 
offensive "has become more like genocide ... the aggression 
is a violation of international law and human rights 
conventions set by the 'free world'."   We anticipate that 
other groups, both governmental, opposition, and 
professional, will issue further such statements in the 
coming days.
