</p><p>SUMMARY 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶1. (SBU) Your upcoming visit to Bogota and Cartagena is an 
opportunity to reassure the Colombians of our commitment to their 
fight against illegal drugs and illegal armed groups.  Colombians 
have begun to perceive our decision not to be baited by Venezuela's 
bellicose rhetoric and trade freeze as a failure to stand by an 
ally.  Your visit will be a welcome sign of our senior engagement 
and commitment to the bilateral relationship.  President Uribe's 
final decision whether to push for reelection remains the central 
chord of Colombian politics and will define the tone of 
congressional elections in March and the presidential elections in 
May.  Bilateral relations with Colombia remain solid but will be 
tested by our handling of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement 
(FTA) and the regional sensitivities to the Defense Cooperation 
Agreement (DCA).  Despite improving performance on human rights 
throughout Plan Colombia, there are continuing abuses and potential 
for backsliding, especially in the Colombian Army.  The Colombian 
Navy was rocked in November by the surprising reversal of an all 
but certain conviction against a rear admiral suspected of aiding 
narco-traffickers.  After rousing success against the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2008, progress against the 
guerrilla organization has plateaued; there are few prospects for 
peace in the near term.  Post has begun implementing the Colombia 
Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) -- a follow-on to Plan 
Colombia -- with greater focus on expanding state services in 
Colombia's ungoverned spaces where illegal armed groups and the 
illicit economy flourish.  End Summary. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>COLOMBIA IN TRANSITION 
</p><p>---------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶2. (SBU) Embassy Bogota welcomes the visit of Admiral Gary 
Roughead, United States Chief of Naval Operations on December 2-6. 
Colombian Naval CommanderAdmiral Guillermo Barrera Hurtado and 
Colombian Armed Forces Commander Freddy Padilla de Leon will also 
warmly welcome your visit to Colombia.  Colombia made a dramatic 
rebound from near-failed state to stable democracy over the last 
ten years.  Murder and kidnapping rates have dropped dramatically, 
while rule of law has strengthened through major judicial reforms. 
While Colombia still experiences serious problems with illegal 
armed groups, the conflict has ceased to be a threat to Colombia's 
national security and sovereignty. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶3. (SBU) Colombia's turnaround can be attributed to improvements in 
overall security, but further progress depends on resolving chronic 
issues such as high social inequality and land tenure.  Colombia 
has made significant inroads in confronting narco-terrorism, but 
drug trafficking organizations and illegal armed groups still 
operate in large parts of the country, including along borders. 
Colombia is finally feeling the effects of the global economic 
crisis, though the impact has been lessened by sound fiscal and 
monetary policies that have attracted foreign investment.  Growth 
rates are nil for 2009 but the GOC predicts 2.5% growth next year. 
Poverty rates have also decreased, though unemployment remains a 
major problem.  About 60% of the economy remains mired in the 
informal sector. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>REELECTIONS AND ELECTIONS 
</p><p>------------------------- 
</p><p>¶4. (C) The Colombian Congress passed a law in September permitting 
a referendum on whether President Alvaro Uribe may stand for a 
third term in the presidential elections on May 30, 2010.  The 
Constitutional Court must now rule on the referendum process and 
its impact on the Constitution, a decision that may not come until 
March 2010.  If the Court rules in Uribe's favor, a referendum must 
be held.  Uribe seldom speaks publicly of the referendum, 
characterizing it as a grassroots initiative of Colombian citizens. 
His popularity remains at 65% to 70% after more than seven years in 
office.  Privately, Uribe is doing everything possible to 
perpetuate his presidential career.  Elections to replace the 
entire Congress (166 Representatives and 102 Senators) will be held 
on March 14.  We expect the elections to run smoothly overall but 
are concerned about certain areas of violence and the influence of 
illicit funds during the campaign period. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>BILATERAL AND REGIONAL RELATIONS 
</p><p>-------------------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶5. (C) Colombia has been a staunch U.S. ally against the threats of 
narco-trafficking and terrorism.  We continue to enjoy a robust 
extradition relationship, though we were disappointed at the 
Supreme Court's decision to deny our requests to extradite the FARC 
operatives charged with taking hostage or attempting to harm U.S. 
citizens.  Colombia is our fourth largest export market in the 
region and a growing destination for U.S. investment.  Our close 
relations have tended to isolate Colombia in the region, especially 
with neo-populist governments such as Venezuela, which regularly 
paints Colombia as an agent of the United States.  This was 
underscored by the regional tensions raised by the DCA.  Despite 
our assertions that the DCA is strictly a bilateral issue, the GOC 
views the agreement as a strategic deterrent against President Hugo 
Chavez.  The Colombians are on the verge of restoring relations 
with Ecuador but have failed in efforts to enlist Brazil to offset 
the rhetoric of Chavez.  The Colombians have recently engaged in 
"security diplomacy," providing training and assistance to 
neighbors (such as Mexico and Haiti) suffering from drug 
trafficking and organized crime as well as to the international 
effort in Afghanistan via a deployment with Operation Enduring 
Freedom as early as the end of 2009.
</p><p></p><p></p><p>VENEZUELA ON THE MIND 
</p><p>--------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶6. (SBU) Colombian officials worry that Venezuela poses a growing 
military, economic, and covert threat.  The GOC has sounded alarms 
in response to Venezuela's arms purchases, all but open support for 
the FARC, and bellicose rhetoric -- including Chavez' statements to 
"prepare for war" and refusal to meet with that "mobster" Uribe in 
Brazilian brokered talks.  Caracas has blocked imports from 
Colombia, leading to border area confrontations and unrest.
Bilateral trade, once thought to be of sufficient volume to prevent 
conflict, has fallen over 70% in the last year, leaving local 
observers concerned that the constraints preventing conflict 
between the two states are dwindling.  Colombia has appealed to the 
UNSC, OAS and WTO for help, but seen little response.  Despite 
these incidents, we see no evidence that either side is actively 
preparing for hostilities.  However, as tensions along the border 
rise and perceptions skew, there is a small risk that a local 
incident could spiral out of control.  Real or not, the perception 
of the threat posed by Venezuela has changed Colombia's worldview, 
</p><p>causing them to seek ever greater assurances of our friendship and 
support. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶7. (SBU) While Colombians generally understand U.S. political 
realities associated with a vote on the FTA, resignation has grown 
within the government, business and academic communities over the 
lack of action on the accord.  The GOC remains committed to the 
agreement's passage, but worries that its efforts will turn out to 
be unsuccessful.  Business community members believe that long-term 
inaction on the FTA will be detrimental to U.S.-Colombian 
relations.  The great majority of organized labor is opposed to 
free trade agreements and argues that the GOC needs to do more to 
respect worker rights and to protect unionists from violence.  In 
2009, 34 unionists have been murdered as of November 17, which is a 
downward trend from the 49 murders in all of 2008.  President Uribe 
publicly adheres to the commitment President Obama made in their 
June 29 meeting to move the FTA forward in the U.S. Congress once 
labor and human rights issues are adequately addressed. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>HUMAN RIGHTS 
</p><p>------------ 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶8. (SBU) By nearly all measures, the human rights situation in 
Colombia has improved over the last ten years.  Serious human 
rights concerns remain, however, especially with regard to the 
Colombian military.  Last year's exposure of military "false 
positives," in which unarmed civilians were murdered and presented 
as combat deaths, led to the dismissal of 51 members of the 
Colombian Army.  We are concerned with the military's commitment to 
investigating these types of cases and its cooperation with the 
Prosecutor General's office.  The Prosecutor General's Office is 
currently processing more than 1,000 cases of extrajudicial 
executions; prosecutions have been slow but there is progress.  We 
are working with the Colombian military to improve their respect 
for human rights as they carry out security operations.  Impunity 
for human rights violations and past crimes carried out by 
paramilitary and guerrilla groups is a serious concern.  The GOC 
regularly stigmatizes NGOs as supporters of terrorist 
organizations, which human rights groups claim fuels growing death 
threats against them.  Revelations that Colombian intelligence and 
law enforcement entities carried out illegal surveillance against 
human rights groups, unionists and political opponents have also 
undermined the GOC's credibility on human rights.  Colombia has 
over three million internally displaced persons (IDPs). 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>Consternation Over Corruption in the Navy 
</p><p>----------------------------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶9. (SBU) A high profile narco-corruption case against a retired 
rear admiral appears poised for dismissal amidst controversy. 
Guillermo ArangoBacci was forced to retire in 2007 based on 
evidence that he had conspired with drug traffickers to help them 
evade U.S. and Colombian interdiction patrols.  Admiral Barrera 
took the additional step of referring ArangoBacci's case to the 
civilian Prosecutor General's Office for criminal charges; the case 
was nearing a guilty verdict by mid-2009.  On November 3, however, 
a new prosecutor assigned to the case petitioned the Supreme Court 
to absolve ArangoBacci on grounds that the investigation failed to 
prove the admiral's guilt.  To make matters worse, both the 
Prosecutor General's Office and the Inspector General's Office 
denounced the Admiral Barrera and other senior naval officers for 
falsifying evidence to frame ArangoBacci.  Ambassador Brownfield 
</p><p>publicly defended Admiral Barrera's actions in referring the matter 
to the civilian courts, which drew accusations of interference from 
one Supreme Court magistrate and the Colombian press.  However, it 
laid down the marker that we believe allegations of military 
corruption must be investigated--preferably in civilian courts. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>CONFLICT STALLED, PEACE DELAYED 
</p><p>------------------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶10. (S/NF) The GOC made dazzling progress against the FARC in 2008: 
the deaths of three Secretariat members, the liberation of 15 
prized hostages, including three Americans, and record high 
desertions.  Progress in 2009 has been sluggish, however, with the 
FARC carrying out asymmetrical attacks on selective soft targets as 
the Colombian military tries to grind them down in a slow war of 
attrition.  Some analysts have also pointed to lower operations 
tempo due to local commanders' concern of being accused of human 
rights abuses.  Sensitive reporting suggests the GOC is quietly 
probing the FARC and National Liberation Army (ELN) to open a 
dialogue, though these efforts appear to be far from fruitful.  We 
do not expect any serious progress on this issue until after the 
elections; the guerrilla groups will likely wait to see whether 
Uribe will repeat in office before considering a broader peace 
process. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>THE COLOMBIA STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶11. (SBU) To consolidate the gains of Plan Colombia, we have 
developed the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI), 
which meshes with Colombia's own National Consolidation Plan (PNC). 
Our efforts initially focus on three priority areas of on-going 
conflict, drug trafficking and social marginalization. PNC/CSDI has 
prioritized addressing the lack of state presence that enables coca 
production and illegal armed groups, and seeks to establish state 
presence in strategic, under-governed parts of the country.  The 
plan is centered on increasing territorial control in these areas 
to provide security for communities; to achieve permanent coca 
eradication; to transfer security responsibility to the police; to 
provide a wide range of socio-economic services to address the root 
causes of marginalization; and to improve the justice sector to 
mitigate illegality.  A major challenge to implementation is 
achieving strong, effective civilian leadership of the PNC.  The 
head of Social Action (Accion Social), Colombia's development 
agency, is the titular head of the PNC effort.  Civilian agencies 
have been reluctant, however, to devote their budgets to the 
effort, often leaving the Ministry of Defense organizationally in 
front.  Other obstacles include the need for a comprehensive GOC 
security strategy to transition from military to police in 
"consolidated" territories; more clarity on a post-eradication 
strategy; stronger presence of the justice sector in CSDI areas; 
and increased funding support for PNC ministries in the GOC budget. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>CARTAGENA AND COCAINE 
</p><p>--------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶12. (SBU) Cartagena holds many keys to the issues that will play a 
major role in Colombia's future.  With security issues largely 
resolved, the effectiveness of our CSDI efforts will likely become 
</p><p>evident in the Montes de Maria zone near Cartagena within a year. 
Drug traffickers have increasingly turned to seaborne shipments of 
drugs either in go-fast boats, self-propelled semi-submersible 
boats or hidden in commercial cargo.  Maritime counter-narcotics 
interdiction will be ever more vital to our efforts to combat drug 
trafficking.  Our joint efforts had unparalleled success in 2008, 
with record seizures of cocaine on the high seas, which coupled 
with a record year in eradication led to double digit increases in 
the price of cocaine in the U.S and decreases in its purity.
