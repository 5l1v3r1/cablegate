--------
</p><p>¶1. (C/NF) On July 26, UNIFIL Senior Adviser Milos Strugar
told econoff that UNIFIL suspected that the July 25 Israeli
airstrike on an UNTSO post near Khiam was deliberate. UNIFIL
had warned the IDF for several days that it was striking a UN
post. Close calls have been reported at other UN posts along
the Blue Line. Separately, UN Political Officer Georges Nasr
reported that Lebanese anger at the UN is growing. End
summary.
</p><p>ISRAELI FIRE KILLS
4 UN OBSERVERS
------------------
</p><p>¶2. (C/NF) On July 26, UNIFIL Senior Adviser Milos Strugar
confirmed to econoff that Israeli fire yesterday had killed
four UNTSO observers inside their post near Khiam. The four
dead UN observers included a Finn, an Austrian, a Canadian,
and a Chinese. Strugar reported that UNIFIL suspected that
the lethal Israeli attack was deliberate for three reasons.
First, Israel knew that the long-time UN post was there.
Second, the four observers were killed by two direct hits by
precision Israeli aerial bombs. It was not a near miss.
Third, the UN post had been receiving close and direct
artillery hits for three days and UNIFIL commander Maj. Gen.
Alain Pellegrini had warned the IDF that it was hitting a UN
post.
</p><p>¶3. (C/NF) Strugar continued that only luck has prevented
more such incidents. He said that there have been at least
14 incidents of Israeli artillery scoring near or direct hits
on UN posts along the Blue Line over the past ten days. In
one incident, an Israeli artillery shell landed in the middle
of a UN post, but luckily the shell was a dud.
</p><p>LEBANESE BLAME UN
-----------------
</p><p>¶4. (C/NF) UN Political Officer Georges Nasr told econoff on
July 26 that there was a palpable anger among Lebanese at the
UN. Many Lebanese hold the UN responsible for promising
Lebanese safe passage on southern roads, only to be bombed by
Israeli warplanes. The resulting gruesome images of civilian
casualties were widely published and displayed throughout
Lebanon. Even in Beirut, Nasr could feel increased
antagonism towards the UN.
