¶1. (C) Summary: GNZ reports that initial concerns that the Pacific 
Island Forum (PIF) would be derailed over tensions between Solomon 
Island and Australia regarding the Regional Assistance Mission to 
Solomons (RAMSI) were resolved by private dialogue among Leaders 
during retreat. The sessions between Assistant Secretary Hill and the 
Leaders was seen by GNZ as especially helpful.  The Leaders' 
communique, calling for review of RAMSI while endorsing its mission, 
kept momentum moving forward.  The PIF targeted energy, 
transportation and communications as areas for development and 
requested a progress report by 2007 Forum.  GNZ is developing visa 
scheme to enhance labor mobility for Pacific Islanders. 
 
¶2. (C) On November 1, ECONOFF discussed New Zealand's assessment of 
the outcome of the Pacific Island Forum (PIF) meetings with Heather 
Riddell, Director of the Pacific Division at Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  Despite GNZ's initial concerns that 
regional tensions would make the PIF meetings complex and 
contentious, the final results turned out better than expected.  The 
initial tension between RAMSI and the Government of the Solomon 
Islands (GOS), as well as Papua New Guinea's role in helping 
suspended GOS Attorney General Moti escape to the Solomons, were 
issues that GNZ feared could cause the Melanesian countries to take 
an "us vs. them" stance at the forum (see reftel).  Riddell explained 
that GOS's opening position was a strong demand for reform of RAMSI 
with greater regional discussion to obtain independent review of its 
mission and a call for an exit strategy.  Despite calls to also 
replace Forum Secretary General Greg Urwin as an anti-Australian 
gesture, Mr. Urwin's appointment was extended for another term. 
 
RAMSI Reaffirmed but Under Review 
--------------------------------- 
 
3 (C) Riddell maintained that derailment of the forum was prevented 
by a private retreat among the Leaders which ensured that cooler 
heads prevailed.  The Leaders formulated a communique expressing 
strong endorsement for RAMSI while simultaneously calling for close 
consultations with GOS and PIF.  Leaders also agreed to establish a 
taskforce to review RAMSI and report back to Foreign Ministers who 
will make recommendations to Leaders.  The consultative mechanism 
between the GOS, RAMSI and the PIF would be chaired by the 
representatives of the Forum Chair and involve senior representatives 
of the Forum Troika of past, present and incoming chairs.  The 
timeframe for these reviews remains vague but GNZ would prefer sooner 
rather than later. 
 
"Grass roots" Economic Priorities 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) GNZ supports Leaders call for efforts to intensify regional 
cooperation in relation to energy, transportation and 
telecommunications (ICT).  GNZ will be having additional 
consultations with the PIF Secretariat later this month to ensure 
that the adopted resolutions maintain traction.  Their hope is that 
specific implementing action occurs prior to next forum.  GNZ sees 
these economic sectors as having the greatest "grass roots" benefits. 
 
Labor Mobility - Seasonal Work Scheme 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Riddell reported that GNZ is currently working with their 
Immigration Dept. to implement a seasonal work scheme to encourage NZ 
farmers and vintners to employ Pacific Islanders as short term 
agricultural workers.  Under the new scheme, if accredited employers 
can demonstrate there are no Kiwis available to do the work, the 
Government will first consult with Pacific Island countries before 
making these jobs available to others.  This scheme is not to detract 
from current working holiday permits.
