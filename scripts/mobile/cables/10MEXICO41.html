¶1. (C)  Secretary for Public Security, Genaro Garcia Luna told the 
Ambassador that on Tuesday, January 5, President Calderon approved 
in a cabinet meeting the transfer of command and control 
responsibilities in Juarez from the military to the federal police. 
In separate discussions, both the Director General of CISEN, 
Guillermo Valdes, and the Secretary of the Navy, Admiral Saynez, 
confirmed to the AMB that President Calderon had authorized the 
change in command and control arrangements. 
 
 
 
¶2. (C)  The next step is for the Secretary of the Interior, 
Fernando Francisco Gomez Mont, to notify the Governor of the 
Chihuahua state that Calderon as approved these changes. Per MEXICO 
3617, the federal police had already sent a team to Juarez to 
outline the new arrangements to all the key players. The message 
from Gomez Mont will be that Calderon has instructed everyone to 
move forward. 
 
 
 
¶3. (C)  On Monday, January 11, SSP Commissioner Facundo Rosas Rosas 
will travel to Juarez to oversee the transfer of responsibilities. 
On January 14-15, a joint Mexico-U.S. assessment team will fly to 
El Paso and Juarez as part of the process of developing pilot 
projects in Tijuana/San Diego and Ciudad Juarez/El Paso. The GOM 
will be prepared to brief us on the early implementation of the new 
arrangements when the team arrives in Juarez on January 15.
