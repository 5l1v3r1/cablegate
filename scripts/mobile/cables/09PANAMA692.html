Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF) Panamanian Supreme Court Justice Adan Arjona told 
poloffs August 26 that President Martinelli personally called 
each of the nine justices of the Court to pressure them to 
vote in favor of reopening a corruption case in which over 30 
members of the Revolutonary Democratic Party (PRD) are 
implicated. Arjona called this "unprecedented" interference 
with the judiciary. Arjona said Martinelli also asked him to 
support the government's moves to change the contract terms 
on electric generating companies, including the U.S. company 
AES. Arjona said the Court would not defend these companies 
against such pressure, and that they would have to go to 
their embassies. Finally, Arjona said Martinelli told him he 
was going to fire Attorney General Ana Matilde Gomez, then 
denied to Arjona five days later that he had any problem with 
Gomez. Vice President and Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Varela 
told the Ambassador September 4 that the government had 
decided to stop pressuring Gomez to resign. End Summary 
 
--------------------- 
Judicial Interference 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C//NF)  On July 22 the Supreme Court (CSJ) decided to 
reopen the long stalled CEMIS case (ref A), implicating two 
CSJ justices and much of the current leadership of the PRD in 
a bribery scandal.  In a meeting with poloffs August 26, CSJ 
Justice Adan Arjona revealed that prior to the CSJ vote, 
Martinelli had called each of the CSJ Justices personally, 
and pressed for them to reopen the case. Arjona said that 
this was unprecedented, and that Martinelli was acting more 
like a king than a democratic president. He added that given 
Panama's weak institutions, it would be very hard to stop him 
from abusing his authority in this way. Arjona told poloffs 
that Martinelli was defending some of his actions by telling 
people he was acting on instructions from the U.S. embassy. 
Arjona advised that we reach out to people like VP/FM Juan 
Carlos Varela, Minster of Economy and Finance Alberto 
Vallarino, and Minster of the Presidency Jimmy Papadimitriu, 
because they were the only ones who could influence 
Martinelli. Everyone else, according to Arjona, was telling 
Martinelli what he wanted to hear in the hopes of 
ingratiating themselves to him. 
 
¶3.  (C//NF)  Arjona described a meeting he had with 
Martinelli on August 24. Arjona's ten year term on the CSJ 
Third Chamber (which hears cases against the government) 
expires at the end of this year, and he is anxious to be 
reappointed. According to Arjona, Martinelli asked for 
Arjona's support on the "electricity case," because the case 
would go to the Third Chamber if U.S. company AES challenged 
the GOP's unilateral changes to the contract terms. Arjona 
reported that he assured Martinelli of his support, noting to 
poloffs that the other members of the Chamber were so weak 
and corrupt that Martinelli would get what he wanted anyway. 
(Note: Arjona and many other sources have indicated that the 
other two members of the Third Chamber,  Winston Spadafora in 
particular, and Victor Benevides to a lesser degree, are 
corrupt. Spadafora had his U.S. visa revoked for his alleged 
involvement in illegal trafficking in people. End Note.) 
Arjona said that international companies whose contractual 
rights were violated would have to ask their Embassies for 
support in negotiating with the GOP, because the CSJ was not 
going to defy Martinelli. Arjona described Martinelli as "a 
Chavez" who did not want anyone to contradict him, and wanted 
to be free to do as he pleased. Arjona predicted that the 
measures Martinelli was taking to lower the cost of 
electricity would end up getting Panama sued in The Hague for 
breach of contract.

A/G Next? 
--------- 
 
¶4.  (C//NF)  In recent weeks the GOP's Anti-Corruption 
Coordinator, Martinelli's first cousin Fernando 
Nunez-Fabregas, has attacked Attorney General Ana Matilde 
Gomez for failing to prosecute high level corruption. The 
dispute stems from powers Nunez has been given so his office 
can investigate claims of corruption. Gomez has argued that 
these new powers are a violation of her writ as Attorney 
General. This has fueled speculation that Martinelli wants 
Gomez to step down so he can appoint his own A/G (Note: The 
A/G is named by the President, with the approval of the 
Assembly, to a ten year term, which does not coincide with 
the election cycle. Gomez was appointed by former president 
Martin Torrijos. End Note.) CSJ Arjona told poloffs that 
Martinelli said he was going to "get rid of" Gomez, and 
offered Arjona the job. However, Arjona later reported to 
DEAFSN that he spoke with Martinelli again on August 29, and 
Martinelli complained that the papers were falsely reporting 
he wanted to remove Gomez, then claimed he had no problem 
with the A/G. Arjona described Martinelli as "delirious" and 
"incoherent" as he denied something he had told him five days 
earlier. 
 
¶5.  (C//NF)  PRD Deputy Leandro Avila told poloff September 3 
that the Martinelli administration was putting political 
pressure on Gomez to investigate and prosecute high level PRD 
members. Referring to the recent jailing of former Minister 
of Education Blgis Castro on charges of corruption, Avila 
said that it was totally legitimate to investigate him, but 
that the decision to jail him was the result of political 
pressure from the government, as jailing a former minister 
was a powerful symbol that its anti-corruption drive was for 
real. He noted that Nunez' office was now looking at the 
money the Torrijos administration made available to PRD 
Deputies to carry out public works projects in their 
districts from the Social Investment Fund (FIS) as a possible 
case of corruption. Avila said that this has been common 
practice for years, and that claiming it was an example of 
corruption widened the net of possible "corruption" cases so 
much that it began to look a lot like political persecution. 
He said that Gomez was a tough and independent figure, and 
that he did not believe she would allow this to take place. 
He said that she could become a powerful independent 
balancing force to control the Executive. 
 
------------ 
Safe For Now 
------------ 
 
¶6.  (C//NF)  On September 4 VP/FM Juan Carlos Varela -- 
unprompted -- told the Ambassador over lunch that the GOP was 
no longer trying to remove Gomez from office, as Martinelli 
had realized that doing so would damage Panama's image. He 
said the President and Gomez were now going to focus on 
rooting out police corruption. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  (S//NF)  Arjona is widely regarded among Panama's civil 
society as a champion of judicial independence and probity. 
His reports of judicial interference by Martinelli are 
extremely disturbing. Even more disturbing is Arjona's 
assumption that he cannot possibly be re-appointed unless he 
indicates complete loyalty to Martinelli, even though Arjona 
has been a very successful justice. His reports of 
Martinelli's inconsistent stories and mercurial nature track 
with what Post has observed. With regard to the A/G, while 
she has not been very effective, she heads the only 
trulyindependent institution in Panama. Post will report 
septel on other institutions in Panama, and our proposed 
strategy moving forward.
