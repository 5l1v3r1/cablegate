</p><p> ¶1.  (SBU) Summary: As part of outreach efforts during recent 
</p><p>friction in U.S.-Argentine relations, Ambassador held 
</p><p>one-on-one discussions with key players on the Argentine 
</p><p>scene.  In each, he explained the U.S. perspective on discord 
</p><p>over the Miami court case and on bilateral relations. 
</p><p>Interlocutors expressed strong support for the U.S. position 
</p><p>and offered to help quietly.  Almost to a person, they said 
</p><p>the GoA's overreaction reflected a limited understanding of 
</p><p>the U.S. and things international, the very small circle of 
</p><p>decision-makers for key issues, and the penchant for the 
</p><p>Kirchners to respond aggressively to perceived challenges and 
</p><p>make up afterwards.  Interlocutors anticipated the GoA's 
</p><p>reconciliation efforts with the USG, noting the Kirchner 
</p><p>regime's need for U.S. and international investment/financing 
</p><p>and the fact that, while anti-Americanism plays well in 
</p><p>Argentina, serious conflict with the United States does not. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (SBU) Interlocutors were also fairly united in their 
</p><p>views on the challenges facing the government: controlling 
</p><p>inflation and wages and dealing with public security concerns 
</p><p>related to rampant street crime.  Many noted that the new 
</p><p>government has yet to break out of the short-term framework 
</p><p>for policy-making which characterized Nestor Kirchner's 
</p><p>government and suggested that Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
</p><p>(CFK) had yet to demonstrate that she will govern in a manner 
</p><p>distinct from that of her husband.  End Summary. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (SBU) The following are highlights of individual 
</p><p>conversations over the past three weeks.  Topics covered 
</p><p>include GOA decision-making style, economic policy making, 
</p><p>inflation, salary negotiations, investment policy, public 
</p><p>security challenges, anti-Americanism, corruption, oil and 
</p><p>energy policy, and regional security concerns. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Bank President 
</p><p>-------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4.  (SBU) Clarisa Lifsic is President of the Banco 
</p><p>Hipotecario, Argentina's second largest bank in terms of net 
</p><p>worth.  She has an MBA from MIT and represents private 
</p><p>shareholders in this formerly state-owned mortgage bank. 
</p><p>Private shareholders control the majority of seats on the 
</p><p>board, but various public entities still control over 50% of 
</p><p>Hipotecario's stock following its ""de-nationalization"" in 
</p><p>¶1997.  While the bank used to specialize in mortgages, it is 
</p><p>now a full service bank and has been expanding rapidly in 
</p><p>recent years. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5.  (C) She sees the main challenge to the Argentine economy 
</p><p>and the banking system as getting inflation under control. 
</p><p>The GoA's interventionist anti-inflation policy, including 
</p><p>freezes in public utility tariffs and ""voluntary"" price 
</p><p>stabilization agreements on a sizeable basket of consumer 
</p><p>goods, has just hidden a very serious problem. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6.  (C) The government has displayed little understanding of 
</p><p>how to expand credit markets for medium- or long-term loans. 
</p><p>Just before the elections, the government got banks to pledge 
</p><p>to issue small enterprise and mortgage loans at less than the 
</p><p>cost of money at that time.  The banks signed because the 
</p><p>head of the Banking Association (see para. 12) assured them 
</p><p>that the government just wanted the headlines and would never 
</p><p>check to see if the loans were issued.  The government has no 
</p><p>long-term vision or plan about generating a mortgage market, 
</p><p>for example.  You don't do that by telling banks they have to 
</p><p>make loans at a loss, she said.  You create policy structures 
</p><p>and make funds available in the way Mexico did to begin 
</p><p>expanding home mortgages. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7.  (C) The appointed government members of the Banco 
</p><p>Hipotecario Board of Directors have been weak.  The last two 
</p><p>were friends of former Finance Minister Felisa Miceli's 
</p><p>siblings.  One was an architect, who knew nothing about 
</p><p>banking, and the other was an accountant, but he still asked 
</p><p>where the mortgages were kept on his initial tour of the 
</p><p>bank.  Much time had to be spent educating them both on 
</p><p>basics and keeping them informed of what issues and topics 
</p><p>meant.  Similarly, the lack of coordination and clear lines 
</p><p>of responsibility within the government mean that a great 
</p><p>deal of time has to be spent going individually to each actor 
</p><p>in the government who might influence the bank's policy to 
</p><p>brief them on new policies or strategic decisions by the 
</p><p>bank. 
</p><p>It is a very time-consuming process. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8.  (C) One of the great failings of GOA policy has been its 
</p><p>very short-term focus.  There has been hope that CFK may 
</p><p>change that.  She asked a number of individual economists and 
</p><p>economic players to write longer term strategy papers for 
</p><p>her.  She has also told at least one person that she intends 
</p><p>to create a committee charged with developing a longer term 
</p><p>economic vision for Argentina.  So far, however, there have 
</p><p>not been any clear signs of more focus on the longer term. 
</p><p>There is also no clear sign so far that the government will 
</p><p>implement the ""social pact"" between labor, business and the 
</p><p>government which CFK discussed in her electoral campaign. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>International Banker and Financier 
</p><p>---------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9.  (SBU) Guillermo ""Willy"" Stanley is a board member of 
</p><p>Macro Bansud, one of Argentina's largest banks, former 
</p><p>President of Citibank Argentina, and Director of D&G, a 
</p><p>consulting and investment firm that owns Havanna, a very 
</p><p>successful Argentine cookie and coffee bar company.  Stanley 
</p><p>noted that his companies have been prospering with 
</p><p>Argentina's economic growth.  Havanna sales have grown 7% 
</p><p>over the past year.  It now has 30 stores in other parts of 
</p><p>Latin America and hopes to open a store in the United States. 
</p><p> Macro Bansud's deposit base has been growing steadily in 
</p><p>recent years, loans are booming, and the bank has been able 
</p><p>to borrow significant amounts at excellent rates in Europe 
</p><p>over the past year. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10.  (C) Inflation is the biggest challenge facing the 
</p><p>government.  The inept price control policies of Commerce 
</p><p>Secretary Guillermo Moreno have made the problem much more 
</p><p> 
</p><p>SIPDIS 
</p><p>serious than it needed to be.  By destroying the credibility 
</p><p>of the national statistics agency, INDEC, and by using 
</p><p>offensive pressure tactics to try to control prices, the 
</p><p>government has raised inflationary expectations for most 
</p><p>economic actors.  Rather than what easily could have been 
</p><p>inflation hovering around 13%, now most sectors have 
</p><p>(self-fulfilling) expectations that inflation will be 20-25%. 
</p><p> This has repercussions across the economic spectrum as 
</p><p>recent union claims for wage increases demonstrate. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11.  (C) The government's repeated focus on the short-term is 
</p><p>also taking its toll.  There had been hope that CFK would 
</p><p>bring about a change in her husband's focus on the immediate, 
</p><p>but decisions are still being made by the same small group 
</p><p>and with no evident shift from the near-term political 
</p><p>motivation for most decisions. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Banking Association President 
</p><p>----------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (SBU) Jorge Brito is president of Banco Macro, 
</p><p>Argentina's largest bank by several measures, and president 
</p><p>of the association of Argentine-owned private banks, ADEBA. 
</p><p>Macro has over 7,000 employees and 440 branches operating in 
</p><p>many provinces.  It has enjoyed over 20 consecutive 
</p><p>profitable quarters. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (C) In Brito's view, Argentina's economy is well placed 
</p><p>to weather the current international turmoil, but the 
</p><p>domestic banking sector will still be squeezed by the higher 
</p><p>cost of international capital, as money retreats from 
</p><p>perceived risk.  The government needs to start letting prices 
</p><p>rise on energy and key services and start to give more 
</p><p>signals to encourage investment.  The key in the near term 
</p><p>will be where salary negotiations end up. If they end up 
</p><p>granting higher than 20% raises, for example, that will 
</p><p>seriously fuel inflationary expectations and produce 
</p><p>dangerous effects throughout the economy.  If the final set 
</p><p>of raises average less than 20%, the effects will probably be 
</p><p>manageable.  The government needs to adopt a new set of 
</p><p>policies for tackling inflation.  The price limits and other 
</p><p>controls were supposed to be in place only for the short 
</p><p>term, but clearly, after more than a year in practice, they 
</p><p>are not working. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶14. (C) Brito observed that the banking sector is growing 
</p><p>well, with Banco Macro having a 40% growth in loans last year 
</p><p>for example.  But the key to continued domestic economic grow 
</p><p>is job creation, and much of that will only come if new 
</p><p>domestic investment, especially by SMEs, is affordable.  The 
</p><p>government has started again to urge private banks to make 
</p><p>loans at low interest rates, but how, he asked rhetorically, 
</p><p>can a bank make a five year loan at 7% if it has to give 10% 
</p><p>to get 60 day deposits?  Only if the government finds a way 
</p><p>to offer a guarantee or something like a rate subsidy, can 
</p><p>private banks lower rates.  So far, he said, the government 
</p><p>has not come up with workable ideas or mechanisms. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶15. (C) Brito noted that Argentina still suffers from having 
</p><p>a large part of the money flow in the economy taking place in 
</p><p>the informal system.  Only about 65% of the money flows in 
</p><p>the formal system.  The rest is off the books, and many 
</p><p>entrepreneurs are fighting hard to keep it that way, as it 
</p><p>allows them to save about 25% that would otherwise go into 
</p><p>retirement and health benefit payments.  The rural economy 
</p><p>also has much of its transactions taking place through 
</p><p>informal, untaxed transactions, he said.  Brito added that he 
</p><p>and his association looked forward to working further with 
</p><p>the USG on better controls for money laundering and against 
</p><p>terrorist finance. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Political Pollster and Professor 
</p><p>-------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶16.  (SBU) Manuel Mora Y Araujo is currently Professor in the 
</p><p>Masters in Journalism program at the Di Tella University and 
</p><p>in the Masters in Political Science program at CEMA 
</p><p>University.  He is also the Director of the International 
</p><p>Center of Public Opinion of Torcuato Di Tella Institute and 
</p><p>director of the local polling firm IPSOS, among many other 
</p><p>activities. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶17.  (SBU) He argues that the government will be judged by 
</p><p>how well it handles the problems of inflation and public 
</p><p>security.  People are deciding how happy they are depending 
</p><p>on how much money they have to spend in their pockets, what 
</p><p>they can buy with it, and how safe they feel carrying their 
</p><p>money around.  CFK's poll numbers have improved since her 
</p><p>inauguration, in part because people feel they are doing well 
</p><p>in their personal lives and give her the benefit of the doubt 
</p><p>at the moment. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶18.  (C) CFK's overreaction to the U.S. court case and Nestor 
</p><p>Kirchner's ill-fated trip to Colombia as ""guarantor"" of a 
</p><p>hostage release doesn't weigh heavily, because most of the 
</p><p>Argentine public do not care that much about foreign affairs. 
</p><p> Plus, in the case of the United States, playing the 
</p><p>anti-American card pays off initially.  Governments have to 
</p><p>be careful, however, as the population doesn't like being in 
</p><p>conflict with the United States - a strange (but, from our 
</p><p>perspective, salutary) counterpoint to the anti-Americanism. 
</p><p>Thus, in this case as in many past ones, the best U.S. 
</p><p>response to an anti-American outburst by an Argentine 
</p><p>government is not to fuel the fire but just to keep calmly 
</p><p>explaining the U.S. point of view. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶19.  (C) CFK intellectually knows the value of having a 
</p><p>long-term vision and implementing it, but she is short-term 
</p><p>in her political outlook and practice, he said.  She and her 
</p><p>husband share that outlook, but she is still more interested 
</p><p>in exploring new concepts and new countries than her husband. 
</p><p> That might be an advantage. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶20.  (C) It is far from clear that CFK will implement the 
</p><p>""social pact"" that she talked about between labor, capital, 
</p><p>and government over how to keep the economy growing without 
</p><p>disruption for the years ahead, according to Mora Y Araujo. 
</p><p>We have not heard much of the concept from CFK and getting 
</p><p>something like that done will take a great deal of political 
</p><p>effort and capital - no signs of plans to do that so far. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶21.  (SBU) Di Tella University's 50th Anniversary:  Many 
</p><p>events are planned for this year.  The university would like 
</p><p>to coordinate on some joint work with the Embassy on bringing 
</p><p>in speakers and working with U.S. universities, for example. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>German Ambassador 
</p><p>----------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶22.  (C) Regarding the Paris Club debt, German Ambassador 
</p><p>Wolf Rolf Schumacher said that until the crisis with the USG, 
</p><p>the Germans were getting strong messages that the new GoA 
</p><p>wanted to move pretty rapidly on solving the debt, but since 
</p><p>early December the GoA has gone silent.  The Germans think 
</p><p>this is because the GoA knows that the USG will be an 
</p><p>obstacle unless relations improve.  They expect the GOA to 
</p><p>move ahead if relations with the U.S. improve. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶23.  (C) Many German companies are doing quite well selling 
</p><p>into this market, but most are not making big new 
</p><p>investments.  Volkswagen is an exception.  Its local CEO (and 
</p><p>former Austrian Chancellor) Victor Klima has gone out of his 
</p><p>way to court CFK, using his connections in Europe with good 
</p><p>results.  Siemens has found the Argentines eager to purchase 
</p><p>its turbines.  As far as the Embassy can tell, all of the 
</p><p>energy deals are on the up and up.  However, corruption is 
</p><p>widespread.  One German CEO went into see Planning Minister 
</p><p>De Vido to complain that one of his deputies had solicited a 
</p><p>bribe and the CEO had refused.  De Vido reportedly took no 
</p><p>interest in getting the name of the offending official but 
</p><p>instead recommended the CEO film and record the next bribe 
</p><p>solicitation. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶24.  (SBU) Germany's Max Planck Institute has decided to 
</p><p>build its own regional center in Buenos Aires adjoining the 
</p><p>new GoA science center.  This will be only the second 
</p><p>overseas institute location for Germany, and Buenos Aires was 
</p><p>chosen because of the consistently high quality of students 
</p><p>and researchers who travel from Argentina for training and 
</p><p>scholarships at the Institute in Germany. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶25.  (C) The German Ambassador noted that it had been a big 
</p><p>challenge to get Chancellor Merkel to agree to meet with CFK 
</p><p>several months ago during CFK's visit to Germany, given the 
</p><p>reputation of the Kirchner government in Germany.  But Merkel 
</p><p>agreed to do so in part because of signs that CFK might bring 
</p><p>about some changes.  However, so far there are no real 
</p><p>changes evident.  Decisions are still made by the same small 
</p><p>group.  The clash with the United States, he opined, shows 
</p><p>that advice from outside that group (e.g., from the Foreign 
</p><p>Minister) is not sought or heeded.  The focus is still on the 
</p><p>short-term and political, rather than on medium- and 
</p><p>longer-term goals.  Relations with other countries are still 
</p><p>not highly valued, even if CFK has a personal interest in 
</p><p>travel and in meeting other leaders.  It is not an impressive 
</p><p>start. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Defense Businessman, Publisher, Ex-Montonero 
</p><p>-------------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶26.  (C) Mario Montoto is involved in defense and security 
</p><p>industries, publishes a monthly magazine on defense and 
</p><p>international affairs issues called DEF, and is an ex-advisor 
</p><p>to the head of the Montonero guerrillas.  He is now very 
</p><p>pro-U.S. and does business with Israel.  Montoto says the 
</p><p>crisis with the USG is rooted in the limited perspectives of 
</p><p>the key decision-makers.  For example, the Vatican is 
</p><p>refusing to accept the GoA nominee for ambassador, former 
</p><p>Justice Minister Irribarne, because he is a divorced and 
</p><p>remarried Catholic.  The key decision-makers did not consider 
</p><p>that a 2000-year-old institution that has opposition to 
</p><p>divorce for Catholics like Irribarne as one of its key 
</p><p>principles might have a problem with this nominee.  In the 
</p><p>case of the Miami arrests, it took the key GoA figures a 
</p><p>while to figure out that these were not orchestrated by the 
</p><p>USG.  Montoto said he had raised this ""mistake"" with the head 
</p><p>of Argentine intelligence, Justice Minister Anibal Fernandez 
</p><p>and others, arguing that the GoA action was an embarrassment 
</p><p>and runs against Argentina's strategic interests.  He said 
</p><p>Anibal Fernandez quietly whispered in his ear that he agrees. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶27.  (C) Montoto said he is working hard to raise 
</p><p>consciousness in Argentina and the region about the dangerous 
</p><p>arms build-up by Venezuela which he believes emboldens Chavez 
</p><p>to make bellicose statements against neighbors like Colombia. 
</p><p> He said this build-up also spurs similar purchases by 
</p><p>Brazil.  Meanwhile, Argentina's military is severely 
</p><p>under-funded.  This means that the United States is 
</p><p>strategically more important than ever to Argentina, and the 
</p><p>GoA should reinforce its defense dialogue and cooperation 
</p><p>with the U.S., not limit it.  He said he argues with GoA 
</p><p>officials about this.  He also said he had a very frank talk 
</p><p>with former President Nestor Kirchner recently where he 
</p><p>warned the ex-president about the inapplicability of Chavez' 
</p><p>model for Argentina and about being careful not to become 
</p><p>captive to Chavez.  NK listened but did not concede the 
</p><p>points, Montoto said. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶28.  (C) On public security, Montoto said he believes 
</p><p>Argentines in greater Buenos Aires are going to judge their 
</p><p>government on how well it controls crime and returns peace to 
</p><p>the neighborhoods.  This is the reason that Buenos Aires 
</p><p>province governor Daniel Scioli, whom Montoto advises, has 
</p><p>just rolled out a big effort to get more police on the 
</p><p>streets: he wants to show his voters that he is acting boldly 
</p><p>on this serious problem.  Montoto said he just worked out the 
</p><p>broad outlines of an agreement between the State of Rio de 
</p><p>Janeiro and the Province of Buenos Aires to share experiences 
</p><p>and expertise on public security.  Montoto said he has told 
</p><p>Scioli that he believes Buenos Aires may face the same 
</p><p>serious problems as Rio in a couple of years if firm action 
</p><p>is not taken now.  Of course, the other part of the solution 
</p><p>is job creation, and that is why Scioli is also taking a 
</p><p>number of steps to promote SME creation and to attract 
</p><p>investment, including from the United State. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Fund Manager, Entrepreneur, and Real Estate Magnate 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶29.  (SBU) Eduardo Elsztain is the founder of Dolphin Fund 
</p><p>Management (with several very large U.S. partners), President 
</p><p>of IRSA Inversiones y Representationes (real estate), and 
</p><p>Cresud (livestock), among many other activities.  He is an 
</p><p>active civic leader and active in the NGO Endeavor which 
</p><p>promotes young entrepreneurs. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶30.  (C) Elsztain argues that the key to understanding 
</p><p>Argentine economic developments is to realize that it's the 
</p><p>concrete that matters (e.g., real estate, not financial 
</p><p>instruments).  Right now, the key factor is salaries - how 
</p><p>will the government negotiate new salary caps with the 
</p><p>unions.  Argentina is well-placed to weather current economic 
</p><p>problems in the world.  ""I would rather have a populist 
</p><p>government with a good fiscal policy and reserves, than a 
</p><p>liberal government with a big deficit.""  But, it will be very 
</p><p>important what policy signals the government sends to 
</p><p>investors. This government is on the right side of the 
</p><p>""private property"" debate compared to Chavez, but it is not 
</p><p>yet clear that it will come up with the right set of 
</p><p>policies.  If it does, plenty of capital will flow here. 
</p><p>Essential to sustain such capital flows will be the justice 
</p><p>system and sanctity of contracts.  Elsztain noted that his 
</p><p>investments in Brazil are currently valued three times higher 
</p><p>than similar investments in Argentina in good part because 
</p><p>people have more faith in the enforceability of contractual 
</p><p>agreements in Brazil.  Still, investments in solid things 
</p><p>such as real estate and gold are good, and he will pursue 
</p><p>some additional mining investments in Argentina, for example. 
</p><p> (The strength of the Brazilian Real is also a factor in 
</p><p>Brazilian values, he noted.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶31.  (SBU) Elsztain said he had just donated a computer

</p><p>Oil Man and Entrepreneur 
</p><p>---------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶32.  (C) Jorge Estrada is a Colombian-Argentine-American who 
</p><p>started his career as a successful oilman and has 
</p><p>subsequently branched out successfully in many other areas. 
</p><p>In his view, inflation is the key issue facing the new 
</p><p>government, with the real figure probably somewhere around 
</p><p>18%.  The government has been sending all the wrong signals 
</p><p>to the oil and gas sector.  At present, for example, wealthy 
</p><p>households pay less for gas than do the poorest, who are 
</p><p>compelled to pay world prices to buy bottled gas for their 
</p><p>homes.  While the government has been able to raise a lot of 
</p><p>money through its export taxes, the result is that the price 
</p><p>market does not work effectively, and production and 
</p><p>investment are distorted in agriculture as well as oil and 
</p><p>gas.  The government should move to new taxing and pricing 
</p><p>schemes, he opined; it could still collect more taxes via 
</p><p>income taxes rather than using the export taxes.  Right now, 
</p><p>the Argentine economy is well-placed to support such economic 
</p><p>reforms.  Demand for Argentina's commodities is high, and 
</p><p>will remain so for a couple of years. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶33.  (C) At present, it is not yet clear that the government 
</p><p>is ready to introduce significant reforms.  Nestor Kirchner 
</p><p>seems to still call many of the shots, and the government 
</p><p>seems to function in the same way as it did when he was 
</p><p>president.  There is still no evident long-term vision.  GOA 
</p><p>reactions to events are often based on domestic political 
</p><p>calculations, and there is little appreciation of other 
</p><p>countries.  All of this was evident in the reaction to the 
</p><p>court case in Miami.  As for the suitcase money itself, it 
</p><p>was probably coming in for some under-the-table deal, he 
</p><p>commented, but not likely for CFK's own campaign.  She had 
</p><p>plenty of campaign money flowing in from various sources in 
</p><p>country, including the government. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶34.  (C) As for overall corruption, it seems as bad or worse 
</p><p>than under Menem.  In the oil area, two old friends of Nestor 
</p><p>Kirchner have won many of the concessions offered publicly: 
</p><p>the bidding rules were designed so they would win.  Also, 
</p><p>Nestor Kirchner has been a master at using state revenue to 
</p><p>build alliances with governors and mayors.  Kirchner has used 
</p><p>his combative style (characteristically followed by a 
</p><p>subsequent embrace) to build a set of alliances founded on 
</p><p>mutual interests and fear.  With Argentine supermarket owner 
</p><p>Coto, for example, he first criticized him harshly, almost 
</p><p>forced him to go broke, and then saved his business.  Coto is 
</p><p>now an ally.
