¶1.  (S) Summary:  During a pre-election trip to Cucuta 
(septel will detail electoral issues), an Army commander told 
poloff that COLMIL forces were prohibited from crossing the 
Venezuelan border to pursue guerrilla high value targets 
(HVTs), in contrast to his counterparts on the Ecuadorian 
border, where incursions are permitted.  Army and Police 
commanders described the easy flow of narcotics across the 
border into Venezuela and up through the Maracaibo Bay. 
According to the Governor and DAS (FBI equivalent) director, 
President Chavez had recently cut off the flow of contraband 
gasoline into Cucuta, creating hardship.  Poloff learned of 
President Chavez's likely visit to the Venezuelan side of the 
Cucuta border area on March 9 and the request by leftist 
Representative Gustavo Petro to have a local security detail 
in Cucuta the same day.  By all local accounts, Chavez is 
attempting to fortify the left in Colombia.  End Summary. 
 
COLMIL: NO HOT PURSUIT OF HVTS 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (S) During a March 1-4 visit to Cucuta, Norte de 
Santander Department, poloff met with Army (COLMIL), National 
Police (CNP), Administrative Security Directorate (DAS), and 
local government officials to discuss border issues.  Col. 
Jose Fernando Mejia Araujo, deputy commander of the roughly 
6000-man 30th Army Brigade, described the state of play with 
regard to pursuit of high value targets (HVT) of the FARC and 
ELN.  Mejia stated that military commanders in Bogota had 
repeatedly instructed COLMIL forces along the border against 
"hot pursuit" of HVTs into Venezuela.  Mejia described a 
recent line of sight (he estimated 300 meters) of FARC 
commander Rodrigo Londono Echeverri (alias Timochenko) across 
the border in the vicinity of "Tres Bocas."  While awaiting a 
go-ahead order from Bogota, Mejia indicated that a Venezuelan 
military helicopter landed near the FARC group and appeared 
to unload supplies for the guerrillas.  He lamented that a 
stand down order came shortly after from Bogota.  Mejia noted 
that he has virtually no formal ties to counterparts in 
Venezuela, except for an occasional cellular phone call. 
 
INCREASING FARC PRESENCE 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (C) Mejia welcomed the recent arrival of a 900-man mobile 
brigade (Number 15) in hopes of rooting out illegal armed 
group presence in the conflictive Catatumbo region of the 
northern half of Norte de Santander Department.  He stated 
that the demobilization of the majority of AUC forces in the 
area had allowed the FARC to return in large numbers.  Mejia 
continued that the fertile and material-rich area (African 
palm, rice, and coal) was attractive for illegal armed 
groups, and that the GOC was playing catch-up.  Mejia, joined 
by DAS Director Mauricio Rosales, claimed the FARC sends 
regular multi-ton cocaine shipments through the Catatumbo 
area, into Venezuela, and up through the Maracaibo Bay and 
out via the Caribbean. 
 
SEIZURE OF SUPPLIES HEADED FOR FARC 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Just prior to meeting with poloff, CNP deputy 
commander William Moctezuma presided over a press conference 
announcing the seizure of munitions and uniforms destined for 
the FARC.  Poloff viewed roughly 400 army-style uniforms and 
some 200 grenades.  According to Moctezuma, CNP intelligence 
indicated that the seized truck had originated in Bogota, and 
that the source of the bootleg uniforms was being 
established.  Moctezuma also detailed joint COLMIL/CNP 
protection activities for Congressional candidates and for 
March 12 elections (septel). 
 
THE GASOLINE DYNAMIC 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Governor Luis Miguel Morelli and Colombian Consul in 
San Antonio (Venezuela) Luz Stella Yanez, in separate 
meetings in Cucuta, described President Chavez's recent order 
(approximately one month ago) to restrict the contraband 
crossing of cheap (by Colombian standards) Venezuelan 
gasoline into the Cucuta region.  In a tour of the Colombian 
side of the border in the late afternoon of March 2, poloff 
witnessed hundreds of vehicles waiting to fill their tanks at 
"international" gas stations just across the border in 
Venezuela. 
 
CHAVEZ VISIT TO BORDER AREA? 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Yanez and Morelli (separately) advised poloff of 
President Chavez's planned visit to the cities of San Jose 
Urena and San Antonio on March 9.  They noted that Chavez 
rarely visits the Venezuelan side of the Cucuta border area. 
Rosales confided to poloff a request he received from leftist 
Representative (and Senate candidate) Gustavo Petro for a GOC 
protective detail in Cucuta on March 9.  Rosales was 
convinced Petro would cross into Venezuela to meet publicly 
with Chavez (but without his Colombian security detail). 
Yanez described the active search for votes in her consular 
district by leading leftist Colombian politicians, Petro 
included. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (C) While many in Cucuta feel that Chavez is fomenting 
the Colombian left, it remains to be seen what effect, if 
any, it will have in the March 12 Congressional elections, as 
the leading leftist party, the Alternative Democratic Pole 
(Polo, or PDA), has only limited electoral support both 
nationally and in the region.  Local political actors are 
fixated on Chavez, and conspiracy theories abound. 
Congressional candidates of the U Party (pro-Uribe) told 
poloff they were concerned that party head (and anti-Chavez) 
Juan Manuel Santos, due in town that evening for a political 
rally, would make a negative statement about Chavez that 
would hurt Cucuta economically.  To our knowledge, Santos 
made no mention of Chavez publicly in Cucuta.
