¶1. (U) Summary:  President Uribe called for a special 
congressional session only 30 minutes before the normal close 
of Congress on December 16, allowing his supporters to push 
through the second of four required votes on the presidential 
reelection referendum bill.  The language in the bill would 
allow for reelection in 2014, not in 2010--but GOC supporters 
told us they will use the next two congressional votes to try 
to amend the bill to allow for an immediate run.  The U and 
Conservative Parties succeeded in pushing through the vote 
only after direct intervention by Uribe--marking the first 
time the president has engaged to push for the third term 
measure.  Still, the bill will face strong resistance from 
the opposition Liberal and Polo Democratico Parties, as well 
as from the "rebel" coalition party Cambio Radical, when 
Congress resumes in March, 2009. End Summary. 
 
Third Term Proposal Half Way Through Congress 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) On December 16, the last day of the regular 2008 
Congressional year, the House of Representatives approved in 
full session a bill allowing for a possible second reelection 
of President Alvaro Uribe.  The December 16 session was 
extended due to a extraordinary decree signed by Uribe and 
read to the plenary attendees just 30 minutes before the 
ordinary session was set to end at midnight.  The 
extraordinary House session resumed just after midnight on 
December 17 to debate and vote on the referendum proposal. 
Cambio Radical President German Vargas Lleras told us earlier 
on December 16 that he expected the bill to fail given the 
GOC's lack of lobbying effort on behalf of the referendum. 
The proposal approved in the House would allow reelection in 
2014, not in 2010.  U Party leaders favor a 2010 run and U 
Party members told us that in March they will try to change 
the proposal's language to allow immediate reelection in the 
two remaining votes in the Senate First Commission and later 
the full Senate.   The Liberals and Cambio Radical only 
support a 2014 proposal. 
 
¶3. (U) The vote and special session occurred only after 
intense lobbying by GOC ministers and Uribe's direct 
intervention--his first.  The vote went forward as the 
National Election Commission (CNE) continued an investigation 
into the finances of the signature collection effort that 
brought the proposal to Congress.  In an unprecedented show 
of support for the third term proposal, eight GOC ministers 
attended the December 15 and 16 debates, led by Interior and 
Justice Minister Fabio Valancia Cossio.  Secretary General of 
the House Jesus Rodriguez told us that Congress received 
approval from the Registrar's Office to include the third 
term bill in the December 16 session while the investigation 
continued. 
 
Attempts to Postpone Fail, but Criticism Continues 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4. (U) The Liberals and Polo--as well as GOC coalition party 
Cambio Radical--tried to delay the debate on the referendum 
until March 2009 and questioned the legality of the 
extraordinary session and vote.  Liberal Party Spokesman 
Carlos Piedrahita said the session was "irregular and 
possibly illegal."  Polo Representatives German Navas and 
Wilson Borja claimed the vote was illegal, since the CNE had 
not yet concluded their investigation on financing of the 
proposal.  An opposition/Cambio Radical attempt to postpone 
the vote until March was soundly defeated.  Cambio Radical 
Representative and House President German Varon criticized 
Uribe for intervening only at the last second.   Cambio 
Radical representatives reportedly said the Party may 
consider breaking with Uribe's coalition. 
 
Uribe Finally Shows His Cards 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Uribe and GOC intervention to push for the special 
session represented the president's first formal display of 
 
support for the new reelection effort.  It began with 
Valencia, who had previously been under presidential orders 
to remain on the sidelines of the third term effort, pushing 
for a vote on December 10, and culminated with the December 
16-17 lobbying effort in Congress by eight ministers and the 
presidential decree for a special session of Congress to 
allow the vote.  Still, Palace spokesmen and their supporters 
claimed they only wanted to "facilitate the initiative of 
millions of Colombians who signed a petition in favor of a 
referendum on reelection."
