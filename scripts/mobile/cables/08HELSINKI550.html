¶1. (C) Summary.  PolOff met with MFA Unit for the European 
Union Common Foreign and Security Policy Director Leena-Kaisa 
Mikkola to discuss GAERC points on December 5. On the 
question of enlargement, she stated that the Western Balkans 
will be part of a general discussion and Turkey will be 
encouraged to adopt further protocols as soon as possible. 
She thought the outcome of discussions on the Middle East may 
simply be a restatement of the EU's current position. 
Mikkola noted that the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
discussion would be on general support for MONUC and not on 
additional EU multi-national personnel participation. She 
said that Pakistan made the agenda prior to the attacks in 
Mumbai but that now the discussion on how the EU could 
influence Pakistan, as key to regional security, would be 
more serious.  End Summary. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) WESTERN BALKANS: The Finnish MFA expects little 
detailed discussion on Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Mikkola said 
that this meeting should cover only committee conclusions for 
the region. Further discussion on Bosnia and Herzegovina may 
take place early next year. The entire region will be 
discussed as part of the enlargement package conclusions. The 
temporary stabilization association agreement (SAA) between 
the EU and Serbia will be supported even though Serbia is not 
fully cooperating with the ICTY. The Netherlands insists on 
full cooperation before a full SAA can be executed; the 
December 12 report will most likely find cooperation 
incomplete. The MFA expects a short discussion on EULEX in 
Kosovo, which was to start in December and has kept to its 
timetable.  The EU will probably thank Serbia for its 
cooperation on Kosovo in relation to the transition to EULEX. 
 The EU,s agreement with the UN on EULEX has had Belgrade,s 
support.  Per Mikkola, Croatia could better cooperate with 
the ICTY and the EU will welcome progress, but will also list 
areas requiring extra effort.  No specific year will be 
provided for Croatia. 
 
¶3. (SBU) TURKEY:  Mikkola said that the EU will emphasize 
Turkey,s strategic importance and regret that it has not 
made more progress on political reforms.  The EU will urge 
Turkey toward good relations with its neighbors, ask that 
Turkey implement additional protocols as soon as possible, 
and urge Turkey to support reunification negotiations in 
Cyprus. 
 
¶4. (C) MIDDLE EAST:  Mikkola noted that the Middle East has 
not been discussed much under the French presidency.  She 
stated that the progress on the ground has been disappointing 
and that they are hearing pessimistic reviews from the 
region. The EU is questioning whether to increase its direct 
dialogue in order to get leverage over Israel but that a lot 
is dependent on the upcoming Israeli elections.  Mikkola 
expects a conclusion reiterating the current position. She 
also said that the Israeli-Palestinian issue is rumored to be 
on the agenda for the European Council next week. 
 
¶5. (SBU) DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC):  On the DRC, 
Mikkola commented that the conclusions will support MONUC but 
she does not expect a common policy on additional European 
participation in deployment.  Belgium may provide additional 
personnel.  Mikkola also noted that the human rights 
situation caused specific concerns over child soldier 
recruitment and treatment of women. 
 
¶6. (SBU) PAKISTAN:  Mikkola noted the EU's intention to 
intensify relations with Pakistan adding that Pakistan was on 
the agenda before the Mumbai incident.  She said that 
Pakistan is seen as key to regional stability and expects 
serious discussion on how the EU might influence and 
encourage the region. 
 
¶7.  (U) WTO:  Mikkola made no comments on the WTO Doha Round.
