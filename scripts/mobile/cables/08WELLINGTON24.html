 ¶1.  (C)  Summary.  During her January 14 meetings with 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) officials, 
Undersecretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs 
Paula Dobriansky highlighted the recent successful 
discussions in Bali, underscored USG support for a 
multilateral approach to climate change in the post-2012 
period, and applauded the close bilateral cooperation between 
the U.S. and New Zealand on a range of issues covering the 
environment, Antarctica, human rights and democracy and 
governance.  U/S Dobriansky also highlighted the strong 
premium the USG places on interfaith dialogue and public 
diplomacy programs to counter radicalism among youth.  On 
January 15, the Undersecretary met with Sir Geoffrey Palmer, 
New Zealand's Whaling Commissioner, who urged the US to use 
its influence with Japan to see a diplomatic resolution to 
Japanese whaling policy.  In all of her meetings, the 
Undersecretary paid tribute to Sir Edmund Hillary and 
expressed USG condolences at his passing.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Undersecretary Dobriansky was accompanied by S/P 
staff member Dean Pittman; Embassy Charge d'Affaires David 
Keegan and Pol/Econ Counselor also participated in MFAT 
meetings. 
 
Meeting with MFAT CEO Simon Murdoch 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  MFAT CEO Simon Murdoch met on January 14 with 
Undersecretary Dobriansky to preview the Prime Minister's 
views on a range of foreign policy issues in advance of the 
US' meeting with the PM on January 15.  Murdoch led off with 
climate change and global warming, noting that the PM had 
attended APEC and the East Asian Summit (EAS) meetings in 
late 2007 and was struck by the prominence of climate change 
at both meetings -- the EAS had focused on energy security in 
2006 but the recent meeting had seen a significant shift in 
priority to emissions reductions.  The GNZ thought the Bali 
meetings had been constructive, and New Zealanders want to 
know what the climate change policy center of gravity in the 
US will be over the next several years.  He added that for 
the Labour Party, the PM led a domestic policy review in the 
past year on New Zealand's approach toward climate change; 
with 2008 being an election year, the issue will remain very 
important to the Prime Minister.  On Bali, Dobriansky 
characterized the outcome as a success, noting that she had 
met with Minister for Climate Change David Parker while in 
Indonesia. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Afghanistan is also an important issue to New 
Zealand, and the PM believes the international community's 
strategy must focus on both a military approach as well as 
the development of political institutions, remarked Murdoch. 
On human rights matters, the US and New Zealand are largely 
of the same mind, continued Murdoch.  The PM supported UNSG 
Special Representative Ibrahim Gambari's participation at the 
EAS leader luncheon.  Murdoch allowed that GOS PM Lee Hsien 
Loong had to "drag comments" on Burma out of the Indian and 
Chinese leaders.  Within the region, Murdoch said that New 
Zealand has strong views on good governance.  Democracy in 
the post-colonial period is rather fragile, as the second 
generation leaders in the Pacific islands struggle with 
governance issues.  Murdoch underscored GNZ appreciation for 
cooperation in this regard with the USG.  Undersecretary 
Dobriansky noted that the USG values cooperation with the GNZ 
on the human rights situations in Burma, Fiji, and North 
 
WELLINGTON 00000024  002 OF 008 
 
 
Korea.  Murdoch stressed New Zealand's concern for the future 
of the Pacific islands, which are increasingly turning away 
from Australia and New Zealand to seek ties with Taiwan, 
China, Cuba and others.  The Undersecretary responded that 
the USG wants to collaborate with NZ on more practical 
approaches to democracy within the region, and is pleased 
that the GNZ has indicated a willingness to join the Asia 
Pacific Democracy Partnership (APDP).  She added that she had 
appreciated that Phil Goff, while serving as foreign 
minister, has briefed her on his visit to Tibet, since as 
Tibet coordinator she could not travel there. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Murdoch also emphasized the PM's support for 
counterterrorism (CT), particularly the soft side of the 
GNZ's CT approach that encompasses interfaith dialogue and 
the UN initiative on dialogue among civilizations.  New 
Zealand is a firm supporter of the Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI), intelligence sharing, and CT efforts in 
Afghanistan.  However, the GNZ -- and the PM in particular -- 
also considers religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue 
programs to be an important component of New Zealand's 
overall approach, which is conducted with Australia and 
Indonesia.  Domestically, such soft support helps the PM 
within the non-centrist left of the Labour Party, added 
Murdoch, which is very critical of US policy towards Israel. 
In conjunction with the UN dialogue project, New Zealand has 
hosted a regional meeting that produced a report addressing 
disaffected youth; the report was presented to the EAS for 
funding consideration and commitment, said Murdoch. 
 
¶6.  (C)  Undersecretary Dobriansky agreed that CT efforts 
should include hard and soft tactics and programs; the USG 
has a number of interfaith initiatives incorporated into US 
efforts in Afghanistan.  Also important is the role of Muslim 
democracies, such as Indonesia, which are represented in the 
Community of Democracies, said Dobriansky.  Dean Pittman 
added that the USG is working on a number of initiatives to 
combat radical Islam, particularly among young people, as 
part of our "war of ideas."  The United States would welcome 
the opportunity to collaborate with New Zealand on these 
efforts.  The Undersecretary stressed that the USG welcomes 
other countries taking the lead on such issues and applauded 
GNZ efforts.  She agreed that progress in Afghanistan will 
rely not only on assistance funds and military action, but 
also on education, an open media, political institutional 
development and many practical aspects of developing a 
democratic society, including academic exchanges.  Murdoch 
noted that NATO will host a special meeting on Afghanistan in 
Bucharest at the 2008 NATO Summit in late April; the PM plans 
to attend and has been critical that the Europeans have not 
delivered adequately on the military side.  Murdoch also said 
that the GNZ is considering how to "lift" the New Zealand 
civilian presence in Afghanistan to match the GNZ PRT 
contribution but no decision has yet been made. 
 
¶7.  (C)  Returning to the environment and climate change 
issues, Murdoch informed the USG visitors that New Zealand's 
foreign policy used to be centered on trade; while trade 
remains an important issue, the GNZ now also takes into 
account environmental concerns and resource depletion. 
Concerning the latter, the GNZ is concerned about the future 
of the southern oceans due to overfishing, illegal fishing, 
seabed mining, bio-prospecting in and around coral reefs, and 
the increasing encroachment further south into Antarctic 
waters of commercial fishing.  Undersecretary Dobriansky said 
that the USG shares these concerns and wants to work with the 
GNZ on White Water to Blue Water initiatives, and overfishing 
and sustainable management of ocean resources.  Murdoch 
 
WELLINGTON 00000024  003 OF 008 
 
 
responded that the US as a world leader in public-private 
partnerships, scientific research and responsible public 
policy can have an impact on rapidly developing countries 
that need tangible environmental policies.  Murdoch offered 
that the USG support for the Antarctica program beginning in 
the 1950s was instrumental to the successful cooperation over 
the past half century; the GNZ could not have afforded it at 
the time and would not be able to continue now without USG 
help. 
 
MFAT Roundtable 
--------------- 
 
¶8.  (C)  In a follow-on roundtable meeting chaired by MFAT 
Deputy Secretary Carolyn Forsyth, GNZ officials discussed a 
range of environmental issues and good 
governance/democracy/human rights matters of importance to 
the bilateral relationship.  In Antarctica, Forsyth noted the 
excellent US-NZ cooperation, discussed the wind energy 
generation proposal for McMurdo, and referred to NZ's 
contribution to the logistics pool.  Trevor Hughes of MFAT's 
Antarctic Policy Unit discussed two key concerns of the GNZ 
in the Antarctic region:  expansion/diversification in 
tourism and illegal fishing in the Convention on the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) 
zone.  Regarding tourism, Hughes pointed out that the numbers 
of tourists coming to Antarctica have grown exponentially -- 
now at 35,000 in the Treaty area; 10 years ago the numbers 
were only 10% of that figure.  Hughes remarked that the GNZ 
has been grateful for the policy coordination between New 
Zealand and the US in Antarctic treaty meetings, and for the 
recent USG-proposed resolution to limit landings of groups of 
500 or more people on the continent.  Environmental issues 
surrounding tourists are also of concern to the GNZ, 
continued Hughes, as the number of ships lacking ice 
protection is growing.  In addition, 40% of the tour ships in 
Antarctica are flagged to countries that are not treaty 
partners, said Hughes, adding that the M/S Explorer, which 
sank off the coast of Antarctica in November 2007, was 
flagged to Liberia.  Undersecretary Dobriansky agreed that 
tourism was an issue that needed to be addressed -- perhaps 
at the next Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings; Pittman 
suggested that the next consultative group meeting in Kiev in 
June 2008 could look at enforceable protocols.  Hughes noted 
that New Zealand places observers on all tourism vessels 
passing through NZ ports to ensure compliance with treaty 
obligations.  He added that some South American countries run 
small hotels in Antarctica to fund their research programs. 
 
¶9.  (C)  On illegal fishing and destructive fishing 
practices, Carolyn Forsyth was pleased that the US and NZ 
cooperate in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management 
Organization; she applauded the Organization's establishment 
of interim measures during the April 2007 meetings in Chile. 
New Zealand assesses the oceans and fish stocks as in a poor 
state and there is increasing pressure in the southern 
oceans.  Trevor Hughes pointed to specific problems in the 
Antarctic seas and damage to toothfish stocks, offering that 
Hong Kong and Spanish fishing syndicates are the worst 
offenders and that most of the fishing masters aboard the 
illegal fishing boats are of Spanish nationality.  He added 
that the illegal fleets are using gill netting in the Indian 
Ocean region below Australia but are being monitored by 
Australian and French authorities; he worries as they are 
pushed from that zone the fleets will move to the Ross Sea. 
Undersecretary Dobriansky responded that one approach to 
addressing the problem would be the actual implementation of 
the 2006 UNGA resolution on destructive fishing practices. 
 
WELLINGTON 00000024  004 OF 008 
 
 
She agreed with the GNZ analysis of the illegal fishing 
problem, noting that improved surveillance and information 
sharing is needed.  (Note:  The New Zealand media on January 
17 reported that a blacklisted fishing vessel flagged to 
Sierra Leone and operated by a Spanish company was reported 
in the Ross Sea CCAMLR zone; the GNZ reported the incident to 
CCAMLR.  End Note.) 
 
Climate Change and Sustainability 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (C)  Turning to climate change and Bali, Carolyn Forsyth 
said that the GNZ was pleased there was agreement under the 
UNFCCC and glad the USG is part of the new negotiations.  She 
noted the differences between the US and NZ concerning 
deforestation.  Developing countries have moved to the point 
of quantifiable, verifiable emissions measures, she observed, 
and New Zealand hoped the Major Economies Meeting under US 
auspices would feed into UNFCCC.  Dobriansky offered that the 
US was pleased that developing countries are part of the 
negotiating process post-2012 and that the Major Economies 
Meeting would complement and not compete with the overall 
UNFCCC process.  She underscored that there is united 
bipartisan support in the U.S. for the major economies 
initiative.  The Undersecretary emphasized USG support for 
the elevation of mitigation and adaptation discussions and 
the financing of technological transfers.  She agreed that 
differentiation discussions are also timely as there are 
significant differences between large, middle-income 
countries such as Brazil and small island states.  In looking 
at the longer term global goals, inclusion of the major 
economies is crucial, as China is overtaking the US in 
emissions, added Dobriansky.  She noted that the Ad Hoc 
Working Group meeting in March/April 2008 will be important. 
Pittman underscored the importance of countries such as New 
Zealand adding their voices in support of a climate change 
agreement that includes all major emitters, not just 
developed countries. 
 
¶11.  (SBU)  Carolyn Forsyth discussed sustainability in New 
Zealand, and the GNZ's goal of becoming the first society to 
be truly sustainable.  The policy is multifold, drawing in 
businesses, government procurement, waste minimization, and 
households.  Six government agencies are scheduled to become 
carbon neutral by 2012, noted Forsyth.  Yvonne Lucas from the 
Ministry of Economic Development explained that the GNZ is 
placing emphasis on both the public and private sectors; 
there is great activity on energy efficiency and improved 
environmental outcomes, but the GNZ is still wrestling with 
coordination issues.  Undersecretary Dobriansky congratulated 
GNZ officials for their sustainability approach, noting that 
New Zealand can be a model for other countries.  She 
applauded New Zealand for hosting UN Environment Day in June, 
and announced that the US would host the Washington 
International Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC) in March 
and would welcome GNZ participation.  In a subsequent meeting 
with New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark (septel), 
Dobriansky on behalf of the Secretary invited her to attend. 
 
 
Pacific Islands 
--------------- 
 
¶12.  (C)  Moving to Pacific island governance issues, MFAT 
Pacific Director John Adank briefed the Undersecretary on GNZ 
views towards the southern Pacific region.  The succession of 
coups in Fiji has been worrisome, said Adank, and the GNZ has 
seen the challenges of reinstating democracy in the lead up 
 
WELLINGTON 00000024  005 OF 008 
 
 
to the March 2009 elections.  The international community 
should ensure the Fiji interim government puts in place the 
necessary milestones to achieve successful elections; the GNZ 
worries that the interim government is trying to change the 
constitution before the elections, noted Adank.  The Pacific 
Island Forum results from Tonga in 2007 were not encouraging, 
he added.  New Zealand and others should promote an 
environment whereby the Fijian people believe elections will 
take place; the current environment on the island suggests 
the military is firmly in control, said Adank. 
Undersecretary Dobriansky mentioned that the USG had found 
Cape Verde to be a useful partner to the Timor Leste 
electoral process as both were small islands.  Adank said a 
major concern is the Fiji interim government's promotion of a 
People's Charter and a review of the Fijian constitution, 
which only an elected government should do.  He added that PM 
Clark had sent a detailed letter outlining the GNZ's views on 
the Charter to Frank Bainimarama.  Both Adank and Dobriansky 
agreed that women's participation in elections was important. 
 Carolyn Forsyth added that Pacific Island politicians do not 
always see themselves as accountable to the people they 
represent.  Dobriansky updated MFAT officials on the Mali 
Community of Democracies discussion surrounding the Asia 
Pacific Democracy Partnership. 
 
Tibet 
----- 
 
¶13.  (C)  Undersecretary Dobriansky outlined the interactions 
between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials over the past 
six years, and noted that these meetings still had not 
translated into practical results.  The Dalai Lama would like 
to see three issues addressed by the GOC:  environmental 
sensitivity, economic development that aids Tibetans and not 
just Han Chinese, and an immigration policy that preserves 
Tibetan culture and religion, which is threatened by the 
influx of Han Chinese into Tibet.  The Dalai Lama would also 
like to make a pilgrimage to Beijing as well as Tibet, said 
Dobriansky.  MFAT Director for Asia David Taylor asked 
Dobriansky if there was a way in which the GNZ and USG might 
work together in the lead up to the 2008 Olympics to pressure 
Beijing vis-a-vis Tibet; the Undersecretary promised to 
reflect on the question and get back to New Zealand 
officials. 
 
Burma 
----- 
 
¶14.  (C)  On Burma, Undersecretary Dobriansky underscored the 
importance of this issue to the USG and the President's 
personal commitment to continue the pressure on the military 
regime.  Carolyn Forsyth noted that Rangoon's leaders had 
made some initial concessions after the crackdown but there 
was little interest in genuine reform.  Nigel Moore of MFAT 
offered that New Zealand had put in place visa sanctions in 
2003, was considering economic sanctions (although these 
would have little to no tangible impact), and that China, 
India and the ASEANs were key to applying pressure to 
Rangoon's leadership.   Although New Zealand has not favored 
UN Security Council involvement up to this stage, PM Clark is 
now considering support for UNSC action.  Undersecretary 
Dobriansky said that within the Council there exists greater 
support than one year ago, and that the USG has pressed both 
China and India. 
 
North Korea 
----------- 
 
 
WELLINGTON 00000024  006 OF 008 
 
 
¶15.  (C)  The Undersecretary thanked the GNZ for its help on 
North Korea.  MFAT's David Taylor noted that the GNZ ensures 
that human rights issues figure in their conversations with 
North Korean officials and that FM Winston Peters raised 
human rights during his visit to Pyongyang in November 2007. 
GNZ officials asked for an update on USG actions to remove 
North Korea from the state sponsors of terrorism list and if 
there had been a lifting of any trade sanctions under the 
Trading with the Enemy Act. 
 
PKO and CT Issues 
----------------- 
 
¶16.  (C)  Wayne Higgins, Director for International Defense 
Relations at the Ministry of Defense, briefed the 
Undersecretary and Dean Pittman on the status of GNZ 
peacekeeping deployments in Afghanistan, Timor Leste and the 
Pacific region, Lebanon, and other parts of the globe. 
Higgins noted that New Zealand's armed forces have focused on 
"niche" contributions, but that the GNZ is commited to 
international peace and security.  Pittman noted USG 
appreciation for the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction 
Team (PRT) contribution in Bamiyan Province, Afghanistan, and 
asked if the New Zealand public remained supportive of New 
Zealand's work in Afghanistan; Higgins replied affirmatively 
and added that Singapore had contributed medical and dental 
officers to the Bamiyan PRT, just as New Zealand the GOS had 
worked in Timor Leste.  Pittman pointed out that New Zealand 
was aready very active in support of international 
peacekeeping efforts and said it would be a natural for the 
GNZ to join the Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative 
(GPOI).   Finally, Undersecretary Dobriansky discussed TIP 
issues and prospects for US-NZ cooperation on TIP issues of 
mutual concern through the establishment of a joint working 
group.  MFAT officials said that New Zealand is "on the same 
page" as the US with respect to trafficking in persons, and 
New Zealand is placing a great deal of emphasis on TIP in 
their immigration and labor departments. 
 
¶17.  (C)  Carolyn Forsyth briefed Undersecretary Dobriansky 
about GNZ efforts to promote interfaith dialogue and how 
these dovetail with counterterrorism security outcomes.  New 
Zealand, Australia, and Indonesia began a regional interfaith 
program in 2004 following the first Bali bombing; meetings in 
the Philippines and most recently (May 2007) in New Zealand 
have followed.  Forsyth underscored that the meetings are not 
about religion; rather, participants seek to empower 
moderates and marginalize radicalism.  One of the positive 
outcomes of the regional meetings has been improved Muslim 
networks between countries and discussion about a Muslim 
intra-faith meeting.  New Zealand hopes to implement the 
action plan put forward during the May 2007 meeting, she 
said.  Looking to the UN Alliance of Civilizations (AOC) 
initiative, Forsyth mentioned that the absence of a USG 
contribution garnered some criticism from speakers to the 
October 2007 meeting in Spain.  The GNZ interest in the AOC 
is largely confined to practical projects on media, 
education, and youth.  Dobriansky responded that the USG also 
appreciates the practical elements of the AOC but has noted 
politicization within the Initiative.  She said that the USG 
has a number of lessons learned from US-led interfaith 
initiatives that may be relevant to the GNZ; both she and 
Pittman agreed that S/P would discuss these initiatives with 
the New Zealand Embassy in Washington, particularly the War 
on Ideas and ways to move Muslim youth away from radicalism. 
 
 
US Dobriansky Meets Whaling Commissioner Palmer 
 
WELLINGTON 00000024  007 OF 008 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶18.  (C)  NZ International Whaling Commissioner (and former 
PM) Sir Geoffrey Palmer, accompanied MFAT Environment 
Division Director Jan Henderson met with US Dobriansky and 
Dean Pittman on January 15 to discuss GNZ concerns with the 
IWC and Japanese whaling policy.  Palmer urged the USG to use 
its influence with Tokyo to seek resolution of Japanese 
whaling policy and the GOJ's role within the IWC, which 
Palmer characterized as a "dysfunctional" organization that 
has lost credibility as an international body among many 
diplomats due to Japanese vote buying and a membership that 
includes landlocked countries with no interest in whaling. 
In New Zealand, Palmer underscored that the anti-whaling 
movement is strong and the new Rudd government in Australia 
has taken a tougher stance on whaling by threatening legal 
action at the International Court of Justice.  New Zealand 
believes that a legal case at the ICJ will probably not 
succeed and a diplomatic solution is needed; the Japanese 
government needs to get something out of any GOJ decision to 
curtail its so-called scientific research approach to 
whaling, said Palmer, who added that the scientific loophole 
needs to closed. 
 
¶19.  (C)  Undersecretary Dobriansky offered that the USG and 
GNZ have good collaboration on whaling and both share a 
pro-conservation approach to the issue.  She agreed to meet 
with US Commissioner Hogarth as well as Deputy Secretary 
Negroponte to discuss and solicit ideas.  Palmer said that 
with New Zealand in an election year and public opinion 
staunchly opposed to whaling, no NZ politician can support 
any level of whale slaughter; privately, he conceded that 
there may be a sustainable harvest that can be applied to 
some whale species.  He applauded the work of Remi Parmentier 
and the Pew Environment Group and noted that even Greenpeace 
is not opposed to a deal with the Japanese; the Latin 
American countries are firmly opposed to whaling.  Palmer 
proposed that the GNZ and the USG work towards what would 
comprise a resolution during the March 6-8 IWC Intersessional 
meetings in London in the lead up to the annual IWC meetings 
in Chile in June.  Dobriansky said that she would confer with 
Washington officials and Japanese experts on her return to 
Washington. 
 
US Dobriansky Meets Human Rights Commission Chairman 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶20.  (SBU) Also on January 15, Undersecretary Dobriansky met 
the Chairman of the New Zealand Human Rights Commission, 
Rosslyn Noonan, in Auckland.  At Dobriansky's request, Noonan 
reviewed the independent commission's mandate to advocate 
human rights and encourage harmonious relations among groups 
within New Zealand as well as to receive and seek to resolve 
complaints.  Since 2001, it has placed a particular emphasis 
on the concerns of Maori over inequitable implementation of 
the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, signed between the Crown and 
Maori chiefs.  The Commission participates in UN Human Rights 
Commission meetings separate from the New Zealand Government. 
 While international activities have not been a major part of 
its efforts, it has worked to strengthen the capacity of the 
often small and understaffed human rights commissions in the 
Pacific.  This year the Commission will undertake, at the 
request of the GNZ, a project with the Philippine military 
and police to enhance their adherence to human rights 
principles in carrying out their duties.  The New Zealand 
Police will assist by providing specific training to the 
Philippine police in handling violence against women.  In 
response to U/S Dobriansky's question about whether the 
 
WELLINGTON 00000024  008 OF 008 
 
 
commission had established a counterpart relationship in the 
U.S., perhaps with the Civil Rights Commission, Noonan said 
that they had contacts with NGOs and state and local 
commissions.  She agreed it would make sense to reach out to 
the federal level as well. 
¶21.  (U)  Undersecretary Dobriansky and S/P policy officer 
Dean Pittman have cleared this message.
