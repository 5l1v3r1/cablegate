¶1. (SBU) Summary: As has become customary with 
non-governmental organizations' sponsored public events, on 
August 8 FSLN mobs attacked members of civil society who 
attempted to assemble peacefully.  Over 500 members of the 
Coordinadora Civil (CC, a network of left-of-center civil 
society organizations) attempted to walk from the Hotel 
Hilton Princess in downtown Managua to the Managua Cathedral 
to cap off their annual national assembly.  However, FSLN 
sympathizers carrying pipes, rocks, and other makeshift 
weapons blocked the CC members along the route, as well as on 
the Cathedral's premises.  The FSLN-led violence resulted in 
approximately 15 people injured and various vehicles damaged. 
 In an attempt to excuse the violence, President Ortega 
claimed his supporters were led to violence by the members of 
the civil society.  The Nicaraguan National Police present 
took no action and allowed the FSLN mobs to carry out its 
violence.  End Summary.

FSLN, Government Employees Lead Violence 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) On August 8, the Coordinadora Civil (CC) celebrated 
its annual national assembly, in which its delegates approved 
a "Proposal to the Nation to Change the Country's Direction" 
(a proposal to address Nicaragua's political, social and 
economic problems).  After the assembly in southern Managua, 
over 500 delegates were transported by vehicle to a 
central-Managua intersection near the Hotel Hilton Princess 
where they were to walk approximately one mile to the Managua 
Cathedral for a cultural celebration.  The Managua 
Archdiocese previously had authorized the use of its premises 
for the CC event.  Mirna Meza, CC Director for the City of 
Leon and a participant in the CC event, told us that 
approximately 100 sympathizers of the Sandinista National 
Liberation Front (FSLN) were already waiting for the CC group 
when they arrived at the intersection and began throwing 
rocks at the buses transporting the delegates.  The FSLN mobs 
also threatened the civil society members with pipes, rocks, 
and other makeshift weapons.  Due to the violence, some CC 
members fled the area, but others continued their walk to the 
Cathedral.  The FSLN members then drove around the march to 
the Cathedral to once again block the CC's event.  At the 
Cathedral, the FSLN mobs again attacked the CC members. 
Their actions occurred both on public land and on the 
Cathedral's premises.  Fifteen people were injured and 
several vehicles were damaged in the violence. 
 
¶3.  (C) The FSLN mobs were composed of the Managua City 
Hall's Ecological Brigades and Sandinista Youth.  Media 
reported, and Meza confirmed, the participation of several 
government employees, including: Meyling Calero Peralta, 
Executive Vice President of Nicaragua's Tourism Institute, 
and Candida Huete Baca, Managua City Councilwoman.  Violeta 
Granera, a CC member, stated that the FSLN supporters were 
augmented by members of well-known Managua gangs.  There were 
press reports that the FSLN mobs used government vehicles to 
move from the Managua intersection to the Cathedral.

Ortega Excuses Violence, Police Facilitates It 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In a public speech the evening of August 8, 
President Daniel Ortega excused the FSLN-led violence.  He 
stated that his supporters were celebrating the International 
Day of the World's Indigenous People, but were "confronted by 
people who supported the coup in Honduras."  (Note: The CC 
 
MANAGUA 00000794  002 OF 002 
 
 
has publicly condemned the "coup" in Honduras and called for 
the reinstatement of President Mel Zelaya.)  Media reported 
that the only Honduran connection to the August 8 incident 
was the presence of Zelaya's jeep (with Honduran license 
plates), which was used to support the FSLN mobs.  Ortega's 
explanation of the FSLN supporters was contradicted by 
members of the mob that attacked the CC.  One FSLN 
sympathizer involved in the violence did not mention World 
Indigenous Day, but rather told media that his group was 
simply "celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Sandinista 
Revolution." 
 
¶5.  (C) Unfortunately the presence of police at the 
intersection and Cathedral did not prevent the violence, but 
rather facilitated it.  As has been the case in other 
instances where non-government public events are confronted 
by FSLN violent opposition (ref C), Granera stated that the 
Nicaraguan National Police was complacent and passive in 
allowing the FSLN mobs to inflict violence on the CC members. 
 One officer was quoted in the media as stating, "let them 
(CC members) get hit.  That's not our problem, but theirs. 
Those idiots go to the streets looking to get beat up." 
Media publicized the badge number of the police official who 
told his colleagues to take no action to protect the CC 
members.

¶6.  (C) While Nicaragua's civil society continues its attempt 
to exercise its fundamental right to free assembly and defend 
its democracy, the governing FSLN continues to threaten and 
physically prevent any group or individual not in-line with 
the Ortega administration.  Once again, Ortega's own 
statements defend the violent actions of his supporters and 
discredit the "opposition," reinforcing the sense of 
entitlement by FSLN-supporters that any action against 
perceived opponents is justified and further exacerbating the 
breakdown in public order.  Meanwhile, the police's failure 
to uphold citizens' basic rights and protect victims of 
violence further leads to the popular belief that the police 
force is under Ortega's control.
