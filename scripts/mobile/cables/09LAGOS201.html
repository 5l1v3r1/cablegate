¶1. (C) Summary:  Consul General met March 23 with Ijaw Youth 
Council spokespersons Dr. Felix Tuodolo, Chairman of the IYC 
Committee on Security and Economic Development (CSED), 
currently a lecturer in Corporate Social Responsibility at 
Liverpool University, and first President of the IYC; 
Engineer Udengs Eradiri, Secretary, CSED; Chief Dan Ekpiele, 
a high chief of the Gbaramatu Kingdom of Delta State, and Dr. 
Chris Ekiyor, current President of the IYC.  To carry out the 
consensus achieved at the IYC-organized summit of Ijaw Youths 
held February 6 in Yenagoa to close the militant camps within 
90 days, the IYC has advocated amnesty for militants as a 
necessary prerequisite for its plan of disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration (DDR), and has lobbied the 
Inspector General of Police, the head of the State Security 
Service (SSS), and the Minister and Minister of State for the 
Niger Delta Ministry. Bayelsa State supports all aspects of 
the IYC's DDR plan but cannot grant amnesty, a federal 
prerogative; the State will run a pilot of the IYC plan on 
the camp of Joshua MacGyver, whose decision to abandon 
militancy marks a "major turning point", the IYC spokesmen 
said. The IYC asked that the Mission advocate with the 
Government of Nigeria for amnesty.  Consul General cautioned 
that until there is a comprehensive settlement, the United 
States will not get out in front on the amnesty issue.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Consul General met March 23 with member of the Ijaw 
Youth Council (IYC), including Dr. Felix Tuodolo, Chairman of 
the IYC Committee on Security and Economic Development 
(CSED), currently a lecturer in Corporate Social 
Responsibility at Liverpool University, and first President 
of the IYC; Engineer Udengs Eradiri, Secretary, CSED; Chief 
Dan Ekpiele, a high chief of the Gbaramatu Kingdom of Delta 
State, and Dr. Chris Ekiyor, current President of the IYC. 
Also present were Pol-Econ Chief and Officer, and Regional 
Affairs Office Chief. 
 
MacGyver Camp Will Be Pilot for IYC's DDR Program 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (C) Dr. Tuodolo said that the IYC-sponsored Ijaw Youth 
Summit (Ref) on February 6 reached a consensus that militant 
camps should be demobilized and a program of disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration (DDR) entered into.  Summit 
participants called for  the camps to be dismantled within 90 
days.  Bayelsa State Governor Timipre Silva fully supports 
the proposed program, and following the Summit set up a team 
to work with the IYC to implement key parts of the program. 
One camp located in Bayelsa State, headed by Joshua MacGyver 
with a population of 524 militants, has come forward to be 
the program's pilot group. 
 
¶4. (C) However, Dr. Tuodolo explained, Bayelsa State, which 
is the location of 13 major camps, cannot move forward 
because it is clear that whoever leaves the camps will face 
problems with the security services; the militants in the 
camps may have been involved in crimes against individuals, 
the community or the government and are subject to arrest. 
The State Government does not have the power to grant 
amnesty, but Governor Silva has promised to advocate for 
amnesty with the President. (Note: On April 6, the President 
told PDP Chieftains that he had agreed to grant amnesty. Ref 
¶B. End Note) 
 
IYC Lobbies for Amnesty, DDR 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) The IYC has met with the Inspector General of Police, 
the Director General of the State Security Service (SSS), the 
Minister for the Niger Delta, and the head of Niger Delta 
Development Commission (NDDC), and all have reacted 
positively to the IYC's plan.  They are now preparing to take 
their case for amnesty to the National Assembly; the Speaker 
has asked to meet with them. The IYC also has discussed DDR 
 
LAGOS 00000201  002 OF 003 
 
 
with the President's National Commission on Small Arms and 
are approaching traditional rulers from areas outside the 
Niger Delta, such as the Sultan of Sokoto, the Ooni of Ife 
and the Oba of Benin, for their support 
 
¶6.  (C) In response to questions by RAO, the IYC spokesmen 
said the leaders of the militant camps have said they are 
willing to give up their arms; despite the loss of power and 
money, they are willing to do so because their motive is 
justice, and the freedom to come back into society.  When 
former President Obasanjo gave Asari-Dokubo amnesty, he was 
able to re-enter normal society, they said.  However, a 
leader like Boyloaf (Victor Ebikobowei) cannot just turn to 
non-violence; he will be picked up by the security forces and 
never allowed to see a lawyer, the IYC spokesmen alleged. 
Asked if combatant leaders will publicly support the plan, 
IYC spokespersons pointed to Joshua MacGyver, whose decision 
to come in the IYC spokespersons called a "major turning 
point."  Tom Polo (Government Ekpompolo) also stands behind 
the plan, and has received the Vice President, Chief of 
Defense Staff, Minister of the Interior and the Niger Delta 
Technical Committee members at Camp Five as proof of his 
commitment to peace. 
 
Security Funds Obstacle to Amnesty, Peace 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) The IYC spokesmen criticized the security allocation 
received by the states, which militates not only against 
amnesty but also against peace.  This year, the group 
alleged, the total amount allocated to the states is 800 
billion naira (approximately USD 5 billion), up from 400 
billion (approximately USD 2.9 billion) in 2008, the IYC 
spokesmen alleged. (Note: Post doubts this enormous figure 
can be correct.  In contrast, the 2009 defense budget 
provides for naira 1.5 billion (approximately USD 10 million) 
for military arms, while the Niger Delta Ministry's 2009 
budget provides for naira 710 million (approximately USD 47 
million) for security.  End Note)  This money does not have 
to be accounted for, and is embezzled and used for 
corruption; those that benefit from the funds and from 
insecurity in the Niger Delta will thwart every move toward 
amnesty and peace, the IYC spokesmen said.  If militants were 
granted amnesty, there would be no excuse for the allocation 
of large sums to security, and other lucrative sources of 
income would also disappear.   The IYC has called for an 
accounting of how the security funds are being spent, but the 
Government of Nigeria has routinely ignored these calls for 
information.  The IYC needs the voices of international 
stakeholders, such as the United States, to bolster the 
request, and to examine the response. 
 
IYC Presents Program, Asks Support on Amnesty 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (C)  The IYC decided to present its program formally to 
the U.S. Mission so that the Mission can look it over, and 
advise "where it can."  The IYC is also asking the U.S. 
Government to plead with the Government of Nigeria to 
establish an environment conducive to peace, that is to grant 
a general amnesty.  In addition, if the Government of Nigeria 
accepts the IYC plan, then the IYC will in the future also 
ask the U.S. Government for assistance in training and 
reintegrating militant youths into society.  The IYC believes 
South Africa presents a model on which to base such training, 
including training in non-violent principles, social skills 
necessary for reintegration into society, and job-related 
skills in the oil and gas and maritime sectors, needed if the 
youths are going to be employable.  The IYC has reached out 
to the British High Commission, which held out the prospect 
of soft training to be conducted through DfID, and said it 
would add its voice to the call for amnesty.  The IYC 
spokesperson have also met with the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP) at the Kofi Annan Center in Ghana; 
the Center has agreed to accept Niger Delta militants for 
non-violence and job skills training. (Note: The British 
Deputy High Commissioner told us that he had been in a 
listening mode and had made no commitments; we have not 
confirmed the other offers of assistance. End Note).  The IYC 
has also approached the Embassy of South Africa, and the 
 
LAGOS 00000201  003 OF 003 
 
 
Mayor of Durban about disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration (DDR) programs. 
 
¶9. (C) Consul General cautioned that until there is a 
comprehensive settlement Framework, the United States will 
not get out in front on the amnesty issue.  She also noted 
that the Nigerian people will have to support any grant of 
amnesty.  In response, the IYC spokesmen emphasized the 
important role of the international community in resolving 
the apartheid problem in South Africa.  They noted that 
Nigeria lacks the political will to solve the problems of the 
Niger Delta, and will need international encouragement to 
muster the needed resolve.  Inquiries and shows of interest 
from third countries will always be helpful in a place like 
Nigeria, where big men and mafias have the ear of the 
politicians, the spokesmen stated.
