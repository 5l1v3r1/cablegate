¶1. (C) Summary:  DPJ Diet Affairs Chair Kenji Yamaoka (a 
close confidante of DPJ Secretary General Ozawa) told Embassy 
Tokyo December 8 that the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) 
decision was ""all about managing the Diet.""  Until two weeks 
ago, he thought the Japanese government would agree to an FRF 
deal by the end of the year.  However the PM moved too slowly 
and now a decision within the year is no longer possible due 
to coalition partner intransigence.  He said that after the 
Upper House elections next summer, the Socialist Democratic 
Party (SDP) and People's New Party (PNP) would no longer be 
needed in the coalition, and at that point the government 
would implement the deal.  Yamaoka advised the United States 
to be patient.  In the meantime, he promised he would pass 
the necessary FRF-related budget items so that Japan could 
reserve its position on realignment.  The DCM pressed for an 
expeditious decision, but Yamaoka dismissed our arguments on 
the need to move forward this year saying that the decision 
had already been made and ""only FM Okada"" was still arguing 
for an agreement this year.  He acknowledged that this would 
present difficulties for PM Hatoyama's relationship with 
President Obama and criticized the PM as a ""poor 
communicator.""  When asked about Okinawa politics, Yamaoka 
said that Governor Nakaima would go ahead and sign the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), but that he could not 
win the governor's race next year.  In summer 2010, the 
Japanese Government would move forward with the FRF plan, and 
the new Okinawa governor would have to accept the ""done deal"" 
of the realignment package.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) In a December 8 meeting with DCM Zumwalt and Poloff, 
DPJ Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Yamaoka frankly shared 
his views on Japan's political situation and issues 
surrounding FRF.  Yamaoka explained that there were 
precedents that PMs had to resign in order to pass the 
budget.  If the DPJ's coalition partners left the government 
over the FRF issue, then the DPJ would lose its Upper House 
majority and be unable to pass budget-related bills; Hatoyama 
might thus have to resign.  Hatoyama's political donation 
problem is likely to reach a critical point from the end of 
this year to early next year, and Hatoyama is likely to be 
attacked in the ordinary Diet session.  As the Diet Affairs 
Committee Chair, Yamaoka said he would try to delay the 
opening of the session as long as possible in order to 
deprive the LDP of time to attack Hatoyama's scandals.  That 
means deliberation of key Diet bills, including the 
supplementary budget and regular budget, will be pushed back 
and the DPJ will be pressed to handle them all quickly.  To 
manage this process, the party needs its coalition partners 
in the Upper House.  Since the UH election will be held in 
July, the session cannot be extended.  The supplementary 
budget and the regular budget have to pass before the UH 
election, and key budget items, such as child allowances and 
agricultural subsidies must be implemented as well. 
Therefore Diet management in the next session was critical to 
Hatoyama's success, Yamaoka explained. 
 
¶3. (C) If the SDP continues to threaten to leave the 
coalition, the PNP may threaten to do the same to ""increase 
its profile,"" Yamaoka continued.  The PNP hopes to hold the 
casting vote once the SDP is gone, and that means the PNP 
will become increasingly vocal about the FRF issue.  Yamaoka 
explained that the most important issue for the SDP was 
Okinawa, for the PNP was the postal issue, and for DPJ SecGen 
Ozawa was Diet reform.  In order to position themselves 
favorably, all three parties will use whatever political 
cards they have.  If the United States continues to pressure 
Hatoyama on the Futenma issue, the Hatoyama Cabinet could 
possibly collapse.  If the SDP leaves the coalition, Diet 
management for the DPJ would be extremely difficult.  FM 
Okada and MLIT Minister Maehara have no experience in Diet 
management, and they cannot be where they are now without 
being supported by the ""ship called a coalition.""  They do 
not understand the politics of the Diet affairs.  If they 
could put themselves in the PM's position, their judgment 
would be different, said Yamaoka.  In his view, it is better 
for the United States to wait for the political situation to 
calm down until after the budget passes and the DPJ's victory 
in the July 2010 UH election.  If the United States continues 
to apply pressure, reiterated Yamaoka, the situation could 
further deteriorate.  Yamaoka said that haste makes waste, 
 
TOKYO 00002815  002 OF 003 
 
 
and stated that waiting, in the end, is the best way to 
ensure the plan's implantation.  Once the DPJ wins the UH 
election, the FRF issue can be solved said Yamaoka.  Yamaoka 
has been discussing the FRF issue with the PM and Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hirano and advising them on the Diet 
situation.  Yamaoka told the PM if he could meet with the 
President in Copenhagen, he should fully explain the current 
political/Diet situation and gain his understanding. 
 
¶4. (C) The DCM underlined the need for an expeditious 
decision, particularly in light of local Okinawan politics 
and our own budget process.  Yamaoka said that a decision had 
already been made; the only issue that remained was  how to 
explain to the United States that, by earmarking FRF-related 
funds in the budget, Japan was making a de facto commitment 
to move forward with the FRF plan as currently envisioned. 
Yamaoka made it clear that Hatoyama was not planning to 
commit political suicide in order to implement the FRF this 
year.  FM Okada may think it's okay for Hatoyama to quit if 
the FRF deal could be pushed forward, but Hatoyama does not 
think so.  The more that Okada -- who may think he can 
replace Hatoyama -- presses the PM, the more Hatoyama will 
consider the political situation and how best to protect his 
position.  He will not give up the prime ministership for 
Futenma, Yamaoka said. 
 
¶5. (C) That said, Yamaoka repeated that he told Defense 
Minister Kitazawa to make sure to earmark the FRF and Guam 
expenses in the regular budget.  Yamaoka said that as the 
manager of the Diet business, he would make sure these 
government requests passed.  Yamaoka hoped that the United 
States would implicitly understand that earmarking meant that 
the plan would be implemented eventually.  Yamaoka also 
stated that relevant Cabinet members were being called to the 
Kantei not to be told that a decision on the implementation 
of the current plan would be made in December, but to be told 
that the implementation would not be announced before the end 
of the year, although the budget would be earmarked. 
According to Yamaoka, PM told this to Okinawa Governor 
Nakaima as well; for his part, Nakaima has been pressuring 
the PM to move forward with the current plan for the sake of 
his own political position, Yamaoka said. 
 
¶6. (C) On Okinawa politics, Yamaoka said that Okinawa would 
oppose base issues whenever they are discussed.  ""It's all 
about opposing for its own sake,"" Yamaoka stated.  The 
Okinawa gubernatorial election will be held next fall and 
incumbent governor Nakaima will lose for sure.  Once the new 
governor is elected, the FRF issue could hit a real wall, so 
the GOJ needed to resolve it before then.  If the base 
decision were a fait accompli, then the new governor would be 
forced to accept that decision.  Nakaima knows that he has to 
stick the current plan and that's the only way for him to 
have a chance to survive politically.  As for the Nago 
mayoral election, regardless of the outcome, the government 
must stick to its plan to implement the realignment 
agreement.  If Okinawa's will is respected, ""nothing will 
ever happen.""  The issue of Okinawa politics, therefore, is 
not a big deal as long as the government's decision is made 
before the gubernatorial race. 
 
¶7. (C) On PM Hatoyama's ""trust me"" statement, Yamaoka 
explained that PM meant to say that he would surely move 
forward with FRF ""at some point.""  Yamaoka expressed his 
understanding that the United States took this to mean that 
the PM would make a decision within this year, and that 
President Obama had ""lost face.""  Yamaoka believed that 
Hatoyama exercised the wrong political judgment.  In 
Yamaoka's view, Hatoyama should have clearly promised 
President Obama when they met that his government would 
implement the current plan.  Yamaoka revealed that around 
that time, the SDP was under a great deal of political 
pressure, as Yamaoka had told them that once out of the 
coalition, the SDP would vanish as a political party in the 
upcoming election.  SDP president Fukushima seriously 
considered accepting the DPJ's position; however, when PM and 
others moved slowly on FRF, the SDP took the initiative by 
holding an anti-base rally in Okinawa.  This created the 
political momentum for the anti-base elements in the SDP to 
oppose the Futenma relocation even if it meant putting the 
coalition at risk.  Yamaoka critically said that the PM's 
lack of leadership and determination led to the current mess. 
 
TOKYO 00002815  003 OF 003 
 
 
 He lost the opportunity to make a political decision by 
moving too slowly, Yamaoka said. 
 
¶8. (C) In Yamaoka's view, the best way to break through the 
current stalemate is for Washington to understand the current 
political situation in Japan and to tell Japan what it would 
like to do in search of mutually acceptable ""next best way."" 
If PM Hatoyama cannot meet President Obama on the matter, 
Yamaoka thought that Japan should send a special envoy to 
deliver the message and seek U.S. understanding.  He thought 
a phone conversation between PM Hatoyama and President Obama 
would not be sufficient, as their ""true feelings"" would not 
be adequately communicated by telephone. 
 
¶9. (C) Yamaoka added that even if the current plan were 
implemented, the Japanese public would not necessarily be 
favorable towards U.S.-Japan relations, as the media and 
other ""agitators"" would focus on the issue of the coral reef 
and environmental destruction caused by the landfill.  The 
negative image could shake the DPJ government. 
Implementation of the current plan meant reduction of the 
burden on Okinawa, but politically it could be viewed 
negatively.  In order to avoid such a situation, Yamaoka said 
it was critical to discuss the future direction of the 
alliance and make the FRF/Henoko issue as but one of many 
issues in the alliance.  In doing so, it is also important to 
explain to the Japanese public that it is the time for Japan 
to reduce its dependence on the United States and try to 
assume a greater defense burden. 
 
¶10. (C) On the DPJ's position on the future of the alliance, 
Yamaoka explained it had three stages.  First, the DPJ should 
make it clear to the United States that it intends to bear 
much more responsibility in the alliance.  Second, the United 
States should explain what kind of roles it expected from 
Japan within its global strategy.  Third, Japan should then 
decide its direction and what it can do.  The process may 
take some time, but Yamaoka said that was what Ozawa wanted 
to do.  Japan needed to continue to stay under the U.S. 
nuclear umbrella and needs to bear more of a burden.  The 
current public feeling between Japan and the United States is 
that while Americans feel overburdened, the Japanese public 
feels negative about foreign military forces stationed in 
Japan.  Yamaoka understood that Japan was very ""spoiled"" and 
dependent on the United States and was taking U.S. protection 
for granted.  Some Japanese think that Japan's security is 
none of their business, and therefore, no bases were needed. 
Once the UH election is over, Yamaoka thinks the DPJ can 
remove the SDP and the PNP from the coalition.  The DPJ will 
have three years before another national election, and within 
the three years, the DPJ should be able to step up 
discussions on how to advance the alliance from the post-war 
relationship to future-oriented relationship without any 
obstacles.
