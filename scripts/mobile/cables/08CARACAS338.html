¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez abruptly 
changed roles from Field Marshal to Peacemaker after 
returning from the Rio Summit in Santo Domingo.  During his 
March 8 International Day of the Woman speech, Chavez struck 
a conciliatory tone toward Colombia by reopening diplomatic 
missions, recalling troops from the border, and reiterating 
his call for the release of Franco-Colombian hostage Ingrid 
Betancourt.  Chavez's most recent constructive rhetoric, 
however, belies his implicit admission that the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) operates in Venezuela or the 
reality that the bulk of Venezuelan forces never made it out 
of garrison after being ordered to the border.  END SUMMARY. 
 
OPEN FOR BUSINESS 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On the occasion of the International Day of the 
Woman March 9, Chavez announced the immediate restoration  of 
diplomatic relations with Bogota and invited the recently 
expelled Colombian Embassy personnel to return to Caracas. 
The Foreign Ministry released the same day a communiquQ 
celebrating "the victory of peace and sovereignty" in Santo 
Domingo and the immediate return of Venezuela diplomatic 
personnel to Colombia.  The dispatch also urged expelled 
Colombian diplomats to return "as soon as possible." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Venezuelan media reported that the Venezuelan 
legation would be headed by Commercial AttachQ Gregorio 
Flores and staffed by 11 other diplomats.  Sources at the 
Foreign Ministry told the press that Venezuelan Ambassador 
Pavel Rondon, who had been recalled in November following 
Colombia's decision to remove Chavez from his role as 
humanitarian exchange facilitator, would not be returning to 
Bogota and a female candidate was being sought to replace 
him.  Those same Foreign Ministry sources expressed hope that 
Colombian Ambassador to Venezuela Marin Valencia would not 
return to Caracas.  However, March 11 press reports that 
Marin plans to return to Caracas that  same day. 
 
HOME FOR HOLY WEEK 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (S) Chavez also announced during the March 9 speech that 
the ten battalions he had ordered to Venezuela's border with 
Colombia would withdraw on March 11.  Chavez thanked the 
defense forces for their service to the fatherland and 
announced that all soldiers sent to the border would receive 
a special leave during Holy Week (starting March 15).  Open 
and sensitive source estimates indicate that only about a 
third of the estimated manpower and equipment had completed 
the approximately 260-mile journey to the border area since 
the order had been given seven days earlier. 
 
WHY NOT CALL 
------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) During the same address, Chavez stood next to 
Yolanda Pulecio, the mother of Ingrid Betancourt, and 
publicly appealed to the FARC chief for Ingrid Betancourt's 
release.  "Manuel Marulanda, send us Ingrid," Chavez said. 
Adding fuel to the rumor that Betancourt's release via 
Ecuador had been imminent until the March 1 cross-border 
raid, Chavez added, "When you can, when conditions make it 
possible, liberate Ingrid Betancourt.  It doesn't make sense 
to keep her in the jungles of Colombia." 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: Chavez's decision to send troops to the 
Colombian border never appeared to resonate politically 
except among the Venezuelan president's most ardent 
supporters.  In addition, Chavez's warning to Colombia not to 
repeat what it did in Ecuador, and his ostensible rush to 
prevent any Colombian cross-border military operations 
against the FARC in Venezuela were implicit admissions that 
the FARC is operating inside of Venezuela.  Moreover, 
Chavez's mobilization order appeared to confirm that 
Venezuela's armed forces are not exactly mission capable. 
Nevertheless, Chavez is once again exhibiting his tremendous 
political agility by seizing the opportunity the Rio Summit 
provided to transform from a Field Marshal into an advocate 
of peace and fraternity.
