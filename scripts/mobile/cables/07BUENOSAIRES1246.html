¶1.  (C)  Summary.  On June 25, Ambassador Wayne called on 
Interior Minister Anibal Fernandez to discuss ongoing 
counternarcotics (CN) cooperation in the Tri-Border Area 
(TBA), the Department's offer to conduct a counterterrorism 
(CT) assessment of Argentina, and status of TIP legislation 
(reported septel).  Fernandez briefed the Ambassador on the 
GOA's efforts to enhance CN cooperation at the domestic and 
international levels (reftel).  When the Ambassador noted 
that we were waiting for MOI decisions on GOA participation 
in a CN initiative in the TBA and a general CT assessment, 
the Minister immediately approved the CN initiative and asked 
a subordinate to follow up with Argentina's intelligence 
agency, SIDE, to obtain a recommendation on the CT 
assessment.  He told the Ambassador that he is in favor of 
the CT assessment, but must wait for a recommendation from 
SIDE before accepting the offer.  When the Ambassador 
informed Fernandez that the Transportation Security Agency 
would be sending its February 2007 security assessment of 
Ezeiza International Airport in the coming weeks, Fernandez 
replied that he could take constructive criticism, especially 
given that much investment is needed to enhance airport 
security.  Fernandez closed by downplaying press speculation 
of a rift between him and the head of Airport Security Police 
(PSA) Marcelo Sain, but he slammed Jose Granero, chief of the 
Secretary of Planning for Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug 
 
SIPDIS 
Trafficking (SEDRONAR), and his second in command Gabriel 
Aboud.  (Note:  The Minister's comment reflects long-running 
turf battles between the Minister and the Chiefs of PSA and 
SEDRONAR. End Note.)  End Summary. 
 
GOA CN initiatives to improve interagency and international 
cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  On June 25, Ambassador Wayne called on Interior 
Minister Anibal Fernandez.  He was accompanied by DEA Acting 
Country Attache T.K. Solis and poloff.  The Ambassador 
praised the MOI's recent efforts to increase interagency 
coordination and to develop mechanisms to identify and 
prosecute drug trafficking networks (reftel).  Minister 
Fernandez noted that the GOA had recently completed an 
assessment of the problem and had based its new initiatives 
on that assessment.  He expressed frustration with corruption 
at the provincial level and pointed out that the GOA had ""not 
made any important progress"" on drug and precursor chemical 
seizures or in the detection of drug networks and labs.  He 
also noted that drugs seized have been of poor quality. 
(Comment: Fernandez' negative assessment on previous 
successes, particularly relating to precursor chemicals, is 
likely tied to his ongoing turf battle with SEDRONAR, which 
is responsible for developing and implementing the precursor 
chemical control regime as well as anti-narcotics education 
and use programs.  In Embassy's assessment, SEDRONAR's 
control regime has been well conceptualized and well run. 
Fernandez does not like that there is another 
counternarcotics agency not under his control and which 
answers directly to the President.  End Comment.) 
 
¶3.  (C)  Fernandez also asserted that the Interior Ministry 
should focus its efforts on busting large drug trafficking 
networks, not the individual addict.  Fernandez stated that 
although he is against decriminalizing drug use, SEDRONAR and 
the Ministry of Health should improve its efforts to 
rehabilitate individual drug abusers.  He indicated that only 
2.5% of all federal cases related to drug trafficking result 
in convictions.  He noted that the cost of trial is AR5000 
(approximately USD 1650), and that the cost of keeping a drug 
addict in jail is AR5000 a month. 
 
¶4.  (C)  The Ambassador expressed USG support for the GOA's 
efforts to improve interagency and international CN 
coordination.  He noted that the USG enjoys cooperation with 
the GOB in the area of law enforcement but not in 
eradication.  He then asked about Argentina's experience in 
working with Bolivia.  Fernandez stated that he had spoken to 
Bolivian President Morales during a meeting with President 
Kirchner.  He noted that although Morales defends coca 
production, he does not support the production of cocaine. 
The Ambassador pointed out that Morales' stance is 
contradictory, asking how increased coca production does not 
lead to increased cocaine production?  Fernandez ceded the 
point, calling the GOB's eradication policies 
""schizophrenic"".  Nevertheless, he stated that he believes 
Morales is willing to sign CN cooperation agreements and 
reported that his Bolivian counterpart is currently 
considering the GOA's offer to sign a CN information sharing 
agreement.  If the GOB approves it, Fernandez will travel to 
Bolivia to sign the agreement.  Fernandez stated that when it 
comes to narcotrafficking issues in the region, however, he 
is more concerned with Peru than with Bolivia.  He indicated 
that Peruvian President Garcia told him that he acknowledged 
that many of Peru's ""least desirable"" citizens immigrated to 
Argentina.  He also added that Peruvians jailed for 
drug-related crimes far outnumber Bolivians in Argentine 
prisons. 
 
Fernandez moves bureaucracy on USG CN and CT initiatives 
after significant delays 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  The Ambassador then raised CN cooperation in the 
TBA, noting that Prefectura had received the MOI's approval 
to participate in the new Eastern Border Task Force in 
Misiones.  He pointed out, however, that Gendarmerie was 
still waiting for MOI approval to participate in the task 
force.  Fernandez immediately placed a call to the National 
Gendarmerie's Commanding General Hector Schenone authorizing 
Gendarmerie's participation in the force. 
 
¶6.  (C)  Similarly, when the Ambassador informed Fernandez 
that the Embassy still had not received an answer from the 
MOI regarding the Department's anti-terrorism assistance 
(ATA) offer to conduct a CT assessment in Argentina, he 
immediately called a subordinate to follow up with 
Argentina's intelligence service (SIDE) to obtain their 
recommendation on the proposal.  He explained to the 
Ambassador that he is in favor of the assessment, but must 
wait for a recommendation from SIDE before accepting the 
offer.  (Embassy has already followed up with SIDE who 
indicated approval will be forthcoming soonest.) 
 
Fernandez: GOA can take TSA Constructive Criticism, 
Particuarly When Done Privately 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
¶7.  (C)  Finally, the Ambassador noted that the 
Transportation Security Agency had very recently completed 
its official confidential letter regarding the February 2007 
security assessment of Ezeiza International Airport, and that 
the report would likely include a discussion of areas for 
improvement.  Minister Fernandez indicated that he can accept 
constructive criticism, ""particularly when it's done 
privately"", and that these evaluations help to promote needed 
reforms.  He noted that Argentina needs to make significant 
investment in its airport security infrastructure and 
training. 
 
Fernandez Comments on Relationships with other Security 
Agency Chiefs 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶8.  (C)  Fernandez, unprompted, then downplayed any public 
rift between him and Airport Security Police (PSA) National 
Director Dr. Marcelo Fabian Sain as speculated in recent 
press articles.  He asserted that he and Sain share the same 
vision, and that the argument is not over the GOA's 
counternarcotics strategy but over investment to address the 
problem.  The GOA's self-critical evaluation of its efforts 
to combat narcotrafficking is not directed at the PSA, which 
has only been in existence for the last two years, rather it 
focuses on the lack of progress in general over the last 18 
years.  He stated that instead of criticizing the PSA, he 
applauds their efforts.  He added that when a journalist 
asked him why the Minister does not fire Sain, he replied 
that Sain is a good official and that he would not sack Sain 
over an argument.  Fernandez privately indicated to the 
Ambassador, that he would sack Jose Granero, head of 
SEDRONAR, whose second in command, Gabriel Aboud, is ""a joke"" 
(porqueria).  (Comment:  The Minister's comments reveal his 
micromanagement tendencies and reflect long-running turf 
battles between the Minister and the chiefs of SEDRONAR and 
PSA.  Granero answers directly to President Kirchner which 
irritates Fernandez and makes it difficult for him to 
criticize Granero or Aboud publicly.  Fernandez's comments on 
Sain are interesting as we continue to hear reports that 
their relationship is tense, also possibly due to Sain's 
direct links to Kirchner.  End Comment.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶9.  (C)  A temperamental interlocuter, Minister Fernandez was 
in a good mood and seemed unbothered by the news that PRO 
candidate Mauricio Macri won this weekend's election for 
Mayor of Buenos Aires city.  During the meeting, he described 
himself as ""pro-American as you can get"" in Argentina.  He 
expressed a willingness to work with us on counternarcotics, 
counterterrorism, and trafficking in persons issues; and 
stressed that he can take constructive criticism, whether it 
comes from the TIP report or TSA, so long as it is done 
privately.
