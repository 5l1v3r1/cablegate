¶1.  (S) On July 26, per reftel instructions we met with 
Foreign Ministry Director General for the Americas Orlando 
Gomez and urged that Nicaragua not continue business as usual 
with Iran.  We also highlighted Nicaragua's requirements 
under UNSCRs 1737 and 1747, especially the prohibitions under 
¶1747. 
 
¶2. (S) Gomez, a Sandinista appointee, in his current position 
since January 2007, replied that Nicaragua has a long history 
of good relations with Iran that long predate the current 
"U.S. preoccupation" with Iran.  He also noted that Nicaragua 
is expecting a high-level Iranian delegation to visit the 
country, beginning July 31.  (Note:  Iranian Minister of 
Energy, Hamid Chitchian, will visit Nicaragua from July 31 
through August 5.  End note.)  This delegation, Gomez argued, 
would focus on projects to assist Nicaragua in electrical 
power generation, to build a manufacturing facility for 
autobuses, and to promote agricultural sector development. 
 
¶3.  (S) We rejoined that Iran's continued obstructionism in 
the face of international pressure and outstanding issues 
with the IAEA were not simply a "U.S. preoccupation" but 
rather a concern shared by all nations.  Gomez then attempted 
to dispel our concerns with an assurance that, when Nicaragua 
deals with Iran in the future, it would closely bear in mind 
the issues that we raised concerning the UNSCR resolutions. 
He added that, in his opinion, patience and continued 
dialogue with Iran would produce a diplomatic settlement. 
 
¶4.  (S) Comment:  The Ortega government has sought out 
friendship with Iran, and, despite assurances that Nicaragua 
will observe its international obligations under relevant 
UNSCR resolutions, we have no expectations that Nicaragua 
will change its current course despite our continued urgings. 
 For now, in Nicaragua, it is business as usual with Iran.
