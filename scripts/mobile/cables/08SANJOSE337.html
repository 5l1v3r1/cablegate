¶1. (U) On April 29, we delivered reftel demarches to Adriana 
Murillo, Head of the UN Security Council Team, and Deyanira 
Ramirez, UN General Assembly Desk Officer, at the MFA. Poloff 
also presented the talking points that the US plans to raise 
with the SYG and UNDP. 
 
¶2. (C) The two officials stated that Costa Rica has already 
raised points about the Zimbabwe elections, and that in 
general terms, Costa Rica favors UN involvement in protecting 
human rights and assuring democratic processes around the 
world. Murillo and Ramirez were not/not enthusiastic about 
the UNDP Resident Representative's proposal to diplomats in 
Harare that the international community support a Mugabe-led 
national unity government. They stressed that the democratic 
election process and results should be respected. 
 
¶3. (C) As for sending a special envoy, the two officials 
stated that the idea is not problematic for Costa Rica, and 
they later confirmed that the GoCR would support an envoy. 
However, when presented with the refined points in Ref B, 
Ramirez stated that Costa Rica would be less likely to 
support a fact-finding team than a special envoy. She stated 
that the election was already legitimated by international 
observers, and she speculated that since Mugabe lost, his 
people are scrambling to figure out what to do. Murillo and 
Ramirez said they would confer with the GoCR Mission in New 
York and review the other points. Post will advise if/when a 
response is received. 
 
¶4. (U) Ramirez told Poloff later on April 29 that the MFA has 
already sent instructions to its delegation in New York 
supporting action to resolve the electoral crisis, referring 
to the first point in Ref B. 
 
¶5. (U) Murillo requested that if the US decides to make a 
formal special declaration on Zimbabwe, to please circulate 
the text to the MFA beforehand.
