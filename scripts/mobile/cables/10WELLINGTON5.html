¶1. (SBU) On January 7, Econoff spoke with Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT) Environmental Division Deputy Director 
Carol Schwalger, who is the chief point of contact on the January 6 
collision between a Japanese whaling vessel and the Ady Gil, a boat 
owned by the Sea Sheperd Conservation Society anti-whaling group. 
Schwalger said that the New Zealand Government (GNZ) is not making 
any judgment as to who was at fault for the collision, regardless 
of the public accusations and finger pointing in the press that 
both sides in the incident are currently engaged in.  Since the Ady 
Gil is a New Zealand flagged vessel, the New Zealand Government has 
undertaken a preliminary assessment and investigation before 
deciding on next steps.  Schwalger noted that MFAT has had an 
exchange with Japan regarding the matter, and Japan has promised to 
do a full investigation.  According to MFAT's preliminary judgment, 
it is not clear which party is at fault.  Schwalger added that the 
New Zealand Government is not under the same public pressure to 
respond as the Australian Government since the whaling issue is a 
"much hotter" issue there.  She did note, however, that depending 
how the investigation goes, there could be "diplomatic 
consequences." 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU)  During a January 7 interview on Radio NZ - the national 
radio station - Foreign Minister Murray McCully reiterated New 
Zealand's opposition to Japanese whaling operations in Antarctic 
waters but called on all parties to "put a greater premium on life, 
in such a harsh environment."  He added that Maritime New Zealand 
was conducting the preliminary assessment in close cooperation with 
Australian maritime authorities (Note:  The collision took place in 
an area where Australia is responsible for maritime search and 
rescue operations.  End Note).   McCully said that the GNZ would 
decide on appropriate next steps following completion of the 
preliminary assessment.  In the interim, McCully noted, he would be 
taking the matter up with the Japanese on January 7 and, "despite 
our strongly differing views on the whaling issue, that we do work 
constructively with the Japanese authorities, because we have 
issues of safety and welfare at stake, and I've found that the 
Japanese Government and New Zealand Government can work together, 
despite our differences over the whaling policy issue." 
 
 
 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  The Government of New Zealand's measured 
response and unwillingness to rush to assign blame for the 
collision between a Japanese whaling vessel and the New 
Zealand-flagged Ady Gil are in vivid contrast to the more 
sensationalistic coverage of the incident in the New Zealand press. 
Both sides are using the press to take their case to the court of 
public opinion and assign blame for the incident to the other 
party.  While the whaling issue may not resonate as strongly with 
Kiwis as it does with Australians, most Kiwis support their 
Government's strong opposition to Japanese whaling in Antarctic 
waters.  Whether that will sway public opinion against the Japanese 
on this particular incident remains to be seen.  In the mean time, 
the Japanese Government-backed Institute of Cetacean Research has 
made New Zealander Glenn Inwood its spokesman on this issue and he 
has been vigorously defending the actions of the Japanese vessel, 
the Shonan Maru 2, in the New Zealand print and broadcast media. 
End Comment.
