</p><p>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: On July 19, the DCM paid a farewell call on 
</p><p>President Kirchner's closest and most influential advisor, 
</p><p>Technical and Legal Secretary Carlos Zannini, that included a 
</p><p>discussion on the bilateral relationship and GOA regional 
</p><p>policy.  Reviewing the U.S. bilateral objectives over the 
</p><p>past three years, the DCM said he and the Ambassador had 
</p><p>sought to support Argentina's democracy, economic recovery 
</p><p>and political stability, cooperate with the GOA on security 
</p><p>and counterterrorism issues, and after Argentina recovered, 
</p><p>seek the GOA's constructive role in the region.  The DCM 
</p><p>praised Argentina's economic recovery and Zannini thanked the 
</p><p>U.S. for its help during the crisis.  Turning to regional 
</p><p>issues, the DCM noted U.S. regional concerns regarding 
</p><p>Venezuela and Bolivia.  The DCM said that Kirchner's close 
</p><p>relationship with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and 
</p><p>Chavez's threats against democracy, as well as his penchant 
</p><p>for slandering President Bush and the USG, made it difficult 
</p><p>for the Embassy to maintain constructive bilateral relations 
</p><p>with the GOA.  Zannini said that the GOA's relationship with 
</p><p>Venezuela was based on economics and that Mercosur membership 
</p><p>would change Venezuela, not the other way around.  On 
</p><p>Bolivia, both the DCM and Zannini agreed that isolating 
</p><p>President Morales would not be good, but the DCM said that 
</p><p>both countries needed to work to moderate Morales' actions. 
</p><p>Looking towards the future, Zannini said he hoped 
</p><p>communication between the two countries would be further 
</p><p>strengthened.  The DCM highlighted incoming Ambassador 
</p><p>Wayne's strong qualifications and noted that he would 
</p><p>continue Ambassador Gutierrez's professional diplomacy.  END 
</p><p>SUMMARY. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>-------------------------- 
</p><p>REVIEWING THE RELATIONSHIP 
</p><p>-------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (C) On July 19, the DCM paid a farewell call on Technical 
</p><p>and Legal Secretary Carlos Zannini that included a discussion 
</p><p>on the bilateral relationship and GOA regional policy. 
</p><p>Carlos Zannini is a long-time, close Kirchner advisor and 
</p><p>probably his most influential policy confidant (See reftel 
</p><p>A).  Zannini began the discussion by noting the good 
</p><p>relationship the Casa Rosada enjoyed with the Ambassador and 
</p><p>DCM and expressed appreciation for U.S. help during the 
</p><p>crisis.  The DCM said the U.S. is pleased that Argentina's 
</p><p>economic recovery has been strong and said that Kirchner 
</p><p>deserves a great deal of the credit for it.  Zannini replied 
</p><p>that Argentina's process of recovery was unfinished, but that 
</p><p>they too were pleased they were on the way. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (C) The DCM reiterated U.S. objectives in Argentina.  The 
</p><p>DCM said that in the past three years he and the Ambassador 
</p><p>had sought to support Argentina's democracy, economic 
</p><p>recovery and political stability, strengthen cooperation with 
</p><p>the GOA on security and counterterrorism issues, and after 
</p><p>Argentina recovered, seek the GOA's constructive role in the 
</p><p>region.  The DCM detailed the support that the U.S. gave to 
</p><p>Argentina during the depth of the financial crisis, from 
</p><p>advocating for Argentina within the G-7 to the U.S. 
</p><p>Treasury's decision to support the private sector debt 
</p><p>exchange that allowed Argentina to secure a higher rate of 
</p><p>participation in the deal.  The DCM noted that no major U.S. 
</p><p>company left Argentina during the crisis and that roughly 500 
</p><p>U.S. companies currently operate in Argentina generating 
</p><p>roughly 200,000 jobs. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------- 
</p><p>REGIONAL ISSUES 
</p><p>--------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4.  (C) Turning to regional issues, the DCM noted U.S. 
</p><p>regional concerns and said the U.S. wanted to see Argentina 
</p><p>take a more active role in supporting regional democracy. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>BUENOS AIR 00001632  002 OF 003 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>The DCM thanked Zannini for the GOA's continued help in 
</p><p>Haiti.  The DCM raised the issue of Venezuela, stating that 
</p><p>Kirchner's close relationship with Venezuelan President Hugo 
</p><p>Chavez and Chavez's threats against democracy, as well as his 
</p><p>penchant for slandering President Bush and the USG, made it 
</p><p>difficult for the Embassy to maintain constructive bilateral 
</p><p>relations with the GOA.  The DCM said, ""One day Kirchner is 
</p><p>meeting with Chavez, and Chavez may be on good behavior 
</p><p>because Kirchner has asked Chavez to avoid incidents, but the 
</p><p>next day Chavez is calling President Bush a drunkard, a 
</p><p>genocidal maniac and worse than Hitler.""  The DCM said that 
</p><p>by so closely associating himself with a leader like Chavez, 
</p><p>Kirchner risks being viewed by Washington as sharing Chavez's 
</p><p>views.  The DCM said that the U.S. does not oppose 
</p><p>Argentina's economic ties with Venezuela, as the 
</p><p>U.S.-Venezuelan trade relationship is extensive, but both 
</p><p>Argentina and the U.S. need to support Venezuela's democracy. 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5.  (C) Zannini responded by emphasizing the economic nature 
</p><p>of Argentina's relationship with Venezuela and noted that the 
</p><p>U.S. and Argentina ""have different definitions of democracy."" 
</p><p> Zannini said, ""Our relations with Venezuela are not 
</p><p>anti-U.S., but based on economic interests.""  Zannini 
</p><p>acknowledged Chavez's anti-U.S. tendencies, ""Attacking the 
</p><p>U.S. is a way for him (Chavez) to build power in Venezuela."" 
</p><p>He said that Argentina does not share Chavez's anti-U.S. 
</p><p>message.  Regarding Venezuela's democracy, Zannini said that 
</p><p>for the GOA, the most important part of a democracy is 
</p><p>voting, pointing out that Chavez has won numerous national 
</p><p>elections.  Zannini said that part of the problem with 
</p><p>Venezuela's democracy is the intransigence of Venezuela's 
</p><p>opposition.  Zannini noted the many ways that Venezuela was 
</p><p>helping Argentina, from buying bonds, helping to meeting 
</p><p>Argentina's energy needs, to selling Argentina agricultural 
</p><p>equipment. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6.  (C) The DCM responded by noting the increasingly 
</p><p>authoritarian nature of the Chavez government.  He stressed 
</p><p>Chavez's concerted efforts to weaken judicial independence 
</p><p>and retain monopoly control of Venezuela's Congress, as well 
</p><p>as his crackdown against the political opposition and media. 
</p><p>The DCM said that many in the opposition and in the media in 
</p><p>Venezuela lived in fear.  The DCM also noted the foreign 
</p><p>policy dimension of the problem, citing Chavez's cultivation 
</p><p>of the rogue regimes in Iran and North Korea.  Zannini 
</p><p>replied by highlighting the GOA's cooperation with the U.S. 
</p><p>on counterproliferation efforts on both Iran and North Korea 
</p><p>in the UN Security Council. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7.  (C) On Bolivia, the DCM said that the U.S. is not trying 
</p><p>to isolate Bolivian President Morales, but is instead seeking 
</p><p>to moderate Morales' actions.  Zannini said that isolating 
</p><p>Morales would just create a worse situation.  Zannini said 
</p><p>that Morales and Chavez often have rhetoric that is much 
</p><p>worse than their actions.  The DCM acknowledged that focusing 
</p><p>exclusively on rhetoric was not helpful, but reaffirmed that 
</p><p>the U.S. is also concerned with some of the actions of both 
</p><p>Morales and Chavez. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8.  (C) Zannini raised the issue of the Mercosur Summit in 
</p><p>Cordoba.  Zannini said Venezuela's incorporation into 
</p><p>Mercosur should not concern the U.S.  ""Venezuela will adapt 
</p><p>to Mercosur, not the other way around.  Argentina does not 
</p><p>have a regime like Venezuela's; Argentina has its own 
</p><p>characteristics.""  Zannini acknowledged that 
</p><p>misunderstandings about Argentina's relationship with 
</p><p>Venezuela could cause many problems with the GOA's 
</p><p>relationship with the U.S.  However, he again sought to allay 
</p><p>U.S. fears, ""Argentina is not going to be a tool of Cuba."" 
</p><p>Zannini said that the highlights of the Summit in Cordoba 
</p><p>would be announcing the creation of a South American 
</p><p>parliament and a regional infrastructure fund.  Zannini noted 
</p><p>that Mercosur's success would lead to stronger democracies in 
</p><p>the region, ""With better economies, democracy can grow.""

</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>LOOKING TO THE FUTURE 
</p><p>--------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9.  (C) Looking towards the future, Zannini said he hoped 
</p><p>communication between the two countries would improve. 
</p><p>Zannini said that ""Argentina is focused just on the region 
</p><p>and the U.S. is focused on the world.  At times, the U.S. has 
</p><p>not exercised the leadership in the region that was needed."" 
</p><p>The DCM replied that Argentina has benefited first-hand from 
</p><p>the U.S. regional leadership in recent years.  The DCM 
</p><p>highlighted incoming Ambassador Wayne's strong 
</p><p>qualifications, predicting that he would maintain Ambassador 
</p><p>Gutierrez's efforts to reach out and seek to strengthen 
</p><p>bilateral ties. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10.  (C) Zannini, noting incoming Ambassador Wayne's economic 
</p><p>background, appealed for more U.S. investment in Argentina as 
</p><p>the best way to improve bilateral relations.  The DCM said 
</p><p>that the GOA needs to ensure that U.S. companies have the 
</p><p>freedom to operate in Argentina without GOA price controls 
</p><p>and interference that would harm the U.S. companies' ability 
</p><p>to compete.  The DCM said that U.S. companies need open and 
</p><p>clear regulations in order to encourage them to invest. 
</p><p>Zannini acknowledged the benefits of the U.S.-style of 
</p><p>business-government relations, which he said was superior to 
</p><p>the common practice in Europe. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p>COMMENT 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11.  (C) As Secretary of the Presidency Oscar Parrilli did in 
</p><p>his recent meeting with the DCM (See reftel B), Kirchner's 
</p><p>inner circle always attempts to allay our concerns regarding 
</p><p>Argentina's relationship with Venezuela.  Although the GOA's 
</p><p>goals in their dealings with Chavez are primarily economic, 
</p><p>Chavez's primary goals are political.  President Kirchner is 
</p><p>playing a dangerous game as he is drawing Argentina ever 
</p><p>closer to Venezuela.  Chavez, and his ally Fidel Castro, are 
</p><p>much more capable and adept at manipulating regional politics 
</p><p>than is President Kirchner.  Kirchner likely thinks he can 
</p><p>continue to strengthen his ties to the leftist bloc in Latin 
</p><p>America, while maintaining positive relations with the United 
</p><p>States.  Kirchner's foreign policy ineptness and lack of 
</p><p>competent international relations advisors will likely 
</p><p>prevent him from understanding the potential negative 
</p><p>consequences of his actions. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12.  (C) Our experience has been that the GOA is difficult 
</p><p>government to work with and one with a lack of foreign policy 
</p><p>expertise.  The Kirchner administration's lack of 
</p><p>understanding in the international relations area, coupled 
</p><p>with their sophomoric, 1970s leftist tendencies, make them 
</p><p>easily susceptible to manipulation by more radical regional 
</p><p>leaders, such as Chavez and Castro.  It is therefore 
</p><p>extremely important for the U.S., both in Washington and in 
</p><p>Buenos Aires, to actively engage the GOA at a high level at 
</p><p>this critical juncture to avoid any further slippage of 
</p><p>Argentina towards the Chavez orbit.  Despite differences, we 
</p><p>have been able to achieve excellent cooperation with the GOA 
</p><p>on a range of issues, including counternarcotics, 
</p><p>counterterrorism, non-proliferation and in Haiti.  We need to 
</p><p>further reach out to the GOA to achieve more cooperation in 
</p><p>other areas.  The consequences of not maintaining a fluid 
</p><p>dialogue with the GOA can only be negative for the U.S.  END 
</p><p>COMMENT.
