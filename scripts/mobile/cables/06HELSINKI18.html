¶1. (C) Following up on reftels, PolChief called on MFA 
Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia Matti Turunen to 
discuss Belarus. The GOF views a joint US-EU demarche to 
Lukashenko in advance of the March election as imperative, 
Turunen said.  Finland, for its part, would welcome a very 
strongly worded demarche demanding widespread democratic 
reforms and an early invitation to OSCE/OHDIR observers. 
Finland also would not oppose a tough message to Lukashenko 
demanding he not run.  However, Turunen cautioned, 
flexibility on this point is key and the US and the EU cannot 
afford to deadlock over language, because a joint demarche 
showing US-EU solidarity will send a stronger message and 
prove more effective in the long run than will the demand 
that he not run, which he will simply ignore.  In any case, 
Turunen concluded, Finland supports fully the concept of a 
joint demarche and expects that consensus on language can be 
reached, perhaps during the political directors' meeting next 
week. 
 
¶2. (C) Turunen noted that convincing Russia to become 
involved in a dialogue with Belarus would also be helpful. 
He admitted that getting Russia to agree to a strong demarche 
similar to what the US and EU hope to deliver amounted to 
"wishful thinking."  However, he said that the GOF, now an EU 
Troika member, would encourage EU-Russian discussions aimed 
at encouraging reform in Belarus. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: Over the past several months, Finland has 
attempted bilaterally to open working level discussions with 
Belarus on "safe" issues of shared concern -- including 
Baltic Sea and other environmental cooperation, nuclear 
safety, and accreditation of non-resident diplomats -- but 
has been rebuffed on all fronts.  Nevertheless, we are 
pleased to see that the GOF is making more pro-active efforts 
to address problems in Belarus, and particularly that it is 
now seeking to engage Moscow.  End Comment.
