¶1. (C) On August 19, we delivered reftel demarche to Carlos 
Cordero at the MFA's Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and 
Organized Crime, who is following Western Sahara 
developments. Cordero said that if one party did not accept 
the envoy, then he (Walsum) could not be an effective 
mediator. The GOCR therefore believed it would be very 
difficult to hold talks with Walsum as mediator since he had 
lost confidence. 
 
¶2. (C) Cordero noted that the GOCR still favored the old 
Baker plan as a solution. He added that the parties should be 
given every opportunity to decide their fate, with all of the 
options at their disposal -- including the option of 
independence. Cordero said the GOCR would prefer the idea of 
holding talks with another facilitator, such as 
Under-Secretary-General Lynn Pascoe.
