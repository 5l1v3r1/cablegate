¶1. (C) Acting PolEcon Counselor Tom Walsh delivered demarche 
points (reftel) to Jo McLeod, Policy Officer in the North 
Asia Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 
on August 2. 
 
¶2. (C) The MFAT officials said that they have taken our 
recommendation under advisement but that they could not 
immediately commit to make representations to the UNSYG. MFAT 
told Embassy that they are actively consulting with the NZ 
mission to the UN on how best to handle this issue. They 
indicated nonetheless that they completely understand and 
share our objectives. MFAT has promised to provide a more 
specific reply as soon as possible. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Background on New Zealand's diplomatic relations 
with PRC: The Joint Communique on the Establishment of 
Diplomatic Relations between New Zealand and the People's 
Republic of China (signed December 1972) sets out the 
formula for mutual recognition of New Zealand and the PRC. 
The relevant wording in the Joint CommuniquQ is as follows: 
"The Chinese Government reaffirms that Taiwan is an 
inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic 
of China and that Taiwan is a province of the People's 
Republic of China." The New Zealand Government acknowledges 
this position of the Chinese Government. The New Zealand 
Government recognizes the Government of the People's 
Republic of China as the sole legal government of China."
