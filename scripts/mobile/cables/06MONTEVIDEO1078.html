<br>SUBJECT: URUGUAY DEMARCHED ON COUNTRY RESOLUTIONS AT UN 
<br>THIRD COMMITTEE 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. STATE 184178 
<br>     ¶B. STATE 182267 
<br> 
<br></pre></p></div><p>for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) On November 8, Political Counselor met with the MFA's 
Director for Political Affairs Alvaro Gallardo, his Deputy 
Gerardo Pratto and acting Director for Multilateral Affairs 
Beatriz Nunez to deliver ref A senior level demarche and to 
discuss country specific human rights resolutions.  (Note: 
Ref B demarche was delivered on November 6 to Beatriz Nunez 
but without any substantive feedback. End Note.) 
 
¶2. (C) After carefully listening to ref A demarche and 
reviewing information contained in ref B, Ambassador Gallardo 
made the following points: 
 
#¿NOMBRE?
of the resolutions. 
 
#¿NOMBRE?
resolutions. 
 
#¿NOMBRE?
Mercosur partners. 
 
-- Uruguay is not enthusiastic about ""no action"" motions, but 
will vote them if Mercosur advises. 
 
-- Without a doubt, all of the five countries in question 
have serious human rights problems. 
 
#¿NOMBRE?
how best to treat these five countries and how to evaluate 
the resolutions brought against the United States and Canada. 
 
¶3. (C) Gallardo elaborated somewhat by saying, ""Uruguay does 
not put developed countries like the U.S. and Canada in the 
same 'bad boat' as Iran, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Burma or North 
Korea -- but we don't like the war in Iraq or secret 
detention centers either. We will probably support Canada, 
though there might be some merit to carefully examining its 
treatment of indigenous peoples. We have been receiving a lot 
of pressure to go light on Iran  -- and I don't mean just 
from our rice growers. Sudan, the DPRK and Uzbekistan have 
serious human rights problems.  The point is, however, that 
Mercosur countries believe that developed countries also need 
to be held accountable.""  Gallardo concluded by saying that 
Uruguay would closely examine all of the resolutions before 
the UN's Third Committee, including the Belarusian one 
co-sponsored by Uzbekistan. 
 
Comment: 
------- 
 
¶4. (C) Though Gallardo did not explicitly state it, we 
strongly suspect that he was referring to Venezuela when he 
said that Uruguay was being pressured to go light on Iran. 
Last week, in advance of the Ibero-American Summit here 
Uruguay's Congress rushed to ratify the BRV's full membership 
in Mercosur. In recent months, we've detected a distinct 
tendency for our MFA colleagues to emphasize that the GOU's 
foreign policy is being coordinated with Mercosur. During our 
conversation Gallardo put a brave face on Panama being picked 
as the compromise candidate for the semi-permanent UNSC seat. 
 He said Uruguay kept ""faithful"" to its commitment to 
Venezuela and serenely accepted the fact that Mercosur ""did 
not reach a consensus"" to support Uruguay for the spot.  End
