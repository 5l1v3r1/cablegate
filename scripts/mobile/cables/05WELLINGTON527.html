¶1.  (C) Pol/Econ Couns shared reftel information with Deborah 
Panckhurst, Deputy Director of the Disarmament Division at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, stressing our 
desire that New Zealand adopt a similar policy.  Panckhurst 
promised to review the E.O. closely and said that she would 
take our request on board. 
 
¶2.  (C) Panckhurst noted, however, that as New Zealand 
approaches general elections (expected to be called for 
mid-September) government bureaucrats are resisting putting 
forward any new initiatives for Ministers' consideration. 
This is standard practice in     New Zealand, and is designed 
to prevent a Government close to the end of its term from 
putting forward new legislation or policies that an incoming 
Government might not favor.
