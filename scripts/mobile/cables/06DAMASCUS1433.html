¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Key opposition figure XXXXXXXXXXXX met with 
Poloff on March 26 to discuss a number of issues.  XXXXXXXXXXXX 
confirmed that he is not applying for MEPI funding during 
this application cycle, but remains interested in pursuing 
other, "indirect" funding mechanisms from the USG.  XXXXXXXXXXXX 
detailed XXXXXXXXXXXX most recent interrogation with SARG authorities, during which time XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX.  He also commented on recent Syria-related 
events, including the Brammertz report and the formation of 
the National Salvation Front in Brussels, as well as 
discussing his own future political plans.  He also called on 
the USG to work more closely together with the EU on human 
rights issues.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX NOT APPLYING FOR MEPI FUNDING THIS CYCLE,  HAS 
LONG-TERM INTEREST IN ASSISTANCE:  Key opposition figure XXXXXXXXXXXX met with Poloff in his office on March 26.  During 
discussions, XXXXXXXXXXXX made clear that he was not currently 
pursuing MEPI funding, nor is anyone pursuing funding on his 
behalf.  XXXXXXXXXXXX also made clear that he is still interested in 
USG funding in the mid- to long-term, but only indirect 
support and at the right time.  "We have time to discuss 
this," said XXXXXXXXXXXX and went on to make clear that this is not 
the right time.  XXXXXXXXXXXX also raised again the fact that many of 
his fellow opposition figures are in dire financial straits. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX. (NOTE: XXXXXXXXXXXX 
noted that he himself is receiving approximately $2000 
monthly from his relatives, although his extended family has 
come under recent security scrutiny regarding this support.) 
 
¶3.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX 
 
¶4. (C)  STATE OF THE SARG: NERVOUS AFTER BRAMMERTZ, BUT 
SHOULD NOT BE WORRIED ABOUT NSF: According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the SARG 
has been acting very nervous of late "as if they're expecting 
something unusual."  XXXXXXXXXXXX attributed this nervousness to the 
most recent Brammertz report, calling it "clever" for not 
revealing everything and "waiting for the right time." 
Brammertz is going slowly, and "one statement could explode 
everything."  XXXXXXXXXXXX speculated that President Bashar al-Asad 
himself could be accused. (For more reaction on the Brammertz 
report, see ref A.) 
 
¶5.  (C)  On the other hand, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the SARG should 
not be worried about the new National Salvation Front (NSF) 
recently formed in Brussels (ref B).  Former Vice President 
Abdulhalim Khaddam, one of the de facto co-leaders of the NSF 
coalition, along with Muslim Brotherhood head Ali Sadreddin 
Bayanouni, is hated by a large section of Syrian society, 
said XXXXXXXXXXXX.  If Khaddam tries to lead the opposition, the 
movement will be unsuccessful as it would lack credibility. 
The MB, for its part, has more credibility and potential, but 
is not at present a major organized political force in Syria. 
 The MB, said XXXXXXXXXXXX, is also not accepted by the (generally 
pro-regime) Syrian Islamist establishment. 
 
¶6. (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX FUTURE PLANS:  XXXXXXXXXXXX plans to use the next two 
months to prepare for the launch of his party and to develop 
a party platform.  He will be ready to announce it at "the 
right time" in about 6-8 weeks.  The founding group will be 
 
DAMASCUS 00001433  002 OF 002 
 
 
more exclusive than originally planned, with a maximum of 
12-15 people.  When asked about the role of external actors 
in opposition politics, XXXXXXXXXXXX said it is important to focus on 
the internal opposition until the party is firmly 
established.  This means no cooperation or partnership with 
the foreign opposition or foreign countries.  He returned to 
his theme of wanting to form a bona fide establishment versus 
having a one-man show, noting that his current status as the 
central figure in the opposition continues to put him in 
danger.  Forming a "real party" would provide "real 
protection" for himself. 
 
¶7.  (C) COMMENTS ON USG STATEMENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION: 
XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that the street is very anti-American at the 
moment, but maintained that the recent USG statement on the 
human rights situation in Syria was nonetheless a good thing. 
 He noted that he continues to research and speak about the 
positive situation of Muslims in the U.S., trying to 
counteract SARG propaganda that the U.S. is anti-Islam. 
(NOTE: Post is working with XXXXXXXXXXXX office to provide him with 
articles and materials about the Muslim community in the U.S. 
END NOTE.)  He encouraged the USG to issue joint statements 
with the EU, noting that European diplomats told him that 
their governments will start pushing the SARG hard on human 
rights issues within the next two weeks.  He noted that the 
SARG still feels it has business connections with the EU, but 
with the USG there is "no hope." 
 
¶8.  (C) COMMENT:  The relentless pressure and threats on XXXXXXXXXXXX 
and his family since his release seem finally to be having 
their expected impact for the SARG, forcing XXXXXXXXXXXX to lower his 
profile to the point of near-zero visibility.  While he seems 
relatively confident that the SARG will come forward with a 
political parties law in the next two months, we are less 
sanguine XXXXXXXXXXXX His point that forming a political party will help shield him 
from SARG repression also seems debatable.  XXXXXXXXXXXX is more 
persuasive when he points to Khaddam's lack of political 
support inside Syria, a point many of our contacts make, 
although some of the savviest among them refuse to dismiss 
Khaddam completely as an embittered has-been with no 
political future in Syria.  XXXXXXXXXXXX case illuminates just how 
difficult it is for a potentially influential opposition 
figure to make any significant organizational or media move 
to increase that influence without arousing immediate 
repressive action by the SARG, including threats to do harm 
to family members.  Given those dynamics, it is hard to see 
how the internal (secular) opposition will ever be able to 
pose much of a challenge to the regime.  Islamist and Kurdish 
leaders have potential "street" power behind them that the 
secular forces lack.  XXXXXXXXXXXX has the potential to make inroads 
among these groups, too, which explains why the SARG has 
subjected him to such intense pressure since it released him.
