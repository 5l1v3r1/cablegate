¶1. (C) Deborah Panckhust, officer in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade's (MFAT) Disarmament Division, says that 
MFAT lawyers have now approved the U.S. draft text for the 
Zheleznogorsk MOU.  However, the MOU must now be approved by 
Foreign Minister Winston Peters and Defense Minister Phil 
Goff.  As they had already approved the agreement in 
principle, Panckhurst is optimistic that they will give their 
OK within the week. 
 
¶2.  (C) Panckhurst said that GNZ is mindful that they must 
spend the proposed funds by June 30, the end of New Zealand's 
fiscal year.  She is hopeful the agreement can be approved 
and signed in time.
