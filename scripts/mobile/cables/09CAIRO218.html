  		<h1>EGYPTIAN VIEWS ON COUNTER PIRACY, SOMALIA AND SUDAN REF: A. KHARTOUM 51 B. KHARTOUM 75 Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs William R. Stewart for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(C) Summary: The Egyptian MFA's Cabinet Advisor on African Affairs told us February 5 that Egypt believes "substantial progress" on Somalia was made in Djibouti over the past two weeks. The Government of Egypt (GOE) supports the election of Shaykh Sharif Shaykh Ahmed as President of Somalia. The GOE also advocates for international support for the new Somali Government to help provide security. Egypt will host, in March, both the plenary session and working Group 4 of the Contact Group on Piracy of the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS). Egypt is concerned that Qatari and UN efforts to bring Darfur rebel groups to the negotiating table are undermining Minni Minawi and the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA). Egypt also feels that a recent report, released by the UN SYG, reflect international acceptance of the eventual partition of Sudan and does not promote the unity of the country. End Summary. -------------------------------------- Egypt Cautiously Optimistic on Somalia --------------------------------------</h1>
