¶1. PolCouns on February 23 raised ref a points regarding USG 
policy on Iran's Tehran research reactor with Counselor 
Rashid Al-Hajiri, MFA's desk officer for Iran.  Al-Hajiri 
offered no substantive response to our points, noting merely 
that the GOK has been following the issue through its 
representative to the IAEA.  Al-Hajiri added that the GOK 
shares USG concerns about the lack of transparency in Iran's 
nuclear program and regularly encourages Iran to comply with 
international safeguards. At the same time, Al-Hajiri said, 
the GOK hopes that the international community can persuade 
Iran to come into compliance through peaceful dialogue rather 
than through expanded sanctions. 
 
¶2. Comment: Al-Hajiri's tepid response to our demarche 
reflects the overall GOK approach to Iran which, as noted Ref 
B, consists of quietly urging Tehran to abide by IAEA 
safeguards while maintaining a friendly relationship with its 
much larger and more powerful neighbor.  Trapped in a 
difficult neighborhood, the GOK will welcome any proposals 
that can move Iran off its nuclear path -- including IAEA 
proposals noted ref A to ensure that Iran receives needed 
medical isotopes -- but will not expose itself to Iranian ire 
by getting out front to push for these.  Emblematic of 
Kuwait's position was the statement by Deputy PM and FM 
Shaykh Dr. Mohammad Al Sabah February 22, who told the local 
press that "We wish our friends (in Iran) can do their best 
to reassure the international community about the Iranian 
nuclear program so that there will not be an excuse for 
imposing sanctions.  There are wise people in Iran," he 
added, continuing to call on Iran to abide by the requirments 
of international legitimacy and the IAEA.  End Comment.
