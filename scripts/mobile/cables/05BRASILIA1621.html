Amorim noted that he had received a call from Brazilian Ambassador Abdenur on June 15, shortly after Abdenur spoke with U/S Burns. Amorim also said that he had spoken with the Secretary and others on a conference call about Haiti on the morning of June 16, and that after the main Haiti discussion, Abdenur and the Secretary spoke briefly about UN reform.

</p><p>¶2. (C) Looking tired and disappointed, Amorim told the Ambassador that he had been advised by the Secretary that the US would support only two new permanent UNSC members. "At least", Amorim shrugged, "the US is finally in the game." He said that he would have to consult with the other G-4 members "as well as the Africans" before he could provide us a response. However, he noted that Brazil supports the US on many of the broader UN reform issues such as the Peace Building Commission, management reforms, and "in general" on the Human Rights Council (though, Amorim said, "we sometimes disagree with you on individual Human Rights issues"). 
</p><p>¶3. (C) As the Ambassador reviewed the US position on broader reforms, Amorim urged that the US not delay on UNSC reform, saying delay would "cause us to lose momentum on the broader reforms." The Ambassador noted that the US does not oppose UNSC reform, but wants to make sure that we "do the doable" on broader reforms and not let all progress be blocked by discussions on difficult topics like the UNSC. Amorim commented that "we are disappointed that your ideas are so far from ours". Amorim twice said that in his conversation with the Secretary "she implied a time precedence" of broader reforms before UNSC reforms. 
</p><p>¶4. (C) Amorim said that he does not plan to be in the US before September, but that he will attend the Iraq conference in Brussels and would be available to meet with the Secretary, but in the meantime he must consult with the G-4 SIPDIS members.
