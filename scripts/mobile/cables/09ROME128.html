¶1. (C/NF) Madame Secretary, as I depart Rome after three and 
a half years, permit me the privilege of passing on my 
thoughts to you on the state of U.S. - Italian relations. 
Throughout the post-war period, in particular since the end 
of the Cold War, Italy has been a staunch, reliable, and 
serious partner to the U.S. on the international issues that 
matter most to us.  When all is said and done, Italy has come 
through every time, providing substantive contributions to 
our shared tasks operationally and politically, although we 
have not always given the GOI the level of recognition 
offered to other important allies.  Given the strategic tasks 
ahead and the asks we will shortly make of Italy on issues 
ranging from Afghanistan to the shutdown of Guantanamo, it 
would be worth expending a little capital up front to smooth 
the way. 
 
¶2. (C/NF) Italy is one of the pillars of our relationship 
with Europe and is indispensable to any effort to harness 
European resources to address our common global concerns. As 
a member of NATO, the European Union, and the G8, Italy has 
participated in the heavy-lifting of international efforts to 
defeat the Taliban and establish a democratically-based 
government in Afghanistan, to end the bloodshed and bring 
stability to the Balkans, to protect Israel from the effects 
of extremist attacks and provide stability to Lebanon, and to 
help Iraq recover from years of repression by assisting in 
the economic and political development of the country, in 
particular in the development of its security sector.  Italy 
provides a unique geostrategic platform within Europe for 
U.S. forces, allowing us to reach easily into troubled areas 
throughout the Middle East, Africa and Europe.  And because 
of that advantage, Italy is home to the most comprehensive 
set of military capabilities - from the 173rd Airborne to 
cutting edge Global Hawks - that we have anywhere outside the 
United States.  Most importantly, Italy has shown a 
willingness, and even an eagerness, to partner with the U.S. 
in addressing many of the most pressing global challenges of 
our age. 
 
¶3. (C/NF) This is not to say that Italy is always an ideal 
partner for U.S. efforts.  Italy's slow but real economic 
decline threatens its ability to play in the international 
arena.  Its leadership frequently lacks strategic vision - a 
characteristic developed through decades of unstable and 
short-lived coalition governments.  Italy's institutions are 
not as well- or as properly-developed as one would expect for 
a modern European country.  Italian leaders' unwillingness 
and inability to address many of the chronic problems that 
plague their society - an non-competitive economic system, 
decaying infrastructure, rising debt, and endemic corruption 
- have caused concern among Italy's partners and given the 
impression of feckless and inefficient governance.  PM Silvio 
Berlusconi has inadvertently come to symbolize this image. 
His frequent verbal gaffes and poor choice of words have 
offended nearly every demographic in Italy and many EU 
leaders.  His perceived willingness to put personal interests 
above those of the state, his preference for short-term 
solutions over long-term investment, and his frequent use of 
public institutions and resources to gain electoral advantage 
over his political adversaries has harmed Italy's reputation 
in Europe and has provided an unfortunately comic tone to 
Italy's reputation in many quarters of the U.S. government. 
 
¶4. (C/NF) That said, on foreign policy, Italy has made many 
efforts - some serious and some not - to maintain a position 
of global relevance and influence.  Italy often has not 
allocated sufficient military, economic, or diplomatic 
resources to lead, or often even to participate, in many of 
the international community's challenges, but when asked by 
us, has come through and supported our leadership, whether in 
Iraq, Afghanistan, or the Middle East.  While stagnant growth 
has produced budgetary pressures, much more worrisome is the 
GOI's unwillingness to make smart choices in support of 
alliance requirements.  Frequently, Italy has tried to 
compensate for its lack of resource allocation by proposing 
to be the world's great mediator - a self-appointed role 
which politicians (particularly Berlusconi) believe can 
confer great visibility with virtually no expense.  With no 
outside coordination, Italian leaders have tried to mediate 
the West's relationship with Russia, engage with Hamas and 
Hizballah, establish new channels of negotiation with Iran, 
and expand the G8's agenda and mandate beyond recognition. 
 
¶5. (C/NF) The combination of Italy's economic decline and 
political idiosyncrasies have caused many European leaders to 
denigrate the contributions of Berlusconi and Italy.  We 
should not.  We should recognize that a long-term engagement 
with Italy and its leaders will provide us important 
strategic dividends now and in the future.  Italy's influence 
in the Balkans will help us consolidate gains painstakingly 
made over the last two decades.  Italian troops will continue 
to play an important role in peacekeeping operations in 
Lebanon and Afghanistan.  With the establishment of AFRICOM, 
Italy has become an even more significant partner in our 
power projection calculations.  As we look to the future, we 
must recognize that Italy's buy-in will be crucial to any 
common U.S.-EU energy security policy to counter Putin's 
increasingly blatant and aggressive use of energy as a tool 
for increasing Russia's influence (a Kremlin strategy that 
Italy's energy players have been supporting, unfortunately). 
Italian economic pressure, if we make a serious push, could 
be critical in sending a clear and powerful message to Tehran 
as we look to resolve the nuclear issue, and Italy's voice 
will be important as the EU and NATO look to forge stable, 
prosperous and democratic nations out of aspirant countries. 
Already, they are preparing for what they believe will be 
among the first U.S. requests - resettlement of Guantanamo 
detainees and making a broader and deeper effort in 
Afghanistan. 
 
¶6. (C/NF) PM Berlusconi regularly stresses the significance 
of Italo-American ties.  While he is not as attuned to our 
political rhythms as he is wont to believe, he is genuinely 
and deeply devoted to the relationship with the U.S.  His 
re-entry into national politics last spring brought about 
almost overnight a palpable improvement in our ability to get 
things done on an operational level.  FM Frattini is a 
serious and experienced statesman.  As Berlusconi becomes 
increasingly absorbed in domestic (i.e., economic) challenges 
confronting Italy, Frattini is increasingly charting the 
course of Italian foreign policy.  Both are eager to engage 
with you and seek direction on many of the world's immediate 
problems.  Behind them you will find a cadre of politicians 
and government officials who see coordination and contact 
with U.S. leaders and officials as fundamental to forging 
Italy's policy path in the world, and even within the EU.  To 
the degree you and your closest advisors maintain close 
contact and coordination with Italian leaders, I am convinced 
you will reap great dividends.  To the degree you find ways 
to include Italy in the group of nations that we work with 
most closely on key issues - in particular in the Middle 
East, Iran, and Afghanistan - I am convinced that you and the 
President will find myriad ways to harness Italy's great 
potential in support of U.S. strategic goals.  Most 
importantly, I would say, from a vantage point of having come 
to know Italy and its people over the course of some forty 
years, that it is well worth looking beyond the occasional 
misfires or missteps by Italian officials to recognize a 
close ally and a true friend, ready and indeed eager to renew 
a relationship of close collaboration. 
 
¶7. (C/NF) It has been an enormous privilege to serve the 
American people and government here.  I wish you and the 
President the best of luck and success in working with this 
great ally.
