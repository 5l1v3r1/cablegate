 \
¶1. (S) Summary:  A well connected Embassy contact described a \
mafia chieftain's role in helping businessmen to secure GOU \
tenders and job applicants to "buy" government jobs.  Crime \
boss Salim Abduvaliyev puts bidders for tenders in touch with \
an Iranian businessman holding British citizenship, who \
submits the paperwork to First Daughter Gulnora Karimova for \
approval.  Salim works with the Deputy Minister of Internal \
Affairs responsible for personnel issues to arrange \
government jobs, agreeing on a price and then adding his own \
fee before selling the position. Salim has reportedly sold a \
wide range of Government positions, including regional Hokim, \
police chief, and Ministry of Internal Affairs jobs.  A \
Presidential Adviser and a former Minister of the Interior \
also reportedly worked closely with Salim on job placement \
transactions.  End summary. \
 \
¶2. (S) An Embassy contact with close connections to the \
families of senior GOU officials, and distantly related to \
mafia chieftain Salim Abduvaliyev (reftel), told Poloff that \
Salim often serves as a middleman in fixing GOU tenders and \
helping applicants obtain government jobs.  Foreign investors \
can "win" GOU tenders by arranging them through Salim, who \
charges a percentage of revenues as a fee.  Many job \
applicants have approached the contact, a close friend of \
Salim's wife, Shahlo, asking for introductions to Salim in \
order to "purchase" a GOU job.  (Note: Both public and \
private sector jobs are routinely "bought" in Uzbekistan. \
End note.) \
 \
CONTRACT AND TENDER GRAFT \
------------------------- \
 \
¶3.  (S) According to the contact, Salim locates foreign and \
other investors interested in GOU tenders, putting them in \
touch with an Iranian businessman holding British \
citizenship.  The Iranian prepares the paperwork, submitting \
the tender to First Daughter Gulnora Karimova for approval. \
(Note: According to the contact, former Deputy PM Dilbar \
Gulomova's son works for this Iranian.  End note.)  Tenders \
arranged through this process reportedly include the Dutch \
Gemka (ph) firm's railway investment in Bukhara, which \
required paying Salim a $700,000 fee, a Swiss/Israeli \
company's water project in the Tashkent region, and a Korean \
company's large-scale contract to provide computers to \
schools. \
 \
GOU JOBS FOR SALE! \
------------------ \
 \
¶4.  (S) A man named "Abror hoja" brings job applicants to \
Salim, who discusses the price of the purchase and \
facilitates the transaction.  The contact said that Salim has \
sold a wide range of government positions, including regional \
Hokim, regional police chief, and high and mid-ranking jobs \
at the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Salim works closely \
with Tursinkhan Hudaibergenov, Deputy Minister of Internal \
Affairs for personnel issues, to facilitate GOU job \
placements.  Salim agrees on a price with Hudaibergenov, \
before adding his own fee, and selling the position at the \
higher price.  (Note: The contact said that Salim closely \
cooperated in the past on such job purchase transactions with \
State Adviser to the President Ismail Jurabekov, and former \
Minister of Interior Zokir Almatov.  End note.) \
 \
¶5. (S) In one example of Salim's sway over GOU personnel \
decisions, a regional mayor appealed to him for help \
retaining his job after he came under pressure to resign. \
The wife of Maksim Teshebaev, the mayor of Tashkent's \
region's Orta Chirchik district, approached Salim's wife \
asking for Salim's support.  For the right price, Salim \
promised that Teshebaev would be able to retain his job. \
According to the contact, Salim instructed Teshebaev to make \
a payment to his brother, Azamjon Abduvaliyev, in order to \
retain the job.  But after the payment was made, Salim \
reportedly mocked the amount of money Teshebaev offered, \
 \
TASHKENT 00000902  002.2 OF 002 \
 \
 \
saying he "couldn't eat a meal" for that amount. \
 \
¶6. (S) Comment: Salim's role in securing GOU tenders and jobs \
sheds further light on the close connections between \
organized crime and the GOU (reftel).  Corruption is rampant \
in the GOU. Tenders and government positions can be fairly \
easily secured by paying the right amount of money to the \
appropriate individual, leading to a situation in which \
unqualified individuals have every incentive to engage in \
further corrupt activity to pay off the large debts they \
usually incur making down payments on the jobs. \
