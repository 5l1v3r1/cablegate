  		<h1>REFORM FATIGUE AT THE HOUSING MINISTRY Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) ------- Summary -------1.(SBU) In a recent meeting, Egypt's Housing Minister Ahmed El-Maghraby told the Ambassador that Egypt needed to maintain a "certain balance" between the government and civil society and suggested that the recent pace of government reform may have been too rapid for the country to absorb. A committed reformer, El-Magraby appeared somewhat frustrated by the challenges of actually implementing reform. He told the Ambassador that he appreciated the technical assistance provided by both the US and the EU and that the high rate of growth in the Egyptian economy over the past few years had greatly increased his Ministry's budget. He remained optimistic that economic reform, albeit at a more moderate pace, would continue. ---------------------------------------- Civil Planning, Permits and Rent Control ----------------------------------------</h1>
