(SBU) In response to delivery of USG non-paper on U.S. 
Ballistic Missile Defense in Europe, Czech MFA Political 
Director Ivo Sramek noted that he is pleased that we are 
having an ongoing dialogue and that we are all examining ways 
to advance U.S.-Czech strategic collaboration.  He did not 
have substantive comments on the paper on October 1, although 
he noted that the MFA is collaborating with the MoD to flesh 
out the September 17 paper "Beyond the Missile Defense Review 
- The Way Forward in Strategic Cooperation." Sramek noted 
that this coming paper will add greater detail and 
specificity to the original paper the Czechs handed over.  He 
also noted that he would be discussing it on October 2 with 
FM Kohout and that they hope to be able to provide it to us 
early next week.  He noted that the approach in this coming 
paper is in keeping with the Kohout-S dialogue in New York on 
the UNGA margins, where the Secretary encouraged the Czechs 
to "think broadly" about cooperation and not simply to focus 
on military cooperation. 
 
¶2. (C) Following this meeting, MFA Political Director Ivan 
Pocuch told emboff that within the MFA and MoD this paper was 
ready last week to hand over and that it was quite detailed 
and focused on the strategic relationship.  This paper, 
however, was held up by FM Kohout who felt that it was much 
too narrowly focused.  Pocuch and his Deputy, Petr 
Chalupecky, plan to press hard for this paper to be clearly 
prioritized and focused before it is handed over to us.  He 
also stated that from his point of view it is most important 
that we know that the Czechs wish to be involved in a 
substantive way in this new security architecture, however it 
evolves. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Separately Defense Attache Wally Scales met with MoD 
Director of Security Policy Ivan Dvorak and delivered this 
paper.  According to Colonel Scales, Dvorak commented on the 
High Level Defense Group meeting to note that the first week 
of November was fine for the Czechs and that they hoped to 
see USG participation at the level of Under Secretary of 
Defense Flournoy.
