¶1. (C) Summary -- An advisor to Italian Economics and Finance 
Minister Tremonti foreshadowed a quite different Italian 
position on financial market reform than post has heard from 
other Finance Ministry and Bank of Italy officials (reftel). 
In particular, in a conversation November 7 we were told that 
Tremonti ""has always been a Bretton Woods II guy,"" and 
continues to favor a major overhaul of the IFIs and the 
global financial regulatory regime.  As for the position it 
will take at the upcoming G-20 Washington summit, Italy is 
""aligned with the French, talking to Britain, and at 
loggerheads with the Germans.""  Coordination between the Bank 
of Italy and the Finance Ministry in advising Italian 
political leaders is poor, according to the advisor. 
Washington officials may find in the Bank of Italy's 
President Mario Draghi a useful counterweight to Tremonti's 
far reaching regulatory reform ambitions.  Washington may 
also seek further changes in Italy's position as PM 
Berlusconi, Draghi and Tremonti enter the discussions with an 
apparently divided position. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Francesco Galietti is Counselor to Economics and 
Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti. Galietti has had a long 
association with Tremonti, who brought him into government 
from the private sector earlier this year. Galietti is almost 
certainly closer to Tremonti than is Carlo Baldocci, with 
whom we spoke earlier this week (reftel).  In a frank 
conversation with econoffs November 7, Galietti (protect) 
conveyed Tremonti's view of Italy's objectives at the 
Washington Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy. 
 
 
¶3.  (C) Galietti indicated that Tremonti intends to give a 
speech at London's Chatham House early next week, enroute to 
Washington, urging the permanent expansion of the G8 
(mentioning Brazil, India and China specifically) and calling 
again for a comprehensive restructuring of international 
financial market regulation.  Galietti said Tremonti wants 
the IMF to assume a new role in financial sector supervision, 
and the World Bank to regulate international financial flows, 
but added that Tremonti has not outlined details of this 
proposal. 
 
¶4. (C) In the run up to the Washington summit, Italy is 
""aligned with the French, talking with Britain, and at 
loggerheads with Germany"", according to Galietti.  The French 
are pushing for broad and deep changes in financial market 
regulation, along lines Tremonti has previously articulated. 
France even favors regulation of executive compensation, 
which Galietti characterized as political grandstanding of no 
real consequence to banks' financial health.  According to 
our contacts and press reports, Britain is urging the 
creation of a pan-European stability fund that the Italians 
seem to like, especially as they have taken a similar 
approach in shoring up the Italian financial sector (note: 
next week the GOI will announce a plan to support Italian 
banks further by issuing callable bonds in the government's 
name to raise banks' capital).  Germany, says Galietti, 
remains overly concerned about inflation, resisting further 
ECB rate cuts and generally opposing any proposal that German 
voters might interpret as bailing out foreigners. 
 
¶5. (C) Galietti is aware that Italian technocrats, especially 
in the Central Bank, favor a more cautious approach to 
financial market regulatory reform.  A loyal lieutenant, he 
professes that Tremonti's way is the right way, adding that 
there is poor coordination between the Central Bank and the 
Finance Ministry in providing economic policy advice to 
political leaders.  Worse, there is no independent economic 
policy element in PM Berlusconi's office, so the PM is likely 
being pulled in opposing directions by his key economic 
advisors. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: Galietti's readout is considerably different 
from that of Baldocci to us November 5.  This should come as 
no surprise, however, as Italian policy remains in flux and 
the two officials come from different backgrounds.  Baldocci 
is a career Foreign Affairs Ministry diplomat, while Galietti 
is a personally loyal adviser of the Minister.  We believe 
Tremonti's predilections, as outlined by Galietti, could 
strongly influence Italy's position at the G-20 and, later, 
during Italy's presidency of the G-8.  A possible 
counterweight to Tremonti, Central Bank President Mario 
Draghi, will attend the summit as a representative of the 
Financial Stability Forum and not of the GOI.  Still, it may 
be to the USG's benefit to highlight and promote Draghi's 
expertise in conversations with the Italian delegation, so as 
to blunt Tremonti's more draconian reform impulses.
