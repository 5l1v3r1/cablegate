<br> 
<br></pre></p></div><p> 
1.(C) SUMMARY, COMMENT, AND ACTION REQUEST: On December 19, 
the Malaysian press reported the 2007 theft of a J-85 
aircraft engine (for the F-5 aircraft).  Subsequent reports 
indicated that, in fact, two engines had been stolen and sold 
to an international company in South America.  The story has 
been front-page news in Malaysia's government-influenced 
press and uncensored blogosphere since then.  In recent days, 
Post has queried Malaysian interlocutors on the current 
location of the engines.  They either do not know the 
location or have been instructed to withhold information 
while a police investigation continues.  Malaysian 
interlocutors also have not provided adequate explanation as 
to why, after two years, this incident has just now become 
public. 
 
2.(C) Comment:  We do not yet have sufficient command of the 
facts to determine whether this story will have significant 
domestic repercussions.  The Prime Minister will have a 
personal stake, given his past role as Defense Minister, and 
that could explain in part his prominence in the media 
coverage of this issue thus far.  More important, however, 
from the perspective of U.S. interests, is how this case can 
be used to advance our call for a more effective export 
control regime in Malaysia.  Our strongest leverage, it 
appears, is the need for Malaysia to persuade us that 
military transfers subject to the Arms Export Control Act can 
be carried out with confidence in the Malaysians ability and 
will to comply with our law and regulation. 
 
3.(C) Action Request:  Post requests (a) clarification as to 
whether Section 3 of the Arms Export Control Act has been 
violated, (b) talking points for use with GOM interlocutors 
(see suggestions para 10)and (c) press guidance on this issue 
(see suggestion para 11).  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. 
 
Disclosure Brings Extraordinary Attention 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The missing engine first became public knowledge 
when Defense Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi disclosed the 
information to the New Straits Times, a government-influenced 
newspaper, on December 19. (Comment: this was the same day 
that the opposition coalition Pakatan Rakyat (PR) held its 
first-ever convention--an event likely to overshadow the 
DefMin's announcement.  End Comment.)  Other media outlets, 
both government-influenced and independent online media, 
quickly picked up on the story and began intense coverage, 
and as of December 23 the story was being reported in 
regional and international publications, including the 
Singapore Business Times and the UK's Financial Times.  Some 
news reports indicate that the engine was detected missing as 
early as 2007, but according to Hamidi the engine was 
detected missing in May 2008, though no decision was made to 
report the incident to the police for investigation until 
August 2008.  (Note: PM Najib was the Defense Minister at the 
time the engine disappeared.  End Note.)  Attorney General 
Gani Patail stated that his office only received the 
investigation papers from the police in November 2009, and 
that since then his office has sent the investigation back to 
the police with further directives.  Hamidi initially 
disclosed that a single F5 fighter jet engine worth 50 
million Malaysian Ringgit (approximately $15 million USD) had 
been sold to an international company based in South America. 
  Since then the missing inventory has expanded to include a 
second engine worth another 50 million Ringgit, additional 
support parts (no details available), and indications that 
the 'international company' is an arms dealer.  The Utusan, 
the party newspaper of the ruling United Malays National 
Organization (UMNO) party, reported on December 23 that the 
company involved in the purchasing of the engines was a 
Malaysian company based in another (unspecified) country. 
Armed Forces chief General Azizan Ariffan, who was then the 
Air Force chief, sought to justify the news blackout by 
stating that although they "reported the loss of the jet 
engine last year...investigations are still being carried out 
by the police." 
 
¶5. (C) The Prime Minister commented on the incident, calling 
for complete transparency and vowing to punish those 
involved.  Najib praised the leadership of the Defense 
Ministry and the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) for their 
actions to date, stating "to the credit of the RMAF and 
MinDef, there was no intention of covering up (the theft) at 
all.  I was the minister in charge at the time and I decided 
it should be reported to the police."  Perhaps even more 
telling than the PM's statement, the government-influenced 
media took the unprecedented step of publicly condemning the 
military, openly calling the armed forces "arms dealers," 
though they refrained from criticizing then-Defense Minister 
 
KUALA LUMP 00001013  002 OF 003 
 
 
Najib. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Public criticism continues to boil since news of the 
missing engine became public.  Opposition politicians 
immediately capitalized on the incident, with Democratic 
Action Party leader Lim Kit Siang calling the Prime 
Minister's response "a frightening picture of a government of 
thieves."  Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS) spokesman Idris 
Ahmad said that the sale could have only occurred through 
"powerful people," and added that "we don't want only the 
anchovies to be arrested while the sharks are allowed to swim 
freely."  Armed Forces Chief Azizan said "their act 
jeopardizes national security.  They are traitors and should 
be punished for treason."  Opposition Member of Parliament 
(MP) Liew Chin Tong expressed deep concern, because "no one 
knows how many other military assets are stolen in this 
manner," suggesting that the engine or other military assets 
could have been transferred to undesirable parties to include 
Iran.  The Singapore Business Times, quoting the New Straits 
Times, said the engines were shipped to a Middle Eastern 
country that "was the subject of U.S. sanctions." (Note: post 
could not find this quotation in the New Straits Times.  End 
Note.) Editorials in government-influenced newspapers have 
also questioned why the police were the only ones involved 
with the investigation, who is powerful enough to steal/sell 
$30 million in jet engines, why the Air Force chief was 
promoted to Armed Forces chief, and the extent of other 
military munitions that may have been sold illegally. 
According to independent online Malaysiakini's December 23 
editorial, "if two tons of jet engine can go missing, how 
many grenades, M16s, bullets, etc have gone missing?  Is this 
why the West thinks we support Muslim militants?" 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶7. (C) Post understands that aircraft engines are classified 
as defense articles on the United States Munitions List, the 
unauthorized transfer of which is a violation of Section 3 of 
the Arms Export Control Act.  Post requests clarification 
whether the J-85 aircraft engines reported as missing in 
Malaysia indeed fall under this category. 
 
Lack of GOM Reporting 
--------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) Within the last year, Post has identified at least 
three opportunities in which the Malaysian Air Force or 
Defence Ministry should have notified the U.S. of the missing 
engines: 
 
-- In January 2009, in accordance with USAF regulations, the 
Malaysian Air Force submitted an inventory recertification 
listing of J-85 engines to the USAF J-85 engine program 
manager.  There were no discrepancies identified to Post in 
this inventory. 
 
-- In March 2009, the Malaysian Air Force advised Post they 
had sent a J-85 engine to Orenda Company in Canada in 2006 
for repair.  Subsequently, the engine developed faults and 
the Malaysian Air Force was attempting to ship the engine 
back to Canada for warranty work.  During this period, the 
Department of State Office of Regional Security and Arms 
Transfers (PM/RSAT) advised that such a transfer, even if for 
repair, required a formal application from Malaysia and USG 
approval.  Malaysia completed this application in April and 
State PM/RSAT approved the temporary transfer to Orenda in 
July 2009(see letter dated 06 July 2009, RE: PM/RSAT 3PT Case 
09-1906). 
 
-- In May 2009 the USAF and Malaysian Air Force conducted a 
routine bilateral J85 engine review conference.  No issues of 
missing engines were raised to Post during this conference. 
 
¶9. (C) The Malaysian Air Force should have been acutely aware 
of the requirement to advise the U.S. immediately of missing 
engines, especially after the formal notification process 
undertaken in March-July period mentioned above. 
 
Suggested Talking Points 
------------------------ 
 
¶10. (C) Assuming that the Arms Export Control Act is thought 
to be violated, Post requests approval of the following 
talking points for use with GOM officials as appropriate in 
following up on reports of missing/stolen F-5 aircraft 
engines, and possibly of other U.S.-supplied materials: 
 
-- After extensive recent media reporting on missing F-5 
aircraft engines, it is important for the U.S. Embassy to 
receive a briefing from the GOM on this case. 
 
KUALA LUMP 00001013  003 OF 003 
 
 
 
-- In addition, given the engines require USG authority to 
transfer under the Arms Export Control Act, the USG requests 
a thorough written investigative report on this issue as soon 
as possible. 
 
-- The GOM's promptness and thoroughness in replying to these 
requests for information will have a bearing on the ability 
of the USG to continue supplying such military equipment to 
the GOM. 
 
-- In addition, when the investigation of this case is 
complete, it will be important for the GOM to provide to the 
USG an explanation of measures in effect to prevent future 
theft and/or diversion of U.S. military equipment supplied to 
the GOM. 
 
Suggested Press Guidance 
------------------------ 
 
¶11. (SBU) Post requests approval of the following press 
guidance for use with Malaysian and international journalists 
as appropriate, noting that the Embassy has already received 
several requests for comment: 
 
-- We have seen recent media reports that U.S.-supplied F-5 
aircraft engines were stolen. 
 
-- The USG has requested that the GOM provide a comprehensive 
report on the ongoing investigation. 
 
--We will continue our ongoing discussions with the Malaysian 
authorities.
