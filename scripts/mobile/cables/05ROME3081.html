MARCELLO PERA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ronald Spogli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  During a courtesy call with Ambassador 
Spogli, Senate President Marcello Pera (Forza Italia) said 
the center-left would win elections if held today.  He cited 
intra-coalition squabbling (especially over the leadership of 
the coalition), poor economic performance, fall-out from the 
Euro and voter apathy as the main issues.  Pera said Italy's 
foreign policy would be a ""disaster"" in the hands of the 
center left, and praised PM Berlusconi's bold leadership that 
has brought Italy respect on the world stage. He continued 
that one immediate consequence would be a quick withdrawal of 
Italian troops from Iraq. Pera called the progress on the EU 
consitution and expansion ""frozen,"" and though he reiterated 
Italian support for Turkish entry into the EU, he said most 
Europeans are not ready to welcome a Muslim state into the 
Union.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) Ambassador Spogli paid a courtesy call September 12 on 
President of the Senate Marcello Pera (Forza Italia).  Pera 
was accompanied by his Diplomatic Adviser.  Pera was 
friendly, forthcoming and eager to discuss his upcoming visit 
to the United States where he noted he would attend a 
luncheon with the President, and have meetings with the Vice 
President, the Secretary, and the National Security Adviser. 
Pera also said he would be returning to the United States in 
October to deliver a presentation at Columbia University. 
The Ambassador thanked Pera for his personal donation of Euro 
5,000 to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
POLITICS: THE CENTER RIGHT COALITION AND ELECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3. (C) Pera said internal squabbling inside the center right 
coalition would result in a victory for the center left if 
elections were held today--even if he did not think the 
Italian public is ready for a left-leaning government. He 
noted that the dispute between Chamber of Deputies President 
Pier Ferdinando Casini (UDC) and PM Berlusconi over the 
leadership of the coalition had become too personalized and 
threatened to rupture the coalition before the elections.  In 
fact, Pera predicted the UDC would abandon the governing 
coalition prior to the elections and ""go its own way."" 
According to Pera, Berlusconi had raised ""discontinuity"" 
during the spring, but the issue had ""gone away"" until Casini 
picked it up and began using it against Berlusconi.  At this 
point, Berlusconi cannot step aside as leader of the House of 
Freedom coalition without it being viewed as a personal 
defeat. 
 
¶4. (C) After four years of government, center-right voters 
have lost their ""enthusiasm.""  Pera blames the center-right, 
including himself, for underestimating the economic 
consequences of 9/11 and not adjusting voter expectations. 
According to Pera, Berlusconi took power in 2001 on a 
platform of cutting taxes, which he delivered. However, for 
the larger program to deliver the desired result, Italy 
needed to continue at economic growth rates common in the 
1990's.  Instead, Pera said there was an economic slowdown 
caused by 9/11, and the government tried to keep its broader 
promises of economic reform.  However, those promises had 
become unrealistic and the government failed to deliver, 
disillusioning many of the coalition's supporters.  He added 
that Italy's massive fiscal debt is an aggravating factor, 
making reform all the more important even if ""it would take 
ten years to complete Berlusconi's 2001 economic agenda."" 
 
¶5. (C) Pera also blamed the Euro for many of the economic 
problems faced by the Italian people.  ""Italians have 
suffered from the Euro,"" he said.  The Lira-Euro exchange 
rate initially negotiated by the previous center-left 
government was too high, and the problem has been aggravated 
by an ""overvalued Euro versus the dollar.""  That said, Pera 
noted that responsible politicians cannot criticize the Euro 
too much or the people will clamor for a return to the Lira. 
In the end, Pera summarized: ""It's the economy, stupid,"" 
noting that while Berlusconi's foreign policy has been 
excellent, foreign policy does not pay electoral dividends. 
 
¶6. (C) Pera predicted the Northern League's Umberto Bossi 
would run a campaign based on three negative themes: abandon 
the Euro, stop European integration, and combat extremist 
Islam.  Pera said Bossi would win votes with these issues. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
ON WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A CENTER-LEFT GOVERNMENT 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7. (C) Pera predicts Italy's foreign policy would be a 
""disaster"" in the hands of the center left. Pera claimed 
Berlusconi's courageous foreign policy had changed the 
world's view of Italy, turning Italy into a premier player. 
He also commended Berlusconi's Israel policy, noting with 
 
particular emphasis that Italy had traditionally been 
extremely pro-Yasser Arafat. Pera said a win by the center 
left would bring a ""Zapatero-like"" foreign policy and the 
return of Italy as an unreliable partner that takes positions 
on international issues according to what is most convenient. 
 One immediate consequence would be a quick withdrawal of 
Italian troops from Iraq.  That said, Pera offered that if 
Nicolas Sarkozy takes over from Jacque Chirac in France and 
Angela Merkel gains a clear victory in Germany, these could 
serve as moderating influences on EU foreign policy in 
general, and on Italy in particular. 
 
¶8. (C) Pera was critical of Italy's center left politicians 
trying to be politically correct and avoiding the obvious 
link between Islamic extremism and terrorism.  He said the 
struggle with Islamic extremism would last for several years. 
 On other domestic issues, Pera said a center left government 
would pursue family policies similar to Zapatero, including 
the approval of homosexual marriages, which he said the 
Italian people are not ready to sanction. 
 
----------------- 
THE EU AND TURKEY 
----------------- 
 
¶9. (C) Pera stated the European project is ""frozen,"" and that 
it would not be possible to begin a reasonable discussion on 
an EU constitution in the near future.  The Ambassador asked 
what this would mean for Turkey's admission to the EU.  Pera 
said Italy strongly supports bringing Turkey into the EU but 
noted France and Germany could not accept Turkey's accession 
into the EU for domestic political reasons in the near term. 
He continued it is also hard for Italy to support Turkish 
participation in the EU and noted that the persistence of a 
terrorist threat and Islamic extremism will determine the 
timing of Turkey's entry into the EU as much as ""having its 
cards in order."" He agreed Turkey is ostensibly ""democratic 
and moderate"" but that European people are not ready to bring 
a Muslim state into Europe.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10. (C) COMMENT: Berlusconi has been a vital and trusted 
ally, and we have benefited enormously from his foreign 
policy leadership.  That said, we believe Pera's dire 
comments regarding potential center left foreign policies 
might be exaggerated, and that we could work with an eventual 
center left government led by former EU President Romano 
Prodi if he is elected Prime Minister next spring.  Though a 
center left Italian government would not be nearly as 
supportive of U.S. foreign policy as Berlusconi has been, it 
contains a broad spectrum of parties whose views on U.S. 
poliices, especially Iraq, are more nuanced. A DS 
international affairs adviser recently assured us that any 
withdrawal of Italian troops from Iraq would be completed in 
a ""responsible manner.""  Prodi is facing primary elections 
next month and is reaching to the left in order to keep 
voters from supporting Communist party leader Fausto 
Bertinotti. We will see if he moderates his positions as the 
contest moves to a challenge of Berlusconi.   END COMMENT
