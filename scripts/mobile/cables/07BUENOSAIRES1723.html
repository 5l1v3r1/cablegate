<br>
<br>REF: BUENOS AIRES 1685

<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶1. (SBU)  On August 27, Ambassador asked Argentine Minister 
</p><p>of the Interior (MOI) Anibal Fernandez about the prospects 
</p><p>for enacting comprehensive federal Trafficking in Persons 
</p><p>(TIP) legislation in Argentina.  Fernandez stated that it is 
</p><p>""very difficult"" to make progress in the Argentine Congress 
</p><p>on this legislation at this time, and that he personally 
</p><p>beleives this is ""a pity.""  When the Ambassador asked if he 
</p><p>could help move things ahead, Fernandez replied that for now 
</p><p>the situation is frozen, but after the October 28 elections 
</p><p>things could move again. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (C)  Fernandez said that the provincial authorities are 
</p><p>resisiting making federal offenses out of matters that are 
</p><p>now handled at the local level.  This is particularly true of 
</p><p>the provinces in northeast Argentina, where trafficking is 
</p><p>particularly widespread.  He candidly acknowledged that 
</p><p>resistance in the northeast is in part because local judges 
</p><p>and politicians there are more likely to be corrupt - and 
</p><p>sometimes even connected to trafficking rings themselves - 
</p><p>and have a vested interest in keeping federal authorities off 
</p><p>their turf. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (SBU)  Fernandez believes the meetings between Argentine 
</p><p>and U.S. officials in Washington earlier this year on TIP 
</p><p>worked against the passage of federal legislation in 
</p><p>Argentina.  Prior to the Washington meetings, Fernandez was 
</p><p>optimistic that the the various interested factions in 
</p><p>Argentina had reached a tentative agreement on new 
</p><p>legislation.  Criticism of Argentina's TIP situation by one 
</p><p>USG official during and after a Washington meeting on the 
</p><p>issue, he claimed, contributed to the agreement unraveling. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4.  (SBU)  The Ambassador also raised the situation of 
</p><p>Argentine anti-TIP activist Susana Trimarco, who has recently 
</p><p>faced threats and harassment from traffickers.  Fernandez 
</p><p>replied that he was aware of the situation, and assured the 
</p><p>Ambassador that he was taking steps to ensure the safety of 
</p><p>Trimarco and her colleagues.  Fernandez said that he has 
</p><p>known Ms. Trimarco for many years and he remains in close 
</p><p>contact with her.  He observed that she was ""one tough lady"" 
</p><p>who would not be easily intimidated. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5.   (SBU)   The Ambassador referred to past discussions 
</p><p>concerning the creation of a Trafficking Prevention and 
</p><p>Assistance program in Argentina.  Ambasador noted that he was 
</p><p>pleased to see the creation of the program announced in the 
</p><p>July 27 ""Official Bulletin,"" but was surprised to see the 
</p><p>jurisdiction of the program fell under the Ministry of 
</p><p>Justice.  All past discussions concerning the program had 
</p><p>placed jurisdiction for the program under the MOI.  Fernandez 
</p><p>said he could understand why the Ambassdor was confused.  He 
</p><p>explained that placement of the program under the 
</p><p>jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice was a part of the 
</p><p>compromise agreement that had been reached earlier in the 
</p><p>year and fundamentally reflected the fact that people in 
</p><p>Congress did not fully understand the law.  He concluded, 
</p><p>""What are you going to do?"" evidencing clear frustration with 
</p><p>the legislative process on this subject.
