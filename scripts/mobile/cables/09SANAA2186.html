¶1.  (S/NF) SUMMARY.  Little is clear about the Houthi 
leadership, aside from the fact that Abdulmalik al-Houthi is 
the rebel group's current leader.  Houthi field commanders do 
not seem to agree on key ideological and religious 
principles.  The Houthis' numbers range from the hundreds to 
the thousands, though it is difficult to determine how many 
of these adhere to Houthi ideology and how many are tribesmen 
who have joined the Houthis' fight for other reasons. 
Numerous organizations have documented the Houthis' use of 
child soldiers, as well as violations of international 
humanitarian law such as looting, forced evacuations, and 
executions.  Contrary to ROYG claims that Iran is arming the 
Houthis, most analysts report that the Houthis obtain their 
weapons from the Yemeni black market and even from the ROYG 
military itself.  END SUMMARY. 
 
LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATION 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Abdulmalik al-Houthi, brother of Houthi movement 
founder Hussein al-Houthi, is the current leader of the 
Houthi rebellion in the northern Yemeni governorate of 
Sa'ada.  AP correspondent Ahmed al-Haj told PolOff on October 
27 that Abdulmalik al-Houthi is a "political-military leader 
rather than a religious one, more of a politician than an 
ideologue."  Christoph Wilcke, a researcher for Human Rights 
Watch (HRW) who visited Hajja governorate on a fact-finding 
mission, told PolOffs on October 26 that Houthi foot-soldiers 
usually do not fight in the areas where they are from, and as 
a result may not know the name of the local commander, but do 
identify their top leader as Abdulmalik al-Houthi.  Beyond 
that, according to Wilcke, "it's not clear where the 
leadership sits or how it's structured."  According to the 
International Crisis Group (ICG), there is no evidence that 
the rebels possess a centralized command-and-control 
structure, coherent ideology, or political program. 
 
¶3.  (C) While AP's Haj believes the Houthis are a 
well-organized group, to some observers the Houthis are a 
rag-tag, decentralized guerrilla army.  The number of 
fighters is estimated to be between several hundred and 
several thousand, though it is difficult to know how many 
adhere to Houthi ideology and how many are tribal fighters 
who joined the cause out of anti-government sentiments. 
There are substantial differences in ideology, strategy, and 
tactics among field commanders in different parts of Sa'ada. 
World Food Program (WFP) Representative Gian Carlo Cirri, who 
speaks with Houthis to negotiate passage of food aid, told 
PolOff on November 4 that "there is no such thing as a united 
Houthi command.  The field commanders have a great deal of 
authority.  They don't agree on key ideological and religious 
principles." 
 
¶4.  (C) One example of differences among Houthi field 
commanders is their attitudes toward international relief 
agencies.  Cirri noted that Houthi field commanders "do not 
perceive UN and WFP assistance in the same way."  For 
instance, the field commander in Saqayn, west of Sa'ada City, 
allowed relief agencies to access the area in order to 
distribute aid to IDPs, while the commander in the Dhahian 
area between Sa'ada City and Baqim is adamantly "opposed to 
internationals."  (Note:  As of early November, WFP had lost 
all contact with the Houthis because their main contact )- 
Abu Ali, the Saqayn field commander -- had died.  Ali was 
reportedly very close to Abdulmalik al-Houthi and was number 
three in the Houthi organization.  End Note.)  The main 
Houthi leadership, however, does seem inclined to accept a UN 
or foreign role in mediation.  According to UNHCR 
Representative Claire Bourgeois, after the October visit of 
UN Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes, the Houthis said 
they would agree to a humanitarian corridor if it were 
enforced by the UN.  Houthi mediator Hassan Zaid told PolOff 
on December 2 that the Houthis would welcome the 
participation of foreign governments or multilateral 
organizations in negotiating a settlement to the conflict 
(ref a). 
 
SYMPATHIZERS AND SUPPORTERS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) AP's Haj said that many Sa'ada residents support the 
Houthis because of ROYG injustices, abuses by local sheikhs, 
and the brutality of the war.  During two visits to Sa'ada in 
the fall of 2009, however, NewsYemen's Soufi found little 
support for either the Houthis or the ROYG, as the residents 
blame both parties for the suffering caused by the war.  He 
said that some residents take a pragmatic approach, hedging 
their bets by supporting the ROYG during the day and the 
Houthis at night.  He was struck by how isolated the people 
in Sa'ada are.  They refer to Sana'a as "Yemen," saying "I 
have never been to Yemen" when referring to the capital, 
according to Soufi. 
 
¶6.  (S/NF) Colonel Akram al-Qassmi of the National Security 
Bureau (NSB) estimates that there are thousands of men 
fighting for the Houthis, but not all of them share the 
Houthi ideology.  They "jumped on the wave" to fight for 
their tribe, or against the government, or against a powerful 
sheikh.  According to WFP's Cirri, the tribes who support the 
Houthis have "no real loyalty" to them; they switch sides 
based on "direct, immediate private interests."  He believes 
the conflict is extremely localized: families and tribes 
decide to support the Houthis based on specific grievances 
)- including the lack of payment of blood money -- that they 
have against the government or more powerful tribal leaders. 
NewsYemen's Soufi thinks that many of the rank-and-file are 
thugs who are taking advantage of the conflict to gain power 
and resources. 
 
HOUTHI GOVERNANCE 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Many analysts report that the Houthis establish their 
own system of governance in the areas they control. 
According to Mohammed Azzan, presidential advisor for Sa'ada 
affairs, the Houthis are trying to create a "state within a 
state."  Mohammed al-Qadhi, correspondent for Dubai-based The 
National, reported that in Haydan district, the Houthis have 
established courts and prisons.  Soufi reported that the 
Houthis in Harf Sufyan have established Islamic courts, 
impose their own laws on local residents, demand protection 
money, and dispense rough justice by ordering executions. 
AP's Haj argues that the Houthis are winning hearts and minds 
by providing security in areas long neglected by the ROYG. 
According to Haj, the Houthis limit the arbitrary and abusive 
power of influential sheikhs.  According to Abdulmajid 
al-Fahd, Executive Director of the Civic Democratic 
Foundation, Houthis help resolve conflicts between tribes and 
reduce the number of revenge killings in areas they control. 
(Comment: While claims that Houthis are establishing a 
parallel state seem far-fetched, it is likely that the 
Houthis are attempting to arbitrate local disputes.  End 
Comment.) 
 
HOUTHI ABUSES: CHILD SOLDIERS AND ALLEGATIONS OF "SHIELDING" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶8.  (C) Numerous organizations, including Save the Children, 
UNICEF, and Islamic Relief, have documented the Houthis' use 
of child soldiers.  HRW's Wilcke reported that Houthis use 
boys as young as 13 as guards; older teenagers are used as 
fighters.  According to UNHCR interviews with IDPs, "Their 
reasons for leaving their places of origin include ... forced 
enrollment of children as young as 14 in guerrilla forces," 
as well as forced taxes, destruction of properties, and heavy 
weapon shelling by both sides.  Judith Evans, a Times of 
London reporter who visited the Mazraq IDP camp (Hajja 
governorate), told PolOff on October 12 that she heard many 
accounts of atrocities against civilians by the Houthis.  She 
said, "The refugees we spoke to were terrified of the 
government bombing raids, but it seems the Houthis take 
things a step further and deliberately target civilians, 
including children, for instance, shooting them in their 
houses as an act of revenge for siding with the government." 
Saba, the government news agency, reported on December 6 that 
the Houthis killed an 11-year-old boy in retaliation for his 
father's refusal to join them. 
 
¶9.  (C) While the ROYG repeatedly accuses the Houthis of 
using civilians as human shields, Wilcke noted that 
"shielding" has a very specific definition in international 
human rights law, requiring intent to expose civilians to 
danger in order to fend off a military advance.  HRW does not 
have enough evidence to conclude that the Houthis are 
intentionally using civilians as human shields, he said, 
 
 
though Wilcke admitted there may be cases they have not been 
able to document.  However, HRW has documented a number of 
other Houthi violations of international humanitarian law, 
such as looting and forced evacuation (in which civilians are 
told to fight with the Houthis or flee).  He said HRW also 
documented assassinations, which, depending on the 
circumstances, could be regular crimes or rise to the level 
of war crimes. 
 
¶10.  (C) With respect to humanitarian aid, WFP's Cirri said 
that the Houthis have never stopped any WFP food convoys; 
they once stopped an ADRA convoy in Al Jawf but allowed it to 
pass.  Rather, it is often tribes demanding aid or government 
concessions who hold aid convoys hostage.  In addition, one 
joint WFP-UNHCR convoy was stopped for three weeks by the 
government. 
 
TACTICS AND STRATEGY 
--------------------- 
 
¶11.  (S) According to journalist Qadhi, the Houthis have 
gained experience from each round of fighting, as shown by 
their use of more sophisticated tactics.  HRW's Wilcke said 
that the Houthis now dig trenches around towns so that the 
artillery shells, which explode upwards, do not hit them. 
The British DATT believes that the Houthis' advances in 
tactics and strategy indicate that they have received outside 
training, though he did not say by whom.  Early in the sixth 
war, he said, the Houthis focused on collecting and capturing 
weapons and resources.  He told PolOff on November 21 that 
unlike previous rounds of fighting, in the sixth war there 
have been some set piece battles, including an attempted 
takeover of the Republican Palace in Sa'ada City involving 
hundreds of Houthi fighters.  Such large battles are unusual, 
however.  Murad Zafir, Deputy Director of the National 
Democratic Institute, said that Houthi fighters generally 
attack in groups of three to five people, including one 
sniper.  That way they minimize their own losses while 
driving up the costs of the army, which is using big bombs on 
small groups of fighters.  Col. Mansour al-Azi, a senior 
military intelligence officer, told PolOff on November 24 
that the Houthis fight with religious fervor, yelling "God is 
Great" when running into battle, unafraid of dying because 
they believe that if they do, they will go directly to 
paradise. 
 
WEAPONS SUPPLY 
-------------- 
 
¶12.  (S/NF) Contrary to ROYG claims that Iran is arming the 
Houthis, most local political analysts report that the 
Houthis obtain their weapons from the Yemeni black market and 
even from the ROYG military itself.  According to a British 
diplomat, there are numerous credible reports that ROYG 
military commanders were selling weapons to the Houthis in 
the run-up to the Sixth War.  An ICG report on the Sa'ada 
conflict from May 2009 quoted NSB director Ali Mohammed 
al-Ansi saying, "Iranians are not arming the Houthis.  The 
weapons they use are Yemeni.  Most actually come from 
fighters who fought against the socialists during the 1994 
war and then sold them."  Mohammed Azzan, presidential 
advisor for Sa'ada affairs, told PolOff on August 16 that the 
Houthis easily obtain weapons inside Yemen, either from 
battlefield captures or by buying them from corrupt military 
commanders and soldiers.  Azzan said that the military 
"covers up its failure" by saying the weapons come from Iran. 
 According to Jamal Abdullah al-Shami of the Democracy 
School, there is little external oversight of the military's 
large and increasing budget, so it is easy for members of the 
military to illegally sell weapons. 
 
¶13.  (S/NF) ROYG officials assert that the Houthis' 
possession and use of Katyusha rockets is evidence of support 
from Iran and Hizballah, arguing that these rockets are not 
available in Yemeni arms markets nor ROYG stockpiles. 
(Comment: Given Yemen's robust arms markets, especially in 
Sa'ada, it is possible that Katyushas are available on the 
black market even if they are not in ROYG stockpiles. 
According to sensitive reporting, there is at least one 
instance of Somali extremists purchasing Katyusha rockets in 
Yemen in 2007.  End Comment.)  However, according to 
sensitive reporting, it may have been the ROYG military who 
aided the Houthis in obtaining a shipment of 200 Katyusha 
rockets in late November 2009.
