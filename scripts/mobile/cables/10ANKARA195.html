¶1. (U) Ambassador Jeffrey met with Energy Minister Yildiz on 
February 3 to discuss the DOE energy efficiency conference, 
expected nuclear power plant projects, Iran, and negotiations 
with the Azeris on Shah Deniz gas.  Yildiz, for reasons 
unknown but appreciated, hauled ambassador out before the 
media, which was awaiting the Iranian foreign minister's 
visit to Yildiz, essentially to allow us to deploy our 
warnings about Turkish-Iranian energy cooperation. 
 
GOT WILL SUPPORT DOE ENERGY EFFICIENCY CONFERENCE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (U) DOE is working with the American Turkish Council (ATC) 
to hold a regional (SE Europe and Caucasus) energy efficiency 
conference in Istanbul June 3-4.  Ambassador Jeffrey passed 
Yildiz a letter from DOE Deputy Secretary Poneman inviting 
Yildiz to be a key note speaker at the conference.  He told 
him that DOE and ATC expect to be able to finance the 
conference with private support, but would like the 
ministry's official support.  Yildiz enthusiastically agreed. 
 
 
GOT INTERESTED IN TDA ORIENTATION VISIT ON NUCLEAR ENERGY 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶3. (U) When the ambassador raised the possibility of a USTDA 
orientation visit on peaceful nuclear power generation, 
Yildiz said he would be interested in sending a team to the 
U.S.  He said they have already formed a team to work on 
regulatory and other aspects of nuclear power and they are in 
touch with officials at the relevant U.S. agencies. 
 
AKKUYU NUCLEAR PLANT TO RUSSIA BY IGA 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Yildiz confirmed that the nuclear power plant to be 
built in Akkuyu will be awarded to Russia through an 
intergovernmental agreement.  He said they still plan to 
build a second plant in Sinop, which they will open for bids. 
Ambassador Jeffrey indicated that U.S. companies may be 
interested in bidding on the project, noting that President 
Obama has indicated openness to a new generation of safe, 
clean nuclear power plants. 
 
CONTINUED PURSUIT OF IRANIAN ENERGY DEALS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Ambassador emphasized that now is not the time for 
Turkey to be doing hydrocarbon business with Iran.  He 
recognized that Iran is Turkey's neighbor and trading 
partner, but stressed that now is not the time for business 
as usual.  He added that we do not believe Iranian 
involvement in Nabucco is a good idea at this time.  In 
response, Yildiz only asked rhetorically, "Do you have any 
alternatives for us?" 
 
STILL SLOW PROGRESS ON SHAH DENIZ NEGOTIATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (C) Regarding negotiations with the Azeris on natural gas, 
Yildiz said they have reached agreement on price for Shah 
Deniz I gas.  They have not agreed on Shah Deniz II volumes 
or price, but the negotiations continue. He said they made a 
reasonable proposal on volumes, which the Azeris are now 
considering.  He said the Azeris rejected Turkey's latest 
offer on transit fees, but he thinks they will eventually 
accept it.  Yildiz assured us the Turkish side is being 
reasonable and doing all it can to move the negotiations 
forward. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (C) Yildiz was especially upbeat throughout the meeting. 
Notably, he refrained from expressing frustrations with the 
Azeris or the lack of progress on negotiations.  Regarding 
the nuclear plants, given the frequent changes of plan thus 
far, we do not take Yildiz's comment as final confirmation 
the Sinop project will be awarded through an open tender, 
though it does appear more and more certain the Akkuyu 
project will go to the Russians.  Whether coincidentally or 
intentionally, Yildiz's schedule offered a final comment on 
 
ANKARA 00000195  002 OF 002 
 
 
the sincerity of Turkey's pursuit of Iranian energy: 
immediately following our meeting, Yildiz received Iranian 
Foreign Minister Mottaki.  Yildiz's giving an impromptu press 
conference with the ambassador just before that meeting, 
allowing us to repeat in public our concerns about energy 
cooperation with Iran, was frosting on the cake.
