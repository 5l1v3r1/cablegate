</p><p>¶1. (C) The UK supports in principle U.S. views that NATO Allies and Partners should provide additional resources to the Nato Training Mission in Iraq (NTM-I) and HMG will make a significant contribution. However, according to MOD Deputy Director for Joint Commitments Daniel Hughes, internal decision making delays within the MOD have not progressed as quickly as he thought when he last spoke to poloff (ref a). The UK will therefore not be in a position to commit formally to additional contributions at the September 25 NTM-I Manpower Coordination Conference in Brussels.
</p><p>¶2. (C) Hughes summarized the instructions MOD was transmitting to the UK delegation to the Coordination Conference: - We remain fully committed to NATO and NTM-I, and hope to increase our support to the mission in 2009 and beyond. We strongly support U.S. calls for nations to do more to support NTM-I with additional resources and manpower. - We are currently conducting an assessment into those areas where we could increase our support to the Iraqis through NTM-I, and would hope to be able to confirm our intent in the coming weeks. - We will be looking to Partners to support these efforts, particularly those who may be recalibrating their contributions to NTM-I in the light of the GoI,s desire for a reduced coalition presence after 2008 (those NATO Partners who will no longer be part of MNF-I). - We understand the recent NATO request to extend key NTM-I posts (flag posts and OF-5s) from 6 month to 9 or 12-month tours, and while we fully agree with this in principle, will need further internal decisions before final UK agreement can be given. - We would like to request an update on NATO,s engagement with GoI to ensure appropriate legal status for NTM-I after the Chapter VII mandate expires in December 2008, including where responsibility lies for leading NATO negotiations, and how the US are supporting these efforts.
</p><p>¶3. (C) Hughes added that before the UK begins formal engagement, some careful preparation will be required to shape the environment. HMG will need to explain to Partners that it does not seek to take Lead or Principal Coordinating Nation (PCN) status for the whole of NTM-I, but just for the Officer Training strands, to be delivered under the NTM-I umbrella. As a larger project, Officer Training would sit alongside others within NTM-I, including the well regarded Italian Carabinieri efforts. HMG anticipates that the Italians will remain the major personnel contributor to NTM-I. The UK will present its proposals as supplementary capacity building efforts to build upon the valuable achievements of NTM-I in this area thus far. Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
