¶1. (SBU) On November 25 Ambassador raised REF A 
points with MFA State Secretary Pertti Torstila. 
Torstila said the government would not make any 
statements regarding possible expanded 
participation in Afghanistan until after the 
President formally announces the policy. 
 
¶2. (C) The same day Pol/Econ Chief also delivered 
demarche points to Anu Laamanen, the MFA's Deputy 
Director General of the Political Unit.  Laamanen 
welcomed the imminent formal announcement of the 
Afghanistan-Pakistan policy, noting how closely and 
cooperatively the U.S. and Finland have worked 
together in the northern region.  She indicated 
that she was not in a position to speak about 
possible additional contributions, pointing out 
that the government already had an outstanding 
request for additional troops from the NATO 
Secretary General that they had yet to discuss. 
She added that the Finns need to consult with the 
Swedes and the Germans about the situation in the 
north before they arrive at a decision.  Signaling 
the difficulty Finland faces, Laamanen said that 
increasing contributions to Trust Funds are far 
more achievable than getting additional people on 
the ground.  (NOTE: Previously, the MFA's Security 
Policy Unit head cast doubt on media reports 
raising the possibility of a doubling of troops to 
200 in 2011, but said that Finland might increase 
police trainers from 24 to 30 (REF B). This might 
point to a lack of interagency coordination, as the 
MoD is undertaking a review of its PRT 
contributions (see below).  END NOTE) 
 
¶3. (C) During a November 30 conversation with 
Deputy Defense Minister Rimpi and MoD Policy 
Director Jarvenpaa, DCM reviewed our need for 
greater Finnish participation in Afghnistan.  The 
Mod officials noted that President Halonen had 
received a request for troops from NATO SecGen 
Rasmussen the week before.  Rimpi and Jarvenpaa 
were open to the troop requests, while describing 
practical difficulties the GoF had in filling both 
their PRT and OMLT positions.  According to 
Jarvenpaa, the GoF was currently trying to fill 25 
empty PRT billets, and were also having trouble 
identifying reserve or recently-retired field-grade 
officers to advise Afghan units in OMLTs. 
Jarvenpaa added that the MoD was undertaking a 
policy-level review of the role of the 
Swedish/Finnish PRT, and predicted that Finland 
would adjust its presence to conform with a more 
civilian orientation.  They warned, however, that 
the issue would have to work its way through the 
parliament's 2010 budget process, leaving any 
effective changes until 2011.
