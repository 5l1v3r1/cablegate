¶1. (SBU) A January 14 discussion between Ambassador Wayne and 
Canadian Ambassador Tim Martin covered Argentina's poor 
preparation for regional summits and the G-20, as well as 
Canada's nuclear energy and mining agenda with Argentina. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Brazil's regional agenda and the Summit of the 
Americas:  Martin said that he had gone to the Argentine 
MFA's assistant secretary for Latin America, Agustin Colombo, 
to express concern that Canada was not included in the summit 
Brazil was hosting for all countries in the hemisphere except 
the U.S. and Canada.  Colombo told him that Argentina did not 
really have an idea of what the summit was intended to do 
except highlight Brazil's leadership ambitions.  After the 
summit, Colombo told Martin that during the summit in Brazil, 
the GoA had sent him to a last-minute meeting where Lula and 
Calderon basically told those assembled what they planned to 
announce a follow-on summit in Mexico.  Martin said that he 
had tried to engage the Argentines on the April Summit of the 
Americas but found them not very interested.  Ambassador 
Wayne said that he had found the same thing when we had tried 
to engage them.  Both ambassadors agreed to work together to 
try to move the Argentines in a positive direction as the 
summit approaches and as they both receive guidance from 
capitols. 
 
¶3. (C) G-20:  Martin said that his deputy minister who had 
been at the Washington G-20 meeting characterized Argentina's 
participation as a blown opportunity.  Ambassador Wayne said 
that U.S. officials had told him that President Fernandez de 
Kirchner had spoken twice as long as other leaders and that 
her message had been very distinct from the other leaders, 
with a rhetorical and Argentine-centric bent.  Martin said 
that unfortunately Fernandez de Kirchner has a tendency to 
give speeches that sound off on her views about the inequity 
of the world.  In the case of the G-20, this did not reflect 
the practical, serious work of Central Bank Governor Redrado 
or her Finance Secretary.  Her ""sherpa"", Ambassador Timerman, 
had also not been up to the substantive task.  Ambassador 
agreed that Redrado especially had tried to take the 
opportunity for Argentina to contribute to this important 
process.  Both ambassadors agreed to work together, perhaps 
along with other BA-based G-20 ambassadors, to encourage 
Argentina to play a more constructive role in the April G-20 
meeting and in the working groups. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Nuclear Cooperation:  Canada is working hard to 
increase peaceful nuclear cooperation with Argentina.  The 
Canadians are going to carry out a major rehab of the Embalse 
nuclear energy plant in Cordoba which should total about 
US$800 million.  They are helping Argentina finish its Atucha 
II nuclear energy plant which has been under construction for 
years.  And, they are competing to build a new nuclear plant 
about which they hope the Argentines will reach a decision in 
the next year. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mining Going OK:  Martin said major Canadian mining 
companies are standing with their commitments to invest in 
Argentina despite the flare-up a year ago when the GoA 
surprised them with new export taxes.  Since the tax 
announcement, the GoA, led by the Secretary of Mining, has 
worked quietly with Canadian companies to find ways to work 
around the new federal regulations.  One of Canada's largest 
investments, Barick Gold's Pascua-Lama project in San Juan 
province, is still on hold however, because it straddles the 
Chile-Argentine border: the Canadian company does not want to 
proceed unless the two governments have agreed in writing on 
taxes. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Canadian embassy and mining companies also 
continue to work with provincial governments on environmental 
issues.  In a number of cases, provincial legislatures have 
banned the use of chemicals in mining (e.g. the use of 
arsenic in leaching gold from lower grade ore), which Martin 
said are widely and safely used elsewhere.  Finally, a number 
of smaller Canadian firms are packing up, basically because 
they can't get financing in these difficult times to continue 
their exploratory work.
