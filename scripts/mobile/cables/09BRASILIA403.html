<br> 
<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>¶1. (C) In a meeting with Ambassador Sobel March 28, British Ambassador to Brazil Alan Charlton provided a readout of the March 26 meeting between Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Charlton said that the economic crisis was the principal topic of conversation, with Brown pushing for Brazil to participate in the efforts to increase financing, specifically through the IMF New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). Lula was non-committal. Lula told Brown that whatever new organization (e.g., G-20, G-8 plus 5) emerges from current discussions, Brazil will participate. 
</p><p>¶2. (C) Brown and Lula also discussed working together to help the global community understand that the Doha trade round can be part of the solution to the current crisis. Lula asked about Europe's support for restarting Doha. Brown said that France and Germany could be convinced, but only if the United States shows interest in restarting talks within the next six months. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) According to Charlton, other topics raised were: --Climate Change: Brown also pushed for a "more realistic" approach by Brazil to climate change, i.e., one that involves taking on commitments. According to Charlton, when Foreign Minister Celso Amorim tried to intervene regarding differentiated responsibilities, Lula cut him off. -- WTO Appellate Body: Lula brought up with Brown Brazil's candidate for the WTO court, Supreme Court Justice Ellen Gracie Northfleet, saying he intended to raise her nomination with President Obama as well. -- Nuclear Non-Proliferation: Brown raised concerns regarding the doctoral thesis of a Brazilian Army nuclear physicist, Dalton Barroso, that reportedly addresses how to develop a nuclear weapons program. (Note: The Brazilian MOD has refused to allow Barroso to be interviewed by the IAEA about his ideas. End note.) -- UNSC: Lula aggressively pushed Brazil's interest in a permanent UN Security Council seat. Brown confirmed that both France and Britain support Brazil. -- Food Security: Brown and Lula discussed food security in Africa. According to Charlton, Lula was very engaged, and there was agreement to seek ways to work together via the British Development Ministry and Brazil's Cooperation Agency (ABC).
