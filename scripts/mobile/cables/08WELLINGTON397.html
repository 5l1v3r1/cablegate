¶1.  (C)  On November 25, Pol/Econ Counselor met with Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade International Security and 
Disarmament Division Chief Joan Mosley and Deputy Director 
Jillian Dempster to discuss the recent IAEA reports on Iran 
and Syria, ongoing TACC discussions and next steps in Vienna. 
 Mosley assured the USG that the GNZ finds both reports 
disturbing, and said that New Zealand agrees with and shares 
USG concerns.  New Zealand plans to deliver strong statements 
on both countries at the upcoming Board of Governors meeting. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Regarding Syria and the Technical Assistance and 
Cooperation Committee (TACC), New Zealand does not contribute 
to the TACC and therefore does not anticipate playing a high 
profile role in those discussions.  New Zealand desires a 
"satisfactory" outome on Syria (i.e., an outcome that is 
acceptable to the majority of Board members).  Mosley 
indicated that feedback from Vienna through MFAT channels 
indicates that the TACC discussions are largely at an impasse 
and little consensus is foreseen.  MFAT believes that the 
issue will go to the Board of Governors.  Mosley noted that 
New Zealand, having just elected a new government, does not 
yet have clear policy guidance from new Foreign Minister 
Murray McCully, Minister for Disarmament Georgina Te Heuheu 
and other relevant ministries.  She acknowledged that New 
Zealand will be constrained in its actions until the new 
government has read in and had a chance to discuss the policy 
papers forwarded to the new ministers.  Mosley said that the 
New Zealand mission in Vienna and MFAT had developed language 
for use in the upcoming statements at the BOG without 
appropriate clearance from the new government given that 
there is still a transition taking place.
