</p><p>ENGAGEMENT PARTY FOR SALIM,S SON ATTRACTS GOU ELITE --------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p>¶3. (S) The engagement party for Salim,s son, Sardor, was held in July 2005 at Salim,s mansion in Gazelkent near Tashkent. Following tradition, only women attended the engagement party. The close-knit group of around twenty guests included the wives of Interior Minister Matlybov, Justice Minister Mustafayev, Finance Minister Azimov, and Foreign Minister Ganiev, as well as Deputy Prime Minister Kasimov's sister. Salim,s daughters also attended, along with the wives of leading businessmen Muhiddin Jamol, "UzbekSavdo" chairman Zafar Faiyziev, and "UzbekComuneHizmet" General Director Halmukhamedov. 
</p><p>¶4. (S) According to our contact, Salim did not attend the party, but provided each guest with a necklace worth $1,000. Jamol, a close friend of Salim's whose Alp Jamol conglomerate includes banks, supermarkets and shopping centers (ref C), was tasked with keeping the guests happy. The video shows Jamol handing out $100 bills to the guests as they dance. (Note: It is common in Uzbek culture for money to be given to women as they dance, and also to musicians. End note.) Video footage of the party also shows Salim,s fleet of black Mercedes-Benz cars.
</p><p>¶5. (S) Our contact told Poloff that Salim's Gazelkent home was decorated by a Versace representative flown in for the job. Photos of Salim,s house reportedly appeared last year in the Russian magazine "Vysshee Obshchestvo" ("High Society"). (Note: Photos of Sardor's eventual wedding were published on a Russian website, www.elite.ru. End note.) According to our contact, Salim has now built another "palace," which will be his preferred dacha, while the Gazelkent estate will reportedly be used by his wife, lovers, and daughters.
</p><p>SALIM,S WIFE SHAHLO,S BIRTHDAY

</p><p>¶6. (S) The birthday party for Salim,s wife, Shahlo, took place at a Tashkent restaurant in summer 2005. In addition to Salim,s daughter and son, guests at the birthday included former Foreign Minister Mahmudova and the wives of Foreign Minister Ganiev and Deputy Prime Minister Sultanov. The wives of "UzbekComuneHizmet" General Director Halmukhamedov and foreign-based oligarch Fatokh Shodiyev also attended, along with famous singer Yulduz Usmanova. According to the contact, most guests gave Shahlo $3,000 in cash, while Shodiyev's wife gave $10,000. (Note: Shodiyev reportedly left Uzbekistan in 1994 after making a fortune in the cotton business, and is now living in Kazakhstan and Belgium. He holds a senior position in the Eurasian Industrial Association and is rumored to be an adviser to President Nazarbayev. End note.) PURNELL</p>
