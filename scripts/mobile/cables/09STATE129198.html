<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>¶1.  (S/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS READ WITH KEEN INTEREST RECENT PRESS REPORTS ABOUT A PROPOSED BIOMETRIC NATIONAL ID PROJECT IN INDIA AND REQUEST POST ASSISTANCE IN FILLING INFORMATION GAPS ABOUT THE PROJECT.  THE PROJECT HAS BEEN BILLED AT RECENT TRADE CONFERENCES AS THE LARGEST BIOMETRIC ENROLLMENT EVER PROPOSED AND IS THE BIGGEST BIOMETRIC INITIATIVE ANTICIPATED IN 2010.  DESPITE PROMISED IMPROVEMENTS THE CARDS WOULD PROVIDE, ANALYSTS ARE CONCERNED THE PROGRAM COULD PRESENT A VULNERABLE TARGET FOR REGIONAL EXTREMIST GROUPS -- SUCH AS LASHKAR E-TAYYIBA -- WHO COULD OBTAIN FRAUDULENT INDIAN ID CARDS DURING THE LARGE-SCALE ENROLLMENT FOR USE IN TRAVEL OR AS BREEDER DOCUMENTS TO APPLY FOR PASSPORTS. 
</p><p>¶2.  (S/NF)  ANALYSTS SUBMIT FOR EMBASSY CONSIDERATION THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS THAT BUILD ON THE EXCELLENT ANSWERS PROVIDED EARLIER THIS YEAR IN REFTEL RESPONSE TO JOINT NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER AND S/CT REQUIREMENTS ON IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND WATCHLIST SYSTEMS.  NOTING THAT MUCH OF THE TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM MAY NOT BE DECIDED FOR SOME TIME, WE REMAIN MOST INTERESTED IN THE REASONS MOTIVATING THE PROPOSED PROGRAM, PLANNED SECURITY FEATURES OF THE CARDS AND ENROLLMENT PROCESS, AND ANY ANTI-FRAUD EFFORTS.  RESULTS OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO A STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT FOR SENIOR US POLICYMAKERS ON THE REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS IN SOUTH ASIA OF THE BIOMETRIC ID PROGRAM.  AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT, WE WOULD PARTICULARLY WELCOME POST,S INSIGHT INTO THE FOLLOWING TOPICS AND QUESTIONS:

</p><p>D)  (SBU)  HOW DO AUTHORITIES PLAN TO UTILIZE THE BIOMETRIC ID CARD AT INDIA'S BORDERS, PORTS, AND AIRPORTS? 
</p><p>E)  (SBU)  WHICH FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND/OR CORPORATIONS ARE ASSISTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ID CARD?  WHICH BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS (I.E. FINGERPRINTS, FACIAL RECOGNITION, IRIS SCAN, ETC.) WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE CARD? 
</p><p>F)  (SBU)  WHAT PROMPTED DEVELOPMENT OF THE ID CARD? 
</p><p>G)  (SBU)  WHICH COMPANY IS PROVIDING THE BIOMETRIC COLLECTION DEVICES, STORAGE, AND MATCHING DATABASE EQUIPMENT?  PLEASE PROVIDE THE NAME, MODEL, AND VERSION OF THE BIOMETRIC COLLECTION DEVICES USED FOR THE ID CARD, IF AVAILABLE.
