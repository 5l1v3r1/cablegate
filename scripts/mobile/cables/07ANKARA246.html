¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The February 1 visit of SARG FM Muallem to 
Ankara was the latest in a series of high level visits in 
both directions in recent months.  Muallem's day of 
high-level meetings did not break any apparent new ground but 
focused primarily on ways the GOT and SARG could cooperate 
with other regional partners to help stabilize Iraq, as well 
as to support Iraq's independence and territorial integrity. 
Muallem also reportedly conveyed SARG fears of growing 
instability and sectarianism throughout the Middle East and 
its efforts to address those issues in Lebanon and with 
Palestinian factions. END SUMMARY 
 
SYRIAN FM MUALLEM'S VISIT 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) According to MFA Department Head for the Middle East 
Sedat Onal, Muallem's visit was planned on very short notice 
and at the initiative of the SARG.  Muallem met with his 
counterpart, FM Abdullah Gul, as well as with President Sezer 
and PM Erdogan.  The meetings with Sezer and Erdogan had 
ostensibly been scheduled to allow Muallem to convey messages 
from President Asad to them directly concerning regional 
issues, including Iraq and the growing level of sectarian 
polarization throughout the Middle East. 
 
¶3. (C) Onal said Muallem shared with GOT officials the 
results of recent visits to Damascus by Iraqi President Jalal 
Talabani and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and passed 
on Bashar Asad's hope for continued sharing and coordination 
of ideas on a regional basis in an effort to diminish growing 
sectarianism.  Apparently without irony, Muallem reportedly 
pointed to Iraq and Lebanon as examples of the havoc that 
could engulf the entire region should Middle Eastern leaders 
not begin to discuss ways to avoid such a conflagration. 
Muallem also conveyed Asad's views and priorities on Iraq, 
namely: safeguarding Iraq's territorial integrity and the 
welfare of its people; and guaranteeing Iraqi independence. 
 
SARG THINKING RE IRAQ 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Muallem said Iraq's independence could best be 
supported by bringing to the fore the Arab-Islamic nature of 
Iraq as a way to help contain worsening sectarian violence, 
establishing an Iraqi army on a national basis rather than 
along sectarian lines, amending the Iraqi constitution to 
alleviate concerns about possible disintegration, ensuring 
the government takes on a clearly national vice religious 
character, reviewing de-Baathification laws to help stem the 
insurgency supported by former government officials, 
disarming and disbanding militias, and establishing a 
calendar for the departure of international troops.  Onal 
said the SARG's position on the final point was to 
synchronize the withdrawal of foreign troops with the 
completion of adequate training of Iraqi troops so as not to 
create or contribute to instability. 
 
THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY INITIATIVE 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Onal underscored that Turkey continues to press 
forward with the "neighboring countries initiative" which 
brings Iraq's regional neighbors together with the GOI with 
the goal of ensuring all of them are working to keep Iraq 
united, eschewing "divisive policies," and supporting the 
strengthening of Iraq's security forces.  He indicated the 
GOT hopes this initiative can, at some point, be linked to 
the P-5 to provide a broader level of international support 
 
ANKARA 00000246  002 OF 002 
 
 
for these goals and noted that Muallem and the SARG support 
that linkage. 
 
LEBANON/PALESTINIANS 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Muallem also discussed factional fighting among the 
Palestinians and the situation in Lebanon.  He described SARG 
efforts (together with Qatar) to help Fatah and Hamas reach 
an understanding on a Palestinian government of national 
unity, which had been unsuccessful to date.  Onal reported 
that Muallem also noted the SARG had been trying to 
"influence" the Lebanese opposition to stop its 
destabilization of PM Siniora's government but that, 
according to Muallem, they (the opposition) "seem to be 
determned to push for early elections."  Onal said Muallem 
conveyed the SARG's belief that the tribunal designed to 
investigate political assassinations in Lebanon was the 
crucial outstanding issue that, if solved, would probably 
allow for all other outstanding issues to be resolved.  Onal 
noted the SARG signaled its support for Arab League Secretary 
General Amr Moussa's idea to form a commission to look at 
jurisdictional issues related to the tribunal, relaying SARG 
concerns that the body "deal with legal and technical issues 
instead of political ones."  Onal also passed on PM Erdogan's 
concern as expressed to Muallem that Lebanese leaders were 
taking an "emotional vice rational approach" and were in 
danger of setting into motion events that they would then be 
unable to control. 
 
WE LIKE YOU BETTER THAN IRAN 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) Finally, Onal described Muallem's effort to convey at 
each of his meetings the importance the SARG attaches to its 
relationship with Turkey as well as how the SARG's interests 
diverge from those of Iran.  Pointing to the different 
sectarian make-up of majority Sunni Syria and majority Shia 
Iran, as well as to the Islamist nature of the Iranian regime 
compared to the sectarianism of the SARG, Muallem said it 
should be clear "there is not 100 percent convergence between 
Syria and Iran."  In fact, Muallem emphasized the SARG's view 
that Turkish-Syrian relations were far better now than 
Syrian-Iranian ties, and that the SARG's relationship with 
Iran in recent years had been a "natural consequence of the 
West's policy of isolation of Syria."  Muallem said the SARG 
now looked more to Turkey to help solve regional issues that 
destabilize all countries in the Middle East. 
 
¶8. (C) COMMENT: Muallem's visit was the latest in a series of 
visits by senior officials from both countries in recent 
months.  We are hard-pressed to find anything ground-breaking 
in what Muallem discussed while in Ankara, but the fact that 
the visit occurred - as well as the high-level reception 
Muallem was given - seem to fit into the longer-term effort 
by both countries to engage one another more regularly. 
While Syria looks to end its isolation in any way that it can 
and sees Turkey as the most convenient means to do so, the 
GOT's primary motivation is its overriding fear of what 
continued instability in the region might mean for Turkey. 
Turkey is prepared to work with all its neighbors to prevent 
sectarianism and extremism from consuming the entire region, 
sees merit in trying to end the Damascus-Tehran axis, and 
believes it preferable to work with the devil it knows (Asad) 
rather than with one it does not.
