<br></pre></p></div><p>1.(C) Key points: -- In response to reftel points delivered by the Ambassador on June 21, Arab League (AL) Secretary General Moussa said he expects Arab ministers at the June 24 AL meeting to support President Obama and keep the door "open" for Israel-Palestinian negotiations; he agreed to urge the ministers to maintain a positive approach toward Middle East peace prospects. -- However, Moussa was pessimistic on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's June 14 speech, and argued that it was fundamentally negative, especially on the issue of settlements. Moussa was adamant that there would be no Arab gestures or steps related to the Arab Peace Initiative until Israel halted settlement activity completely.
</p><p>2.(C) Ambassador delivered reftel points June 21 to Arab League SYG Moussa. She urged Moussa to take a balanced view of PM Netantahu's June 14 speech, noting its positive aspects (e.g. Netanyahu's willingness to negotiate without pre-conditions). Moussa responded that in his view Netanyahu had not agreed to anything absent significant pre-conditions, and had rebuffed U.S. pressure on settlements. He said it was impossible, from both a political and tactical point of view, to negotiate with Israel while settlement activity continued. He acknowledged, however, that Netanyahu's June 14 speech was not the "last word" from the Israelis.
</p><p>3.(C) Ambassador said that progress was not going to be easy but urged Moussa to take the high road; it would be very meaningful now if Arab leaders articulated the promise of the Arab Peace Initiative (API) in some fashion. Moussa seemed to take the point, but said that under no circumstances could Arab steps precede Israeli steps, especially on settlements.
</p><p>4.(C) Moussa said he expects the Arab ministers to express support for the Administration, and keep the door "open" for resumption of Israel-Palestinian negotiations in the June 24 ministerial statement. He said that we could expect the ministerial statement to call on the Administration to provide more clarity on its plan for Middle East peace. Moussa also agreed that he would urge the Arab ministers to keep a positive tone on prospects for Middle East peace.
</p><p>5.(C) Moussa said that he fully supports the need to provide continuing political and material support to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Returning to the issue of settlements, he warned against slipping into the "old game" of "allowing" Israeli settlement activity to continue. Ambassador responded that we've been clear on settlements, as stated by the President and Secretary. SCOBEY</p>
