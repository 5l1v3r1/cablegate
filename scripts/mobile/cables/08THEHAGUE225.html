<br></pre></p></div><p>¶1. (S) Per reftels, MFA Senior Advisor for Nonproliferation
and Nuclear Affairs Ceta Noland told polmiloff March 6 that
the Dutch firm Inter Connection Technologies (InCo Tech) had
contacted the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs on December
17, 2007, regarding the planned export of connectors to Iran.
Noland said the GONL determined at that time that the
connectors in question did not pose a WMD risk; she suggested
the connectors were quite ordinary and run-of-the-mill. As
such, she said no objections were raised against this planned
export.
¶2. (S) Noland doubted but could not confirm if the shipment
of connectors had already been exported to Iran. She said it
typically takes several months after an export approval for
the export to occur. Dutch customs officials can check
whether an export has taken place, but Noland explained that
due to an e-system output delay, there is typically a
three-month delay between the date of the export and the
export's appearance in the Dutch customs' database. Thus,
she noted that even if the export had occurred immediately
following the export approval, it would not yet be listed in
the database. Noland welcomed any additional information
from Washington regarding the specifications of the
connectors, and how they might pose a WMD risk -- if the
shipment has not gone forward, then the GONL might be able to
reexamine the case.
