Mohamed Omar, Foreign Affairs Secretary of Somaliland's Kulmiye opposition party, said August 7 the USG should put more pressure on Somaliland President Dahir Riyale to reinstate the voter registration list and to allow the return of Interpeace, the NGO supporting the technical conduct of Somaliland's postponed elections.  Praising Embassy Nairobi's recent press release that criticized Riyale's position, Omar suggested the USG issue an additional statement from Washington (which would carry more weight), ask Ethiopian President Meles to reach out to Riyale, and impose a travel ban on Riyale and his colleagues for obstructing Somaliland's democratic elections.  Omar said Kulmiye Party had temporarily suspended its cooperation with the National Electoral Commission (NEC) and demands both the voter registration list and Interpeace be re-instated.  He said the party's fall back negotiation position to resuming participation is allowing the international community to participate on the NEC, co-monitoring the polls and co-announcing the results.  Omar characterized the Justice and Welfare Party's (UCID) position as more "hard-line" than Kulmiye's, but he thought UCID could be convinced to accept a similar compromise that allowed for the international community's involvement.  End Summary.  
</p><p>¶2. (C) Echoing sentiments similar to ref, Foreign Affairs Secretary Mohamed Omar of Somaliland's Kulmiye opposition party told Poloff August 7 that the Kulmiye Party had temporarily suspended its cooperation with Somaliland's National Electoral Commission (NEC) because of President Riyale's decision to reject the voter registration list and expel Interpeace, the NGO supporting the technical conduct of Somaliland's elections.  Omar said that Kulmiye's initial position is that Riyale reverse his position on the voter's registration and Interpeace before Kulmiye will resume participation in the NEC.  He said Kulmiye's fall back negotiation position is to have the international community involved in the NEC to co-monitor the elections and co-announce the results.  Omar said that representation on the NEC from the USG and EU member states or representatives of international respected governance NGOs, like IRI or NDI, would fulfill this requirement and give Kulmiye Party enough confidence in the electoral contest to trust the results.  He said that IRI had played a similar role in the past in Somaliland's elections.  He characterized the Justice and Welfare Party's (UCID) position as more "hard-line" than Kulmiye's on demands that the voter registration list and Interpeace be re-instated, but thought that UCID could be convinced to accept a compromise position similar to Kulmiye's.  
</p><p>¶3. (C) Omar praised Embassy Nairobi's press release criticizing Riyale's position, saying that it had caused NEC members to re-consider their decision to back the President. He called for the USG to put more pressure on Riyale and suggested that a similar press statement from Washington would be helpful, as it would carry more weight.  He also suggested that Ethiopian President Meles has influence with Riyale and would be in a position to change Riyale's stance. Meles, Omar said, has a vested interest in Somaliland's stability.  Omar also said a travel ban on Riyale and his colleagues for obstructing Somaliland's democratic process would be an effective tool in getting Riyale to re-consider his position.
