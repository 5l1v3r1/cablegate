 ¶1. (U) UK priorities for the upcoming GYMNICH meeting are 
maintaining EU unity in support of 1) Ahtisaari's Kosovo 
plan; 2) a "middle ground" approach to the new Palestinian 
Unity Government, and 3) moving forward on EU-specific Iran 
sanctions.  Martin Shearman, the Foreign Office's European 
Correspondent provided Pol Counselor with the following 
comments in response to ref on March 28: 
 
¶2.  (C) KOSOVO.  London's goal for the GYMNICH is to maintain 
EU unity in support of Ahtisaari's plan.  UK's readout from 
pre-GYMNICH discussions is that the "usual problem members" 
are moving in the right direction -- Sherman said the Slovaks 
in particular have made recent positive statements.  Other EU 
members with "doubts" about Ahtisaari's plan, such as the 
Spanish and Greeks, are signaling they will put those doubts 
behind the need for EU consensus on Ahtisaari's plan, at 
least at this point in the final settlement process. 
Shearman added that it is increasingly important for wavering 
EU Members, such as Italy and Spain, to hear that the USG is 
prepared to make Kosovo a priority with Russia. 
 
¶3. (C) ISRAEL-PALESTINE.  Shearman described a spectrum of 
views among EU Members on engaging with the new National 
Unity Government (NUG):  from those states that want to 
maintain a policy of no contact with any of the NUG's 
elements, to states that are prepared to fully deal with all 
components of the NUG right now.  Shearman described the UK 
position's on this spectrum as "in the middle," and said 
London is waiting to judge the NUG on its actions.  The UK's 
goal is to keep the EU on this middle ground for now, but, 
Shearman added, there is a growing belief within the EU that 
it must find some way to engage with the NUG soon or else 
President Abbas will become increasingly isolated. 
 
¶4. (C) IRAN.  London is "generally" pleased with progress 
made on the implementation of EU-specific sanctions on 
Iranian entities and continues to work for additional 
targeted sanctions, according to Shearman.  The UK will raise 
the Iranian seizure of UK naval personnel and expects a 
statement calling for their immediate release. 
 
¶5. (C) EUROPEAN NEIGHBORHOOD POLICY (ENP).  The UK is "in 
agreement" with ref points on this issue, Shearman said.  The 
UK particularly agrees with the USG on the need to keep 
Belarus outside of the ENP until there are tangible human 
rights improvements, but Shearman added, "you need to be 
making that point to Berlin." 
 
¶6.  (C) SUDAN.  Under "other matters," the UK will make the 
case for stepping up pressure on the Sudanese Government 
through the UNSC; if there is no UNSC action, the UK intends 
to lay the groundwork for greater (unspecified by Shearman) 
EU action. 
 
¶7. (C) MISSILE DEFENSE.  Shearman's latest information was 
that the Germans might raise the missile defense issue under 
"other matters," but this was not confirmed.  If the Germans 
do raise the issue for general discussion, the UK will not 
engage in a debate, leaving that to the Poles and Czechs if 
they so want, but will underscore that no EU action is 
appropriate or called for at this time.
