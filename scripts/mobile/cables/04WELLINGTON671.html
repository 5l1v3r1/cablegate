Press Release by New Zealand Government at 05 Aug 2004 
 
Foreign Minister Phil Goff today reiterated New Zealand's 
condemnation of on-going terrorist attacks in Iraq as brutal 
and pointless. 
 
Mr. Goff's comments support a statement by the Multinational 
Force condemning terrorist activities in Iraq and calling on 
countries not to bow to terrorists, demands. 
 
"New Zealand did not support the military invasion of Iraq. 
However it strongly backs the United Nations-mandated 
political process now under way as restoring to Iraqis the 
power to determine their own future,8 Mr. Goff said. 
 
"Terrorist attacks by dissident and foreign elements are 
mainly victimizing Iraqi people and standing in the way of 
self-determination and improved social and economic 
conditions. 
 
"New Zealand also utterly condemns the taking and killing of 
hostages.  We sympathize with the appalling situation faced 
by government whose citizens are taken hostage and threatened 
with execution unless terrorist demands are met. 
 
"However we have stated firmly that giving in to such demands 
increases the probability of others being taken hostage and 
killed. 
 
"I can only repeat the warnings we have issued to New 
Zealanders traveling to or in Iraq.  The situation there is 
so dangerous that it does not justify the risk. 
 
"If New Zealanders get into trouble in Iraq there is little 
the government can do to assist.  We could not meet the 
conditions likely to be demanded to secure the release of any 
New Zealander held hostage there. 
 
"Our message is clear ) New Zealanders should not go to 
Iraq, and those who are there should leave," Mr. Goff said.

¶3. (C) Comment:  While on record as supporting the general 
principles expressed in the MNF Statement (ref b), the GoNZ 
struggled over whether it should publicly support the USG's 
announcement.  Both the Prime Minister's office and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) expressed 
concern (ref c) over the logistics on the MNF Statement, 
specifically whether or not a list of supporting countries 
would be attached to the Statement.  MFAT representatives 
repeatedly referred to the GoNZ's clearly stated position 
that New Zealand is NOT/NOT a member of the Coalition, 
stating that the presence of 61 NZ military engineers in 
Basra is in fulfillment of its responsibilities as a UN 
member to UN Security Council resolutions (including 1483). 
While we should privately note the GoNZ ultimately did issue 
a concurrent statement supportive of our MNF stance, we 
should also fully note FM Goff's pointed reference to New 
Zealand's opposition to the invasion of Iraq and that the 
GoNZ has no desire to be associated with USG actions in Iraq.
