¶1.  (U) Please see action request in para 10. 
 
¶2. (C) Summary:  Several GOE officials have made statements 
suggesting the GOE will seek a new type of commercial agreement with 
the United States.  This "trade agreement for development" would 
evidently include political dialogue and cooperation (assistance) 
components in addition to trade, and would incorporate numerous trade 
protections for "sovereignty."  The GOE is reportedly working on a 
proposal, and apparently has convinced itself that this approach was 
endorsed by President Obama at the Summit of the Americas.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶3.  (C) The GOE has been hinting at a new commercial relationship 
with the United States, including a new type of commercial agreement, 
in several fora.  On May 7, in a meeting with Ambassador Hodges, 
Foreign Minister Falconi raised the possibility of a "trade agreement 
for development" with the U.S., while commenting that the GOE was 
working on a proposal which would meet the sovereignty requirements 
of Ecuador's new constitution (reftel b).  In a subsequent radio 
interview on May 14, Falconi expanded on the theme of a new type of 
"asymmetrical" trade agreement, explaining that Ecuador wanted 
agreements that would incorporate food sovereignty, financial 
sovereignty, and public policy sovereignty.  On May 13, Minister of 
Industries Abad also implied that the GOE was working on a proposal 
for a commercial agreement (reftel a). 
 
¶4.  (C) On May 20, EconCouns and Econoff met with the new Under 
Secretary for Economic and Commercial Affairs, Ivonne Garces, for an 
introductory meeting.  Garces led off the meeting by noting the 
importance for Ecuador of renewing the Andean Trade Preferences Act 
(ATPA), and then continued by saying that the GOE was working on a 
proposal for a new form of trade agreement, with the intention of 
reducing uncertainty due to the frequent, short-term extensions of 
ATPA.  Reiterating points used by FM Falconi, she noted that the 
basic idea would be a trade agreement that would take into 
consideration Ecuador's development needs and the limitations 
established by Ecuador's new constitution and laws.  She said that 
the idea was well-received by President Obama when President Correa 
raised the concept during the UNASUR meeting at the Summit of the 
Americas. 
 
¶5.  (C) EconCouns initially did not engage in a direct discussion on 
the GOE concept for a commercial agreement.  Instead, the 
conversation turned to Ecuador's stalled negotiations with the EU 
over a trade agreement, and that conversation provided some insight 
into current GOE thinking on trade agreements.  Garces said that she 
understood that there were basic international models for trade 
agreements, such as those used by the EU and the United States, and 
that Ecuador would have to work with those models.  However, Ecuador 
intended to propose modifications to incorporate "sovereignty" 
(particularly new constitutional restrictions), and the result would 
form the basis of an Ecuadorian proposal.  Garces mentioned several 
restrictions dictated by the new constitution that would need to be 
incorporated, such as priority for domestic suppliers in government 
purchases, and restrictions on private investment in strategic 
sectors such as petroleum and mining.  In addition, Ecuador would 
have to incorporate provisions established in its new Food 
Sovereignty Law.  Furthermore, Ecuador would seek to incorporate 
political and cooperation (assistance) components into its vision for 
a new trade agreement, similar to what it is seeking in its EU 
agreement (septel). 
 
¶6.  (C) On questioning, Garces said that Ecuador was still working on 
its proposal.  She suggested that Ecuador was defining the broad 
concepts for its proposal, but does not currently have any model 
language. 
 
¶7.  (C) EconCouns did not comment on the concepts explained by 
Garces, but did note that the U.S. Administration does not have trade 
promotion authority to negotiate trade agreements.  Garces appeared 
visibly surprised at the suggestion that the U.S. might not be in a 
position to move quickly on the forthcoming GOE proposal.  She 
returned to the point that President Correa's proposal had been "well 
received" by President Obama. 
 
¶8.  (C) Comment:  The GOE is developing broad concepts for a revised 
trade agreement model, although evidently with terms that will 
largely favor Ecuador.  It is not clear whether the GOE considers its 
pending proposal as a gesture to strengthen bilateral ties, or is 
simply motivated in part by a desire to have a trade arrangement that 
is more permanent and predictable than ATPA.  We do not have the 
specifics of what Ecuador intends to propose, but it appears to have 
at least two sets of issues that might differ from the trade 
agreements that we have negotiated with other countries in the 
region:  sizeable carve-outs in several sectors to reflect 
restrictions in the Ecuadorian constitution and laws, and an 
important, although possibly only symbolic, inclusion of political 
and cooperation/assistance matters. 
 
¶9.  (C) Comment, continued:  The Embassy does not have a read-out of 
how this matter was addressed at the presidential meeting at the 
Summit of the Americas.  However, it appears that the GOE believes 
that it has President Obama's agreement to proceed with Ecuador's 
trade proposal. 
 
¶10.  (C) Action request:  The Embassy would appreciate guidance on 
responding to the GOE even if they do not have an official proposal 
as yet.  We may need to manage expectations at senior levels in the 
GOE.
