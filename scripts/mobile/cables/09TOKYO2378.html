Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (S) A State-DOD delegation led by EAP A/S Kurt Campbell 
engaged October 12 with Parliamentary Vice-Minister of 
Defense Akihisa Nagashima and officials from the Ministries 
of Foreign Affairs and Defense on the historical background 
on realignment of U.S. forces and plans to relocate Futenma 
Air Station in Okinawa.  Nagashima stated that Defense 
Minister Kitazawa supported current Futenma Replacement 
Facility (FRF) plans, and that bilateral cooperation on three 
issues would help to achieve successful implementation of 
current realignment plans: (1) noise abatement at Kadena Air 
Base; (2) risk mitigation at MCAS Futenma; and, (3) 
establishment of environmental standards for U.S. military 
facilities in connection with the Status of Forces Agreement 
(SOFA), to be based on an agreement not subject to U.S. 
Congressional approval.  Members of the U.S. delegation 
countered Ministry of Defense (MOD) Bureau of Local 
Cooperation Director General Motomi Inoue's suggestion that 
U.S. Marines presence in Guam alone would provide sufficient 
deterrence capability in the region, and the airstrips at Ie 
and Shimoji islands might be a sufficient complement to 
Kadena's two runways in a contingency.  They stressed that 
relying exclusively on Guam posed time, distance, and other 
operational challenges for U.S. Marines to respond 
expeditiously enough to fulfill U.S. treaty obligations. 
They also underscored that the Chinese military build-up 
since the 1995 formulation of FRF plans necessitated access 
to at least three contingency runways.  MOD Defense Policy 
Bureau Director General Nobushige Takamizawa suggested that 
the U.S. Government incorporate changes since 2006 on U.S. 
capabilities, war plans, and increased coordination with the 
Japan Self Defense Force when briefing on the continued 
validity of realignment plans to Japanese government 
officials and politicians.  He also urged the U.S. Government 
to cooperate with the Japanese government in explaining 
realignment issues to the Japanese public. 
 
¶2.  (S) Takamizawa stressed in a lunch meeting subsequent to 
the briefing (excluding Nagashima and others) that the U.S. 
delegation ought not to take Nagashima's assessement of 
current realignment plans at face value and cautioned against 
premature demonstration of flexibility in adjusting the 
realignment package to be more palatable to the DPJ 
Government.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Director 
General for North American Affairs Kazuyoshi Umemoto pointed 
out that the DPJ Government had not yet finished crafting its 
decision-making process for realignment issues, as 
stakeholders such as Foreign Minister Okada, Okinawa State 
Minister Maehara, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirano were 
each focusing on different angles.  He also noted that DPJ 
President Ozawa might possibly involve himself in the 
realignment review process.  Separately, in an October 13 
breakfast meeting, the DCM, EAP/J Director Kevin Maher, OSD 
Senior Country Director for Japan Suzanne Basalla, and 
Embassy Tokyo POL-MIL Chief presented the same realignment 
briefing to Executive Assistants to the Prime Minister 
Tadakatsu Sano and Kanji Yamanouchi, stressing that the U.S. 
Government shared Japanese concerns on aviation safety risks, 
and would continue to demonstrate publicly a patient attitude 
on realignment even as it conveyed strong messages to the 
Japanese government in private on the implications on the 
Alliance from changes to FRF plans.  End Summary. 
 
Presentation on Realignment/FRF 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) On October 12, EAP A/S Kurt Campbell, EAP DAS David 
Shear, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for 
East Asia Michael Schiffer led a State-DOD delegation in 
discussions with Parliamentary Vice-Minister Akihisa 
 
Nagashima and a team of Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) 
and Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials on the history of 
negotiations on plans to move Futenma Air Station in Okinawa 
to the proposed Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) site at 
Camp Schwab/Nago.  A/S Campbell noted that the U.S. 
delegation aimed to provide detailed background on the FRF in 
support of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) Government's 
ongoing review of U.S. force posture realignment.  He 
elaborated that he had worked on Okinawa issues since the 
mid-1990s and that, for the first time in that span, 
prospects for significant progress had emerged.  Reasons for 
confidence included: (1) a strong consensus within the U.S. 
Government and U.S. military; (2) Congressional budgetary 
commitment to realignment plans; and, (3) support from local 
elected leaders in Okinawa.  A/S Campbell added that the DPJ 
Government had the right to review details of realignment as 
an integral component of the Alliance, and he offered the 
U.S. Government's best judgment as to the way forward. 
Vice-Minister Nagashima thanked the U.S. delegation and 
expressed hope that both sides would seize the opportunity to 
build a more robust relationship. 
 
¶3.  (S) The discussion shifted to an interagency-coordinated 
presentation by OSD Senior Japan Country Director Suzanne 
Basalla on the history behind FRF plans.  Basalla's briefing 
focused on the strategic context for U.S. force posture 
realignment, ranging from commitments under the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty through efforts to transform the Alliance 
with the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI).  She 
included an explanation as to the necessity of maintaining 
U.S. Marine aviation capabilities in Japan and, in 
particular, Okinawa.  The presentation then turned to reasons 
that the proposed consolidation of Marine and U.S. Air Force 
air capabilities at Kadena Air Base (now favored by several 
DPJ Government leaders) was unworkable, due to operational 
and political factors.  Basalla also reviewed the rationale 
for the planned FRF's V-shaped runways.  She concluded by 
discussing the continuing validity of assumptions that 
underlay the decision to locate the FRF at Camp Schwab on the 
outskirts of Nago City. 
 
Nagashima's Response: Three Items for a Realignment Package 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶4.  (S) Following Basalla's presentation, Vice-Minister 
Nagashima noted that internal MOD assessments on FRF 
resembled conclusions drawn by U.S. Government.  He added 
that Defense Minister Kitazawa was a ""realistic person who 
was one of the strongest supporters"" of current FRF plans 
among Ministers involved in the realignment review. 
Nagashima added that he and Kitazawa had recently visited 
Okinawa, where they learned of difficulties with proposals to 
move the FRF either off-island or out of Japan.  The 
Vice-Minister explained that, whereas the DPJ Government had 
not decided its direction on realignment, bilateral 
cooperation on three issues would help to achieve current 
realignment plans.  These issues included: (1) noise 
abatement at Kadena Air Base; (2) an ""out-of-the-box"" 
approach to risk mitigation at MCAS Futenma; and, (3) an 
environmental package connected to the Status of Forces 
Agreement (SOFA).  Nagashima observed that the Okinawan 
people ""strongly desired"" progress on the third issue and 
that the Hatoyama Administration had a significant 
""environmental orientation.""  He elaborated that Japan wished 
to establish environmental standards for U.S. military 
facilities that would be based on an agreement not subject to 
U.S. Congressional approval.  This agreement could use the 
U.S.-Germany SOFA and the U.S.-ROK environmental protocol as 
precedential models.  Political events over the coming year 
would also bear upon realignment, according to Nagashima.  He 
explained that the January 2010 Nago City mayor's election, 
the July Upper House election, and the November Okinawa 
Prefectural Governor's election would make clear ""what 
Okinawans think on basing issues.""  Of these three events, 
the Nago City mayor's election would be critical.  Nagashima 
 
observed that the Japanese government would have to set a 
clear direction on the Alliance, inclusive of the three 
issues he mentioned, prior to the mayoral election in order 
to realize current realignment plans. 
 
¶5.  (S) A/S Campbell and DASD Schiffer responded that the 
U.S. Government, like the Japanese government, cared about 
environmental stewardship and energy efficiency.  A/S 
Campbell pointed out that U.S. allies regarded the U.S.-Japan 
SOFA as the gold standard among basing agreements, and he 
counseled against moves to review simultaneously every aspect 
of the Alliance.  He added, however, that the U.S. side would 
be able to demonstrate flexibility on the three issues raised 
by Nagashima if Japan were to decide that this approach to 
realignment were correct.  He offered to take back to the 
U.S. Government the Japanese recommendation to work together 
on environmental issues, an area in which ""much good could be 
achieved.""  DASD Schiffer added that there were ways to 
address environmental issues without SOFA revision.  The 
U.S.-ROK process for environmental assessments and base 
returns, for example, stood outside the SOFA.  He concluded 
that the U.S. Government would be willing to explore similar 
potential approaches with Japan and to be a good partner on 
the environment. 
 
Reasons to Stay in Okinawa 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Japanese citizens often debated the reasons that the 
U.S. Marines remained in Okinawa, remarked Motomi Inoue, 
Director General of the MOD Bureau of Local Cooperation. 
Would not the U.S. Marine presence in Guam be sufficient to 
maintain deterrent credibility in East Asia and to respond to 
Taiwan contingencies, he asked hypothetically.  Inoue noted 
that a military helicopter pad was under construction at 
Andersen Air Base in Guam, where, he believed, up to 60 
rotary wing aircraft could redeploy temporarily.  He 
commented that this facility, plus high-speed naval vessels, 
might enable the U.S. military to respond with sufficient 
speed to regional emergencies.  U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) 
Deputy Commander Major General John Toolan explained that the 
Guam option presented time, distance, and other operational 
challenges, using the example of disaster relief.  Following 
the recent Indonesian earthquake, U.S. Marine helicopters 
based in Guam would have been unable to reach disaster-hit 
areas, and helicopters placed on ships would have taken four 
days to arrive, he noted.  The Marines in Okinawa, however, 
had been able to self-deploy to the disaster area. 
 
Contingencies 
------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Inoue also posed hypothetically that, if the U.S. 
military required three airfields in a contingency (a point 
raised by A/S Campbell), airstrips at Ie and Shimoji islands 
might be a sufficient complement to Kadena's two runways, 
obviating the need for the FRF at Camp Schwab.  MajGen Toolan 
responded that the Japanese government was still assessing 
the needs of the Japan Self Defense Forces (JSDF) regarding 
airstrips, particularly in the context of China's military 
build-up.  Until the Japanese completed that assessment, the 
U.S. side would have difficulty knowing the facilities that 
would be available for use.  EAP/J Maher observed that the 
runways at Ie and Shimoji would not be sufficient on their 
own, but would require the full complement of support 
facilities, including for refueling and maintenance, to be 
useable by U.S. forces.  Japanese discussion of contingency 
air fields often overlooks this requirement, he added.  Naha 
Consul General Greene noted that, as Japan worked through its 
National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG), it would be 
important for both sides to de-conflict expectations on 
Shimoji options. 
 
¶9.  (S) A contingency would dictate that all U.S.-controlled 
airfields in Japan be used at maximum capacity, not just two 
 
or three, remarked DASD Schiffer.  He elaborated that there 
might be contingencies related not just to Situations in 
Areas Surrounding Japan (SIASJ), but also to the defense of 
Japan itself.  This possibility was clear in war plans that 
the U.S. side had earlier provided to select Japanese 
officials, and Schiffer offered to provide those briefs again 
to appropriate counterparts.  He also related this issue back 
to realignment, noting that the redeployment of Marines in 
their entirety to Guam would not give the U.S. military the 
flexibility and speed necessary to meet its Security Treaty 
obligations to Japan. MajGen Toolan added that the briefs 
cited by DASD Schiffer required additional information from 
the Japanese government, an issue that could be addressed 
through improved bilateral planning. 
 
¶10.  (S) The dramatic increase in China's military 
capabilities necessitated access to at least three runways in 
a contingency, noted A/S Campbell.  In the 1990s, it had been 
possible to implement contingency plans for South Korea and 
China using only two runways in Okinawa, Naha and Kadena. 
The most significant change between 1995 (when the Special 
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) plans for the relocation 
Futenma Air Base had been formulated) and 2009 was the 
build-up of Chinese military assets, explained A/S Campbell. 
This fact, which was now a driver of U.S. military 
assessments for the region, was implicit in Basalla's 
presentation and could not be discussed publicly for obvious 
reasons, he added. 
 
Incorporating Changes 
--------------------- 
 
¶11.  (C) DG Takamizawa recommended that the U.S. briefing on 
the FRF should incorporate changes since 2006 regarding U.S. 
capabilities and war plans.  New factors, such as the planned 
deployment of MV-22 (Osprey) aircraft, high-speed vessels, 
and increased military coordination with the Japanese side, 
should be taken into account in explaining the continuing 
validity of realignment plans.  As a second point, he noted 
that the DPJ Government placed a premium on 
information-sharing and transparency.  The understanding of 
government officials and politicians is not enough, said 
Takamizawa.  The Japanese government also sought cooperation 
from the U.S. Government in clarifying the contents of 
realignment to the Japanese public. 
 
MOD and MOFA Read-out on the Presentation 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  (S) In a private read-out over lunch immediately 
following the FRF presentation, MOD DG Takamizawa cautioned 
the U.S. side not to take excessive comfort in Nagashima's 
assessment of current realignment plans.  The Vice-Minster 
had been much tougher in his questions on FRF during internal 
MOD sessions, and he was aware that A/S Campbell had spoken 
about realignment the previous evening with State Minister 
for Okinawa Seiji Maehara (a proponent of Kadena 
consolidation).  Takamizawa added that the U.S. Government 
should also refrain from demonstrating flexibility too soon 
in the course of crafting an adjusted realignment package 
palatable to the DPJ Government.  On environmental issues, 
for example, perceptions of U.S. Government flexibility could 
invite local demands for the U.S. side to permit greater 
access to bases and to shoulder mitigation costs for 
environmental damage. 
 
¶13.  (S) MOFA DG Umemoto noted that the DPJ leadership was 
still working out internally its process for deciding on 
realignment.  Foreign Minister Okada had been rigid in his 
reservation on FRF, and Okinawa State Minister Maehara had 
been aggressive in ministerial discussions (the latest 
occurring on October 9), given his claim as an expert on 
Okinawan issues.  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, 
Transport, and Tourism (MLIT), which Maehara also led, would 
be a significant player on the realignment review, though 
 
less so in terms of budget outlays for Okinawa.  According to 
Umemoto, the role of Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano 
in the ministerial discussion was also increasingly 
significant, in light of his close relationship with Prime 
Minister Hatoyama.  Hirano, however, was not versed on 
Okinawan affairs and appeared to be taking a more legalistic 
view of the responsibilities shared by the ministries in 
reaching a decision on realignment.  Umemoto added that 
although Foreign Minister Okada did not wish DPJ power-broker 
Ichiro Ozawa to play a role on realignment, Ozawa was 
pondering his possible involvement in the realignment review, 
given the serious political implications of possible blunders 
on FRF.  Another important factor in the review was the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), whose influence in Okinawa 
would suffer if FRF location issues were resolved.  DG 
Takamizawa added that Ozawa was the only person who could 
persuade the SDP to change coalition agreements on Okinawa 
and give the party something in return. 
 
Briefing for Prime Minister's Office 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶14.  (C) In an October 13 breakfast, OSD Senior Country 
Director Basalla, EAP/J Director Maher, the DCM, and POL-MIL 
Chief also presented the FRF briefing to Tadakatsu Sano and 
Kanji Yamanouchi, both Executive Assistants to the Prime 
Minister.  Sano focused on the fact that land returns south 
of Kadena as a part of realignment would reduce the area 
controlled by U.S. military bases from 19 percent to 12 
percent of Okinawa's total land area.  He also noted that 
although the majority of the Japanese public recognized the 
strategic value of the Alliance, the immediate social 
challenges and safety concerns faced by the Okinawan people 
regarding the bases would weigh significantly on the DPJ 
Government's realignment review.  Sano argued that a more 
immediate solution was required to prevent the possibility of 
aviation accidents in urban areas, similar to the 2004 U.S. 
military helicopter crash at an Okinawan university.  Sano 
added that there was ""aggravation"" at the perception created 
by the Japanese media that the U.S. side had become 
inflexible in realignment discussions.  The U.S. participants 
at the breakfast responded that the U.S. Government shared 
Japanese concerns on aviation safety risks.  DCM also 
commented that U.S. officials would continue to express 
patience in public about realignment, while relaying private 
messages to the Japanese government about the serious 
implications that changes to FRF plans would have for the 
Alliance.
