  		<h1>RACHID REVIEWS TRADE TIES, UPCOMING TRIP TO U.S. REF: A. CAIRO 1793 B. CAIRO 1550 C. CAIRO 1522 Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)1.(SBU) Key Points: -- Minister of Trade Rachid plans to spend November 17-19 in Washington and New York and hopes to meet with USTR Kirk and Secretary Locke. He will attend a New York event aimed at promoting U.S. business interests in Egypt. -- Rachid is interested in exploring ways to increase U.S. wheat exports to Egypt and has offered to meet with major U.S. exporters of agricultural commodities while in the U.S. -- Rachid remains unsatisfied with the agenda proposed by USTR for a strategic economic partnership. He wants Egypt's concerns - primarily areas of technical assistance - reflected in the work plan. MOTI senior advisors subsequently advised that they continue to regard the latest USTR draft work plan as a basis for agreement and will provide comments and suggested changes soon. -- Septel recounts Ambassador's conversation with Rachid on the bilateral relationship.</h1>
