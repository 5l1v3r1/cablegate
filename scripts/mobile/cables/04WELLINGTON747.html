¶1. (C) Summary:  Taiwan's economic affairs minister withdrew 
his application for a visa to attend a business conference in 
Wellington after the New Zealand government made it clear 
that it would not approve his visit.  Although the minister, 
Lin Yi-fu, had traveled to Wellington two years ago to attend 
the conference, the New Zealand government said that 
circumstances had changed and that it did not want to 
antagonize the People's Republic of China nor jeopardize its 
negotiations for a free-trade agreement with Beijing.  In the 
absence of a free-trade deal with the United States, New 
Zealand is anxious to secure an agreement with China and is 
aiming to start talks early next year.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Minister Lin Yi-fu had expected to lead a Taiwanese 
delegation to the 17th New Zealand-Taiwan Business Council 
conference, scheduled to be held September 6-7 in Wellington. 
 The conference was canceled August 30 after an official from 
the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) 
told the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Auckland that 
a person of lower rank would more likely be issued a visa. 
Lin then withdrew his visa request. 
 
¶3. (U) Explaining the government's decision, MFAT Deputy 
Secretary Michael Green told the Dominion Post: "Two years 
 
SIPDIS 
ago, we didn't have the level of tension between the Chinese 
and the Taiwanese that we've had for about the last year ... 
and secondly, we didn't have a major government priority the 
carrying forward of this trade negotiation with the Chinese." 
 On May 28, New Zealand and China signed a trade and economic 
cooperation framework for a  free-trade agreement (FTA). 
Both governments are working on a joint study on the costs 
and benefits of an agreement, which they expect to complete 
before the APEC meeting in November in Santiago. 
Negotiations then could begin in early 2005. 
 
¶4. (U) Green pointed to China's displeasure over Singapore 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's visit to Taiwan as 
suggesting the strain that a Lin visit would place on New 
Zealand-Chinese relations. 
 
¶4. (U) A joint meeting of the Australian and Taiwanese 
business councils also was canceled over the same issue. 
 
¶5. (C/NO FORN) Several New Zealand officials have told the 
Embassy that their government considers a deal with China as 
a lever for securing an FTA with the United States (ref A and 
C).  New Zealand also sees itself as in a race with 
Australia.  An MFAT official said this week that the 
government's major fear is that, after being left out of the 
U.S.-Australia FTA, Australia -- but not New Zealand -- will 
reach an agreement with China.  He described the New Zealand 
government's desire for a Chinese agreement as "obsessive." 
 
¶6. (U) The business conference was canceled two days before a 
conference in Auckland on doing business in China, sponsored 
by the Auckland Chamber of Commerce and Asia 2000, a 
nonprofit organization partly financed by the government. 
China is New Zealand's fourth-largest trading partner and 
Taiwan, its eighth.
