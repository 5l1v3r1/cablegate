¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On July 9, President Correa signed an 
executive decree prohibiting reproduction of clandestinely 
recorded video and audio without the authorization of those 
involved.  The media association responded saying the decree 
was unconstitutional.  While Vice President Lenin Moreno 
claims the intention of the decree was to protect the right 
to privacy, in light of videos implicating Finance Minister 
Ricardo Patino in possible corruption and rumors of 
additional videos implicating other members of the executive 
branch, it is likely the decree is an attempt by Correa to 
protect his administration. END SUMMARY. 
 
PRESIDENTIAL DECREE ALLOWS FOR EXCEPTIONS 
----------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) The presidential decree, which officially went into 
effect July 18, alters an article of the radio and television 
broadcasting law by prohibiting transmission of videos or 
audio tapes, but not in all cases.  It provides an exception 
if the video or audio is recorded by the media or public 
sector using its own equipment and with the purpose of 
impeding or providing evidence of a criminal act.  This 
exception would conveniently allow the government to use 
clandestine tapings for its purposes, such as evidence 
against the 18 congressmen who allegedly offered to sell 
their votes in exchange for appointments in key government 
entities (Reftel A). 
 
RECENT CLANDESTINE VIDEOS, RUMORS MORE FORTHCOMING 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
¶3. (SBU) The decree was announced a few days before Congress 
approved a vote of no confidence in Finance Minister Ricardo 
Patino on July 13(Reftel B).  Suspicions regarding Patino 
were triggered by the airing of a video showing Patino 
conversing with representatives interested in selling 
insurance on debt bonds.  Additionally, the decree came 
shortly after ex-congresswoman Gloria Gallardo planned to 
have certain unaired parts of the Patino video broadcast, 
which, according to her, would confirm that Patino delivered 
privileged information to Venezuelan banks. 
 
¶4. (U) Recent incidents of release of clandestine videos 
include: 
 
-- national TV station Teleamazonas' broadcasting of a 
conversation between Patino and President of Congress Jorge 
Ceballos, 
-- national print daily HOY's reproduction of a conversation 
in which Sports Minister, Raul Carron, bragged about his 
influence on Correa, and 
-- the airing of conversations between Supreme Court 
President Jaime Velasco, leftist legislator Ramses Torres, 
and former vice-president and Constituent Assembly candidate 
Leon Roldos by various national media outlets. 
 
MEDIA OUTLETS UNITE IN THEIR REJECTION OF CORREA'S DECREE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
¶5. (C) Representatives from radio and television stations met 
July 16 to discuss the decree.  They approved a statement 
that the media are in no way bound by "the unconstitutional 
executive decree" and that they will therefore continue to 
gather information from various sources and inform the public 
as they always have.  A member of the board of Ecuadorian 
Association of Radio and Television told an embassy official 
that he felt that there was now a "common front" among 
journalists as a result of the decree.  Representatives from 
numerous media sources that did not attend the meeting have 
likewise publicly affirmed their agreement with the published 
statement. 
 
CONGRESS TO ISSUE RESOLUTION TO CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
¶6. (SBU) Congress took up the issue in a special session on 
July 18, where it approved a resolution requesting the 
Constitutional Tribunal declare the executive decree 
unconstitutional.  Members of Congress claim they have new 
videos of Patino, but that they will wait to release them 
publicly until the Constitutional Tribunal rules the 
president's decree unconstitutional.  Members of Congress 
have even suggested that they are aware of compromising 
videos involving President Correa himself. 
 
CORREA DECLARES THE LAW WILL BE ENFORCED 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Upon his return from Europe July 18, President 
Correa emphasized that authorities will enforce the new 
prohibition on airing clandestine videos.  He emphasized that 
sanctions for violation of the broadcasting law are in place 
and could result in fines and even the suspension of the 
broadcasting frequency of the offending media outlet. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶8. (C) With recent incidents of videotaping of President 
Correa's cabinet members, it seems unlikely that the decree 
originates from an altruistic desire to protect personal 
privacy.  Rather, Correa is likely attempting to avoid any 
further embarrassments or distractions in the run-up to 
Constituent Assembly elections on September 30.
