Security Talks: Moving Out Bad Guys Top Priority 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶1. (C) "We are trying to put in place information sharing and 
coordination mechanisms to expedite quick deportations, 
expulsions, and extradition of organized crime figures," 
First VP and FM Samuel Lewis told Ambassador on January 15 in 
laying out his vision for the quadrilateral 
Panama-Colombia-Guatemala-Mexico security talks scheduled to 
begin on January 16 in Panama City.  Lewis noted that Panama 
had succeeded in securing "the highest level participation" 
for this conference, including the Attorneys General of 
Mexico, Colombia, and Panama as well as other top level 
police and internal security leaders and foreign ministry 
representatives.  Heads of state/government would also 
attend.  "We aim to start small with these four countries and 
then expand once procedures and operations are in place," 
Lewis explained.  "New participants will have to sign up to 
the procedures and mechanisms that we develop.  Working 
groups (mesas de trabajo) will provide structure to this 
undertaking and establish procedures for collaboration, Lewis 
added.  "In the coming weeks," Lewis said, "I hope to see a 
significant up-tick in deportations, expulsions and 
extraditions of bad guys to face justice in the prospective 
countries."  Additionally, he noted how Panama's experience 
was an excellent example of how information sharing could be 
harnessed to great effect to secure big advances against 
narcotics traffickers despite limited resoureces. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Darien Not Topic of Discussion, per se 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C)  While Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and Panamanian 
President Martin Torrijos would meet on the margins of this 
meeting during which they would discuss the situation in 
Panama's Darien province, Lewis clarified that the Darien, 
per se, would not be a specific topic of discussion.  If the 
Darien were to be discussed, it would handled in the context 
of how to deal with organized criminal groups operating in 
this sensitive Panamanian province that abutting Colombia. 
 
----------------------------- 
Very Concerns About Guatemala 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Lewis noted that Guatemala was the weakest player 
among the four countries that would participate in this 
effort.  "We (i.e., Panama, Mexico, and Colombia) are very 
concerned that the security situation in Guatemala is 
spinning out of control," Lewis explained.  "Guatemala lacks 
the institutions and capacity to deal with the rising crime 
that it is experiencing."  Hopefully, this endeavor would 
provide Guatemala some needed assistance and breathing space, 
Lewis explained.

Comment

¶4. (C)  The driving force behind Panama's desire to host this 
conference and facilitate this process is to address Panama's 
desire to: (1) clear out as quickly as possible high-level 
organized crime figures that Panama does not want to hold, 
and (2) preventinternational organized crime organizations, 
particularly Mexican cartels and groups, from establishing 
themselves on Panamanian territory.  In advance of the May 3 
general elections, during which every elected seat in the 
country will be up for grabs, security concerns -- violent 
crime, gang violence, and general delinquency -- have topped 
the list of issues on the forefront of Panamanian voters' 
 
PANAMA 00000037  002 OF 002 
 
 
minds, several polls confirm.  Lewis' multilateral effort 
should be understood as an attempt to respond to these 
concerns while also denying international criminal 
organizations the ability to establish a presence in Panama, 
a presence that would likely accelerate a deterioration in 
law and order on Panama's streets.  Panama has a rich and 
extensive network of law enforcement and security relations 
with the United States.  The GOP and USG consult constantly 
at multiple levels and often through complementary channels 
on a broad panoply of law enforcement operations and other 
cooperation.  Panama is now seeking to initiate a process 
that it hopes will extend and build a similar network with 
key partners and neighbors in the hemisphere.  The USG is 
well positioned to collaborate, compare notes, and cooperate 
as Panama launches this promising initiative.
