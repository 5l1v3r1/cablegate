¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Simeon Dyankov, a World Bank economist and 
financial advisor to Boyko Borissov's Citizens for the 
European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), recently presented 
highlights from GERB's economic plan to a group of foreign 
diplomats.  The platform contains immediate anti-crisis steps 
-- such as an IMF agreement -- and main measures to diminish 
the grey economy, to streamline the government, and to reform 
education, health and energy.  A GERB-led government wants an 
agreement with the IMF as soon as possible, and would 
maintain the currency board to reassure foreign investors to 
attract more FDI.  GERB plans to restructure the government 
bureaucracy -- splitting the Ministry of Economy and Energy 
into two separate ministries and closing down others -- to 
cut costs and increase government efficiency.  GERB also 
proposes reforming the education, healthcare, and energy 
sectors.  Part of GERB's economic plan is to cut the Belene 
Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) project.  Dyankov said Belene 
makes "no sense economically."  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------- 
DYANKOV'S MISSION 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  During a regular meeting of the Bulgarian Club of 
Economists and Diplomats (CoDe), Simeon Dyankov -- a leading 
economist on "a leave of absence" from the World Bank -- 
touched upon the key pillars from GERB's economic program. 
Dyankov, who some tout as a future GERB Finance Minister also 
met, also manages the GERB "executive branch strategy" -- 
putting together teams to work on issues for ministries. 
GERB has tapped Bulgarian expat professionals to return and 
advise GERB on all policies.  He has three main tasks in 
advising GERB: 1) finalizing their anti-crisis/economic 
measures; 2) advising on forming an economic team; 3) 
coordinating and implementing a "package of 30 measures" with 
specific changes to laws and to implement policies.  The GERB 
economic plan makes no promises but has identified measures 
to fix unemployment (short term) and investing in education 
(long term).  Dyankov threw out some names of the GERB 
"economic team."  Bisser Boev (former Economedia group chief) 
will be responsible for regulation and foreign investment 
problems.  Vladi Binarov will deal with the budget and 
customs.  Rossen Plamediev (a developer of Sofia Business 
Park and Treasurer of the AmCham board) will advise on 
Regional Development and Transportation.  GERB's EU Funds 
team will feature lots of professionals with experience in 
Brussels. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
IMMEDIATE STEPS FOR ECONOMY/MAIN MEASURES 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  Dyankov told us GERB will keep the currency board -- 
a signal for investors that the lev is stable -- until 
Bulgaria enters the Eurozone.  GERB will also commit to an 
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a 
future loan to counter risks arising from a possible 4-4.5 
billion lev budget deficit.  GERB has a letter to the IMF 
"waiting to go" requesting an IMF Plan.  He added that GERB 
will actualize the current 2009 budget (streamline budget 
expenditures).  Dyankov had reviewed the current budget and 
was surprised at the waste, saying that there is government 
debt in places where it is not even reported.  GERB will cut 
the next (2010) budget, and cut government payroll taxes 5 
percent.  Other main measures in the GERB economic portfolio 
include:  diminishing a share of the grey economy by 
electronically connecting customs and the National Revenue 
Agency, introducing a short VAT return period with reciprocal 
obligations for businesses and the state; optimizing public 
administration; and ensuring efficient EU funds utilization 
by a new project development system with better management 
and oversight.

STREAMLINE GOVERNMENT, REFORM EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND ENERGY 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  Dyankov said that GERB plans to restructure the 
government bureaucracy -- by closing down or merging 
inefficient ministries -- to cut costs.  GERB will add a 
"Youth and Sports" ministry, but cut State Administration, 
 
 
 
Disasters/Emergency Management.  The Economy and Energy 
Ministry will be split into two separate ministries.  The 
Ministry of Environment could be incorporated into Energy or 
Agriculture.  The Tourism Administration and Invest Bulgaria 
would be folded into Economy, as may EU funds coordination. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will absorb the European 
Integration Ministry.  All concessions may be handled of one 
ministry.  Dyankov prefers that all state enterprises (380 
state enterprises with ties to different ministries) will be 
consolidated into one mega state holding.  The Bulgarian 
Energy Holding (BEH) will also have a different structure, 
and may be included into the mega holding.  The Concession 
Law will be changed to create a "Concession Agency" to handle 
all government concessions.  Dyankov stressed that GERB will 
have professionals, not bureaucrats running the ministries. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Dyankov said that the Education Ministry's budget 
will not face cuts because the Bulgarian education system is 
in desperate need of reform.  The current government's 
higher-education reform package is "very good."  GERB would 
likely try to push that package through the next parliament 
and then focus on primary and secondary education.  The 
healthcare sector is by far the worst off of all the 
ministries and sectors in the country.  The healthcare 
situation is so bad that no one -- experts and politicians 
alike -- knows where to begin or how to fix the problems. 
Nevertheless, he suggested that they begin by cutting the 
waste and trying to instill fiscal discipline in the sector 
(and the budget).  In addition to separating the Energy 
ministry, Dyankov targeted improving the overall energy 
infrastructure and promoting energy efficiency as Bulgaria is 
the most energy inefficient EU country.  He said GERB would 
slash government funding for the Belene nuclear project; a 
GERB government will not support it as it makes no economic 
or financial sense. 
 
¶6.  (C)  COMMENT:  Dyankov is quite Americanized.  He seemed 
very optimistic, giving straightforward, no-nonsense 
presentation of the GERB economic platform.  He made no 
apologies for GERB's decision to finalize an agreement with 
the IMF or maintaining the currency board to reassure foreign 
investors and the Bulgarian public, while bashing the BSP-led 
government for its lack of anti-crisis measures and sustained 
budget deficit spending in a time of economic crisis.  GERB's 
economic platform is optimistic.  Streamlining the government 
bureaucracy, cutting budget expenditures in 2009 and 2010, 
and prioritizing Education and healthcare reform, make sense, 
but will generate political friction, while taking time to 
deliver results.  Much will depend on GERB's strength in the 
next coalition government.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶7.  (C)  BIO NOTE:  Simeon Dyankov, 39, is the chief 
economist for Finance and Private Sector at the World Bank 
group.  In his 13 years at the World Bank, he has worked on 
regional trade agreements in North Africa, enterprise 
restructuring and privatization in transition economies, 
corporate governance in East Asia, and regulatory reforms 
around the world.  He is also an expert in anti-crisis 
measures, and was a principle author of the World Development 
Report 2002.  He holds a Ph.D. in economics from the 
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and has published over 
70 articles in academic journals.  Dyankov-- originally from 
Lovich, Bulgaria -- was a former two time national track and 
field champ.  He has lived outside of Bulgaria for the past 
20 years, 18 of them living in the United States.  His wife 
also works at the World Bank and is being considered for a 
job with the Obama Administration.  They have two children.
