<br>SUBJECT: THE IMPORTANCE OF ESTABLISHING A POL-MIL DIALOGUE WITH LIBYA REF: A) State 112900; B) State 43049 
<br>
<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>1.(C) The USG does not currently have an established security dialogue with Libya. However, Libya's National Security Advisor, Muatassim al-Qadhafi, expressed his interest in establishing a political-military (pol-mil) dialogue during his April 2009 meeting with the Secretary in Washington (Ref B). The Embassy's country team views the establishment of a bilateral pol-mil dialogue as valuable to enhanced strategic engagement with Libya and in this geopolitically important region. We aim to achieve the following objectives, among others, within the context of a bilateral pol-mil dialogue: -- Libya's participation in the Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP), in which Libya is currently reluctant to take part; -- Signing of the Section 505 End-User Agreement; -- Discussing budget transparency; -- Addressing Libya's Foreign Military Sales interests; -- Addressing Libya's concerns about the eight Libyan C-130's in Marietta, Georgia; -- Libya's acceptance of MANPAD's destruction and humanitarian demining assistance; -- Libya's fulfillment of its Missile Technology Control Regime (SCUD-B destruction) commitments; -- Libyan contribution of helicopters to UNAMID; -- Increased Libyan cooperation with AFRICOM; and -- Civil-Military training and seminar opportunities (International Military Education and Training, Marshall Center/NESA/Africa Center for Strategic Studies).
</p><p>2.(C) The Embassy envisions the launching of the dialogue by the A/S for Political and Military Affairs and most likely the Libyan National Security Advisor, during the early part of 2010. Recent discussions with senior Libyan officials have made it clear that it will be difficult to make progress on the many disparate elements of our security agenda without an overall framework and single point of contact to marshal Libya's slow-moving and inefficient bureaucracy. Based on previous discussions with the Libyan Government, it appears that NSA Muatassim al-Qadhafi would be that person. We appreciate the Department's assistance in moving forward the bilateral agenda through the launching of a political-military dialogue with Libya. CRETZ</p>
