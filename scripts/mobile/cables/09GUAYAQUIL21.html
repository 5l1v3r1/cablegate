SUBJECT: Lunch with Correa's Mother and Sister - 
Admiration for Secretary Clinton and America 
 
Classified By: Consul General Douglas Griffiths for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  At a friendly lunch with President 
Rafael Correa's mother (Norma Delgado) and Sister 
(Pierina Correa) Correa?s mother expressed great 
admiration for Secretary Clinton, gratitude for her 
extended family's opportunities in the United States and 
recognition that "Rafael" could sometimes be a bit 
outspoken.  Pierina Correa spoke of her campaign to be 
elected Prefect for Guayas Province and her family's 
leftist political tendencies, especially in supporting 
the rights of migrants.  The Ambassador used the intimate 
setting to stress the successes of our Forward Operating 
Location in Manta, and the negative impact of its 
closing.    End Summary 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The President's mother, Norma Delgado told us 
that after raising her children in Ecuador, she went to 
the U.S. in order to care for her elderly parents.  She 
became an American citizen and cared for her parents in 
an age-restricted mobile home community in Lake Forest, 
CA until their deaths in 2008.  Following the death of 
her father, at the age of 101, Delgado decided to return 
to Guayaquil to be near her children and grandchildren. 
Delgado said that her entire extended family had settled 
in the United States, and expressed gratitude for the 
opportunities that the U.S had given her family.  Delgado 
also repeatedly expressed her admiration for Secretary 
Clinton, and noted that she was a long-time Clinton 
supporter.  Mrs. Delgado largely avoided politics, but 
she made it clear that she was pained by attacks on her 
son the President.  However, she did acknowledge that 
"Rafael" could be a bit outspoken. 
 
¶3.  (C) President Correa's sister, Pierina Correa, is an 
architect by training, but most recently has been working 
for a foundation advocating on behalf of Ecuadorian 
migrants.  She is currently a "pre-candidate" for the 
position of Prefect of Guayas Province.  Pierina Correa 
told us that she was polling strongly, and that she 
expected to win the Pais Movement's primary election for 
prefect.  She said that her candidacy had caused a 
fissure in the Pais Movement as traditional leftists in 
Guayas, including Constituent Assembly member Gustavo 
Darquea and Ricardo Patino (currently Coordinating 
Minister for Politics) and his brother Raul Patino, 
resent her success and accuse her of trading on her 
relation with the President. 
 
¶4.  (C) Pierina Correa said that she and her brother have 
adopted the "progressive" political tradition of her 
family.  She noted that her grandfather was injured in 
the "war" between progressive thinkers and President Eloy 
Alfaro.  Pierina Correa made some pointed comments 
critical of U.S. immigration policy, which her mother 
quieted by references to her own positive immigration 
experience.  When Pierina Correa erroneously linked the 
U.S. Foreign Operating Location in Manta to the 
interception of intended migrants, the Ambassador set the 
record straight and used the opening to detail the 
achievements of the FOL.  Intending the remarks to reach 
the President, the Ambassador stressed our regret at 
having to abandon the successful operations, and 
underscored the damage the closure would have on the 
international counter-narcotics effort. 
 
¶5.  (C) Comment:  We had heard from other members of the 
family that the President's mother wanted to meet with 
the ambassador.  She was clearly delighted by the 
invitation and was a bit nervous about dining with the 
representative of her adopted nation's President. 
Pierina Correa who spent extended periods in the U.S. 
during her youth and speaks excellent English engaged 
with us in her trademark direct style.  She also showed 
signs of her brother's perplexing blend of practicality 
and leftist ideology.    In any case, she clearly is 
proud of her U.S. connections and is convinced her 
brother is not anti-U.S.
