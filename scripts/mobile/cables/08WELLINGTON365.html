¶1.  (C)  In response to reftel, PE Counselor contacted 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Iran Desk Officer 
Marina Anderson on October 22 to inquire as to New Zealand's 
possible attendance at the November 30 conference.  Anderson 
explained that New Zealand had not received an invitation and 
the GNZ was unaware of the conference; P/E Counselor outlined 
the information in reftel and Anderson offered to let the 
Embassy know the GNZ position once and invitation was in 
hand. 
 
¶2.  (C)  On October 29, PE Counselor asked Anderson for a 
status report on the issue; Anderson responded that New 
Zealand has still not been contacted by the Iranian 
government concerning the conference and anticipates that 
Tehran is well aware of New Zealand's opposition to nuclear 
energy, lack of domestic expertise on the issue, and unlikely 
attendance; thus, Anderson believes that New Zealand likely 
does not factor into the GOI's invitation list.  She opined 
that even if Tehran did extend an invitation, the GNZ would 
not attend for historical policy reasons opposing nuclear 
energy.  Anderson said she would inform the Embassy if an 
invitation arrives, but again, does not anticipate that there 
will be one.
