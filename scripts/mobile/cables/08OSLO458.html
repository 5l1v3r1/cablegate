</p><p>Classified By: Charge de Affairs, Kevin M. Johnson for reasons 1.4 b and d 1. (C) 
</p><p>On August 14 Charge delivered reftel points to Norwegian MFA political director Vegard Ellefsen and urged the GON to contact the Russian government to express concerns. Ellefsen agreed with the substance of the points but said that the political leadership of the MFA would have to decide when and if to contact the Russians again. Ellefsen noted the public comments made by FM Stoere which were quite critical of Russian behavour. Ellefsen also noted the Russian Ambassador's criticism of the GON's comments on the situation in Georgia. Norway's position is clear, he said. 
Â¶2. (U) FM Stoere made extensive comments on the situation in Georgia in the media on August 13. He said that it will require a tremendous political effort to renew trust and strong cooperation between NATO and Russia following the Georgia conflict. Stoere criticised Georgia for starting the conflict with an attack on rebel positions in South Ossetia. Stoere's harshest criticism was for Russia, saying that the Russian incursion into Georgian territory is a violation of international law. Stoere did modify this criticism slightly by saying that Norway's relations with Russia are quite different and based on good and constructive bilateral relations. JOHNSON</p>
