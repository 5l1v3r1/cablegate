¶1.  (U) During his annual address to Congress on March 1 
(SEPTEL), President Nestor Kirchner made his first public 
remarks regarding the controversial paper mills under 
construction in Uruguay (REFTELS).  In his remarks Kirchner 
appealed directly to Uruguayan President Tabare Vasquez to, 
stop the paper mill construction for only 90 days while the 
best environmentalists in the world study the project"" and 
to seek an immediate solution to the problem.""  Kirchner's 
request was met with enthusiastic applause in the 
Congressional Chamber which held nearly every prominent 
figure in the GOA. 
 
¶2.  (C) COMMENT:  While the paper mill dispute has been front 
page news for weeks, Kirchner until now had left it to 
others, such as Foreign Minister Taiana, to press the 
Argentine case.  However, in a measure of the seriousness 
with which the GOA is taking this dispute, an EU diplomat 
(protect) told the Ambassador on March 1 that Deputy Foreign 
Minister Garcia Moritan had told the Finnish Ambassador in 
Argentina (who is also accreditied to Uruguay) that the GOA 
was prepared to break off diplomatic relations with Finland 
if construction of the plants continued.  END COMMENT
