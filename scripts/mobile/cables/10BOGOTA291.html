<br></pre></p></div><p>Political Section; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
</p><p>¶1. (C) On February 12, officials from the Colombian Ministry of 
Defense (MOD) informed us that private plaintiffs filed two 
separate petitions with the Constitutional Court dated November 12, 
2009, challenging the constitutionality of the U.S.-Colombia 
Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA).  The plaintiffs were unknown 
to the Embassy; MOD officials said that they suspected NGOs were 
behind the petitions. 
</p><p>¶2. (C) The petitions argue that, under the Constitution, the DCA 
should have been approved by the Colombian Congress and the 
Constitutional Court, as it creates new obligations and exceeds the 
scope of prior international agreements.  The plaintiffs cited 
several articles of the Constitution in the petitions, including 
Article 150, section 16 (which grants Congress the power to approve 
treaties); Article 173, section 4 (which grants the Senate the 
power to permit the transit of foreign troops); and Article 240, 
section 10 (which grants the Constitutional Court the power to 
review international treaties, and which further provides that any 
citizen may challenge the constitutionality of such treaties). 
</p><p>¶3. (C) MOD officials stressed that the DCA is not a treaty but 
instead a "simplified agreement" -- which the Colombian executive 
branch had full authority to negotiate and sign.  The officials 
indicated that in the past, the Constitutional Court has refused to 
accept petitions challenging simplified agreements, and the MOD 
expects the Court to uphold this precedence in these cases. 
However, should the Constitutional Court accept the cases for
review, the officials told us that they are prepared to reject the 
petitioners' allegations point-by-point.  MOD officials indicated 
that they will be meeting internally soon to analyze these cases.
