(C) We delivered Ref A demarche to Anneli Vuorinen, Director 
of MFA's Unit for Humanitarian Assistance.  Vuorinen said 
Finland agrees with the U.S. position set out in the 
demarche, and the Finnish Mission in Geneva has been 
instructed to say so to the Swiss.  Vuorinen commented that 
her sense of the ICRC Donor Support Group meeting in Canada 
was that those attending were agreed that this is the right 
time to convene the conference on the Third Additional 
Protocol, and that it would help if Support Group nations all 
made this point individually to the Swiss Government.
