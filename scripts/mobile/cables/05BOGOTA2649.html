Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) Before pausing for holy week, Congress passed 29 out 
of 67 articles in the draft Law for Justice and Peace. 
Disagreement over controversial issues, including confession, 
alleged extradition loopholes, and reduction of jail 
sentences for all prisoners remain unresolved.  The GOC will 
propose two additional clauses to prevent drug trafficking 
from being a political crime and to block eligibility for 
crimes committed before membership in an illegal armed group. 
 These amendments should help ease speculation that 
beneficiaries could avoid extradition.  Voting will resume on 
March 29.  Most of our Congressional contacts have told us 
that the GOC has the votes to pass its draft of the law. 
However, demobilization and the peace process remain highly 
sensitive issues, and it is not clear if voting will follow 
the traditional pro-Uribe/anti-Uribe pattern.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Benign Articles Passing Easily 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) On March 15 and 16, the House and Senate first 
committees passed 29 articles in the GOC's draft Law for 
Justice and Peace.  Minor modifications were made to some 
articles, but, for the most part, they passed unanimously or 
with a large majority.  (See paragraph nine for full list.) 
Prior to the debate, a small group of Congressmen in favor of 
the GOC draft or Senator Rafael Pardo's rival draft had 
reached consensus on the articles that were subsequently 
passed.  None of the approved articles dealt with the 
contentious issues of confession, alleged extradition 
loopholes, or blanket sentence reductions for prisoners. 
 
¶3. (U) Voting on article two was postponed because of 
disagreement over whether or not an internal armed conflict 
exists.  On article three, a large part of the debate focused 
on the GOC's definition of an alternative sentence.  Pardo 
supporters complained that the GOC's definition would not 
hold beneficiaries sufficiently accountable for behavior 
after prison and suggested using Pardo's language on 
conditional liberty, which calls for longer parole periods. 
The GOC revised its draft to lengthen the probationary period 
from one-fifth of the sentence of serious crimes to one-half 
(i.e. 2.5 to four years) and pushed through the article. 
Proposals to make the law statutory instead of ordinary 
legislation and to allow the United Self Defense Forces of 
Colombia (AUC) present their views on the law to Congress 
were rejected.  Voting was supposed to continue on March 17, 
but the session was suspended for lack of a quorum.  Congress 
will resume on March 29 after holy week. 
 
------------------------- 
Contentious Issues Remain 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) The debate will get more heated and less predictable 
when voting begins on the remaining 38 articles, which deal 
with alleged loopholes to avoid extradition (articles 10, 20, 
and 64), confession (articles 15, 17, 21, and 25), and 
blanket sentence reductions for all prisoners (article 61). 
Senator Rodrigo Rivera has repeatedly complained that the 
combination of articles 10, 20, and 64 create a "narcomico" 
(inserted text to provide benefits for drug traffickers) that 
would make narcotrafficking a political crime and therefore 
blocked from extradition.  In order to end speculation that 
the law would benefit drug traffickers, the GOC will propose 
two additional clauses stating that: (1) drug trafficking 
cannot be considered a political crime or connected to any 
political crimes, and (2) the law only applies to crimes 
committed when a beneficiary was a member of the illegal 
armed group.  This second addition will exclude 
paramilitaries, such as Diego Murrillo, who were active drug 
traffickers before 
purchasing an AUC bloc.  Senator German Vargas Lleras 
announced that he also plans to suggest a clause to prevent 
anyone who personally benefited from drug trafficking from 
receiving an alternative sentence.  The exact language of 
these additions has not been finalized yet. 
¶5. (C) Little has changed so far regarding other contentious 
issues.  Senator Pardo and his supporters continue to insist 
that a full confession is required to ensure the turnover of 
illicit assets and dismantlement of the illegal armed group. 
Many Congressmen continue to question the reason behind 
allowing all prisoners the chance to reduce their sentence if 
they collaborate with authorities and give reparations to 
victims. 
 
--------------------------- 
Uncertain Political Terrian 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Our contacts in Congress tell us that the GOC has 
enough votes to pass its version of the law despite 
disagreements over certain articles.  While the political 
balance in the Congress is fluid, the combination of diehard 
"Uribistas" and Conservatives constitute clear majorities in 
both houses.  Opponents of the GOC bill, including Pardo 
himself and leftist Democratic Alternative Party (AD) head 
Senator Carlos Gaviria, have admitted privately that the GOC 
draft will likely pass.  In the 19-member Senate First 
Committee, for example, strong opponents of the GOC draft 
number nine at most: four "Officialist" Liberals, three 
members of small left and center-left parties, and (possibly) 
two Uribista fence-sitters.  In the House Committee, which 
totals 35 
members, the total number of strong opponents is at most 13. 
Those 13 include two members of the "Pardo" group, both of 
whom have shown signs in recent days of being willing to 
compromise with the GOC on a text.  Turning to the 102-member 
full Senate, the Officialist Liberals, left/center-left, and 
independents number roughly 30.  The addition of -- at most 
-- five "Pastrana" Conservatives to the foregoing still 
augurs for an ample pro-Uribe majority on the legislation. 
In the full House, the numbers are even more strongly 
pro-Uribe, with Uribista Liberals and Conservatives 
accounting for roughly 110 of 166 total members. 
 
¶7. (C) However, the bill is politically sensitive and it is 
unclear whether the traditional pro-Uribe/anti-Uribe lineup 
(which favors Presidential initiatives) will prevail. 
Already the debate has led to unexpected political alliances. 
 For example, Representative Rocio Arias, an outspoken AUC 
supporter, joined with Senator Dario Martinez, a proponent of 
harsher punishments for the AUC, to propose that the law be 
treated as statutory rather than ordinary legislation.  Many 
strong Uribistas are from areas dominated by the AUC and may 
be pressured to vote for more lenient language.  First 
Committee President Mauricio Pimiento, a native of heavily 
AUC-influenced Cesar Department, voted in favor of allowing 
AUC members to present their views to Congress after Minister 
of Interior and Justice Sabas Pretelt advised against it. 
Vice Minister of Interior Hernando Angarita has said 
privately that Pimiento was attempting to move the GOC toward 
a bill more palatable to AUC leadership. 
 
¶8. (C) A persistent rumor in Colombia is that paramilitaries 
exert strong influence over 30 percent of Congress.  The 
figure is probably exaggerated, but the AUC undoubtedly has 
the political sympathy of some members of Congress who 
believe paramilitary actions were initially motivated by 
practical expediency or even patriotism.  The AUC will 
continue to look for ways to leverage its influence.  For 
example, Congressional elections are in March 2006.  Although 
the government reimburses candidates for some election 
expenses, Congressional races are still financed primarily by 
private donations, and the AUC can put a lot of money on the 
table. 
 
¶9. (C) Comment: We are seeing some progress in areas where 
the Embassy has been working: longer probation periods, 
removal of obstacles to extradition, and clearer language 
ruling out benefits for activities prior to membership in an 
IAG. 
 
---------------
