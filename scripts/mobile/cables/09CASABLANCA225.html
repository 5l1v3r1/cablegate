¶1.  (C) At a small December 7 dinner XXXXXXXXXXXXX 
 spontaneously raised the case of 
Aminatou Haidar (reftels).  He harshly criticized FM Fassi 
Fihri for not having provided King Mohammed VI with better 
counsel regarding the likely consequences and world reaction. 
 "At a number of levels, our decision was illogical, and 
Fassi Fihri should have made this clear to the king."  Now, 
everyone was adopting a typical Moroccan attitude, claiming 
that as the decision regarding Haidar had been taken at the 
very top, it could not be questioned or criticized, XXXXXXXXXXXXX 
added.  He nevertheless predicted that a way out would be 
identified soon, given Haidar,s hunger strike. 
 
Comment

¶2.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXXX is closely connected to the Palace and has 
served in a series of important positions in Morocco, 
XXXXXXXXXXXXX 
 His comments demonstrate that despite the apparent unanimity 
among the Moroccan government, political parties and the 
press about the correctness of Morocco,s actions on Haidar, 
other influential views do exist.  End Comment.
