</p><p>¶1. (C)  SUMMARY:  Under Secretary Burns and Assistant 
</p><p>Secretary Shannon, accompanied by Ambassador, met February  9 
</p><p> 
</p><p>SIPDIS 
</p><p>with Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez.  During a brief 
</p><p>drop-by, President Kirchner welcomed U/S Burns and A/S 
</p><p>Shannon and thanked them for their visit.  Fernandez 
</p><p>expressed the GOA's desire for a ""mature"" relationship and 
</p><p>honest communication with the U.S., and agreed that the two 
</p><p>countries have common ground on issues of social development, 
</p><p>the fight against drugs and crime, and international issues 
</p><p>such as peace-keeping in Haiti, non-proliferation and 
</p><p>counterterrorism.  In the context of a ""mature relationship,"" 
</p><p>U/S Burns raised the public   criticism by the GOA of a 
</p><p>commercial advocacy issue that   erupted on the eve of his 
</p><p>visit.  Fernandez said the criticism had not been aimed at 
</p><p>the U.S. and that he would make that clear (he did so in a 
</p><p>February 10 radio interview).  Fernandez and Burns agreed 
</p><p>that the issue resulted from a misunderstanding.  They also 
</p><p>discussed broader investment concerns.  U/S Burns encouraged 
</p><p>Argentina to act as a regional leader by supporting democracy 
</p><p>in Bolivia and Cuba and stressed that Venezuela's President 
</p><p>Chavez was more a threat to the region than to the U.S. 
</p><p>Fernandez, in turn, asked the U.S. to ""pay more attention"" to 
</p><p>Latin America.  END SUMMARY. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (U) U.S. Partipants: 
</p><p>Nicholas Burns, Under Secretary for Political Affairs 
</p><p>Thomas Shannon, Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere 
</p><p>Affairs 
</p><p>Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne 
</p><p>William McIlhenny, Member, Policy Planning Council(S/P) 
</p><p>Heide Bronke, P Special Assistant 
</p><p>David Alarid, Political Officer 
</p><p>Katrisa Peffley, Notetaker 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Argentine Participants: 
</p><p>Chief of Cabinet Alberto Fernandez 
</p><p>(Drop-by by President Nestor Kirchner) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>-------------------------------------------- 
</p><p>ARGENTINA AND THE US: A MATURE RELATIONSHIP 
</p><p>-------------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (SBU) U/S Burns and A/S Shannon, accompanied by 
</p><p>Ambassador, met with Argentine Cabinet Chief (and member of 
</p><p>the Kirchner inner circle) Alberto Fernandez.  Fernandez 
</p><p>stated his belief that U.S.-Argentine relations were positive 
</p><p>and improving, acknowledging past problems, specifically at 
</p><p>the November 2005 Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata. 
</p><p>He complimented Ambassador Wayne and former Ambassador 
</p><p>Gutierrez for their work in Argentina and their contribution 
</p><p>to U.S.-Argentine relations and noted the GOA's desire for a 
</p><p>mature bilateral relationship with open communications. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (U) U/S Burns also highlighted the positive nature of the 
</p><p>relationship, emphasizing common ground on issues related to 
</p><p>non-proliferation, counterterrorism, counternarcotics and 
</p><p>peacekeeping.  He praised Argentina for its peace-keeping 
</p><p>efforts in Haiti and its regional leadership on questions of 
</p><p>non-proliferation, and noted that Argentina is taking the 
</p><p>difficult step of dealing with its history of human rights 
</p><p>abuses.  U/S Burns mentioned the USG,s partnership with 
</p><p>Brazil on the development of biofuels, and suggested that 
</p><p>similar cooperation with Argentina might be possible. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C)  U/S Burns noted, however, that in ""mature"" 
</p><p>relationships, ""frank conversations"" between parties are 
</p><p>generally understood to be private.  He expressed surprise 
</p><p>that a private letter from Ambassador Wayne to Planning 
</p><p>Minister De Vido had sparked an uproar in the Argentine 
</p><p>press.  Just the day before the visit of U/S Burns and A/S 
</p><p>Shannon, one of Argentina,s major daily newspapers published 
</p><p>reports of a letter from Ambassador Wayne to Planning 
</p><p>Minister De Vido, written in support of a U.S. fund,s 
</p><p>planned investments in Argentina.  President Kirchner 
</p><p>responded to the newspaper reports by publicly protesting the 
</p><p>""pressure"" from the U.S.  U/S Burns questioned Kirchner's 
</p><p> 
</p><p>response noting that the Embassy was engaging in what is 
</p><p>widely accepted to be normal commercial advocacy on behalf of 
</p><p>reputable American companies.  Burns reiterated the fact that 
</p><p>the USG does not desire a ""divisive"" relationship with the 
</p><p>GoA. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (SBU)  Fernandez laid the blame for the incident squarely 
</p><p>on the newspaper, calling its actions ""impertinent,"" 
</p><p>""ungrateful"" and ""embarrassing,"" and accusing the newspaper 
</p><p>of publishing the letter ""with bad intentions"" because it 
</p><p>implied that bribes were involved.  He stated that comments 
</p><p>by the GoA were ""not intended as criticism"" of the Embassy or 
</p><p>the Ambassador, and assured U/S Burns that if the GoA had 
</p><p>been upset by the letter, it would have expressed its 
</p><p>concerns to the Embassy directly.  Fernandez said he would 
</p><p>make sure that it was understood publicly that the criticism 
</p><p>was not aimed at the U.S. Embassy or the Ambassador. (Note: 
</p><p>He made these points in a radio interview on Saturday, 
</p><p>February 10, which was carried in the Sunday Papers.  In the 
</p><p>interview, he described relations with the U.S. as ""good"" and 
</p><p>""mature."" End note.)  Burns and Fernandez agreed that the 
</p><p>commotion could be attributed to a ""misunderstanding"" and was 
</p><p>now behind us. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- - 
</p><p>ARGENTINA AND LATIN AMERICA: A REGIONAL LEADER 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- - 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C)  U/S Burns asked Fernandez for views on how the USG 
</p><p>and GoA could work together to deal with challenges facing 
</p><p>Latin America, saying that President Bush and Secretary Rice 
</p><p>consider Argentina to be a leader in the region.  Fernandez 
</p><p>said he attributed the current situations in Venezuela and 
</p><p>Bolivia and elsewhere to the failed policies and corruption 
</p><p>of previous governments, and, in particular, their failure to 
</p><p>respond to the social and economic needs of the people. 
</p><p>Fernandez said that the USG needs to pay more attention to 
</p><p>Latin America and its needs.  The impression in Latin 
</p><p>America, he said, is that too often the USG tries to dictate 
</p><p>what Latin American countries should do, according to its own 
</p><p>agenda.  The U.S., he noted, has more influence than it 
</p><p>realizes.  Fernandez also implied that the USG should not be 
</p><p>so concerned with ""types"" of government, whether left-wing, 
</p><p>right-wing, or centrist.  Using Argentina as an example, he 
</p><p>said that some critics say the GoA leans too far to the left, 
</p><p>others say that it leans too far to the right, but in fact 
</p><p>the GoA just makes ""rational"" decisions about what is best 
</p><p>for Argentina. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (C)  U/S Burns and A/S Shannon stressed that the USG has 
</p><p>actively sought to reach out to Morales in Bolivia and 
</p><p>Correa in Ecuaor.  The U/S said that USG policy was 
</p><p>""ecumenical"" and that the USG had no problem working with 
</p><p>democratically elected governments, be they left-leaning or 
</p><p>right. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (C)  Burns explained that Venezuela was another matter. 
</p><p>He told Fernandez that the USG has deliberately decided to 
</p><p>adopt a low profile approach to Venezuela, not responding to 
</p><p>Chavez,s ""immature, crude"" attacks on President Bush.  He 
</p><p>explained that the U.S. does not see Chavez as a direct 
</p><p>threat to the U.S. but that we do see him as a threat to 
</p><p>democracy in the region and believe other leaders in the 
</p><p>region ought to ""limit"" and ""contain"" him.  U/S Burns asked 
</p><p>Fernandez how he would assess Chavez,s influence in Latin 
</p><p>America.  Fernandez dismissed the idea that Chavez might be 
</p><p>the ""future leader of Latin America.""  He claimed that 
</p><p>Chavez,s ""unnecessary"" behavior had been ""severely 
</p><p>questioned"" by President Kirchner during a personal meeting. 
</p><p>Fernandez said that Chavez,s attitude is ""dangerous,"" and 
</p><p>expressed the opinion that the Venezuelan president,s 
</p><p>""sermons"" show that he wants to be Castro,s successor in 
</p><p>Latin America.  Although freely critical of Chavez, Fernandez 
</p><p>tempered his negative remarks by stating that Chavez is 
</p><p>president by the will of the Venezuelan people, and dismissed 
</p><p>Chavez,s fiery rhetoric as far more extreme than his 
</p><p>intentions. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (C)  U/S Burns urged the GoA to be an active advocate for 
</p><p>democracy as Cuba enters a period of transition in 
</p><p>governance.  He noted that the USG had been careful in its 
</p><p>public commentary during Castro,s illness and hoped that 
</p><p>other Latin American countries such as Brazil and Argentina 
</p><p>would step up and call for democracy.  Fernandez replied that 
</p><p>the GoA has a ""respectful but distant"" relationship with Cuba 
</p><p>and is dissatisfied with the current undemocratic government. 
</p><p> He referred specifically to the case of Cuban doctor Hilda 
</p><p>Molina, currently restricted from leaving Cuba to visit her 
</p><p>family in Argentina. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11. (C)  Fernandez touched briefly on the situation of other 
</p><p>countries in the region.  He called the situation in Bolivia 
</p><p>""unique and complicated,"" and described Evo Morales as a 
</p><p>president with good intentions but a rudimentary 
</p><p>understanding of power and the world.  He claimed that the 
</p><p>GoA has counseled Morales not to pick fights with the U.S. 
</p><p>because the U.S. is not his enemy, but he also acknowledged 
</p><p>tha Morales thought Bolivia should follow the example set by 
</p><p>Cuba and Venezuela.  Fernandez spoke of Argentina,s 
</p><p>relationship with Brazil in very positive and friendly terms. 
</p><p> He also called attention to Ecuador,s Rafael Correa as a 
</p><p>""visionary"" president with very good understanding of world 
</p><p>affairs. 
</p><p>

</p><p>--------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (SBU)  Fernandez noted he would be a guest lecturer at 
</p><p>Harvard in April.  U/S Burns invited Fernandez to have lunch 
</p><p>with him in Washington D.C. during that visit.
