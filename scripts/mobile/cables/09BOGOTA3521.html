</p><p>¶1. (SBU) The Colombian courts handed down two positive decisions in 
human rights cases, and a disappointing one in a public corruption 
case.  On December 2 the Supreme Court sentenced former Sucre 
Department Governor and Ambassador to Chile Salvador Arana to 40 
years in prison for his role in ordering the assassination of a 
mayor by paramilitaries in 2003.  At the time of his indictment 
Arana resigned his ambassadorship and disappeared, but was later 
apprehended by Colombian authorities in May 2008.  The Court 
notified the International Criminal Court (ICC) of its ruling to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Colombian justice system.  The 
sentence is the longest handed down by the Supreme Court in the 
"parapolitica" scandal -- in which dozens of politicians are 
accused of collaborating with paramilitaries.  It is especially 
noteworthy because the magistrates' stiff sentence punished the 
intellectual author of the crime as if he had physically carried it 
out.  Separately, on November 26 a Bogota court sentenced former 
Army General Jaime HumbertoUscategui to 40 years for the 1997 
Mapiripan, Meta, massacre (REF A) during which 40 unarmed peasants 
were killed by United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) 
paramilitaries deploying from Uscategui's Colombian Army base. 
Although Uscategui plans to appeal, his 40-year sentence remains a 
landmark as the most severe punishment given to an army general. 
</p><p>¶2. (U) In an expected yet troubling development, on December 3 the 
Supreme Court absolved former Navy Admiral Gabriel ArangoBacci of 
all charges related to collaboration with narco-traffickers (REF 
B).  Furthermore, the Court ordered an investigation of former 
Defense Minister Juan Santos, Navy Commander Admiral Guillermo 
Barrera, and Captain Jorge Tovar for leaking proof of Arango's
supposed guilt to the press before referring the case to legal 
authorities.  Barrera read a statement December 4 asserting that 
the Navy complied with all obligations to inform the competent 
authorities of Arango's alleged wrongdoings.  Ambassador Brownfield 
told reporters December 4 the United States is awaiting an 
explanation of who leaked sensitive U.S. navigation charts to drug 
traffickers attempting to evade U.S. interdiction patrols. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) COMMENT:  Supreme Court contacts have told us they intend to 
issue judgments in at least 80 additional cases prior to December 
15 in an effort to clear their desks prior to the holiday season.
