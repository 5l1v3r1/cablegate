<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p></p><p>¶1. (C) Summary and Comment: In the wake of the August cyber
</p><p>attacks against government websites in the Republic of
</p><p>Georgia, Estonia has provided both material and technical
</p><p>assistance to Tbilisi. Lawyers at the Cyber Center of
</p><p>Excellence in Tallinn have produced a legal analysis of the
</p><p>status of cyber warfare under NATO's Article V. The
</p><p>Ministry of Defense (MOD) is prioritizing strategic-level
</p><p>cyber defense planning, and the MOD's forthcoming 2008
</p><p>Cyber Defense Strategy will clarify lines of authority and
</p><p>create trip-wires to declare a national security threat
</p><p>during a future attack. Various Estonian experts all agree
</p><p>on one thing: Georgia was the latest victim of this new
</p><p>form of warfare, and the attacks are getting more effective
</p><p>each time. Estonia continues to lead international
</p><p>thinking on the cyber issue, having positioned itself as a
</p><p>niche expert on cyber defense based on its combination of
</p><p>past experience, a high level of IT expertise and
</p><p>dependence, and a small country's inevitable fears for its
</p><p>existence. End Summary and Comment.
</p><p></p><p>¶2. (C) BACKGROUND: In April and May 2007, Estonia grabbed
</p><p>international headlines as it suffered from coordinated,
</p><p>massive, and potentially crippling distributed-denial-of-
</p><p>service attacks (DDOS) from the cyberspace. The attacks of
</p><p>2007 were a wake-up call for national cyber security in
</p><p>much the same way as the January 2006 Gazprom cut-off of
</p><p>Ukraine was on energy security. For a period of about ten
</p><p>days in late April/early May 2007, key websites of the
</p><p>Government of Estonia (GOE) and private banks could not
</p><p>function, or had intermittent availability, and the country
</p><p>was forced to cut itself off temporarily from the World
</p><p>Wide Web. Both the financial cost of these attacks, and
</p><p>the parties ultimately responsible, are still unknown. The
</p><p>former - if known by banks such as swedebank and SEB
</p><p>Uhispank - is guarded; but the latter is widely assumed
</p><p>both by the GOE and many cyber security experts to be a
</p><p>network of Russian hackers guided and funded by the
</p><p>Kremlin. As the story goes, these hackers used popular
</p><p>Russian blog sites to instruct willing 'patriotic hackers'
</p><p>to assist in punishing Estonia for the GOE's decision to
</p><p>move the WWII-era Bronze Soldier monument. In addition to
</p><p>enlisting 'script kiddies' who did nothing more than click
</p><p>on links provided to them, or pass along a line of
</p><p>malicious code, this core group of hackers acted as 'bot-
</p><p>herders' thus magnifying their impact by exploiting scores
</p><p>of 'bot.net' or 'zombie' computers to send DDOS attacks
</p><p>unbeknownst to their users. Estonia's ad-hoc defense in
</p><p>April 2007, led by its national Computer Emergency Response
</p><p>Team (CERT) was to first increase the capacity of state
</p><p>websites to handle the massive volume of traffic, and then
</p><p>- as a last resort - to pull the plug to the outside world.
</p><p></p><p>Learning from Experience, and Passing it on...
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -
</p><p></p><p>¶3. (C) Now fast-forward to the cyber attacks on Georgian
</p><p>websites in July/August 2008. (NOTE: The cyber attacks
</p><p>actually preceded the August 8 Russian ground assault into
</p><p>South Ossetia and Abkhazia, starting with a July 21 mild
</p><p>DDOS attack against the Georgian presidential website. END
</p><p>NOTE.) In the wake of these attacks, the GOE has been at
</p><p>the forefront of the response to assist Georgia, and the
</p><p>ensuing debate within NATO and the EU on the meaning of the
</p><p>attacks. The GOE response has taken the form of (1)
</p><p>applied expertise, (2) legal thinking about how to
</p><p>characterize and respond to cyber warfare, and (3)
</p><p>strategic defense planning on institutional responses to
</p><p>cyber war. In addition to humanitarian and financial aid,
</p><p>Estonia immediately sent two cyber-security experts from
</p><p>its CERT to assist the Georgian CERT for roughly ten days.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Estonian Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of
</p><p>Excellence (CCDCOE) began an analysis of the implications
</p><p>of cyber warfare both under international law and NATO
</p><p>Article V. (NOTE: The CCDCOE currently has experts from
</p><p>four of the 15 NATO members who have expressed a desire to
</p><p>be Sponsoring Nations, including the United States. END
</p><p>NOTE.) At the same time, the MOD's forthcoming 2008 Cyber
</p><p>Defense Strategy will propose new institutional structures
</p><p>to deal with future attacks.
</p><p></p><p>Estonia's CERT Mission to Georgia
</p><p>---------------------------------
</p><p></p><p>¶4. (C) EmbOffs met with Hillar Aarelaid, Director of CERT-
</p><p></p><p>Estonia for his read on the recent assistance mission to
</p><p>Georgia. Aarelaid recapped the profile of the cyber
</p><p>attacks on Georgia: the country's internet satellite or
</p><p>microwave links which could not be shut down (inside
</p><p>Russia) were simply bombed (in southern Georgia). The
</p><p>ensuing DDOS attacks, though intense for several days, had
</p><p>less impact on commerce and government than in Estonia last
</p><p>year, where over 90 percent of the public banks online, and
</p><p>the GOE convenes virtual cabinet meetings. Yet the attacks
</p><p>on Georgia were more sophisticated than those against
</p><p>Estonia, and did not repeat the same mistakes. For
</p><p>example, in 2007, the 'zombie-bots' flooded Estonian
</p><p>cyberspace with identical messages that were more easily
</p><p>filtered. The August 2008 attacks on Georgia did not carry
</p><p>such a message.
</p><p></p><p>¶5. (C) Although Aarelaid stressed that CERT-Estonia does
</p><p>not have the full picture yet, he offered some assessments
</p><p>of the CERT-Georgia response. Roughly "ten years behind"
</p><p>Estonia, CERT-Georgia "did some stupid things" such as
</p><p>failing to keep archives of collected network flow data,
</p><p>which would have provided material for forensic analysis of
</p><p>the attacks. However, they wisely did not waste time
</p><p>defending GOG websites, he said, but simply hosted them on
</p><p>Estonian, U.S. and public-domain websites until the attack
</p><p>was over. (Steps, according to the CCDCOE, which could not
</p><p>have been taken without the lessons learned from the 2007
</p><p>attacks against Estonia.) Aarelaid felt that another cyber
</p><p>attack on Estonia "...won't happen again the same way..."
</p><p>but could be triggered by nothing more than rumors. For
</p><p>example, what could have turned into a run on the banks in
</p><p>Estonia during the brief November 2007 panic over a rumored
</p><p>currency devaluation was averted by luck. Money transfers
</p><p>into dollars spiked, he explained, but since most Estonians
</p><p>bank online, these transfers did not deplete banks' actual
</p><p>cash reserves. In terms of improving responses, Aarelaid
</p><p>felt that "We are fighting a global threat locally..." but
</p><p>acknowledged this may be unavoidable since, by their
</p><p>nature, cyber attacks require both a real-time response and
</p><p>a high degree of trust among those coordinating the
</p><p>defense, seemingly impossible at the international level.
</p><p>Although CERT-Estonia currently has a permanent staff of
</p><p>only four, Aarelaid said he "...could hire about 200 extra
</p><p>people in an hour..." if needed to respond to a future
</p><p>attack.
</p><p></p><p>Civil Law, Criminal Law or Article V?
</p><p>--------------------------------------
</p><p></p><p>¶6. (SBU) On the legal front, experts at Estonia's CCDCOE
</p><p>quickly prepared a scholarly analysis of the possible legal
</p><p>responses to cyber warfare. In "Cyber Attacks Against
</p><p>Georgia: Legal Lessons Learned" the CCDCOE confronted two
</p><p>of the biggest challenges to (A) determining whether a
</p><p>cyber attack rises to the level of a national security
</p><p>threat and (B) assigning responsibility to a state actor
</p><p>who could then be the object of a legal or military
</p><p>response. The report examines the potential status of
</p><p>cyber attacks as an act of violence from the view of the
</p><p>Geneva Conventions, the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and
</p><p>NATO Article V. The authors acknowledge at the outset the
</p><p>complexity of a situation where "...states use private
</p><p>companies to conduct cyber attacks and thus grant the
</p><p>nation deniability..." Since the North Atlantic Treaty
</p><p>itself does not define an 'armed attack', the report falls
</p><p>back on examinations of international law. It states that
</p><p>both level of damage inflicted by a cyber attack, and the
</p><p>intent of the perpetrator would factor into whether a DDOS
</p><p>rises to the level of 'violence'. Considering finally the
</p><p>intent of the attack, its resulting damages, destruction or
</p><p>deaths (i.e. due to paralyzed emergency response networks)
</p><p>and the ability of its attribution to a willing state
</p><p>actor, the CCDCOE concludes that "If all questions are
</p><p>answered affirmatively, there is a strong basis for
</p><p>application of Article V [to cyber attacks]."
</p><p></p><p>Institutional Responses: MOD and Strategic Planning
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------
</p><p></p><p>¶7. (SBU) Estonia's Ministry of Defense (MOD) takes cyber
</p><p>defense very seriously. In a 2007 address to Estonia's
</p><p>Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), Minister Jaak
</p><p>Aaviksoo likened a massive DDOS as "...the modern
</p><p>equivalent of a 19th century naval blockade of a nation's
</p><p>ports." In a September 2008 address to a CompTIA/OSAC
</p><p>seminar on cyber security, Aaviksoo again put the threat of
</p><p></p><p>cyber attacks in existential terms: "At a basic level, life
</p><p>and liberty depend upon your ability to control the space
</p><p>around you. Threats from cyberspace are national security
</p><p>threats, and cyber warfare is here to stay." In response
</p><p>to the attacks on Georgia, former Prime Minister Mart Laar
</p><p>called on Estonia immediately to "...create state
</p><p>structures for the anticipation and control of information
</p><p>attacks." That is, to get better at confronting the
</p><p>propaganda that accompanies a cyber war aggressor's attempt
</p><p>to blind its enemy to what is happening, and drown out
</p><p>competition in the battle for world opinion.
</p><p></p><p>¶8. (C) In a meeting with EconOff, XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX, outlined MOD's position
</p><p>on cyber defense and Article V. (NOTE: XXXXXXXXXXXX went to
</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXX and served as XXXXXXXXXXXX at the
</p><p>Estonian embassy in XXXXXXXXXXXX prior to taking up his
</p><p>current position. END NOTE.) MOD needs much better cyber
</p><p>intelligence, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, since even the CERT sees only
</p><p>a small percentage of overall internet traffic in Estonia.
</p><p>Banks such as swedebank here are often used for "test runs"
</p><p>of the latest, third-generation cyber attacks before these
</p><p>methods are used against larger western banks. While MOD
</p><p>does not take a position on whether cyber attacks should be
</p><p>subject to Article V, XXXXXXXXXXXX did outline three important
</p><p>considerations. First, a clear state actor is not
</p><p>necessarily a pre-requisite for invocation of Article V
</p><p>(witness NATO's response to the attacks on the United
</p><p>States on September 11, 2001). Second, there cannot be
</p><p>different standards for invoking Article V depending on the
</p><p>victim's ability to respond. Thus, having a cyber defense
</p><p>capability sufficient to thwart otherwise-crippling DDOS
</p><p>attacks should not affect the Article V umbrella. And
</p><p>third, there must be a clear idea of what Article V
</p><p>collective defense would mean in response to cyber attacks.
</p><p>Would it mean other members agree to host the targeted
</p><p>government's websites on their servers, or other measures?
</p><p></p><p>¶9. (C) While this debate continues within NATO and the
</p><p>international community, MOD is taking steps to improve its
</p><p>domestic response capability. Its forthcoming 2008 Cyber
</p><p>Defense Strategy will recommend a range of measures to
</p><p>increase international cooperation, raise awareness and
</p><p>improve the effectiveness of national cyber defense. A key
</p><p>recommendation is for the creation of a 'Cyber Security
</p><p>Council' under the structure of the GOE's national security
</p><p>committee which reports directly to the Prime Minister.
</p><p>During a future cyber attack, and with input from the CERT,
</p><p>private banks and others, this committee would make the
</p><p>call whether a given cyber attack - which after all occur
</p><p>all the time at low levels - rises to the level of a
</p><p>national security threat. This committee would also
</p><p>clarify who has the authority, for example, to unplug
</p><p>Estonia from the internet. In the case of the 2007
</p><p>attacks, XXXXXXXXXXXX noted, it was simply one technician who
</p><p>decided on his own this was the best response to the
</p><p>growing volume of attacks.
