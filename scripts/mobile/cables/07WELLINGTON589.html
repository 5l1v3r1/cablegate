Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) A Dubai company's bid to purchase New Zealand's 
biggest airport has encountered strong public opposition to 
sale of "the family silver" to a foreign company.  While 
anti-Arab sentiment plays some part, the real root of the 
opposition lies in the popular perception that the government 
botched previous privatizations.  Overwhelming public 
opposition, which says a lot about Kiwi ambivalence to 
globalization, means that the Dubai company is unlikely to 
get the local political support it needs to make the 
complicated transaction work.  End summary.

Barbarians at the Gate 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A Dubai company's bid to purchase a majority 
shareholding in Auckland's airport ran into trouble as soon 
as it was made public.  The board of Auckland International 
Airport Ltd. (AIAL) announced July 22 its support for the 
Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE) offer; seven other potential 
buyers have expressed interest in the airport.  DAE is 
controlled by Dubai's ruling al Maktoum family.  About 23% of 
AIAL's shares are owned by two of the four cities that make 
up the greater Auckland metropolis, Manukau City (where the 
airport is located) and Auckland City.  Remaining shares are 
publicly traded on New Zealand and Australian stock 
exchanges.  Under the complicated terms of the transaction, 
DAE would have to gain 75% shareholder support to purchase 
51-60% of AIAL for a total cost of NZD 2.6 billion 
(approximately USD 2 billion).  Shareholders will vote on the 
deal in November. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Reaction from the public and from politicians was 
swift and almost entirely negative.  Letters to the editor 
ran overwhelmingly against the sale.  Manukau Mayor Sir Barry 
Curtis, a politician from the traditional left who is 
expected to retire soon after running Manukau for 24 years, 
expressed vehement opposition to the sale, noting how much in 
dividends Manukau City had earned from its investment over 
the years.  Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard, a first-term 
politician from a business background who will seek 
reelection in October, waffled.  All but one of the 
candidates seeking to succeed Curtis and Hubbard in upcoming 
local elections expressed opposition.  The only one to 
support the sale was long-shot Auckland mayoral candidate 
Steve Crow, owner of New Zealand's largest chain of "romantic 
accessories" stores and sponsor of an annual topless 
motorcycle rally in Auckland. 
 
¶4.  (C) The opposition in Auckland was mirrored at the 
national level.  The DAE bid was a godsend for Foreign 
Minister Winston Peters, head of the New Zealand First party. 
 In recent polling, New Zealand First has been languishing 
below the 5% threshhold of support required for parliamentary 
representation; the DAE bid was perfect fodder for Peters' 
brand of populism.  The governing Labor Party has taken a 
neutral stand, citing its obligation to be an independent 
regulator of the airport, though PM Helen Clark shed her 
neutrality long enough to note that "in general, people don't 
like their public assets privatized," a sentiment later 
affirmed by Trade Minister Phil Goff.  National Party leader 
John Key said that, in principle, he would like to see the 
airport stay in New Zealand hands.  A Green Party MP plans to 
introduce legislation giving Wellington the power to block 
the sale.  (Comment.  The fact that AIAL, with 77% of its 
shares traded on open markets, is already private and 
possibly foreign-owned seems almost forgotten in the current 
debate.  End comment.) 
 
----------------------- 
Not Simply Anti-Arabism 
----------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Anti-Arab sentiment played a part in the public 
reaction, as evident in some of the more overwrought letters 
 
WELLINGTON 00000589  002 OF 003 
 
 
to the editor.  (One suggested that DAE would not allow Jews 
to use the airport.)  However, public opposition goes beyond 
ethnicity.  A poll taken in June when the only bidder on the 
airport was a Canadian pension fund revealed that 84% of 
Manukau and Auckland residents opposed sale of their 
councils' AIAL shares, with an equal proportion of the 
broader New Zealand public opposing sale of the airport to a 
single foreign entity.  A more recent poll revealed 81% 
disapproval of the DAE bid.  It is also worth noting that 
few, even among vehement opponents of the deal, have argued 
that putting the airport in "Arab control" would make the 
facility less secure or somehow expose New Zealand to a 
greater terrorist threat. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The real source of public opposition is New 
Zealanders' recollection of past privatizations.  Much of the 
commentary since the DAE announcement has called attention to 
the sale in the 1980s of the state-owned phone company, 
railway, postal bank, insurance company, forestry 
corporation, Bank of New Zealand, and Air New Zealand.  In 
the popular mind, buyers (often foreign) stripped these 
companies of assets, or ran them into the ground, or both. 
Similarly, that all of New Zealand's significant newspapers, 
banks and supermarkets are foreign-owned breeds suspicion and 
resentment.

Those in Favor 
-------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Not all voices are opposed or silent.  Editorials 
in the country's two biggest newspapers, the Herald and 
Dominion Post, urged that the bid be judged on its merits. 
Free market economists poke holes in the anti-DAE arguments. 
They argue that problems in the 1980s were not due to sales 
to foreigners per se, but rather due to poor government 
management of the process.  As a result, the phone company, 
for example, simply went from being a badly-run state 
enterprise to a badly-regulated private monopoly.  They point 
out that other countries have sold airports to foreign buyers 
without the sky falling in.  Heathrow is owned by a Spanish 
consortium and New Zealand's Infratil owns airports in Kent, 
Glasgow and Luebeck.  They also claim that AIAL is not 
particularly well-run.  It collects stiff fees (Air New 
Zealand is suing over AIAL's latest landing fee hike), but 
lacks the amenities one would expect from an OECD country's 
gateway airport - it has no brand-name hotel, no rail link to 
the city, and a road link often so clogged that getting to 
and from the airport is more easily accomplished by 
navigating through suburban neighborhoods.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (C) Reaction to the DAE bid shows how ambivalent New 
Zealanders are about globalization.  Most Kiwis understand 
that countries with thriving economies are those that are 
open to the world.  So in public they recognize that the 
country needs immigrants to replace the thousands of young 
Kiwis who emigrate each year, but they mutter in private (and 
sometimes publicly) that Asians are lousy drivers and are 
bidding up real estate prices.  They insist that they want an 
FTA with the U.S. but reject on largely nationalistic grounds 
a reasonable and cost-saving proposal to set up a joint drug 
testing agency with Australia.  Their own airport company 
owns facilities abroad, but their foreign minister describes 
the proposed sale of New Zealand's airport, inevitably 
described as "a strategic asset" or "the family silver," as 
"economic treachery." 
 
¶9.  (C) DAE's bid probably will not succeed.  Under the 
complicated terms of its proposal (apparently cheaper for DAE 
than simply going to the market to buy 51% of openly-traded 
shares), DAE needs the support of at least one of the two 
city councils.  While it could technically reach 75% 
shareholder support without the 23% of shares owned by 
Manukau and Auckland, most commentators believe that gaining 
the support of virtually all of the holders of 
publicly-traded shares is just too high a bar to overcome. 
 
¶10.  (C) Manukau Mayor Curtis has already made clear where he 
stands.  Auckland Mayor Hubbard, a businessman, is probably 
philosophically open to the sale, but he faces a tough 
reelection campaign and will probably bend to popular will. 
 
WELLINGTON 00000589  003 OF 003 
 
 
The major national parties will be reluctant to get involved. 
 One National MP told Auckland PO that, while he is depressed 
that the DAE bid is not being considered on its commercial 
merits, his party will certainly lie low and say as little 
about the situation as it can get away with.  Against all 
this, the support of a few liberal economists, newspaper 
editorial writers, and New Zealand's leading pornography 
vendor is probably little consolation to DAE.
