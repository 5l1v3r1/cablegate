<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR KENNARD’S MEETING WITH SPANISH 
<br>PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO THE EU
<br></pre></p></div><p>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On February 1, Ambassador Kennard made a courtesy call on the Spanish Permanent Representative to the European Union, Carlos Bastarreche Segues. They discussed the state of play for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP), the nature of the European Parliament after the Lisbon Treaty, and prospects for a U.S.-EU Summit in Madrid in May. On TFTP, Spain intends to continue its strong efforts in support of a long-term agreement. On the Summit, Bastarreche presented both Spain’s and the EU’s position, which differed. Ambassador Kennard underscored the importance the Obama administration puts on needing deliverables from the President’s foreign travel. END SUMMARY
Terrorist Financing Tracking Program Interim Agreement
¶2. (C) Bastarreche’s first priority was to discuss the state of play with the TFTP agreement. He was very concerned that the interim agreement on TFTP was reached on the last possible day before the Lisbon Treaty came into force, which meant that Spain needed to be serious about damage control in the wake of suspicions that the United States and the EU Council colluded to pre-empt Parliamentary action on the agreement. Regrettably, there had also been inefficiencies and inadequate follow-up to the interim TFTP agreement, Bastarreche said. As an example, Bastarreche cited a call he received on January 17 from the Cabinet of European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek, asking why the Spanish Presidency had not responded to Buzek’s letter - a letter no one had seen. Bastarreche said the Spanish Presidency was determined to be diligent about follow-up and keeping the Parliament informed. He cited the involvement of Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero, who had since responded to Buzek with detailed legal arguments, as an indication of the high level of support for this issue. Regarding Information (and incoming Justice and Fundamental Rights) Commissioner Viviane Reding’s recent public comments against TFTP, Bastarreche called the remarks irresponsible, saying, “She is not entitled to speak against the position of the Commission.” He characterized such anti-TFTP views as in keeping with her populist politics, i.e., done for public favor.
¶3. (C) For next steps on TFTP, Bastarreche said Spain will continue to try to convince the Germans to support TFTP. Spain also planned to discuss on February 2, at the Council level, a letter to Parliament which provides encouragement and justification for members of the European Parliament to wait for the interim mandate to expire in October 2010 and thus delay a definitive vote. By waiting, they can be assured that the duratnt while the U.Sessions that l the current Parliament instead feels they need to show their strength. As a result, work on many issues is parayzed.
U.S. - EU Summit
¶5. (C) Regarding Qhe proposed U.S.-EU Summit, Bastarreche preseted both the Spanish and the EU views. Madrid sees a visit by President Obama as extremely had become a strained bilateral relationship under President Bush. However, if Washington chose not to pursue the Summit during the Spanish Presidency, but could commit itself now to a bilateral meeting in Madrid later this year, then Spain would be satisfied. The EU thinks it would be a mistake for the United State to opt out of the Summit, given the substantive issues that will need to be addressed this semester, including Afghanistan, Iran, and China. Bastarreche stated PM Zapatero has more latitude on those key issues than Commission President Barroso or EU Council President Van Rompuy. Bastarreche said climate change is another reason not to delay a summit until the second semester, as that would put the conversation near the Mexico climate change conference. The proximity to the Mexico conference could influence the agenda at a time when the issue needs to be “de-dramatized.”
¶6. (C) Ambassador Kennard assured Bastarreche the Summit was under consideration in Washington at present, but stressed the importance the Obama administration places on results. He said the White House understands the important symbolism of the Summit, but is very focused on the domestic agenda and overseas travel would have to lead to tangible outcomes. Ambassador Kennard assured Bastarreche that he would pass his concerns on to Washington and would let him know directly when a decision was made. (NOTE: Ambassador Kennard placed a phone call to Bastarreche later that evening and eventually informed Bastarreche of the White House decision on the morning of February 2. END NOTE)
