  		<h1>TIP PROSECUTOR TALKS ABOUT THE COMPREHENSIVE TRAFFICKING LAW REF: CAIRO 1758 Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs Donald A. Blome for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(C) Key Points: -- Hany Fathy Georgy, Senior Chief Prosecutor for Human Rights and trafficking-in-persons (TIP) said the draft of Egypt's comprehensive trafficking law conforms to all international standards including protection of the victim. -- Georgy said the Muslim Brotherhood will oppose the law as being against Sharia, Arab culture, and forced on Egypt by the West. However, he hopes strong support from First Lady Suzanne Mubarak will convince legislators to pass the law. -- Georgy said Egyptian TIP officials believe the U.S. TIP Report is counterproductive because it tries to "shame" Egypt into compliance. -- Lack of training for police and prosecutors is the biggest hurdle to implementation of trafficking laws in Egypt.</h1>
