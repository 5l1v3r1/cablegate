END SUMMARY.
¶2. (U) UN Participants: SYG Ban Ki-Moon, DPA U/SYG Lynn

--------------------------
Getting Work Done Together
--------------------------
¶3. (C) AMB Khalilzad opened the meeting by commenting that he
had worked closely with the UN both in Afghanistan and Iraq
and looked forward to working with the Secretariat to find
solutions to the most pressing global problems. The U.S. and
the UN can get a lot of work done when they work together
effectively. SYG Ban singled out Iraq, Kosovo, Darfur and
Lebanon as the most pressing geopolitical problem areas for
the UN to address. SYG Ban added that he looked forward to
working with AMB Khalilzad during the May U.S. UNSC
presidency.
------
Kosovo
------
¶4. (C) SYG Ban inquired whether the UNSC mission to Kosovo
had brought the UNSC any closer to an agreement on the
Ahtisaari plan. AMB Khalilzad responded that the
presentations by the UN officials and Kosovar leaders had
assuaged some of the concerns of the UNSC regarding the
Ahtisaari proposals and he believes the UNSC is ready to move
forward on Ahtisaari's recommendations. SYG Ban responded
that he was ready "to assist the effort in any way possible"
and reported that he had already reached out to China, South
Africa, Indonesia and Qatar. SYG Ban said he planned to
reach out to the remaining elected UNSC members in the coming
few days.
¶5. (C) SYG Ban highlighted the importance of a unified EU
position on Kosovo, EU engagement with Serbia, and expanded
economic assistance for Balkan development. AMB Khalilzad
concurred, adding that there was also a need to address
outstanding issues regarding both Serbian and Kosovar IDPs
and some members of the UNSC delegation had mentioned the
idea of a Special Envoy to deal with this issue. SYG Ban
said he was prepared to help with this idea also.
--------------
Climate Change
--------------
¶6. (C) SYG Ban brought up the issue of climate change and
said he is planning a high-level UN event focused on climate
change to take place at the margins of the UNGA on September
¶24. SYG Ban said he plans to name Gro Harlem Brundtland
(former PM of Norway) Ricardo Lagos (former President of
Chile), and Han Seung-soo (former FM of South Korea) as his
SRSGs on climate change to work together and individually to
promote a "convergence of views" on climate change.
Separately, SYG Ban said he would host a dinner of selected
leaders on the eve of the opening debate of the General
Assembly for an informal discussion and highlighted the
importance of President Bush's attendance. SYG Ban asked if
POTUS participation in such a climate change event would be
possible. AMB Khalilzad said that the U.S. shared the goal
of finding an effective and appropriate role for the UN to
address climate change and promised to communicate the SYG's
request for POTUS participation.
--------------------
UN Capacity Building
--------------------
¶7. (C) AMB Khalilzad said that building the capacity of the
UN to respond effectively to global problems is one of the
major objectives for his tenure at USUN and promised to work
closely with SYG Ban to identify substantive, attainable
goals, and support the SYG's management reform goals. SYG
Ban concurred that sustained U.S. support for capacity
building is essential to move forward on any issue. SYG Ban
commented that while U.S.-UN relations had gone through "a
difficult period" in recent years, "without U.S. support for
the UN, nothing happens." SYG Ban closed by saying that he
looked forward to working with AMB Khalilzad on management
reform efforts commenting, "your success is our success."
