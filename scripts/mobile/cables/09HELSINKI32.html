¶1. (C)  SUMMARY. Polchief met on January 21 with Deputy 
Director Markku Lampinen of the MFA's Unit for EU Common 
Foreign and Security Policy regarding the January 26-27 GAERC 
(REF A).  Lampinen stated that the Foreign Ministers' (FMs) 
agenda contains two broad topics, the Middle East Peace 
Process and relations with Ukraine and Russia.  However, 
under "other business" he expects a discussion of a possible 
common EU policy regarding Guantanamo detainees.  On the 
Peace Process, the Finns support re-activating and possibly 
expanding the EU border mission at Rafah; on Ukraine and 
Russia the Finns support continuing negotiations with Russia 
on the post-Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) and 
Ukraine on the Association Aagreement while also sending a 
strong message that the recent natural gas dispute has 
damaged each country's credibility; and on Guantanamo 
detainees, the Finns welcome the FMs' discussion of a 
possible common policy regarding a U.S. request to accept 
detainees, and are prepared to seriously consider such a 
request from the new Administration.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Middle East Peace Process 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C)  In their discussions, the FMs will focus on Gaza and 
what the EU can and should do.  Specifically, they will 
examine how to secure the delivery of humanitarian aid to and 
within Gaza, and how to ensure a durable cease-fire.  In 
addition, they will discuss how to address Israel's security 
needs, perhaps by re-activating and expanding the EU's Rafah 
border mission, or by participating in a peacekeeping 
operation.  Lampinen stressed that he could only offer vague 
outlines now, considering that between now and the GAERC the 
FMs will meet separately with Israeli FM Livni and 
Palestinian representatives. 
 
¶3. (C) The Finnish position is that all parties should 
immediately implement the UN resolution; the EU should be 
active in supporting the cease-fire; the EU should 
re-activate the border mission soon and consider expanding it 
(the Finns already have a border expert on the ground, and 
the GOF is prepared to send more); smuggling of arms and 
ammunition must stop; all crossing points should be opened; 
and the peace process must be kept alive.  Lampinen also said 
the GOF supports the creation of a Palestinian unity 
government. 
 
EU relations with Ukraine and Russia 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (C) The GAERC discussion of the EU's relations with 
Ukraine and Russia falls under the broad topic of "energy 
security," although the FMs likely will engage in a political 
debate the EU's relations with the two and on negotiations 
with the Russia on the post-PCA and with Ukraine on the 
Association Agreement.  The Finns favor continuing both 
negotiations and hope that the FMs agree on how to advance 
them.  However, they also support the EU sending a message to 
each that as a result of the dispute over natural gas their 
credibility as a reliable partner has been damaged and is at 
stake, and their recent actions threaten to make negotiations 
of the agreements more difficult.  In light of the recent 
dispute between the two, FM Stubb might suggest that the EU 
include some form of dispute resolution provision within each 
agreement under negotiation. 
 
Guantanamo Detainees 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Lampinen described the GAERC discussion as a 
"preliminary" one at the request of Portugal's Foreign 
Minister.  In anticipation of a formal request from the Obama 
Administration, the FMs' will discuss whether the EU can 
achieve a common position regarding accepting Guantanamo 
detainees.  Lampinen said the discussion flows directly from 
FM discussions last autumn about improving Transatlantic 
relations, with some EU members urging that Europe make fewer 
demands of and complaints about the U.S. and shoulder more 
burdens. Lampinen said that the GOF would welcome a common 
policy line and will approach the discussion positively.  He 
believes a common position is possible, but added that the 
matter could be a "divisive" one, as some EU members are not 
keen to accept detainees. 
 
¶6. (C) According to Lampinen, The GOF has not discussed the 
matter "in depth." Asked about the prior Administration's 
request that Finland accept detainees, Lampinen cited FM 
 
Stubb for the position that internal GOF discussions would 
await a formal request from the new Administration and a 
formal decision to close the Guantanamo detention facility; 
following a request under those circumstances an 
"inter-ministerial Task Force" (including the MFA, Justice 
and Interior) would formally consider the matter.  As the 
USG's prior request is no longer operative, Lampinen added 
that the GOF's prior insistence on a UNHCR referral for any 
detainee was also not operative (REF B).
