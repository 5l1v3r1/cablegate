¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  Swedish intermediaries have reportedly arranged 
for a meeting in Sweden between representatives of the Government 
of Colombia (GOC) and representatives of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC).  Separately, negotiations proceeded for 
the humanitarian release of two military prisoners held by the 
FARC.  The GOC and other observers believe opposition Senator 
Piedad Cordoba engineered delays in the release to maximize impact 
before the March 14 congressional elections.  The National 
Liberation Army (ELN) also responded positively to a request for a 
meeting, likely in Colombia, to discuss possible peace talks.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
 
FARC Hints At Meeting in Sweden 
 
------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (S/NF) High Commissioner for Peace Frank Pearl told Polcouns 
February 4 that the Swedish Ambassador had relayed a positive 
response by FARC leadership to a GOC offer to meet (reftel).  Pearl 
said the information had been passed by an unidentified FARC member 
living in Sweden via a former Swedish Ambassador to Colombia and 
current head of the International Council of Swedish Industry 
(NIR).  Pearl said in the message the FARC had agreed in principle 
to a meeting between two GOC representatives and two members of the 
High Command ("Estado Mayor"), but not with higher-ranking FARC 
Secretariat members.  Pearl said he agreed to the meeting on the 
condition that that FARC not appoint as one of its representatives 
Southern Block Deputy Commander alias Fabian Ramirez, whom the GOC 
considers a major narco-trafficker and criminal.  Pearl said he had 
discussed with the Government of Sweden its facilitation of the 
meeting, including the transportation of the FARC representatives 
to Sweden.  Pearl presumed that the two representatives would be 
among those FARC leaders residing in Venezuela, thus facilitating 
their international travel.  (Note:  The current Swedish Ambassador 
to Colombia did not mention these developments in a February 4 
breakfast with the Ambassador.) 
 
 
 
Humanitarian Release Delayed By Electoral Politics 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Pearl confirmed rumors that the Government of Brazil had 
agreed to facilitate the humanitarian release of Colombian soldiers 
Pablo Moncayo (held by the FARC since December 1997) and Josue 
Calvo (held since April 2009).  The FARC also agreed to deliver the 
remains of Colombian Army major Julian Ernesto Guevara.  Pearl 
discounted reports in December that the FARC had rejected Brazil in 
favor of Argentina.  He pointed out that the message had come from 
former president and left-wing Liberal Party official Ernesto 
Samper.  Pearl theorized that Samper was working on behalf of 
opposition senator Piedad Cordoba, who had been in contact with the 
FARC over the releases.  Catholic Church peace envoy XXXXXXXXXXXX  
complained to us on February 1 that Cordoba had been 
manipulating the release date to place it nearer to the March 14 
congressional elections.  Indeed, Cordoba told the press on 
February 7 that she expected the releases to come at the end of 
February.  XXXXXXXXXXXX lamented that Gustavo Moncayo, hostage 
Moncayo's father and a Polo Democratico candidate for the Senate, 
appeared complicit in this plan.  Pearl said the GOC plans to move 
ahead regardless of dates, though International Commission for the 
Red Cross country director Christophe Beney told us on February 8 
that he fears the GOC will further delay the release so as not to 
give Cordoba and Moncayo free campaign publicity.  Pearl publicly 
echoed complaints of FARC political manipulation in February 10 
remarks to the press, but said the GOC would cooperate with a 
release nonetheless. 
 
ELN Also Accepts Meeting Offer 
 
------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶4. (S/NF) Pearl also reported that his offer for a meeting with the 
ELN had been accepted.  He had yet to confirm a date or location, 
though he expected the meeting would take place in the Colombia. 
He said he was going to Medellin to meet with jailed ELN member 
XXXXXXXXXXXX to discuss details.  As with the FARC, the 
purpose of the meeting is to establish a line of communication that 
could lead to a "roadmap" toward eventual peace talks.  Pearl's 
hope is to have roadmaps on the ELN and FARC ready for the next 
administration when it takes office in August.
