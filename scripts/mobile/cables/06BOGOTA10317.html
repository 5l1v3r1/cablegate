</p><p>¶1. (U)  October 25, 2006; 5:00 pm. 
</p><p>¶2.  (U)  Participants: 
</p><p>U.S. 
</p><p>Under Secretary Nicholas Burns 
Ambassador William Wood 
Assistant Secretary Thomas Shannon 
Assistant Secretary Patterson 
HeideBronke
John Creamer (notetaker) 
</p><p>Colombia 
</p><p>President Alvaro Uribe 
Minster of Defense Juan Manuel Santos 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Maria Consuelo Araujo
Ambassador Carolina Barco 
Presidential Communications Director Jorge Eastman 
</p><p>¶3.  (C)  Summary:  U/S Burns praised Colombia,s progress on 
security, economic development and human rights, and 
reiterated the U.S. commitment to continue substantial 
bilateral aid.  Still, he cautioned that further GOC progress 
on human rights would be needed to maintain U.S. 
congressional support for Plan Colombia.  Uribe welcomed 
Burns, proposal that the GOC and the U.S. produce a Plan 
Colombia Consolidation Plan by early January that would 
outline a joint U.S.-GOC strategy for the next five years. 
He understood congressional concerns on human rights, and 
would work to improve Colombia,s human rights record.  The 
two also discussed the status of the bilateral free trade 
agreement and the Andean Trade Preferences Act, bilateral 
security cooperation, the U.S. hostages held by the FARC, 
counternarcotics programs, and regional issues.  End Summary 
</p><p>¶4.  (C) U/S Burns said his visit followed up President 
Uribe,s September 19 meeting with Secretary Rice.  He 
praisedColombia,s progress on security, economic 
development and human rights, and reiterated the U.S. 
commitment to continue substantial bilateral support.  The 
Administration would request that Congress maintain current 
aid levels over the next two years, seek Congressional 
ratification of the bilateral free trade agreement, and ask 
Congress to extend the Andean Trade Preferences Act for 
Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. He said it is key to 
build on Plan Colombia,s success and noted that he had asked 
A/S Shannon to work with the GOC on a Plan Colombia 
Consolidation Plan.  The document should be completed by 
early January and should lay out a joint U.S.-GOC strategy 
for the next five years.  The Administration and the GOC 
could then present it jointly to the U.S. Congress. 
</p><p>¶5.  (C) U/S Burns said there is strong potential for 
increased bilateral security cooperation.  The U.S. is 
committed to providing Colombia with technological help to 
fight the FARC, and is also interested in deepening our 
security ties through joint exercises, doctrine, training and 
exchanges.  He urged Defense Minister Santos and Foreign 
Minister Araujo to visit Washington to discuss an enhanced 
security relationship.  Burns thanked Uribe for the GOC,s
cooperation in trying to free the three U.S. hostages held by 
the FARC, and urged that they be included in any possible 
humanitarian exchange. 
</p><p>¶6.  (C) U/S Burns said he consistently encourages U.S. 
Congressmen to visit Colombia.  Those that do so are almost 
always impressed by what they see.  Still, he cautioned that 
some members of the U.S. Congress are concerned by what they 
perceive as the GOC,s failure to make more progress on human 
rights*as evidenced by the GOC,s inability to resolve 
outstanding human rights cases such as Mapiripan and San Jose 
delApartado.  Moreover, some members consider the Justice 
and Peace Law to be too lenient and want tough implementation 
against paramilitary leaders.  He said the GOC must address 
these concerns to maintain bipartisan congressional support 
for U.S. assistance to Colombia. 
</p><p>U.S. Congress, the FTA and APTA 
</p><p>¶7.  (C) Uribe welcomed Congressional visits and said Senator 
Harry Reid of Nevada will reportedly visit Colombia in 
December.  He said the GOC hopes the U.S. Congress will 
approve the FTA before yearend.  If it does not, it is 
important for Colombia that Congress act in the first quarter 
of 2007.  He noted that the GOC had made major concessions in 
the FTA negotiations, including beef and intellectual 
property rights.  He had personally explained to the 
Colombian people that these politically difficult concessions 
</p><p>BOGOTA 00010317  002 OF 003 
</p><p></p><p>were necessary to conclude the deal. 
</p><p>¶8.  (C) Uribe said that if the U.S. Congress does not ratify 
the FTA in 2006, an extension of the ATPA is critical to 
avoid&disastrous social consequences8 in Colombia.  Given 
the political instability in the Andes, it would be useful if 
the U.S. granted an extension to all of the current 
beneficiaries, including Ecuador and Bolivia.  U.S. 
announcement of its intention to extend ATPA before the 
November 26 second round of presidential elections in Ecuador 
could help pro-free trade candidate Alvaro Noboa.  Still, he 
cautioned that the U.S. should clarify that any extension 
would only be temporary and would be designed to give the 
countries time to conclude an FTA.  This would create an 
incentive for Ecuador and Bolivia to pursue free trade deals 
with the U.S. while not disadvantaging Colombia or Peru for 
having already done so. 
</p><p>Security Cooperation 
</p><p>¶9. (C) Uribe said the GOC wants to deepen security 
cooperation and welcomed the invitation to send Santos and 
Araujo to Washington to discuss this issue.  Santos said he 
had presented a draft agreement to Defense Secretary Rumsfeld 
at the Defense Ministerial of the Americas in Managua.  The 
GOC hopes this draft would enable the GOC and U.S. to do 
anything that they want in the security area while not 
requiring approval by either country's Congress.  Uribe 
underscored that it is important that any security accord not 
need Congressional ratification. 
</p><p>U.S. Hostages and Humanitarian Accord 
</p><p>10  (C) Uribe said the GOC would insist that the U.S. 
hostages be included in any humanitarian exchange with the 
FARC.  The GOC would consult with the U.S. on any GOC-FARC 
negotiations and would not consider a deal that separated the 
U.S. hostages from the Colombians held by the group.  He 
clarified, however, that at the moment*prompted by the 
October 19 FARC car bomb at the National Military 
University*GOC efforts to start humanitarian talks with the 
FARC are off. 
</p><p>¶11.  (C) Uribe explained that after his election in May, he 
had consciously moderated his rhetoric toward the FARC in an 
attempt to create conditions for talks with the group.  It is 
now clear, however, that the only way to deal with the FARC 
is to defeat them militarily.  He said the three countries 
accompanying the FARC process*Spain, France and 
Switzerland*had urged him to reconsider his decision to 
break off contacts with the group.  He would not do so unless 
the FARC stopped its terrorist attacks.  Uribe stressed that 
his decision to end overtures to the FARC enjoyed popular 
support.  His attempt to reach out to the FARC had 
highlighted the group,s intransigence and &relegitimized8 
his democratic security policy. 
</p><p>¶12.  (C) Uribe said the GOC needs U.S. help to locate the 
U.S. hostages and to mount a rescue attempt.Without U.S.
assistance, a rescue effort would be impossible.  He assured 
U/S Burns that the GOC would not try to rescue the U.S. 
hostages without full coordination with the U.S.  Santos 
confirmed that the standing order to the Colombian military 
is that any operation to rescue the hostages must be "dual 
key." 
</p><p>ELN 
</p><p>¶13. (C) Uribe said there were some advances in the fourth 
round of talks with the ELN.  For the first time, it appears 
the ELN accepts the need to put in place a ceasefire.  He 
noted that his omission of the ELN from his October 20 speech 
suspending efforts to talk to the FARC about a humanitarian 
exchange and calling for the arrest of paramilitary leader 
Vicente Castano was aimed at encouraging the ELN to continue 
peace talks. 
</p><p>Human Rights 
</p><p>¶14.  (C) Uribe said he understood U.S. congressional concerns 
on human rights and the Justice and Peace Law (JPL).  He must 
be prudent in his efforts to advance the resolution of 
individual cases, because he must respect the independence of 
the Prosecutor General,s Office (Fiscalia).  Still, Uribe 
said he calls the Prosecutor General every day to urge 
progress on human rights cases.  Ambassador Barco also works 
directly with the Fiscalia on key cases. 
</p><p>¶15.  (C) Uribe said most of the concerns raised by human 
rights groups regarding the JPL were addressed in the 
implementing decree.  Most key paramilitary leaders are in 
GOC custody: the Prosecutor General will hear the first JPL 
confession of a paramilitary*Salvador Mancuso*within 15 
</p><p>BOGOTA 00010317  003 OF 003 
</p><p></p><p>days.  Uribe said GOC security forces are looking to detain 
those paramilitary leaders, such as Vicente Castano, that are 
still at large.  If the GOC arrests these individuals, they 
will not be eligible for JPL benefits and will be subject to 
extradition. 
</p><p>Counternarcotics
</p><p>¶16.  (C) Uribe said that without clear progress on 
counternarcotics, it would be impossible to sustain political 
support for Plan Colombia.  The GOC and the U.S. need to 
agree on the baseline amount of coca in the country and to 
revise their counternarcotics efforts accordingly.  Santos 
said the GOC and the U.S. will set up a high-level commission 
to look at the coca issue and to report back by December. 
Ambassador Barco urged the group to consider alternative 
measures of success beyond the number of coca hectares 
sprayed.  Uribe asked for U.S support in developing a 
strategy for Colombia,s Pacific Coast, which has seen a 
sharp increase in coca production and terrorist activities. 
A/S Patterson agreed to work with the GOC on this issue. 
</p><p>UNSC Seat 
</p><p>¶17.  (C) Uribe said the GOC is committed to Guatemala, and 
will not lead an effort to identify a compromise candidate. 
The GOC will follow Guatemala,s lead. 
</p><p>Venezuela and Bolivia 
</p><p>18  (C) Uribe said that when he met with Venezuelan President 
Chavez a month ago, Chavez had voiced concern about the 
impact of rising crime on his reelection campaign.  Hence, 
Chavez had asked for GOC cooperation to combat criminal 
activity along the border.  Santos said that in a follow-up 
meeting with his Venezuelan counterpart, the GOV had promised 
to cooperate with the GOC to combat narcotrafficking and 
kidnapping.  Since then, the GOV has handed over two 
importantnarcotraffickers and one mid-level terrorist. 
Still, the GOV has not yet responded to a GOC request that it 
detain a high-value terrorist leader. 
</p><p>19  (C) Asked for the U.S. assessment of the Venezuelan 
presidential elections, A/S Shannon said opposition candidate 
Manuel Rosales is running a smart campaign.  Still, Chavez 
has perfected his control of Venezuela,s electoral 
machinery, and will likely win on December 3.  Chavez, main 
vulnerability is that he must win by a substantial margin to 
maintain his regional mystique.  To achieve this, he may need 
to resort to fraud.  In this context, it is important that 
international observers, such as the OAS and the European 
Union, be present and have adequate mandate. 
</p><p>¶20. (C) Uribe said he was not following events in Bolivia 
closely, and asked for the U.S view.  Shannon said the 
political situation in La Paz is difficult.  Cuban and 
Venezuelan influence is strong, and President Morales has 
made serious political mistakes.  Still, the U.S. continues 
to stress our desire to work with Morales*despite an 
increase in coca production.  Shannon said we hope Brazil 
will take a more active role in Bolivia after the second 
round of Brazilian elections on October 29.
