¶1.  (SBU) Summary. In a courtesy call on February 2, new 
Minister of Government Ana Isabel Morales Mazun told the 
Ambassador that the government intends to honor agreements 
established by the previous administration and to strengthen 
the relationship with the United States.  The Ambassador 
queried Morales on several key topics, including extradition, 
the penal code and trafficking in persons.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador paid a courtesy call on new Minister 
of Government Ana Isabel Morales on February 2.  DCM and 
Poloff (notetaker) attended; Morales included a colleague 
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a notetaker in the 
meeting.  The meeting was cordial and brief and Morales 
called in a photographer to take photos at the end of the 
session. (Comment: Morales remained low-key and rather stiff 
throughout the meeting, only becoming slightly more animated 
when she talked about immigration issues.  End Comment.) 
 
Role of the Ministry 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶3.  (C) Morales clarified in response to a question from the 
Ambassador that the Ministry will maintain the same 
relationship with the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) as in 
the past despite the recent reform of law 290 -- though the 
NNP falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of 
Government, in practice they do not exercise much oversight 
or control, rather, the NNP deals directly with the 
Presidency.  Morales added that the Ministry's budget will 
remains virtually the same as last year with a small increase 
for the NNP. 
 
¶4.  (S) Comment:  In January 2007, Embassy sources reported 
Morales convened a meeting of members of her staff and senior 
members of the NNP.  During the meeting, Morales announced a 
series of measures to reconstitute the ministry as it was in 
the 1980s under the Sandinista regime when it was known as 
the Ministry of Interior.  Morales announced that she would 
be personally taking control of operations and intelligence 
issues for the NNP and that she would directly run all 
operations, chair all meetings, and would be saluted by 
police officers as had been the custom in the 1980s.  As a 
result of the meeting, NNP Chief Aminta Granera sought a 
meeting with Daniel Ortega to discuss Morales' comments.  In 
response, Ortega indicated that he would submit a law to the 
National Assembly to give him control of both the military 
and police.  End Comment. 
 
¶5.  (C) Morales also confirmed that the Ministry should be 
the contact for any issues regarding deportation of U.S. 
fugitives.  The Ambassador added that he would like to 
discuss in the future the broader issue of extradition of 
Nicaraguan citizens, which is prohibited under Nicaraguan 
law.  Morales responded that the Constitution is clear, but 
that they could work harder on trials in Nicaragua for 
citizens who commit a crime in the United States. 
 
¶6.  (C) Morales added that the Ministry will be involved in 
lobbying the National Assembly when debate is resumed on the 
penal code, and may also be involved in developing new money 
laundering and drug trafficking conspiracy legislation. 
Morales told the Ambassador that the unit of the Ministry 
(Inspectoria Civil) that investigates allegations of 
corruption of government officials will continue to operate 
and pursue cases.  Morales also assured the Ambassador of 
continued cooperation on anti-trafficking in persons 
initiatives (TIP) and that the Ministry would provide 
information for the annual TIP report despite personnel 
changes. (Comment:  One of the key Embassy contacts on TIP, 
Maria Gabriela Zuniga, at the Ministry has been told that she 
will be moved to another job; she believes that she may be 
forced to leave.  End Comment). 
 
Immigration issues 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7.  (C) Morales mentioned her personal interest in 
immigration issues, queried the Ambassador about the status 
of immigration legislation in the United States, and 
expressed her interest in attending the Regional Conference 
on Migration in New Orleans, April 14-27.  She also agreed to 
continue information sharing with the Embassy on immigration 
issues and asked the Ambassador to provide further detail on 
the kind of information and cooperation the Embassy desires 
-- which the Ambassador agreed to do.  (Comment:  Information 
 
sharing by the GON on aliens has diminished over the past few 
months.  The Consular section used to enjoy direct access to 
GON immigration databases, but that practice was 
discontinued.  In addition, immigration officials no longer 
pass information regarding visa applicants from countries of 
interest, including the Middle East, as they did in the past. 
 End Comment.) 
 
Biography 
- - - - - 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Ana Isabel Morales Mazun is a former Sandinista 
guerrilla, and is recognized for being the only survivor of 
the massacre of Veracruz.  She was a student leader during 
the Somoza dynasty and was recruited by Carlos Roberto 
Huembes to fight against the regime.  She worked for 19 years 
in the Ministry of the Interior, today known as the Ministry 
of Government, where she was Director and Deputy Director of 
Immigration for almost 15 years.  After working at the 
Ministry of Government, Morales went to work at the Supreme 
Court.  She is a lawyer and public notary and holds a masters

¶9.  (C) Comment:  Post has information that in 1997 and 1998 
Morales was involved in providing false Nicaraguan documents 
to illegal aliens transiting Nicaragua enroute to the United 
States.  On at least six occasions, Morales was reported as 
linked to illegal alien trafficking.  On at least one 
occasion, Morales coordinated with other immigration 
officials to facilitate the provision of false documents to 
illegal aliens.  End Comment.
