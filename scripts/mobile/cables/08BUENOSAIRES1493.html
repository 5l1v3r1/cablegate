Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) The Argentine Central Bank (BCRA) is taking the lead 
on preparing briefing material for President Cristina 
Fernandez de Kirchner's (CFK) participation in the November 
15 G-20 meeting, BCRA President Redrado told Ambassador 
October 24.  While not in a position to guarantee how CFK 
will use the BCRA input, Redrado stressed that the BCRA was 
recommending constructive positions.  Separately, Finance 
Secretary Hernan Lorenzino confirmed that he is coordinating 
with the BCRA on position papers, but must focus on dealing 
with the worsening internal financial crisis in Argentina, so 
Political Economy Secretary Martin Abeles will likely be 
Sous-Sherpa for the Economy Ministry.  The GoA is also 
seeking to coordinate positions with Brazil, to be discussed 
further during the November 8-9 Mercosur summit.  Cabinet 
Chief Sergio Massa told a U.S. citizen visitor that he had 
urged CFK to treat the G-20 meeting as a very special 
opportunity to demonstrate constructive leadership and to do 
so in the context of still seeking to pursue solutions with 
the Paris Club and private bondholders over Argentine debt. 
 
¶2. (C) Regarding the IMF's proposal at the recent G-20 
meeting to offer currency swaps for countries in distress, 
Redrado noted that he had pushed for no or limited conditions 
for the first tranche of currency swaps to emerging market 
economies, after which the IMF can ratchet up required 
preconditions.  However, IMF Managing Director Strauss-Kahn 
announced October 29 that Argentina does not qualify for the 
program.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
BCRA Preparations for G-20 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Ambassador Wayne met October 24 with BCRA President 
Redrado to discuss the upcoming G-20 meeting, the GoA's 
recent announcement that it would nationalize the private 
pension system, and the resulting implosion of Argentina's 
financial market (the latter two reported Ref A).  Because 
the Economy Ministry has been decimated by frequent personnel 
changes over the last year, Redrado said, the BCRA has been 
tasked with the lead on preparing paper for CFK's 
participation in the November 15 G-20 meeting.  To this end, 
BCRA Vice President Miguel Angel Pesce has worked closely 
with the Economy Ministry's Finance Secretary, Hernan 
Lorenzino, to coordinate the work. 
 
¶4. (C) While he could not guarantee that the President would 
rely on the BCRA's input during the November 15 meeting, 
Redrado reassured Ambassador that the BCRA and Economy 
Ministry papers will take reasonable positions.  Redrado said 
the Embassy should consider him as a conduit to the President 
on G-20 related issues, and emphasized the importance of the 
G-20 to Argentina, since it is the only important forum that 
accepts Argentina as a member. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Economy Ministry G-20 Coordination 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) EconCouns called Finance Secretary Lorenzino October 
29 to brief him on G-20 logistics and alert him that the 
Summit communiqu/statement will be negotiated in advance 
using both a capital-to-capital Sherpa channel and a Finance 
Ministry deputy channel. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Lorenzino confirmed that his Finance Secretariat has 
been coordinating position papers with the BCRA.  However, 
while he would normally be the appropriate Finance Ministry 
Deputy channel, he said he is ""being pulled in 20 different 
directions"" by the impact of the global financial crisis, and 
specifically by domestic financial and currency market 
responses to the GoA's bid to nationalize the private pension 
funds.  As a result, Political Economy Secretary Martin 
Abeles will likely assume the role of Sous-Sherpa during the 
run-up to the G-20. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The seventh Extraordinary Meeting of the Mercosur 
 
BUENOS AIR 00001493  002 OF 003 
 
 
Council was October 27, and Lorenzino said that the GoA 
presented a working paper to urge the Brazilians to explore a 
coordinated approach to the G-20.  Lorenzino anticipates that 
further coordination and discussion will not take place 
during the October 30 Ibero)American summit in Sao Paulo, 
but rather during the November 8-9 Mercosur head of state 
summit in Sao Paulo.  Lorenzino emphasized the obligation of 
Brazil and Argentina to ""represent"" the greater interests of 
other Latin American countries not sitting at the G-20 table. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Redrado Take On IMF's New Short-Term Liquidity Facility 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶8. (C) Redrado mentioned that he had spoken on October 24 to 
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn to urge him to 
consider limiting preconditions necessary to gain access to 
the IMF's planned liquidity facility (which the Strauss-Kahn 
announced formally October 29).  Redrado said he had been one 
of the first to propose IMF currency swaps (during an earlier 
G-20 meeting), and at the time he had argued that many 
countries with solid macroeconomic policies, but also with 
current account deficits, were facing speculative attacks on 
their currencies.  However, he was concerned that the IMF was 
going to set the criteria for access to such a facility so 
tight (e.g., no recent borrowing, a current Article IV) that 
only a few countries from Latin America would qualify. 
(Redrado mentioned Chile as an example.)  He said that during 
his conversation with Strauss-Kahn he had pushed for not 
attaching conditions to the first three-month tranche of 
currency swaps to emerging market economies, after which the 
IMF could begin to apply stricter preconditions for access to 
the lending facility. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Strauss-Kahn announced the IMF's new Short-Term 
Liquidity Facility October 29, stating that it will offer 
quick-disbursing financing for ""countries with strong 
economic policies that are facing temporary liquidity 
problems in the global capital markets.""  According to the 
IMF's release, the IMF does not seem to have accepted all of 
Redrado's recommendations, because the facility will use 
employ conditionality as part of the prequalification for 
access to the facility, listing as eligible recipients 
""countries with track records of sound policies, access to 
capital markets and sustainable debt burdens.  Policies 
should have been assessed very positively by the IMF in its 
most recent Article IV discussions.""  During Strauss-Kahn's 
press conference, he said the facility would be limited to a 
discrete and small group.  Moreover, in response to a 
reporter's follow-up question on Argentina, he clarified that 
Argentina would not qualify for the program.  (Comment: This 
disqualification is due at least in part to Argentina's delay 
of Article IV discussions for well over a year.  Argentina 
was the only unqualified country that Strauss-Kahn mentioned 
by name.) 
 
-------------------------------- 
CFK and Cabinet Minister on G-20 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (C) On October 29, a prominent U.S. citizen recounted to 
the Ambassador her conversations with President CFK and 
Cabinet Chief Sergio Massa on October 28 and 29, 
respectively.  The U.S. citizen, who has a long relationship 
with CFK, said the President was honored and enthused with 
the invitation to the November 15 gathering.  CFK said she 
had communicated with Brazilian President Lula da Silva and 
the two intended to coordinate closely on positions for the 
meeting.  The U.S. citizen commented that this was good news 
as it would presumably keep CFK to more responsible 
positions.  CFK also said she still intended to proceed with 
efforts to solve Argentina's debts to Paris Club creditors 
and to private (""Holdout"") bondholders, when the 
international situation permits.  Separately, Massa told the 
U.S. citizen that he had spent a good deal of time arguing to 
CFK that the November 15 summit was a very special 
opportunity to build confidence among other leaders and to 
prepare the ground for future resolution of Argentina's debt 
issues and develop new economic ties in the future.  Massa 
also confirmed to the U.S. citizen CFK's commitment to 
resolve Paris Club and Holdout issues.

¶11. (C) Post will touch base with Secretary Martin Abeles and 
BCRA VP Pesce regularly in coming days to get a better sense 
of how the GoA plans to approach the next few weeks of 
regional and international financial crisis response 
coordination discussions, with a view to reducing the 
likelihood of Argentine bomb-throwing during the G-20.
