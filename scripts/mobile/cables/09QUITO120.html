SUBJECT: LEGISLATIVE HEAD CORDERO OPEN TO U.S. COOPERATION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Heather Hodges for reason 1.4 (D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  In his first meeting with the Ambassador 
and visiting WHA/AND Director, Legislative Commission 
President Cordero recognized that a democratic system 
requires an independent legislative branch.  Cordero appeared 
interested in maintaining a constructive relationship with 
the U.S., including assistance in training new National 
Assembly members.  He explained that the international 
relations commission handles only legislative exchanges, not 
foreign policy substance.  End Summary. 
 
RELIANCE ON EXECUTIVE'S LEGISLATIVE DRAFTS 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Meeting with the Ambassador and WHA/AND Director 
Kevin Whitaker February 3, Legislative and Oversight 
Commission President Fernando Cordero acknowledged that the 
Executive drafted all of the laws the Commission was 
considering, but insisted that the Commission made 
significant changes to improve them further.  Often called 
the "Congresillo," the Legislative Commission is composed of 
76 of the 130 members of the former Constituent Assembly. 
The Commission is serving as Ecuador's interim legislature 
under the transition rules in the new constitution, which 
took effect October 20, 2008.  A National Assembly, to be 
elected on April 26, will replace the Commission.  Cordero is 
at the top of PAIS's National Assembly party list for seats 
elected nationwide, and many commentators expect him to 
preside over the new National Assembly as he has over the 
Legislative Commission. 
 
¶3.  (C) Cordero recognized the importance of the legislature 
to a democratic system of checks and balances.  He expected 
the new National Assembly to be capable of drafting its own 
legislation rather than depending on the Executive to propose 
it.  Cordero opined that the Ecuadorian people would not 
accept a situation where the National Assembly was controlled 
by the Executive.  He admitted that the only oversight 
activity the Legislative Commission was carrying out was that 
of Patriotic Society Party member Galo Lara, directed against 
the Minister of Public Works, which Cordero discounted.  He 
said it would be important for the new National Assembly to 
have an oversight role. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Cordero described the legislature's right, not 
enjoyed under the previous constitution, to carry out public 
trials (juicio politico) and force cabinet ministers from 
office.  He said the Legislative Commission's regulations 
initially required cabinet ministers to respond to a 
legislator's information request in five days, but the 
Commission decided this was unreasonable and extended it to 
10 weekdays. 
 
CONGRESILLO WORKING AT FRENETIC PACE 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Cordero described the challenge the Legislative 
Commission faced in trying to pass five fundamental laws 
within its first 120 days, as the constitution required. 
Briefly updating us on their status, he said the law 
governing the judiciary was already approved.  The second 
debate on the electoral law was planned for that week, and 
the first debate on the food sovereignty law the next week. 
The citizen participation law would be put off past the 
120-day deadline due to delays in appointing members of the 
interim Citizen Participation and Social Control branch of 
government, which was charged with drafting that law.  In 
addition to the five required laws, Cordero highlighted the 
Commission's passage of mining and financial security laws. 
 
¶6.  (C) Cordero offered a surprising description of the 
International Relations Commission as a body that sought 
legislative exchanges with other countries.  When asked about 
its role on foreign policy, Cordero called such matters the 
prerogative of the Executive.  Despite ceding all foreign 
policy authority to the Executive, he expressed his view on 
an international matter, namely that it was important Ecuador 
and Colombia improve their relationship as neighbors and 
brothers. 
 
ELECTIONS AHEAD 
 
¶7.  (C) Cordero described the Proud and Sovereign Fatherland 
(PAIS) movement's January 25 primaries as a democratic 
exercise, claiming that many citizens had voted.  He 
expressed confidence that PAIS would win a strong majority on 
April 26.  Cordero recognized the need for an opposition, 
which he said should be intelligent and engaged (implying the 
current opposition members did not meet these criteria). 
 
¶8.  (SBU) According to Cordero, only 23 of the 80 PAIS 
members in the former Constituent Assembly would be running 
for the National Assembly.  The Ambassador asked about 
training for new Assembly members to prepare them to work 
effectively.  Cordero said he was aware of this need and he 
was talking to international donors, including USAID. 
 
COMMENT: LIP SERVICE TO INDEPENDENT LEGISLATURE? 
 
¶9.  (C) Cordero's stated belief in an independent legislature 
does not mesh with his subservience to date to President 
Correa's wishes.  Clearly Correa dominates the political 
scene, limiting Cordero's room for manuever.  So far Cordero 
has been the loyal foot soldier following the general's 
(Correa's) orders.  Nonetheless, it is possible that Cordero 
will stake out a somewhat more independent position after the 
April elections.
