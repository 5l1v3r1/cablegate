  		<h1>MINISTERIAL DELEGATIONS TO WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY CONFERENCE REF: A) STATE 138248, B) GODFREY-LAWSON E-MAIL 11/21/2007 Per reftel, Post requests that Libya be added to the list of invitees for the March 2008 Washington International Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC). The GOL has demonstrated keen interest in developing its renewable energy sector and could represent a sizeable market for renewable technologies in the future. In addition, scientific engagement and cooperation have constituted an important component of the re-establishment of formal U.S.-Libyan diplomatic ties; participation by the GOL in the WIREC 2008 event would represent another significant step in the re-establishment of regular government-to-government ties outside the strictly political sphere.
