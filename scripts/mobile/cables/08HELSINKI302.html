 ¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered demarche Shaping Post-Cyclone 
Assistance in Burma to Theresa Zitting, First Secretary, Asia 
and Oceania on July 2 who stated that Finland agrees with USG 
points on Burma:  GoF condemns political prisoners, condemns 
that they are still under house arrest, is concerned with 
Burma's attitude toward humanitarian assistance, is and is 
concerned with Burma's roadmap and next steps because they 
don't take minorities and opposition into consideration. 
 
¶2. (C) During the demarche, Zitting shared her impressions of 
a seminar held in Helsinki for Burmese opposition in exile, 
which she attended on June 9 and 10.  About 50 people, mostly 
from European countries, attended the seminar, though two 
people from Burma's opposition traveled to Helsinki under 
false names in order to participate.  She mentioned that 
Madame Nyny, (protect name) a representative from the Asian 
Institute of Technology, is allowed to travel, attended and 
put forth an idea for courses on strengthening NGOs and civil 
society. Preceding the Helsinki seminar, only the Burmese 
opposition attendees met June 7 and 8.  They are hoping to 
find a common vision on how to go forward through  a series 
of forums and meetings.  Zitting observed that most of the 
opposition would take a more pragmatic approach to dealing 
with the junta than is currently favored by Aung San Suu Kyi, 
but they are currently not in full agreement as a group. 
Independent Diplomat is working on a future meeting and the 
Finnish MFA is looking for financing opportunities to empower 
and coordinate.  Zitting expects a complete report on the 
Burmese seminar by the end of this month and will brief 
PolOff further.
