¶1. (C) In discussions November 1 regarding political tensions in Fiji 
with Heather Riddell, Director of Pacific Division at Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), Post learned that GNZ will shortly 
be issuing a formal statement declaring that Fiji's military 
commander Bainimarama is obliged to abide by his constitutional 
obligations to the democratically elected government of Fiji. 
 
¶2. (C) The Chief of New Zealand's Defense Force will also be calling 
Bainimarama directly and exhorting him not to take any action which 
would undermine the Fijian constitution.  The New Zealand High 
Commissioner in Suva will also be calling on Fiji's Vice President to 
express support for the government and relay the warning they have 
expressed to Commander Bainimarama.  MFAT is reviewing their travel 
advisory for New Zealanders in Fiji to take into account possible 
emergency action procedures. 
 
¶3. (C) New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters separately told 
the Ambassador that the New Zealand Government had concluded that 
many Fijians shared Bainimarama's frustration with the amnesty for 
those involved in the previous coup.  Nonetheless, his actions were 
completely contrary to acceptable democratic practice and must be 
stopped.  GNZ had decided that the Chief of Defense Force would be 
the one to call Bainimarama because he would be far more likely to 
listen seriously to a military colleague than a foreign government 
official.  Peters added that New Zealand and Australia are absolutely 
of one mind in their approach to Fiji.
