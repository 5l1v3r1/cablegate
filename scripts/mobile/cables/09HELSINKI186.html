¶1. (U) Econoff and Poloff discussed Finland's Cuba relations 
with Kimmo Pulkkinen, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MFA) 
Ambassador for the Unit for Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Post provides the following responses to reftel A questions: 
 
¶2. (C) -- Has the host country, in Post's opinion, worked to 
promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in Cuba? 
 
Pulkkinen reinforced the Government of Finland's (GOF) 
interest in the advancement of democracy and human rights in 
Cuba via their EU relationship with Cuba.  The GOF supports 
common EU positions and statements on human rights and 
democracy in Cuba. Pulkkinen noted that the current EU 
position is conditional with a one-year review and that the 
EU,s current position is unified only on 'concept'.  He 
remarked that a troika meeting with Havana last week produced 
a 'null' result. 
 
-- Has the host country made public statements or undertaken 
other governmental actions, such as resolutions in the 
national assemblies condemning human rights abuses in Cuba; 
or actions in support of civil society in Cuba through host 
country's diplomatic missions or other fora? 
 
The GOF works in concert with the EU on Cuban human rights 
and civil society issues. Pulkkinen referred to the human 
rights situation as regrettable, particularly noting the 
limited release of political prisoners and the requirement 
that they then leave the country. 
 
-- Have there been any high-level diplomatic visits between 
Cuba and the host country in the past six months? 
 
A Cuban director-general level delegation visited Finland on 
their own initiative in September 2008.  Pulkkinen said that 
most bilateral interaction has been informal and between 
parliamentary delegations. 
 
-- What is the nature of investments (and names, if known) 
that host country businesses have in Cuba? 
 
Pulkkinen stated that Finnish businesses have few if any 
investments in Cuba. 
 
-- Are there any bilateral trade agreements or other 
cooperative agreements between host country and Cuba? 
 
The GOF does not have bilateral trade agreements with Cuba, 
but works through the EU delegation on trade and cooperation 
issues. 
 
Are there any exchange programs between host country and 
Cuba, including but not limited to: scholarships for host 
country nationals to study in Cuba; Cuban-paid medical travel 
for host country nationals; and Cuban doctors working in host 
country? 
 
-- Pulkkinen stated that there were no significant MFA-funded 
exchange programs.  Generally, Cubans in Finland are in 
Finland as a result of economic or family-based immigration 
and not as part of a Cuban or GOF-funded program.   Pulkkinen 
promised to follow up with further information on any GOF 
Ministry of Education programs. Havana produced statistics on 
doctors but Pulkkinen questioned the statistical context.
