</p><p> 
</p><p>¶1. (C) Summary: Argentine Gendarmeria (Border Patrol) 
</p><p>Commanding General Hector Schenone called on the Ambassador 
</p><p>March 4 at his request to introduce a new staff officer and 
</p><p>to review cooperation with the USG on key issues.  Schenone 
</p><p>described the Gendarmeria's efforts to address increasing 
</p><p>pressure from drug traffickers and to enhance the 
</p><p>Gendarmeria's capacity to fight international crime.  He 
</p><p>shared his interest in obtaining a number of military 
</p><p>transport helicopters to assist GOA efforts to interdict drug 
</p><p>traffickers in remote northern parts of the country and 
</p><p>requested USG help in establishing an inter-agency 
</p><p>counter-drug training center outside Buenos Aires and/or 
</p><p>supporting construction of a permanent home for the Northern 
</p><p>Border Task Force (NBTF) in Salta.  Ambassador described USG 
</p><p>interest in supporting regional efforts to improve public 
</p><p>security and commended the Gendarmeria for recent actions 
</p><p>against drug and human trafficking.  End Summary. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (U) Long-serving Gendarmeria Commanding General Hector 
</p><p>Bernabe Schenone called March 4 on the Ambassador, ostensibly 
</p><p>to introduce Principal Commander Claudio Larraburu, whom 
</p><p>Schenone has entrusted with managing relations with the U.S. 
</p><p>Embassy in counter drug affairs.   Ambassador was accompanied 
</p><p>by Military Group Commander, DEA Special Agent, and Pol-Mil 
</p><p>Officer (notetaker). 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (U) Ambassador voiced appreciation for recent successful 
</p><p>operations by the Gendarmeria against drug traffickers and 
</p><p>trafficking in persons (TIP) and noted the deep and 
</p><p>successful training relationship between the DEA and Embassy 
</p><p>Military Group and Gendarmeria counterparts.  The Ambassador 
</p><p>observed that public security is a sub-theme at the upcoming 
</p><p>Summit of the Americas and an issue that the USG perceives as 
</p><p>important for the region.  He described the Merida Initiative 
</p><p>with Mexico and underscored our recognition that countries in 
</p><p>the region needed assistance in responding to drug 
</p><p>trafficking and other manifestations of international crime. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (U) The Ambassador also noted that, although Argentina's 
</p><p>challenges on its northern and eastern borders were of a 
</p><p>different nature and scale than those faced by Mexico, some 
</p><p>aspects were similar, particularly the need for regional 
</p><p>cooperation and coordination.  In that regard, the Ambassador 
</p><p>shared our appreciation that the Gendarmeria's sister law 
</p><p>enforcement agency, the Federal Police (PFA), had agreed to 
</p><p>take over from Bolivia management of the regional Centers for 
</p><p>Drug Information (CDI) network, supported by DEA. Ambassador 
</p><p>mentioned an April 27-May 1 conference in Salta on the CDI 
</p><p>and encouraged the Gendarmeria to be represented.  (Note: the 
</p><p>conference is supported by DEA and State INCLE funds.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Request for Helos, a Building in Salta, and Training 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) Schenone thanked the Ambassador for his recognition of 
</p><p>the Gendarmeria's work and of the challenges Argentina faced. 
</p><p> He said his forces had seized over 800 kilos of cocaine in 
</p><p>February alone; Argentina clearly was facing new pressure by 
</p><p>traffickers operating through Bolivia.  He noted that the 
</p><p>Gendarmeria continued to have two officers present in La Paz 
</p><p>and that on the professional level the organization was still 
</p><p>working well with Bolivian counterparts.  Still, Schenone 
</p><p>said that Argentina considered Bolivia a cocaine producing 
</p><p>country, not just a trafficking country as the Government 
</p><p>there would contend. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (SBU) General Schenone said that the U.S. ""military"" 
</p><p>training received by the Gendarmeria was highly valuable to 
</p><p>the missions it was performing and included in this recent 
</p><p>visits by Gendarmeria officers to the Jungle Training Course 
</p><p>in Colombia.  He said that his civilian boss, Minister of 
</p><p>Justice and Security Anibal Fernandez, was fully supportive 
</p><p>of enhanced collaboration with the USG. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C) Schenone added that the Gendarmeria perceived a strong 
</p><p>need to obtain air mobility in its fight against drug 
</p><p>traffickers crossing the northern frontiers from Bolivia and 
</p><p>Paraguay and landing at remote sites in Santa Fe, Santiago 
</p><p>del Estero, and Chaco provinces.  He had in mind Bell UH1Hs, 
</p><p>which would give his forces the capacity to put men on the 
</p><p>ground at landing sites detected by radar or fixed wing 
</p><p>aircraft.  He said that Minister Fernandez fully supported 
</p><p>the proposal (without going into details about a procurement 
</p><p>process or funding).  Schenone said his forces had six 
</p><p>Eurocopters (Cougar) (and several smaller ""Pumas"") but not 
</p><p>the versatility and capacity that Hueys could provide. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (C) Schenone said that the Eastern Border Task Force 
</p><p>(EBTF) in Misiones Province needed a new effort by the 
</p><p>government to ramp up its program and interdiction efforts. 
</p><p>He also described a need to build a dedicated counter-drug 
</p><p>trafficking training center outside of Buenos Aires.  He said 
</p><p>that U.S. support for such an effort would be welcomed.  In 
</p><p>addition, he said, the Gendarmeria had land available in 
</p><p>Salta that could support a permanent GOA-owned headquarters 
</p><p>for the Northern Border Task Force (NBTF) if the USG could 
</p><p>provide assistance. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (SBU) Comment: Hueys would give the Gendarmeria an ability 
</p><p>it does not presently have to insert itself on the ground 
</p><p>more quickly at remote, clandestine landing strips.  Given 
</p><p>the complex coordination (and additional radar coverage) 
</p><p>needed to make such operations successful, this capacity 
</p><p>might have limited real benefits, but it would change 
</p><p>somewhat the calculation of risks that traffickers would need 
</p><p>to consider.  If coordinated effectively with ground 
</p><p>operations, it might lead to some seizures and arrests. 
</p><p>Embassy will continue to gather details on how Gendarmeria 
</p><p>might utilize such assets. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (SBU) Embassy sees utility in contributing on a 
</p><p>cost-sharing basis towards construction of a permanent home 
</p><p>for the NBTF.  Currently the task force is housed in rented 
</p><p>property funded by INCLE.
