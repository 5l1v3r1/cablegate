</p><p>2.(C) Al Miraj told Econoff October 29 that the Embassy non-paper had arrived contemporaneously with news reports regarding the designations. These designations were consistent with his expectations based on prior conversations with Emboffs and U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Stuart Levy. The CBB had already begun to scrutinize transactions involving Iranian entities more than ever and had encouraged financial institutions operating in Bahrain to do the same. Al Miraj also said he believed the Central Bank of Iran did not currently maintain any accounts in Bahrain. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI</p>
