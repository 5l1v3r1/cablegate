¶1.  (U)  This is an action message.  See paragraph 
eight. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF)  SUMMARY:  Since 2006, U.S. Special Forces 
Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) has been engaged in 
equipping and training Paraguay's Joint Special Forces 
Unit (BCFE) with the implicit support of the government 
of Paraguay (including pursuant to Section 1208 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for FY05, as 
amended).  Although the Lugo administration in Paraguay 
has expressed interest in strengthening our mil/mil 
relationship in the long term, the GOP wants to put 
further assistance from the Special Forces ODA on hold 
at the conclusion of the training in September. 
 
According to Special Operations Component, U.S. Southern 
Command (SOCSOUTH), key mission objectives have been 
accomplished to the extent possible, and USSOUTHCOM 
plans to terminate this phase of the effort at the end 
of the fiscal year.  By mutual agreement between the USG 
and the GOP, the members of the U.S. Special Forces ODA 
unit engaged in training and equipping the BCFE will 
depart Paraguay at the end of September, when the 
training of the BCFE ends.  Two Special Operations 
Command, Forward (SOCFWD) personnel will remain in 
Paraguay to monitor the transition of Section 1208- 
funded equipment to the GOP.  SOCSOUTH plans to deploy a 
short-term TDY 12-person ODA team in the third quarter 
of FY2010 to evaluate the consolidation of the BCFE and 
reinforce its capabilities.  The Department recognizes 
the need to move forward to plan  this deployment, but 
requests post consult with the Department closer to the 
actual deployment date before granting final country 
clearance.  DoD is aware of the Department's concerns 
and will consult with us as we get closer to the event 
regarding the feasibility of a deployment in the third 
quarter of FY10.  Upon receipt of additional, detailed 
guidance, Post should be prepared to initiate 
discussions with the GOP to obtain written legal 
protection from the GOP for U.S. forces for any future 
activity.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
STATUS OF U.S. FORCES IN PARAGUAY 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (S/NF)  Since 2006, the U.S. government has invested 
significant resources to help establish, train, and 
equip 
Paraguay's new rapid reaction force (BCFE); has 
supported the creation of a Paraguayan-flagged 
peacekeeping unit under the Global Peace Operations 
Initiative; and has implemented well-received 
humanitarian assistance projects. We understand from 
post that there are currently 21 long-term TDY DOD staff 
positions in Paraguay that are not covered under 
diplomatic or administrative and technical staff status, 
including the six-member Special Forces ODA working with 
the BCFE, a four-person MIST team, a six-person civil- 
military support element (CMSE) for humanitarian 
projects, and five Special Operations Command Forward 
Headquarters (SOCFWD-HQ) staff.  Six members of the ODA 
team and three members of the SOCFWD-HQ are scheduled to 
depart Paraguay by the end of September.  SOCSOUTH plans 
to deploy a 12-person ODA team in the third quarter of 
FY2010 for a short-term TDY to provide follow-up 
training and evaluation of the BCFE. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
GOP POSITION ON US MILITARY COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (S/NF)  Ambassador Ayalde has repeatedly sought 
clarification from the new GOP administration regarding 
its position on U.S. military cooperation in Paraguay. 
President Lugo has expressed support for 
strengthening the relationship and values the 
operational capacity of the newly trained BCFE. 
Nonetheless, the GOP has been reluctant to provide a 
written request for assistance or to provide in writing 
status protections for U.S. military personnel not 
accredited to the Embassy.  In a June 30 meeting between 
the Ambassador and Lugo, President Lugo noted that the 
Minister of Defense had objections to U.S. military 
cooperation.  Lugo said he would meet with the MOD and 
others and promised to provide greater clarity on the 
GOP's intentions (REF B: ASUNCION 418). 
 
¶5.  (S/NF)  On July 7, 2009, the Foreign Minister 
requested a meeting with the Charge to inform him of the 
GOP's decision to suspend any subsequent USG assistance 
to the BCFE at the end of the current training in 
September (REF A: ASUNCION 426). The Foreign Minister 
said the GOP is interested in deepening our mil-mil 
relationship, but that it needed a break ("un pequeno 
descanso") to mark a shift from the past administration. 
In the meeting, the Foreign Minister said the continued 
presence of significant numbers of U.S. security forces 
in Paraguay without the explicit and public agreement of 
the GOP is a potential political liability for both the 
United States and the GOP.  Nevertheless, he stated that 
other Special Operations units currently in Paraguay - a 
civil-military support element, a MIST team, and the 
SOCFWD-PY headquarters team working out of the Embassy - 
are welcome to stay.  By mutual agreement between the 
USG and the GOP, the members of the U.S. Special Forces 
ODA unit engaged in training and equipping the BCFE will 
depart Paraguay in September at the conclusion of the 
training.  The Foreign Minister also said that President 
Lugo intends to conclude a "security cooperation 
agreement" with the USG before the end of the year. 
Such an agreement, he said, would cover the entire range 
of engagements and cooperation between the two 
militaries.  We note, however, this is not the first 
such commitment the GOP has made, and the GOP, to date, 
has not provided any details on what it proposes.  Also, 
there has been no authority granted pursuant to Circular 
175 procedures to negotiate such an agreement on behalf 
of the United States. 
 
----------------- 
POLITICAL CONTEXT 
----------------- 
¶6.  (S/NF)  One year into office, President Lugo is 
confronted by the reality of governing with a fractured 
ruling coalition, an antagonistic Congress, and 
entrenched systemic corruption.  Lugo has proven 
resilient, and thus far has weathered deliberate 
destabilization efforts that included a wave of small 
explosive devices and bomb threats in Asuncion. 
Nevertheless, rumors of coup-plotting persist along with 
a continual erosion of Lugo's political capital. Given 
the current environment and the absence of written 
status protections for all DoD personnel in Paraguay, 
their presence poses a potential political risk.  At any 
point, those who oppose Lugo or merely wish to weaken 
his ties to the United States may publicly raise the 
issue of U.S. forces in Paraguay and speculate about 
their role in a way that undercuts U.S. interests.  In 
addition, there is a potential personal risk to U.S. 
forces on training missions in Paraguay without the 
benefit of status protections or equivalent. 
 
----------------- 
REGIONAL CONCERNS 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (S/NF)  Recent reaction to the proposed U.S. 
military presence in Colombia, as well as previous 
concerns about the U.S. Fourth Fleet and false rumors 
about U.S. military bases in Paraguay, underscore the 
need to evaluate not only the bilateral implications of 
our military relationship with Paraguay, but the 
regional context as well.  The SOCSOUTH engagement in 
Paraguay over the past few years has successfully 
increased the GOP capacity to respond to threats, 
particularly those related to the Tri-Border area. 
Although it is important to continue to work with 
Paraguay and maintain the successful relationships that 
have been built, regional political sensibilities must 
be considered as we look to the future of our military 
engagement with Paraguay.  The long-term presence of 
significant numbers of U.S. Special Forces in Paraguay 
could engender negative regional reactions that would 
undermine regional policy objectives.  Continued 
dialogue between the Department of State and Department 
of Defense on how we engage the Lugo administration on 
military cooperation is critical to striking the right 
balance. 
 
-------------- 
ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
 
¶8.  (S/NF)  The Department of State understands the 
remaining members of the SOCFWD-PY ODA training team 
will depart post by September 30, 2009.  In addition, 
the Department of State is aware SOCSOUTH tentatively 
plans to deploy a 12-person ODA team in the third 
quarter of FY2010 for a short-term TDY to provide 
follow-up training and evaluation of the BCFE.  The 
Department of State recognizes the need for SOCSOUTH to 
plan for this deployment in advance. 
 
¶9.  (S/NF)  There are clear advantages for moving 
forward with the deployment if the risks are not too 
great.  But there is some risk that in the current 
political environment in which the presence of U.S. 
forces in Colombia is being publicly criticized by some 
governments, disclosure by a third country government of 
the presence of U.S. forces along with misinformation or 
mischaracterization could damage our future ability to 
engage in mil-mil cooperation with Paraguay or with 
others in the region.  Due to the aforementioned USG and 
GOP concerns and the importance of evaluating the 
regional political situation closer to the time of 
actual deployment, the Department of State requests post 
consult with the Department prior to granting country 
clearance to this and future ODA deployments.  Country 
clearance should be considered as close to the actual 
deployment date as possible, but no less than two months 
prior to the deployment.  The Department of State also 
strongly encourages post to make the GOP aware of the 
need for written status-of-forces protections for future 
deployments of DoD personnel and to begin preparing the 
GOP for eventual discussions regarding a status-of- 
forces agreement, once the regional situation lends 
itself to such an agreement, and once authority to 
negotiate such an agreement on behalf of the United 
States is granted pursuant to Circular 175 procedures. 
Post should note that such status protection agreements 
may involve several months of work both within the 
interagency and with the host nation, and should begin 
working with USSOUTHCOM approximately six months in 
advance of the proposed deployment to ensure necessary 
protections can be obtained.
