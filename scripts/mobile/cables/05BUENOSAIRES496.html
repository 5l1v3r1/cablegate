</p><p>¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Gutierrez traveled to the 
</p><p>northern province of Salta February 24-25 to meet with 
</p><p>Governor Romero, to review the current state of 
</p><p>U.S.-Argentine counternarcotics cooperation on the northern 
</p><p>border, and to exchange views with leading business 
</p><p>executives in the province.  Governor Romero expressed his 
</p><p>appreciation for the visit and his recognition of the 
</p><p>importance of cooperation between the U.S. and Argentina. 
</p><p>Romero said he admires the U.S. and supports the FTAA.  He 
</p><p>also  highlighted to the Ambassador the province's good 
</p><p>record of fiscal responsibility and impressive economic 
</p><p>growth rates in the past few years.  The Ambassador toured 
</p><p>the Northern Border Task Force (NBTF) headquarters and was 
</p><p>briefed by NBTF and Gendarmeria commanders.  The commanders 
</p><p>were proud of the recent seizure of 149 kilos of cocaine in 
</p><p>Salta by the two forces.  They expressed their gratitude for 
</p><p>the critical support that the U.S. provides the NBTF and 
</p><p>Gendarmeria.  The Ambassador was the guest of honor at a 
</p><p>meeting of leading business executives that produced a useful 
</p><p>exchange of ideas on U.S. policy.  The Ambassador also met 
</p><p>with Salta mayor Miguel Angel Isa who stressed the economic 
</p><p>boom the city is experiencing, fueled by the tourism and 
</p><p>construction sectors.  END SUMMARY. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------------- 
</p><p>Positive Meeting With Governor Romero 
</p><p>------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (C) The Ambassador was received by Governor Juan Carlos 
</p><p>Romero for dinner at his home on February 24.  In the 
</p><p>conversation with the Ambassador, Governor Romero highlighted 
</p><p>Salta's continued economic growth, led by the tourism and 
</p><p>agriculture sectors.  Romero also pointed to the province's 
</p><p>strong record of fiscal responsibility.  Romero was 
</p><p>justifiably proud that the province never defaulted on their 
</p><p>debt when so many of their neighbors did in the past few 
</p><p>years.  ""We have not signed the (Federal) Fiscal 
</p><p>Responsibility Law because ours (provincial) is much better."" 
</p><p> Romero felt that co-participation reform was unlikely to 
</p><p>happen in the foreseeable future, even after the debt issue 
</p><p>was resolved and the elections completed. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (C) When asked about his relations with Kirchner, Governor 
</p><p>Romero described the relations as cordial.  Romero did not 
</p><p>think Kirchner would try to run his own candidates in Salta 
</p><p>in the October 2005 legislative elections, as ""he (Kirchner) 
</p><p>does not have much of a following here.""  He did allude to 
</p><p>his fears that ""many local officeholders (who had backed 
</p><p>Menem in the 2003 elections) could be affected"" in the 
</p><p>upcoming elections.  Asked about the Menem/Rodriguez Saa 
</p><p>alliance, Romero joked that ""they should have done this in 
</p><p>2003 (during the presidential election).""  He said he was the 
</p><p>one who advised Menem to withdraw from the 2003 presidential 
</p><p>race after the first round when it became clear Menem would 
</p><p>lose big.  ""There is no second round tradition in Argentina."" 
</p><p> Romero lamented the fact that former President Eduardo 
</p><p>Duhalde prevented an internal primary to chose a single 
</p><p>Peronist candidate in 2003 ""because he would have lost"" to 
</p><p>Menem.  Note:  Romero was Carlos Menem's running mate in his 
</p><p>2003 presidential bid.  Salta is one of the only provinces 
</p><p>where President Kirchner has not made an official visit. 
</p><p>However, in a sign of warming relations, Governor Romero and 
</p><p>President Kirchner met in Buenos Aires on March 2 to announce 
</p><p>the construction of 2000 housing units in Salta using federal 
</p><p>funds.  End Note 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (C) Romero expressed admiration for the U.S.  One daughter 
</p><p>currently attends Georgetown and his other children have 
</p><p>attended U.S. universities.  Romero professed to the 
</p><p>Ambassador to be pro-FTAA.  Governor Romero criticized the 
</p><p>central government's ""statist"" policies and said that he 
</p><p>believed in the free market.  Governor Romero thanked the 
</p><p>Ambassador for his visit to Salta and said he looked forward 
</p><p>to continued good relations with the U.S. and the Embassy. 
</p><p>------------------------------------ 
</p><p>SALTA: DRUG CORRIDOR TO BUENOS AIRES 
</p><p>------------------------------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) The Ambassador traveled to Salta in the wake of the 
</p><p>Buenos Aires Airport scandal involving the smuggling of 59 
</p><p>kilos of cocaine (Reftel) and one day following the seizure 
</p><p>of 149 kilos of cocaine by the Northern Border Task Force 
</p><p>(NBTF) and the Gendarmeria operating in Salta.  The trip was 
</p><p>perfectly timed to take advantage of increased news coverage 
</p><p>of narcotics related issues and enabled him to highlight the 
</p><p>assistance and support the USG offers Argentina in the 
</p><p>counternarcotics area. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (C) The Ambassador toured the DEA-funded NBTF headquarters 
</p><p>and received a briefing by NBTF commander Claudio Domenichini 
</p><p>on February 25.  Domenichini explained that 90 percent of 
</p><p>cocaine entering Argentina passed through the Province of 
</p><p>Salta and asserted that the NBTF played a pivotal role in 
</p><p>Argentina's drug interdiction effort.  He stated that the 
</p><p>NBTF interdicted 110 kilos of cocaine last year as a direct 
</p><p>result of investigations and so far this year had already 
</p><p>interdicted 194 kilos of cocaine.  (COMMENT:  Domenichini's 
</p><p>choice of statistics is of interest as he cited only 
</p><p>narcotics seizures directly related to the unit's 
</p><p>investigative efforts and did not include drugs seized by 
</p><p>random road block and drug dog searches.  By claiming all 
</p><p>seizures in which the NBTF participated in some way he could 
</p><p>have boasted a much larger number, as is the common practice 
</p><p>by GOA law enforcement agencies.  Domenichini's choice of 
</p><p>statistics is evidence of his integrity, his commitment to 
</p><p>modern investigative techniques as opposed to random searches 
</p><p>and his DEA/INL funded training.  END COMMENT.)  Domenichini 
</p><p>discussed the NBTF canine unit and expressed the hope that 
</p><p>DEA/INL could provide a planned drug dog training course in 
</p><p>Salta later this year.  In response to a question about the 
</p><p>use of small aircraft in smuggling operations, Domenichini 
</p><p>stated that there had been a great increase in the number of 
</p><p>aircraft in the northern part of the country and stated that 
</p><p>the NBTF was working with authorities in Santiago del Estero, 
</p><p>Chaco, Salta and Tucuman on the issue.  All agreed on the 
</p><p>need for the GOA to acquire radar systems in the short term 
</p><p>to deal with the problem of airborne smuggling.  The 
</p><p>Ambassador asked Domenichini about inter-agency relations to 
</p><p>which Domenichini replied that relations between the police 
</p><p>and Gendarmeria were not the problem.  He stated that the 
</p><p>major obstacle to effective enforcement rested with the 
</p><p>Salta-based federal judges.  He related how it often took too 
</p><p>long to obtain warrants from judges in time sensitive cases 
</p><p>and opined that in general Argentina's current laws and legal 
</p><p>system hamper his force's efforts to effectively combat 
</p><p>narcotics traffickers.  The Ambassador thanked Domenichini 
</p><p>and his staff for their dedicated efforts in the area of 
</p><p>narcotics enforcement and praised their recent successes. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C) The Ambassador received a briefing by Gendarmeria 
</p><p>Comandante Jorge Ramon Tapia, the Commander of  operations in 
</p><p>the Salta area, and Gendarmeria Comandante Anibal Maiztegui, 
</p><p>the former commander in Salta and current director of the 
</p><p>Gendarmeria's national narcotics unit.  The meeting started 
</p><p>with a conversation regarding the recent narcotics scandal in 
</p><p>the Buenos Aires airport.  Maiztegui opined that the incident 
</p><p>showed a general lack of control by the services involved and 
</p><p>added a point about the defunct DEA-sponsored airport task 
</p><p>force that used to operate in the Buenos Aires airport.  It 
</p><p>was an obvious comparison between the lack of control and 
</p><p>communication in Buenos Aires and the healthy coordination 
</p><p>between the NBTF and other groups involved in 
</p><p>counternarcotics operations in the Salta area.  Both 
</p><p>Gendarmeria officers briefed the Ambassador on the narcotics 
</p><p>situation in the border area, highlighting their belief that 
</p><p>members of the Bolivian government were involved in narcotics 
</p><p>trafficking and that members of Colombian narcotics 
</p><p>organizations were operating in the area.  In response to the 
</p><p>Ambassador's question about radar, Maiztegui stated that the 
</p><p>issue was difficult for the Gendarmeria as the decision 
</p><p>rested with the President, and as such the Gendarmeria dared 
</p><p>not criticize the lack of action on this issue.  He added 
</p><p>that for 12 years the lack of radar had been a major and 
</p><p>growing problem in the region.  Tapia stated that in truth 
</p><p>his organization could not possibly hope to control the 
</p><p>entire border that the Provinces of Salta and Jujuy shared 
</p><p>with Bolivia due to the rugged nature of the terrain and the 
</p><p>simple lack of manpower.  He said that, recognizing the 
</p><p>futility of controlling the border, the Gendarmeria employs a 
</p><p>control-in-depth strategy that utilizes multiple check points 
</p><p>at transportation choke-points in the border region to combat 
</p><p>the traffickers. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (C) Tapia also informed the Ambassador of the lack of jail 
</p><p>space in Salta and pointed out that the inability of the 
</p><p>correctional facilities to accept prisoners directly impacted 
</p><p>the Gendarmeria's operational ability, as each prisoner that 
</p><p>could not be transported to a penal institution diverted 
</p><p>resources and field troops from operations.  He acknowledged 
</p><p>that a federal prison had recently been expanded, but stated 
</p><p>that it was not big enough to meet current needs.  NOTE:  The 
</p><p>federal government has committed to building a new prison in 
</p><p>the Province, but there is no timeline as to when it will be 
</p><p>ready for operation.  END NOTE. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (C) Both commanders echoed Domenichini's comments 
</p><p>regarding cooperation and interaction with the judiciary. 
</p><p>Tapia asserted that it was common for him to dispatch an 
</p><p>officer to court at 8am to request an arrest warrant only for 
</p><p>that officer to wait at the court until 8pm in the hope of 
</p><p>receiving a warrant.  Both men opined to the Ambassador that 
</p><p>locally appointed federal judges had more interest in local 
</p><p>political issues than in law enforcement.  However, they also 
</p><p>acknowledged that the recently appointed federal judge in the 
</p><p>northern Salta town of Tartagal was working well with the 
</p><p>Gendarmeria and seemed to be honest and committed to 
</p><p>combating the narcotics traffickers.  The Ambassador thanked 
</p><p>both men for the briefing and congratulated them on their 
</p><p>unit's recent successes. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
</p><p>Positive Exchange of Views with Salta's Business Leaders 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (SBU) Fundacion Salta hosted a luncheon for the 
</p><p>Ambassador to meet with business professionals and government 
</p><p>officials in the province.  The main topics these community 
</p><p>leaders raised during the Q&A session of the event were 
</p><p>trade, Argentina's economy, and U.S. foreign policy.  Trade 
</p><p>questions focused on the issue of U.S. agricultural subsidies 
</p><p>as an impediment to Argentina's support for the Free Trade 
</p><p>Agreement of the Americas.  The Ambassador responded that the 
</p><p>World Trade Organization has established a mechanism for 
</p><p>addressing concerns about agricultural subsidies.  The 
</p><p>Ambassador recalled that, although various observers 
</p><p>predicted NAFTA would have dire economic consequences for the 
</p><p>U.S. and Mexico, both countries have reaped the benefits of 
</p><p>freer trade.  He also encouraged an approach to the FTAA that 
</p><p>would seek common ground on a broad base of issues and not 
</p><p>allow sensitivity over subsidies to dismiss the FTAA out of 
</p><p>hand.  The subjects for the economic questions were the U.S. 
</p><p>perspective on Argentina's debt exchange, recommended sectors 
</p><p>for investment in Argentina, and the global role of the U.S. 
</p><p>dollar as a central bank reserve currency.  The Ambassador 
</p><p>noted that the U.S. does not, and will not, take a position 
</p><p>on whether the terms of the debt exchange are adequate or 
</p><p>not.  On the matter of investment in the economy, the 
</p><p>Ambassador noted that the result of the debt exchange would 
</p><p>be key to the tone of discussions with the IMF, the outcome 
</p><p>of which could send positive signals to potential investors. 
</p><p>He emphasized the importance of legal protections and noted 
</p><p>that the growth in the services sector indicated 
</p><p>opportunities, and a need, for investment. 
</p><p>¶11. (SBU) U.S. businessmen at the luncheon raised concerns 
</p><p>that the value of the U.S. dollar could fall further if 
</p><p>central banks around the globe decide not to continue 
</p><p>including the dollar among their reserves.  Emboffs replied 
</p><p>that fears about the effect of U.S. trade and budget deficits 
</p><p>have persisted despite the strength of the U.S. economy. 
</p><p>Emboffs also remarked that threats to dump the dollar would 
</p><p>probably not yield large-scale changes in central banks' 
</p><p>practices to hold dollar-denominated reserves.  U.S. foreign 
</p><p>policy questions ranged from U.S.-Latin American relations to 
</p><p>the Middle East peace process.  Ambassador Gutierrez 
</p><p>responded that U.S.-Latin American relations have improved 
</p><p>and are improving.  The U.S. is working to expand its trade 
</p><p>ties with Latin America and has been in discussions on energy 
</p><p>integration with many countries in the region.  One 
</p><p>participant in the luncheon was critical of the U.S. position 
</p><p>regarding Argentina's relationship with the IMF, suggesting 
</p><p>the U.S. should have been more supportive.  The Ambassador 
</p><p>was quick to remind the audience that the U.S., unlike other 
</p><p>G-7 states, had consistently supported Argentina in the 
</p><p>aftermath of its economic crisis.  Others in attendance 
</p><p>interjected that the U.S. is not to blame for economic 
</p><p>difficulties Argentina brought on itself.  The U.S. remains 
</p><p>hopeful, the Ambassador remarked, for peace in the Middle 
</p><p>East.  He maintained that U.S. policy is that Israeli and 
</p><p>Palestinian leaders need to achieve this goal themselves. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (SBU) Econoff met with Salta Secretary of State Roberto 
</p><p>Ibarguren.  Ibarguren conveyed his appreciation for the USG's 
</p><p>strong anti-narcotics cooperation in the province.  He used 
</p><p>the occasion of the meeting to ask for Embassy Buenos Aires 
</p><p>consideration of expanding the cooperation to include greater 
</p><p>customs and immigration controls.  Ibarguren said the border 
</p><p>with Bolivia needed a modernized system for monitoring 
</p><p>flights, cars, and people crossing into Salta.  He reported 
</p><p>that the Gendarmeria had been successful in apprehending 
</p><p>groups of illegal immigrants from the PRC's Fujian Province. 
</p><p>He nevertheless would like to work closely with the Embassy 
</p><p>to identify ""snakeheads"" organizing illegal immigration 
</p><p>activities into and within the province.  Econoff said the 
</p><p>Embassy would give these informal requests appropriate 
</p><p>consideration and looked forward to continuing a close and 
</p><p>productive relationship with the province. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------------- 
</p><p>Press Coverage Extensive and Positive 
</p><p>------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (SBU) Press were present on both days of the trip. 
</p><p>Clusters of media photographers recorded the Ambassador's 
</p><p>airport arrival, his dinner with the governor, and other 
</p><p>events.  Salta's binational center, ISICANA, hosted a late 
</p><p>Thursday afternoon press conference by the Ambassador. 
</p><p>Reporters from national cable news, Salta TV and radio 
</p><p>stations, Salta's newspapers, national papers, and the wire 
</p><p>services were all present.  Several reporters asked for and 
</p><p>received five-minute exclusives with the Ambassador after the 
</p><p>press conference had concluded. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶14. (SBU) The Salta press was extremely appreciative that the 
</p><p>Ambassador gave them a half-hour of his time to openly answer 
</p><p>their questions.  One lamented, ""If only our city councilmen 
</p><p>would give us even a fraction of that time.""  On Friday the 
</p><p>25th, the Ambassador did a live on-air interview with Buenos 
</p><p>Aires' leading radio station, Radio 10.  A local TV and radio 
</p><p>station also showed up for brief coverage of the Ambassador's 
</p><p>visit to the Salta gendarmes' K-9 unit. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶15. (SBU) Coverage was extensive and largely positive. 
</p><p>Though Salta press also focused on the fact that the U.S. 
</p><p>ambassador was visiting their province and meeting their 
</p><p>officials, most stories in Argentine media centered on the 
</p><p>Ambassador's responses to questions on the recent scandal 
</p><p>involving drug shipment through Buenos Aires' international 
</p><p>airport.  While coverage varied, the headline of the 2/25 
</p><p>story in circulation leader ""Clarin"" - ""U.S. Warns on drug 
</p><p>traffic, but praises the government"" - indicates the tone of 
</p><p>most reporting.  The Ambassador noted that drug transshipment 
</p><p>was a problem for Argentina, but that the GOA was making 
</p><p>serious efforts to combat it.  He praised the level of 
</p><p>cooperation U.S. anti-drug forces received from their 
</p><p>Argentine counterparts and noted that U.S. anti-drug efforts 
</p><p>in Salta provided technical and technological support as part 
</p><p>of a joint effort with local counterpart agencies.  Comment 
</p><p>on the Ambassador's remarks in Salta continued in the same 
</p><p>vein throughout the ensuing week, including brief mention in 
</p><p>some of the key op-ed columns.  Though all media reflected 
</p><p>GOA appreciation with U.S. cooperation and the Ambassador's 
</p><p>remarks, some reporters suggested that it had been the U.S. 
</p><p>that tipped-off the GOA on the recent Buenos Aires airport 
</p><p>drug scandal.  The Ambassador made clear in his 2/25 
</p><p>interview with leading ""Radio 10"" that this was not the case. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶16. (SBU) The PAO had sidebar visits with Salta province's 
</p><p>secretary of culture and education and her staff, and also 
</p><p> 
</p><p>SIPDIS 
</p><p>met briefly with Salta city's culture secretary and the 
</p><p>rector of the Catholic University of Salta.  At all points, 
</p><p>past and future cooperation between the Embassy and Salta 
</p><p>institutions was discussed.  All Salteno interlocutors noted 
</p><p>Governor Romero's firm support for increased cultural 
</p><p>programming in the city and province.  PAS is already 
</p><p>providing assistance to some of the programs Governor Romero 
</p><p>is most interested in, such as the symphony orchestra. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------ 
</p><p>Mayor Upbeat on City's Economy 
</p><p>------------------------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶17. (SBU) The Ambassador was received by Salta Mayor Miguel 
</p><p>Angel Isa at the Salta City Hall on February 24.  Isa has 
</p><p>been mayor of Salta's capital city since being elected on the 
</p><p>Peronist Party (PJ) ticket in 2003.  Mayor Isa thanked the 
</p><p>Ambassador for his visit and presented him with the keys to 
</p><p>the city.  Isa highlighted the economic progress that has 
</p><p>occurred under his mandate in the city of roughly 600,000. 
</p><p>He reported that the tourism and construction sectors are 
</p><p>booming and unemployment is down. The Mayor said that the 
</p><p>city recently launched a major tourism advertising campaign 
</p><p>in Europe that he thought would help to attract more European 
</p><p>tourists.  Mayor Isa also highlighted the city's efforts to 
</p><p>combat drug addiction.  The Ambassador noted the common cause 
</p><p>that the United States and Argentina have in fighting drug 
</p><p>addiction and trafficking. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶18. (SBU) Isa reported that his relations with the province 
</p><p>are good.  He said that there was an equitable division of 
</p><p>responsibilities in the city between the city and provincial 
</p><p>governments.  He noted that the city was in the midst of a 
</p><p>long-term joint project with the provincial government 
</p><p>designed to restore the city's numerous colonial-era 
</p><p>buildings.  The Ambassador thanked Mayor Isa for his 
</p><p>hospitality. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>-------- 
</p><p>Comment: 
</p><p>-------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶19. (C) The Ambassador's trip to Salta was productive on many 
</p><p>levels.  The meetings with political and business elites 
</p><p>deepened the Embassy's contacts in this important province 
</p><p>and provided for a useful exchange of ideas.  The visit to 
</p><p>the NBTF and Gendarmeria headquarters emphasized the 
</p><p>importance the USG places on counternarcotics efforts at a 
</p><p>time when Argentina is fixated on the narcotics issue 
</p><p>stemming from the recent Buenos Aires airport drug scandal. 
</p><p>Salta's location, sharing borders with Bolivia, Paraguay and 
</p><p>Chile, makes this province critical to stemming the flow of 
</p><p>illegal drugs into Argentina.  The message the Ambassador 
</p><p>brought with him to Salta focused on the importance the U.S. 
</p><p>places on the bilateral relationship and on the need for 
</p><p>continued political, economic, and counternarcotics 
</p><p>cooperation.  Given the favorable press coverage in Salta and 
</p><p>the positive reception the Ambassador received from those 
</p><p>with whom he met, it appears that this message was well 
</p><p>received.
