 ¶1. (C) On May 31st, PolCoun and PolOff met with Alejandro 
Solano, sub-director of the Foreign Policy Section of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to discuss the growing 
Iranian-Venezuelan relationship (Ref a). Solano was receptive 
and expressed concerns, particularly in the area of the loose 
travel documents practice of Venezuela.  Solano indicated 
that he would bring these concerns to the Ministry of Public 
Security and to the head of the Immigration Department.  He 
further indicated that the GOCR would raise any issued that 
could impact Costa Rica in the proper forum, if needed. 
 (COMMENT: We will raise the travel documents issue in a 
meeting with the Director of Immigration next week.) Solano 
also noted (as we have heard from GOCR officials in the past) 
that Costa Rica has virtually no ties -private or official- 
with Iran. 
 
¶2.  (C) Solano added that Venezuelan actions continued to 
concern the GOCR.  On the RCTV closure, for example, the MFA 
had prepared points and a paper for President Oscar Arias, 
who pre-empted the staff work by issuing his own statement on 
May 30.  Arias's statement expressed hope that Costa Rica 
could maintain good relations with Venezuela, but stressed 
that "any time a media outlet is closed, it is a mortal wound 
for democracy."  The President also cited the importance of 
 "plurality, freedom of expression and many media outlets" as 
 "essential characteristics" of a democracy.  Based on the 
regional furor caused by Chavez's action against RCTV, Solano 
predicted that the issue would dominate debate at the Panama 
OASGA.  Recalling Chavez's (as-yet unfulfilled) threat in 
February to close the ALUNASA aluminum plant in Esparza (ref 
b), Solano cautioned Costa Rica did not want to provoke 
Venezuelan backlash, specially with the CAFTA referendum 
scheduled for September. 
 
¶3.  (C) COMMENT: The Arias administration continues to walk a 
fine line vis-a-vis Venezuela.  The GOCR does not want to 
draw fire from Caracas (which might include additional 
support for the anti-CAFTA forces here), but Arias himself, 
to his credit in this instance, cannot remain silent in the 
face of what he sees (rightly) as an egregious attack on 
democracy.  We expect the GOCR's behavior regarding Venezuela 
will continue to wobble between caution and criticism until 
after the referendum.
