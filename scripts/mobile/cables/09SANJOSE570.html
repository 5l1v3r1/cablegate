¶1. (SBU) Summary: President Oscar Arias publicly confirmed on 
July 8 that both President Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti will 
be personally attending mediation talks scheduled for July 
9-10 in San Jose.  Arias stated that he has been in contact 
with both parties, and expects Zelaya to arrive from 
Washington on the evening of July 8, with Micheletti arriving 
on the morning of July 9.  The media is now reporting that 
the talks will be held at President Arias' personal residence 
in San Jose.  The President's office has confirmed that the 
talks will begin on the afternoon of July 9, and the Costa 
Rican team will include Arias, Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno 
and Minister of the Presidency (and President Arias' brother) 
Rodrigo Arias. End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
A CENTRAL AMERICAN SESSION 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) MFA Chief of Staff Elaine White confirmed what Arias 
had made public, and told us that its still unclear who will 
be arriving with Zelaya, and whether his entourage would 
include representatives from the GBRV.  White said that the 
GOCR will "in no way" tell the parties who should be in their 
delegations to Costa Rica.  However, she said that they have 
made it clear that "only Central Americans will be in the 
room" during the negotiations. 
 
------------------------------ 
MEDIA APPLAUDS CHOICE OF ARIAS 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) The local media is roundly applauding the efforts of 
President Arias and his administration.  Costa Rica's largest 
daily states that Costa Rica's involvement is a "clear honor" 
that "recognizes the capacity of Arias...(to act) in good 
faith, efficacy and impartiality in the middle of the 
polarization of Honduras."  However, commentators also 
believe that it will be extremely difficult to arrive at a 
solution that is acceptable by all parties, and some doubt 
that it is possible in two days of talks. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (C) Post will continue to update the Department as we 
learn more details regarding the planned talks.  The focus on 
"only Central Americans" clearly seems aimed at keeping out 
representatives from South American ALBA countries (no word 
yet on what this might mean for the involvement of OAS reps). 
 Though this might affect our ability to have eyes in the 
room during the negotiations, we will continue to work with 
our contacts for detailed information during the meetings.
