  		<h1>THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR CHILDHOOD AND MOTHERHOOD'S ANTI-TRAFFICKING EFFORTS Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs Donald A. Blome for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(SBU) Key Points: -- The quasi-governmental National Council for Childhood and Motherhood's (NCCM) study on "summer marriages" found that girls and families agreed to these marriages because dowries and bridal gifts help provide substantial income for their families living in poverty. -- The Ministry of Family and Population and NCCM initiated a telephone hotline to provide assistance and consulting for girls, and will organize and train "Governorate Protection Committees" to counter the influence of "brokers" that promote summer marriages by disseminating information to parents, health centers, and community leaders on the hazards of early and forced marriage, and providing legal assistance to make people aware of the child trafficking law. -- NCCM is also conducting trafficking recognition and awareness seminars for healthcare providers, plans to educate parents in the Fayoum district about the dangers of "getting paid" in exchange for their child's labor as either a domestic servant or street beggar, and is undertaking efforts to train social workers, police officers, and detectives to recognize and deal with street children who are vulnerable to being trafficked.</h1>
