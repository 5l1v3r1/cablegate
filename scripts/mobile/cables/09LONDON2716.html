<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>(C/NF) Foreign Office Peacekeeping Team Desk Officer for MONUC Robin Budd offered poloff December 4 the following on the UK's thinking on the upcoming MONUC mandate renewal:  - On the French proposal to end MONUC's support to the FARDC, Budd said he and East and Central Africa Deputy Head Graham Zebedee planned to travel to Paris December 4 to speak directly with the French about their proposal.  Budd said he thinks he might "have misunderstood what the French want." Otherwise, he (and others in the UK government) are simply "baffled" by the French position.  Budd said at present the UK fully supports continued MONUC support to FARDC, though they would also like to see more focus on SSR, integration of the CNDP, and reduction of FARDC's size, which a re-direction of MONUC resources - at the appropriate time - could support, in the UK's assessment.  - On the length of the mandate renewal, Budd said the UK is sensitive to the mandate's renewal timing playing into DRC President Kabila's hand.  Budd assessed that a six-month mandate would allow for more frequent international scrutiny of Kabila and would maintain pressure on him to push forward progress on reform.  Additionally, as the situation on the ground is so fluid, a six-month mandate would allow revisions that address the changing concerns and priorities as necessary.  He conceded that while it is the UK's strong preference to have a six-month mandate, it is not a red-line.  He said there should be more discussion in New York about the political implications of a six-month vs. twelve-month mandate.  He also said the UK was not currently looking for more sweeping changes in the mandate, in part, because they envision a six-month renewal.  If a twelve-month mandate moves forward, the UK will likely want more changes and inclusion of a review of progress after six months.   Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
