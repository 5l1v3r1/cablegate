SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) The Ambassador shared the USG position regarding the 
March 17 Organization of American States (OAS) Ministerial 
with FM Araujo on March 13.  Araujo said the GOC hopes the 
upcoming meeting will end tensions between Ecuador and 
Colombia, and produce agreement on an OAS regional mechanism 
to assess and warn of terrorist groups' cross-border 
activities.  The GOC opposes the notion of a United Nations 
(UN) peacekeeping mission along the Colombian-Ecuadorian 
border.  Araujo welcomed President Bush's call for Congress 
to move forward on the Colombian Free Trade Agreement (FTA) 
after the Easter recess.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
UPCOMING OAS MINISTERIAL 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (C) The Ambassador explained the USG approach to the 
March 17 OAS Consultation of Ministers to FM Fernando Araujo 
on March 13, noting we must address the threat to peace and 
stability in the region from terrorists' use of third 
countries as safe havens.  The Ambassador emphasizing that 
the USG supports the GOC in the OAS process, but we have some 
concerns, such as international legal interpretations, that 
go beyond the context of the current dispute.  FM Araujo said 
he will represent the GOC at the March 17 OAS Ministerial and 
hopes to consult with Deputy Secretary Negroponte prior to 
the meeting.  He understood the USG had global interests that 
went beyond the narrow context of this OAS issue.  Araujo 
explained the GOC's fundamental objective for the Ministerial 
is to solidify cooperation among OAS member states against 
terrorists, narcotraffickers, and other security threats in 
the hemisphere.  The GOC hopes the session will end bilateral 
tension with Ecuador.  He also sought an agreement on the 
creation of an OAS regional verification mechanism that would 
assess and warn of illegal groups' cross-border activities. 
Araujo said the GOC believes the politics of the regional 
dispute were resolved at the Santo Domingo Rio Group summit 
and hopes the OAS ministerial will look to the future.  He 
would offer further apologies if necessary to achieve the 
GOC's goals. 
 
---------- 
OAS VISIT 
---------- 
 
¶3.  (C) The Ambassador asked Araujo for his assessment of the 
March 10-12 OAS mission to Colombia led by OAS SYG Jose 
Miguel Insulza.  Araujo said it was a productive visit, 
noting that the mission clearly wants to lay the groundwork 
for a positive Ministerial.  Insulza asked President Uribe 
for ideas on how to make the Ministerial a success.  Uribe 
outlined his thinking on an OAS verification mechanism. 
Araujo said the Argentine Ambassador was the only member of 
the OAS delegation to ask difficult or pointed questions.  He 
criticized the U.S. and other drug consumer nations, arguing 
they needed to do more to combat narcotics.  Araujo noted 
that Uribe responded that consumption in the U.S. was going 
down.  Uribe said the GOC considers USG support for Plan 
Colombia to be a major contribution to efforts against 
narcotics, but added that the Europeans should do more. 
Septel provides additional information on the OAS visit. 
 
--------------------------------- 
NO TO BORDER PEACEKEEPING MISSION 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Araujo said the GOC considered the idea of some sort 
of international peacekeeping mission along the 
Colombian-Ecuadorian border counterproductive.  The GOC does 
not want to turn this issue over to the UN, believing the UN 
should not take up an issue that is already in the hands of a 
regional organization, the OAS.  Araujo reiterated the GOC's 
desire for an OAS-managed verification mechanism, but not a 
peacekeeping operation. 
 
-------------------- 
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Araujo asked if President Bush's March 12 speech to 
the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce meant the USG intends 
to send the U.S.-Colombia FTA to Congress soon.  The 
Ambassador noted that the President's words spoke for 
themselves.  He had signaled his intent to move ahead after 
the Easter recess.  Araujo said GOC welcomes that, even in 
light of the Speaker's cautionary announcement following the 
President's speech.  Araujo said in a perfect world, the GOC 
wished the FTA would be considered and approved solely on 
economic and commercial grounds.  Still, he understood the 
political utility in the United States of including the 
national security context when arguing in support of the FTA.
