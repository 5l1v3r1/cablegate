SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (S)  The military killed two key FARC commanders in the 
September-December period, prompting desertions from the 
16th and 37th fronts.  The FARC continued to move forces from 
the eastern Macarena in Meta to parts of Tolima -Valle zone, 
leading some analysts to speculate that it is withdrawing 
some elite units to the central mountains to escape heavy 
military pressure.  An increase in FARC terrorist attacks 
suggested a possible escalation in terrorism to offset its 
declining military capabilities.  The ELN cooperated with the 
FARC and other illegal armed groups, as each front struggled 
to fund and safeguard itself through local alliances. Still, 
the FARC and ELN continued to fight each other in Arauca. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
DECAPITATION, THEN DISINTEGRATION OF KEY FARC FRONTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (S) Colombian military takedowns of FARC front commanders 
aka "Negro Acacio" and "Martin Caballero" (Refs D, E) led to 
the collapse of the 16th and 37th Fronts.  Acacio's death on 
September 1 triggered mass desertions of his forces, gutting 
the 16th front in Vichada.  Acacio's successor was covertly 
negotiating his surrender with the Army.  One source 
estimated drug revenues of the FARC's core Eastern Bloc 
shrank from $800,000 per month under Acacio to $200,000 after 
his death.  FARC leaders told remaining 16th front fighters 
to break into small units and retreat to remote areas to 
evade GOC forces.  The 37th front in Bolivar received similar 
orders. After sustained military and police operations 
against its fighters and militias led to Caballero's death on 
October 24, the front shift south to alleviate the military 
pressure. 
 
¶3. (S)  Colombian successes against FARC front commanders and 
the resulting desertions yielded new tactical intelligence, 
generating a steady stream of new strike targets.  At the 
current pace, desertions will set a record in 2008. 
Significantly, recent desertions include FARC veterans of 10 
or more years.  Some are demoralized by food and supply 
shortages; others alienated by abusive leaders or 
disillusioned by the loss of a revolutionary ethos.  GOC 
targeting of FARC mid-level commanders and rank-and file with 
rewards programs is also paying off.  In the FARC's 
heartland, the military is locating and destroying 
substantial arms and supply caches, thanks to tips from tired 
and hungry deserters seeking GOC payouts.  The snowball 
effect of leadership takedowns, desertions, and fresh 
tactical intelligence is likely to unravel more fronts in 
¶2008. 
 
-------------------------------- 
FARC FORCES' SHIFT TO THE CENTER 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (S)  The FARC continued to concentrate forces in a zone 
extending from Meta in the east, across the central ranges of 
Tolima / Huila, to Cali and Buenaventura in the west. 
Seventy percent of its fighters were located in this 
east-west oval, with the outer ends struggling to fulfill 
leaders' logistics needs.  Some analysts speculated that 1300 
elite fighters of the Eastern Bloc located in the western end 
of La Macarena (Meta) are moving west into the central 
mountains to escape military pressure. The steep terrain in 
Tolima provides the FARC with a natural fortress.  Such a 
retreat would signal its inability to maintain its presence 
in the key Macarena region due to sustained  military 
pressure from Joint Task Force Omega.  To the west of Tolima 
 
are strategic corridors through Florida and Pradeira (Valle) 
-- where the FARC seeks a demilitarized zone (despeje) -- and 
to Cali and Buenaventura.  FARC terrorist actions centered on 
these cities and nearby Neiva (Huila).  The Eastern Bloc also 
lost its financial prominence, with drug income now centered 
in the west. 
 
------------------------------------ 
FARC POLITICAL vs. MILITARY TENSIONS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (S)  The Secretariat maintained overall command, but the 
growing military pressure disrupted its internal 
communications as well as command and control over individual 
fronts.  Some analysts speculated that the FARC's military 
wing led by aka Mono Jojoy might be losing ground to more 
"political" leaders such as aka Alfonso Cano as the FARC 
continues to cede territory to the GOC, suffer supply and 
cash flows shortages, and lose experienced commanders.  Cano 
and other "political" leaders stress the need to complement 
military action with political activities, including the 
creation of Marxist cells ('Bolivarian militias') to 
infiltrate local government institutions, cultivation of ties 
to Venezuelan President Chavez, and diplomatic outreach to 
other European and Latin countries. 
 
--------------------------------- 
FARC TERRORIST ATTACKS MAY SPIKE? 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (S)  Recent attacks suggest the FARC may return to 
high-profile terrorism to offset its declining conventional 
capacity.  On December 30, the Teofilo Forero Mobile Column 
(TFMC) responsible for past headline terrorist acts fired a 
rocket (unsuccessfully) at a Colombian Hercules C-130 
aircraft carrying 50 soldiers on the runway in Neiva (Huila), 
only days after it made a fourth attempt to assassinate the 
city's outgoing mayor.  Earlier in December, police foiled a 
TFMC plot to kidnap President Uribe's sons.  Some military 
analysts speculated the FARC might resort to new attacks 
against military, government, and infrastructure targets to 
reassert its relevance.  While the prevailing assumption had 
been that the FARC would hunker down to 2010 to wait out 
President Uribe's term, the possibility that its 
disintegration had reached an unsustainable rate could prompt 
an escalation.  A successful hit against a GOC aircraft, in 
particular, could radically change the war's dynamic in the 
FARC's favor. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
ELN: GANGING UP WITH FARC, CRIMINAL GROUPS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (C)  The ELN increasingly cooperated with the FARC and 
other illegal armed groups, as individual ELN fronts 
struggled to fund and safeguard themselves through local 
alliances.  ELN and FARC jointly attacked an Army base in 
Bolivar with bombs and grenades.  In Catatumbo, the FARC 
remained on the sidelines, preferring to leave combat against 
the military to the ELN.  In contrast, the FARC and ELN 
continued to clash, with ELN frequently winning due to 
simultaneous military pressure against the FARC.  In Narino, 
the ELN worked with new criminal groups such as the Rastrojos 
and the Organization Nueva Generacion (ONG) to compete with 
the FARC for control of drug traffic.  These alliances were 
transaction-driven, and varied from locality to locality.
