Please handle accordingly. 1.(SBU) Key Points: --Dr. Samir Refaey, the Ministry of Health's executive director for disease surveillance, characterized current Egyptian influenza measures as a collaborative government effort effectively tracking the disease and its impact on the country. --Refaey emphasized that close monitoring by the Ministries of Health and Education have convinced the Egyptian government (GoE) that there is no need at this time to enact a general closure of the country's school system. --The GoE has purchased 5 million doses of a H1N1 vaccine and will distribute the first batch of 70,000 doses to health workers and Hajj pilgrims. --He views current H1N1 measures as a trial run for the upcoming H5N1 season.</h1>
