Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) GOC-ELN civil society guarantor Moritz Akerman said 
the third round of GOC-ELN exploratory talks will resume in 
Havana April 26, and go through April 29.  The parties will 
discuss administrative business only, leaving substantive 
discussions to after the May 28 presidential election (most 
likely late June).  Akerman said ELN military commander and 
negotiator Antonio Garcia arrived recently to Medellin from 
Cuba "tense and distrusting," wearing a bullet-proof vest, 
but left happy and anxious to return.  Akerman said the ELN 
and the guarantors want to move the talks from Cuba and 
Garcia asked the guarantors to explore with the GOC the 
option of Panama.  End summary.

GOC-ELN Talks Resume, Mostly Administrative Business 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Akerman told D/polcouns on April 25 that the third 
round of GOC-ELN exploratory talks will resume in Havana on 
April 26-29.  This date replaces the scheduled May 2-12 
talks.  Akerman explained that the parties (principally the 
GOC) want to avoid discussing a substantive agenda until 
after the May 28 presidential election, and therefore this 
round would be administrative only.  The guarantors as a 
group would not be present.  (Akerman said guarantor Alejo 
Vargas planned to attend "in his individual capacity," and we 
understand the three "accompanying countries" - Spain, 
Norway, and Switzerland - will attend.)  Akerman expects the 
next round to be in late June, after a theoretical June 18 
second round presidential run-off.

ELN Military Commander Arrived Tense, Departed Relaxed 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3.  (C) Akerman said Garcia arrived in Medellin from Havana 
for the recent ELN-civil society consultations (via civil 
charter aircraft from Caracas) "tense and distrusting."  He 
was wearing a bullet-proof vest and the ELN team carried lots 
of canned food to avoid poisoning attempts (reftel).  Garcia 
initially refused to eat food offered to him and served to 
other participants in the Casa de Paz process. 
 
¶4.  (C) After several days of interacting with community 
leaders (120), labor officials (80), students (450), and 
business people (8), Akerman said Garcia was "content, happy, 
more trusting, with a desire to return."  He ate the food 
served to others, and drank wine the guarantors offered him, 
without insisting that someone try it first.  Akerman said on 
the plane back to Caracas Garcia took him aside and said, 
"tienes que volverme a traer pronto" (you have to bring me 
back soon).

Venue Issues

¶5.  (C) Akerman reported that Garcia told the guarantors the 
ELN wants out of Cuba, and Garcia told Akerman the guarantors 
should explore the possibility of holding the talks in 
Panama.  The guarantors plan to raise this possibility with 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, he said.  Akerman said Garcia regards 
as too tough Cuban pressure to link the talks to future GOC 
talks with the FARC.  The guarantors are united in wanting 
the talks moved from Havana, but recognize the value to the 
GOC of keeping them there.  In Akerman's view, this matter 
will be discussed in more depth with the GOC after the May 28 
presidential election.

Bio Note 
-------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Akerman described Garcia as "very vain," recounting a 
shopping trip in which Garcia had the Casa de Paz (funded by 
Norway and Switzerland) buy him $1,000 in clothes.  Garcia 
insisted on getting an Yves St. Laurent suit, sports jacket, 
and pants ("it had to be Yves St. Laurent, he would not 
accept anything less," said Akerman).
