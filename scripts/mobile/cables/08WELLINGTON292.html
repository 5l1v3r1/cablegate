¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel action request, on September 
9 poloff met with Michael McBryde, deputy director of the 
United Nations and Human Rights Division of the New Zealand 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  Poloff and 
McBryde discussed each of the U.S. priorities contained 
within reftel. 
 
No-Action Motions 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) McBryde stated that NZ agrees with the U.S. position 
opposing no-action motions. 
 
Country-Specific Resolutions 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) According to McBryde, NZ agrees with and has also 
spoken out in favor of each of the country-specific 
resolutions outlined in reftel, with the exception of 
Belarus.  With respect to Belarus, NZ is pleased with the 
government's release of political prisoners, but has not 
taken a position on any specific resolution relating to 
Belarus (McBryde noted that MFAT has not studied the 
situation in detail).  With respect to Iran, McBryde stated 
that NZ has supported Canada's resolution in the past and 
plans to do so again. 
 
Thematic Resolutions 
-------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) With respect to defamation of religion resolutions, 
NZ is opposed to such resolutions according to McBryde.  He 
said that NZ views such resolutions as a "slippery slope." 
 
¶5.  (C) With respect to prisoners of conscience, NZ 
originally joined the U.S. as one of the 64 sponsors of the 
UN declaration.  McBryde stated that NZ would welcome the 
opportunity to follow-up on the declaration and he liked the 
ideas of highlighting the declaration at events commemorating 
the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights and on Human Rights Day.
