¶1.  (SBU) President Rafael Correa, in an April 4 television 
interview in Loja and again in his April 5 weekly radio 
address, stated that the GOE would take severe measures to 
address what he termed Ecuador's intelligence services' 
failure to provide him complete, timely and accurate 
information.  Correa claimed that Ecuador's intelligence 
services had been taken over by the "CIA," which had passed 
vital information from and about Ecuador to the Colombian 
government.  Insinuating that he could become a victim of an 
attack at any moment, the President warned in his radio 
address: "Do not believe in aerial accidents, helicopters 
falling down, or airplanes crashing.... I do not want to die 
yet.  Enough of (Ecuadorian) intelligence services that are 
financed by the Embassy of the United States....  We will end 
that and have intelligence services that belong to 
Ecuadorians and for Ecuadorians, not to serve foreign powers." 
 
¶2.  (C) What apparently set Correa off was that he learned 
about military intelligence information on Ecuadorian citizen 
Franklin Aisalla's ties to the FARC from the press rather 
than from the military commanders.  Aisalla was killed 
(reftel) in the March 1 Colombian attack on a FARC camp in 
Ecuador. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) The Ambassador communicated her strong objections 
to Correa's remarks in conversations with the GOE leadership 
on April 7.  She spoke separately by phone with Correa and 
Government and Police Minister Fernando Bustamante, and in 
person with Vice Foreign Minister Jose Valencia, Defense 
Minister Wellington Sandoval, and Principal Under Secretary 
of Defense Miguel Carvajal.  The Ambassador called President 
Correa's comments unhelpful and said they needed to be toned 
down and any concerns put into proper channels.  She stressed 
that the GOE leadership knew perfectly well about the 
relationship that USG had with various GOE intelligence 
services and that it was similar to that in many countries 
worldwide.  The Ambassador emphasized that these activities 
were in no way directed against Correa or his government. 
She asked why the GOE had not spoken directly with her before 
Correa made public comments directed against us and said we 
were available to discuss any questions or concerns. 
 
¶4.  (S/NF) President Correa returned the Ambassador's call 
quickly and was very cordial.  He conceded that he knew the 
USG was not acting against him but insisted that his 
intelligence services were not serving him well and would be 
investigated.  The Ambassador said we would be willing to 
provide a full briefing on our assistance to the intelligence 
services to him or any member of his staff he chose to 
delegate.  Clearly disturbed by the President's statements, 
Sandoval commented that he was not sure where the President 
received his information, but speculated that he reacted to 
news he read every morning.  Joint Command Chief of Staff 
General Fabian Varela, who participated in the meeting with 
Sandoval, made clear that the GOE would be "blind" without 
information and cooperation it received from the USG.  Even 
Defense Principal Under Secretary Carvajal, who is closely 
tied to the left, admitted that what the USG was doing was 
normal and accepted.
