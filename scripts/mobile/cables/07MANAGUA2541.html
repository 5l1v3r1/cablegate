¶1. (C) On December 4, we delivered the non-paper and talking 
points per reftel to Director General for American Affairs, 
Orlando Gomez; Director General for Asia, Africa and Oceana, 
David McField, and Acting Director General for International 
Organizations, Mario Barquero Baltodano at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MINREX).  The text was also delivered to 
Chief of Army Public Relations BG Zepeda who briefed 
Nicaraguan Army Director of Intelligence Col Rodriguez. 
 
¶2. (C) MINREX DG for America Orlando Gomez thanked us for the 
notification, expressed appreciation for the detailed 
findings of the NIE and promised to pass the information 
along to the President's office.  With respect to our request 
that the Government of Nicaragua (GON) issue a public 
statement calling for Iran to suspend its ongoing 
nuclear-related activities and comply with its obligations 
under UNSC resolutions, Gomez noted that President Ortega had 
made numerous public statements "supporting Iran's desire to 
develop a peaceful nuclear energy program," including most 
recently, at the United Nations General Assembly in 
September.  NOTE: We note that Ortega's UNGA address did make 
several statments supporting "the rights of any nation to 
develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes," Ortega also 
questioned whether the international community's authority to 
prevent nations from developing nuclear weapons capacity, if 
they so chose.  END NOTE. 
 
¶3.  (C) COMMENT:  We are fairly certain that the NIE briefing 
points reached Ortega, because he referred to the NIE 
findings (and grossly misconstrued them) in a speech on 
December 5.
