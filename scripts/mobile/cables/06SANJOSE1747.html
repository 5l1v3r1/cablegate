¶1. (C) Ambassador discussed reftel talking points with 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Stagno on August 4, 2006. 
Stagno indicated that he would discuss the situation with 
Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs 
Thomas Shannon when they were in Bogota, Colombia, on August 
7 for the inauguration of President Alvaro Uribe.  President 
Oscar Arias commented publicly on August 1 that he would like 
to see Cuba evolve towards a representative democracy. 
 
¶2. (U) According to the Costa Rican newspaper, La Nacion, 
Arias planned to meet Cuban vice-president Carlos Luge the 
evening of Uribe's inauguration.  Arias intended to pass a 
message to Raul Castro encouraging him to promote a 
transition to democracy in Cuba.  However, during the 
inauguration ceremony, Lage approached Arias and informed him 
that he was not willing to discuss this subject at their 
meeting.  Arias would not accept this condition and canceled 
the meeting.
