  		<h1>EGYPT UNSUCCESSFUL IN SWAYING UPSTREAM NILE BASIN COUNTRIES REF: A. CAIRO 1897 B. CAIRO 1506 C. CAIRO 1615 Classified By: Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs Stephen P. O'Dowd for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(C) Key Points: -- During two separate meetings, Egyptian officials at the MFA and Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation told us that Egyptian attempts to use development and investment incentives have failed to sway the opinions of the seven upstream Nile countries on the proposed Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA). -- According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the seven upstream Nile countries in early December rejected a new Egyptian proposal to resolve the impasse over the CFA. The proposal eliminated the need to obtain the approval of downstream countries before initiating projects on the Nile. -- Egyptian officials held out little hope of resolving the impasse prior to the next Nile Council of Ministers (NileCOM) meeting in late February in Sharm El Sheikh. The XXXXXXXXXXXX expressed concern that the current situation may force the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) countries to go their separate ways.</h1>
