¶1.  (S/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS ARE INTENSELY INTERESTED IN 
THE DEVELOPING CONFLICT BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA.  AS 
TIME AND RESOURCES ALLOW, WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INSIGHT 
POST COULD PROVIDE ON BRAZIL'S POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT AS A 
MEDIATOR IN THIS CONFLICT.  MANY THANKS FROM WASHINGTON. 
 
¶A.  (S/NF)  WHAT IS THE LULA GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY ON 
ENGAGING URIBE AND CHAVEZ TO REDUCE TENSIONS? 
 
¶B.  (S/NF)  WHAT SPECIFICALLY DOES BRASILIA INTEND TO OFFER 
AT THE 26 NOVEMBER CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT IN MANAUS WITH 
RESPECT TO THIS BILATERAL SPAT? 
 
¶C.  (S/NF)  WHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF THE REGIONAL 
NONAGGRESSION AGREEMENT THE BRAZILIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY IS 
LOOKING TO NEGOTIATE?  HOW IS BRASILIA ENGAGING QUITO TO PUT 
THIS NONAGGRESSION AGREEMENT ON THE UNASUR AGENDA? 
 
¶D.  (S/NF)  DOES BRASILIA FAVOR UNASUR, OAS, OR UN HANDLING 
OF THIS MATTER?  HOW DOES BRASILIA PLAN TO RESPOND, SHOULD 
BOGOTA APPEAL TO THE UN? 
 
¶E.  (S/NF)  WHAT IS MOTIVATING THE BRAZILIAN RESPONSE TO 
REGIONAL TENSIONS ARISING FROM THE U.S.-COLOMBIA DCA?  WHAT 
IS BRAZIL'S OWN POSITION ON THE DCA, AND HOW HAS IT EVOLVED 
OR BEEN AFFECTED BY ITS INTERACTIONS WITH COLOMBIA AND 
VENEZUELA? 
 
¶2.  (U)  PLEASE CITE C-AL9-02389 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
