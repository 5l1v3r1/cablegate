FOR REASONS 1.5(B,D) 
 
(C) The GoNZ does not object to the release of the 
Multinational Force (MNF) Statement on Terrorism as written 
ref A.  Bronwyn Evans-Kent, Security Policy Division, New 
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), noted 
that the document was still being circulated among MFAT 
divisions, but no objections were anticipated.  Should there 
be any concerns over specific language, these would be 
provided to Washington by COB August 2.  She referred to 
strong public statements by the NZ Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister (ref B) regarding NZ's policy of not making 
concessions to terrorists.  Evans-Kent also reiterated that 
the GoNZ is not engaged in Iraq as part of the Coalition, and 
preferred the Statement on Terrorism with the MNF moniker.
