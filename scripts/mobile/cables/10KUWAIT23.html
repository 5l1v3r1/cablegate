¶1. (U) There is an action request in para 7. 
¶2. (C) Summary: The head of MFA’s Arab World Department, 
Ambassador Jassem Mubaraki, told Polcouns January 12 that 
Palestine Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s January 5 - 6 
visit to Kuwait and meeting with the Amir was positive, and 
provided an opportunity for Kuwait to encourage Abbas to 
remain in politics and focus on Palestinian reconciliation as 
an essential step towards a peace agreement with Israel. 
Mubaraki confirmed that the MFA would deliver a similar 
message on Palestinian reconciliation to HAMAS leader Khaled 
Mishaal later January 12 when he visits Kuwait.  FM Dr. 
Mohammed separately confirmed to Ambassador that the GoK 
would provide $50 million for the PA via the World Bank Trust 
Fund once discussions with the Parliament over a contentious 
personal debt foregiveness bill are concluded.  Mubaraki also 
noted Kuwait’s growing concern over increasing instability in 
Yemen, strong interest in and intent to participate in the 
January 28 London conference, and raised Kuwaiti concern 
about recent comments by CENTCOM Commander General Petraeus 
suggesting the possibility of a military option in dealing 
with Iran.  End Summary. GOK Urges Palestinian Reconciliation 
 ------------------------------------
¶3. (C) Ambassador Jassem Al-Mubaraki, Director of MFA’s Arab 
World Department, in a January 12 conversation with Polcouns, 
said the highlight of Palestine Authority President Mahmoud 
Abbas’s January 5 - 6 visit to Kuwait was an open and direct 
chat with Kuwaiti Amir Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al Sabah. 
Mubaraki -- who had been out of Kuwait during Abbas’s visit, 
but was subsequently briefed on it -- noted that the Amir had 
urged President Abbas to abandon any thought of stepping down 
from Palestinian politics and to continue to lead efforts to 
bring about Palestinian reconciliation, consistent with 
existing Egyptian efforts to promote peace and 
reconciliation.  Reconciliation between the Palestinian 
factions, the Amir suggested, was a necessary first step 
towards a meaningful peace process; Israel needed an 
interlocutor who had the authority to make commitments and 
would not negotiate with a divided Palestinian entity. 
Mubaraki said that Abbas hinted that he might stay on if he 
sees "a glimmer of hope" in the 
MEPP, but would otherwise be inclined to step down. Mubaraki 
noted that the GOK views Abbas as a "moderate who we can 
trust and rely on" and strongly desires his continued role as 
Palestinian leader.  Mubaraki said Abbas agreed that a 
continued focus on the peace process -- with Palestinian 
reconciliation as a first step -- was the only viable option. 
 The two other options, "war with Israel" or indefinite 
lingering in a "no war/no peace" status were non-starters. 
Mubaraki added that the GOK was inspired by President Obama’s 
"seriousness" about ending this long-standing regional 
problem and is eager to meet him half way; essential steps 
toward this end will include, in addition to Palestinian 
reconciliation, a more forthcoming Israeli position on 
settlements and the status of Jerusalem, consistent with 
existing features of the MEPP roadmap. 
¶4. (C) Responding to Polcouns inquiries about a reported 
imminent visit by Hamas leader Khaled Mishaal, Mubaraki said 
that Mishaal had, indeed, already arrived in Kuwait and would 
be dining with Mubaraki and other MFA officials later on 
January 12.  Mubaraki noted that the GOK’s message to Mishaal 
would be similar to the Amir’s message to Abbas -- that 
Palestinian reconciliation within the framework of the 
Egyptian-led peace effort "and under Egyptian supervision" 
was an essential first step towards a peace 
process that Israel could take seriously.   Mubaraki said 
that Egypt’s Ambassador to Kuwait called on him on January 11 
and asked MFA to stress to Mishaal GOK support for an 
Egyptian decision to install steel barriers on its territory 
to inhibit smuggling between Gaza and Egypt.  "Egypt views 
this a national security issue; but it is not helping Israel 
to lay siege to Gaza."  Mubaraki said the GOK fully supports 
Egypt’s position and will convey this to Mishaal.  (Comment: 
Mubaraki’s positive slant on Abu Mazen may reflect his 
personal views more than that of the GOK as a whole. 
Earlier, MFA U/S Khalid Jarallah told Ambassador that the 
GOK’s support for Abu Mazen was based on his personal KUWAIT 00000023  002 OF 002 
integrity, rather than blanket support or a preference for PA 
rather than HAMAS leadership, which they believe must be 
brought in for any sucessful and sustainable solution. 
Although Mubaraki did not appear aware of the commitment, FM 
Dr. Mohammed had earlier confirmed to the Ambassador that the 
GoK has agreed to provide $50 million for the PA via the 
World Bank Trust Fund after current wrangling with the 
parliament over a personal debts forgiveness bill is 
concluded.  End Comment.) 
Growing Concern Over Instability in Yemen 
 -----------------------------------------
¶5. (C) Turning to the subject of Yemen, Mubaraki noted that 
the GOK is deeply concerned by growing instability there and, 
like the USG, views the specter of Yemen becoming even more 
of an Al-Qaeda base as "a terrible scenario, if true."  He 
added that Kuwait is also paying close attention to the 
central government’s war on the Houthis (and wondering what 
Iran’s role is in this) and to the prospect that corruption 
and weakness in the Sanaa government could lead to a 
worsening situation in southern Yemen, possibly to include a 
movement in that part of the country to break away from the 
rest of Yemen.  Mubaraki acknowledged that the GOK is 
particularly concerned that instability in Yemen is a serious 
threat to Saudi Arabia, a GCC partner and a pillar of overall 
Gulf stability.  Mubaraki noted that the GOK has been invited 
to attend a January 28 UK-hosted summit in London on the 
situation in Yemen and is interested in attending; the GOK 
would like to know at what level the USG will be represented 
at this meeting, so it can determine an appropriate 
delegation.   While being clear that the GOK is still 
studying the situation in Yemen, he noted that Kuwait 
believes it is important for well-wishers to take care in how 
and to whom they dispense assistance.  He suggested that 
while the central government in Sanaa is corrupt, direct 
assistance to tribals could provide Iran with an excuse to 
intervene directly among the Houthis; such issues needed to 
be considered carefully. 
Tread Carefully on Iran 
 -----------------------
¶6. (C) Further on the theme of Iran, Mubaraki expressed 
concern over public remarks CENTCOM commander General 
Petraeus reportedly used January 10 referring to the possible 
use of force to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions.   (Note: 
Mubaraki was apparently referring to a Petraeus interview on 
CNN’s "Amanpour" show in which he acknowledged that the US 
had developed contingency plans for dealing with Iran’s 
nuclear facilities.  End Note.)  Mubaraki told POLCouns that 
the GOK is concerned by any possible use of force in dealing 
with Iran and believes the international community needs to 
deal carefully with an Ahmadinejad regime that is under a 
great deal of stress because of internal dissension. Mubaraki 
suggested that the Iranian regime could seize on outside 
threats, even vague or indirect ones, as a way to rally support for itself; the international community will do 
better to wait and watch while internal events in Iran play 
themselves out. 
¶7. (U) Embassy requests Department to provide, as 
appropriate, information on planned level of USG attendance 
at the London conference on Yemen, so these can be shared 
with the GOK.
