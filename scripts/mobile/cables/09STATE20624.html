<br></pre></p></div><p>1.4 (B), (D), AND (H).
</p><p>¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see
paragraph 4.
</p><p>¶2. (S) Background. The United States has information
indicating that in October 2008, Iranian businessman
Hamid Reihani established himself as a dealer for the
Dutch gas turbine engine manufacturer AMT Netherlands.
We also understand that in November 2008, AMT
Netherlands shipped Titan unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
engines and Pegasus engines to Reihani - possibly via a
Reihani associate in the United Arab Emirates.
Shipping documents may have identified the engines as
model aircraft parts. Although we do not have any
information on the identity of the end-user, Reihani
has previous associations with individuals affiliated
with the Iranian UAV entity Qods Aviation (or
Aeronautics) Industries, an entity designated under
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1747 for its
association with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps.
</p><p>¶3. (S) We want to urge Dutch officials to investigate
this information and take all appropriate measures to
ensure that AMT Netherlands is not acting as a supplier
to Iranian entities of proliferation concern.
</p><p>¶4. (S) Action request: Request Embassy The Hague
approach host government officials to deliver talking
points/non-paper in paragraph 5 and report response.
Talking points may also be provided as a non-paper.
</p><p>¶5. (S) Begin talking points/non-paper:
(SECRET//REL NETHERLANDS)
</p><p>-- We would like to alert you to a matter of
proliferation concern and request your assistance in
investigating this activity.
</p><p>-- The U.S. has information indicating that in early
October 2008, the Iranian businessman Hamid Reihani of
Parilla Company Ltd. became a dealer for the Dutch gas
turbine engine manufacturer AMT Netherlands.
</p><p>-- We also understand that at that time, an associate
of AMT Netherlands provided Reihani with price quotes
for a number of items, including Titan unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) engines, as well as Pegasus and Olympus
engines.
</p><p>-- Our information further indicates that AMT
Netherlands shipped Pegasus and Titan engines to
Reihani during November 2008 - possibly via a Reihani
associate in the United Arab Emirates - and that the
engines may have been identified on shipping documents
as model aircraft parts.
</p><p>-- Although the end-users for these engines were not
identified, we are concerned that Reihani could act as
a supplier to Iranian UAV entities, as Reihani has
previous associations with individuals either
affiliated or involved with Qods Aviation (or
Aeronautics) Industries.
</p><p>-- Qods Aeronautics Industries is an entity designated
under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1747
for its association with the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps.
</p><p>-- We therefore hope you will investigate this activity
and use all available measures to ensure that AMT
Netherlands is not acting as a supplier to entities of
proliferation concern.
-- We look forward to continued cooperation on
nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions
your government takes in response to this information.
</p><p>¶6. (U) Please contact ISN/MTR's John Paul Herrmann
with any questions or follow-up issues related to this
case XXXXXXXXXXXX and
slug reporting on this issue for ISN/MTR.
</p><p>¶7. (U) A word version of this document will be posted
at www.state.sgov.gov/demarche.
