 ¶1. (U) Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin was the 
guest of honor at a dinner following the EU Heads of State or 
Government summit in Lahti on October 20.  The leaders were 
also joined by Finnish President Halonen who has faced 
criticism for inviting Putin at all.  Prime Minister Vanhanen 
took pains that evening and in public statements since the 
dinner to stress that the EU was unified in its approach and 
message to Russia; however, other EU leaders and press in 
attendance immediately stated that the dinner had not been as 
pleasant as portrayed in the final press conference and that 
deep divisions within the EU persist as the Presidency looks 
to the EU-Russia summit next month.  End Summary. 
 
FACING OFF OVER HUMAN RIGHTS 
---------------------------- 
¶2. (U) According to press contacts and later confirmed by an 
advisor in the Finnish Prime Minister's office, the dinner 
turned sour during discussions of human rights, not energy as 
had been predicted.  Finnish hosts had warned member states 
in advance that this dinner was not the place to air lengthy 
criticisms of the Russian state.  Instead, the Presidency 
hoped to control the event by gaining member state consensus 
on talking points and having one or two pre-selected speakers 
address each topic (see ref A).  According to a press contact 
with sources in the French President's office, the discussion 
deteriorated to "yelling and screaming" when the leaders of 
Poland, Latvia, and Denmark questioned Putin on escalating 
tensions with Georgia.  Putin's anger was still apparent 
hours later at the closing press conference where, in 
response to a reporter's question on Georgia, he emphasized 
that Georgia alone is responsible for the worsening situation 
and implied that he had information proving Georgia planned 
to use force to settle its frozen conflicts.  "This is 
heading for disaster," Putin said.  The question elicited 
Putin's longest and most emotional answer of the night. 
 
¶3. (C) Johan Schalin, Finnish Prime Minister Vanhanen's 
foreign policy advisor, confirmed to emboff that the dinner 
had gotten tense when discussing Georgia, Chechnya, and the 
recent murder of a prominent Russian journalist critical of 
the Kremlin.  He was hesitant, however, to characterize the 
dinner as anything other than a frank and open discussion 
with brief flashes of anger and a few sharp exchanges. 
(Comment: Given the Finnish tendency toward understatement 
and the clear desire to confirm Vanhanen's assessment of the 
dinner, the atmosphere was probably a good mix of both the 
French and Finnish interpretations.)  When questioned about 
corruption, Putin asked how many Spanish mayors were in jail 
for real estate fraud.  When questioned about organized 
crime, the Russian president snapped that "Mafia" is an 
Italian word, not Russian. 
 
ENERGY: THE PAPER TIGER 
----------------------- 
¶4. (U) Pre-summit press focused on energy security and supply 
as another source of potential conflict with Putin during the 
dinner.  In contrast to the human rights discussion, the EU 
leaders appear to have stayed on the Finnish message that a 
new, legally-binding agreement spelling out Russia-EU energy 
cooperation is necessary.  Though Putin publicly brushed 
aside the idea that the Kremlin would sign the European 
Energy Charter, he expressed Russian support for its general 
concepts and appeared willing to discuss either an energy 
section within the next Partnership and Cooperation Agreement 
or a separate bilateral agreement. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5. (C) Since Lahti, Vanhanen has made several public 
comments, including a speech to the European Parliament on 
October 25 where he emphasized that the EU needs to speak to 
foreign partners with a single voice to avoid the perception 
of weakness and that Lahti was a success because the EU did 
so with Putin.  The Finns' reputation for quiet diplomacy and 
working behind the scenes limited the potential damage that a 
free-for-all approach to Putin could have caused, although 
some member states chafed at the organization the hosts 
imposed on the dinner, making the strain of the unified 
approach more evident.  The Finnish presidency appears to 
have set the stage for a productive energy discussion at the 
EU-Russia bilateral summit next month, despite the 
disagreement over human rights.
