¶1. (C) Summary: Locked in a tougher than expected battle for 
votes, a once-confident Labour Party has forsaken its 
reputation for fiscal restraint to dish out promises of pork 
for students and low- and middle-income families.  In the 
run-up to New Zealand's September 17 election, Labour also 
has played on anti-American sentiment by claiming the 
opposition National Party is beholden to U.S. interests and 
itching to eliminate the country's iconic anti-nuclear 
policy.  Just six months ago, Labour appeared to be coasting 
to a historic third term in office, the first time a Labour 
Government would have served more than six consecutive years 
since 1949.  But it stumbled badly in May when -- following 
six years of large budget surpluses -- its annual budget 
disappointed the public by failing to provide immediate tax 
cuts. 
 
¶2.  (C) Labour appears to be turning around its fortunes with 
its election-year gifts.  It has also gained ground by 
casting National as a party of the rich with a hidden agenda 
to destroy social programs.  Center-left Labour also appears 
to be attracting voters by remaining pragmatic and cautious 
in its policies overall, calculating that solidifying its 
appeal to the middle of the New Zealand electorate should be 
enough to spell victory in the election.  Public opinion 
polls show Labour widening its lead over National, which had 
a slight edge just two months ago.  The race is still too 
close to call, though.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
FROM THE LEFT TO THE CENTER 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) New Zealand's governing Labour Party occupies the 
center-left of the political spectrum.  Its election 
successes in 1999 and 2002 rested on its ability to build 
bridges with two camps:  working-class supporters 
representing the party's roots, and younger, often 
university-educated, urban liberals.  Since the center-right 
National Party began climbing in the polls in early 2004, 
Labour has shifted its focus to consolidate support in the 
center, particularly among lower- and middle-income wage 
earners. 
 
¶4. (C) Labour supports a strong role for government in 
improving life for the country's less advantaged, and 
generally backs income redistribution to achieve that end. 
Since returning to power in 1999 after nine years in 
opposition, Labour has restored some of the cuts in social 
spending and rolled back parts of the employer-friendly labor 
laws enacted by National-run governments in the 1990s, 
exacerbating divergence of investment to Australia. 
 
¶5. (C) On non-economic social policy, the Labour-led 
government adheres more closely to its traditional roots.  It 
legalized (previously de facto) prostitution in 2003 and 
enacted a civil union law in 2004 that provides legal 
recognition for same-sex and other couples as an alternative 
to traditional marriage.  Recognizing the risk of promoting 
such controversial measures, the Government allowed Labour 
and coalition members to vote on both bills according to 
their conscience.  Here in liberal New Zealand, even most 
members of the opposition voted in favor of civil union, but 
members of the public opposed to the bill still blame Labour 
for its passage. 
 
¶6. (C) Despite such occasional risk-taking, Labour under 
Prime Minister Clark has in most respects taken a pragmatic, 
centrist and, until recently, fiscally conservative approach 
to governing.  It has kept a tight rein on overall budget 
outlays, even while it ramped up spending on education, 
health care and selected social programs.  Aided by a strong 
economy that increased tax revenues, Labour has produced 
budget surpluses for six years and reduced government debt, 
on which it now stakes its claim to being a prudent financial 
manager.  And, as an example of the party's pragmatism, 
Labour has risked a rift with its traditional left-wing 
allies by aggressively pursuing liberalized trade, both 
within the World Trade Organization and in bilateral 
agreements (including talks now under way with China). 
 
----------------------------------- 
FINDING LOOSE CHANGE UNDER THE SOFA 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) But under pressure from National, Labour has abandoned 
some of its caution and begun to hike spending, aiming to 
appeal to middle-of-the-road New Zealanders who had been left 
out of the party's social programs and might be tempted by 
National's tax cuts.  The first move was a Government 
announcement in July that it would forgive the interest on 
student loans for students who remain in the country, gaining 
support not only among students but also among their parents 
and grandparents who have watched New Zealand graduates seek 
higher-paying jobs overseas to help pay off student loans. 
 
¶8. (C) Next, Labour repackaged and expanded its 2004 
showpiece "Working for Families" (WWF) program, originally 
designed to increase welfare benefits for the working poor 
and large middle-income families.  Labour's public 
advertisements showcasing WWF originally were to culminate in 
triumph this month, in time to ensure Labour's reelection. 
But when the public seemed underwhelmed, and drawn instead to 
National's pledge to cut taxes for all New Zealanders, Labour 
repackaged WWF as "tax relief" and announced on August 18 it 
would expand the program to cover 350,000 families at an 
estimated annual cost of NZ $400 million (US $277 million). 
The move has been applauded by many voters, although others 
have reacted with skepticism: the Government had previously 
insisted there was no money for tax cuts. (Many of the funds 
for expanded WWF allegedly come from higher-than-expected tax 
revenues.) 
 
¶9. (C) Matthew Palmer (protect), son of former Labour PM Sir 
Geoffrey Palmer, told us that Labour's May budget avoided 
spending down the surplus precisely so the Government could 
use the money for election year dazzlers as needed.  More 
spending announcements are to come, he reckons. 
 
---------------------- 
The Anti-American Card 
---------------------- 
 
¶10. (C) With Labour battered by the National Party on 
domestic issues and bettered by National in the polls 
starting in May, the Government opened up a second front with 
National: foreign policy.  One cabinet member asserted -- but 
later could offer no evidence -- that U.S. interests were 
providing National with campaign funds and advice (ref D). 
Foreign Minister Goff separately accused National of seeking 
U.S. advice on how to move New Zealand public opinion to 
reverse its ban on nuclear-armed and nuclear-propelled ships 
(ref C). 
 
¶11. (C) Labour's spending promises, together with questions 
it has raised about National on both domestic and foreign 
policy, appear to be paying off:  Poll results announced 
August 21 showed Labour widening its lead over National from 
four to eight points, with Labour at 45 percent approval 
versus National at 37 percent. 
 
-------------------- 
Labour's weak points 
-------------------- 
 
¶12. (C) In addition to satisfying some voters' suspicions 
over Labour's sudden ability to fund election-year bonanzas, 
the Party still has some vulnerabilities heading into 
elections.  "Working for Families" and student loans do 
nothing for higher-income wage earners or singles.  The large 
budget surplus has fueled a public perception that there is 
plenty of money available to fund tax cuts, and these groups 
now see that Labour has largesse to spend but they will not 
benefit.  Moreover, Labour has done little to counter 
National's claims that the Government bureaucracy, which has 
grown significantly under Labour, is taking from taxpayers 
money that rightfully belongs to them. 
 
¶13. (C) Labour also still suffers from a perception among 
some in the public that the Government is arrogant in its 
belief that it knows better than taxpayers how to spend their 
money.  Similarly, in a land that values the common "bloke," 
Labour officials -- and particularly PM Clark and her circle 
of female advisors and confidantes -- often appear obsessed 
with political correctness and more interested in fringe 
groups than the "mainstream." 
 
¶14. (C) Meanwhile, Labour has had to tread carefully on 
issues involving Maori, now that many of these traditional 
Labour supporters are being drawn to the Maori Party.  While 
the loss of Maori support alone will not cost Labour the 
race, the Labour Party has taken pains to mollify its Maori 
members over clashes on Foreshore and Seabed legislation and 
has spent a lot of time campaigning among this electorate. 
Maori compose 15 percent of New Zealand's 4 million people. 
Even before National's May up-tick in the polls, Labour 
leaders warned party members at their Party  conference that 
the loss of Maori support could threaten the Government's 
reelection.  But Labour's efforts to attract Maori voters, on 
top of the Government's proclivity to afford Maori special 
status in cultural and economic programs, alienates many 
lower- and middle-income voters the Government is trying to 
court. 
¶15. (C) Meanwhile, the Labour government's decision to 
negotiate a trade deal with China has drawn fire from both 
sides of the political spectrum.  The Greens criticize 
China's environmental and labor records; the trade unions and 
some business executives see a threat of even greater 
competition with low-wage Chinese manufacturers. 
 
--------------------- 
Partner or Millstone? 
--------------------- 
 
¶16. (C) A coalition will likely be needed for whatever party 
proves the top vote-getter.  Labour currently governs in 
coalition with Jim Anderton's Progressive Party and is 
supported by United Future on budget and confidence motions 
and by the Green Party on a case-by-case basis.  While 
National and NZ First have demurred on naming their preferred 
coalition partners, Labour has declared it would maintain its 
ties to the Progressives and strengthen the role of the 
Greens. 
 
¶17. (C) The Greens cooled their relations with the Labour 
Party when Labour allowed a moratorium on genetically 
modified agricultural products to lapse in 2003.  In recent 
weeks, however, PM Clark has joined Green Party co-leader 
Jeanette Fitzsimmons on the campaign trail.  While Labour has 
likely sapped some Green support with its student loan 
program, Labour wants the Greens to receive at least 5 
percent of the vote, the minimum required for a party to be 
represented in Parliament.  This would keep the Greens as a 
viable coalition partner.  By campaigning so closely with the 
Greens, Labour risks belying it's hard-won image as a 
centrist Party, however.  (NB: We will report septel on the 
implications for the United States of this and other possible 
coalitions.) 
 
------------------- 
Leader: Helen Clark 
------------------- 
 
¶18. (C) Helen Elizabeth Clark, 55, has served continuously in 
Parliament since 1981 and as Prime Minister since December 
¶1999.  She has served as Minister of Housing and 
Conservation, Minister of Health and Deputy Prime Minister 
and was leader of the opposition during the National 
administrations from 1993 to 1999.  She is a political 
survivor.  David Lange, the former prime minister who died 
August 13, wrote in his autobiography that Clark kept out of 
discussions of the economic reforms of the late 1980s.  While 
some Labour members suffered politically due to public 
backlash over the pace and breadth of the reforms, Clark 
emerged untarnished.  Many people forget that she was nearly 
toppled as leader by Michael Cullen, now the deputy prime 
minister, in the 1990s. 
 
¶19. (C)  With an approach deemed managerial if not 
micro-managerial, Clark is closely engaged in virtually every 
policy decision.  She holds nearly absolute influence and 
authority over her party and cabinet.  Such centralized 
control contributes to a dearth of young Labour 
leaders-in-waiting, raising concern in the party about who 
would follow Clark and Cullen.  Clark is believed to want to 
head an influential world organization after she leaves 
office.  Clark regularly beats National's Don Brash and other 
opposition Party leaders in polls asking Kiwis to name their 
"preferred Prime Minister."
