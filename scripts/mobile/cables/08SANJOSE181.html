 ¶1. (U) On March 4 we met with Alejandro Solano-Ortiz, 
alternate Director General of the Foreign Policy Office of 
the MFA, Raldolph Coto, Coordinator of the Foreign Policy 
Office of the MFA, and with Juan Salas, of the MFA UNSC desk 
to deliver the full text of the resolution and to seek their 
views in the subject. 
 
¶2. (C) Coto and Salas explained that as a member of the UNSC 
and supporter of the UNSC resolution 1803, the GOCR is well 
versed on the scope of Resolution 1803 and fully aware of all 
of its implications. The GOCR, Salas added, shares the USG 
concerns and views on the IAEA report (Refs A and B) and saw 
the resolution as drastic but meaningful tool to obtain 
compliance on the part of Iran to ensure that its nuclear 
program is strictly intended for peaceful purposes. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: There was no mention of "even-handed" 
non-proliferation treatment of Pakistan and Iran, as we had 
heard in previous (and higher-level) MFA conversations on 
this issue, nor concerns expressed about being seen as "doing 
the right thing." Also, Israeli colleagues here told us on 
February 26 that the MFA seemed very receptive to their 
demarche on UNSCR 1803, and in fact was soliciting ideas on 
how Costa Rica could be helpful on Iran. In our view, this is 
good news.
