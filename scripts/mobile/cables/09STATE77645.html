<br>MISSILE-RELATED ENTITIES TO PROCURE CLEANING UNIT FROM 
<br>FINNISH FIRM (S)

¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Embassy Helsinki, please 
see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (S) Background: In February 2009, the U.S. provided 
Finnish officials with information that Chinese company 
Shanghai Technical By-Products International Corp. Co. (STBPI) 
was working to procure an ultrasonic cleaning unit produced by 
the Finnish company Finnsonic.  STBPI and the Iranian 
intermediary Doostan were seeking this equipment on behalf of 
Ardalan Machineries Company, which is a procurement cover for 
Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG - Iran's liquid-fueled 
ballistic missile organization) (REF A).  We have not received 
a response from the GOF since we raised this issue (REF B). 
We therefore want to follow-up with Finnish authorities and 
request an update on the status of Finland's investigation 
into this case at the earliest possible time. 
 
¶3. (S) Action Request: Request Embassy Helsinki follow-up with 
appropriate host government authorities to request an update 
on the GOF's investigation of this case and report response. 
 
¶4.  (U) Washington POC is ISN/MTR Mike Kennedy (Phone: 202- 
647-3176).  Please slug any reporting on this issue for 
ISN/MTR and EUR/PRA.
