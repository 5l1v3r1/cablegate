The two sides made progress on finalizing a location for the new Egyptian Embassy. Egyptian Ambassador-designate Sherif Shaheen is not expected in Baghdad before September, but embassy staff are expected to arrive soon and reside at a temporary location. End summary. STRATEGIC DIALOGUE AGREEMENT ----------------------------
</p><p>2.(C) MFA Deputy Assistant Minister for Arab Affairs Ayman Zeineldeen told poloff July 13 that Egyptian FM Aboul Gheit and Zebari had signed a "diplomatic relations and strategic dialogue" agreement during Zebari's recent visit. The agreement enumerates a broad range of issues for bilateral cooperation, including political, economic, social and humanitarian affairs. Aboul Gheit and Zebari will head a joint committee that will meet annually; a sub-ministerial group comprised of various ministries will meet biannually, alternating as a preparatory and implementation committee.
</p><p>3.(C) Zeineldeen said President Talibani had broached the idea for such an agreement during Aboul Gheit's October 2008 visit to Iraq. President Mubarak subsequently approved, and the two sides finalized the draft text during the March visit of an Iraqi sub-ministerial delegation to Cairo (reftel). PROGRESS ON EGYPTIAN EMBASSY ----------------------------
</p><p>4.(C) Zeineldeen reported that after months of delays, the Iraqis had "suddenly sprung to life" and proposed an acceptable arrangement for the Egyptians to use two previously-identified villas as the new embassy. The Iraqis will pay for the necessary refurbishments, which Zeineldeen said will cost between 3 and 5 million dollars. According to Zeineldeen, the Egyptians will lease the buildings, but will pay no rent for the first five years. He noted the Egyptians will retain the lease on their property in Mansour and use that building for consular services. AMBASSADOR-DESIGNATE NOT IN BAGHDAD UNTIL SEPTEMBER --------------------------------------------- ------
</p><p>5.(C) Zeineldeen said Egyptian Ambassador-designate Sherif Shaheen will not arrive in Baghdad before September. However, mission staff (including a team to oversee refurbishment of the two villas) will arrive in Baghdad soon and reside in temporary quarters. SCOBEY</p>
