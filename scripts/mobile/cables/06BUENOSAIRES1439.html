¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: On June 22, the DCM, accompanied by Acting 
DEA Chief and POL Officers, met with Dr. Jose Granero, the 
head of Argentina's Drug Prevention Secretariat (SEDRONAR) to 
discuss recent reports that the Interior Minister had ordered 
several federal law enforcement agencies to stop working with 
SEDRONAR on counternarcotics issues, such as the interdiction 
of precursor chemicals.  The DCM also wished to gauge the 
GOA's stance on recent news reports regarding 
decriminalization proposals being considered in Congress and 
reported plans by Bolivian President Evo Morales to request 
that President Nestor Kirchner allow the import and sale of 
coca leaf and coca related products in Argentina.  Granero 
acknowledged that bureaucratic infighting may have 
contributed to Minister Anibal Fernandez,s directive to 
federal law enforcement agencies to limit cooperation with 
SEDRONAR.  Granero also discussed plans both within the 
Ministry of Interior and Congress to de-penalize drug 
consumption, and outlined his agencies efforts to block these 
initiatives. 
 
¶2.  (C)  On the issue of Evo Morales,s interest in having 
Argentina legalize the import of coca leaf and related 
products, Granero stressed that any such action would be in 
direct violation of a 1976 Argentine law prohibiting the 
planting, import or sale of narcotics, such as coca and 
opium.  He opined that any attempt to decriminalize the 
import of coca related products would be unconstitutional 
unless that law were first overturned. Granero, a friend and 
long-time supporter of Kirchner was clearly displeased by 
these proposals within the GOA.  He lamented that Cabinet 
Chief Alberto Fernandez was now openly advocating 
decriminalization and also made negative references about 
Interior Minister Anibal Fernandez,s support for 
legalization.  Granero's constant in-fighting with Interior 
Minister Fernandez certainly weakens interagency coordination 
and the overall GOA effort to combat illicit drugs at a time 
when the evidence suggests major increases in the flow of 
cocaine coming in from Bolivia.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
¶3. (C) On June 22, the DCM, accompanied by POLOFF and DEA, 
met with Dr. Jose Granero, the head of Argentina's Drug 
Prevention and Secretariat (SEDRONAR) to review bilateral 
counternarcotics cooperation, which has been excellent.  The 
DCM also took the opportunity to discuss recent reports that 
the Interior Minister had ordered several federal law 
enforcement agencies to stop working with SEDRONAR on 
counternarcotics issues relating to the interdiction of 
precursor chemicals. The DCM also sought Granero,s views on 
drug decriminalization efforts in Congress and reports that 
Bolivian President Evo Morales planned to request that 
President Nestor Kirchner allow the legal import of coca leaf 
and coca-related products.  The DCM opened the conversation 
with an account of his recent trip to Salta and Jujuy and his 
impression that the situation along Argentina's border with 
Bolivia had worsened considerably since his visit in 2005. 
He stressed that in discussions with high ranking Gendarmeria 
officials and several Gendarmeria and Aduanas enlisted 
personnel, they all acknowledged that both the flow of 
cocaine and the presence of Bolivian and Colombian narcotics 
traffickers had increased sharply in recent months.  Granero 
agreed that the situation was worsening since the election of 
Morales and stressed that Morales' twin policy of supporting 
the coca growers because of their indigenous roots while 
claiming to cooperate fully with international efforts to 
combat narcotics traffickers was an untenable position that 
could only worsen the trafficking situation in Argentina. 
Granero said he advocated more forceful international and 
regional efforts to point out the inconsistencies of his 
position. 
 
¶4.  (C) The DCM stressed the importance of enhanced 
inter-agency coordination on the counternarcotics front. 
Granero agreed, but stated that for several months his agency 
has essentially been working alone because the Interior 
Minister had issued written orders to the heads of many 
Argentine law enforcement agencies forbidding them from 
cooperating with SEDRONAR.  One of Granero's key staffers, 
Assistant Secretary Gabriel Abboud, added that a recently 
opened SEDRONAR office in Salta was not currently functioning 
because the Gendarmeria had balked at staffing the office 
 
with investigators as previously agreed.   (NOTE: DEA reports 
that the head of the Federal Police's Narcotics Unit has been 
ordered not to attend weekly meetings with SEDRONAR and 
senior Gendarmeria officers have stated that they have been 
instructed to avoid contact with the agency.  However, DEA 
and the DEA funded Northern Border Task Force (NBTF) continue 
to work closely with SEDRONAR and SEDRONAR continues to 
participate in DEA sponsored regional exercises.  END NOTE) 
 
¶5.  (C) With regard to recent reports that the GOA was 
considering decriminalizing small amounts of certain types of 
narcotics for personal use, Granero confirmed that the 
Interior Ministry was currently considering the issue and 
added that Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez was personally in 
favor of decrimminalization.  He added that currently the GOA 
was deeply divided on the issue and that his office was 
actively fighting these proposals both within the GOA and 
Congress.  He stressed that Kirchner himself was strongly 
opposed to decrimminalization, which would effectively block 
any legislative effort.  (Note:  We are not aware of any/any 
legislative proposal having been drafted or being considered 
on decriminalization.  End Noted). 
 
¶6.  (C) The DCM also expressed concern over reports that 
Bolivian president Evo Morales planned to ask Kirchner to 
allow Bolivia to export coca leaf and coca-related products 
into Argentina.  Granero stated his strong opposition to the 
idea, adding Kirchner was not considering any such action. 
He pointed out that a 1976 Argentine anti-narcotics law that 
specifically banned the import of coca leaf or coca related 
products.  He added that even if Kirchner was inclined to do 
so, which he was not, he would first need to pass a new law 
or cause the 1976 law to be repealed.  Granero said he saw 
little possibility of this happening. 
 
¶7.  (C)  COMMENT:  Granero, like Kirchner, is an ex-governor 
of Santa Cruz Province, and a strong personal friend and 
supporter of Kirchner.  Granero is a hardliner on drugs and 
is a staunch opponent of any decriminalization or 
legalization initiatives.  The growing rift between Granero 
and Minister of Interior Fernandez is troubling as itthreatens to greatly reduce the effectiveness of the GOA's 
counternarcotics efforts and coming as it does on the heels 
of increased narcotics trafficking from Bolivia, is a real 
cause for concern.  Post's law enforcement team will continue 
to engage the GOA at all levels in hopes of enhancing 
cooperation between the law enforcement agencies that report 
to the Interior Ministry and SEDRONAR.
