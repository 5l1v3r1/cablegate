1 (S) On January 26, we briefed Carlos Cordero of the MFA's 
Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and Organized Crime that 
the USG imposed sanctions on thirteen people and three 
private companies (reftel) for engaging in activities related 
to the global A.Q. Khan proliferation network.  We emphasized 
that no sanctions were imposed on governments and that the 
overall sanctions decision reflected the diverse and global 
nature of the network. 
 
Â¶2. (SBU) Cordero welcomed the action and added that this 
topic had been of top concern to FonMin Stago when he was 
Costa Rica's Ambassador to the UN in the past.  He told us 
that he would brief Stagno on this sanctions decision as soon 
as possible.  We also briefed Stagno's Chief of Staff, 
Antonio Alarcon, on this decision January 28.  Like Cordero, 
Alarcon was pleased to learn of the USG action.
