1.(C) Summary.  Econoff delivered the EGL points in REF A to \
a Swiss officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, \
Energy, and Economic Affairs on July 18.  The Swiss officials \
confirmed that EGL signed the reported multi-billion dollar \
contract with the government of Iran for 5.5 billion cubic \
meters of liquid natural gas annually.  The GOS added that \
EGL's contract and the proposed TPA pipeline to deliver the \
gas to Europe would help Switzerland diversify its energy \
supply, reducing its reliance upon Russia for LNG.  Hammer \
said that EDA lawyers determined that EGL's contract was \
consistent with UNSCR 1737 and 1747 and believed that the \
annual value of the contact would fall below the $20 million \
threshold wherein the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) could be \
applied.  End Summary. \

EGL Deal Signed, Contingencies are Business Confidential \
--------------------------------------------- ----------- \
 \
2.(C) Econoff raised the serious concerns the USG has with \
EGL's gas contract with Iran, during a July 18 meeting with \
Swiss Foreign Affairs Department (EDA) Americas Division \
Deputy Urs Hammer, Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SOFE) \
International Affairs officer Pascal Previdoli, and Swiss \
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) Middle East and \
African Affairs Director Rita Trier-Somazzi.  SOFE's \
Previdoli confirmed that the EGL contract has been signed and \
that it could be valued in the billions of dollars depending \
on the price of the gas and the length of the contract.  He \
said that there were uncertainties in the contract, as Iran \
has signed 15 LNG deals to date and did not have the capacity \
to meet all of its current commitments.  He told Econoff that \
the contingencies in the EGL deal were not disclosed to the \
Swiss government because they were considered business \
confidential, but added that EGL certainly included caveats \
 \
SIPDIS \
in the contract, given the unreliable nature of the supplier \
and the numerous commitments the Iranians have made. \
 \
--------------------------------- \
EGL Making No Investments in Iran \
--------------------------------- \
 \
¶3. (C) Previdoli explained that the EGL deal was approved by \
the Swiss and EU member state governments and was part of an \
European energy security plan to diversity the continents \
supply of LNG.  Russia, a country Previdoli described as \
non-transparent and prone to negative energy policies, \
remains unreliable, forcing Switzerland and Europe to arrange \
alternate suppliers of LNG to prevent a "cut off."  The Swiss \
government did not oppose EGL's deal because it was only for \
the delivery of 5.5 billion cubic meters annually and did not \
entail gas or petroleum investments in Iran.  The contract \
was also consistent with EU legislation and was therefore \
supported in Brussels. \
 \
-------------------- \
UN and ISA Compliant \
-------------------- \
 \
¶4. (C) EDA's Hammer explained that the Swiss government had \
examined EGL's contract because it did not want Switzerland \
to be in violation of UNSCR 1737 or 1747.  EDA's lawyers also \
examined the potential conflicts with the Iran Sanctions Act \
(ISA) and were of the opinion that the EGL deal would be \
compliant with ISA, since the annual value of the contract \
for the gas is not likely to exceed the annual $20 million \
limit. \
 \
----------------- \
Pipe(line) Dreams \
----------------- \
 \
¶5. (C) SOFE's Previdoli and SECO's Trier-Somazzi explained \
that the two trans-Adriatic pipelines under construction, the \
TAP and the IGI, were competing with one another and that \
only one would be economically viable.  The pipelines were at \
identical stages of planning and funding, making EGL's \
conclusion of a gas deal an important selling point for \
investors.  The TPA pipeline's financial future was much \
brighter, but not certain, as there are Russian and Italian \
interests pitted against it. \
 \

Comment \

 \
¶6. (C) Comment. The Swiss government firmly believes the EGL \
deal will benefit Swiss economic security, since it promises \
to diversify the Swiss gas supply away from Russia and \
introduce competition into the market, lowering prices.  The \
government also maintains that the deal is in full conformity \
with UNSCR 1737 and 1747, and lawyers were confident that it \
would not run afoul of ISA.  The Swiss government remains \
committed to the P5-plus-one negotiations and to ensuring \
that Iran not develop a nuclear weapons capability. \
According to the Swiss government, these objectives are not \
undermined by the EGL deal. \
