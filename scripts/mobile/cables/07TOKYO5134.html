¶1. (C)  Consul General Maher was in Kanucha, the resort 
development directly across the bay from the 
Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) site at Camp Schwab, 
November 1 and 2 to attend an ""Okinawa 
Kariyushi Wear Fashion"" promotion co-chaired by former 
Defense Minister Yuriko KOIKE.  He took 
the opportunity to meet for dinner with Kanucha Bay Resort 
Company owner and Chairman Takeharu 
SHIRAISHI and former Nago City Mayor Tetsuya HIGA.  Higa is 
the former mayor who agreed to 
accept the original SACO plan for relocation of Futenma to 
Camp Schwab, which is located in Nago 
City.  Higa is still influential in Nago.  Shiraishi is a 
close advisor and financial supporter of Okinawa 
Governor Nakaima. 
 
Nago Ready to Cave 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C)  Both Shiraishi and Higa made it clear that the Nago 
side is ready to accept the current agreed 
FRF plan, without the revisions that Governor Nakaima is 
calling for.  They are very concerned that 
further lack of cooperation from the Governor puts the GOJ 
realignment subsidies at risk for the next 
Japan fiscal year, so it appears to us that the GOJ's hard 
line position on the budget is working. 
Shiraishi also told Consul General that reports of Consul 
General,s October 31 local press conference, 
which noted that if the Governor were in fact to refuse to 
permit the landfill work in 2009 then it would 
mean an end to the whole realignment package, had ""sounded an 
alarm"" in Nago.  Current Nago Mayor 
Shimabukuro would like the Governor to say he supports the 
plan, but Shimabukuro is not yet willing to 
show leadership by himself saying he supports the plan prior 
to the Governor doing so.  In short, they both 
want the other to go first. 
 
Governor Nakaima Close 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Shiraishi says he will travel to Tokyo with the 
Governor November 6 in preparation for the November 
7 ""FRF Consultative Committee"" meeting.  Shiraishi told 
Consul General that he is strongly advising the 
Governor to cooperate with the GOJ on the FRF Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA), as are others. 
What the Governor needs, he said, are ""some pleasant words"" 
from the Government about fully taking 
Okinawa views into account.  Having said that, Shiraishi 
noted that at the November 7 consultative meeting 
both sides will again lay out their current positions.  So we 
can expect the Governor to take a hard line on the 
 
TOKYO 00005134  002 OF 004 
 
 
need for revision of the FRF plan (moving the runways 200 
meters to the ocean), and can expect the GOJ to 
repeat its position that the Governor should cooperate with 
the already underway EIA, and that only if the EIA 
demonstrates some scientific reason to adjust the runways 
should that be done.  But by the December 
deadline for the Governor's comments under the EIA 
procedures, he said, the Governor will be cooperative in 
officially stating his views on the assessment. 
 
¶4. (C)  COMMENT.  Shiraishi's views reflect what we have been 
hearing elsewhere in Okinawa.  The Governor is 
increasingly isolated in his stubborn insistence that the GOJ 
agree to revise the FRF plan prior to his cooperation 
with the EIA procedures.  His recent press statements show 
that he is becoming more flexible in his verbiage, which 
appears to us to be an attempt on his part to find a way out 
of his unfortunate campaign promise that the FRF plan 
must be revised in order for him to support it.  In light of 
this, it seems the GOJ's best approach would be to continue 
to take a hard line with the Governor.  The U.S. line should 
continue to be that we are expecting the realignment plan 
to be implemented as agreed, without any revisions. 
 
A One-Term Governor 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (C)  When Consul General asked Shiraishi about the 
Governor's health in light of his ""mild stroke"" in June, 
Shiraishi 
said he and all other LDP leaders in Okinawa are advising the 
Governor he must not run for a second term in 2010.  Even 
if his health is not a problem at that time, he would be seen 
as an aged and infirm candidate.  The problem, Shiraishi 
said, 
is that at the moment the LDP leadership has no idea who 
would be a good candidate.  Their preference would be the 
very 
popular Lower House Diet Member Kozauro NISHIME (younger 
brother of the recently defeated Upper House Dietmember, 
and son of a former long-term and very popular Governor). 
But Nishime has made it clear several times he is not 
interested 
in the position and prefers to remain in Tokyo as a 
Dietmember.  Shiraishi even went so far as to ask if the 
Consulate General 
could come up with a good suggestion for a candidate. 
 
 
COMMENTS BY FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER KOIKE 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
Former Vice Minister Moriya 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Consul General also had lunch November 2 with former 
Defense Minister Yuriko Koike at Kanucha.  She explained that 
 
TOKYO 00005134  003 OF 004 
 
 
 her feud with former Defense Vice Minister Moriya had 
nothing to do with policy towards Okinawa, since she agreed 
with his 
hard-line approach, and they had worked Okinawa well together 
playing ""good cop, bad cop.""  Their problem, she said, was 
over 
Moriya's empire building and his refusal to recognize the 
Minister as his boss.  The final straw was Moriya's scandal 
involving the 
Yamada Yoko company.  There had been rumors of this for quite 
a while, but while she was Minister it became clear this was 
a 
real problem, so she decided the time was ripe to remove him. 
 Koike told the Consul General it is certain that once the 
Diet 
finishes questioning Moriya, he will be arrested.  The police 
are just waiting for the Diet to finish with him, she said. 
 
FRF 
----- 
 
¶7. (C) With respect to FRF, Koike said she also believes 
Governor Nakaima will be cooperative with the EIA, although 
it will take 
another couple of rounds of Consultative Committee meetings. 
However, she admitted that as Minister she had given the 
Governor 
an informal ""promise"" that after the EIA is completed, Tokyo 
will agree to slide the runway 50 meters more towards the 
ocean.  But 
this can only come after the EIA, because if the GOJ were to 
agree to this now, the Governor would just ask for more.  The 
Consul 
General explained to Koike our aversion to revising the plan 
at all (the risk of breaking the consensus and making the 
overall 
realignment package impossible to implement).  Consul General 
asked her what happens if there were no scientific reasons 
resulting from the EIA to justify any revision to the runway 
relocation.  She responded ""there will be a different 
administration by 2009, 
so it doesn't matter what we've promised him."" 
 
¶8. (C)  COMMENT:  It concerns us here if the Governor is 
continuing to get this kind of informal wink on revising the 
plan from the 
current GOJ Cabinet.  We had heard rumors that Koike had made 
such a promise, and former Defense Minister Kyuma's repeated 
statements on flexibility to revise the plan also led the 
Governor to believe he could demand revisions to the 
realignment plan.  Koike 
told Consul General that Governor Nakaima and Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Machimura have a good channel of communication 
 
SIPDIS 
through 
former METI colleagues.   Consul General,s recommendation is 
that we continue to let Machimura know our view that this is 
not the 
 
TOKYO 00005134  004 OF 004 
 
 
time to be showing Governor Nakaima any flexibility on 
revising the FRF plan, although the GOJ does need to be 
polite to him.
