SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo told us the 
GOC continues efforts to contact FARC leader Alfonso Cano to 
start peace talks, but has made no progress.  Restrepo's 
contact with the group communicated with lower-level FARC, 
but has not obtained a meeting with the FARC leader. 
Restrepo reiterated that the GOC feels no pressure to begin 
talks, and will continue efforts to promote the mass 
demobilization of individual FARC fronts.  Father Dario 
Echeverri said the Church continues its outreach to Cano, but 
has not made contact.  Restrepo and Echeverri told us 
separately that prospects for renewed talks with the ELN are 
slim due to the group's internal divisions and the negative 
influence of President Chavez.  Meanwhile, a 50 member ELN 
splinter group demobilized in Choco department.  End Summary. 
 
 
PEACE COMMISSIONER:  NO CONTACT WITH FARC LEADERS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶2. (C)  Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo told us the 
GOC has made no progress in making direct contact with FARC 
leader Alfonso Cano.  Restrepo's "contact" exchanged messages 
with lower-level FARC who claim Pablo Catatumbo and Cano are 
interested in meeting, but added that "the security 
conditions" were inadequate.  If the contact obtains a 
meeting with Cano, his message will simply be that the GOC 
(Restrepo) remains ready to meet with the FARC to discuss a 
peace process. 
 
¶3. (S)  Restrepo said the GOC sees no signs that Cano is 
ready to talk peace.  The Cubans claim Cano wants to 
negotiate, but that FARC military leader Mono Jojoy remains 
opposed.   In intercepted internal FARC communications Cano 
consistently takes a hard line against the GOC and peace 
talks.  Leftist Polo Democratico Senator Gustavo Petro told 
us separately there is no chance of a peace process with the 
FARC, since the group is betting on outlasting President 
Alvaro Uribe and dealing with a new government.  Vice 
Minister of Defense Sergio Jaramillo also voiced skepticism 
about a FARC process, noting that in intercepted internal 
FARC communications, FARC officials said Venezuelan Interior 
Minister Ramon Rodriguez Chacin told them President Hugo 
Chavez' statement that the FARC should lay down its arms was 
tactical and did not signify a shift in GOV policy.  With 
continued Venezuelan support, the FARC would feel even less 
pressure talk. 
 
¶4. (C)  Restrepo said the GOC feels no pressure to start 
talks, noting that it would be difficult to envision a focus 
for the discussions.  The GOC does not want to negotiate 
political reforms with the group, but might consider a 
political/economic reform package parallel to a peace 
process.  Transitional justice issues would be extremely 
contentious, since most FARC leaders face serious human 
rights charges. 
 
CATHOLIC CHURCH CONTINUES OUTREACH EFFORTS 
------------------------------------------ 
¶5. (C)  Restrepo said the GOC authorized the Catholic Church 
to continue its outreach to the FARC, but has heard nothing 
from Father Dario Echeverri.  Echeverri told us separately 
that Restrepo's contact with the FARC is Henry Acosta, a 
left-wing politician from Valle de Cauca department.  He 
recently met with Acosta, who showed him a draft negotiations 
proposal prepared in November, 2007 by FARC commander Pablo 
Catatumbo.  Acosta said he had presented the proposal to 
Uribe, but received no response.  Echeverri said the contents 
of the proposal--including a constituent assembly-- appeared 
reasonable and could serve as the basis for discussions. 
Still, he conceded the FARC is much weaker today than ten 
months ago.  Echeverri added that the Church continues its 
own outreach to Cano, and believes these efforts have greater 
prospects for success than the Acosta channel. 
 
GOC LOOKS FOR LARGE-SCALE FARC DEMOBILIZATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶6. (C) With global peace talks with the FARC over the next 
two years highly unlikely due to the group's lack of 
political vision, Restrepo said the GOC will continue to 
promote the mass demobilizations of individual fronts.  FARC 
commander Fabian Ramirez broke contact with the GOC after 
Operation Jaque, but Restrepo said he has received an 
overture from the FARC western block operating in Choco, 
Risaralda, and western Antioquia departments.  The message 
was confusing, but Restrepo said the GOC will pursue the 
opening.  He added that the GOC was coordinating military, 
intelligence and negotiating efforts on the 9th FARC 
front--among others--to persuade them to demobilize en masse. 
 Vice Minister Jaramillo confirmed the GOC is targeting 
individual fronts to persuade them to demobilize. 
 
WORRY OVER FARC ATTACKS 
----------------------- 
¶7. (C) Military Operations Chief (J3) General Carlos Saavedra 
told us FARC capabilities remain limited around Bogota and 
other major urban areas.  Still, the August 14 bombing near 
Medellin that killed 7 and wounded more than 50 (reportedly 
carried out by FARC 18th Front), plus a series of small 
attacks near Bogota, has raised fears the groups could be 
planning an offensive--likely sing terrorist tactics rather 
than conventional attacks against military targets.  (See 
Reftel on EAC results.) 
 
ELN PROCESS GOING NOWHERE 
------------------------- 
¶8. (C) Restrepo told us the ELN appears committed to 
continuing the armed struggle, and dismissed prospects for 
renewed talks.  ELN Central Committee (COCE) member Pablo 
Beltran is trying to go to Havana to revive the 
Havana-Caracas air bridge for ELN leaders.  Petro said Uribe 
should be more interested in an ELN process, but conceded 
that restarting talks would be difficult due to internal ELN 
divisions, a lack of realism within the group, and the 
negative influence of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. 
Echeverri agreed the ELN remains intransigent, adding that 
the group's Eastern Block (Arauca, Boyaca, Casanare) has 
effectively declared its independence from the COCE. 
 
¶9. (U) The ELN issued a communique August 11 stating "it 
would be very difficult to move forward a peace process" with 
the GOC.  Meanwhile, 45 members of an ELN spin-off group, the 
"Revolutionary Guevara Army (ERG)," demobilized en masse in 
Choco due to increased military pressure.  The ERG turned 
over 31 rifles and other arms.  Restrepo said the group, 
which split from the ELN in 1990s and carried out kidnappings 
and other crimes in Choco, would be eligible for Justice and 
Peace Law benefits.
