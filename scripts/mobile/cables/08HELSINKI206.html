¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche to Johan 
Schalin, Director of the Finnish MFA's Asia and Oceania 
Office and Theresa Zitting, First Secretary on May 5. 
They said Finland expects Burma to hold and pass the 
referendum, albeit probably not May 10 in the face of the 
disaster caused by the cyclone. GoF does not welcome these 
results.  Their statement will be in coordination with the 
EU.  GoF hopes to emphasize humanitarian efforts.  Schalin 
stated that GoF currently accepts one-third of their UN 
refugee quota from Burma. 
 
¶2. (C) Schalin specifically noted that they support the 
UN's work and special envoy.  They believe the UN is the 
only organization that could dialogue and strategically 
involve the Burmese opposition to change the process and 
the regime's seven-step "roadmap to democracy" that the 
Burmese are determined to follow.  Burmese activists in 
Finland will host a conference June 6-7 in Helsinki 
including activists, politicians and civil society from 
inside and outside Burma.  The GoF expects conference 
participation from inside Burma based on Visa inquiries.
