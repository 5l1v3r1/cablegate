¶1.  (C) Pol-Econ Couns shared reftel points with Michael 
Swain, Deputy Director of the Security Policy Division at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  Swain 
expressed sympathy with our frustrations over caveats (NZDF 
force personnel operate without caveats in Afghanistan) and 
said NZ remains appreciative of US support of NZDF 
operations. 
 
¶2.  (C) Swain also said that GNZ Ministers will over the 
coming months be considering options for a future NZDF role 
in Afghanistan, as the current deployment is only scheduled 
through September 2007.  GNZ takes its commitment seriously, 
but Ministers have made it clear that NZDF must be able to 
cover all contingencies in the region, where New Zealand and 
Australia are the first and last resort.  Troops are in 
Solomons and Timor and now also Tonga, and events in Fiji 
remain worrisome, said Swain. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment:  Post will continue to monitor closely GNZ's 
review of its Afghanistan commitments and encourage a 
continued, meaningful NZDF presence.  Higher level 
expressions of encouragement from senior USG officials 
meeting with GNZ counterparts would also be useful here.
