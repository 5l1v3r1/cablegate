¶1.  (C) Summary:  New Zealand officials believe the situation 
in Honiara has calmed down, especially given the presence of 
stepped up RAMSI and local police security presence.  But GNZ 
worries about future flashpoints, such as the upcoming 
inauguration of PM Rini.  They also fear a possible spillover 
affect to the ethnic Chinese communities in other Pacific 
Island nations.  One possible upside to the Solomons 
situation, GNZ believes, is that it may impel China and 
Taiwan to look more seriously at the negative effect of their 
actions in the region.  New Zealand officials continue to 
look seriously at a long-term approach to the China/Taiwan 
factor, and would like to remain in contact with us as they 
do. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) New Zealand today began to send 30 police and 25 
soldiers to the Solomons Islands, to help RAMSI and local 
police efforts to stabilize the situation there.  Prime 
Minister Clark noted to the NZ media that the additional 
forces, sent to assist New Zealand's current contingent of 82 
police and soldiers will send " a very clear signal" to 
rioters. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) has 
also advised Kiwis to avoid all non-essential travel to the 
Solomons.  The Government has so far stopped short of urging 
the 200 New Zealanders in the Solomons to leave, but has said 
that military flights would be available to anyone wishing to 
do so.  All Kiwis in the Solomons are believed to be safe, 
although three NZ Policemen (and 17 Australian officers) were 
injured quelling the riots. 
 
¶3.  (C) Heather Riddell, Director of MFAT's Pacific Division, 
said the problems stemmed from the fact that the Solomons' 
Prime Minister is elected by successful MPs, "so democracy 
ceases to work well."  In other words, votes are bought.  As 
does Ref B, GNZ believes that Charles Dausabea's backers had 
a lot to do with rousing the crowds, as he was seen lurking 
around some of the outbreaks.  His party's MPs were also able 
to leave Parliament even as PM-elect Rini and most MPs were 
held there.  Riddell says that rioters burned down the 
Honiara supermarket (Wings) belonging to Rini financial 
backer Tommy Chan.  Most of Chinatown and many other ethnic 
Chinese businesses are in ashes as well. 
 
¶4.  (C) With the arrival of additional Australian military 
and police adding to a visible security presence, things are 
calmer now, says Riddell.  But Rini is due to be sworn in as 
early as today, so GNZ is monitoring the situation closely. 
Riddell, whose most recent foreign posting was Honiara, says 
that she fears the situation could flare up again.  She was 
personally shocked that the resistance to Rini was so 
determined, as normally protesters "get excited and then go 
home."  This unrest has lasted for days. 
 
¶5.  (C) Riddell says it is not clear how long the 
reinforcements would have to remain in Honiara.  The next 
step will be to get through the inauguration and get the 
government rolling again.  Once things are stable, RAMSI and 
the local police will investigate how the trouble started. 
Over the shorter term, GNZ is trying to assess the damage to 
the food supply in the Solomons, given that so many stores 
were destroyed.  Most people have gardens, but there may be 
shortages of rice and other staples.  GNZ will determine 
whether any assistance may be needed. 
 
¶6.  (C) Over the longer term, this episode has obviously 
created a real setback for the credibility of public 
security, and the balance between security needs and nation 
building will have to be reassessed, says Riddell.  She 
predicted another period of instability and uncertainty could 
arise when Rini selects his Cabinet, and indicated that some 
victorious MPs are unsavory characters. 
 
¶7.  (C) GNZ has not yet done a detailed assessment of the 
 
WELLINGTON 00000298  002 OF 002 
 
 
anti-Chinese sentiment unleashed in the riots, but fears that 
the problems could spread to other ethnic Chinese in the 
region.  Riddell said that GNZ officials would have raised 
general concern over China's actions in the Pacific Islands 
during Premier Wen's recent visit to Wellington, but not any 
specific examples.  GNZ is, however, continuing to work on a 
strategy for addressing the role of China and Taiwan in the 
region.  Riddell says GNZ continues to see the need for a 
constructive dialogue with Beijing and Taiwan, and the 
problems caused for the Chinese community in the Solomons may 
give a way in. 
 
¶8.  (C) During A/S Hill's March visit, NZ officials said that 
FM Peters would like the Pacific Islands to engage China and 
Taiwan as a group.  But Riddell said that if the recent 
PRC-hosted forum in Fiji was any example, this approach was 
unlikely to be successful.  She described the gathering 
(close hold) as "a lecture accompanied by laptops and some 
financial sweeteners."  What will be effective, she said, is 
if the Pacific Island Governments become disquieted enough to 
press the issue.  But as China now provides at least half of 
the assistance to the Islands, the governments are in a 
difficult position. 
 
¶9.  (C) Riddell nevertheless believes that a number of 
issues, including obviously the Solomons but also the problem 
of illegal logging in Papua New Guinea, are pushing the 
problem of China/Taiwan to a head.  Devising an effective 
strategy in response remains a critical priority for GNZ, and 
Riddell says MFAT would like to consult closely with post as 
they move ahead.
