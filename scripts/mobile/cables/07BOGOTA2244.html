Summary \
------- \
 \
¶1.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX told us French and Swiss facilitators had met with FARC spokesperson \
Raul Reyes and appeared optimistic they could persuade the \
FARC to agree to a "zona de encuentro" to begin talks on a \
humanitarian exchange.  The GOC was working well with the \
facilitators but saw no FARC movement to justify their \
optimism.  End summary. \
 \
¶2.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX told us on April 3 that Swiss official Jean \
Pierre Gontard and French diplomat Noel Saenz, on behalf of \
the three accompanying countries (France, Switzerland and \
Spain), met with FARC spokesperson Raul Reyes in early March \
and returned enthusiastic about prospects for starting talks \
on a humanitarian accord.  The two have recently traveled \
twice to the Central Cordillera, including Pradera and \
Florida municipalities, to consider potential sites for a \
"zona de encuentro" for accord negotiations.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said \
the two are apparently convinced Florida and Pradera \
municipalities would not be an appropriate site--due to the \
heavy GOC military presence--and are looking at alternatives. \
 They will meet again with Reyes in the near future to \
discuss potential sites, as well as the rules of the game for \
humanitarian negotiations. \
 \
¶3.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said the Gontard/Saenz effort represents a \
small advance because the FARC previously insisted that a \
demilitarized zone must be created before it would discuss \
the rules governing any talks.   XXXXXXXXXXXX said the GOC is \
working well with Gontard and Saenz, but is not as optimistic \
about the prospect of talks.  The GOC has not yet seen any \
sign the FARC has changed its stance vis-a-vis an accord. \
 \
¶4.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said the GOC welcomed the offer by U.S. \
Congressmen to accompany/be present in an eventual  "zona de \
encuentro," as well as their support for the December 2005 \
European proposal of a 65 square mile security zone.  The \
FARC insists it must have military control of any zone, \
because it fears the U.S. would try to seize its negotiators. \
 XXXXXXXXXXXX said the presence of U.S. Congressmen would help \
assuage this concern.  Uribe has asked XXXXXXXXXXXX to reach out \
to Gontard to urge him to contact Congressman McGovern or his \
staff.  The GOC wants Gontard to support the Congressmen's \
offer and to keep McGovern informed as the talks with the \
FARC progress. \
 \
¶5.  (U) In remarks at a Cali university on March 29, Uribe \
said he hoped the international facilitators would succeed in \
obtaining FARC agreement to a "zona de encuentro."  He \
reiterated his two conditions: that released FARC terrorists \
enter a GOC reinsertion program and do not return to FARC \
ranks, and that there be no "demilitarized zone." \
