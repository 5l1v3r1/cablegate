¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: On July 23 and 24, National Security Council 
Senior Director William Inboden and Senior Advisor Paul 
Lettow from the State Department's Global Affairs Bureau 
briefed the U.S. proposal for an "Asia Democracy Partnership" 
(ADP) (reftel) to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), and with John Hayes, an 
opposition party spokesman for foreign affairs.  MFAT and MOJ 
officials posed questions about how the initiative could be 
most practically structured and implemented.  MFAT officials 
stated that New Zealand was in complete agreement with the 
goal of ADP and is likely to participate from the beginning, 
though the GNZ has not yet made a decision.  At the same 
time, MFAT desires to continue discussions with the USG to 
address "modalities" and questions relating to the South 
Pacific.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------- 
ADP PRESENTATIONS 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Inboden and Lettow provided three separate 
briefings on the concept of ADP: to a roundtable organized by 
MOJ; to a roundtable organized by MFAT; and to MP John Hayes. 
 Imboden and Lettow first explained the genesis and purpose 
of ADP, which emerged from the lack of a central resource to 
coordinate and promote democracy programs in the Pacific 
region.  They explained that ADP would provide a forum and a 
structure for prioritizing and coordinating such programs 
among donor nations and for receiving requests for assistance 
from nascent and struggling democracies in the area. 
Membership in ADP would be by invitation only. 
Inboden/Lettow described ADP as being demand driven and 
modular, similar to the Tsunami core group, and explained 
that it would not function to raise funds, establish a 
secretariat or implement military or other sanctions.  The 
 
SIPDIS 
next step would be to establish an ADP "core group" at the 
upcoming Community of Democracies meeting in Bamako in 
November 2007.  That group would invite potential members to 
an organizational and planning meeting in January/February 
2008 at a location to be determined.  Inboden and Lettow 
reported that India was supportive of the ADP concept, that 
Indonesian parliamentarians embraced the idea, and that the 
Japanese and Canadian governments also favored the plan.  The 
Australian government, they added, is currently studying the 
proposal but is positive about it.

MINISTRY OF JUSTICE BRIEFING 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) Officials representing MOJ consisted of Gregor Allan 
(Manager, International Law), Boris van Beusekom (Senior 
Advisor, International Law), Stuart Beresford (Manager, 
Public Law), Malcolm Luey (Manager, Criminal Law), Kelvin 
Ratnam (Senior Advisor, Criminal Law), Chelly Walton 
(Criminal Law Team), and Professor Jim Veitch (Victoria 
University and MOJ Consultant).  The MOJ interlocutors 
commented that many small Pacific countries are already 
overburdened with reporting and fora responsibilities, some 
of them duplicative, and it is important to not add to that 
burden.  They also stated that ASEAN currently has hundreds 
of committees with plenty of talk and no action.  It would be 
counterproductive to undercut existing processes, though the 
proposal should move forward if the new process has a 
positive effect, perhaps using the Pacific Island Forum as a 
good model.  They also pointed out that some coordination in 
this subject is already occurring within the Asia Development 
Bank, and similar organizations. Adding the word "Pacific" to 
the title of ADP was recommended as well, if the organization 
is serious about including the entire region.

MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE BRIEFING 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4.  (C) Officials representing MFAT included Carl Worker 
(Director, Americas Division), Elizabeth Halliday 
(Co-director, Americas Division), David Taylor (Director 
North Asia Division) and Rupert Holborow (APEC Directors), 
Tim McIvor (Asia Division), and Rich Woodham (NZAID).  They 
raised several issues relating to ADP membership, and asked 
how membership would be determined?  Would only states be 
invited?  For example, what about Taiwan and Hong Kong?  They 
commented that use of the term "Asia" in the organization's 
title would not seem to cover Australia, New Zealand, the 
Pacific Islands or, for that matter, the U.S. and Canada, and 
suggested the term "Asia-Pacific" in the organization title. 
They also commented that a narrow invitation-only membership 
could create problems.  For example, Indonesia would 
naturally want to become a member, Malaysia would expect to 
be invited, and China might expect to be involved as well. 
They stated that China's response to ADP would be critical, 
and even the use of the term "democracy" within the ADP title 
could be problematic for China.  Furthermore, they asked how 
ADP would involve the large number of civil society 
organizations which play a significant role in supporting 
good governance within the region? 
 
¶5.     (C) MFAT representatives also expressed concern about 
duplication of effort, noting that ASEAN already works to 
address good governance issues among its members.  They 
suggested that ADP's integration within the ASEAN framework 
would be crucial.  Woodham of NZAID stressed the already 
ongoing efforts of the Pacific Island Forum's Secretariat 
(PIF) and its initiatives in building democratic institutions 
in Pacific Island countries as possibly being duplicative. 
MFAT officials emphasized that they supported the goals of 
ADP, but that the structure and process raised some 
questions.  In the words of one MFAT interlocutor, "This is a 
mine field.  The goal is fine, but the process and details 
will be difficult to work out.  The challenge is how to do it 
without creating more problems." 
 
¶6.      (C) Carl Worker, Americas Division Director, stated 
that the GNZ desires to be closely abreast of USG efforts in 
this area, and that MFAT will consult internally on the 
proposal.  He said he has every expectation that New Zealand 
will join on.  He asked that the U.S. keep New Zealand 
informed as planning for the initial stages of the ADP goes 
forward. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
INBODEN AND LETTOW REPLY TO MOJ AND MFAT QUESTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Inboden and Lettow responded to comments by MOJ and 
MFAT by emphasizing that the ADP would merely help to 
prioritize and coordinate programs promoting democracy in the 
region, and would operate without a secretariat or formal 
structure that might overlap or encumber the activities of 
other multilateral frameworks.  The ADP structure would be 
flexible and action-oriented, with the intent of 
supplementing the efforts of existing organizations, and not 
duplicating them.  Participation would also be "modular" 
(meaning that participants could opt-in or opt-out of 
particular programs as they desire) and demand driven 
(meaning that ADP activities would be determined largely by 
the expressed needs of nations requesting assistance).  NGOs 
and other civil society partners that support democracy 
programs would, of course, be invited to participate in ADP 
efforts.  Inboden and Lettow also recommended that the 
initial efforts of ADP should modestly target "low-hanging 
fruit" -- that is, easy to accomplish projects such as 
facilitating parliamentary exchanges, or helping to establish 
effective civil/military relations. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Regarding the name of the organization and whether 
''Pacific'' should be included in the title, Inboden and 
 
WELLINGTON 00000653  003 OF 003 
 
 
Lettow expressed openness to other monikers.  In any event, 
they emphasized that the name should not stand in the way of 
going forward and that the USG is willing to consider other 
titles. 
 
----------------------- 
MP JOHN HAYES' BRIEFING 
----------------------- 
 
¶9.  (C) John Hayes commented that the concept and goal of ADP 
would obviously receive widespread endorsement.  However, 
according to Hayes, the Pacific is already crowded with 
similar regional architectures promoting democracy and good 
governance.  Small Pacific nations have limited ability to 
participate in yet another regional forum.  He cautioned that 
any such initiative must demonstrate political accountability 
and the capacity to make a significant difference.  In order 
to produce gains, Hayes suggested that ADP must have direct 
ministerial-level participation and backing.  Inboden and 
Lettow both assured Hayes that the ADP would have full senior 
level support within the NSC and State Department. 
 
----------------------- 
LATER COMMENT FROM MFAT 
----------------------- 
 
¶10. (C) on August 17, in a subsequent private conversation 
between Carl Worker and DCM Dave Keegan, Worker stated that 
while the GNZ has not yet made a decision on ADP, he could 
not imagine that NZ would not participate.  Although, 
according to Worker, without Indonesia's participation it 
will be difficult for other nations to join.  He commented 
that the GNZ shares the same objectives with respect to ADP 
and is supportive, but the GNZ still has questions relating 
to "modalities" and to the South Pacific, and wants to have 
more constructive discussions on the subject when the USG is 
ready. "We're in much the same space on this as Australia," 
he added. 
 
¶11.  (U) Senior Advisor Paul Lettow has cleared on this 
message.
