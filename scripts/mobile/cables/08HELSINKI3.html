(C) PolChief delivered subject demarche to MFA Office 
Director for the Middle East Eija Rotinen January 3.  Rotinen 
welcomed the information we had to share regarding the 
Damascus Declaration National Council.  Very few groups have 
had success in promoting peaceful democratic reforms in 
Syria, she said, and any dissidents brave enough to press for 
such change should be applauded and encouraged.  Finland 
continues to support EU efforts to urge the Government of 
Syria to respect human rights and to release political 
prisoners.  The GOF has also made these positions clear in 
past bilateral meetings, Rotinen noted.  She could not 
commit, at this point, to a unilateral GOF statement in 
support and predicted that if Finland made a public statement 
of support it would be in the EU context.  However, she said 
she would recommend some statement of support, noting that it 
"should be in our common interest" to support such a group.
