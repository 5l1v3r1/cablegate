¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (SecDef) 
met with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi during an 
official visit to Rome on February 6, 2010.  SecDef thanked 
Berlusconi for Italy's pledge of more Italian troops for 
operations in Afghanistan and assured him that the creation 
of RC-SW will not intrude on Italian operations in RC-W. 
Berlusconi pledged Italy's full support for sanctions efforts 
against Iran, sharing SecDef's assessment of the dire 
implications should Tehran successfully develop nuclear 
weapons.  Berlusconi provided Italian insights on the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, encouraging strong American 
leadership.  SecDef said the issue remains a high priority 
for the Obama Administration.  In relation to the Abu Omar 
case, SecDef requested GOI's advocacy on recognizing U.S. 
jurisdiction over Colonel Joseph Romano under the NATO SOFA. 
Berlusconi expressed optimism that the matter will be 
resolved favorably during the appeals process.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------- 
Afghanistan 
----------- 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) Prime Minister Berlusconi opened the discussion 
with a lengthy discourse on the state of Italian national 
politics, assessing that his government is on solid ground. 
He asserted that ""Italy wants to be the best friend of the 
United States.""  SecDef explained that both Presidents Bush 
and Obama believed this to be true.  After briefly thanking 
Berlusconi for Italy's efforts in Haiti, SecDef applauded 
Italy's contributions to Afghanistan, noting that ISAF 
nations must loosen caveats to allow effective partnering 
with Afghan forces.  SecDef explained that once the U.S. 
completes its force increases, there will be nearly 60,000 
troops in RC-South -- too great a number for one commander. 
This was the reason for the proposal to split the command and 
create an RC-SW in Helmand and Nimroz provinces.  SecDef 
promised that it would not intrude on Italian forces in 
RC-West.  Berlusconi said he was satisfied that it will not 
be a problem. 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶3. (C)  As a prelude to a detailed discussion on Iran, SecDef 
briefly outlined the phased adaptive approach to European 
Missile Defense, explaining that a revised threat assessment 
and better technology had led to the new approach.  SecDef 
enlisted Italian support for a NATO commitment to missile 
defense at November's Lisbon Summit.  SecDef recognized there 
were legitimate questions about cost and C2, and promised 
that the U.S. would provide detailed answers soon. 
 
¶4. (S/NF)  SecDef recalled his long involvement in U.S.-Iran 
relations, including his participation in the first U.S. 
meeting with the new revolutionary government in 1979. 
Noting that every American president since then has tried to 
reach out to Iran, SecDef asserted that President Obama's 
approach has been the most sincere, energetic and principled. 
 He outlined the multiple opportunities -- including the 
Tehran Research Reactor proposal, the IAEA's inspection of 
the Qom facility, and multiple private offers for dialogue -- 
that Iran has been given to reassure the international 
community of its intentions.  All of these approaches, 
however, have been rejected by Iran. 
 
¶5. (S/NF) SecDef expressed deep disappointment in Tehran's 
lack of responsiveness, reminding Berlusconi that Italy's 
role is vital and pointing out the opportunity for 
leadership.  SecDef explained that it was clearly time for a 
new UNSC resolution, which would give nations and the EU a 
legal basis for even harsher action.  He recounted the dire 
consequences of a nuclear Iran, including proliferation by 
other countries in the Middle East, a military response by 
Israel at some point, or both.  Sanctions must be applied to 
get Tehran to change course and agree to a negotiated 
solution. 
 
¶6. (S/NF) Berlusconi agreed and recounted recent 
consultations with Israeli leaders, including military 
commanders, during his recent visit to Tel Aviv.  Recalling 
the tragedy of the Holocaust, Berlusconi said he believes the 
Israelis will not follow the path of some German Jews in the 
1930s, who discounted Hitler's threats as political 
demagoguery.  Given Ahmadinejad's promises to eliminate the 
Israeli state, Berlusconi speculated that Tel Aviv would 
strike, possibly with nuclear weapons, against Iran if Tehran 
were close to acquiring nuclear weapons itself.  He added 
that no one, including President Obama, could stop Israel if 
it sensed an existential threat -- noting his belief that 
Israel has operational plans on the shelf. 
 
¶7. (S/NF) SecDef cited an Israeli military exercise that flew 
842 kilometers to Greece, pointing out the distance between 
Israeli air bases and Iran's nuclear reactor is 840 
kilometers.  Berlusconi took the point, and asked the U.S. to 
exert strong leadership in pressuring Iran.  He added that 
Iranian actions against protesters were morally unacceptable 
and he cautioned that sanctions should not target the general 
population but instead aim to weaken the government.  SecDef 
explained the manifold business interests of the IRGC -- 
Ahmadinejad's ""storm troopers"" -- and his confidence that 
sanctions could be targeted against them without 
significantly harming the people. 
 
¶8. (S/NF) Berlusconi noted that Italian businesses have had 
interests in Iran for 50 years.  He referred to a 
particularly lucrative contract between the Italian energy 
company ENI and Iran that must be fulfilled in light of 
significant penalties for non-compliance.  He asserted, 
however, that ENI has chosen not to renew the contract 
because of concerns about Tehran's actions.  Berlusconi 
recounted conversations with Russia, saying he had lobbied 
them against missile production that can aid the Iranian 
military.  Berlusconi said he would soon attend an EU Summit 
to address Iran, believing that a preemptive strike by 
Israeli on Iran would be disastrous.  SecDef appreciated 
Berlusconi's sense of urgency, reminding him that history has 
consistently shown that tyrants are clear about their 
intentions and noting Ahmadinejad's promise to wipe Israel 
from the map. 
 
---------------- 
Israel-Palestine 
---------------- 
 
¶9. (S/NF) Berlusconi explained his efforts to get 
Palestinians back to the negotiating table by offering to 
host the negotiations and pay for all the costs.  He detailed 
an idea he had introduced in 1994 about a ""Marshall Plan"" for 
the region, whereby he would entice the world's biggest 
companies and hotels to invest in the West Bank and build an 
airport there.  He doubted Israel would allow investment to 
happen given the current circumstances, but said the offer is 
still on the table.  SecDef agreed that we must work together 
and stated that the Middle East Peace Process would be one of 
President Obama's highest priorities in 2010.  Berlusconi 
argued that the issue has global implications.  SecDef 
concurred, noting that the global security environment is as 
complex as ever.  He noted that we keep adding new problems 
like piracy to the list of challenges without solving the old 
ones. 
 
------ 
Africa 
------ 
 
¶10. (C) In a brief exchange, Berlusconi noted his concern 
about the Horn of Africa.  Because of Italy's colonial 
experience in Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea, it had an acute 
understanding of the depravity of the region that allows 
problems like piracy to take root.  SecDef commented that 
much of Africa had looked to the Soviet model in the 
post-colonial period -- an unfortunate choice that guaranteed 
poverty, and an error from which most of Africa has not yet 
recovered. 
 
----- 
China 
----- 
 
¶11. (S/NF) Berlusconi recounted a recent trip to China by his 
daughter, a recent U.S. college graduate, which left her 
distraught.  He explained that between urban migration and 
university graduates, China is adding 24M workers to its 
workforce each year.  Italy has 23M workers in its entire 
economy -- in other words, China annually increases it 
workforce by the total size of Italy's.  Berlusconi noted 
that many Italian companies will withdraw tenders if 
competing against a Chinese company, especially in Africa. 
SecDef noted that China has two major challenges.  First, in 
Africa, natural resource extraction using imported Chinese 
labor is causing significant resentment among African hosts. 
Second, in order to add 20-30M jobs to its workforce yearly, 
China must grow its GDP by 8-10 percent each year.  SecDef 
added that the source of internal stability in China is an 
improving quality of life for its citizens, and that Chinese 
leaders are ""scared to death"" that this is not sustainable. 
 
----------- 
Romano Case 
----------- 
 
¶12. (S/NF) In closing, SecDef asked Berlusconi for his 
assistance in affirming U.S. jurisdiction over Colonel 
Romano, one of the defendants in the Abu Omar case, under the 
NATO SOFA.  Berlusconi and Cabinet Advisor Letta assured 
SecDef the GOI was working hard to resolve the situation. 
Berlusconi gave an extended rant about the Italian judicial 
system -- which frequently targets him since it is ""dominated 
by leftists"" as the public prosecutor level.  Berlusconi 
predicted that the ""courts will come down in our favor"" upon 
appeal, noting that higher-level appellate courts are 
significantly less politicized than local courts.
