SUMMARY 
------- 
</p><p>¶1. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX slain 
human rights activist Yolanda Izquierdo, told us February 7 
that two persons with paramilitary ties, Diego Sierra and Sor
Teresa Gomez, were responsible for her January 31 killing in 
Monteria.  XXXXXXXXXXXX doubted human rights groups' claims that 
Izquierdo's murder was designed to silence victims prepared 
to testify against paramilitary leaders in the Justice and 
Peace Law (J&P) process, arguing that Sierra and Gomez 
murderedIzquierdo to retain land that they had stolen from 
her.  XXXXXXXXXXXX is receiving limited police protection, but 
fears this is inadequate to ensure his safety.  XXXXXXXXXXXX has 
requested an armored car and more bodyguards from GOC 
agencies that provide individual protection measures.  End 
Summary.

LAND GRAB LEADS TO MURDER? 
-------------------------- 
</p><p>¶2. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX slain 
human rights activist Yolanda Izquierdo, told us February 7 
that two persons with paramilitary ties, Diego Sierra and Sor
Teresa Gomez, were responsible for her January 31 murder in 
Monteria.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said Sierra was a front-man for fugitive 
paramilitary chief VincenteCastano.  Gomez is the 
mother-in-law of ex-parahitman and Vicente Castano henchman 
"Monoleche," married to a member of the Castano clan, and 
director of the Foundation for Peace in Cordoba (FUNPAZCOR), 
an organization founded in 1990 by paramilitary leader Fidel 
Castano, brother of Vicente and Carlos.Izquierdo was a 
leader of the Popular Housing Organization (OPV), a group 
that assists Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to reclaim 
land seized by paramilitary groups.  XXXXXXXXXXXX also 
represents 3,000 displaced persons seeking damages against 
paramilitaries. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed Sierra and Gomez ordered the killing 
over a land dispute.  Izquierdo's family was one of several 
hundred to have received parcels on 10,000 hectares of land 
owned by Fidel Castano in the early 90s.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
Fidel Castano channeled the land grants through FUNPAZCOR to 
gain favor with local families and to create a "buffer zone" 
against the FARC.  In 1995-1996, however, Gomez and Sierra 
ordered the families off the land.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said the two 
have been exploiting the land ever since, although Izquierdo
and other displaced families retain title.  With the start of 
the Justice and Peace Law process, Izquierdo and others saw 
an opportunity to reclaim their land and demand reparations. 
In response, Gomez began to press the families to sell their 
titles to her at below-market rates.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
Izquierdo had publicly opposed such a sale and had encouraged 
other families to do so as well, leading Gomez and Sierra to 
"silence her."  Judicial Police head General Naranjo told us 
February 6 the police had identified Sor Teresa Gomez as the 
intellectual author of Izquierdo's murder and expects to 
detain her shortly (Reftel). XXXXXXXXXXXX said the Judicial 
Police arrested five persons on February 9 in connection with 
the killing. 
</p><p>------------------------------------ 
LAWYER DISCOUNTS MANCUSO INVOLVEMENT 
------------------------------------ 
</p><p>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX doubted paramilitary chiefs participating in 
the Justice and Peace Law process were responsible for the 
killing.  Because Izquierdo served as one of two leaders of a 
delegation of victims who attended the voluntary confession 
(versionlibre) of ex-para chief Salvatore Mancuso, human 
rights groups charge Izquierdo's murder is designed to 
intimidate victims prepared to testify against paramilitary 
leaders in the Justice and Peace Law (J&P) process. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX said Mancuso has no connection to the land in 
dispute, while Gomez and Sierra are directly implicated. 
Izquierdo only attended the Mancuso hearing because she was 
considering seeking reparations from Mancuso in the event 
that Gomez and Sierra did not pay.  As a member of the same 
paramilitary block, Mancuso could be held liable.  Still, 
XXXXXXXXXXXX questioned why Mancuso would risk losing JPL 
benefits to avoid potential liability for the relatively 
</p><p>small reparations that would be due Izquierdo.  In contrast, 
XXXXXXXXXXXX did not rule out the possibility that fugitive para
chiefVincenteCastano was involved.  On February 6, Mancuso 
released a public statement condemning Izquierdo's murder and 
calling on the GOC to provide protection to victims. 
</p><p>------------------------------- 
LAWYER NOW RECEIVING PROTECTION 
------------------------------- 
</p><p>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said he had requested protection from the 
Colombian National Police (CNP) and had initially received 
two police officer escorts.  This was subsequently reduced to 
one policeman.  XXXXXXXXXXXX called this security scheme 
insufficient, and said he has requested an armored car and 
more bodyguards from GOC agencies that provide individual 
protection measures.  On February 5, the GOC convened an 
interagency meeting with the Director of the MOIJ Protection 
Program, the head of the Prosecutor General's Witness 
Protection Program, and the head of human rights with the CNP 
to discuss the threats against XXXXXXXXXXXX and possible 
protection schemes.  We will continue to raise concern over 
XXXXXXXXXXXX's safety with the GOC.
