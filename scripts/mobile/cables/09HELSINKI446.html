¶1. (SBU) Pol/Econoff delivered reftel remarks to Anna 
Salovaara, First Secretary in the Unit for UN and General 
Global Affairs at the MFA, and Kiikka Eela, Regional Manager 
for the Midle East Unit in the Bureau of Middle East and 
North African Affairs at the MFA.  Both GOF officials stated 
that 
the UN is designed to allow weak states/organizations to have 
equal representation against stronger states and that the UN 
is following its mandate when it allows resolutions 
specifically aimed at a single country.  Eela then stated 
that the GOF wanted to support Mahmoud Abbas by voting in 
favor of 
the Goldstone resolution and that the main thing that caused 
Finland to abstain from voting was the text relating to the 
 
Security Council.  Salovaara said that she wanted to, 
"Emphasize that it is a serious report and there must be 
follow up."  That being said, the GOF sees the Human Rights 
Council, not the Security Council, as the correct institution 
to undertake any follow up on the Goldstone report. 
 
¶2. (C) The two GOF officials disagreed regarding the impact 
that UN resolutions have on the peace process.  Eela stated 
that in bilateral discussions the GOF has been told by 
Government of Israel officials that UN resolutions do not 
have a significant impact on the peace process.  She 
questioned the need to be concerned over the number of 
one-sided resolutions, and even voiced doubt about the impact 
that the UN has in general.  Salovaara stepped in and 
defended the UN by asking what the process would look like if 
there were no UN in which to hold discussions between all 
member states. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Eela stated that the GOF wants to support the USG's 
efforts towards the peace process.  She asked that the USG 
provide to GOF general insight into the status of the peace 
process.  She finished by saying that the GOF, "Appreciates 
your efforts and offers sympathy for the difficulty of the 
task."
