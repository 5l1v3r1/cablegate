¶1.  (C) In response to reftel request, Econoff delivered 
demarche to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT) Asia Division and New Zealand's Financial Intelligence 
Unit (FIU).  At MFAT, Econoff spoke with Patrick Rata, Deputy 
Director for Japan/Korea Unit and to Brody Sinclair, Policy 
Officer for North Korea (DPRK).  Mr.Sinclair informed Econoff 
that New Zealand had implemented UN Security Council 
resolution 1718 via the UN Sanctions (Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea) Regulations 2006, which came into force 
December 15, 2006. Post will sent a copy of this regulation 
to contacts in ISN/CPI via unclassified email for reference. 
Regulation 15 of this document prohibits dealings in assets, 
money, or securities of, or derived from property of, 
designated persons or entities, and regulation 16 prohibits 
sending funds to designated persons or entities. 
Accordingly, existing New Zealand legislation already covers 
this asset freeze designation against: (a) Korea Mining 
Development Trading Corporation; (b) Korea Ryonbong General 
Corporation; and (c) Tanchon Commercial Bank. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Relevant New Zealand authorities, such as banks, 
have been notified of the new status of these entities. 
These additional rules were also conveyed to a New Zealand 
firm last week that inquired about procuring Calcined 
Magnesite (Magnesium Oxide) from a (different) company who 
sources this product from North Korea.  Because of New 
Zealand's strong anti-nuclear stance, Post is reassured that 
NZ officials will remain vigilant in applying the asset 
freeze.
