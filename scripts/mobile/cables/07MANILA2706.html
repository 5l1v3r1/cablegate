¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters raised iss 
Asian/Pacific safety and security, particularly concerning Fiji and the 
Islands with the Deputy Secretary August 1 at the ASEAN Regional Forum 
Manila, Philippines.  Peters suggested that the U.S. should limit its s 
and UN financing for the use of Fijian forces on UN peacekeeping missio 
protest the lack of democracy in Fiji.  Peters also reaffirmed New Zeal 
commitment to maintain troops in the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PR 
Afghanistan through September 2008.  He also affirmed support for the S 
Talks agreement and willingness to provide technical assistance.  Recen 
to the U.S. by Prime Minister Clark and Minister of Trade Goff have bee 
beneficial to bilateral relations.  The Deputy Secretary welcomed the i 
relations over the past 12 months.  END SUMMARY. 
 
REGIONAL POLITICAL CONCERNS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) FM Peters said New Zealand is particularly concerned about the l 
progress towards democratic reform and the disregard for the rule of la 
Fiji.  "There is not a committed path towards free elections." the Mini 
stated.  Fijian military leaders feel they are free to do as they pleas 
countries have ignored the current situation as nothing more than a "bl 
coup."  This could, however, have a ripple effect throughout Micronesia 
Clear, unequivocal messages should be conveyed to the government that 
democratic reform is needed.  While failing to address domestic reforms 
has made relatively large troop commitments to UN Peace and Security Fo 
Peters suggested that the U.S. limit its support and UN financing for t 
of Fijian forces on UN peacekeeping missions.  The UK should implement 
actions. 
 
¶3. (C) Peters raised similar concerns about the military leadership in 
Solomon Islands and plans to undermine the Regional Assistance Mission 
Solomon Islands (RAMSI).  New Attorney General Moti has a very unsavory 
including criminal convictions in Australia and allegations of corrupti 
actions are contrary to the desires of the local population.  New Zeala 
Deputy Secretary John McArthur added that "there is a real risk of inst 
and civil war, coupled with a resurgence of tribalism." 
 
SECRETARY RICE INVITED TO ASIA/PACIFIC FORUM 
 
SIPDIS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) FM Peters requested Secretary Rice's participation in the Asia/P 
Forum, indicating her participation would convey a strong message to th 
region.  Though the population may be relatively small, the area encomp 
more than a quarter of the world's oceans.  These relationships should 
overlooked, he continued. Secretary Rice's presence would also counter 
rising impact of the Chinese, who have been investing heavily throughou 
region. 
 
REGIONAL PEACEKEEPING TROOP COMMITMENT TO AFGHANISTAN 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5. (C) Peters reconfirmed New Zealand's peacekeeping role in Afghanista 
through September 2008.  Peters said, "the mission has been effective a 
efficient, and is going as well as can be expected."  The initial deplo 
consisted of special forces troops, but more recently has been transiti 
the Territorial Army (similar to the U.S. National Guard).  With milita 
commitments in 19 theaters, NZ forces are stretched thinly, he added. 
 
SIX-PARTY TALKS 
--------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Peters said New Zealand takes the Six-Party agreement very serio 
would like to see it brought through to conclusion.  New Zealand has be 
informally approached by the DPRK to provide assistance, but does not y 
a clear package of ideas to propose. New Zealand would calibrate its as 
to progress in the Talks and would like to participate in any way appro 
should the Talks be broadened to include other nations, Peters added. ( 
The MFAT website today added an announcement that Peters had accepted a 
invitation to visit North Korea.  End note.) 
 
¶7. (C) The Deputy Secretary closed the discussions by observing their b 
relations have improved significantly and may be at their most importan 
He thanked the Foreign Minister for his kind invitation to visit New Ze
