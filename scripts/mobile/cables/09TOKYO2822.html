¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  During a one-hour meeting, Minister 
Maehara outlined the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) 
government's plan to ultimately accept the existing Futenma 
relocation plan, with or without the support of its coalition 
partners.  Maehara cautioned that his government must first 
pass the 2010 budget, and that late April to early May was 
when the DPJ could forge ahead with the Futenma plan even if 
it meant breaking up their coalition with the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) and People's New Party (PNP).  Maehara 
said that Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada will deliver this 
message to the USG at an unspecified date.  (Note:  The 
Ambassador promised Maehara we would keep close the following 
information so please protect.  End Note)  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) Ambassador Roos met Minister of Land, 
Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism and State Minister for 
Okinawa, Northern Territories, and Disaster Prevention Seiji 
Maehara on December 9 at the Ambassador's Residence.  Maehara 
told the Ambassador that five DPJ cabinet members (Prime 
Minister Yukio Hatoyama, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi 
Hirano, Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada, Defense Minister 
Toshimi Kitazawa, and Maehara) met on the evening of December 
8 and agreed that they could not accept moving forward with 
the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) because of opposition 
from the DPJ's coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP).  However, Maehara said, CCS Hirano was tasked with 
working to get SDP and the DPJ's other coalition partner, the 
People's New Party (PNP), on board with the following four 
points of a ""plan of action"" regarding the FRF: 
 
   1: The GOJ would continue with the environmental impact 
survey for the FRF plan at Henoko. 
 
   2: The DPJ government would earmark funds needed to fund 
FRF in the upcoming budget based on the premise that 
relocation to Henoko would happen (to be called ""yobi yosan,"" 
or ""reserve budget""). 
 
   3: The GOJ would explore ""alternative options"" to the 
existing FRF plan that are acceptable to both the U.S. and 
Okinawan people.  The coalition partners would be involved in 
this process.  (Note:  We have heard that the DPJ does not 
expect USG involvement in this process of eliminating 
alternatives.  End Note) 
 
   4: If no alternative options are accepted, then SDP and 
PNP would agree to accept the Henoko option.  The two 
coalition parties would have to agree to be responsible for 
this coalition decision. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Maehara continued that even if the SDP and PNP do 
not agree to this four-point plan now, once the DPJ coalition 
government passes the 2010 budget and other budget-related 
bills, it will be closer to the Upper House election and 
because the DPJ values the U.S.-Japan alliance, it could then 
drop the SDP and PNP from its coalition before the election. 
People have been criticizing the two smaller parties, saying 
they voted for the DPJ, not the SDP or PNP, Maehara pointed 
out.  Thus, it could be politically advantageous for the DPJ 
to drop the two parties. 
 
¶4. (S/NF) Under this scenario, if the U.S. does not agree to 
any alternative to the existing FRF plan, the DPJ would be 
prepared to go ahead with the current relocation plan and let 
the coalition break up if necessary after Golden Week (April 
29 to May 5 in 2010). 
 
¶5. (S/NF) The Nago City election in Okinawa is likely to be 
won by a candidate opposing the current relocation plan, but 
it's not the Nago mayor who would grant permission for the 
landfill project, Maehara reminded the Ambassador.  Instead, 
it would be the Governor of Okinawa who would sign the 
agreement.

¶6. (S/NF) Ambassador Roos explained that the U.S. side had 
its own problems with Congress as well as a problem with 
Hatoyama telling POTUS to trust him but not following 
through.  Probed whether there was any way to get the deal 
done this year, Maehara said he was 100% sure that the SDP 
would not agree to go forward this year.  Maehara also 
acknowledged that the odds of finding a viable alternative to 
the existing FRF plan were ""virtually zero"" but said his 
government needed to go through the process despite further 
damage it might do in Okinawa in getting Okinawans stirred up 
even more. 
 
¶7. (S/NF) Maehara said that there were only two countries who 
enjoyed watching what was currently happening to the 
U.S.-Japan alliance-China and the DPRK.  He revealed that 
while at APEC in Singapore recently, he heard from 
journalists that many ASEAN leaders told POTUS they were 
concerned about what was happening to the alliance. 
 
¶8. (S/NF) Ultimately, Maehara concluded, PM Hatoyama is 
absolutely committed to the alliance.  People may think 
Hatoyama may be setting the stage for a plan to have U.S. 
troops stationed in Japan only in emergency situations, but 
this is not the case at all, said Maehara.  When asked how 
and when this message (of the DPJ's four-point plan on FRF) 
will be officially delivered, Maehara said the current 
intention is for the Foreign Minister to travel to Washington 
DC to deliver the message.  Exactly when it would happen was 
unclear.
