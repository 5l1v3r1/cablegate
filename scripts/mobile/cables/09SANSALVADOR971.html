Salvadoran Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Immigration
Authorities, and airline representatives. The Government of
El Salvador (GOES) was receptive and all parties expressed a
desire to prevent mala fide travel between Haiti and El
Salvador. The GOES expressed annoyance toward the Government
of Ecuador (GOE) after the GOE broke a promise made to the
GOES regarding a migration matter. END SUMMARY.
</p><p>-------------------------------------------
GOES ON THE LOOKOUT FOR HAITI-BOUND CHINESE
-------------------------------------------
¶2. (C) Joaquin Maza, MFA Director General of Foreign Policy
told Polcouns on October 7 that the GOES agreed with USG
concern about the risk of mala fide travel to Haiti by
Chinese nationals. Maza stated that he would reinforce our
message with Salvadoran Immigration Authorities.
</p><p>¶3. (C) DHS/ICE Country Attache and the Fraud Prevention
Manager (FPM) separately conveyed reftel points to the GOES
Director of Migration, Ruben Alvarado. During both meetings,
the Director discussed a case in which he had already denied
a transit visa for a Chinese national traveling en route to
Haiti and would continue to do so until directed otherwise,
which he does not anticipate.
</p><p>¶4. (C) FPM met with representatives of all the airlines
operating in El Salvador to discuss Haiti,s visa waiver
policy for Chinese nationals. The representatives expressed
doubt that many Chinese nationals would use this new policy
to travel between Haiti and El Salvador with the intent of
reaching the United States. Each airline promised to
continue existing information sharing with Post and to be
particularly vigilant with respect to Chinese nationals or
those traveling with PRC travel documents.
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------
GOES IRRITATION WITH GOE OVER BROKEN MIGRATION DEAL
--------------------------------------------- ------
¶5. (C) During their meeting, Maza told Polcouns that
President Funes and Foreign Minister Martinez are angered by
the GOE refusing to accept the return of 68 illegal migrants.
According to Maza, the GOES voted for the Ecuadoran
candidate for UNESCO Director General in exchange for Quito
accepting the return of these migrants who were detained in
Salvadoran waters en route to Guatemala from Ecuador.
</p><p>¶6. (C) COMMENT: We expect to continue close cooperation with
the GOES on this and other third-country migration issues.
Being left holding the bag by Quito only serves to reinforce
to GOES authorities the impact Ecuador's permissive visa and
migration policies can have.
