¶1. (S) Summary: Over a 17 July lunch, EAP Assistant Secretary 
Kurt Campbell and Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Deputy 
Vice-Minister for Foreign Policy Koro Bessho engaged on 
Russian interests in Asia, discussed greater Indian 
involvement in East Asia, and reviewed China-Taiwan 
relations.  End Summary. 
 
------ 
Russia 
------ 
 
¶2. (S) Noting that the Northern Territories issue remained 
""stuck,"" Bessho said that Japan did not see any real progress 
from Russia on the matter.  He said, however, that Japan and 
Russia have had only ""occasional"" discussions on the islands 
and that detailed talks have not been held.  Bessho said 
Japan may have to accept the status quo for now.  Bessho 
further wondered about Russia's intentions in Asia, given 
recent interest in participating in multilateral fora such as 
ASEM and EAS.  He noted, however, that U.S.-Japan-Russia 
trilateral discussions would be useful.  A/S Campbell hoped 
Russia's interests in Asia extended beyond a simple desire 
for deeper ties with China.  Rapprochement with Japan is 
essential, he added 
 
----- 
India 
----- 
 
¶3. (S) A/S Campbell said it was necessary to have India more 
engaged in East Asia and indicated a willingness to discuss 
Bessho's suggestion for a possible Track 1 trilateral 
dialogue between the U.S., Japan, and India.  Campbell 
proposed a possible policy planning staff-level discussion as 
another option. 
 
------------ 
China/Taiwan 
------------ 
 
¶4. (S) On Taiwan, Embassy Tokyo Political Minister-Counselor 
said Taiwan's leadership was focused on expanding commercial 
and transportation links between Taiwan and the PRC.  The PRC 
does not want to fight over the Taiwan situation and doubted 
there was much risk towards relationship problems in the next 
few years.  POL M/C noted, however, that Taiwan would likely 
ask the U.S. to sell F-16s to Taiwan and that this could 
potentially impact cross-strait relations.  In spite of this, 
though, a change to the status quo was unlikely, POL M/C 
added.
