 ¶1. (U) Ambassador Barbara M. Barrett paid a courtesy call on 
Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen on June 3.  Finnish Special 
Advisor, State Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Esko Hamilo 
also participated in the meeting. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Vanhanen expressed overall satisfaction with the 
US-Finnish relationship.  Vanhanen and Barrett discussed the 
current economic situation.  He said that Western European 
growth has been strong, with 
Finland leading the way due to significant trade with Asia 
and Russia. Vanhanen asked if the US elections would impact 
the timetable for US action on climate issues, especially 
leading up to the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
IPCC) meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009.  Ambassador 
Barrett reassured Vanhanen, reminding him that all 
Presidential candidates had addressed climate issues in their 
campaigns. 
 
¶3. (C) Ambassador Barrett raised US pharmaceutical industry 
concerns about unfair pricing regulations on patented 
pharmaceuticals.  Vanhanen called the issue complicated due 
to government limits on expenditures.  Hamilo then asked if 
Finland risks being added to the "Special 301" list for 
inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. 
Ambassador Barrett replied that resolving the issue prior to 
ever reaching that point would be best and asked if Vanhanen 
had any suggestions for resolving the problem.  Vanhanen 
replied that he would discuss the issue with the key 
stakeholders in the GoF.  Ambassador Barrett thanked Vanhanen 
for Finnish support in Afghanistan, especially in development 
and rebuilding.
