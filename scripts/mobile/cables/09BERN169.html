¶1.  (SBU) The Swiss Federal Counsel announced on April 8 that \
the first renegotiated double taxation agreement to include \
the new OECD Article 26 provisions on administrative \
assistance will be subject to an optional public referendum. \
Subsequent agreements will not be submitted to the referendum \
procedure unless they contain significant new obligations or \
departures from the first agreement.  Econoffs met with Swiss \
Department of Foreign Affairs Head of Sectoral Policy \
Coordination Manuel Sager on April 9 to discuss Switzerland's \
intentions in regards to the sequence for negotiating \
agreements. \
 \
¶2.  (C) Switzerland prioritized Japan, Poland and the U.S. \
for the first three negotiations.  The Japanese agreement is \
the farthest along, since it involves incorporating OECD \
standards into a Swiss-Japanese double taxation treaty, which \
is in the late stages of negotiation.  However, the Swiss are \
negotiating with the Japanese Finance Ministry, and the \
agreement is also subject to a full review by the Japanese \
Foreign Ministry, which could delay final approval. \
Negotiations with Poland began in March. and the U.S. \
negotiations will begin April 28.  Sager said that the \
Government of Switzerland does not have a tactical preference \
as to which agreement is completed first, but it recognizes \
that Japan and Poland will have an easier ride in the Swiss \
Parliament.  As reported reftel, post is concerned that the \
U.S. agreement could also have difficulties with a referendum \
given current negative public sentiment caused by the UBS \
case. \
 \
¶3.  (C) Sager stressed that Switzerland sees linkage between \
the negotiations of the tax agreement and the ongoing UBS \
case.  He commented that while a factual or legal connection \
may not exist, Switzerland definitely views the two as \
politically linked.  In Sager's view, it would be very \
difficult to get an agreement through the parliament (not to \
mention an expected referendum challenge), if there is no \
progress on the separate UBS case.  Sager admitted he could \
not propose a formal solution, but that the parties needed to \
come up with some ideas.  For example, he said if a \
significant number of UBS clients took advantage of the IRS \
voluntary declaration program, then perhaps the case would \
resolve itself. \
 \
¶4.  (C) In regards to the UBS case, Sager confirmed that \
Switzerland will file an Amicus Curiae brief with the court. \
Sager stated that the brief will be based on the grounds of \
Swiss sovereignty, the double taxation agreement, which is, \
in the Swiss view, the only means to obtain information in \
these type of cases, and under current Swiss banking laws. \
