¶1.  (C)  During a private dinner with Ambassador and Mrs. 
Garza, President-elect Felipe Calderon expressed his grave 
concern over the security situation in Mexico.  It was 
heartrending to see Mexico living through such times, he told 
the Ambassador, and improving security would be a key pillar 
of his administration.  The Ambassador agreed, noting that 
Calderon did not want his to be the "narco-sexenio."  Gains 
on competitiveness, education and employment could be quickly 
overshadowed by narcotics-related organized crime.  To draw 
the investment and energy needed to jump-start Mexico's 
economy, foreigners and Mexicans alike had to be reassured 
that the rule of law would prevail.  The Ambassador impressed 
upon the President-elect the need to have a strong security 
team in place early.  Calderon agreed completely and stressed 
his strong desire to continue and improve cooperation with 
the U.S. on security matters. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Calderon confided that he was disappointed with U.S. 
border security measures but would adhere to his commitment 
not to make these the central issues of the bilateral 
relationship.  His administration would continue to offer 
support to migrants in the U.S., but would not make U.S. 
migration reform its defining element.  Calderon reiterated 
his strong desire to work with the U.S., but also signaled a 
desire to re-establish better relations with Latin America. 
To that end, he would travel the first week of October to 
Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile and Brazil.  He 
pressed again for a meeting with President Bush prior to his 
December 1 inauguration, and after U.S. elections. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Calderon volunteered his grave concern over 
Venezuela President Chavez' antics and activities generally. 
He segued into worrying about the growing Iran-Venezuela 
nexus, offering that these ties could reverberate negatively 
throughout the region and beyond.  Neither leader could be 
trusted, and their capacity for trouble was almost limitless. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Comment:  Calderon hosted the Ambassador in his 
private residence, a fairly modest household in a compound of 
other privately-owned homes that did not seem to offer 
presidential-level security or privacy.  Neither was it 
staked out by the media, which covers his transition offices 
fairly aggressively.  His wife, Margarita Zavala, was also 
present during the dinner and discussed her role, looking to 
distance herself from the model set by Marta Sahagun.  The 
Ambassador was struck by Calderon's confidence, willingness 
to dig right into substance, and readiness to speak frankly 
about a range of challenges.  Calderon confessed he was 
unfamiliar with some key power centers, including business 
leaders, something he will work to remedy.  But he clearly 
has a strategy in this transition period of airing issues, 
defining near-term legislative and executive objectives, and 
reaching out beyond his core support group to bring others on 
board.
