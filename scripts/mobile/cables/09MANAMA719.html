(C) Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Undersecretary Abdulla Abdullatif Abdulla emphasized to Ambassador December 14 his government's progress in combating criminal activity related to trafficking in persons (TIP). He stated that the GOB would provide post with information on recent prosecutions and relevant sentences of TIP-related crimes, including those prosecuted under labor and other laws. The Undersecretary underscored that the GOB is "sincere" and "genuine" in its efforts to fight TIP, adding that the government is "working very hard to upgrade ourselves" (i.e., from Tier 2 Watch List to Tier 2). He added that the MFA would soon issue a report describing the GOB's steps to combat TIP, and acknowledging its shortcomings. Ambassador welcomed these steps and emphasized that timely evidence of progress in prosecuting TIP-related criminal activity would be key to an upgraded ranking at the next review.
