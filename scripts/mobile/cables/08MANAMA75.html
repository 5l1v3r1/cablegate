SIPDIS Al-Khalifa expressed strong support for the tribunal and Bahrain's commitment to working cooperatively to promote peace and stability in Lebanon, but said that limited resources meant that the GOB would likely not be able to contribute financially.
</p><p>2.(C) Al-Khalifa said that the GOB would continue its public and private support of PM Siniora's government, and agreed that obstacles to the presidential election must be removed. He added that it would be "absolutely unacceptable" for Hizballah to enter the government. Al-Khalifa said that "the time has come to talk publicly about Syria's uncooperative stance," and that he believed the Arab states would send a strong message to Syria at the Damascus Summit. He hinted that King Hamad would no attend. ********************************************* ******* Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI</p>
