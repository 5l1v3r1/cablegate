¶1.  (C) On November 12, POL/ECON Couns discussed Reftel B 
resolutions with Val Meyer, Deputy Director of the Human 
Rights Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT).  Meyer was joined by Tamsin Royson, MFAT's policy 
officer for Africa. 
 
¶2.  (C) Meyer said that New Zealand would likely co-sponsor 
resolutions on Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Zimbabwe, as long as 
the wording of the resolutions were not weakened 
unacceptably.  New Zealand would also probably vote in favor 
-- but not co-sponsor -- resolutions against the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DROC), Turkmenistan, and Belarus if 
the wording on these remained meaningful. 
 
¶3.  (C) Meyer said that New Zealand's small delegation in New 
York can only process so much information and therefore has 
to focus on what it or the GONZ knows.  Pol/Econ Counselor 
asked whether it would be helpful for GONZ to receive earlier 
any supporting information on possible resolutions.  Meyer 
said not really, as in general New Zealand will only 
co-sponsor resolutions when it has traditional ties with 
and/or diplomatic representation in the countries involved. 
Otherwise, New Zealand believes it is in no position to add 
anything in negotiations on the wording of such resolutions, 
she said.  The only other times in which New Zealand might 
co-sponsor a resolution is if the problems in the country 
involved were known by -- and of concern to -- the general 
New Zealand public.  This is why New Zealand did not 
co-sponsor the Belarus resolution, for example. Meyer said 
even if it does not co-sponsor, New Zealand will generally 
vote for Human Rights resolutions if the principle sponsors 
do not weaken the language "to blandness." 
 
¶4.  (C) Pol/Econ Counselor asked whether New Zealand has 
supported human rights resolutions against China.  Meyer said 
she could not recall, but added that New Zealand talks 
regularly with the PRC about Human Rights and does raise 
specific cases with Chinese officials.  GONZ officials make 
similar approaches to Iran, she said.
