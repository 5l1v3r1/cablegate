¶1.  (C) Summary:  Police Chief Aminta Granera is committed to 
counternarcotics and enforcement efforts as well as ensuring 
public safety, although she has no faith in the Nicaraguan 
judicial system and receives little assistance from other 
government agencies.  During meetings with Emboffs, Granera 
continued to voice her support for cooperative efforts with 
the United States, but serious coordination problems remain. 
In a recent meeting, Granera responded to Embassy concerns by 
agreeing to investigate allegations by Nicaraguan human 
rights leaders that they have been threatened due to their 
activities.  Granera also commented on the role of the police 
and stated that she reports directly to President Daniel 
Ortega and the Ministry of Government exercises little to no 
oversight.  End Summary. 
 
Committed to Counternarcotics Efforts, but More Coordination 
Needed

¶2.  (C) Police Chief Aminta Granera is committed to 
enforcement efforts and pointed out recent high-profile 
counternarcotics operations as a sign of police success. 
Granera has repeatedly stated her support for cooperation 
with the United States, however despite the recent apparent 
successes, some serious coordination problems continue.  The 
recent "Mexican cartel" arrests were planned without 
coordination with DEA and resulted in the detention of 
low-level "laborers and enforcers" instead of key cartel 
members.  The arrests of these individuals also preempted 
other regional operations and could jeopardize current 
investigations and future operations throughout Central 
America.  The Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) has also 
failed recently to coordinate fully with the Nicaraguan Navy. 
 The NNP arrested a number of suspects and seized 1,800 kilos 
from a fastboat off the Nicaraguan coast on April 24, but 
"neglected" to inform the Navy about the operation.  The 
National Police seized another 700 kilos of cocaine on April 
¶26. 
 
Politically Motivated Threats, Slow Police Response

¶3.  (C) During an April 23 meeting, Emboffs relayed their 
concerns to Granera about recent threats against leading 
Nicaraguan human rights leaders.  Members of the Nicaraguan 
Permanent Human Rights Commission (CPDH) NGO had reported to 
Emboffs that they had received threats (reftel) due to CPDH's 
championing of a case alleging human rights abuses committed 
against the Miskito population on the Atlantic Coast in the 
1980s by President Ortega and other prominent Sandinistas. 
Executive director Marcos Carmona recently reported to 
Emboffs that the threats had escalated.  Granera told emboffs 
that she was aware of the situation but that it was being 
handled by Juan Baez, Inspector General of the National 
Police.  She promised to check on the status of the case. 
Emboffs also informed Granera about several Liberal 
Constitutional Party (PLC) mayors who have been threatened by 
members of their own party for "straying" from the party line 
and she responded that they should file formal complaints 
with the police. 
 
¶4.  (C) When Emboffs questioned Granera about the recent 
Cervantes secondary school takeover -- when 14 members of the 
Federation of Secondary Students (FES) wearing hoods and 
under the command of Cuban-born Sandinista radical Victor 
Cienfuegos, stormed the Miguel de Cervantes school, allegedly 
using homemade pistols and other weapons, and removed school 
director, Juan Narvaez (septel) -- she argued that the Police 
did the right thing by staying out of the situation.  She 
added that during the incident they received telephonic 
reports from people on both sides of the confrontation and 
would have intervened if the situation had escalated.  She 
added that the police have to be careful about any actions 
around schools. 
 
Defining the Role of the Police 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5.  (C) Granera emphasizes the independent role of the 
police.  Though the NNP is technically under the Ministry of 
Government, Granera has told Emboffs on several occasions 
that she reports directly to Ortega.  Granera shares Embassy 
concerns about corruption in the judicial system and 
considers it a major obstacle to the NNP's enforcement 
efforts.  She also cited deteriorating relationships with 
other GON offices as an obstacle -- according to Granera 
cooperation from airport, immigration, and customs 
authorities has declined, particularly with regard to 
information sharing. 
 
¶6.  (C) Comment:  Granera maintains that she wholeheartedly 
supports U.S.- funded initiatives with the NNP, and she was 
instrumental in setting up the vetted unit; however, we have 
some concerns.  The lack of coordination with DEA remains a 
key issue, which Granera claims can be addressed by better 
defining the mechanisms for cooperation and the conduits for 
passing information.  We plan to pursue this further with her 
and her team.  It is also unclear how much autonomy Granera 
enjoys in running NNP operations.  We have heard that Granera 
maintains a close relationship with first lady Rosario 
Murillo, but is trying to remain autonomous from Ortega, 
which may become increasingly difficult.  Another concern is 
that Granera does not possess operational expertise and 
relies heavily on the Sub-Directors below her, who do not 
necessarily share her same commitment to cooperative efforts 
with the United States.  End Comment.
