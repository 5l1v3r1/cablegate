¶1. (S) DCM met with MFAT Deputy Secretary Alan Williams 
December 4 to present NIE and talking points per reftel. 
Williams said that MFAT would immediately prepare a summary 
for cabinet and the Prime Minister. 
 
¶2. (S) Williams commented that New Zealand has been clear in 
its messages to Iran in all fora that New Zealand will honor 
all UN mandated sanctions and that Iran must take the actions 
called for by the international community and the UN Security 
Council. It will be impossible for anything approaching a 
normal political or economic relationship until Iran does so. 
He added that trade between Iran and New Zealand is minimal, 
and even the scale of that trade is exaggerated by the record 
high prices for diary products, one of New Zealand's major 
export commodities. 
 
¶3. (S) Williams added that, while some may seek to use the 
new NIE to argue against U.S. policy, our willingness to look 
critically at earlier assessments, reflects "all that is best 
in America." The message he would take from the NIE 
conclusions is that this is not the time to relax the 
international pressure, including sanctions, on Iran to meet 
IAEA and UNSC demands.
