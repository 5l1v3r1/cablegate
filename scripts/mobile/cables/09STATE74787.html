<br>DYNAMICS (C-AL9-01454) 
<br>
<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>¶1. (C/NF) PRESIDENT FELIPE CALDERON'S SECURITY AND ECONOMIC 
TEAMS CONTINUE TO ATTRACT HIGH-LEVEL ATTENTION IN WASHINGTON. 
WITH US-MEXICO SECURITY COOPERATION CONTINUING TO EXPAND, 
WASHINGTON POLICYMAKERS REMAIN HIGHLY INTERESTED IN THEIR 
MEXICAN COUNTERPARTS. WHILE MOST SENIOR FIGURES IN THE 
MEXICAN SECURITY APPARATUS ARE WELL KNOWN, WASHINGTON 
ANALYSTS WOULD APPRECIATE CONTINUED REPORTING ON CHANGING 
SECURITY TEAM DYNAMICS, AS WELL AS CLARIFICATION ON SOME OF 
THE GROUP'S NEWEST MEMBERS WHOSE ROLES REMAIN AMBIGUOUS. 
WASHINGTON ANALYSTS ALSO WELCOME REPORTING ON HOW MEXICO'S 
TOP ECONOMIC POLICYMAKERS ARE PRIVATELY RESPONDING TO THE 
SOURING ECONOMY. AS TIME AND RESOURCES ALLOW AND DURING THE 
COURSE OF NORMAL DUTIES, WASHINGTON ANALYSTS WOULD APPRECIATE 
POST,S INSIGHT INTO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ON THE EVOLVING 
DYNAMICS OF CALDERON'S SECURITY AND ECONOMIC TEAMS. 
</p><p>¶A. (U) SECURITY TEAM: 
</p><p>1) (C/NF) WHAT ARE PERSONAL DYNAMICS AMONG THE MEMBERS OF 
THE SECURITY TEAM? HOW WELL DO THE PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF THE 
TEAM (I.E. GENARO GARCIA LUNA, EDUARDO MEDINA MORA, GEN. 
GUILLERMO GALVAN, ADM. FRANCISCO SAYNEZ, FERNANDO GOMEZ MONT, 
AND JORGE TELLO PEON) WORK TOGETHER? UPDATED DETAILS OF GROUP 
DYNAMICS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL, INCLUDING NOTABLE 
FRIENDSHIPS, ALLIANCES, RIVALRIES, AND SUSPICIONS. 
</p><p>2) (C/NF) HOW OFTEN DOES THE TEAM MEET? HAS ANY ONE FIGURE 
EMERGED AS A CLEAR LEADER/COORDINATOR? WHO ARE THE PRINCIPAL 
ARCHITECTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S COUNTERDRUG OPERATIONS? IN 
PLANNING SECURITY OPERATIONS WHO, OTHER THAN CALDERON, HAS 
FINAL SAY? 
</p><p>3) (C/NF) WHAT IS THE CURRENT MOOD AMONG TEAM MEMBERS? ARE 
THEY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE COUNTERDRUG EFFORT? 
DO THEY THINK THE FIGHT IS WINNABLE? ARE THERE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS OVER THE CURRENT STRATEGY OR FUTURE 
PROSPECTS? HOW DOES THE TEAM GO ABOUT CREATING A STRATEGY? 
WHEN THE TEAM HAS A SETBACK, HOW DO THEY GO ABOUT RECOVERING? 
</p><p>¶B. (U) ECONOMIC TEAM: 
</p><p>1) (C/NF) WHAT ARE THE CURRENT DYNAMICS WITHIN THE ECONOMIC 
TEAM? WHO ARE THE PRINCIPAL ARCHITECTS OF THE CURRENT 
ECONOMIC STRATEGY? ARE ANY PERSONNEL MOVES LIKELY IN THE 
NEAR FUTURE? IS ANYONE ON THE ECONOMIC TEAM CONSIDERED 
EXPENDABLE? IS ANYONE WAITING IN THE WINGS TO JOIN THE TEAM? 
</p><p>2) (C/NF) HOW HAS THE ECONOMIC TEAM RESPONDED TO THE STRESS 
THAT INVARIABLY COMES WITH THE JOB? ARE SOME MEMBERS COPING 
BETTER THAN OTHERS? IS ORTIZ,S DEPARTURE HAVING A MAJOR 
IMPACT? IS THE NEW DEPUTY SETTLING IN? 
</p><p>¶2. (U) PLEASE CITE C-AL9-01454 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
