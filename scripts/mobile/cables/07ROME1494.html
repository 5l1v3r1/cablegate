</p><p></p><p>SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C/NF) Rome Mayor Walter Veltroni's candidacy and near 
coronation as leader of the soon-to-be Democratic Party (PD) 
establishes him as an alternative pole of leadership to PM 
Prodi within the center left.  Veltroni, who successfully 
presents himself as a political outsider despite a lifetime 
at the center of politics, told the Ambassador he does not 
want to destabilize the Prodi government but that he sees 
parliamentary elections in 2009, or as soon as 2008.  If PM 
Prodi once had to worry about his radical left and centrists 
like MoJ Mastella bringing down his government, with Veltroni 
on the scene the core parties forming his coalition are also 
now looking beyond him. END SUMMARY. 
 
</p><p></p><p>WITH THE FUTURE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LOOKING IMPERILED 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
</p><p>¶2. (C/NF) The two largest parties comprising the reformist 
component of the center-left coalition, the Democrats of the 
Left (DS) and the Democracy is Liberty-the Daisy Party 
(Daisy), agreed in April to dissolve and form a new 
Democratic Party (PD) (REF A).  They subsequently agreed to 
hold a constituent assembly on October 14 to elect/select the 
Party Secretary and resolve the many policy differences 
between the two parties.  With the Prodi government stumbling 
badly at every opportunity (REF B) and persistent internal 
squabbling over the future structure, leadership and policies 
of the yet-unborn PD, center-left politicians were becoming 
increasingly pessimistic that a resurgent former PM 
Berlusconi could threaten not only the Prodi government but 
the viability of the future PD. 
 
</p><p></p><p>VELTRONI WAS DELIVERED AS THE PARTY'S SAVIOR 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
</p><p>¶3. (SBU) Rome Mayor Walter Veltroni, a former DS Party 
Secretary, has long been considered a likely center-left 
 
SIPDIS 
candidate for the premiership, and speculation that he would 
run for the PD leadership in October coincided with the 
announcement the PD would be formed.  By mid-June, Veltroni 
had received the public blessings of DS President D'Alema and 
Daisy President Rutelli, and Veltroni formally announced his 
candidacy on June 27 (REF C).  Recalling the image of his 
political idol, Robert Kennedy, Veltroni was spun as the 
savior of the center left. 
 
</p><p>VELTRONI TALKS OF TURNING THE PAGE 
---------------------------------- 
 
</p><p>¶4. (C/NF) Announcing his candidacy, Veltroni recognized the 
achievements of the Prodi government, but spoke of the need 
to turn the page, isolate the radical left and attract swing 
voters.  (Note: Veltroni admitted to the Ambassador in a 
meeting July 3 that marginalizing the far left could cost him 
as much as ten percent of the electorate, but that it was 
necessary in order to implement reforms and that he hoped to 
attract swing voters to compensate for the loss. End Note.) 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶5. (U) Veltroni announced four main goals: (1) addressing the 
increasingly problematic challenges of climate change; (2) 
developing a new compact among the generations to tackle 
outstanding social unbalances with an emphasis on poverty, 
long-term care for the elderly, social mobility (along the 
U.S. model), flexible postponement of the retirement age, tax 
reductions, improving universities for a knowledge-based 
society and a containment of fiscal spending; (3) addressing 
""precarieta,"" or the instability and frustration that Italy's 
youth face in the labor market which prevents many of them 
from establishing a family; and (4) improving personal 
security in large cities.  He confirmed these priorities at 
his July 3 meeting with the Ambassador.  Veltroni only once 
mentioned foreign policy in his 90-minute speech, saying he 
is against war. 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶6. (C/NF) Poloff met July 5 with Matteo Rebasani, Director of 
International Relations for the City of Rome.  Rebasani said 
Veltroni is pro-U.S, has close ties with Rome's Jewish 
community and would favor increased ""solidarity with Africa,"" 
and improved global health.  Rebasani further described 
Veltroni as a multilateralist and pro-EU.  Rebasani said 
 
ROME 00001494  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
Veltroni does not yet have a foreign policy team (or really 
any kind of national policy team) and noted that as the Mayor 
of Rome he has been able to avoid directly commenting on many 
of the foreign policy challenges of the past six years. 
Rebasani said any foreign/domestic policy team would have to 
take into account existing party positions. 
 
</p><p></p><p>DARIO FRANCESCHINI ON THE TICKET 
-------------------------------- 
 
</p><p>¶7. (C/NF) Daisy Party member and former Christian Democrat 
Dario Franceschini will be Veltroni's number two, as a result 
of a selection process that Veltroni likened to a U.S.-style 
electoral ticket.  Veltroni told the Ambassador he had 
selected Franceschini for party balance (Veltroni is from the 
DS and Franceschini is from the Daisy) and because 
Franceschini is from the North (Veltroni is from Rome).  A 
Franceschini assistant told Poloff July 2 that Veltroni would 
remain as Mayor of Rome for the foreseeable future as he was 
reelected only one year ago.  In contrast, Franceschini would 
likely step down as Ulivo Group Leader in the Chamber of 
Deputies and take over day-to-day management of the PD. 
Rebasani confirmed this probable division of labor on July 5. 
 
</p><p></p><p>VELTRONI ON THE VELTRONI EFFECT 
------------------------------- 
 
</p><p>¶8. (C/NF) The Ambassador hosted Veltroni for lunch at Villa 
Taverna on July 3 and asked Veltroni how he plans to 
coordinate with the Prodi government.  Stating that his 
relations with the Prodi government will be his most 
difficult challenge, Veltroni said ""Prodi is weak,"" and that 
he does not want to ""upset the stability"" of the government. 
Veltroni predicted the Prodi government would last until 2009 
and that elections would likely be held in the spring of 2009 
but said it ""could be as early as 2008.""  Veltroni continued 
that Prodi ""is not liked"" by Italians and added that if 
elections were held today, ""Berlusconi would clean up."" 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶9. (C/NF) The press has speculated that U/S Enrico Letta, 
Development Minister Pier Luigi Bersani, and others are upset 
with the apparent selection from on high of Veltroni as the 
future PD Party Secretary and might challenge him in party 
primaries.  Veltroni brushed off any concern, telling the 
Ambassador he was certain he would be 'elected' at the 
October 14 assembly.  Rebasani also said he doubted there 
would be any serious challenge to Veltroni's leadership but 
admitted that others might soon announce their candidacy. 
 
</p><p></p><p>PUNDITS ON THE VELTRONI EFFECT 
------------------------------ 
 
</p><p>¶10. (C/NF) Prodi's government continues to stumble, with 
pension reform proving particularly difficult (REF D), and 
other scandals periodically resurfacing.  As Veltroni put it, 
Prodi is weak, and no political analyst is predicting he will 
get stronger.  Veltroni's announcement that he would run for 
PD Party Secretary has sparked muted optimism in many 
center-left politicians (but not about the Prodi government) 
and expressions of concern from some on the center right who 
concede Veltroni would be a strong opponent. 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶11. (C/NF) Veltroni has a long history in center-left 
politics but after five years off the national scene as 
Rome's Mayor, he successfully sells himself as a political 
outsider and fresh face.  A former member of the defunct 
Italian Communist Party (PCI), Veltroni recently announced he 
was never really a communist to relatively few expressions of 
disbelief.  Veltroni is widely viewed as media savvy; he 
brought a major film festival to Rome and cleaned up Rome's 
once dirty city center.  Despite the fact that Romans 
complain that he has done nothing to improve Rome's crumbling 
infrastructure outside the historic center, Veltroni easily 
won last year's election with sixty percent of the vote. 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶12. (C/NF) Politicians and analysts from both the left and 
right say Veltroni presents a solid opponent for the center 
right whenever Italy next holds parliamentary elections. 
They are split as to whether Veltroni strengthens or weakens 
Prodi in the short run. 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶13. (C/NF) A minority says that Veltroni does not want to see 
the Prodi government fall in the near future.  They say it 
would be catastrophic for the future PD to be created 
precisely when the Prodi government falls.  As a result, they 
say Veltroni and current DS/Daisy leaders will want to keep 
the moribund Prodi government on life support at least 
through the difficult budget battles of the fall. 
 
 
ROME 00001494  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
</p><p>¶14. (C/NF) Most analysts predict Veltroni's leadership role 
will quickly eclipse Prodi's ability to manage the 
increasingly complicated center-left political balancing act. 
 More importantly, the future of the center left and its 
politicians will depend more on Veltroni's prospects than the 
fate of Prodi's current government.  Some say that Veltroni, 
and his new party, will want to take advantage of Veltroni's 
popularity and relatively fresh image to take on a center 
right led by the 71-year-old Berlusconi as soon as possible. 
 
</p><p></p><p>COMMENT 
------- 
 
</p><p>¶15. (C/NF) There is no doubt that Rome Mayor Walter 
Veltroni's entrance on the national scene has revitalized the 
center left and that his presence will increasingly challenge 
Prodi's leadership.  It is less certain what impact Veltroni 
will have on the moribund Prodi government's longevity.  Some 
say Veltroni will want elections as soon as possible in order 
to capitalize on his current popularity.  But he told the 
Ambassador he will need time in order to face the resurgent 
former PM Berlusconi on the right terms.  Until now, PM 
Prodi's main internal challenge has been the radical left and 
centrists like MoJ Mastella.  With the rise of Veltroni, 
however, the mainline parties of his center-left coalition 
are also looking beyond him to a new political alignment 
better able to confront the center-right. END COMMENT.
