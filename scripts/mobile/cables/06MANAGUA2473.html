¶1.  (U) Summary: With the results of 91 percent of the voting 
tables (JRVs) in, Sandinista Liberation Front (FSLN) 
presidential candidate Daniel Ortega holds a virtually 
insurmountable nine-point lead over his closest competitor, 
Eduardo Montealegre of the Liberal Nicaraguan Alliance (ALN). 
 Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) Jose Rizo is in third 
place, Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) Edmundo Jarquin 
in forth place, and Alternative for Change (AC) candidate 
Eden Pastora has less than 1 percent of the vote.  Last 
night, Montealegre officially recognized Ortega's victory 
during a news conference, and Jarquin issued a statement this 
morning.  The PLC still maintains that they will come in 
second place over Montealegre.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On the evening of November 7, the CSE released its 
fifth report on election results covering 91.48 percent of 
the JRVs.  Results for the president/vice president follow: 
 
FSLN:  38.07% (down from the previous report's 38.54%) 
ALN:   29.00% (down from 30.94%) 
PLC:   26.21% (up from 22.93%) 
AC:     0.27% (down from 0.29%) 
MRS:    6.44% (down from 7.25%) 
 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: These latest PLC numbers are raising some 
eyebrows.  They are several points higher than the first 
Etica y Transparencia (ET) quick count, which pegged them at 
24.15%, and beyond the survey's expected margin of error 
(1.7%).  The National Democratic Institute (NDI) examined the 
results and could not explain the anomaly.  END COMMENT.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Preliminary results for National Assembly deputies 
selected at the national level: 
 
FSLN: 37.59 
ALN:  26.72 
PLC:  26.47 
MRS:   8.69 
AC:    0.54 
 
Is the PACT over? 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5. (SBU) During a press conference on the evening of November 
7, Montealegre recognized Ortega's victory.  and visited 
Ortega in the FSLN's headquarters.  He was the first 
presidential candidate to recognize Ortega's victory.  During 
the encounter, Montealegre promised a constructive, 
intelligent, honest and democratic opposition for the next 5 
years.  Montealegre also predicted the end of the "pact" with 
the new balance of power and the ALN seats in the National 
Assembly.  (COMMENT:  Montealegre's acceptance of Ortega's 
win and his carefully crafted remarks made him seem the 
statesman in comparison to Rizo, who still has not recognized 
Ortega's victory and continues to claim that the PLC will 
place second. END COMMENT) 
 
¶6. (SBU) Jarquin issued a statement the morning of November 
8, recognizing Ortega, while pledging that the MRS is "here 
to stay."  He reminded Nicaraguans that 60 percent of voters 
did not elect Ortega.  He claimed this election signaled the 
end of the pact and promised to fight to make that a reality. 
 
 
¶7. (U) Consejo Superior de la Empresa Privada (COSEP) 
president Erwin Kruger recognized Ortega's victory and said 
that the private sector offers him its "vote of confidence." 
Gustavo Fernandez, the head of the OAS' electoral observation 
mission, officially recognized Ortega as the next Nicaraguan 
president. 
 
¶8. (C) PLC candidate Jose Rizo has not recognized Ortega's 
victory and maintains that the PLC will still place second 
over the ALN.  (COMMENT: With 91% of the vote counted, this 
is highly unlikely.  That said, some of our contacts have 
told us that the FSLN may have "pacted" with the PLC to alter 
the assignment of some of the National Assembly seats to 
favor the PLC to the detriment of the ALN, which might 
explain the discrepancy between the ET quick count and the 
latest numbers from the CSE.  However, ALN campaign chief 
Adolfo Arguello told us that Montealegre's recognition of 
Ortega's victory would ensure that the FSLN will not allow 
the PLC to manipulate the vote count in its favor.  FSLN 
Foreign Affairs chief Samuel Santos gave us a similar 
assessment.  END COMMENT)
