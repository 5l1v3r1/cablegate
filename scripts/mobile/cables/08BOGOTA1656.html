SUMMARY 
-------- 
</p><p>¶1. (U) Three Catholic priests and ten lay workers in Southern 
Bolivar said they were thV8=Q'yZth links to narcotraffickers Victor 
and Miguel Mejia (LosMellizos). The priests believe they were 
targeted due to their alternative development, human rights, and social 
organization programs which antagonize corrupt local 
politicians and narcotraffickers.  They said 
narcotraffickers have penetrated elements of the security 
forces--leading to human rights abuses--and complained that 
some African palm firms are using armed force to seize 
peasants' land.  The GOC met with the priests to discuss 
their security and committed to expedited investigations. 
Ambassador Brownfield visited the region on April 7 to show 
support for local alternative development programs and social 
groups. End summary. 
</p><p>------------------------- 
NARCOTRAFFICKERS TO BLAME 
------------------------- 
</p><p>¶2. (C) Catholic priests Rafael Gallego (Tiquisio) and Leonel
Comas (Arenal) told us on April 30 that they--as well as ten 
lay workers and a third priest in southern Bolivar--have 
received written death threats from "Commander Camilo" of the 
Bloque Norte de Colombia.  The priests said Camilo appears to 
be tied to narcotraffickers Victor and Miguel Mejia Munera
(losMellizos). (Note: The Colombian National Police killed 
Victor on April 29 and captured Miguel on May 1.)  Gallego
said they were targeted because of their work with rural 
residents on alternative development, human rights, and 
social empowerment.  Their projects receive funds from the 
GOC's Accion Social program, and are supported by Father De 
Roux, a Jesuit priest and head of the  Regional Peace and 
Development Program in Medio-Magdalena (PDPMM).
------------------------------- 
MILITARY ABUSES LOCAL RESIDENTS 
------------------------------- 
</p><p>¶3. (C) Gallego and Comas told us they suspect elements of the 
public forces are either directly supporting or turning a 
blind eye to the work of criminal groups and narcotraffickers
in the area.  They claim corruption is widespread among local 
security forces, noting that helicopters used by 
narcotraffickers in the region are clearly visible from a 
local military base.  Coca growers openly grow their crops on 
hillsides, and the military does little to intervene. Gallego
said the priests cannot prove the military is behind the 
threats, but noted that the language used mirrors military 
criticism of the priests as "warriors camouflaged as 
civilians who work against democratic security".  Gallego was 
previously threatened by paramilitaries in 2001 because of 
his support for the GOC's peace process with the ELN. 
Gallego added that the FARC also declared the priests to be 
"military targets" in the past. 
</p><p>¶4. (C) The priests report that human rights abuses, including 
extrajudicial killings and arbitrary detentions of peasants, 
by the military are also common.  Gallego cited the cases of 
demobilized FARC who work with the military and abuse their 
newfound power to intimidate peasants.  Former FARC commander 
"elGato" and former Revolutionary Army of the People (ERP) 
commander "Wilson" regularly wear Colombian Army uniforms in 
Arenal and Tiquisio and threaten local residents.  The 
priests report a general distrust of the local military--the 
Narino and Nueva Granada battalions--among the general 
population.  They added that the local offices of the Human 
Rights Ombudsman (Defensoria) do a good job in denouncing 
human rights abuses. 
</p><p>-------------------------------- 
ORIGINS OF THE REGIONAL TENSION 
-------------------------------- 
</p><p>¶5. (C) The priests claim key regional actors feel threatened 
by their work.  Many peasants recognize the danger of 
cultivating coca, and are eager to participate in the PPDMM's 
alternative development programs such as cacao and sugar 
cane.  Narcotraffickers, including former paramilitaries and 
the FARC, oppose these efforts.  In many areas, the FARC, 
ELN, and former paramilitaries work together on illegal drug 
deals. Comas said corrupt local politicians also feel 
endangered by the new political candidates that emerge from 
the Church's leadership training courses.  Palm companies use 
intimidation and threats to push farmers to sell their land. 
The priests noted that many farmers are struggling to obtain 
land titles, but when they agree to sell to the palm oil 
companies, local GOC officials quickly issue titles. 
</p><p>--------------------- 
GOC AND USG RESPONSE 
--------------------- 
</p><p>¶6. (C) Local and national GOC officials convened three 
special security council meetings on the threats to priests; 
the first two took place at the Governor's Office of Bolivar 
on April 12 and 19.  On April 21 in Aguachica, Cesar 
department, President Uribe convened a National Security 
Council meeting attended by Defense Minister Santos and 
Father de Roux.  Gallego said they also met with Presidential 
Human Rights Director Carlos Franco in Bogota.Gallego said 
the GOC committed to review the security profile of the 
threatened individuals, expedite investigations, and assist 
with security measures.  The priests rejected GOC offers of 
bodyguards, saying this would conflict with their pastoral 
missions.  The priests plan to return to the region after one 
month; they fear a longer absence would lead to the collapse 
of their programs. 
</p><p>¶7. (U) Ambassador Brownfield traveled to Santa Rosa del Sur 
in Southern Bolivar on April 7 to show our support for 
alternative development programs as well as local social 
organizations.  Father de Roux accompanied him on the trip. 
We will follow up with the GOC to underline our concerns with 
the threats. Polcouns spoke with Franco on April 30 and urged 
swift GOC action in the case.  We also promised to 
participate in a high-level visit to the region that is being 
organized by Catholic Church officials.
