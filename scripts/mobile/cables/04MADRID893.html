</p><p>¶1. (C) The investigation into who perpetrated the March 11
attacks in Madrid continues, with an Al Qaeda link looking
increasingly likely. While authorities cannot completely
rule out responsibility by the terrorist group ETA, or a
possible ETA role in coordination with an Islamic terrorist
group, the current major line of investigation is Al Qaeda.
</p><p>¶2. (C) Spanish authorities have detained five suspects, three
Moroccan and two Indian citizens. All three Moroccans are
said to have links to Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, who was
indicted for his role as an alleged ringleader in Al Qaeda's
organization in Spain. Authorities have reportedly linked
the three to the attacks as a result of tracing the cell
phone (the method used for detonation in the attacks) from
one of the sportsbag bombs that did not detonate. The three
Moroccans are Kamal ZOUGAM (other reported spelling: Kamal
ZOUGAN)(DPOB: 05-OCT-1973, Tangiers, Morocco); Mohamed EL
BEKKALI BOUTALIHA (DPOB: 05-JUN-1969, Achouta, Morocco); and
Mohamed CHAQUI (other reported spelling: Mohamed
CHAOUI)(DPOB: 26-JUN-1969, Tangiers, Morocco). All
reportedly have police records and Zougam was named in
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's September 2003 indictment of
Barakat Yarkas, though not indicted himself. Zougam
reportedly ran an internet cafe with Chaqui, his half-brother.
</p><p>¶3. (C) The two Indians arrested are Vinay KHOLY (other
reported spelling: Vinay KOHLY)(DPOB: 11-JUN-1976, Jalandhar,
India) and Suresh KAMAR (DPOB: 27-JAN-1972, Hoshiarpur,
India). Press sources say they sold the telephones to the
detained Moroccans.
</p><p>¶4. (C) On March 13, Spanish authorities were advised of a
videotape placed in a trash container near a prominent
mosque, located near the major M-30 roadway in Madrid. The
tape purportedly shows a masked spokesman, going by the name
of Abu Dujan AL AFGANI, who claims responsibility for the
attacks on behalf of Al Qaeda's military group in Europe.
The man reportedly speaks Arabic with a Moroccan accent.
Newspaper accounts state that high-level Moroccan security
officials will travel to Spain to aid in the investigation.
</p><p>¶5. (C) The Madrid Community Government reports that as of
today, the death toll from the attacks stands at 200. They
also list a total of 1,647 people treated for injuries, with
243 victims still hospitalized.
