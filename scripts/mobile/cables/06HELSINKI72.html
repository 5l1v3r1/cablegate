¶1. (U) European Correspondent Jarno Syrjala said Finland 
supports nearly all the views outlined in our pre-GAERC 
demarche (reftel).  His other comments of note follow. 
 
¶2. (C) IRAN: Finland views the cooperation of the EU, the 
U.S. and, to an increasing extent, Russia as very 
encouraging.  However, Syrjala cautioned, a move by China (or 
perhaps India) to block an IAEA Board of Governors' decision 
to report Iran to the UN Security Council would be a victory 
for Tehran and must be avoided.  At the GAERC, the EU foreign 
ministers will likely authorize a Troika approach to China, 
led by Javier Solana -- a move Finland, as a Troika member, 
fully supports. 
 
¶3. (SBU) KOSOVO/MONTENEGRO: Finland still supports efforts to 
resolve Kosovo's future status in 2006, even though some 
member states have questioned whether Rugova's death might 
force a delay.  However, Syrjala noted, should UN Special 
Envoy Martti Ahtisaari recommend to the GAERC a modified 
time-line, Finland will likely support it.  Syrjala agreed 
fully with our concern that developments in Montenegro not 
interfere with the process in Kosovo. 
 
¶4. (SBU) BELARUS: Finland welcomed the announcement that the 
GOB will invite ODIHR (Office for Democratic Institutions and 
Human Rights) election observers, but agrees that a 
fraudulent March 19 election and/or widespread human rights 
abuses must be met with increased pressure.
