¶1. (C) Summary: Although the GONL avoided inviting the 
Burmese to any EU fora during their 2005 EU Presidency, it 
insists such an invitation is consistent with EU procedures 
(per reftel).  The Dutch are not actively pushing to reverse 
the Finnish decision.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Poloffs delivered reftel demarche August 1 to MFA 
Southeast Asia Policy Officer Maurice Pourchez.  The MFA, 
according to Pourchez, will not seek to influence the Finns 
on the matter.  Pourchez underscored the strong Dutch 
aversion to the invitation/visa issuance but said that EU 
rules do allow invitations in cases where human rights in 
Burma may be addressed.  Poloffs responded that, according to 
Pourchez's own office, the Burmese foreign minister has 
relatively little influence within the regime and his 
presence at an EU forum can do little to further human rights 
in Burma. 
 
¶3. (C) Pourchez said that the GONL intends, during the 
summit, to be "very aggressive" in their criticism of Burma, 
thus having an impact on the attitudes of other ASEAN 
countries toward Burma.  Poloffs repeated to Pourchez our 
concern that proposed meetings between the Finnish PM and the 
Burmese FM, as well as the possible troika bilats with the 
Burmese, were likely only to lend legitimacy to the Burmese 
regime. 
 
¶4. (C) Pourchez further defended the GONL's (and the EU's) 
approach, saying that ASEAN has previously threatened to not 
cooperate with the EU, if individual AEAN members were 
excluded from ASEM and other fora.  The GONL, he said, 
therefore feels compelled to deal with Burma, even while 
trying to keep the focus on human rights. 
 
¶5. (C) DCM and PolCouns separately reiterated reftel points 
with acting Director General for Political Affairs Wim 
Geerts.  DCM reminded Geerts that the Dutch had made a point 
of not inviting the Burmese during their 2005 EU Presidency. 
Geerts acknowledged this, but did not indicate that the Dutch 
intended to take a strong stand against Burmese attendance at 
the ASEM meeting.  He underscored, however, the GONL's own 
strong stance on Burma's human rights record.
