Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) The GOC submitted to Congress on March 4, its revised 
Law for Justice and Peace, based on input from Peace 
Commissioner Restrepo, the Deputy Prosecutor General, 
"Uribista" congressmen, and others.  Formal debate began in 
the Senate and House First Committees on March 8.  The draft 
Law for Justice and Peace applies to members of an illegal 
armed group (IAG) who are guilty of major crimes.  It imposes 
a five to eight year term of incarceration, mandatory 
reparations, and supervised parole for individuals who are 
fully investigated by the Prosecutor General's Office and 
meet specific requirements.  These include demobilizing, 
ceasing all acts of intimidation and illegal activities, 
surrendering all illicit assets, and not having belonged to 
an organization created for the purpose of drug trafficking. 
The text states that failure to fulfill any of the conditions 
would result in revocation of benefits.  Demobilizing 
individuals guilty only of membership in an IAG and lesser, 
related crimes will be pardoned under current legislation 
(Law 782).  End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
GOC Revises Draft 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (C) The GOC revised its demobilization law based on input 
from the Peace Commissioner, the Deputy Prosecutor General 
(Vice Fiscal), "Uribista" Congressmen, and several others in 
an attempt to maximize support and address criticisms.  Peace 
Commissioner Restrepo was particularly active in suggesting 
changes. 
 
------- 
Law 782 
------- 
 
¶3. (C) Demobilizing individuals fall into two groups: those 
implicated only in membership in an IAG and those implicated 
in major crimes.  Law 782 authorizes the government to pardon 
demobilizing IAG members for their membership in the illegal 
organization and various lesser, related crimes, such as 
illegal possession of a firearm.  Restrepo has repeatedly 
said that Law 782 effectively facilitates demobilization, and 
should remain in force. 
 
¶4. (U) According to Law 782, the Prosecutor General's Office 
("Fiscalia") does a background check and interviews each 
demobilizing IAG member to determine if he is implicated in 
non-pardonable crimes.  The interview is called a "version 
libre," or open statement.  If the authorities confirm that 
the individual is only guilty of membership in an IAG and 
lesser, related crimes, he is placed on probation ("libertad 
condicional") for two years.  If he commits another crime 
during this period, his pardon is revoked and he is arrested 
for the new crime and his pardoned crimes.  After a 
successful two-year probation period, the individual is given 
definitive liberty. 
 
------------------------- 
Law for Justice and Peace 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Law for Justice and Peace will apply to 
demobilized IAG members accused of major crimes.  The basic 
steps of the law are: 
 
(1) The GOC submits the names of demobilizing individuals to 
a special unit of the Fiscalia.  IAG members who demobilize 
collectively or individually as deserters are eligible. 
 
(2) The Fiscalia opens an investigation and prosecution 
process against each individual, with assistance from the 
Judicial and Investigative Police.  Each individual gives a 
"version libre" to the Fiscalia.  The Fiscalia reports its 
findings to the Superior District Court ("Tribunal Superior 
de Distrito Judicial") responsible for the case. 
 
(3) A chamber from the District Court issues a full sentence 
based on the normal criminal code and an alternative sentence 
for each individual.  The alternative sentence includes five 
to eight years of confinement (including up to 18 months in a 
concentration zone) and required reparations. 
 
(4) After completing time in confinement, the individual is 
on supervised parole for a length of time equal to twenty 
percent of his term of incarceration, equivalent to between 
one year and 19 months.  During this time, he must report 
periodically to the District Court, report any change of 
address, not commit any crimes, and generally behave well. 
 
(5) If the District Court chamber determines that an 
individual has fulfilled all the conditions of the law, 
including payment of reparations, he is given definitive 
liberty.  According to the law's text, if he fails to meet 
any of the law's terms, his benefits are revoked and he will 
serve his original sentence according to the normal criminal 
code. 
 
¶6. (C) The GOC included several important conditions in the 
law to ensure full compliance, prevent impunity, and 
facilitate implementation: 
 
-- Eligibility Requirements: the individuals must have (1) 
demobilized or belonged to an IAG that agreed to demobilize 
and is fully dismantled; (2) surrendered all illicit assets; 
(3) turned over all minors; (4) ceased all illicit activities 
and interference in the free exercise of political rights and 
other public liberties; and (5) not have belonged to an IAG 
that was created for the purposes of drug trafficking or 
illicit enrichment. 
 
-- Imprisonment: The sentence cannot be reduced by work or 
study.  Regardless, all beneficiaries are required to work, 
study, and support demobilization and other peace initiatives 
while in confinement.  The government will determine where 
the period of confinement is spent.  All confinement centers 
must meet National Prison and Penitentiary Institute (INPEC) 
standards.  Time spent in a concentration zone can count 
against the sentence for up to 18 months. 
 
-- Failure to Confess: If, at any time, the Fiscalia 
determines that an individual is guilty of a crime which he 
did not include in his "version libre" or accept when accused 
by the Fiscalia, he will be tried and sentenced for the crime 
consistent with the normal criminal code.  However, if the 
individual subsequently admits to the crime, he is still 
eligible for an alternative sentence. 
 
-- Extradition: The GOC retained a clause allowing the 
alternative sentence to be served overseas.  This is an added 
safeguard for our ability to extradite individuals eligible 
to benefit from the law.  The GOC has repeatedly assured us 
that the law will not impede extradition. 
 
-- Intimidation: The GOC added a stand-alone clause that if 
the individual attempts to corrupt or intimidate any 
government authority, he loses all benefits. 
 
-- Reparations: The District Court determines material and 
symbolic reparations.  The Inspector General's Office 
(Procuraduria) will create a special unit to verify that 
victims' rights are fully respected.  This unit can receive 
input from NGOs.  The GOC will also create a reparations 
fund, managed by the Social Solidarity Network (RSS). 
Regional commissions will be created to oversee local land 
and property reparations. 
 
-- Oversight: The GOC will create a National Reparations and 
Reconciliation Commission to oversee the alternative 
sentencing and reparations process.  The Commission can 
recommend revocation of benefits to the District Court if the 
individual fails to fulfill any of the law's conditions.  The 
Commission will create a public report on the development and 
activities of IAGs. 
-- Public Access: The District Court is responsible for 
recording all proceedings against each individual and 
guaranteeing public access.  The Inspector General's Office 
will oversee the granting of public access. 
 
-- Law 782: The law specifically states that anyone eligible 
for pardon under Law 782 will not be dealt with by the Law 
for Justice and Peace. 
 
---------- 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
¶7. (C) The debate began in the Senate and House First 
Committees on March 8.  The GOC is optimistic that a law will 
be passed as early as April or, at the latest, by June.  The 
debate will be difficult given that nine other drafts have 
been presented, including Senator Rafael Pardo's 
well-publicized Law for Truth, Justice, and Reparations.  The 
law deals with complex issues that could impact future peace 
processes with other IAGs for decades.  See septel on 
Congressional views of and support for the law.
