¶1. (C) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Finnish MFA 
Counterterrorism Coordinator Pekka Oinonen Oct. 29.  Oinonen 
welcomed our views as a follow-up to recent PKK-related 
demarches and said that Finland )- as a longtime friend of 
Turkey )- was following developments with great concern.  He 
welcomed US efforts to work with the Turkish and Iraqi 
governments to urge restraint and non-military efforts to 
defuse the PKK threat. 
 
¶2. (S) Oinonen noted that there are approximately 3500 Kurds 
in Finland, roughly half from Iran and half from Iraq.  There 
are very few Turkish Kurds in Finland, and little evidence to 
suggest that the PKK is engaged in extensive fundraising 
here.  However, Oinonen said that there have been some press 
and other reports from Ankara accusing a London-based NGO, 
the Kurdistan Human Rights Organization, of seeking to raise 
funds in the Nordic region.  The GOF has not found proof of 
this type of activity here but is watching.
