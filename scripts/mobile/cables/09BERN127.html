SWISS PLANNING NO CHANGES IN KFOR CONTRIBUTION \
--------------------------------------------- - \
 \
¶1. (C) Acting POL-ECON Counselor and DAO representative \
delivered the reftel message on March 19 to Marlene Odermatt, \
Policy Advisor for International Relations and Strategy at \
the Swiss Federal Ministry of Defense.  Odermatt said that \
Switzerland has no plans to change its current force \
contribution to KFOR.  In collegial but appropriately \
cautious fashion, she referred to the fact that current Swiss \
DefMin Ueli Maurer generally espouses his Swiss People's \
Party (SVP) aversion to foreign deployments.  However, \
Odermatt underlined that DefMin Maurer is well aware of the \
importance of Balkan security to Swiss interests, given the \
region's proximity to Switzerland and the large Kosovo expat \
population living in Switzerland.  She further emphasized \
that the DefMin is taking a fact-based (i.e., \
non-ideological) approach to foreign deployment issues as \
they are discussed within the MOD.  In that context, Odermatt \
mentioned that DefMin Maurer on his own initiative was in the \
early stages of considering travel to Kosovo, to visit the \
Swiss KFOR contingent (SWISSCOY) and Kosovo officials. \
 \
¶2. (C) Also on March 19, A/POL-ECON Counselor passed the \
message (reftel, para 5) via telephone to Didier Chassot, \
Swiss MFA Regional Coordinator for South-Eastern Europe; \
Chassot was not available to meet, due to pending travel out \
of Bern.  In a follow up meeting at the MFA on March 20, \
Chassot informed A/POL-ECON Counselor that the MFA concurred \
with the USG's views and concerns with regard to the KFOR \
posture -- the "job is not yet done."  Responding to \
A/POL-ECON Counselor's query regarding the Swiss government's \
current position with regard to the Kosovo Security Force \
Trust Fund, Chassot said that, although Switzerland is \
strongly committed to Kosovo's future, he does not believe it \
likely that Switzerland will make a contribution to the \
Kosovo Security Force Trust Fund, due to domestic political \
considerations.  (Note:  Though the Swiss arms industry \
routinely is permitted to make foreign commercial sales to a \
range of countries, the Swiss generally are more reluctant to \
provide foreign security assistance other than in ways that \
clearly have only humanitarian or civil-military \
applications, such as the types of training provided at the \
Swiss Geneva Center for Security Policy.  End Note) \

 \
¶3. (U) Switzerland recognized Kosovo independence on February \
27, 2008 -- ten days after Kosovo's declaration.  In March \
2008, Switzerland became one of the first countries to open \
an embassy in Pristina.  FM Calmy-Rey traveled to Pristina \
for the opening.  The Swiss government pledged CHR 77 million \
(USD 69 million) in development assistance over three years \
at the July 2008 international donors' conference for Kosovo. \
 Approximately 150,000 Kosovo Albanians reside in \
Switzerland, most on long-term residency permits. \
 \
¶4. (U) The Swiss government made its initial decision to \
participate in KFOR in June 1999.  Switzerland's \
participation in KFOR is based on UNSCR 1244 and a mandate \
from the Swiss Parliament.  The parliamentary mandate was \
renewed last July through the end of 2011.  Up to 220 Swiss \
military personnel (all volunteers only) serve in the \
SWISSCOY, which is composed of support and infantry \
companies, and an aviation detachment with two Superpuma \
transport helicopters.  The SWISSCOY is stationed in \
Multinational Task Force South (MNTF-S), but can be employed \
throughout Kosovo.  The Swiss personnel are co-located with \
Austrian personnel at Camp Casablanca.  The Swiss MOD's \
budget for its KFOR deployment in 2008 was CHF 37.5 million \
 \
BERN 00000127  002 OF 002 \
 \
 \
(USD 33.5 million). \
