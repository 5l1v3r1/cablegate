SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) At a diplomatic roundtable on free trade agreement 
(FTA) negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), 
the Australian and New Zealand DCMs expressed fatigue and 
frustration with their respective experiences.  The New 
Zealand DCM said his government is prepared to pull out after 
the next round if the two sides cannot make significant 
progress.  Both said their governments are frustrated with 
the GCC as a negotiating partner, and both agreed the GCC 
consultations between negotiating sessions has proved to be a 
major barrier to progress.  End summary. 
 
STICKING POINTS AND FRUSTRATION WITH THE GCC 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) According to Australian DCM Roy Clogstoun, his 
country's trade agreement negotiations with the GCC are hung 
up on the issue of the GCC's current five percent tariff on 
automobile imports (which Australia would like to eliminate) 
and unresolved issues with the services and investment 
sections of the agreement.  While the current tariff is 
relatively low, Australians fear another country (i.e. Japan) 
could gain an advantage by negotiating a lower tariff 
subsequently.  New Zealand's negotiations are stuck on the 
issue of dairy products, though New Zealand DCM Peter Noble 
also noted the services and investment portions of their 
agreement were sub-optimal (Note:  Reportedly, dairy and 
sheep products account for 80 percent of New Zealand's 
exports to the GCC.).  He described the dispute mechanism and 
arbitration sections of the agreement as "acceptable," but he 
said his country was preparing to abandon the process after 
the next round in October if negotiators did not make 
substantial progress towards reaching an agreement by then. 
 
¶3. (C) Both DCMs expressed frustration with the GCC, going so 
far as to question the GCC's motivation for negotiating the 
agreements.  Noble implied the Saudis may be using the 
negotiations as a training exercise for future agreements 
with larger trading partners, noting the Chinese had openly 
done so with his country in bilateral trade negotiations. 
Both emphasized repeatedly that the GCC's lack of interim 
consultations between member states seriously hampered 
progress that otherwise might be easy to achieve.  "They 
don't talk to each other between rounds of meetings," one 
said, "they just return to their capitals until the next 
round."  The two DCMs asserted that Saudi Arabia controls the 
GCC in negotiations and has used smaller GCC members as pawns 
in the process -- convincing other individual members to 
pretend to be the lone holdout opposing a proposal, when in 
fact all six member governments actually were in opposition. 
Our contacts have said the members tend to act in concert to 
distract attention from controversial issues like the human 
rights records of individual GCC countries. 
 
¶4. (C) Japanese DCM Fumio Iwai told Econoff in a separate 
meeting that the GCC postponed the July round of its free 
trade negotiations with Japan.  "We are in the same boat as 
the Australians," he said, in that the sticking point in 
their negotiations is the five percent auto tariff.  Iwai 
said the Saudis had the strongest opposition to lowering the 
tariff, and he noted that the issue had been raised at the 
highest bilateral levels. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. (C) Given GCC officials previously have told us they also 
are in FTA negotiations with China, Japan, and Turkey, it 
seems likely the New Zealand DCM's fears that the GCC is 
using its separate negotiations with Australia and New 
Zealand as a training round may be well-founded. 
Nevertheless, that does not mean the GCC wants them to fail. 
The failure of EU - GCC negotiations in late 2008 
demonstrated an inflexibility which also seems underway here. 
 One bright spot:  both DCMs noted the successful conclusion 
of U.S. FTAs with Bahrain and Oman had positively influenced 
the negotiating atmosphere.
