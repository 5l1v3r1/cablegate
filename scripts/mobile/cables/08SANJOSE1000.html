¶1. (U) Costa Rican President Oscar Arias remains a leading 
critic of the Castro government and an advocate for 
democratic change and human rights reform in Cuba. The USG 
should encourage and bolster Costa Rica's continued support 
for democracy in Cuba.  Suspending Title III of the Libertad 
Act in regard to Costa Rica remains in the USG national 
interest. 
 
¶2. (C) While Costa Rica has long promoted democratic change 
in Cuba, earlier this year Embassy San Jose detected 
indications that the GOCR was reconsidering its Cuba position 
(and contemplating re-establishing full diplomatic 
relations).  This was being pushed by some members of the 
executive branch and the legislature as a way to help Cuba 
democratize faster (Ref B).  Since then, talk of establishing 
full relations has died down.  In addition, Costa Rica is set 
to join Venezuela,s Petrocaribe in early 2009 (Ref C), with 
a number of legislators, commentators and political observers 
wondering whether Chavez will demand Costa Rica,s 
recognition of Cuba as an eventual political price for 
joining.  The Arias administration is adamant that 
Petrocaribe is an economic agreement only. 
 
¶3. The following responses are keyed to Ref A questions: 
 
A) (U) Costa Rica remains a leading critic of the Castro 
government and an advocate for democratic change and human 
rights reforms in Cuba. 
 
B) (U) The Costa Rican government has continued to make 
public statements in support of democracy in Cuba. On 
February 19, 2008, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a 
statement in which it reaffirmed Costa Rica's "support for 
the democratic desire of the Cuban people." 
 
C) (C) Post is not aware of any high-level diplomatic visits 
between Cuba and Costa Rica in the past six months.  In a 
June 24, 2008 briefing by the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Bruno Stagno, the Russian Ambassador to Costa Rica asked 
point-blank about Costa Rica,s relations with Cuba. 
Minister Stagno answered that the GOCR was open to talk to 
the Cubans and did so from time to time, but that nothing 
formal was in the works (Ref B).  In addition, Minister 
Stagno shared a plane with Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe 
Perez Roque on the way to Lima, Peru to participate in the 
Latin America-European Union Summit in May 2008.  Costa Rica 
maintains a consulate in Miramar, Cuba and Cuba maintains a 
consulate in San Jose. 
 
D) (U) Post is not aware of any major Costa Rican business 
investments in Cuba.  However, many Costa Rican businesses 
import cigars from Cuba and repackage them.  In addition, 
Costa Rican tourists regularly visit Cuba and vice versa. 
 
E) (U) Post is not aware of any bilateral trade agreements 
between Costa Rica and Cuba. 
 
F) (U) Costa Rica did not offer humanitarian or other 
assistance to Cuba after Hurricanes Ike and Gustav.  The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release expressing 
solidarity with the people of the Caribbean affected by the 
recent hurricanes. 
 
G) (U) Post is not aware of any exchange programs between 
Costa Rica and Cuba. A limited number of Costa Rican students 
have accepted scholarships to study medicine and film in 
Cuba, but Post is not aware of any formal exchange or 
scholarship programs between Cuban and Costa Rican 
universities.  Post is unaware of any Costa Ricans who have 
traveled to Cuba for medical treatment, given the 
availability of publicly subsidized health care in Costa 
Rica. Post estimates that there may be  hundreds of Cuban 
doctors working in Costa Rica, either in private practices or 
with Costa Rican hospitals.  Many of these doctors fled Cuba 
for greater political and economic freedom in Costa Rica. 
Many of these doctors eventually naturalize as Costa Rican 
citizens.
