1.(S/NF) SUMMARY:  Special Envoy Mitchell, Embassy Damascus 
is looking forward to your prospective visit.  In your 
initial meeting, it is unlikely that the Syrians will put 
forward any new ideas.  They will rely on your team to 
present ideas that they can consider and possibly negotiate. 
Asad and his FM Walid al-Muallim will undoubtedly recount 
that Syria and Israel were "words away" from a deal in late 
December.  The details of the story often change, however, in 
the retelling.  In the wake of President Obama's speech, the 
Syrians will be testing you to see if the USG is sincere in 
its position against Israeli settlement growth. 
 
2.(S/NF) Successive generations of Syrians have been raised 
around the core principal that Syria is threatened by Israel. 
 There is endemic skepticism in Syria that a return of the 
Golan will ever be possible.  There is little objective 
discussion of what peace would entail.  A failure to prepare 
the public for possible concessions could prove a 
vulnerability on the Syrian side.  The security establishment 
which keeps Asad in power presently could conceivably be 
threatened by the absence of war. 
 
3.(S/NF) The Arab street continues to view Asad as the only 
Arab leader to oppose Israel's actions and support the 
resistance in an unambiguous way.  Asad's credentials on this 
point were strengthened immeasurably by Israel's operation in 
Gaza.  Iran has played Syria well in this regard, and it may 
be too late to extract Syria from the Iran-Hizbollah defense 
relationship.  On Palestine, SARG officials have not 
demonstrated a significant understanding of the ins and outs 
of PA-PLO relations.  Asad and Muallim will tout Hamas's 
electoral credentials and will criticize Abu Mazen as a weak 
leader, for example, but will be unable to engage in a 
detailed discussion on why Hamas ought to join the PLO (a 
notion which they support).  It appears less likely now that 
the SARG can expel Hamas, particularly as Hamas enjoys warm 
relations with key Syrian allies Iran, Turkey and Qatar. 
 
4.(S/NF) State-owned and controlled Syrian media will give 
your visit maximum play, billing it as confirmation of 
Syria's importance as a regional player, as recognition of 
Syria's indispensable role in any future peace settlement, 
and as the final nail in the coffin of the isolation imposed 
on Asad by the former U.S. Administration.  Syria media may 
try to contrast your visit with that of FPOTUS Carter, who 
departs Syria on June 12.  They could portray your visit as 
USG "official" outreach, and Carter's visit -- which is 
likely to include a meeting with Hamas leader Meshaal -- as 
USG "unofficial" outreach. 
 
5.(S/NF) Syrians have been hit by the global economic 
slowdown, SARG cuts in fuel and other subsidies, and soaring 
inflation.  The general negative state of the Syrian economy 
translates into more pressure on the SARG to address the 
issue of U.S. sanctions.  Asad is desperate to increase 
foreign direct investment, and this goal is hampered by the 
stigmatization that accompanies U.S. sanctions policy. 
Syria's private banking sector -- which is growing in both 
size and importance -- is harmed when foreign banks decline 
correspondent banking relationships for fear of running afoul 
of U.S. law.  Syrian civil aviation has been severely 
impacted by provisions of the Syria Accountability Act.  With 
the Syrian Air fleet atrophied from 16 to just four aircraft, 
SARG officials are desperate to obtain U.S.-made spare parts 
for their aging planes.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------- 
What to expect 
-------------- 
 
6.(S/NF) After just three months of re-engagement efforts 
between the U.S. and Syria, the SARG decided they were 
 
 
unhappy with the level and scope of our engagement.  Perhaps 
stung that the steps they hoped for from us (return of a U.S. 
ambassador, your visit, high level contacts) appeared to be 
delayed until after Lebanon's June 7 elections, the SARG 
conveyed its unhappiness during the May 7 visit of A A/S 
Feltman and NSC Director Shapiro (refs A, B) and then even 
more explicitly during the May 28 visit of CODEL Kaufman. 
"The U.S. approach and methodology are wrong," Syrian 
President Bashar Asad told Senator Kaufman (ref C).  Asad 
went on to make a veiled pitch that you represent the U.S. 
side in our bilateral re-engagement efforts as well as on 
comprehensive peace efforts.  The Syrians will want to talk 
to you about the "political umbrella" for potential bilateral 
cooperation as well as a "road map" (their term) that lays 
out a formal understanding and sequencing of forward movement 
on the U.S.-Syria relationship.  Underlying these efforts is 
the SARG's lingering resentment over its treatment by the 
Bush Administration and its fears that the Obama 
Administration will ultimately mete out similar treatment. 
Although Asad often tells visitors that bilateral 
relationships are based on a calculation of interests and not 
trust, the SARG at present is looking for evidence it can 
trust the U.S. on both the big issues and the small ones. 
Your visit, for them, represents a significant step in 
restoring a normal relationship.  Another important step is a 
U.S. decision to return an ambassador to Damascus; they will 
hope you come armed with good news on that issue. 
 
7.(S/NF) The SARG's focus on the bilateral relationship is 
based on the regime's hunger for respect from the U.S. and an 
acknowledgment from the Obama Administration of the 
legitimacy of the regime.  On a bilateral level, we have few 
national interests to pursue in Syria; it is Syria's 
centrality to regional issues that makes it necessary for us 
to deal constructively with the SARG.  Sanctions, dating from 
1979 and culminating in the 2004 Syria Accountability Act, 
enforce a highly restricted framework for trade and generally 
cast a pall over relations.  During the Bush Administration, 
Syria kept its ambassador in Washington despite the lack of 
access to administration officials.  The U.S. pulled out the 
American ambassador in 2005 after the assassination of Rafiq 
Hariri; the withdrawal of the ambassador sparked the Syrians 
into taking a series of measures harassing embassy 
operations.  The alleged U.S. raid on Abu Kamal in October 
2008 ultimately led to the late 2008 closing of the Damascus 
Community School, the Cultural Center, and the Language 
Center.  Discussions of the bilateral relationship, 
therefore, generally revolve around sanctions and the 
Syrians' desire for some alleviation, and the operational 
constraints placed on Embassy Damascus.  While SARG 
intentions remain murky, it seems likely the push for a "road 
map" is meant to raise the discussion to a higher level, but 
one that will inescapably involve issues related to Iraq, 
Lebanon, and Middle East Peace. 
 
------------------ 
Arab Israeli Peace 
------------------ 
 
8.(S/NF) It is unlikely the SARG will put forward new ideas 
in your first meeting.  For Asad, given his skepticism over 
Israeli intentions, the overriding significance of this 
initial meeting is recognition of Syria's regional importance 
and the implicit U.S. acknowledgment of regime legitimacy. 
Asad, his FM Walid al-Muallim and Advisor Bouthaina Shaaban 
will almost certainly rely on your team to present ideas they 
can then consider and react to.  It seems increasingly 
certain they will assess interactions on the comprehensive 
peace effort within the context of their calculations on the 
U.S.-Syrian bilateral relationship, a development that may 
greatly complicate our efforts.  They will want to hear in 
detail about our position vis-a-vis Israel (although they may 
not ask for it directly) so they can assess whether the Obama 
Administration is sincere in its apparent position against 
Israeli settlement growth.  Even if they are satisfied on 
that point, they will complain that the USG approach is not 
strong enough.  All problems in the region, in the Syrian 
view, stem from Israeli behavior and can only be resolved 
through changes in Israeli behavior. 
 
 
9.(S/NF) President Asad has been in the waiting mode on the 
Syria-Israel track since October 2008, when the Israeli 
government entered into a protracted 
campaign/elections/government formation process.  Except for 
late December, when the Turks unsuccessfully attempted to 
broker agreement on the broad outlines of a deal, Asad has 
been able to sit back and wait for the new Israeli government 
to develop a position.  With GOI PM Netanyahu now in place 
and making statements, Asad claims he does not see an Israeli 
partner.  Asad has taken no first steps, offered no 
initiatives, and has risked nothing since the indirect talks 
were suspended.  Israel's Gaza operation at first threatened, 
then later strengthened Asad in his comfort zone.  Initially 
embarrassed that he'd been negotiating, even indirectly, with 
Israel, Asad later turned waves of Arab outrage over the 
treatment of Palestinian civilians to his benefit.  As the 
self-modeled Arab center of support for the "resistance," 
Asad found himself both responding to and shaping regional 
public opinion.  The Arab street generally continues to view 
Asad as the only Arab leader to oppose Israel's actions and 
support the resistance in a vigorous, unambiguous way. 
 
10.(S/NF) Though Asad may dream of being the leader who 
returns the Golan to Syria, there is endemic skepticism here 
that such a deal will ever be possible.  The Syrians are 
generally negative in outlook on this point, and successive 
generations have been raised around the core principle that 
Syria is threatened by Israel.  The ethos that binds the 
country together is essentially resistance to Israel.  There 
is little objective discussion of what peace would entail, 
particularly in terms of potential concessions.  There are 
fundamental contradictions for the Syrians in the pursuit of 
peace with Israel:  a failure to prepare the Syrian public 
for the inevitability of concessions could ultimately 
threaten the acclaim Asad anticipates from the return of the 
Golan.  Additionally, the vested interests of the Syrian 
security establishment would conceivably be the first to be 
threatened by the absence of a state of war; that same 
security establishment is what keeps Bashar in power now. 
 
11.(S/NF) Asad and Muallim will want to tell the story again 
of how close they were to a deal in late December when Olmert 
was in Ankara and Muallim was on the phone, trying to reach 
consensus on the phrase dealing with the "terms of reference" 
or "issues related" to going to direct talks.  The Syrians 
insisted that the June 4 line be the "terms of reference" 
while the GOI sought to avoid being pinned down.  Even after 
telling the story so many times, however, there are still 
inconsistencies in the Syrian presentation.  Sometimes they 
talk about six points, sometimes three.  Sometimes there are 
six geographical coordinates or there are three 
geocoordinates and three narrative points of policy.  The 
Syrians also claim to have deposited with the Turks narrative 
responses to six questions from the Israelis dealing with 
security arrangements.  If the Syrian responses on Hamas and 
Hizbollah are similar to their routine presentations, those 
answers are not as constructive as the Syrians claim. 
 
------------------------- 
Hamas, Hizbollah and Iran 
------------------------- 
 
12.(S/NF) The notion of resistance has been elevated in Syria 
from pragmatism to theology in the last year, with an 
enormous boost coming as a result of the Gaza operation. 
This trend strengthens the hands of Hamas and Hizbollah 
vis-a-vis the SARG, thanks in part to a Syrian propaganda 
effort that has glorified the resistance activities of two 
groups which are otherwise antithetical to the SARG's secular 
orientation.  The SARG's relationship with Hizbollah has 
morphed from a patron-client relationship to one of near 
equals; the addition of Iran to their security alliance 
further constricts Bashar's flexibility in dealing with 
Hizbollah.  SARG officials insist "Syria is not in the pocket 
of anyone, including Iran" and point to increasingly warm 
relations with Turkey as a counter-balance to the Iran 
relationship.  SARG protestations notwithstanding, the degree 
of security cooperation among Syria, Iran, and Hizbollah has 
created a defense relationship from which Syria will not 
easily be able to extract itself.  Hamas escaped any serious 
criticism from the SARG for its poor performance during the 
Gaza conflict and, despite rumors that Hamas chief Khalid 
Meshaal's high profile annoys Bashar, there has been no 
noticeable SARG effort to clip Meshaal's wings.  The SARG is 
uneasy with Hamas's Muslim Brotherhood affiliations but 
claims its resistance mission takes priority.  Hamas is 
probably proselytizing in Palestinian refugee camps here. 
Concerned about Fatah al-Islam and rogue Al-Qaeda (AQI) 
elements (not those AQI elements whom they have coopted as 
part of the foreign fighter network facilitation), the SARG 
may have insufficient resources to also keep Hamas under 
control.  It appears less likely that the SARG can expel 
Hamas now, particularly as Hamas also enjoys warm relations 
with Syria's key allies Iran, Turkey, and Qatar.  In fact, it 
seems the SARG is actually open to a reconciliation with its 
own Muslim Brotherhood movement -- a move that comes largely 
at the behest of Turkey.  Hamas seems to be less of a card to 
play and more of a permanent guest. 
 
----- 
Media 
----- 
 
13.(SBU) Syrian media coverage of the possibility of your 
visit has been muted and confined to private daily al-Watan 
and websites.  Syrian media, which are largely state-owned 
and completely state-controlled, will give maximum play to an 
actual visit.  They will bill it as confirmation of Syria's 
importance as a regional player, as recognition of Syria's 
indispensable role in any future peace settlement, and as the 
final nail in the coffin of the isolation imposed on Asad by 
the former U.S. Administration.  As the visit comes on the 
heels of a June 10-12 FPOTUS Carter visit, Syrian media may 
seek to cast your visit as our official outreach to the SARG 
and Carter's visit (and his expected meeting with Hamas chief 
Meshaal) as our unofficial outreach.  The SARG could also use 
Carter's visit to highlight and criticize our continued 
refusal to officially engage with Hamas.  The tone of 
coverage is likely to be colored by the tenor of the meeting 
itself.  We expect coverage to be positive, but judging from 
past practice, it may be accompanied by a subsequent public 
statement or interview by Asad on the importance of 
"resistance" to mollify the Iranians. 
 
--------- 
Sanctions 
--------- 
 
14.(C) Five years of U.S. sanctions have hurt the Syrian 
economy, although they have not hurt the average Syrian's 
standard of living.  The sanctions' greatest overall impact 
is the deterrent effect they have had on foreign direct 
investment (FDI), coming at a time when Syria is less able to 
meet its own needs. U.S. trade sanctions implemented under 
the Syria Accountability Act (SAA) have severely restricted 
the national air carrier's ability to obtain spare parts and 
have prevented it from purchasing new aircraft.  Sanctions 
have atrophied Syrian Air's fleet from 16 to just four 
aircraft, have grounded the SARG's VIP aircraft, and have 
hampered Asad's cousin's (Specially Designated National Rami 
Makhlouf) attempts to launch a private airline.  The U.S. 
Treasury Department sanction against the Commercial Bank of 
Syria has stigmatized Syria's entire financial sector, to 
include the nascent private banks, as most U.S. and European 
financial institutions have cut off correspondent 
relationships with all Syrian banks.  Reformers and 
businessmen argue U.S. sanctions have actually retarded the 
SARG's liberalization of the economy ) and (they claim) the 
political liberalization that would eventually follow ) 
while strengthening regime hard-liners who use sanctions as 
ammunition against greater engagement with the U.S. 
 
15.(C) The Syrians find the Administration's decision last 
month to renew sanctions under the SAA as problematic and 
ill-timed.  Syrian Ambassador in Washington Imad Moustapha 
told media the renewal was proof the USG can still be 
"captive to Israeli interests."  In meetings with previous 
Congressional and other VIP delegations, the SARG had 
refrained from raising the SAA and sanctions issues, 
generally.  However, in Asad's most recent meeting with 
Senator Kaufman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
Asad raised the issue directly, asking (rhetorically) whether 
the U.S. was interested in working with the Syrians to remove 
sanctions "obstacles" from the bilateral relationship (ref 
C).  The Department's report on Syria's progress in meeting 
the conditions contained in the SAA is due to Congress on 
June 12 -- coinciding with your visit. 
 
------------------------ 
Syria's changing economy 
------------------------ 
 
16.(C)  Asad has presided over significant changes in 
economic policy that were primarily driven by Syria's 
diminishing oil reserves -- long the regime's primary source 
of revenue -- and its decreasing influence over the Lebanese 
economy.  The most significant reforms so far include 
liberalizing Syria's trade regime to authorize the direct 
import of most consumer goods, re-introducing private banking 
into the financial sector, and cutting government subsidies 
on refined petroleum products.  The reform program has 
exposed political fissures between the generally pro-Western, 
pro-reform private sector and the Ba'ath Party, who fear the 
reforms threaten the system of patronage and corruption that 
has sustained their dominant socio-economic position and 
might lead to irreversible political freedoms that could 
bring down the regime.  While Bashar manages to remain above 
the fray of day-to-day economic debates, his supporters say 
he is simply pursuing the "China model" of economic 
development while maintaining firm political control. 
 
17.(C) While unlikely to threaten regime stability in the 
short-term, Syria's most acute economic problems must 
eventually be addressed to maintain the state's long-term 
viability.  Syria's burgeoning population suffers from an 
estimated 25-30% unemployment rate, with some 35% of the 
workforce employed by the public sector.  Inflation is 
rampant in Syria; even upper-middle class Syrians are having 
trouble putting food on the table and paying rising utility 
and fuel bills.  The true rate of inflation, which we 
estimated at over 30 percent in 2008, is never acknowledged 
by the Syrian government.  According to the Syrian Deputy 
Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Abdallah al-Dardari, 
however, the average Syrian is spending 42 percent of his 
income on food. 
 
18.(C) Increasing demand for energy, water and transportation 
is straining Syria's antiquated infrastructure, and Syrians 
have grown accustomed to year-round water rationing and 
seasonal power rationing.  The SARG is counting on FDI to 
make up for decreasing oil revenues (which dropped by 8.7 
percent in 2007, according to the SARG) and to develop 
critical infrastructure, although Syria's endemic corruption 
) as well as U.S. sanctions ) act as a deterrent to FDI. 
The regime believes Syria can leverage its geographical 
location to reap economic benefits from increased trade 
between Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Europe, 
particularly by exporting Iraqi oil and gas through Syria to 
the European market.  The SARG hopes to leverage its 
relations with Turkey and Iran to improve its water, natural 
gas and electrical supplies by physically connecting the 
necessary pipelines and grid networks.  (Note:  Though not 
contiguous with Iran, the SARG is working with Iran and 
Turkey on possible construction of a pumping station to bring 
water from the Tigris to Turkey, Syria and Iraq.  End note.) 
 
19.(C) The global financial crisis is affecting Syria 
indirectly, as Syria's large expatriate population sends 
decreased remittances, GCC investors -- who constitute the 
greatest contributors to Syria's FDI -- have put some 
projects on indefinite hold, and exporters of manufactured 
goods -- particularly textiles -- have seen demand for their 
products drop by 50 percent or more.  The Office of the Prime 
Minister has commissioned a group of high-profile economists 
to analyze the effect of a prospective mass-repatriation of 
Syrian workers from abroad on the Syrian economy and social 
stability.  (Note:  The prospective repatriation would 
include both laborers and white-collar workers.  End note.) 
 
------------ 
Human Rights 
------------ 
 
20.(C/NF) The SARG continues to be deeply suspicious of human 
rights and civil society activists.  All political parties 
that do not participate within the National Progressive 
Front, of which the Ba,ath Party is the leading member, are 
illegal.  The SARG finds any dissent directed at the regime's 
legitimacy, including more general calls for "democratic 
reform," to be intolerable.  The government has been swift to 
detain, prosecute, and imprison oppositionist leaders. 
Democratic reformers perceived to be colluding with foreign 
powers are subject to especially harsh reprisals, as in the 
case of the activist Kamal Labwani who, after an 
international tour that included meetings with Bush White 
House officials, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for 
plotting against the regime.  (He remains incarcerated.) 
Human rights activists who are able to refrain from political 
attacks are generally given more leeway.  Lawyers for human 
rights activists who do not engage in overt political 
criticism remain under serious SARG scrutiny and suffer 
harassment, but they are rarely incarcerated. 
 
21.(C/NF) When addressing human rights and political 
detentions with CODELs and other visiting VIPs, President 
Asad has consistently maintained the following:  (1) SARG 
actions are justified on the grounds of national security 
and/or the detained individuals criminality; (2) the issue is 
an internal one -- Syria does not meddle in other nations' 
internal affairs, nor should other nations meddle in Syria's; 
and (3) there can be no conversation about human rights 
without including the Israeli treatment of Palestinians, 
especially the recent military action in Gaza. 
 
----------------- 
Refugee Situation 
----------------- 
 
22.(C) Syria has an interest in inflating the numbers of 
Iraqi refugees to gain additional assistance and credit for 
the burdens they are bearing, and occasionally raise this 
issue with visiting delegations.  Though the SARG reports 
that Iraqi refugees number 1.2 million, diplomatic and 
intelligence sources suggest a number at most half this size. 
 While the SARG might complain bitterly about the lack of 
support provided by the U.S. on this issue, in truth the U.S. 
has contributed approximately $200 million since FY07 (a mix 
of contributions to NGOs and to U.N. organizations) to 
support and assist Iraqis in Syria and the local impoverished 
Syrian population.  Iraqi refugees are becoming increasingly 
vulnerable -- and more reliant on humanitarian aid -- as they 
deplete available resources and are unable to work legally. 
Syria also hosts some 400,000 Palestinian refugees, the 
descendants of Palestinians who fled Israel in 1948.  UNRWA 
provides health, education, and social services.  The 
Palestinians, in contrast to the Iraqi refugees, enjoy most 
of the rights of Syrian citizens. 
 
------------------- 
Nuclear Aspirations 
------------------- 
 
23.(C) Concerns linger over Syria's presumed intent to 
establish a covert nuclear weapons program.  Syria allowed an 
IAEA inspection team to examine the al-Kibar site in June 
¶2008.  The SARG claims that soil samples that yielded traces 
of enriched uranium were the result of Israeli bombs 
containing depleted uranium.  The IAEA has sought follow-up 
visits to Damascus, to no end.  Meanwhile, the Syrians have 
waged a somewhat successful campaign within the IAEA for 
preliminary assistance in establishing a civil nuclear 
program, securing a Board of Governor's (BOG) decision to 
move forward with technical cooperation.  The Syrians read 
the BOG decision as a sign they can continue to evade IAEA 
requests for further inspections.  We seek to convince them 
that cooperation with the IAEA offers a choice preferable to 
following the Iranian model of non-cooperation.
