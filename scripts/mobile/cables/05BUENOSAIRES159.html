</p><p>¶1. Summary: (C) During their 24-hour visit to Argentina 
</p><p>January 12-13, CODEL Dodd, accompanied by Ambassador 
</p><p>Gutierrez, held informative and wide-ranging discussions with 
</p><p>President Nestor Kirchner, Minister of Interior Anibal 
</p><p>Fernandez, Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana, and Central 
</p><p>Bank President Martin Redrado.  In addition, prior to their 
</p><p>arrival in Buenos Aires, the CODEL visited the Tri-border 
</p><p>region of Argentina where they were briefed on GOA 
</p><p>counternarcotics and counterterrorism activities.  All of the 
</p><p>interlocutors expressed their satisfaction with the overall 
</p><p>state of U.S.-Argentine relations.  In particular, they noted 
</p><p>that cooperation with the U.S. on counternarcotics and 
</p><p>counterterrorism issues was excellent.  During a luncheon 
</p><p>hosted by the Ambassador attended by a number of independent 
</p><p>political and economic analysts, the CODEL was told how the 
</p><p>U.S. Administration had been particularly helpful to 
</p><p>Argentina during the recent economic crisis, prompting 
</p><p>Senator Dodd to state that the U.S. clearly had devoted 
</p><p>considerable attention to support Argentina which is not what 
</p><p>he thought prior to his visit.  End Summary. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (U)  Senators Christopher Dodd (D-Conn), Bill Nelson 
</p><p>(D-Fla) and Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) had a brief but busy 
</p><p>schedule during their visit to Argentina.  CODEL Dodd was in 
</p><p>Argentina to discuss political and economic trends in general 
</p><p>and counternarcotics and counterterrorism cooperation in 
</p><p>particular.  In a last minute addition to the schedule, 
</p><p>President Kirchner also received the delegation (reftel). 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- 
</p><p>Interior Minister Fernandez Praises Cooperation 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- --- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (C) In his opening remarks, Interior Minister Anibal 
</p><p>Fernandez praised the level of cooperation the GOA has 
</p><p>received from the U.S. on counterterrorism issues.  He noted 
</p><p>this cooperation was of ""high quality"" and ""value added"" that 
</p><p>included ""shared information, sources and common action.""  He 
</p><p>said this work continued on a day-to-day basis with a 
</p><p>constant exchange of information.  However, when asked by 
</p><p>Senator Nelson if the cooperation was enough, Fernandez 
</p><p>responded, ""No, it's never enough.  We can do a lot more."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (C) In response to a question on cooperation with Paraguay 
</p><p>and Brazil on counterterrorism issues, Fernandez said there 
</p><p>had been a lot of progress on common policy under the 
</p><p>MERCOSUR umbrella but that joint work with its two neighbors 
</p><p>was not as extensive as the GOA would prefer.  With Paraguay, 
</p><p>the problem was one of capacity, while with Brazil it was a 
</p><p>question of willingness to cooperate.  Fernandez, though, 
</p><p>said the GOA was working to overcome difficulties with Brazil 
</p><p>and that a common policy on counterterrorism was gradually 
</p><p>emerging. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) Fernandez said his ministry was focusing on three 
</p><p>major transnational themes: terrorism, narcotics trafficking 
</p><p>and smuggling.  In response to these challenges, the GOA had 
</p><p>set out to define and create a common policy and response 
</p><p>both at the federal and provincial level.  A critical 
</p><p>component of this common policy would be to reach a consensus 
</p><p>in judicial terms on rules of procedure to fast-track 
</p><p>investigations and prosecutions in these areas.  Fernandez 
</p><p>said that by February 1, the GOA would have a special strike 
</p><p>force unit within the Attorney General,s office to deal with 
</p><p>these issues.  A second critical component of the GOA,s 
</p><p>efforts would be directed at coordinating the actions of the 
</p><p>intelligence community on narcotics and terrorism 
</p><p>investigations. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (C) When Senator Dodd asked about reports that Colombians 
</p><p>were increasingly involved in narcotics trafficking in 
</p><p>Argentina, Fernandez, at first, expressed skepticism.  When 
</p><p>told by an Embassy DEA representative attending the meeting 
</p><p>that Colombians were behind a number of major narcotics cases 
</p><p>currently being investigated by both Argentine and U.S. 
</p><p>authorities, Fernandez agreed that ""Yes, it,s possible."" 
</p><p>The Minister then said he was more concerned with the 
</p><p>corrupting power of the money that goes along with 
</p><p>trafficking than with who was actually running the drugs.  He 
</p><p>said drug seizures alone did not really capture the depth of 
</p><p>the problem in Argentina.  Fernandez, referring to two recent 
</p><p>local drug lab seizures, added that drugs are not just 
</p><p>reaching Buenos Aires, they are being processed here.  In a 
</p><p>somewhat somber conclusion to the meeting, Fernandez opined 
</p><p>that ""we can,t win (the fight against drug traffickers); 
</p><p>what I don,t want is to lose badly."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p>Taiana: GOA Will Continue to Work Regional Issues 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Taiana underscored to CODEL 
</p><p>the GOA,s intention of remaining actively involved in 
</p><p>promoting human rights and democratic institutions in the 
</p><p>hemisphere.  Asked by Senator Chafee about relations with 
</p><p>Venezuela, Taiana said the GOA had attempted to fashion a 
</p><p>""moderating role"" designed to reduce tensions within 
</p><p>Venezuela.  He noted that Kirchner had met with opposition 
</p><p>leaders and factions during both of his visits to Venezuela. 
</p><p>Taiana said he had discussed with Assistant Secretary Roger 
</p><p>Noriega the question of human rights in Venezuela and how the 
</p><p>GOA and the U.S. might work together in this area.  Taiana 
</p><p>mentioned in particular his concern about legislation either 
</p><p>enacted or being considered by the Venezuelan legislature 
</p><p>impacting on human rights.  Senator Nelson commented that 
</p><p>President Chavez claims he wants a new relationship with the 
</p><p>U.S.; but what he really wants is the public relations 
</p><p>benefits of better relations while continuing to crack down 
</p><p>on the press, property rights and packing the Supreme Court. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (C) On other regional issues, Taiana told the CODEL that 
</p><p>the GOA was firm in its commitment to Haiti.  ""We can,t turn 
</p><p>our backs or look at the cost.  We can,t fail.""  He said it 
</p><p>was important that Latin America make a significant 
</p><p>contribution and work to improve basic security and to build 
</p><p>democratic institutions in Haiti.  Taiana said that friendly 
</p><p>and cooperative relations with Brazil and Chile were now 
</p><p>Argentina,s highest priority and that this change of culture 
</p><p>from one of confrontation to one of cooperation with these 
</p><p>two nations represented one of the greatest accomplishments 
</p><p>of Argentina,s 22 years of democracy.  In his concluding 
</p><p>remarks, Taiana reiterated the GOA,s commitment for a 
</p><p>successful Summit of the Americas which Argentina will host 
</p><p>this November.  He noted that the Summit would focus on the 
</p><p>interrelated themes of creating jobs, fighting poverty and 
</p><p>increasing democratic governance. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
</p><p>BCRA President Redrado Discusses Macroeconomic Issues 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (SBU) Central Bank (BCRA) President Martin Redrado told 
</p><p>the CODEL that Argentina,s economic history could be 
</p><p>summarized by the phrase, ""overspending and 
</p><p>overindebtedness.""  He then claimed that the world was now 
</p><p>seeing for the first time in Argentina fiscal discipline, a 
</p><p>realistic floating exchange rate, prudential monetary policy, 
</p><p>and ""productive integration with the rest of the world."" 
</p><p>Argentina had a consolidated fiscal surplus of 5.2 percent of 
</p><p>GDP in 2004, including 4.3 percent of GDP in the central 
</p><p>government plus almost another one percent in the provinces. 
</p><p>Argentina,s floating exchange rate is important for the 
</p><p>""productive integration"" of the Argentine economy with the 
</p><p>rest of the world.  The BCRA held inflation to 6.1 percent in 
</p><p>2004, below the originally targeted range of 7-11 percent. 
</p><p>Redrado also recognized that the country still needed to 
</p><p>""address public utility and energy prices and adapt to a new 
</p><p>regulatory framework"" or there ""won,t be any investment"" and 
</p><p>to obtain a successful debt restructuring with ""a strong 
</p><p>response from the creditors."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (C) Senator Dodd asked Redrado to what extent he thought 
</p><p>there was tolerance in the body politic for badly needed 
</p><p>structural reforms.  On the debt restructuring, Redrado 
</p><p>emphasized that this was not in his area of responsibility, 
</p><p>but speaking as a private economist he thought that the 
</p><p>strong participation of domestic pension funds, banks and 
</p><p>industry would produce a participation rate of at least 45-50 
</p><p>percent.  After that, he thought it was a question of how 
</p><p>much manpower the participating banks had to persuade the 
</p><p>foreign bondholders to participate in the restructuring. 
</p><p>Powerful investors like Soros have the option of going to the 
</p><p>courts, unlike individual bondholders, and will win, but even 
</p><p>then, they will not be able to collect because, unlike 
</p><p>Venezuela, Argentina does not have assets abroad.  From what 
</p><p>he saw in the foreign exchange market, he thought investors 
</p><p>wanted to go to emerging markets to take advantage of the 
</p><p>difference in yields, and this increased the likelihood of a 
</p><p>successful debt exchange.  More specifically, he said that 
</p><p>the spread between the yields on emerging market bonds and 
</p><p>U.S. Treasuries was now only 350 basis points, or 3.5 
</p><p>percent, which was the narrowest spread that there had been 
</p><p>in 10 years. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11. (C) On tax reforms, Redrado said that President Kirchner 
</p><p>was fiscally conservative, to the point of blocking some 
</p><p>changes.  Redrado wanted to eliminate the distortionary 
</p><p>financial transactions tax, which encourages people to 
</p><p>operate in the informal economy.  However, whenever he tried 
</p><p>to eliminate the tax, President Kirchner would ask, ""With 
</p><p>what are you going to replace it?""  On revenue sharing, 
</p><p>Redrado said Argentina has a federal government with central 
</p><p>tax collection and subsequent distribution of revenues to the 
</p><p>provinces, which prevents the development of fiscal 
</p><p>responsibility in the provinces.  ""There is a move toward 
</p><p>decentralization,"" he said, ""but this is hard to do 
</p><p>politically.""  There is also a feeling that it is not worth 
</p><p>the effort, so progress will be limited to reforms such as 
</p><p>""the elimination of distortionary taxes in due time.""  On the 
</p><p>renegotiation of public utility and energy prices, Redrado 
</p><p>said ""the sooner, the better"" but it is unlikely this will 
</p><p>occur in an election year.  Price increases that do occur 
</p><p>will be limited to private companies, and will not affect 
</p><p>residential users.  Redrado explained that President Kirchner 
</p><p>is ""willing to go over the heads of the political structure"" 
</p><p>to appeal to the people and is therefore especially sensitive 
</p><p>to the public's reaction to potential price increases. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (C) On monetary policy, Redrado said that there was a 
</p><p>great deal of stimulus at the beginning of the year coming 
</p><p>from measures like increased payments to retirees, higher 
</p><p>wage payments, and postponed tax payments.  The BCRA 
</p><p>compensated by raising the BCRA interest rate from 2.5 to 
</p><p>2.75 percent.  Redrado thought Minister of Economy Roberto 
</p><p>Lavagna had implemented these measures in order to lower the 
</p><p>consolidated fiscal surplus when he had to present the debt 
</p><p>exchange to the country,s creditors.  Redrado said the BCRA 
</p><p>wanted to tell the market that it would err on the side of 
</p><p>conservatism, dealing with ""inflation first, and the exchange 
</p><p>rate second.""  If there was a problem with the exchange rate, 
</p><p>he said, the GOA could use its surplus to buy dollars as it 
</p><p>had done in the past.  On relations with the IMF, Redrado 
</p><p>said the IMF had ""made a mistake"" in not asking for a higher 
</p><p>primary fiscal surplus in Argentina,s current IMF agreement. 
</p><p> Consequently, the GOA should commit to a higher surplus in 
</p><p>the renegotiation of the current IMF agreement, but should 
</p><p>""not tie our hands"" as to how to use the surplus. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (C) Redrado said that he was sensitive to the things that 
</p><p>are of interest to the U.S.  He said that he was concerned 
</p><p>about how the financial system could be used for money 
</p><p>laundering to finance terrorism and that he had asked the 
</p><p>Ambassador for technical assistance to tell the BCRA what it 
</p><p>was doing right or wrong.  (Note: During January 10-15 a U.S. 
</p><p>Treasury technical assistance team visited Argentina to 
</p><p>assess Argentina's anti-money laundering capability and 
</p><p>possibilities for USG technical assistance in this area.) 
</p><p>Redrado expressed particular concern about the use of 
</p><p>Argentina,s money exchange houses for money laundering, 
</p><p>since he did not have enough inspectors to inspect either the 
</p><p>money exchange houses or banks in the provinces.  Redrado 
</p><p>added that he had just issued a BCRA resolution that 
</p><p>permitted the BCRA to freeze financial accounts due to 
</p><p>suspicious activity. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>------------------------------------------- 
</p><p>Lunch with Economic and Political Analysts 
</p><p>------------------------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶14. (C) In order to provide a different perspective on 
</p><p>Argentine political and economic developments, the Ambassador 
</p><p>hosted a luncheon for the CODEL with a number of prominent 
</p><p>independent analysts.  The main topic of the discussion was 
</p><p>Argentina,s ongoing debt rescheduling offer and the 
</p><p>country,s expected renegotiation of its existing IMF 
</p><p>agreement.  Daniel Artana, Director and Chief Economist of 
</p><p>the Latin American Economic Research Foundation, was cautious 
</p><p>about the potential outcome of the debt rescheduling, noting 
</p><p>that even if all of the creditors accepted the offer, 
</p><p>Argentina would still have a large debt burden, which he 
</p><p>estimated at 80 percent of GDP.  On the positive side, he 
</p><p>noted the GOA had delivered much better fiscal results than 
</p><p>in the past and would not have to go to the debt market for 
</p><p>the next few years.  Artana also thought that Argentina could 
</p><p>obtain a new IMF agreement in the second quarter of 2005. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶15. (C) Senator Dodd asked how the U.S. role during 
</p><p>Argentina,s recent economic crisis had been perceived.  The 
</p><p>lunch participants agreed that the U.S. role had been and 
</p><p>continues to be very positive.  Javier Finkman, Chief of 
</p><p>Economic and Risk Research for HSBC Bank Corporation, 
</p><p>described the U.S. as ""a friendly voice for Argentina"" and 
</p><p>praised U.S. support in the G7 and the IMF.  Political 
</p><p>analyst Jorge Castro, president of the Argentine Institute of 
</p><p>Strategic Planning, said that the USG had been the GOA,s 
</p><p>""main supporter"" during the last 18 months.  Senator Dodd 
</p><p>said he was pleased to hear that the U.S. role had been 
</p><p>constructive, since prior to his visit he had been convinced 
</p><p>that this had not been the case. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶16. (C) Another topic of discussion was the contrast between 
</p><p>the faster than expected economic recovery and the 
</p><p>persistently high level of individuals still living below the 
</p><p>poverty line.  Economist Artana noted that the economy would 
</p><p>soon be back to where it was during its previous peak in 
</p><p>¶1998.  Nevertheless, poverty and structural unemployment had 
</p><p>doubled during the same seven-year period.  In addition, two 
</p><p>out of four of those employed work in the informal sector, 
</p><p>and a third works for the public sector.  Political and 
</p><p>military analyst Vicente Massot observed that Argentina is a 
</p><p>""very peculiar country"" where social problems increase at a 
</p><p>time when social conflict goes to zero.  He argued that the 
</p><p>lack of social conflict was due to the weakness of civil 
</p><p>society and the political system's successful co-optation of 
</p><p>the unions.  Economic consultant Esteban Fernandez described 
</p><p>President Kirchner as a ""neo-populist economic conservative,"" 
</p><p>who takes a populist approach to politics while maintaining 
</p><p>conservative fiscal and monetary policies.  Senator Dodd 
</p><p>responded that despite the problems, the overall lunch 
</p><p>conversation had been much more positive than the 
</p><p>conversations that he had had a year ago. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶17. (C) Comment:  All of the CODEL,s interlocutors, up to 
</p><p>and including the President, spoke highly of the GOA,s 
</p><p>cooperative relationship with the U.S. and President Bush's 
</p><p>strong support for Argentina.  At the conclusion of the 
</p><p>luncheon, Senator Dodd acknowledged that he had come to 
</p><p>Argentina believing that the Administration had not been 
</p><p>helpful but recognized that the Bush Administration had been 
</p><p>engaged in suppporting Argentina.  End Comment. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶18. (U) CODEL Dodd did not review/clear on this cable.
