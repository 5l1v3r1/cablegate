<br>STATEMENT 
<br> 
<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>¶1. (U) On April 21, Paraguay, in its capacity as temporary President of Mercosur, issued a statement calling upon the "political and social forces of Ecuador to preserve democracy" and seek a peaceful solution to the crisis occurring in that country. According to the press, Paraguay,s statement 1) recalled the Protocolo de Ushuaia -- the declaration that articulates the democratic principles to which Mercosur members subscribe -- which excludes partners in the event of a rupture with democracy and 2) affirmed that Mercosur would support the approach of the recently created South American Community of Nations. 
</p><p>¶2. (C) FM Leila Rachid confided to the Ambassador on April 21 that Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim had insisted that the Mercosur statement refer to the "South American Community of Nations" (SACN) and not to the Inter-American Democratic Charter. She argued against the idea because the SACN is merely a gleam in the eye at this point; it was announced as a proposal last year but it lacks structure, a set of guiding principles agreed to by members and any other normal characteristics of "institutionalization." Amorim prevailed, however, because she suspected Duarte Frutos would not back her if she resisted (subject of a septel). 
</p><p>¶3. (C) Rachid noted that Amorim said he wanted no mention of the Inter American Democratic Charter because that would be an invitation for the OAS, and therefore the U.S., to "meddle" in "regional" (i.e., South American) issues that "we should be taking care of ourselves in the region." She added the personal comment that Amorim is pushing an agenda designed to minimize U.S. influence in South America and assert Brazilian dominance, a course she strongly opposes because it translates into unfettered Brazilian control of Paraguay's destiny.
