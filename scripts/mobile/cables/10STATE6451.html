 ¶1.  (SBU)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS ARE CLOSELY MONITORING 
CIVIL/MILITARY TENSIONS IN TURKEY THAT HAVE BEEN BUILDING 
DURING THE TWO-YEAR ERGENEKON INVESTIGATION.  TURKISH GENERAL 
STAFF (TGS) CHIEF OF DEFENSE ILKER BASBUG, IN A 17 DECEMBER 
SPEECH, WARNED THE GOVERNMENT, JOURNALISTS, AND JUDICIAL 
OFFICIALS AGAINST PURSUING INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST SENIOR 
OFFICERS. TWO DAYS LATER, POLICE DETAINED TWO MILITARY 
OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE HOME OF DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER BULENT 
ARINC, WHERE THEY WERE ENGAGED IN APPARENT SURVEILLANCE 
ACTIVITIES, LEADING TO THE FIRST POLICE SEARCHES OF SPECIAL 
FORCES OFFICES AND FURTHER DETENTIONS OF MILITARY OFFICERS. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE INFORMATION ON THIS 
SURVEILLANCE, SUBSEQUENT POLICE SEARCHES, DETENTIONS OF 
MILITARY OFFICERS, THE STATE OF MILITARY/POLICE AND 
CIVIL/MILITARY RELATIONS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF THOSE 
RELATIONSHIPS THAT POST CAN PROVIDE, AS TIME AND RESOURCES 
PERMIT. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED FOR UPCOMING ANALYTICAL 
PRODUCTION TO KEEP POLICYMAKERS ABREAST OF THE SITUATION. 
 
¶A.  (SBU)  WHY WAS ARINC BEING SURVEILLED? WHO AUTHORIZED 
THIS SURVEILLANCE? WHO ELSE KNEW ABOUT IT? WHAT OR WHO TIPPED 
OFF POLICE? DURING THE SEARCH WHAT WERE THEY LOOKING FOR AND 
WHAT DID THEY FIND? WERE THE INVESTIGATORS LOOKING FOR 
SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OR WAS IT A GENERAL SEARCH FOR INFORMATION? 
 HOW DO TURKISH LEADERS PERCEIVE THESE EVENTS? 
 
¶B.  (SBU)  WHAT IS THE STATE OF CIVIL/MILITARY RELATIONS? 
 
¶C.  (SBU)  WHAT IS THE STATE OF MILITARY/POLICE RELATIONS? 
HAVE THESE ARRESTS CAUSED OR INCREASED TENSIONS BETWEEN 
POLICE AND THE MILITARY? 
 
¶D.  (SBU)  DOES THE JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY, OR 
ELEMENTS WITHIN IT, SEE THIS INCIDENT AS A MEANS TO FINALLY 
"TAME" THE TGS OR DOES PRIME MINISTER TAYYIP ERDOGAN WISH TO 
EASE FURTHER CONFRONTATION AND APPEASE THE TGS? 
 
¶3.  (U)  PLEASE CITE C-RE9-02710 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS. 
CLINTON</p>
