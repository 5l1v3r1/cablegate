¶1. (C) Summary: Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega visited 
Tripoli December 19-22, ostensibly to promote south-south 
cooperation and compare notes on the "anti-imperialist" 
movement; however, senior contacts at the General People's 
Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation 
(MFA-equivalent), told us the visit was largely symbolic and 
that Ortega devoted much of his visit trying to drum up cash for 
his political operation and investment in Nicaragua.  Like 
Bolivian President Evo Morales before him, Ortega left Libya 
empty-handed.  While Libya seeks to balance reengagement with 
the U.S. with high-profile meetings with anti-U.S. leaders, it 
seems to lack both the capacity and the interest to pursue more 
substantive interaction with Latin American governments.  End 
Summary. 
 
ORTEGA PASSES THE CUP, LEAVES EMPTY-HANDED 
 
¶2. (C) In a December 29 meeting, MFA Secretary for the Americas 
(A/S-equivalent) told A/DCM that Nicaraguan President Daniel 
Ortega's four-day visit to Libya was "largely symbolic" and 
appeared to have been largely motivated by Ortega's need for 
financial assistance.  Fituri, who heads the Libya-Nicaragua 
Cooperation Committee, participated in almost all of Ortega's 
program, including his three meetings with Libyan leader Muammar 
al-Qadhafi, a fellow "long-time revolutionary".  Ortega 
highlighted consultations on developments in Latin American 
integration, South-South (i.e. Latin American-African) 
cooperation and coordination in the "anti-imperialist movement" 
in his remarks to Spanish-language press upon his return to 
Managua.  According to Fituri, though, Ortega spent most of his 
time complaining about his tense domestic situation and seeking 
cash for his party, which Fituri described as "extremely cash 
strapped". 
 
¶3. (C) Ortega also met privately with al-Qadhafi's Chief of 
Staff,Bashir Saleh, Secretary of the General People's Committee 
(PM-equivalent) al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, Libyan Investment 
Authority (LIA) Chairman Mustafa Layas and the  and the head of 
Libya's Great Manmade River Project.  Ortega focused in those 
meetings on drumming up investment in Nicaragua's project to 
build a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as 
well as various water treatment projects.  Fituri downplayed the 
possibility that Libya would invest in Nicaragua, noting that 
the LIA did not assess the proposals as either promising or 
profitable and recommended against investment.  Al-Qadhafi 
complained to that Ortega had come mostly to "cry on his 
shoulder" and hold out his hand for contributions, but his hopes 
of receiving a cash infusion apparently went unfulfilled. 
Fituri noted that "the days of the Jamahiriya handing out 
dollars - with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa - are over, 
even for brother revolutionaries". 
 
LIBYA SEEKS SYMBOLIC LINKS, BUT CAN'T AFFORD DEEPER COOPERATION 
 
¶4. (C) Ortega's visit marks the second visit to Tripoli by an 
ALBA president in 2008, in addition to a trip by Argentine 
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.  Bolivian President 
Evo Morales met with al-Qadhafi on the eve of al-Qadhafi's 
speech commemorating the coup that brought him to power on 
September 1.  Morales' trip inaugurated formal Libyan-Bolivian 
ties, but the meeting could have gone much differently.  Spanish 
CDA Rafael Reig told Poloff that he was instrumental in 
facilitating the event given Boliva's lack of representation 
here. (Note: Bolivia has yet to send diplomatic staff to take up 
residence in Tripoli.  End note.)  In the end, al-Qadhafi met 
with the ambassadors of Venezuela, Cuba, and Argentina along 
with Morales - leaving the Spanish envoy to wait in the hotel 
lobby.  Ortega's trip received even less attention in the 
diplomatic corps - none of the Spanish-speaking legations were 
convoked or informed of the visit. 
 
¶5. (C) Comment: While Libya is keen to pursue symbolic alliances 
with anti-U.S. leaders to balance the perception that it has 
gone western by finalizing the U.S.-Libya claims compensation 
agreement, Ortega's visit is illustrative of Libya's more 
pragmatic approach to relationships outside its sphere of 
influence.  Morales' trip occasioned a hastily-prepared draft 
treaty calling for a "South Atlantic Treaty Organization" (ref 
A), but as the price of oil falls and the price of diplomatic 
leadership becomes more dear, Libya will focus its petrodinars 
on al-Qadhafi's more immediate goal of a United States of 
Africa.  Libya's MFA boasts few English speakers and fewer 
Spanish speakers and Latin American diplomats here are not 
active, leaving few channels for substantive exchanges between 
Libya and Latin America.  Libya's interests include showing 
balance after their recent reopening with the West (ref B), but 
 
TRIPOLI 00000002  002 OF 002 
 
 
they are unlikely to accept great financial or political risk in 
non-neighboring relations without the promise of an even greater 
reward.  End comment.
