¶1. (S) On March 4, we delivered reftel demarche to Carlos 
Cordero in the MFA's Department of Disarmament, Terrorism, 
and Organized Crime.  Cordero told us that Costa Rica would 
support the joint U.S.-Chinese 1267 listing but would be 
unlikely to cosponsor the listing because Costa Rica lacked 
strong internal procedures to take actions, such as freezing 
assets. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The GOCR's usual procedure with UN-sponsored 
listings is to provide the names to Costa Rican banking 
oversight agencies and to coordinate with Interpol, though 
these procedures should be strengthened given recent GOCR 
passage of a terrorism finance bill.  (The new bill was 
signed by President Arias on March 4, and will take effect as 
soon as it has been published in the official gazette.) 
Cordero said he would wait to share the information until the 
listing was made public. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: We hope to receive more concrete responses 
from the MFA in the future regarding terrorism finance 
demarches, at least those that are associated with the UNSC 
1267 Committee, with the recent passage of Costa Rica's 
terrorism finance law (Law 17009).  Practically, this law 
strengthens existing legislation on terrorism and contains 
specific language on freezing assets.  As soon as the this 
new anti-terrorism tool takes effect, we will push the GOCR 
to use it, and to seize assets when appropriate.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶4. (U) An unofficial translation of Law 17009's relevant 
language on terrorism finance follows: 
 
"In case of persons and organizations determined by the 
Security Council of the United Nations to be linked to 
terrorism, acting in conformity with Chapter VII of the 
United Nations Charter, the Finance Intelligence Unit (FIU) 
shall arrange for the retention and immobilization of funds 
and financial products, and the immobilization by registry 
annotation of other assets.  When, for purposes of 
investigation, lists of persons and organizations linked to 
terrorism are circulated among the national and international 
institutions indicated in Articles 14, 15, and 15b of this 
Law (which includes financial and insurance regulators, 
financial institutions, as well as the "informal" players 
such as pawn shops, casinos, credit card companies, etc.), 
such institutions shall have the obligation to review and 
report to the FIU of the Costa Rican Drug Institute 
(equivalent to the U.S. ONDCP) if the persons and 
organizations included on the lists possess resources or 
assets in such institutions."
