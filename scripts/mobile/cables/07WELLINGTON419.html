<br>SUBJECT: PROPOSED MARITIME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGREEMENT 
<br>DELIVERED TO COOK ISLANDS HIGH COMMISSION 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. SECSTATE 70068 
<br> 
<br>     ¶B. WELLINGTON 316 
<br> 
<br></pre></p></div><p>for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 7, Acting PolEcon Counselor and Poloff 
delivered to Sonya Kamana, Deputy High Commissioner, Cook 
Islands High Commission the proposed maritime law enforcement 
agreement (Ref A).  Kamana positively received the agreement, 
and said she will share it with appropriate officials in 
Rarotonga.  She will seek an expedited response from the GCI 
regarding its agreement in principle to the proposal, with 
more detailed comments to follow later. 
 
¶2. (C) On June 6, Emboffs met with New Zealand MFAT's Pacific 
and Legal Divisions regarding the draft agreement. MFAT 
recommended that the U.S. approach the Cook Islands High 
Commission alone since the Cooks tend to be sensitive about 
their autonomy with respect to New Zealand.  GNZ has already 
approached GCI regarding problems in their ship registration 
process following some illegal fishing done by CI registered 
vessels near Antarctica, and the GNZ wants to avoid the 
appearance of coming down as a "big brother." 
 
¶3. (C) Comment:  Kamana noted that Cooks Crowne Law has 
little legal capacity for absorbing the legislative load 
represented by the agreement.  However, the MFAT officials we 
met with agreed that this could be a good area for joint U.S. 
and New Zealand bilateral, technical assistance.  Ref B 
outlines some possible areas of joint assistance that could 
enable the Cooks to implement a proposed agreement.  End 
Comment.
