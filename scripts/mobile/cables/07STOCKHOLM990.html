MFA Director for the Middle East and North Africa Peter Tejler told Polcouns that the decision was taken at an August 14 interagency meeting confirming the trip (reftel). The Swedes are holding the information about the visit very closely and will announce it only after Bildt arrives in Baghdad. Tejler noted that the Swedish Embassy in Washington has not yet been informed of the visit. We understand Bildt also plans to visit Irbil. 
</p><p>¶2. (s) A Bildt visit represents a positive change in Sweden's attitudes toward Iraq. During an August 14 meeting with MFA PolDir Skoog, Charge offered our help. The GoS has requested our assistance with security for Bildt, may also seek our help on logistics, and will consult on diplomatic/political aspects of the visit. 
</p><p>Action Request

</p><p>¶2. (s) Stockholm POC for Bildt's visit to Iraq is Polcouns Casey Christensen. We have been promised additional details on the trip by August 17.
