¶1. (C) Summary. Swiss Ambassador Kupfer expressed 
disappointment on January 6 with the FARC's rejection of the 
Swiss-led international commission proposal for a 
humanitarian exchange between the GOC and the FARC.  He 
reported that, despite the setback, international commission 
members (one from France, Spain and Switzerland) would meet 
again with the FARC in Colombia in early 2006 to continue 
discussions on the same proposal. Kupfer said coordinating 
the commission was going along fine for now but the French 
continued to do as they pleased.  He cited the January 3 
announcement that French Foreign Minister Douste-Blazy would 
travel to Colombia to discuss efforts to release 
Colombian-French Ingrid Betancourt.  Kupfer said this was 
news to both the Swiss and Spanish. He also said GOC Peace 
Commissioner Restrepo was a challenge to deal with and that, 
unlike past humanitarian exchange initiatives, the Catholic 
Church had little involvement in this one.  Kupfer 
represented Switzerland, one of the three accompanying 
countries, at the GOC-ELN exploratory talks last month in 
Havana.  He said round two later in January would focus on an 
agenda for future talks, and that the roles of the five civil 
society guarantors and the three countries would have to be 
re-defined.  He predicted the GOC will want less involvement; 
the ELN more.  He said Norway and the ELN pressed for moving 
the talks to Europe.  According to Kupfer, the ELN is looking 
to challenge its placement on the EU terrorist list and wants 
to explore funding opportunities in Europe.  In the end, both 
the ELN and GOC agreed to keep the talks in Havana for now. 
Kupfer underscored that, while the Swiss were happy to go 
along with that, they would support moving the talks to 
Europe if they advanced sufficiently, to enhance their 
legitimacy.  The ELN's placement on the EU terrorist list 
would prove no obstacle to Switzerland if the circumstances 
were right. End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
HUMANITARIAN EXCHANGE PROPOSAL 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (C)  On January 6, polcouns met with Swiss Ambassador 
Thomas Kupfer to discuss FARC rejection of an humanitarian 
prisoner exchange proposal (ref a), put forward by the 
recently assembled "international commission" with 
representatives from France, Switzerland, and Spain.  Kupfer 
expressed disappointment with the FARC reaction, which he 
characterized as a "clear and categorical no."  He said it 
was difficult to find anything positive in the FARC's Dec. 29 
communiqu, and complained that the FARC's leaders were 
playing politics.  First they complained they did not have 
the details of the proposal (which Kupfer said they received 
weeks earlier on December 15 along with the GOC), and then 
they complained they were not accorded sufficient respect 
when it was presented (i.e. by email).  Kupfer insisted that 
the proposal was a good one. "They were stupid to reject it 
because they will only have to back down later," he said. 
 
¶3. (C) Despite the setback and low chance of success, Kupfer 
said the GOC and the FARC leadership had agreed to another 
meeting in Colombia "at the technical level" between 
international commission members and the FARC early in 2006, 
perhaps in January.  He noted that "difficulties with 
organizational details" still needed to be resolved, 
including the FARC's insistence that the GOC not know where 
or when the meeting would take place.  Kupfer stressed that 
the FARC's attitude was unrealistic and that they had to show 
more transparency.  He said upcoming discussions would be 
based on the proposal already rejected by the FARC. 
 
----------------------- 
IMPACT ON U.S. HOSTAGES 
----------------------- 
¶4. (C) Even if both parties finally agreed to discuss the 
possibility of a humanitarian exchange, Kupfer said the 
challenges would be overwhelming.  FARC negotiators have 
added the return of Simon Trinidad and Sonia (both extradited 
to the U.S.) as critical to any deal.  Kupfer speculated that 
the FARC would probably try holding back one or more 
Americans in any exchange, something the GOC had refused to 
consider.  And finally, said Kupfer, the FARC still had not 
decided which FARC prisoners held by the GOC could be part of 
any humanitarian exchange. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
DEALING WITH THE FRENCH, THE GOC; THE ROLE OF THE CHURCH 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶5. (C) According to Kupfer, Switzerland has the coordinating 
lead among the three countries on commission initiatives but 
reining in the French continues to be a challenge. "The 
French generally do what they want," he said.  The latest 
surprise was the January 3 announcement out of Paris that 
Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy would visit Colombia 
soon to discuss efforts to release Ingrid Betancourt.  Kupfer 
complained that Douste-Blazy would presumably not come 
without a new bilateral initiative, something neither the 
Swiss nor Spanish knew anything about.  The only bright spot, 
said Kupfer, was that Spain planned to be much more engaged 
in the process. 
 
¶6. (C) Kupfer acknowledged that dealing with the GOC, in 
particular with Peace Commissioner Restrepo, continued to be 
a challenge.  Restrepo's attitude and style were difficult. 
He was too forthright and stubborn, unwilling to take advice. 
 While everyone was more or less in agreement on the role of 
the international commission, Kupfer was convinced Restrepo 
would seek to limit its involvement when "it could be the 
most useful."  Kupfer concluded that Restrepo had little 
experience in dealing with international community 
facilitators and this would complicate matters in any future 
negotiation. 
 
¶7. (C) Kupfer noted with surprise that, unlike past 
initiatives, the Catholic Church was minimally involved with 
the initiative of the international commission.  He surmised 
that relations between Church negotiator Monsignor Castro and 
the presidential palace, in particular Restrepo, were not 
good.   At the same time, he acknowledged that the Church 
remained skeptical the FARC would agree to anything while 
Uribe is president, an argument strengthened by the FARC's 
most recent communiqu (ref b). 
 
--------------------------- 
GOC-ELN ENCOUNTER IN HAVANA 
--------------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) Kupfer, who attended the December talks in Havana, was 
more optimistic about exploratory discussions between the GOC 
and the ELN, which will resume later this month.  Restrepo 
will meet with the ELN's Francisco Galan on January 11 to 
prepare for a second round of talks.  Kupfer said all the 
goals were achieved during the first round: a dialogue was 
launched, confidence building began, and a follow-on meeting 
was set.  Both parties "prudently" avoided trying to create 
problems for the other.  Round two will still be 
"exploratory" and tackle the agenda for future talks.  He 
noted that in Havana the ELN commander Antonio Garcia at 
first appeared distant and uninformed about the reality of 
present day Colombia, but is now thoroughly engaged in the 
process.  Kupfer reported that Galan was more confident than 
in previous encounters and exhibited less need to take cues 
from Garcia.  Kupfer said Evo Morales' election victory in 
Bolivia gave the ELN negotiating team a psychological boost 
as well. 
 
¶9. (C) Kupfer underscored that the five guarantors were 
crucial in getting both parties to Havana but their function 
at the negotiating table would now need to be re-defined into 
a supporting role.  Kupfer predicted that this would be a 
problem as the five want to continue as major players.  What 
was important now, said Kupfer, was a real facilitator in the 
process. 
 
¶10. (C) Regarding the three "accompanying" countries (Norway, 
Spain and Switzerland), Kupfer said their role, too, would 
have to be clarified, both on the political side as well as 
on the logistics/accompaniment/facilitation side.  The GOC's 
approach so far has been, "we're glad you're here and we'll 
call you if we need you."  Kupfer said Norway in particular 
took considerable umbrage at this.  The ELN, on the other 
hand, wanted the three countries more involved as the process 
develops. 
 
¶11. (C) Kupfer also reported some discussion of Brazil 
joining as an accompanying country but no decision was taken. 
 He stressed that the minimal role played by Cuba and 
Venezuela, the former as host and the latter as facilitator 
for Garcia's travel, was also helpful.  It is better to have 
them involved this way than sabotaging the process from the 
outside, he said. 
 
¶12. (C) According to Kupfer, Norway pressed hard for a 
European venue for the second round; Switzerland and Spain 
did not.  The ELN supported Norway, preferring to travel to 
Europe for political and financial reasons.  Kupfer said the 
ELN complained several times about their terrorist 
designation status and wanted a European venue to challenge 
it. The ELN also made clear that Europe contained 
opportunities for future funding needs.  In the end, the ELN 
agreed to keep the talks in Cuba, as did the GOC.  Kupfer 
underscored that, while Bern was happy to go along with the 
Cuban venue for now, they would support moving o Europe if 
the talks advanced sufficiently, to enhance legitimacy and 
chances for success.  The EU designation of the ELN as a 
terrorist group would prove no obstacle to Switzerland.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶13. (C) For now, U.S. redlines are covered, in particular 
with the FARC initiative, as the GOC continues to insist that 
all American hostages be part of any exchange.  However, we 
will continue to monitor both processes closely as France and 
Switzerland in particular, may begin pressing the GOC to make 
further concessions to keep the initiative with the FARC 
alive.  We agree with the pessimistic assessment of the 
Catholic Church that the odds for a humanitarian exchange 
between the GOC and the FARC remain low.
