¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Finnish PM Vanhanen and Russian PM 
Fradkov met May 29 in Helsinki but were unable to resolve 
a rapidly emerging dispute over Russian tariffs on wood 
exports.  Vanhanen also raised human rights and sharply 
criticized Moscow's handling of the Bronze Soldier 
incident in Estonia.  In side meetings, senior Finnish 
officials pressed Deputy FM Titov to allow a UNSCR in 
support of Ahtisaari's Kosovo proposals to go forward, 
but Titov offered the same old arguments.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen hosted his 
Russian counterpart, Mikhail Fradkov, for a day of 
meetings in Helsinki May 29.  Johan Schalin, Vahnanen's 
Senior Advisor for Foreign Affairs, offered PolChief the 
following readout. 
 
Little Progress on Wood Tariffs 
------------------------------- 
¶3. (C) Vanhanen was able to make little progress in 
convincing Fradkov that Russia needed to rethink its 
decision to unilaterally impose a tariff on wood exports. 
Finland's huge paper industry depends on Russian wood for 
more than 30 percent of its production, and the tariffs 
would present an enormous cost to Finnish business. 
Vanhanen also emphasized to Fradkov that the tariffs are 
clearly not WTO-compatible, Schalin reported.  The WTO 
question is also particularly problematic for the GOF; 
like the US, it is a strong supporter of Russian entry 
into the WTO, Schalin said, but it fears that the wood 
tariff issue could turn into an obstacle to Russia's 
accession process.  However, this worry notwithstanding, 
Vanhanen made it clear that Finland would hold Russia to 
the commitments it made when it began its WTO bid. 
Moscow has consistently demanded that the dispute be 
handled bilaterally, and Fradkov brushed aside Vanhanen's 
insistence that both the EU and WTO considerations had to 
be included in the discussion.  While the two sides made 
little progress, Schalin said that the conversation 
remained amiable. 
 
Sharp Words On Estonia 
---------------------- 
¶4. (C) Things turned less amiable when Vanhanen expressed 
-- in nuanced tones -- the GOF's concerns about human 
rights in Russia.  Fradkov responded by complaining about 
a "European double standard" on these questions, and he 
then launched into a diatribe about the "abuse" Estonia 
committed when it decided to move the bronze statue. 
Vanhanen responded sharply, telling Fradkov that Moscow 
had over-reacted to the issue; had caused the 
international community to question its commitment to the 
Vienna Conventions; and that, for Finland, it was 
"absolutely not acceptable to mess in the affairs of an 
elected, democratic state."  According to Schalin, the 
room fell silent for several awkward moments, then the 
two PMs turned to other issues. 
 
Nothing New on Kosovo 
--------------------- 
¶5. (C) Fradkov was not authorized to discuss other 
issues, Schalin reported, but Deputy Foreign Minister 
Titov did discuss Kosovo on the margins of the PMs' 
meetings with Finnish MFA State Secretary Pertti Torstila 
and U/S for Political Affairs Markus Lyra.  According to 
the Finnish MFA's Russia desk, the Finns pressed Russia 
to find a way to allow a UNSCR in support of UN Special 
Envoy (and former Finnish President) Martti Ahtisaari's 
Kosovo final status recommendations to go forward.  Titov 
did not "use the 'veto' word," our contacts reported, but 
trotted out the usual laundry list of why Russia does not 
support such a resolution (i.e., Belgrade must support 
it; it sets a precedent for the Frozen Conflicts, etc.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶6. (C) Although the Finns made little headway on the wood 
tariff or on Kosovo during Fradkov's visit, it was clear 
that the GOF does not intend to give any ground either -- 
a point that Vanhanen's sharp comments on Estonia further 
emphasized.  End Comment.
