¶1. (C) Summary:  PolOff delivered demarche to Finnish MFA 
Deputy European Correspondent Markku Lampinen on July 23. 
 
Somalia: The Government of Finland (GoF) would like more 
concrete political action on Somalia from the EU.  The GoF 
supports the Djibouti Peace Process and the Somali 
Transitional Federal Government (TFG).  The Somali Minister 
of Justice visited the GoF July 21-22 to request assistance 
in rule-of-law training. Lampinen expects initial discussion 
on an EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, and 
plans to nominate Pekka Haavisto, the Finnish Foreign 
Minister's Special Representative for the Horn of Africa . 
 
Iran: The GoF continues to support current EU diplomatic 
actions on Iran, but is prepared to support a tougher 
response with EU consensus. Lampinen expressed regret that 
the detentions had dominated discussion and hoped that 
attention would soon return to Iran's nuclear program and the 
post-election situation.  Separately, Lampinen expects some 
discussion over how to handle the Iranian presidential 
inauguration.  GoF is leaning away from a full boycott. 
 
Georgia: On U.S. participation in the EU Monitoring Mission 
(EUMM), Lampinen said that the GoF has no formal position and 
generally welcomes third country participation, especially 
U.S. participation.  Lampinen said that the EUMM one-year 
extension is an "A-point" and would be approved without 
discussion. GoF favors closer relations for Georgia with the 
EU and supports negotiations to move Georgia from a 
cooperation agreement to an association agreement. 
 
Other External Affairs:  Lampinen said that GoF favors 
Icelandic EU membership. Lampinen expects a conclusion on how 
to move forward on Kenya's slow down in the reconciliation 
process and reform agenda implementation. 
End summary. 
 
Somalia 
------- 
 
¶2. (C) Lampinen said that the GoF would like more concrete 
political action from the EU on Somalia instead of just 
discussion.  Working groups have given recommendations based 
on an EU options paper and discussion should move forward. 
GoF supports the Djibouti Peace Process and the TFG. 
Lampinen noted that the Somali Minister of Justice visited 
Finland on July 21 and 22 to meet with parliamentarians and 
MFA officials as part of a Nordic tour.  The Minister 
requested humanitarian support for Somalia, as well as Nordic 
assistance with long-term training in rule-of-law for 
tribunal judges and police. Somalia's Minister of Justice 
disagreed with the EU assessment that the EU operation 
against Somali pirates is a success, arguing that the problem 
is worsening. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Lampinen expects initial discussion at this GAERC on 
an appointment of an EU Special Representative for the Horn 
of Africa.  He said that the GoF will suggest Pekka Haavisto, 
who has been the Finnish Foreign Minister's Special 
Representative for the Horn of Africa and has experience in 
Sudan and Darfur. Haavisto has said that a broader basis for 
reconciliation is necessary and more opposition groups will 
need to be included.  Lampinen noted that preparing for 
Somali long term reconstruction, even starting it now in 
stable areas, would be important. 
 
Iran 
---- 
¶4. (C) The GoF continues to support the EU 3 3 and the 
twin-track policy, emphasizing EU unity and cooperation with 
the U.S.  Lampinen noted that the G8 declaration was an 
important message to Iran.  He added that the GoF expects the 
EU to continue working for the release of the French hostage. 
 Lampinen expressed regret that the detentions had dominated 
discussions and hoped that attention would soon return to 
Iran's nuclear program and the post-election situation. 
Lampinen said that the GoF is prepared to support tougher 
action on the post-election situation should the EU find 
consensus. 
 
¶5.  (C) Separately, Lampinen expects some discussion over how 
to handle the Iranian presidential inauguration. GoF is 
leaning away from a full boycott.  Logistically, downgrading 
Finnish attendance, which is one alternative to a full 
boycott,  would be difficult as the Finnish Embassy in Iran 
has an Ambassador but not a deputy. Lampinen remarked that 
the  EU should continue to pay attention to the worsening 
human rights situation in Iran.  He reminded PolOff that the 
MFA has summoned the Iranian Ambassador three times:  over a 
stoning, over the post-election situation and over the 
British detentions. 
 
Georgia 
------- 
¶6. (C) On U.S. participation in the EUMM, Lampinen said that 
the GoF has no formal position and generally welcomes third 
country participation, especially U.S. participation. 
Although the EUMM Operations Commander told Finland that EUMM 
reinforcement is not currently required, the GoF would 
support reinforcement in the future as needed.  Lampinen said 
that the EUMM one-year extension is an "A-point" and would be 
approved without discussion.  Lampinen said that the EU 
should not become a mediator between the Georgia government 
and its opposition groups, especially since the EUMM is the 
only remaining international presence. 
 
¶7. (C)  In possible further discussions, Lampinen noted that 
GoF supports the following points: (1) A  continued 
international presence in Georgia remains important (2) The 
EUMM should be strong enough and the mandate large enough to 
be effective (3) The aim has to be international access to 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia (4) The Geneva process should be 
continued with all parties. GoF wants Georgia to carry out 
promised reforms and find internal consensus with their 
citizens themselves.  Notably, he said that the GoF is in 
favor of closer relations between Georgia and the EU.  The 
GoF favors starting negotiations in September to move Georgia 
from a cooperation agreement to an association agreement. 
As a final point, he said that GoF would like to see the EU 
send a message on the anniversary of the war, stating that 
Georgia should neither provoke nor be provoked. 
 
Other General Affairs 
---------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) Lampinen said that in general, the GoF supports the 
Swedish presidency program as the program represents Finnish 
priorities very well.  He noted in particular that the Baltic 
Sea Strategy is very important to Finland.  The Ministers 
will discuss Iceland's EU application and the GoF is very 
much in favor of Icelandic membership.  Lampinen expects a 
conclusion on how to move forward on Kenya's slow down in the 
reconciliation process and reform agenda implementation.
