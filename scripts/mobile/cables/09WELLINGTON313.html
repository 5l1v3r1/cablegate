<br>SUBJECT: Vice Premier Li Keqiang Visit Underscores New Zealand's 
<br>Bilateral Relationship with China 
<br> 
<br></pre></p></div><p> 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  During a November 27 meeting with ChargC), 
Political and Economic Chief and Econoff, New Zealand Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs China Desk Director Grahame Morton gave a read-out 
of Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang's November 1-3 visit to New 
Zealand.  Morton said Li's initial visit to the region had been put 
on hold after it became entangled in tensions between China and 
Australia over the alleged Rio Tinto espionage issue.  The main 
focus of the visit was economic, with discussions about currency, 
trading and investment.  Morton also reported that Li was "forward 
leaning" on New Zealand's Global Alliance proposal that aims to 
reduce agriculture related greenhouse gases through joint 
cooperation on research.  During the visit, China and New Zealand 
signed four agreements on education, temporary workers, dairy 
product certification, and offal standards.  Regarding Tibet 
issues, New Zealand's Prime Minister Key confirmed he will not meet 
with the Dalai Lama during his December 4-7 visit to Auckland, but 
New Zealand officials did press Li on Tibet and encouraged dialogue 
between the two sides.  End summary. 
 
 
 
Visit Comes as a Surprise to New Zealand 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Li's visit was originally scheduled for September but was 
postponed because it was scheduled in coordination with a trip to 
Australia, which, according to Morton, was delayed as China and 
Australia hammered out their differences over the alleged Rio Tinto 
espionage case.  New Zealand assumed the entire trip was called off 
because the Dalai Lama is set to visit New Zealand in December, but 
they were "surprised" when they were given only a week's notice for 
the very "unusual" visit.  Morton said that close to all of China's 
top Politburo members have visited New Zealand -- usually in 
conjunction with a visit to Australia, but this was Li's first 
visit to the country.  He came with a large delegation of 43, 
including 6 ministers or vice ministers, and a press contingent. 
He arrived at his first stop in Christchurch in a Boeing 747 and 
prepositioned a Boeing 737 to make the flight to Wellington. 
(Note: Wellington International Airport is not equipped to handle 
747's. End note.)  Given the short notice, New Zealand had the 
option of saying "no", according to Morton, but didn't because "Li 
is one of those in line for the top position."  Morton said they 
were lucky they could muster the right New Zealand ministers to 
meet Li on such short notice, but the press coverage was poor 
because many key journalists were travelling with Prime Minister 
Key at the time. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (C) Morton said that one of New Zealand's objectives was to 
"show the seriousness with which they viewed Li's visit to their 
country," and the GNZ pulled out all the stops to make it a quality 
visit.  Li was officially hosted by Deputy Prime Minister Bill 
English, who also serves as Minister of Finance.  English chaired a 
roundtable for Li that was attended by seven other key New Zealand 
ministers, including Foreign Minister McCully, Attorney-General 
Chris Finlayson, and the Minister for Defense and Research, Science 
and Technology, Dr. Wayne Mapp, among others. Prime Minister John 
Key was also able to return from his trip to Asia in time to have a 
meeting and host Li for a dinner.  While in Christchurch, Li 
visited the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, where he 
attended the founding ceremony of the Confucius Institute and 
delivered a speech.  He also met the Mayor of Christchurch Bob 
Parker.  Morton added that Li and the rest of the delegation left 
very pleased with the caliber of the visit. 
 
WELLINGTON 00000313  002 OF 007 
 
 
Main Focus on Trade and Economics 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
 
¶4.  (C) Morton said the main focus of discussions with China were 
economic in nature, and Li's foremost message during the trip was 
that China's stimulus package had been sufficient to combat the 
slide in its economy following the 2008 global financial crisis. 
Deputy PM English underscored how important China is to New 
Zealand's economy and raised the issue of international currency. 
English relayed to Li that 65 percent of New Zealand's 
international trade is denominated in U.S. dollars, and any move by 
China to devalue its currency against the U.S. dollar has a 
profoundly negative impact on New Zealand exports.  Li replied that 
China's currency needs to remain stable "to shore up demand," 
according to Morton.  In the end, the two sides agreed to continue 
the dialogue on the currency issue.  Morton noted that China is New 
Zealand's third largest trading partner, following close on the 
heels of the United States, which is New Zealand's second largest 
trading partner.  Morton expected that China could soon overtake 
the United States to become New Zealand's second largest partner. 
Bilateral trade growth has been brisk following the signing of the 
April 2008 free trade agreement (FTA) said Morton. China's 
Ambassador to New Zealand claims China is already New Zealand's 
second largest trading partner; however, Morton attributed the 
discrepancy to how the two countries factor in trade with Hong 
Kong.  Morton noted that New Zealand's trade to Mainland China will 
also be boosted by the FTA concluded on November 11 between New 
Zealand and Hong Kong. (Note: Hong Kong is New Zealand's eleventh 
largest export market and a significant source of investment.  End 
note.) 
 
 
 
¶5.  (C) According to Morton, New Zealand's exports to China have 
jumped following the signing of the FTA.  One of the biggest 
winners is the New Zealand dairy industry, which has "benefited 
greatly" because of safety concerns in China following the 2008 
tainted milk scandal.  He added that PM Key's visit to China in 
April 2009 helped smooth over tensions between NZ milk giant 
Fonterra and Chinese officials.  New Zealand now has several 
projects in China to help companies build better food safety 
chains, with a particular focus on the dairy industry.  Morton said 
the objective is to help Chinese companies build lines that are 
more suitable for export. Currently New Zealand does not allow 
Chinese dairy products to enter the country for 
sanitary/phytosanitary (SPS) reasons.  We do not want to "just say 
no", but we eventually want to be able to bring them up to 
standards "so we can say yes to the Chinese on dairy."  Morton said 
New Zealand is also working with China to boost Chinese agriculture 
production.  Fonterra, for example, has invested in Chinese dairy 
farms and other agriculture producers and introduced the latest 
technology and farming techniques.  Although New Zealand's overall 
investment in Chinese agriculture is not huge, it has done 
reasonably well according to Morton.  On investment, Morton said 
that in proportion to the increase in trade between the two 
countries, the increase in investment has been quite low.  "We are 
open to investment in both directions," but we are not the focus of 
large Chinese investment similar to Australia, said Morton.  And, 
New Zealand does not have the same sensitivities to certain assets, 
with the exception of land, as Australia.  Morton believed, 
however, that as relations strengthened between the two countries 
and as New Zealand companies become more accustomed to doing 
business in China, they would boost investment there. 
 
WELLINGTON 00000313  003 OF 007 
 
 
Li "Forward Leaning" on New Zealand's Global Alliance Proposal on 
Greenhouse Gas. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
 
¶6.  (C) In addition to economic issues, Li discussed climate change 
and the run-up to the summit in Copenhagen in the roundtable with 
New Zealand ministers.  According to Morton, Li had a more "forward 
leaning" stance on New Zealand's Global Alliance proposition. 
(Note: New Zealand has been pushing for a Global Alliance to 
research how to cut world-wide emissions from agriculture.  The 
country sees itself in a unique position as the only developed 
country with close to 50 percent of its greenhouse gases stemming 
from agriculture.  New Zealand officials repeatedly emphasize their 
desire to play a key role in helping the world address the twin 
challenges of ensuring food security while reducing carbon 
emissions.  End note.)  Morton said New Zealand was "greatly 
appreciative" of Li's support for and interest in the Global 
Alliance. Morton attributed part of Li's interest to the fact that 
for the first time this year China began gathering statistics on 
agriculture emissions, and China is now the largest emitter of 
agriculture greenhouse gases in the world.  Morton believes Li sees 
New Zealand as a country that can bring "value added" to reducing 
agriculture emissions inside China, noting that Li also underscored 
his interest in the Global Alliance when he met with the PM Key. 
 
 
 
New Zealand and China Sign Four Agreements 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
 
 
¶7.  (C) New Zealand took the opportunity of Li's visit to sign four 
agreements that had been under consideration for some time, 
according to Morton.  The first was a memorandum of understanding 
on cooperation in education and training, with a focus on high 
level research. Morton noted that there are currently 20,000 
Chinese students studying in New Zealand.  This number was down 
from the peak in the mid-1990's when there were close to 50,000 
Chinese students studying in the country.  Many of the Chinese 
students at that time were studying in short-term English courses. 
Now, most of the Chinese students are in tertiary education and 
diverse fields of study.  Morton noted that New Zealand is "more 
comfortable" with the current number of students.  Even with the 
lower numbers, China still remains New Zealand's most significant 
source of foreign students.  The second agreement addressed the 
issue of Chinese entering New Zealand for temporary employment, a 
provision that was made in the FTA that New Zealand signed with 
China.  Morton said the agreement was something that the Chinese 
insisted upon because it spelled out the guidance on how Chinese 
workers would be recruited.  He said the Chinese were concerned 
that "middlemen recruiters" in China would take advantage of the 
program, and China did not want the program to become a liability 
for the country. 
 
 
 
¶8.  (C) The third agreement was a provision that would facilitate 
New Zealand's dairy products into China.  New Zealand wants China 
to recognize its SPS testing measures and certification and is 
pushing for an eventual mutual recognition of each others' 
e-certification.  The agreement was a step in that direction 
whereby both parties committed to observing each others' practices. 
The final agreement involved hygiene standards of New Zealand's 
offal exports to China.  Morton said China has not been happy with 
 
WELLINGTON 00000313  004 OF 007 
 
 
New Zealand standards because they did not meet Chinese market 
requirements.  However, New Zealand has pushed back because they do 
not want China "to confuse international safety standards with its 
own market requirements."  The agreement sets out what the 
standards would be. 
 
 
 
Dalai Lama's December Visit to New Zealand Discussed 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
------ 
 
 
 
¶9.  (C) Morton said that PM Key had earlier conversed with Premier 
Wen Jiaboa concerning the Dalai Lama's December 4-7 visit to 
Auckland, saying that neither he nor any of his ministers would 
meet with the Dalai Lama.  Morton said the Chinese "obviously 
registered" this.  Morton added that the PM and made this decision 
without any consultation, but others in the Government are still 
obliged to respect it.  However, Key has not said that other 
members of parliament cannot meet the Dalai Lama.  Morton also 
noted that before Key became Prime Minister, he met the Dalai Lama 
on other occasions.  However, "the quid pro quo" is that New 
Zealand continues to raise Tibet as an issue and encourages 
dialogue between the two sides, said Morton. 
 
 
 
Bio Notes on Li Keqiang 
 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶10.  (C) Morton, who attended events throughout Li's visit, made 
several comments regarding Li's style and character.  Morton said 
that from his experience, Li was "quite engaging" and had a 
different style than many Chinese leaders.  He likened Li to 
Western style politicians in that Li did not "retreat to rote 
statistics" but answered questions directly and with a certain 
frankness.  Li did not speak English in formal settings but was 
"quite comfortable" speaking English in one-on-one side 
conversations.  His English was not at a "high level, but it was 
sufficient to make himself understood."  Morton said that it was 
apparent that Li had "command of his delegation," which included 
Chinese Ambassador to New Zealand Zhang Limin.  However, Li was not 
overbearing and "commanding", but he sometimes made jokes about 
himself and was comfortable asking other people in his delegation 
to respond to questions and add points to the conversation.  At one 
point, Li even asked the Chinese Minister of Agriculture Sun 
Zhengcai to make a presentation.  Morton also said that Li showed a 
"populist" streak.  Much to New Zealand authorities' surprise, Li 
stopped the motorcade on several occasions unannounced and got out 
to shake hands with onlookers. 
 
 
 
Background on New Zealand/China Relations 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
 
 
¶11.  (SBU) New Zealand and China celebrated 35 years of diplomatic 
relations on 22 December 2007.  The bilateral relationship has 
grown to become one of New Zealand's most valuable and important. 
China is New Zealand's third-largest trading partner, and a major 
source of migrants, students and tourists, and New Zealand views 
China as an important bilateral, regional and multilateral partner. 
 
WELLINGTON 00000313  005 OF 007 
 
 
The relationship between the two countries is characterized by 
regular high-level contacts, and an expanding range of official 
dialogues - both formal and informal.  During Premier Wen Jiabao's 
April 2006 visit to New Zealand, an agreement to hold annual 
leaders' meetings was reached, and two of these have since taken 
place - the first at the second East Asia Summit in Cebu, 
Philippines at the beginning of 2007 and the second during Deputy 
Prime Minister Dr. Cullen's September 2007 visit to China.  This 
was followed by the visit of Prime Minister Helen Clark to witness 
signature of the Free Trade Agreement in April 2008.  (Helen Clark 
made four visits to China during her time in office.)  Prime 
Minister John Key visited China in April 2009 - his first bilateral 
visit to Asia.  A range of New Zealand ministers have made visits 
to China over the past few years, including those with 
responsibility for information and technology, food safety and 
police, defense, health, education, finance, and research, science 
and technology. 
 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU) From the Chinese side, President Hu Jintao made a State 
visit to New Zealand in October 2003, and Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan 
visited New Zealand in March 2007.  Premier Wen Jiabao visited in 
April 2006, and the Chairman of the National People's Congress Wu 
Bangguo visited in May 2005.  Bilateral communication between New 
Zealand and Chinese officials has also expanded over the years. 
Foreign policy, economic and trade talks are held regularly.  There 
are formal bilateral dialogues on SPS issues, agriculture, dairy 
and forestry as well as regular contact on a wide range of other 
issues.  Developments in Tibet in March 2008 put the focus on human 
rights issues for New Zealand, prompting several Government 
statements of concern and a motion by the New Zealand Parliament. 
New Zealand is careful to abide by its joint communiquC) of 1972 to 
refrain from official dealings with Taiwan.  While supporting a one 
China policy, New Zealand still maintains economic and cultural 
ties with Taiwan, an important trade and economic partner. 
 
 
 
Trade Relations Growing Stronger 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶13.  (SBU) FTA negotiations were launched in November 2004 and 
concluded in April 2008 after 15 rounds of discussions.  The FTA 
entered into force on 1 October 2008.  New Zealand is the first 
OECD country to conclude an FTA with China.  Over time the FTA will 
result in the elimination of tariffs on 96 percent of New Zealand 
exports to China and is projected to lift New Zealand's export 
revenue from trade with China by between NZD 225-350 million (USD 
162-252 million) per year.  The FTA built upon the bilateral 
economic relationship established by New Zealand's Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Framework, signed in May 2004 by China's 
Minister of Commerce Bo Xilai and New Zealand's Minister for Trade 
Negotiations Jim Sutton.  In this Framework, New Zealand recognized 
China as "having established a market economy system."  The 
NZ-China FTA is a comprehensive agreement covering trade in goods 
and services as well as investment.  A Most Favored Nation clause 
further ensures that any provisions extended by either New Zealand 
or China to third parties in future trade agreements will 
automatically apply to each other. New Zealand and China also 
entered into binding agreements on labor and environment, aimed at 
encouraging dialogue and co-operation in these areas. More details 
on the FTA and its outcomes can be found at www.chinafta.govt.nz. 
 
 
 
¶14.  (SBU) China is New Zealand's third-largest trading partner. 
According to New Zealand statistics, two-way merchandise trade grew 
 
WELLINGTON 00000313  006 OF 007 
 
 
to NZD 9.7 billion (USD 7 billion) in the year to April 2009. 
Exports to China, valued at NZD 3.08 billion (USD 2.2 billion), 
increased by over 35 percent in the last year, while imports from 
China increased by 12 percent.  China is New Zealand's fourth 
largest export market, after Australia, the US and Japan. China is 
New Zealand's second largest source of imports, after Australia. 
These statistics do not take account New Zealand exports to China 
through Hong Kong (USD 527 million).  Up to one third of exports to 
Hong Kong are destined for the Mainland.  New Zealand exports also 
end up in China via Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries. 
New Zealand's exports to China are dominated by agricultural 
products.  Dairy, wool and oils and fats are the largest 
agricultural exports.  New Zealand's exports to China have 
diversified, however, with forestry (now second only to dairy), 
seafood, machinery, aluminum, and high technology products 
(especially telecommunications products) featuring in New Zealand's 
non-agricultural exports to China.  New Zealand's imports from 
China include electrical machinery and equipment, textiles, 
clothing and footwear, toys, and a wide range of light consumer 
goods. 
 
 
 
Chinese Visitors to New Zealand on the Rise 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
 
¶15.  (SBU) New Zealand's exports are also diversifying in the 
services sector; education and tourism are New Zealand major 
services exports to China.  Besides the large number of Chinese 
students that come to New Zealand visitor (business and tourist) 
numbers from China have grown by a factor of six since New Zealand 
was granted Approved Destination Status (ADS) by China in 1999. 
China has now overtaken South Korea to become New Zealand's 
fifth-largest source of visitors (112,000 in the past year). 
Although there has been a recent down turn following the global 
economic crisis, New Zealand estimates that Chinese visitor number 
will reach 200,000 in the near future, which would make China its 
third-largest visitor market. New Zealand estimates that Chinese 
visitors make an economic contribution in excess of NZD 300 million 
(USD 216 million) each year.  China's investments in New Zealand 
totaled close to NZD 808 million (USD 582 million by the end of 
¶2008. 
 
 
 
Bilateral Investment Increasing -- But Not as Quickly as Trade 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
------------- 
 
 
 
¶16.  (SBU) Most Chinese investment in New Zealand has been in the 
forestry sector.  There is also significant investment in 
manufacturing and commercial construction.  Sectors such as 
property, hotels and restaurants, meat processing, electronics, 
fish farming and tanning have all attracted the interest of smaller 
Chinese investors.  New Zealand companies, including ANZ, Fonterra, 
Richina Pacific, NDA Engineering, Hayes International and PAN PAC 
have major holdings in China.  There are also a number of other 
companies closely associated with New Zealand with strategic 
operations or investments in China: Beca Carter, Biovittoria, TL 
Jones Microscan, and University of Waikato in Shanghai/East China, 
Air New Zealand Engineering, Intuto, Natural History New Zealand, 
Western Institute of Technology Taranaki, and Wools of New Zealand 
in Beijing/North China.  These companies see investment in China as 
important to secure a long-term market for New Zealand products and 
to assist in the penetration of the enormous consumer market 
 
WELLINGTON 00000313  007 OF 007 
 
 
developing in China.  Another company, Ice Breaker, has been able 
to use China as a global manufacturing and distribution base for 
its New Zealand designed and marketed merino wool clothing.  The 
New Zealand China Trade Association is the lead business advocacy 
group in New Zealand that focuses on commercial linkages between 
the two countries. 
 
 
 
New Zealand Official Aid Drawn Down 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
 
¶17.  (SBU) Following a 2005 review its China program, the New 
Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) determined 
that China would no longer be classified a core bilateral aid 
partner.  This decision reflected both China's significant economic 
development and NZAID's increased focus on New Zealand's Pacific 
neighbors.  However, smaller poverty alleviation activities, 
amounting to NZD 500,000 (USD 360,000) per year, continue to be 
carried out under the Development Project Fund in seven Western 
provinces and autonomous regions (Tibet, Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, 
Yunnan, Guangxi and Xinjiang).  Many of these projects assist 
ethnic minority communities or women.  In addition, there is a 
small grant program of NZD 80,000 per year (USD 57,600) 
administered by the New Zealand Embassy in Beijing.
