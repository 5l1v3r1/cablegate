¶1.  (C) Summary:  An opposition politician threatened early 
this week to reveal the identity of a member of Saddam's 
regime who is reportedly seeking residence in New Zealand. 
The Government responded by revoking the visitor's permit... 
of the wrong Iraqi.  The Government's action was taken 
against former Iraqi Diplomat Zuhair Mohammed Al-Omar, whose 
background we had disclosed to NZ officials half a year ago. 
But the Iraqi whose name was revealed by the opposition 
yesterday is an alleged former cabinet official, Amer Mahdi 
Saleh Khashaly (AKA Amer Mahdi Alkashali) who arrived in New 
Zealand only last month. 
 
¶2.  (S/NOFORN) The media has played up the fact that there 
could be as many as five more Baathists on the loose in New 
Zealand, and the Government's humiliation over the incident 
is palpable.  The anti-immigration party that revealed the 
name of the cabinet official will milk the story for all it's 
worth in the run up to elections later in the year.  The fact 
that both men received visas from New Zealand's embassy in 
Bangkok, already cited for consular impropriety, will 
increase the Government's woes and could lead to career 
trouble for the head of Immigration and others.  Blame may 
also eventually fall on Prime Minister Clark in her role as 
Minister in charge of the Security Intelligence Service 
(SIS).  The possibility is clearly not lost on her and she 
has reportedly hounded the SIS head daily for updates. 
 
¶3.  (C) Under NZ immigration law, classified information to 
be used to bar entry to visa applicants judged to be security 
risks, but hearings to determine refugee status -- an 
entirely separate process -- are open and can therefore not 
include classified evidence.  An ongoing case has already 
allowed a former Algerian politician with reported terrorist 
links to take advantage of this loophole.  Ironically, having 
been drawn into the spotlight the Iraqis may now be more 
likely to apply for refugee status, especially if the 
Government withdraws their right to stay here as the result 
of the opposition's claims.  This could be the real election 
issue, as liberal voters tend to see the asylum seekers as 
victims of bad intelligence while more conservative voters 
accuse the Government of providing an open door to 
terrorists. 
 
¶4.  (C) If the Iraqis ask for refugee status, we expect our 
New Zealand counterparts will ask us for any open source 
information we can provide that would enable to enable the 
Kiwis to show the gentlemen the door. NZ officials plan to 
brief us fully on the cases over the next few days. End 
Summary. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶5.  (C) We were called over the weekend by a contact in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) who asked 
whether the NZ Government could release publicly information 
that we had shared with them last October about Z.M. Al Omar, 
a former Iraqi Ambassador to Bangladesh.  MFAT told us that 
the head of the anti-immigration New Zealand First Party, 
former Prime Minister Winston Peters, had threatened to 
reveal that an Iraqi official was in the country and the NZ 
authorities were doing nothing about it. 
 
¶6.  (C) The information we had passed along in October, which 
noted that Al Omar was an unreconstructed Baathist who had 
tried to organize Islamic extremists to foment violence 
against U.S. facilities in Dhaka, had been provided to 
Ambassador Thomas by Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary (Ref B). 
The Foreign Secretary also claimed that Al Omar was seeking 
political asylum in New Zealand. 
 
¶7.  (S/NOFORN) SIS has the power to declare any alien in New 
Zealand a Security Risk based on classified information, but 
New Zealand officials are extremely wary to use this option 
now that the Government is engaged in a high-profile, 
embarrassing court battle in connection to a former Algerian 
MP, Ahmed Zaoui.  The Government claimed he presented a 
security risk, and sought to expel him based on classified 
evidence.  His lawyers demanded to see the intelligence, 
claiming it was spurious, but the third country provider of 
the information refused to declassify it.  Meanwhile, Zaoui 
was determined to be a refugee under the entirely separate 
refugee process.  Zaoui claims his human rights have been 
violated by the use of the intelligence that he cannot see. 
His lawyers, the media, and much of the public regard him as 
a persecuted martyr, and he has even been granted safe haven 
by a monastery as his case slogs through the courts. 
Government officials, who have told us they expect to lose 
the Zaoui case, have not yet revised the laws to close the 
loophole.  In the meantime they want to avoid similar 
situations, which is why MFAT asked us if they could 
publicize the information that we had provided to them on 
Al-Omar. 
 
¶8.  (S/NOFORN) After receiving the weekend's request from 
MFAT, we asked Embassy Dhaka to seek GOB approval to release 
the information (Ref A) and asked Embassy Baghdad if the GOI 
had any information about Al Omar.  We also suggested that NZ 
law enforcement officials look into Al Omar's financial 
arrangements, as he may be using Hussein government funds to 
cover his costs. 
 
¶9.  (C) On Monday, May 2, MFAT informed us that NZ 
Immigration had determined that they could cancel Al Omar's 
visitor's permit on the basis of his application form.  He 
had not in fact applied for asylum or refugee status.  News 
that the Government had revoked the permit of an Iraqi 
diplomat (but which did not reveal his name) hit the media 
that night, following reports that Peters was to reveal the 
Iraqi's name in Parliament the next day. 
---------------------- 
IT'S THE "WRONG" IRAQI 
---------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) On Tuesday, May 3, Peters revealed to Parliament 
the identity of the Iraqi official, as promised.  To the 
government's chagrin, the name he cited was not Al-Omar but 
Amer Mahdi Saleh Khashaly (AKA Amer Mahdi Alkashali), an 
alleged 1980s Iraqi Cabinet Minister who arrived in New 
Zealand last month.  Apparently, Khashaly entered New Zealand 
on an Iraqi passport but used a UN passport to support his 
visa application.  Incredibly, his current whereabouts are 
unknown, and Peters roundly criticized the Government for 
failing to track him down. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) The press, already tipped off by government 
officials about Al-Omar's identity, 
gave wide play to the story that Peters had forced the 
government's hand into revealing the identity of the "wrong" 
Iraqi.  The media also reported that Al-Omar lives in New 
Zealand with his son, a New Zealand citizen.  Despite the 
information we have heard about Al-Omar, his son insists his 
career pre-dates the Baathists and that he has police 
clearance from the current Iraqi regime. Peters declared that 
the Government went looking for a wolf and found a rabbit. 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU) The Government's problems have been compounded by 
the fact that both Iraqis were issued visas by New Zealand's 
Embassy in Bangkok, where an employee was fired in 2003 after 
being accused of selling visas.  Al-Omar reportedly received 
his visa even though the issuing officers knew of his 
background.  The officers had failed to do the right 
background checks on Khashaly.  Immigration Minister Paul 
Swain declared that he had lost all confidence in Bangkok, 
and ordered that from now on all visa applications involving 
nationals from "high risk" countries are to be processed in 
New Zealand.  The Government's embarrassment has increased, 
as a search through Immigration files has revealed that "many 
more" Iraqis associated with the Hussein regime -- the press 
says five so far -- may have been allowed entry into the 
country. 
 
------------------- 
Something is Broken 
------------------- 
 
¶13.  (SBU) So far, the focus of media attention has been on 
Labor Department Workforce Deputy Secretary May Ann Thompson 
(who used to be advisor to the Prime Minister) and 
Immigration Minister Swain.  Peters claimed Swain, "... does 
not have the remotest idea of which Arab -- Osama bin Laden 
or anybody else -- may be in the country and what he is doing 
here."  It seems more and more likely that Swain and others 
may pay for the embarrassment with their jobs.  As of now, 
the Prime Minister has been spared from strong criticism, and 
she even managed a joke at Peter's expense, chiding him for 
his hyperbolic claim during his presentation to Parliament 
that half the Iraqi cabinet was in New Zealand. 
 
¶14.  (S/NOFORN) Behind the scenes, however, there is less 
levity.  The Prime Minister is reportedly hounding the head 
of SIS daily for updates.  Our MFAT source tells us a 
Government task force is meeting daily, and ministries have 
said they will brief us about the controversy within the next 
few days. 
 
¶15.  (C) As we have often remarked, the Prime Minister has 
proven herself capable time and time again of distancing 
herself from the scandals that have arisen during the past 
months, such as the financial questions surrounding outspoken 
Labour MP John Tamihere. But this latest dust-up could have a 
real negative impact on both her (as Minister in charge of 
Intelligence) and the Labor government in the run-up to the 
elections.  Even if all Iraqis are declared not to be 
security risks, the fact that both were able to enter and 
live in New Zealand without detection may raise concerns 
among voters.  If they apply for refugee status, the 
government faces months of embarrassing trials that will 
expose them to criticism from liberals, who will regard the 
Iraqis as innocent victims of U.S. and other countries' 
intelligence, and conservatives, who will declare New Zealand 
a haven for terrorists.  Law and order is already a campaign 
issue here.  Adding lax immigration controls could prove a 
volatile mix. 
 
¶16.  (C/NOFORN) Elections aside, the incident raises real 
questions about New Zealand's border controls and 
coordination among ministries involved with immigration. 
MFAT has admitted to us that despite their and SIS's repeated 
prodding, Immigration failed to look into Al-Omar until 
Peters' threat.  We have heard that Immigration may also have 
been the source of Peter's revelation. If so, there may be 
dissatisfaction within the ranks about the agency's 
performance. 
 
----------------------- 
INFORMATION APPRECIATED 
----------------------- 
 
¶17. (C) MFAT tells us that at this point they do not need any 
information from us about either Iraqi already named because 
neither has asked for refugee status.  But it seems likely 
that one or both may.  Al-Omar, having had his visa revoked, 
would have no other way of staying with his son here over the 
longer term. The Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary had also 
reported that Al-Omar would ask for asylum.  News reports 
claim Khashaly arrived in New Zealand to ask for help from 
Zaoui's lawyers in getting political asylum for him and his 
son. 
 
¶18. (C) In anticipation that Government officials will ask us 
for open source information in the event that Al-Omar and or 
Khashaly ask for refugee status, post would appreciate any 
information that agencies/Embassy Dhaka/Embassy Baghdad could 
provide.  We will also provide more names if and when they 
arise. 
 
19: (U) Minimize Considered.
