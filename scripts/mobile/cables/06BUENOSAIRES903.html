</p><p>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The GOA announced April 18 that it was 
</p><p>seeking acceptance from the Government of Venezuela to name 
</p><p>former airline stewardess, union leader, congresswoman, and 
</p><p>Chavez ally Alicia Castro as the new Argentine Ambassador to 
</p><p>Venezuela.  Castro, 56, is known as one of Chavez's most 
</p><p>ardent supporters in Argentina, and was a main force behind 
</p><p>the ""anti-Summit"" last November in Mar del Plata.  Her 
</p><p>appointment comes at a time when Argentine-Venezuelan 
</p><p>relations were beginning to cool, and may represent an 
</p><p>attempt by President Kirchner to please both Chavez and the 
</p><p>Argentine left.  We believe Castro will continue to advocate 
</p><p>that Kirchner pursue a closer relationship with Chavez rather 
</p><p>than act as a moderating influence.  END SUMMARY. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (C) First elected to Congress in 1997, Castro was 
</p><p>reelected in 2001 and recently vacated her seat in December 
</p><p>¶2005.  From 1991-2004 she also led the union that represents 
</p><p>Argentine flight attendants and pursers and still holds a 
</p><p>high-ranking position within the union.  She worked as a 
</p><p>stewardess for Aerolineas Argentinas from 1969-1990. 
</p><p>Unmarried, Castro currently lives in Buenos Aires with her 
</p><p>18-year old daughter. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (C) Castro is an unflinching supporter of Chavez and his 
</p><p>policies (see reftel).  In 2004, Castro sponsored four 
</p><p>pro-Chavez resolutions in the Argentine Congress.  Last year 
</p><p>Castro called herself ""Chavez's vanguard in this country,"" 
</p><p>and lauded Chavez's economic policies for their ""humanism and 
</p><p>better distribution of incomes."" (Rumors have swirled that 
</p><p>there is also a romantic relationship between the two.) 
</p><p>Castro also said that ""Bush is the real threat,"" and weapons 
</p><p>purchased by Venezuela from Spain ""are part of a strategic 
</p><p>defense.""  In November 2005 she was one of the main speakers 
</p><p>at the anti-American ""People's Summit"" (at which Chavez also 
</p><p>delivered a 2-hour speech) that was held simultaneously with 
</p><p>the Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata.  She also sent a 
</p><p>letter to President Bush several weeks before the Summit 
</p><p>asking him not to travel to Argentina because he represented 
</p><p>""a danger to the democracies of South America."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (C) Kirchner,s decision comes at a time when relations 
</p><p>between Argentina and Venezuela had appeared to be cooling. 
</p><p>Kirchner had canceled a scheduled mini-Summit with Lula and 
</p><p>Chavez to be held in Mendoza after Bachelet,s inauguration 
</p><p>to discuss the Venezuela-Brazil-Argentina gas pipeline 
</p><p>project.  Kirchner had said at the time that not enough 
</p><p>progress had been made in developing a serious project 
</p><p>proposal worthy of discussion by the heads of state. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (C) Kirchner has also remained concerned about Chavez,s 
</p><p>increasingly successful seduction of Morales, which he views 
</p><p>as meddling in Argentina,s backyard.  (Note:  Morales is 
</p><p>playing tough with the Argentines on the gas issue and the 
</p><p>Bolivia-Uruguay-Paraguay mini-Summit in Asuncion has 
</p><p>Chavez,s overt support.) 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (C) In addition, Argentina and Venezuela have been 
</p><p>involved in a spat related to Venezuelan sales of fuel oil to 
</p><p>Argentina in 2004. The Venezuelan oil parastatal, PDVSA, 
</p><p>wants Argentina to pay nearly $20 million in shipping/port 
</p><p>costs when PDVSA vessels had to wait several months to 
</p><p>unload.  Argentina argues that the sales contract did not 
</p><p>cover such a situation and refuses to pay.  Finally, 
</p><p>Argentina,s recent lead role in blocking Venezuelan antics 
</p><p>at the recent CICTE meeting in Bogot brought tensions to a 
</p><p>head. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (C) COMMENT: From our point of view, the timing of 
</p><p>Castro,s appointment couldn't be worse, particularly in the 
</p><p>wake of Argentina,s position on Venezuela at the UNSC. 
</p><p>However, Chavez has not been invited back to Buenos Aires 
</p><p>since the Summit, and some believe that Kirchner may be 
</p><p>outsourcing his Venezuela policy to Alicia in Caracas, while 
</p><p>he tries to put some distance between himself and Chavez. 
</p><p>There is also an emerging rift among Kirchner,s advisors 
</p><p>between Planning Minister De Vido, who wants to avoid 
</p><p>ideology and keep the Venezuelan relationship strictly to 
</p><p>business, and the Bolivarian minority within the Peronist 
</p><p>movement headed by Alicia Castro.  De Vido told us in a 
</p><p>meeting a couple of months ago that Kirchner would gladly 
</p><p>meet with Venezuelan opposition leaders here in Buenos Aires, 
</p><p>and noted that no requests had come in two years.  The 
</p><p>Venezuelan opposition should take him up on this and try to 
</p><p>deflate some of the public momentum that Chavez won with 
</p><p>Castro,s appointment.
