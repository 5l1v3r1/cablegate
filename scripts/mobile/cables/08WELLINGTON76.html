 Â¶1.  (C)  On February 28, Andrew Robinson, a Middle East and 
Africa policy officer from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (MFAT) contacted the Embassy to report on his 
initial feedback from the Ministry of Defense regarding 
possible GNZ assistance on addressing piracy off the Somalian 
coast.  Robinson contacted Lt. Colonel Justin Emerson in the 
MOD's legal division, who indicated that the GNZ would be 
interested in maintaining a dialogue with the USG on the 
types of specific requirements that might be requested from 
the UN.  Robinson indicated that the GNZ was aware of the 
UNSC discussion surrounding Somalia.  The New Zealand Navy, 
he continued, has specialized skills in addressing 
piracy/maritime thuggery, such as nighttime boarding of 
suspect vessels.  He also noted that the New Zealand Navy 
will be sending a frigate to the Gulf region in June.  While 
not making any commitments at this stage, Robinson said that 
the MOD will continue to explore and discuss how New Zealand 
might assist in addressing this issue, and asked that the GNZ 
be kept in the information loop.
