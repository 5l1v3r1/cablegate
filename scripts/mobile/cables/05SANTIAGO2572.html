<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>¶1. (C) Human Rights Watch (HRW) Americas Division Director Jose Miguel Vivanco called on the Ambassador on December 23 to discuss HRW's December 2005 report on the evidence 	implicating former Peruvian President Fujimori.  In 	summarizing the findings of the report (""Probable Cause: Evidence implicating Fujimori	 available on-line at HRW's website www.hrw.org), Vivanco told the Ambassador HRW believed there was more than sufficient evidence in several criminal cases currently pending against Fujimori to justify his extradition to Peru. 
</p><p>¶2. (C) Vivanco said the USG had declassified a number of documents related to Fujimori some time ago.  He asked if there might be others that, if declassified, could be of assistance to Chilean or Peruvian authorities in their legal proceedings against Fujimori.  He explained that while he believed the Chilean Supreme Court eventually would find that 	sufficient evidence against Fujimori exists to justify his extradition to Peru, the process would be lengthy (at least a year) and complicated.  Any additional documents, particularly those that may be related to pending criminal cases against Fujimori in Peru, could be of assistance to Chilean and/or Peruvian authorities.  The Ambassador told Vivanco he would relay his request to the Department.
