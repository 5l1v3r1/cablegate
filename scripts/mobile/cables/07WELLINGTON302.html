¶1.  (C) The GNZ worries that interim PM Bainimarama is 
increasingly fragile and his actions risk throwing the 
country into armed conflict.  Heather Riddell, Director of 
the Pacific Division, calls Bainimarama's measures 
restricting the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) "loopy." 
Bainimarama has now cut himself off from Fiji's traditional 
power base.  This will circumscribe his support base and will 
add to  perceptions that he is running a Fijian Indian 
agenda.  Riddell observes it seems unlikely Bainimarama will 
be able to dig himself out of this hole, and he may become 
more desperate as a result. 
 
¶2.  (C) While the GCC is ridden with factions and some 
Fijians dislike it, most will be shocked by Bainimarama's 
actions.  Riddell is particularly concerned that the measures 
may make an intra-military reaction more likely, and the 
result could be violent mutiny and other bloodshed. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment. While we are not in a position to assess 
MFAT,s concern over possible mutiny and bloodshed, New 
Zealand,s analysis and predictions on Fiji have proven 
exceptionally reliable over the past few months.
