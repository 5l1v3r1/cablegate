¶1. (C)  Former NZ Prime Minister David Lange's private papers 
included a copy of the highly classified 1985-86 Government 
Communications Security Bureau annual report detailing its 
activities, including cooperation with the U.S. National 
Security Agency.  According to an article in the January 15 
Sunday Star-Times newspaper, the paper had been given 
permission by Archives NZ - and by the Labour Cabinet - to 
view the documents following Lange's death in August 2005. 
It is not clear if the Cabinet was aware that the papers 
included a GCSB document, but Cabinet Chief Executive Maarten 
Wevers told Charge January 16 that his staff should have 
known the document was there and removed it from the 
archivable materials.  Wevers said he was under instructions 
from duty Minister Jim Anderton to review Cabinet and GCSB 
procedures to determine how the lapse ocurred and to make 
sure it never happened again. 
 
¶2. (S)  The Sunday Star-Times also excerpted memos to Lange 
from then Minister of Trade & Industry David Caygill and 
Lange's Chief of Staff John Henderson outlining conversations 
with the U.S. Ambassador at the time, covering his concerns 
that the anti-nuclear legislation had eroded trust in New 
Zealand, thereby threatening intelligence cooperation.  The 
newspaper stressed the Ambassador's concern that if New 
Zealand were expelled from the "five-eyes" arrangement, the 
door would be opened for the United States to conduct 
intelligence gathering operations against the Kiwis.  The 
Star-Times labelled the then Ambassador's language "a clear 
threat" and "bully tactics," even though the language used 
made clear that the Ambassador was raising a potential 
concern and did not know whether the aftermath of the 
anti-nuclear flap would result in expulsion of New Zealand 
from the SIGINT community. 
 
¶3. (C)  Comment: The Star-Times article is an embarrassment 
to the Government and to the Prime Minister personally, since 
she is the Minister charged with intelligence oversight.  It 
raises questions about the Government's competence and its 
"non-aligned" credentials.     The PM values the intelligence 
relationship very highly.  It has ensured that New Zealand 
still has some access and influence in Washington while 
allowing Clark to maintain the Labour Party's public 
ambivalence about the U.S. at home.  Maarten Wevers told 
Charge that Clark has instructed he and Minister Anderton to 
kill the story as quickly as possible, so that she does not 
have to face questions about the U.S.-NZ intelligence 
relationship during CDR PACOM Fallon's visit to New Zealand 
later this week.  End Comment. 
 
¶4. (C)  Embassy will not address the intelligence 
relationship even on background.  However, we do intend to 
background select journalists on our view of the former 
Ambassador's comments about the importance of trust, 
stressing the difference between an honest diplomatic 
exchange on matters of mutual concern and "bullying."  A 
fairly accurate and sympathetic two-part docudrama on the 
ANZUS crisis has just aired over the past two weekends, and 
has created an appetite for discussion of the U.S.-New 
Zealand relationship (and the late David Lange's lack of 
veracity) which we would like to exploit while we can.
