¶1. (U) This is a joint Embassy Ankara and Consulate General 
Istanbul cable. 
 
¶2. (C) Summary and comment:  Several Alevi groups organized 
an August 24 rally in Istanbul's Taksim square to protest the 
GOT's policy of requiring primary and secondary public school 
students to take a religious education course.  The groups 
claim the GOT is ignoring an October 9, 2007 European Court 
of Human Right's (ECHR) decision in favor of an Alevi parent 
who argued his child should be exempt from the courses, and 
are appealing to the Council of Europe's Committee of 
Ministers.  Alevi protests, though unlikely to convince the 
GOT to abolish required religious education courses, may 
pressure PM Erdogan to make a meaningful overture to Alevis 
in the lead up to March 2009 local elections.  After so much 
talk but little action, Turkey's highly skeptical Alevi 
population (approximately 15 million) will not be easily 
convinced until it sees tangible results.  End summary and 
comment. 
 
----------------------------- 
Alevis Stage Istanbul Protest 
----------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) With the start of the 2008 school year, Alevi groups 
have raised their voices to protest the government's 
continuation of mandatory religious education courses in 
public schools.  An estimated 150 Alevis held a sit-in 
protest in Istanbul's Taksim Square August 24, demanding 
abolishment of the compulsory high school religion course and 
compliance with the ECHR's October 2007 decision.  The four 
participating Alevi organizations -- Alevi-Bektasi 
Federation, Pir Sultan Abdul Cultural Association, Kocgir 
Cultural Association, and the Free Democratic Alevi Union -- 
announced that protests would continue every Sunday for six 
weeks.  Alevi Bektasi Federation President Ali Balkiz told us 
the groups would continue the protests indefinitely and 
possibly expand them to other cities. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Alevis Contend GOT Ignoring ECHR Decision 
----------------------------------------- 
¶4. (U) The ECHR's October 9 ruling held that the GOT had 
breached the rights -- accorded by the European Convention on 
Human Rights, of which Turkey is a signatory -- of Alevis 
Hasan Zengin and his daughter Eylem by denying Zengin's 
request to exempt his daughter from compulsory religious 
courses, which many Alevis claim have a Sunni bias.  The 
court determined that given the Sunni-oriented curriculum of 
the courses, there was no appropriate exemption procedure in 
place to ensure the religious freedom rights of non-Sunni 
parents (ref A). 
 
¶5. (SBU) Contacts in the Ministry of Education's office of 
religious education told us the ECHR decision is moot because 
while the case was proceeding the Ministry of Education 
revised the content course textbooks to include information 
about non-Sunni religions.  Balkiz criticized the GOT's 
position, explaining that the 10-page addition to 100-page 
textbooks does not alleviate the overwhelming Sunni bias. 
The new text includes only a few references to well-known and 
respected Alevis but makes no attempt to explain Alevi 
history, rituals, or beliefs.  Many Alevis follow the 
teachings of Haci Bektas, a Persian Sufi mystic and humanist; 
the revised textbooks overlook his importance to Alevism and 
refer to Haci Bektas simply as a Muslim scholar, according to 
Balkiz. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Balkiz said the Federation on August 13 appealed to 
the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers the GOT's 
alleged failure to implement the ECHR ruling.  He expects the 
Committee to issue a decision by December.  Balkiz believes 
sustained pressure from EU and COE officials will help 
persuade the GOT to implement the decision.  He noted that 
following a similar dispute, religious education classes in 
Greece were reclassified as elective courses, putting them in 
 
ANKARA 00001599  002 OF 002 
 
 
compliance with Council of Europe guidelines.

Small Steps of Progress 
----------------------- 
¶7. (U) Responding to a key Alevi demand, on September 3 the 
Kusadasi Municipal Council, south of Izmir, officially 
recognized an Alevi worship place (cem house) as a temple. 
AKP mayor Fuat Akdogan and senior Alevi leader Husnu Kirnali 
explained to the press the distinction would allow the cem 
house to receive municipal water free of charge, as is the 
case with mosques.  The unanimous decision taken by council 
members from AKP, opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) 
and opposition National Action Party (MHP), would also serve 
as an example of tolerance for other municipalities to 
follow, according to the mayor. 
 
¶8. (C) AKP MP Reha Camuroglu, an Alevi who resigned June 11 
as PM Erdogan's main advisor on Alevi affairs (ref B), told 
us he welcomed the decision but believes it will not lead to 
significant change in the near term.  He believes the GOT 
will be reluctant to tackle controversial issues related to 
Alevis in the lead up to March 2009 local elections. 
Frustrated by what he perceives as AKP's lack of support for 
his efforts to address Alevi issues, Camuroglu said he may 
leave AKP if PM Erdogan does not signal a willingness to 
address important Alevi and other human rights issues. 
Naming more moderate ministers in a cabinet reshuffle would 
be one such signal, according to Camaroglu.  Another would be 
to implement the Kusadasi municipality's example on a wider 
scale. Ali Kahraman, leader of the Alevi Ege neighborhood 
near Ankara, told us he views the Kusadasi development as 
blatant vote-buying.
