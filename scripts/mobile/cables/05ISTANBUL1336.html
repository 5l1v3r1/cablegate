¶1. (C) Summary: In a farewell luncheon for Consul General, 
Istanbul Chief Rabbi Ishak Haleva noted that he is wrestling 
with a difficult request from a local foundation for a letter 
in support of Fethullah Gulen, the Turkish-Muslim spiritual 
leader of a major Islamist lodge who is currently residing in 
the United States.  Haleva said that those who approached him 
indicated that Gulen will soon seek to adjust his immigration 
status in the United States, and needs the testimonial to 
address the belief in parts of the U.S. government that he is 
a "radical Islamist" whose moderate message cloaks a more 
sinister and radical agenda.  This concern apparently stems 
in part from FBI documents that Gulen supporters received 
through a recent FOIA request in the U.S..  Separately, 
business contacts with links to Gulen confirmed the fact that 
they are soliciting such testimonials at Gulen's personal 
request, while Istanbul Legat was also approached by police 
contacts with Gulenist links who asked that the bureau 
provide a "clean bill of health" for Gulen.   End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Foundation Approach: In his luncheon with the Consul 
General, Haleva emphasized the quandary the Foundation 
request had created for him.  While he did not wish to 
provide an open-ended "to whom it may concern" testimonial 
that could be used broadly (text of the foundation's proposed 
letter is in para 6), given his own lack of certainty of 
Gulen's ultimate intentions, he also could not simply turn 
the request aside, given the assistance Gulen has provided to 
Turkey's Jewish Community in the past.  While no final 
decision has been made, Haleva indicated he is leaning 
towards providing a more limited letter, addressed to U.S. 
immigration officials (he asked that we provide the name of 
an appropriate addressee), and limited to the community's 
specific interactions with Gulen and his movement. 
Subsequently, after learning that the Ecumenical Patriarch 
and Armenian Patriarch had been similarly approached, but had 
demurred, Haleva told Consul General that he was rethinking 
whether even a limited letter is appropriate. 
 
¶3. (C) Encomiums:  Haleva's and his Orthodox and Armenian 
colleagues' wary attitude is similar to that of much of 
Turkish officialdom and of our best contacts among 
conservative Turks with a deep knowledge of Islam and of 
Turkish brotherhoods/lodges, but contrasts with the praise 
Gulen has received in other quarters.  Most notably, the 
Vatican Nuncio surprised a visiting Congressional delegation 
during a recent breakfast meeting here by not just 
enthusiastically praising Gulen, but also presenting the 
delegation's chairman with a book about him. (Gulen's 
meeting with Pope John Paul II several years ago excited much 
controversy in Turkey, with some rival brotherhoods/lodges 
accusing Gulen of selling out while other pious Turks who 
have been among our best contacts assessed the move as the 
ultimate in hypocrisy.) Gulen has also attracted steady 
interest among commentators. Some writers, mainly those who 
write for the Gulenist daily "Zaman" or who teach at the 
Gulenist Fatih University in Istanbul, or who have otherwise 
identified themselves with his movement, assert that Gulen's 
public message of "dialogue" is a more mature expression of 
Islam.  Given the Gulenists' penetration of the National 
Police (TNP) and many media outlets and their record of going 
after anyone who criticizes Gulen, others who are skeptical 
about Gulen's intentions feel intimidated from expressing 
their views publicly.  Privately they note: (1) Gulen's 
sharply radical past as a fiery Islamist preacher in the 
1970's-1980's; (2) his ruthlessness in banishing people from 
his more inner circles (Gulenists have admitted to us that 
they are petrified of making a "mistake"); (3) his and his 
inner circles' insistence that followers of Gulen mediate 
their study of Islam totally through his writings, i.e. no 
tolerance of dissent or critical thinking; and (4) the 
cult-like obedience and conformity that he and the layers of 
his movement insist on in his global network of schools, his 
media outlets, and his business associations. 
 
¶4. (C) Confirmation: The specific Gulenist concern about 
negative U.S. attitudes towards Gulen apparently stems in 
part from a November 2004 FBI report that Gulen's lawyer 
obtained through a FOIA request.  Three ranking Turkish 
National Police contacts recently raised the issue in a 
meeting with Istanbul legat, in which they also provided 
material on Gulen and asked if the FBI could provide some 
sort of "clean bill of health" for him.  (Note: Legat 
demurred, given the apparent intention to mount a public 
relations campaign with such material.)  In a separate 
farewell call on the Consul General, Mustafa Gunay, Secretary 
General of the Gulen-linked Business Life Association (ISHAD) 
confirmed that a general effort is underway to solicit 
testimonials attesting to Gulen's good character.  He noted 
that the initiative stems from Gulen himself, who is 
concerned that some in the U.S. may doubt his good faith, 
given a decision by U.S. immigration authorities this year 
that for the first time denied him the right to travel 
outside of the country. 
 
¶5. (C) Comment: Given Gulen's public message of tolerance and 
"dialogue," and his parallel effort to reconcile Islam and 
science and modernity, a number of Western observers have 
latched on to him as a Muslim teacher (or "hoca") who they 
prefer to see as a voice of "moderate Islam."  He has spoken 
frequently against terrorism (although he is careful not to 
explore the link between some readings of the Koran and 
terrorist violence in the name of Islam).  He has also acted 
in ways which the Jewish community interprets as supportive 
of its existence. 
 
¶6.  (C)  Deep and widespread doubts remain, however, about 
his movement's ultimate intentions.  We have anecdotal 
evidence of the pressure that the various circles of his 
movement put on people they have drawn in, for instance 
severe pressure on businessmen to continue to give money to 
support Gulenist schools or other activities.  We have 
multiple reliable reports that the Gulenists use their school 
network (including dozens of schools in the U.S.) to 
cherry-pick students they think are susceptible to being 
molded as proselytizers and we have steadily heard reports 
about how the schools indoctrinate boarding students. 
 
¶7.  (S) These facts, when coupled with the Gulenists' 
penetration of state institutions, including the TNP (as 
reflected in Istanbul legat's meeting-- Ankara septel will 
address the impact this development has had on police 
anti-terrorism efforts), hint that a much harder line, a 
sense of world-wide Islamist proselytizing mission, lies just 
under the surface.  In short, the Gulenists' efforts to mold 
future generations through their international school network 
(which exists throughout Turkey, Asia (e.g., Afghanistan and 
Pakistan), and Africa, in addition to the U.S.) and their 
documented effort to infiltrate not just Turkish business 
circles but governmental institutions as well have raised 
questions about whether their moderation would continue if 
they gained a preponderant voice in Turkish Islam.  Haleva's 
caution thus appears well-judged.  End Comment. 
 
¶8. (C) Draft letter text (as proposed by the Gulenist 
Foundation) but NOT/NOT accepted by the Chief Rabbi: 
 
To Whom It May Concern: 
 
     As the world has been suffering from violence, 
hostility, and tyranny, mankind became painfully aware of an 
absence of an environment in which people can realize the 
value of understanding of each other, passion, and 
generosity. 
 
     I would like to take this opportunity to talk with you 
about Mr. Fethullah Gulen, who is a Turkish-Muslim scholar 
and a spiritual leader of a global faith-based movement.  Mr. 
Gulen has influenced many people toward creating tolerance 
and dialogue environment through which we can effectively 
respond to world's troubles, including violence and tyranny. 
To my knowledge he is one of the leading figures who can 
bring people together to achieve what I called "world of 
peace."  Mr. Gulen emphasized the necessity of dialogue among 
Muslims. 
 
     However, Mr. Gulen's ideas about tolerance and dialogue 
are not restricted to Muslims but also extend to Christians, 
Jews and members of other faiths.  Mr. Gulen maintains that 
there are more bonds bringing people together, even from 
different faiths, than separating them.  As one of the 
founding members of the Foundation of Journalists and 
Writers, a group that promotes dialogue and tolerance among 
all social strata.  Mr. Gulen has received welcome from 
almost all segments of life.  With this perspective of 
dialogue he has visited and received leading Turkish and 
international figures including Pope John Paul II, the 
Vatican Ambassador to Turkey, the Patriarchs of Turkey's 
Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, and Armenian community, myself as 
the Chief Rabbi of Turkey's Jewish community, leading 
journalists, columnists, television and movie stars, and 
intellectuals. 
 
     I would like to thank you for taking your time to talk 
to you about the mission of Mr. Gulen who dedicated himself 
for the good of others regardless of their beliefs and 
opinions, and embraced them. 
 
     Thank you very much for your attention, and I wish God 
will help us on our mission to create peaceful world. 
 
     Respectfully, 
     Ishak Haleva 
     Chief Rabbi of Jews Community in Turkey
