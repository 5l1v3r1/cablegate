SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (S) In November 2008, pursuant to instructions from the 
Department, Post initiated discussions with the Government of 
Kiribati (GoK) regarding the possible resettlement in Kiribati of up 
to 17 Uighur detainees from Guantanamo Bay (GTMO).  GoK President 
Tong indicated a willingness to discuss the matter further.  In 
December, the Department of Defense (DoD) completed an assessment of 
projects that could be provided to the GoK as part of an arrangement 
to resettle the Uighurs in Kiribati.  The USG now seeks to finalize a 
resettlement framework with the GoK.  Department accordingly requests 
that Post discuss with GoK officials at the highest appropriate level 
to review in detail the necessary assurances set forth in the 
diplomatic note at paragraph ten and obtain written confirmation from 
such officials that the GoK concurs in the understandings set forth 
in the note.  End summary. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶2. (C) The Department asks that Post pursue the following objectives: 
 
-- Commence discussions immediately with GoK officials at the highest 
appropriate level to conclude an arrangement for the resettlement in 
Kiribati of the 17 Uighurs currently detained at GTMO. 
 
-- Explain in detail the humane treatment assurances that the GoK is 
requested to provide to the USG before we can release the Uighur 
detainees to Kiribati for resettlement. 
 
-- Explain that the USG recognizes the financial and political costs 
of this undertaking and that, if the Uighurs can be successfully 
resettled, the USG (1) will provide up to $1.5 million dollars to 
offset the costs of resettlement, and (2) will provide up to $3 
million dollars in projects for Kiribati (note: some projects may 
take a number of years to complete) (see para 5). 
 
-- Propose that once the resettlement framework is agreed upon, the 
USG will work closely with the GoK to identify and address key 
resettlement issues such as legal status, education, employment, 
housing, family relocation, language, religion, security 
implications, costs, and the DoD proposed projects. 
 
-- Deliver the diplomatic note provided in paragraph ten and obtain 
written confirmation that the GoK concurs in the understandings set 
forth in the diplomatic note.  The text of a proposed reply note that 
could be used for such confirmation is also provided at paragraph 
eleven. 
 
 
REPORTING DEADLINE 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) Post should report the result of efforts by cable to S/WCI 
Ambassador Clint Williamson and EAP/ANP Deputy Director Steve 
Schwartz by December 12, 2008. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶4. (S) In response to the Department's request to identify potential 
resettlement options for the 17 GTMO Uighurs, Post suggested that 
Kiribati might be willing to consider a proposal that included an 
adequate incentive package (See Reftels A and B).  In November 2008, 
pursuant to instructions from the Department, Post initiated 
discussions with President Tong  regarding possible Uighur 
resettlement.  President Tong indicated that he was willing to 
discuss the matter further (See reftel C). 
 
¶5. (C) In preparation for further discussions, DoD sent a PACOM team 
to Kiribati that identified incentives that DoD could provide as part 
of the resettlement proposal.  DoD is willing to fund any combination 
of the following projects up to a total cost of $3 million dollars: 
 
-- Causeway Culverts:  The lagoon side of Tarawa is prime fishing and 
swimming grounds, but is increasingly becoming septic due to poor 
drainage into the Pacific.  Construction of causeway culverts would 
facilitate the flow of water from the lagoon into the Pacific, hence 
cleansing the lagoon.  The estimated cost is $1 million spread over a 
five year construction timeline of $200,000 per year. 
 
-- Desalinization Kits:  These kits require little to no maintenance 
and would allow for rapid expansion of potable water throughout 
Kiribati.  The estimated cost for 1,250 of these kits is $500,000 
($400 per kit). 
 
-- Solar Lighting Stations:  These are low tech, minimal maintenance 
stations, dramatically expanding the utility of community centers and 
athletic fields.  The estimated cost for 1,500 stands is $750,000 
($500 per stand). 
 
-- New Community Centers:  Locally constructed facilities deteriorate 
after a few years.  PACOM construction would use cement floors and 15 
year roofs, significantly expanding the lifespan of the unit for the 
community.  The estimated cost to build approximately 4-5 centers is 
$750,000. 
 
-- A housing unit for the Uighurs. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The USG wants resettlement of the Uighurs in Kiribati to be 
as successful as possible.  In order to ensure that resettlement 
issues are identified and addressed, the USG will work closely with 
GoK officials on key resettlement issues such as legal status, 
education, employment, housing, family relocation, language, and 
religion. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Litigation of the Uighur cases continues in the federal 
courts.  The District Court Judge's October 7th order to release the 
17 Uighur detainees into the United States has been stayed pending 
appeal.  The appellate court heard argument regarding the district 
court's authority to order release into the United States on November 
24th.  It is unclear when the appeals court might issue its decision. 
 If the Uighurs are not transferred from GTMO, DoJ advises that the 
case will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court and there is a 
significant chance the Court would hear the case. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Any effort to transfer the Uighurs in the interim, 
including resettlement in Kiribati, will require that advance 
notification be given to the Uighurs' lawyers.  The USG has 
challenged this notice requirement on appeal in the federal appeals 
court, but a decision has not yet issued.  Upon receiving notice, the 
Uighurs' attorneys will have an opportunity to seek an injunction in 
the District Court blocking the transfer.  Although it is unclear 
what the District Court Judge would do if faced with a motion to 
enjoin transfer in the Uighur case, it is possible that the transfer 
could be enjoined, at least temporarily. 
 
¶9. (S) The Governments of Australia (GoA)and New Zealand (GoNZ) are 
aware of our approach to Kiribati.  The GoA is still considering a 
USG request to resettle the Uighurs (Note:  Department believes that 
the GoA is contemplating the acceptance of only a few of the 17 
Uighurs).  While considering this request, the GoA sent a list of 20 
questions regarding the Uighur detainees.  DoD drafted a response to 
those questions that noted security risks associated with Uighur 
detainees that were in Afghanistan in September 2001, which included 
the 17 GTMO Uighur detainees.  In order to be fully transparent with 
the GoK, we should be prepared to present the DoD responses to them. 
In any event, the GoA is likely to share the information with the 
GoK.  The Department will convey the DoD responses to the 20 
questions by separate e-mail. 
 
¶10. (SBU) TEXT OF EMBASSY'S DIPLOMATIC NOTE 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
The Embassy of the United States of America presents its compliments 
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of Kiribati and 
has the honor to refer to discussions between the Governments of the 
United States of America and Kiribati held in Tarawa, Kiribati in 
November 2008, regarding seventeen ethnic Uighur detainees under the 
control of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
 
As a result of these consultations, the United States and Kiribati 
have reached certain understandings, set forth below, that when 
confirmed by a diplomatic note from the Government of Kiribati will 
establish the basis for the Government of the United States to begin 
the process of releasing Uighur detainees who are held by the 
Department of Defense from the control of the Government of the 
United States to Kiribati for resettlement.  The timing and 
modalities of any such release, including a point of contact in 
Kiribati to facilitate coordination of any release, and the person or 
persons to be released, as well as resolution of key resettlement 
issues, will be established through further consultations between the 
two Governments.  Any person released by the Government of the United 
States to Kiribati pursuant to these understandings is referred to in 
this note as "a released person." 
 
The Government of the United States requests written confirmation of 
the following understandings: 
 
¶A.  The Government of Kiribati is to resettle a released person after 
the release has been completed.  The Government of Kiribati is to 
treat a released person humanely and in accordance with the laws and 
international obligations of Kiribati, which include the UN 
Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. 
 
¶B.  The Government of Kiribati will not subsequently transfer a 
released person to the custody and control of the Government of the 
People's Republic of China. 
 
If the Government of Kiribati shares these understandings, the 
Embassy proposes that this note, together with the Ministry's reply 
to that effect, constitute a shared understanding reached between the 
two Governments. 
 
The Embassy of the United States of America avails itself of this 
opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Government of Kiribati the assurances of its highest consideration.
