Summary 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1. (S/NF) Charge d'Affaires met with General Oscar Naranjo, 
Director of the Colombian National Police (CNP), on December 15 to 
discuss Colombia - Panama law enforcement cooperation.  Naranjo 
repeatedly stressed that cooperation with Panama would be 
completely coordinated with the USG, and that the CNP would pull 
back if the USG was ever uncomfortable.  He was relieved to hear 
that the USG welcomed GOC-GOP law enforcement cooperation, provided 
it was coordinated with USG activities.  Naranjo said that the 
following lines of cooperation were discussed during his December 9 
meeting with Panamanian President Martinelli:  coordinated border 
patrols; GOC participation in a GOP intelligence and operational 
facility; intelligence sharing to capture Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC) leaders; lessons learned from combating 
urban crime in Colombia; and sharing the CNP's criminal database 
with the GOP.  Naranjo assured the Charge that the GOC has never 
discussed bombing FARC camps in Panama with Martinelli's 
government.  Naranjo warned Martinelli of Venezuelan involvement in 
drug trafficking and support for the FARC.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
¶2. (C) Charge d'Affaires met with General Oscar Naranjo, Director 
of the Colombian National Police (CNP), and Colonel Jose Luis 
Vargas, CNP Intelligence (DIPOL) Chief, on December 15 to discuss 
Colombia - Panama law enforcement cooperation, particularly along 
the border.  DEA Regional Director, ORA Chief, and Deputy Political 
Counselor (notetaker) also attended. 
 
 
 
Law Enforcement & Intel Cooperation 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶3. (S) Naranjo explained that during a conversation between 
President Alvaro Uribe and Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, 
Martinelli invited Naranjo to visit Panama to discuss law 
enforcement cooperation in the border area.  Naranjo noted that 
during the Ibero-American Summit in Portugal at the end of 
November, Colombian Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez and Vice 
President / Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Varela had agreed to 
negotiate a framework document for law enforcement cooperation, 
under the existing bilateral police agreement.  Naranjo and Vargas 
traveled to Panama December 9, and met with Martinelli, Varela, 
Secretary General of the Council of Public Security and National 
Defense Olmedo Alfaro, National Police Director Gustavo Perez, 
National Border Service (SENAFRON) Director Frank Abrego, and 
others.  Naranjo noted that Martinelli's presidency provided a 
great opportunity for improved bilateral collaboration compared 
with Torrijos' presidency. 
 
 
 
¶4. (S/NF/rel Panama) During the December 9 meeting, the following 
lines of cooperation were discussed: 
 
 
-- Coordinated patrols along the border:  patrols could be simply 
notified to the other country, in parallel on their respective 
sides of the border, or with combined units.  The GOC would be 
comfortable with whatever the GOP wanted; 
 
 
 
-- Colombia participating in a GOP intelligence analysis and 
operational command facility on Pino Island (which has a GOP 
landing strip); 
 
 
 
-- Martinelli's request for intelligence sharing to capture 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 57th Front leaders 
(specifically alias "Silver," alias "el Becerro," and alias 
"Nader").  GOC agreed and had already sent 26 CNP to Panama on 
December 2 to administer polygraphs, expand intelligence sharing, 
and help verify the location of FARC camps to determine possible 
operational targets; 
 
 
 
-- Martinelli told Naranjo that urban crime was booming in Panama, 
and was a bigger problem than the FARC.  He asked for information 
on lessons learned from the GOC's Citizen Security program; and 
 
 
 
-- Naranjo offered to share the CNP's criminal database with the 
GOP so that the GOP can know if Colombians entering or found in 
Panama have criminal records.  Naranjo expects this database 
sharing to be online within a month. 
 
 
 
Warnings re. Corruption and Venezuela 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5. (S/NF) Naranjo said he warned Martinelli that increased 
cooperation could lead him to identify corruption within the GOP, 
and Martinelli accepted that.  Naranjo also cautioned that 
Venezuela plays an increasing role in the drug trade and 
counternarcotics cooperation might well bring Panama into frictions 
with the BRV.  Naranjo cited Amilcar Figueroa as an example. 
Martinelli had the same impression regarding BRV ties to 
narcotrafficking and Venezuela's threat to Panama.  He said 
Panamanian authorities might have been able to act against Figueroa 
if the Colombian government had advised the Panamanian government 
sooner of Figueroa's activities and the arrest warrant against him 
in Colombia (Naranjo told us he doubted Martinelli would have been 
able to pull anything off).  Naranjo agreed to share the GOC's 
information on Venezuelan ties to the FARC. 
 
 
 
No Plans for Bombings in Panama 
 
------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶6. (S/NF) In response to Charge's questions on operations against 
the FARC, Naranjo and Vargas said that bombings have never been 
discussed with the Panamanians.  There is no identified target 
 
location yet, and the GOC would defer to the GOP's preference as to 
whether any operation would involve solely Panamanian forces 
(perhaps those trained in Colombia's Junglas Special Forces 
school), GOC advice, or joint forces.  This decision has not yet 
been made; only target individuals have been identified.  Naranjo 
added that a bombing operation would likely have politically 
problematic ramifications.  Coordinated activities along the lines 
above would be far more useful. 
 
 
 
GOC Will Not Proceed Without USG Blessing 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶7. (S) Naranjo repeatedly stressed that Colombian cooperation with 
Panama would be completely transparent and coordinated with the 
USG.  The GOC would not take any action with Panama that would 
interfere with USG operations in Panama or make the USG 
uncomfortable.  If the USG did not completely accept the CNP 
working with Panama, Naranjo would not do so -- the relationship 
with the USG was too important. 
 
 
 
¶8. (S/NF) Though it was a Colombian/Panamanian decision, the Charge 
welcomed Colombian - Panamanian security cooperation, as long as 
activities were fully coordinated with USG operations in the area. 
He said the information Naranjo had just provided would ease any 
concerns.  DEA Regional Director and ORA Chief also stressed that 
direct Colombian - Panamanian police cooperation was welcome and 
that their agencies in Colombia and Panama were coordinating. 
Naranjo was visibly relieved. 
 
 
 
¶9. (S/NF) The CNP Commander said he had not heard from the GOP 
since the GOP's December 10 meeting with Ambassador Stephenson 
(reftel).  During their December 9 meeting, Naranjo urged 
Martinelli to inform the U.S. Embassy in Panama, as he regularly 
does the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.  Naranjo said that during the 
meeting, Alfaro stated that Colombia - Panama cooperation should be 
autonomous, with no need to involve the USG.  However, Naranjo said 
he replied that the USG was Colombia's key partner, and must be 
kept informed (especially on any efforts involving high value 
targets).  Martinelli instructed Varela to inform the U.S. Embassy 
in Panama.
