¶1.  (C)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS GREATLY APPRECIATE THE 
COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING ON THE JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (AKP) AND OPPOSITION BEFORE AND AFTER LOCAL ELECTIONS PROVIDED BY EMBASSY ANKARA AND CONGEN ISTANBUL.  ANALYSTS HAVE USED THE REPORTING IN AN ARRAY OF CURRENT PRODUCTION AND BRIEFINGS TO POLICYMAKERS. ANALYSTS WOULD APPRECIATE ANY 
ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS POSTS COULD PROVIDE REGARDING THE 
OPPOSITION REPUBLICAN PEOPLE'S PARTY (CHP), AS TIME AND 
RESOURCE PERMIT. MANY THANKS AND REGARDS FROM WASHINGTON. 
 
¶A.  (U)  INTERNAL CHP ISSUES:

2)  (SBU)  WHAT IS THE CHP'S POSTURE TOWARDS THE US AFTER 
POTUS'S APRIL VISIT? 
 
3)  (SBU)  ARE THERE ANY PLANS FOR AN EARLY CHP PARTY 
CONGRESS? 
 
4)  (C)  WHAT IS CHP LEADER DENIZ BAYKAL'S HOLD ON THE PARTY? ARE THERE ANY POSSIBLE THREATS TO BAYKAL'S LEADERSHIP INTERNALLY?  IF SO, ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING OUTSIDE SUPPORT AND IN WHAT FORM?  WHAT GIVES ANY PROSPECTIVE CHALLENGERS THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT FARE BETTER THAN PREVIOUS CONTENDERS? 
 
5)  (C)  WHAT IS BAYKAL'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHP PARLIAMENTARY WHIP KEMAL KILICDAROGLU?  HOW DOES THE CHP VIEW KILICDAROGLU'S ELECTION RESULT IN THE ISTANBUL MAYORAL RACE? WHAT MEASURES MIGHT BAYKAL BE CONSIDERING TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST KILICDAROGLU'S POPULARITY? 
 
6)  (SBU)  WHO WITHIN THE PARTY TAKES THE LEAD ON DEVELOPING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF PARTY POLICY,  SUCH AS KURDISH OUTREACH, THE ECONOMY, AND/OR LABOR ISSUES? 
 
7)  (C)  WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION ON 
KILICDAROGLU'S PROSPECTS IN CHP, HIS BACKGROUND, AND POSSIBLE POLITICAL PLANS.  WHO ARE HIS POLITICAL ALLIES? WHO ARE OTHER CREDIBLE POTENTIAL CHALLENGERS AND/OR SUCCESSORS TO BAYKAL FOR THE PARTY LEADERSHIP? 
 
8)  (SBU)  WE WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE ANY ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION ON THE STATE OF CHP'S RESOURCES AND ORGANIZATION. 
 
¶B.  (U)  CHP AND OTHERS: 
 
1)  (SBU)  WHAT IS THE AKP'S VIEW OF CHP'S LOCAL ELECTION 
RESULT? 
 
2)  (C)  WHAT ARE THE CHP'S PLANS TO COUNTER THE AKP 
GOVERNMENT?  HOW MUCH EFFORT IS THE PARTY EXPENDING TO DEVELOP POLICY, VIS-A-VIS OTHER MECHANISMS TO COMBAT AKP, SUCH AS REFERRING LAWS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT? 
 
3)  (C)  WHAT IS CHP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TGS?  HAS IT 
CHANGED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS? IF SO, WHAT SPARKED THE CHANGE? 
 
4)  (SBU)  WHAT IS THE CHP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DSP, DTP,
