Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)  Failed PRD candidate for president Balbina 
Herrera publicly alleged September 24 that Secretary of State 
for Security Jose Almengor had withheld evidence during the 
past presidential campaign that incriminated President 
Martinelli in the David Murcia scandal. That scandal 
contributed to the defeat of Herrera, who was accused of 
having accepted campaign contributions from Murcia. Herrera 
claims that Almengor, who was the lead drug prosecutor at the 
time, obtained a cassette that indicated Martinelli had 
received an $800,000 campaign contribution from Murcia. 
Almengor is now strongly rumored to be one of Martinelli's 
picks for two slots on the Supreme Court (ref A). Herrera 
claimed Almengor had accepted a pay off for his silence by 
working for the government. Almengor denied the charges, but 
Post had received information during the campaign from 
Martinelli's campaign manager that indicated there might well 
have been a connection. DEA also reports that Almengor came 
across information that implicated Martinelli during his 
investigation of Murcia, and that he suppressed the 
information. End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Balbina Strikes Back 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  According to Panama City daily La Estrella, on 
September 24 former Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
presidential candidate Balbina Herrera publicly alleged that 
Secretary of State for Security in the Ministry of the 
Presidency, and former lead drug prosecutor, Jose Almengor 
had covered up evidence that President Ricardo Martinelli 
received an $800,000 campaign contribution from David Murcia, 
convicted in Colombia and indicted in the U.S. for fraud and 
money laundering. Murcia had publicly stated that Herrera and 
PRD candidate for mayor of Panama City, Roberto Velazquez, 
had each received $3 million campaign contributions from him. 
This accusation damaged each of their campaigns, and they 
both lost. Herrera now claims that Almengor, who was one of 
the prosecutors working on the Murcia investigation in 
Panama, obtained a cassette that showed that Murcia had 
donated $800,000 to Martinelli's campaign. Almengor resigned 
as a prosecutor during the investigation after the Attorney 
General criticized him for allowing one of the suspects to 
leave the country. Almengor began working for the Martinelli 
government almost immediately after the election, and it has 
been strongly rumored that Martinelli intends to appoint him 
to the Supreme Court. Referring to these rumors, Herrera 
said, "How well they have paid you, Jose Abel Almengor!" 
 
------------------- 
Half Hearted Denial 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U)  La Estrella quotes Almengor giving a very specific 
denial: "In the investigation that took place, no request was 
made to the Penal Chamber of the Supreme Court for any video 
or filming. There are no (recordings) in the case file, nor 
is there any evidence that there ever was." He noted he did 
not lead the campaign finance portion of the investigation, 
but rather the money laundering portion. He said he had not 
decided if he would submit his name for consideration for 
nomination to the Court. 
 
------------ 
Twisted Tale 
------------ 
 
 
¶4.  (S//NF)  Right before the scandal over Murcia's alleged 
financing of the two PRD candidates broke in March, 
Martinelli's campaign manager, and now Minister of the 
Presidency, Jimmy Papadimitriu told Emboff that news was 
about to break that Martinelli had received a large campaign 
contribution from the Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht 
that was carrying out several very large public 
infrastructure projects in Panama (the Martinelli government 
drew criticism recently when it awarded Odebrecht a no-bid 
contract for a $60 million road construction project.) 
Papadimitriu claimed that Odebrecht money had been 
accidentally "commingled" by Martinelli's lawyer, Alma 
Cortez, in accounts belonging to Murcia. Cortez was Murcia's 
lawyer in Panama. 
 
------------------- 
Further Connections 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  DEA reports that Panamanian Director of Tourism, 
and one of the main strategists of Martinelli's campaign, 
Salo Shamah has a brother, Alberto Shamah, who worked as 
Murcia's pilot. According to a DEA source, Alberto Shamah 
once flew Martinelli,s plane with Murcia on board. After the 
Murcia scandal broke, all records of that flight disappeared. 
The source further alleged that Almengor knew about the 
flight while he was investigating Murcia, but suppressed the 
information. Almengor himself told DEAFSN that Salo Shamah 
had originally put him in touch with Papadimitriu, from which 
began his relationship with the Martinelli government. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  There is a lot of noise about the 
Martinelli-Murcia-Almengor connection, which is putting the 
story Papadimitriu told us last March in a fresh light. It 
now seems likely that there was a Martinelli-Murcia 
connection. Almengor's inexplicable rise to prominence is 
causing the story to rise from the dead, and threatening 
Martinelli's image as an anti-corruption crusader. This 
potential damage to his moral authority is the most 
significant aspect to the story. There is also, however, a 
possibility that Martinelli could be blackmailed by others 
who have information about this connection, which may be at 
least part of what is fueling his desire for political 
intelligence (ref B).
