<br>SUBJECT: Intelligence Chief Proposes Reform to Severely Restrict USG 
<br>Vetted Units 
<br> 
<br></pre></p></div><p>REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action message, see paragraph 5. 
 
¶2. (S//NF) The head of Panama's Council for Public Security and 
National Defense (Consejo, or CSPDN), Olmedo Alfaro, has told 
Embassy officers that the GOP plans to introduce new legislation 
soon that would make it unlawful for Panamanian government servants 
to receive payments from a foreign government.  In separate 
meetings on December 15 and 16, Olfaro told the Embassy's ICE chief 
and RSA chief that the GOP would institute the new measure as part 
of its reform of GOP security structures.  The Panamanian National 
Assembly is currently sitting in extraordinary session until 
December 31, and post believes that this new security legislation, 
which is rumored to contain other controversial measures related to 
wiretaps, could be introduced during this holiday period when 
public scrutiny will be less than normal. 
 
¶3. (S//NF) Such a measure, depending on how it is implemented, 
could significantly reduce the effectiveness of our DEA, ICE and 
other vetted units.  As currently structured, the individual 
members of some of those units receive payments from the USG that 
supplement their base salaries.  In other cases, the heads of the 
units are given monthly amounts which cover minor expenses such as 
tolls, fuel, meals and costs related to operations.  Our ability to 
pay the vetted units helps to recruit the best talent from within 
the police and intelligence organizations.  The vetted units are 
absolutely vital to the success of USG law enforcement and 
intelligence operations in Panama, which are responsible for more 
cocaine seizures than any other country in the transit zone.  Any 
GOP action that restricts their operation will have an immediate 
and potentially detrimental effect on both Panamanian and U.S. 
security interests. 
 
¶4. (S//NF) Post proposes to demarche senior GOP leadership in the 
coming days with the following talking points: 
 
- Skyrocketing violent crime is the number-one concern of 
Panamanians, and the USG shares that concern and wishes to assist 
the GOP in lowering crime levels. 
 
- Sensitive investigative units (SIUs) are vital to the fight 
against crime in Panama, and are helping to take violent criminals 
off the streets and reduce the flow of drugs, money and weapons 
that is fueling Panama's fast-rising crime. 
 
- SIUs work directly with U.S. agencies but serve the interests of 
Panama as well as the United States 
 
- Restricting the ability to make payments to SIUs will make it 
more difficult to recruit and retain good officers for these units 
which have proven to be the most successful in fighting crime. 
 
- The only other countries in this region that restrict payments to 
SIUs are Bolivia and Mexico. 
 
¶5. (C) Post welcomes input soonest from WHA on our approach to the 
GOP concerning this matter.
