  		<h1>EGYPT: NDP READY TO RUN ON A "FOR YOU" PLATFORM REF: 2008 CAIRO 2310 Classified By: Minister-Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs Donald A. Blome1.(C) Key Points: -- As promised, the National Democratic Party's sixth annual conference focused on economic and social development including expanding economic opportunity through investment, decentralization, poverty alleviation, an expanding social safety net, an overhaul of the health care system, and the announcement of a supplemental 10 billion Egyptian Pound (LE) spending package for the coming year. -- Speakers often failed to distinguish between the party platform and government policies, referring to accomplishments like the implementation of constitutional amendments, the creation of 64 new seats for women in the People's Assembly, or Egypt's success in weathering the international financial crisis. -- President Mubarak opened and closed the conference, and as party leader, was praised by other speakers. Gamal Mubarak played a prominent role in the conference and was present throughout. -- Political reform was not a key theme at the conference, but speakers at the conference, including President Mubarak, called for a "constructive" opposition. -- Neither the 2011 presidential elections nor succession were discussed at the conference. Despite a denial of any internal inter-generational dispute, there were marked differences of style.</h1>
