</p><p>¶1. (C) Summary:  Recent moves by the Government of Argentina 
</p><p>(GoA) undermine the independence and efficacy of Argentine 
</p><p>agencies with jurisdiction over corruption cases.  In early 
</p><p>March, Manuel Garrido, Argentina's chief prosecutor for 
</p><p>corrupton cases resigned, claiming frustration over 
</p><p>perceived limitations placed on his authorities by Prosecutor 
</p><p>General Esteban Righi.  From late 2008 through February 2009, 
</p><p>the head of the National Auditor General's Office (AGN), 
</p><p>Leandro Despouy, spoke out publicly against what he, the 
</p><p>press and the opposition characterized as GoA attempts to 
</p><p>limit his purview.  Both Garrido and Despouy have 
</p><p>investigated and publicly reported findings implicating 
</p><p>irregularities by Kirchner officials and allies.  President 
</p><p>Kirchner appointed a family friend, Julio Vitobello, to head 
</p><p>the Anticorruption Office (OA) and another ally, Carlos 
</p><p>Pacios, to replace Vitobello in the National Comptroller,s 
</p><p>Office (SIGEN).  In the Kirchners' home province of Santa 
</p><p>Cruz, a Kirchner niece is in charge of the ""investigation"" 
</p><p>into questionable land deals involving the Kirchners and 
</p><p>their circle. These developments point to a weak and 
</p><p>emasculated institutional framework in Argentina's 
</p><p>intermittent attempts to combat public corruption.  End 
</p><p>Summary 
</p><p> 
</p><p>GARRIDO'S RESIGNATION 
</p><p>---------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2. (U) In mid-March, Argentina's top District Attorney in the 
</p><p>National Prosecutor's Office for Administrative 
</p><p>Investigations (FIA), Manuel Garrido, resigned from the FIA 
</p><p>after five years as its head.  Garrido, opposition 
</p><p>politicians, respected NGOs, local press, and blogs 
</p><p>criticized the GoA's treatment of Garrido and characterized 
</p><p>the forced resignation as a loss in Argentina's fight against 
</p><p>corruption.  Garrido claimed his resignation stemmed from 
</p><p>Prosecutor General Esteban Righi's promulgation of Resolution 
</p><p>147/08 in early November 2008, which reduced the FIA's 
</p><p>powers.  The FIA was created by law to investigate potential 
</p><p>criminal activity of national public officials.  Righi's 
</p><p>resolution establishes that the FIA would no longer have a 
</p><p>direct role in cases that did not initiate with a criminal 
</p><p>complaint by the FIA, reflecting a restrictive interpretation 
</p><p>of the FIA's legal authorities and effectively constricting 
</p><p>Garrido's ability to intervene in cases against public 
</p><p>officials. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3. (U) Garrido sharply criticized Righi's measure, warning 
</p><p>that the FIA would cease to exist as an independent and 
</p><p>specialized entity to prosecute crimes committed by public 
</p><p>officials and requesting Congressional action.  Garrido 
</p><p>further suggested that the lack of a specialized, independent 
</p><p>body investigating public corruption went against Argentina's 
</p><p>duties as a signatory to the United Nations Convention 
</p><p>Against Corruption.  Righi retorted that Garrido should 
</p><p>abstain from ""self-promoting campaigns"" regarding his role in 
</p><p>the fight against corruption. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4. (SBU) Garrido had distinguished himself as the prosecutor 
</p><p>who filed or advanced the most high-level corruption cases 
</p><p>implicating administration officials.  Garrido had an 
</p><p>important role in the following cases: the alleged 
</p><p>manipulation of the National Statistical Agency (INDEC) by 
</p><p>Secretary of Internal Commerce Guillermo Moreno; the Skanska 
</p><p>corruption allegations; the bag of money found in the office 
</p><p>of then-Economy Minister Felisa Miceli; the alleged illicit 
</p><p>enrichment of Nestor Kirchner and, separately, of the former 
</p><p>debt negotiator Daniel Marx; the overpricing of public works 
</p><p>contracts; the installation of electricity cables in southern 
</p><p>Argentina by Electroingenieria, a company with close ties to 
</p><p>the Kirchners which employs the son of Planning Minister De 
</p><p>Vido; the management of official GOA advertising by Press 
</p><p>Secretary Enrique Albistur; train repairs by Transport 
</p><p>Secretary Ricardo Jaime; and the decision process for 
</p><p>granting highway concessions.  Press reports noted, however, 
</p><p>that although Garrido had launched over a hundred 
</p><p>investigations in five years (compared to four investigations 
</p><p>in nine years by his predecessor), he had not obtained any 
</p><p>convictions during his tenure. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>A CHORUS OF COMPLAINTS 
</p><p>---------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5. (U) In announcing his resignation, Garrido complained he 
</p><p>had suffered ""infinite difficulties, setbacks, and trip-ups 
</p><p>and inexpressible episodes of resistance, administrative and 
</p><p>structural deficiencies.""  Garrido told newspaper ""La Nacion"" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>he was convinced that Argentina offered impunity to 
</p><p>corruption.  His resignation letter was reportedly a long 
</p><p>attack on Righi's resolution and the harm it produced to the 
</p><p>authorities of the FIA and to anticorruption efforts in 
</p><p>general.  In his conclusion, Garrido asserted that, while 
</p><p>corruption is common to all countries, Argentine corruption 
</p><p>regrettably sets itself apart in its impunity and the lack of 
</p><p>commitment to confront it. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6. (U) From the opposition, Radical Party (UCR) Senate leader 
</p><p>Ernesto Sanz, the vice president of the Council of 
</p><p>Magistrates, sought to call attention to Garrido's 
</p><p>resignation.  UCR National Deputy and bloc leader Oscar Aguad 
</p><p>claimed Garrido was mistreated and cornered by the 
</p><p>administration for being one of the few with the courage to 
</p><p>challenge its power.  Civic Coalition National Deputy and 
</p><p>bloc leader Adrian Perez also joined the criticism, 
</p><p>explaining the resignation as a consequence of the 
</p><p>administration,s deliberate policies to weaken and destroy 
</p><p>the country,s institutions of control.  Center-right PRO 
</p><p>National Deputy Esteban Bullrich accused the administration 
</p><p>of obstructing corruption investigations. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7. (U) Laura Alonso and Delia Rubio, of the NGO Citizen Power 
</p><p>(Poder Ciudadano), said the resignation was a setback in the 
</p><p>fight against corruption.  Similarly, the Center for the 
</p><p>Investigation and Prevention of Economic Criminality (CIPCE) 
</p><p>denounced Garrido's resignation as an additional indicator of 
</p><p>Righi's unwillingness to investigate economic crimes.  CIPCE 
</p><p>claimed ""the judicial system systematically fails in its 
</p><p>mission to clarify the penal responsibility of the 
</p><p>businesspeople and officials involved in such acts.  And, 
</p><p>clearly, the Ministry of Public Prosecution has the primary 
</p><p>responsibility for this situation."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>THE DEFENSE 
</p><p>----------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8. (U) Righi denied all of the accusations against him and 
</p><p>said he would have preferred for Garrido to remain in his 
</p><p>position.  At the same time, Righi accused Garrido of 
</p><p>damaging the reputation of the Prosecutor General's office by 
</p><p>filing highly publicized but poorly documented, premature 
</p><p>criminal complaints.  Righi said he had not limited Garrido's 
</p><p>authorities. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>PARTING SHOTS 
</p><p>------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶9. (U) Before he left, Garrido filed several more criminal 
</p><p>complaints implicating GOA officials.  One accuses Claudio 
</p><p>Uberti, the former toll road regulator who was fired in the 
</p><p>""Valijagate"" scandal, and Jorge Simeonoff in the Planning 
</p><p>Ministry of administrative irregularities and presumed 
</p><p>collusion with the highway construction firm Coviares in 
</p><p>contract negotiations.  The other two cases accuse the 
</p><p>Executive Branch of irregularities in the management of 
</p><p>campaign financing -- specifically regarding the broadcasting 
</p><p>of political events on a private cable network using public 
</p><p>funds -- and presumed irregularities and in another highway 
</p><p>concession with the firm Caminos del Valle SA.  Garrido 
</p><p>presented the campaign finance complaint to the National 
</p><p>Electoral Chamber.  Garrido also filed a criminal complaint 
</p><p>alleging overpricing in an electricity cabling project run by 
</p><p>Electroingenieria, a company with close ties to the Kirchner 
</p><p>administration. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>TRANSPARENCY UNDER ATTACK 
</p><p>------------------------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶10. (SBU) The Argentine National Accounting Office (AGN) is 
</p><p>at the center of a second set of debates about independent 
</p><p>voices in the Argentine government structure.  The press gave 
</p><p>prominent coverage to a shouting match at a public meeting in 
</p><p>February of the AGN's governing board.  The Congress set up 
</p><p>the AGN to be headed by someone, currently Leandro Despouy, 
</p><p>named by the opposition to audit the GOA.   At the February 
</p><p>meeting, Despouy thwarted efforts by Kirchner allies to limit 
</p><p>his authority in setting the agenda for the AGN and impede 
</p><p>publication of the agency's reports.  Despouy noted that not 
</p><p>a single AGN report had been refuted in seven years, but 
</p><p>warned the AGN was at risk of losing its credibility as had, 
</p><p>he claimed, the GOA's controversial statistics agency 
</p><p>(INDEC).  He identified the AGN report on overpricing in a 
</p><p>public works project awarded to Electroingenieria as the 
</p><p>leading factor prompting the GOA's move against him.  The 
</p><p>report was posted to the AGN website on December 3, 2008, 
</p><p>after being approved and signed by all seven General Auditors 
</p><p>in Resolution 199/08-AGN and being submitted to Congress, but 
</p><p>it was removed in January when the GOA denied its existence 
</p><p> 
</p><p>and content.  On February 10, ""Clarin"" published an editorial 
</p><p>piece by Despouy in which he defended the AGN's record and 
</p><p>called attention to the administration's attack on 
</p><p>transparency as represented by its attempt to limit the 
</p><p>publication of AGN reports.  The AGN report on 
</p><p>Electroingenieria was reposted online and remained available 
</p><p>as of early May 2009. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>KIRCHNERIST ALLIES ATOP SIGEN AND ANTICORRUPTION OFFICE 
</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶11. (SBU) President Kirchner in January transferred Julio 
</p><p>Vitobello, head of the National Comptroller's Office (SIGEN), 
</p><p>to take over as head of the Anti-Corruption Office (OA) in 
</p><p>place of Abel Fleitas Ortiz de Rozas, who died in December. 
</p><p>The OA falls under the Ministry of Justice and has 
</p><p>jurisdiction to investigate any use of state funds. 
</p><p>Vitobello was brought into the Kirchner administration by 
</p><p>former Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez.  From 2000 to 2003 he 
</p><p>served in the Buenos Aires city legislature for the Peronist 
</p><p>Party (PJ) and from 1993 to 1997 he served as chief of staff 
</p><p>to the Interior Secretary.  ""La Nacion"" said Vitobello had 
</p><p>opened the lowest number of investigations ever during his 
</p><p>2008 tenure at the head of SIGEN, part of a chorus of 
</p><p>accusations that Vitobello as head of the OA would not 
</p><p>fulfill his mandate to investigate official corruption 
</p><p>proactively and effectively.  Vitobello is reported to be 
</p><p>close to the Kirchners and joins in weekend soccer games 
</p><p>organized by former president Nestor Kirchner at the Olivos 
</p><p>presidential residence.  Vitobello was replaced in SIGEN by 
</p><p>the former adjunct Comptroller General, Carlos Pacios, 
</p><p>another official reported to be close to the Kirchners and 
</p><p>former Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>REAL ESTATE GAMES: ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</p><p>------------------------------------ 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶12. (U) In the Kirchners' home province of Santa Cruz, the 
</p><p>investigation of a case against members of the administration 
</p><p>and thir allies in the business sector remains stalled.  The 
</p><p>case focuses on the preferential sale of large properties to 
</p><p>approximately 50 top administration officials, including the 
</p><p>Kirchners, and pro-administration businesspeople during the 
</p><p>final years of the tenure of Nestor Mendez, the mayor of El 
</p><p>Calafate from 1995 to 2007.  The investigation is in the 
</p><p>hands of prosecutor Natalia Mercado, who is the daughter of 
</p><p>Minister of Social Development Alicia Kirchner and niece of 
</p><p>former president Nestor Kirchner.  The case began with a 
</p><p>formal complaint filed by local UCR leader and former mayoral 
</p><p>candidate Alvaro de Lamadrid and it focuses on the purchase 
</p><p>of municipal land by the Kirchners and close associates, 
</p><p>including Rudy Ulloa, Lazaro Baez, Carlos Sancho, Fulvio 
</p><p>Madaro, Natalia Mercado herself, Romina Mercado, Julio Ciurca 
</p><p>and Ricardo Etchegaray.  Nestor Kirchner reportedly re-sold 
</p><p>two hectares (20,000 square meters) to a Chilean investment 
</p><p>group for US$2 million -- forty times what he paid after less 
</p><p>than two years.  Lamadrid also alleges that the municipality 
</p><p>promotes a public works policy designed to benefit these VIP 
</p><p>landowners.  Mendez is at the center of the case, accused of 
</p><p>abuse of authority and influence trafficking.  Now a 
</p><p>provincial congressional deputy for the Victory Front (FPV) 
</p><p>party, Mendez insists the sales were legit. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>COMMENT 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶13. (C) Argentina's corruption scandals frequently make a big 
</p><p>splash at the outset, only to dissipate into oblivion due to 
</p><p>the languid pace of the ""investigations"" and the endless 
</p><p>juridical ping-pong to which they are submitted.  According 
</p><p>to the local NGO Center for the Study and Prevention of 
</p><p>Economic Crimes, corruption cases in Argentina took 14 years, 
</p><p>on average, to be resolved and only 15 out of 750 cases tried 
</p><p>resulted in convictions (see also Ref B).  At the FIA, 
</p><p>Garrido kept up a frenetic level of activity in launching 
</p><p>over 100 investigations, but he did not obtain a single 
</p><p>conviction in over five years.  At the AGN, Despouy gets high 
</p><p>marks for maintaining high standards of integrity, but 
</p><p>questions persist as to the AGN's efficacy and impact.  At 
</p><p>the OA, Vitobello's cozy chumminess with the Kirchners 
</p><p>suggests a conflict of interest, as does the court decision 
</p><p>in Santa Cruz to have the Kirchners' niece investigate 
</p><p>questionable land deals.  Glaring weaknesses in key 
</p><p>components of Argentina's anti-corruption architecture point 
</p><p>to an emasculated institutional framework incapable of 
</p><p>providing needed checks and balances.  For these and other 
</p><p>reasons, Transparency International again named Argentina in 
</p><p>mid-April among nine countries in the region that failed to 
</p><p>implement established anticorruption practices.
