Summary \
------- \
 \
1.(C) Ambassador Coneway advised Swiss State Secretary of \
Foreign Affairs Michael Ambuehl today that Swiss efforts to \
persuade Iran to return to negotiations were being \
misinterpreted in the press and risked sending mixed messages \
to Iran, especially given Switzerland's status as U.S. \
protecting power.  Ambuehl countered that there was a value \
to having a neutral, disinterested party like Switzerland \
deliver the tough message that Tehran is isolated and must \
suspend enrichment.  Ambuehl stressed that Bern viewed \
Washington as its "most privileged" partner on Iran and that \
his office made a point of briefing the Embassy soon after \
the recent meetings.  The Ambassador underlined that having \
forewarning of high-level Swiss-Iranian contacts would help \
avoid misunderstandings.  Ambuehl agreed to consider the \
Ambassador's points and noted that he was scheduled to speak \
to U/S Nick Burns later in the day.  End summary. \

The Relative Merits of Engagement or Silence \
-------------------------------------------- \
 \
2.(C) The Ambassador met with State Secretary Ambuehl on \
February 16 at Ambuehl's invitation to discuss recent Swiss \
meetings with Iranian officials (reftels) and to convey USG \
concerns that Swiss actions might be misinterpreted.  Swiss \
DFA Americas Desk officials Yvonne Baumann and Urs Hammer, as \
well as Embassy Poloff, joined the meeting.  The Ambassador \
cited the varying reports found in the Swiss and \
international press about what the Swiss were up to, \
including reports describing the Swiss activity as a \
mediation initiative.  While the USG trusted Ambuehl's \
description of what was discussed in the meetings, the \
Iranians were presenting a different interpretation in their \
statements, official and unofficial.  Clearly, Swiss efforts \
were being used by the Iranians and misinterpreted by the \
press. \
 \
3.(C) Ambuehl asserted that Iran well understood that \
Switzerland was acting on its own behalf, not as a proxy for \
the United States.  The Swiss had numerous dialogue partners, \
including the Europeans, Russians, Chinese, and Iran's \
neighbors.  These outreach efforts were helpful, in that \
Switzerland, as a neutral, disinterested party, could tell \
the Iranians what they would not believe from members of the \
P5 plus 1, namely that no country is happy with what is going \
on in Iran and that Tehran is absolutely isolated on the \
nuclear issue.  Ambuehl stressed that he had been very firm \
with Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani and with Deputy \
Foreign Minister Sa-id Jalili that Iran had to stop the \
rhetoric and provocation and offer concessions to resolve the \
impasse.  Ambuehl said he believes they were listening. \
 \
4.(C) Looking forward, the Ambassador observed that, since \
Switzerland position was now well known, now would be an \
opportune time to rest.  Tehran knew what it needed to do to \
begin negotiations.  Swiss silence would speak louder than \
words.  Certainly, Iranian officials might reach out to the \
Swiss, but it would be helpful if Switzerland itself did not \
pursue more dialogue.  Sanctions were starting to bite and \
international pressure was getting to Iran.  The \
international community needed to allow the  P5-plus-1 track \
to have an effect. \
 \
5.(C) Ambuehl replied that Switzerland fully respected the \
leading role of the P5 plus 1.  Were the United States to \
begin talking directly to Iran, Washington would certainly be \
in the driver's seat.  Indeed, Ambuehl said he would \
recommend that the USG take this step.  Until that time, it \
was his view that there was merit in repeatedly reminding \
Tehran of the international community's unanimous concerns. \
He well understood USG worries about Switzerland being \
"instrumentalized" or used to split the international \
community.  Moreover, Ambuehl said that it was his impression \
-- and that of IAEA head Mohammed Elbaradei -- that \
Switzerland was more firm on the imperative of full \
suspension and locating a nuclear consortium outside of Iran, \
than were some of the European members of the P5 plus 1. \

 \
 \
6.(C) On the subject of transparency, Ambuehl told the \
Ambassador that he viewed the United States as a privileged \
partner.  Following every meeting with Iranian officials, his \
team had briefed the Embassy even before other members of the \
Swiss cabinet.  The Ambassador thanked Ambuehl for his \
consideration, but encouraged him to notify the Embassy prior \
to such meetings, to avoid misunderstandings.  It was awkward \
to have learned about Foreign Minister Calmy-Rey's meeting \
with Larijani from a Swiss press inquiry to the public \
affairs section.  Ambuehl appeared receptive to this proposal. \
 \
7.(C) Ambuehl mentioned that his deputy, Ambassador Tony \
Thalmann, would be leading a delegation to Tehran to engage \
in a long-scheduled human rights dialogue (the planned visit \
had already been briefed to the Embassy).  Ambuehl said that \
Thalmann did not have the intention to meet with nuclear \
officials, but the Iranian government was liable to change \
plans at the last minute. \
 \
8.(C) Finally, Ambuehl said that he looked forward to his \
telephone call with Under Secretary Nick Burns later that day. \

Comment \

 \
9.(C) Ambuehl has a mandate from FM Calmy-Rey to maintain \
dialogue with all of the key parties in the Middle East, \
including Iran.  Our repeated warnings to Ambuehl regarding \
the risks of this outreach can influence how the Swiss go \
about this dialogue, but probably not stop it altogether. \
Urging a "moment of silence" may be the most reasonable \
approach at the moment, particularly in view of the upcoming \
February 21 UN Security Council deadline. \
