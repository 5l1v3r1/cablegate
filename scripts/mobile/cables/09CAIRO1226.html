  		<h1>HIGH COURT GRANTS CUSTODY TO CHRISTIAN MOTHER, BUT RULES CHILDREN ARE MUSLIMS REF: A. CAIRO 1109 B. CAIRO 485 C. CAIRO 477 D. 07 CAIRO 2622 E. 07 CAIRO 1427 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor William R. Stewart for reason 1.4 (d).1.(U) On June 15, the Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest appeals court, granted Kamilia Lotfy custody of her 14 year-old twin sons Andrew and Mario Ramsis, overruling a September 2008 Alexandria Appeals Court decision that gave custody to the boys' father following his conversion from Christianity to Islam. Ms. Lotfy remains Christian. The appeals court had ruled that upon reaching the age of seven a child must be transferred to the custody of a Muslim father. The Court of Cassation ruling affirmed for the first time the right of a non-Muslim mother to retain custody of her child until the age of 15, even when the father converts to Islam. However, the Court of Cassation upheld its precedent in previous cases that when one parent converts to Islam, the state automatically considers his or her children under the age of 15 to be Muslim.</h1>
