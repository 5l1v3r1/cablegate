</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>¶1. (S) Begin Summary and Introduction:  At a December 16 meeting 
requested by Ambassador Diaz, the Vatican's Foreign Minister 
said the Papal Nuncio in Iran has been asked to intercede in the 
case of three Amcits detained there; Mamberti said the Vatican 
would be pleased to be of assistance in that case, on 
humanitarian grounds.  Ambassador Diaz, accompanied by DCM, 
raised with Archbishop Mamberti the latest situation in 
Honduras, proposed Ugandan legislation criminalizing 
homosexuality, and the upcoming vote at the UN General Assembly 
plenary on a defamation of religions resolution.  AB Mamberti 
also raised the U.S. health care debate.  End Summary and 
Introduction 
 
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Iran: Parents Asked Vatican to Intercede for Detained Amcits 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶2. (S) Archbishop Mamberti brought up the case of three American 
citizens detained in Iran.  The Vatican understood that Iranian 
officials had announced they would be tried, but for illegal 
entry, not for espionage.  Mamberti indicated that the parents 
of the three Americans had contacted the Vatican directly to 
seek intervention on behalf of their children.  The Foreign 
Minister said the Papal Nuncio in Iran was in close contact with 
the Swiss Ambassador there, and that the two of them were trying 
to arrange a visit to the Amcits by the Nuncio over the 
Christmas holiday period.  The Nuncio would be pleased to pass 
messages to the Americans.  The Vatican would be willing to 
intercede in this case on humanitarian grounds, Mamberti said. 
 
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Honduras: Lobos is President-Elect; Peaceful Transition Needed 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶3. (C) Ambassador briefed Mamberti on the latest developments 
and asked for Vatican support in Honduras to expedite formation 
of a national unity government, and in Latin America generally 
for recognition of the November 29 elections.  Mamberti replied 
that the Vatican is watching the situation in Honduras very 
closely.  He asked about specific impediments to formation of a 
national unity government and also about the proposed role for 
the truth commission.  The Foreign Minister implied, but did not 
say directly, that the Vatican might deliver behind-the-scenes 
messages in support of these goals.  Insofar as a direct 
statement from the Pope recognizing the elections, Mamberti said 
that was not/not likely at this time.  Nevertheless, Mamberti 
referred to Pepe Lobos as the elected President of Honduras and 
said the international community needed to put itself ""at 
President Lobos' service"" to prevent violence in Honduras. 
 
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Uganda: Church Considers Sexuality a Moral, not Penal, Issue 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Further to ref B, and in light of the continued silence 
of the Ugandan bishops on proposed legislation to criminalize 
(and in extreme cases, impose the death penalty for) 
homosexuality,   Ambassador Diaz asked the Vatican to weigh in 
with the Ugandan Episcopal Conference.  Mamberti replied that 
the Church's view about the sinfulness of homosexuality is 
well-known.  Nevertheless, the Church also teaches that sexual 
relations between consenting adults are a moral, not penal, 
issue.  They should not be brought before the courts.  In 
addition, the Church is opposed to the death penalty as a 
general rule.  Mamberti registered the USG concerns about the 
legislation, but did not commit to contacting the Ugandan 
bishops about it.  He said, however, that he was certain the 
bishops would not remain silent for long on such an important 
moral issue. 
 
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>UNGA Plenary Vote on Defamation Resolution: Vatican Will Lobby 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>¶5. (C) Mamberti was very familiar with the status of this 
resolution at the UNGA, and with the complex legal and human 
rights issues associated with it.  He said he had discussed the 
Vatican's views on the defamation of religion concept with the 
U.S. Commissioners for International Religious Freedom during 
their recent visit, but did not think the commissioners had 
understood the nuances of the Holy See's position.  The Vatican, 
he said, did not support the resolution or related arguments 
posited by Islamic countries.  The Vatican supports full freedom 
of expression on all matters; it also believes individuals 
 
VATICAN 00000133  002 OF 002 
 
 
should exercise that freedom responsibly, in a manner that does 
not incite violence or social unrest.  Rights reside in 
individuals not in groups, Mamberti affirmed.  Ambassador Diaz 
requested that Vatican diplomats lobby Argentina, Colombia, 
Guatemala and Belize to move their Third Committee abstention on 
this issue to a no vote in Plenary, and Honduras and El Salvador 
to move from a yes to an abstention.  Mamberti said he would 
call the Vatican's UN PermRep, Archbishop Migliore, to instruct 
him to do so. 
 
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>U.S. Health Care Debate: No Abortion Funding 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶6. (SBU) Mamberti asked the Ambassador about the status of the 
health care legislation now pending before the U.S. Senate, and 
reiterated the concerns expressed by the U.S. Catholic 
Conference of Bishops that the final version of the legislation 
not contain funding for abortion.
