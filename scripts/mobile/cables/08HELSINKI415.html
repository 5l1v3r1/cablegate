1 (SBU) Political Section Chief met on September 12 with the 
head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Unit for Euopean 
Common Foreign and Security Policy, Leena-Kaisa Mikkola to 
deliver reftels points. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ZIMBABWE:  The EU was considering strengthening the 
sanctions, but given the recent political breakthrough the EU 
will not consider additional or stronger sanctions.  The 
ministers will welcome the recent deal between Mugabe and the 
opposition, and the EU will stand ready to plan its role in 
reconstruction efforts.  Mikkola was usure how the Ministers 
would deal with exisiting sanctions; she doubted the 
ministers would take action to remove them and thought they 
would adopt a "wait and see" approach. 
 
¶3. (C) SOMALIA: Mikkola said there was no action on a "naval 
operation," or at least not yet.  The EU will decide on 
"joint action" regarding a four-member coordination cell in 
the EU Military Secretariat, which will assist in 
coordination of "international efforts" (meaning the EU 
countries acting independently in the region).  Planning is 
underway for an ESDP operation later in the year.  This would 
be an EU operation, but again would involve those Member 
States already in the region. 
 
¶4. (SBU) SERBIA: The Finns are uncertain about the 
Presidency's intentions regarding Serbia.  The new ICTY 
Prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, might participate in the 
meeting, providing a report on Serbia's cooperation with the 
ICTY.  Mikkola said the Member States will not ratify the 
Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia until 
there has been "full cooperation" from Serbia (to include 
turning over Mladic and Hadzic).  However, she noted that 
there "European Community-related agreements" with Serbia 
that address trade issues, and some provisions therein could 
be implemented.  Finland supports implementing those trade 
provisions as a means to encourage the Government of Serbia 
and show the Serbian people that their government's "good 
deeds" are noticed.  Mikkola is not sure that EULEX will be 
discussed.  Regarding Serbia's referral to the ICJ, Mikkola 
says there's "hope for a common position" but that the GoF 
has not arrived at one itself. 
 
¶5. (SBU) TURKEY: Not on the agenda. 
 
¶6. (C) GEORGIA: The Member States are expected to announce 
ESDP contributions prior to the GAERC, and they will reach 
the goal of 200 monitors.  She noted that there was a "tight 
schedule" to deploy the monitors by October 1, but predicted 
that deployment by that date could occur.  Regarding the 
October 15 international conference in Geneva to address 
reconstruction in Georgia, Mikkola said there was some doubt 
about who would be in charge (EU, someone else) and who would 
participate.  They awaited word from the Presidency.  She 
pointed out that the European Council was scheduled to meet 
on the same day, and wondered what that conflict said about 
participation at the conference. 
 
¶7. (SBU) BELARUS: Mikkola said Belarus would be on the 
agenda.  She said there was great interest in the EU about 
the results of the upcoming elections.  The EU has sanctions 
in place - e.g., visa restrictions - and while they welcomed 
the release of some political prisoners in August they do not 
anticipate action to ease or remove sanctions before the 
elections.
