¶1.  (S) By the opening of business in New Delhi, Saturday, January 3, 2009, post will have received additional information about the November 2008 Mumbai attacks.  The Embassy is authorized to provide this information - which originated with the government of Pakistan and is being transferred with its consent - to the government of India through appropriate channels. This information is more significant as an indication of Pakistan's good faith than the actions Home Minister Chidambaram requested in Ref B as a precondition for Indian permission for the United States to share data from its investigations in India with Pakistan. Department principals believe the Pakistani information is significant and reflects a genuine Pakistani effort to pursue justice in the Mumbai attacks.  The Department believes this is an important, time-sensitive opportunity to pass this information to India and to press India to give the United States permission to share data the Federal Bureau of Investigation has gathered in India on the Mumbai attacks with the government of Pakistan. 
 
SATURDAY ACTION REQUEST:  The Department requests Ambassador Mulford deliver the message in paragraph 2 to appropriate Indian officials on January 3, and press 
India for immediate permission for American authorities to share information about the Mumbai attacks with Pakistani authorities. 
 
¶2.  (S/REL INDIA) Talking Points: 
 
- We are providing you with significant additional information about the Mumbai attacks. 
 
- This information originated from top Pakistani officials in very sensitive positions and is passed to you with their permission.  It represents a genuine willingness on their part to share sensitive and significant information with India. 
 
- This information is more valuable than that which Minister Chidambaram requested in our December 31 discussion, and represents Pakistan's good faith in pursuing this case. 
 
- It is crucial that India allow the United States to share with Pakistani authorities data our law enforcement authorities have gathered.  Doing so will further our collective interest in prosecuting those responsible for these attacks. 
 
- We are deeply grateful for the cooperation India has provided American investigators.  To ensure the most comprehensive investigation, however, it is crucial we share this data with Pakistani authorities. 
 
- It is vital that we agree that the fact of this information-sharing will not be leaked.
