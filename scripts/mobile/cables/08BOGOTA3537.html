<br>POSSIBLE THIRD TERM

SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) President Uribe continues to keep all options open on 
a possible third presidential term.  He urged Congress to 
shelve the proposal for a constitutional change to allow a 
third term after it was presented on September 10, but 
congressional leaders said Congress is legally required to 
consider the initiative.  Uribe also intimated he would not 
run for a third term, or might delay a reelection bid until 
2014, if his congressional coalition named a single Uribista 
candidate.  Still, coalition leaders tell us it would be very 
difficult for the fractious Uribe coalition to agree on a 
unified candidate   Third term initiative leader Guillermo 
Giraldo predicted Uribe would run in 2010, and said the first 
congressional votes on the initiative would occur in 
mid-October.  He dismissed the 2014 option, arguing that 
Uribe would face strong resistance from whoever was the 
incumbent.  End summary. 
 
URIBE KEEPING HIS OPTIONS OPEN 
------------------------------ 
¶2. (C)  President Uribe continues to keep all options open as 
the initiative to amend the constitution to allow for a 
possible third Uribe term makes it way through Congress. 
Uribe said on September 10--the day the reelection proposal 
was presented in Congress--that he wanted Congress to put the 
reelection proposal on the back burner so it could focus on 
pending judicial and political reform bills.  He also 
suggested he might defer any reelection ambitions until 2014. 
  Uribe heightened the uncertainty on September 17, saying he 
was inclined not to run for a third term, but only if his 
fractious coalition reached agreement on a single "Uribista" 
presidential candidate. 
 
¶3. (C)  Still, House of Representatives President German 
Varon (Cambio Radical) and third term initiative leader 
Guillermo Giraldo (U Party) told us Uribe's statements were 
tactics to deflect third term critics.  Conservative Party 
leader Efrain Cepeda, Giraldo, and Varon told us it would be 
very hard for the coalition to unite around a single 
candidate given the presidential ambitions of Cambio Radical 
leader German Vargas, Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, 
Ambassador to the United Kingdom Noemi Sanin, and others. 
Cepeda said that if Uribe did not run, the election could be 
contested by five or more Uribista candidates--creating the 
prospect of a victory by a leftist candidate such as former 
Bogota Mayor Lucho Garzon and likely prompting another Uribe 
presidential bid. 
 
¶4. (C) Former Senate President Nancy Gutierrez agreed that 
Uribe's refusal to clarify his third term intentions is 
designed to ensure that numerous coalition candidates move 
forward, making a unified candidate unlikely.   U Party 
Senator Martha Lucia Ramirez, who is planning her own 
candidacy, said despite his oft-stated claims to want a 
unified coalition candidate, Uribe has done nothing to 
promote such a goal.  Journalist Mauricio Vargas, who is 
close to Uribe, told us the president "does not want to be 
close" to any contenders, including Uribista candidates, 
because such distance would facilitate an Uribe third term 
campaign in either 2010 or 2014.  Giraldo contended that 
Uribe could not wait until 2014, since any incumbent--even an 
Uribista--would likely seek his or her own second term. 
 
URIBE AS FDR? 
------------- 
 ¶5.  (C)  Giraldo told us he and Uribe agreed when the 
reelection effort began that they would not discuss Uribe's 
intentions so Giraldo could maintain "plausible deniability." 
 He explained that Uribe is following President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt's 1940 strategy of "sitting back and waiting until 
a last minute clamor from the people" forces him to run. 
Giraldo noted that under the Law of Guarantees (Ley de 
Garantias), Uribe could delay any presidential announcement 
until November 2009, six months before the May 2010 
presidential elections.  Still, most observers think Uribe 
would have to actively campaign to generate the 25% turnout 
of registered voters (approximately 7 million) required to 
 
make the constitutional referendum valid.  Several Casa de 
Narino insiders tell us Uribe will need to declare his 
intentions even earlier to ensure congressional passage of 
the initiative before the end of the year. 
 
FIRST CONGRESSIONAL VOTES COULD OCCUR IN MID-OCTOBER 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶6. (U)  The third term proposal language being considered by 
Congress has also raised doubts about Uribe's intentions, 
with some legislators arguing that the current language would 
preclude a 2010 Uribe candidacy.  Giraldo acknowledged the 
issue, but told us Congress could modify the language to 
remove any uncertainty.  He said that despite Uribe's request 
that Congress drop the referendum issue, Congress is legally 
required to consider the measure as the first order of a 
business, since it is the result of a popular initiative.  He 
expects the first two of the required four congressional 
votes to happen in mid-October.
