¶1.  (S/NF)  A NUMBER OF POLICYMAKERS ARE INTERESTED IN 
KNOWING THE STATUS OF THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CUBA AND RUSSIA, GIVEN THE ANIMOSITY BOTH GOVERNMENTS SHARE TOWARD THE UNITED STATES AND IN LIGHT OF THE NUMEROUS PRESS REPORTS  SUGGESTING A CLOSER BILATERAL PARTNERSHIP.  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS HAVE WRITTEN SEVERAL PIECES ON THIS TOPIC IN THE  PAST; HOWEVER, ANALYSTS ARE LOOKING TO WRITE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT ANALYZING THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP.  ANALYSTS WOULD READ WITH INTEREST ANY 
INFORMATION POST COULD PROVIDE ON THE TOPICS BELOW, AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT.  MANY THANKS, AND REGARDS FROM WASHINGTON. 
 
¶A.  (S/NF)  FOR HAVANA: ARE THERE CUBAN OFFICIALS WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF IMPROVING HAVANA'S TIES TO RUSSIA?  IF SO, WHY? 
 
¶B.  (S/NF)  FOR HAVANA: IS HAVANA LOOKING TO USE RUSSIAN 
ASSISTANCE TO HELP FUND DOMESTIC PROGRAMS/PRIORITIES, SUCH AS HOUSING OR TRANSPORTATION?  IF SO, WHICH ONES AND HOW? 
 
¶C.  (S/NF)  FOR MOSCOW: DO RUSSIAN OFFICIALS VIEW RAUL CASTRO AS EASIER OR HARDER TO WORK WITH COMPARED TO FIDEL WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT?  WHY? 
 
¶D.  (S/NF)  FOR MOSCOW: WHICH BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP DOES RUSSIA VIEW AS A HIGHER PRIORITY?  CUBA OR VENEZUELA?  WHY? 
 
¶E.  (S/NF)  FOR HAVANA AND MOSCOW: HAVE CUBAN DIPLOMATS OR OTHER CUBAN OFFICIALS EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION IN WORKING WITH THEIR RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS?  IF SO, WHY?  CONVERSELY, HAVE RUSSIANS EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION? 
 
¶F.  (S/NF)  FOR HAVANA AND MOSCOW: HOW FAR ARE THE CUBANS WILLING TO GO TO ACCOMMODATE OR SUPPORT RUSSIAN MILITARY OPERATIONS, INCLUDING LONG RANGE AVIATION ACTIVITIES?  WHAT, IF ANYTHING, ARE THE RUSSIANS ASKING THE CUBANS FOR IN TERMS OF SUPPORT? WHAT WOULD THE CUBANS RECEIVE IN RETURN? 
 
¶2.  (U)  PLEASE CITE C-AL9-00784 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
