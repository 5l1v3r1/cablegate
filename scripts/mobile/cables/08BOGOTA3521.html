SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) Foreign Minister Bermudez announced that he would meet 
with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Maduro in mid-October to 
discuss trade and a full range of bilateral issues.  Vice FM 
Reyes told us the GOC wants to use the meeting to "normalize" 
relations through existing bi-national forums to address 
security, commercial, immigration, and border demarcation 
issues.  The GOC will remain patient with Ecuador and does 
not expect any improvement in relations with the GOE until 
after the September 28 referendum.  Reyes said Brazilian 
influence was on the rise due to de-institutionalization 
underway in some Latin countries.  Separately, President 
Uribe told the Ambassador that at the UNASUR conference on 
Bolivia in Chile, Argentine President Fernandez was a 
"stalking horse" for Chavez;  Brazilian President Lula was 
moderate and helpful; and Chavez pitched for language 
permitting military intervention until Lula talked him down. 
End summary. 
 
COLOMBIAN-VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTERS TO MEET 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶2. (U) Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez said on September 16, 
that he will meet with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas 
Maduro in Caracas, likely on October 16 or 17.  Bermudez, 
speaking from Santiago, Chile on the fringes of the Union of 
South American Nations (UNASUR) conference on Bolivia, said 
the meeting would focus on a full range of issues.  The 
foreign minister added that commerce ministers would also 
participate. 
 
¶3. (C) Vice Foreign Minister Camilo Reyes told us separately 
that the GOC wants to "normalize" bilateral ties as much as 
possible given political and personal tensions between 
Presidents Alvaro Uribe and Hugo Chavez.  The Bermudez-Maduro 
meeting would serve to follow up on pending issues from the 
July Uribe-Chavez meeting in Venezuela.  The GOC's goal is to 
revive the various bi-national forums created to handle 
commercial, immigration, infrastructure, security, and water 
issues.  These include COPIAF (border issues, integration, 
immigration, security, trade); CONEG (delimitation of borders 
in the gulf, river basin issues, and other boundary issues), 
and COBAN (a forum that covers infrastructure and energy). 
Chavez created the latter, Reyes noted, because the other 
bodies had been set up by Chavez' enemy, former-President 
Carlos Andres Perez. 
 
GOC PATIENT WITH ECUADOR 
------------------------ 
¶4. (C)  Reyes said the GOC would remain patient in its 
approach to Ecuador, believing there can be no lasting 
improvement in bilateral relations until after the September 
28 constitutional referendum in Ecuador.   Reyes told us the 
key was to avoid a further deterioration in relations, noting 
that while FM Bermudez met with his Ecuadorian counterpart at 
President Lugo's inauguration in Asuncion, President Rafael 
Correa renewed his verbal attack on Colombia.  Correa has 
consistently used Colombia as a "political football" to 
advance his interests, even prior to his initial election, 
and the GOC expects this to continue.  Reyes confided that 
OAS SYG Jose Miguel Insulza shared this view, and decided to 
hold off on further OAS efforts to promote better ties until 
after the 28th. 
 
¶5. (C) Colombian Representative Guillermo Rivera, a member of 
the Carter Center group trying to improve Colombia-Ecuador 
relations, told us the group was set to meet with President 
Correa again in Quito in late October.  Rivera said group 
members and Carter Center officials were surprised Correa had 
accepted the meeting.  Correa stormed out of the last meeting 
on June 25, saying he would only meet with the group again 
"to talk about football, not restoring relations with 
Colombia."   Rivera said several members of the group, 
including prominent leftist politicians Antionio Navarro 
Wolff (Narino governor) and Angelino Garzon (former Valle de 
 
 
Cauca governor) were "puzzled" by Correa's behavior--and 
would brush up on football prior to the meeting. 
 
GOC: BRAZILIAN INFLUENCE ON THE RISE 
------------------------------------ 
¶6. (C)  Vice FM Reyes said the current process of 
de-institutionalization underway in some Latin countries has 
increased Brazil's importance and influence.  Brazil 
possesses an "institutional solidity" that distinguishes it 
from many of its neighbors and allows for continuity of 
policy.  Reyes said Brazil's UNASUR initiative would likely 
provide a useful forum where Colombia can interact with its 
more unstable neighbors (Venezuela and Ecuador) within a 
controlled environment.  Reyes said the GOC would participate 
in talks on the South American Defense Council, but he said 
progress would be slow due to limits imposed by sovereignty 
and domestic legislation.  He doubts the Council will ever be 
more than a talk shop--which would suit the GOC just fine. 
 
URIBE ON UNASUR BOLIVIA CONFERENCE 
---------------------------------- 
¶7. (C) President Uribe told the Ambassador on September 16, 
that at the UNASUR meeting in Santiago on Bolivia, Argentine 
President Fernandez de Kirchner represented a bad influence 
and was a "stalking horse" for Chavez.  He said Brazilian 
President Luis Inacio Lula was moderate and helpful in 
producing a decent outcome.  Finally, Uribe told the 
Ambassador that Chavez had actually pitched for language 
permitting military intervention until Lula managed to talk 
him down.
