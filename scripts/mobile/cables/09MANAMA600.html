Â¶1. (SBU) Summary: Bahraini official Mohammed Al Mutawa appears to be the consensus candidate among Gulf Cooperation Council governments to be the next GCC Secretary General. He will be the first Bahraini to head the organization. End summary.
</p><p>2.(SBU) Bahraini Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman visited Kuwait in early October to lobby for Kuwaiti support for Bahraini official Mohammed Al Mutawa as the next GCC Secretary General. Gulf media reported October 7 that the Kuwaiti ruler confirmed that support in a letter to Bahrain's King Hamad. Kuwait had been next in line to provide a SecGen, but has reportedly withdrawn its candidate, much as Bahrain stood aside in 2002 to clear the way for the election of the current Secretary General, Qatari Abdul Rahman Al Attiyah. Al Attiyah's term is due to end in March, 2011. MFA contacts tell us that other GCC governments have joined a consensus behind Al Mutawa. He would be the first Bahraini to hold the job. -------- Bio data --------
</p><p>3.(C) The 62-year old Al Mutawa is close to the Prime Minister. He was born in Bahrain, from a Huwala family (one that traces its origins to Sunni Arabs who once lived on the Iranian side of the Gulf.) Since 2005, Al Mutawa's title has been Cultural Advisor to the PM, but he acts as the PM's de facto appointments broker; many here say that no senior assignment in the government is possible without Al Mutawa's support. He holds degrees in philosophy, psychology, and social sciences from the University of Alexandria and speaks fluent English. In 1972, Al Mutawa was appointed head of youth activities at the then-Labor and Social Affairs Ministry. Two years later, he moved to the Prime Minister's Office, and in 1977 became Executive Director of the Prime Minister's Office. Al Mutawa remained there until 1993 when he was appointed Minister of Cabinet Affairs, serving in that capacity until 2005. From 1995-2001, he was dual-hatted as Minister of Information. HENZEL</p>
