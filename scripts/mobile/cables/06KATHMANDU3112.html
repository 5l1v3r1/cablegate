Summary and Introduction 
------------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) During a November 26 meeting with the Ambassador, 
Finance Minister Mahat gave his views on what the United 
Nations was doing and should be doing soon to assist the 
peace process.  He expressed appreciation for Secretary 
General Annan's November 22 letter to the UN Security Council 
President which the UNSC President had conveyed to Council 
Members on November 24.  Mahat described as very positive 
Annan's stated intent to proceed with: (1) deployment of a 
technical assessment mission to determine how to best to 
assist up to the election of a constituent assembly; (2) 
simultaneous deployment of up to 35 arms management monitors; 
and (3) deployment of up to 25 electoral personnel.   The 
Ambassador agreed.  Mahat asked that the U.S. use its 
influence to get the UN Security Council to take up the 
issue.  In response to a question from the Minister, the 
Ambassador indicated the U.S. would also look at what 
additional assistance the U.S. could provide in the lead up 
to the elections.  Other matters discussed with Mahat are 
reported septel. 
 
Finance Minister Welcomes UN Secretary General's Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶2. (C) In a meeting with the Ambassador on November 26, 
Finance Minister Ram Saran Mahat expressed his gratitude for 
Secretary General Kofi Annan's November 22 letter to UN 
 
SIPDIS 
Security Council President Jorge Voto Bernales.  Mahat 
characterized Annan's three-page letter, which Bernales 
transmitted to Security Council Members on November 24, as 
extremely positive.  In it, Annan stated he intended to take 
three new steps to support Nepal's peace process.  First, he 
planned to deploy a technical assessment mission to determine 
the scope, requirements and concept for a UN political 
mission that could provide the assistance required to secure 
a peaceful transition to a constituent assembly election. 
Second, he planned to deploy up to 35 monitors to serve as 
the vanguard for the proposed monitoring of arms and armed 
personnel.  Third, he planned to deploy up to 25 electoral 
personnel to begin to provide the required technical advice 
to the Nepali electoral authorities and the parties, 
including the Maoists. 
 
A Good Start For a Stronger UN Mandate 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Mahat stated that Annan's letter provided a good start 
to strengthening the existing UN peace mission in Nepal.  The 
Government of Nepal (GON), the Minister said, had wanted the 
Secretary General's personal representative to the peace 
 
SIPDIS 
process, Ian Martin to have a stronger mandate and more 
resources.  That was why Foreign Minister Oli had written to 
the Secretary General on November 16 and requested the UN's 
assistance "as quickly as possible."  The GON's request 
pertained not only to the five areas set forth in the 
identical August 2006 letters from Prime Minister Koirala and 
Maoist Supremo Prachanda to Annan, the original basis for the 
UN Mission, but also to specific provisions of the November 8 
Agreement.  The Ambassador agreed that the letter was very 
positive.   He added that Ian Martin was expected to arrive 
in New York on November 27 and would presumably be involved 
in pushing for a possible Presidential Statement and, at a 
later date, a UN Security Council Resolution. 
 
UN Security Council Action Desired 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) The Finance Minister said that the UN Security Council 
could give the UN peace mission an even stronger mandate.  He 
asked that the U.S. use its influence in this regard.  A 
stronger mandate would embolden Martin and his team to take a 
more pro-active role in addressing the Government's concerns 
about the draft tripartite technical agreement that the UN 
was negotiating with the Government and the Maoists (septel). 
 Even the Indians wanted to see the UN more involved. 
Demobilization and disarmament of combatants was very 
technical and only the UN had the expertise to do it 
successfully.  If the UN were not actively involved in those 
two steps, Mahat remarked, the basic purpose of UN 
involvement would be lost. 
 
Additional U.S. Assistance Requested 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (C) Minister Mahat asked if the United States would be 
able to provide additional assistance with the transition 
leading up to elections scheduled for June 2007.  He asked 
specifically about assistance to internally displaced persons 
(IDPs), the elections and police.  The Finance Minister 
stated that the Government was looking for cash support for 
IDPs, and that priority would be given to those who had been 
displaced because Maoists had killed or handicapped their 
family members or had confiscated their property or burned 
their homes.  For the police, the Nepali Government wanted 
vehicles, communications equipment, assistance for 
infrastructure reconstruction and training.  The Ambassador 
indicated that IDPs were important and that he would look 
into what the U.S. could do.  Mahat noted that the Indians 
were providing some communication equipment and vehicles to 
the police as well as training.  The Ambassador stressed 
police training was important and was an area where the U.S. 
could probably be helpful. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (C) The Secretary General's November 22 letter to the 
Security Council President is excellent news indeed.  If we 
understand the letter correctly, Annan is proposing 
simultaneously to deploy a technical assessment mission and a 
vanguard of up to 35 arms monitors as well as up to 25 
election monitors to Nepal.  What appears to be needed now is 
the Security Council's imprimatur.  Kari Karanko, the Finnish 
Charge d'Affaires, told the Ambassador November 24 that 
Finland had 15 personnel assigned to the peacekeeping mission 
in Sri Lanka who could be deployed immediately to Nepal even 
without UNSC action.  He said that Norway has five monitors 
ready to go.  There may be additional countries that can help 
bridge the gap on a bilateral basis.  However, the sooner the 
Security Council acts, the more likely it becomes that Nepal 
will get the assistance it needs.
