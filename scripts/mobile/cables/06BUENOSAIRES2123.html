</p><p>and Kunkel expressing confidence that Ambassador Wayne would 
</p><p>be a good Ambassador.  END SUMMARY. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (SBU) On September 11, Charge and Poloffs (notetakers) 
</p><p>met with Congressman and longtime Kirchner associate Carlos 
</p><p>Kunkel that included a wide-ranging discussion on bilateral 
</p><p>relations, Venezuela and Argentine politics.  Carlos Kunkel 
</p><p>has a close relationship with President Nestor Kirchner that 
</p><p>stretches back more than 30 years.  Kunkel notes that he was 
</p><p>Kirchner's first employer when Kirchner entered law school in 
</p><p>La Plata in the early 1970s where Kunkel was an 
</p><p>upperclassman.  Kunkel is associated with the more radical 
</p><p>left-wing side of the Kirchner movement and was responsible 
</p><p>for managing First Lady Cristina Kirchner's Senate campaign 
</p><p>in Buenos Aires province during last October's elections. 
</p><p>Kunkel began the discussion by welcoming the Charge back to 
</p><p>Argentina and highlighting the importance of a good dialogue 
</p><p>between the two governments, despite any differences that 
</p><p>might exist.  Charge replied that the USG was very pleased 
</p><p>with the fluid dialogue that existed with the GOA. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (SBU)  Kunkel noted that the GOA has many points of 
</p><p>cooperation with the USG and Kunkel said that Argentina 
</p><p>appreciates the help the U.S. provided the country during 
</p><p>Argentina's economic crisis.  Kunkel said that the GOA has 
</p><p>great respect for the U.S. and that ""you will not see 
</p><p>officially-backed demonstrations in the street directed 
</p><p>against the U.S.""  Kunkel said that he and his colleagues do 
</p><p>not want to publicly comment on the bilateral relationship 
</p><p>and prefer to leave those matters to the professionals in the 
</p><p>Foreign Ministry.  Kunkel also noted that the U.S. naturally 
</p><p>has a much larger role in the world than Argentina and that 
</p><p>Argentina does not want to meddle in any other country's 
</p><p>domestic affairs. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4.  (SBU) Turning to Venezuela, Kunkel emphasized the 
</p><p>economic nature of the GOA's relationship with the Chavez 
</p><p>government.  ""If someone offers us a better price for our 
</p><p>bonds, we will go with them, much the same as I imagine you 
</p><p>would stop buying Venezuelan oil and go with another supplier 
</p><p>if you could get a better price.""  Kunkel downplayed the 
</p><p>ideological nature of the GOA-GOV relationship, saying that 
</p><p>the Venezuelan style of democracy and politics is very 
</p><p>different from that of Argentina.  Kunkel said that in 
</p><p>particular, the use of political violence would never be 
</p><p>accepted in Argentina.  ""We do not base our relations on 
</p><p>ideology.  For example, we were among the first to support 
</p><p>Uruguay's Tabare Vazquez when he was running for President, 
</p><p>but when the controversy arose regarding the paper mills, we 
</p><p>defended the rights of the affected residents against the 
</p><p>Uruguayan government."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5.  (SBU) Moving to domestic politics, Kunkel lamented the 
</p><p>lack of a viable opposition in Argentina.  ""It would be 
</p><p>better if the 20-25 percent of the population that does not 
</p><p>agree with us had leaders that actually represented them."" 
</p><p>Kunkel said that opposition leaders like former President 
</p><p>Raul Alfonsin and Republican Proposal (PRO) leader Ricardo 
</p><p>Lopez Murphy lack public support.  ""In the last elections, 
</p><p>Lopez Murphy came in fifth place in Buenos Aires province, 
</p><p> 
</p><p>BUENOS AIR 00002123  002 OF 002 
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>and yet he complains that President Kirchner does not consult 
</p><p>with him.  Would Bush consult with someone who came in fifth 
</p><p>in some U.S. state before he made a decision?""  Kunkel also 
</p><p>said that Alfonsin has no right to accuse Kirchner of 
</p><p>destroying the opposition Radical Civic Union (UCR). 
</p><p>""Alfonsin has run the UCR for 30 years.  Under Alfonsin's 
</p><p>leadership, the party went from winning 52 percent of the 
</p><p>vote in 1983 to 2 percent of the vote in 2003, all before 
</p><p>Kirchner came to office."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6.  (SBU) Kunkel defended the GOA's management of public 
</p><p>works contracts, arguing that the funds are equitably 
</p><p>distributed.  ""I was in Alfonsin's hometown of Chascomus the 
</p><p>other day helping to inaugurate a large new public housing 
</p><p>project.  The UCR mayor, who is not aligned with us, was 
</p><p>taking credit for the whole project.  In fact, all of the 
</p><p>funds came from the national government."" 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶7.  (SBU) Turning to the subject of the arrival of Ambassador 
</p><p>Wayne, Charge provided a copy of Ambassador Wayne's 
</p><p>congressional testimony to Kunkel.  (Note: Carlos Kunkel was 
</p><p>one of the main Kirchner allies who reacted negatively to 
</p><p>reports of Ambassador Wayne's testimony during his 
</p><p>congressional confirmation hearings, and Kunkel publicly 
</p><p>accused Ambassador Wayne of defending former President Carlos 
</p><p>Menem's policies, based on inaccurate local press reports of 
</p><p>Wayne's testimony.  End Note.)  Kunkel said that he had no 
</p><p>doubt that Ambassador Wayne would be a good Ambassador, and 
</p><p>he looked forward to continued good relations with the U.S. 
</p><p>Embassy. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶8.  (C) COMMENT: The meeting with Carlos Kunkel followed a 
</p><p>familiar script used by all of Kirchner's officials -- speak 
</p><p>nicely to U.S. diplomats in private while criticizing the 
</p><p>U.S. or U.S. policy in public.  In Kunkel's case, it is even 
</p><p>more difficult to believe.  Kunkel, an ex-Montonero, has been 
</p><p>a prominent participant or organizer in nearly every leftist 
</p><p>demonstration that has enjoyed tacit Casa Rosada support 
</p><p>during the last three years, from the Counter-Summit at Mar 
</p><p>del Plata last November, to the piquetero march against Juan 
</p><p>Carlos Blumberg two weeks ago.  As Kunkel indicated, however, 
</p><p>it is better to have a fluid dialogue, despite the 
</p><p>disagreements, than to have disagreements with poor 
</p><p>communication.  We will continue to engage Carlos Kunkel from 
</p><p>time to time to ensure that his disagreements with the U.S. 
</p><p>are voiced privately, and not to the Argentine press.  END 
</p><p>COMMENT.
