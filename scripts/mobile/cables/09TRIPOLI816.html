<br>
<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>1.(C) Following an October 8 meeting between Foreign Minister-equivalent Musa Kusa and visiting USESS Gration (septel), DCM expressed the United States' strong disappointment with Libya's action on the Goldstone report at the UN Security Council. Clearly surprised by the demarche, Kusa responded that Israeli-Palestinian issues were matters for international fora and that Libya was simply "opening the door" for international debate. Defending Libya's right to raise the issue in the Security Council, Kusa said that Libya "will not have views imposed on us by the U.S." Although Libya was keen to foster its relationship with the U.S., "you have your views and we have ours. This should not be a source of conflict between us."
</p><p>Â¶2. (C) DCM responded that the U.S. was not opposed to discussion of the Goldstone report and, in fact, had worked out an arrangement for the report to be discussed in the UN Human Rights Council. Libya's actions had disrupted a carefully coordinated approach. She stressed that the U.S. was particularly disappointed by Libya's lack of consultations prior to raising the issue in the Security Council. CRETZ</p>
