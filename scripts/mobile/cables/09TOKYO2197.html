¶1.  (S)  SUMMARY:  Assistant Secretary of State (A/S) for 
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell met with 
Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Director General 
(DG) of the Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau Akitaka Saiki 
at the latter's Tokyo office on September 18.  DG Saiki 
praised MOFA's new leader, Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada, 
but warned that the new administration's threat to tame the 
Japanese bureaucracy would end in failure.  A/S Campbell and 
DG Saiki discussed former President Bill Clinton's mission to 
Pyongyang to free two U.S. journalists, the current situation 
regarding the Six Party Talks, the unresolved issue of North 
Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens, and the humanitarian 
situation in North Korea.  Saiki said he was disappointed in 
regional architecture initiatives such as ASEAN and did not 
understand why China decided not to participate in a 
U.S.-Japan-PRC trilateral, but was optimistic about an 
upcoming trilateral summit involving Japan, South Korea, and 
China.  Saiki concluded by speaking about U.S.-Japan and 
U.S.-ROK relations under the new Democratic Party of Japan 
(DPJ)-led government.  END SUMMARY.

The New Administration and the Bureaucracy

¶2.  (C)  Speaking about the new DPJ government, DG Saiki said 
he was glad to have Katsuya Okada heading the Foreign 
Ministry, as he is ""very intellectual"" and ""understands the 
issues.""  Saiki explained that Okada did not pose any 
problems in his areas of responsibility--North Korea, South 
Korea, and China.  Although some bureaucrats were worried 
about the DPJ government's threat to diminish their power, 
Saiki warned that if the DPJ tried to crush the pride of 
professional bureaucrats, it would not succeed.

Six Party Talks

¶3.  (S)  Saiki expressed his appreciation for USG cooperation 
and close consultation related to North Korean issues.  The 
DG mentioned that he had confirmed with Foreign Minister 
Okada that UN sanctions on the DPRK should be maintained. 
Saiki spoke about China's nervousness about the North's 
recent behavior, its desire to avoid seeing instability or 
collapse in the neighboring country, and its continuing 
preference to see a divided Korean peninsula that provided a 
geopolitical buffer.  He then talked about the DPRK's dislike 
for the Six Party Talks (so much as to insist on avoiding the 
word ""six"" and instead calling it ""multilateral"" talks) and 
concluded that whether or not the North Koreans return to the 
table would depend on U.S.-DPRK bilateral talks.  Saiki 
relayed that when he asked the North whether they preferred 
to have one of the six parties removed from the framework, 
the answer was no.  A cosmetic change such as the addition of 
Mongolia, which had expressed an interest in joining the Six 
Party process, may be a possible way out of the current 
stalemate, Saiki conjectured.

Abductions Issue

¶4.  (S)  Saiki lamented that the DPRK believes that 2002 was 
""a mistake""--referring to when North Korea admitted that it 
had abducted Japanese citizens.  The DG xxxxxxxxxxxx 
explained that the fate of Megumi Yokota was the biggest 
issue, since she was still relatively young (in her forties) 
and the public was most sympathetic to her case.  xxxxxxxxxxxx  Saiki was 
 
TOKYO 00002197  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
concerned that the new minister in charge of abductions, 
Hiroshi Nakai, was a hardliner.  Saiki concluded by saying 
the Japanese needed to sit down with the North Koreans to 
decide how to make progress on the abductions issue, and that 
the new Japanese government would be just as attentive as the 
Liberal Democratic Party was to the problem.

¶5.  (C)  With a harvest coming up in one month, the North 
faced a fertilizer problem and a drastic decrease in food 
production, said Saiki.  As a result, the black market was 
very active.  In this context and because of the effects of 
UN Resolution 1874, DPRK leaders were only concerned with 
themselves, according to Saiki.

Regional Architecture 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6.  (S)  Saiki confessed that he was ""very disappointed"" with 
initiatives such as ASEAN and ARF, where leaders tend to talk 
about the same topics using the same talking points.  Despite 
the frustration stemming from the need to form a consensus on 
all decisions between ten countries with ""unequal economies,"" 
Saiki stated that ""we must continue"" and cannot allow China 
to dominate in Southeast Asia.  At the same time, Saiki 
admitted that ASEAN countries were calculating in their own 
ways, and often played Japan and China against each other. 
Saiki said that Indonesia was Japan's most reliable partner 
in ASEAN. 
 
¶7.  (C)  He spoke more optimistically about the trilateral 
summit planned for October 10 between Japan, China, and South 
Korea.  Saiki said that Japan wanted China to be more 
responsible and transparent and hoped the upcoming trilateral 
would help nudge it in that direction. 
 
¶8.  (C)  On the possible trilateral dialogue between the 
U.S., Japan, and China, Saiki wondered why the Chinese had 
changed their minds and cancelled their participation at the 
last minute.  Campbell replied that despite the USG's best 
efforts to confirm Chinese participation, we received no 
reply from China.

U.S.-Japan Relations Under the DPJ Government 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶9.  (S)  Regarding DPJ leaders' call for an ""equal 
relationship"" with the U.S., Saiki confessed that he did not 
know what was on the minds of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama 
and FM Okada, as the bilateral relationship was already 
equal.  Saiki theorized that the DPJ, as an inexperienced 
ruling party, felt the need to project an image of power and 
confidence by showing it had Japan's powerful bureaucrats 
under control and was in charge of a new and bold foreign 
policy that challenged the U.S.  Saiki called this way of 
thinking ""stupid"" and said ""they will learn.""

Japan-ROK Relations 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶10.  (C)  Saiki said the Lee Myung-bak government in South 
Korea was good for Japan because it was forward-looking.  He 
pointed out that 2010 was a critical year for the two nations 
because it marked the centennial anniversary of the Japanese 
annexation of Korea.  Saiki stated that historical issues 
such as Takeshima-Dokdo may cause tension between Japan and 
the ROK in the near future, with guidelines for teachers 
regarding high school textbooks scheduled to be revised, and 
 
TOKYO 00002197  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
recommended that the U.S. not get involved.  On the other 
hand, ROK President Lee Myung-bak's strong desire to have 
Hatoyama visit Seoul on or around the date of the trilateral 
summit between Japan, South Korea, and China, may strengthen 
bilateral relations between the neighboring countries.  Saiki 
continued that the Foreign Minister supported such a visit, 
but there was no reply as of yet from the Prime Minister's 
Office.
