  		<h1>EGYPTIAN MFA REACTIONS TO 2009 TIP REPORT REF: A. 08 CAIRO 2525 B. 09 CAIRO 386 C. 09 CAIRO 721 Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs William R. Stewart for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.(C) Key Points: -- The Government of Egypt is "frustrated" with its ranking in the 2009 TIP Report because officials felt Egypt had done enough to be moved off the Tier 2 Watch List. Some officials wanted to stop cooperating with the USG on TIP, but agreed to revisit the issue at a later date to give some time for feelings to subside. -- The efforts of First Lady Suzanne Mubarak in combating TIP demonstrate there is "political will" to address the issue. Egypt will continue to work on TIP issues based on its commitment to the U.N Protocol. -- The Egyptian National Coordinating Committee to Combat and Prevent Trafficking in Persons finished drafting a comprehensive trafficking law, commissioned a study on the nature and scope of trafficking in Egypt, and is devising a national action plan to implement anti-trafficking measures. -- The GOE is committed to addressing all trafficking issues, but stresses that change will take time because getting local law enforcement to think about victim protection requires a mindset change. Egypt sent law enforcement officials to training programs in the U.S. and Europe, as well as domestically, to help facilitate this change.</h1>
