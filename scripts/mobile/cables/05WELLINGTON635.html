¶1.  (C) Summary:  During his final meeting with Foreign 
Minister Goff on August 18, Ambassador Swindells reiterated 
his call for both countries to engage in a comprehensive 
dialogue on the bilateral relationship.  He and Goff agreed 
that Embassy Wellington should begin quiet work with NZ 
counterparts as soon as appropriate to explore a possible 
framework for talks.  Goff warned that the United States 
should not have "unrealistic expectations" of a broad 
dialogue, but unlike in the past he stopped short of telling 
the Ambassador that the nuclear ban could not be discussed. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) The Ambassador's exchange with Minister Goff was 
cordial, with the Minister especially emphasizing the 
tremendous contributions the Ambassador had made to the 
Fulbright Program.  The two also discussed a variety of 
regional concerns, particularly China.  Minister Goff said 
that Free Trade Agreement (FTA) talks with China were moving 
ahead, with four rounds completed so far.  But Goff 
characterized the PRC as looking for a quick result and GNZ 
more interested in quality.  The fact that NZ was "first up" 
in FTA talks put more pressure on both sides, he added.  The 
Ambassador said that on the economic side he was optimistic 
about China, as laws are more transparent and foreign 
companies are making profits there at last.  Goff agreed, but 
noted that maintaining a dialogue with China was difficult, 
given human rights concerns.  He said it was ironic that the 
PRC was so critical of Japanese textbook accounts of WWII, 
given China's own penchant for censorship. 
 
¶3.  (C) Moving the conversation to the bilateral 
relationship, FM Goff said he wanted to be sure Ambassador 
had seen the Prime Minister's VJ Day speech.  She had talked 
about how strongly she felt about U.S. friendship and 
cooperation in the War, Goff said, and it was she herself who 
included this reference.  (FYI: The PM's speech noted, "New 
Zealand warmly respects, still, the strengths of the United 
States, that mighty country beside which we fought and with 
which, sixty years ago, we celebrated victory.")  Goff said 
he thought his own recent speech to the "Gateway to America" 
had also gone well, as it had highlighted many positive 
statistics about the US-NZ bilateral relationship. 
 
¶4.  (C) Regarding the Pacific Security Initiative (PSI), Goff 
told the Ambassador that he thought NZ Academic Peter Cozens 
remarks to the press were "overgilding" the significance of 
the U.S. decision to allow joint military exercises.  That 
being said, it was Secretary Powell who had asked Goff that 
New Zealand participate in the initiative, and the Prime 
Minister had agreed.  New Zealand had never thought this 
would create a problem for the United States, but GNZ is not 
trying to sell the joint exercises as a breakthrough. 
(Comment: While initially this was the case (and the 
Government was doubtless not eager to be seen as very close 
to the United States military in the run-up to elections) 
Goff has since told the press he hoped the U.S. would issue 
more waivers in the future since the two countries are 
fighting together in Afghanistan against terrorism.  End 
Comment.) 
 
¶5.  (C) Goff also reminded the Ambassador of New Zealand's 
continued interest in a Free Trade Agreement with the United 
States before Trade Promotion Authority runs out.  He said 
hoped the two sides could discuss this later in the year. 
The Ambassador said that in his July 4 speech he had called 
for a broad dialogue about the relationship.  It should be 
about setting up a framework to discuss a myriad of topics, 
he said.  If both sides find things that can't be changed, he 
said, we can move on from there.  The Ambassador said he did 
not like how things were not moving forward.  Given FM Goff's 
and PM Clark's skills it's remarkable these talks are not 
taking place. 
 
¶6.  (C) Goff agreed that he was keen for an open and 
transparent dialogue, but worried that it would create 
expectations on the U.S. side that New Zealand could not 
deliver on.  That's what had happened with the Buchanan and 
the Somers report, he said.  In frankness, New Zealanders' 
view the "non-nuclear" policy as representative of the 
country's being "clean and green" and as the country's own 
decision.  The harder they are pushed on the issue, the more 
resistant they would be.  The Ambassador countered that the 
Government should not worry about this.  If as a result of a 
dialogue New Zealand understands the policy's ramifications 
for the United States, GNZ might be able to find a way to 
address these concerns.  The Ambassador said that he and 
other US officials understand New Zealand's independence. 
But government-to-government talks freshen relationships so 
that they move forward.  If nothing changes, we can still 
continue to cooperate as we have.  Goff said he would be 
happy to discuss the matter with Secretary Rice.  The 
Ambassador said a lower-level discussion was needed to set up 
the parameters of a possible dialogue and then raise it up to 
more senior levels when and as appropriate.  He suggested 
that NZ officials discuss this with DCM Burnett and others at 
Embassy Wellington.  Goff agreed, and said that he would be 
happy to meet with the DCM. 
 
¶7.  (C) The Ambassador and FM Goff met with a group of 
journalists immediately following the meeting.  The 
Ambassador deflected the journalists' repeated questions 
about his views on Labour's use of anti-American messages in 
the campaign, noting that in an election emotions run high. 
The journalists aggressively asked FM Goff whether Labour's 
tactics would tarnish US-NZ relations.  The attacks are aimed 
at National Party leader Brash, Goff said, and not President 
Bush.  The Ambassador said that he hoped for a broad dialogue 
with New Zealand, regardless of which Party is elected.  Goff 
said that GNZ was keen on having a transparent dialogue on 
all issues that would not "move towards adopting a policy 
that New Zealanders are not in favor of."  He also said that 
he believed New Zealanders "are generally in favor of a very 
close and productive relationship with the United States.  Of 
course we want to build on that." 
 
¶8.  (C) Comment:  While we would not expect the Government to 
scrap NZ's nuclear ban any time soon, Goff clearly eschewed 
any direct reference to NZ's nuclear legislation (as opposed 
to policy) in his comments to the press.  Coupled with Goff's 
more open approach to the Ambassador's suggestion during 
their meeting, it seems that Labour is trying to carve out 
wiggle room to discuss with us after elections the impact of 
the nuclear policy on U.S. interests in the region. The 
Ambassador's public call for talks with the Government 
regardless of who wins September's elections will also enable 
us to deflect accusations of having a cabal with National 
should the opposition win. End Comment.
