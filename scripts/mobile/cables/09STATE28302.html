BACKGROUND 
----------- 
</p><p>¶1. (S//NF) Venezuelan officials expected to receive a 
shipment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and related 
material from Iran, via Turkey, by May 2009. As of early 
March, Venezuelan officials believed that the equipment would 
be repackaged and labeled as electronic equipment, then 
transported overland from Iran to Turkey. Once in Turkey, 
the equipment would be loaded onto a maritime vessel for 
continued shipment to Venezuela. The U.S. believes this 
shipment constitutes arms and related materiel, which Iran is 
prohibited from transferring pursuant to UN Security Council 
Resolution 1747, paragraph 5. 
</p><p>¶2. (S) This case appears to be similar to one from January 
2009 where Iran attempted to ship drums of nitrate and 
sulphite chemicals and dismantled laboratory instruments, 
which could possibly be used for making bombs to Venezuela 
via Turkey. In response to U.S. concerns that the shipment 
may have been a violation of UNSCR 1747, Turkish officials 
inspected the cargo and made a decision to return it to Iran. 
(REFS A and B) 
</p><p>-------------- 
ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
</p><p>¶3. (S) Drawing from the points in paragraph 5, which may be 
left as a nonpaper, post is instructed to approach 
appropriate-level Turkish officials and request that they 
investigate this activity, and if the cargo is found to be in 
violation of UNSCR 1747 that the GOT use all available means 
to prevent the transshipment of this cargo and detain it. 
</p><p>---------- 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
</p><p>¶4. (S) Post should seek to achieve the following: 
-- Provide Turkish officials with information regarding 
Iran,s attempt to ship unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 
related material to Venezuela via Turkey; 
</p><p>-- Emphasize to the Turkish officials that UN Security 
Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1747, paragraph 5, prohibits Iran 
from transferring any arms or related materiel; 
</p><p>-- Emphasize that these goods are produced by an Iranian 
entity listed in the Annex to UNSCR 1747. 
</p><p>-- Urge the Government of Turkey (GOT) to take action against 
this shipment pursuant to UNSCR 1747 and possibly 1737, and 
in accordance with the GOT's laws and authorities; 
</p><p>-- Thank the GOT for its willingness to interdict and take 
positive action with regards to a similar shipment in 
January. As a NATO Ally, we try to provide Turkey with as 
much info as possible on these issues, which could help lead 
them to take action in detaining shipments; and 
-- Emphasized that, should we receive additional information 
regarding this shipment, we will provide it as expeditiously 
as possible. 
</p><p>------------------------ 
TALKING POINTS/NON-PAPER 
------------------------ 
</p><p>¶5. (S//REL Turkey) Begin talking points/non-paper: 
</p><p>--We would like to share some information with you in an 
effort to highlight a transfer of proliferation concern and 
to ensure that Iran does not make use of your territory to 
transfer items proscribed by UN Security Council resolutions 
1737, 1747, and 1803. 
</p><p>-- The U.S. has information indicating that Venezuelan 
officials expected to receive a shipment of UAV and 
UAV-related equipment from Iran by May 2009. 
</p><p>-- As of early March, Venezuelan officials believed that the 
equipment would be repackaged and labeled as electronic 
equipment, then transported overland from Iran to Turkey. 
Once in Turkey, the equipment would be loaded onto a maritime 
vessel for continued shipment to Venezuela. 
</p><p>--Venezuelan officials assessed that a shipment of 
electronics coming from Turkey to Venezuela would be less 
alerting than a shipment directly from Iran. 
</p><p>--We believe these items are military UAVs and related items, 
constituting arms and related materials and are thus captured 
by UNSCR 1747 and subject to the asset freeze called for in 
UNSCR 1737. 
</p><p>-- UN Security Council Resolution 1747, paragraph 5, 
prohibits Iran from supplying, selling or transferring any 
arms or related materiel. It also requires all states to 
prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their 
nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, and 
whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of 
Iran. 
</p><p>--This system is produced by the Qods Aviation Industries. 
</p><p>-- Qods Aeronautics Industries (aka Qods Aviations 
Industries) is designated in the Annex to UNSCR 1747 and as 
such these items would be subject to the asset freeze 
provision of UNSCR 1737 regardless of whether the item is 
MTCR- controlled or otherwise prohibited in paragraphs 3 or 4 
of the resolution. 
</p><p>-- As such, we request your assistance in preventing the 
transfer of goods in violation of UNSCR 1747 and 1737. 
</p><p>-- Additionally, it is possible that some UAV-related 
equipment may be MTCR-controlled, per MTCR Item 12.A.1., if 
the equipment is designed or modified to support other 
Iranian UAVs that meet the Item 1.A.2. or 19.A.2. criteria. 
Such items are included in document S/2006/815, the list of 
items, materials, equipment, goods and technology related to 
ballistic missile programs. Transfer of these items would be 
a violation of UNSCR 1737 per paragraph 3. 
</p><p>-- We deeply appreciate the Government of Turkey's continued 
cooperation, support and willingness to enact prompt and 
thorough efforts in promoting interdictions designed to 
prevent the transfer of sensitive materials by Iran.
