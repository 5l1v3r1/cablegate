¶1.  (SBU) As requested reftel, Embassy conveyed information about the 
May Iraq Compact signing to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (MFAT) Officials Darryl Dunn, Director of the Middle East 
and Africa Division, and Carl Worker, Director of the Americas 
Division. 
 
¶2.  (C) Dunn told Pol-Econ Couns that he was grateful for the 
information, as the GNZ has not yet focused on the signing.  He 
observed that the GNZ has not provided Iraq with much direct 
assistance since 61 NZ Defence Force engineers did reconstruction 
work there for twelve months in 2003-4.  That being said, New Zealand 
has an interest in seeing a stable and peaceful Iraq, said Dunn.  He 
said that he would ensure that GNZ Ministers would review our request 
for high-level NZ representation at the Cairo meeting, and promised 
to tell Pol-Econ Couns the results.  But Dunn cautioned that 
Ministerial attendance could be difficult, as Parliament will still 
be out of session in early May and Ministers already have made 
extensive travel commitments over the leave period.
