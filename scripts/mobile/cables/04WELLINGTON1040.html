¶1. (U)  Summary: The Labour Government took its first steps 
in a long-heralded Cabinet reshuffle, with the December 14 
nomination of current Attorney-General Margaret Wilson for 
the position of Speaker of the House.  The Speaker is the 
third highest office in the country and, while the role is 
non-partisan, Speakers do maintain links to their nominating 
party.  Wilson's selection came as a surprise as Defense 
Minister Mark Burton had long been tipped as the 
front-runner, and Opposition parties had informally approved 
of the choice.  The switch to party-ideologue Wilson has 
inflamed opposition parties, who argue that she lacks the 
necessary experience for the job.  However, her confirmation 
is likely, and has now raised interest among Labour MPs as to 
who will take over her three portfolios: as Attorney General, 
Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister and Commerce 
Minister.  With very few Ministerial portfolios deemed 
secure, the full reshuffle (expected within the next week) 
has sparked intense lobbying and speculation.  End summary. 
 
Opposition Inflamed 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Labour Government took its first steps in a 
long-awaited Cabinet reshuffle, with the December 14 
nomination of current Attorney-General Margaret Wilson for 
the position of Speaker of the House.  Under Labour's system 
of nomination, the full caucus votes on who is allowed into 
Parliament, but decisions on the distribution of portfolios 
are made by PM Clark.  Wilson's selection came as a surprise 
as Defense Minister Mark Burton had long been tipped as the 
front-runner, and Opposition parties had informally approved 
of the choice.  Opposition National Deputy Leader Gerry 
Brownlee savaged Wilson's selection, noting that "respect is 
earned, but granted by appointment."  ACT MP Richard Prebble 
categorized the nomination as part of "Helen Clark's 
gender-promoting strategy," and NZ First leader Winston 
Peters carped that his party had not been consulted.  Despite 
these objections, Wilson is likely to be confirmed with a 
solid majority, as both the United Future and Green parties 
have agreed to support Labour and the Progressives. 
 
Role of the Speaker 
------------------- 
 
¶3. (U)  The Speaker of the House is the highest office in the 
House, and third in the country, after the Governor General 
and the PM.  While the role is non-partisan, and the Speaker 
may not display favor for one party over another, Speakers do 
maintain links to their nominating party.  In addition to 
these roles within Parliament, the Speaker presides over 
select committees including the Business Committee, the 
Officers of Parliament Committee and the Standing Orders 
Committee. The Speaker also has statutory responsibilities 
for the Controller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman and the 
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment.  Current 
Speaker Jonathan Hunt will be departing the post in March to 
become High Commissioner to London.  Under NZ's Mixed-Member 
Proportional system, he will be replaced in Parliament by the 
next on the Labour Party list, Lesley Soper, Labour Party 
Women's Vice President. 
 
Wilson's Labour Credentials 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U)  Wilson was President of the Labour Party from 1984 - 
1987, and is widely seen as one of the more uncompromising 
MPs over NZ's anti-nuclear legislation.  Wilson was then 
chief advisor to Labour PM Sir Geoffrey Palmer, and following 
that dean and professor of law at Waikato University.  She 
was elected to Parliament in 1999, and the Opposition has 
pointed out her lack of experience in Opposition in 
condemning her nomination.  Wilson has dismissed this concern 
noting that she is efficient and organized, and will be able 
to learn "on the job."  Earlier in the year Wilson had 
publicly spoken of a desire to leave Parliament and return to 
academia, but was convinced by the caucus to stay. 
 
Is there a lawyer in the house? 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Wilson's nomination has not only set the Opposition 
boiling, but has raised interest among Labour MPs as to who 
will take over her three portfolios, as Attorney General, 
Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister and Commerce 
Minister.  The Attorney General is the senior law officer of 
the Crown as well as having responsibility for the Crown Law 
Office, the Serious Fraud Office and the Parliamentary 
Counsel Office.  This combination requires the incumbent to 
combine the obligation to act in a non-partisan matter on 
some issues with the political partisanship of being a 
Minister.  Speculation on her replacement is rife, as a 
lawyer has traditionally held the role of Attorney General, 
but Labour has only 5 lawyers.  These include two first-term 
MPs plus disgraced Ministers John Tamihere and Lianne 
Dalziel.  Michael Cullen and Phil Goff (who is not a lawyer) 
are considered the most likely candidates for the post, but 
this would require either of the men to give up another 
portfolio. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
¶6. (C)  Although unexpected, Wilson has publicly expressed 
dissatisfaction with her portfolios, and is not seen as 
widely supported by business.  Clark's decision to move her 
from active portfolios to the Speaker's job is likely a plum 
offered as an enticement for Wilson to remain in Parliament 
through the next election.  Wilson's nomination has throw 
Parliament and the media into a frenzy, as previously "safe" 
portfolios are now open to reexamination and possible 
redistribution.  In terms of personal politics, Wilson is 
widely seen as one of the more uncompromising MPs over NZ's 
anti-nuclear legislation, as she was integral in its passage. 
 Her confirmation as Speaker means she will no longer attend 
Cabinet meetings, removing a strong anti-nuclear voice from 
the fray.  However, she and Helen Clark are very close 
personal friends, and she undoubtedly has the ear of the PM. 
 
¶7.  (C) Wilson's move comes among intense speculation that 
other, unrelated Cabinet shuffles are in the works, to be 
announced within the week.  According to Parliamentary 
insiders, the PM has reportedly said that only the Finance 
and Foreign Affairs portfolios "need stability" and will not 
change.  While their portfolios may not change drastically, 
the competition among ministers to prove their worth has 
intensified.  Stay tuned.
