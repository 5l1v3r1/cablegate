¶1. (U) PolChief, EU Unit Chief and visiting Finland Deskoff 
delivered subject demarche to Finnish EU Correspondent Jarno 
Syrjala Sept. 13.  Syrjala welcomed our input and offered the 
following notable responses: 
 
¶2. (C) SUDAN/DARFUR: Syrjala expressed pessimism regarding 
the situation on the ground and noted that keeping the AMIS 
effort on track in the face of increasing antagonism from 
Khartoum will become "the big headache for the rest of (the 
Finnish) presidency."  EU Special Rep Pekka Haavisto (a Finn) 
has just returned from Sudan and, based on his report, High 
Rep Solana will provide recommendations to the ministers. 
However, next steps for the EU appear very unclear, given 
that Haavisto was able to make very little progress in moving 
the GOS to accept a UN re-hatting of the AMIS mission. 
Unless Khartoum changes its stance dramatically, some EU 
members are beginning to float the idea of raising the 
possibility of moving toward UN sanctions and possibly even 
indictments at the ICC (Germany, in particular, appears to 
support this option, Syrjala said).  As for the future of the 
operation, there is EU money from the African Peace Facility 
(APF) to support AMIS through the end of October, and 
thereafter national British and Dutch contributions will keep 
it afloat through year's end (see also ref b).  Thereafter, 
however, several member states are uneasy about supporting 
the mission well into 2007 without the UN re-hatting.  In the 
shorter term, Syrjala said, expect the GAERC to issue a 
strong statement in support of UNSCR 1706;  in addition, the 
Finns will seek to hold a troika (Council, Commission, 
Finland, Germany) format meeting with the Sudanese during UN 
Week to express their concerns. 
 
¶3. (C) IRAN: Solana's initial conversations with Larijani did 
not prompt tremendous optimism within the EU, but the mantra 
remains "in Javier we trust," Syrjala said.  He again 
emphasized that the Solana-Larijani meetings are 
"clarifications," not "negotiations," and that this had been 
made very clear to the Iranians.  In response to our specific 
question, Syrjala said that the EU3 remain firmly committed 
to UNSC sanctions should Tehran refuse the path of peaceful 
negotiation and fail to halt its enrichment program, and that 
all 22 other member states fully support this.  However, he 
added, problems could emerge if the US and the EU are unable 
to convince China and Russia to accept sanctions.  While many 
member states would support "unilateral" EU and US sanctions 
against Iran, Syrjala opined, other MS might not.  The Finns 
received "somewhat encouraging" signs from Moscow during a 
bilateral political directors' meeting last week, Syrjala 
reported, and it appears "Solana has been doing some 
effective diplomacy" with the Russians.  However, China 
remains more problematic.  Again, looking toward the GAERC, 
Syrjala said that the conclusion issued -- and hence next 
steps -- on Iran will depend largely on what Solana reports 
from his next meeting with Larijani. 
 
¶4. (C) ISRAEL-PALESTINE: Syrjala assured us that the EU and 
the US remain united in demanding that any PA national unity 
government must explicitly accept the Quartet's principles. 
The burden falls to Hamas to accept the three main conditions 
that have been well established by the international 
community, he said.  FM Errki Tuomioja spoke Sept. 12 to 
President Abbas and reported that he remained upbeat, Syrjala 
said, but expressed some concern that Abbas may be "promising 
too much too fast," given Hamas' poor track record this far. 
In the meantime, the EU will need to extend the Temporary 
International Mechanism to address the humanitarian situation.
