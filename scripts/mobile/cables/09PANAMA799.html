¶1. (S/NF) Summary: President Ricardo Martinelli's most trusted 
advisor, Minister of the Presidency Jimmy Papadimitriu, has 
appealed to the Embassy to assist him in focusing the president's 
attention on security issues and bringing order to the GOP's 
chaotic security policy apparatus.  Papadimitriu lamented 
Martinelli's limited attention span and the infighting among senior 
GOP security officials, at a time when skyrocketing crime and drug 
trafficking are threatening Panama's future stability and 
prosperity.  He acknowledged that the president's preoccupation 
with political wiretaps had sidetracked more serious GOP security 
efforts, and he asked the Ambassador to meet regularly with 
Martinelli to give him the USG's views on security directly from 
the source. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) During an October 21 meeting with Ambassador, DCM and 
PolSec officer, Papadimitriu said he had come to realize that 
citizen security is the key issue for the Martinelli government, 
and that failure to address the problem could undermine the GOP's 
success in other areas and threaten future investment and economic 
growth. (Comment: This represents serious progress.  When we met 
last month with Papadimitriu to coordinate anti-gang and Darien 
strategies, he had dismissed rising crime as a perception problem 
driven by irresponsible media, a view we challenged.  End comment) 
He acknowledged that President Martinelli's preoccupation with 
obtaining wiretap capability to keep tabs on his political 
opponents (ref B) had diverted attention from serious action to 
confront Panama's true security threats.  He expressed regret that 
the wiretap issue had been a source of tension with the Embassy. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Papadimitriu said he had advised Martinelli to tone down 
his aggressive public campaign to destroy former president Ernesto 
Perez-Balladares, and to focus his attention on citizen security. 
He admitted that he has had limited success in that regard, and 
that the president was still receiving a briefing first thing every 
morning from intelligence chief Olmeido Alfaro on the activities of 
his political adversaries.  He observed that Martinelli's 
hyperactive management style and exceedingly short attention span 
made it difficult to direct him toward the necessary work of fixing 
Panama's broken government administrative systems, which are the 
greatest impediment to security reform. 
 
Everybody and Nobody is in Charge 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4.  (S/NF) Describing in great detail his frustration with the 
chaotic state of GOP security policy, Papadimitriu complained that 
senior GOP security figures -- Vice President Juan Carlos Varela, 
Minister of Government and Justice Jose Raul Mulino, national 
police director Gustavo Perez, and intelligence chief Olmeido 
Alfaro -- were all continually jockeying for power.  He said, 
"Every one of them thinks he is in charge, and everyone has his own 
version of what the gringos say."  Papadimitriu said this situation 
sowed confusion, because each claimed to have the Embassy's 
endorsement for their pet projects and each brought Martinelli a 
different view of the Embassy's positions on security issues. 
 
¶5. (S/NF) The Ambassador told Papadimitriu that this was precisely 
why she had pressed so persistently for their meeting to take 
place.  She suspected that the hours she and the Embassy security 
team had been devoting to meeting with their GOP counterparts were 
not resulting in a clear picture reaching the president., and that 
she had personally spent many hours briefing GOPQncipals and had 
provided extensive documentation.  She assured him that we would 
continue in that effort. 
 
¶6. (S/NF) The Ambassador explained the Embassy's efforts to provide 
President Martinelli with some quick wins on security -- chiefly 
the dismantling of the FARC drug trafficking operation in the 
 
Darien, which we believe is fueling the serious uptick in murders 
in the capital -- in order to buy time for police reforms that are 
as necessary as they are tedious.  She explained that she had, in 
the wake of her mid-September meeting with Martinelli (ref C), 
moved on multiple fronts on the green light he had given her to 
develop a comprehensive plan of action in the Darien. While she and 
her team had repeatedly briefed the vice president/foreign 
minister, the minister of government and justice, and service 
chiefs, she wanted to be sure she was still acting within the 
president's guidance. 
 
The USG is Key 
-------------------- 
 
¶7.  (S/NF) Papadimitriu acknowledged he was very worried about the 
disarray in the GOP's security team, because he knows that security 
is far and away the top concern among Panamanians and recent polls 
show increasing concern that perceptions of citizen insecurity are 
getting worse.  He admitted that, "We are riding on a huge 
honeymoon" that would soon end, and the GOP's perceived lack of 
effective action on security could cause grave damage to the 
president's image. 
 
¶8.  (S/NF) As for what to do, he first suggested that the 
Ambassador join the GOP's regular weekly security briefings.  He 
then suggested the Ambassador meet every week with the president. 
He then suggested that VP/FM Varela was the best GOP official to 
coordinate GOP security policy.  The Ambassador replied that there 
were pros and cons to each of these approaches, and suggested 
Papadimitriu let her know how the president wishes to proceed. 
 
¶9.  (S/NF) That evening, the AmbassadoQeceived a BlackBerry chat 
message from the president stating, "Get Silver [the ringleader of 
the FARC drug trafficking ring]. You have my blessing. Need to meet 
every week."  The Ambassador replied suggesting blocks of time 
suitable for a meeting.  To cover all the bases, she is hosting 
VP/FM Varela for lunch on October 23 to review security and other 
issues.  At the request of MOGJ, she will also host the minister 
and his service chiefs for breakfast on October 28. 
 
¶10. (S/NF) Comment: Effective GOP coordination on security is 
clearly still a work in progress.  Embassy support to this effort 
will remain robust.

President, and Minister of the Presidency 
 
REF: PANAMA 777; PANAMA 829; PANAMA 831 
NOVEMBER 10, 2009 BROWNFIELD-STEPHENSON EMAIL 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Debra L. Hevia, Political Counselor, State, POL; 
REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary/Introduction: The Ambassador and DCM spent six hours 
in meetings with top government officials on November 25 to work 
through a number of specific security issues, as well as to agree 
on a structure for better coordination on security issues.  End 
summary/ introduction. 
 
 
 
The U.S. Is Panama's Partner 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador and DCM met first with Vice President/Foreign 
Minister Juan Carlos Varela and Minister of the Presidency Demetrio 
"Jimmy" Papadimitriu, after which they all joined President Ricardo 
Martinelli for lunch.  The Ambassador turned to the top concern of 
Panamanian citizens: security, noting that the Embassy's top 
priority in Panama is security, and that violence threatens 
long-term governance and prosperity.  She assured the GOP that the 
Embassy would strongly support both aggressive efforts against 
traffickers and robust programs to keep youth out of gangs. 
However, she expressed concern that many initiatives have been 
stalled due to divisions within the government or a lack of 
internal coordination, and in the case of the Council for Public 
Security and National Defense (Consejo), leadership that has worked 
directly counter to our bilateral information-sharing programs (ref 
A). 
 
 
 
¶3. (C) The Ambassador detailed the many programs the USG provides 
to assist Panama on security issues, including NAS assistance, 
Coast Guard and Navy patrols, Southcom humanitarian and development 
projects, gang-prevention initiatives, and 30 U.S. federal law 
enforcement agents working side-by-side with Panamanian 
counterparts.  The Ambassador underscored that Panama does not need 
to search for a partner on security issues; it already has one. 
 
 
 
GOP: No Plan or Leadership on Security 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (C) Papadimitriu acknowledged the lack of GOP coordination, 
saying that there is no consensus about security and no plan to 
address it.  He said the Ministry of Government and Justice (MOGJ) 
was too unwieldy, and that Minister Jose Raul Mulino did not have 
the full support and confidence of the government, but no one else 
wanted the job.  Papadimitriu added, "We don't have anyone who 
wakes up thinking about security in the way you do.  No one feels 
accountable or responsible."  Martinelli ridiculed Mulino, saying 
that at Cabinet meetings he often talks for 20 minutes nonstop, 
with an attitude that he knows more than everyone else because he 
served in government previously, causing the other ministers to 
stop listening and start working on their blackberries. 
 
 
 
¶5. (C) The Ambassador asked who the GOP was considering naming as 
the new minister of security, and Martinelli admitted he had not 
thought about it, but it would not be Mulino.  He said Director of 
the Panamanian National Police Gustavo Perez wanted to remain in 
his job, and Martinelli was happy to leave him there.  The 
Ambassador and DCM urged Martinelli to choose a strong manager, who 
did not necessarily have to be a security expert. 
 
 
Joint Task Force/Maritime Bases 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) The Ambassador detailed how our efforts to help the GOP 
stand up a small maritime task force that could operate off the 
Darien's Pacific coast using existing Panamanian security resources 
had spiraled into a vitriolic public debate about U.S. involvement 
in "maritime bases" (ref B).  Papadimitriu was dismayed, and asked 
for a paper detailing the operation that the President could sign 
off on as a direct order to Mulino and the service chiefs. (Note: 
DCM provided a NAS-drafted paper the same afternoon, which 
Martinelli signed.)  Papadimitriu had not paid close attention to 
the bases controversy but nor was he alarmed, as his internal 
polling showed most Panamanians were not greatly concerned about 
the bases.  He agreed with the Ambassador and DCM that the GOP 
needed to have a credible spokesperson on security issues, and 
coordinate its messaging both internally and (where appropriate) 
with the Embassy. 
 
 
 
Global CST and Israeli Involvement 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) The Ambassador expressed concerns about the proposals made 
by Israeli security company Global CST, citing negative experiences 
in Colombia and the difficulty of working with Israeli presence in 
GOP ministries (ref C and D).  Varela said the GOP could solve its 
own problems without relying on contractors.  Papadimitriu 
expressed surprise at the reports from Colombia, as he believed CST 
had been hired with Plan Colombia funds with the USG's blessing. 
He said he did not want to do anything to harm Panama's 
relationship with the U.S. and would ask CST president Ziv to stand 
down, though he later admitted it would be difficult since CST had 
spent its own money sending a large team to Panama to complete a 
survey.  In particular, Papadimitriu was receptive to the argument 
that Panama did not need to buy expensive coastal radars or other 
hardware recommended by CST.  However, he liked CST's ideas about 
creating a ministry of security and reorganizing the GOP security 
structure, as well as their suggestion to recruit management talent 
from the private sector.  To sum up, Papadimitriu said he was 
shocked by the conversation, and would not let Israeli influence 
damage the U.S.-Panama relationship.  Martinelli was similarly 
taken aback, and emphasized that he did not want to endanger 
relations with the USG, saying "We don't want to change friends." 
He said he would call Colombian President Uribe to get the straight 
scoop on CST. 
 
 
 
Matador Judicialized Wiretap Program 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶8. (C) Martinelli asked for additional wiretap assistance, saying 
the GOP needed to catch ordinary criminals in addition to drug 
trafficking organizations.  The Ambassador and DCM suggested that 
our judicialized wiretap program could be expanded, but it must 
still be moved out from under the control of Consejo to preserve 
the judicial quality of the evidence collected.  Given the 
President's opposition to putting it under the control of the 
Attorney General, the Ambassador referred to the agreement VP/FM 
Varela had worked out to move the Matador program under Panamanian 
National Police Director Gustavo Perez.  Martinelli confirmed his 
agreement with that plan. 
 
 
Moving Forward 
 
------------------- 
 
¶9. (C) The GOP and Embassy agreed to continue this on-going 
dialogue through a bi-weekly security meeting including Varela, 
Papadimitriu, and Mulino on one side and the Ambassador, DCM, and 
political-security officer on the other.  Martinelli said that he, 
Varela, and Papadimitriu were the "circle zero" of the GOP, and 
that no important decisions were taken unless the three of them had 
discussed it and agreed on a course of action. 
 
 
 
Bio notes 
 
----------- 
 
¶10. (C) In general, Martinelli seemed more relaxed overall and less 
aggressive than we have seen him in previous meetings.  His general 
tone was respectful and positive, in contrast with his previous 
argumentative, drive-a-hard-bargain manner. 
 
 
 
¶11. (C) Regarding the recent arrest of his cousin Ramon Martinelli 
in Mexico on money laundering charges, Martinelli said he was 
satisfied.  If the Mexicans had not arrested him, the GOP had plans 
to arrest him.  He said Ramon had always been a "black sheep" and 
was sullying the good Martinelli family name.
