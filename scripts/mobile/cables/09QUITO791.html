REF: QUITO 00437 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Heather Hodges for Reasons 1.4 (b, d) 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: During his latest weekly address on August 
29, President Correa lashed out against the independent 
television station, Teleamazonas, and what he called "a sewer 
with antennas" and demanded its immediate closure following 
its airing of a clandestine recording.  The 2008 audio 
recording, captured Correa's discussions with a PAIS assembly 
member and other government officials about changes made to 
the text of the constitution after it had already been 
approved by the Constituent Assembly.  Correa denies the 
allegations and insists that Teleamazonas be shut down on 
grounds that it violated the Broadcasting Law prohibiting the 
broadcasting of clandestine recordings.  Fernando Balda, 
ex-PAIS member and instigator of the Teleamazonas' airing of 
the tape, claims the recording was actually made by the 
current Minister of Political Coordination.  In the meantime, 
the legality of a potential closure of the independent 
station remains in question.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 29, during his weekly public address, 
Correa lashed out against the "filth" Teleamazonas and its 
"conspirators" reported in his heated tirade about the 
illegality of the station's airing of a clandestine audio 
tape allegedly of Correa, his Minister of Political 
Coordination, Ricardo Patino, and PAIS assembly member and 
president of the Oversight and Political Accountability 
Commission, Silvia Salgado.  In the tape, the three discuss a 
different version of the constitution submitted by President 
Correa after the text had already left the hands of the 
Constituent Assembly, prior to the September 28, 2009 
referendum vote.  The recording was made public on August 25, 
2009, by Fernando Balda, Patriotic Society Party assembly 
member and PAIS defector, on Jorge Ortiz's Teleamazonas 
program.  According to Balda, he took the recording to the 
Prosecutor General office and made a formal complaint back in 
March.  After inaction by that office, he decided to make the 
video public, first on You Tube in August and then on 
Teleamazonas last week.  Balda stated that he would present 
Patino as the person behind the recording to the Prosecutor 
General's office on September 1; however, no update was 
available at the point of this cable's release.  In his radio 
address, Correa accused Balda of making the covert recording 
himself and threatened him with a charge of treason and 
prison for "spying on the president" and "threatening 
national security." 
 
¶3. (SBU) With this latest episode, Teleamazonas potentially 
faces a fourth investigation and third sanction against them, 
which would likely lead to the station's closure (reftel). 
In his address, Correa accused the station and newsman Jorge 
Ortiz of "violating the principles of ethics and breaking the 
Broadcasting Law."  Specifically, the article of the law in 
question states that the "reproduction of clandestine videos 
and/or recordings unauthorized" by those individuals in the 
recording and in a manner that affects the "honor of people 
consecrated in the Constitution" is cause for an infraction. 
In their defense, Teleamazonas claims to have not broken any 
rules since they were not involved in the making of the 
recording, since the tape was made in the President's office 
during official hours and since its content was made public 
by Balda on You Tube as well as in the written press prior to 
Tuesday's airing on Teleamazonas. 
 
¶4. (C) If a formal complaint against Teleamazonas is 
submitted to the regulatory body by the President, it is 
unlikely to result in immediate closure.  A Teleamazonas 
executive told Embassy public affairs officer that if the 
government does decide to bring charges against the station, 
it will have to go through the formal legal procedures.  Due 
to the various steps and associated time limits with the 
sanction process it would be "five weeks at best" before a 
resolution would be reached.  In light of the previous 
publication of the audio clip and its transcript, the station 
representative expressed concern that television is being 
targeted for its power to reach the "masses." 
 
¶5. (C) COMMENT: After a short period of relative calm 
surrounding Teleamazonas, the recent airing of the 
clandestine audio clip has Correa fuming and the station in 
hot water.  However, with so many questions still left 
unanswered, such as who made the recording and under what 
context was it made, it may be too early to gauge the 
likelihood of a Teleamazonas closure, or the truth behind the 
 
allegations against the President and his advisors.
