</p><p>¶1. (U) This message contains an action message for the
Department -- see para 6.
</p><p>¶2. (C) Finance Minister Jihad Azour alerted us this morning
to a forthcoming request from the Lebanese Central Bank for
assistance in transporting cash in US dollars from Cyprus to
Beirut. The Central Bank planned to consign this cash
shipment to a private Lebanese currency trader in Cyprus.
However, it would need Israeli permission for the consignees
and their shipment to cross the ongoing blockade of the
Lebanese coast. Azour asked for USG assistance in securing
permission from the Israeli government.
</p><p>¶3. (C) In a subsequent telephone conversation, Central Bank
Governor Riad Salame confirmed this request and said that the
amount of cash to be shipped would be in the range of USD
20-30 million. It could be made available for shipment from
Cyprus within 24 to 48 hours of a green light from the
Israeli government, Salame said.
</p><p>¶4. (C) Governor Salame told the Ambassador that this
shipment would ease a serious shortage of cash in the
Lebanese economy -- which is over 70 percent dollarized.
This shortage was being wrongly interpreted as a sign of
impending financial crisis, and threatening to lead to even
greater panic among the general public as a result. Salame
strongly urged the Ambassador to secure USG assistance in
allowing the shipment to go through.
</p><p>¶5. (C) Minister Azour asked us to consider having USG
personnel, rather than Lebanese consignees, handle the cash
from Cyprus to Beirut. That way, there would be less reason
for the Israelis to object, as the Israelis could be more
certain that nothing but cash was aboard. Also, the Lebanese
consignees would not risk being accused by the Israelis of
having abused their permission to cross the blockade.
</p><p>¶6. (C) Comment and action request: Were USG personnel to
handle the cash shipment, they could carry it in a helicopter
from Cyprus via the Beirut airbridge, which has been
operational since July 15. Post requests that the Department
work with Embassy Tel Aviv to secure Israeli permission for
the cash shipment, and that it make the Beirut airbridge
available for this purpose. We know from our economic and
financial contacts that, indeed, there are pending signs of
panic, as depositers are unable to get currency for
transactions (which, in Lebanon, are largely dollar-based).
As part of our strategy to help make sure that the Siniora
government is not fatally weakened by the Israeli attacks, we
hope that we can persuade the Israelis to help us prevent a
financial panic that will inevitably cast a deep political
shadow over Siniora and his cabinet. End comment and action
request.
