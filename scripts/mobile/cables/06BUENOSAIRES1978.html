¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Although the August 25-26 national 
convention of the Radical Civic Union (UCR) confirmed that 
the UCR would remain an opposition party, it also 
demonstrated the UCR's weakened state because the most 
significant party leaders failed to attend.  Calls by UCR 
Congressman Federico Storani to expel the Radicales K from 
the party were rejected by other party leaders -- so it 
appears that there will not be a formal split for the time 
being -- although the convention solidified the de facto 
division of the party.  Other elements in the party are 
opposed to former President Raul Alfonsin and other party 
leaders' proposal for the UCR to support former Economy 
Minister Roberto Lavagna for President next year.  Party 
leaders did not decide on candidates for the 2007 elections 
at the convention, but did grant UCR Party President Roberto 
Iglesias the power to negotiate electoral accords with 
Lavagna and other political parties.  In the days since the 
convention, GOA and UCR leaders have exchanged sharp public 
criticism.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Although the August 25-26 national convention of 
the Radical Civic Union (UCR) confirmed that the UCR would 
remain an opposition party, it also demonstrated the UCR's 
weakened state because the most significant party leaders 
failed to attend.  (For more on the current state of the UCR, 
see reftel.)  National UCR party leaders at the convention in 
the city of Rosario rejected President Kirchner's call to 
join his ""concertacion"" and stated that the UCR would remain 
an opposition force.  However, the show of unity was 
overshadowed by the absence of the most important UCR 
leaders, most notably the Radicales K -- comprising the 
majority of the UCR Governors and the most important UCR 
Mayors -- who avoided the gathering on Kirchner's orders. 
Calls by UCR Congressman Federico Storani to expel the 
Radicales K from the party were rejected by other party 
leaders, so it appears that the party will not formally split 
for the time being, although the convention solidified the de 
facto division of the party.  Socialist Congressmen Hermes 
Binner and Ruben Giustiniani, who are in alliance with the 
UCR in Santa Fe province, attended the convention, although 
other Socialist leaders subsequently publicly stated that 
their attendance did not signify that the Socialist Party 
(PS) has an alliance with the UCR on a national level. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On the other side of the party, National Senator 
Rodolfo Terragno refused to attend because of his opposition 
to former President Raul Alfonsin and other party leaders' 
proposal for the UCR to support former Economy Minister 
Roberto Lavagna for President next year.  Both Terragno and 
UCR General Secretary Margarita Stolbizer advocate developing 
a new party platform before endorsing candidates and favor 
endorsing a UCR member for President, rather than a Peronist 
opposition candidate like Lavagna.  Party leaders did not 
decide on candidates for the 2007 elections at the 
convention, but did grant UCR Party President Roberto 
Iglesias the power to negotiate electoral accords with 
Lavagna and other political parties. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In the days since the convention, GOA and UCR 
leaders have exchanged sharp public criticism.  Kirchner held 
a public event with Mendoza Governor and leading Radicales K 
member Julio Cobos and portrayed the UCR leaders still in the 
opposition as representing negative aspects of Argentina's 
past.  Alfonsin countered Kirchner's attacks by contrasting 
Alfonsin's record fighting for human rights during the 
military dictatorship to Kirchner's support for Menem's 
reelection and now-much-criticized privatization campaign in 
the mid-1990s. 
 
¶5.  (C) COMMENT: The Rosario convention marked what looks 
like the beginning of the end of the UCR as a national 
political force.  In theory, the end of Argentina's 
traditional party system provides the opportunity for a more 
 
BUENOS AIR 00001978  002 OF 002 
 
 
rational political system to develop.  Both of the 
traditional parties -- the UCR and the Peronist Party (PJ) -- 
have practiced a clientelistic-style of politics that has 
prevented new parties from consolidating since the return to 
democracy in 1983.  Third parties that gained traction for a 
short period of time, such as the UcDe in the 1980s and 
Frepaso in the 1990s, largely disappeared after being coaxed 
into alliances with one of the traditional parties.  The 
traditional parties have lacked ideological coherence, as 
left-wing and right-wing elements have coexisted under the 
same party logo.  However, despite President Kirchner's 
rhetoric to the contrary, Argentina does not appear to be any 
closer to developing a rational system of center-right and 
center-left parties.  Kirchner's poaching of the UCR and 
other minor parties have netted him both left-wing and 
right-wing leaders, and the remaining opposition is spread 
across the ideological spectrum.  The health of Argentina's 
democratic system is the main loser in this political 
development, as the opposition has become even weaker as a 
result.  END COMMENT.
