(SBU) Summary: After renewed clashes between police and Shi'a youths December 18, there were no further disturbances and the streets remained quiet as of mid-afternoon December 20. The intervention of Shi'a community leaders helped defuse the situation. End summary.
</p><p>¶2. (SBU) Following clashes December 17 between police and youths in several Shi'a neighborhoods (ref C), about 3000 Shi'a gathered peacefully early December 18 for the burial in Jid Hafs of the street protester Ali Jassim Mekki (aka Ali Jassim Makki Al-Barbari). After most of the mourners dispersed, about 200 youths burned rubbish and threw stones at police, who responded with tear gas. There were no injuries or arrests reported, and the disturbances ended around nightfall. As of 3:00 p.m. local time December 20 no further protests have taken place.
</p><p>¶3. (SBU) Credit for the apparent end of the violence should go to the intervention of Shi'a clerics and Wifaq party leaders (as well as the onset of the Eid December 19.) As reported ref C, MP Ali Salman, leader of the Wifaq bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, persuaded the Mekki family to permit the autopsy which attributed the death to natural causes. Shi'a clerics Ahmad al-Asfoor, Saeed al-Wada'ee, and a number of lesser clergy attended the funeral.
</p><p>¶4. (C) After Eid, we expect some Shi'a politicians to question the autopsy's results and to press for an independent inquiry into Mekki's death. End comment. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI</p>
