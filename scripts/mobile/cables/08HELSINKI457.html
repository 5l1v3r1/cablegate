 ¶1. (C) PolOff and Finland Desk Officer met with Finnish MFA 
Counselor Tony Paso, Unit for EU Enlargement and West Balkans 
on October 7.  Regarding the Serbian resolution, Paso said 
that the Government of Finland (GoF) will abstain regardless 
of the EU position, coinciding with the public position taken 
by President Halonen and Foreign Minister Stubb in late 
September.  He said the GoF hoped to see the rest of the EU 
abstain. Paso also said that the GoF would join in a 
declaration by the EU countries recognizing Kosovo if any is 
made to provide a voting explanation.  Paso also noted that 
Cyprus will vote for the resolution since their President has 
publicly declared in favor and won't move to abstain.  He 
indicated that Romania and Spain may also vote for the 
resolution and that surprisingly, Sweden may vote for the 
resolution or possibly abstain.  The UK was the only EU 
member who wanted to vote against the resolution.  GoF 
expects the resolution to pass in the General Assembly. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment: GoF is abstaining in line with their 
longstanding support for international fora for conflict 
resolution.  Their initial inclination was to vote against. 
Serbia approached them in July, and after further internal 
GoF discussion they decided to abstain regardless of the EU 
position.  End Comment.
