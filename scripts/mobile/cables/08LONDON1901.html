<br>SUBJECT: SYRIAN IAEA BOARD CANDIDACY: U.K. AGREES WITH 
<br>U.S.COURSE OF ACTION  REF: STATE 76033  
<br>
<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>¶1. (S) HMG concurs with the U.S. assessment of Syria's candidacy to the IAEA Board of Directors and will do what it can to support Kazakhstan's candidacy, FCO Counter Proliferation Officer George Sherriff told poloff on July 21.  Sherriff said that his counterparts in Vienna "agree on (the USG) course of action and will do what (they) can."  He indicated that HMG has "already started (internal) talks" on the issue, and that they were "happy to do" what they could to further Kazakhstan's candidacy.  Sherriff indicated that he will keep us informed of HMG's subsequent actions on this matter.  
</p><p>Comment -------  
</p><p>¶2. (S) Sherriff, who was filling in for Nuclear Issues Team Leader Nick Low, did not offer any specific information on HMG's plans to support Kazakhstan and/or pressure MESA countries to back away from a Syrian candidacy, and appears to have closely consulted with UK IAEA Mission in Vienna on the response to the U.S. message.  US Mission UNVIE may want to follow up with U.K. delegation counterparts on what specific steps HMG will take with MESA members and in Astana to push for Kazakhstan's candidacy.  Embassy London will pass on any further information on HMG's actions when it becomes available through FCO channels.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX TUTTLE</p>
