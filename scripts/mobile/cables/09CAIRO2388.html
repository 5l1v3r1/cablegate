BLOME REASONS: 1.4 (B) and (D)1.(C) Key points: -- Arab League Chief of Staff Hisham Yousef told poloff Dec 27 the Arab League was moving forward with the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development on an Arab small/medium enterprise fund. More than USD one billion has been pledged by Arab states thus far. -- Iranian Majlis speaker Ali Larijani met with Moussa on Dec 23. Yousef said the two discussed key regional issues; Larijani told Moussa that Tehran "fully supports" the Yemeni government but criticized recent Saudi military action against Houthi rebels. -- Iraqi PM Maliki met SYG Moussa on Dec 18. Yousef said Iraq appears to be on a positive political trajectory, and noted the successful passage of the electoral law. -- When asked about Moussa's Dec 23 interview with Al Masri Al Youm (in which Moussa was critical of aspects of Egyptian domestic policy), Yousef did not foreclose the possibility of Moussa running for president in 2011, and noted that Moussa's position as AL SYG prevented him from going farther on this subject.
