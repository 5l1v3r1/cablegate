During his stint as acting CEO of BTV, he presided over a successful collaboration with the State Department's Office of Broadcast Services in producing a documentary program about the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** HENZEL</p>
