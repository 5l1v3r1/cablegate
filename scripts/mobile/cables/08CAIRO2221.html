  		<h1>IS THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT READY FOR A GLOBAL SLOWDOWN? Sensitive but unclassified. Please handle accordingly.1.(SBU) Summary: Egypt's stock market, like nearly all globally, has been significantly down this year and the global financial crisis has only accelerated that decline. The index is down 50 percent from its April historic highs, and in October, the most intense period of global financial crisis, the local index shed more than 20 percent of its value. That said, just a small percentage of Egyptians are invested in the stock market, Egyptian banks are very conservative, and Egypt enters this volatile period with strong growth, so Egypt's real economy has seen relatively little specific impacts from the financial crisis. However, the Government would probably like to believe that it is more immune than it is. President Mubarak has held two Cabinet meetings with his economic team recently, and several members of the economic team have spoken publicly about planned reforms and other initiatives to ease the economic impact of ongoing financial turmoil, including an October 12 press conference by Prime Minister Nazif and an October 19 speech at the AmCham by Minister of Trade Rachid. The message has been that Egypt's financial system is safe, that the GOE is monitoring the situation, and that even in a global recession Egypt will weather the storm better than others. While we are not aware of any comprehensive assessments done by the GOE on the specific risks Egypt faces in this global crisis, some ministers have mentioned some "new plans" and "incentives" in the press, none of which contain specificity. End Summary.</h1>
