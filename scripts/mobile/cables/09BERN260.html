¶1. (S) Summary:  Special Envoy for Guantanamo Closure Dan \
Fried discussed prospective Guantanamo detainee resettlement \
cases on June 19 with Michael Ambuehl, State Secretary \
(Deputy Minister) of the Federal Department of Foreign \
Affairs (FDFA).  Referring to the case files that the GoS \
already has received from the USG (ref B), Fried asked that \
Switzerland focus its consideration particularly on cases \
ISN-277 and ISN-103, two Uighur brothers that the USG \
believes should be resettled together.  Ambuehl emphasized \
that the GoS is "committed to taking some detainees," and \
wants to move ahead, but needs some additional information \
(per para 6 below) on the individuals it is considering \
before decisions can be made.  Fried assured Ambuehl that the \
USG would work on providing information.  Ambuehl said it \
would be very useful if this additional information could be \
provided the week of June 22.  End Summary. \
 \
¶2. (SBU) Special Envoy for Guantanamo Closure Dan Fried \
discussed prospective Guantanamo detainee resettlement cases \
on June 19 with Michael Ambuehl, State Secretary (Deputy \
Minister) of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs \
(FDFA).  Ambuehl was joined in the meeting by Ambassador \
Yvonne Baumann, Head of the FDFA's Americas Division; \
Ambassador Marion Weichelt, Deputy FDFA Legal Advisor; Daniel \
Hunn, Deputy Head of the FDFA's Americas Division; and Michel \
Besson, Justice Ministry representative and deputy head of \
the Swiss interagency working group that is reviewing \
prospective resettlement cases. \
 \
¶3. (S) SE Fried provided Ambuehl an overview of current USG \
efforts to resettle in third countries Guantanamo detainees \
identified for release who cannot return to their countries \
of origin, due to humanitarian concerns.  Referring to the \
case files that the GoS already has received from the USG \
(ref B), Fried asked that Switzerland focus its consideration \
particularly on cases ISN-277 and ISN-103, two Uighur \
brothers that the USG believes should be resettled together. \
Fried explained that resettlement in Palau is a poor option \
for ISN-103, who suffers from some psychological problems \
that will require appropriate care.  He noted that \
Switzerland is well suited to assist a person in this \
condition and would offer a good option for resettlement in \
the context of a joint resettlement with ISN-277.  Fried also \
asked the GoS to continue to consider ISN-519 (Palestinian) \
and ISN-455 (Uzbek) for resettlement. \
 \
¶4. (S) Ambuehl emphasized that the GoS is "committed to \
taking some detainees," and wants to move ahead, but needs \
some additional information on the individuals it is \
considering before decisions can be made.  He said that the \
GoS had, in fact, initially hoped to be the first government \
to accept former Guantanamo detainees for resettlement after \
the Administration's decision to close the facility, but was \
not able to accomplish that "because we (the GoS) are very \
thorough" in reviewing the cases.  Ambuehl remarked that, \
from an internal security perspective, the Uighurs seemed to \
present the most promising cases.  On the other hand, he \
observed that the Chinese are lobbying heavily against anyone \
accepting Uighurs for resettlement.  More broadly, Ambuehl \
commented that the general European public view of the \
resettlement issues is that the USG should "fix its own \
problem."  In this context, he referred to recent U.S. \
Congressional efforts to prohibit the resettlement of former \
detainees in the United States as particularly unhelpful.  SE \
Fried emphasized that the U.S. Administration is continuing \
to work on this issue with the Congress. \
 \
¶5. (S) Ambassador Weichelt, who is the senior FDFA \
point-of-contact on the resettlement issue, reiterated that \
the GoS needs additional details on the individuals under \
review.  She underlined that the GoS will be "sensible" in \
its expectations regarding additional information, but needs \
at least to have the basic comprehensive information in order \
to convince the Swiss cantonal (state) officials that the \
matter has been properly vetted.  (Note:  The cantons have \
primary responsibility for migration and social services \
issues, so at least one Swiss canton would have to agree to \
receive a former detainee for any resettlement to occur.  End \
Note)  Weichelt added that complete information also is \
important in Swiss domestic political terms, since the GoS \
needs to be able to convince the Swiss public that such a \
resettlement is not too risky after years of being told that \
Guantanamo detainees are very dangerous. \
 \
¶6. (S) MOJ representative Besson further clarified what \
additional information is needed on the individuals in \
question for the Swiss interagency working group to complete \
its review: \
 \
-- Identifying Data:  at a minimum, fingerprints and photos; \
-- Explanation of Legal Status:  charged or convicted of any \
crimes? \
-- USG Risk Evaluation:  low, medium, or high risk? \
-- Relatives/Family Members Information; \
-- Medical Information; \
 \
¶7. (S) Fried assured Ambuehl that the USG would work on \
providing information in all of these categories, as \
requested.  In light of the June 15 EU/Schengen announcement \
regarding Guantanamo closure and resettlements, Fried added \
that, as the GoS got closer to a decision to resettle a given \
individual, the USG would assist Switzerland's consultations \
with its Schengen partners by providing case information that \
could be shared with them.  Fried reminded Ambuehl and the \
other Swiss officials that the case information provided thus \
far to the GoS is "releasable to Switzerland only," and thus \
is not to be shared with other governments.  Fried offered to \
facilitate a trip by a GoS team to Guantanamo to interview \
the individuals under consideration.  Weichelt said that the \
GoS would first want to review the additional information \
before sending a team to Guantanamo.  Ambuehl said it would \
be very useful if this additional information could be \
provided the week of June 22, adding that he could dispatch a \
team to Guantanamo the following week. \
 \
¶8. (S) Regarding how to respond to media queries regarding \
Fried's visit and discussions, Ambuehl agreed that it was \
fine to acknowledge the fact of the visit, but asked that USG \
officials not go into further details at this point, and \
especially not to mention the fact that the GoS is \
considering Uighurs -- otherwise, per Ambuehl, "I'll have the \
Chinese ambassador standing in my office by the afternoon." \
Fried agreed to this approach. \
