  		<h1>GOE JAILS JOURNALIST CONVICTED OF DEFAMATION REF: A. CAIRO 1231 B. CAIRO 284 C. CAIRO 180 D. 08 CAIRO 2152 E. 08 CAIRO 2122 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor Donald Blome for reason 1.4 (d).1.(C) On July 6 at 11 PM, police arrested independent newspaper editor Yasser Barakat outside his office to implement the six-month prison term handed down against him on June 24. Cairo Criminal Court sentenced Barakat on June 24 to six months in prison and fined him LE 20,000 (3,500 USD) for allegedly defaming MP Mustafa Bakry in a November 2007 article entitled, "Bakry, Sawiris and Syrian Intelligence" (ref A). Barakat is editor-in-chief of the virtually unknown paper "Al-Moagaz," and Bakry who has close ties to MOI State Security Investigative Services (SSIS) is editor-in-chief of the sensationalist weekly tabloid "Al-Osboa." Barakat's lawyers released a statement July 7 urging the Press Syndicate "to take all possible measures" to facilitate his release from prison.</h1>
