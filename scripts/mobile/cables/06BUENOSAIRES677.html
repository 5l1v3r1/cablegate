</p><p>¶1.  (C) Summary:  DCM, accompanied by PolCouns, met on March 
</p><p>20 with Carlos Zannini, the Secretary for Legal and Technical 
</p><p>Affairs in the Casa Rosada.  This was our first face to face 
</p><p>meeting with Zannini since last November's Summit of the 
</p><p>Americas.  Zannini is widely considered to be the 
</p><p>intellectual force within President Nestor Kirchner's inner 
</p><p>circle (see Reftel A for biographic information).  With the 
</p><p>departure of heavyweights such as former Economy Minister 
</p><p>Roberto Lavagna and Foreign Minister Rafael Bielsa and the 
</p><p>recent resignation of Santa Cruz governor Sergio Acevedo, 
</p><p>Zannini is probably second only to Planning Minister Julio De 
</p><p>Vido in shaping political and economic strategy within the 
</p><p>government.  End Summary. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (C) Zannini opened the conversation with a defense of 
</p><p>government economic policy.  He pointed to the reductions in 
</p><p>unemployment and poverty rates and the increase in the 
</p><p>investment rate to 26 percent of GDP as vindication of the 
</p><p>GoA's policies.  Asked about inflation concerns and what he 
</p><p>considered were tolerable levels of inflation, Zannini 
</p><p>responded the government's goal was to keep the inflation 
</p><p>rate to 10 percent.  He defended the use of price controls 
</p><p>and the recent decision to ban the export of beef products 
</p><p>for 180 days as legitimate and effective measures to control 
</p><p>inflation.  He justified these measures by claiming that 
</p><p>markets didn't work freely in Argentina and that ""cartels"" 
</p><p>in, for instance, the meat industry manipulated supply and 
</p><p>demand to affect prices.  The DCM noted that while price 
</p><p>controls may well reduce sector prices in the short term, 
</p><p>continued prudent fiscal and monetary policies were still 
</p><p>required to prevent a sustained inflation spillover as money 
</p><p>supply increased. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (C) Turning to politics, Zannini claimed the abrupt 
</p><p>resignation (Reftel B) of Santa Cruz governor Acevedo had 
</p><p>come as a ""complete surprise"" to the Casa Rosada.  He 
</p><p>acknowledged that Acevedo's ""style"" of handling difficult 
</p><p>issues was perhaps not what Kirchner would have preferred and 
</p><p>that mistakes had clearly been made in the labor dispute in 
</p><p>Las Heras during which a policeman was killed.  But he denied 
</p><p>accusations that Kirchner had forced the resignation of his 
</p><p>former vice governor and confidant and even expressed a 
</p><p>certain amount of disgust that Acevedo had not given the Casa 
</p><p>Rosada advance notice of his intentions.  Comment:  The 
</p><p>timing of Acevedo's resignation may well have taken the Casa 
</p><p>Rosada by surprise.  But the open and well-documented 
</p><p>interference in provincial affairs by Kirchner insiders such 
</p><p>as De Vido and Alicia Kirchner, particularly in the 
</p><p>appropriation of public works monies, had clearly put Acevedo 
</p><p>in an untenable position.  End Comment. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶4.  (C) Moving to presidential politics, Zannini claimed 
</p><p>Kirchner was still undecided about his intentions for 2007. 
</p><p>He said Kirchner was very much aware that there were ""no 
</p><p>popular two-term ex-presidents in Argentina"" and that he was 
</p><p>more concerned with ensuring that the political agenda he had 
</p><p>begun was continued beyond 2007 than he was in seeking 
</p><p>reelection.  He said Kirchner was willing to ""walk away"" in 
</p><p>2007 if he felt that was the best way to preserve his legacy 
</p><p>and policies.  That said, Zannini said Kirchner would easily 
</p><p>win reelection should he decide to run and acknowledged there 
</p><p>was a certain amount of political advantage to be gained from 
</p><p>delaying any official announcement. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶5.  (C) Finally, the DCM took the opportunity to seek 
</p><p>Zannini's support in pushing for legislation in the Argentine 
</p><p>Congress to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. 
</p><p>The legislation, which is required for the implementation of 
</p><p>the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism and the UN 
</p><p>Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 
</p><p>has been stalled in the Congress since last year.  Zannini, 
</p><p>who was well versed on the subject, expressed his support for 
</p><p>the measures and his confidence that the appropriate 
</p><p>legislation would be passed and enacted this year. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶6.  (C) Comment:  With the resignations of Cabinet 
</p><p>heavyweights such as former Economy Minister Lavagna and 
</p><p>Foreign Minister Bielsa who were both willing to disagree 
</p><p>with Kirchner, Zannini has become the principal intellectual 
</p><p>force in the President's shrinking circle of close advisors. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>In terms of overall power to influence both economic and 
</p><p>political policy, Zannini currently is probably second to 
</p><p>none.  End Comment.
