¶1. (C) A Malaysian Ministry of Defense policy official 
informed us on May 26 that a flight transporting 25 Malaysian 
troops and two police officers had been diverted to Bali, 
Indonesia late on May 25, while Australian forces were 
securing the airfield in East Timor.  The official expected 
that these 27 would proceed to East Timor on May 26.  He also 
informed us that 250 more Malaysian troops were on stand-by 
for deployment via air once the 27 troops and police were in 
place.  Per ref A, we expressed U.S. appreciation for 
Malaysian commitments to support East Timor and the 
Australian-led security effort there.  (Note:  Deputy Prime 
Minister Najib Razak, who is also defense minister, told the 
local press May 25 that Malaysia was planning to send a 
combined police and military force of as many as 500 men, 
with the number depending on the situation.  He also said 
Malaysia would be seeking a UN mandate for the deployment. 
End Note.) 
 
¶2. (C) Australian Deputy High Commissioner Peter Doyle told 
us May 26 that the Australian government was "extremely 
pleased" with the scale and pace of Malaysian participation 
in the East Timor security effort, as well as with the level 
of cooperation and coordination between the Malaysian and 
Australian governments in this matter.  Doyle said that 
Malaysian deployments were being coordinated through the 
Malaysian Defense Attache in Canberra.  Operational matters 
would be handled on the ground in East Timor.  Doyle expected 
the advance Malaysian contingent of 27 to arrive in East 
Timor on May 26.  He also understood that two Royal Malaysian 
Navy vessels were proceeding to East Timor, and that either 
225 or 250 additional troops were preparing to be flown into 
East Timor.  (Comment: Malaysia and Australia are partners in 
the Five Power Defense Arrangements (FPDA), a 1971 
cooperative defense arrangement that also includes New 
Zealand, the UK and Singapore.  Regular FPDA and bilateral 
exercises and the longstanding deployment of a small number 
of Australian forces in Butterworth, Malaysia, have built a 
web of strong and compatible defense ties between Kuala 
Lumpur and Canberra that has endured past political 
differences.)
