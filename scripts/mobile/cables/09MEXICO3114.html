¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Mexico is a awash with illegal firearms 
from unknown suppliers that arm organized crime groups and 
fuel escalating violence.  Investigation and prosecution of 
illegal arms dealers is thwarted by in-fighting among Mexican 
institutions and legal restrictions that prevent the sharing 
of important information.  Successful prosecution of illegal 
arms traffickers will depend on U.S. law enforcement agencies 
gaining access to confiscated weapons to form actionable 
intelligence and launch investigations.  End Summary 
 
 
A Recipe for Problems: Too Many Cooks, Too Little Love 
 
¶2.  (C) Currently, government warehouses throughout Mexico 
have approximately 140,000 weapons either confiscated from 
crime scenes or gathered from check points.  Some of these 
weapons -- in storage for over 10 years -- are suspected to 
have little investigative value.  The warehouses are the 
responsibility of the Mexican Army (SEDENA), which maintains 
a piece-meal list of information on at least 64,000 weapons 
collected since the start of the Calderon administration in 
December 2006.  SEDENA's decision to share this information 
with us in July of this year prompted ICE and ATF to review 
the data in an effort to open criminal investigations against 
individuals suspected of knowingly selling weapons to 
individuals linked to drug trafficking organizations (DTOs). 
DIA analysts initiated a separate effort to identify the 
origin of the weapons as well as trafficking patterns. 
Unfortunately, the information is incomplete and lacks source 
data, a reflection of the inconsistent and uneven collection 
methods employed by Mexican Federal Police (SSP), Mexican 
Attorney General (PGR), and SEDENA officials in their 
investigation of confiscated weapons. (Septel analyzes 
efforts to systematically collect and share weapons forensic 
information.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) PGR assumes legal authority for confiscated weapons 
stored in warehouses that correspond to Mexican criminal 
investigations.  Once the PGR completes its initial 
investigation, it turns over the actual weapon and all 
information it has gathered over to the Mexican judiciary, 
which retains jurisdiction over the weapon over the course of 
judicial proceedings.  Upon termination of all investigative 
and judicial proceedings,  SEDENA is assigned responsibility 
for disposition or destruction of the weapons -- a process 
that could take years. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Besides the sheer magnitude of the weapons 
collected, the GOM's disjointed approach for managing the 
weapons it stores in its warehouses has fostered an ad-hoc 
system with many accountability gaps.  On frequent occasions, 
GOM agencies -- with their conflicting priorities and 
competing responsibilities -- openly dispute who has the lead 
on key arms investigations.  PGR holds tightly to its 
authority as the prosecutorial, investigative, and forensic 
arm of the GOM; while the SSP retains its position as the 
lead federal law enforcement agency, an investigative role 
recently expanded in new legislation.  Both agencies have the 
authority to conduct crime scene investigation and collect 
forensic evidence, yet information sharing across 
bureaucratic lines is virtually nonexistent.  SSP generally 
agrees to share information on cases only when the case is 
transferred to the prosecutor (PGR). 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  U.S. law enforcement agencies have a strong 
interest in obtaining information from weapon seizures as 
this information forms the basis of intelligence, follow-on 
domestic investigations, and potential prosecutions.  A 
February 2009 Mexican Supreme Court ruling, however, 
restricts any access to weapons that are involved in court 
cases.  The USG has had limited success obtaining access to 
warehouses and weapons, with the exception of some high-level 
visits, affording rare opportunities to get a look inside the 
warehouses.   Even though the GOM provided information on 
64,000 confiscated arms, the incomplete information needs to 
be verified and experts need access to the actual weapons to 
obtain additional evidence -- source data, obliteration data 
and pictures -- to provide the basis for investigations and 
subsequent U.S. judicial cases.  SEDENA insists it is willing 
to grant U.S. law enforcement agencies access to confiscated

weapons and blames PGR for any denials.  In mid-August, 
SEDENA reviewed with us twelve instances in which its 
approval of our official requests for access were overturned 
by the PGR, based on the February 2009 Supreme Court case. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment.  Claims by Mexican and U.S. officials that 
upwards of 90 percent of illegal recovered weapons can be 
traced back to the U.S. is based on an incomplete survey of 
confiscated weapons.  In point of fact, without wider access 
to the weapons seized in Mexico, we really have no way of 
verifying these numbers.  Joint efforts to develop 
intelligence that can serve the impetus for investigations 
and prosecutions of individuals or companies that market 
firearms to the cartels, will require Mexican and USG law 
enforcement agencies to share essential crime scene forensic 
information on a real time basis.  Post law enforcement 
agencies will continue to work closely with their Mexican 
counterparts to break down institutional divisions and 
facilitate more information sharing on arms trafficking cases 
both among the Mexican agencies and with U.S. partners.  End
