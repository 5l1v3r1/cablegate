</p><p>------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶1. (C) Minister of Defense (MOD) Gabriel Silva Lujan countermanded 
a transfer order from the army commander that would have sent the 
reform-minded army inspector general to the defense attache post in 
Chile -- and to an early retirement.  Instead, Army Inspector 
General (IG) Major General Carlos Suarez, will be promoted to IG 
over all of Colombia's armed forces.  Silva's move countered Army 
Commander Oscar Gonzalez Pena's obvious effort to frustrate the 
IG's investigations into "false positives" -- military murders 
presented as combat kills -- and is a positive indication that the 
new MOD is willing to continue human rights reform.  Despite a 
significant drop in "false positive" murders, Suarez expressed 
concern that the practice could once again become common, as many 
high-level commanders who had directly or tacitly supported it 
remained in high-level command positions in the military.  End 
Summary.
</p><p></p><p></p><p>MOD OVERRULES ARMY COMMANDER, PROMOTES IG 
</p><p>----------------------------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶2. (C) Following a conversation on November 6 in which the 
Ambassador expressed the USG's strong reservations over the 
transfer of IG Suarez, MOD Silva told the Ambassador on November 12 
that he had countermanded Army Commander Oscar Gonzalez Pena's 
order to transfer to Chile Army Inspector General Carlos Suarez, 
the official who investigated the Soacha extrajudicial executions 
(EJEs) that led to the dismissal of 51 members of the Colombian 
Army.  Instead, Silva promoted Suarez to serve as IG of the Armed 
Forces, reporting directly to him.  (Note:  The position normally 
reports to Chief of Defense Freddy Padilla.  It was unclear whether 
the MOD intended to change the line of command, though as IG of the 
Armed Forces Suarez would have more regular access to Silva.  End 
note.)  Gonzalez Pena had ordered the IG to transfer effective 
November 9 to a four-month special project prior to becoming 
militaryattache to Chile in March 2010.  Silva said he was pleased 
with Suarez' work as IG, and that he intended to give him carte 
blanche to be aggressive with the Armed Forces on human rights 
issues.  Suarez expressed satisfaction over his promotion and his 
ability to continue to address military crimes. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>ARMY COMMANDER LIMITS DISMISSALS, 
</p><p>MILITARY JUSTICE "FROZEN" 
</p><p>------------------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶3. (C) In a meeting with Polcouns on November 6, Suarez attributed 
the surprise transfer to Gonzalez Pena's ongoing efforts to 
"paralyze" the IG's approximately 150 investigations into EJEs (REF 
A).  Suarez said Gonzalez Pena had blocked approximately 30 
administrative dismissals through his influence on the two other 
officers who vote on Suarez' recommendations, Deputy Army Commander 
General Jorge Octavio Ardila and Army Human Resources Head General 
Javier Fernandez Leal.  Suarez voiced doubts that Gonzalez Pena's 
pick to replace him as Army IG, General Luis Felipe ParedesCadena, 
would demonstrate independence to promote "false positive" 
investigations.  Suarez also questioned the military justice 
system's ability to act autonomously in the current environment. 
Even though the military judges are ostensibly independent, Suarez 
</p><p></p><p>said, the system is currently "frozen" and human rights cases are 
not being transferred to the ordinary justice system. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>FALSE POSITIVES DOWN, 
</p><p>BUT COULD RECUR 
</p><p>--------------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶4. (C) Suarez confirmed a major drop in "false positive" crimes, 
noting his office had only received nine such allegations -- all 
but two deemed credible -- in 2009.  Still, Suarez underscored the 
risk of backsliding, given the fact that a number of commanders who 
had allowed the practice to go on remain in place.  In this group 
he included Gonzalez Pena, Ardila, Fernandez, and Army Human Rights 
Directorate Head General Jorge Rodriguez, who Suarez labeled as 
"counter-reform" (REF B).  Without significant personnel changes, 
warned Suarez, there could be no institutional change. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>COMMENT 
</p><p>------- 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>¶5. (C) While technically General Gonzalez Pena has gotten away with 
transferring an aggressive pro-reform officer out of the number 
three slot in the Army, we believe Suarez will successfully carry 
on his work at a higher level.  We doubt that Gonzalez Pena will 
advance on human rights reform in the Army without consistent 
pressure from MOD Silva and President Uribe.
