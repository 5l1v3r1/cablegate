¶1.  (SBU)  Meeting held on November 11, 2005, 11:00, at the \
Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Manama, Bahrain \
 \
¶2.  (SBU) Participants: \
 \
U.S. \
A/S Fried \
Blake Thorkleson, NEA/MEPI \
Leslie Tsou (TDY Notetaker) \
 \
Switzerland \
State Secretary Michael Ambuehl \
Guillaume Scheurer, MFA Minister Counselor \
 \
¶3.  (C) Summary.  On the margins of the Forum for the Future \
Senior Officials Meeting November 11 in Bahrain, Swiss State \
Secretary Michael Ambuehl told Assistant Secretary for \
 \
SIPDIS \
European Affairs Dan Fried that Switzerland wants to \
strengthen and deepen relations with the U.S., not only \
bilaterally but internationally and multilaterally as well. \
A/S Fried accepted Ambuehl,s suggestion that the U.S. and \
Switzerland conclude a Joint Statement laying out the ways in \
which the two countries can cooperate, especially in the \
international arena.  Ambuehl affirmed that Switzerland is \
looking to redefine its traditional concept of neutrality to \
play a more active international role in the 21st century; \
Switzerland,s long federalist history, for example, would \
make it an ideal advisor to the Iraqi government as Iraq,s \
own federalist system develops.  End summary. \

Strengthening U.S.-Swiss Ties \
----------------------------- \
 \
¶4.  (C) Switzerland wants to strengthen its relations with \
the U.S., Ambuehl told A/S Fried.  Noting how much the two \
governments have in common in almost every sector, from \
political and economic affairs to security and the global war \
on terrorism, Ambuehl urged broader cooperation on the \
bilateral, international, and multilateral levels. \
 \
¶5.  (C) Ambuehl suggested that the U.S. and Switzerland sign \
a Joint Statement that would show a visible strengthening of \
cooperation across the board.  A/S Fried agreed, urging that \
the statement focus on what the U.S. and Switzerland can do \
around the world to support freedom and common values.  He \
noted EUR/AGS Director Dan Weygandt will be in Switzerland \
for meetings starting November 14, and will be empowered to \
discuss how such a statement would take shape. \
 \
------------------------ \
New Role for Switzerland \
------------------------ \
 \
¶6.  (C) Ambuehl agreed that Switzerland is seeking to \
redefine its traditional neutrality to fit 21st century \
realities and find ways where it can play a positive \
international role.  For example, Switzerland has a long \
history of federalism that might lend itself well to advising \
the Iraqis as their federalist system develops.  A/S Fried \
welcomed this idea.  He pointed out the relevance of \
Partnership for Peace member Switzerland,s tradition of \
humanitarian assistance given the increasing expansion of \
NATO,s humanitarian role, as demonstrated by its assistance \
to Pakistan after the earthquake.  A/S Fried noted that the \
U.S. had supported Switzerland's participation in the \
U.S.-European Ministerial Lunch in New York last September at \
the UNGA and the Dinner planned for December in Brussels. \
 \
------------------------------------------- \
Forum for the Future/Magen David Adom Issue \
------------------------------------------- \
 \
¶8.  (C) A/S Fried thanked Switzerland for its financial \
contribution to the Forum for the Future, and congratulated \
the Swiss government on the December 5-6 diplomatic \
conference that aims to resolve the Magen David Adom issue. \
Ambuehl asked that language be inserted into the Chairman,s \
Statement that he said would help Switzerland resolve the \
issue (in the end, the language was offered too late to be \
included in the Chairman's Statement). \
 \
¶9.  (U) This message has been cleared by A/S Fried. \
