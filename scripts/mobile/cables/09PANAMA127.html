SOUTHCOM Assistance 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)   First VP and FM Samuel Lewis met with the 
Ambassador on February 4 to discuss the situation in the 
Darien and the Ambassador's recent meetings at SOUTHCOM in 
response to Lewis' December 12 request for USG planning 
assistance for Darien operations. The Ambassador told Lewis 
that SOUTHCOM was prepared to send an assessment team of four 
to six officers to Panama to evaluate the situation in the 
Darien, the GOP's requirements, and recommend whether 
SOUTHCOM can assist within its existing authorization to 
train, equip and advise Panamanian forces in non-lethal 
operations, and what other authorizations it might need to 
provide help. Lewis thanked the Ambassador, and said that 
National Security Advisor Marcel Salamin and National 
Frontier Service (SENAFRONT) Director Frank Abrego would be 
the points of contact for the team, expected in arrive in 
mid-March. 
 
---------------------------- 
Whole of Government Approach 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  The Ambassador told Lewis that SOUTHCOM had 
shared lessons learned from the successful Colombian effort 
against the FARC. These lessons highlighted the importance of 
addressing the problem of "under-governed" spaces, where 
irregular groups are able to build up local support 
structures in the absence of a strong host nation government 
presence.  The best way to address under-governed spaces was 
through a "whole of government" approach to reducing the 
influence of irregular groups in such areas. In the case of 
Panama, that meant that SENAFRONT could only be one element 
of a strategy to drive out the irregulars. An increasing and 
sustained presence by education, health, economic development 
and other governmental agencies, in addition to law 
enforcement, would also be required. The Ambassador noted 
that the Embassy could bring some resources to support such a 
strategy, such as elements of the Merida Initiative, some 
SOUTHCOM funded programs such as Humanitarian Assistance 
Programs, and medical readiness training exercises, and that 
we were attempting to secure other resources to directly 
support such a strategy. She said the assessment team would 
also look at how SOUTHCOM might be able to assist with 
planning such a strategy, taking advantage of the experience 
gained in Colombia. Lewis concurred with the need to approach 
the problem as one of governance, and noted that the GOP had 
just approved funding to expand the runway in Meteti to ease 
access to the Darien. He also reviewed a variety of air 
assets - a mix of helicopters and small planes - that will be 
coming on line starting late February, adding that the 
government of Colombia had in the end not agreed to lease 
Panama helicopters. 
 
--------------- 
Legal Framework 
--------------- 
 
¶3.  (S//NF)  The Ambassador, carrying a copy of the Geneva 
Convention, noted that the visit to SOUTHCOM had also helped 
clarify the legal framework for any future operations against 
the FARC elements in the Darien.  She explained to Lewis that 
in Colombia the conditions were met for using the law of 
armed conflict (e.g., control of territory, ranks, uniforms) 
which allowed, under some circumstances, for the Colombian 
military to act against the FARC using military means and 
tactics, rather than police means and tactics. In Panama, the 
Ambassador explained, where these conditions are not met, 
operations properly fall under law enforcement rules of 
engagement. She told Lewis that any recommendations from the 
SOUTHCOM assessment team would, of course, be consistent with 
international law. Lewis told the Ambassador that he fully 
understood and agreed with this evaluation.
