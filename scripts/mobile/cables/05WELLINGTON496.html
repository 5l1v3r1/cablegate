<br></pre></p></div><p>FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On June 21, Charge delivered ref A, B and C 
demarche points to Wen Chin Powles and Valerie Meyer, both 
Deputy Directors at the United Nations, Human Rights and 
Commonwealth Division (UNHC) of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  Powles and Meyer said that the 
GoNZ's positions on reform of the UN and the Commission on 
Human Rights are largely synchronized with the U.S. positions 
though the U.S. is further along in fleshing out its 
positions.  MFAT also subsequently sent a copy of its recent 
statement to the June 21 Informal Meeting in advance of the 
General Assembly September High-level plenary.  The text of 
the statement is attached at para 8. 
 
New Zealand aims generally support U.S. interests 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶2.    (SBU) According to Powles and Meyer, the GoNZ generally 
supports our UN reform interests including those of the 
Peacebuilding Commission, the responsibility to protect 
(where New Zealand will push for the strongest possible 
language including the override of sovereignty in cases of 
genocide, ethnic cleansing and similar), counterterrorism, 
developmental reform, and secretariat reform.  New Zealand 
seeks strengthening of disarmament and nonproliferation 
provisions. 
 
¶3.    (C) On Security Council reform, New Zealand will oppose 
any expansion of the veto power, in keeping with New 
Zealand's consistant stance against UNSC vetoes since the UN 
was founded.  And while supportive of a Japanese role on the 
Security Council, New Zealand is "not certain about a 
permanent seat for Japan," said Powles.  Viewing that 
Security Council reform is overwhelming the U.N., Powles 
commented that New Zealand "doesn't want (reform) to be 
polarizing and dominating."  New Zealand has been asked about 
its position on Security Council reform by the governments of 
Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, 
she added. 
 
But there are some areas of difference 
-------------------------------------- 
¶4.    (C) Regarding the proposed Human Rights Council, the 
GoNZ shares the USG view that a smaller body is needed for 
greater effectiveness, and in fact sees a still smaller 
membership than the 20 members we proposed, Meyer said.  She 
acknowledged, however, that few countries share this desire 
for a still smaller membership.  GoNZ shares our concerns 
that a peer review process might bog the Council down to the 
detriment of its primary mission.  However, Myer implied that 
the GoNZ is open to the notion of peer review, even as it 
would need to see more discussion on the idea.  The GoNZ 
seeks more equal status of the Council vis-a-vis the Security 
Council and ECOSOC, and sees the Council as a "principal 
organ of the United Nations" consistent with the "Three 
Pillar" arrangement promoted by the Secretary General. 
However, while indicating that the Council should have the 
authority to investigate, censure and make recommendations, 
Meyer said that sanctions and other enforcement mechanisms 
should come from UNSC. 
Meyer further said that the GoNZ is "supportive of keeping 
the good things of the HRC, including the role of NGOs." 
Finally, Meyer indicated New Zealand's supports a regular 
source of budget funding as opposed to a system dependent on 
voluntary contributions. 
 
¶5.    (SBU) On the Peace Building Commission (PBC), Powles 
reported general consensus; however she noted possible 
differences on how the PBC would fit into the UN framework 
and it membership characteristics.  She did acknowledge that 
these differences might result more from a lack of detail on 
the PBC rather than on our diverging views.  New Zealand 
favors early establishment of a Peace Building Commission, 
with Powles suggesting that NZ has a more ambitious timeline 
than the U.S. 
 
¶6.    (SBU) Climate change will continue to be a focus area 
for New Zealand during the UN reform initiative.  As 
indicated by Powles, the GoNZ used a June 21st statement to 
an informal meeting plenary to promote a strong position on 
climate change, one which supports the UN Secretary's General 
position.  However, as she had indicated, their statement 
(para 8) did not provide much detail. 
 
¶7.    (SBU) After the recent failure of the May 
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference to reach 
consensus, New Zealand is looking to see disarmament and 
non-proliferation language strengthened, Powles said. 
However, similar to climate change, their statement (para 8) 
did not provide much detail. 
 
Text of New Zealand's Statement 
------------------------------- 
¶8.  (U) Begin Text:  Mr President 
The High Level Event in September will be a unique 
opportunity to reinvigorate the United Nations.  Member 
States have a wide range of national, regional and 
international interests.  But we believe that we all share a 
fundamental interest in ensuring that the United Nations is 
able effectively to meet the challenges of the twenty-first 
century. 
 
When our Leaders gather here in less than three months time 
they will want to take decisions that will substantially 
strengthen the UN.  The draft contains many sound 
recommendations and we thank you for your careful work in 
drawing it together.  We see it as a solid platform and we 
welcome the positive momentum it is generating.  There are, 
however, several areas of priority importance to New Zealand 
where we would like to suggest bolder language, more 
definition of concepts and clearer signposts to follow up 
action. 
 
Mr President 
 
We agree that development is a central goal in itself - as 
well as vital for achieving collective security.  We are 
pleased to see that the draft is imbued with the "Spirit of 
Monterrey", underlining the need to mobilise all resources 
for development including aid, trade and domestic resources. 
New Zealand supports the positive references to the need to 
progress the Doha Development Round. 
 
Along with increasing volumes of aid, it is important to 
ensure that aid delivery is effective from developing 
countries' points of view:  New Zealand strongly supports the 
emphasis on aid effectiveness present in the document. 
 
The draft outcome document rightly emphasises the importance 
of dealing with climate change.  A constructive international 
dialogue is urgently needed on how to take meaningful action 
on climate change, and at the same time provide for future 
economic growth and development aspirations.  As the 
Secretary-General has said, we must develop a more inclusive 
 
SIPDIS 
international framework beyond 2012.  Anything less than 
broad and balanced participation and action, in particular by 
all of the world's major emitters, including both developed 
and developing countries, will be inadequate to deal with a 
challenge of this magnitude. 
 
We are particularly pleased to see that the draft outcome 
document recognises the plight of countries in special 
situations, particularly small island developing states.  We 
hope that the Summit will add impetus for the implementation 
of the Mauritius Strategy for SIDS. 
 
We can support many of the elements of the draft outcome 
document on disarmament and non-proliferation but would like 
to see a number of them strengthened to better address the 
security challenges in today's world.  Our strong wish is for 
our leaders to agree on concrete steps towards elimination of 
weapons of mass destruction, as well as measures to prevent 
their proliferation.  The 2000 NPT outcome identified steps 
that should be taken towards achieving nuclear disarmament. 
Against that background we cannot support the implication 
that progress on nuclear disarmament might be held hostage to 
"general and complete disarmament", as suggested by the 
current draft text. 
 
New Zealand welcomes the proposals to strengthen the United 
Nations' human rights machinery, but in our view they do not 
go far enough to establish the protection and promotion of 
human rights.  It remains our view that the proposed Human 
Rights Council should be a principal organ of the UN.  This 
would reflect the primacy of human rights in the Charter and 
give the new body maximum authority in responding to emerging 
or critical human rights situations.  The Council should be a 
smaller body than the current Commission on Human Rights in 
order to expedite decision-making and facilitate consensus on 
action.  We are concerned by the omission from the current 
draft of the Secretary-General's stricture that those elected 
to the Council should undertake to abide by the highest human 
rights standards. 
 
We would also want the outcome document to provide more 
clarity on the functions, mandate and powers of the Council, 
and its functional relationship with other organs of the UN 
system.  The Council should be able to investigate, censure 
and make recommendations on further action to the Security 
Council and the proposed Peacebuilding Commission.  The 
Council's relationship with the General Assembly's Third 
Committee needs to be clarified in order to avoid overlapping 
functions and mandates.  We are interested in the proposed 
peer review mechanism but would like to see further developed 
how it would work in practice. 
 
Strengthening the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and providing it with the requisite funds from the 
regular budget of the UN must be a priority.  We would also 
like to see a more explicit reaffirmation in the outcome 
document of the policy of mainstreaming human rights 
throughout the UN system and an enhanced role for the High 
Commissioner in relation to the Security Council and the 
proposed Peacebuilding Commission. 
 
Mr President 
 
We are pleased that the proposal for the Peacebuilding 
Commission has broad and increasing support.  New Zealand 
fully supports the role and mandate of the PBC as broadly 
described in the current draft.  It reflects well what is 
required to fill the institutional gap.  However, we believe 
the draft can and should go further.   It is within our reach 
to agree on the structure of the PBC so that Leaders can 
formally establish it in September. 
 
On details, we would make three points.  First, on size, we 
believe the optimal number for core membership would be no 
more than 20, with balanced participation from both the 
Security Council and ECOSOC (say, five from each) plus 
representation by key donors, Troop Contributing Countries, 
regional partners and International Financial Institutions on 
the basis proposed in the Secretary-General's explanatory 
note.  We also support the Secretary-General's recommendation 
that national authorities and relevant regional actors should 
be involved in the Peacebuilding Commission's 
country-specific sub-groups and would like to see this 
reflected in the outcome document. 
 
Second, on mandate, we fully support the proposal that Member 
States should be able to apply to the PBC and the Standing 
Fund for assistance in reducing the risk of either new or 
recurring conflict. 
 
Thirdly, given the advisory nature of the PBC, we query the 
need for sequential reporting.  In our view, the strength of 
the PBC should be its ability to coordinate and provide 
transition.  To do this, it should have the flexibility to 
report to either the Security Council or ECOSOC, and to the 
GA and the HR Council according to need. 
 
We support the establishment of a Standing Fund allowing UN 
agencies to fill the funding gap immediately after conflict 
ends and before bilateral assistance arrives.  We also fully 
support the Secretary-General's proposal to establish a small 
Peacebuilding Support Office. 
 
As the Secretary-General says, terrorism is a threat to all 
that the United Nations stands for.  We support his proposal 
to implement a UN counter-terrorism strategy.  This strategy 
must be comprehensive, taking into account the underlying 
factors which fuel and generate support for terrorism.  We 
support the call to conclude a comprehensive convention on 
terrorism during the 60th session of the GA. 
 
Mr President 
 
We welcome the draft language on responsibility to protect. 
We agree that the primary responsibility to protect civilians 
lies with individual Member States.  However, where States 
are unable or unwilling to protect their population from 
genocide, large scale violations of international 
humanitarian law or ethnic cleansing, we believe strongly 
that the international community has the responsibility to 
take collective action.  We would emphasise that this 
responsibility is about protecting civilians within the 
parameters of international law, and specifically within the 
provisions of the UN Charter. 
 
We look forward to Leaders in September fully embracing the 
responsibility to protect and would support language in the 
Leaders' declaration making clear the elements comprising the 
responsibility to protect. 
 
Mr President 
 
For a fully effective Secretariat we must urgently strengthen 
the Secretary-General's ability to manage resources flexibly, 
and ensure that the Organisation can attract the highest 
calibre of staff.  We are pleased to see the management 
reform measures that are being put in place.  Leaders should 
agree to provide the Secretary-General with the necessary 
flexibility and authority to carry out his responsibilities, 
whilst requiring a full system of accountability, integrity 
and transparency. 
 
We fully endorse the urgent need to review mandates that are 
older than five years and identify resources for shifting to 
other priorities.  We should not shy away from the 
possibility that some activities have outlived their 
usefulness, or could be delivered in a different way. 
 
There is scope for this part of the draft to map out a 
clearer agenda for ongoing updating of mandates, and of 
management practices, and to better distinguish between 
action that is already under way and what now needs to 
happen.  Without repeating them, I would nevertheless like to 
associate New Zealand with the points on management reform 
made by Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the United 
Kingdom.  I also echo the point just made by Norway on the 
need for progress on gender balance in the UN system. 
 
Mr President 
 
We strongly support the draft language on concluding 
negotiations on a protocol expanding legal protection for UN 
and associated personnel during UNGA60.  Attacks against 
personnel continue and New Zealand looks forward to early 
agreement on this issue.  Discussions on the scope of the 
Protocol have brought us to a point where conclusion of a new 
legal instrument, which materially broadens the Protocol, is 
within reach. 
 
Finally Mr President 
 
New Zealand has been a loyal advocate and supporter of the 
United Nations since 1945.  We sincerely want to see the 
organisation emerge in better shape from the current 
initiative.  We are ready and willing to play our part in the 
work that still lies ahead.  End Text
