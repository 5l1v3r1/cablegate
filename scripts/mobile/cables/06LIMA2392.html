in the 6/4 presidential election here is the potential for 
strategic cooperation between Peru and Colombia on issues 
such as counternarcotics, anti-terrorism, and regional 
economic development, and the opportunity this provides to 
the USG to coordinate relevant initiatives with both 
countries.  Given the history of Garcia's APRA Party, 
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe will be holding some 
important high cards in the relationship with the incoming 
Peruvian administration.
</p><p>¶2. (U) Colombia has over the years done several 
much-appreciated and well-remembered good turns for APRA. 
Beginning in January 1949, APRA's founder Victor Raul Haya de 
la Torre spent five years of political asylum inside the 
Colombian Embassy in Lima, during which time the Colombians 
went to bat for Haya by defending his rights in a protracted 
legal proceeding before the International Court of Justice. 
After a contradictory ruling by the Court on Haya's
eligibility for asylum, the GOC negotiated an agreement with 
Peru which allowed Haya to be symbolically turned over to the 
Peruvian Minister of Justice, but then be banished from the 
country and put on a plane to Mexico within an hour. 
</p><p>¶3. (SBU) When Alan Garcia left office unpopular and 
discredited at the end of his first term in 1990, the 
Colombian Government made an important gesture by giving him 
one of Colombia's highest awards in a highly public ceremony 
in Bogota.  Like Haya de la Torre before him, Garcia also 
enjoyed Colombian hospitality for a time after former 
President Fujimori attempted to arrest him as a consequence 
of the auto-coup of 1992.  After escaping over roof-tops, 
Garcia eventually made his way to safety in Colombia, and 
finally from there to France. In sum, Colombia has been a 
constant friend to APRA when it was down, and Ambassador 
Struble has heard APRA party stalwarts comment that they 
think it fitting and proper for President Uribe to collect on 
the debt that Colombia is owed. 
</p><p>¶4. (C) COMMENT:  Peru has been Colombia's most reliable 
friend in South America during the Toledo Administration.  We 
expect this to continue to be the case.  It is also likely to 
be the case that this cooperation will be managed in 
intel-to-intel, mil-to-mil and President-to-President 
channels, rather than between the Foreign Ministries.  Our 
view is that the Colombians have staffed their Embassy in 
Lima with individuals who received an overseas posting as a 
reward for political support for Uribe -- the Colombian 
Mission here is more oriented towards the social dimensions 
of diplomacy rather than advocacy or building 
government-to-government ties.
