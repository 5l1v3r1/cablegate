¶1. (SBU) Because of their long-held interest in climate 
change and related issues, and their keen interest in 
launching this dialogue during their Presidency to find areas 
of common ground for the US and EU, the Finns asserted 
themselves with the Commission in a manner we have not seen 
on other issues. They worked behind the scenes with the 
Commission to develop a compromise agenda that moves past the 
sterile debate on targets and timetables to a more useful 
discussion of practical steps the U.S. and EU can take 
together. Finnish officials, including the Minister of 
Environment, have stated that they view the HLD as one of the 
most important events of their Presidency. 
 
¶2. (C) The HLD will be co-chaired by Finnish Minister of 
Environment Jan-Erik.Enestam and Finnish Minster of Trade and 
Industry Mauri Pekkarinen. The contrast between the two could 
not be more striking. Enestam is a popular and personable 
politician who considers himself a close friend of the U.S. 
and a strong supporter of the transatlantic relationship. He 
has announced that he is leaving the government at the end of 
the Finnish EU Presidency. He therefore has a personal 
interest in making the HLD a success. A former Defense 
Minister, Enestam is dynamic and charismatic, with a firm 
command of English. He is likely to be the natural lead on 
the Finnish side. 
 
¶3. (C) By contrast, Pekkarinen is a somber leader who 
oversees a diverse collection of issues, including energy and 
energy security, at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. A 
strong advocate of biofuels and developing energy 
technologies, Pekkarinen envisions a "constructive meeting" 
that addresses both energy security and climate change. 
Although Pekkarinen is highly competent, his lack of charisma 
may explain the Finns' initial reluctance to provide 
Pekkarinen a co-chair role, rather than an effort to avoid an 
energy discussion. 
 
¶4. (C) Unlike some in the EU and the Commission, the Finns 
understand and agree with our approach to finding concrete 
tools to maximize the synergies between the promotion of 
energy security, sustainable energy supply, innovation and 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. During preparation for 
the HLD, officials in both the Finnish Environment and Trade 
and Industry Ministries have highlighted the strong link 
between climate and energy issues. Nonetheless, as Elina 
Kalkku, MFA Director General for the Americas and Asia, has 
noted, it has been &quite an innovation8 to gather Finnish 
and EU energy and environment officials together, an 
innovation Finland hopes will be one lasting legacy of its EU 
Presidency.
