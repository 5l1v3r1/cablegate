  		<h1>AFRICA: NEW AFRICA MINISTER FOCUS ON TRADITIONAL UK PRIORITIES, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND EU ENGAGEMENT  Classified By: DCM Richard LeBaron, reasons 1.4 (b/d).  1. (C/NF) Summary.  Newly appointed Foreign Office Africa Minister Baroness Glenys Kinnock told the DCM December 4 that she will focus on the UK's traditional priorities in Africa - including Zimbabwe, Sudan, the Great Lakes/DRC, Somalia, Nigeria, and South Africa - as well as climate change and the UK's engagement with the EU on Africa.  She described her general approach to Africa as working together with African governments and civil society by providing the necessary resources to enable Africans to implement their own solutions, as imposed solutions have not worked in the past. She said the UK's influence and collaboration within the EU is a multiplier for the UK's Africa policies, as the voice of the entire EU carries more weight than the UK alone.  She assessed that implementation of the EU's Lisbon Treaty will give European Commission diplomatic missions on the continent more influence and increase member states' cooperation through the creation of the High Representative of Foreign Affairs position and External Action Service as the authoritative voice on Europe's foreign policy.  Kinnock suggested this would make it easier for the USG to engage the EU on Africa policy.  Kinnock said she is also focused on the "shared responsibility" of addressing climate change, especially because many African countries will receive the worst effects of rising global temperatures.
