 ¶1. (U) Charge' raised US concerns over possible European 
withdrawal from KFOR during a March 19 meeting with MFA DG 
for Americas/Asia Kalkku (REF).  Although Kalkuu does not 
have 
direct responsibility for the issue, she is a European 
Political-Military expert with considerable recent 
experience in Balkan matters, including KFOR. 
 
¶2.  (C) According to Kalkku, Finland did not intend to 
withdraw from KFOR.  In fact, it was likely to extend its 
leadership of the Multi-National Brigade Central (MNB-C) 
for another year.  It did intend, however, to reduce its 
current KFOR commitment by approximately half, with 
withdrawals taking place gradually throughout 
this year.  Charge reiterated that the US hoped that 
Finland would make any decision on future force levels with 
Kosovo,s security and political stability in mind. 
 
¶3. (C) In a meeting on March 20, Timo Kantola, Director 
of the MFA,s Unit for Security Policy, told PolChief that in 
assuming the leadership of MNB-C the GOF had increased its 
contingent from 400 to approximately 450.  With no nation 
volunteering to take over MNB-C leadership from Finland in 
August, last December the GOF took the decision to continue 
its leadership role for an indefinite period.  They also 
decided to decrease their contingent by approximately 200. 
Kantola said the Finns have heard no criticism of their 
decision to decrease in Kosovo, though he acknowledged some 
criticism within EU circles regarding their decision to 
withdraw most of their fifty-odd soldiers from Bosnia this 
June.  Kantola was vague about what Finland might do, as 
it frees approximately 250 of the 1000 slots designated for 
overseas operations.  He pointed to the GOF,s decision to 
increase in Chad, and the decision to add an additional 20 
military trainers in Afghanistan.
