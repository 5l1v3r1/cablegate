<br>WITH FOREIGN MINISTER
<br>
<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>¶1. (S) Summary and introduction: Bahrain's strong ties with
the U.S. are the key to the country's security, and it has
long been a solid military and diplomatic partner. The
Bahraini leadership is enthusiastic about the Obama
administration's early engagement in Israeli-Palestinian
peace efforts. Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmad Al Khalifa
will be eager to throw Bahrain's (admittedly modest) weight
behind your priorities in order to get off on the right foot
with the new administration. He will also provide you with
insight into intra-Arab maneuverings on Gaza relief, and on
the region's dealings with Iran. Shaikh Khalid participated
in your meeting with King Hamad in Sharm March 2. End
summary and introduction.
</p><p>¶2. (C) Iran: Shaikh Khalid recently visited Tehran, where
he publicly accepted a semi-apology for an Iranian official's
remarks about old claims to Bahrain. In private, the GOB is
alarmed by Iran's nuclear program and what it views as
Tehran's growing influence in the region. Shaikh Khalid will
welcomes the prospect of U.S. engagement with Tehran, but
will request that GCC governments be kept in the loop if any
U.S.-Iran dialogue on regional security develops.
Resource-poor Bahrain is continuing slow-motion negotiations,
underway for several years, for the potential purchase of
Iranian natural gas if no other suppliers can be found.
</p><p>¶3. (C) Gaza relief: King Hamad ordered that all Bahraini
private and government donations for Gaza be funneled through
a royal commission, in order to prevent direct funding to
Hamas. Bahrain pledged USD 23 million at Sharm, but has not
yet clearly explained to us what mechanisms it will use to
ensure that its aid does not indirectly strengthen Hamas.
Bahrain will likely follow the Saudis' lead on this question,
as on many others.
</p><p>¶4. (SBU) Human Rights: Shaikh Khalid will meet with Sen.
Isakson's office to address concerns there that dissident
Shia are being mistreated. Bahraini authorities have
detained about 30 Shia in connection with an alleged bomb
plot uncovered in December. The GOB has not yet made public
all its evidence, but the authorities claim some of the
accused trained at a camp in Syria. Among those awaiting
trial are two leaders of the radical Haq movement, which
asserts that Bahrain's constitution is illegitimate, and
urges Shia to boycott parliament. Most of Bahrain's Shia
majority reject Haq and support the moderate Wifaq party,
which presses for redress of Shia grievances through
non-violent protest and electoral politics.
</p><p>¶5. (S) Guantanamo detainees: All Bahraini detainees are
back home, and Bahraini authorities, helped by the
ex-detainees' family networks, are ensuring they stay away
from politics. The GOB is still considering our recent
requests that Bahrain now take Tunisian and Syrian detainees.
The Bahrainis worry that foreign ex-detainees would be hard
to control, and might rally local Sunni extremists.
Ambassador Williamson will visit Manama March 18-20 to press
this issue.
</p><p>¶6. (C) Afghanistan police: King Hamad told you in Sharm
that Bahrain wanted to send police to help in Afghanistan.
The Interior Ministry here says it has in mind sending about
30 policemen to serve as guards for a coalition facility.
Embassy Kabul and the U.S. military are studying the offer;
it might be too small to justify the support costs.
</p><p>¶7. (C) Anti-piracy: The King also told you at Sharm that
Bahrain could send its sole frigate to help coalition efforts
off Somalia. We have thanked the Bahrainis and told them we
are considering the offer; however, we think the frigate
might need $20-30 million worth of refurbishment first.
Bahrain would have trouble footing this bill, and U.S.
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Bahrain this year was
only $3.9 million.
</p><p>¶8. (C) Israel: Bahrain has no official ties with Israel,
but Shaikh Khalid has had meetings and frequent phone contact
with Tzipi Livni. Bahrain's Israel boycott office was closed
in 2006 as required by the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement.
During the Gaza conflict some in parliament pushed for a
resumption of the boycott, but the GOB has ignored these
calls. Shaikh Khalid, at last year's UNGA General Assembly,
proposed a new regional organization that would include both
Iran and Israel, without preconditions. Despite a tepid
response from Arab governments, the proposal remains on the
table.
</p><p>MANAMA 00000151 002 OF 002
</p><p>¶9. (S) Open to Additional Facilities for the U.S. military:
Bahrain hosts the headquarters of NAVCENT and the Fifth Fleet
- about 2500 U.S. personnel - and permits easy access for
U.S. military aircraft to its Shaikh Isa airbase. We
understand CENTCOM is considering Shaikh Isa as a potential,
partial alternative to Manas in Kyrgyzstan. We think the
Bahrainis would respond positively if asked.
