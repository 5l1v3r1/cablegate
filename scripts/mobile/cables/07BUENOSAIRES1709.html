</p><p>¶1.  (C)  Ambassador asked Argentine Minister of the Interior 
</p><p>(MOI) Anibal Fernandez August 27 about his views on dealing 
</p><p>with terrorist threats and other serious problems in the 
</p><p>Tri-border area (TBA).  He asked the Ministe his views on 
</p><p>the potential benefits of addressing a broader scope of 
</p><p>issues in the 3   1 Working Group.   MOI Fernandez reacted 
</p><p>positively, indicating that the GOA was open to discussing 
</p><p>""any pertinent issues.""   MOI Fernandez acknowledged that 
</p><p>problems of terrorism, narcotics, arms trafficking, 
</p><p>trafficking in persons, and money laundering are often 
</p><p>interrelated and that the same groups are often involved in 
</p><p>many of these activities at the same time. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶2.  (C)  MOI Fernandez was also candid about the challenges 
</p><p>of working in the TBA.   Argentina has a good working 
</p><p>relationship with Brazil on these issues and sees Brazil as a 
</p><p>valuable and serious partner.  Paraguay, alternatively, is 
</p><p>not a reliable partner.  MOI Fernandez referred to Paraguay 
</p><p>as a ""plastic"" country, with institutions that are much less 
</p><p>than what they seem, and fraudulent documents readily 
</p><p>available.  He urged caution in dealing with Paraguayan 
</p><p>authorities.  He also acknowledged, however, that Paraguay is 
</p><p>the source of many of the problems in the TBA region, so that 
</p><p>its role in regional TBA efforts, including the 3   1 
</p><p>mechanism, was critically important. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>¶3.  (C)  The Ambasador also noted recent reports of numerous 
</p><p>unauthorized flights entering Argentine air space, 
</p><p>particularly in the TBA.   MOI Fernandez acknowledged the 
</p><p>problem, particularly as it relates to the entry of narcotics 
</p><p>into the country, and the paucity of the GOA's response. 
</p><p>Dismissing Argentine radar as ""artisinal"" (""hand- made""), he 
</p><p>complained that Argentina does not have the contemporaty 
</p><p>radar technology needed to aggressively confront the issue. 
</p><p>He also noted that the corruption on both the Argentine and 
</p><p>Paraguayan sides of the border make this a particularly 
</p><p>difficult problem.
