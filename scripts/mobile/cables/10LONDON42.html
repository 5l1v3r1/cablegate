<br></pre></p></div><p></p><p>(S/NF) Political Minister Counselor Greg Berry demarched Julian Miller, Deputy Foreign Affairs Advisor to Prime Minister Brown, and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) MENA Deputy Director John Casson on Syrian military ties to Hizballah as instructed reftel. Miller promised to make sure the issue was included in future interactions with the Syrians. Casson agreed that the U.S. and UK share common strategic goals even if we do sometimes take a different approach. Casson further assured us that the issue is "front and center" and "always on the agenda" in all contacts with Syria. He said a team from HMG was scheduled to be in Damascus the week of January 11 and would include the Hizballah issue in the presentation to the Syrians. Unfortunately, Syria often does not address the issue directly, commonly responding that it "won't be resolved until there is peace with Israel." Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
