¶1. (U) On January 2, the National Electoral Council (CNE) 
released the official results of the October 25 political and 
economic reform referendum.  The CNE concluded that one of 
fifteen referendum items met the twenty-five percent 
registered voter threshold required for approval.  Item One, 
which bans politicians convicted of corruption from holding 
political office, passed by a margin of 26,364 votes. 
 
¶2. (C) Several other items failed by only small margins, such 
as a proposal to eliminate the appointment of alternates for 
board members of public corporations, which fell just 6,365 
votes short.  Colombians for the Referendum (CPR), a pro-GOC 
civic action group, and the recently organized "New Party," 
which supports President Uribe, plan to contest the CNE's 
decision that only one item of the referendum passed.  The 
case will be heard by the Council of State, the highest 
administrative court in the country, in the second week of 
January, although it is unlikely to succeed (reftel).
