¶1. (C)  Summary:  The ROKG sees hints of movement from the 
DPRK but that it will not offer any inducements to the DPRK 
without meaningful action from the North Vice Foreign 
Minister Mitoji Yabunaka told the Ambassador on December 21. 
Foreign Minister Okada's upcoming travel abroad will include 
stops in Russia, Turkey, and Burma as well as a possible 
January Washington trip.  Yabunaka himself would plan to 
travel to Washington in advance of an Okada visit. On Futenma 
replacement and alliance management, Prime Minister Hatoyama 
confirmed to Secretary Clinton in Copenhagen that the current 
Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) plan would be the fallback 
if no other alternatives are found. Yabunaka also expressed 
his view that informal U.S.-Japan dialogue would be 
preferable to a more formal structure during this time of 
political transition and uncertainty. Yabunaka opined that 
Prime Minister Hatoyama keeps his own counsel on some issues 
and that reticence to express his own views with advisors can 
create false impressions. Nonetheless, Yabunaka is optimistic 
regarding the U.S.-Japan alliance, noting that public support 
remains strong, adding that media outreach could be effective 
in persuading and informing both the media and public. 
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) Chairman Ichiro Ozawa,s role 
in policy formation remains unclear but Ozawa is well aware 
of the impression that he wields great influence. Yabunaka 
confirmed that Japan would deliver a strong message to Iran 
during the visit of Supreme Council for National Security 
Secretary General Seed Jalili.  End Summary. 
 
Yabunaka Travel to Korea 
------------------------ 
¶2. (C) Yabunaka reported on his weekend trip to South Korea's 
Cheju Island for meetings with his ROKG counterpart.  The 
ROKG believes that there are hints of movement by the DPRK 
but will not respond absent meaningful action from the DPRK 
to address the nuclear issue.  Yabunaka noted that this 
stance was a change from the government of former President 
Roh Moo-hyun, which Yabunaka suggested would have been more 
forward-leaning in responding to hints of a thaw in progress 
with the DPRK. 
 
¶3. (C) Yabunaka said he had been frank with his ROK 
counterpart in discussing the broader aspects of the 
U.S.-Japan alliance, including the current domestic political 
situation in Japan surrounding the new DPJ-led government, 
political dynamics, and the debate over Futenma replacement 
and the realignment road map. Yabunaka added that the ROK had 
undergone similar domestic political turmoil in 2003 in the 
transition from President Kim Dae-jung,s administration to 
that of Roh.  Yabunaka said the ROKG understood the 
""seriousness and the urgency"" presently surrounding 
U.S.-Japan alliance management but stopped short of saying 
the ROKG was ""concerned."" 
 
Foreign Minister Travel 
----------------------- 
¶4. (C) Foreign Minister Okada will be traveling extensively 
in late December and early January. He will travel to Russia, 
Turkey, and Burma.  He would like to meet with the Secretary 
in January.  Yabunaka proposed that he travel to Washington 
himself the first week of January to meet with the Deputy 
Secretary and prepare for Okada,s trip. 
 
Hatoyama Confirms FRF as Fallback 
--------------------------------- 
¶5. (C) Yabunaka said Prime Minister Hatoyama confirmed to the 
Secretary in Copenhagen that if the GOJ review of FRF 
alternatives to Henoko did not yield viable proposals, the 
GOJ would return to the 2006 FRF agreement.  Recent newspaper 
reports characterizing Hatoyama,s discussion with the 
Secretary had been inaccurate, he stressed. 
 
Informal Dialogue Preferable 
---------------------------- 
¶6. (C) Regarding the shape of U.S.-Japan consultations on 
alliance issues over the coming months, Yabunaka suggested 
 
that an informal dialogue would likely be preferable to a 
more formal structure such as a two-plus-two.  He noted that 
informal meetings could allow political leaders on both sides 
to reach basic understandings on key issues, review overall 
security strategy in East Asia, and demonstrate the new 
government,s seriousness on security matters.  Given a 
sometimes steep learning curve faced by some DPJ leaders on 
the details and rationale behind U.S.-Japan security policy, 
a formal structure could be more risky as the Hatoyama 
administration and/or ruling coalition political leaders 
could take positions based on incomplete or erroneous 
understandings of alliance issues and options.  An informal 
process could be an opportunity to educate leaders over the 
course of the next year, with an eye toward the President,s 
November 2010 visit to Japan.  The President,s visit would 
be a opportunity to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
alliance in a more positive atmosphere, having laid the 
groundwork through close consultations during the course of 
the year. 
 
Assessing Hatoyama on Security Issues 
------------------------------------- 
¶7. (C) Yabunaka noted that the Prime Minister,s advisors had 
a variety of views but that their private advice to him 
remained private.  Hatoyama,s own views are sometimes 
difficult to read.  With the Prime Minister often offering 
little in the way of comments that challenge a policy view or 
analysis, Hatoyama advisors are sometimes left with the 
impression that he has agreed or accepted a particular 
position when, in fact, he has not.  This tendency toward 
reticence contributes to some ambiguity and confusion 
regarding the Prime Minister,s views.  Yabunaka said it 
would be beneficial for the U.S. to go through the basic 
fundamentals of security issues with the Prime Minister, 
noting that engagement with China and others has its place, 
but that the U.S. and Japan had to provide a foundation for 
security as well.  He added that it was important to impress 
upon Hatoyama that strong U.S.-Japan relations did not have 
an indefinite ""shelf life"" and that the Hatoyama 
administration could not simply set the alliance aside in 
favor of domestic politics without consequences.  The 
alliance needs continued care and nurturing. 
 
Cause For Optimism 
------------------ 
¶8. (C) In terms of educating DPJ policymakers regarding the 
importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance, Yabunaka said that he 
was optimistic, citing Foreign Minister Okada,s deeper 
understanding of security issues since assuming office. 
Moreover, recent public opinion polls indicated that 65 
percent of the Japanese public supports the U.S.-Japan 
alliance.  Message and messenger were also important as well, 
he added.  For example, Secretary Gates, direct style in 
addressing Futenma during his October visit had not played 
well in Japan.  On the other hand, President Obama is very 
popular among Japanese, and that popularity could be 
leveraged in promoting the alliance. 
 
Media and Public Outreach 
------------------------- 
¶9. (C) Despite public support for the alliance in principle, 
Yabunaka said that neither the general public nor some in the 
media understand security issues very well.  He added that 
newspaper editorialists and the business community have a 
reasonably good understanding of the issues but that 
television commentators and politicians did not have as 
strong a grasp of security issues.  Efforts to educate the 
latter group could be worthwhile, he added.  In particular, 
he cited the examples of several influential and popular 
television commentators who might respond well to outreach. 
 
Ozawa Role 
---------- 
¶10. (C) Although DPJ Chairman Ozawa,s role in 
decision-making by the Hatoyama government remains somewhat 
unclear, Yabunaka said that Ozawa,s worldview is clear and 
well-defined.  The notion that Japan only obeyed the wishes 
 
of the United States was deeply ingrained in Ozawa,s mind 
Yabunaka said.  Noting Ozawa,s recent trip to China along 
with some 650 DPJ members, he said that Ozawa had been 
disturbed that the trip had been cast as if he had been 
""paying tribute to China.""  Yabunaka said Ozawa,s inability 
to foresee how such a trip would be portrayed in the media 
reflected Ozawa,s occasional shortcomings in managing his 
message.  That said, Ozawa is aware of his perceived role as 
the hidden power in the DPJ, reportedly telling PM Hatoyama 
that if he were to become involved in the Futenma issue, the 
media would portray Ozawa as dictating the DPJ position. 
 
Iran 
---- 
¶11. (S)  In response to a query from the DCM, Yabunaka 
confirmed that Japan would deliver a strong message to 
visiting Iranian Supreme Council for National Security 
Secretary General Saeed Jalili that Iran should return to 
negotiations and respond positively to the P5 plus 1 
proposal.  Yabunaka noted that Deputy Foreign Minister 
Kenichiro Sasae had breakfast with Jalili that morning and 
that he and Foreign Minister Okada would be delivering a 
consistent, clear message to Iran that it must meet its 
obligations.  Yabunaka also said Japan would express its 
willingness to host P5 plus 1 discussions with Iran if that 
would facilitate progress.
