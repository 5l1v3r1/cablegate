¶1. (U) This is an action request to Embassy Paris.  Please 
deliver the points in paragraph 4 as soon as possible.  These 
points may be left as a non-paper. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (S/NF) We have information the French firm Sofradir and 
its subsidiary Ulis continue to sell cooled and uncooled 
infrared detectors to a Chinese firm for incorporation into 
thermal imaging systems.  We believe the Chinese firm, 
Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd, is actively selling its 
thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense entities.  Iranian 
military access to Chinese thermal imaging systems that rely 
on high-grade French infrared detectors could increase the 
threat to US and allied forces operating in the Gulf region. 
We want to request the Government of France to act 
immediately to terminate this activity by Sofradir and Ulis 
so China cannot use French components to manufacture weapons 
systems and sell them to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism. 
 
 
------------------------- 
ACTION REQUEST/OBJECTIVES 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Post is requested to approach appropriate host 
government officials as soon as possible to pursue the 
following objectives and to deliver the talking 
points/non-paper in para 4 below: 
 
-- Inform French officials we have information the French 
firm Sofradir and its subsidiary Ulis continue to sell cooled 
and uncooled infrared detectors to China's Zhejiang Dali 
Technology Company Ltd for incorporation into thermal imaging 
systems. 
 
-- Stress that Zhejiang Dali Technology is actively selling 
its thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense entities and 
that the use of high-grade French infrared detectors in this 
technology could increase the threat to US and allied forces 
operating in the Gulf region. 
 
-- Ask the French government to investigate, share with us 
the results of its investigation, and act to have Sofradir 
and Ulis immediately terminate this activity. 
 
-- Emphasize to French officials that infrared detectors are 
critical components of high performance thermal imaging 
systems and are controlled under the Wassenaar Arrangement, 
Section 6.A.2.a.3. 
 
¶4. (SECRET/REL FRANCE) BEGIN TALKING POINTS 
 
-- In the interest of transparency and enhanced cooperation 
on nonproliferation matters, we would like to share the 
following information: 
 
-- We have information that the French firm Sofradir and its 
subsidiary Ulis continue to sell both cooled and uncooled 
infrared detectors to China's Zhejiang Dali Technology 
Company Ltd for incorporation into thermal imaging systems. 
 
-- Our information indicates the Chinese firm is actively 
selling its thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense 
entities. 
 
-- Iranian military access to Chinese thermal imaging systems 
that rely on high-grade French infrared detectors could 
increase the threat to US and allied forces operating in the 
Gulf region. 
 
-- Infrared detectors (IRD) are sensors and critical 
components of high performance thermal imaging systems.  IRDs 
are controlled under Wassenaar Arrangement, Section 6.A.2.a.3. 
 
-- IRDs are used in the core assemblies for advanced 
targeting pods, long-range reconnaissance systems, gimbaled 
imaging systems in manned and unmanned airborne 
reconnaissance and combat aircraft, Forward Looking Infrared 
(FLIR) sensors, tank targeting systems, submarine periscopes, 
and missile seekers. 
 
-- Diversion of the subject components could be harmful to 
our shared national security interests.  If these IRDs were 
included in the optical targeting mechanism for tanks and air 
defense systems, they could potentially be used to degrade US 
superiority in night combat operations. 
 
-- We ask that you carefully consider the consequences of 
such sales. 
 
-- We also welcome any further information about this case 
that may come to light in the course of any French 
investigation into the matter.
