¶1. (U) On June 4, the Costa Rican Cabinet approved leftist 
former presidential candidate Vladimir de la Cruz as the 
GOCR's new Ambassador-designate to Venezuela. On June 5, 
Alejandro Solano, MFA Deputy Director of Foreign Policy, told 
us that he expected De la Cruz to arrive in Caracas "in a 
couple of weeks." A brief bio of De la Cruz appears below. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Solano added that the COGR had no problems with the 
new Venezuelan Ambassador-designate to Costa Rica, who had 
not been named publicly for protocol reasons, and that the 
MFA hoped to formally accept his appointment as early as June 
¶5. The  Venezuelan Ambassador-designate replaced Jose Huerta 
Castillo, whose appointment languished for months and was 
ultimately not accepted by the GOCR due to a scandal 
involving Huerta in Paraguay. Solano confirmed the BRV's 
designate to be "a representative to an international 
organization headquartered in the U.S."

¶4. (C) COMMENT:  De la Cruz's appointment is somewhat 
puzzling. By background and inclination, he may be 
sympathetic to the BRV's outlook and initiatives. On the 
other hand, the Arias administration has kept its distance 
from Chavez, with President Arias himself publicly 
criticizing the Venezuelan leader on more than one occasion. 
So why appoint De La Cruz? We speculate that Arias may be 
looking to improve Costa Rican-Venezuelan relations (or at 
least reduce frictions) in order to position himself at some 
point to moderate Venezuelan tensions with the region. Arias 
has periodically "offered his services" in this regard in 
conversations with visiting USG officials. Entering the last 
half of his administration, the Nobel Prize winner may also 
be looking to play a larger role in regional and global 
politics, his well-known and long-time passion. Domestically, 
Arias has also been accused of abandoning his "socialist" 
roots, and appointing De la Cruz may be one way the president 
can burnish his leftist intellectuals, now that the bruising 
domestic political debate over CAFTA-DR is almost over. 
 
In his younger days, De la Cruz was a firebrand leftist who 
advocated revolutionary causes, but he appears to have 
mellowed over time. In a June 6 interview with "La Republica" 
newspaper, De la Cruz said that while he still considers 
himself a socialist, "I've matured and (now) understand that 
the development of a revolution in Costa Rica can only be 
done through democratic means, using the mechanisms that the 
 
Constitution provides." It remains to be seen what impact De 
la Cruz can and will actually have, however. When asked by a 
radio interviewer what he hopes to achieve during his term as 
Ambassador, De la Cruz replied, "I don't know."
