</p><p></p><p></p><p>SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) From April 19 to 22, Italy's Democrats of the Left 
(DS) and the Democracy and Liberty--The Margherita (Daisy) 
parties held what were likely their last respective party 
congresses. Both parties announced their pending dissolution 
and intent to jointly constitute a new Democratic Party (PD) 
in the spring of 2008.  Serious disagreements about the 
future suggest the PD birth will not be easy.  Nevertheless, 
it could introduce a new center-left force and bring more 
stability to any future center-left government.  In the short 
run, it will increase pressure for electoral reform (SEPTEL), 
a politically tumultuous process.  END SUMMARY. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>DS/DAISY PARTIES HERALD DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
---------------------------------------- 
 
</p><p>¶2. (C) From April 19 to 22, the Democrats of the Left (DS) 
and the Democracy and Liberty--the Margherita (Daisy) parties 
held what were likely their last respective party congresses 
(REF A). Both announced the dissolution of their parties and 
intent to jointly constitute a new Democratic Party (PD) in 
the spring of 2008.  DS/Daisy leaders claim formation of the 
PD will create a powerful force in the center-left that will 
bring more stability to future center-left governments. 
Though heralded as an historic achievement (the first time 
two major Italian parties have decided to join forces), the 
decision was greeted with concern among many in the party 
rank-and-file and with apathy among the Italian public. 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶3. (SBU) With party delegates chosen and issues hashed out in 
advance, most decisions were known before the actual 
congresses began.  Piero Fassino was confirmed as DS Party 
Secretary and Francesco Rutelli was re-elected Daisy 
 
SIPDIS 
President.  This cable: 1) highlights both conferences, 2) 
discusses challenges to the creation of the PD, and 3) 
discusses implications of the PD for the Italian government. 
 
</p><p></p><p>CONGRESS ATMOSPHERICS 
--------------------- 
</p><p></p><p>¶4. (C) DS CONGRESS:  The DS congress was a nostalgic affair 
with leaders recalling various periods of political 
transformation, especially the dissolution of the former 
Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1992.  Fassino delivered an 
all-inclusive 90-minute justification for the PD, and the 
policies he would like to bring to it.  Fabio Mussi, leader 
of the left wing ""correntone"" of the DS, confirmed his 
opposition to the PD and his departure from the DS in a 
speech laced with leftist rhetoric.  Rome Mayor Walter 
Veltroni offered a well-received address that observers say 
was the only one with a vision for the PD and which confirmed 
Veltroni as a potential PD leader.  The enthusiastic welcome 
for FM Massimo D'Alema demonstrated his firm position as the 
DS heavyweight. 
 
</p><p></p><p>¶5. (C) DAISY CONGRESS: Confirmed as party President, Rutelli 
fended off an offensive from conservative former Christian 
Democrats (i Popolari) such as Enrico Letta, Dario 
Francheschini, and Giuseppe Fioroni.  The Daisy conference 
lacked the drama of the DS congress, but party infighting was 
more apparent.  MoD Arturo Parisi left the congress prior to 
the final vote to protest the lack of clarity on exactly how 
the PD would be formed. 
 
</p><p></p><p>DIFFICULT ROAD TO ACTUAL PD FORMATION 
------------------------------------- 
</p><p>¶6. (C) While the DS and the Daisy announced their intention 
to create the PD, the only other point they agreed on was the 
inadequacy of the party manifesto drafted prior to the 
conventions.  There is no clarity on practical issues such 
as: what to do with the two party newspapers; the future PD 
party symbol; how local offices would be merged, etc.  There 
are also several policy disagreements between the DS and the 
Daisy parties. The three most divisive issues have been: 
 
International Association: The DS argued forcefully for the 
PD to be included in the European Socialist Party (PSE), a 
step Daisy leaders strongly oppose.  This ""identity"" issue is 
essential for party stalwarts in both groups, weary of 
surrendering the party soul to former ""communists"" and former 
 
ROME 00000877  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
""Christian Democrats,"" respectively. A comprise involving a 
""soft association"" simultaneously with the PSE and other more 
reformist parties appears to be emerging, but has done little 
to settle DS fears that the PD will be too moderate and Daisy 
concerns the PD will be too leftist. 
 
Christian Identity: The core of the DS party is secular with 
a strong anti-clerical faction.  Calls for support of gay 
marriage and diatribes against the Vatican's interference in 
Italian politics received strong approval from DS members. 
The Daisy Party includes many former Christian Democrats 
closely linked to the Vatican who are inflexible in their 
opposition to gay marriage. 
 
PD Leadership: A consensus has emerged that PM Romano Prodi 
should be the PD Party Leader until his announced departure 
at the end of the current legislative period (2011, according 
to Prodi). However, there is no end to the list of aspirants 
for leadership as soon as Prodi leaves the scene, and the 
Daisy is particularly concerned that the larger DS will use 
its more-organized party structure to dominate the Daisy 
party in leadership contests. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p>THE PD: LOOKING LESS THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7. (C) For the time being, the future PD appears to be less 
than the sum of its parts. A few days after the DS Congress, 
left-leaning DS leader Gavino Angius also announced his 
departure from the DS over the creation of the PD (REF B). 
Together Mussi and Angius received 24.4 percent of the 
leadership vote at the DS congress, compared to DS Secretary 
Piero Fassino's 75.6 percent.  Ten Senators and 22 Deputies 
are expected to join Mussi and Angius in opting out of the 
future PD. Moreover, the DS and Daisy are suffering in 
opinion polls for their association with the radical left, an 
association they are unwilling/unable to break. 
</p><p></p><p>¶8. (C) COMMENT: Having publicly committed themselves to the 
PD, will not turn back. Consolidation of Italy's numerous 
parties on both the left and the right would be a positive 
step for political stability, and the PD has potential to 
spur that development beyond the DS/Daisy merger.  However, 
the process will be difficult, possibly longer than 
predicted, and could leave serious political turbulence in 
its wake, as has already been seen.  Stability in the next 
few months may turn on electoral reform (SEPTEL) and related 
maneuvering in Italian party politics. END COMMENT.
