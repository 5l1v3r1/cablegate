¶1. (S) Summary: Prime Minister Vanhanen and Charge reviewed 
several issues of interest to the U.S. and Finland Nov. 25. 
Vanhanen raised the issue of an alleged CIA flight through 
Finland about which the GOF has faced heavy political and 
press criticism. He also discussed the current presidential 
campaign and his relationship with President Halonen; the 
parliamentary elections of 2007; trade with China; his hopes 
for Finland's upcoming EU presidency; the stalled crisis 
management legislation; and his perceptions of Finnish-US 
relations and of the U.S. image in Europe.  Charge welcomed 
the PM's effort to address openly the range of issues that 
affect our bilateral relationship and offered 
continued U.S. support and cooperation in areas of shared 
concern. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen and Charge met Nov. 25 
for 90 minutes at Vanhanen's official residence, at the PM's 
request. Vanhanen characterized the meeting as informal and 
explained that he makes a habit of reviewing bilateral issues 
with the U.S. chief of mission "every couple of months or so" 
-- a practice he only engages in with the U.S., given the great 
importance he personally attaches to the relationship.  The 
conversation covered several bilateral and regional issues of 
concern to both countries. Vanhanen also spoke candidly and at 
length about the Parliament's rejection of his government's 
crisis management operation (CMO) defense bill (septel). 
 
--------------------------------------- 
ALLEGED CIA RENDITION FLIGHT IN FINLAND 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (S) Vanhanen raised the issue of an alleged CIA flight that 
supposedly landed in Helsinki on May 16, 2003 and then proceeded 
to Stockholm (reftel A).  Vanhanen noted that the issue has 
generated significant, embarrassing coverage in the Finnish 
press and that opposition politicians have attacked the GOF and 
demanded clarification.  He said that initially the Finnish MOD 
could find no record of having approved the flight -- an 
unfortunate development that prompted even greater criticism and 
allegations that the U.S. was using Finnish airspace illegally. 
However, he noted with some relief, the MOD subsequently found 
the authorization and would so inform the press.  Vanhanen did 
not pressure the Charge for information, but made it clear that 
any information we can eventually provide would be helpful.  In 
accordance with existing guidance, Charge responded that the 
Embassy can confirm or deny nothing on this issue, but that 
we would seek to be helpful when and if information became 
available. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
CAMPAIGNS, AND RELATIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT 
------------------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) Vanhanen confirmed what many have observed about 
Finland's presidential campaign:  that there really are few 
significant policy differences among the major party 
candidates. 
He acknowledged that Conservative Party (CON) candidate Sauli 
Niinisto has sought to distance himself from Vanhanen on 
security policy, and has scored some political points through 
that effort. However, the PM added, Niinisto's view may indicate 
that he is either getting bad campaign advice or "just doesn't 
understand" the GOF's position on security policy.  Vanhanen 
also said that he and President Halonen differ on tax policy, 
with the President generally favoring higher rates. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Concerning Halonen, Vanhanen told Charge he is proud 
of the fact that Finns from across the political spectrum have 
applauded the outstanding working relationship between the 
two of them.  Their cooperation has resulted in Vanhanen's 
attaining the highest public approval rating ever for a 
Finnish prime minister (currently 55 percent), despite a 
recent drop as a result of the presidential campaign. 
Vanhanen cited his own negotiation and compromise skills as 
crucial in dealing effectively with a strong president who 
has been forceful about pushing the limits of her own 
constitutional mandates.  Acknowledging that his good role 
as prime minister has, in fact, probably hurt his ability to 
campaign aggressively as a presidential candidate, Vanhanen 
said, "It is more important to run a government well than 
to score points in an election."  (Vanhanen has, in fact, 
fallen to third behind Halonen and Niinisto in recent polls.) 
Nevertheless, looking forward to next year's parliamentary 
election, the PM said that voters will look back and value 
his low profile and strong management skills, and reward 
his Center Party (CEN) accordingly. 
 
--------------------------- 
CHINA AND THE EU PRESIDENCY 
--------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) The PM briefly touched on several other issues. 
Regarding Finland's growing trade with China and his recent 
visit there, Vanhanen said that "keeping a balance" is 
crucial to Finnish interests.  The lure of inexpensive 
Chinese exports is attractive to any nation's consumers, 
he suggested, but the GOF and the Finnish private sector 
remain convinced that Finland is capable of selling high 
tech and other products to China in almost equal measure 
to what it imports.  He hinted that, over the long term, 
he would probably favor lifting the China arms embargo, but 
emphasized that he fully understands how important this issue 
is to the USG and therefore does not intend to act on it now 
or during the Finnish EU presidency.  Indeed, he said, 
Finland has an aggressive agenda for its EU presidency and 
hopes for no natural disasters or other crises "on 
Finland's watch." Nevertheless, the GOF is actively 
preparing for any eventuality.  As part of its 
preparations, Vanhanen hopes to consult closely with all 
major non-Eu heads of government (US, Russia, China, etc.) 
in an effort to incorporate their views and priorities, to 
the extent possible, 
in the Presidency's agenda and to establish a working 
relationship that can be tapped in the event of future 
crises. Recognizing this as a clear hint that Vanhanen 
would like to meet President Bush sometime before Finland 
assumes the EU presidency in July, Charge reminded the PM 
that we expected no more than one presidential meeting in 
2006 for Finland and would leave it up to Finland to 
decide whether its PM or the President would participate. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶7. (S) This one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister 
demonstrates the importance the GOF places on maintaining a 
meaningful dialogue with the US.  In general, he was 
forthcoming on political and strategic issues; realistic 
and honest about his campaign prospects; and very positive 
about the overall tone and substance of the US-Finnish 
bilateral relationship. On the rendition flight issue, 
which has become quite sensitive for the Vanhanen government 
as well, he made clear that he was raising it not to 
challenge us but rather in hopes of resolving it in a manner 
that limits damage for both sides.
