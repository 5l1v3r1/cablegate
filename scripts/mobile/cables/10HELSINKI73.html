¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  MOD Policy Director Jarvenpaa discussed 
potential realignment of RC-North, the new Turkish PRT there, 
and political support for Finland's activities in Afghanistan 
with P-E Chief in a February 23 meeting.  Post requests 
additional releasable information regarding increased U.S. 
military forces in RC-North (see para. 6).  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) In a February 23 meeting with P-E Chief, MOD Policy 
Director Pauli Jarvenpaa related his understanding that 
German authorities are considering a realignment of RC-North 
under which Germany would take over responsibilities for PRT 
operations in the area surrounding Mazar-e-Sharif while 
Sweden and Finland shifted their PRT from Mazar-e-Sharif to 
the northwestern portion of RC-North around Faryab. 
Jarvenpaa did not raise the issue himself nor did he express 
an opinion on the merits of the idea, which he characterized 
as "under internal German discussion."  Jarvenpaa did opine 
that Sweden might not be particularly keen on leaving 
Mazar-e-Sharif given the amount they had invested in 
infrastructure there, and that such a move would put the 
Swedes right back where they started. 
 
¶3.  (C) Jarvenpaa confirmed that discussions were ongoing 
among RC-North contributors about the new Turkish PRT there. 
He understood that the Turks had modified their initial 
concept for a "civilian PRT" and would deploy roughly 100 
soldiers along with the same number of civilian experts. 
 
¶4.  (C) Jarvenpaa related that he had just returned from 
testifying before the parliament's foreign affairs committee 
on Afghanistan.  The committee strongly supported the 
government's planned increases in Finnish military and 
civilian contributions, and many members were eager to hear 
details on Finnish military operations which were provided by 
FDF Operations Chief MG Raty and the immediate former 
commander of Finnish forces in Afghanistan.  While the SDP 
statement at the plenary session the previous week (ref A) 
had not endorsed the increases, Jarvenpaa felt comfortable 
that the SDP was still behind the policy.  "Perhaps they got 
a phone call from the President," he mused, referring to the 
fact that President Halonen, officially nonpartisan but from 
the SDP, supported the government's policy.  When asked about 
parliamentary visits to Afghanistan, Jarvenpaa could not 
recall that any Finnish parliamentarians had visited except 
those that were serving ministers.  He pointed to the 
difficulty of providing security for such a visit, which 
would only be feasible for a handful of MPs at the most. 
 
¶5. (C) COMMENT:  We continue to ask members of parliament and 
government officials whether there is any consideration given 
to a parliamentary visit to Afghanistan, given the 
significant Finnish commitment there over the last eight 
years.  Cost and security are frequently raised as obstacles 
by MFA and MOD officials, though most parliamentarians 
indicate that they would jump at a chance to see things for 
themselves.  While Afghanistan is on track to become 
Finland's largest and longest-running crisis management 
operation, its merits will continue to be debated by MPs, 
almost none of whom have any direct experience of conditions 
on the ground there.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶6.  (C) ACTION REQUEST: Jarvenpaa requested more information 
on U.S. troop increases in RC-North.  MPs had questioned him 
on the effect of the heightened U.S. military presence in 
RC-North.  He explained that this would help the COIN effort 
and so would be advantageous for Finland.  Post requests 
releasable information on the plans for an increased U.S. 
military presence in RC-North which we can share with the 
GOF.  REL ISAF information for government use only as well as 
less detailed information which could be used to address 
questions from parliamentarians and the media would be 
helpful.
