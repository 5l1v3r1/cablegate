<li><h3><a href='/mobile/cables/08TRIPOLI592.html'>THUG LIFE: HANNIBAL AL-QADHAFI'S ARREST PROMPTS FISSURE IN SWISS-LIBYAN RELATIONS  TRIPOLI 00000592  001.2 OF 003   CLASSIFIED BY: John T. Godfrey, CDA, U.S. Embassy - Tripoli, Dept of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: The arrest in Geneva of Hannibal al-Qadhafi, son of Muammar al-Qadhafi, and his wife has prompted a serious diplomatic fissure between Switzerland and Libya, which has accused Swiss police of using unnecessary force, of having violated Hannibal's diplomatic immunity, of having violated diplomatic protocol by not granting Libyan diplomats immediate consular access to him, and of deliberately seeking to embarrass Libya because of Switzerland's "well-known" dislike of Arabs. Efforts by the Swiss government to accord Hannibal preferential treatment earned no quarter from the GOL, which has reduced the number of flights between the two countries, ceased issuing visas to Swiss citizens seeking to travel to Libya, and harassed Swiss companies in Libya.  Since Hannibal's arrest a week ago, two Swiss companies have been closed on the pretext that their registration papers were not in order and one Swiss businessmen has been detained for irregularities with his residency permit. Diplomatic efforts to smooth over the incident are underway: the Swiss Foreign Minister spoke with her Libyan counterpart today, and a high-level Swiss delegation is scheduled to arrive in Tripoli tomorrow for talks aimed at restoring equilibrium to bilateral relations.  The GOL's reflexive efforts to attack Swiss commercial interests and cease issuing visas to Swiss citizens underscore the extent to which the regime treats business as an extension of politics and the sensitivity of anything to do with the al-Qadhafi family.  The incident also reflects the gap - perceived by some to be growing - between average Libyans, who take a dim view of the al-Qadhafi clan's embarrassing and repeated falls from grace, and a hidebound regime that sees the state as an extension of the al-Qadhafi family empire.  End summary.  ABUSING THE HELP  2. (C) Swiss Ambassador Daniel von Muralt gave CDA and A/RSO an extensive readout on July 22 on the recent arrest in Geneva of Hannibal al-Qadhafi, son of Muammar al-Qadhafi, and the subsequent rift in Swiss-Libyan bilateral relations.  Hannibal and his wife, who is nearly nine months pregnant, together with a sizeable retinue of bodyguards and assistants, were in Geneva for the delivery of their child.  Two of their household staff, a Moroccan man and a Tunisian women, contacted a Swiss NGO to complain that Hannibal and his wife had physically abused them. The NGO contacted Swiss police and warrants were issued by a Swiss magistrate for the two.  Swiss police informed Libyan diplomats at the Libyan missions in Geneva and Bern that they intended to take Hannibal and his wife into custody for questioning about allegations that they had physically abused their assistants and detained them illegally by confiscating their passports. (Note: Von Muralt explained that a large number of Arabs, many of them wealthy citizens of Gulf states, visit and live in Switzerland and have a reputation of abusing their domestic help.  The scope of the problem is such that some Swiss NGO's essentially specialize in "rescuing" domestic help who are abused, physically and otherwise, by their well-heeled employers.  End note.)  HANNIBAL REFUSES TO GO QUIETLY  3. (C) Swiss police officers arrived at Hannibal's room at the Hotel President Wilson on July 15 to serve the warrants, but were told by Libyan diplomats at the hotel that Hannibal and his wife did not intend to surrender themselves into custody.  After an hour and a half of fruitless negotiations, Swiss police used a hotel key to enter the room.  Von Muralt said two bodyguards posted just inside the door of the suite's entryway physically attacked the Swiss officers, who subdued the bodyguards and relieved them of their concealed sidearms.  The bodyguards did not have permits for the weapons.  The Swiss officers, some of whom had drawn their sidearms when attacked by the two bodyguards at the entrance, then forced open the doors to the suite's bedrooms; Hannibal's wife and three year-old daughter were hiding in one and he was hiding in another with six other bodyguards and other members of his entourage.  PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT ...  4. (C) Swiss officers took Hannibal's wife to a hospital, where she remained under police custody.  Hannibal was taken in an armored sedan (vice a police van) to the Ministry of Justice building, where he was held in a private room July 15-17. Emphasizing the special treatment accorded to Hannibal, Von Muralt said Hannibal, a chain smoker, was allowed to smoke despite a prohibition against doing so in all Swiss public buildings.  In addition, von Muralt said that although Swiss law permitted authorities to detain Hannibal incommunicado for 2-8 days,  he was permitted to make a telephone call shortly after  TRIPOLI 00000592  002.2 OF 003   his arrest.  Swiss authorities assumed he would call his father, Muammar al-Qadhafi; however, Hannibal insisted on speaking instead with his sister, Aisha al-Qadhafi.  Von Muralt said contacts close to the al-Qadhafi family told him that Hannibal has lived in fear of father since a series of incidents in which he assaulted Italian police officers in Rome (2001), attacked police in Paris after being stopped for speeding on the wrong side of the Champs Elysees while inebriated (2004) and received a four-year suspended prison sentence from a French court after beating his pregnant girlfriend, who refused to let him into their hotel room (2005).  Hannibal was banned from traveling in the European Schengen zone between 2005 and 2008; he successfully obtained a visa from the Swiss Embassy in Tripoli in February 2008.  ... EARNS NO QUARTER FROM AN ANGRY AISHA  5. (C) Aisha al-Qadhafi arrived in Geneva on July 17 and promptly issued a statement to the press in which she accused Swiss police of having used excessive force, and the Swiss government of discriminating against Arabs and perpetrating a "deliberate plot against the al-Qadhafi family".  Aisha closed her remarks by noting that Libya's response to Hannibal's arrest would be in line with the proverb of "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth", prompting speculation in the media that the GOL would retaliate against Switzerland.  Noting that it would have been better had she not come, von Muralt sharply criticized Aisha's statement as "highly inaccurate" and said her attempts at mediation hurt, rather than helped, efforts to quietly resolve the incident.  Eventually, Hannibal and his wife were released on bail - 200,000 Euros for Hannibal; 300,000 Euros for his wife, who is accused of perpetrating most of the alleged physical abuse - and flew from Geneva to Tripoli late on July 17 on a private aircraft, together with Aisha, six of the bodyguard cohort and various other assistants.  The two bodyguards who assaulted Swiss officers and carried the unregistered handguns remain in detention in Geneva.  GOL COUNTER ATTACKS ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT ...  6. (C) Noting that he had been officially convoked by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on five different occasions since July 15, von Muralt stressed that GOL officials were more focused on mitigating damage to the al-Qadhafi family reputation and saving face than on the fact that Hannibal's behavior had been egregious.  Von Muralt's primary MFA interlocutors have been the MFA U/S-equivalent for European Affairs, Abdulati Obeidi, and the MFA Secretary for Adminstrative Affairs, Muhammad Kaim.  MFA officials had presented to von Muralt a series of demarches and diplomatic notes accusing the Swiss government of having used excessive force (particularly with respect to detaining Hannibal's wife), of having violated Hannibal's diplomatic immunity, of having violated diplomatic protocol by not granting Libyan diplomats immediate consular access to him, and of deliberately seeking to embarrass Libya because of its "well-known" dislike of Arabs.  7. (C) Von Muralt noted that Swiss officers had only drawn their weapons because they were physically assaulted by armed bodyguards, that Hannibal was not/not entitled to diplomatic immunity (he entered Switzerland on a diplomatic passport but was not accredited to the Swiss Government as a diplomat), that Libyan diplomats were not entitled to immediate consular access because he was not an accredited diplomat, and that Switzerland had a proud history of racial tolerance and diversity (one in five residents is a foreigner).  (Note: Libyan MFA officials have insisted that Article 36 of the Vienna Conventions provides for immediate consular access; von Muralt said Switzerland's interpretation, based on international practice, was to provide access within four to six days.  End note.)  ... AND ATTACKS SWISS INTERESTS  8. (C) The GOL also moved swiftly to exact reprisals against Swiss interests in Libya.  The Libyan People's Bureau (embassy-equivalent) in Bern ceased issuing visas to all Swiss travelers on July 17.  GOL officials reduced Swiss Air's connections to Tripoli from three flights per week to one and Libya's Air Afriqiyah reduced its flights to Geneva from three flights per week to one.  Swiss companies in Libya have been summoned for inspections of their registration documents and, in the case of Swiss nationals, checks of their residency permits. Two Swiss companies, ABB and Stukey Co., have been closed since July 15 for alleged irregularities in their registration papers and the Swiss national country representative for ABB has been in detention since July 19 on charges that his residency papers  TRIPOLI 00000592  003.2 OF 003   were not in order.  Von Muralt estimated that another 20 Swiss companies were at risk of being shuttered unless the diplomatic impasse is resolved quickly.  The GOL has provided a small detachment of National Police to guard the Swiss Embassy and Residence, and has suggested to von Muralt that angry Libyans, upset by Swiss treatment of Hannibal, could stage popular demonstrations against the Swiss mission.  HIGH-LEVEL NEGOTIATIONS UNDERWAY, BUT OUTCOME UNCLEAR  9. (C) Emphasizing that the Swiss government is keen to put the relationship back on an even keel, von Muralt nonetheless stressed that Switzerland "really doesn't need Libya for anything". There are 41 registered Swiss nationals in Libya, of whom 25 are dual Libyan-Swiss nationals.  He suggested that while the Swiss Foreign Ministry was working to resolve the issue, there were limits to how much they were willing to concede.  Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey spoke by telephone with Libyan Foreign Minister Abdulrahman Shalgham on July 22.  Von Muralt said Shalgham insisted that Switzerland had violated the Vienna Conventions by not granting immediate consular access, but backed away from accusations by Aisha al-Qadhafi and other MFA officials that Swiss police had used undue force and that Swiss officials deliberately sought to embarrass Libya.  10. (C) A senior Swiss delegation is scheduled to travel to Tripoli on July 23 for talks to "smooth things over"; however, von Muralt noted that Hannibal and his wife are out on bail and are currently required to return to Geneva to stand trial. Should they fail to appear, the Swiss judge could issue an Interpol arrest warrant.  If that were to happen, von Muralt speculated that the GOL would take "drastic measures" and the Swiss Embassy could be shuttered.  Von Muralt suggested to MFA official Abdulati Obeidi on July 20 that the GOL retain good legal counsel and pursue an out-of-court settlement with the Tunisian and Moroccan who pressed the charges, which could obviate the need for Hannibal and his wife to appear before a court in Geneva.  The Swiss are making contingency plans to quickly close their mission should that become necessary.  The embassy has continued to operate normally since Hannibal's arrest, to include issuing visas, but may cease visa issuance if Libya does not quickly resume issuing visas to Swiss citizens. Von Muralt noted that the Swiss Embassy issues some 9,000 visas each year to Libyans.  11. (C) Comment: The GOL's reflexive efforts to attack Swiss commercial interests and cease issuing visas to Swiss citizens underscore the extent to which the regime treats business as an extension of politics and the sensitivity of anything to do with the al-Qadhafi family.  Von Muralt dismissed the possibility that his mission would be threatened by angry Libyans.  Noting that Switzerland is a large source of second-hand vehicles (a sizeable market in Libya) and a popular venue for medical care and banking for well-heeled Libyans, he said several non-official Libyans had privately expressed the wish that the Swiss had kept Hannibal, who is unpopular here, in custody.  He also noted that the single remaining Swiss Air and Air Afriqiyah flights were booked with Libyan elites, who would not view favorably a complete cessation of direct air connections to Geneva.  Hannibal's repeated falls from grace highlight the broad gulf between average Libyans, who view the al-Qadhafi family as unsophisticated upstarts from a historically inconsequential part of the country (Sirte) who routinely embarrass Libya, and senior regime officials, who view the state as an extension of the al-Qadhafi family empire.  The Swedish ambassador, who is based in Tunis but accredited to Libya, told CDA on July 21 that the "deep-seated, visceral" hatred many Libyans feel for the al-Qadhafi family has grown in recent years to the point that he does not expect that one of al-Qadhafi's children will be able to succeed Muammar al-Qadhafi.  He was posted in Tripoli in 1986-1990, and said the popular perception of the ruling family has deteriorated considerably since then, in part because al-Qadhafi's sons have comported themselves so poorly as they have come of age.

Godfrey, CDA, U.S. Embassy - Tripoli, Dept of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C)  Summary: An ongoing dialogue between the quasi-governmental Qadhafi Development Foundation (QDF) and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) has resulted in the release and reintegration of some 130 former LIFG fighters into Libyan society thus far (reftels).  The dialogue, initially led directly by Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi's son Saif al-Islam, aims to convince LIFG members in Libyan detention facilities to renounce violence and resume their lives as normal Libyan citizens.  Approximately 90 LIFG members remain in Libyan prisons; discussions with them are ongoing and it is expected that they may be released soon.  End Summary.  2. (U)  Saleh Abdulsalam Saleh, Director of the Human Rights Committee of the QDF and a senior adviser to Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, provided an update on July 13 to CDA and Poloff regarding the QDF-LIFG dialogue.  FORTY ADDITIONAL FIGHTERS RELEASED IN JUNE  3. (C)  According to Saleh, talks between the QDF and LIFG have thus far resulted in the release of 131 former LIFG fighters - 91 in April (ref B) and an additional 40 in June.  Saleh carefully emphasized that the talks were part of "a dialogue", vice negotiations, that had been underway for over a year and a half under the personal patronage of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, son of Muammar al-Qadhafi.  Saleh described the dialogue as unconditional, noting that the only thing required of LIFG members was " ... a willingness to change ideas on the use of violence".  He stressed that the dialogue emphasizes the reintegration of former fighters, particularly with respect to helping them secure work after their release.  He also confirmed press reports that the QDF had paid 10,000 Libyan dinar (about 8,300 USD) to each released fighter to help them re-establish themselves after their release, and had additionally paid monthly stipends to former fighters until they secured jobs.  He said the "vast majority" of those released in April and June had already secured work; only a small number remained unemployed.  QDF USES OUTSIDE MEDIATORS TO FACILITATE DISCUSSIONS  4. (C)  Saleh said that Ali al-Salabi and Numan Ben Othman (the latter is a former LIFG member), usually accompanied by a QDF official, have represented the QDF in the dialogue. (Note: al-Salabi resides in Dubai and Ben Othman resides in London; both travel to Libya for their mediation work.  End note.) Abdullah al-Sadiq, Abu Munther al-Saadi, and Abu Hazim al-Sharif have represented the LIFG leadership.  The semi-official QDF mediators meet with the LIFG leadership at the Abu Salim prison, located on the outskirts of Tripoli, every two to three weeks. (Note: The Abu Salim prison is formally managed by military police; however, it is the facility at which most political prisoners are housed and the Internal Security Organization (ISO) plays a large role in administering it.  End note.) The most recent meeting took place in mid-June; it is expected that the next will take place in early August.  THE LIFG IS NO LONGER JUDGED TO BE A VIABLE ORGANIZATION INSIDE LIBYA  5. (C)  Saleh characterized the LIFG as "not present on the ground in Libya", noting that the vast majority the known remaining members in Libya - about 90 individuals - are currently in Libyan government detention. (Note: A number of individuals affiliated with the LIFG are outside Libya.  End note.) The LIFG as a terrorist organization is "completely gone", Saleh said.  The QDF remains in contact with the 131 fighters released to date through local administrative authorities ("lajnaat al-shabiya"), and the QDF and Libyan authorities monitor former LIFG members to ensure they have "become citizens again and have peaceful ideas".

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Apparently seeking to balance perceptions of recent overtures to the U.S. and Italy, Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi conducted a five-day visit to Russia, Belarus and Kiev.  Expectations that major agreements for large military equipment sales, gas exports and an "OPEC for natural gas" appear to have been inflated - al-Qadhafi left Moscow with a framework agreement for civilian nuclear cooperation and potential defense purchases in the future.  Russian Embassy officials in Tripoli implied, but did not state, that media reports that Libya had agreed to provide a naval base in Benghazi to the Russian navy were inaccurate.  They also expressed frustration at Libya's failure to implement previously concluded agreements, noting that the GOL had nonetheless pushed hard to sign a bevy of ill-prepared agreements during al-Qadhafi's visit.  Most local observers said that al-Qadhafi's visit was designed to signal to the U.S. and other western powers that despite its relatively recent reintegration into the international community, Libya is an independent actor that will seek to balance its engagement between East and West.  The relatively prominent role played by Muatassim al-Qadhafi, son of Muammar al-Qadhafi and National Security Adviser, suggests that he is becoming a more seriously-regarded player in the regime. End Summary.  AMID HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS, MEDIA ANTICIPATES MAJOR AGREEMENTS ...  2. (U) Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi made his first trip to Moscow since 1985 during a five-day, three-country tour of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.  Russian Poloff Evgeny Kozlov gave Poloff a readout of the Russia stop on November 5.  Al-Qadhafi's delegation included his son, National Security Adviser Muatassim al-Qadhafi, Foreign Minister Abudlrahman Shalgam, External Security Organization Director Musa Kusa, and National Oil Corporation Chairman Shukri Ghanem, all of whom held meetings and pursued negotiations on the margins.  Citing senior Russian and Libyan sources, media reports in the run-up to the visit predicted major defense, energy (natural gas) and nuclear agreements.  3. (C) Muatassim al-Qadhafi and Kusa arrived in the Kremlin in advance of al-Qadhafi for meetings with the Foreign Ministry and security officials, fueling expectations that Libya would sign long-awaited arms deals rumored to be worth upwards of USD two billion.  Russian Embassy officials told us in advance of the visit that a joint Russia-Libya military cooperation committee was working to finalize defense procurement contracts.  The failure to conclude contracts for sale of military equipment to Libya during the visit to Libya earlier this year by former President Putin had been a disappointment for the Kremlin (ref A).  Russian newspaper Russkiy Kommersant - the media organ in which Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, son and putative heir of Muammar al-Qadhafi previewed his announcement in mid-August of his intention to withdraw from politics - also reported at the outset of the visit that Tripoli would offer Russia the right to establish a naval base in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi. Multiple media reports claimed the two sides had also concluded a civilian nuclear agreement encompassing construction of nuclear power plants and nuclear medical cooperation.  4. (C) Rhetoric for the visit was grandiose, with much made of Russian-Libyan agreement on "strengthening the foundations of a multi-polar world and political settlement of conflict situations".  Referring to al-Qadhafi's crowning in August by African tribal leaders as "King of Kings" in Africa, Kozlov joked that al-Qadhafi now aspired to be "the Great Balancer" between East and West.  A range of diplomatic and private sector contacts in Tripoli attributed the timing of the visit to al-Qadhafi's desire to remind the world that he has options and is not beholden to the west in the wake of a recent colonial compensation agreement with Italy (ref B) and a comprehensive claims agreement for terrorism claims with the U.S.  Reiterating familiar themes, al-Qadhafi lamented that the world had become unipolar and unstable because of "violations of the balance of power".   ... RUSSIAN EMBASSY CONFIRMS ONLY ONE  TRIPOLI 00000870  002.2 OF 002    5. (C) Kozlov said the two sides ultimately signed only a general framework agreement for civilian nuclear cooperation that had been the subject of negotiations for several years. (Note: Per ref A, an MOU was signed during Putin's visit in April committing both sides to concluding a formal cooperation agreement on civilian uses of nuclear energy by the end of 2008.  End note.)  Kozlov refused to confirm that Libya had offered Russia use of a naval base in Benghazi, but seemed to downplay the possibility by stressing Russia's efforts to restore a large naval base in Tartus, Syria.  He confirmed that the Russian navy planned at least two more port calls in Libya by warships during 2009, following on last month's visit by a flotilla en route to Venezuela (ref C).  Kozlov said Muatassim al-Qadhafi discussed military cooperation and engaged in negotiations for big-ticket defense equipment sales, but gave no specifics and indicated nothing had been finalized.  6. (C) Moscow still hopes to reach agreement for an "OPEC for natural gas" with Libya, Qatar, and Iran; however, we were told the only energy agreement discussed in Moscow was a three-way deal between Gazprom, Eni, and Libya's National Oil Corporation to build additional pipelines and a refining facility in Libya. The GOL also offered to direct investment from its sovereign wealth fund to Russian firms hard hit by the global financial crisis, focusing particularly on those that had suffered losses on investments in U.S. markets and financial instruments.   LIBYA SHOOTS FOR THE MOON, RUSSIA DEMURES  7. (C) Echoing complaints we heard from Spanish counterparts in the wake of al-Qadhafi's visit to Madrid in December 2007 (ref D), Kozlov said Libyan officials "dusted off agreements that were still under negotiation" on the eve of the Moscow visit, expecting that they could be readied for signature.  Pointing to delays in implementing commercial and military agreements that constituted part of the agreement earlier this year to forgive USD 4.5 billion of Soviet-era debt, Kozlov bemoaned the fact that " ...the Libyans always want to sign everything, but only implement what they want - an agreement is only valid if both sides read it the same way".  According to media reports, stops in Minsk and Kiev saw technical agreements on prevention of double taxation and expressions of mutual cooperation in the energy sector.  Notably missing from public announcements were announcements of weapons sales, although media reports indicated al-Qadhafi discussed purchasing strategic and tactical airlift assets in Ukraine.  8. (C) Comment: Al-Qadhafi's itinerary and the trip's timing - he touched down in Moscow on the same day the final deposits were made in a humanitarian relief fund to compensate U.S. victims of Libyan acts of terrorism - suggested a desire to signal that Libya is not beholden to the west and still has foreign policy options, themes he touched on directly in his Revolution Day speech on August 31 (ref E).  While the GOL wants to preserve room for maneuver with respect to energy and arms purchases, several reliable Libyan interlocutors noted that Libya's relationship with Russia has never been genuinely warm. "Libyans believe Russians are too dour and are not trustworthy", one contact with regime ties told us.  The fact that Muatassim al-Qadhafi featured in the visits is an interesting development, suggesting that he is becoming a more seriously-regarded player in the regime.  Our Russian interlocutor bemoaned Moscow's lack of understanding of intra-Libyan regime dynamics, noting that Muatassim was initially scheduled to meet only mid-level bureaucrats until the Russian Embassy in Tripoli intervened to explain that he was a potential successor to his father.  His reports from Moscow were that Muatassim took a clear lead in his meetings, albeit with Musa Kusa at his side as an advisor, and comported himself reasonably well.  End comment.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) GOL officials are hurriedly pulling together arrangements for a meeting of heads of state from Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) member states, scheduled to take place in Tripoli June 10-13. MFA Secretary for European Affairs (U/S-equivalent) told the U.K. Ambassador on June 7 that the presidents of Mauritania, Algeria and Tunisia, together with Moroccan Prime Minister Abbas el-Fassi, would arrive June 10 for a meeting of the AMU. Egyptian PolCouns Ahmed Abdel Halim told P/E Chief on June 9 that the Egyptian Embassy had received the same information regarding participants and the notional dates.  Morocco has reportedly refused to be represented by King Muhammad VI because of ongoing disagreements with Algeria over the Western Sahara. (Note: Post's understanding is that a full quorum of AMU heads of state has not convened since 1994; the last senior-level meeting of the AMU, in mid-2005, was derailed in part by Morocco-Algeria contretemps.  End note.)  Echoing dynamics reported reftel, Abdel Halim said "there are concerns" that bad blood - between Algeria and Morocco, and between Libya and Mauritania (Mauritania has alleged Libyan complicity in an attempted coup in Nouakchott), among others - could derail what he described as "a Libyan initiative to reinvigorate the AMU".  2. (C) In typical fashion, the GOL has delayed finalizing preparations until the last minute.  Guests in Tripoli's only five-star hotel, including several official USG travelers, were informed late on June 8 that they would have to check out not later than June 9 by order of the GOL to make room for senior AMU leaders and their retinues.  Delegations are scheduled to begin arriving in Tripoli late on the afternoon of June 10.  The event is scheduled to kick off that evening with a late night coffee 'majlis', with formal meetings to follow on June 11 and 12.  3. (C) Abdel Halim confirmed reports in the Arabic-language newspaper al-Hayat and elsewhere that a visit to Libya by Syrian President Bashar al-Asad would coincide with the AMU meeting (local reports differ as to whether it will be labeled a "summit" or not).  Asad's arrival date had not been fixed, and the Egyptian Embassy's information was that it was still being decided whether he would participate in the AMU meeting as a guest observer, or would only make a cameo appearance and then have bilateral meetings with Muammar al-Qadhafi.  The Egyptian Ambassador had been told that Asad's Tripoli visit was part of a follow-on to his recent tour of Gulf states, where he thanked Arab heads of state who attended the recent Arab League Summit in Damascus.  Saying it was "expected" that Asad would have discussions with al-Qadhafi and other AMU leaders on the Middle East Peace Process and Syria's negotiations with Israel over the Golan, Abdel Halim said there was considerable confusion about what else might be on the agenda for the AMU meeting.  Abdel Halim said the Egyptian Embassy in Tripoli had not yet been informed whether Egyptian President Husni Mubarak would also travel to Tripoli to join the conclave, but noted that many GOL officials appeared to believe that Mubarak would come.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: In a strongly worded speech at what was characterized as a mini-Arab League summit, Muammar al-Qadhafi sharply criticized a French-backed Mediterranean Union proposal, claiming that attempts to incentivize southern Mediterranean states with investment schemes were insulting.  Claiming that the new entity would undermine Arab and African member states' commitments to the Arab League (AL)and African Union (AU), respectively, he suggested that an alternative could be formal EU cooperation with the AL and AU, to be coordinated through the headquarters of the latter two organizations.  A visit to Tripoli by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair coincided with the mini-summit; al-Qadhafi reportedly told Blair he was concerned that the Mediterranean Union proposal represented an effort by southern European states to create a de facto North African bulwark against illegal migration from sub-Saharan Africa, and to "further legitimize" Israel at the expense of Arab states.  End summary.  2. (U) At a mini-Arab League (AL) summit meeting in Tripoli on June 10, Muammar al-Qadhafi made a strong case against a Mediterranean Union modeled on and linked to the European Union (EU), an idea championed by French President Nicholas Sarkozy that would comprise the 27 EU nations and a dozen non-EU countries located along the southern Mediterranean littoral. The meeting was attended by heads of state from Mauritania, Algeria, Tunis and Syria, and by Moroccan Prime Minister Abbas el-Fassi.  Originally billed to some Arab diplomats in Tripoli as an Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) summit plus Syrian President Bashar al-Asad and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (ref A), late innings controversy about the refusal of King Muhammad VI of Morocco to attend reportedly prompted the Government of Libya (GOL) to recast the event as a mini-AL summit.  3. (U) Orchestrated by al-Qadhafi, the Tripoli meeting was designed to muster Arab opposition to the Mediterranean Union proposal in advance of a broader gathering in Paris on July 13 to formally unveil the plan.  In a strongly-worded opening address, al-Qadhafi characterized the French proposal as an attempt to undermine the unity of Arab League and African Union member states.  Describing Sarkozy's proposal as "a passing fad", he likened it to the failed Barcelona Process initiated in 1995, and said attempts to incentivize AL and AU states to join the new union with large-scale investment proposals were "an insult".  Striking a populist tone, he stressed that Arab and African states were "not hungry to this extent; we're not dogs that they can wave a bone in front of and we'll run after it". Arab and African unity "should not be sacrificed for transient investment projects".  Emphasizing that member states' commitments to the extant AL and AU trumped those to any nascent Mediterranean Union, he suggested that a viable alternative to a new structure could be formal cooperation between the EU and AL and AU states, to be coordinated through AL headquarters in Cairo and AU headquarters in Addis Ababa.  Al-Qadhafi's sarcastic references to "my dear Sarkozy" took observers by surprise and has left some wondering whether the bonhomie engendered by the latter's visit to Tripoli in July 2007 has begun to ebb.  French diplomats in Tripoli offered no comment, noting only that they had not yet received instructions from Paris on whether or how to respond.  4. (C) Al-Qadhafi was the only leader to offer public remarks before the meeting adjourned to a reportedly heated session of principals plus one.  Egyptian and Algerian diplomats told us Morocco was isolated in its support for the Mediterranean Union proposal and by the fact that it was represented at the PM, vice head of state, level.  Libyan MFA interlocutors conceded that a closing statement had been expected and desired by al-Qadhafi; however, the group was unable to achieve consensus on its position concerning the union, let alone language for a summary statement.  In a further sign of discord, President Mubarak ultimately did not attend (he cited a heavy schedule), despite persistent efforts by al-Qadhafi to lure him to Tripoli to broker a truce with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad.  The Egyptian PolCouns told us al-Qadhafi called Mubarak twice - once while in the car with Asad on their way into town from the airport - to urge him to come to Tripoli (further details on Asad's visit were reported ref B)  5. (C) The mini-AL summit coincided with a visit to Tripoli on June 10 by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.  U.K. Deputy Head of Mission Mark Matthews told P/E Chief June 11 that al-Qadhafi stressed to Blair in their private meeting concern that Sarkozy's proposal represented an effort by southern European states to create a de facto North African bulwark against illegal migration from sub-Saharan Africa. Recapitulating themes we've heard publicly here, al-Qadhafi insisted the key to mitigating illegal migration flows to Europe  TRIPOLI 00000457  002.2 OF 002   was to reduce "push" factors by promoting greater development in source countries.  The two specifically discussed the possibility of Libyan investment in Sierra Leone and Rwanda, countries in which Blair's charitable foundation has a strong interest (further details on Blair's visit septel).  Al-Qadhafi also voiced suspicion that the Mediterranean Union could be used as a forum in which to encourage further Arab-Israeli rapprochement as a means by which to "further legitimize" Israel at the expense of the Arabs.  6. (C) Comment: Al-Qadhafi's speech offers a snapshot of Libya's unique vision of overlapping pan-Arab and pan-African aspirations.  While striking vintage pan-Arab themes - "we are fully committed to the Arab League, which we hope will one day lead us to an eventual Arab union" - he was also careful to stress that Arab Maghreb states were African and had responsibilities to their sub-Saharan counterparts that trumped any notional partnership with Europe.

REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary:  A respected Libyan journalist was jailed on charges that a column he wrote criticizing the government's poorly-coordinated urban development efforts had incited negative public opinion and called into question the "people's authority".  Released from prison pending trial after the intervention of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, the case may stem from tension between Saif al-Islam and the Prime Minister, who has reportedly led the charge to try and sentence the journalist. End summary.  JOURNALIST JAILED  2. (C) Opposition websites reported in early May that Muhammad Tarnesh, a journalist and Executive Director of the Human Rights Society of Libya (HRSL - affiliated with the Qadhafi Development Foundation), was arrested and charged in connection with a column he wrote criticizing the fact that after twenty-five years of inactivity in the area of urban development, the Government of Libya (GOL) had undertaken a hasty, poorly coordinated campaign of housing and infrastructure development that featured as its primary accomplishment to date the seemingly random destruction of large numbers of residences and businesses.  Lamenting the suffering caused by the widespread "'Izaala" campaign (a word that translates as "removal", and is written on buildings slated for destruction), Tarnesh's column pointedly asked readers whether anyone had seen the homes of government ministers destroyed.  3. (C) Tarnesh's column first appeared on April 1 in the "Maal wa A'mal" newspaper, published by al-Izdihar Press in Misurata. Tarnesh was subsequently arrested, the paper's editor-in-chief, Khalifa Muqattaf was questioned and al-Izdihar Press was closed by order of the Secretary of the General People's Committee for Information, Nuri Hmeidi.  The column was subsequently posted in early May on the website "Libya al-Youm" ("Libya Today"). "Libya al-Youm" reported that a group of prominent Libyan journalists had met at the Journalists' League in Tripoli in early May to express solidarity with Tarnesh and Muqattaf and criticize the GOL's abuse of restrictive press laws to muzzle criticism.  CHARGES MAY STEM FROM PERSONAL ANIMUS BETWEEN SAIF AL-ISLAM AND PRIME MINISTER  4. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E Chief on May 28 that he was arrested on three charges in late April under Press Act 76 of 1972: 1) inciting negative public opinion; 2) criticizing the leaders of the Revolution, and; 3) casting doubt on the ability of secretaries of the General People's Committees (GPC's), and thereby questioning the "people's authority".  xxxxxxxxxxxx was in custody for some 10 days during the initial part of the investigation.  Officials from the Prosecutor General's office told him Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi had taken particular umbrage at Tarnesh's column, had orchestrated his arrest and had evinced a personal interest in seeing Tarnesh tried and sentenced.  Al-Mahmoudi, who was widely rumored to have fallen from favor with Leader Muammar al-Qadhafi and was expected to have been sacked at the March session of the General People's Conference, is reportedly highly sensitive to criticism of development projects, in part because Housing and Infrastructure Board Chairman Dorda - a more charismatic figure - has received credit for the progress that has been made while al-Mahmoudi has born the brunt of criticism.  Hoping to forestall criticism and possibly save his job, al-Mahmoudi undertook a poorly-received campaign of personal appearances and press availability sessions at a number of housing and infrastructure sights in the run-up to the March session of the General People's Congress.  After officials from the quasi-governmental Qadhafi Development Foundation (QDF), headed by Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, intervened with the Prosecutor General's office, Tarnesh was ultimately released from prison pending his trial.  5. (C) Noting that officials from the Prosecutor General's office told him they believed the charges were frivolous and unlikely to stand up in court, xxxxxxxxxxxx offered that he would personally be less confident about his case if it were not for the personal interest of Saif al-Islam, who was following his case and who, according to QDF Executive Director Dr. Yusuf Sawani, had personally raised it with al-Mahmoudi. (Note: xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E Chief that Saif al-Islam had personally recruited him to head the HRSL because he was an avid reader of his columns and appreciated xxxxxxxxxxxx's willingness to openly question GOL officials' competence.  End note.)  Al-Mahmoudi had persisted in his efforts to have xxxxxxxxxxxx re-incarcerated until  TRIPOLI 00000494  002 OF 002   his trial, so far to no avail.  Claiming it was well-known that al-Mahmoudi and Saif al-Islam didn't see eye-to-eye, xxxxxxxxxxxx said some had speculated that al-Mahmoudi orchestrated xxxxxxxxxxxx's prosecution to strike an oblique blow at Saif al-Islam.  As it stood, xxxxxxxxxxxx believed he stood a good chance of being acquitted on all three charges; the next hearing is scheduled for late-June.  Laughingly noting that there was "no such thing as justice in Libya", xxxxxxxxxxxx joked that it was fortunate for him that a son of the Leader with no official position (a reference to Saif al-Islam) could trump a Prime Minister.  ARTICLE STRIKES A CHORD  6. (C)    Post spoke with a number of Libyans who had read xxxxxxxxxxxx's column.  The broad consensus was that xxxxxxxxxxxx had given voice to commonly held frustration with what they view as an arbitrary and fruitless "development" program. (Note: xxxxxxxxxxxx is a regular columnist and is well and favorably known in Libya's sterile media environment as the author of articles that gently criticize and poke fun at government incompetence and inconsistencies.  End note.)  A young taxi driver who had until recently managed his family's clothing store on Djeraba Street complained bitterly that the GOL had given his family less than a week's notice that the store was slated for destruction, and had ultimately provided compensation for only one-tenth of its value.  Noting that he had to delay his wedding because his family finances had suffered, he echoed comments by other Tripolitanians to the effect that the development projects and related destruction of existing structures had been badly coordinated by the GOL.  7. (C) Comment: xxxxxxxxxxxx's case underscores the personal and at times petty nature of intra-regime politics in Libya, where the limits of public discourse remain narrowly circumscribed.  It is blatantly obvious to local observers that the rush to tear down old facades and put up new buildings as evidence of the revolution's benefits (keyed to the 40th anniversary of the revolution, which will fall on September 1, 2009) has placed a considerable burden on a system characterized by limited capacity.  Libya, however, remains a place where one does not lightly tell the emperor he has no clothes.  End comment. STEVENS</a></h3><p>Tags: PGOV PREL PHUM PINR LY - 08TRIPOLI494</p></li>

<li><h3><a href='/mobile/cables/08TRIPOLI666.html'>LIBYAN REACTION TO CLAIMS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT POSITIVE, HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR U.S. INFLUENCE ON AL-QADHAFI  TRIPOLI 00000666  001.5 OF 002   CLASSIFIED BY: Chris Stevens, CDA, Embassy Tripoli, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) Summary: Reaction among ordinary Libyans and well-informed contacts to news that the U.S. and Libya finalized a comprehensive claims settlement agreement has been enthusiastic.  Coverage in state-owned media has been positive but limited, in part to minimize questions about the parameters of the compensation package and potential criticism from old guard elements.  Some informed contacts have characterized the agreement as a "grand opening" in U.S.-Libyan bilateral relations, as compared to the "soft opening" between the re-establishment of diplomatic ties in 2004 and the signing of the claims agreement in 2008.  There are high expectations in some quarters that the U.S. will seek to capitalize on the new tenor of the relationship to press Muammar al-Qadhafi to open further political space - particularly with respect to respect for human rights, freedom of the press and an expanded role for civil society - in what remains a tightly-controlled society. End summary.  OFFICIAL MEDIA REACTION POSITIVE, BUT NOT EXTENSIVE  2. (C) The reaction of state-owned media and the public to news of the comprehensive claims settlement agreement signed on August 14 during the visit to Tripoli by NEA A/S David Welch has been positive.  State-owned Libyan television and newspapers carried coverage and articles August 14-16 highlighting comments by MFA Secretary for the Americas Dr. Ahmed Fituri to the effect that the agreement had " ... opened new horizons for Libyan-American relations, based on mutual respect, and serious and productive cooperation, which will result in progress and prosperity for both countries and their peoples".  Fituri also stressed that the agreement represented the turning over of a new leaf in bilateral U.S.-Libya relations and was expect to facilitate improved people-to-people relations between the two countries.  Longer term reaction in state-owned press has been limited; there have not been editorials or analytical pieces extolling the benefits of the agreement or predicting commercial windfalls as there were in the wake of French President Nicholas Sarkozy's visit in July 2007, or Muammar al-Qadhafi's visits to Madrid and Paris in December 2007.  MFA Americas DeskOff Muhammad Ayab told us the GOL had chosen not to highlight the U.S.-Libya agreement in the press to mitigate potential questions about the parameters of the deal (the GOL has not released publicly the amount of the humanitarian fund that is to compensate U.S. and Libyan victims) and to avoid potential backlash from old guard elements who might criticize the regime for having "capitulated" to the U.S.  REACTION AMONG LIBYANS POSITIVE ...  3. (C) The observed reaction among Libyans has been very positive.  Shopkeepers, dry cleaners, neighbors and taxi drivers have all expressed effusive congratulations to Emboffs in the week since the agreement was signed.  Locally-engaged staff have been equally enthusiastic, offering felicitations and expressing hope that an important corner in bilateral relations has indeed been turned.  Reaction among well-connected and informed contacts - typically a more hard-bitten, reserved group - has also been positive.  The expectation is that resolution of the key outstanding political irritant will facilitate more robust U.S. commercial involvement in Libya and help remove the specter of a potential relapse into the "bad old days" of sanctions, a fear fueled by the decision of the U.S. Congress to pass the Lautenberg Amendment in January 2008.  4. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx scion of a well-connected, wealthy Benghazi-based family prominent in key business sectors, likened the agreement to a "grand opening" of U.S.-Libyan bilateral relations after the 2004-2008 "soft opening" during the period between re-establishment of diplomatic ties and finalization of the claims agreement.  xxxxxxxxxxxx described the agreement as "a remarkable achievement", noting that he had not believed it possible for the U.S. and Libya to resolve such a complicated issue so quickly.  xxxxxxxxxxxx noted for us that while he was "delighted" at the news of the important agreement and "expected great things", he had lost 100 L.D. in a bet with colleague (al-Obeidi wagered that the deal would not be finalized and signed before the U.S. presidential elections in November).  ... BUT EXPECTATIONS HIGH THAT U.S. WILL PRESSURE AL-QADHAFI ON POLITICAL SPACE, HUMAN RIGHTS  5. (C) While reaction to news of the agreement has been  TRIPOLI 00000666  002.2 OF 002   positive, there are high expectations in some quarters that the U.S. will pressure al-Qadhafi and the GOL more publicly and directly to open further political space in what remains a closed, tightly-controlled society.  Acting on Libyan state media reports that the Secretary planned to visit soon in the wake of the agreement, a journalist and human rights activist called P/E Chief to express hope that she would press for greater press and civil society freedoms during her expected visit.  The contact, who is under indictment for authoring an editorial criticizing ill-coordinated government development programs, expressed frustration that public rhetoric about reform has not been consistent with the results to date. Echoing the soft opening/grand opening formulation, a contact who works for the Ministry of Justice-equivalent and the Ministry of Interior-equivalent told us he hopes the U.S. will now pressure the GOL more directly to pursue needed legal reforms. (Note: Libya's legal code, an amalgam of Italian, British and Islamic Shari'a law, has not been substantially revised since the 1950's.  We understand that a draft of a new legal code is currently being reviewed by various government ministries.  End note.)  6. (C) A contact in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, told us that Benghazi residents had expressed hope on hearing of the agreement that the U.S. would seek to capitalize on the new tenor of the relationship to press the GOL for improved respect for human rights.  Of particular concern, for residents of the eastern province of Cyrenaica is the case of detained human rights activist Fathi el-Jahmi, who hails from a prominent tribe there.  Easterners, a number of whom regard el-Jahmi as a symbol of courageous resistance against what they perceive as an illegitimate regime,  have been "disappointed" that the U.S. did not push harder and more publicly for el-Jahmi's release.  They also felt that the U.S. "disappointed" their expectations in 2004-2008 (i.e., before the agreement was signed) by not pressing al-Qadhafi harder to open further political space. "Frankly", our contact said, "we are now hoping that the U.S. does what we all expected it to do during the past four years - to make it clear to the al-Qadhafi clan that their 35 year period of honey is over".  Easterners have also been frustrated that Cyrenaica has not benefited economically under al-Qadhafi's regime to the extent that Tripoli, Sirte and other areas viewed more favorably by the regime have.  7. (C) Comment: Libyan reaction to news of the U.S.-Libya claims settlement agreement is a mixture of relief and high expectation.  Libyans are genuinely pleased that a key political irritant in the bilateral relationship has been resolved, seemingly reducing the likelihood that U.S.-Libya relations could lapse back into something akin to the sanctions period. There is also the belief that expanded political and economic engagement with the U.S. and the West, which is expected to accelerate with the lifting of the Lautenberg Amendment and potential asset seizure, will help solidify internal Libyan reforms undertaken in recent years.  Many Libyans hope that expanded engagement with the U.S. will include U.S. advocacy for political reform and greater respect for human rights.  A key challenge for al-Qadhafi will be to temper expectations that fully normalized relations with the U.S. will prompt an immediate shift in the nature of the regime and its reluctance to move quickly on political reform.
