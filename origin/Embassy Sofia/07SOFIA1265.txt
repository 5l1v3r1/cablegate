PolOff delivered reftel demarche to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Head of the Department for UN and Global Issues, 
Kamen Velichkov on October 22.  Velichkov said that Bulgaria 
fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Advisor Ibrahim 
Gambari and will follow the EU's strong stance on this issue. 
 He noted that the situation in Burma is serious because of 
the human rights violations, the deprivation of political 
rights, and Burma's lack of prospects for development. 
Velichkov is hopeful that the international community will 
come to a consensus or quasi-consensus on the Burma 
situation.  PolOff separately delivered reftel demarche to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Human Rights expert Christina 
Yotova on October 26, who promised to communicate the U.S. 
position to the Director of Human Rights, Andrei Tehov.
