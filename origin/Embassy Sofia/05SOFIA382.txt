¶1. (SBU) The Bulgarian parliament passed a motion on 24 
February that will send an additional 30 troops to 
participate in the International Security Assistance 
Force (ISAF).  This will raise Bulgaria's total ISAF 
troop commitment to 65. Bulgaria also has 7 soldiers 
participating in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to the Bulgarian Ministry of 
Defense, the new contingent will be made up of staff 
officers, an intelligence and counterintelligence 
group, a military police unit and a medical team.  The 
extra troops fulfill Bulgaria's commitments made during 
the NATO Force Generation Conference in November.
