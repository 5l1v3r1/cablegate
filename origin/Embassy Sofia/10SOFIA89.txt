Â¶1. (SBU) Post delivered ref demarche to Milena Yotova of the 
Human Rights Directorate at the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA).  Yotova welcomed our recommendations for the 
U.N. Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) 
of Iran and pledged to review them in detail.  Bulgaria is 
undecided on whether to make a statement about Iran during 
the UPR session.  Yotova mentioned that in response to a 
recent European Union (EU) demarche, the Director of the 
Human Rights Directorate in the MFA held a meeting with the 
Iranian Ambassador in Bulgaria to express Bulgarian and EU 
concerns about the human rights situation in Iran.
