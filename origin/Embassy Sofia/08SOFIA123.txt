MFA's Daniela Boudinova, State Expert on Nuclear Issues, Arms 
Control and International Security Department.  Ms. Boudinova 
said that Bulgaria supports the United States position in 
both reftels regarding IAEA Director General El Baradei's

for Safeguards Olli Heinonen's February 25 briefing on Iran's 
failure to comply with its UNSC obligation.  Ms. Boudinova 
said Bulgaria supports the idea of a new UNSC resolution 
regarding the Iranian Nuclear program.
