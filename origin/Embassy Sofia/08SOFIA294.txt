We delivered reftel demarche to Bulgaria's Ambassador to Iraq 
Valeri Ratchev (resident in Sofia) on May 9.  Ratchev said 
Foreign Minister Kalfin would be unable to attend because of 
an earlier commitment.  Deputy Foreign Minister Churov will 
lead a delegation of 3-4.  Ratchev said Bulgaria was not 
planning to provide assistance on a bilateral basis but would 
join multilateral efforts, including through the EU and other 
European organizations.
