SUBJECT: FOLLOW-UP REQUEST - DETAINED U.S. GAUGES FROM 
BULGARIA 
 
REF: STATE 124121 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request - please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to MFA representative 
Elizabeth Konstantinova on 2 August.  She agreed to convey 
our request for continued detention of the gauges and 
information on the truck's routing to inter-ministerial 
colleagues and to respond to us with a formal reply.  RSO has 
also shared reftel talking points unofficially with 
operational counterparts at the agencies responsible for the 
detention -- the National Border Police service of the 
Ministry of Interior and the Bulgarian Nuclear Regulatory 
Agency (NRA). 
 
¶3. (SBU) RSO reports that the Border Police is willing to 
detain the U.S.-origin cargo pending further word from us. 
They are awaiting official instructions from Interior 
Ministry leadership and the NRA before releasing the driver, 
truck, and non-U.S.-origin cargo to proceed to Iran.  They do 
not expect this official authorization to come before the 
week of August 7.  Contacts at the Border Police service said 
that their most immediate concern is lack of a suitable place 
to store the U.S.-origin gauges in the interim. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post requests additional information, as available, 
on the status of our discussions with HMG, practical next 
steps for Bulgaria, and options for interim storage of the 
gauges.  We believe that sharing such information with the 
GOB will facilitate their compliance with our request.
