TAGS: PGOV PHUM PREL LY BU
SUBJECT: BULGARIA LOOKS TO U.S. FOR "PUSH" ON LIBYA

REF: TRIPOLI 60

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JOHN BEYRLE, FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).

¶1. (C) SUMMARY: IN A MARCH 23 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, FOREIGN MINISTER KALFIN EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT NEGOTIATIONS ON THE RELEASE OF BULGARIAN NURSES IN LIBYA WERE "GOING INTO SLEEP MODE" AND SUGGESTED THAT A HIGH-LEVEL PUSH FROM THE U.S. SIDE MIGHT BE THE BEST NEAR-TERM CHANCE OF GETTING TALKS BACK ON TRACK. END SUMMARY.

¶2. (C) KALFIN'S FRUSTRATION WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT, DESPITE AGREEMENT FROM ALL SIDES ON A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR MOVING FORWARD, MOVEMENT TOWARD THE NURSES' EVENTUAL RELEASE IS STALLED DUE TO DELAYS IN THE SCHEDULING OF A NEW TRIAL AND LACK OF PROGRESS IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES. KALFIN SAID HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS A "DIFFICULT TIME FOR QADHAFI" AND NOTED THAT RECENT EVENTS IN BENGHAZI HAVE SHOWN THAT THE LIBYAN LEADER "IS NOT MASTERING THE SITUATION." CITING THE LIBYAN COURT'S UPCOMING SUMMER RECESS, KALFIN EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE COURT'S FAILURE TO SET A DATE FOR THE NURSES' RETRIAL COULD CAUSE THE ENTIRE PROCESS TO STALL. ACCORDING TO A REPORT RECEIVED BY KALFIN ON MARCH 22, THE LIBYAN COURT IS CONSIDERING HOLDING THE NEW TRIAL IN BENGHAZI, RATHER THAN TRIPOLI AS REPORTED IN REFTEL. KALFIN FELT THAT A BENGHAZI TRIAL WOULD FURTHER COMPLICATE PROGRESS TOWARD A FAVORABLE RESOLUTION.

¶3. (C) WHEN ASKED BY THE AMBASSADOR WHETHER A NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL MEETINGS COULD HELP ADVANCE THE PROCESS, KALFIN WAS PESSIMISTIC, STATING THAT THERE WAS "NOTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL." IN ORDER FOR MULTILATERAL MEETINGS TO SUCCEED, HE SAID, IT WOULD FIRST BE NECESSARY FOR THE LIBYAN SIDE TO PROPOSE A TRIAL DATE, A PLAN FOR THE FAMILIES, AND AN ULTIMATE DEADLINE FOR RETURN OF THE MEDICS.

¶4. (C) REFERRING TO RECENT TALKS WITH THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT ON DEBT FORGIVENESS, KALFIN SAID THE GOB IS WILLING TO ACCEPT ANY LIBYAN PROPOSAL FOR REVALUATION OF THE DEBT -- "TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR TO FIVE DOLLARS" -- AS LONG AS IT IS PART OF A FINAL SETTLEMENT. HOWEVER, THE BULGARIAN SIDE SEES LITTLE POINT IN NEGOTIATING A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH LIBYA ON DEBT REVALUATION WHILE THE FATE OF THE MEDICS REMAINS UNRESOLVED.

¶5. (C) KALFIN EMPHASIZED THE GOB'S ATTEMPTS TO EXERCISE PUBLIC RESTRAINT ON THE ISSUE IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE A PRODUCTIVE ATMOSPHERE FOR NEGOTIATIONS. HE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THAT BULGARIA HAD STOPPED THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE FROM ISSUING A RESOLUTION ON THE ISSUE ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS, BUT HE NOTED THAT SUCH A POSITION WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE INDEFINITELY. KALFIN ALSO GAVE A READOUT OF PRESIDENT PURVANOVS MARCH 1 PHONE CONVERSATION WITH QADHAFI, STATING THAT IT WAS BROADLY POSITIVE, IF NOT PARTICULARLY SUBSTANTIVE. ACCORDING TO KALFIN, QADHAFI WAS ENGAGED AND APPEARED WELL-INFORMED ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE, HOWEVER, "YOU NEVER KNOW WITH QADHAFI."

¶6. (C) COMMENT: IN KALFIN'S WORDS: "IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT INFLUENCES THE LIBYAN POLICY, IT IS THE U.S. POSITION." THE BULGARIANS CONTINUE TO SEE WASHINGTON AS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL INTERNATIONAL PARTY TO THE ONGOING TALKS WITH LIBYA, AND WANT US TO USE OUR INFLUENCE TO KEEP THINGS MOVING. WE BELIEVE THE PREREQUISITES FOR A MULTILATERAL MEETING OUTLINED BY KALFIN IN PARA. 3 ABOVE ARE A BIT STRICT (SURELY THERE CAN BE A MEETING IN ADVANCE OF SETTING A DEADLINE) BUT WOULD WELCOME VIEWS FROM USLO AND WASHINGTON ON NEXT STEPS. END COMMENT.
