¶1.  (SBU)  We delivered reftel demarche to MFA head of office 
for EU affairs Sergey Tassev on October 10.  Tassev said 
there were "no disagreements" with the US positions in the 
non-paper.  Kosovo and Libya were the most important issues 
for Bulgaria.  There were rumors that there was a new U.S. 
position paper on Kosovo, and possibly a new Russian paper as 
well.  Would the Troika be making its own proposal to the 
Serbs and Kosovars?  We replied that we had no information on 
the above papers and proposal and undertook to look into it. 
Tassev said his government was for strong EU engagement on 
Kosovo and supported going ahead with the ESDP Rule of Law 
mission after December 10. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On Libya, Tassev said Bulgaria wanted to normalize 
relations between Libya and Europe, though Libya liked to 
think of itself as "unique" and not lumped in with "other 
Euro-Med" relations.  On Iraq, Tassev said there was a new 
mood in the EU to be more involved on the humanitarian side 
and this would be discussed at the conference.  He said 
Bulgaria intends to join in EU humanitarian efforts but had 
no specifics.  On the EU Syria-Lebanon border mission, Tassev 
said Bulgaria favors the EU sending a fact finding mission to 
the border region before taking a decision to send an EU 
border mission.
