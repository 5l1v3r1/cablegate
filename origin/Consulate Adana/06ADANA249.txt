This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for November 28,

errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for

POLITICAL 
 
EVRENSEL:       Sinan Yerlikaya, Tunceli deputy from CHP, who said 
that nobody could negotiate with the (Turkish) state on 
terrorism, further stated that only when the PKK lays down its 
arms unconditionally, regulations about a general amnesty could 
be brought to the agenda. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Thirty-six institutions in Diyarbakir including 
mayors, leaders of political parties and civil society 
organizations, convened at the Diyarbakir Municipality's theater 
hall under the name of "Peace Platform" and made a call to the 
authorities to stop the ongoing military operations. 
 
EVRENSEL:       A lawsuit has been brought against Salih Yildiz, 
Mayor of Hakkari's Yuksekova district, for "making propaganda of 
the terrorist organization through utilizing media and press." 
 
YENI SAFAK:     DTP issued a statement that voiced harsh criticism 
against CHP Leader Deniz Baykal.  The statement claimed that the 
military operations had continued intensively following the 
cease-fire the PKK declared, and, despite much bloodshed since 
then, political and military circles, continued to take 
advantage of the environment of conflict and clashes.  The 
statement further said that the CHP leader, instead of behaving 
like a political leader, was actually acting like a commander. 
 
 
BOLGE:  Eric Green, U.S. Consul in Adana, came to Van to 
conduct a series of visits in the province.   Eric Green, who 
came to Van via Sun Express Airlines, paid his first visit to 
the Mayor of Van and held talks with him nearly for an hour.

EVRENSEL / BOLGE:       The troops with 250,000 soldiers that were 
amassed at the border area with northern Iraq are preparing to 
withdraw from the area where they have been deployed since March

and tanks and carrying soldiers have returned to Hakkari's 
Yuksekova district.

biggest live animal market in Turkey and the Middle East last
