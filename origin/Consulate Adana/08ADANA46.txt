SUBJECT: TURKEY: PKK CLAIMS ATTACK ON KIRKUK-CEYHAN PIPELINE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  A BOTAS official and local security contacts 
confirm press reports of a November 21 PKK-perpetrated terrorist 
attack on the Kirkuk-Ceyhan oil pipeline approximately 50 miles 
from the Iraqi border.  The alleged bomb explosion wrought a 
three-day inferno that was recently brought under control to 
allow for pipeline repair work.  We have conflicting information 
on whether oil is flowing.  Provincial counterterrorism 
officials warn of increased attacks in the coming weeks to mark 
the November 27 anniversary of the PKK's founding.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------- 
FLOWING OR NOT? 
---------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU)  Turkish mainstream media report on Friday, November 
21, shortly after 8:30 p.m., the terrorist organization PKK 
(Kurdistan Workers Party) detonated a bomb in the Taksoy 
district of Mardin province, some 50 miles from the Iraqi 
border.  Pro-Kurdish Firat News Agency credits the sabotage as 
the PKK's doing, reporting extensive damage to the pipeline with 
estimates that weeks will pass before crude oil flows again. 
BOTAS Petroleum Facilities Director Muzaffer Galay told us the 
pipeline has started to flow at low levels.  The pipeline is 
really two twined lines and he said one is working and one 
continues to be off-line.  His account differs from a Reuters 
report that cited an unnamed Energy Ministry official, who said 
repair of the pipeline started today, but the pipeline was still 
not functioning.  The official said the target was to bring it 
back online in less than a week.

PKK WILL STIR UP MORE TROUBLE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Provincial Counterterrorism Chief for Mardin Ergun 
Dagistanli told us gendarme units in Taksoy had sealed off the 
bomb site and were remaining tight-lipped about the incident and 
ensuing investigation.  He confirmed counterterrorism operations 
were continuing in areas of the province under his jurisdiction, 
and that he had raised the security-alert level in anticipation 
of potential attacks marking the 30th anniversary of the PKK's 
foundation (November 27).  Adana's Deputy Counterterrorism Chief 
Erhan Yildirim predicted local PKK organizers would take 
advantage of their anniversary by fomenting more street clashes 
and Molotov cocktail incidents in Adana's Kurdish-populated 
rural boroughs, and said to watch for terrorist attacks around 
Mount Amanos in Hatay province.  Galay told us BOTAS' initial 
assessment is that sabotage caused the explosion but said the 
investigation continues and the final determination could yield 
different results.

COMMENT 
------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  We agree with the assessments of both Yildirim and 
freelance Kurdish journalist Yilmaz Akinci -- the PKK is flexing 
its muscles yet again to show they are lethal and relevant.  PKK 
tactical leader Murat Karayilan has declared on many an occasion 
the organization's ability to damage Turkey's economy, and while 
this may hurt Iraq's pocketbook more immediately than Turkey's, 
it is embarrassing to a government trying to attract investors, 
enhance its regional energy role, and demonstrate stability. 
END COMMENT.
