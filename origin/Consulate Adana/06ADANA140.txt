POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
HURRIYET / ZAMAN / EVRENSEL / SABAH (GUNEY) / BOLGE:    A 
19-year-old person, who allegedly planned to place a bomb at the 
municipality building in Mersin's Tarsus district yesterday at 
noon, returned back to the street after he was reportedly 
discouraged by the metal detector at the gate of the building. 
The man put the bomb in front of a bookstore 80 meters away from 
the municipality.  People noticing the suspicious person caught 
him and called the police who safely detonated the bomb and 
arrested the man.  Evrensel daily claimed that the person, who 
was already being followed by the police, was caught red-handed. 
 
 
ZAMAN / RADIKAL / EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:      Semdinli case 
defendants placed a demand for the court to issue 
non-jurisdiction over the case, to refer it to a military court 
(since defendants were military personnel), and to expand the 
scope of the investigation at yesterday's hearing.  Van Third 
Heavy Penalty Court overturned such demands.  Whereas the 
defendants' attorneys claimed that there were attempts to reach 
a verdict "in haste" for the case, the litigants claimed 
defendants were trying to prolong the suit.  Nearly 10 
intelligence officers were again present at the courtroom, but 
no foreign observers attended yesterday's hearing.  Litigants' 
attorneys reiterated claims that Semdinli bombing was a product 
of an "organized act", and "its verdict will set an example to 
circles resorting to illegal methods in resolving the Kurdish 
issue." The court hearing has been adjourned to June 19. 
 
ZAMAN / EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:        Dogubeyazit provincial 
chairperson of DTP (Democratic Society Party) in Agri has 
recently been sentenced to one year in prison and a 500 YTL fine

statement "I regard Ocalan as representing my political will", 
were found in the chairperson's office. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Hatay deputy from ANAP (Motherland Party) submitted

EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:        Two families in Pinar village of

Geyiksuyu village (see press summary 06/12). 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Diyarbakir's Gun TV commented on recent news 
presented on media portraying RTUK (Higher Board of Radio and

broadcasts in different languages and dialects.  Gun TV 
broadcasting director said that such regulations had already 
been existent on the current regulations, and media was

unacceptable implementation that the journalist had been kept at 
the Jandarma command and his house had been searched for hours.
