DTP) came to the hearing to extend support to the women.  Tugluk 
addressed a 100-person group in front of the court hall and 
criticized the arrest of the women and the arrest of Ayhan 
Budak, Cizre Mayor (from DTP), on Newroz Day because of a speech 
he delivered. 
 
GUNDEM: DTP's agenda in early May will prioritize the 
unilateral cease-fire the PKK declared on October 1, 2006.  DTP

chairmen and party assembly to discuss and evaluate the issue. 
Meanwhile, Batman Democracy Platform, made a call to the 
authorities to respond to the PKK's call for ceasefire.

SABAH (GUNEY):  Karatas District Subgovernor's Office in Adana 
issued a decree for Metin Catalbas, the Mayor of Karatas, who

SECURITY: 
 
HURRIYET / CNN ONLINE / GUNDEM / ZAMAN:         The Sirnak 
Governor's Office announced that a mine blast killed a soldier 
in Sirnak on April 24. The coffin of the soldier will be sent to

mine planted by the PKK members in a rural section of Bitlis.

Kupeli Mounain of Sirnak on April 23 (see press summary for 
April 25), was caught alive yesterday. 
 
GUNDEM: A gun attack has been carried at DTP's Iskenderun 
chapter in Hatay the previous night.  Shot guns were used during 
the attack, the building was fired at, and, nobody was hurt 
since it was not during working hours.  DTP National 
Headquarters condemned the attack. 
 
ECONOMY: 
 
GUNDEM: A foundation called HISKAV (Hakkari Science, Health, 
Culture and Research Foundation) trained 60 women in Hakkari on 
"Cultivating Organic Vegetables" under an EU funded project. 
 
CRIME AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
 
HURRIYET:       Sirnak Governor's Office announced that jandarma 
launched a crackdown on an illegal network of human traffickers 
in Sirnak's Cizre district, caught 22 snakeheads, and 
 
ADANA 00000063  002 OF 002 
 
 
apprehended them.  Reportedly, the members of the network were 
assisting Iraqi people to enter Turkey illegally during their 
journey to Europe via Istanbul. 
 
HURRIYET / ZAMAN:       'Berdel' is a type of marriage practice, 
mostly seen among Kurds, in which a family offers a bride from 
their own family in compensation for the required bride-price 
they would pay to the other family whose daughter they will get 
as a bride for their son.  Three people died in a village of 
Malatya's Yazihan district because of a conflict that arose 
between two families when their 'berdel' deal was broken. The 
Kati family initially decided that their 14-year-old daughter 
should marry the son of Tay Family because the Tay Family wanted 
to get her in exchange for their 18-year-old girl whose marriage 
with the son of Kati family was already arranged.  When the Kati 
family decided later that their daughter was too young to marry 
and she preferred attend school instead of a getting married, 
the family settled with Tay Family to pay the bride-price 
instead of doing a berdel.  Violence ensued when the Tay Family 
still insisted to get the 14-year-old girl as a bride for their 
son, despite that they had reportedly already taken 5000 YTL 
bride-price for their own daughter.  Three people from the Tay 
Family opened fire on four members of the Kati Family yesterday 
morning, killed three people and wounded the other.  Jandarma 
detained the father of the Tay family and is now searching for 
the two other kin who were accomplices.  The girl has been given 
to her uncle for protection since her father died in the attack. 
 
CULTURE / SOCIETY / ENVIRONMENT 
 
HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    A "Chorus of Faiths" was established in 
Hatay and they performed for the first time during the visit of 
the Tourism Minister last week in Hatay as he paid a visit to 
the city to mark the Tourism Week (see press summary for April 
25). Chorus members are comprised of followers of diverse 
faiths, and, members from the Armenian community.  Faiths and 
sects include people from Sunni Muslims, Alevis, Catholics, 
Orthodox and Jewish people.  The idea for such a chorus was 
reportedly initiated by Hatay's Provincial Cultural and Tourism 
Director. 
 
HURRIYET:       Abdulkadir Aksu, Minister of Interior, and, Mehdi 
Eker, Minister of Agriculture and Village Works, whose hometowns 
are both in Diyarbakir, attended an event held in southern 
Antalya province which was held by a branch of the Solidarity 
Foundation for Promoting Diyarbakir and its Culture. Mr. Eker 
reportedly sang a song in Kurdish when a singer extended the 
microphone to the minister to join the singing.  The bodyguards 
of the minister prevented the journalists from taking footage as 
the minister was singing the song. 
 
HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    Mehdi Eker paid a visit to Mersin, 
conducted local studies there, and heard the issues and problems 
the citrus fruit growers had been experiencing.  Eker said they

increasing the amount of the yield per year. 
 
GUNDEM: The mass grave that allegedly buried Armenians and 
that was found by villagers on October 17, 2006 in a village of 
Mardin's Nusaybin district has been examined by a delegation 
comprised of members of Turkish History Authority and Swedish 
scholars.  The daily claimed that the examination frustrated the 
Swedish Professor David Gaunt, because the grave was reportedly 
destroyed and a scientific research could no longer be conducted 
there. Gaunt claimed that the photographs taken when the grave 
was first found showed many skulls, but their team found only a 
few bone remnants at the grave site.
