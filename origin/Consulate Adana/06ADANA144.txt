¶1.  (SBU) The Anti-Terror Branch of the Turkish National Police 
reported, to Consulate Adana's SD Supervisor, that the police 
had a tip regarding Turkish citizen Fahrettin Kocakaya (born in 
Diyarbakir in 1987).  They were  following him when he came to 
Tarsus and attempted to enter the Sub-Governor's Office building 
on June 13, 2006 carrying a plastic bag.  When he saw the police 
at the entrance, he panicked and turned around.  He left the bag 
in front of a nearby bookstore on Adana Street at which time the 
police detained him.  After investigating the contents of the 
bag, a bomb disposal team was called to the sight and safely 
detonated the package.  Follow-up reports from the police 
indicate that the package contained a remote controlled 
explosive, hand grenade, electrical fuse, cell phone, and 
battery.  When arrested Mr. Kocakaya had a cell phone, battery, 
and three Turk Cell pre-paid SIM cards on him. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Prior to his arrest, Fahrettin Kocakaya was staying 
with Remzi Kocakaya in Tarsus.  Subsequent to Fehrettin's 
arrest, Remzi's house was searched and bomb materials were found 
including a cigarette box filled with explosives, a welding 
machine, electrical fuses, and some wires.  Remzi Kocakaya was 
then arrested on charges of assisting and harboring a terrorist. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Adana Terror Unit Police Chief reports that 
Fahrettin Kocakaya also has been charged with the June 3, 2006 
bombing in Mersin in which a dozen people were wounded including 
one police officer (Ref:  Adana 000133).
