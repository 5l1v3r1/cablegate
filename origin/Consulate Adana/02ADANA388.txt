¶4.  SIIRT MAN SOUGHT BY INTERPOL ELECTED PARLIAMENTARIAN 
(Sabah)  The November 3 elections were the most interesting 
of all the parliamentary elections since the foundation of 
the Republic of Turkey.  For the first time, a political 
party whose chairman was barred from entering the 
Parliament won elections.  And for the first time, a 
person, Fadil Akgunduz, sought by Interpol with a red 
bulletin for fraud has been elected a parliamentarian. 
What makes the November 3 elections interesting is that the 
birthplace of these two victories is the same province: 
Siirt.  Siirt was the province where AKP leader Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan had recited a poem by Ziya Gokalp which 
resulted in his conviction and a ban from active politics. 
It was Siirt people who elected Akgunduz despite many cases 
of fraud opened against him.  Akgunduz received 11,450 
votes, becoming the third in Siirt after the Democratic 
People's Party (DEHAP) and AKP.  If someone has made a 
mistake, the judiciary must punish him," public employee 
Yusuf Alcan reacted.  Alcan claimed Akgunduz had been 
prevented from establishing an automobile factory (Jet 
Motor, which had earned him the name "Jet Fadil") in Siirt. 
He had made investments (in Siirt) amounting to USD 100 
million and he had TL 30 trillion (18.2 million) in the 
bank.  There are people who do not want any investments 
made in this region, Algan argued.  Support for "Jet Fadil" 
resulted from his being seen as a victim, from hope for 
employment, as well as ethnic origin solidarity, and his 
participation in rallies via telephone which caused Siirt 
people to burst into tears.  Siirt Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry President Nedim Kuzu said poverty and hopelessness 
opened the way for "Jet Fadil" and gave statistics:  Income 
per capita has fallen below USD 900 in Siirt, there is only 
the Kurtalan (Siirt) Cement Factory, which currently 
employs 250 people only.  Other plants are either 
inoperative or closed.
