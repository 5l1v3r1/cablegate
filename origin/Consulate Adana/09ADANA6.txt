SUBJECT: TURKEY:  ADANA REGION SEES SPIKE IN VIOLENCE IN LEAD-UP TO 
ANNIVERSARY OF OCALAN'S CAPTURE 
 
¶1.   (SBU) SUMMARY.  Increasing incidents of violence in 
Kurdish-populated areas of Adana's consular district may be 
related to the upcoming February 15 anniversary of the capture 
of PKK terrorist leader Abdullah Ocalan.  Local and regional 
anti-terrorism units are preparing for possible demonstrations, 
street clashes, and Molotov cocktail bombings as the date 
approaches.  Upcoming local elections in March may see more 
violence as the PKK seeks to demonstrate its continuing 
relevance and the government's impotence.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Adana:  Law enforcement contacts confirm press 
reports citing arson attacks on the evenings of January 27 and 
28, bringing the total number of such assaults to 17 in the past 
ten days.   In the first incident, unidentified assailants set 
fire to four civilian vehicles bearing Turkish flags on their 
windshields.  Firat news agency indicates the "Yektiya Ciwanen 
Kurdistan" group claimed responsibility.  In Adana, the last 
month has seen a significant rise in attacks against private 
vehicles displaying national Turkish symbols.  On the evening of 
the January 28, attackers threw Molotov cocktails and stones at 
storefronts in a commercial area.  Police reported no injuries, 
and have detained nine suspects. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Tarsus, Mersin Province: Provincial Counter-Terrorism 
Chief Salih Koken confirmed on Saturday, January 24, a group of 
people wearing ski masks attacked a city bus with two Molotov 
cocktails .  While the bus sustained damage, there were no 
reports of injuries.  No group has claimed responsibility for 
the attack, but law enforcement contacts suspect PKK 
sympathizers were behind it. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Sogut, Hatay Province:  According to military and 
media reports, on Saturday, January 24, the Kurdistan Workers' 
Party (PKK) terrorist organization detonated an explosive device 
near a transmitter station of Turkcell phone company.  One 
person was injured in the attack.  Adana's local security chief 
told us the attack bears all the markings of a PKK strike, and 
was likely planned to disrupt commercial activity. 
 
 ¶5.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Law enforcement officials in southeastern 
Turkey are readying themselves for increased violence in the 
lead-up to February 15, the 10th anniversary of Ocalan's capture 
in Kenya.  If past is prologue, police will follow their usual 
strategy of catch-and-release, or "preemptive detentions," to 
disrupt potential troublemakers and organizers of violence.  The 
looming March local elections provide another pretext for the 
PKK, which wants to stress Turkish-Kurdish divisions (and the 
Kurds' victim status).  DTP leader Ahmet Turk's has stated that 
the election results will be a referendum on the existence of 
the Kurds, meaning that voting for AKP is a denial of your 
Kurdishness.  END COMMENT.
