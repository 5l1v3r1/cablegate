POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
BOLGE:  Nuray D.(a 26-year-old female) was detained in Istanbul 
as a result of operations conducted by Adana's Provincial 
Jandarma Command Intelligence Branch Directorate.  She was 
charged with "improvising a bomb and using explosives," as well 
as with leaving a bomb suitcase in a disco in the Incirlik 
district of Adana in early February. (Note: Regarding the 
details of the event, see 2/3-press summary. End Note.) 
Witnesses have identified the detainee and an Adana court has 
initiated her prosecution. Nuray D. is allegedly a member of 
MLKP (Marxist Leninist Communist Party).  Her original targets 
were reportedly buildings in Istanbul where Americans and 
British carry out their activities. 
 
CUMHURIYET:     Through the joint effort of the Ankara Tandogan and 
Diyarbakir Rotary Clubs, a seminar on "Facilitating the Teaching 
of Reading and Writing" was held for 225 teachers serving at 
schools in Mardin, Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:        The Tunceli Chamber of Tradesmen 
and Craftsmen collected 15,083 signatures to petition the 
Turkish Parliament, Ministry of Education, Higher Education 
Board and Ministry of Internal Affairs to include Tunceli on the 
list of eighteen cities where universities will be built. 
 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:        YODER (Yuzuncu Yil University 
Student Association), along with various NGOs, unions and 
political parties, protested the investigations of hundreds of 
Yuzuncu Yil University students in Van.  They made a press 
announcement condemning the investigations; later students 
marched while shouting, "Put an end to the terror of 
investigations, our right to education cannot be impeded." 
 
 
CUMHURIYET:     Armenian Orthodox Patriarch Mesrob II conducted the 
"Name Day" ceremony of the Karasun Manuk Armenian Church in 
Iskenderun, Hatay province. Two hundred people came from 
Istanbul to attend the ceremony. Following the event, Patriarch 
Mesrob II attended another ceremony held at the Virgin Mary 
Church in the only remaining Armenian village of Vakifli in 
Samandag district. 
 
ZAMAN:  YOK's (Higher Board of Education) Inspection Board 
spotted contract-awarding irregularities in the leasing of Dicle 
University's immovable properties and the University's 
purchasing of three pieces of medical equipment. YOK pressed 
charges against the President of Dicle University, Prof. Fikri 
Canoruc. 
 
TERCUMAN:       Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul (reportedly) stated 
that no agreement has been signed between the U.S. and Turkey on 
the use of Incirlik Airbase; Incirlik Airbase belongs to the 
Turkish Armed Forces, he said, and its use by another country is 
allowed only through the decision made by the Council of 
Ministers. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
 
¶1.      BOLGE / SABAH (GUNEY) / EKSPRES / MILLIYET:     Israel's 
Ambassador to Turkey expressed his country's wishes to carry out 
investments in Adana province. During his visit to the Adana

years, to build a "Qualified Free Zone" project in Yumurtalik 
district of Adana. 
 
¶2.      SABAH (GUNEY):  Mustafa Yilmaz, Gaziantep MP from CHP 
(Republican People's Party) and former State Minister, announced 
that Gaziantep MPs had embarked upon efforts to put Gaziantep on 
the Turkish government's incentive list and to expedite the 
construction of the Gaziantep Airport. 
 
¶3.      YENI SAFAK:     Truck drivers welcomed the good news that a 
car-park with a capacity of more than 5000 vehicles will be 
built at the Habur Border Gate in Sirnak. The planned car-park 
will alleviate the situation of truck drivers that must endure 
miserable conditions caused by long truck queues that form at 
the Gate ("when the Iraq side stops the incoming traffic at the 
border," reports Yeni Safak).
