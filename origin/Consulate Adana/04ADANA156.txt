¶1.  (SBU)  On December 12 at approximately 12:30 pm, at the 
Railway Station Square in central Adana (6-7 kilometers from the 
U.S. Consulate), approximately 500 demonstrators protested U.S. 
policies in Iraq and GOT collaboration with the U.S.  The group 
disbanded at 14:45 hours without incident.

Party and included members of the provincial organizations of 
the True Path Party (DYP), Republican People's Party (CHP); 
Nationalist Action Party (MHP); Toil Party (Emegin Partisi); and 
the Public Employees Union.  Demonstrators denounced the death 
of civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan, accused the U.S. of 
imperialism, and claimed the invasion of Iraq was part of the 
"U.S. and Israel's Greater Middle East Project."   Organizers 
also protested the AK Party's collaboration with the U.S., 
including permission for the U.S. to operate fighter aircraft 
from Incirlik Air Force Base.  (Note:  The U.S. does not operate 
fighter aircraft from Incirlik Air Force Base, but a small 
number of U.S. tankers temporarily rotate through the base.  End
