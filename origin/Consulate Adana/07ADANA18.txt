¶1. (U) Our contact in the Batman Governor's Press Office 
confirmed to the Consulate on February 9, that there has been an 
outbreak of bird flu in Bogazkoy village of Gercus township in 
Batman province. 
 
¶2. (U) According to the contact, 170 chickens were found dead in 
Bogazkoy on February 6, and local authorities have imposed 
quarantine measures on an area of 3 kilometers in diameter, 
including Ruzgarli and Aydinli villages. Teams from the 
Provincial Health and Agricultural Departments are working in 
the region, while authorities have banned all movement and 
selling of live avian products in Batman until further notice. 
Samples of dead chickens have been sent to the Regional 
Veterinary Research Center in Elazig to determine whether the 
virus was the H5N1 strain [Note: The strain has been confirmed 
to be H5N1. End note]. Three children with flu-like symptoms, 
who were taken to Dicle University Hospital in Diyarbakir for 
observation, have been sent back to Bogazkoy village, and their 
blood samples were sent to Ankara for testing. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will continue to watch the situation closely and 
report any significant developments.
