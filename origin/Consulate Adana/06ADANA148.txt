¶7.  Security Assessment:  In light of ongoing military 
operations in Iraq and continued operations in support of the 
war on terrorism there remains the potential for both 
transnational terrorist groups with anti-Western sympathies, to 
include Kongra Gel (formerly PKK), Revolutionary People's 
Liberation/Front (DHKP/C), Marxist-Leninist Communist Party 
(MLKP) Turkish Communist Party/Marxist Leninist (TKP/ML), 
Turkish Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Army (TIKKO) and 
Islamic Greater Eastern Raiders/Front (IBDA/C) continue to 
operate in Turkey. 
Attacks over the last few years, attributed to these groups, 
have occurred in the Aegean and Mediterranean coastal resort 
areas, as well as in Istanbul.  Most of the attacks, generally 
small-scale bombings, have occurred in neighborhoods of Istanbul 
not generally frequented by official Americans or tourists. 
Also in 2005 and 2006 public buses have been set on fire, with 
the most recent incident resulting in three deaths.  Thus far, 
these attacks on buses also have taken place in areas of 
Istanbul distant from official American or tourist 
destinations.,  A Kurdish group, ostensibly aligned with the PKK 
terrorists, claimed responsibility for many of the incidents 
noted above, and in April 2006 this group issued a statement 
renewing a threat to target Turkeys tourism industry. 
Violent demonstrations have occurred throughout Turkey, the most 
recent in Istanbul and in several cities in Southeastern Turkey. 
 Just as with members of Mission Turkey, USG visitors are 
required to obtain RSO Ankara and DCM approval for travel to the 
Southeast. 
Al-Qa'ida threats to target U.S. facilities in Turkey have been 
public knowledge for some time.  On November 15. 2003 two 
synagogues in Istanbul were the targets of suicide truck bombs. 
On November 20, 2003 the British Consulate General and the 
London based HSBC Bank in Istanbul were struck by powerful 
explosions, killing dozens and wounding hundreds.  Through 
prosecutions of those responsible are still ongoing, indications 
are that the indigenous radical Islamic terrorist group 
responsible was supported by the Al-Qa'ida network.  The August 
2005 discovery 
in Antalya of a potential plot against maritime interest and 
subsequent arrest of a Syrian Al-Qa'ida facilitator and planner 
further attest to the ongoing transnational threat. 
The incidence of crime, both violent and the more traditional 
tourists crimes (pick pocketing, purse-snatching, etc.), is 
relatively low throughout Turkey.  However, over the last year, 
there has been a marked increase in the number of crimes 
reported to Consulate General Istanbul.  Much of the crime is 
centered in the areas frequented by tourists, Consulate 
employees and official visitors.  Visitors should be 
particularly attentive for pick pockets in and around the 
Sultanahmet, Taksim Square, and Istiklal Caddesi areas of 
Istanbul.  Often pick pocketing is preceded by some sort of 
diversion, such as an argument or fight, or children asking to 
assist tourists, for example with their bags,  If you encounter 
such activity, secure your wallet or purse and quickly leave the 
area.  Another scam that is becoming more prevalent is that of a 
stranger approaching a visitor and striking up a conversation 
which is continued inside a restaurant or club, where one is 
either drugged and robbed or presented with an enormous bill and 
intimidated into paying it.  The security office encourages 
visitors to report any security incidents, including 
surveillance, to the RSO immediately.
