with people, people are down here."

common sense in the face of difficult times and provocations as 
they emerged, and approached the issues in a calm and 
even-tempered manner. The police have been very successful in 
maintaining peace and order while at the same time they never 
discriminated against people because of any racial, religious, 
or ethnic concerns while undertaking their duties."  The dailies 
separately noted that Seyhan district security director paid a

firearms are entering the country through border gates with Iraq 
and Syria. 
 
ECONOMY

announced that a total of 100 million barrels of crude oil were 
loaded onto vessels up until today from the Ceyhan terminal of 
the BTC (Baku-Tibilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline) in Adana. 
 
CULTURE / SOCIETY / ENVIRONMENT 
 
BOLGE / CUKUROVA MERHABA ONLINE:        It is reported that the 
number of women officers employed in the (U.S.) Army increased 
because of the war situation in Iraq and Afghanistan, and 
consequently this caused an increase in sexual assault cases. 
According to the information given on HYPERLINK 
"http://www.incirlik.af.mil" www.incirlik.af.mil, a coordination 
office for "Sexual Assault Prevention" has been established at 
Incirlik Air Base for prevention and education efforts about the 
issue, report the dailies.  Lt. Cheri Guikema, Sexual Assault 
Response Coordinator of the Base, said that sexual assaults were 
a challenge to the Base, to the nation, and to the military. 
 
SABAH:  The suicide rates among women have been increasing 
in the southeastern region.  The number of suicide incidents was 
formerly reported in newspapers as having already reached high 
levels in Batman, Diyarbakir, Van and Sanliurfa.  Today, Sabah 
daily points out that this trend has recently been joined by 
Hakkari province where 41 young girls attempted to commit 
suicide last year. Four of them died.  This number is reportedly 
2 times higher than the figures of the previous year in Hakkari, 
a province where no honor killings are seen.  The soaring number 
of suicide attempts among Hakkari women is reportedly raising 
the question of whether the girls and/or women are being forced 
into committing suicide by their families.
