¶1.  (U) Summary:  A U.S.-sponsored grant to a women's 
organization in the Eastern Anatolia city of Adiyaman is 
providing literacy education for 200 poor women and vocational 
training for 70 more.  The October 11 launch of the project 
demonstrated America's value as a force multiplier as a visit by 
the U.S. Ambassador catalyzed participation by dozens of key 
regional and national political and business leaders, all of 
whom praised this cooperative effort and echoed the message that 
women's empowerment is critical for Turkey's development.  The 
project was funded under the FY08 Public Diplomacy Supplemental. 
 End summary. 
 
Mission Turkey Focuses on Women's Empowerment 
--------------------------------------------- -------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Mission Turkey's FY08 Public Diplomacy Supplemental 
included resources for projects aimed at improving economic and 
social conditions for women living in southeastern Turkey.  One 
of the grants was awarded to the Anatolian Women's Association 
of Adiyaman (AWAA).  In its project proposal, the AWAA noted 
that discrimination against women remains rampant in the region 
and because of the strength of traditional local cultures where 
women are often treated as "incubators and commodities." 
So-called "honor" killings are still an issue.  Only a few NGOs, 
AWAA noted, are dedicated to bringing about gender equality; 
AWAA advocates expanding basic literacy and business skills as 
an important first step to move forward. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Association designed a project focused on basic 
literacy and vocational training.  Because nearly 30% of women 
in Adiyaman province are illiterate, the Association is offering 
200 women a two-month course in basic reading, writing and 
speaking skills (because this is a Kurdish region, Turkish is 
the second language for many participants).  A second course was 
created in collaboration with local textile companies and 
provides training in handicrafts and basic entrepreneurship.  A 
third class for more highly educated women is in basic computer 
skills and includes use of the internet, word-processing and 
elementary website design. 
 
Anatolian Women Garner National Attention 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶4.  (U) The AWAA effectively leveraged the U.S. grant of $14,000 
by establishing cooperative agreements with the local and 
provincial governments, giving them access to public school 
classrooms and a vocational training center.  AWAA also 
recognized the importance of changing public perceptions about 
women's issues and lined up important allies, including Adiyaman 
native Mir Dengir Firat, a deputy chairman of the ruling AK 
Party and a member of PM Erdogan's inner circle, and Rifat 
Hisarciklioglu, a nationally prominent business leader who 
chairs the Turkish Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges 
(TOBB). 
 
¶5.  (U) During a half day of activities marking the launch of 
the project, Ambassador visited the school where the literacy 
classes are held and met with dozens of women who were just 
learning to read and write, including one woman who read short 
welcoming remarks for him.  He also called on a group of women 
learning embroidery and other skills that will give them 
opportunities to work independently or in the local textile 
industry.  Finally, Adiyaman University hosted a 2-hour 
conference featuring remarks by the Ambassador and other 
visitors, including Firat and Hisarciklioglu. 
 
¶6.  (U) In his remarks, the Ambassador noted the United States 
has worked for over 200 years and is continuing to struggle to 
bring into reality the principle that all people are created 
equal.  The Turkish republic's founding principles, based on the 
vision of Ataturk, contain similar goals.   Having legal rights 
in principle is one thing, but exercising them in practice is 
different.  Realizing the right to equality, he continued, 
"requires hard work and dedication and he commended AWAA's work 
and that of the project participants, who will be able to use 
their new skills to provide for their families and contribute to 
their communities. 
 
Comment 
------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) With relatively modest funding ($100,000 total devoted 
to "Empowering Women"), Mission Turkey has been able to provide 
 
ADANA 00000042  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
project support to four women's NGOs in southeastern Turkey.  In 
addition to creating opportunities for hundreds of women to 
improve their lives and those of their families through basic 
education and vocational training, we have also worked to use 
the grants as a way to encourage more discussion about the 
importance of women's rights in Turkey's development aspirations 
by running an op-ed by the Ambassador in a national newspaper. 
The positive impact of this grant for the women's NGO in 
Adiyaman and for U.S. standing there shows that in many regions 
of Turkey it is possible to get a bang for our PD buck.
