¶2.      HURRIYET: Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad Al-Bolani came to 
Ankara to reportedly discuss reviving a now ineffective 
anti-terror agreement signed earlier with Saddam Hussein's 
regime.  In bilateral meetings, issues such as the recognition 
of the PKK as a terrorist organization, hot pursuit against PKK 
terrorists, prevention of PKK activities in Iraq, etc. are on 
the agenda.  During the meetings, the Turkish Interior Ministry 
will request the extradition from Iraq of 150 PKK terrorists.

Gul was adamant about conducting his first official visit to 
southeastern Turkey in mid-September. 
 
¶4.      ZAMAN / EKSPRES: In his book titled "I Witnessed 
Infidelity," a retired colonel revealed that in the past there 
were interesting methods to convince locals not to allow 
terrorists into towns or cities.  In one example, the military 
staged a fabricated conflict, opening fire with machine guns and 
rockets at predetermined targets in Semdinli under cover of 
nightfall.  The following morning they would tell how such 
conflicts could harm the city and the people, wrote the colonel 
in his book. 
 
¶5.      GUNDEM ONLINE: On the online edition of Gundem daily, DTP 
Deputy National Chairperson Nurettin Demirtas called on local 
people, DTP party organizations, civil society organizations and 
unions to embrace and support Gundem in the of a recent 
one-month ban imposed by an unspecified court. 
 
 
¶6.      OZGUR GUNDEM ONLINE: Diyarbakir Governor Huseyin Avni 
Mutlu, appointed to his position on September 13 when the former 
governor was assigned to a position at the PM's 
Undersecretariat, gave his personal cell phone number to local 
journalists, demonstrating open access to his office.  The 
governor said he wanted to ease office appointment procedures so 
as to facilitate direct contact with the people.

were seriously wounded and two soldiers sustained minor 
injuries.  Sabah and Hurriyet dailies report on the same 
incident, with conflicting details on the bomb itself.  The army 
launched a military operation with air support in several 
districts of the province following the incident.  Jandarma also 
detained six people in the bakery in Tunceli, which supplied
