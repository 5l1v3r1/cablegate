SABAH:  Parliamentary Commission Probing Semdinli Case 
prepared a draft report.  A statement in the report concludes 
that the commission can not determine decisively whether the 
bombing incidents in Hakkari in 2005 were all carried out by the

fantasizing." The report did not include any statements about
