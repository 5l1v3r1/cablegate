SUBJECT: TURKEY:  KURDISH ACTIVIST LEYLA ZANA TO APPEAL 10-YEAR 
SENTENCE 
 
¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  A Diyarbakir court sentenced Kurdish activist 
Leyla Zana to ten years in prison for being a member of the 
terrorist PKK and disseminating propaganda for the organization. 
 The court also banned her from participating in politics and 
voting.  Zana's lawyer has announced plans to appeal, at least a 
year-long process.  A local lawyer points out Zana has not been 
arrested, and will likely not face "preventive detention" during 
the appeals process.  The pro-Kurdish DTP may select Zana as a 
mayoral candidate in the southeast.  This verdict could enhance 
her appeal among Kurdish voters who empathize with her 
victimization.  The southeast has been quiet in the immediate 
aftermath of the ruling, with no evidence of planned protests. 
END SUMMARY.

All Quiet on the Eastern Front

¶2.  (SBU)  On December 4, Diyarbakir's 5th High Criminal Court 
sentenced former politician Leyla Zana to 10 years in prison on 
charges of violating the Turkish Penal Code and the Anti-Terror 
Law.  Zana was found guilty of being a member of a terrorist 
organization - the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) -- and 
disseminating terrorist propaganda in nine separate speeches 
delivered over the past year.  Among Zana's quotes cited in the 
indictment are "I don't consider PKK to be a terrorist 
organization;" "Ocalan is the leader of the Kurdish people;" 
and, "the PKK's fight is a struggle freedom and democracy."  The 
court referenced public addresses she delivered in multiple 
cities in the southeast and before the European Parliament (in 
Kurdish) to protest military cross-border operations and rally 
political support.  Zana's lawyer, who was not present during 
the sentencing, has vowed to appeal, a process that could take a 
year or longer.  Principal Officer reported from Diyarbakir that 
local business, NGO and political leaders have not raised the 
Zana topic during his meetings, and currently all is quiet.  A 
local lawyer points out that Zana has not been arrested, and 
will likely not face "preventive detention" during the appeals 
process.

Guilty Verdict May Ignite Turkey-EU Tension 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶3.  (U)  Zana, Turkey's first female Kurdish parliamentarian, is 
not unfamiliar with the Turkish penal system, having served a 
previous ten-year sentence from 1994-2004 under similar charges 
of being a PKK member.  The case was highly controversial in 
European countries.  The European Union challenged the 
conviction and later awarded her the Sakharov Prize for Freedom 
of Thought.  In 2001, the European Court of Human Rights ruled 
against Turkey after a review of her trial, a verdict rejected 
by Turkey.  This fresh conviction may stir up more friction 
between Turkey and the EU, despite a recent report by the 
Assembly of Western European Union countries recognizing 
Turkey's right to defend and protect itself in the face of the 
PKK threat.

COMMENT 
 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  A well-known Diyarbakir attorney, Sezgin Tanrikoglu, 
told us the ban on voting and political participation will be 
suspended until the appeals process is concluded.  This is 
politically significant, as pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party 
(DTP) -- the successor to previous Kurdish parties banned by the 
Turkish judiciary -- may reassess its election strategy and 
consider Zana's candidacy for key mayoral races in the 
southeast.  This verdict could make her a more attractive 
candidate for Kurdish voters who empathize with her 
victimization.  On the other end of the spectrum, Zana has long 
been a lightning rod for Turkish nationalists who believe she 
has flouted the law and openly supported Kurdish separatism, 
with deadly consequences.  They will view the verdict as long 
overdue.  END COMMENT.
