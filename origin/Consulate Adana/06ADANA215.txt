Cultural Situation of the Kurds." (see press summary for October

military worsened the situation of the Kurds.  The report 
branded the conflict situation "a de facto civil war."  Terry 
Davis, General Secretary of Council of Europe, held a press 
announcement and said that Kurdish issue must be resolved in due 
adherence to the territorial integrity of Turkey.  To resolve 
the issue, the parties should reportedly sit at a table to talk 
and take action. PACE also said that Turkey should take up the 
issue of retrying Abdullah Ocalan.
