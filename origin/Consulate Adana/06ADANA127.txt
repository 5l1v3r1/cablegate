POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
YENI SAFAK / OZGUR GUNDEM:      U.S. Ambassador Ross Wilson, who 
met with Kurdish politicians and human rights association 
administrators in Ankara, will come to Diyarbakir with an 
accompanying delegation to hold meetings with Diyarbakir Mayor 
Osman Baydemir, Diyarbakir Bar Association Chairperson Sezgin 
Tanrikulu, and Southeastern Industrialists and Businessmen 
Association Chairperson Sahismail Bedirhanoglu.  Wilson will go 
to Mardin and Sanliurfa later.  Yeni Safak daily pointed out 
that Wilson's not meeting with DTP representatives in Ankara was 
interpreted as the U.S. imposing an embargo on the DTP. 
 
HURRIYET / CUMHURIYET / RADIKAL:        A list of EU criticisms now 
includes the Semdinli incident, according to the Hurriyet daily. 
 EU-Turkey Association Council will also discuss Semdinli 
concerns during the meeting that will be held in Luxemburg on 
June 12 and 14.  The judicial process for the Semdinli case 
should continue within the boundaries of rule of law and 
judicial criteria, says the EU. 
 
SABAH:  BTC (Baku-Tibilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline) security team 
found a valve 11 kilometers away from the Ceyhan district in 
Adana, which was installed by thieves aiming to steal petroleum 
from the pipeline.  This recent development will delay the 
ceremonies marking the arrival of petroleum to Ceyhan which was 
envisaged as May 27. 
 
EVRENSEL:       The daily reported that The Washington Times, a 
newspaper in the U.S. reportedly close to fundamentalists in the 
U.S., reported it as good news that there were hundreds of 
Christian missionaries in the Arbil province of Iraq.  The U.S. 
evangelists have reportedly been striving to proselytize the 
Kurds in the Autonomous Kurdish Region in Iraq. 
 
EVRENSEL:       First general assembly of DTP, which will be held 
next month, will reportedly determine the structural character 
of legal Kurdish politics.  That assembly will reportedly shed 
light on which route the DTP will choose to follow next.  There 
are debates going on within party ranks whether to annul the 
co-chairmanship model and introduce a single national leadership 
in response to Turkish Supreme Court objections to the 
co-chairmanship model.  Another issue on the agenda of the party 
is whether to form alliances with other leftist political 
parties in the next elections or to take part in the elections 
with independent candidates. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   DTP Hakkari provincial chairperson said that 
people in Hakkari have been feeling uneasy about the explosions 
which have resumed in the province.   The chairperson reminded

05/22) in front of the apartment building where Sabahattin 
Suvagci, former DEHAP (Democratic People's Party) provincial 
chairperson, was living in Hakkari. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   DTP Kars provincial party organization will 
protest the reported attempt to ban the speaking of Kurdish in
