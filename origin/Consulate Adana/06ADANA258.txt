SUBJECT: SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY FOR DECEMBER 11, 2006 
 
This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for December 11, 
Â¶2006.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
POLITICAL 
 
CUMHURIYET: Imprisoned PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who used to 
criticize the DYP leader Mehmet Agar severely for his 
involvement in mysterious killing of Kurdish politicians and the 
Susurluk case, stated that he found Mr. Agar's recent phrases 
closer to his phrases, and the model that Mr. Agar would like to 
put into action is liberal democracy that the EU has realized. 
Ocalan added that what Mr. Agar has been suggesting should be 
given a chance and that the US and EU might be supporting Agar 
as well. Ocalan criticized DTP severely and accused its leaders 
of being insufficient in putting theories into practice and that 
they should develop themselves in that regard. He also warned 
the Kurdish citizens and people from Diyarbakir not to vote for 
the political parties exploiting sectarian schools because those 
votes turned to bombs and into a lynching culture against Kurds. 
 
 
EVRENSEL: Sahismail Bedirhanoglu, the President of Southeastern 
Industrialists and Businessmen Association -GUNSIAD- said that 
the businessmen were in favor of the continuation of the 
ceasefire and that the state's response to the ceasefire might 
be delayed because of the election process, and that the party 
that decided on the truce should be a little bit more patient. 
Bedirhanoglu said that no duration should be given for the truce 
and that, if needed, the armed groups should withdraw out of 
Turkey to avoid any provocations. GUNSIAD President said that he 
was anxious that breaking of the truce would strengthen the 
pro-violence groups and therefore emphasized that the truce 
should not be wasted. 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
EVRENSEL: An HPG guerilla, Abbas Armani, Iranian citizen, had 
been killed after he had been arrested alive during 24-27 August 
2005 clashes in rural Besiri of Batman. Seven HPG guerillas had 
been killed in the clashes. After Armani's live pictures were 
published in Gundem newspaper, Armani's family and lawyers filed 
a petition with the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) of 
Besiri. The Besiri PPO responded to lawyers on October 10, 2006 
saying that there was no need to investigate the case any 
further. One of Armani's lawyers, Selahattin Demirtas, who is 
the HRA's Diyarbakir Chapter's President, objected to the 
decision, and his petition was sent to the heavy Criminal Court 
in Midyat of Mardin province. The court reverted the file to the 
PPO of Besiri and asked that the case be examined thoroughly and 
reminded the prosecutor that he was responsible for accumulating 
all the evidence about the case. 
 
CUMHURIYET/EVRENSEL: Non-governmental Organizations undertook 
various activities and released press statements in Istanbul, 
Ankara, Izmir, and Diyarbakir on the occasion of the 58th 
anniversary of the acceptance of the Universal Human Rights 
Declaration. Attorney Selahattin Demirtas, the President of HRA 
Chapter in Diyarbakir, said that approximately 300 people had 
been killed and hundreds of others had been wounded because of 
the clashes in the region since December 10, 2005. The HRA, HRF, 
Bar Association, and Mazlumder participated in the activities in 
Diyarbakir. The report prepared by the Documentation Center of 
the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey drew attention to the 
increase in violation of rights. The report said 318 persons 
applied to them with claims of torture during the eleven months 
of 2006 and that 62 persons had been killed between October 2005 
and October 2006 as a consequence of security forces' 
extrajudicial killing, random firing, firing on demonstrators 
and individuals not yielding to "halt" warnings. The report said 
17 persons had been killed because of explosion of land mines 
and live ordinance in the fields, and that 14 persons had been 
killed in prisons while two others had been killed while under 
detention. The report reminded that 112 writers, publishers and 
journalists had been tried for their articles in the first ten 
months of 2006. 
 
SECURITY 
 
ZAMAN: Notes from Abdullah Ocalan's lawyers' meeting with him on 
December 6, 2006 have been appearing in the web sites close to 
PKK. A quotation by Abdullah Ocalan saying "Kurds have time 
until Spring before them" is interpreted as instructions for PKK 
 
ADANA 00000258  002 OF 002 
 
 
to intensify its attacks in the spring. 
 
YENI SAFAK: During an operation dubbed "Tulip" in Bitlis, 
security forces seized 30 kilos of heroin in a car traveling 
from Hakkari to Bitlis. F.S. and I.G. initialed individuals in 
the car, allegedly involved in drug trafficking, were taken 
before the prosecutor following conclusion of their arrest 
processes. 
 
ECONOMY 
 
RADIKAL: Asking the industrialists and businessmen to invest in 
Diyarbakir, the Agriculture Minister Mehdi Akar said Diyarbakir 
was more secure than Paris. Minister Akar said that the 
population of Paris was 11.5 million and that 4.5 million 
criminal acts occurred per year while only 20,000 criminal 
incidents happened in Diyarbakir, which has 1.5 million 
population. Minister Akar said that Diyarbakir was situated in 
the heart of a region that possessed important means and 
advantages. Minister Akar said any investment in Diyarbakir 
should envisage exporting to the region that imports 25 billion 
US dollars of food stuffs as well. The minister stated that in 
Diyarbakir neither meat nor dairy industries were at the desired 
level. He said that Diyarbakir's annual meat production was 
15,000 tons and milk production was 250,000 tons but that 
Diyarbakir had only two facilities to process these products.
