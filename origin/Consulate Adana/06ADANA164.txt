OZGUR GUNDEM / YENI SAFAK:      A public unrest has been triggered 
in Sirnak's Silopi district when local people learned that a

mafia and whom they allegedly caught as attempting to kidnap a 
girl, would be released by police.  When three thousand people

disperse the crowd.  Sporadic clashes have reportedly taken 
place with people.  The turmoil continued until late in the day.
