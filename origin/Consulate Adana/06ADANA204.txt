ZAMAN ONLINE    Land Forces Commander General Ilker Basbug 
took the pulse of public sentiment in the Hakkari province. 
Basbug, who paid a visit to the Hakkari Governor's Office, 
walked around the city center and chatted with the people in the 
street.  In addition to listening to what people in the street 
had to say, Basbug stated that "traitors" had caused the death 
of 10 children in Diyarbakir.   Basbug condemned the bomb attack 
and expressed his strong desire to track down the perpetrators. 
 
EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:        One week after the Diyarbakir 
bombing, the Evrensel daily asked in today's edition whether the 
bombing's perpetrators were being pursued or not.  The daily 
pointed out that during a period when the DTP and civil society 
were calling for the PKK to cease fire, and the PKK was 
preparing to respond positively to the call, authorities had 
ignored the PKK's recent condemnation of the bombing and had not 
paid any attention to the Turkish Revenge Brigade, which claimed 
responsibility for the attack on its website.  The authorities 
have reportedly also turned a deaf ear to allegations that the 
"Atabeyler gang" and former retired JITEM members were allegedly 
summoned back for duty in the region a while ago.  According to 
Ozgur Gundem daily, Adil Timurtas, a PKK defector, said that the 
TIT (Turkish Revenge Brigade), which claimed responsibility for 
the bomb attack, was an illegal organization allegedly acting 
under the auspices of the military. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Mass organizations and political parties held a 
demonstration in Tunceli to condemn the Diyarbakir bomb attack. 
DTP's Adiyaman chapter also held a silent demonstration and made 
a press announcement in the province. 
 
BOLGE:  PKK supporters in Mersin carried out unauthorized 
demonstrations in some parts of the province to protest the

Molotov cocktails at the police, the police intervened in light 
armored police vehicles.
