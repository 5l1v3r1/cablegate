ZAMAN / CUMHURIYET / EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:   Orhan Dogan, DTH 
(Democratic Society Movement) spokesperson and former DEP 
(Democracy Party) deputy, said during the DTH convention in 
Ankara (see press summary 10/03) that DTH's aim was to replace 
the impasse created by conventional politics, to reach broader 
sections of society, and adopt a new political mentality.  For 
Dogan, DTH is the new century's project for solutions. 
According to Dogan, despite AKP undertaking significant reforms

the Kurdish issue.  Zaman daily separately reported that the DEP 
grassroots of the DTH vetoed any form of unification with Celal 
Dogan.
