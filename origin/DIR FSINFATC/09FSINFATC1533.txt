SUBJECT: Capturing Recent Crisis Management Experience 
 
¶1. (U) With the summer transfer and leave season rapidly 
approaching, FSI asks personnel from posts that have faced 
significant crises in the last 18 months to consider sharing their 
experiences when back in Washington.  FSI's Crisis Management 
Training division (CMT), in our Leadership and Management School, is 
building a video library of interviews with personnel from crisis 
posts who have been involved with Emergency Action Committees, 
Emergency Action Plans, authorized or ordered departures, receipt of 
evacuees, or other emergency responses.  Our library currently 
contains interviews with personnel who recently have witnessed the 
civil unrest in Belgrade and Yaounde, the fighting in Ndjamena and 
Tbilisi, and the terrorist attacks in Sanaa and Mumbai. 
 
¶2. (U) These firsthand accounts of posts dealing with crises tie our 
training directly to the "real world," and they have received high 
marks from FSI students.  We have utilized excerpts from some of 
these interviews in our classroom presentations and, in the future, 
may employ brief clips as podcasts or "video snacks" (a term in 
current use in the corporate training world) on our website. 
Another, more long-term possibility includes use of these interviews 
in training films. 
 
¶3. (U) We want to build on this momentum and are interested in 
talking to anyone who recently has experienced a major crisis while 
on an overseas assignment -- the COM, RSOs, SEOs, ELOs, OMSs, EFMs, 
LES, generalists, specialists, other agency personnel, etc.  We are 
sending this cable to the addressee posts in light of your 
collective experience during the past eighteen months in the hope 
that mission personnel would be willing to share their experiences. 
 
¶4. (U) As your post and its personnel prepare for travel this summer 
to onward assignments and/or leave, we wanted to make a request to 
sit down with anyone currently at post who anticipates spending time 
in the Washington area over the next several months.  Our on-camera 
interviews here at FSI last about a half hour to forty five minutes, 
with questions provided beforehand.  Your staff's participation in 
this project would be most appreciated and would be a direct benefit 
to colleagues who might face similar circumstances in their own 
careers. 
 
¶5. (U) If you or someone from post anticipates passing through 
Washington during the summer, we would welcome the opportunity to 
capture thoughts, impressions, and reaction descriptions.  Please 
contact CMT Program Officer Chris Dorn at 702-302-6956 or at 
dornch@state.gov.  Our timing is flexible and we can schedule an 
interview at the convenience of anyone interested in contributing to 
our crisis video library.
