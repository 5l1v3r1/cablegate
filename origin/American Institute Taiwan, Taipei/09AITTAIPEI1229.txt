¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel request, AIT Econ Officer and FN visited Gao 
Jun Co. Ltd in Gangshan Township, Kaohsiung County and interviewed 
the Company's Owner, Mr. Luo Bin and Sales Assistant, Ms. Hsu 
Pei-hsuen. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gao Jun's Sales Assistant Ms. Hsu told AIT that in 
addition to Gao Jun Co.,Ltd, Mr. Luo Bin owns an office in Taipei 
City and one additional company registered under his fiance, Ms. 
Yeh Hui-ling, who also works at Gao Jun in Gangshan Township, 
Kaohsiung County, but was not present during AIT's visit to the 
facility.  According to Hsu, Gao Jun was established on August 11, 
2006 and the second company, Yanaite Power System Company, was 
established on December 16, 2008. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Hsu showed us a written contract which indicated the 
Yanaite Company became the winning bidder of an order of sixty-nine 
items from Taiwan Land Force (TLF) in Gueijen, Tainan County, on 
August 05, 2009.  Hsu said that in order to meet TLF's requirement 
of providing the commodities by October 26, 2009, Luo has rushed 
procurement of the items from several local suppliers.  Hsu said 
that Luo used the core company, Gao Jun, to purchase from the US 
supplier, Space Coast IC Inc. a total of forty-seven items of this 
procurement.  Hsu confirmed that Gao Jun has received almost all 
commodities it has procured. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Luo told us that Taiwan's military institutes are his 
target customers.  He claimed that he does not do business outside 
of Taiwan. Both Luo and Hsu indicated that they were familiar with 
U.S. restrictions on the procurement of US Munitions List 
commodities. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Gao Jun's office is on the second floor of a three-floor 
building.  The bottom floor is used as a show room, while the top 
floor is used as residential space by Luo and Yeh.  Items ordered by 
the company are stored in the second floor office space, which is 
accessible by all members of the staff.  The office appears to be 
secure, with Taiwan Chung Hsing Security Co., Ltd providing 
round-the-clock monitoring services.  Luo and his staff of eight 
young employees seemed happy to meet with AIT.  Both Luo and Hsu 
were cooperative and willing to answer AIT's questions.
