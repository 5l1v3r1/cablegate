¶1.  Summary: In the first of 12 courses arranged by ISN/ECC, 
a team of five instructors presented the Export Control and 
Border Security (EXBS) training course "Advanced License 
Processing II" to about 50 Taiwan officials January 22-26. 
The instructors praised the Taiwan officials' active 
participation in the event.  Representatives of Australia, 
Canada, Japan and South Korea attended portions of the event. 
 End summary. 
 
¶2.  In response to U.S. concerns, in August 2005 Taiwan 
agreed to an export control "gameplan" designed to strengthen 
its export control regime.  As part of our commitment to 
assist Taiwan in strengthening its export control regime, an 
interagency delegation led by ISN/ECC met with Taiwan 
officials in Taipei, Tainan, and Kaohsiung in November 2006 
to explore Taiwan's training needs.  The Advanced Licensing 
course is the first of 12 training courses that ISN/ECC and 
the Taiwan Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) identified in 
November 2006 as priority training needs. 
 
¶3.  Officials from Taiwan's Counter Terrorism Office, 
National Security Bureau, National Security Council, Customs, 
Industrial Park Administration, Export Processing Zone 
Administration, and National Police attended portions of the 
January 22-26 EXBS Advanced Licensing workshop.  The five 
instructors included two State contractors, and one each from 
DOC/BIS, the ROK Ministry of Commerce, and the UK Department 
of Trade and Industry Export Control Organization.  The 
opening session was attended by representatives of the 
Australian, Canadian, Japanese, and South Korean trade 
missions in Taipei.  One instructor commented during the 
closing dinner that based on his experience presenting 
training in more than 40 countries, the training had gone 
exceptionally well, the participants were engaged, 
interested, and at an appropriate level to receive this 
training. 
 
Suggestions for Improvement: 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  In future EXBS training we'd recommend written 
translations should be into the traditional Chinese 
characters used in Taiwan and with the terminology used in 
Taiwan rather than PRC terminology.  We'd recommend 
consecutive, rather than simultaneous translation.  The 
interpretors had difficulty understanding the Korean 
speaker's accented English, and little of it was interpreted 
into Chinese.  (Consecutive interpretation would have 
overcome this problem.)  Policy issues should have been 
presented together on one day, rather than scattered 
throughout the week.  Ad hoc changes to the agenda meant 
participants not attending the entire week missed sessions 
they wanted to attend.  English language copies of the 
materials would also have been desireable as some 
participants asked for English versions.
