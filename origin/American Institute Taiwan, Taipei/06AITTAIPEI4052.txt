¶1.  SUMMARY.  The International Commission for the 
Conservation of 
Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) meeting 11/17-26 in Dubrovnik Croatia, 
restored 
to Taiwan the full tuna quota it had previously enjoyed and 
agreed 
Taiwan  could maintain its non-member status in the 
organization.  In 
the year since the 2005 ICCAT decision to slash Taiwan's 
quota by 70 
percent, fishery officials have reduced Taiwan's fishing 
fleet by 160 
vessels. With restoration of the quota to 14,900 tons, 34 
vessels will 
likely be put back in service.  Taiwan will continue its 
monitoring 
measures now in place.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
REDUCTION OF FISHING FLEET CRUCIAL TO RECOVERING 
TAIWAN TUNA QUOTA 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶2.  This year's ICCAT meeting, held in Dubrovnik, Croatia 
November 17- 
26, produced full restoration of Taiwan's 14,900 ton big-eye 
tuna 
quota.  This marks a complete reversal of the 2005 ICCAT 
decision to 
cut Taiwan's quota to 4,600 tons and represents a big gain 
for Taiwan's 
overseas fishing fleets.  Fishery Agency officials told AIT 
the ICCAT 
decision was unanimous and the well-executed presentation by 
their 
delegation together with evidence of their progress in 
reducing 
Taiwan's fleet and close monitoring of fish catch was 
instrumental in 
winning back their full quota.  They also acknowledged U.S. 
assistance 
in helping broker the deal.  Following last year's ICCAT cuts 
in 
Taiwan's fishing quota, Taiwan fishery authorities embarked 
on a 
rigorous effort to pare down their fishing fleet, recalling 
34 vessels 
from the Atlantic fishery and dismantling 160 vessels to 
satisfy ICCAT 
(ref b).  These efforts paid off at the ICCAT meeting and 
members were 
convinced by Taiwan's efforts in reducing fishing capacity 
and efforts 
to improve monitoring and reporting of catches.

THE IDLED 34 VESSELS WILL BE ALLOWED TO FISH 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶3. As part of Taiwan's efforts to reduce fishing vessels in 
the 
Atlantic, 34 tuna long-liners were recalled to Kaohsiung. 
ICCAT's 
latest ruling allows Taiwan to keep up to 64 vessels in the 
Atlantic. 
Taiwan fisheries officials indicated that current plans are 
limited to 
allowing the 34 idled vessels to resume operations in the 
Atlantic. 
Currently, Taiwan operates 15 vessels in the Atlantic. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
MONITORING MEASURES TO CONTINUE 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶4. Although pleased with their success at ICCAT, Taiwan 
fishery 
officials said they need to focus on continued oversight of 
their 
fishing fleets. Fishery officials said that ICCAT has relaxed 
its 
requirement for onboard inspectors on Taiwan fishing vessels, 
with only 
10 percent of the vessels needing to comply versus 100 
percent 
previously.  ICCAT also relaxed the requirement for Taiwan 
vessels to 
report back to port for inspection every three months, so 
long as there 
is an inspector on board when a fish catch is transshipped at 
sea. 
However, ICCAT  required Taiwan to work out a program to 
inspect their 
vessels flying foreign flags and to stop illegal, unregulated 
and 
unreported fishing (IUU).

COMMENT 
----------------- 
 
¶5.  Taiwan fishery officials are taking a conservative 
approach to 
their achievement at ICCAT.  Rather than bringing their 
fishing fleet 
up to the 64 vessels allowed by ICCAT, they are letting 49 
vessels 
operate in the Atlantic for the time being.  In the coming 
days their 
efforts will be focused on formulating a comprehensive 
fisheries 
management plan to tighten control over their foreign flagged 
vessels 
and end illegal fishing.  END COMMENT
