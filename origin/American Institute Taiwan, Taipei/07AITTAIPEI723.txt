Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies gave significant 
coverage March 29 to an apology by TVBS, a famous cable television 
network in Taiwan, on Wednesday evening for the misconduct of two of 
its reporters, who shot video footage featuring a gangster 
demonstrating an array of firearms and making death threats to the 
leader of his gang.  News coverage also focused on the 2008 
presidential elections and other local issues.  In terms of 
editorials and commentaries, a column in the pro-status quo "China 
Times" commented on UN Security Council Resolution 1747, saying it 
has demonstrated the U.S.'s power in the international financial 
market.  End summary. 
 
"Financial Sanctions are a Specialty of the United States" 
 
The "International Outlook" column in the pro-status quo "China 
Times" [circulation: 400,000] (3/29): 
 
"... It stands to reason that financial operations should be 
determined by the market, but this is just a theory.  In reality, 
they can be manipulated completely by the United States via its 
diplomatic policies.  The funds transfer issue with the Macau-based 
Banco Delta Asia has made Pyongyang realize how horrible such power 
can be.  The Pyongyang authorities do not care about the 20 million 
U.S. dollars, but they do care about the invisible hand that can 
choke North Korea's activities in the international financial 
market. ... 
 
"The UNSC Resolution 1747 specified that 'all States and 
international financial institutions may not enter into new 
commitments for grants, financial assistance, and concessional loans 
to the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, except for 
humanitarian and developmental purposes.'  This is the United 
States' magic weapon.  It is certainly not a very severe sanction, 
but it already demonstrates the United States' power.  Washington 
has already requested that its domestic financial institutions 
impose sanctions against Iran, and now it has more reason to do so 
with this crown from the UN Security Council. ..."
