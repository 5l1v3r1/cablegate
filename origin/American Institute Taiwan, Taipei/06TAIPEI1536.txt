¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  AIT presented Ref A demarche on Taiwan 
participation in WHO to Vice Foreign Minister Michael Kau, 
highlighting U.S. requests for Taiwan to unilaterally adhere 
to the IHR's and to agree to the "two-by-two" debate 
proposal.  Kau responded that Taiwan is nearly ready to go 
forward with the IHR declaration, but that the two-by-two 
debate will be politically problematic.  To make it easier to 
agree to the two-by-two proposal, Kau said, Taiwan requested 
the U.S. to press WHO to provide a letter accepting Taiwan's 
request to participate in the GOARN and to join with Japan in 
co-sponsoring Taiwan's bid for WHO observer status.  AIT 
responded that these new requests were unfeasible in the 
short time remaining before the WHA and that Taiwan needs to 
focus on practical steps forward, including the IHR pledge 
and the two-by-two debate.  Please see action requests in 
paras 9 and 10.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) AIT Deputy Director Keegan presented the demarche 
(Ref A) in support of Taiwan access to the Global Outbreak 
and Response Network (GOARN) and clarifying the U.S. position 
on a possible Taiwan WHA observer bid to Vice Foreign 
Minister Michael Kau (Ying-mao) May 2.  The Deputy Director 
noted that he and the Director had earlier the same day met 
with a number of like-minded country representatives in 
Taipei, who had proven both well-informed about, and 
generally supportive of, Taiwan's participation in WHO 
activities. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) After presenting the demarche, the Deputy Director 
explained that in addition to encouraging Taiwan to 
unilaterally assume the responsibilities of the International 
Health Regulations (IHRs), the U.S. also requested Taiwan's 
response to our proposal for "two-by-two" debates in the WHA 
Plenary Session and General Committee, first presented to Kau 
on April 1 (Ref B). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) VFM Kau told the Deputy Director that in his visit 
to Tokyo last week he had found strong Japanese support for 
Taiwan participation in WHO activities, though he 
acknowledged that Japan also considers Taiwan WHO observer 
status to be only a long-term goal.  Kau agreed with the 
Deputy Director that the EU was taking a more active role 
supporting Taiwan participation in WHO activities.  On the 
other hand, he complained, both Beijing and the WHO 
Secretariat were undermining Taiwan's efforts by putting out 
 
SIPDIS 
"misleading" information that Taiwan is already able to 
participate in GOARN activities.  The Secretariat claimed to 
have a Taiwan focal point, but it turned out to be two former 
CDC officials now teaching at a university in Tainan.  He 
argued that this did not constitute effective Taiwan 
participation in GOARN. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On the IHR commitment, VFM Kau said, Taiwan was 
nearly ready to move forward.  While some questions remained 
about the precise method of making the announcement, he 
stressed that he was confident Taiwan could do this and 
promised a decision "in the next two weeks."  Department of 
Health International Affairs Director=General Peter Chang 
asked the Deputy Director to query Washington on the 
appropriate way for Taiwan to announce its IHR commitment. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The two-by-two debate proposal, however, would be 
more difficult without some symbolic victory to satisfy 
domestic critics who would call this a defeat, Kau explained. 
 It would "very hard" for the Taiwan government to retreat 
and replace its bid for observership with a "two-by-two" 
debate unless Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in WHO 
activities could be clearly verified.  Kau requested U.S. 
assistance in (1) eliciting an official WHO response to 
Taiwan's application for GOARN participation (see April 13 
letter from TCDC Director Steve Kuo to GOARN Director Michael 
 
TAIPEI 00001536  002 OF 002 
 
 
Ryan), and (2) co-sponsoring with Japan a Taiwan observership 
resolution at the WHA.  These, Kau claimed, would constitute 
the necessary verification of participation and would enable 
Taiwan to "pragmatically" agree to the two-by-two proposal. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Deputy Director responded that Taiwan had made 
considerable progress in participating in WHO activities over 
the past year.  Taiwan, however, was looking for symbolic 
gestures, while the U.S. was focusing on practical steps 
forward and did not want to see the gains made through a year 
of hard work held hostage to a quest for symbols.  He 
reminded VFM Kau the U.S. had earlier proposed two steps that 
would help Taiwan move forward: (1) unilateral adherence to 
the IHRs, and (2) Taiwan agreement to the two-by-two debate 
proposal. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) If Taiwan adhered to the IHRs, the Deputy Director 
continued, the U.S., and probably other countries, would 
publicly endorse this move, giving the Taiwan government the 
symbolic victory it seeks.  This victory, he argued, is 
achievable and will not require a formal document from the 
WHO to Taiwan, something that has proven impossible to secure 
for a whole year.  Regarding the two-by-two debate, however, 
the Deputy Director continued, it appeared Taiwan was now 
seeking to set new conditions.  In fact, each of the three 
times AIT has requested a response to the two-by-two 
proposal, he noted, Taiwan has put forward more requests. 
With two weeks remaining before the WHA, it is time to focus 
on practical steps to increase Taiwan's participation in WHO 
activities, and not get sidetracked by symbolic gestures. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) VFM Kau then asked two final questions.  First, 
would Secretary Leavitt be willing to write to WHO in support 
of Taiwan participation in WHO activities, and second, would 
he be willing to meet with Taiwan Health Minister Hou 
Shen-mou?  The Deputy Director responded that both of these 
issues were already under consideration, but that a meeting 
would have to be scheduled by the U.S. and Taiwan missions in 
Geneva. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Comment and Action Request.  It is clear that Vice 
Foreign Minister Kau is hoping for additional expessions of 
U.S. support before recommending to his superiors, the 
Foreign Minister and likely the President as well, that they 
accept the limitations of the two-by-two format for both the 
WHA General Committee and Plenary.  Please confirm whether or 
not Washington is prepared to co-sponsor the Taiwan agenda 
item.  We will then inform Kau and, as necessary, his 
superiors, that they must commit quickly to the two-by-two 
arrangement.
