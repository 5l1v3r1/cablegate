SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
¶1. Summary: Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused their 
news coverage August 14 on the indictment of media baron Gary Wang 
on charges of embezzling more than USD 1 billion in corporate funds, 
and on the remarks of former U.S. ambassador to the UN John Bolton, 
in which he stated that Taiwan's representation in the UN is 
"appropriate." 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, the pro-independence 
"Liberty Times" said in an editorial that the transit arrangements 
for President Chen Shui-bian's Central America visit next week are a 
test of U.S. resistance to China's pressure.  End summary. 
 
"The Treatment of President Chen's Transit in the United States Is 
Trying U.S. Ideals and Its Capability to Resist Pressure" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 720,000] 
editorialized (8/14): 
 
"... In other words, when President Chen made the 'four-noes and 
one-without" pledge, which is equal to limiting Taiwan's pursuit of 
sovereignty, he would receive very good transit treatment.  He could 
even receive a human rights award, give a speech and hold big 
banquets for local overseas Taiwanese in New York.  Therefore, 
although superficially called as transit, the trip was, in fact, a 
U.S. visit.  The destination countries were secondary goals compared 
to the cities in which he stopped over.  In contrast, when President 
Chen emphasized Taiwan's sovereignty by making the 'one country on 
either side across the Strait' statement, announcing the 'cease in 
functioning of the National Unification Council and the National 
Unification Guidelines,' promoting a 'defensive referendum,' or 
[proclaiming] a 'referendum on Taiwan's UN bid,' then would come 
China's overwhelming pressure [Ed. Note: idiom used here literally 
means "move mountains and overturn seas].  As it is hard for the 
United States to withstand the pressure, Washington would downgrade 
the level and place of President Chen's transit to barely satisfy 
China.  And U.S.-Taiwan relations went into a low ebb. 
 
"... If Taiwan is willing to degrade itself, settle for second best, 
be content with not being a normal state, and give up its pursuit of 
an independent national identity, then President Chen can have a 
high-profile transit through the United States.  Or else, if Taiwan 
wants to be itself and does not want to be a part of China, then it 
will be gain the ill fame of being the troublemaker that breaks the 
status quo and receive harsh treatment from the United States. 
 
"... Taiwan has its own national designation, territory, government, 
[population of] 23 million people, healthy democracy and prosperous 
economy.  Why can't it be a UN member?  Why can't it hold referenda 
to demonstrate its national will to join the international 
community?  What is wrong with the proposed UN bid referendum?  The 
whole nation should support President Chen's insistence on ideals 
and on maintaining national identity and dignity without caring for 
his personal honor or disgrace.  As for whether the United States 
will let President Chen transit the U.S. mainland [sic; should be 
"continental United States"], it will be a test of U.S. ideals and 
its capability to resist pressure."
