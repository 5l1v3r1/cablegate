¶A.  SITE ASSESSMENTS AND MEETINGS DURING REPORTING PERIOD. 
 
(SBU) During the week of July 9, 2007, the EXBS Advisor participated 
in export control portions of the US-Taiwan Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement discussions in Washington, D.C. 
 
(U) During the week, the Advisor met with officials of the Office of 
Export Control Cooperation (ECC) and the Office of Missile Threat 
Reduction, Department of State, to discuss EXBS program and export 
control cooperation issues.  The Advisor also met with an official 
of the Treaty Compliance Division, Bureau of Industry and Security, 
Department of Commerce, to discuss rules related to imports and 
exports of schedule 2 chemicals under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention.  Lastly, the Advisor and ECC representatives met with 
the Washington office of AIT to work out a mechanism for 
transferring monies from EXBS implementing agencies to AIT to pay 
for program costs.  Because of AIT's unique legal status, the normal 
fund cite transfer mechanism is not available to AIT. 
 
¶B. TRAINING CONDUCTED DURING REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
(U) During the week of July 16 the Advisor accompanied 19 Taiwan 
officials to the International Seaport Interdiction Training in 
Charleston, South Carolina.  Representatives from the National 
Security Bureau, Counter Terrorism Office of the Executive Yuan, 
Coast Guard Administration, National Police, Harbor Police, Customs, 
Harbor Bureau, and Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) attended ISIT. 
The program was well received by Taiwan officials. 
 
III. UPCOMING TRAINING: 
 
(U) The End-User/End-Use training by the Department of Energy will 
take place on August 20 - 21, 2007.  40 representatives from various 
Taiwan ministries and offices will attend the training.  In 
addition, courtesy invitations will be extended to representatives 
of Japan, Korea, Canada, Australia, and Germany residing in Taiwan.

Customs and Border Protection, is being planned for the week of

(SBU) During the weeks of August 13 and 27, the Advisor and an 
officer from the Economic Section will accompany BOFT officials on 
Taiwan's post-import and post-export evaluations of eleven companies 
throughout the island.  Our goal is to get a better understanding of 
how Taiwan companies operate and what, if any, internal controls 
they have on imports and exports of strategic items.  The knowledge 
gained would be used target appropriate industries and companies as 
EXBS rolls-out the Internal Control Program software development at
