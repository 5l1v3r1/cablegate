¶1.  AIT delivered reftel demarche to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MOFA) APEC Task Force Chief Wang Liang-yu on July 27.  In her 
response, Wang said Chinese Taipei (CT) had repeatedly expressed 
full support for allowing markets, rather than governments, to 
determine select technology standards. 
 
¶2.  Wang said Taipei has drafted IPR model guidelines and would meet 
with the August 23 deadline. 
 
¶3.  Wang was unfamiliar with nominees for the Chairman of the 
Counter Terrorism Task Force (CTTF).  She said she would like to 
learn more about the funding and key responsibilities of an APEC 
Executive Director at the APEC Secretariat. 
 
¶4.  Wang expressed concern over China's opposition to Taipei's 
participation in some APEC activities.  She related how Taipei was 
told by Philippine officials that it could not attend the June 2006 
MANPAD discussions held in Manila.
