five (5) Taiwan officials to Washington, DC, for export control 
meetings.   The Advisor will be on home leave during the weeks of

¶A.  MEETINGS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
(SBU) On August 24, the then-ADIR sent a letter to Deputy Director 
General Hsu, Chun-Fang (Ms.) of the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) 
of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs with a set of 
recommendations to further advance Taiwan's export control system. 
Specifically, AIT recommended that Taiwan (1) designate a point of 
contact within the National Security Council for 
counter-proliferation and counter-terrorism efforts; (2) create a 
formal, permanent office within BOFT to implement export controls; 
(3) increase export control staffing or create an NGO to support 
current staffing level; and (4) create a true interagency mechanism 
for policy making and license review.  BOFT plans to send a formal 
response to inform AIT of its action plan pursuant to the 
recommendations.  AIT expects to receive the response letter on or 
about September 4.
