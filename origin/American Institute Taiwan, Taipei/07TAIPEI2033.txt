SUBJECT: PROTEST TO AIT REGARDING TAIWAN UN BID REFERENDUM 
 
REF:  TAIPEI 02031 
 
¶1.  During the small group demonstration outside AIT on Sept 4 
(reftel), ADIR invited several Legislative Yuan and Taipei Council 
members (list provided below) to present their views inside AIT. 
Apart from reading their letters (translated below), several added 
their own views during the meeting.  The thrust of their remarks is 
that the U.S. should recognize that most Taiwan people support the 
UN referendum, i.e., not only President Chen or a minority.  They 
also emphasized that they could not understand why the U.S., as a 
democracy, would oppose a referendum that would only be an 
expression of the public's sentiments (with no real policy 
consequence).  In response, ADIR expressed strong support for 
Taiwan's democracy but indicated that we were concerned about the 
destabilizing elements of the UN referendum that would affect not 
only U.S. but Taiwan's interests.  ADIR promised to convey their 
petition and messages to Washington. 
 
¶2. The following are full text translations of the two letters of 
protest: 
 
A) UNTA Letter 
 
To:    Director Stephen Young 
 
From:  United Nations-Taiwan-Alliance (UNTA) 
 
September 4, 2007 
 
Subject:  Letter of Protest from UNTA 
 
¶1.  On behalf of the 23 million people of Taiwan, the United Nations 
Taiwan Alliance (UNTA) hereby expresses its regret and indignation 
to your country [for your opposition to Taiwan's UN referendum 
plan].  The people of Taiwan want UN membership and to decide their 
own future through referenda.  This is a basic principle for all 
democratic countries.  The United States should not have given in to 
unreasonable requests from China by denying the people's basic right 
to hold referendums. 
 
¶2.   Taiwan's sovereignty is independent and derived from the people 
of Taiwan, not from China or the United States.  Taiwan is an 
independent and sovereign country, and the people of Taiwan have the 
right to decide whether to support Taiwan's bid for UN membership. 
 
¶3.  According to various opinion polls, more than 70 percent of the 
people of Taiwan support Taiwan's application to join the UN under 
the name of Taiwan.  The Legislative Yuan also unanimously passed a 
resolution in May demanding that the government apply for Taiwan's 
access to WHO under the name of Taiwan.  We call on the United 
States to pay attention to Taiwan's wish to become a UN member. 
 
¶4.  On August 27, Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte 
criticized Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its UN bid in an 
interview with the Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV.  It was not a 
surprise for pro-China media to arrange for such an interview.  What 
we don't understand is how the Untied States, as a world leader of 
democratic countries, could have ignored China's deployment of 
nearly 1,000 missiles targeting Taiwan and intention to change the 
cross-strait status quo with non-peaceful means.  Instead, the 
United States put the blame on Taiwan for its UN referendum plan, 
which is the most democratic and peaceful means for the people of 
Taiwan to defend the status quo of Taiwan as an independent and 
sovereign country. 
 
We hope that Director Young would convey this message to President 
George W. Bush that Taiwan is not only a defender of peace and 
democracy but has also been a good friend of the United States for 
many years.  We learn with deep regret of the United States' 
interference with Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its UN bid. 
We would also like Director Young to tell the U.S. Government that 
the people of Taiwan will not change their determination to enter 
the UN because of this setback.  We will continue to strive for our 
goal and hope that the United States will understand and support our 
endeavors.

B) Letter of Protest to the American Institute in Taiwan 
 
We have been relying on ourselves.  We have earned democracy by 
risking our lives.  We refuse to be a board game piece [bargain 
chip] for U.S.-China negotiations!  Today we want to tell you that 
if you are afraid of China then don't be the big brother.  Taiwan 
wants to be its own master! 
 
Your country treats Taiwan like a canary you raised yourself.  A 
sturdy bird cage was built to keep it in captivity.  When [they] 
feel like it, [they] feed you some food to keep you alive.  But 
[you] can neither grow up nor grow fat.  Meanwhile, China is glaring 
at its prey from the side, greedily watching the canary. 
 
On August 27, your Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte said in 
an exclusive interview with the Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television, 
a "Chinese media outlet" with a military background, that your 
country views President Chen's promotion of a referendum on applying 
for UN membership under the name of Taiwan as a step towards 
Taiwan's declaration of independence.  He also emphasized that your 
country is Taiwan's best friend, strongly supports Taiwan's 
democracy and economy, and is committed to the defense of Taiwan 
through the Taiwan Relations Act.  If your country is Taiwan's best 
friend, then why does your country totally disregard a friend's 
will?  Why do you suppress Taiwan's democracy like this?  If Taiwan 
is not an independent state, why does your country have a defense 
commitment to Taiwan?  Negroponte's remarks were contradictory and 
deviate from the Taiwan people's will.  What is more unthinkable is 
that your country should have used "China's media" to blast Taiwan. 
These kinds of moves, which do not differentiate between friends and 
enemies, are inconceivable.  We express deep regret and strong 
protest. 
 
On August 30, White House National Security Council [Senior] 
Director for East Asian Affairs Dennis Wilder said neither "Taiwan" 
nor "the Republic of China" is now a state.  Since we are not 
anything, then please respect the people of Taiwan.  Let us decide 
what we are.  We want to tell you loudly:  Taiwan is an independent 
sovereign state!  The people of Taiwan want to bravely cross the red 
line, open the bird cage, and fly to the UN, to the whole world. 
 
September 4, 2007 
 
Presenters:  Legislators Kao Chien-chih, Huang Shih-chuo, and Tsai 
Chi-fang; Taipei City councilors Liu Yao-jen, Huang Hsiang-chun, and 
Chuang Jui-hsiung.
