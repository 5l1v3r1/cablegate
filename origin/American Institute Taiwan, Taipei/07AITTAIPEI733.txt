Â¶1.  On March 28, Taiwan's Central Bank Deputy Governor George Chou 
told AIT/Taipei that after searching into its database, Taiwan's 
Central Bank has not found any export credits provided by commercial 
banks for shipments to Iran.  The only Taiwan source of export 
credits to Iran is Taiwan's Export-Import Bank, as reported ref-A.
