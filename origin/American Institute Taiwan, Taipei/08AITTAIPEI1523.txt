Begin Translation 
 
Subject:  United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1835, 
adopted on September 27, 2008, regarding united efforts to prevent 
Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons development capability. 
Appropriate action is requested by each agency. 
 
Explanation: 
 
¶1. Actions requested in this letter are made in accordance with the 
UNSCR 1835 text and related references (please see attached 
documents) provided by AIT on October 6.  This request also 
follows-up on an April 18 request identified by BOFT's reference 
number Mao Fu Tzi 09701508200. 
 
¶2. The UNSCR 1835, which was adopted on September 27, 2008, 
reiterates the commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty as well as 
addresses concerns in resolving Iran's nuclear weapons development 
issue. The UNSCR 1835 strongly demonstrates the international 
community's determination and unity in preventing Iran from 
developing nuclear weapon capability.   In addition,  UNSCR 1835 
underscores that Iran needs to fully cooperate with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to perform the 
legally-binding obligation of suspending its uranium enrichment 
reprocessing and heavy water-related activities. 
 
¶3. The U.S. has provided a summary of the content of UNSCR 1835 
which urges all member states to take necessary measures to prevent 
Iran from developing nuclear weapon capability and, again, suggests 
that all states implement the measures contained in the Resolution. 
 
¶4. Each agency listed below is requested to take appropriate action 
under its jurisdiction as outlined in the Resolution and the U.S. 
summary.

The Financial Supervisory Commission of the Executive Yuan; the 
Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank; the National 
Science Council of the Executive Yuan; the Atomic Energy Council of 
the Executive Yuan; the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of 
Justice; the Bureau of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs; the Armaments Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense; 
the Ministry of Finance; the Directorate General of Customs of the 
Ministry of Finance; and the Aviation and Navigation Department of
