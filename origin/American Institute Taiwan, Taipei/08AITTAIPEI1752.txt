SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage December 19 on the judges' ruling to uphold the earlier 
decision to release former President Chen Shui-bian without bail; on 
the cabinet's unveiling of sample consumption vouchers; and on the 
crash-landing in southern Taiwan of a United States-built Chinook 
helicopter of Taiwan's army.  In terms of editorials and 
commentaries, an editorial in the pro-independence, English-language 
"Taiwan News" pointed out several flaws in the Ma Ying-jeou 
Administration's defense concept and urged that the Administration 
consult closely with the United States and Japan on Taiwan's 
defense. 
 
"Taiwan Needs Caution in Military Rform" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" circulation: 
20,000 editorialized (12/18): 
 
"... There are worrisome flaws in Ma's defense concept. 
 
"First, the KMT president's calls for a 'diplomatic truce' or a 
reduction or elimination of the over 1,000 missiles deployed by the 
PRC military across from Taiwan have gone unheeded, and Beijing 
continues to insist on its 'one-China principle,' which arrogantly 
posits that Taiwan is part of the PRC, and refuses to renounce the 
use of force against Taiwan to ensure 'unification.' 
 
"Second, China's economic rise may be creating business 
opportunities but it is also fueling the continued double-digit 
expansion of the PRC's military budget that is spurring the 
exacerbation of a dangerous imbalance in military force capabilities 
in the Taiwan Strait. 
 
"Moreover, there is no certainty that China's economic development 
will lead to political democratization or social stability in the 
PRC itself.  There are also no guarantees that future Chinese 
governments, democratic or otherwise, will respect the independence 
of Taiwan or the right of free choice of Taiwan's 23 million people 
to determine their own national identity or destiny. 
 
"Moreover, Taiwan's military development and defense strategy are 
deeply intertwined with democratic allies such as the U.S. and Japan 
and their security partners in the Asia-Pacific region, all of whom 
will be shocked and discomfited if Taiwan does not consult with them 
before retreating from 'active defense' to 'passive defense.' 
 
"Combined with the spreading of illusions that 'peace is breaking 
out' in the Taiwan Strait, such a unilateral decision could well 
reduce the willingness of Washington and Tokyo to assist Taiwan 
defend itself from possible PRC intimidation or active threats if 
the touted cross-strait reconciliation falters. ..."
