SUBJECT:  RESULTS OF DPP LEGISLATIVE PRIMARY IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has 
recently completed primaries in southern Taiwan for the legislative 
election set for January 12, 2008.  Multiple candidates competed for 
a chance to represent their party in six of the eight southern 
Taiwan counties or cities.  Taitung and Penghu Counties did not hold 
primaries because no candidates registered there, but the DPP plans 
to recruit candidates later in the year. Under the new 
"single-member district, two vote system" to be introduced in the 
upcoming legislative election, political parties will find it to 
their advantage to ensure they run a candidate even in "difficult" 
districts to increase their share of the party representation vote. 
The following is a list of the DPP candidates for each district in 
southern Taiwan.  End Summary.
