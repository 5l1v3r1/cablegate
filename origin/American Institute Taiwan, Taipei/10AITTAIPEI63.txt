¶I.  BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY MANAGERS: 
 
STRONGER PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS 
 
¶1.  (U) On December 15, the Legislative Yuan passed legislation to 
increase the criminal penalty for export control violations to not 
more than 5 years of imprisonment and a fine of not more than NTD 
1,500,000 (approximately USD 46,583).  Previously, the penalty was 
not more than 2 years of imprisonment and a fine of not more than 
NTD 300,000 (approx. USD 9,317). 
 
RECENT IRANIAN TRADE DELEGATION VISIT TO TAIPEI 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On December 22, the Advisor met with Mr. Fan Che-ning, 
Manager of the Asia and Pacific Section of the Taiwan External Trade 
Development Council (TAITRA), to discuss TAITRA's recent trade 
promotion activity with Middle Eastern countries, including Iran. 
According to Fan, on December 11, 2009, TAITRA signed a memorandum 
of understanding (MOU) with the Tehran Chamber of Commerce for 
Industry and Mining to facilitate trade promotion between Iran and 
Taiwan.  On that day, TAITRA inaugurated two trade associations: 
the Republic of China - Middle East Economic and Trade Association, 
and the Taiwan-Iran Economic and Trade Association.  With regard to 
the MOU, Fan said TAITRA has signed over 100 such MOU's with 
business organizations around the world.  Fan stated that the 
signing of the MOU was quite routine, and described the fact that 
the MOU signing coincided with the Middle East Trade Week as a mere 
coincidence.  [Note: The "Trade Week" was actually a two-day event 
on December 10 and 11.]  He said TAITRA did not think there would be 
any political message implied by the signing or the timing of the 
MOU.  In fact, he added, TAITRA hosted a trade mission with Israel 
in late November.   The Middle East Trade Week was attended by 43 
business representatives from Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, 
Yemen, and Syria. 
 
(SBU) While the Middle East Trade Week was TAITRA's first trade 
event to host a delegation from Iran, sales personnel from Iranian 
companies have visited Taiwan companies in the past.  Since these 
are private company visits, TAITRA is not involved in arranging 
them. 
 
(SBU) Taiwan companies are keenly interested in exploring business 
opportunities in the Middle East.  According to Fan, Taiwan 
companies are primarily interested in trade opportunities for 
Taiwan's chemical, information technology, and industrial machinery 
(not machine tool) industries. 
 
(SBU) When asked to clarify how TAITRA ensures that Taiwan companies 
do not contribute to Iran's proliferation goals, Fan said Taiwan 
companies are fully aware of export control rules, and that TAITRA 
holds twice-yearly export control seminars for industry.
