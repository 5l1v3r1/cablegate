SUBJECT: Taiwan to expand cross-Strait "mini-link" program 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  On March 19, the Executive Yuan (EY) approved the 
expansion of the cross-Strait "mini-link" program designed to boost 
local economic development through tourism.  The expansion will 
allow a daily quota of 680 mainland Chinese, mainly from Fujian 
Province, to tour Kinmen and Matsu islands, as well as the same 
daily quota of Taiwan residents not living on Kinmen and Matsu to 
travel to China via the two islands.  KMT presidential candidate Ma 
Ying-jeou has previously stated his support to open Kinmen and Matsu 
airports for regular cross-Strait flights, and DPP presidential 
candidate Frank Hsieh supports establishing cross-Strait charter 
fights to help prevent the marginalization of Taiwan's offshore 
islands.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) The March 19 EY session approved a Mainland Affairs Council 
(MAC) proposal to expand the mini-link proposal, with a planned 
implementation date of April 1.  Mainland Chinese tourists are now 
allowed to visit Kinmen and Matsu subject to case-by-case approval. 
The new program, however, sets a quota of 600 daily tourists for 
Kinmen, and 80 daily tourists for Matsu.  At the same time, a daily 
quota of 680 Taiwan residents not living on Kinmen or Matsu will be 
allowed to visit China via the two islands.  The daily quota could 
be expanded if China permits to increase Mainland Chinese to tour 
Kinmen and Matsu. 
 
¶3. (U) In addition, the EY announced plans to expand the mini-link 
program to include Taiwan investors in China.  Starting on April 1, 
2008, Taiwan investors in China, their dependents, and Taiwan 
employees working in China will be able to use the mini-link program 
to travel between Taiwan and the mainland.  Currently, Taiwan 
investors in China can only use the mini-link program during the 
Chinese New Year holidays, or by applying on a case-by-case basis. 
 
¶4. (U) Established in January 2001, the "mini link" program gives 
Kinmen and Matsu residents transportation service to Xiamen and 
Fuzhou in China's Fujian Province.  In early 2004, Taiwan's UNI 
Airways and Fujian Xiamen Shipping Corporation, China (FXSC) 
launched a joint air and marine service on the routes.  Flying from 
Taipei to Kinmen and then transferring to a ship sailing for Xiamen 
takes only three hours and costs approximately U.S. $2000 for a 
round trip.  In 2007, over 780,000 Taiwan travelers used the 
mini-link program. 
 
¶5. (U)  According his campaign policy "white paper", KMT 
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou supports setting up a special 
casino and business zone on Penghu, with a view toward promoting the 
island's economic development.  Ma is in favor of allowing all 
Taiwan and mainland Chinese tourists to use Kinmen and Matsu 
airports, as well as the ports of Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu islands. 
 In addition, Ma is proposing to promote special tourist packages 
and routes connecting China, Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.  In 
his tourism "white paper", DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh 
supports expansion of cross-Strait charter flights through Kinmen 
and Matsu in an effort to prevent the islands' marginalization. 
Hsieh also favors setting up a special economic zone on Kinmen as 
part of an expansion of the mini-link program.
