SUBJECT:  Taiwan Lifts Ban on New Bank Branches 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  In May, Taiwan lifted a six-year ban on new bank branches. 
Regulators imposed the ban in order to encourage bank consolidation. 
 The new policy permits banks to open new branches, but only if they 
meet strict requirements.   Most banks will still need to rely on 
merger and acquisition (M&A) to expand.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Ban on New Branches Lifted 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On May 11, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) lifted a 
ban on new bank branches that had been imposed in 2001.  The ban was 
designed to encourage banks to acquire insolvent banks and with it 
their branches to expand their business.  Under the ban, Taiwan 
auctioned off four insolvent banks placed in receivership, including 
three in 2004 and one in May 2007. 
 
Strict Requirements 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  In place of the ban, FSC has now set stiff requirements for a 
bank to establish a new branch: a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 
10%, a maximum non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of 2%, a minimum bad 
debt/reserve ratio of 50%, and a minimum 5% return on net worth over 
the past three years.  Eligible banks may not have losses or 
regulatory violations over the past year, or any cumulative losses 
at the end of the previous year. 
 
¶4.  In addition, FSC will give priority to banks which have assisted 
resolution of insolvent financial institutions in the past and have 
a record of lending to small and medium enterprises. 
 
Small Quota 
----------- 
 
¶5.  The FSC has also set an annual quota of ten new branches for the 
entire banking community.  An eligible bank may set up two branches 
in a year, and the number may increase to three if the new branches 
will be located in rural areas, or if the bank has assisted 
regulators to resolve problem financial institutions in the past. 
 
Limited Number of Eligible Banks 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Only 11 of the 41 Taiwan banks currently meet the FSC 
requirements.  All 11 eligible banks submitted new branch 
applications to the FSC during May this year.  The eleven banks and 
their ranking based on net worth follow: 
--Bank of Taiwan (1) 
--Mega International Commercial Bank (3) 
--Land Bank of Taiwan (4) 
--Taiwan Cooperative Bank (5) 
--First Commercial Bank (6) 
--Cathay United Bank (9) 
--Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank (10) 
--Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank (13) 
--E. Sun Commercial Bank (14) 
--Industrial Bank of Taiwan (17) 
--Export-Import Bank of ROC (21) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  The strict requirements and small quota on new branches will not 
satisfy the expansion desire of large banks.  M&A will still be the

main way for banks to expand.
