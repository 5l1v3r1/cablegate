¶1.  (C) Summary: Foreign Minister Ou told the Director on 
September 18 that the failure of Taiwan's UN proposal the day 
before was expected.  Both Taiwan and the PRC made an effort 
to downplay the issue, and although the PRC reaction was "a 
little tough," PermRep Wang Guangya's UN statement also 
indicated a willingness to work out a formula for Taiwan's 
participation in WHO.  Taiwan's main target is the WHA, Ou 
stressed.  The Director provided Ou a courtesy copy of the 
U.S. statement on the UN proposal, highlighting our support 
for Taiwan's observership at the WHA.  According to Ou, 
Beijing does not appear to be taking any actions at this time 
to undermine Taiwan's diplomatic relationships.  Continued 
progress in cross-Strait relations might lead Beijing to 
consider Taiwan's proposal for a "diplomatic truce," he 
suggested.  Taiwan hopes to have a higher level 
representative at this year's APEC, and President Ma 
Ying-jeou is considering candidates, Ou said, adding that 
Taiwan will have to make a decision by the end of September. 
The Director stressed that the U.S. would like to be helpful 
and strongly supports Taiwan's full participation in APEC. 
Ou and the Director also discussed arms sales and plans for a 
groundbreaking ceremony for AIT's New Office Compound (NOC) 
project.  End Summary. 
 
Taiwan's UN Proposal 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) The Director and Foreign Minister Francisco Ou 
discussed Taiwan's UN initiative and its relations with 
diplomatic allies in a meeting at the Foreign Ministry on 
September 18.  (Note: The UN General Committee (GC) on 
September 17 decided there was no consensus on the proposed 
supplementary item for the UNGA agenda: "Need to examine the 
fundamental rights of the 23 million people of the Republic 
of China (Taiwan) to participate meaningfully in the 
activities of the United Nations specialized agencies.")  FM 
Ou said it was important that both sides made an effort this 
year to downplay the issue, and Taiwan expected this result. 
Our target is the WHA, Ou added. 
 
¶3.  (C) Ou said PRC PermRep Wang Guangya's statement was "a 
little bit tough," for example, the mention of Resolution 
¶2758.  However, he also tried to show goodwill by noting 
Beijing willingness to work out a formula for Taiwan's 
participation in WHO, and this was positive.  In its 
response, Ou said, Taiwan would reiterate its right to 
meaningfully participate in the activities of UN specialized 
agencies. 
 
¶4.  (C) The Director provided FM Ou a courtesy copy of the 
U.S. statement on Taiwan's UN initiative that would be 
published on the USUN website, stressing that the statement 
should not be treated as a public document until it was 
released.  The U.S. statement highlights our support for 
Taiwan's quest to become a WHA observer, he pointed out.  Ou 
expressed appreciation and said the U.S. statement was very 
encouraging.  While Taiwan needs the PRC to show good 
intentions on WHO, support from the U.S. and other members of 
the international community is even more important, Ou 
emphasized.  The Foreign Minister also observed that building 
cross-Strait confidence and trust will take time after nearly 
60 years of confrontation.  What is important is to move in 
this direction, which will benefit both sides, he added. 
 
Diplomatic Allies 
----------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) The Director asked about the status of Taiwan's 
relations with its diplomatic allies, and whether the PRC 
Foreign Ministry would hold back on trying to undermine 
Taiwan's diplomatic relationships.  Taiwan interprets 
Beijing's intentions by its actions, Ou noted.  MOFA's 
perception is that the PRC is not taking actions to win over 
Taiwan's allies at this point.  Ou acknowledged, however, 
that some allies have been approaching China, including 
Panama, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic.  Although 
Paraguay did not support the UN initiative, it still has been 
working with Taiwan on cooperation projects, which 
demonstrates an intention to continue relations.  The new 
Paraguayan government wants to use the funds being provided 
by Taiwan for new projects, he added.  Ou said that Nicaragua 
has been very quiet up to now.  Guatemala, where he served as 
ambassador, is not a problem, although it does want to have 
economic and commercial relations with China, which is all 
right. 
 
¶6.  (C) If some of Taiwan's allies ask to switch recognition, 
would Beijing say no, the Director asked.  Ou responded that 
this would depend on how well cross-Strait relations and 
negotiations were going.  If the dialogue between the Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) goes well, then the Chinese 
will be more agreeable to Taiwan's proposal for a diplomatic 
truce, Ou predicted. 
 
APEC 
---- 
 
¶7.  (C) Ou said Taiwan is hoping to elevate the level of its 
representative to the APEC informal leaders meeting, adding 
that President Ma is considering candidates.  Taiwan will 
have to make a decision by the end of September, he noted. 
At that time, Peru will send a second envoy to Taiwan to 
receive the proposed representative's name.  Stressing U.S. 
support for Taiwan's full participation in APEC, the Director 
asked Ou to keep AIT informed of developments. 
 
Arms Sales 
---------- 
 
¶8.  (C) Ou asked about pending arms sales notifications, 
observing that both Taiwan and the PRC are concerned about 
the issue, although for very different reasons.  The Director 
explained simply that the decision on arms sales would be 
made at the highest levels. 
 
NOC Groundbreaking 
------------------ 
 
¶9.  (C) AIT hopes to hold a groundbreaking ceremony in 
January at the New Office Compound (NOC) site in Neihu, the 
Director noted.  Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin has expressed his 
interest in participating in the ceremony.  As the time draws 
closer, the Director said, he would like to talk to Ou and 
the Presidential Office about possible participation.  The 
ceremony will be a symbol of the lasting U.S. commitment to 
Taiwan, he pointed out. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶10.  (C) FM Ou seemed to want to make the best out of the 
outcome in New York yesterday, taking heart from Wang 
Guangya's comments about working out a formula for Taiwan's 
participation in WHO.  Ou believes international backing is 
critical for Taiwan to make headway in its campaign for 
increased international space, which is focused on WHO/WHA. 
Therefore he particularly appreciated the expression in our 
statement of support on WHO and WHA.  Ou also sees the 
continued improvement of cross-Strait relations as key to 
ensuring PRC restraint on the diplomatic front, including 
with respect to not trying to woo away Taiwan's few remaining 
diplomatic allies.
