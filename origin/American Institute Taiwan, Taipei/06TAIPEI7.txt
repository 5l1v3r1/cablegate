Â¶1.  Recent Taiwan public opinion polls by TVBS, ERA, United 
Daily News, and Commonwealth magazine indicate President Chen 
Shui-bian,s approval rating reached record lows at the end 
of 2005: 
 
-- TVBS:  A TVBS (Blue-leaning) poll released December 15, 
two weeks after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 
badly lost the year-end local elections, showed President 
Chen,s approval rating at 10 percent, a decline of 18 
percentage points from 38 percent in August 2005.  The poll 
showed Chen with the lowest approval rating of nine major 
political figures -- Ma Ying-jeou (80 percent), Su 
Tseng-chang (62), Wang Jin-pyng (55), Yu Shyi-kun (41),

Annette Lu (33), James Soong (28), Frank Hsieh (23), Lee 
Teng-hui (22), and Chen Shui-bian (10). 
 
-- ERA (Niandai):  A poll by ERA (generally considered 
politically neutral) also released December 15 showed Ma 
Ying-jeou at the top and President Chen at the bottom in a 
poll of eight major political figures.  In order of their 
"trustworthiness," they were Ma Ying-jeou (73 percent), Su 
Tseng-chang (61), Annette Lu (54), Yu Shyi-kun (48), Wang 
 
SIPDIS 
Jin-pyng (48), Frank Hsieh (32), James Soong (27), and Chen 
Shui-bian (26). 
 
-- United Daily News:  Polls conducted by the Blue-leaning 
UDN showed a similar long-term decline in approval for 
President Chen.  A poll released on December 4 showed that 
Chen,s approval rating had plunged to a new low of 21 
percent.  This continued the decline in Chen,s approval 
rating from 38 percent at the time of his second inauguration 
in March 2004, to 25 percent in mid-November when the &New 
DPP Movement8 was launched in response to several corruption 
scandals, to 21 percent in the wake of the December 3 local 
election. 
 
-- Commonwealth Magazine:  A poll by the politically neutral 
Commonwealth magazine released on January 2 showed 44 percent 
of respondents see KMT chairman Ma Ying-jeou as an effective 
national leader compared to 4.6 percent for President Chen.
