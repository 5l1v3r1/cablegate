Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies continued to give 
significant coverage March 30 to the arrest of a wanted criminal, 
who recently appeared in a TVBS broadcast threatening to murder a 
rival, and to the controversial role of TVBS, a famous cable 
television network in Taiwan.  News coverage also focused on a 
recent large-scale reshuffle of top prosecutors and on the 2008 
presidential elections.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, an 
editorial in the pro-independence "Liberty Times" commented on 
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's planned visit to China.  The 
article said Wang's visit will certainly be exaggerated by China, 
and Wang will become a tool of China's united front tactics used 
against Taiwan.  End summary. 
 
"Speaker Wang:  Do You Recognize the 1992 Consensus and Do You 
Oppose Taiwan Independence?" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 500,000] 
editorialized (3/30): 
 
"... To discuss it fairly, Legislative Speaker Wang's planned trip 
to China, based on the four conditions he previously raised, is 
completely different in nature from Lien Chan's and James Soong's 
trips to China to curry favor with Beijing. ...  But no matter what 
their purposes are, the visits by Taiwan's political figures to 
China themselves will be used by Beijing as propaganda material for 
its united-front tactics.  In particular, Speaker Wang, though a KMT 
member, is generally viewed as a leader of his party's nativist 
faction; his political vision is more tilted toward identifying with 
Taiwan, which represents a line poles apart from the line adopted by 
the party's pro-unification faction, which upholds ultimate 
unification with, and tilt toward, China.  The presence of such a 
nativist line in the KMT has all the more highlighted the fact that 
the claim by those who advocate ultimate unification that they are 
closely associated with Taiwan is nothing but a hoax, and they can 
never deceive the Taiwan people.  Therefore, if Wang does visit 
China, his publicity value will definitely be much greater than that 
of those pro-unification KMT members.  The Beijing authorities will 
surely feel that they have acquired a rare treasure, and until then, 
even if Wang does not want to be used, his trip will still be 
greatly exaggerated by China, and he will passively become a tool of 
China's united-front tactics to be used against Taiwan. ..."
