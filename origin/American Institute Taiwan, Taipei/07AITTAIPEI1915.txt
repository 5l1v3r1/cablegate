¶1. (U) AIT/Kaohsiung PCO Janee Pierre-Louis, FN Commercial Assistant 
Daphne Fan and Intern Andrew Fowers visited Nitto Denko Corporation 
at the address given and met with the Production Engineering Group 
Manager, Tomokazu Himura and Assistant Manager, Chun-lin Chen, to 
conduct a post-shipment verification on August 17, 2007. 
 
¶2. (U) Nitto Denko Corporation, with paid-up capital of NTD 
404,997,000 (USD 1: NTD 33), was established and registered with the 
Taiwan authorities in 1969.  Nitto Denko manufactures PVC insulating 
tapes and industrial tapes.  Nitto Denko, a Japanese-owned company, 
has two factories in Taiwan with 250 employees. 
 
¶3. (U) Both Tomokazu Himura and Chun-lin Chen of Nitto Denko were 
cooperative and confirmed receipt of one Thermo Tracer unit (Type 
TH7102WX, Serial No. 3011006) in July 2003.  During the production 
process, the thermo tracer is used to monitor the temperature of the 
PVC tape.  AIT/K personnel physically inspected the thermo tracer 
and were allowed to photograph the controlled item.  Nitto Denko 
also provided AIT/K with copies of the relevant invoice and airway 
bill. 
 
¶4. (U) All indications were that the thermo tracer has been used in 
accordance with the export license. AIT's visit disclosed no adverse 
information about the firm and its suitability to receive sensitive 
U.S. products. 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to internal AIT/K records, it may be worth noting 
that a US affiliated company of Nitto Denko (Japan) was the subject 
of an investigation in 1989 involving suspected violation of trade 
valuation laws.  However, the case appears unrelated to the 
Kaohsiung subsidiary's suitability to receive sensitive US 
products.
