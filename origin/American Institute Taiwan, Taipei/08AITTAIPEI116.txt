SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: TAIWAN'S UN REFERENDUM 
 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage January 24 on the Taiwan Cabinet, which is set to resign en 
masse today, four days ahead of schedule; on the March presidential 
poll and the UN referendum; and on the U.S. Federal Reserve's 
interest-rate cut Tuesday and its impact on the global stock 
markets.  The pro-independence "Liberty Times" ran a news story on 
page six with the headline "[Taiwan's] Deputy Defense Minister Ko 
Cheng-heng:  Taiwan Should Develop Cruise Missiles."  In terms of 
editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the mass-circulation 
"Apple Daily" slammed President Chen Shui-bian for the DPP's 
proposed UN referendum by spelling out some serious consequences for 
Taiwan should the referendum fail to pass in March.  End summary. 
 
"A-Bian's Excretion" 
 
The mass-circulation "Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] 
editorialized (1/24): 
 
"The UN referendum initiated and manipulated by A-Bian was initially 
meant to be bundled with the presidential election and not really 
aimed for Taiwan to enter the United Nations.  It had drawn the KMT 
into playing the game by proposing a referendum for Taiwan to 
re-join the UN.  Now there are two referenda, and both are doomed to 
failure.  Frank Hsieh, who is unable to back down now, becomes an 
innocent victim [of the UN referendum].  But the consequences are 
more serious for Taiwan. 
 
There are several consequences [for Taiwan] should the UN referendum 
fail to pass:  First, China will be able to speak loudly and 
convincingly in the international community for its moves to 
suppress Taiwan, because it is the Taiwan people who do not want to 
join the UN.  China can even extend and interpret the development, 
claiming that, since the Taiwan people themselves believe that 
Taiwan is part of China, [Taiwan] does not need to join the UN. 
Such a theory can be backed up by figures [i.e. ballots cast in the 
referenda] and is thus very convincing.  Second, the international 
powers that used to be sympathetic to Taiwan, such as the U.S. 
Congress, Japan's Diet and the European Parliament, will find it 
difficult to speak out for Taiwan any more, because the Taiwan 
people themselves have decided against the island's UN bid.  Third, 
what is most embarrassing will be the [reaction of the] island's 
allies that have been proposing and supporting Taiwan's UN bid over 
the past decades. ...  Fourth, Taiwan-centered awareness and 
Taiwan's determination to decide for itself will be severely 
traumatized, and the development will deal a heavy blow to Taiwan's 
confidence in its democracy. 
 
"Who is the originator of this detestable proposal?  The answer is 
Chen Shui-bian.  Just for the sake of campaigning and for his own 
legacy in history, he has treated the sacred practice of referenda 
as a gambling stake and a tool, putting his country into such an 
embarrassing predicament.  Chen's move has also made Taiwan citizens 
feel uneasy about their right to referenda and done severe damage to 
his party's presidential candidate.  What kind of a president would 
do such a stupid thing that will incur such serious consequences?
