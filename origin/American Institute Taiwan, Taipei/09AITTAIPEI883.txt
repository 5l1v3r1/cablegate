SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S. PRESIDENT OBAMA 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage July 23 on the solar eclipse that happened on the morning 
of the 22nd; and on Taiwan's jobless rate, which surged to a record 
high in June.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, a column in 
the centrist, KMT-leaning "China Times" discussed the performance of 
U.S. President Barack Obama since he assumed office six months ago. 
The article cited what has been happening in Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
Iran lately and concluded that Obama is incapable of solving 
difficult problems in the world.  End summary. 
 
"Obama Is Incapable of Solving Difficult International Problems" 
 
The "International Lookout" column in the centrist, KMT-leaning 
"China Times" [circulation: 120,000] wrote (7/23): 
 
"U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said in a press conference 
that even though [the U.S.] military [forces] stationed in Iraq are 
decreasing, more troops are needed due to the continually 
deteriorating situation on the battlefield of Afghanistan.  As a 
result, the size of the Army will be increased by 22,000 soldiers. 
[Gates'] statement that 'the situation on the Afghanistan 
battlefield has continuously deteriorated' says it all about [U.S. 
President Barack] Obama's failure in his policy toward Afghanistan. 
... 
 
"Obama said he wants to end the war in Iraq, and indeed, a major 
portion of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq has been pulled out as 
planned.  But the misgivings caused by the withdrawal of troops are 
unsettling; the troops that have yet to be pulled out admitted that 
they are walled in and are no longer capable of doing anything or 
making contributions to Iraq's security.  All this will only 
increase the chances for infighting among different groups in Iraq. 
How long can such a fragile state of peace last?  Once a civil war 
breaks out, the United States' Iraq policy will collapse completely. 
...  Washington's relations with Moscow have not improved but 
deteriorated either. ...  As for the talks with Iran, Obama sounded 
more flexible originally, but the disputes concerning the 
presidential election in Iran have toughened his attitude again.  It 
appears that the chances are slim for the United States to achieve 
any breakthrough in terms of Iran's nuclear issue.  Obama vowed to 
shut down the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, but he still 
faces many difficulties.  The 'Voice of Germany' said Obama was an 
inexperienced Senator, who was elected president only because of his 
exceptional eloquence and political gifts and the people's general 
discontent with [President] Bush's policies.  People expected that 
Obama would solve the difficult problems in the world, but they get 
disappointed because of their overly high expectations."
