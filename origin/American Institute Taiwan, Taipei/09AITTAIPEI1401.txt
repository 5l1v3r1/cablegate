REF: STATE 117765 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Per reftel request, AIT/T contacted the end user, 
the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST)--the 
research and development arm of the Taiwan Ministry of National 
Defense Armaments Bureau--and visited the consignee, Carbon-Based 
Technology Incorporated (CBT).  We confirmed the orders with both 
end-user and consignee, and assess the consignee to be bona fide. 
End summary. 
 
CSIST 
----- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 25, Mr. Liao Wei-yao of the CSIST Procurement 
Office confirmed the order for reftel equipment from CBT listed on 
application 050197967. The procurement contract number is XC98Q20P. 
Mr. Liao stated the purpose of this equipment as "spare parts for 
Chung-Shyang II UAV ground control station with less 200 KM maximum 
range; Chung-Shyang II UVA has a 25 KM EO payload, is for 
surveillance, coastal patrol, and typhoon damage investigations." 
 
¶3. (SBU) On the same day, for application 050198220, Mr. Chen Wei-ho 
of the CSIST Procurement Office confirmed the order for reftel 
transmitter. According to Chen, CSIST bought the transmitter from 
CBT in 2008, and because the transmitter was still under the 
warranty when it broke down, CSIST has requested that CBT send the 
machine back to the manufacturer for repairs. [Note: the end user 
for the transmitter should be Mr. Chang Wen-tzung, Chief of 
Aerodynamics Section at CSIST's Aeronautical Systems Research 
Division, not the end user listed in reftel, Mr. Lian Yuan-hwang. 
End note.] 
 
Carbon-Based Technology Incorporated 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) On November 18, AIT/T econoff visited CBT and talked with 
company President Mr. Wen-long "Clement" Chung and General Manager 
David Lin.  In 2007, Chung and Lin both left the Aerospace 
Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC)--a state-owned aerospace 
enterprise that falls under the authority of the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs--to found CBT with five other former AIDC 
engineers.  The company now has 40 employees, all in Taichung. 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to Chung, CSIST has been the company's main 
customer since 2007, although CBT has some civil aviation and other 
non-military customers.  All of the company's clients are in Taiwan. 
Chung and Lin said they are familiar with restrictions on USML 
items. 
 
¶6. (SBU) CBT's offices are locked and alarmed after business hours. 
CBT does not usually keep items in its offices, however, and will 
likely deliver reftel items directly to CSIST.
