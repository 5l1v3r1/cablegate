Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel, AIT/T offers the following 
information on maritime security issues in Taiwan.  Taiwan's 
cooperation with the U.S. on maritime security issues is 
excellent, due in part to the importance of the shipping 
industry to the island's economy and Taiwan's exclusion from 
international organizations like the International Maritime 
Organization.  AIT and DHS in cooperation with Taiwan 
authorities are finishing preparations to establish a 
Container Security Initiative (CSI) presence in the Port of 
Kaohsiung.  We have also proposed to Taiwan the 
implementation of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Megaports 
program in Kaohsiung.  AIT Taipei's (AIT/T) Economic Section 
working closely with AIT Kaohsiung (AIT/K) is responsible for 
coordinating maritime security issues.  We look forward to 
the CSI presence to enhance that effort.  End summary. 
 
Excellent Cooperation 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Taiwan's maritime security cooperation with the U.S. 
is excellent.  It has enthusiastically welcomed U.S. 
proposals to establish the CSI and Megaports programs in 
Taiwan's harbors.  Taiwan's cooperation on maritime security 
is due in part to its desire to maintain Kaohsiung's 
competitiveness as traffic in Mainland China's ports grows 
more rapidly.  Because Taiwan is not a member of the IMO it 
cannot participate directly in many international maritime 
security initiatives.  This situation also enhances Taiwan's 
willingness to participate indirectly via U.S. government 
channels and to cooperate with U.S. initiatives.  Taiwan 
would welcome more engagement from DHS/ICE, CBP and the U.S. 
Coast Guard on maritime security.  Taiwan's Kaohsiung Harbor 
is the world's sixth largest container port. 
 
Programs in Implementation 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) CSI -- DHS/ICE is currently finalizing discussions 
with AIT Washington on the establishment of a CSI presence in 
the Port of Kaohsiung.  A DHS/ICE assessment team visited the 
harbor in September 2004.  The Taiwan government has 
identified office space for the CSI officials and is working 
with AIT and DHS/ICE to make the necessary preparations.  A 
TDY DHS/ICE officer will arrive in late March to finalize 
local preparations if the DHS/AIT memorandum of agreement on 
implementation is completed by that time.  We hope that the 
first CSI officers will arrive in the coming months. 
 
¶4. (U) Megaports -- On instruction from the Department of 
Energy, we have expressed to the Taiwan authorities USG 
interest in implementing the Megaports program in Taiwan. 
The various Taiwan agencies that would be involved in 
Megaports implementation have all responded positively.  We 
have asked them to identify a time when a DOE team might come 
to Taiwan to discuss the program's details.  Taiwan's 
Executive Yuan Counter-terrorism Office will coordinate the 
visit and has indicated that it will soon inform us of a 
suitable time. 
 
AIT Coordination of Maritime Security Initiatives 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5. (U) AIT/T Economic Section is responsible for overall 
coordination of maritime security issues.  The Economic 
Section works closely with AIT/K, which is the primary 
liaison with the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau and other local 
officials concerned with security at the Port of Kaohsiung. 
AIT/T's main link with DHS/ICE is the ICE Attache at the U.S. 
Consulate General in Hong Kong.  AIT/T and AIT/K communicate 
with the ICE Attache regularly by phone and e-mail.  AIT 
looks forward to the assignment of permanent DHS officers to 
AIT/K under the CSI program to enhance our maritime security 
efforts.  At that time, AIT/T and AIT/K will have to 
reexamine how maritime security issues are coordinated.
