SUBJECT: MEGAPORTS TEAM COMPLETES KAOHSIUNG SITE SURVEY 
 
 
¶1.  A Department of Energy (DOE) Megaports Program team headed by 
Program Officer Michael Bedke of the National Nuclear Safety 
Administration conducted a site survey of the Port of Kaohsiung the 
week of July 10.  The team gathered the necessary information to 
prepare a preliminary plan for installation of radiation detection 
equipment at the port.  Another team will return to Kaohsiung around 
mid-September to brief stakeholders on the plan and obtain 
agreement/approval from terminal operators and Taiwan officials. 
The team expects that installation of the equipment will begin in 
spring or summer of 2007 and last six to eight months. 
 
¶2.  The Megaports team also informed Taiwan Customs officials that 
DOE would arrange training for up to 10 Taiwan officials at DOE's 
Volpentest Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response 
Training and Education (HAMMER) Center at Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory in Washington State.  The training will likely take place 
in late August or mid September 2006.  Additional training will be 
provided for technical staff in the late stages of the construction 
phase. 
 
¶3.  This telegram was cleared by DOE Megaports Program Officer 
Michael Bedke.
