SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  The Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu (DPP) has 
served at her new post for three months as of March 25. Up to now, 
City Government employees and the public are generally neutral 
toward their new mayor.  While many KMT City Council members 
privately hold a negative opinion of Chen Chu, an opinion 
exacerbated by the recent controversial removal of the Chiang 
Kai-shek statue, the dynamics of her public relationship with the 
Kaohsiung City Council will only become clear once the official City 
Council sessions start on March 30.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) The most notable event of Mayor Chen Chu's tenure so far has 
been the removal of Chiang Kai-shek's statue from the Kaohsiung 
Culture Center, which occurred on March 13.  The local media 
described the removal as "shabby and sneaky" as there had been no 
public discussion, nor any consensus reached within the City 
Council.  During the removal, some pan-blue elected officials, 
Legislators, City Councilors and their supporters made a show of 
trying to stop the removal but were blocked and dispersed by a 
contingent of 500 police officers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A Kuomintang (KMT) official told AIT/K that they believed 
that the controversial action was recommended to President Chen by 
the Southern Taiwan Society (a group that advocates Taiwan 
independence, see reftel) during the President's last visit to 
Kaohsiung.  Many people interpreted the removal as an effort to 
please local Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supporters. 
However, many people and most local media did not agree with the 
secretive and hasty way the city government carried out the statue's 
 
SIPDIS 
removal. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) This KMT official went on to say that since the removal of 
the statue defaced government property and was done without the 
approval of  the City Council, the KMT would urge its City 
Councilors to protest (note: the Speaker of City Council Chuan 
Chi-wang is a KMT member).  As a result of the removal, the City 
Council held a two-day supplemental session on March 26 and 27 to 
look into whether the city government had violated any regulations 
by removing the statue.  The DPP Councilors attending the session 
wore T-shirts emblazoned with "justice for the 228 Incident victims" 
to show their support for the city government.  Mayor Chen stated in 
the session that the removal of the statue was not intended to cause 
ethnic conflict but to look after the interests of all groups while 
pursuing transitional justice and fair treatment for all ethnic 
communities. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) One DPP official told AIT/K that Mayor Chen probably was 
trying to impress people with her quick and decisive way of doing 
things.  And in fact, many DPP supporters did applaud her for this 
accomplishment after having been in office for only three months. 
Jason Hu, Director of Kaohsiung's Economic Development Office, 
however, told AIT/K that Chen Chu generally feels overwhelmed by all 
her duties.  Apparently, he said, Chen Chu anticipated having less 
pressure in this job than in her previous position as chairperson of 
the Council of Labor Affairs, but she may now be growing worried 
about getting in over her head given the broad scope of her duties 
here along with the possibility of a deteriorating relationship with 
the City Council. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mayor Chen has kept a low profile during her first three 
months in office, even when facing the City Council.  In a recent 
speech, she emphasized that she has been striving hard to craft 
policies to boost Kaohsiung's economic development.  Her statement 
indicated that she understands that boosting the economy, not 
political action, is her major task if she wants to increase her 
support in Kaohsiung City.
