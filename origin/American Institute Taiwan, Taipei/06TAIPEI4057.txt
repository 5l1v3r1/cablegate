SUBJECT: Business and Other Associations Stay Neutral on Tight 
Kaohsiung Mayoral Race 
 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Professional associations, business groups, and 
unions in Kaohsiung are choosing to remain neutral rather than risk 
backing a potential loser in the tight mayoral race between KMT 
Candidate Huang Chun-ying and DPP Candidate Chen Chu on December 9. 
Some AIT/K contacts suggest that corruption allegations against 
President Chen and his family are weighing heavily on Chen Chu's 
prospects in the December 9 election.  End Summary. 
 
Teachers Learn Hard Lessons from the Past 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The 9000-member Kaohsiung Teachers' Association is 
reluctant to openly endorse a candidate in the still neck and neck 
December 9 Kaohsiung mayoral election, although it has traditionally 
affiliated itself with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).  The 
Chairman told AIT/K that the Association learned a "hard lesson" 
eight years ago after several candidates they publicly backed in 
city council and legislative elections were ensnared in bribery 
scandals once elected.  Since then, the Association has chosen not 
to back individual candidates, instead preferring to provide members 
with the results of surveys that it conducts on candidates' views 
and policies on matters of interest to the Association. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Chairman, nevertheless, was quick to praise former 
Kaohsiung City mayor Frank Hsieh (DPP) for taking action on the 
Association's main concerns, including improving the teacher 
retirement system.  While the Association has had less interaction 
with KMT candidate Huang Chun-ying, the Vice Chairman noted that 
then-Deputy Mayor Huang played a significant role 10 years ago in 
helping local teachers establish the Association.  The Association's 
executive secretary stressed that it is very important for all 
teachers and the Association to maintain neutrality because in the 
past politics has had too much influence on Taiwan education policy. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Chairman lamented that the focus of Kaohsiung's 
mayoral election has shifted from city development to the issue of 
corruption and rivalry between President Chen Shui-bian and KMT 
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.  Stressing that the Association's main 
concern is with educational reform, the Chairman expressed 
frustration over the failure of Taiwan society to keep politics 
separate from education. 
 
Political Neutrality as Good Business 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Several business and labor leaders recently told AIT/K 
that they also are not planning to endorse a particular candidate 
for Kaohsiung mayor, stressing that maintaining public neutrality is 
their best strategy.  China Steel Union (CSU) Representative Wu 
Shun-tsai said that his union has adopted this stance, but only 
after a proposal to ask members to choose a candidate to support in 
the election proved too controversial.  Wu added that in the past 
the CSU has made financial contributions to legislators who can 
influence issues that impact the Union and its members. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Despite a public display of neutrality, eighty percent of 
Kaohsiung Architects Association members identify ideologically with 
the DPP, Association head Kuo Min-neng recently told AIT/K.  Kuo, 
also a member of the Board of Directors of the city-owned Bank of 
Kaohsiung, noted he had worked closely with former Kaohsiung mayor 
Frank Hsieh, adding that he is concerned DPP candidate Chen Chu 
could lose the election because of President Chen's scandals and the 
Kaohsiung Metro corruption probe.  Despite having "Green" 
credentials, Kuo said that he and his colleagues plan to remain 
publicly neutral because their livelihoods depend heavily on being 
able to work with the government on land use issues.  As a result, 
they have hedged their bets by providing financial support to both 
the DPP and KMT mayoral candidates. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Kaohsiung Computer Association President Henry Wang, also 
a long-time Green supporter, told AIT/K that the election is 
extremely close, predicting that youth and swing voters will play a 
determining factor.  Wang credited Frank Hsieh with improving 
Kaohsiung's image.  He complained that the pan-Blue mass media often 
distorts the DPP's performance, which has a disproportionate impact

on the young, who tend to uncritically accept television news 
reports as fact. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Reluctant to endorse one party over another, Kaohsiung 
Industrial Association President Alex Horng told AIT/K that 
Kaohsiung needs an aggressive mayor who has the ability to deliver 
results.  While Association members want a clean and effective 
government, he added, they would prefer a corrupt government that 
can deliver results to one that is ultra-clean but ineffective.  A 
super-clean politician cannot navigate the underworld of Taiwan 
politics, Horng argued, citing the Kaohsiung Metro as an example of 
a project that is nearing completion despite corruption allegations. 
 Nevertheless, allegations of President Chen's corruption are an 
embarrassment to Taiwan, Horng observed, and he predicted this issue 
will have a large negative impact on Chen Chu and other DPP 
candidates.
