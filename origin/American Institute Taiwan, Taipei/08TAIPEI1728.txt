SUBJECT: DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS: TAIWAN TO (AGAIN) SEEK 
LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL OF ICCPR 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Taiwan's executive branch will request the 
Legislative Yuan to ratify the UN International Covenants on 
Civil and Political Rights and Economic, Social, and Cultural 
Rights, despite Taiwan's lack of standing in the UN, 
President Ma Ying-jeou announced at a December 10 ceremony 
marking International Human Rights Day.  Ma's address, which 
was interrupted both by pro-Tibet activists and by an 
individual protesting the government's demolishment of an 
aging leprosy sanatorium, emphasized the government's 
commitment to preserving democratic freedoms and guaranteeing 
human rights.  Ma did not halt his speech, but acknowledged 
the disturbances by observing that democratic Taiwan welcomes 
the expression of differing opinions as long as they do not 
infringe on the rights of others or break the law.  Ma 
presented the 2008 Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award to 
Dr. Sima Samar, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights 
Commission and founder of the Shuhada Organization, an NGO 
dedicated to the welfare and progress of Afghan people.  End 
Summary. 
 
Executive Yuan to Request Legislature Ratify UN Conventions 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou used remarks at the 
2008 Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award ceremony to 
announce his decision to instruct the Executive Yuan to 
submit on December 11 the UN International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) to the 
Legislative Yuan (LY) for ratification.   Ma noted that, 
although a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, Taiwan has never ratified the ICCPR or ICESCR. 
(Comment: This is partly because Taiwan lacks status in the 
UN, but also due to Taiwan's internal politics.  Taiwan's 
Executive Yuan, under DPP President Chen Shui-bian, began 
seeking to pass the covenants in 2001 but failed to win the 
support of the KMT-dominated LY.  With both branches of 
government now in KMT control, however, chances of passage 
are far higher.  End comment.) 
 
Taiwan Still a "Beacon of Democracy" 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) In his remarks, Ma also addressed recent criticisms 
leveled by opposition DPP supporters at the administration's 
handling of demonstrations against ARATS Chairman Chen 
Yun-Lin's November 3-7 visit to Taiwan and recent detentions 
of opposition DPP officials.  During the speech, two 
pro-Tibet activists held up a Tibetan flag and picture of the 
Dalai Lama, presumably protesting Ma's recent comments that 
now was not an appropriate time for a visit by the Dalai 
Lama.  Later in the speech, another protester criticized 
Taiwan's "fake" democracy, pulled out a banner and shouted 
"the government intrudes upon the human rights of patients at 
the Lo Sheng Sanatorium," referring to the government's move 
to demolish part of the facility where persons who had 
Hansen's disease have lived for decades.  The President cited 
the disruptions as indications of the state of freedom of 
expression on Taiwan.  He noted, though, that this freedom 
must be exercised in accordance with the law and without 
infringing on the rights of others.  Having elections is not 
enough as Taiwan's democracy enters a new stage.  There must 
be real guarantees of freedom, human rights, and rule of law. 
 Ma cited as an example his statements to government agencies 
on the necessity of obtaining court orders for wiretaps.  In 
addition, to protect the rights of the accused, all police 
interrogation rooms should be equipped with audio and video 
recording devices to deter any abuses. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Unlike the autocratic past, Taiwan today stands as a 
society dedicated to upholding human rights and democracy, Ma 
stressed, pointing out that Freedom House has continued to 
rate Taiwan a fully free society since its 1996 annual 
 
TAIPEI 00001728  002 OF 002 
 
 
Freedom in the World report.  Ma recounted President Bush's 
congratulatory letter to Ma on his election this year, in 
which President Bush commended Taiwan as a "beacon of 
democracy."  Ma assured the audience that Taiwan will remain 
firmly committed to preserving democratic freedoms and 
guaranteeing human rights. 
 
Taiwan Foundation for Democracy 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) In 2002, MOFA established the Taiwan Foundation for 
Democracy (TFD) to consolidate Taiwan's democracy, strengthen 
its commitment to human rights domestically, and create 
strong links with international organizations promoting 
democracy.  TFD began operations in 2003 and elected LY 
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng as its first chairman.  The TFD is 
governed by a total of fifteen trustees and five supervisors, 
representing political parties, the government, academia, 
NGOs, and the business sector.  The Taiwan authorities 
provide primary funding for the Foundation. 
 
The Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) In 2006, TFD established an annual Asia Democracy and 
Human Rights Award to honor individuals or organizations that 
have demonstrated long-term commitment to advancing democracy 
or human rights through peaceful means in Asia.  The award 
consists of a small sculpture and a USD 100,000 grant.  This 
year's award was granted to Dr. Sima Samar, Chair of the 
Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission and the 
founder of the Shuhada Organization, which provides health 
care, education, orphanage, and training services in 
Afghanistan and to Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
