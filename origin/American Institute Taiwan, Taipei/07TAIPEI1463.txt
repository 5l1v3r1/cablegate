SUBJECT: Disarray in Kaohsiung Organizing Committee May Cause IWGA 
to Reconsider 2009 World Games Location 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: AIT/K has learned that differences within the DPP 
led to the resignation in May of World Games Kaohsiung Organizing 
Committee (KOC) chairperson Chen I-Hung.  Chen was replaced briefly 
by Kaohsiung City Government Deputy Secretary General Emily Hsu, who 
was succeeded by former Olympic medalist Chi Cheng on June 25.  The 
disarray in the KOC reportedly is sparking discussions in the 
International World Games Association (IWGA) about whether to pull 
the 2009 Games out of Kaohsiung.  Meanwhile, Beijing has been 
pressing the IWGA to have the Games relocated to a city in mainland 
China, according to our contacts.  One of the agenda items at an 
upcoming IWGA-KOC meeting in August is the possible relocation of 
the 2009 Games.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The resignation of World Games Kaohsiung Organizing 
Committee (KOC) Chairperson Chen I-hung was triggered by tensions 
within the DPP, a KOC contact recently told AIT/K.  Chen I-hung, a 
supporter of presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, was forced to 
resign by aides of Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, a supporter of former 
Premier Su Tseng-chang, after he had repeatedly expressed 
frustration that Su's Executive Yuan was not providing the 
assistance and funds needed to move the Games forward.  The IWGA, 
which had been under the impression that Chen was doing an excellent 
job, was shocked to hear the news of his ouster, our contact said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Emily Hsu, Chen I-Hung's brief replacement, found the 
organization in such disarray that she called for assistance from 
the Presidential Office, which sent an official to Kaohsiung to 
assess the situation.  Subsequently, the KOC Board of Directors 
decided to appoint former Olympic medalist Chi Cheng to replace Hsu. 
 The KOC Board also hired Victor Wang as Sports Director, a position 
that has been vacant since March 2007. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) AIT/K staff attended the high profile handover ceremony 
from Emily Hsu to Chi Cheng on June 25.  In addition to Mayor Chen 
Chu, both Kaohsiung vice mayors, many city government bureau 
directors and city councilors participated in this ceremony, which 
was sponsored by the Mayor's office.  The Mayor, Emily Hsu, and Chi 
Cheng all praised former chair Chen I-Hung's contribution to such a 
"fine organization," and promised a final concentrated "hard push, 
working together" for the dignity not just of Kaohsiung, but of 
Taiwan, to ensure the World Games 2009 would be a rousing success. 
Although the handover received a great deal of positive press 
attention, some locals at the event expressed concern that neither 
Chi nor Wang are native to Kaohsiung.  Others doubted Chi's 
abilities since she has no municipal government experience and is 
also concurrently heading the Deaf Olympics. 
 
¶5. (SBU) AIT/K's KOC contact, who is frustrated with factional 
politics and corruption in the organization, will also resign.  Our 
contact reports that different bureaus in the KOC hire only favored 
contractors and money is often transferred to individual pockets. 
James Du, son of Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng, is slated to 
replace our contact.  Despite widespread complaints that Du often 
oversteps his bounds in his current job in the Kaohsiung Mayor's 
office, our contact notes that Du is eager to serve in the KOC. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Meanwhile, our contacts tell us, the IWGA is discussing 
whether or not to pull the 2009 World Games out of Kaohsiung.  The 
IWGA president has confided to AIT/K contacts that the disarray in 
the KOC is triggering second thoughts about whether to hold the 
World Games in Kaohsiung.  According to our contacts, Beijing has 
been courting the IWGA for months in hopes of having the Games 
relocated to a city in mainland China.  An upcoming meeting between 
the KOC and the IWGA in August will include an agenda item on 
whether the 2009 World Games should stay in Kaohsiung or be 
reassigned to another city.
