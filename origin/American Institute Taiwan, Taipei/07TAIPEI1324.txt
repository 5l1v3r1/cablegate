SUBJECT:  Taiwan Auctions 2nd Insolvent Bank in 2007 
 
REF:  TAIPEI 1270 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  In early June Taiwan financial regulators successfully auctioned 
off the Taitung Business Bank (TBB).  ABN AMRO Bank became the first 
foreign bank to win bidding for a problem bank and will become third 
largest foreign bank in Taiwan after it takes over TBB.  TBB was the 
second insolvent bank auctioned within ten days, largely depleting 
Taiwan's RTC funds.  Another five problem banks still need 
resolution.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Two Banks Auctioned in Ten Days 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The Taiwan Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) 
auctioned TBB to ABN AMRO on June 8.  ChinaTrust Commercial Bank 
(CCB) won an auction for Enterprise Bank of Hualien (EBH) (reftel) 
at the end of May.  EBH, TBB, and Chinese Bank were three insolvent 
banks placed in receivership in early January 2007.  The CDIC will 
auction Chinese Bank in July or August. 
 
Cost and Compensation 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  The bidding for TBB (as with EBH) was for the compensation 
wanted to cover the insolvent bank's liability gap (i.e., the excess 
of debts over assets).  ABN AMRO Bank wanted to take over TBB's 32 
bank branches and assume TBB's liability gap of NT$10 billion 
(US$303 million) for CDIC compensation of NT$6.9 billion (US$209 
million).  Thus, ABN AMRO Bank will pay about NT$97 million for each 
branch, slightly less than the NT$116 million (US$3.5 million) paid 
by CCB for acquisition of EBH branches. 
 
Foreign Banks Increase Market Share 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  ABN AMRO Bank will take over TBB within 100 days.  The takeover 
will increase the number of its branches from five to 36, behind 
only Standard Chartered Bank's 86 branches and Citibank's 65 
branches.  Standard Chartered Bank acquired Hsinchu International 
Bank late last year, and Citibank acquired Bank of Overseas Chinese 
in March 2007.  The three mergers will increase the number of 
foreign banks' banking offices from 96 to 230, and their combined 
market share (in terms of banking offices) will increase from less 
than 3% to over 8%. 
 
Depleting RTC Funds 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  The CDIC will pay NT$11.4 billion (US$345 million) to compensate 
CCB and ABN AMRO Bank for taking over EBH and TBB.  The 
reimbursement will reduce Taiwan's RTC funds to NT$28.6 billion 
(US$867 million), insufficient to address the five remaining problem 
banks, according to the Banking Bureau (BB).  The five problem banks 
include a bank and a trust company placed in receivership in early 
2007 and three banks under BB surveillance. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  Due to insufficient RTC funding, Taiwan will need to rely on 
other methods to resolve problem banks.  It will likely continue to 
maintain strict branching restrictions to encourage good banks to 
acquire bad banks for expansion.
