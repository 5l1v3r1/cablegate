¶1. Summary: Per reftel request, AIT/T contacted the end user, the 
Taiwan Ministry of National Defense (MND) Arsenal Readiness 
Development Center (ARDC), to confirm the order.  Because the 
incoming cable did not indicate the commodities' quantities, AIT/T 
also contacted the foreign consignee, Yang Technology Company, to 
re-confirm the order.  Our findings indicate Yang Technology ordered 
more than ARDC requested due to the company's expectation of the the 
MND's future supply needs.  End summary. 
 
ARDC 
---- 
 
¶2. Lieut. Yang Tzi-shin from ARDC's Procurement Office told AIT that 
ARDC has awarded many contracts to Yang Technology over the past few 
years, including one signed February 17, 2009 (procurement number of 
GP98253P123PE) for 32 electric lines and 25 gyroscope wires. 
Another two active contracts were both signed on March 13, 2009: 
procurement number GI98020P050P2E for 12 214-type lines, number 
GI98020P050P1 for 72 364-type inner cables, 12 telecommunication 
cables, and 13 connecting plugs. 
 
Yang Technology 
--------------- 
 
¶3. Sales representative Mr. Yang Yung-chen from Yang Technology told 
AIT that since the company's founding, all of its customers have 
been connected to the Taiwan military.  [Note: According to 
background information from the company registration database 
provided by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), this company 
was established in October 1991.  End note.] 
 
¶4. When asked which specific contract with ARDC prompted Yang 
Technology's order to Relli Technology, Mr. Yang stated that, in the 
past, the company always made orders to U.S. suppliers according the 
quantity requested on each procurement contract with the Taiwan 
military.  This time, however, based on the U.S. supplier's minimum 
suggested order, and Yang Technology's experience of the spare-part 
needs of the Taiwan military, the company placed an order for a 
larger quantity and variety of parts. Yang said all purchased items 
will not necessarily be for ARDC only, but may also be sold to other 
MND units.
