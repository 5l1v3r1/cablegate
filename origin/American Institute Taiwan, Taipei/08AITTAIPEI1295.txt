¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel request, AIT Kaohsiung visited the Air Force 
Institute of Technology to meet with Colonel Yang Hsing-bang and 
other officers who are responsible for the procurement and use of 
the United States Munitions List (USML) item in question.  AIT/K 
also visited the local consignee, Sense Tek, and interviewed the 
company's owner, Mr. Lin Ke-Long.  Both interviewed parties 
confirmed that the Constant Speed Drive (CSD) would be procured only 
to be used as a student training aid at the Institute.  Both 
organizations noted that the CSD they are purchasing is used and 
out-of-date.  They only want to use the CSD as a learning tool. 
Sense Tek will cut the CSD into cross sections and put it on display 
as a model for students to view.  Both organizations supplied 
contracts that were used to purchase the CSD and both seem like 
reliable recipients of the CSD. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Below are the answers to questions listed in the reftel.

orders, for this proposed transaction? 
 
Yes, the company provided contracts and purchase orders. 
 
--What role will Sense Tek play in the proposed transaction?  Will 
Sense Tek be handling or storing the items listed on the

Sense Tek is the consignee and will also be the one to cut the CSD 
into cross sections and turn it into a display model for the Air 
Force Institute.  The item will be stored in a locked warehouse 
while the CSD is at their facility.  Locking the warehouse is the 
extent of their security procedure. 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item?  How exactly will 
the component be used as a "student training aid"? 
 
The CSD will be used a as learning tool in a classroom setting for

future mechanics or engineers.
