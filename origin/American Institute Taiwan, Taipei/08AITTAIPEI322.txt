SUBJECT: EXBS: TAIWAN MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE - FEBRUARY AND FIRST 
WEEK OF MARCH 2008 
 
¶I.  BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY 
MANAGERS: 
 
(SBU) The Export Control Task Force, Bureau of Foreign Trade of the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs, added two new staff members: Ms. 
Shu-Chu Jiang to work on Gameplan issues and Mr. Ching-Yun Huang to 
back-up Dr. Wally Su.  While not yet confirmed, it appears Mr. Huang 
may take over Dr. Su's portfolio when Dr. Su departs this summer for 
a foreign posting.  In addition, Mr. Jack Tuan of the Ministry of 
Justice Investigation Bureau, who has been the main interlocutor for 
the EXBS Advisor, will be moving to his new posting in Washington, 
D.C. this summer. 
 
II. COMPLETED ACTIONS FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD. 
¶A.  SITE ASSESSMENTS AND MEETINGS DURING REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
(SBU) On February 27, the EXBS Advisor met with officials of the 
Department of Investigation, Directorate General of Customs of the 
Ministry of Finance, to discuss Taiwan Customs' active participation 
in EXBS programs.  The Customs officials stated that they have been 
very impressed with the substance and organization of the programs 
they have attended and look forward to participating in future 
programs.  This meeting was in conjunction with the regular 
consultations that CSI-Kaohsiung and CSI-Keelung representatives 
hold with Customs. 
 
¶B.  BLUE LANTERN: 
 
(U)  The EXBS Advisor completed two Blue Lantern check requests, 
including three site visits, and reported the findings to 
State/DDTC. 
 
¶C. TRAINING CONDUCTED DURING REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
¶1. (U) From February 20 - 22, the Commodity Identification Training 
program was conducted in Kaohsiung.  Approximately 45 Taiwan 
officials attended the training.  The Department of Energy trainers 
did an excellent job conveying technical aspects of identifying 
controlled commodities.  The "show and tell" portions of the 
training were especially effective.  The Taiwan attendees also 
properly identified all commodities during the practical exercise 
parts of the program.  A reporting cable from Washington on the 
program is expected shortly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) From March 6 - 7, the EXBS Advisor and John Albert from 
ISN/CATR met with Taiwan interagency export control officials for an 
intensive briefing on policy and control list changes made by the 
Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) in 2006 and 2007.  Taiwan was well 
prepared, with written and verbal questions and comments, a number 
of which were highly technical and sophisticated in nature.  The two 
biggest areas of concern were controls on machine tools and 
electronics.  There were several questions related to the difference 
between regime lists and national implementation of the lists. 
While Taiwan has adopted all four regime lists into its national 
export control system, Taiwan is not fully knowledgeable about 
applying the control language to the items that are being exported. 
Until this briefing, Taiwan has not had access to expert knowledge 
on how to interpret the list or how the list is constructed.  This 
lack of access appears to complicate its ability to meaningfully 
implement regime lists, even though that is the desire.  Taiwan 
asked for continued access to this type of expert information so 
that it can continue to improve its export control system.  At this 
point, without the U.S. providing these briefings, Taiwan has no 
other channel for resolving questions related to implementation and 
interpretation of the lists.  The EXBS Advisor extends special 
gratitude and congratulations to John for his excellent work during 
the two days. 
 
III. UPCOMING TRAINING: 
 
¶1. (U)  A preparatory meeting for Internal Control Program Software 
development, implemented by the Department of State through a 
contractor, is being planned for March 27 and 28. 
 
¶2.  (U) A five-day Target and Risk Management Training, implemented 
by Customs and Border Protection, is being planned for the week of 
April 14 in Kaohsiung. 
 
IV. RED FLAG ISSUES: 
 
None.
