¶1. (SBU) Summary: Per reftel request, AIT/T econoff visited the 
Ameleks Corporation and talked with Mr. Huang Johnny Jiun-kai, Chief 
Executive Officer; Mr. Jimmy Hsiung, Chief Strategy Officer; and Ms. 
Angie Wu, Program Manager.  The information collected demonstrates 
the bona fides of the subject brokers.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mr. Huang founded Ameleks in 1985 after leaving his job 
with the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST), the 
research and development arm of the Ministry of National Defense 
Armaments Bureau.  Mr. Hsiung started to work in Ameleks two years 
ago after retiring from the Communication Research Lab (CRL), which 
is also affiliated with the Taiwan military. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The registration information for the company matches 
information included in the database of the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs Bureau of Foreign Trade. Ameleks has 17 employees: 11 in the 
Taipei office and the remaining six in the company's laboratory and 
repair shop in Lung Tan, Taoyuan County.  The Lung Tan office is 
inside CSIST's campus. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ameleks's main business is importing and maintaining 
telecommunications equipment and subsystems.  It is the sole 
representative in Taiwan for Condor Systems Incorporated.  All of 
its customers are in Taiwan, and the majority of these are Taiwan 
military or affiliated entities, including CRL and CSIST. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Ameleks office is in a commercial building that has a 
guard on duty during the day, and is protected by an electronic 
alarm system after hours.  Amaleks's own office is also equipped 
with a separate alarm system. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mr. Huang and Mr. Hsiung are familiar with USML 
regulations.  Huang complained that U.S. export regulations have 
gotten so strict that the company is often unable to supply its 
customers' orders, and that manufacturers from countries such as 
Canada or Israel have no problems supplying alternatives in most 
cases. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Post and our Taiwan law-enforcement sources have no 
derogatory information concerning the subject broker.
