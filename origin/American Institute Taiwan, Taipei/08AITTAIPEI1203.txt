¶1. Per reftel request, AIT/T visited the end user, Legend Laser 
Inc.(Legend).  Legend's General Manager, Sherman Kuo, and Sales 
Division Secretary, Maggie Tsai, provided the following 
information. 
 
Responses to the Questions in Reftel Para 4 
------------------------------------------- 
¶2.  Legend received subject shipments, except for the three 
Cleartran Zinc Sulfide (DDTC case 050082501), from Wavelength 
Technology.  Mr. Kuo explained that the company ordered three pieces 
of Cleartran Zinc Selenide lenses, not the Zinc Sulfide as indicated 
in case number 050082501.  In addition to the subject lenses, Legend 
also purchased BK7 and doublet cemented focus lenses from 
Wavelength. 
 
¶3. Legend receives lenses machined to its specifications by 
Wavelength containing Zinc Selenide.  Legend places orders with 
Wavelength in Singapore and receives shipments directly from 
Wavelength in Singapore. 
 
¶4. Mr. Kuo states that he knows Wavelength has machining facilities 
in China and Singapore but does not know where Wavelength does the 
machining for the subject lenses. 
 
¶5. After receiving finished lenses, Legend assembles them to 
laser-marking machines according to Legend's customer requests. 
Prior to the assembly, Legend stores those lenses in a locked 
storage container in a locked storage room. 
 
¶6. The company was established in 1984 and has 40 employees.  Legend 
manufactures laser-marking machines.  It imports lenses and 
components, then assemble them into customer-specific machines. 
 
 
¶7. Legend has factories in the Taipei County, and service offices in 
Beijing, Shanghai, and Shencheng in China.  About 60 percent of its 
products go to China, and the rest to Taiwan.   Starting 2007, the 
company has sold a few machines to South Korea. 
 
¶8. Mr. Kuo said he is not familiar with USML restrictions since the 
company purchase lenses from Wavelength at sizes that are not 
controlled by USML.  He further stated that the actual sizes ordered 
by Wavelength could be 10-20 percent larger, which could be USML 
controlled.  Mr. Kuo stated that larger sizes are needed to properly 
machine the lenses to the specifications. 
 
¶9. Copies of purchase orders and invoices indicating the specific 
ordered and delivered items have been faxed to PMDDTC.
