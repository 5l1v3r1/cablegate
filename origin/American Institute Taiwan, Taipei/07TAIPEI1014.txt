SUBJECT: MEGAPORTS KAOHSIUNG - PROGRESS SO FAR AND PROSPECTS FOR THE 
FUTURE 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: The Megaports Program in Kaohsiung has made notable 
progress toward implementation over the last year.  Support for the 
program is strong among Taiwan agencies, and AIT sees no substantial 
obstacles to successful implementation in the near future.  As the 
world's sixth busiest container port with a growing cargo volume, 
this program (as well as the Container Security Initiative in both 
Kaohsiung and Keelung ports) is important to U.S. trade security. 
AIT looks forward to continuing to work with Washington agencies to 
bring this project to successful completion.  End summary. 
 
Progress to Date 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Megaports Program in Kaohsiung has made notable progress 
toward full implementation since the AIT-TECRO Memorandum of 
Understanding for the program was signed just under a year ago on 
May 30, 2006.  The Department of Energy Megaports Kaohsiung team has 
traveled to Kaohsiung and Taipei on five separate occasions since 
then. 
 
--June 2006 - The team visited to meet with officials and terminal 
operators and prepare for a technical survey of the port. 
 
--July 2006 - The technical survey was conducted to prepare a 
conceptual plan for the installation monitors at the port. 
 
--October 2006 - The team secured agreement from port authorities 
and terminal operators for the conceptual plan to identify radiation 
monitor locations. 
 
--January 2007 - A larger team conducted the engineering survey 
during two weeks to begin preparing a detailed and comprehensive 
plan for construction and installation of the monitors. 
 
AIT is currently waiting for the next DOE visit to secure the 
necessary commitments from port officials and terminal operators to 
the construction and installation plan.  During the visit, the 
Megaports team will seek to secure Taiwan Customs approval to allow 
the DHS Container Security Initiative (CSI) Office in Kaohsiung to 
monitor alarms generated by Megaports radiation detectors.  This 
approval will be sought based on an agreement between DHS Customs 
and Border Protection and DOE to work together to implement 
Megaports projects around the world. 
 
Strong Support in Taiwan 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) AIT is eager to move forward with the Megaports Program in 
Kaohsiung. We have devoted considerable resources to this effort in 
both Taipei and Kaohsiung.  If approvals are secured from Taiwan 
Customs, the CSI team in Kaohsiung will also play an important role 
in implementation. Support from the Taiwan stakeholders is also 
strong.  Cooperation from Customs and Harbor Bureau authorities in 
Kaohsiung has been excellent.  The agencies that oversee them in 
Taipei are also committed to the project at the highest levels. 
Terminal operators have expressed reservations about specific 
elements of the installation plan.  However, DOE Megaports officials 
have successfully addressed many of their concerns, and, to date, 
they are fully cooperating with implementation of the program.  We 
do not foresee any major obstacles to fully realizing the program in 
Kaohsiung. 
 
Important to Trade Security and U.S.-Taiwan Relations 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (U) Comment: The Megaports Program in Kaohsiung will make an 
important contribution to enhancing U.S. trade security.   Taiwan is 
the United States' ninth largest trading partner and Kaohsiung is 
the world's sixth busiest container port.  Although the port has 
slipped in world rankings, its container volume continues to grow. 
Last year, 9.7 million TEU's passed through the Port of Kaohsiung up 
3.2 percent from 2005.  Because Taiwan's cooperation with the 
program is so strong, we believe an exceptionally effective system 
can be implemented here as has been the case for CSI. 
 
¶5. (SBU) We also believe that disruption in the Megaports Program 
now could cause serious repercussions for other programs in Taiwan 
such as CSI and overall security and enforcement cooperation.
