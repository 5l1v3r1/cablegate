SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused December 
22 news coverage on the decision that an agreement on double 
taxation will not be signed at the fourth round of cross-Strait 
negotiations; on protests surrounding the ongoing cross-Strait 
negotiation; and the death of a seven-year-old boy after having the 
H1N1 vaccine.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, former 
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Nat Bellocchi wrote an 
op-ed, saying that the United States' Taiwan policy of maintaining 
the "status quo" has in fact "whittled away Taiwan's room for 
maneuver and consequently our own ability to maneuver."  Bellocchi 
urged the United States to show more of its support to Taiwan.  End 
summary. 
 
"U.S. Should Stop Fooling Around and Back Taiwan" 
 
Nat Bellocchi, former AIT Chairman and a special adviser of the 
Liberty Times Group, opined in the pro-independence, 
English-language "Taipei Times" circulation: 30,000 (12/22): 
 
"... The US itself is built on the precept of change.  The nation 
was born out of the belief that Americans have the vision, ingenuity 
and perseverance to make the world a better place.  Thus, our 
policies have always supported change ... in the right direction. 
That is why it is peculiar that in one specific area we cling to the 
'status quo' - our policy toward Taiwan. ... 
 
"All of this is important in view of the references in the US-China 
Joint Statement issued at the end of US President Barack Obama's 
visit to China, in which the two countries 'reiterated that the 
fundamental principle of respect for each other's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity is at the core of the three US-China joint 
communiqus.'  The US said this paragraph only referred to Tibet and 
East Turkestan, but China's foreign ministry emphatically stated it 
also referred to Taiwan. 
 
"These episodes illustrate how little attention and import the US 
has given to Taiwan.  By clinging to an imaginary 'status quo' we 
have allowed China to whittle away Taiwan's room for maneuver and 
consequently our own ability to maneuver.  What has been gained by 
limiting options? 
"By pretending to maintain stability and the status quo, we have 
undermined the possibilities for change in the right direction: a 
furtherance of democratic principles.  The US should be pointing to 
Taiwan as a model for peaceful transition to a system that is 
designed to endure peaceful transitions of power."
