¶1. (U) From April 6-10, Incident Command Systems Training, 
implemented by Customs and Border Protection, was held in Taipei. 
Forty-one high ranking officials from the National Security Bureau, 
the Coast Guard, the Office of Homeland Security of the Executive 
Yuan, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Customs Service, the 
National Fire Agency, the Ministry of Justice Investigations Bureau, 
the Army Command of the National Ministry of Defense, and the Bureau 
of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Economic Affairs attended the 
training.   The group was very knowledgeable in responding to 
incidents involving hazardous materials.  This course emphasized 
interagency cooperation and coordination, including immediate 
decisions for command and assignment of duties and responsibilities. 
 The course was delivered in lecture and practical exercise 
(incidents at seaport and airport) formats. 
 
¶2. (U) The first Internal Control Program software deployment was 
held in Hsinchu from April 16-17.  Twenty-five industry and science 
park representatives were trained on how to adapt the software to 
meet company-specific export control needs; screening potential 
customers against publicly available restricted party lists; and 
classifying controlled commodities. 
¶3. (U) From April 27-May 1, RADACAD/WMD Training, implemented by the 
Department of Energy, took place at PNNL HAMMER site in Richland, 
Washington.  Twenty-four Taiwan Customs officials from Taipei, 
Kaohsiung, Keelung, and Taichung ports attended the training.  Since 
the group was composed of officers who are involved in examining 
inbound and outbound cargo, they were able to directly apply the 
classroom training material to practical exercises and to scenarios 
they encounter during their normal work duty.
