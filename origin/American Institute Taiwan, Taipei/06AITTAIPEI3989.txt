SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Taiwan's monetary authorities in November started permitting 
banking institutions to lend NT Dollars (NTD) to foreign borrowers 
in Taiwan which may be used to finance direct investment, securities 
trading, and real estate purchases.  The new measure relaxes the 
conditions for using NTD loans as direct foreign investment 
(reported reftel) and is designed to reduce Taiwan's excess 
liquidity.  End summary. 
 
Industry Regulations 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) On November 13, Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) and the 
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) issued a joint statement that 
banking institutions will be permitted to lend NTD to foreign 
borrowers without residence in Taiwan after the Bankers Association 
adopts a set of voluntary regulations, which it did late November. 
 
Relaxation 
---------- 
 
¶3.  (U) According to the CBC, qualified foreign borrowers may be 
foreign individuals without permanent residence or foreign 
corporations without registration in Taiwan.  NTD loans to these 
foreign borrowers may be used to finance such activities as 
securities trading, real estate purchases, direct investment 
projects, and acquisition and mergers.  These NTD loans must be 
secured with collateral, except for intra-day loans which are used 
to pay for stocks purchased earlier the same day. 
 
To Reduce Excess Liquidity 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) A CBC official told AIT/T that the new measure is designed 
to reduce excess liquidity which has kept yield rates on 10-year 
public bonds below 2%, the second lowest in the world after only 
Japan.  The CBC official said low interest rates in Taiwan should 
attract foreign investors to use NTD loans to do merger and 
acquisitions (M&A) here.  He further noted low interest will also 
attract hedge funds to borrow NTD loans to finance securities 
transactions.  The CBC estimated that NTD loans required annually by 
hedge funds and foreign securities firms may reach NT$1.32 trillion 
(US$40 billion), equivalent to 90% of total postal savings currently 
placed on deposit with the CBC. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) It is unsound to expect hedge funds to resolve domestic 
excess liquidity problems.  The November 13 relaxation measure 
indicates the CBC's desperation to address excess liquidity issues 
which have remained in spite of the July 2006 measure permitting 
secured NTD loans to serve as foreign direct investment in Taiwan 
(reftel).  The CBC needs to issue additional negotiable certificates 
of deposit to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system.  The 
best solution would be a substantial expansion of private 
consumption and private investment.
