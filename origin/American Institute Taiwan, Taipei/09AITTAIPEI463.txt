¶1. Summary: Per reftel request, AIT confirmed reftel transaction 
details with the end user, and visited the foreign consignee to 
verify its bona fides.  End summary. 
 
¶2. On April 3, Mr. Liao in the Chung Shan Institute of Science & 
Technology (CSIST) Procurement Office confirmed the details of the 
contract with Pegasus for reftel commodities.   According to Mr. 
Liao, since the year 2000, Pegasus has won at least 15 bids issued 
by CSIST. 
 
¶3. On April 6, AIT/T visited Pegasus and talked to Chairperson Hou 
Hsuei-yen and President William Mar, who are also husband and wife. 
The couple established Pegasus in July 1998, and mainly import and 
sell microwave devices, transmitters-receivers, video transmitters, 
and telemetry transmitters.   Besides "Pegasus," they have 
registered two other company names including "Lamar-Tex Co., Ltd", 
and "Piu-Mar Tech Ltd." 
 
¶4. Both Mr. and Mrs. Mar are familiar with U.S.-origin defense 
re-export and retransfer restrictions.   CSIST contracts account for 
99 percent of Mr. and Mrs. Mar's business; the remaining one percent 
come from large-scale IC testing factories in the Hsin Chu Science 
Park.  They do not have an overseas office.
