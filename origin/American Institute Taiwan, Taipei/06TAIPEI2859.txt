SUBJECT: TAIWAN: TIP TIER 2 WATCH LIST POINTS DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 132274 
 
¶1. (U) Post delivered reftel talking points and non-paper to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Director General of North 
American Affairs Leo C.J. Lee on August 17.  Per reftel 
instructions, post emphasized that Taiwan was placed on the 
Tier 2 watch list for failing to show evidence of increasing 
efforts over the past year to address trafficking problems, 
especially relating to forced labor and sexual servitude 
among legally migrating Southeast Asian contract workers and 
brides.  Post also stressed that the first set of non-paper 
recommendations were "must do" items if Taiwan is to be 
removed from the Tier 2 watch list. 
 
¶2. (U) Post informed Director Lee that AIT is required to 
submit an interim assessment of Taiwan's progress toward 
redressing these and other anti-trafficking shortcomings, but 
stipulated that re-assessment of tier rankings would not 
occur until next year.  Post further advised that AIT will be 
working directly with other Taiwan authorites and 
non-governmental organizations to prepare the interim 
assessment and final report.  Director Lee noted that MOFA is 
not directly involved in Taiwan's anti-trafficking efforts, 
but offered MOFA's assistance in coordinating meetings and 
communications with the Executive and Legislative Yuan, the 
Ministry of Justice, the Council of Labor Affairs, and other 
Taiwan agencies involved in anti-TIP efforts.  MOFA/NAA 
Fourth Section Chief Constance Wang said Taiwan authorities 
could benefit from direct contact with their USG 
anti-trafficking counterparts through in-person or video 
conferencing.
