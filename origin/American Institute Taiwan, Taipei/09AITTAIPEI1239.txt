¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage October 17-19 on the Council of Grand Justices' 
constitutional interpretation regarding former President Chen 
Shui-bian's legal case; on a seminar held jointly by Taiwan's 
Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies (APS) and the U.S.-based 
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) discussing 
U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations under the Ma Ying-jeou and Obama 
administrations; and on President Ma Ying-jeou becoming KMT Chairman 
and the KMT's eighteenth national party congress over the weekend. 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, an op-ed in the 
conservative, pro-unification, English-language "China Post" foresaw 
that the United States and China are going to strengthen their 
political and economic relations.  This is because the United States 
needs China to deal with issues including the United States' 
economic woes, Iran, North Korea and climate change.  End summary. 
 
¶3. Sino-U.S. Relations 
 
"President Obama May Forge Stronger Bond with Beijing on China 
Trip" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language "China Post" 
[circulation: 30,000] editorialized (10/19): 
 
"As U.S. President Barack Obama prepares for his first visit to 
China next month, one inevitable question arises: How will the trip 
impact the U.S.-China relationship, which has already become one of 
the most important partnerships in the world today? 
 
"The answer seems obvious.  The impact will be for the partnership 
to strengthen and become more co-dependent, both politically and 
economically.  The Sino-U.S. partnership has been upgraded from 
being one between "competitors" to one between "strategic partners" 
over the past decade.  Furthermore, since Obama took office in 
January, ties have been ratcheted up one notch higher as the new 
president became beleaguered by a host of thorny issues, domestic as 
well as international, that need a helping hand from Beijing. ... 
 
"When Obama visits Beijing next month, he is expected to ask the 
Chinese to invest more in Treasurys, and he may reach some sort of 
quid pro quo with his host, like a reiteration of U.S. support for 
one China, as well as opposition to protectionism.  Obama, the new 
Nobel peace laureate, should return home with a stronger partnership 
with China, which he needs as an ally of sorts to carry out his 
agenda of 'change' that the troubled world is awaiting with fervent 
expectations."
