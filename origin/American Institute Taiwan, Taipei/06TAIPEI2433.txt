SUBJECT: Middle East Tension Impacts Financial Markets 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  The flare-up between Israel and Lebanon has 
impacted stock and foreign exchange (FX) markets in Taiwan.  Like 
other Asian economies, on July 17, Taiwan experienced significant 
capital outflow, stock price plunges, and currency depreciation. 
End summary. 
 
Currency Depreciation 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Increased tension in the Middle East has caused capital to 
flow out of Asian markets mainly to the United States.  The NT 
dollar (NTD) depreciated 0.59% to close July 17 at NTD32.86 per US 
dollar (USD).  The NTD's 0.59% depreciation was comparable to the 
drop of 0.78% for the New Zealand Dollar, 0.63% for the Singaporean 
Dollar, 0.69% for the Philippine Peso, and 1.01% for the Japanese 
Yen.  The NTD further depreciated to NTD32.96 per USD on the morning 
of July 18 but rose back to the NTD32.86:USD1.00 level in the 
afternoon trading session. 
 
Stock Market Plunges 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Taiwan's stock price index dropped 2.65% to close July 17 at 
6,257.8 points, a seven-month low. Stock prices also dropped 3.6% in 
India and 1.4-1.8% in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia.  Stock 
prices plunges have driven investment funds from stock markets to 
bond markets both in Taiwan and the United States.  Taiwan stock 
price index rose 0.4% to close July 18 at 6,285.31 points.  The 
crisis has caused foreign portfolio investors to sell NTD5.67 
billion (USD174 million) more stocks than they sold on July 17, and 
their net stock sales increased to NTD6.82 billion (USD210 million) 
on July 18. 
 
FX Official Expresses Concern 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The fighting between Israel and Lebanon concerns George 
Chou, Director General of Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) 
Foreign Exchange Department.  Chou was particularly concerned that 
Israel and Lebanon ignored the G8's joint statement on July 17 
(Taipei time) to request for a cease fire.  Chou told AIT that stock 
and FX markets would worsen if Iran is drawn into direct 
participation in the Israel-Lebanon confrontation.
