     ¶B. B. TAIPEI 1462 
 
¶1. On January 29, Premier Su Tseng-chang appointed Ho 
Chih-Chin, 54, Chairman of the Economics Department at 
National Taiwan University as Finance Minister to replace 
Joseph Lyu (Jye-Cherng).  Lyu has only been in the position 
for five months (ref B) and is the first Ministerial change 
by Su since he took office January 25 this year.  Lyu will be 
reassigned as a Minister without Portfolio in the Executive 
Yuan. 
 
¶2.  Premier Su praised the work of Lyu in the areas of 
financial reform and public securities administration. 
However, news reports paint Lyu as an ineffective Finance 
Minister who avoided the press and accomplished little during 
his tenure.  Press reports highlighted recent scandals on his 
watch, including insider trading charges involving Taiwan 
Development Corporation and President Chen Shui-bian's 
son-in-law, and the recent battle over management control of 
state-owned Mega Holdings Financial Holding Company as 
contributing to Lyu's downfall. 
 
¶3.  Ho is an expert in taxation and assisted former finance 
minister Lin Chuan on tax reform policy, specializing in the 
reform of inheritance and gift tax.  According to news 
reports, Ho, a former U.S. citizen, worked for the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service as an economist from 1990-2003, 
specializing in tax reform.  Ho also served as senior 
economist at the U.S. Department of Justice from 1990-1998. 
He gave up his U.S. citizenship when he returned to Taiwan in 
2003 to teach at National Taiwan Univesity.  He earned a 
Bachelor's degree in Economics in 1974 from National Taiwan 
University (his classmate was Chen Shui-Bian) and a doctorate 
in economics in 1987 from the University of Michigan.
