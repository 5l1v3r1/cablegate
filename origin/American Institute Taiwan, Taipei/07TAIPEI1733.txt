SUBJECT: Taiwan Adopts Price Stabilization Measures 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  In response to recent price rises, Taiwan authorities 
have adopted a series of measures, including import duty cuts for 
grain, an export ban on waste paper, enhanced vigilance on price 
hike collusion, and new gasoline price subsidies (septel).  Although 
Taiwan's annualized inflation rate remains at 0.6%, authorities are 
concerned about potential inflationary increases, and are therefore 
trying to keep a lid on prices.  Economic forecasters and 
businesspeople comment that these measures will be unlikely to 
harness growing inflationary pressure.  Predictions for future 
inflation rate are a 13-year quarterly high of 3.8% in the last 
quarter of this year.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Six Measures 
------------ 
 
¶2.  After its weekly cabinet meeting on August 1, the Executive Yuan 
(EY) announced six price stabilization measures.  The Ministry of 
Economic Affairs (MOEA) will change the weekly gasoline price 
adjustment system to keep prices lower, in addition to the gasoline 
price subsidies for buses and taxis adopted in late July (septel). 
For the next six months, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will cut 
import duties for grain products in half. 
 
¶3.  The MOEA and the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) will conduct 
enhanced monitoring of price collusion.  Premier Chang Chun-hsiung 
suspects, for example, that price collusion may affect corn, whose 
price has recently increased by 4.7% in Taiwan, versus a 17.1% 
decline in international prices. 
 
¶4.  Concerned that higher prices offered by foreign buyers are 
driving up domestic prices, the MOEA will temporarily limit exports 
of such products as iron & steel, gasoline, diesel fuel, waste 
paper, and sand & gravel.  On a broader level, the MOEA also plan to 
launch an energy conservation campaign and promote renewable energy 
development. 
 
Monetary Instruments 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  Our contact of the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) (CBT) 
confirmed press reports that during the cabinet meeting, CEPD 
Chairperson Ho Mei-yueh proposed that the EY include the NT$ 
exchange rate and monetary instruments among the price stabilization 
measures.  CBT Governor Perng Fai-nan refused, however, and said the 
NT$ exchange rate should not be used as a price stabilization 
instrument.  According to Perng, the CBT has done its part in 
fighting inflation by raising benchmark interest rates every quarter 
over the past three years.  Perng also indicated that the CBT has 
stepped up its open market operations, thereby reducing money supply 
growth. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  These price stabilization measures are likely to be ineffective 
as the current inflation threat stems primarily from import cost 
hikes beyond Taiwan's control.  The Wheat Importers Association, for 
example, notes that the duty cuts are not enough to offset wheat 
import cost increases.  Local economic forecasters, therefore, still 
anticipate that the inflation rate will increase from below one 
percent in the first half of this year to over three percent in the 
second half, with the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research's 
forecast rate reaching a 13-year quarterly high of 3.8% in the last 
quarter of this year.
