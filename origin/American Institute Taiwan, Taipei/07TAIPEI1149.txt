EDGE OF A WEDGE 
 
REF: A. STATE 67444 
     ¶B. DAS CHRISTENSEN MAY 21 E-MAIL TO AIT DIRECTOR 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Taiwan MOFA International Organizations (IO) 
Director-General David Lin called in AIT Political Chief on 
May 22 to express Taiwan's dismay over the revised 
China-Taiwan resolution being circulated by World 
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) President Barry O'Neil. 
This resolution as revised would "seriously damage" Taiwan's 
rights and interests, Lin argued.  It would, moreover, 
represent unprecedented politicization of OIE, with Beijing 
using the OIE as a tool to settle its cross-Strait dispute 
with Taiwan.  Not even UN Resolution 2758, he said, had 
sought to force Taiwan under PRC sovereignty. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Lin argued the OIE resolution has important 
implications for the future, charging that the PRC is seeking 
to use the OIE as a wedge to downgrade Taiwan participation 
in other international organizations.  If the PRC is allowed 
to set a precedent in the OIE, a functional, working 
organization, he said, it will be difficult for Taiwan to 
stem the tide against PRC pressure in other organizations. 
Opposing PRC efforts in the OIE, thus, is a matter of 
principle for Taiwan, he said, and one on which Taiwan cannot 
affort to give ground. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Lin told AIT that if the resolution passes, Taiwan 
would make a strong public statement condemning and rejecting 
the resolution.  Taiwan would then consider taking subsequent 
unspecified "other actions." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Expressing appreciation for U.S. concern and 
assistance, Lin urged the U.S. to continue its efforts to 
modify or postpone the proposed resolution.  If the measure 
comes to vote in the OIE plenary session on May 25, he 
continued, Taiwan hopes the U.S. will publicly oppose the 
resolution and vote against it. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) AIT POL Chief promised to pass the information back 
to Washington and to our OIE delegation in Paris, but urged 
Taiwan to communicate directly with our team in Paris in this 
fast changing process. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) It is clear that MOFA/Taiwan is very concerned 
about the PRC's proposed resolution at the OIE and is seeking 
U.S. and other OIE member support to block it.  Less certain, 
however, is what "other actions" Taiwan might take in the 
event of passage.  We urge U.S. Del in Paris to share as much 
as possible our thinking on countering this unhelpful PRC 
initiative.
