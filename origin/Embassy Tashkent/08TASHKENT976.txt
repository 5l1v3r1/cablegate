¶1. (U)  Uzbek media has widely reported the visit by Brazil's 
Ambassador to Russia Carlos Antonio da Rocha Paranhos. 
Appointed on February 13 as Brazil's Ambassador Extraordinary 
and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Uzbekistan based in 
the Russian Federation, Paranhos was expected to deliver his 
credentials to President Karimov on August 20. 
 
¶2. (U) According to press reports, Paranhos met on August 19 
with representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
of Uzbekistan.  During this visit, he announced that a 
delegation of Brazilian businessmen led by Vice Minister of 
Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade Ivan Ramalho will 
visit Uzbekistan by the end of the year. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Trade turnover between Uzbekistan and Brazil 
amounted to USD 64.7 million in 2007, consisting of USD 2.1 
million in exports to Brazil and USD 62.6 million in imports 
from Brazil.  (COMMENT:  By comparison, in 2007 Uzbekistan 
exported USD 88.8 million to the U.S. and imported USD 164.5 
million from the U.S. End Comment)  At present Uzbekistan's 
primary imports from Brazil are sugar (91.5 percent), 
tobacco, and meat and poultry products, and its main exports 
are fertilizers and tourism services.   Ambassador Paranhos 
noted that Brazil could expand its exports to include 
aircraft, vehicles and spare parts, animal produce, and 
poultry.  Both sides believe that the current trade turnover 
could be greatly increased. 
 
¶4. (U) The Foreign Affairs Ministries of Uzbekistan and 
Brazil had their first consultations in Brasilia in September 
2007, after which Brazilian Special Advisor on Asian Affairs 
Markes Porto visited Uzbekistan twice, holding meetings in 
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investment and 
Trade (MFERIT) in addition to the MFA, and extending an 
invitation from Brazilian President Lula for President 
Karimov to visit Brazil.  (COMMENT:  The fact that this is 
mentioned in press accounts indicates it is likely President 
Karimov will accept the invitation.  End Comment)  MFERIT 
Minister Elyor Ganiev subsequently led an Uzbek delegation to 
Brazil in May 2008.
