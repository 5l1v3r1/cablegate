SUBJECT: UPDATE ON UZBEKISTAN'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO AFGHAN 
RECONSTRUCTION 
 
¶1.       (U)  Summary:  Following recent discussions on the 
subject, the MFA of Uzbekistan provided the Embassy with an update 
on their involvement in the socio-economic reconstruction of 
Afghanistan.  The contributions of the GOU have been primarily in 
the area of restoring and rebuilding infrastructure, including 
cooperation on the development of the International Trans-Afghan 
Transportation Corridor and facilitation of the shipment of goods 
through the Hairaton Customs Facility on the Uzbek-Afghan border. 
The export of electricity from Uzbekistan to Afghanistan has grown 
steadily over the last three years, with plans to continue 
increasing the volume of electricity supplied.  Finally, a fiber 
optic communications network connecting Afghanistan and Uzbekistan 
has been partially completed.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT: TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
----------------- 
 
¶2.       (U)  In 2003, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Iran signed a 
Trilateral Agreement on the creation of the International 
Trans-Afghan Transportation Corridor (ITTC).  The charter of the 
Interstate Coordination Council (ICC) on the creation of the ITTC 
was approved in 2005.  To date, Uzbekistan has built eleven bridges 
in the region between Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul. 
 
 
 
¶3.       (U)  Since the Hairaton Customs Facility in Termez, 
Uzbekistan, opened in November 2003, more than 6 million tons of 
humanitarian and other goods have entered Afghanistan through it. 
The GOU believes that it is providing a valuable service to the 
international community as a whole by facilitating transshipment of 
goods to Afghanistan. 
 
 
 
ENERGY 
 
----------- 
 
¶4.       (U)  Uzbekistan resumed its export of electricity to 
Afghanistan in 2002.  In the past few years, the volume of 
electricity that Uzbekistan has supplied to Afghanistan has 
increased steadily: exports were up from 20 Megawatts (MW) in 2007 
to 24 MW in 2008 and are estimated to reach 150 MW by the end of 
¶2009.  A new power line and a new electricity substation unit were 
put into operation in 2009 in order to increase Uzbekistan's 
capacity to send power to Kabul.  The GOU expects to export 300MW 
of energy to Afghanistan in 2010. 
 
 
 
COMMUNICATIONS 
 
--------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5.       (U)  The GOU and the IRoA began to cooperate in the area 
of fiber optic communications in 2008, with the goal of connecting 
Afghanistan to Uzbekistan's fiber-optic communication system. 
Cable installation for this project has already been completed 
within Uzbekistan; on the Afghan side of the border, nine out of a 
total of 32 planned communication hubs have already been installed. 
 
 
 
 
COMMENT 
 
---------------- 
 
¶6.       (SBU)  Comment:  Uzbekistan's important, albeit modest 
contributions to Afghan reconstruction and development are 
indicators of the caution with which the GOU's leadership 
approaches the Afghan situation generally.  Our challenge is to 
slowly push the envelope of this engagement and give the Uzbeks a 
greater stake in helping their Southern neighbor.
