(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel information on the designation 
of the Iranian Defense Industries Organization (DIO) under 
Executive Order 13382 to MFA U.S. Division Chief Ismat 
Fayzullaev on April 3.  Fayzullaev said that MFA would pass 
the information to the Central Bank and ensure that DIO is 
entered into the government's financial watch list.  He also 
said that the government would take action against Iranian 
entities if they are found engaging in proliferation 
activities.  However, Fayzullaev said that he doubted this 
was the case as Uzbekistan-Iran trade centers around 
foodstuffs and consumer goods rather than technologies useful 
in weapons of mass destruction programs.
