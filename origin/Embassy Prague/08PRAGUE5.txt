(SBU) Gabriela Dlouha and Hana Jelinkova, respectively of the 
Czech MFA offices for Human Rights and Transition Policy, and 
Middle East Affairs, told Embassy officials that there is an 
EU declaration on the matter of the formation of the Damascus 
Declaration National Council under preparation.  The GOCR 
will support this common EU position; it does not plan to 
make a separate declaration at this time.
