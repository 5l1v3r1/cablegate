¶1. (SBU) Summary. The Czech government has launched a medevac 
program to help critically injured women and children in 
Lebanon. This program is modeled on the successful Czech 
medevac programs for Iraq and Pakistan, and typifies the 
GOCR's modest yet extraordinarily active and adaptable 
disaster response mechanism and humanitarian assistance 
programs. The Czechs welcome U.S. assistance in identifying 
eligible patients. If necessary, the Czechs may seek allied 
assistance evacuating patients out of Lebanon. End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Poloff met with Czech Ministry of Interior officials 
on August 1 to discuss the Czech government's new Lebanese 
medevac program. The Head of the MOI's Unit for Policy, 
International Relations and Information on Countries of 
Origin Pavla Fridrichova said the program is similar to the 
Czechs' successful medevac programs for Iraq and Pakistan 
(Ref A). The program aims to provide emergency medical care 
to approximately 20-30 Lebanese people, preferably children 
or mother and child pairs. 
 
¶3. (U) According to Fridrichova, the program will bring 
patients to the Czech Republic to receive surgical or medical 
care, and provide material support to them and accompanying 
family members while they recuperate. To be eligible, the 
patient should: (1) be a child or a mother and child pair, 
(2) have a serious injury or medical condition that cannot be 
treated in Lebanon because of the current situation, and (3) 
be stable enough to survive transportation to the Czech 
Republic. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Fridrichova said the MOI is working with UNHCR and 
NGO Caritas in Lebanon to identify eligible patients, but has 
not identified any yet. Therefore, the Czechs would welcome 
U.S. assistance in identifying eligible patients. In 
addition, if necessary, the Czechs may seek allied assistance 
to evacuate patients safely out of Lebanon. 
 
¶5. (U) The medevac program has received $440,000 in Czech 
government funding (CSK 10 million), which the Czechs believe 
could be used to treat up to 30 cases.
