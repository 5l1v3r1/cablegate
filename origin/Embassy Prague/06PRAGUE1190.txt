¶1. (SBU) Poloff met on September 19 with Czech Ministry of 
Interior Director of the Department for Asylum and Migration 
Policies Tomas Haisman, and Head of the Unit for Policy, 
International Relations and Information on Countries of 
Origin Pavla Fridrichova, to continue the discussion on 
possible resettlement of Cuban political migrants in the 
Czech Republic. Haisman said the Czechs may accept up to ten 
migrants per year, although no formal decision has been made. 
If the Czechs accept migrants for resettlement, the selection 
criteria must also be determined. Haisman said his office 
prefers to select candidates based on humanitarian criteria, 
e.g., handicapped people. MFA officials have previously 
expressed interest in candidates who have been politically 
persecuted. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Czech MOI officials have logistical 
questions relating to the Cuban migrants. Therefore, post 
requests a point of contact to provide to the MOI. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment. Deputy Foreign Minister Tomas Pojar 
strongly supports accepting some of the migrants for 
resettlement. The next step is a meeting between Foreign 
Minister Sasha Vondra and Interior Minister Ivan Langer to 
make the final decision and hash out the details. We expect 
the meeting to take place in the coming week. End comment.
