SUBJECT: CZECH FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS IN AMBASSADOR ON 
SENATE VISA WAIVER LEGISLATION 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Czech FM Cyril Svoboda called in the Ambassador on 
the morning of May 19 to discuss the recently approved Senate 
amendment to immigration reform legislation that would extend 
the visa waiver program (VWP) to Poland, but not to the Czech 
Republic.  Svoboda, who faces re-election in two weeks, noted 
that the timing of the amendment was particularly difficult 
in that he had just returned from a visit to Washington, 
which included a meeting with Senator Lugar.  Lugar had told 
him on May 16 that the lobbying by senior officials from 
Central European capitals -- including the Poles -- would 
have "no influence" in the question of extending the VWP. 
Svoboda reminded the Ambassador that he had gone out of his 
way in recent weeks, including in his public statements after 
the meetings with Lugar and Secretary Rice, to praise the 
United States for the balanced and engaged approach the USG 
is taking to extend VWP, as demonstrated by the visa roadmap. 
 He asked the Ambassador for an explanation of what had 
happened. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador stressed that the amendment was the 
initiative of individual Senators, and certainly did not 
represent a change in USG policy.  He also noted that the 
fate of the amendment is uncertain, given that the full 
immigration bill still requires Senate approval and 
reconciliation with a competing House version.  He also noted 
the statements of several officials from the region, 
including the Czech Ambassador in Washington, that this 
amendment represents an opportunity for further discussion 
with U.S. lawmakers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) FM Svoboda expressed great frustration with the 
wording of the amendment, particularly that it did not 
address the full contribution of coalition allies to the 
GWOT, but only troop contributions to OIF and OEF.  Svoboda 
noted that the CR has over 300 troops in total on the ground 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, including those serving under NATO 
commands (Comment:  Post also notes that the USG is urging 
allies, including the Czechs, to move more of their forces to 
NATO command).  When analyzed on a per capita basis, the 
Czech Republic -- along with other nations, particularly the 
Baltics -- have a larger troop contribution to the GWOT than 
the Poles.  Further, the Czechs have contributed in many 
other ways, including substantial reconstruction and 
humanitarian assistance in Iraq and elsewhere. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Svoboda did not hide the fact that the Senate action 
comes at a very difficult moment.  Not only for him 
personally, given his visit to Washington this week, but for 
the entire government facing elections on June 2-3.  But 
beyond the electoral concerns, Svoboda stressed that Czech 
public opinion is likely to interpret the Senate vote as a 
sign that the Czech contribution to the GWOT is not valued in 
Washington.  Svoboda made clear that the Czech government 
(and he personally) would be active in putting forward a 
positive message and trying to correct misperceptions.  But 
he encouraged the Ambassador to do the same. 
 
¶5. (U) Post has received numerous press inquiries about the 
Senate vote.  There was significant press coverage on May 19, 
and more is expected over the weekend.  Radio coverage on 
morning of May 19 contained some inaccuracies about the 
status of the Senate bill.  Embassy issued a media advisory 
mid-day on May 19 stating that USG policy on VWP had not 
changed and that we remain committed to the visa roadmap 
process, and also clarifying the steps that still lay ahead 
for the immigration bill.
