¶1. (SBU) Czech MFA Cuba Desk Officer Jarmila Povejsilova told 
Poloff on September 12 that, contrary to previous 
indications, the Czechs have decided to have an observer 
attend the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Havana. The 
observer will be the new Charge d'Affaires of the Czech 
Mission in Havana Pavla Koppova, who arrived in Cuba in 
August. Koppova will attend the Summit to collect information 
only; she has no plans to meet with visiting NAM members or 
participate substantively in the Summit. Nevertheless, Poloff 
delivered edited versions of reftel talking points to 
Povejsilova on September 12 and 13, and asked her to forward 
them to Koppova.
