¶1. Summary. This is the third in a series of three cables 
summarizing significant Czech contributions in Iraq, the 
Balkans, and Afghanistan. The Czech Republic has provided 
substantial military support, development, and humanitarian 
assistance to Afghanistan. From the military perspective, the 
Czechs have spent $36.5 million on military contributions in 
Afghanistan since 2002, and have budgeted an additional $16 
million for 2007. The Czech government is considering leading 
a PRT in Logar Province beginning in 2008. The Czech Republic 
has also contributed over $15.5 million in development 
assistance since 2001. Czech development projects focus on 
education, transportation infrastructure, potable water, 
agriculture, de-mining, and preservation of cultural 
heritage. (For a summary of the Czech contributions to Iraq 
and the Balkans, see Refs A and B.) End summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2. Support for democracy and human rights is a core principle 
of Czech foreign policy, and an enduring legacy of the Czech 
Republic's forty-year struggle against communism. Since the 
Velvet Revolution in 1989, the Czech Republic has proven 
itself a reliable U.S. ally in these areas, as well as an 
important partner in NATO and GWOT, a like-minded ally in the 
United Nations, and a strong promoter within the EU of the 
transatlantic relationship. 
 
------------------------------- 
Military/Security Contributions 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Since 2002, the Czech Republic has spent $36.5 million in 
military funding to support international efforts to secure 
and stabilize Afghanistan by providing troops, experts, 
weapons, and medical assistance: 
 
-- In 2002, the Czech government sent a military field 
hospital to Afghanistan (the hospital treated 16,000 people 
during its mission). The hospital later served in Kuwait and 
Iraq in 2003 and 2004, and in Pakistan in 2005 as part of the 
NATO earthquake relief effort. 
 
-- In 2004 and 2006, the Czech government provided 120 
Special Operations troops to serve six-month tours under U.S. 
command. (The Czech MOD spent much of its $6 million 
Coalition Support Fund allocation on weapons and equipment 
for this mission.) 
 
-- Since 2004, the Czech Republic has actively participated 
in the NATO-led ISAF mission. (Note: the Czech government 
allows its forces to operate in Afghanistan without 
substantive restrictions.) 
 
¶4. Currently, approximately 250 Czech soldiers and experts 
serve in Afghanistan (likely to increase in 2008): 
 
-- The Czech Republic was the lead nation of the NATO ISAF 
command structure at Kabul's international airport from 
December 2006 through March 2007. Approximately 66 Czech 
personnel continue to provide air traffic control, 
meteorological, engineering, and de-mining services at the 
airport. The Czechs also contributed $240,000 to the ISAF 
Humanitarian Fund in 2006 and will contribute again in 2007. 
 
-- As part of a PRT near Feyzabad, 82 Czech soldiers protect 
international units and cooperate with Afghan reconstruction 
and development efforts. The Czech contingent has a budget of 
$200,000 for Quick Impact Projects. 
 
-- In March 2007, the Czech government sent a military field 
hospital to Kabul for 12 months. The hospital staff includes 
82 medical workers, 13 chemical warfare unit members, and 
three military police. The hospital will provide medical care 
to NATO troops and the local population. The cost of the 
mission is $7.1 million. 
 
-- In April 2007, the Czech government deployed 36 members of 
the Czech military police's Special Operations Group to work 
under the UK-led mission in Helman province. 
 
¶5. In a response to a NATO request, the Czech Republic 
recently agreed to donate 20,000 automatic rifles and 650 
machine guns (worth $1.4 million) to Afghanistan. The Czech 
government recently donated 12 military helicopters (six 
 
PRAGUE 00000683  002 OF 002 
 
 
Mi-24 combat and six Mi-27 transport), which are being 
refurbished by NATO at a Czech facility. The Czech military 
is also considering plans to deploy a small number of MI-171 
cargo and MI-35 gunship helicopters to Afghanistan in 2009, 
and may provide helicopter training personnel to assist the 
Afghanistan National Army. 
 
¶6. The Czech government hopes to create and lead a PRT in 
Logar Province, beginning in early 2008 (Ref C). The 
Czech-led PRT would consist of approximately 130 personnel. 
The government's decision is expected in July 2007. 
 
¶7. The Czech MOD has budgeted $16.2 million in 2007, which is 
a significant increase for Czech military efforts in 
Afghanistan. 
 
---------------------------- 
Reconstruction & Development 
---------------------------- 
 
¶8. Since 2003, Afghanistan has been one of the top recipients 
of Czech MFA development assistance. The goal of Czech 
development assistance is to improve access to education; 
develop transportation infrastructure, potable water 
supplies, and agriculture; and preserve Afghani cultural 
heritage (for example, providing funds for the rehabilitation 
of the National Museum). In 2006, the Czech government also 
provided funds for de-mining, reconstruction of destroyed 
buildings, and UN projects. 
 
¶9. In total, the Czech government has spent over $15.5 
million for development, reconstruction, and humanitarian 
assistance in Afghanistan since 2001. Approximately $870,000 
has been budgeted for such assistance in 2007.
