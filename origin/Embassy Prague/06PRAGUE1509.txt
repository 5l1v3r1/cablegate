¶1. (U) Czech MFA Head of the Near East Group in the Middle 
East and Africa Department Jaromir Marek told Poloff on 
December 1 that the Czechs fully support the government of 
Lebanese PM Faud Siniora, and continue to closely monitor the 
situation in Lebanon. In a separate meeting, Director of the 
MFA's CFSP Department Vaclav Balek told Poloff the Czech 
Parliament has approved up to ten Czech troops for UNIFIL. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A delegation of Lebanese Internal Forces (ISF) 
officials led by General Ashraf Rifi arrived in Prague on 
December 9 to meet with MOI officials. According to Marek, 
the purpose of the visit, still under way, is to visit the 
Czech Policy Academy to review police anti-riot training 
procedures. The General also expressed interest in reviewing 
security equipment--such as armored vehicles, shields, and 
police arms--with an eye towards possibly acquiring such 
equipment from the Czechs in the future. (Note: Balek assured 
Poloff separately that the Czechs would consult with the EU 
and UN before selling and/or donating any equipment to the 
ISF. End note.) Post will report the outcome of the Rifi 
visit when additional information becomes available.
