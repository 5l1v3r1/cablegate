ADMINISTRATION FOREIGN POLICY 
 
Luther King's Dream is a reality 
 
Main editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-21) notes 
that: "....Since yesterday, it is quite likely that white and black 
children [begin to] look at each other as never before in the 233 
paradoxical years of the American republic, where the incandescent 
light of freedom has coexisted with the endless night of slavery, 
discrimination and prejudice.  But also with opportunities without 
parallel in history or geography that transforms the existence of 
countless millions of Americans and foreigners, white and black, men 
and women." 
 
Economic Crisis imposes itself on Barack Obama's agenda 
 
Main editorial in business-oriented Valor Econtmico (1-21) states: 
"....There is no room for improvisation when facing the present 
economic debacle and Obama's team seems in part to be a repeat of 
Bill Clinton's administration.  Only a fool would not see the risks 
involved in working with a cabinet like this, but the new president, 
which will have a centralizing style, prefers to hear the best 
opinions and not have unanimity in making his decisions.  The 
obvious threat of this model is the dispute for power in broad 
daylight of his cabinet and the possibility that the strong 
personalities that advise the president superimpose themselves over 
the cabinet itself, amplifying disputes undermining the regular 
functioning of the government....With the right moves and the high 
degree of confidence in him, Obama may tame the crisis, even if it 
takes time."
