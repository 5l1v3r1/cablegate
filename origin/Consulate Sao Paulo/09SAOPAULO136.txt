A Quick Drop 
 
Editorial in liberal A Folha de S. Paulo (3-11) says: "....On the 
back of the global bonanza [seen between 2004 and 2008] the 
Brazilian economy more than doubled its expansive pace in comparison 
to the one seen in the two previous decades.  With expressive trade 
surpluses and a massive capital inflow, Brazil was able 
to.....increase its protection against international crises. 
Unfortunately, this line of prudence did not include government 
expenses.....If the public power had controlled its natural 
inclination to spend it then it would now have a less limited 
arsenal to fight the injurious effects of the global debacle." 
 
The Economy's Tumble 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-11) states: "The 
Brazilian economy suffered a tumble at the end of 2008, the largest 
in the last 12 years, and the shock is not gone yet.....This will be 
a bad year for the entire world.  Brazil will not be immune to 
difficulties, but, despite that, may have a better performance, if 
the government is able to take an anti-cyclical action.  So far, it 
[GOB] is listening to lobbies that have the best competences to 
obtain facilities and, in addition to this, planning actions that 
have an electoral effect, such as building homes for a symbolic 
price and with fiscal consequences yet to be estimated.  This is a 
way of burning money, not a way to stimulate the economy."
