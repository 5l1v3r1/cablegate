Uruguay's dissatisfaction 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (9/13) says: "In a 
document sent to congressmen last week, defending the accord with 
the United States, the Uruguayan government argued that...while the 
Mercosul skids, Uruguay needs to seek access to other markets in 
order to grow and to increase its exports. There are reasons for the 
complaint.... The two main partners of the bloc, Brazil and 
Argentina, ignore Uruguay's problems and create even more 
[difficulties].... If the acoord intended by [Tabar] Vazquez is a 
free-trade one...Uruguay's presence in the Mercosul as a full-member 
will be compromised.... Diplomats [from Brazil and Argentina]...say 
a restricted accord is acceptable.... The problem is convincing 
Washington to accept such an accord.... Another problem is the 
deadline to finish this accord.... The accord intended by Tabar 
Vazquez exposes the fragility of the Mercosul and the disdain with 
which the two main partners have been treating the others."
