Title- Shadows of the Past 
 
Editorial in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (2-6) says: "....The demand 
for more protectionist measures are beginning to reappear in all 
places - from the U.S. Senate to sectors of Brazilian society.  This 
idea is easily accepted stance but one that has proven itself to be 
inefficient.  Skirting its traps demands an urgent coordinated 
global effort.  Times of crisis, as one knows, are not appropriate 
time for national resentment and pickiness [concerning 
protectionism].  The situation is already sufficiently serious, for 
old shadows to reappear and complicate it even more." 
 
Title- Radicals defeated in Iraq 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (2-6) states: "In the 
upcoming days, when the official results of the vote conducted on 
Sunday in 14 of the 18 Iraq provinces are released, we will know for 
sure whether or not the optimistic analysis made were correct about 
the evolution of the political scene in the country.  Nevertheless, 
the convergence of the predictions points to a very different ending 
from the one suggested by preliminary data......Iraqis are very 
anxious to see the authority of the central government reestablished 
in order to have safety, jobs, electricity and water', wrote 
Independent commentator Patrick Cockburn, from London.  Lastly, the 
results of the vote - to be confirmed - [also] represent a defeat 
for Iran."
