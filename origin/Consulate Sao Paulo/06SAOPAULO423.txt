"Attack in Tel Aviv" 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4/19) editorialized: "Monday's suicide 
attack in Tel Aviv has just shown how unstable the situation in the 
region is. Apparently carried out by the terrorist group Islamic 
Jihad, the attack matches Hamas' interests.... There is no doubt 
that the Palestinian National Authority is running the risk of being 
economically asphyxiated. Even the Arab and Islamic nations' 
promised aid tends to never come through. In rhetoric, all Islamic 
nations support the Palestinian cause. In the real world, however, 
Arab governments fear more the Hamas and the Islamic integration it 
represents than Israel.... The clock is also running against the 
Palestinian terrorist group.... It is only a matter of time before 
the Hamas begins to suffer damage in the public opinion. It will 
then try to attribute its difficulties to the 'Zionist enemy' and 
the U.S., but such a discourse has limited efficiency. The best way 
out for the Hamas to break the isolationism it will fall into is to 
recognize Israel's right to existence and participate in some type 
of peace negotiation with the Jewish state."
