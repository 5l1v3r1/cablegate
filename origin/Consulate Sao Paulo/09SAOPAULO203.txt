Title- From Doha to Vila Euclid 
 
Main editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (4-2) states: 
"....In Doha....[President] Lula attributed the developed countries 
as being responsible for the economic crisis, for environmental 
degradation and international insecurity.....His speech was as 
useless as the one made in Brasilia, when he met British 
Prime-Minister, Gordon Brown, and the one made in Vina del Mar, 
Chile, at the progressive leaders meeting.....Lula had at least one 
moment of wisdom and seriousness  [in Doha].  And it was when he 
avoided being seated beside Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir, 
accused of genocide and supported by Chavez." 
 
Title- G20 and its limits 
 
Main editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-2) says: "....There 
are divergences in each one of the themes [to be discussed in the 
G20 Summit: 1. global action against the crisis; 2. Commitment not 
to implement restrictions to trade; 3.a new system of global 
regulation for banks; and 4. Strengthening of multilateral 
organizations]....Those conflicts and divergences might limit the 
reach of decisions being taken at the summit....Concretely, the 
event in London tends to attest to the role of the group, as a 
replacement to the G8, as the main forum of discussion for global 
economic themes.  Brazilians should not downplay the importance of 
this step." 
 
Title- The Group of 20 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-2) by Kenneth Maxwell notes: 
"The group of 20 (G20) meets today in London.  The goal is to face 
the world economic crisis and offer a collective answer to it....It 
will not be good if the only memory of the day is one of divided and 
insecure leaders protected by barricades against the furious 
population."
