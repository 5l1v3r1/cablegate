Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Sao Paulo Supreme Court justices are concerned about 
the possibility of growing ties between organized crime and 
terrorism in Brazil.  During a December 5-7 visit to Sao 
Paulo by Greg West, Assistant United States Attorney and 
Organized Crime and Terrorism Section Chief for the Northern 
District of New York, judges told us that they are having 
difficulty convincing the GOB that terrorism is a growing 
threat and that the federal government must prepare for 
Brazil's being used as a safe haven for terrorist activities. 
 Septel covers West's meetings on other judicial issues.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) Noting the Sao Paulo Supreme Court Criminal Section's 
concern that Brazil does not have adequate legislation on 
combating terrorism, Justice Luis Carlos Ribeiro dos Santos, 
President of the Criminal Section, said that the Sao Paulo 
Association of Judges sent a set of recommendations on 
anti-terrorism legislation to the Brazilian Congress in 2006 
(Note: Brazil does not have an anti-terrorism law.  End 
Note.)  Justice dos Santos further stated that the Criminal 
Section, which handles organized crime, has seen disturbing 
cases concerning the possible links between terrorism and 
criminal groups.  Judge Jose Amado de Faria Souza noted the 
difficulty in convincing the GOB that terrorism should be of 
concern, even within Brazil.  According to Souza, a "younger 
generation" of justices and public officials has close ties 
to many officers in the Brazilian armed forces who share 
their concern of a growing threat of terrorism to Brazil.  He 
said that the "older generation" of justices and politicians 
does not want to admit that organized crime exists nor that 
it has any ties to terrorism.  This group is more focused on 
issues such as public corruption and more traditional crimes 
such as theft and murder, Souza added. 
 
¶3.  (C) Justice Souza told West that in several cases he 
reviewed, surface-to-air missiles had crossed into Brazil 
through the Tri-Border Area (Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina) or 
from Colombia after criminal groups such as the Comando 
Vermelho in Rio de Janeiro purchased them for possible use 
against the police.  Fellow judges said that with the porous 
nature of Brazil's large frontiers and the fact that the GOB 
does little to provide manpower to monitor the borders, 
smuggling drugs and weapons into Brazil is not difficult. 
(Note: Justice Souza offered to pass information to us on 
cases we may find of interest.  Post is following up.  End 
Note.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Although we do not have independent verification of 
Justice Souza's account of heavy arms going to criminal 
organizations, we do know that criminal groups continue to 
seek and purchase more expensive and sophisticated weaponry 
to battle the police.  While this is not necessarily to be 
associated with international terrorism, the activities 
carried out by these groups are certainly violent, of a large 
scope, and present a serious threat to local governments. 
Justice Souza's assertion that surface-to-air missiles are 
among the list of heavy weapons being smuggled into Brazil is 
disconcerting and could potentially pose a much larger 
criminal and terrorist threat.  Post is working to verify 
this information and will report septel.  End Comment.
