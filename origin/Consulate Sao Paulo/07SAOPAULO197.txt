"The USTR Message" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo 
editorialized (3/14): "USTR Susan Schwab's meetings with 
representatives of Brazilian industrial and agribusiness sectors are 
the best reference for an evaluation of President Bush's visit to 
Brazil last week. Maybe President Lula's visit to Washington in 
early April will produce some more concrete results for bilateral 
trade and for the advancement of the Doha Round multilateral 
negotiations.... The results [of Schwab's meetings in Sao Paulo] 
were very poor in general.... The most disappointing for those who 
had some expectation about the visit was her message about the U.S. 
barriers on Brazilian ethanol.... Not only does the USG intend to 
postpone the complete opening of its ethanol market to more 
competitive producers, it plans to maintain an important protection 
component - the special tariff - out of the Doha Round negotiable 
concessions. Given that attitude, it is very difficult to seriously 
consider a joint project to develop alternative fuels. Brazil's 
competitive strength in this area is internationally recognized and 
none of its major trade partners will concede anything to it, unless 
it is absolutely necessary. Only the GOB seems to believe in the 
idea of an international cooperation in the sector when the nature 
of the dispute is different.... Only Brazil is willing to yield 
technology for free to possible competitors.  Making even more 
obvious this detail may have been the most positive effect - or 
perhaps the only one - of President Bush's visit to Brazil."
