"Bitter Remembrance" 
 
Liberal, largest circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo editorialized 
(1/11): "In addition to being late, President George W. Bush's first 
visit to the Middle East is the crowning of his disastrous policy in 
that region.... US action strongly helped oil prices skyrocket and 
become a concern for the world's economy.  The US's initially fair 
response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, with the invasion of 
Afghanistan and combating Taliban terrorists, was followed by the 
unjustified war in Iraq, increasing threats against Iran and a 
series of negative actions.... Bush's visit to the Middle East helps 
remind how negative has been his influence on the region. Changing 
that scenario will be one of the main challenges of his successor in 
the White House."
