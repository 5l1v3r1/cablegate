"355 Days For Bush To Go Away" 
 
Columnist Elio Gaspari wrote in liberal, largest circulation daily 
Folha de S. Paulo (1/30): "Finished with  his last message to the 
Congress, George Bush will begin his trip back to Texas. There are 
still 355 days to go, but it will be a satisfaction to accompany 
every morning the exit of one of the worst presidents the US has 
ever had (maybe he has been the worst).  Messianic, unprepared and 
liar, he transformed his personal inability into a world problem. 
Bush said farewell in a resentful and sectarian speech, attacking a 
Congress where the people's will placed him in the minority. He used 
words of effect in phrases without content."
