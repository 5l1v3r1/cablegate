"Adventures in Teheran" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (2-14) states: ".....at the 
same time it is reasonable to doubt the efficiency of sanctions 
supported by the U.S., it is important to end [Brazil's] role as a 
defense lawyer of the authoritarian Iranian government.....In the 
scenario that is crystallizing, it would be prudent to suspend 
President Lula's trip to Iran, scheduled for May....It doesn't make 
sense for Brazil to rush into a comprehensive arrangement with a 
government that executes dissidents....And as if political 
circumstances weren't enough, the confrontation regarding the 
Islamic Republic's development of nuclear technology has been 
aggravating......Brazil's foreign policy, traditionally known for 
discretion, equidistance and firm steps, has been marked by erratic 
behavior and mischievous decisions, especially during President 
Lula's second term...."
