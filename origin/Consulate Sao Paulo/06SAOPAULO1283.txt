"Qaddafi's Farce" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
(12/21) editorialized: "Three years ago, Libyan dictator Muammar 
Qaddafi admitted the possession of weapons of mass destruction and 
promised to destroy them. He aimed to reinstate his nation, which 
had just emerged from a decade under a UN embargo, into the 
international community. Some saw in his attitude a sign that things 
were improving in Libya. Unfortunately, that was not the truth. The 
judicial farce performed in Libyan courts that condemned to death 
five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor is evidence that 
the nature of Qaddafi's regime remains the same. The accusation 
against the defendants is absurd.... The farce was scientifically 
refuted by three different reports conducted by respected 
international experts.... Qaddafi is using the already classic 
tactic of dictatorships of attributing to a 'foreign enemy' the 
responsibility for their own incompetence.... Blackmailer Muammar 
Qaddafi may have changed in appearance for his own convenience, but 
he continues to head one of the world's most odious regimes."
