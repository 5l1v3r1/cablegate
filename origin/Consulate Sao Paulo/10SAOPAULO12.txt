"The Hand offered to Hamas" 
 
Editorial in center right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-8) says: "...In 
President Lula's administration it is said that the diplomacy of 
the irresponsible voluntarism rules....Alienated from the damage it 
may impose on his country, [Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] 
says whatever comes to his mind ...in order to be heard by the 
international community..... [Amorim's comments on Brazil possibly 
opening a dialogue with Hamas] show [the GOB's] imprudence while 
trying to seem important [on the international scene]."
