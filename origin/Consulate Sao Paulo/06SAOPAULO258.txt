SUBJECT: BRAZIL: A COMBINATION OF INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION, LOW 
INFLATION, RECORD TRADE AND CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS RESCUED THE 
ECONOMY FROM STAGNATION IN 2005 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  Brazil's record trade surplus combined with currency 
appreciation that benefited imports and a substantial current 
account surplus were the main economic surprises of 2005.  Brazil is 
recovering from a production slowdown in the third quarter of 2005 
on the strength of year-end sales and companies replenishing 
inventories.  Unemployment dropped both in Sao Paulo and nationally, 
accompanied by a slight increase in real wages.  While the auto 
industry celebrated increased sales, companies are concerned that 
the strong Real and high interest rates may hinder their 
competitiveness; at the same time, they are excited about the 
success of flex-fuel engines.  A huge trade surplus and foreign 
direct investment inflows contributed to the current account 
surplus, while low inflation generated a climate of stability and 
confidence.  End Summary.

SAO PAULO INFLATION IN 2005 LOWEST SINCE 2000 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The Institute of Economic Research (FIPE) of the University of 
Sao Paulo reported consumer inflation in Sao Paulo at 4.53 percent 
in 2005, after repeating a 0.29 percent increase in December, the 
same as in November.  This was the lowest annual inflation rate 
since 2000 and well below the 6.56 percent rate of 2004.  Health 
care services, tuition fees, and transportation tariffs accounted 
for two-thirds of the consumer price index.  Consumer inflation 
measured by FIPE for the month of January 2006 was 0.50 percent. 
Over a 12-month period ending in January 2006, inflation was also 
4.53 percent.  Listed below is total inflation over the past three 
years as well as several significant Sao Paulo inflation factors for 
¶2005.

NATIONWIDE INFLATION FELL IN 2005 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The Brazilian National Statistical Agency (IBGE) reported that 
consumer prices nationwide, as measured by the National Broad 
Consumer Price Index (IPCA), fell to 0.36 percent in December from 
0.55 percent in November.  IBGE attributes this decrease to weak 
consumer demand, which left retailers with less room to increase 
prices.  Inflation slowed in 2005 for the fourth consecutive year 
and was within the GOB targeted inflation range established in 1999. 
 A substantial supply of agricultural products and the effects of 
the stronger Real were primarily responsible for reducing pressure 
on the index.  On the other hand, the index was negatively impacted 
by high international oil prices, bus fares, publicly administered 
(regulated) prices (e.g., electricity and telephone fees), and the 
wages of industrial workers.  Commenting on inflation, the Brazilian 
Minister of Planning, Paulo Bernardo, said inflation continues 
"absolutely under control" and that there is room for the Brazilian 
Central Bank (CB) to continue reducing interest rates.  [Background 
Note: The IPCA serves as the primary benchmark for the GOB's 
inflation-targeting goal.  It records the average of daily price 
variations in eleven major cities (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto 
Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Belem, Fortaleza, Salvador, 
Curitiba, Brasilia, and Goiania).  The IPCA statistical sample 
includes families with incomes between one and forty times the 
monthly minimum wage (i.e., up to approximately USD 3,880 in 
December 2005).  End Background Note]. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
SAO PAULO INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION CLIMBED IN 2005 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4.  The Sao Paulo Industrial Activity Index (INA), maintained by the 
Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries (FIESP), rose 1.8 percent 
in 2005 versus 9.2 percent in 2004.  FIESP reported that the INA 
rose in December compared to November.  Nevertheless, the Director 
of the Sao Paulo Industrial Center's Economic and Research 
Department, Boris Tabacof, said "2005 was not a slack year for Sao 
Paulo industry."  According to Tabacof, "the sector only failed to 
expand because of the negative effects of the exchange rate and 
extremely high interest rates."  He further noted that inflation has 
been under control and industrial prices were not responsible for 
causing undue pressure on the index.  Therefore, Tabacof believes 
there is no justification for keeping interest rates prohibitively 
high, and he linked high interest rates to the country's 
insignificant growth rate.  Despite a deceleration of industrial 
expansion, Tabacof feels that all factors that compose the indicator 
show positive results when compared to 2004.  For example, hours 
worked in production increased 7.6 percent, real sales jumped by 13 
percent, hours paid climbed 5.3 percent, and real salaries were up 
11.3 percent.  Among the explanations for the discrepancy in the 
numbers, Tabacof cited the decline of capacity utilization from 79.7 
percent in 2004 to 78.5 percent in 2005. 
 
¶5.  A private sector industry analyst in Sao Paulo said that some 
sectors of industry are experiencing an increase in orders as 
retailers restock.  The packaging industry (cans, boxes, labels, 
bottles, etc.) expects production to rise in the coming months as 
supermarkets replace depleted stocks of processed foods, cleaning 
supplies, and personal hygiene items.  He cautioned, however, that 
sales will pick up slowly because workers are saving money in case 
they become jobless (see figures regarding increased unemployment 
below).

--------------------------------------------- - 
NATIONWIDE INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT INCREASED IN 2005 
  --------------------------------------------- - 
 
  ¶6.  According to IBGE, Brazilian national industrial output grew a 
meager 0.6 percent in November.  Compared to November 2004, 
industrial output also rose 0.6 percent.  Cumulative output for 
January-November 2005 was up 3.1 percent from the same period a year 
earlier.  Output for the 12-month period in November was up 3.5 
percent but showed a declining trend compared to 4.1 percent 
expansion in the 12-month period to October 2004. 
 
¶7.  Industrial production increased in November in 15 of the 23 
activities surveyed compared to October 2004.  The best performances 
were registered by food products, up 2.2 percent; electrical 
machines and materials, up 5.3 percent; rubber and plastics, up 2.9 
percent; and toiletries and household cleaning products, up 6.1 
percent.  Negative performances were registered by chemical 
products, down 1.9 percent; electronic materials and communication 
equipment, down 4.1 percent; petroleum refining and alcohol fuel 
production, down 1.5 percent; and tobacco, down 9.1 percent. 
Capital goods production continued to recover, climbing a healthy 
2.2 percent from October's 4.2 percent decline.  In comparison to 
the previous month, November 2005's intermediary goods output was up 
0.2 percent and semi-durable and non-durable consumer goods rose 0.5 
percent for the second consecutive month.  A weak area was durable 
goods, where production fell 1.4 percent compared to October, 
suggesting that consumer credit growth has begun to slow down, after 
climbing 2.7 percent in October. 
 
¶8.  In the cumulative January-November period, total industrial 
output rose 3.1 percent compared to the same period of 2004, down 
slightly from an increase of 3.4 percent through October, compared 
with the same period a year earlier.  Seventeen activities showed 
production expansion:  Vehicle production, up 6.9 percent, 
maintained leadership in terms of impact on the general index. 
Other positive impacts were reported in the mining extraction 
industry, up 10.3 percent; electronic equipment and communications 
material, up 14.7 percent; and printing, up 11.1 percent.  On the 
other hand, ten activities posted negative performance, with basic 
metal products registering the sharpest decline at 2.4 percent. 
 
 
¶9.  Industrial production increased in November in 8 of the 14 
principal Brazilian regions compared to November of 2004. 
Pernambuco outperformed the national average, clocking 12.3 percent 
growth.  Other states with growth exceeding the national average 
include Rio de Janeiro, up 4 percent; Minas Gerais, up 3.8 percent; 
Espirito Santo, up 1.5 percent; Bahia, up 1.1 percent; and Para, up 
0.9 percent.  The states in which output increased below the 
national average were the northeast region, up 0.5 percent; Sao 
Paulo, up 0.3 percent.  Meanwhile, industrial production fell in 
Santa Catarina, down 2.2 percent; Amazonas, down 2.4 percent; Rio 
Grande do Sul, down 3.4 percent; Goias, down 3.7 percent; Ceara, 
down 6.2 percent; and Parana, down 10.4 percent. 
 
SAO PAULO 00000258  004 OF 008 
 
 
 
¶10.  According to IBGE data released in the second week of February 
2006, Brazilian industrial production rose 2.3 percent in December 
2005 compared to the previous month. This is the best December 
result since 1991, and it signals that the manufacturing sector is 
recovering from a year-long slowdown.  Sectors that performed 
exceptionally well were electronic materials and communications 
equipment, vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and machines and equipment. 
Also, December's output rose 3.2 percent compared to December 2004. 
Industrial output nationally climbed 3.1 percent in 2005.  The 
Institute for Industrial Development Studies (IEDI) has projected 
3.5 percent industrial expansion for 2006.  On the other hand, the 
Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) predicted a 4.1 
percent increase, while a study by Austin Ratings Consultancy in Sao 
Paulo has forecasted 4.7 percent industrial growth countrywide. 
These research institutes believe that greater expansion in demand 
for manufactured and semi-manufactured products and foods for the 
domestic and export markets will encourage industrial production. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
NATIONWIDE INDUSTRIAL SALES ROSE IN NOVEMBER 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  In November 2005, nationwide retail sales rose 0.26 percent in 
volume and 0.18 percent in nominal value compared to October, in the 
seasonally adjusted series.  In the series without adjustment, sales 
in volume increased 4.87 percent compared to November 2004 and were 
up 4.82 the first eleven months of 2005.  Sales in volume rose 5.53 
percent in 12 months to November.  In the same comparison, sales in 
nominal value climbed 8.78 percent compared to November 2004 and 
10.51 percent in the first eleven months of 2005.  Sales revenue 
rose 11.38 percent in the 12 months up to November.  Four of eight 
activities showed positive performance while the other half posted 
negative performance.  Activities that grew include household 
appliances, petroleum, and by-products.  Supermarket sales, food 
products, cigarettes and beverages, clothing, and footwear posted 
negative results.  In extended retail trade, vehicles, motorcycles, 
and parts grew 3.7 percent. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
SAO PAULO INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT INCREASED IN 2005 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶12.  A FIESP survey showed a 2.16 percent decline in Sao Paulo 
industrial employment in December for a loss of 45,818 jobs. 
Although the month of December always reflects a decline of 
industrial employment, this year's decline was higher than in the 
past four years.  Paulo Francini, the Director of FIESP's Economic 
and Research Department, noted that December's industrial job 
creation was disappointing and well below the department's 
projections of 65,000 new jobs.  Francini noted, "when the economy 
loses steam, everything else slows."  According to Francini, the 
2005 results show just how badly industrial production has been 
affected since the middle of 2005, due to "an overdose of an 
equivocal monetary policy."  In a FIESP survey of the 47 industrial 
associations, 26 fired workers, 12 hired workers and nine reported 
no net gain or loss.  The largest number of dismissals occurred in 
the fertilizers, footwear, and metal stamping industries.  Most of 
the added workers were in the marble and granite, beverages, and 
animal rations (feed) industries. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
COUNTRYWIDE INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT DOWN IN NOVEMBER 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶13.  According to IBGE data, nationwide industrial employment was 
down 0.6 percent in November over October.  Nationwide industrial 
employment also fell 0.9 percent versus November 2004.  Cumulative 
industrial employment was up 1.2 percent in the first eleven months 
 
SAO PAULO 00000258  005 OF 008 
 
 
of 2005 and 1.5 percent in 12 months to November.  Workers' wages 
fell 0.8 percent in November compared to October, but were up 2.2 
percent from November a year ago.  In the first eleven months of 
2005 wages climbed 3.7 percent and 4.4 percent in the 12 months to 
November. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
DECEMBER UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN GREATER SAO PAULO 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶14.  The total unemployment rate in the greater Sao Paulo area, 
calculated jointly by the Sao Paulo State Statistical Institute 
(SEADE) and the Labor Union-Funded Statistical and Research Center 
(DIEESE) fell to 15.8 percent in December from 16.4 percent in 
November.  The Sao Paulo metropolitan area had over 1,607,000 
workers looking for jobs in December compared to 1,648,000 workers 
in November.  The number of unemployed fell 41,000 in December, as 
163,000 new jobs created were more than sufficient to absorb 122,000 
workers who entered the labor market.  (Note:  The SEADE/DIEESE 
index includes underemployed and discouraged workers and is 
therefore higher than the open market rate measured by IBGE.  IBGE 
figures showed unemployment rate for greater Sao Paulo was 7.8 
percent in December falling from 9.7 percent in November and 9.6 
percent in October.  End Note).  The SEADE/DIEESE data showed that 
the unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo rate 
fell for the fourth consecutive month in December to 15.8 from 17.1 
percent in August. 
 
¶15.  Greater Sao Paulo's consumer population in December was 
estimated at 10,173,000, up slightly from 10,051,000 in November and 
10,008,000 in October.  Meanwhile, the number of persons employed in 
December was 8,566,000, up 1.9 percent from November.  Of those 
persons employed in December, 1.68 million were industrial workers; 
1.40 million worked in commerce/retail; 4.50 million were in the 
services sector; and 985,000 worked in other sectors including 
construction and household services. 
 
¶16.  The SEADE/DIEESE workforce statistics reflected the following 
performance by various sectors in December compared to November. 
 
Job Generation/Loss by Sector 
----------------------------- 
Industry       96 
Services       99 
Civil construction/household help   11 
Commerce Retail     30 
(Reported in thousands) 
Source: SEADE/DIEESE (Note: The SEADE/DIEESE survey results differ 
from FIESP's because SEADE/DIEESE limits its survey to the 
metropolitan area of Sao Paulo; is conducted among 3,600 assorted 
households, including self-employed and unregistered workers; and 
surveys different households each month.  FIESP's survey covers the 
state of Sao Paulo; is limited to a fixed number of large industrial 
firms, which are surveyed every month; and excludes self-employed 
and unregistered workers.  End Note.) 
 
--------------------- ------------------------------------ 
NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT: STABLE IN NOVEMBER, FELL IN DECEMBER 
--------------------- ------------------------------------ 
 
¶17.  According to a monthly survey carried out countrywide by IBGE 
in the six largest metropolitan regions (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, 
Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife), the overall 
unemployment rate for these regions in November continued stable 
(9.6 percent) for the fifth consecutive month, down one percent from 
November of 2004.  Average real income increased 0.4 percent 
compared to the previous month and 2.1 percent compared to November 
¶2004. 
 
¶18.  After remaining constant for six months, the unemployment rate 
 
SAO PAULO 00000258  006 OF 008 
 
 
in December in the same six metropolitan regions fell to its lowest 
level (8.3 percent) since March 2002 and, for the first time, the 
number of unemployed persons remained below 2 million.  The average 
real income of workers in December increased 1.8 percent compared to 
November and 5.8 percent versus December 2004.  Compared to 
November, unemployment fell in Sao Paulo from 9.7 percent to 7.8 
percent; Belo Horizonte from 8.2 percent to 7.0 percent; and in Rio 
de Janeiro from 7.7 percent to 6.8 percent.  The other regions were 
stable.  The size of the workforce in the six metropolitan regions 
was 20.2 million persons in December, the same number reported for 
November, but 2.4 percent higher than December 2004.  The average 
real income in December was up 1.8 percent compared to November and 
up 5.8 percent from December 2004. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
VEHICLE INDUSTRY BOASTS RECORD PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶19.  According to the Brazilian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association 
(ANFAVEA), the Brazilian vehicle industry set record high production 
and exports in 2005, for the second consecutive year.  Production of 
all vehicles in 2005 was up 10.7 percent to 2.45 million units 
compared to the previous year.  Similarly, sales of autos, buses, 
and trucks rose 8.6 percent to 1.71 million units and vehicle export 
earnings totaled USD 11.2 billion, up 33.5 percent.  This was an 
all-time high for vehicles exported in any one year.  ANFAVEA said 
that auto industry successes in 2005 were largely due to dramatic 
increases in export sales, rather than domestic sales, which 
remained below the all-time high of 1997. 
 
¶20.  Auto industry sources predict a 5 percent increase in 
production and a 7 percent increase in domestic sales for 2006.  At 
the same time, export sales in value are not expected to grow more 
than 3 percent.  ANFAVEA believes that 2006 will be a difficult year 
for the Brazilian vehicle industry due to the overvalued Brazilian 
currency, which has significantly reduced competitiveness in foreign 
markets.  In addition, the domestic market is hampered by the 
world's highest interest rates.  [Note: The Brazilian Central Bank's 
overnight lending rate (SELIC) was recently reduced from 17.25 to 
16.5 percent.  End Note.]  During a recent visit to Ford Motor 
Company, Ford's corporate director and president of ANFAVEA, Rogelio 
Golfarb, said that investments in Brazil over the last decade 
modernized auto plants to enable them to compete in foreign 
countries.  Investment allowed manufacturers to introduce new 
technology, increase competitiveness, and launch new vehicle models. 
 One retail sales representative cited the high cost of borrowing 
money, unbearably high taxes for car buyers, and high labor costs as 
barriers to increasing domestic sales. 
 
¶21.  Nonetheless, data released by ANFAVEA in January 2006 surprised 
everyone.  ANFAVEA said that never before had the auto sector 
produced and exported so much in January.  Domestic sales also 
showed growth.  Vehicle sales increased 20 percent in January 2006 
compared to the same month a year earlier led by VW and followed by 
GM, Fiat, and Ford.  Golfarb attributed it to recent projections for 
a stable scenario for the Brazilian economy (sustained low 
inflation) and declining risk for foreign investors in 2006. 
Nonetheless, some manufacturers including GM predicted that exports 
will reduce substantially this year to due the appreciation of the 
Brazilian currency and as a result of stiff competition from other 
vehicle-exporting countries.  In Brazil, the automotive industry 
accounts for nearly 11 percent of industrial GDP.  Brazilian 
automotive production and distribution support over 500,000 direct 
jobs and more than 760,000 indirect jobs. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
BRAZILIAN FLEX-FUEL ENGINES A GREAT SUCCESS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶22.  Flex-fuel vehicle engines were first manufactured and 
 
SAO PAULO 00000258  007 OF 008 
 
 
introduced into the Brazilian market in 2003.  In 2005, no less than 
10 new vehicle models were running with the use of this new 
technology.  Flex-fuel engines can be fueled by gasoline, by 
alcohol, or by any mixture of the two.  In December 2005, sales of 
such units set a new record.  ANFAVEA said December flex-fuel car 
sales totaled 183,600 units, up 16 percent from November.  Flex-fuel 
car sales are growing fast and accounted for 70 percent of total 
vehicle sales in December, compared to 29 percent in December 2004. 
In 2005, sales of new flex-fuel vehicles totaled more than one 
million units.  Among Brazil's 10 largest assemblers, GM, Ford, VW, 
Renault, Peugeot, and Fiat are the principal manufacturers of cars 
using flex-fuel technology. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
BRAZIL'S TRADE SURPLUS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS IN 2005 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶23.  In 2005, Brazil outperformed expectations by registering a 
trade surplus of USD 44.8 billion.  Projections at the beginning of 
the year estimated a surplus of not more than USD 28.5 bllion. 
Export sales in 2005 reached new highs toaling USD 118.3 billion, 
up 22.6 percent from th previous year.  Manufactured goods 
propelled ovrall exports with an increase of 23 percent compare to 
2004, followed by exports of primary and sem-manufactured products. 
 All three categories reistered historical highs.  A breakdown 
shows tha oil and by-products, transportation equipment and 
material, mineral metals, metal products, and eletronic equipment 
were the key export products reponsible for the 2005 export 
performance. 
 
¶24. On the other hand, imports totaled USD 73.5 billin in 2005, up 
17.1 percent.  All import categoris reported increases: capital 
goods rose 26.9 percent, consumer goods were up 23.7 percent, fuel 
and lubricants climbed 15.7 percent, and raw materials and 
intermediate goods posted 12.6 percent growth.  Import demand for 
raw materials, intermediate goods, and capital goods were the main 
items that increased total imports. 
 
¶25.  Preliminary data released by IBGE showed a trade surplus of USD 
2.8 billion in January 2006.  This result derived from exports worth 
USD 9.3 billion and imports of USD 6.4 billion.  According to the 
Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade, the January 2006 surplus is 
30 percent higher than in January of the previous year.  In the 12 
months to January 2006, total exports rose 22.4 percent, reaching 
USD 120 billion.  Over the same period, imports climbed 17 percent 
to USD 74.7 billion, resulting in a surplus of USD 45.4 billion. 
While the Brazilian currency remains overvalued, Brazil's trade 
balance sets new records each month.  The markets are projecting a

BRAZIL'S FDI HIGHER THAN EXPECTED IN 2005 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶26.  The Chief of the Brazilian Central Bank's Economic Studies 
Department (DEPEC), Altamir Lopes, reported net FDI closed December 
with inflows of USD 1.4 billion.  For 2005 as a whole, FDI inflows 
totaled USD 15.2 billion, down 16.4 percent versus inflows in 2004, 
but nonetheless higher than the USD 10-12 billion projected.  Brazil 
placed eleventh in global FDI rankings.  [Note: 2004 FDI figures 
were inflated by Belgian brewer Interbrew's acquisition of Brazilian 
brewery AMBEV for USD 4.9 billion.  This acquisition alone accounted 
for 27 percent of Brazil's 2004 FDI inflows of USD 17.7 billion. 
End Note.]  The Brazilian Central Bank kept to its December forecast 
of USD 16 billion FDI in 2006.  The U.S. was the principal origin of 
FDI in 2005 with a contribution of 21.5 percent followed by Holland, 
14.8 percent; Mexico, 7.7 percent; France, 6.7 percent; Canada, 6.6 
percent; Germany, 6.4 percent; Spain, 5.6 percent; Cayman Islands, 
5.0 percent; Australia, 4.0 percent; Japan, 3.6 percent; and others 
18.1 percent.  FDI inflow in 2005 was distributed in the following

BRAZIL POSTS CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS IN 2005 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶27.  According to data released by the Brazilian Central Bank, 
current account transactions registered a surplus of USD 570 million 
in December compared to compared to 1.7 billion in November.  In 
2005 as a whole, current accounts closed with a cumulative positive 
balance of USD 14.2 billion, the highest value ever registered and 
the third straight year of surpluses.  This was equivalent to 1.79 
percent of GDP, as compared to USD 11.7 billion and 1.94 percent of 
GDP in 2004.  The big contributor to the 2005 surplus was trade in 
goods.  While the Brazilian Central Bank has projected a USD 6.1 
billion current account surplus for 2006, the market consensus is 
that the surplus will reach USD 9 billion.
