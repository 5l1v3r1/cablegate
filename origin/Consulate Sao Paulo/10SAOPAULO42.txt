¶1. (U) SUMMARY: This cable highlights economic, energy and science 
and technology developments in the Sao Paulo Consular District for 
the period January 1-15, 2010, not covered by broader reporting. 
Significant developments during the period include: Carlyle Group's 
recent acquisition of majority stake at tour operator CVC, a 
temporary government-imposed reduction of ethanol blend in 
gasoline, and record 2009 sales announced by aircraft manufacturer 
Embraer. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
 
 
Carlyle Group Acquires Largest Brazilian Tour Operator 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 7, U.S. private equity company Carlyle Group 
announced it acquired controlling stake in Brazil's largest tour 
operating company CVC Turismo.  The purchase marks Carlyle's first 
buyout investment in Brazil and further expands its overseas 
operations.  According to press reports Carlyle paid approximately 
USD 250 million for a 63.6 percent stake in CVC. Local industry 
analysts have suggested that Carlyle Group's move was triggered by 
expected tourism growth in the run up to Brazil hosting the 2014 
World Cup and 2016 Olympics. 
 
 
 
 
 
Temporary Reduction of Ethanol Blend in Gasoline 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3. (U) The GoB announced on January 8, that it will reduce Brazil's 
mandated ethanol blend with gasoline from 25 to 20 percent for 
ninety days.  The action, which will take effect February 1, is in 
response to a drop in sugarcane yields following heavy rains in 
southeastern Brazil over the last three months.  The heavier than 
normal rainfall has resulted in an 8.3 percent decline in ethanol 
production for the 2009-10 harvest season to date to 5.86 billion 
gallons. The GoB's 90-day reduction of the blending mandate (until 
the beginning of the sugar cane harvest season) aims to temporarily 
increase the amount of ethanol available in the market and contain 
a recent increase in ethanol prices of 17 cents per gallon for 
transportation fuel consumers.  While the measure is expected to 
reduce pressure on ethanol prices, economic analysts expect 
increased demand for gasoline to still raise overall fuel prices as 
much as 2 percent for final consumers, but do not predict a rise in 
overall inflation forecasts for 2010. UNICA Director of 
Communications Adhemar Altieri told Econoffs that UNICA is 
comfortable with the temporary measure, but expects consumer demand 
for ethanol to serve as a more effective mechanism for bringing 
down ethanol demand than the temporary mandate reduction. UNICA 
expects the tightness in current ethanol supply to be resolved by 
late March. 
 
 
 
 
 
Embraer beats record in 2009 delivering 244 jets 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. (U) Embraer announced on January 15 that it had delivered 244 
total aircraft to customers in 2009, breaking its previous record 
of 204 in 2008. The company attributed much of its 2009 gain to 
increased sales in the executive aviation sector with its Phenom 
100 model, introduced commercially at the end of 2008.  The 
increased sales of executive jets allowed Embraer to balance its 
sales in both the commercial aviation and the executive aviation 
markets, delivering 122 commercial aircraft and 115 executive jets, 
and seven defense airplanes.
