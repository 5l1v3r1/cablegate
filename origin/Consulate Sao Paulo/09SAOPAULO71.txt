Title- Chavez, 10 
 
Op-ed in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (1-31) by Fabiano Maisonnave 
says: "Chiefs of federal departments [in Venezuela] are obliging 
their employees to donate a day's salary to [President Hugo 
Chavez's] campaign [for unlimited reelection].  In Brazil.... the 
order [to Brazilian diplomats and members of the government] is not 
to offend the ally, whose purchases represented 1/5 of Brazil's 
[trade] surplus in 2008.  The [Brazilian] opposition has criticized 
the GOB's closely with the authoritarian regime, especially its act 
of forcing [Venezuela's] entrance in Mercosur.  But 'tucanos' [, the 
opposition party,] also acknowledge that in the times of Chavez who 
has Lula's [favor] is king." 
 
Title- It is not a Tsunami, there are culprits 
 
Op-ed in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (2-1) by Clovis Rossi states: 
"....using the word tsunami to describe the economic 
crisis....carries the risk of making people understand that the 
crisis, as with a tsunami,  is a natural phenomenon for which nobody 
is to blame....It is not like this.  The crisis has culprits that 
should be anxiously searched, what is not happening...from my point 
of view, the crisis is a product of market deification as almighty, 
omniscient and therefore, infallible.... [The question is] whether 
the world has leaders brave enough to put a vigilant eye in the up 
to now omnipotent market and whether [these leaders] are competent 
enough so that this eye is not squinting or myopic." 
 
Title- Lost in the crisis 
 
Op-Ed in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (2-1) by former President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso says: "....yes, governments need to act. 
But looking to the future and helping productive investments, either 
private or public.  And not placing people in debt....to save what 
cannot be saved....it is good to say that the global wealth 
reduction gives everyone, including and especially governments, the 
chance to think about the future.  We either increase financial 
regulations globally (without suffocating the ability to innovate, 
the mother of development) and re-think the cultural model of the 
un-checked consumption and dilapidation of nature or tomorrow's 
retake can be even more damaging than the stage that is drying up 
now." 
 
Title- Obama, the great absentee 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (2-1) says:"The global 
crisis was discussed in the World Economic Forum, in Switzerland, 
without the participation of the main actor, the President of the 
United States....A coordinated action is still fundamental.  One of 
the most urgent challenges is the recovery of credit ....this is one 
of the various urgent themes on the list of cooperation between 
authorities.  In this case, as in [the case of] trade, the stance of 
the U.S. administration is vital."
