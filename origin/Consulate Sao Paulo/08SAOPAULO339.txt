Crucial Moment for Doha Round 
 
Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (6/30) says: " 
the most ambitious trade negotiations of all times, the Doha Round, 
may fail, in a few weeks, if the new plan of Director General of 
World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, does not work.  ...The goal 
is to have a basic agreement on the two most difficult topics: the 
reform of trade of agricultural products and the opening of markets 
for industrial goods. ... The objective is to finish the work during 
George Bush's administration.  ... If the Round is not concluded 
before the new U.S. president takes office, seven years of effort 
will be lost.   If Obama is elected, the difficulties to advance the 
discussions will be bigger because he (Obama) has assumed several 
clearly protectionist commitments.  Brazilian negotiators have shown 
optimism and consider now a good opportunity for an agreement.  They 
will have to put an effort not only to reach a final agreement with 
American and European negotiators, but they also will have to reach 
an agreement with the Argentine government.  According to Argentine 
diplomats, the conditions of industrial protection negotiated until 
now continue to be unacceptable for Mercosul.  The Brazilian 
diplomats should take this evaluation into consideration. 
Objectively, the conclusion of a reasonable agreement at the Doha 
Round is very important for Brazil.  The country has bilateral 
agreements with important partners, contrary to other emerging 
countries, and laid its bet on this agreement.
