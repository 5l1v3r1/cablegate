POINT OF VIEW 
 
"A Test for Brazil to join the U.N." 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (10-17) by columnist Clovis 
Rossi says: "President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will receive his 
Iranian colleague Mahmoud Ahmadinejad [in Brazil in November] as a 
member of the UN Security Council.  The sentence comes almost as if 
a distraction from one of the two U.S. diplomats that talked to 
Folha [on Friday]...under the condition of anonymity....What does 
this sentence mean?.....It means that U.S. diplomacy would like Lula 
to say to the Iranian President....that the Iranian nuclear program 
must have only peaceful ends and Iran must undergo international 
inspections....before saying that, the diplomat noted that Brazil's 
[temporary] seat for 2 years [at the Security Council] .....is a 
golden opportunity for the country to prove its condition as a 
global player.  Or interpreted freely, it will be a kind of a test 
for Brazil to show it is mature enough to take part at the Security 
Council as a permanent member..."
