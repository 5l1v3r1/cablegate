"Why Chvez Is A Danger" 
 
The lead editorial in influential center-right national circulation 
daily O Estado de S. Paulo (6/6) maintained: "Brazil is Venezuela's 
second most important trade partner, after the US, and President 
Lula takes into consideration Brazilian companies' interests in that 
nation to react with less emphasis than appropriate against Chvez's 
attacks, even when they directly affect Brazil, as was the case of 
the caudillo's charges against the Congress for its motion 
protesting RCTV shutdown.... Protests in Latin America against this 
recent move by Chvez towards the installation of a dictatorship are 
encouraging because they have shown the presence of antibodies 
fighting an authoritarian contagion in the region.... If it is 
really a fact that Latin Americans are faced with two models of 
promised transformation - personified by Lula and Chvez - the 
Venezuelan president's angry policies are providing Lula with 
another opportunity to reinforce his own image, both in the 
Hemisphere and globally, as a leftist leader capable of "doing more 
to change the world" - as London's The Guardian said - than Chvez, 
whose left wing leanings are a poor disguise for his so far 
successful program to transform Venezuela into a caudillo-type 
dictatorship."
