"Coup in Thailand" 
Leading national circulation daily liberal Folha de S. Paulo (9/21) 
editorialized: "The coup d'tat in Thailand is not a surprise.  For 
months there were rumors in Bangkok that the military might 
overthrow Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.... His 'mistake,' which 
seems to have irritated the military command and caused the crisis, 
was to try to increase his influence in the Armed Forces by 
promoting some young officials who were his friends.... The only 
good news about the coup is that there have not been casualties so 
far. It is deplorable that after 15 years, a period in which 
democracy seemed to be finally established in Thailand, the country 
is once again facing the problems of a coup d'tat. If Thaksin was 
really unworthy to occupy the post, he should be removed by 
elections or by the institutions, not by a general's ambition."
