Uribe's Adventure 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (7/02) says: "President of 
Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, is facing political-juridical difficulties 
although his popular prestige continues to be high.  It is exactly 
this mixture that worries. ... In an attempt to suppress the scandal 
[ex-Senator Yidis Medina vote buying scandal], the government 
launches the idea of convoking a referendum, which authorizes the 
repetition of the 2006 presidential contest.  This would be a way to 
recover legitimacy.  The logic of the proposal is precarious. 
Nobody questions Uribe's victory; what is contested is the legality 
of his candidacy.  It seems frightening to take such decision to the 
streets, especially in a context in which the Executive and 
Judiciary are in a dispute and the Legislative is going through an 
unprecedented credibility crisis.  The measure sounds even more 
dangerous when one has known for some time that Uribe is flirting 
with the idea of a third mandate."
