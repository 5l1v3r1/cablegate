"Iran And Nuclear Weapons" 
 
Sao Paulo State Secretary of Environment Jose Goldemberg maintained 
in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (6/20): "Iran is testing the 
limits imposed on its sovereignty by the Non Proliferation Treaty, 
and by doing that has created an enormous problem with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that can lead to the 
application of political and economic sanctions and also a military 
intervention by the UN Security Council or even a US unilateral 
action, as happened in Iraq.... For many years Iran tried to obtain 
clandestinely from Pakistan uranium enrichment technology, and 
ignored IAEA controls. By doing so, it increased suspicions that it 
really intended to develop nuclear weapons.... According to the NPT, 
however, the signatory nations have the 'inalienable right' to 
develop all nuclear technology - including that involving uranium 
enrichment - provided that the purpose is a peaceful one. The 
problem is that the US does not accept that Iran is carrying out 
uranium enrichment for peaceful purposes because of Tehran's 
clandestine activities in the past, which does not recommend that 
nation as a reliable partner."
