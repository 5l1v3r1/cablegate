SUBJECT: LAUNCH OF SAO PAULO MONTHLY HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOR SWEEP 
 
¶1. Summary: The following is the first in a new monthly series 
summarizing human rights and labor developments in the Sao Paulo 
Consular District (i.e. the states of Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa 
Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Mato Grosso do Sul) not covered in 
broader reporting. 
 
 
 
POLICE DETAIL ONGOING NEO-NAZISM 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) In an October event organized by the Sao Paulo Jewish 
community in cooperation with a local Masonic Lodge, the head 
detective of Sao Paulo's Intolerance and Racial Crimes unit, 
Margarette Barreto, and Detective Paulo Jardim of the Porto Alegre 
Civil Police said Brazilian police have detained approximately 300 
people for criminal activities related to skinhead/neo-Nazi 
activities in recent years.  Though still small, the detectives 
stated that skinhead and neo-Nazi/white supremacist movements have 
taken root in Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo states.  The 
extremist groups target Jews, members of the gay, lesbian, and 
transgender community, Afro-descendants and people from the rural 
northeast of Brazil (nordestinos), for harassment and violence. 
Barreto and Jardim said members are typically 16-30 year old males, 
have a strict code of allegiance and view Adolf Hitler as an 
inspiration.  In their literature, many southern Brazilian 
neo-Nazis actively promote the separation of states of Parana, 
Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul from the rest of Brazil.  They 
often use a map of those states as their emblem, along with 
swastikas and even the U.S. Confederate flag. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) The police officers' presentation also featured many 
pictures of weapons and reading material gathered from raids on 
skinhead/neo-Nazi residences.  The officers suggested that such 
materials or financing for them likely comes from abroad, but had 
no information on possible source countries.  Though these groups 
remain quite small, law enforcement officials said they are closely 
monitoring them to ensure they do not link up with organized 
criminal groups. 
 
 
 
INDIGENOUS VILLAGE UP IN FLAMES 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) Longstanding tensions between Guarani Kaiowa indigenous 
communities and property owners in Mato Grosso do Sul over land 
demarcation issues have boiled over since October with the burning 
of two villages by landowners.  The first incident, in the village 
of Laranjeira Nanderu occurred after Guarani settled illegally on 
private land they considered ancestral territory and were ordered 
to leave the area by judicial decree.  They left behind their 
wooden houses, belongings and animals.  According to reports by 
Missionary Indigenous Council (CIMI) the 130 Guarani left within 
the timeframe allotted by the decree and made an agreement with the 
Brazilian Federal Police to return for their possessions at a later 
date.  However, the landowners, who claim they were unaware of the 
informal agreement, burned 35 indigenous structures remaining on 
their property.  The incident was followed by an assault on the 
Guarani Kaoiwa village of Apyka????y in Dourados, where ten men 
attacked 15 families with gunfire and the burning of property.  The 
landowners allegedly ordered the assault to stop the circulation of 
Guarani on their land in search of water.  The Guarani lodged 
formal complaints with the federal Public Ministry (MPF), which are 
now under investigation. 
 
 
 
MATO GROSSO DO SUL FUNDS INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY PROJECTS 
 
 
 
¶5. (U) Mato Grosso do Sul state has announced it will make USD 
 
176,000 available for projects in indigenous communities in 29 
municipalities in 2010.  The projects, expected to benefit 
approximately 70,000 indigenous people, will focus on poverty and 
inequality reduction through the promotion of equal opportunity and 
respect for racial and cultural diversity.  The money is available 
to NGOS, organizations and communities.  Priority will be given to 
projects that focus on marginalized families that already 
participate in other social assistance programs like Bolsa Familia 
and the Continued Benefits Program (Beneficio de Prestacao 
Continuada), a scheme that provides pension benefits for workers 
from the informal sector. 
 
 
 
POST SUPPORTS ANNUAL SAO PAULO TIP CONFERENCE 
 
 
 
¶6. (U) On November 25-27, the Sao Paulo State Anti-Trafficking 
Office held its annual conference.  The meeting brought together 
Brazilian NGOs, police, judges and prosecutors as well as 
international participants, including a French judge, a Swiss 
Federal Police officer and a Canadian immigration official.  The 
conference focused on the experiences of other countries with TIP 
legislation and the handling of victims.  Consulate Sao Paulo 
Public Affairs Section provided translation assistance and A/RSO 
Investigator gave a presentation on a recent joint Brazil-U.S. 
case, Operation Harem, which broke up a ring that had been 
trafficking women to the United States.
