"Having Bush As Counterpoint Helps Chvez" 
International commentator Newton Carlos opines in leading national 
circulation daily liberal Folha de S. Paulo (9/28): "Hugo Chvez 
wouldn't have any importance if he didn't have George W. Bush as 
counterpoint.... Washington's uncompromising hostility favored the 
emergence of an anti-Bush, a condition Chvez has assumed 
aggressively to the point of feeling himself free to engage in 
excesses, such as in his recent speech at the UN. The isolation of 
Chvez's, initiated by Condoleezza Rice, is currently trying to 
prevent Venezuela from obtaining a non-permanent seat in the 
Security Council.... Chvez also uses the fact that Venezuela is a 
victim of measures that are reminiscent of 'dirty wars,' such as its 
inclusion among nations that are watched by a special intelligence 
unit.  Thomas Friedman wrote that Bush is the most unpopular U.S. 
president in history.  It's the hook Chvez uses."
