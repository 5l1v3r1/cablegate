The Gaza Strip and the challenges of 21st Century war 
 
Article in business-oriented Valor Econtmico (1/9) says: "The 
fundamental complexity of this war is the State's involvement with a 
terrorist organization with military power.... The combat in Gaza 
shows the new reality of the challenges in international security in 
the 21st century: not the classic battle between nations on an open 
field, but rather the struggle between nations and terrorist 
organizations.... From a security point of view it is clear the 
State had to act to protect civilians just like any other sovereign 
State. However, from a political standpoint, Israel's political 
leadership...has the challenge of clearly indicating the success of 
the new security situation." 
 
No eyes in Gaza 
 
Article by former President Jose Sarney in liberal Folha de S.Paulo 
(1/9) states: "Israel has the right to watch over its borders that 
are threatened  by Hamas. But its reaction cannot be 
disproportionate so that it jeopardizes its image.... Egypt found 
peace, Israel solved most of  its problems as a State, but their 
martyrs, victims of radicalism, might have been sacrificed in vain. 
Today, [though we make believe that it is otherwise] the UN really 
has no eyes in Gaza." 
 
Eyes in Gaza 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (1/9) says: "Brazil cannot 
recuse itself. Neither can it overestimate its chances of 
intervening. There is no military solution to the conflict. Left to 
themselves, the adversaries will not find the way to peace..... It 
is not a matter of labeling the reaction as disproportionate. Does 
it accomplish any productive results? So many questions, so many 
deaths."
