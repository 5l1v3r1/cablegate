"Chavez takes one more step toward nationalizing the economy" 
 
Main editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (5-12) states: 
"...One of the indications that the oil business is not doing well 
[in Venezuela] was the nationalization of 60 contractor 
companies....As the crisis gets worse, Venezuela's 
President....increases his control over all sectors that are vital 
for the economy...Chavez is destroying democracy in his 
country....This way, the Bolivarian Socialism becomes each day more 
akin to the dictatorial regimes that destroyed the country - and it 
tends to have the same end."
