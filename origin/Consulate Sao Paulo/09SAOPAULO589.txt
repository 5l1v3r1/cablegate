"The only way out for Brazil" 
 
 Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (9-30) says: 
"....The only respectable way out for the Brazilian government from 
the trap it fell into seems to be granting [Manuel] Zelaya asylum in 
Brazil.  The problem will be to convince him to accept this 
solution." 
 
"Brazil's mess in Tegucigalpa" 
 
Op-ed in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (9-30) by Jose Neumane 
says: "We [Brazil] are making a stupid mess in someone else's 
territory that has no importance for us." 
 
"Brazil is against coups" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (9-30) by Elio Gaspari notes: "In 
all the cases [Paraguay in 1996, Evo Morales, Venezuela, Fernando 
Lugo], Brazil's actions sought to preserve governments elected by 
the people's will....President Lula should not feel bad about 
criticism of his action [in Honduras]. ....There are two cards on 
the table: Brazil can be an active element to dissuade coup makers 
or not to act.  Our guide [Lula] chose the right card."
