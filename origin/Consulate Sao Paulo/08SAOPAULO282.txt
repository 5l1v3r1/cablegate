Uribe Mimics Chavez 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo(6/6) says: "[Venezuelan 
President Hugo] Chavez had his project to perpetuate himself in 
power stopped at the ballot.... Now [Colombian President Alvaro] 
Uribe flirts with that idea.... He does not dismiss the possibility 
of altering the Constitution in order to allow him to run for a 
third term. One should acknowledge that ...his security policies are 
a success.... It is for no other reason Uribe is the most popular 
president in the Americas with an 84% approval rate. On the 
political front, however, his administration is vulnerable.... To 
make matters worse, the president is now accused of buying votes to 
approve the constitutional amendment which authorized his second 
term.... He said once that only a 'hecatomb' could make him seek 
reelection. The fear now is that he will arrange for one. "
