"Nuclear Supremacy" 
 
Political analyst Demetrio Magnoli wrote in liberal, largest 
national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (6/8): "Washington's 
double standard policy, which rewards India and threatens Iran, is 
morally shameful, but strategically consistent. The Bush 
administration's National Security Strategy report of 2002 defined 
the goal of an absolute nuclear hegemony.... Contrary to the 
scenario during the Cold War's end, when a US first nuclear attack 
would result in mutual destruction, today it would force a destroyed 
Russia's surrender. According to a popular myth, the modernization 
of the US nuclear arsenal is aimed at facing threats posed by 
secondary powers or terrorist groups. But investment priorities have 
indicated that the true targets are Russia and China.... The 
anti-missile shield currently being developed in the US can only be 
explained as a complementary element of a first attack against one 
of these powers. A CIA report has projected a scenario in which 
China's military power will overcome Russia's by 2020.... But 
China's nuclear deterrent force will not be significant. It is in 
that context that Washington's double standard policy is understood. 
According to the US strategy, India must sediment its condition of 
medium nuclear power to counterbalance China. India is a 
'responsible state' because it has just established a strategic 
partnership with the US, which sponsors its 'official' nuclear 
status and defines the limits of its nuclear program. Even a limited 
Iranian nuclear arsenal would represent an intolerable threat 
against the US presence in the Middle East and would cause a 
'nuclear race' in Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
