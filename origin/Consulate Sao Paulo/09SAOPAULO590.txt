SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: HONDURAS/OUSTED PRESIDENT ZELAYA 
 
"It is easier to believe in a dwarf" 
 
Op-ed in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (10-1) by sociologist 
Demetrio Magnoli says: "....Barack Obama's U.S. plans to leave 
behind its stigma of interventionism in Central America and, having 
condemned the coup, will not engage deeply in the defense of a Hugo 
Chavez ally.....[Regarding Brazil] It is more reasonable to believe 
in dwarfs than in the GOB's version that Zelaya showed up in the 
[Brazilian] embassy in Tegucigalpa without any warning.....Brazil, 
which intended to lead, lost the right to mediate by its own 
guilt.....At Brazil's Foreign Ministry it is amateur 
time......President Lula and Foreign Minister Celso Amorim depend on 
the success of the behind-the-scenes U.S. operations.  If it does 
not work, part of the responsibility for a tragic end that could 
have been avoided will be on Brazil's shoulders."
