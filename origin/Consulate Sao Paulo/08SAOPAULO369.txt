Global Stalling 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (7/11) says: "The G8 meeting 
in Japan brought infinitesimal advances to climate change 
negotiations.... The '50% by 2050' goal is physically unattainable 
without emerging countries.... Emerging countries want rich 
[nations] to cut somewhere between 25% and 40% of emissions.... The 
slowness of the process, however, is no excuse for postponing 
measures.... In Brazil, the 4th largest emitter, the obvious way is 
to stabilize the deforestation of the Amazon. At least two-thirds of 
our emissions come from this useless destruction, a contribution 
that President Lula failed to mention when addressing the issue in 
Hokkaido."
