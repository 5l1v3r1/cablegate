Title- Four Brics; One brick 
 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (7-28) by Clovis Rossi states: 
"It seems to be getting clearer and clearer that out of the four 
Brics (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the one that the U.S. 
really treats as a 'brick' is China (if brick can be synonymous with 
solidity)....Obama and Lula have already decided to reactivate 
ministerial level meetings between the two countries but the U.S. 
rush seems to be turned toward Asia.....Nonetheless, the climate 
change issue is global and Brazil and China.....have opposed the 
rich country proposals of setting targets on gas emission 
cuts.....It is important to see if China will consult its partners 
from the Brics on this issue or if it will prefer to hold a direct 
dialogue [with the U.S.]...."
