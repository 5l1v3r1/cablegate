"Embarrassment" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-27) by columnist Eliane 
Catanhede says: "....one of the divergences [between the U.S. and 
Brazil] is that Brazil has sided with France - meaning Lula has 
sided with Sarkozy - to take the lead [in a series of areas] 
including Copenhagen.... Hillary Clinton acknowledged [to Brazil's 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] that Brazil's proposal was an 
'inspiration' for other countries [including] the U.S.  The fact is 
that Lula likes to aim high, maybe too high.....audacity is a good 
thing, and voters even like it.  But when there is too much of it, 
it may scare [people].  That's what happened yesterday in [the 
summit of Amazon countries] Manaus: Chavez, Uribe, and the entire 
group ran away from Lula's fixation of being the leader of 
everything." 
 
 
 
"U.S. and China's Retreat Re-invigorates Climate Conference" 
 
Editorial in center-right Valor Econ????mico (11-27) notes: 
".....[The 
U.S. proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17%] is a small 
cut, almost meaningless for the world's second largest emitter..... 
But there are other important factors to take into consideration 
besides the targets.  The U.S. made a decisive step to enter the 
fight against global warming, from which it has stayed away for too 
long...."
