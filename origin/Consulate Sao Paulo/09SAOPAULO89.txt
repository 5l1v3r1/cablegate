protectionism; globalization: Sao Paulo 
 
Title- To avoid a setback 
 
Editorial in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (2-10) says: "One of the 
major threats related to the economic crisis has come to pass. 
Economic and commercial protectionism is expanding in many 
countries....more than ever, it is time to honor shared mechanisms 
to overcome the crisis.  That is the only way to stop the corrosive 
march towards protectionism, which brings with it nationalism and 
xenophobia.  The every man for himself [move] is a recipe for 
disaster." 
 
Title- A more representative G8 
 
Article in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (2-10) by Italy's ambassador 
Michele Valensise states: "Italy assumes the Presidency of the G8 in 
January of this year at a particularly critical phase in 
international relations, in which global institutions of 
'governance' have been strongly challenged by the financial 
crisis.....The Italian government is, therefore, being very careful 
on the format of the summit (that this year will take place from 
July 8 to July 10....), aiming to make it more efficient and 
representative, adapting it to new demands.... we are also 
organizing a meeting of labor ministers from G8 countries and other 
important economies (in Rome, from March 29 to 31)....For this 
meeting, for which [Brazil's Labor] Minister Carlos Lupi has been 
invited, we expect an important contribution from Brazil." 
 
Title- Foreign Trade and the crisis 
 
Op-Ed in center right O Estado de S. Paulo (2-10) by former 
Ambassador Rubens Barbosa says: "The global financial crisis and the 
recession in the developed economies of Europe and the U.S., in 
addition to the significant drop in China's and emerging countries' 
growth, led to a dramatic and rapid decrease in job's level and in 
global trade interchange.  Doha's failure and the dangerous increase 
of protectionist trends in developed countries, starting with U.S., 
will make the situation even more complex....The perspectives for 
Brazilian foreign trade for the next 2 years are tough, as evidenced 
by estimates of sensible reductions in exports in 2009.....Because 
Brazil did not deal with internal challenges earlier, now it has to 
face simultaneously three vulnerabilities....: structural ones...., 
operational ones....and exogenous ones."
