Title- More balance 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (8-3) states: "....Colombia's 
relation with its 'Bolivarian' neighbors Venezuela and Ecuador is 
once more going through a delicate moment.  The reason for the 
disagreement is the expansion of the U.S. military acting in 
Colombian territory......Brazil is right in expressing apprehension 
over what looks like a strategy by the superpower of increasing its 
military presence in the region.  It is not good for the Hemisphere 
that imbalances and propitious conditions for a military race are 
created. .....It is worth noting that the Venezuelan President 
closed military deals with Russia and offered installations for that 
country's [military] forces.  The Brazilian government said nothing 
about it.  Brazil is in a position to play a relevant role in the 
regional and international scenario.  But, without equilibrium, the 
risk is that it loses the confidence and the respect needed for this 
mission."
