REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE 
 
Chavez' Police State 
 
Center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (6/9) states: "Hugo Chavez has 
enacted a national security law which...if fully carried out...will 
turn Venezuela...into a nation of fearful snitches.... It 
establishes that...everyone and everything constitute a means of 
support to intelligence and counter-intelligence activities. Those 
who do not cooperate will be committing a crime.... The law is 
purposefully written in a vague manner to allow any working 
journalist to be sent to jail under accusation of spying or any 
other charge the authorities see fit.... It puts an end to due 
process of law.... The minister...in charge of running the political 
police said it was written to fight 
'U.S. interference.'... The enactment of this law is one more stage 
in the process of turning Venezuela into a totalitarian State. It is 
an outright violation of the OAS' Democratic Charter. Its adoption 
makes Venezuela irrecoverably incompatible with the principles of 
Mercosul as established in its Democracy Clause."
