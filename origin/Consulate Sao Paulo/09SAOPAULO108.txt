Title- Re-directing Expectations 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (2-18) by Haroldo Guimares 
Brasil says: "....we live in an economy of expectations since the 
institution of currency.  Protectionism is not the cause, but the 
consequence of the current economic condition.  To discuss and act 
against Obama's protectionist package is to shoot at the wrong 
 
place.  We should fight for government packages that have economic 
results and [that] re-direct expectations." 
 
Title- Argentines and Brazilians 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (2-18) states: 
"....experience and theory show....that keeping protectionism for an 
uncertain time ends with the general distribution of losses.....the 
solution, always delayed, is to find formulas to extend productive 
investments on the Argentinean side of the border."
