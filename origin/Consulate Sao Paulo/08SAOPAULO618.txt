Title- Today's Mercosul does not work 
 
Economic writer Rolf Kuntz comments in center-right O Estado de S. 
Paulo (11/20): "Suddenly, the major Doha Round negotiators sit at 
the table with a strong tendency to reach an agreement.  Naturally, 
some concessions from both sides will be missed, and none of them 
will be too heavy for Brazil...  At this moment, the favorable 
scenario to the conclusion of trade global negotiations is only a 
very optimistic hypothesis, but it cannot be considered a 
hallucination.... The problem would be less complicated if Mercosul 
were not, formally, a customs union, but only a free trade area. 
...If the pattern of behavior of the governments of the bloc is 
maintained, the four partners will continue to be impeded in signing 
major trade agreements.  All the integration of Mercosul up to now - 
and much more - would be possible in a free trade area.  It is time 
to seriously think about that."
