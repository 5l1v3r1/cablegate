Title- Honduras under pressure 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (7-22) states: "The 
Honduran interim governmental refusal to accept the proposal of the 
mediator, Oscar Arias, [in order to] end the crisis....creates an 
ominous situation for the small Central American country and 
threatens the stability of a region marked by a long history of 
political violence.....If the hardening [of the U.S. position] goes 
from words to actions, one cannot image how the authors of the coup 
will manage the transition to the next election.....The Honduran 
dependence on the U.S. is simply enormous...."
