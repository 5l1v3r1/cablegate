Chaos in Ecuador 
 
Article in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (4/30) says: "What goes 
on in Ecuador is cruely simple...the institutions do not work.... In 
early March the Supreme Electoral Court ousted 57 of the 100 
deputies who opposed the institution of a  referendum on the need of 
a new constitution....[Once] the election for a constitutional 
assembly was called the Constitutional Court reinstated 51 
lawmakers...Congress, then, cancelled that ruling... The 
[reinstated] congressmen were driven away from Congress by an angry 
mob...At least six fled to Colombia...another 18 will likely follow 
suit.... President Rafael Correa... said: "The government has 
nothing to do with the dispute between the Judicial and the 
Legislative branches". Of course it does. This is all part of Rafael 
Correa's political project which, although he denies it, but 
basically follows...the example of colonel Hugo Chavez."
