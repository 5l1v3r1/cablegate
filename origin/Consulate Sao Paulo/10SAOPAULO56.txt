The Rescue and Reconstruction 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-27) 
states:"...The problem [in Haiti] is not only money....but knowing 
what to do, who will do it and under which rules....One of the 
questions being asked at the moment is whether it makes sense to 
maintain the original mandate of the mission created in 2004 by the 
U.N. Security Council to fight political and criminal violence and 
assure free presidential elections in 2006.  Even after the 
catastrophe, Brazil's tendency is to involve MINUSTAH in social 
service and infrastructural programs......[It is] urgent...that 
Brazil and U.S. end the sniping....Brazil and the U.S. have 
competing ambitions: one aims for a new global role, the other has 
a President who needs to show the world he deserves the Nobel 
Prize."
