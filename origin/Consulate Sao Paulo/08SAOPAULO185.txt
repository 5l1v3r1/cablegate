Â¶1. "The Vice of Populism" 
 
Liberal and largest national circulation daily Folha de S.Paulo 
(4/10) says: "President Hugo Chavez, has been increasing expenses 
with all sorts of social programs for years in order to please his 
constituents... . This policy...translates into inflationary 
pressure. To counter that, Chavez...opted for controling prices... . 
Venezuela is suffering from a severe food shortage and accumulates a 
high rate of inflation, 7.1% for the first three months of the 
year... . The situation will probably get worse because Chavez' 
response to the growing difficulties has been the nationalization of 
production chains... . Chavez' popularity is falling... . Therefore 
it is likely he will intensify his economic magic, making the 
problems in Venezuela even worse." 
 
2."The disintegration of Bolivia" 
 
Main editorial on center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (04/10) states: " 
[Bolivia President] Evo Morales' institutional reforms-- that had 
created excitement among his constituents-- have been a disaster... 
. [He] conducted the final vote on the Constitution without the 
opposition...[and] tried to suffocate the autonomous movements. ... 
The social movements that helped elect [Morales] turned against him 
when the people started suffering with the consequences of his 
botched social and economic policies... . Faced with institutional 
chaos, the government cancelled a referendum to approve the 
Constitution... . The problem in La Paz nowadays is to figure out 
who speaks on behalf of the government... . Machinations and fights 
are bountiful as are the accusations of 'internal enemies'... . The 
coca leader and self-annointed redeemer of an oppressed Bolivia is 
leading his country's political disintegration."
