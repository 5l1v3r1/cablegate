SUBJECT: SAO PAULO LEADERS OUTLINE CONCERNS WITH GOB TO WHA A/S 
VALENZUELA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Thomas J. White, Consul General; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  On the final leg of his week-long visit to the 
Southern Cone, Western Hemisphere Affairs Assistant Secretary 
Arturo Valenzuela met with leading political and economic observers 
 
in Sao Paulo, who expressed concern with Brazil's foreign policy, 
public spending, and political maneuvering in the run-up to the 
October 2010 elections.  In a subsequent private meeting with A/S 
Valenzuela, Sao Paulo Governor and presidential front-runner Jose 
Serra warned that corruption and radicalization was growing in the 
ruling Worker's Party (PT) and suggested that as president he would 
push for a foreign policy more in tune with the United States. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
Sao Paulo Political and Economic Observers 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (C) Concluding his visit to the region with a stop-over in Sao 
Paulo on Saturday, December 18, A/S Valenzuela attended a lunch 
hosted by the Consul General with the ChargC) and nine leading 
political and economic experts including former Foreign Minister 
Celso Lafer, former Brazilian Ambassador to the United States 
Rubens Barbosa, and former Science and Technology Minister Jose 
Goldemberg.  A/S Valenzuela provided an overview of his trip and 
emphasized the high USG priority placed on the bilateral 
relationship.  He identified cooperation with Brazil on regional 
issues, including Honduras, as being of critical importance. 
 
 
 
¶3. (C) All of the Brazilian invitees criticized the Lula 
Administration's foreign policy, voiced concern over the increasing 
radicalization of the governing Worker's Party (PT), and stressed 
the deterioration of public accounts.  Former FM Lafer described 
Brazil's stance toward Iran as the "worst mistake" of Lula's 
foreign policy, while Ambassador Barbosa cited Brazil's role in 
Honduras as a prominent failure.  All agreed that the GOB is 
focusing on international issues (Iran, the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, Honduras, etc.) in which Brazil has few national 
interests and little influence, at the expense of ignoring issues 
closer to home, including relations with Mercosur. 
 
 
 
¶4. (C) Vice Chairman of the Brazilian Center for International 
Relations (CEBRI) Roberto Teixeira da Costa and Professor 
Goldemberg particularly questioned the GOB's interest in Iran, 
given a paucity of commercial prospects and unlikelihood of civil 
nuclear cooperation.  [NOTE: In an aside with ChargC), Goldemberg, 
who is also a renowned nuclear physicist, said Brazil has nothing 
to offer Iran on nuclear fuel issues as Iran is already well ahead 
of Brazil in centrifuge capacity.  Moreover, he said he fully 
appreciated Secretary Clinton's recent statement about countries 
working closely with Iran and that the GOB should take it 
seriously.  END NOTE.]  A/S Valenzuela emphasized that an 
increasingly isolated Iran is looking for any opportunities like 
the one offered by the Lula Administration to try to cover up its 
lack of cooperation and unpopularity with the international 
community. 
 
 
 
¶5. (C) Domestically, the Brazilian participants described the PT's 
strategy to make the upcoming national elections a referendum on 
the Lula administration as an improvement over the Cardoso 
administration and emphasized the party's intention to run an 
aggressive campaign.  Taking this tack, they argued, could portray 
Jose Serra as Cardoso's candidate and help transfer some of Lula's 
popularity to Dilma Rousseff, who has never run for public office 
before and has demonstrated little charisma as a candidate so far. 
Folha de Sao Paulo Ombudsman Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva 
highlighted the PT's unprecedented financial strength to run a 
campaign after eight years in government, while political scientist 
Bolivar Lamounier said an increasingly radicalized PT would likely 
run a very negative campaign against the opposition.  Lins da Silva 
 
added that, in the event the PT loses the 2010 presidential 
election, it could use its new wealth to serve as a very 
troublesome opposition. 
 
 
 
¶6. (C) Economically, Teixeira da Costa said that public perceptions 
about Brazil were overly optimistic and that markets could shift 
downward quickly if the international situation deteriorates 
further.  Ricardo Sennes, Director of international affairs' 
consulting firm Prospectiva, echoed the assessment, saying that GOB 
public accounts were under increasing strain and the Brazilian 
economy remained uncompetitive over the long-term due to weak 
infrastructure, high tax burdens, and rigid labor policies.  All 
agreed, however, that Brazil's strong economic performance over the 
last eight years and current recovery from the global crisis would 
help Dilma Rousseff's campaign. Regarding Brazil's recent 
high-profile involvement in the Copenhagen Climate Conference 
(COP-15), Professor Goldemberg said President Lula's performance 
was mediocre, and jockeying by the GOB left the perception that 
Brazil developed its position in the last two weeks.  Conversely, 
he praised Secretary Clinton's presentation and said that major 
country players should meet in small groups (vice the G-77) to 
foster progress on issues such funding and verification. 
 
 
 
SP Governor and Presidential Front-runner Jose Serra 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
- 
 
¶7. (C) In a 90-minute one-on-one meeting at the Governor's Palace, 
Jose Serra expressed a number of the same concerns in regards to 
Brazil's national political currents, rising corruption, public 
spending and foreign policy.  Serra told A/S Valenzuela that the 
ruling Workers Party (PT) is making every effort to build a 
long-term power base while in government.  Serra claimed Brazil is 
reaching previously unseen levels of corruption as the PT and its 
coalition allies use rising public expenditures to construct a 
political machine for the 2010 elections.  In the face of such 
efforts, and what he described as the comparatively weak apparatus 
of his own PSDB party, Serra was not firmly confident he could win 
the presidency in October 2010. 
 
 
 
¶8. (C) Beyond domestic politics, Serra criticized the Lula 
Administration's foreign policy and indicated that he would take 
Brazil in a more internationalist direction if elected president. 
Serra cited Honduras specifically as a Lula Administration failure, 
blaming the GOB stand and Honduran President Zelaya for impeding a 
resolution.  Conversely, he highlighted his engagement with the 
State of California on climate issues as an example of 
opportunities to work together on difficult issues.  However, 
reiterating his public position on biofuels, Serra criticized the 
U.S. tariff on imported Brazilian ethanol as economically 
illogical. 
 
 
 
¶9. (C) Referring to rising populism in the region, Serra said he 
found Argentine President Cristina Kirchner "cordial and smart" and 
suggested that if the USG has concerns about Kirchner's populist 
politics, that PT presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff should 
cause greater concern.  He also warned that USG references to a 
"special relationship" with President Lula do not resonate well 
with all segments of Brazil and could be manipulated by the PT. 
[COMMENT: Beyond Argentina, Serra appeared generally uninformed of 
recent developments in the Southern Cone, including Paraguayan 
President Lugo's political situation, and seemed primarily immersed 
in Brazilian domestic politics.  END COMMENT.]  Finally, Serra said 
he was working on several articles and op-eds that would publicly 
articulate his criticism of the Lula Administration's foreign 
policy in the coming months. 
 
 
¶10. (U) WHA A/S Valenzuela has cleared this cable.
