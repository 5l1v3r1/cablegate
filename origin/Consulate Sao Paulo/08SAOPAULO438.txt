The Scenario Changes 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (08/13) says: "...From the 
adventure undertook by Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and 
the disproportionate response of Moscow's generals, two things 
resulted: suffering and destruction...the result of the 
confrontation in the medium term is from another order.  The 
military answer from Moscow is a clear message addressed not only to 
the hostile spirits (threats) to the Kremlin in the region, but 
above all to American power. ...U.S. military power continues to 
have no rival.  But actions in the sense of making it valid in 
practice, against opponents of the Islamic world, did not correspond 
to the optimism of previous times. ... With Russian showing power 
again, with the vigor of several emerging economies, with the 
anti-American feeling demonstrated by major oil exporters, the 
strategy of the Bush administration of turning its back to the 
international negotiating institutions, seems, thus, to find its 
limit.  The scenario has changed: it is no longer on the horizon of 
the present U.S. government to respond to this new reality.
