Media Reaction - Global Economy: Financial market crisis; Sao Paulo 
February 2, 2009 
 
Title- Worsening Scenario 
 
Editorial in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (2-2) says: "The U.S. GDP 
dropped 3.8% in the last quarter of 2008.  Even if the decline was 
lower than expected; it is the largest since 1982 - which confirms 
the worsening of the crisis....The deterioration of the economic 
environment continues to impose new losses on international banks. 
With it, the risk aversion persists, which re-feeds a pernicious 
circle between the financial markets and economic activity.  In 
front of this scenario, the International Monetary Fund correctly 
suggests that an economic rebound will not be possible until 
financial markets have their functions restored and the credit 
market is unobstructed."
