¶1. "Bush Has No Trump Card" 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (10/13) editorialized: "By saying 
that the US does not intend to attack North Korea, George W. Bush 
was unusually and involuntarily transparent.... Bush is trying in 
 
vain to disguise the obvious fact that he does not have, either on 
the table, or up his sleeve, any serious option for the new 
international crisis created by Stalinist dictator Kim Jong-Il. But 
how could he have one if he has done everything wrong in regards to 
supposed or real threats made against the US following September 
11?.... The Iraqi adventure has been the mother of all Bush's 
disasters.... When Kim Jong-Il requests direct negotiations with the 
US - which obstinately refuse to agree with that - he just wants to 
do business. His apparent goal is to revive the agenda of agreements 
that was drafted and then abandoned by the Clinton administration, 
through which, in exchange for surveillance of the North Korean 
nuclear facilities, the US would supply energy and food to that 
nation of famine-wrought 23 million people.... What the US 
shortsightedness is now helping to destroy is what has been left of 
the NPT." 
¶2. "Apocalypse Soon" 
Political Scientist Luiz Alberto Moniz Bandeira remarked in liberal, 
largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (10/13): 
"Before condemning North Korea and Iran, as the US is doing, and 
forcing the Security Council to approve sanctions, it is necessary 
to exam the factors that led the two nations to reject the nuclear 
weapons non-proliferation policy.... In his State of the Union 
Address in January 2002, President George W. Bush accused Iraq, Iran 
and North Korea of being allied to terrorists, forming an 'axis of 
evil' and threatening peace in the world.... President Bush adopted 
a national security doctrine based on threatening preventive 
attacks... whose program consisted in increasing defense 
expenditures , strengthening democratic links and challenging 
regimes that are hostile to US interests and values.... In view of 
such circumstances, North Korea felt threatened and decided to 
develop its program to produce weapons so that it could have a 
dissuasion element against any possible US attack.... And Bush's 
decision to terminate the agreement reached by the Clinton 
administration revived tensions in the region, in addition to 
interrupting the peace process between the two Koreas.... How come 
President Bush now demands that North Korea and Iran respect UNSC 
resolutions?  He did not respect the SC and unilaterally determined 
the invasion in Iraq after saying that the UN would be 'irrelevant' 
if it did not agree with US purposes."
