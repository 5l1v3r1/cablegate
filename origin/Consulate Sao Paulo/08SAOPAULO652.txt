Title - Who is afraid of Hillary? 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (12-05) by former Brazilian 
President Jose Sarney says: "... to be a leader demands the 
capability to coordinate rather than impose his will.  These 
considerations are being taken into account as is reflected by 
Barack Obama's decision to constitute a "dream team" without being 
afraid of sharing responsibilities with major and experienced 
figures.  Obama shows that he has not only the charisma but the 
courage and the certainty of his structure without fear of leading 
leaders...  If anyone is afraid of the strong personality of Hillary 
Clinton, it doesn't seem to be Barack Obama."
