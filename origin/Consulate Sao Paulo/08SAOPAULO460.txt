SUBJECT: U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 
 
New Phase 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (08/29) says: "The U.S. 
presidential campaign will concentrate on states without a definite 
party choice, many of them affected by the economic crisis. ... The 
feat of the democratic candidate to the White House was marked by 
performances in which the Senator exercised his impressive charisma. 
.. The U.S. campaign will now enter a new routine.  In addition to 
mutual attacks...a competition of proposals directed to a mass of 
salaried voters in great part white and Latin will prevail.  Obama's 
platform in this question is the traditional democratic 
protectionism.  He defends new incentives and rules to diminish 
foreign competition and create more jobs in the U.S.  McCain is 
clearly liberal. He promises, for example, to revoke the surtax on 
ethanol imports and  reject the policy of subsidizing inefficient 
ethanol made from corn - which would be advantageous from the 
Brazilian agribusiness point of view."
