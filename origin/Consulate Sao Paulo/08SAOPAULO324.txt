SUBJECT: Mandatory SWT Report Shows 98.7 Percent Return Rate 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  Results of a mandatory end-of-season report from 
Brazilian Summer Work Travel (SWT) agencies show that 98.7 percent 
of participants had returned to Brazil or changed visa status 
legally in the U.S. by the end of the program.  1.2 percent of 
students overstayed their visa status, most by one or two weeks 
only.  In addition, agencies accepted applications from only 
two-thirds of all interested students.  End Summary.

Mandatory Report Holds Agencies Accountable 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Last year Congen Sao Paulo required SWT agencies who wished 
their students to apply for visas on the twelve days reserved for 
exchange students to provide us with an end-of-season report showing 
their students return rates.  In addition, agencies had to provide 
their internal approval rate, or how many applicants they accepted 
from all interested students.  They also had to determine how many 
students changed visa status after finishing their program. 
Brazil's SWT participation dates were November 15 to March 15. This 
report was due on April 30, as all students should have returned to 
Brazil by April 15. 
 
¶3. (U) Thirty-two agencies submitted reports, which included 
information on students who applied not only in Sao Paulo, but 
throughout Mission Brazil.  The reports show that the agencies 
approved 9,607 (66.3%) of the 14,489 students who applied.  Of 
these, posts approved 8,991 (93.5%) for visas.  NOTE: This number 
does not include all SWT applicants in Mission Brazil, as some 
agencies did not send applicants to Sao Paulo and did not have to 
file a report.  End note.

Majority of Students Maintained Legal Status 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The agencies reported on the status of 8,608 of the 8,991 
students approved for visas, a 95.7 percent reporting rate.  8069, 
or 93.7 percent, of these students returned to Brazil by April 15. 
432 students, or 5 percent, adjusted status in the U.S. following 
their program, most to B2 (tourist) or F1 (student) status.  An 
additional 107 students, or 1.2 percent, remained in the U.S. longer 
than their visa permitted.  Most of these students remained only one 
or two weeks longer than permitted. 
 
¶5. (U) COMMENT.  Congen Sao Paulo believes that this report is an 
effective way to increase agencies' accountability for their 
applicants.  Student Travel Bureau, the second largest exchange 
agency in Brazil, decided it will use this information and reject 
future applications from students who overstayed their previous J-1 
visa.  In addition, the low overstay rate shows that both the SWT 
agencies and Congen Sao Paulo are accurately screening participants 
in this program.  END COMMENT.
