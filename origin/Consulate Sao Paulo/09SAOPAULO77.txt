From Apocalypses and heroes 
 
Op-Ed in liberal A Folha de S. Paulo (2/4) by Clovis Rossi states: 
"This year has everything to become one in which we either avoid the 
apocalypse or end up finally diving into it....At the end of the 
year, there will be a conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, to decide 
how to fight climate change and how to avoid that global warming 
becomes the second 'big bad wolf' of the year [the first being the 
economic crisis]. It is true that some people still think that the 
climate' big bad wolf' is not as ugly as it seems. But it would be a 
tremendous irresponsibility to wait not doing anything and see if 
global warming wreaks havoc or not. Reducing gas emissions will 
benefit human beings, and that is obvious." 
 
Chavez does everything to perpetuate himself in power 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (2/4) says: 
"....Chavez's good times have past with the debacle of oil prices 
from US$147 in July to around US$40 nowadays....Chavism only 
survives thanks to the rising in public spending to support its 
social programs and to the nationalization of companies. With the 
tough hit in revenues caused by tumbling oil prices, the government 
will have to tighten its belt and cut expenses, which will erode its 
popularity....To Chavez, obtaining unlimited reelection is a 
decisive move. He demanded the voting to take place as soon as 
possible, while the burden of the international financial crisis 
still has not reached the entire country. Chavez will do everything 
he can to defeat it, by any means." 
 
President Obama and the paradox with Johnson 
 
Op-Ed in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (2/4) by Alexandre Barros, 
PhD., Political Science, University of Chicago, states: "[former 
President Lyndon Johnson] became famous for the disastrous 
escalation of the Vietnam War....The reasoning for the Iraq 
withdrawal is very similar to the one employed in Vietnam....There 
is a great chance that [President Barack] Obama and his close 
advisors will be forced to make bureaucratic concessions in foreign 
policy, just like Johnson was....Maybe Obama....will be forced to 
pay less attention to international issues if he wants to save his 
administration (and an eventual reelection) and will have to focus 
more on domestic issues, trying to escape from the Johnson 
paradox....Let us hope that Obama has good memory, reads good 
History books and shows a lot of stamina to implement the agenda for 
which he was elected."
