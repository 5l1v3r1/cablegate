"Icon Of Terror" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (6/10) 
editorialized: "The death of Jordan terrorist Abu Musab al Zarqawi 
is good news for George W. Bush, one of the few he could show in 
recent months in Iraq.  But, unfortunately, it is very unlikely that 
it will reduce the violence in that country.... Like Osama bin 
Laden, al Zarqawi is an icon of terrorism.  He planned and carried 
out some of the most savage actions in Iraq in recent years.  He is 
a symbol who seems to have inspired radical youngsters in several 
Islamic nations to engage in the 'holy war' against the U.S. by 
participating in suicide missions.... But also like bin Laden, al 
Zarqawi's role within Al Qaeda does not seem to be a central one. 
Each terrorist cell acts with a high level of autonomy, and his 
death is not expected to change the scenario substantially.  Ending 
the violence in Iraq will demand much more. Above all, it will be 
necessary to create a state that is realized as legitimate by the 
main ethnic groups in Iraq.  Al Zarqawi was successfully stimulating 
the violence between Sunnis and Shiites with the purpose of 
obstructing that exact goal."
