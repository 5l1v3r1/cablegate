"Islam and the Obama mission" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (6-7) by Clovis Rossi states: 
"President Obama's speech in Cairo seemed like the launching of a 
mission to change the collision of civilizations by their 
confluence. It is clear....that a speech although brilliant...does 
not change everything overnight. Now what is left... is to translate 
into practical actions the uncommon acknowledgment by an U.S. 
president that Palestinians suffer 'daily humiliations'...Or that 
there is a 'continuous humanitarian crisis in Gaza'. The whole world 
has a lot to gain if the confluence of civilizations is successful. 
" 
 
"The doubt after the Speech" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (6-6) notes: 
"President Obama's credibility and the new view that he wants the 
world to have about the U.S. in the Middle East will depend on the 
pressure that he will be, or not, able to put on an Israeli 
government that opposes to the end of land settlements in occupied 
territories and to a Palestinian State.....Because in what regards 
to words, there is not much more Obama can do." 
 
"Climate Change, a decision to be made now!" 
 
Op-Ed in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (6-7) by former President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, says: ".....Measures taken to hold the 
global warming are still timid, be it abroad or in 
Brazil....Brazil's contribution to the increase of greenhouse 
emissions derives mainly from burning forests down...this way, why 
Brazil does not take a more bold stance and accept to take part in 
the vigorous reduction of greenhouse emissions.....?The theme is one 
of political will....with a more radical approach from Brazil as 
regards to this issue, and if China and India were to follow us, we 
would have enough power for, along with Europe, force the U.S. to 
make larger commitments.....We should adopt an apparently radical, 
but redeemer, stance of a zero deforestation target....The time for 
decisions is now, in Copenhagen."
