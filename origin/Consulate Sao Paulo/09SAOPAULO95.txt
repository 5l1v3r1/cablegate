Title- Israel after elections 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (2-13) says: 
"....Whatever is [re: Israel's election] the result, the outcome of 
the ongoing negotiations [internal Israeli politics] will be 
discouraging for finding a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
The tough reality....is that the majority of Israelis are opposed to 
the creation of a Palestinian State ...the unanimous expectation 
among impartial observers...is that the new government....will 
continue the occupation and the expansion of colonies....There is 
only one question mark on this grim horizon: the Obama factor...." 
 
Title- Why the fear 
 
Op-Ed in liberal A Folha de S. Paulo (2-13) by former President Jose 
Sarney: "Almost 20 years ago....I said that the end of the communism 
was a result of its own mistakes.  And I emphasized 
that....capitalism had to innovate itself and resolve its mistakes 
and its internal contradictions, otherwise the same thing would 
happen to it.  And it is happening. Globalization is deconstructing 
itself, and protectionism is gaining strength again."
