¶1. "Provincial Machiavellis" 
 
International affairs analyst Demetrio Magnoli commented in liberal 
Folha de S. Paulo (5/18): "The good news is that Brazil was the 
nation that received more votes among those who will represent Latin 
America in the recently created UN Human Rights Council. The bad 
news explains that supposed achievement: the votes Brazil received 
were negotiated in a bazaar of mutual support with Saudi Arabia, 
China, Russia, Algeria and Cuba. These nations have been included in 
all impartial reports as cruel and massive violators of basic human 
rights.... The Lula administration's cowardly fraternal union with 
some of the worst political regimes in the world cannot be explained 
by the logic of ideology, but by profound conceptions of 
international relations.... The art of identifying the nature of 
issues at stake distinguishes statesmen. Our provincial Machiavellis 
have failed this test.  They lacked tough words in the crisis with 
Bolivia, but showed extreme contempt for principles in the election 
for the Human Rights Council.... The current Brazilian 
administration has betrayed the most valued national principles by 
offering the support of its vote to dictators and their machines of 
repression and torture.... The US, which did not run for the 
Council, is discreetly celebrating Brazil's vote. The Bush 
administration will have nothing to fear when Saudis, Chinese, 
Algerians, Cubans and Russians are called to opine on the network of 
torture centers of the 'war against terror.'" 
 
¶2. "The Wall" 
 
Economist Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr. opined in liberal Folha de S. 
Paulo (5/18): "Our American friends are masters of double standards. 
On the one side, they want the widest liberty possible for their 
corporations, through the FTAA or bilateral free trade 
agreements.... They want to establish an empire of free competition 
and free markets in Latin America. On the other hand, Washington 
refuses to apply the principle of freedom in sectors where the US 
economy has problems competing internationally (agriculture and 
several traditional industrial sectors). In addition, economic 
freedom is not applicable for Latin American workers. Their access 
to the US labor market will be subject to increasingly tough 
restrictions.... President George W. Bush addressed the nation this 
week on the problem of immigration control.... The USG will build 
hi-tech fences in urban corridors and new barriers in rural 
areas.... Radical sectors in the Congress, especially in the 
Republican Party, want to go even farther.... In a speech delivered 
on July 1987 near the Berlin Wall, then President Ronald Reagan made 
a dramatic appeal: 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall!' Latin 
American leaders would do well to gather in Nogales or in any other 
Mexican city near the US border to launch another appeal: 'Mr. Bush, 
tear down that wall!'" 
 
¶3. "New Haitian Government" 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo (5/18) editorialized: "Ren Prval was 
inaugurated Sunday as Haiti's president, and his task is nothing 
simple.  His main challenge is to stabilize the poorest nation in 
the Americas and consolidate its fragile institutions. To make 
things even more difficult, he will have to do so with practically 
no resources.... Prval has the support of the elections' 
legitimacy.... [But] if after a few months there is no perception of 
improvements, this major support will tend to vanish.... It is up to 
Brazil to help Prval in the task of restructuring the police. 
Brazil can also help the new government by transferring bio fuel 
technology.... Brazilian diplomacy can help Prval to demand from 
the rich world the promised, but not sent, financial assistance."
