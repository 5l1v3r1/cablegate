"Gordon Is Actually Is Doing A Favor For Bush" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo's 
Washington correspondent Sergio Davila wrote (8/8): "By requesting 
yesterday the release of the five foreigners from the US military 
prison in Guantanamo with permission for them to work in the UK, 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is actually making a favor to 
President George W. Bush. The Republican president's 'Gulag 
archipelago' has become an elephant in the current administration's 
living room, a judicial aberration criticized by every political 
segment. Its closure has already been suggested even by defense 
Secretary Robert Gates.... There are [in Guantanamo] about 370 
 
SIPDIS 
prisoners, whose situation is a kind of judicial limbo.... Fewer 
than 10 of them may have had major participation in terrorist 
groups. It is likely that the rest do not know and will never know 
what they have been charged with."
