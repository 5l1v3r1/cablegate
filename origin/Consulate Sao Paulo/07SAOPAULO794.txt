"Lula In New York" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo (9/26) 
editorialized: "President Lula da Silva met with President Bush in 
New York and heard a proposal for a reasonable reduction of 
agricultural subsidies in exchange for a greater Brazilian opening 
to industrial goods imports.... If Bush really wants to include 
Doha's final agreement in his political legacy, he will have to 
devote much effort to concluding the negotiations in a few months 
because American politicians will soon be focusing on the 2008 
elections. It is hard to say whether President Bush's political 
capital will be sufficient to obtain from the Congress the necessary 
concessions to conclude the round. Opening the UNGA, President Lula 
made a predictable defense of ethanol and biodiesel production as 
part of the solution to the world's environmental problems.... Lula 
correctly observed that if millions of people starve in several 
regions of the world today, this is not because of food shortage, 
but of lack of income to buy food. There is enough food in the most 
productive nations for both internal consumption and export.  The 
most efficient farmers could produce much more if there were markets 
for their crops.... The industrialized world continues to deal the 
cards in the environmental policy game, and such a policy is 
increasingly mixed with international trade questions. Pressures 
favoring protectionist actions on behalf of ecological and sanitary 
goals have been increasingly strong in Europe. In Washington there 
is a discussion of a new proposal to encourage the emerging nations 
to adopt environmental protection policies. The risk of enlarging a 
protectionism disguised as environmentalism is increasing."
