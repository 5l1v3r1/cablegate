Title- A Big Step 
 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (7-10) by former Brazilian 
President and current President of the Brazilian Senate Jose Sarney 
states: "The national [Brazilian] media did not realize the 
importance of the deal between Presidents Obama and Medvedev for 
humanity's history and survival....The U.S. President is trying 
to....redo what Bush destroyed......Obama proposed a new kind of 
relationship with Russia and with humbleness confessed that his 
country cannot handle alone the problems of humanity's 
survival.....Unfortunately, the deal does not foresee an end to 
studies on 'clear and pure fusion bombs'....but it is progress, we 
went from inertia to resuming the path of complete 
disarmament....The only way out is for a total intolerance of 
nuclear arms and to ban them from the Earth."
