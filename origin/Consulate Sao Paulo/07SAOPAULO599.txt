MEDIA REACTION: 
SUBJECT: PRESIDENT AND MRS. BUSH HOLD WHITE HOUSE 
CONFERENCE ON THE AMERICAS, JULY 9; SCO PAULO 
 
 
Â¶1. "Late and Modest Attention" 
 
Editorial on liberal Folha de S. Paulo (7/11) comments: "The 
re-discovery' of Latin America by the White House comes late, it is 
a reactive measure and does not promise glaring results. It comes 
late because George W. Bush already displays all the symptoms ...of 
a lame duck.... The sudden emphasis on Latin America comes after a 
series of polls showed the prestige of the U.S. in the region is 
low.... It is also a reaction to President Hugo Chavez' 
inflammatory, anti-Bush rethoric.... The fact is that Washington's 
aid to all Latin American countries remains insignificant. For 
fiscal year 2008, Bush proposed US$1.5 billion. Israel alone 
received US$ 2.62billion in 2004. In the same year, Iraq was granted 
US$18.4billion."
