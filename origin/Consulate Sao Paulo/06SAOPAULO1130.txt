¶1. Summary: Ambassador Sobel, accompanied by CG and poloff, met 
October 17 with Sao Paulo Mayor, Gilberto Kassab, and Municipal 
Secretary for International Relations, Helena Gasparian.  The 
 
SIPDIS 
participants discussed ways for the U.S. and the city to work 
together on issues of common interest, including trade promotion and 
public security.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The Ambassador stressed the importance of governments working 
closely with the private sector on social and economic issues.  He 
advised the Mayor of our interest in promoting trade between the U.S 
and Brazil and in forming partnerships.  He noted that a trade 
mission from New Jersey plans to visit Brazil in 2007, and urged the 
Mayor to think of specific areas for possible cooperation and to 
consider how the city could take advantage of this opportunity. 
 
¶3.  Mayor Kassab said the city faces many challenges.  He had just 
sent to the City Council for approval, a budget of about USD 10 
billion for a city of 11 million people.  According to Kassab, the 
budget was simply too tight for the city to be able to make the 
necessary investment in transportation, education, and public 
health.  In response to the Ambassador's comment, the Mayor also 
noted that the city has partnerships with NGOs and the private 
sector in the area of social assistance.  He cited a new program 
being implemented whereby private entities can provide health care 
to needy citizens and be reimbursed.  The Ambassador noted that he 
would be hosting a Corporate Social Responsibility roundtable on 
October 18, and suggested that perhaps at some point the Mayor could 
talk to some of the largest U.S. companies about priorities in 
supporting the city's efforts. 
 
¶4.  The Ambassador told the Mayor that he had recently met with Sao 
Paulo state Governor Claudio Lembo and Deputy Secretary for Public 
Security Marcelo de Oliveira (reftel) to discuss ways the U.S. might 
help the state address its problems with organized crime.  The 
Ambassador wanted to know if there was any way the USG might be able 
to help the city.  Kassab replied that responsibility for security 
belonged to the state, though in certain specific areas (e.g., 
security for public transportation) the city and state governments 
work together.  Noting Governor Lembo's concern about drugs, the 
Ambassador said DEA Administrator Tandy would visit Sao Paulo; he 
proposed arranging a meeting for her with city and state officials 
together.  Kassab welcomed this suggestion and indicated that such a 
meeting would be extremely useful for city officials involved in 
social issues, especially drug prevention. 
 
¶5.  In closing, the Mayor expressed appreciation for the 
Ambassador's interest in maintaining close relations with the city 
and said he looked forward to continuing the dialogue. 
 
¶6.  This cable was coordinated with Embassy Brasilia and cleared by 
Ambassador Sobel.
