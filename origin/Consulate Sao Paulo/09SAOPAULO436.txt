Title- In Obama's lap 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (7-23) by their columnist Eliane 
Catanhede says: "The threat of the elected President Manuel Zelaya 
returning to Honduras..... gives evidence....to the decisive 
influence of the U.S.....Obama, who tends to be much better than 
Bush for the entire world,.....recomposes the natural hegemony of 
the region's major power.  The Honduras' bomb is in Obama's lap." 
 
Title- Honduras is Chavez' Second Colombia 
 
Op-ed in center right O Estado de S.Paulo (7-23) by sociologist 
Demetrio Magnoli states: "Honduras.....has no economic 
importance.....but [it is imperative].....for Hugo Chavez' project 
to expand his 'Bolivarian Revolution'...... [which] as with every 
revolution, only has the alternative to expand or to stagnate and 
die.  Chavez cannot admit a second Colombia."
