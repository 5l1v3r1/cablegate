Title- "Waiting for the U.S." 
 
Main editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (3-16) states: "....the 
perception is consolidating itself that a bounce back in the U.S. 
economy, which is passing through a financial system restructuring, 
is crucial to restart global dynamism.  The many fiscal and monetary 
packages implemented by U.S. authorities have not been able yet to 
invert the pessimism around investors, companies and consumers.  Due 
to the huge weight of its economy and its currency dominance, the 
U.S. still is the one that can lead to a rebound in world growth." 
 
Title- "Isolated Dictatorship" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (3-16) says: "....The U.S. 
has each day less reasons to keep its restrictions against Havana, 
including the trade embargo, the most important in the dispute....On 
the other hand, Cuba's inclination to establish a dialogue with the 
White House is still uncertain....Whatever it is, the new direction 
of the White House, Fidel Castro's definite withdrawal and its 
uncertainty....as regards to the continuity of the financial support 
sponsored by Hugo Chavez these will probably lead to changes in the 
50-year-old Caribbean dictatorship." 
 
Title- "Crisis and Opportunity" 
 
Op-ed in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-16) by Professor Jose 
Goldemberg, states: "There is not an easy solution for the crisis 
and there are doubts whether the medicines adopted so far by 
governments from all over the world will produce results....The 
economic crisis will demand important reforms in the world economy 
and opens, therefore, opportunities to rebuild an economy with a 
more solid basis than the 'oil economy' or fossil fuel 
economy.....While the financial crisis is artificial, in the sense 
that it has been generated by speculators and irresponsible bankers, 
the energy crisis that the world is going through is real and will 
only be solved with new technologies...."
