Title - For Brazil, little change with Hillary 
 
Article in business-oriented Valor Economico (12-02) from Rio de 
Janeiro based Valor reporter, Francisco Goes: "The nomination of 
Hillary Clinton for Secretary of State was well received by 
Brazilian diplomats and by specialists in international relations. 
For a majority of them, however, the relationship of the US and 
Brazil will not change much.  Brazilian Chancellor Celso Amorim asks 
that Hillary work together to reinforce partnerships in the area of 
ethanol, Haiti, Africa and proposed a meeting in the beginning of 
Â¶2009. . . . He said that he is convinced that the two countries will 
be able to deepen their bilateral relationship, reinforce 
multilateralism and accelerate other partnerships. . . . According 
to Rubens Barbosa, former Brazilian Ambassador [USA, UK], the choice 
of Hillary Clinton will not represent significant changes for 
Brazil, because Latin America represents a low priority for the U.S. 
Department of State . . . the fire will continue to be in Iraq, the 
war, the Middle East, terrorism . . .  Luiz Felipe Lampreia, former 
Chancellor in the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government disagreed 
with Barbosa.  I do not share the pessimism of Barbosa . . . Brazil 
comes affirming itself as a country with its own personality 
separating itself from the image of Latin America . . . Brazil has 
everything to enter the new group that will succeed the G8."
