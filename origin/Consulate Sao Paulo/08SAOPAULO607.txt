After the Crisis 
 
Article in business-oriented Valor (11/10) states: "The purpose of 
this [G-20 summit] is clearly elitist: to save banks and financial 
institutions and, through them, save speculators-investors.  In a 
citizenship-based democracy this line of action will not be 
acceptable.  The minimum platform to be used must be the New Deal, a 
large rescue from the base, rebalancing the economy through public 
spending in infrastructure and public policies to reactivate demand, 
investment and jobs..... The new paradigm, therefore - be it in the 
economic or military realm-is that of cooperation among peoples and 
nations, putting an end to empires."
