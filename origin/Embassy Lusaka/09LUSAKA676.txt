(SBU) Poloff presented the reftel demarche to the Zambian 
Foreign Ministry on September 30.  Regrettably, most Foreign 
Ministry officials with competence on the issue are either in 
New York with the Zambian UN delegation or in Havana 
accompanying President Banda on his State visit to Cuba. 
Ikayi Mushinge, Principal Economist for Development 
Cooperation, expressed appreciation for these points and 
agreed to convey them to the Zambian delegation at the UN 
General Assembly.  If it has not yet done so, USUN may want 
to relay these points to Zambia's UN Perm Rep Lazarous 
Kapambwe or Assistant Director for International 
Organizations Winnie Chibesekunda.
