Mr. Barack Obama 
President-elect 
United States of America 
 
Dear President-Elect Obama: 
 
     On behalf of the people of Hong Kong, I extend my 
sincere congratulations to you on your election victory. 
 
     Your win heralds a new chapter in history - not just for 
the people of the United States, but for the relationship 
between your country and the rest of the world. 
 
     We are confident that, under your leadership, the United 
States will remain committed to the ideals of open trade, and 
will play a leading role to stabilise global financial 
markets during this time of turmoil. 
 
     I can assure you that Hong Kong, as a global financial 
centre, will work closely with the United States and other 
international partners to restore calm and confidence to the 
market. 
 
     I take this opportunity, also, to extend to you an open 
invitation to visit Hong Kong, which is home to one of the 
largest concentrations of American citizens and business 
interests in Asia, including more than 850 companies with 
regional offices or operations. 
 
     Hong Kong and the United States have long enjoyed a 
cordial and fruitful relationship and I look forward to 
strengthening that relationship during your Presidency. 
 
 
With my best wishes, 
 
Yours truly 
 
//signed// 
 
Donald Tsang 
Chief Executive
