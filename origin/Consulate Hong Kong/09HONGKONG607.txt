SUBJECT: MACAU: RESPONSE ON FORCED OR CHILD LABOR IN THE 
PRODUCTION OF GOODS 
 
REF: STATE 21472 
 
¶1. This message is Post's response to U.S. Department of 
Labor's (DOL) request for information about forced labor or 
child labor in the production of goods in the Macau Special 
Administrative Region (reftel). 
 
¶2. Macau does not have a record of forced labor or child 
labor in the production of goods. Illegal labor cases 
generally involve adult workers without proper documentation 
employed in construction or other service sectors. Exchanges 
with the host government, NGOs, academic contacts, and USG 
law enforcement agencies at Post have not yielded any 
indications of forced or child labor in the production of 
goods in Macau.
