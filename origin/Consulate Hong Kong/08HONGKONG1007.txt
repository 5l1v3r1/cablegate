MOS GROUP PTE LTD 
REF: A) USDOC 01387 B) D377049 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at MOS Group Pte Ltd., 
2 Boon Leat Terrace No. 05-03, Harbourside Bldg 2, Singapore (MOS). 
The item in question is a hafnium metal sputter target exported to 
MOS on or about August 16, 2007 and valued at USD 565.  The item is 
classified under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 1C231 
and is controlled for nuclear non-proliferation (NP) reasons.  The 
exporter was Bayville Chemical Supply Company of Deer Park, New 
York. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, MOS was 
registered in 2004 and its registered share capital is the Singapore 
dollar equivalent of approximately USD 30,000.  Its directors and 
shareholders are Singapore permanent residents Li, Wai Ping and Li, 
Tan Mua. 
 
¶4.  According to the company's web site, MOS's focus is 
manufacturing and refurbishing semiconductor equipment.  It has 
support centers in Asia and the United States.  The company states 
that is has over 20 years of process equipment experience and is in 
partnership with renowned semiconductor equipment manufacturers to 
offer equipment refurbishment and turn-key technology.  Key products 
include diffusion furnaces, rapid thermal process systems, plasma 
ashers and chemical cleaning systems.  It supplies several IC 
production lines in China.  MOS has offices in Singapore, mainland 
China, Hong Kong, the United States and service centers in Malaysia, 
Taiwan and Thailand. 
 
¶5.  On April 21, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs visited the company and met with Ms. Mavis Tai, 
Deputy General Manager.  Ms. Tai stated that the company is 
primarily a trading company specialized in semiconductor equipment. 
It is the authorized representative of some U.S. companies and 
supplies a range of semiconductor manufacturing companies including 
STAT, SMIC and UMC.  It also provides spare parts to various 
universities and research institutes in Singapore.  The Thailand and 
Malaysia offices are primarily involved in equipment sales. 
Bayview, the exporter, is an occasional supplier. 
 
¶6.  As to the particular item in question, Ms. Tai stated that this 
item had been procured on behalf of the Singapore Institute of 
Materials Research and Engineering, a Singapore government sponsored 
research institute (http://www.imre.a-star.edu.sg).  As to the 
end-use of the item, Ms. Tai provided an e-mail from Ms. Emily Chua 
of the institute stating that a Denton Sputtering Discovery 18 would 
be used to sputter the material on silicon wafers for materials 
research. Ms. Tai also provided ECO with documentation confirming 
delivery of the item to the Institute. 
 
¶7.  MOS is collocated with another company, namely Prima Research 
and Technologies Ptd. Ltd. (Primaco).  When asked about the company, 
Ms. Tai stated that the two companies share space and a common 
director but that Prima is involved in research and production 
related to alternative health care products sold in Asia.  She 
provided the web address of the company as www.primaco.com. A 
subsequent review of that web site reveals that this company is 
apparently involved in a very similar business as MOS and not in 
health care products production.  It boasts U.S. and other offices, 
some of which are collocated with other MOS offices.  Other offices 
are located at separate addresses.  ECO requested clarification on 
the nature of Primaco's business from Ms. Tai by subsequent e-mail. 
She responded that she would respond when returning from maternity 
leave. ECO will forward her response to OEA if/when it arrives. 
 
¶8.  While the information about the specific order in question and 
about MOS's business appeared credible, ECO is concerned that other 
exports apparently going to MOS customers may actually be destined 
for Primaco customers (or vice-versa).  ECO recommends a close 
review of past licensed and unlicensed shipments to these two 
companies.
