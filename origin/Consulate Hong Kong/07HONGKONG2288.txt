REF: A) USDOC 07672 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the 
USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), 
Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification at Sybase 
Hong Kong Ltd., Level 15, Core F, Cyberport 3, 100 
Cyberport Road, Hong Kong (Sybase).  The item in 
question is a restorer exported to Sybase on or 
about May 22, 2007 and valued at USD 66,520.  On 
the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), 
the export control classification number is not 
listed.  The exporter was Data Domain, Inc. of 
Santa Clara, California. 
 
¶3.  Sybase is a multinational corporation with 
offices throughout the world.  According to its 
web site (www.sybase.com), it is the largest 
global enterprise software company exclusively 
focused on managing and mobilizing information 
from the data center to the point of action. 
 
¶4.  On August 30, 2007, the ECO met with Mr. L.Y. 
Leung, System Administration Manager, at the 
address referenced above.  Mr. Leung stated that 
the Hong Kong offices of Sybase are primarily used 
for the sales and marketing, financing and 
accounting functions for the Asia Pacific region. 
 
¶5.  As to the specific item in question, Mr. Leung 
showed the item to the ECO in the company's secure 
IT room.  It is being used to back up Sybase Hong 
Kong's computer networks.  It was purchased to 
replace Sybase's prior tape based backup system. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Sybase appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the commodities shipped 
since Sybase cooperated with the PSV, operates a 
line of business consistent with its use, and 
showed the unit to the ECO.  The ECO recommends 
that this PSV be classified as Favorable.
