SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: 
EUROTECH INTERNATIONAL LTD. 
 
REF: A) STATE 079241 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Special Agent John McKenna 
and Export Control Officer, Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment verification (PSV) at 
Eurotech International Ltd. (Eurotech), Room 902B, 9/F 
Kinwick Centre, 32 Hollywood Road, Hong Kong.  This PSV 
concerned a KSR600M Inertia Spin Balance Instrument. 
The item is valued at USD 210,000 and the ECCN is 
listed as EAR99. The exporter is Space Electronics of 
Berlin, CT. (Space Electronics). 
 
¶3. Post met with great difficulty in attempting to 
contact Eurotech to set up an appointment.  The only 
contact phone numbers provided by the exporter listed 
telephone numbers that were all located within mainland 
China.  The purported representative of Eurotech in 
mainland China stated that it would be impossible to 
meet with a Eurotech representative in Hong Kong as 
there are no Eurotech personnel located in Hong Kong 
and there won't be any there for at least the next six 
months. 
 
¶4. Internet searches were also unable to locate any 
listing for Eurotech within Hong Kong.  Therefore, in 
an effort to complete this PSV and determine the 
reliability of Eurotech (Hong Kong) as a recipient of 
US origin goods, SA McKenna visited the address listed 
in the Shippers Export Declaration filed with the USG 
on the part of Space Electronics LLC, Berlin, CT for 
sale to Eurotech.  That visit occurred on August 21, 
¶2006. Located at this address, however, was a company 
doing business as Linfield International Limited. In 
addition, a review of the tenant directory revealed no 
listing for Eurotech.  Also, Eurotech does not appear 
on the listing of tenants located on the ninth floor of 
the building. 
 
¶5. It is clear to this reporting agent that Eurotech 
International Ltd. does not exist at the location 
identified above. 
 
¶6.  Note:  The bill of lading for this shipment lists 
the forwarding agent for this shipment as Eurasing 
Technology with a contact number in Beijing of 86-10- 
¶62162066.  That same phone number is listed as a 
contact for Space Electronics (the exporter) in China, 
under NA Far East Industrial Company.  Further research 
revealed that the contact number also corresponds to a 
company collocated at the same address as NA Far East 
Industrial Company, namely Eurasing Technology 
Development Corp. (www.oyx.cn and 
www.eurasing.com/oyx).  That company's web site makes 
reference to an additional corporate name, Eurasian New 
Technology Development Ltd. 
 
¶7. Given the information currently available to the ECO 
and SA McKenna, the ECO recommends that this PSV be 
categorized as unfavorable.
