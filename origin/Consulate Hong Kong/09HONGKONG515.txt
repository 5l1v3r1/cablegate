SUBJECT: HONG KONG BUSINESS AVIATION CENTRE PARTNERS WITH 
TSA 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) At a March 5 meeting, Hong Kong Business Aviation 
Centre (BAC) General Manager Madonna Fung told visiting U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for 
International Affairs, Cindy Farkus, that BAC would join the 
Secure Fixed Base Operator Program (SFBOP) on April 1, 2009. 
The SFBOP is a U.S. Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) public-private sector partnership program whereby fixed 
base operators (BAC in this case) physically check the 
identifications of passenger and crew against 
charter/business planes' Air Passenger Information System 
(APIS) filings.  Pilots or their designees currently must 
submit APIS information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) personnel in advance of flights to the U.S.  Under the 
SFBOP, BAC will notify TSA of its APIS verification checks 
within 60 minutes of aircraft departure and highlight any 
discrepancies.  BAC is the only fixed base operator 
supporting private/business aircraft in Hong Kong.
