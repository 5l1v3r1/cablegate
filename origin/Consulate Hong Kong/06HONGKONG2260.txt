REF: HONG KONG 2094 
 
¶1. Having just concluded its initial public offering (IPO), 
the Bank of China (BOC) began trading stock today in Hong 
Kong.  Shares rose 15.3 percent above the IPO price to HKD 
3.40 (USD 0.44).  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) fell 1.3 
percent for the day, continuing a decline that has pulled the 
index down nearly 10 percent since a recent May 8 peak and 
raised concerns -- now dispelled -- about whether conditions 
favored the success of the BOC IPO.  Some of the HSI's fall 
may reflect stockholders cashing out of constituent stocks in 
favor of BOC, which is not one of the shares that makes up 
the index. 
 
¶2. BOC's IPO raised USD 9.7 billion, making it the largest 
such offering in Hong Kong's history, the biggest IPO ever 
for a mainland company, and the highest grossing IPO in the 
world since the year 2000. 
 
¶3.  The high degree of enthusiasm for BOC going public was 
carefully cultivated with sales of strategic stakes to 
foreign investors and culminated with thousands of Hong 
Kongers lining up to get a piece of the action.  Last year, 
two of China's five largest banks, China Construction Bank 
and Bank of Communications, went public in Hong Kong, and 
another of China's large lenders, the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is expected to list here 
shortly, perhaps this fall.  The listing process has served 
as a catalyst for all of these banks to clean up balance 
sheets, upgrade internal controls, and modernize operations, 
all while helping Hong Kong rise to the position of the 
world's fourth-ranked capital raising center.  Reftel 
provides additional background and context regarding the BOC 
IPO.
