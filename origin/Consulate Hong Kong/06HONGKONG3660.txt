REF: A) USDOC 01597 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer 
(ECO) Philip Ankel conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) at Li Yin (Hong Kong) Technology 
Limited (Li Yin Hong Kong) on August 25, 2006. This 
PSV concerned gold plated nickel wire exported by 
California Fine Wire Company of Grover Beach, 
California (California Fine Wire) classified under 
ECCN 1C002 and valued at $3,438.  ECCN 1C002 is 
controlled for national security and anti-terrorism 
reasons. 
 
¶3. Li Yin Hong Kong does not have a separate business 
location in Hong Kong.  The phone number listed on the 
incoming cable (a number in China) was used to obtain 
a contact number in Hong Kong.  Contact with Li Yin's 
Hong Kong number produced a meeting with Vincent Chu, 
General Manager of Lucky Door Industries Ltd. (Lucky 
Door Hong Kong).  Mr. Chu's business card and the 
incoming cable list an office on the 12th floor of the 
applicable address.  The meeting was held on the third 
floor in office number nine. 
 
¶4.  Mr. Chu stated that Lucky Door Hong Kong is the 
Hong Kong sales and marketing location for a factory 
in mainland China that produces various carrying cases 
unrelated to the items that are the basis for the 
check (www.luckydoor.com.hk).  The meeting was held in 
the conference room of Lucky Door's Hong Kong 
operation, the walls of which were lined with cases 
like those referenced in the web site for Lucky Door 
listed above. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Chu stated that, in addition to distributing 
the production of the China Lucky Door factory, Lucky 
Door Hong Kong acts as a freight forwarder and Hong 
Kong presence for 20-30 mainland Chinese companies. 
In that capacity, Lucky Door Hong Kong receives and 
forwards shipments, pays the applicable import/export 
taxes and maintains the corporate registration of its 
customers.  Mr. Chu did not disclose the names of 
other companies for which Lucky Door Hong Kong 
provides such services.  Lucky Door Hong Kong has 
acted in this capacity for at least ten years on 
behalf of Li Yin Hong Kong. Mr. Chu noted that he 
processes 30-40 shipments per month destined for Li 
Yin in China and 45-60 shipments out of China through 
Hong Kong on Li Yin's behalf.  This shipment was the 
first received from California Fine Wire.  Mr. Chu 
demurred when asked about other U.S. suppliers for Li 
Yin. 
 
¶6.  Mr. Chu produced the most recent business 
registration documents of Li Yin Hong Kong.  It is 
registered at the address of Lucky Door Hong Kong (the 
third floor location) and has been in existence since 
¶1994.  According to its web site (www.dgliyin.com), 
the mainland Chinese company Li Yin Technology is 
located in Dongguan City and has 30,000 square meters 
of factory space.  It produces a range of products 
including HDD coils, DVD coils, DVD rick coils, hard 
disk drives, transformers and other products.  It 
claims several major customers including Sanyo, Sony & 
Dell. 
 
¶7.  As to the specific items that were the subject of 
the check, Mr. Chu provided documentation indicating 
that he had received the applicable shipment from 
FedEx and had subsequently sent it along to mainland 
China.  The ECO requests guidance on whether the 
applicable items are included on any of the applicable 
export control regime lists so that he may reach out 
to Hong Kong authorities regarding Hong Kong licensing 
requirements related to this shipment (if applicable). 
 
¶8. At the time visited, the consignee (Li Yin 
Technology (Hong Kong) Limited appeared to be an 
unsuitable recipient of the commodities shipped since 
it has no Hong Kong production facility and acts 
merely as the purchasing agent for a mainland Chinese 
company.  The items in question were not in Hong Kong 
 
 
at the time of the check and had already been 
transshipped to China. The ECO recommends that this 
PSV be classified as Unfavorable.
