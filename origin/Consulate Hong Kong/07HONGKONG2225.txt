1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted two post shipment verifications (PSVs) at Fintex 
Industries Pte Ltd., No. 24 Changi South St. 1, Singapore (Fintex). 
Three items were the subject of the checks.  The first two items 
(the subject of the first PSV) were two Rieve bench ovens exported 
on or about March 24, 2007 and valued at USD 19,036.  The third item 
(the subject of the second PSV) was a Solair 3100-C portable 
particle counter exported on or about April 12, 2007 and valued at 
USD 10,283.  The items were not classified for export control 
purposes when they were exported although the exporters indicated 
that these items could be exported NLR (no license required).  The 
exporter for the first two items was the Rieve Corporation of Round 
Lake, Illinois while the exporter for the third item was Lighthouse 
Worldwide Solutions of Medford Oregon. 
¶3.  According to the Singapore Companies Registry, Fintex has been 
in existence since 1991.  Its paid-up share capital is the Singapore 
equivalent of approximately USD 160,000. Singapore nationals Wong 
Bin Fatt (49 percent shareholder), Ms. Wong Hua Li (49% shareholder) 
and Quek King Seng and Wong Guek Ling are listed as directors.  More 
information is located at the company's web site 
(www.Fintex.com.sg). 
 
¶4.  On June 21, 2007, the ECO met with Mr. Alex Wong B.H., Managing 
Director of Fintex and Ms. Ivy Goh, Q.A. Engineer.  According to Mr. 
Wong, in 1995, Fintex became involved in the cleaning and recycling 
of components used in the semiconductor production process 
(including Disk carriers, Sputtering systems-shields, platters, 
shutters, chambers, planetaries etc.).  The particle counter is used 
in this aspect of the company's business to ensure that the 
components are free of dust particles and other trace 
particles/metals after they have been cleaned.  The ovens are 
likewise used in the cleaning and refurbishment of sputtering 
systems shields. 
 
¶5.  The ECO inspected the particle counters and the ovens and toured 
the Fintex premises.  The facility appeared consistent with the use 
of the items. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Fintex appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the commodities shipped since Fintex cooperated with these PSVs, 
provided the ECO with access to the items and operates a line of 
business consistent with the use of the items. The ECO recommends 
that these PSVs be classified as Favorable.
