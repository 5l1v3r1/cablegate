¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Dragon Well Transportation 
Ltd., Unit 2-3 G/F, Hope Sea Ind. Ctr., No. 22-24 Lam Hing Street, 
Hong Kong (Dragon Well). The item in question is an encircled flux 
measurement system exported to Dragon Well on or about July 23, 2008 
and valued at USD 7411.  On the applicable shippers export 
declaration (SED), these items are classified under export control 
classification number (ECCN) 3A001 and, if properly classified, 
would be controlled for national security (NS) reasons.  The 
exporter was Luminentoic of Chatsworth, California. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Dragon Well was 
registered in March 1998, and it has less than the Hong Kong 
equivalent of USD 1 in paid-in capital. Its directors are listed as 
Hai, Sheung Wing and Lo, Ha with Hong Kong identification numbers 
K799619(5) and P073706(6) respectively.  Ms. Lo, Ha is the director 
of a related company, Tronic Technology Network (HK) Company Limited 
as well as a range of other Hong Kong companies.  Tronic was the 
subject of a previous unfavorable pre-license check described in 
reftel B. 
 
¶4.  Internet research reveals that Dragon Well is a subsidiary of 
China Oriental Express (www.coe.com.hk).  Ms. Lo, Ha (referenced 
above) is a director in both Dragon Well and China Oriental.  Dragon 
Well and China Oriental Express are freight forwarders. 
 
¶5.  On December 3, 2008, ECO and Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan 
visited Dragon Well at the address listed above and met with Tony 
Choi of Dragon Well and Ms. Ida Ho of Source Photonics, the end user 
of the item.  Ms. Ho (who did not have a business card to share) 
explained that Source Photonics is the company resulting from the 
merger of Luminentoic (the exporter of record) and Fiberxon (the 
end-user on some of the applicable documentation provided to ECO by 
Ms. Ho and OEA). A review of the web site of Source Photonics 
(www.sourcephotonics.com) confirms this information. Ms. Ho of 
Source Photonics stated that the company produces communication 
modules for optical receivers. 
 
¶6.  According to Mr. Choi, Dragon Well is a long-term logistics 
provider to Fiberxon (now Source Photonics) and provides warehouse 
and logistics services to the company's mainland based factory. Mr. 
Choi further stated that the factory in Shenzhen completes all 
customs and other formalities on the shipments.  When asked, Mr. 
Choi could give no clear answer on whether Dragon Well (or any other 
party) applies for required Hong Kong licenses for import of 
strategic items into Hong Kong and their subsequent reexport.  ECO 
assumes Dragon Well does not apply for required Hong Kong licenses 
in this respect (and that it is unaware of any applicable U.S. 
licensing requirements for items controlled by U.S. law for reexport 
from Hong Kong). 
 
¶7.  ECO reviewed various shipment documentation provided by Mr. Choi 
and Ms. Ho of Source Photonics and it appears in order showing 
shipment to Source Photonics in Shenzhen. 
 
¶8.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes that the 
applicable items were, in fact, shipped to Source Photonics in 
Shenzhen.  ECO notes that Dragon Well appears to be unaware of Hong 
Kong and U.S. export control rules.  ECO requests that OEA confirm 
the 3A001 classification of the applicable item so that ECO may 
reach out to Hong Kong TID concerning a potential violation of Hong 
Kong's export control rules in connection with this shipment.  A 
determination of the control status of the item will likely also 
determine whether a violation of U.S. law occurred in respect of 
this shipment.
