1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Biomers Pte. Ltd., B 
Prince George's Park, Singapore (Biomers). The item in question is 
S2 glass triaxial braided sleeve exported on or about June 22, 2007 
and valued at USD 4,000.  The item is classified under Export 
Control Classification Number (ECCN) 1C210 and is controlled for 
nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons.  The exporter was A and P 
Technology, Inc. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, Biomers has been 
in existence since 2005.  Its paid-up share capital is the Singapore 
equivalent of USD 2.8 million.  U.S. national Randall Jay Wall, 
Canadian George Jim Aliphtiras and Singaporeans Tham Chee Kuan and 
Mervyn Tathiianathan are listed as directors. 
 
¶4.  On April 21, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs visited the company and met with Ms. Renuga Gopal, 
Vice President, Product Development. Ms. Gopal stated that the 
company's business focuses on orthodontic products.  In particular, 
the company designs and produces aesthetic orthodontic wires.  It is 
a small operation in Singapore and the ECO viewed the three-room 
production facility.  The Singapore operation is an affiliate of 
U.S. company Biomers Products, LLC located in Naples Florida 
(www.biomersbraces.com). 
 
¶5.  As to the particular item in question, Ms. Gopal stated that the 
company had considered using it as part of retainers and braces but 
had not been successful.  Presently, the company is using S-2 
unidirectional glass product it obtained pursuant to USDOC license 
D358827.  Ms. Gopal produced the item that was subject to the check 
for review.  It was wrapped in four spools of which only one spool 
had been opened.  ECO reviewed the documentation and found it to be 
in order.  ECO also advised Ms. Gopal that prior approval from BIS 
was required for any resale or reexport of the product as stipulated 
in the applicable license conditions. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Biomers appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the commodities shipped since Biomers cooperated with the PSV, 
provided ECO with access to the item and operates a line of business 
consistent with the item's use.  Also, Biomers was informed of the 
applicable license conditions and indicated its intent to comply 
with the conditions and U.S. export controls more generally.
