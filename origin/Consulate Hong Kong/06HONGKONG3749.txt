¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per Reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Export Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer 
Philip Ankel (ECO) and Special Agent (SA) John McKenna 
conducted a pre-license check at Supreme Company 
(Supreme), Room 1814, Park-In Commercial Center, 56 
Dundas Street, Mong Kok, Hong Kong.  This PLC concerned 
100 bayonets valued at USD 7,600 and classified under 
ECCN 0A918.  ECCN 0A918 items are controlled for crime 
control (CC) reasons. The license applicant is Ontario 
Knife Company, 26 Empire Street, Franklinville, N.Y. 
 
¶3. On August 23, 2006 SA McKenna and the ECO visited 
Supreme at the address listed above and met with Tania 
Chau, Director. 
 
¶4. Chau stated that he ordered 30 bayonets, not 100 as 
listed Reftel A, for sale to collectors. Chau stated 
that the bayonets would be placed in his showroom at 
the above address (room 1802) and sold to collectors 
who visited his showroom.  He expected to sell 1-2 of 
these items per month. By follow-up e-mail to the ECO, 
Mr. Chau stated that Supreme had, in fact, ordered 100 
bayonets from Supreme Co.  This would appear to provide 
Supreme Co. with a four to eight year supply of 
bayonets. 
 
¶5.  Chau stated the he understood that the USG placed 
licensing restrictions on these items, and as such, 
they could not be reexported to China.  He provided no 
specifics on how Supreme would ensure that no such 
reexports occurred. 
 
¶6.  Chau stated that he does not sell items via the 
internet, however, an internet search revealed an 
extensive listing of items available for purchase over 
the internet from Supreme's web site 
(Supremeco.com.hk).  Some of those items would appear 
to fall within EAR control parameters.  The ECO 
recommends that a review of the web site be conducted. 
 
¶7. Chau stated that he orders items from U.S. 
manufacturers Ontario knife, Colt Steel, United 
Cutlery, CRKT, and Black Jack.  The majority of his 
customers for all of these commodities are collectors. 
 Mr. Chau indicated that he considers collectors to be 
individuals who like to purchase various weapons and 
related items for display or recreational purposes. 
 
¶8. Chau indicated that he has been in business since 
1987 and he attends the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas 
in an effort to identify items of interest and to 
review the latest line of items for sale within the 
industry. 
 
¶9.  Note:  Supreme was the subject of a previous 
unfavorable PLC described in Reftel C. 
 
¶10. Consistent with the facts noted above, the ECO 
recommends that this check be considered Unfavorable.
