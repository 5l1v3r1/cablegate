1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel B request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the 
USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), 
Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post-shipment verification of a 
shipment bound for Erqiang Technology (H.K.) 
(Erqiang), Flat 1105, Block B, Ching Lai Court 264 
Lai King Hill Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The item 
in question is five ring polyphenyl ether, 
classified under Export Control Classification 
Number (ECCN) 1C006 and controlled for national 
security (NS) reasons. The item was shipped 
pursuant to Commerce Department license D368037. 
The exporter was Arch Technology Holding LLC of 
St. Charles, Missouri. 
 
¶3.  Erqiang and this particular shipment was the 
subject of a pre-license check referenced in 
reftel C.  In reftel C, the ECO provided a 
detailed corporate description of the proposed 
end-user and that company's relationship with 
Erqiang.  In particular, the ECO noted that the 
end-user, Photon Technology Co. Ltd., was the 
parent company of Erqiang and had recently merged 
with Neophotonics, Inc. of California.  The ECO's 
recommendation for that pre-license check was 
Favorable. 
 
¶4.  Commercial Assistant Florence Tam attempted, 
on several occasions, to set up an appointment 
with Erqiang.  It emerged from several phone calls 
with Ms. Hoi Ping Chu, previous representative of 
Erqiang, that Erqiang is apparently no longer 
operational (although the Hong Kong companies 
registry lists that company as "active").  Mr. Chu 
stated to Commercial Assistant Tam that, as a 
result of the merger between Photon Technology Co. 
Ltd. and Neophotonics, Inc., Erqiang no longer 
acts as logistics provider for Photon Technology 
Co. Ltd. 
 
¶5.  Ms. Chu declined ECO's requests to meet and 
discuss the transaction that is the subject of 
this PSV.  Ms. Chu stated that she is running her 
new business from her home and did not wish to 
meet the ECO there.  Nonetheless, she agreed to 
assist in obtaining information about the shipment 
of the items in question.  By fax, Ms. Chu 
provided documentation tracing the shipment from 
the U.S. exporter to Erqiang (while it was still 
operational) to Photon Technology's appointed Hong 
Kong courier, Eternal Asia (HK) Ltd.  Eternal Asia 
was the subject of an unfavorable PSV referenced 
in reftel E.  Ms. Chu provided a further delivery 
confirmation from Photon Technology indicating 
that the item had been received by that company on 
January 29, 2007. 
 
¶6.  Given that it is purportedly no longer in 
operation, Erqiang does not appear to be a 
suitable recipient of controlled U.S. origin 
items.  Nonetheless, the information and 
documentation provided by the former staff person 
from Erqiang suggests that the item in question 
reached its intended destination.  In light of the 
fact that the ECO could not inspect the item (as 
it was apparently already in mainland China) the 
ECO recommends that this PSV be classified as 
Limited.
