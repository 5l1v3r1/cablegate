1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel B request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Edal Electronics Co. Ltd., No. 
17, Wang Chiu Road 6/F, Continental Industrial Building, Hong Kong 
(Edal). The items in question for this PSV are various 
semiconductors exported to Edal on or about May 1, 2008 and May 21, 
¶2008.  On the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), the May 
1, 2008 shipment items are classified under export control 
classification number (ECCN) 3A001 and, if properly classified, 
would be controlled for national security (NS) reasons.  Based on 
documentation provided by the exporter, it appears that these items 
are of the class that may be exported license free to Hong Kong, but 
would require a license for export or reexport to mainland China 
because of their ability to function at extreme temperatures (ECCN 
3A001a2c). The applicable shippers export declaration (SED) for the 
May 21, 2008 shipment does not include a classification for the 
items meaning that they are likely EAR99 and eligible for shipment 
to virtually all destinations and end-uses/users worldwide.  The 
exporter for both shipments was Rochester Electronics LLC of 
Newburyport, Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  Background information concerning Edal is provided in reftel A 
and is therefore not repeated herein. 
 
¶4.  On June 3, 2009, ECO visited Edal and met with Jean Yun, Senior 
Sales Executive.  She was also the person that ECO met in January 
2009 (that meeting is described in reftel A).  Ms. Yun provided 
documentation concerning the May 21st shipment.  In particular, she 
provided a purchase order from Hong Kong company Leron International 
(H.K.) Ltd. (Leron), Rm. 204C, 2/F, Lai Cheung Factory Building, 
479-479A Castle Peak Road, Hong Kong (with telephone 852-2959-3601 
and fax 852 2959-3069).  The end user statement completed by Edal on 
Leron's behalf lists the China Aviation Industry 631 Institute as 
the end user in this transaction. 
 
¶5.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Leron has been in 
existence since 2003. It has the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 130 in 
share capital. Mainland China nationals Cai, Lihong 
(PP#432322791102262) and Zhao, Jianjun (PP# G00205618) are listed as 
directors.  Leron does not appear to have a web presence. 
 
¶6.  Another company, Ralco International Limited, is co-located with 
Leron.  It has less than the Hong Kong equivalent of one USD in 
share capital. Its directors include Zhao Jin (likely the same 
person as Zhao Jianjun listed above) and Indian national Roy, Rashmi 
(Indian passport number P-414913).  Ralco has a web presence and is 
an electronic components distributor (www.ralcohk.com). 
 
¶7.  According to information independently obtained by ECO from 
Arrow Electronics, Ralco purchased ECCN 3A001a2c electronic 
components from Arrow in 2008. 
 
¶8.  As to the May 1, 2007 shipment, documentation provided by Ms. 
Yun confirms that the items in this shipment were sold to G&L Co. 
for ultimate consignee Tai Chung Electronics Ltd. in Taiwan.  As 
noted in reftel A, ECO views it as unlikely that the true customer 
is, in fact, Tai Chung or G&L. 
 
¶9.  As noted in reftel A, ECO recommends further outreach to 
Rochester Electronics to ascertain its knowledge of these 
transactions (and, in particular, the transaction involving G&L) and 
to encourage it to police its distributors more closely.  ECO also 
recommends a close review of any shipments to Ralco and Leron as 
well as their respective addresses.  ECO notes that Rochester 
shipments have been the subject of multiple unfavorable end use 
checks implicating similar products and similar procurement 
tactics.
