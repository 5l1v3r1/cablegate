Macau 
----- 
 
Macau is neither home to nor does it support terrorist groups. 
However, Macau's position as a major international gambling center 
makes it a potential site for money laundering and terrorist 
financing activities. 
 
Macau's financial regulatory authorities directed banks and other 
financial institutions to continuously search for terrorist 
financing networks and accounts using lists of individuals and 
entities designated by the U.S. under relevant authorities, as well 
as the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee's consolidated list of 
individuals and entities associated with al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and 
Usama bin Ladin. 
 
Macau is a member of the Asia/Pacific Group (APG) on Money 
Laundering and completed a mutual evaluation of its Anti-Money 
Laundering (AML) regime in 2007.  In response to recommendations of 
the APG evaluation, Macau authorities have taken steps to improve 
compliance with suspicious transactions reporting (STR) requirements 
in banks, casinos, and professional associations, but the threshold 
reporting limits remain well above international norms.  Macau does 
not have reporting requirements for cross-border currency movements. 
 
 
In May 2009, Macau joined the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence 
Units through its Financial Intelligence Office (FIO), an 
independent government unit under Macau's Secretary for Economy and 
Finance.  The FIO played an essential role in Macau's AML regime by 
collecting and analyzing STRs, providing AML assistance to local 
authorities, raising the public's AML awareness within Macau, and 
sharing information with overseas counterparts. 
 
In September 2009, the Macau Monetary Authority (acronym AMCM) 
strengthened its AML guidelines for financial institutions, money 
changers and remittance agents by mandating enhanced customer due 
diligence measures and the compulsory employment of AMCM-approved 
AML compliance officers. 
 
Macau cooperated internationally in counterterrorism efforts through 
INTERPOL and other security-focused organizations within the Asia 
Pacific Region.  Macau's law enforcement and customs agencies 
participated in USG-sponsored training in bulk cash smuggling 
detection, weapons of mass destruction proliferation awareness 
workshops, and complex financial investigation techniques.
