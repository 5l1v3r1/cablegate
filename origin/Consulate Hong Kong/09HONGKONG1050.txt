REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated May 26, 2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post-shipment verification (PSV) at Smith Associates Far East, 
7/F, West Wing, Warwick House, Taikoo Place, 979 King's Road, Hong 
Kong (Smith Associates). The items in question for this PSV are two 
shipments of semiconductors exported to Smith Associates on or about 
July 7, 2007 and July 20, 2007.  The applicable shippers export 
declarations (SEDs) for these shipments do not include a 
classification for the items meaning that they are likely EAR99 and 
eligible for shipment to virtually all destinations and 
end-uses/users worldwide.  The exporter for both shipments was 
Rochester Electronics LLC of Newburyport, Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Smith Associates 
was registered in 1998 and has the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 1300 
in paid up share capital.  A range of U.S. nationals are listed as 
directors of Smith Associates. 
 
¶4.  Web based research reveals that Smith & Associates 
(www.smithweb.com)is a Houston-based worldwide independent 
electronic components distributor.  It has offices in a range of 
locations including Europe, the United States, Hong Kong as well as 
several locations in China.  Annual sales are in excess of USD 500 
million. 
 
¶5.  On June 3, 2009, ECO visited the company and met with Mr. Kellam 
Kimbrough, Director of Operations, Asia and Ms. Terry Fu, Operations 
Manager.  Mr. Kimbrough provided an overview of Smith in Hong Kong. 
He noted that while Smith may ship worldwide from its Hong Kong 
location, the sales force in Hong Kong serves primarily the China 
and U.S. markets.  Mr. Kimbrough noted that the company is not a 
distributor and does not represent manufacturers but rather acts as 
a pure sourcing agent for a range of customers.  Those customers 
include OEMs and contract manufacturers as well as other brokers and 
traders. 
 
¶6. Mr. Kimbrough stated that Smith reviews its new customers by 
review of their corporate and financial records.  He also stated 
that Smith also checks all customers against BIS and duYjoraton conirin tat theshpmnt had ben

aieiHsen, Tawa. Bysubseqen emal, Mr.Kibrough stated 
that the items were used by Aurumech to manufacture PC motherboards 
for a client i Europe.  Mr. Kimbrough stated that his salesperson 
was unable to find a web presence for Aurumtech.  ECO also 
researched the company and could find no Taiwan web presence for the 
company.  However, the company is listed in the Taiwan companies 
registry and its business activities include electronics 
manufacturing and reselling. 
 
¶8.  The discussion next turned to the Rochester Electronics End Use 
Statements purportedly completed by Andy Jang, the Smith and 
Associates Korea buyer.  ECO notes that it appears to be Rochester 
practice to have its salespersons complete End Use Statements on 
behalf of customers (based on information provided by those 
customers).  The End Use Statements for these shipments state that 
the customer in question was Seminanchips Co. Ltd. in Korea and that 
the end use was the production of a notebook computer.  Mr. 
Kimbrough stated that his sales person (Andy Jang) stated that he 
did not know how Seminanchips came to be included on the End Use 
Statement.  He provided e-mail correspondence from Aurumtech to 
Smith detailing the order.  ECO has requested additional information 
about the Polar Star matter (mentioned above) and on the End Use 
Statements provided by Smith to Rochester (if any exist) and will 
forward that to OEA on receipt. 
 
¶9.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes Smith 
Associates to be a suitable recipient of controlled U.S. origin 
technology.
