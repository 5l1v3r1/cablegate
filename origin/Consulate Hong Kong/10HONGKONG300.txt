REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated February 3, 2010 (01210117) 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment verification (PSV) at Solar Energy International Co. 
(Solar Energy). The items in question for this PSV are various 
microprocessors exported to Solar Energy on or about September 24, 
¶2009.  According to information provided by OEA, these 
microprocessors are likely classified under Export Control 
Classification Number 3A991 and controlled for anti-terrorism 
reasons, meaning that they can be shipped license free to virtually 
all destinations and end-users worldwide without a license.  The 
exporter was Crown Micro International of Fremont, California. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Solar Energy 
International Co., Limited was registered in 2001.  It has the Hong 
Kong equivalent of USD 1250 in share capital.  Hong Kong Residents 
Chu, Ying Kit and Poon, Kuk Man are listed as directors. 
 
¶4.  According to the company's web site (www.kukram.com), the 
company specializes in the computer related peripherals business. 
The company also markets its own brand of memory modules (kukram). 
The company serves customers worldwide including in the Middle East. 
 
 
¶5.  On February 8, 2010, ECO and FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie 
Chan visited the company at the address noted above and met with Mr. 
Simon Chu (CEO) and his wife, Ms. Poon, Kuk Man (Director). Mr. Chu 
was quite nervous about the visit and asked several times why the 
ECO was visiting his company. 
 
¶6.  Mr. Chu provided an overview of the company.  He noted that the 
company ships to customers worldwide.  Crown Micro (the exporter) is 
a usual supplier and Solar Energy representatives met this company 
at the CIBIT event in Germany.  According to Mr. Chu, Solar Energy 
does not sell to any of the embargoed countries (although he had 
some difficulty naming them) and specifically never to Iran.  He 
noted that, as of late, there is a range of product supply coming 
from Dubai because of the downturn in the economy there.  ECO 
surmises that the company used to sell more products to Dubai but no 
longer sells as much in that direction. 
 
¶7.  As to the specific shipment in question, Mr. Chu provided 
documentation confirming that some items had been sold to South Asia 
Associates and picked up by Zeon Technology Limited (Mr. Chu stated 
that this was done at the request of the purchaser).  According to 
the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Zeon Technology Limited's 
directors include Boris Chtchourovski and Olga Smirnova.  Other 
items were sold and delivered to Pronet Group in Moscow 
(www.pronetgroup.ru).  The items for Pronet Group were sent to the 
company at a Singapore address.  Ms. Poon, Kuk Man stated that 
Pronet consolidates its shipments in Singapore for shipment to 
Russia. The direction that these items took to get to their 
(apparent) final destination is somewhat unusual.  This is the first 
time that ECO has seen a shipment of electronics from the United 
States bound for Russia that was routed through Hong Kong (and 
Singapore).  Mr. Chu and Ms. Poon were not aware of the end uses of 
the items in question. A final set of products was reexported to 
Hyde Shenzhen Century Technology Development Co., Ltd., a mainland 
Chinese software development company. 
 
¶8.  Mr. Chu stated that he is keen to comply with U.S. export 
controls as he will be traveling shortly to the United States.  ECO 
sent, by e-mail, additional information concerning U.S. export 
controls to Mr. Chu. 
 
¶9.  Mr. Chu was, on the whole, open and forthcoming during the 
meeting and provided the requested documentation.  Based on the 
information at hand, ECO can find no apparent violation associated 
with these shipments.
