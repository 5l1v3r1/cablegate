SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: 
BEIJING RUST S&T COMPANY LTD. 
 
REF: A) 04971 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) at Beijing Rust S & T Company Ltd., 
7/F Pahsang Industrial Building, 16 San On Street, Hong 
Kong (Beijing Rust). The PSV concerned GPS surveying 
equipment valued at $26,286 exported to Beijing Rust by 
Timble Navigation Ltd. of Dayton, Ohio in April 2006. 
Trimble classified the equipment under ECCN 7A994, 
which ECCN is controlled for anti-terrorism reasons 
(AT). 
 
¶3. Repeated attempts by FCS staff to reach Beijing Rust 
as the number provided in Reftel A were unsuccessful. 
In fact, a representative from the telephone company's 
directory assistance service stated that there is no 
phone number listed for Beijing Rust.  The management 
company for the Pahsang Building stated that Beijing 
Rust had left its building in July and had left no 
contact information.  Finally, the ECO visited the 
Pasang Building on November 15, 2006.  No reference to 
Beijing Rust was included in the building directory and 
both of the two business entrances on the 7th floor of 
the building were locked and showed no indication that 
Beijing Rust was doing business at those locations. 
 
¶4.  A web search of the name Beijing Rust revealed that 
Beijing Rust has an office in Beijing and that it acts 
as a distributor for Trimble Navigation 
(www.rustsales.com.cn).  Inquiry with that company in 
Beijing may reveal further information about the 
shipment (since this entity is listed as the "bill to" 
entity on the applicable invoice). 
 
¶5.  It appears to the ECO that any presence that 
Beijing Rust had in Hong Kong was closed in July when 
it left the Pahsang building.  If the equipment has 
been classified correctly, it can most likely be 
exported to Hong Kong and reexported/transshipped to 
mainland China NLR (No License Required).  The ECO can 
find no specific reason to assume that anything 
untoward has occurred in respect of this shipment. 
Therefore, in accordance with guidance on reporting of 
PSVs where the items cannot be physically inspected, 
the ECO recommends that this PSV be classified as 
Limited.
