¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), 
accompanied by Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan, conducted a post 
shipment verification (PSV) at A&P Instrument Co. Ltd. (A&P), Unit 
1, Kam Hon Industrial Building, 8 Wang Kwun Road, Kowloon Bay, Hong 
Kong.  The items in question are two centrifugal pumps classified 
under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2B350 and the 
subject of BIS license application D416901. The license applicant is 
Cole-Parmer Instrument Company of Vernon Hills, Illinois. 
 
¶3.  A review of the Hong Kong Companies Registry reveals that the 
A&P's main corporate information has not changed since the EUCs 
referenced in reftels B and C. 
 
¶4.  The ECO visited A&P at the address referenced above on May 15, 
2009 and met with Mr. Andy Wu, Senior Manager.  Mr. Wu provided 
documentation confirming that the Hong Kong University of Science 
and Technology had ordered the items (as well as a number of 
additional items).  Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan subsequently 
called the HKUST directly to confirm the order.  S.W. Woo of the 
University's Department of Mechanical Engineering confirmed the 
order. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Wu is quite familiar with U.S. export/reexport controls 
after having been visited twice before by ECO and after having 
attended a BIS export controls event in 2008 in Hong Kong. 
 
¶6. At the time visited, A&P appeared to be a suitable recipient of 
U.S. origin controlled commodities (as reseller).
