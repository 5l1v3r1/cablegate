¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) was 
requested to conduct a post-shipment verification (PSV) at Oasis 
Hong Kong Airlines Limited, Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Wing, 80 
South Perimeter Road, Hong Kong (Oasis).  The item in question is a 
data management unit exported to Oasis on or about September 1, 2007 
and valued at approximately USD 41,000.  The item is classified 
under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 7A994.  This ECCN 
is controlled for Anti-Terrorism (AT) reasons. The exporter was 
Honeywell International Inc. of Redmond, Washington. 
 
¶3. A review of Hong Kong Companies Registry reveals that Oasis was 
registered in 2005 and has a registered capital of the Hong Kong 
equivalent of USD 15 million.  Its directors are U.S. national Lee, 
Cho Min Raymond and Hong Kong residents Lee, Hwang Priscilla, 
Miller, Stephen Henry and Yung, Tse Kowng Steven. 
 
¶4.  Oasis is a newer budget airline in Hong Kong.  It also recently 
declared bankruptcy and is no longer operational.  At the request of 
OEA, ECO is therefore closing out this PSV without further action. 
ECO notes that in Reftel B, ECO visited Oasis's maintenance 
contractor that likely received the item in question in connection 
with another export to Oasis.  In that case, ECO made a favorable 
recommendation.
