¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), conducted a pre-license 
check (PLC) at Medic Pharm Technology (International) 
Limited (Medic Pharm), Room 1301, Fook Yip Building, 
53-57 Kwai Fung Crescent, Kwai Chung, Hong Kong. The 
purpose of the PLC was to determine the suitability of 
Medic Pharm to be the recipient of biochemical and 
clinical diagnostic kits that test for the presence of 
biological agents.  The items (ECCN 1A004) are valued 
at USD $2,500 and are controlled for chemical and 
biological warfare (CB) reasons. The license applicant 
is Tetracore, Inc., of Rockville, Maryland (Tetracore). 
 
¶3.  In fact, Medic Pharm is the procurement agent for 
the Hong Kong Police Force in this transaction.  Prior 
to visiting Medic Pharm, on November 1, 2006, the ECO 
visited the procurement department of the Hong Kong 
Police Force and met with Ms. Angie Woo, Supplies 
Officer.  She confirmed the order for the applicable 
items.  According to Ms. Woo, Medic Pharm supplies 
various items to the Hong Kong Police Force pursuant to 
tenders roughly three to four times per year and Ms. 
Woo considers them to be a reputable and reliable 
company. 
 
¶4.  On November 8, 2006, the ECO visited Medic Pharm at 
the address above and met with Mr. Fuk Sang Chiu, 
Managing Director.  Medic Pharm's corporate 
registration documents list Mr. Chiu as one of the 
directors of the company as well as Ms. Wang Marie Chiu 
and Ms. Sui Mei Lo.  Those documents also list a 
corporate address that matches with the address where 
the PLC was conducted.  Medic Pharm has been in 
existence since February 2000.  It is a small trading 
company with a handful of employees. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Chiu stated that Medic Pharm is a trading 
company specializing in items with various medical 
applications, primarily relatively low-level items such 
as surgical masks and gloves.  Approximately three 
years ago, Mr. Chiu met representatives of Tetracore at 
a trade show and developed a business relationship with 
that company thereafter.  Medic Pharm is presently the 
exclusive distributor of Tetracore in Hong Kong and 
Macau.  Mr. Chiu stressed that he does not sell 
Tetracore's products into mainland China and that 
Tetracore has indicated it will terminate his 
distributorship agreement if he does so. 
 
¶6.  Mr. Chiu stated that he is quite familiar with U.S. 
export laws and is keen to maintain access to U.S. 
origin products by complying with U.S. export controls. 
 He further stated that he expects that one or two 
additional license applications will be forthcoming 
from Tetracore for Medic Pharm generated orders in Hong 
Kong and Macau. 
 
¶7.  When asked for promotional literature concerning 
the company, Mr. Chiu provided a Company Profile that 
makes reference to the Yue Tai Trading Group that 
comprises both Medic Pharm and Yue Tai Trading Company. 
 According to the profile, Yue Tai was founded in 1987 
and serves primarily the mainland China market.  Yue 
Tai's primary customers are the Beijing Ministry of 
Health Bureau and military hospitals as well as 
provincial public health bureaus.  When asked about the 
company's business in mainland China, Mr. Chiu 
indicated that this business has been substantially 
reduced since 2002 as a result of difficulties in doing 
business in mainland China and difficulties in 
obtaining controlled items to sell to the mainland. 
 
¶8.  Medic Pharm was very forthcoming during the PLC 
visit.  Mr. Chiu provided information on the underlying 
transaction and was keen to provide the ECO all 
necessary information concerning his business and his 
intent to comply with U.S. export controls.  The ECO 
recommends that this PLC be considered Favorable.
