¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a pre-license check at the Hong Kong Competition Shooting 
Association, Flat A&B, 10/F, Ka Wing Factory Bldg., 19-21 Ng Fong 
Street, Hong Kong (HKCSA).  The purpose of the visit was to 
determine the suitability of the HKCSA to be a recipient of 36 
optical red dot sighting systems that are the subject of export 
license application D392696. The items (Export Control 
Classification Number 0A9987) are valued at approximately USD $6,000 
and are controlled for crime control (CC) reasons. The license 
applicant is C-More Systems of Manassas, Virginia. 
 
¶3.  The HKCSA is an air gun shooting group.  It is organized in Hong 
Kong as an association, not as a corporate entity and is registered 
with the Hong Kong Police Department (standard for associations in 
Hong Kong).  Since its focus is on low power air guns, it does not 
require separate registration related to conventional guns.  More 
information and pictures of HKCSA's premises can be found at 
www.hkcsa.com. 
 
¶4.  On April 11, 2008, ECO, accompanied by Commercial Assistant, 
Carrie Chan visited the offices of HKCSA and met with Mr. Ryan Chu, 
Chairman.  He stated that this is HKCSA's third order for these 
types of products.  He stated that HKCSA is an association of sport 
shooting enthusiasts who meet at the HKCSA's premises and elsewhere 
for air gun shooting competitions.  ECO saw the premises and 
believes them to be consistent with use for such a purpose. 
 
¶5.  As to the particular items in question, Mr. Chu stated that 
HKCSA will purchase them for resale to members of HKCSA for use 
during competitions.  He stated that HKCSA had likewise sold its 
previous orders to members.  He stated that HKCSA has over 100 
members and many of those members own several air guns.  He further 
stated that those members are Hong Kong residents. 
 
¶6.  ECO provided Mr. Chu with information about BIS reexport 
controls and stressed that the items in question may not be 
reexported to mainland China.  Mr. Chu indicated that he understood 
and that he would review closely the information provide by the ECO. 
 
 
¶7.  At the time visited, the HKCSA appeared to be a suitable 
recipient of the subject controlled items since it cooperated fully 
with the PLC and provided information on HKCSA's proposed use of the 
items in Hong Kong
