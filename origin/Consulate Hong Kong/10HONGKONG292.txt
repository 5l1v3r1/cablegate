SUBJECT: SOMALI PIRACY: HONG KONG SHIP OWNERS TO LOBBY 
CHINA ON RUMORED UNITED NATIONS RANSOM BAN 
 
REF: HONG KONG 267 
 
¶1. (SBU) On February 18, Hong Kong Ship Owners Association 
(HKSOA) Managing Director Arthur Bowring informed Post that 
the HKSOA would approach China's Foreign Ministry 
Commissioner in Hong Kong to raise the industry's concerns 
over a rumored United Nations ban on ransom payments to 
pirates.  Responding to a request from the London-based 
International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the HKSOA plans to 
advise China, in its role as a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council, on the industry's opposition to the rumored 
ban. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bowring shared a copy of the ICS letter and asked 
that industry concerns be conveyed to Washington, stressing 
that any ruling that impacted ship owners' ability to ensure 
the protection and release of their crews could potentially 
affect international trade.  The text of the ICS letter 
follows.  (Note: Post conveyed contents of ICS letter 
SPC(10)05 mentioned below via reftel.  End Note.)

POTENTIAL UNITED NATIONS BAN ON PAYMENT OF RANSOMS TO PIRATES 
 
Action requested: To note that the issue of a potential ban 
on the payment of ransoms to pirates may be brought to the UN 
Security Council, and to brief your foreign ministry 
officials accordingly. 
 
Further to SPC(10)05, which concerned reports that the United 
States might be considering some kind of ban on the payment 
of ransoms to Somali pirates, ICS has received advice from 
the CSG Secretariat. 
 
It seems that the United States is actually considering an 
international mechanism to impose the ban - UN Security 
Council Resolution 1844, which concerns entities or 
individuals that threaten peace and security in Somalia.  If 
pirate gangs, or their leaders, were included on what is 
effectively a UN 'black list', it could then be illegal for 
shipping companies - of any UN Member State - to pay ransoms 
to these pirates.  The US could then presumably enforce this 
ban though its Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), 
applying sanctions to visiting ships or their companies' US 
offices.  However, other nations might also be minded to 
enforce such a ban. 
 
We understand that decisions on whether entities fall under 
the scope of UN Resolution 1844 is taken by a Committee 
established by Security Council 751, which includes all 
Security Council members.  However, it is unknown when or 
even if such a decision will be debated, presumably it will 
only be debated if the US State Department finally decides 
that this is the most suitable route.  Our understanding is 
 
HONG KONG 00000292  002 OF 002 
 
 
that State Department officials are currently divided on the 
matter, although a decision is thought to be imminent 
(through our contacts, the views of ICS have been made known 
to those involved). 
 
National associations whose governments currently have a seat 
on the UN Security Council are therefore requested to contact 
their foreign ministries, as soon as possible, advising them 
of the practical reasons why a ban on the payment of ransoms 
should be strongly opposed. 
 
Members will also wish to liaise with their maritime 
administrations to help them lobby foreign ministries. 
 
To reiterate the arguments: 
 
- The first is humanitarian.  What else are shipowners meant 
to do when the seafarers they employ, and to whom they have a 
duty of care, are taken hostage, often for months at a time, 
in appalling conditions, with their lives at serious risk, 
and with no hope of rescue by their governments? 
 
- If such a ban were implemented, what would happen to those 
seafarers who are currently being held hostage (typically, at 
any one time, about 250 seafarers are being held by pirates)? 
 
- If such a ban were implemented, it has to be understood 
that the likely result would be that the majority of 
shipowners would avoid the Gulf of Aden, the Suez Canal and 
north west Indian Ocean altogether (most large ships would 
divert around the Cape of Good Hope).  Many ships' crews 
would also be likely to refuse to sail in the danger area 
(which covers well over a million square miles).  This would 
clearly have a significant affect on the flow of a large 
proportion of international trade, and send a signal to the 
effect that the international community has been unable to 
prevent the creation by the pirates of a huge 'no go' area in 
a region of great strategic importance. 
 
- Finally, it is worth reiterating that there is absolutely 
no evidence (so far as we are aware) of any links between the 
pirates, who are criminal opportunists, and terrorism. 
 
The help of national associations will be greatly appreciated.
