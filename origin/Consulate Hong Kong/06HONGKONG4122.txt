SUBJECT: ADVANCING U.S. - HONG KONG AVIATION SERVICES 
AGREEMENT 
 
REF: 2005 HONG KONG 5622 
 
¶1.  On October 12, Acting Deputy Principal Officer 
Charbonnet delivered EB/TRA/AN Director Tom EngleQs letter 
to Economic Development and Labor Bureau Deputy Secretary 
Michael Wong and emphasized that the United States is 
interested in advancing the U.S. - Hong Kong civil aviation 
relationship.  Noting that Wong had assumed the job of Hong 
KongQs aviation services head negotiator in August, 
Charbonnet indicated that both sides should take a fresh 
look at the bilateral aviation relationship and seek ways 
to move ahead.  Wong responded that he would confer within 
his government and with QHong KongQs airlines,Q namely 
Cathay Pacific, and reply to Mr. EngleQs letter. 
 
¶2.  Wong also raised the status of the U.S. - Hong Kong 
Mutual Aviation Tax Exemption Agreement.  He acknowledged 
that the Hong Kong government owed the United States an 
answer on finalizing the Agreement (see reftel); however, 
two contrasting views exist in Hong Kong regarding the 
Agreement.  Cathay Pacific believes that the Agreement 
would be beneficial; however, the Inland Revenue 
DepartmentQs initial view of the Agreement is not positive. 
Wong stated that he is waiting for the Inland Revenue 
DepartmentQs final opinion on the Agreement and hoped to 
resolve the two opposing views.
