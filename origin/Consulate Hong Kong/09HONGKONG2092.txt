HEADLINES AND EXCERPTS: 
 
¶1. President Obama's China visit 
 
"Surprise and expectation from Obama's China visit" 
 
The mass-circulation Chinese-language Apple Daily News remarked in 
an editorial (11/13):  "U.S. President Obama will arrive in Shanghai 
on November 15 commencing his maiden visit to China.  As a leader of 
a free world and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the first 
surprise brought by Obama to Chinese netizens was that those in 
China yesterday found that they were able to access freely Facebook, 
Twitter, Blogspot, YouTube, etc.  Hence, they hope that Obama will 
topple the Chinese-style Berlin War - the Great Fire Wall.  However, 
the political reality of both the U.S. and China tells that the 
higher the Chinese netizens' expectation, the more disappointed they 
will be....  Obama's China visit will focus on economic issues like 
the Renminbi exchange rate and China's market economy status.  Of 
course, Obama will raise the level of cooperation on environmental 
protection and climate change.  But will he take steps on the human 
rights issue and how much effort will he make to topple the Great 
Fire Wall?  It is questionable.  The U.S. Embassy in China yesterday 
invited a group of Chinese bloggers to a seminar.  The U.S. was 
asked if it shared common values with China.  U.S. officials did not 
respond directly.  They just said both China and the U.S. were big 
powers and they had common interests like peace, prosperity and 
regional security.  It can be seen that China and the U.S. share 
common interests but do not share common values." 
 
¶2. China 
 
"The West praises China; China must watch out for 'being killed by 
the one who praises'" 
 
The independent Chinese-language Hong Kong Economic Times commented 
in an editorial (11/13):  "The international financial magazine 
'Forbes' yesterday announced the global power list.  Chinese 
President Hu Jintao ranked second, just behind U.S. President Obama. 
 Facing the praise of the west, China should remain indifferent no 
matter whether it is being favored or humiliated.  It should watch 
out for 'being killed by the one that praises.'  It should avoid 
being taken advantage of by others using the excuse that China has 
the responpiwXd.  China is still a 
developing country.  Its GDP per capita ranks beyond 100.  If it has 
to bear the so-called responsibility of the big power, for example, 
to abide by the relatively high emission reduction requirement, its 
economic development will be checked and it will easily be taken 
advantage of.  Of course, China has its international responsibility 
but it must act according to its capability." 
 
¶3. North and South Korea 
 
"Why was there a military skirmish between North and South Korea?" 
 
The pro-PRC Chinese-language Macau Daily News remarked in an 
editorial (11/13):  "...The skirmish this time is not accidental. 
Judging from past skirmishes, the incident this time was inevitable. 
 The root of the problem is the military confrontation between North 
and South Korea and the fault in the regional security mechanism. 
The tense relations between North and South Korea have led to a 
state of extreme suspicion and fear.  Any sign of trouble may result 
in a tragic event....   The skirmish this time happened at a very 
sensitive and subtle moment.  On the one hand, the North Korean 
nuclear issue has been in a stalemate.  Obama will soon pay his 
first state visit to South Korea to exchange views on the North 
Korean nuclear issue and U.S.-South Korean relations.  Against such 
a background, both North and South Korea will suspect the other side 
is seizing the opportunity to stir up troubles in order to reap 
profits.  North Korea thinks South Korea, in order to stress the 
importance of the U.S.-South Korean alliance, will try to create a 
tense atmosphere in the Korean peninsula to show Obama the necessity 
and urgency of safeguarding the U.S.-South Korean alliance.  South 
Korea thinks North Korea will not hesitate to create military 
skirmishes in order to attract U.S. attention, keep the U.S. from 
ignoring it and gaining more bargaining chips and benefits in the 
North Korea-U.S. bilateral talks."
