pre-license check (PLC) at the residence of Theresa F

subject of export license application D356922. The 
fingerprint equipment (ECCN 1A985) is controlled for

fingerprint equipment in furtherance of an at-home 
forensics course in which she is enrolled.  As part of 
this course, she is required to take fingerprints using 
real equipment (if available) and to submit these 
fingerprints to the instructor. 
 
¶4. Ms. Low provided documentation from the American 
Institute of Applied Sciences, Youngsville, N.C. 
indicating that she is enrolled in a course of study 
titled: Forensics Science Course, Program 101. Ms. Low 
also stated that she is planning to take a follow-on 
course to Program 101 and would need the subject 
fingerprint equipment for that course as well. 
 
¶5. Ms. Low stated that she understands why these 
commodities are controlled.  She further stated that 
she will only use these items in furtherance of her 
course of study and will not resell or otherwise 
transfer them. 
 
¶6. At the time visited, the consignee appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the subject controlled items. 
She cooperated with the visit, allowed for an on-site 
visit and her proposed use of the items is consistent 
with their technical characteristics.  Further, the 
consignee understands her responsibilities under the 
EAR relating to these controlled items. The ECO 
recommends that this PLC be classified as Favorable.
