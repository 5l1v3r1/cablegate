1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Innovative Polymers 
Pte. Ltd., 31 UBi Road 1, No 01-00 Aztech Building, Singapore 
(Innovative Polymers). The item in question is carbon nanotube 
aggregate exported to Innovative Polymers on or about April 6, 2006 
and October 11, 2007.  The item is classified under Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) 1C010 and is controlled for national 
security reasons (NS).  The exporter was Hyperrion Catalysis 
International, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, Innovative 
Polymers was registered in 1996 and its registered share capital is 
the Singapore dollar equivalent of approximately USD 7.25 million. 
Its directors are Singapore citizen, See, Toh Wei-Meng and Singapore 
permanent resident Ng, Bee Keong.  Messrs See and Ng are also the 
shareholders of the company as is Singapore permanent resident Lee, 
Sue Lin. 
 
¶4.  A review of the company's web site (www.Innovativepolymers.com) 
reveals that the company specializes in distribution of engineering 
plastics serving the hard disk drive and semi-conductor industries. 
Its also manufactures customized engineering plastics.  The web site 
lists a wide range of products for which Innovative Polymers is a 
distributor. 
 
¶5.  On April 22, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs, visited the company and met with Mr. Tan, Thiam 
Hock, Marketing Manager and Mr. Ng, Bee Keong, Managing Director. 
Mr. Ng provided an overview of the company.  As noted on the web 
site, the company's target customers are hard disk manufacturers and 
semicon companies.  Its products are used in industrial 
applications.  Innovative Products sells finished and semi-finished 
products to an existing network of customers, not on the open 
market. 
 
¶6.  As to the particular item in question, Mr. Ng stated that the 
company is interested in the item for use in applications where 
static electricity is a concern.  He stated that the nanotube 
product is quite expensive so, for the moment, it is only being used 
for research and development purposes. Hyperion is a regular 
supplier of this product and it applies for BIS licenses based on 
projections of annual need provided by Innovative Polymers. Mr. Ng 
confirmed that the company is aware of the applicable license 
conditions.  ECO inspected the remaining product, much of which 
remained in its original packaging. 
 
¶7.  At the time visited, Innovative Polymers appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the commodities shipped since Innovative 
Polymers cooperated with the PSV, provided ECO with access to the 
item and related documents and operates a line of business 
consistent with the use of the items.  Also, Innovative Polymers is 
familiar with the applicable license conditions and expressed its 
commitment to comply with them.
