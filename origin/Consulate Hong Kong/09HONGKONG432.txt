SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATION AT U.S. CONSULATE GENERAL HONG KONG 
 
¶1. On Monday, 09 March, at approximately 1115 hours, a demonstration 
involving about 25 people was held at the U.S. Consulate General in 
Hong Kong.  The protesters identified themselves as members of "The 
Diaoyu Islands Movement," and included Hong Kong Legislative 
Counselor LEUNG Kwok Hung "Long Hair."  When the Hong Kong Police 
Force(HKPF)tried to corral the group in the designated protest area 
behind the Consulate General, the protesters began pushing and 
shoving the police and eventually forced their way to the sidewalk 
in front of the Consular Section entrance.  The protesters remained 
at that location for approximately 15 minutes.  As a precaution, 
both compound access control (CAC) points in the front of the 
Consulate General were locked down and employees were not permitted 
to exit the front of the compound until the protesters disbursed. 
 
¶2.  During the protest, the demonstrators expressed their 
displeasure at the US/Japan Joint Security Treaty, specifically the 
recent reported statement by a Japanese government official that the 
U.S. pledge to defend Japan applies to the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands 
as well. The protesters carried banners and chanted slogans 
denouncing Japan and the United States.  Due to the agitated mood of 
the protesters, and their refusal to move to the designated protest 
area, the HKPF recommended against someone from the Consulate 
General accepting a petition from the group.   Before departing, 
they burned the petition that they had intended to present to the 
U.S. Consulate General. Asia TV (ATV) daytime news covered the story 
in a 30 second report with video clips of the demonstration. 
 
¶3. The Hong Kong Police advised the U.S. Consulate General of the 
planned demonstration only one hour in advance.  A sufficient number 
of local guards, RSO personnel, and Hong Kong Police were on hand to 
monitor the demonstrators.  The protest concluded peacefully after 
approximately 20 minutes.  There were no injuries or damage to U.S. 
government property.
