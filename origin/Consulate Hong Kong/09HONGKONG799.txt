SUBJECT: MGSF01: HONG KONG H1N1 UPDATE (4/30), NO CONFIRMED 
CASES, TWO IN ISOLATION 
 
REF: HONG KONG 0785 
 
¶1. (SBU) Hong Kong's pandemic flu alert level remained 
unchanged April 30, at "Serious," despite the WHO's decision 
to increase its Pandemic Alert phase from 4 to 5 on April 29. 
Secretary for Health York Chow did, however, announce April 
30 that the HKG would "immediately" go to its highest level 
"Emergency" if the WHO went to phase six or if there were one 
confirmed H1N1 case in Hong Kong.  No confirmed cases have 
been reported here, though two of seven screened individuals 
meeting symptom reporting criteria (symptomatic with recent 
travel to a confirmed H1N1 country or province) remain in 
isolation pending test results (REFTEL).  Information on H1N1 
is widely reported in Hong Kong media as it becomes available 
and many commercial and public buildings have voluntarily 
instituted stepped-up disinfectant protocols. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In light of the heightened H1N1 alert, Post's 
Pandemic Influenza Working Group convened for the second time 
this week on April 30 and carefully reviewed Department and 
internal tripwires, discussing in detail possible actions. 
The group agreed Post has not crossed tripwire 2, but is 
nevertheless taking the following actions, deemed prudent: 
- All recall rosters and section telephone trees are being 
reviewed for accuracy and being redistributed to staff. 
- Health Unit staff are visiting each section in each of 
Post's four facilities to review disinfection and virus 
safety protocols with staff. 
- Post's char force has been instructed to begin heightened 
routine bio-protection cleaning protocols; procedures for 
assisting visitors who appear ill are being reviewed with 
both Post's guard force and staff.
