¶1. Summary:  The Hang Seng bounced back by 3.3 percent in response 
to the coordinated action by major central banks.  Hong Kong 
Financial Secretary John Tseng warned, however, that the financial 
crisis had yet to hit Hong Kong.  Despite central bank easing, 
interbank liquidity in Hong Kong remained tight.  Banks are 
reluctant to approach the HKMA Discount Window for fear of looking 
weak.  Higher rates are likely to affect property sales, which are 
already sliding.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The Hang Seng Index rebounded 3.3 percent on October 9, gaining 
511.51 points to close at 15,943.24, but failed to regain the 16,000 
bench mark. Analysts credited the coordinated actions of major 
central banks around the world to lower interest rates.  Total 
volume was HKD 61 billion, down HKD 17 billion from yesterday. 
 
FS Tsang Predicts the Worst is Yet to Come 
 
¶3.  In response to the coordinated move by the U.S. Federal Reserve, 
the EU Central Bank, the Bank of England and central banks in 
Canada, Switzerland and Sweden to cut interest rates on Wednesday, 
Financial Secretary John Tsang called upon the Hong Kong people to 
unite to confront the financial turmoil, which he said has yet to 
truly arrive in Hong Kong. 
 
¶4. (Comment: Given the collapse of the Hang Seng Index over the past 
several weeks, increasingly tightening interbank credit, the run on 
the Bank of East Asia, and the sharp public controversy over Lehman 
minibonds, Tsang's remarks lead us to question what he expects 
financial turmoil will look like when it arrives.  End Comment.) 
 
¶5.  HKMA Chief Executive Joseph Yam told the press the U.S. Federal 
Reserve's rate cut would not immediately affect global financial 
markets, as the value of financial assets are no longer sensitive to 
changes in interest rates.  Yam noted that in the current situation, 
lower interest rates are unlikely to be sufficient to spur investors 
to purchase financial assets. 
 
Interbank Rates Remain High, Banks Fear to Look Weak 
 
¶6.  Interbank liquidity in Hong Kong remained tight, despite the 
Hong Kong Monetary Authority's move to reduce its Base Rate from 2.5 
percent to 2.0 percent.  The HKMA move followed the U.S. Federal 
Reserve's 50 basis point cut on Wednesday, October 8.  HIBOR quoted 
by Hang Seng Bank at 5:03 pm was 1.75 percent for overnight, down 
from 2.5 percent on Wednesday; but other rates moved sharply during 
the Thursday business day.  1W rates at close of business increased 
to 4.25 percent from 4.0 percent at mid-day, 2W jumped to 4.75 
percent from 4.4 percent, 1M went to 5.3 percent from 4.95 percent, 
and 3M rates increased to 4.5 percent from 4.4 percent. 
 
¶7.  As HIBOR remained high, large commercial banks in Hong Kong, 
including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, Bank of China Hong Kong, and 
Standard Chartered Bank, did not lower their prime borrowing rates. 
HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Bank of China Hong Kong announced this 
afternoon that their prime rates would remain unchanged at 5.25 
percent; Standard Chartered prime rates remained 5.50 percent. 
 
¶8.  ICBC Asia Director Stanley Wong explained that bankers in Hong 
Kong are reluctant to borrow money from HKMA through the Discount 
Window, in spite of lower longer-term rates, for fear of appearing 
to be in need of capital.  In the current market, driven by rumor 
and innuendo, approaching the HKMA could damage a bank's credibility 
and result in a loss of public confidence. 
 
Property Market Poised to Slip Further 
 
¶9.  Wong added that the commercial bankers will find it difficult to 
finance mortgage loans if one to three month HIBOR remains above 4 
percent.  Commercial banks in Hong Kong calculate interest rates on 
mortgage loans as prime rate minus 2.25 or 2.50 percent.  Current 
mortgage rates in Hong Kong range from 3.00-3.25 percent.  If HIBOR 
remains at these levels, banks will be forced to increase mortgage 
rates in an already sliding property market.
