REF: A) USDOC 03924 B) D375208 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export 
Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a 
pre-license check (PLC) at Starlite Printers Ltd., 
31 Tai Yau St, 3/F, Kowloon, Hong Kong (Starlite 
Printers). The purpose of the visit was to 
determine the suitability of Starlite Printers to 
be a recipient of two non-metallic, double 
diaphragm pumps that are the subject of license 
application D375208.  The items (ECCN 2B350) are 
valued at USD 1094 and are controlled for chemical 
and biological weapons reasons (CB). The license 
applicant is Ingersoll-Rand Company of Woodcliff 
Lake, New Jersey. 
 
¶3.  A review of Hong Kong Companies Registry 
records reveals that Starlite Printers has been in 
existence since 1980.  Its paid-in capital is the 
Hong Kong equivalent of USD 600,000.  Hong Kong 
identity card holders Kwong Yu Lam and Chui Yeung 
are directors. 
 
¶4. On May 21, 2007, the ECO visited Starlite 
Printers at the address above and met with Ms. 
Pauline Chan, Assistant Manager of the Materials 
Department.  Ms. Chan stated that Starlite 
Printers is a multinational printing company with 
its headquarters in Hong Kong and production 
facilities in Singapore and mainland China 
(www.hkstarlite.com).  The parent company and 
corporate headquarters are located in Hong Kong. 
Ms. Chan stated that approximately 100 employees 
work at the Hong Kong offices and they are 
responsible for a range of management, design, 
procurement and shipping matters on behalf of the 
Starlite group. 
 
¶5.  According to Ms. Chan, the pumps will be used 
in Starlite Printers's Shenzhen facility.  Ms. 
Chan did not appear to be expert in the exact use 
of the pumps but documentation she provided 
indicated that the pumps would be used as part of 
a printing process utilizing water based varnish. 
She further stated that the pumps would be spares 
to ensure that the existing machine remains in 
operation in the event of pump failure in the 
existing machine(s). 
 
¶6.  Ms. Chan provided the ECO with all relevant 
documentation in respect of the order.  She was 
well versed in Hong Kong TID trade controls and 
understood that the pumps are controlled and 
subject to U.S. export licensing requirements. 
ECO took the occasion to inform Ms. Chan of BIS 
reexport controls and provided her with BIS 
outreach documentation on reexport controls. 
 
¶7. At the time visited, Starlite Printers appeared 
to be a suitable recipient of the subject 
controlled items since it cooperated fully with 
the PLC and provided information on the proposed 
use of the items.  In addition, Starlite Printers 
operates a line a business that is consistent with 
the potential use of the ordered items.  However, 
ECO notes that he was not able to view the 
production facility where the item will be used as 
it is in mainland China. The ECO recommends that 
this PLC be classified as Favorable.
