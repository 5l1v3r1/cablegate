controlled for missile technology (MT) reasons. The license

Leung Kong Wing, Anderson, Operation Manager, Electronics Division. 
Mr. Leung provided background on the company and its operations in 
Hong Kong.  He stated that EGS in Hong Kong had, for example, 
provided significant survey work in support of the construction of 
the Hong Kong international airport as well as the construction of 
bridges in Hong Kong.  Typically, the company is a subcontractor for 
larger HK government contractors.  Mr. Leung stated that his company 
is unable to operate in Mainland China because of China's limitation 
on the use of foreign (non-mainland) service providers in this 
field. 
 
¶6.  As to the specific item that is the subject of license 
application D423559, Mr. Leung stated that it would be used to 
upgrade existing equipment used for seabed mapping.  Mr. Leung 
stated that the item would be used on a EGS vessel and would not be 
provided to third parties (whether independently or as part of the 
vessel).

a suitable recipient of controlled U.S. origin technology.
