Begin Text. 
 
Dear Mr. Engle 
 
Thank you for your letter of 2 October 2006, which was 
conveyed to us by your colleagues at the U.S. Consulate 
General at a meeting on 12 October 2006. 
 
We have taken note of your interest in seeking the further 
liberalization of the current Hong Kong/U.S. bilateral air 
services arrangement.  If I may observe as someone who is 
new to the scene, the current arrangement is already one of 
the most liberal bilateral arrangements that Hong Kong has 
reached with its aviation partners.  In considering further 
room for development, we will look at the commercial 
opportunities that the arrangement is providing to the 
airlines of the two sides, and, ensure that it does so on a 
fair and equitable basis. 
 
In view of your interest and given the time that has lapsed 
since the discussions between our predecessors in 2005 over 
the proposals to further liberalize the Hong Kong / U.S. 
air services arrangement, which are obviously out of date 
by now, we will proceed to consult our airlines on their 
latest views regarding the existing arrangement and 
ascertain their requests.  That process will take some time 
and we will get back to you once we are ready.  In the 
meantime, if you have any specific proposal to make after 
your fresh examination of the U.S.Q position, please do not 
hesitate to let us know. 
 
With Warmest Regards, 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Michael Wong
