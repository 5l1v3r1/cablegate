1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Benchmark 
Electronics Manufacturing Singapore Pte. Ltd., 2 Woodlands Sector 1, 
NO. 01-21, Woodlands Spectrum, Singapore (Benchmark).  This company is 
the successor to the former Pemstar Singapore Pte. Ltd. referenced 
in reftel A.  The item in question is a single channel noncontact 
measuring system exported on or about May 30, 2006 and valued at USD 
3,714.  The item is classified under Export Control Classification 
Number (ECCN) 2B006 and controlled for national security (NS) and 
nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons.  The exporter was Lion 
Precision of St. Paul, Minnesota. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, Benchmark has 
been in existence since 1998 (although its name was changed to 
Benchmark Electronics Manufacturing Singapore Pte. Ltd. as of March 
23, 2007).  Its paid-up share capital is the Singapore equivalent of 
USD 600,000.  U.S. nationals Cary Tze Fu and Gayla Joyce Delly as 
well as Singapore nationals, Ong Teik Lin and Lun Chee Leong are 
listed as directors.  The sole shareholder is listed as Benchmark 
Electronics Manufacturing, Inc. of Rochester, Minnesota. 
 
¶4.  On June 20, 2007, the ECO visited the company and met with Mr. 
Poh Cheng Chuan, Materials Director and Mr. Eric Ee, Senior 
Engineer, Mechanical.  Mr. Poh Cheng Chuan stated that the company 
designs and manufactures semiconductor equipment including data 
storage equipment.  Its customers include Sun Micro. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Poh Cheng Chuan showed the ECO the applicable item (with 
serial number 0602 7601).  He stated that it is being used for 
measuring the motion of air bearing spindles as part of the 
company's design of multi-disk writers.  Mr. Poh Cheng Chuan stated 
that Benchmark's supplier, Scigate Automation Pte, had not informed 
Benchmark of the applicable license conditions. He further stated 
that Scigate is not a regular supplier for Benchmark.  ECO provided 
Benchmark with the applicable license conditions as well as 
additional information on U.S. export/reexport controls. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Benchmark appeared to be a suitable 
recipient of the commodities shipped since Benchmark cooperated with 
the PSV, provided ECO with access to the item and operates a line of 
business consistent with the item's use.  However, in light of the 
fact that Benchmark had not been informed of the applicable license 
conditions as required by BIS license D353774, the ECO recommends 
that this PSV be classified as Unfavorable.
