¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the 
USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), 
Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), 
conducted a pre-license check at Neil Pryde 
Limited, 10/F YKK Building - Phase 2, No.2 San Lik 
Street, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong (Neil Pryde). The 
purpose of the visit was to determine the 
suitability of Neil Pryde to be a recipient of 
1000 sheets of TFF-CN6, an AS4 carbon fiber 
reinforced prepreg that are the subject to export 
license application D360750.  The items (ECCN 
1C010) are valued at USD $32,500 and are 
controlled for national security (NS) and nuclear 
nonproliferation (NP) reasons. The license 
applicant is Hexcel Corporation, 7200 West South 
Gate, Building 8185, Salt Lake City, UT (Hexcel). 
 
¶3. On August 25, 2006, the ECO visited Neil Pryde 
at the address above and met with Mark Elkington, 
Division Manager, Hard Goods Division of 
Performance Manufacturing (the manufacturing 
division of Prydegroup - www.pryde-group.com). 
Neil Pryde is a well-known sporting goods 
manufacturer and brand manager founded in New 
Zealand some 40 years ago.  The corporate 
headquarters are now based in Hong Kong although 
production for various Neil Pryde brands occurs in 
several locations in China and Thailand.  The 
company's various brands (Flow, DXL, JP Australia, 
Neil Pryde and Cabrina) are focused on a range of 
sports including snowboarding, windsurfing, kite 
surfing and others. 
 
¶4.  The items in question (sheets of carbon fiber 
prepregnated with resin) would be used in the 
production of snowboarding helmets.  The carbon 
fiber sheets lend stiffness and support to the 
helmet with less weight and space than traditional 
plastic molded helmets.  Neil Pryde uses European 
sources of carbon fiber sheets for current 
production of the helmets but would like to 
broaden its base of suppliers to include Hexcel 
(www.hexcel.com). 
 
¶5. The actual production of the helmets is set to 
occur in mainland China.  Neil Pryde does not 
produce the helmets in Hong Kong meaning that all 
of the items that are the subject of the license 
would be shipped to China for incorporation into 
helmets for eventual export from China to various 
markets around the world. 
 
¶6. Elkington noted that Neil Pryde's production 
licenses do not allow them to sell any of their 
production in China.  He further stated that 
Chinese customs rules are very strict and that all 
imports of raw materials into China must be 
reflected in corresponding exports of finished 
goods from China. 
 
¶7. Neil Pryde appears to be a suitable recipient 
of the subject controlled items since it 
cooperated with the PLC and provided information 
reflecting appropriate controls over the items. 
In addition, the consignee operates a line a 
business that is consistent with the potential use 
of the items ordered.  The ECO recommends that 
this PLC be classified as Favorable.
