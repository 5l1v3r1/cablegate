¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), conducted a pre-license 
check at Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Limited 
(HAECO), 80 South Perimeter Road, Hong Kong 
International Airport, Lantau Island, Hong Kong (more 
information at www.haeco.com).  The purpose of the 
visit was to determine the suitability of HAECO to be 
the recipient of a Honeywell inertial reference unit 
that is the subject of export license application 
D366543.  The item (ECCN 7A103) is valued at USD 
$78,000 and is controlled for missile technology 
reasons (MT). The license applicant is General 
Electric, acting through the Memphis Group of Memphis, 
TN, a major supplier of used and surplus avionics 
equipment (www.memphisgrp.com). 
 
¶3.  HAECO is a longstanding Hong Kong company providing 
comprehensive aeronautical engineering services to 
airlines/operators since 1950 and was the subject of a 
favorable check referenced in reftel C.  Related 
company, Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Limited 
(HAESL), was the subject of a separate favorable check 
referenced in reftel D.  Other related companies 
provide additional aircraft overhaul and support 
services in Hong Kong and mainland China. 
 
¶4.  On November 29, 2006, the ECO visited HAECO at the 
address above and met with Simon Leung, Project 
Manager.  He stated that HAECO needed the item to 
service Boeing aircraft operated by start-up airline 
"Oasis Airlines" pursuant to HAECO's asset management 
agreement with that company.  The item will be held as 
a spare for two Boeing 747-400 aircraft presently being 
used by Oasis (Hong Kong registration numbers B-LFA, B- 
LFB and MSN numbers 24063 and 24065).  Oasis is 
acquiring two additional aircraft (Hong Kong 
registration numbers: B-LFC and B-LFD) for which HAECO 
may need an additional inertial reference unit in the 
future. 
 
¶5.  Leung stated that the item would be dedicated to 
Oasis planes and would be well secured.  Mr. Leung was 
quite familiar with the controlled nature of the item 
and the need to comply with U.S. and Hong Kong laws 
applicable to the item. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, HAECO appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the subject controlled item since 
it cooperated fully with the PLC and provided 
substantial information on HAECO's proposed use of the 
item in Hong Kong.  In addition, HAECO operates a line 
a business that is consistent with the potential use of 
the ordered item.  The ECO recommends that this PLC be 
classified as Favorable.
