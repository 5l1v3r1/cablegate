¶1. (SBU) Hong Kong's Health Secretary York Chow briefed Hong 
Kong's Consular Corps members in a special meeting late May 4 
to address concerns arising from the government's decision to 
quarantine approximately 240 foreign nationals (including 9 
AMCITS) in Hong Kong, after a Mexican national in Hong Kong 
tested positive for H1N1.  An unspecified number of Hong Kong 
residents are also under quarantine.  Chow said that no 
individuals under quarantine had developed flu symptoms and 
all those linked to the positive H1N1 Mexican case will be 
released on May 8 at 20:30.  Chow noted that intensified 
screening procedures now in use include inbound flight crew 
assistance in specifically identifying to health officials 
for special screening any passengers who show any sign of 
illness before they deplane.  The HKG has also slightly 
intensified scrutiny/questioning of anyone with a North 
American passport.  In response to repeated concerns by the 
approximately 75 Consular Corps representatives attending, 
Chow stated that the HKG will cover the transportation and 
lodging costs associated with the quarantine and is actively 
working to address complaints and otherwise assist travelers 
inconvenienced by the quarantine. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Mexican Consulate General for Hong Kong and 
Macau sent out an electronic message through their Consular 
Warden system to all Mexican nationals residing in Hong Kong 
informing them that a special aircraft will arrive in Hong 
Kong on May 5, 15:00 to assist them in returning to Mexico. 
Mexican nationals desiring such assistance were asked to 
immediately contact the Mexican Consulate General for 
additional details. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post has identified and is in contact with nine 
AMCITS currently under quarantine for proximity contact with 
the identified H1N1 contact in Hong Kong.  Seven of the 
AMCITS were guest at the Metropark Hotel in Hong Kong's 
Wanchai District and are thus under quarantine there and two 
are at the Lady MacLehose Holiday Camp.  All are reported to 
be in good heath and spirits and are in contact with the 
Consular Section.
