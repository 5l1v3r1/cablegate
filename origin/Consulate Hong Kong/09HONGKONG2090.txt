¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), attempted 
to conduct a pre-license check at High Tech International Holdings 
Limited, Tower A, New Trade Plaza, 6 On Ping Street, Shatin, Hong 
Kong (High Tech). The purpose of the visit was to determine the 
suitability of High Tech to be the ultimate consignee and end user 
of a Tracklink 5000MA USBL tracking system that is the subject of 
license application D425476.  The item (ECCN 6A001) is controlled 
for national security (NS) reasons. The license applicant is 
Linkquest Inc., of San Diego, California. 
 
¶3.  A search of the Hong Kong Companies Registry reveals that High 
Tech has been in existence since 2006. Its registered capital is the 
Hong Kong equivalent of USD 1.  Its sole director is listed as Ng, 
Ching Yu (with Hong Kong Identification number G482478(3).  Internet 
research reveals that High Tech's address also appears to be the 
address of a range Russian companies with offices in Hong Kong 
including Advonics (www.advonicsgroup.com) which is a supplier of 
electronic components with offices in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and 
Saint-Petersburg.  ECO does not believe that High Tech maintains a 
physical office in Hong Kong. 
 
¶4. High Tech does not appear to have a web site.  Correspondence 
with the representative of High Tech (namely Mr. Alik Nemchinov) was 
received from a gmail account. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Nemchinov stated in his e-mail correspondence that he works 
for High Tech as its regional manager and will not be in Hong Kong 
for some time.  He further stated that the item would be used by the 
Russian Far Eastern National University (consistent with the 
information in the underlying license application).  When ECO 
requested an in-person meeting in Hong Kong with the director of the 
company, namely Ng, Ching Yu (the signatory on the end-user 
statement supporting the license application), Mr. Nemchikov 
responded that this was his company's first experience receiving so 
many questions about what he described as a absolutely normal deal. 
He then stated that he believed that High Tech should not proceed 
with the transaction and would inform the client of this fact.  On 
November 13, 2009, Mr. Nemchikov informed ECO that he had spoken 
with the client and they had decided to cancel this order. 
 
¶6.  Based on the information detailed herein, ECO does not believe 
High Tech to be a suitable recipient of controlled U.S. origin 
technology.
