SUBJECT: BRIEFING THE HUNGARIANS ON U.S. DESIRED OUTCOMES 
FROM THE LONDON CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 06355 
 
¶1.  (SBU) POL/ECON Counselor briefed Peter Sztaray, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Director for Security Policy and 
Non-Proliferation, January 25 on desired U.S. outcomes from 
the January 28 London Conference on Afghanistan.  Sztaray, 
who is accompanying Foreign Minister Balazs to the conference 
and the subsequent NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in 
Istanbul, welcomed the London conference as a practical means 
to enhance international coordination on Afghanistan, noting 
that it would "bring together all the players."  Hungarian 
objectives coincided with those of the United States in terms 
of outcomes from the conference, Sztaray said. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On specific points, Sztaray agreed that while 
reintegration of insurgents was very complex, it had to be 
pursued.  "Without this, there is no solution," he stated. 
The U.S. plan of step-by-step, gradual transition of 
provinces to an Afghan lead represented the right approach, 
Sztaray said, adding, "The better the preparations, the 
better the result." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sztaray said the Hungarians hoped they would have 
the opportunity to take the floor at the conference. While 
understanding that with 77 delegations this might not prove 
feasible, Sztaray said that, having furnished Provincial 
Reconstruction and Operational Mentor and Liaison teams, 
Hungary believed it had something to contribute.
