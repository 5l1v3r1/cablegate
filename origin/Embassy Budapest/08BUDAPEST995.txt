REF: SECSTATE 105173 
 
(SBU) MFA Security and Non-proliferation Department Head 
Vilmos Hamikus discussed reftel with PolOff October 9. 
Hamikus stated that Hungary was in full agreement with the 
U.S. on this issue.  Commenting that the UNSCR 1835 in 
substance "was a piece of nothing" but politically timely 
since both Russia and China supported the measure, Hamikus 
stated "it was time to do something in the EU."  Having 
recently returned from London where he had talks on the issue 
with Foreign and Commonwealth Office counterparts, Hamikus 
stated further EU financial sanctions were ready two months 
ago, and Hungary is on board to press for tougher sanctions 
at the upcoming GAERC, October 13.
