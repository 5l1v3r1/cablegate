SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON AGREEMENT TA 0019-07B 
 
REF: BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on technical assistant agreement 
amendment TA 0019-07B for the transfer of technical data, 
hardware, and defense services necessary for intermediate 
maintenance and sustainment of the Iraqi Air Force's fleet of 
existing Mi-17 helicopters.  Post is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of response to 
a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future 
applications involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: PM/DTCC and the Defense Technology 
Security Administration have been unable to verify the 
existence of foreign licensee Rainbow Aircraft Parts 
International in Jordan.  Post should make appropriate 
inquiries to verify the existence and the bona fides of 
Rainbow Aircraft Parts and confirm the legitimacy of the 
proposed transaction. The following questions are provided as 
suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including a contract with ARINC and/or the Iraqi Air Force, 
for this proposed transaction? 
 
--Will the company be handling or storing the United States 
Munitions List (USML) aircraft parts listed in the agreement? 
 If so, does it have secure facilities and proper accounting 
and security procedures for handling these sensitive USML 
items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals?  How many and what types of employees (program 
managers, service technicians, etc.) does the company have? 
 
--Does the company appear in Jordanian business directories? 
Why does the company not have a website? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what types of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  End action. 
 
¶4. For background, the following details of the license in 
question are provided: 
 
DTC Case: TA 0019-07B 
 
The previously approved agreement (TA 0019-07) and amendment 
(TA 0019-07A) authorized the permanent export of $188,000 
worth of technical data, $7,468,000 worth of defense 
services, and $403,190 worth of defense articles ($15,000,000 
total).  Under the agreement, ARINC is responsible to train, 
assist, and provide hardware to the Iraqi Air Force (IqAF) 
for intermediate maintenance and sustainment of their Mi-17 
helicopter fleet.  Due to miscommunication, Rainbow was not 
listed on the two previous authorizations mentioned above, 
even though Rainbow is the primary contracting party with 
ARINC to provide defense services for the modification of the 
IqAF Mi-17 helicopters.  The Jordanian company listed as a 
party to the agreement on the previous authorizations, Royal 
Wings, is in fact a sublicensee of Rainbow.
