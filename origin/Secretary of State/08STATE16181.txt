SUBJECT: GUIDANCE FOR SECURITY COUNCIL CONSULTATIONS ON 
UNMIS 19 FEBRUARY 2008 
 
 ¶1.  PURPOSE:  This is an action request.  The Department 
asks USUN to draw upon the following themes for the United 
Nations (UN) Security Council briefing and consultations on 
the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) on 19 February 2008. 
 
-We welcome the January 31 report of the Secretary-General on 
progress in implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
(CPA) in Sudan and on the activities of the United Nations 
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS). 
 
-We are pleased with progress in some areas, including the 
return of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement to the 
Government of National Unity.  We also welcome the 
appointment of Sir Derek Plumbly as the new chairperson of 
the Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC), which was 
established to monitor the implementation of the CPA. 
 
-At the same time, however, we remain very concerned about 
continued challenges to the full implementation of the CPA 
and the commitment of all parties to cooperate to this 
effect.  We urge all parties to facilitate the full 
implementation of the CPA. 
 
-Today I would like to focus on seven areas where progress 
must be made. 
 
-First, the Sudanese Armed Forces and Sudan People's 
Liberation Army troops must complete their redeployment away 
from their respective sides of the north-south border. 
 
-Second, the Joint Integrated Units must be properly equipped 
and train together in order to become truly integrated. We 
welcome the creation by UNMIS of a Joint Integrated Unit 
Support Cell as a first step towards more substantial 
progress, and we expect strong engagement by UNMIS in pushing 
for results.  The parties, especially the government, must 
demonstrate a willingness to work together and accept the UN 
Support Cell's role. 
 
-Third, the Abyei question must be resolved and the 
north-south border must be demarcated.  We welcome intensive 
monitoring by UNMIS in the area of Abyei and any further 
facilitation of progress on these issues. 
 
-Fourth, significant progress for the elections must take 
place, including passing of an electoral law and implementing 
a national census.  We continue to be concerned that the 
national census is behind schedule because of delaying 
tactics by both sides.  It must not be delayed yet again 
beyond its current tardy date for implementation in April. 
 
-Fifth, Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) 
of ex-combatants must be promoted.  We welcome UNMIS's effort 
to step up its engagement with the Northern and Southern 
Commissions on DDR and its work with them to prepare a 
framework for UN support for DDR. We look forward to 
implementation of such a framework.  More funding from both 
the Sudanese and international community is needed for real 
progress to be made. 
 
-Sixth, we urge all parties to cooperate fully with the 
Assessment and Evaluation Commission, established to monitor 
CPA implementation, on all matters related with this purpose. 
 
-Finally, all parties must facilitate UNMIS in fulfilling its 
mandate.  We are concerned that UNMIS's movement was 
restricted in October and November and expect that all 
parties allow its full freedom of movement as this is 
essential to the implementation of its mandate. 
 
-We appreciate UNMIS' provision of good offices, monitoring 
in a wide range of important areas, and other support for CPA 
implementation.  However, we welcome any efforts by UNMIS to 
more proactively facilitate the implementation of the CPA. 
We encourage UNMIS to do its utmost, within the limits of its 
mandate, to facilitate the implementation of the CPA.  We 
look forward to the Secretary General's report in April on 
how UNMIS may most effectively support CPA implementation, 
but we believe the current mandate allows for much more 
engagement by UNMIS. 
 
-We also welcome UNMIS's continued efforts to support the 
United Nations - African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) and 
the Joint Mediation Support Team for Darfur.  We see peace in 
Darfur as linked to peace between the north and south in 
Sudan and urge any cooperation towards these ends.

¶2.  POINT OF CONTACT:  Grace M. Kang, IO/PSC, 202-736-7735. 
 
¶3.  BACKGROUND:  The Department remains concerned about 
implementation of the CPA.  A reversion to conflict between 
north and south would have devastating consequences for 
Darfur and Sudan as a whole.  We want to encourage the 
Security Council and members of the international community 
to maintain focus on CPA implementation.
