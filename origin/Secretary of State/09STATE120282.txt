SUBJECT: NUCLEAR FUEL BANKS - SEEKING CO-SPONSORS FOR 
RUSSIAN RESOLUTION ON THE ANGARSK RESERVE 
 
REF: A. 09 STATE 117710 
     ¶B. 09 UNVIE 527 
 
Sensitive but unclassified ) please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an ACTION REQUEST:  Please see para 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  At the November 26-27, 2009 meeting of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of 
Governors, the Board will be asked to formally approve the 
first proposal for an international nuclear fuel bank. 
Specifically, the Board will be asked to vote on a resolution 
from the Russian Federation that would authorize the IAEA 
Director General to enter into the necessary agreements to 
establish a nuclear fuel reserve in Angarsk, Russia.  This 
guaranteed reserve of low-enriched uranium fuel would be used 
in cases of fuel supply disruption. By strengthening the 
international nuclear fuel market, it would remove an 
incentive for states to develop indigenous uranium enrichment 
capacity. The United States supports this initiative as a 
means of expanding access to nuclear power while addressing 
nonproliferation risks (ref A). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Government of Russia has now formally proposed 
a draft resolution that would lead to the establishment of 
the Angarsk reserve (ref B).  We support Russia's resolution 
and plan to co-sponsor it.  This cable seeks co-sponsors of 
this resolution from Board members that Washington believes 
are likely to support the Angarsk reserve. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ACTION REQUESTS: 
 
-- All action addressees with the exception of Moscow are 
requested to transmit to appropriate officials the text of 
the Russian resolution in para 6, on the Angarsk nuclear fuel 
reserve, which will be considered at the November 26 meeting 
of the IAEA Board of Governors.  Posts are requested to 
encourage host governments to co-sponsor this resolution. 
Posts can draw from the talking points in para 5 to introduce 
this resolution. 
 
-- For Moscow only:  Post is requested to inform appropriate 
government officials that the United States has transmitted 
the Angarsk resolution to action addressees and requested 
their co-sponsorship. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
 
-- Last week, we expressed our support for the Angarsk 
nuclear fuel reserve, which will be considered this week by 
the IAEA Board of Governors. 
 
-- The Government of Russia has now formally put forward a 
draft resolution that would authorize the IAEA Director 
General to enter into the necessary agreements to establish 
the Angarsk reserve. 
 
-- The United States plans to co-sponsor this draft 
resolution. 
 
-- We believe that, if co-sponsored by the majority of the 
Board Members, the draft resolution has a good chance of 
being adopted without a vote. 
 
-- We request that (host country) give serious consideration 
to this proposal and instruct its delegation to the November 
Board meeting to become a co-sponsor of the draft resolution. 
 
-- We would ask for your reply not later than the 24th of 
November, 2009. 
 
END TALKING POINTS. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF DRAFT RUSSIAN RESOLUTION: 
 
On the Establishment by the Russian Federation of a Reserve 
of Low Enriched Uranium to the IAEA for Its Member States 
 
The Board of Governors 
 
(a) Recalling the Report by the Director General 
GOV/INF/2007/11 "Possible New Framework for the Utilization 
of Nuclear Energy: Options for Assurance of Supply of Nuclear 
Fuel"; 
 
(b) Recalling the document GOV/INF/2009/1 "Russian Federation 
Initiative to Establish a Reserve of Low Enriched Uranium 
(LEU) to the IAEA for Its Member States", 
 
(c) Recalling the Report by the Director General GOV/2009/31 
"Assurance of Supple - Russian Federation Initiative to 
Establish a Reserve of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) to the IAEA 
for Its Member States"; 
 
(d) Noting the provisions of the Article IX of the IAEA 
Statute allowing Member States to make available to the 
Agency nuclear materials for supply to other Member States; 
 
(e) Noting the discussions which have already taken place in 
the Board on a number of concepts of assurances of supply of 
nuclear fuel, and the importance of developing a range of 
options for such assurances. 
 
Hereby 
 
(1) Welcomes the offer of the Russian Federation to establish 
on its territory a reserve of LEU to the IAEA for its Member 
States. 
 
(2) Authorizes the Director General to conclude and 
subsequently implement the Agreement with the Russian 
Federation to establish a reserve of LEU for supply to the 
IAEA for its Member States, attached as Attachment 1 to 
GOV/2009/76; 
 
(3) Approves the Model Agreement, attached as Attachment 2 to 
GOV/2009/76 as the standard text for agreements that are to 
be concluded with Member States for the supply of LEU by the 
IAEA from the reserve; and 
 
(4) Authorizes the Director General to conclude and 
subsequently implement future Agreements with Member States 
for the supply of LEU by the IAEA when the Director General 
considers that the request of the Member State fulfils the 
eligibility criteria included in the Agreement with the 
Russian Federation, without the requirement for case-by-case 
authorization by the Board and requests the Director General 
to keep the Board informed throughout the entire process. 
 
END DRAFT RESOLUTION.
