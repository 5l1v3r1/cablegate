SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050121146 AND 050098938 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 050121146 and 050098938 for 
the export of gyroscopes to Israel.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: The provisos on these licenses state 
that no depot level maintenance or repairs can be done 
outside the United States.  The provisos also state that the 
gyroscopes cannot be used in Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR) Category I items.  This check is to confirm 
that the foreign consignees and the Israeli Ministry of 
Defense (IMOD) are adhering to these provisos and are using 
the items for the purpose stated on the license. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to confirm with the 
foreign consignees listed below that the gyroscopes on these 
licenses were integrated into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) 
and delivered to the IMOD.  Post is also requested to verify 
with the IMOD that these UAVs were, in fact, received.  In 
addition, Post is requested to inquire about any maintenance 
or repairs that these gyroscopes may have undergone.  The 
following points are included for guidance: 
 
(To Israel Aerospace Industries) 
 
--Did you receive all the gyroscopes listed below?  How were 
they used by your company?  Can you provide documentation 
regarding the final disposition of all of these gyroscopes? 
 
--Did you retain any of these gyroscopes?  If so, please 
provide any documentation that describes the ultimate end-use 
of the gyroscopes you have retained. 
 
--Please describe any maintenance or repairs that these 
gyroscopes may have undergone, including details about what 
maintenance/repairs were performed, where they were conducted 
and by whom. 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To Silver Arrow) 
 
--When was your company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What products and services does your company provide?  Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--Did you receive all the gyroscopes listed below?  How were 
they used by your company?  Can you provide documentation 
regarding the final disposition of all of these gyroscopes?

provide any documentation that describes the ultimate end-use 
of the gyroscopes you have retained. 
 
--Please describe any maintenance or repairs that these 
gyroscopes may have undergone,  including details about what 
maintenance/repairs were performed, where they were conducted 
and by whom. 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To IMOD) 
 
--Can you confirm the order of Heron UAVs from Israel 
Aerospace Industries?  Can you confirm the order of 
HERMES-450 UAVs from Elbit/Silver Arrow?  Do these UAVs 
contain VG700MB-201 and VG34-0803 vertical gyroscopes, 
respectively?  Can you confirm the receipt of all the 
gyroscopes listed below?
