SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050130278 AND 050181912 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 050130278 and 050181912 for 
the export of firearms to New Zealand.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: End-user Outdoor Brands first appeared 
on U.S. export licenses in October 2008 on license 050130278 
for firearms.  Since then, the company has been approved for 
over $2 million in firearms and ammunition exports.  License 
050181912 is the largest to date valued at over $719,000. 
This check is to establish the bona fides of the company and 
its annual sales. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of Outdoor Brands by making inquiries to 
representatives of the company and appropriate local 
authorities.  The following points are included for guidance: 
 
(To Outdoor Brands) 
 
--When was your company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What products and services does your company provide?  Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What are you annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms? 
 
--Do you sell firearms to customers that reside outside New 
Zealand? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To Appropriate Import/Export and/or Law Enforcement 
Authorities) 
 
--Is Outdoor Brands properly authorized to import and sell 
defense articles in New Zealand? 
 
--Do you have any information on Outdoor Brands that would 
question their reliability as a recipient of U.S. defense 
articles? 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
