purchases and illicit exports of firearms from Nicaragua. 
This check is to verify the facts of this reporting and 
establish the bona fides of the Nicaraguan end-user. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request: Post is requested to establish the 
bona fides of end-user Nuevo Impacto by verifying the facts 
reported in the media about straw purchases and illicit 
exports involving the company.  Post is also requested to 
make any necessary inquiries to representatives of the 
company and appropriate authorities of the Government of 
Nicaragua to determine if Nuevo Impacto is a reliable

reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities and end-use.
