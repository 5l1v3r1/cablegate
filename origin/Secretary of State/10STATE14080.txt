SUBJECT: Cancellation of Travel Warning - Syria 
 
¶1.  The Travel Warning issued for Syria on February 12, 
2009, is hereby rescinded.  The Department of State deems 
the security situation in Syria no longer merits a Travel 
Warning. 
 
¶2.  Review of the security situation in Syria is ongoing, 
and the Department can disseminate a new Travel Warning 
as circumstances warrant. 
 
¶3. U.S. citizens living or traveling in Syria are 
encouraged to register with the nearest U.S. embassy or 
consulate at the Department of State's travel 
registration page in order to obtain updated information 
on local travel and security.  U.S. citizens without 
Internet access may register directly with the nearest 
U.S. embassy or consulate.  Registration is important; it 
allows the State Department to assist U.S. citizens in an 
emergency. 
 
¶4. The U.S. Embassy in Damascus can be reached at 963-11- 
3391-4444, including for after-hours emergenices; the fax 
number is 963-11-3391-3999.  The Embassy's web site, 
which includes consular information and the most recent 
messages to the American community in Damascus, is at 
http://damascus.usembassy.gov. 
 
¶5. For the latest security information, Americans living 
and traveling abroad should regularly monitor the 
Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs Internet 
website at http://travel.state.gov, where the current 
Worldwide Caution, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts as well 
as the Country Specific Information for Syria can be 
found. Up-to-date information on security can also be 
obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the 
United States and Canada or, for callers outside the 
United States and Canada, a regular toll line at 1-202- 
501-4444.  These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 
8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except 
U.S. federal holidays). 
 
¶6.  Minimize considered.
