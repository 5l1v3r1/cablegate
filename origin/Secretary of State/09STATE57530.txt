¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050016624 for the export of 
firearms to Mexico.  Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of response to a Blue

in Panindicuaro, Michoacan (serial number L428091).  The 
firearms on this license were destined for ultimate end-use 
by the Secretarias de Seguriada Publica in Baja, Chihuahua, 
and Michoacan.  Several other firearms recovered in illicit

to which the foreign intermediate consignees in this case,
