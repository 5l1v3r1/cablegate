TAGS: ETTC KOMC CS
SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-SHIPMENT/POST-LICENSE 
END-USE CHECK ON LICENSE 050193600 
 
REF: 06 SAN JOSE 1569 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-shipment/post-license check on license 050193600 for 
the export of pistols to Costa Rica.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request:  A previous Blue Lantern indicated 
that foreign consignee Koruma Lenex was selling large 
quantities of firearms to Costa Rican company Armeria Rex 
(REFTEL).  Armeria Rex is suspected of diverting firearms to 
entities outside Costa Rica.  This request is for Post to 
establish the bona fides of this transaction. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of this transaction by confirming the order with the 
Public Security Minister.  Post is also requested to provide 
any recent derogatory information on Koruma Lenex that Post 
or relevant host government agencies may have received.  In 
its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities and end-use.
