SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 05-050097262 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 05-050097262 for 
the export of Rafael aircraft engine spare parts and related 
technical data to France.  Embassy is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to 
a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar foreign intermediate 
consignees, Defontaine SA and Transports Hervouet Sari. 
 
¶4. ACTION: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate French Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials to 
determine if it has received the engine spare parts and that 
the articles are being used for the purpose stated on the 
license.  Department requests that Embassy either contact or 
conduct site visits (if this is geographically/financially 
feasible) to Defontaine SA (POC: Gaelle Couve, Tel#: 33(0)2 
40 67 89 73, Email: Gaelle-Couve@defontaine.com) and 
Transports Hervouet Sari in order to assess their business 
operations, on-site security, and general reliability as 
recipients of United States Munitions List (USML) items.  The 
following questions are offered as suggested guidance with 
Defontaine SA and Transports Hervouet Sari: 
 
- Can the company provide documentation from the French MOD 
(e.g. purchase order, contract, or letter of intent) 
establishing it as the final end user of these items? 
 
- Does the company keep proper, detailed records of its sales 
and customers? 
 
- Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-export and retransfer? 
 
- What is the company's exact role in these transactions? 
 
- Who are the company's main clients? 
 
If a site visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case 
officer. 
 
End Action.
