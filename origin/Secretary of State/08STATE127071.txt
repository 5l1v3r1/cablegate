¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) OBJECTIVE:  To inform our outreach partners in 
Australia, Canada, Japan, and South Korea that they will soon 
be contacted by the Government of Italy to participate in a 
meeting in Rome on 12 December 2008 to discuss the 
implementation of national measures on Iran. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) BACKGROUND: Since July 2008, the United States has 
been engaged with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 
an effort to prompt the implementation of the strongest 
possible national sanctions measures on Iran in response to 
its noncompliance with its international obligations.  Our 
goal has been two-fold: 1) to assemble a "menu of options" 
for national measures that could be pursued by likeminded 
states; and, 2) to use these options to prompt other states 
to take similar action to create the greatest possible 
pressure on Iran.  Italy joined the group in October 2008. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) BACKGROUND CONT: Our efforts have centered on 
developing a "menu of options" for such measures, focused on 
four key areas: Iran's access to the international financial 
system, insurance/re-insurance services, oil/gas investment 
(both financial and technological), and sensitive/dual-use 
items.  In the financial sector, we are seeking to limit 
Iran,s access to the international financial system both 
through implementation of relevant provisions in UN Security 
Council Resolutions 1737, 1747, and 1803 and through national 
measures that are complementary to the UN framework by 
calling on certain states to issue advisories consistent with 
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) warning statements 
regarding Iran,s risk to the international financial system. 
  Regarding the insurance industry, the national measures 
strategy seeks to limit Iran,s access to insurance and 
re-insurance due to the risk that the Iranian regime has used 
its state-owned firms to support proliferation-related 
activity. With respect to energy, we are seeking to prevent 
new investment and oil and gas deals with Iran and investment 
that contribute to Iran,s ability to develop its energy 
sector. We are also looking to prevent the transfer of 
dual-use items to Iran by preventing Iran,s ability to 
procure sensitive technology and equipment that might aid its 
nuclear program. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Using the background in paragraphs 
3-4, Posts are requested to inform appropriate host 
government officials that France, Germany, The United 
Kingdom, and Italy intend to invite their representatives to 
attend a meeting in Rome on 12 December to discuss our 
ongoing effort to develop a "menu of options" for national 
measures to increase the pressure on Iran.  Posts should note 
that a detailed agenda and invitation will be forthcoming 
from the Government of Italy.  Posts should emphasize that we 
believe that national measures will be particularly helpful 
to ensure that UN Security Council sanctions are fully 
implemented and the pressure on Iran continues, in a 
coordinated and robust manner.  These actions will help 
support our diplomatic work to persuade Iran to suspend its 
enrichment related activities and enter into negotiation with 
the P5 1.  Posts should describe, generally, the areas of 
activity that are being pursued, but stress that the meeting 
on 12 December is intended to brief meeting participants on 
the overall effort, as well as discuss next steps and the 
role they might play in this important effort. 
 
¶6.  (U) Post is requested to report any substantive response 
by 8 December 2008.  Richard Nephew (ISN/RA, 202-647-7680, 
NephewRM@state.sgov.gov) and Anthony Ruggiero (ISN/CPI, 
202-647-5181, RuggieroAJ@state.sgov.gov) are the Department's 
POCs for this activity.
