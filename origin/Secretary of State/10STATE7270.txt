SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050129594 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050129594 for the export of 
a FLIR Thermal Imaging System (FLIR) to South Africa.  Post 
is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 
days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect 
pending and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar foreign end-user Combined 
Private Investigations CC (CPI).  The company has not 
appeared on previous licenses nor have its bona fides been 
verified by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION PRETORIA: Post is requested to make inquiries with 
host government officials to establish the bona fides of 
unfamiliar foreign end-user, CPI, and to confirm that end-use 
is as stated on the license application.  PM/DTCC requests 
that post conducts a site visit to CPI in order to provide 
Department with an assessment of its business operations and 
on-site security.  Finally, post is asked to assess whether 
the company appears to be a reliable recipient of USML items. 
 If a site visit is not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC 
officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item? 
 
--What is the nature of the company and when was it 
established?  Who are its principals? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
END ACTION
