SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - LEBANON 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning updates information on security 
threats and ongoing political violence in Lebanon, and 
informs U.S. citizens of current safety and security 
concerns.  The Department of State continues to urge that 
Americans avoid all travel to Lebanon and that American 
citizens in Lebanon consider carefully the risks of 
remaining.  This supersedes the Travel Warning for Lebanon 
issued on May 13, 2008. 
 
¶2.  On May 7, 2008, violence broke out in Lebanese capital 
of Beirut when Hizballah militants blocked the road 
leading to Rafiq Hariri International Airport.  Hizballah 
fighters then pushed into areas of Lebanon where they had 
not traditionally been prevalent, resulting in several 
violent clashes.  While the Airport road has since been 
reopened, it is possible Hizballah militants will use the 
same tactic in the future. 
 
¶3.  The U.S. is concerned about Hizballah's use of 
violence to achieve political ends, coupled with its anti- 
Western and anti-American rhetoric.  The threat of 
terrorist attacks against Western interests in Lebanon is 
real.  In addition to Hizballah, groups such as Al-Qaeda 
and Jund al-Sham are present in the country and have 
issued statements calling for attacks against Western 
interests in the past. 
 
¶4.  Currently the American Embassy urges American citizens 
not to travel to Lebanon; those already in Lebanon are 
urged to consider carefully the risks of remaining in 
Lebanon and review their travel plans now that air travel 
services have resumed.  U.S. citizens who plan to remain 
in Lebanon despite this warning are advised to maintain 
adequate supplies of food, water and other essential items 
and minimize travel outside of their homes. 
 
¶5.  U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon or resident in 
Lebanon should be aware that the U.S. Embassy has limited 
ability to reach all areas of Lebanon.  The Embassy cannot 
guarantee that Embassy employees can render assistance to 
U.S. citizens in areas where there is limited government 
control. 
 
¶6.  Landmines and unexploded ordnance continually pose 
significant dangers throughout southern Lebanon, 
particularly south of the Litani River, as well as in 
areas of the country where civil war fighting was intense. 
More than a dozen civilians have been killed and over 100 
injured by unexploded ordnance following the armed 
conflict in July-August 2006.  Travelers should watch for 
posted landmine warnings and strictly avoid all areas 
where landmines and unexploded ordnance may be present. 
 
¶7.  United States citizens are responsible for arranging 
commercial or private means of transportation to depart 
Lebanon. For Americans, individual or small-group travel 
out of the country remains the safest option.   U.S. 
Government-facilitated evacuations such as took place in 
2006 occur only when no safe private alternatives exist. 
Evacuation would be provided on a cost-recovery basis, 
which means the traveler must reimburse the U.S. 
government for the cost of the travel.  The lack of valid 
travel documents (U.S. passport or U.S. visa, as 
appropriate) will slow the U.S. Embassy's ability to 
provide assistance.  Further information on the 
department's role during emergencies is provided at 
http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/tips/emerg encies/emerge 
ncies_1212.html. 
 
¶8.  The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. 
government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to 
 
STATE 00053343  002 OF 002 
 
 
require them to live and work under strict security 
restrictions.  These practices limit, and may occasionally 
prevent, access by U.S. Embassy officials to certain areas 
of the country.  Unofficial travel to Lebanon by U.S. 
government employees and their family members requires 
prior approval by the Department of State. 
 
¶9.  The Embassy is located in Awkar, near Antelias, 
Beirut, Lebanon.  Public access hours for American 
citizens are Monday through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 
a.m.; however, American citizens who require emergency 
services outside of these hours may contact the embassy by 
telephone at any time.  The telephone numbers are (961-4) 
542-600, 543-600, and fax 544-209. 
 
¶10.  American citizens may register with the embassy 
online by visiting 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs.  Americans are 
strongly encouraged to update their registration 
information if it is no longer current.  Information on 
consular services and registration can also be found at 
http://lebanon.usembassy.gov or by phone at the above 
telephone numbers between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday 
through Friday local time. 
 
¶11.  Updated information on travel and security in Lebanon 
may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1- 
888-407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, from 
overseas, 1-202-501-4444. Additional details can be found 
in the Department of State's Country Specific Information 
for Lebanon, and the Worldwide Caution, which are 
available on the Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶12.  Minimize considered.
