¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds 
that it possesses no credible information of gross 
violations of human rights at this time by the members of 
the Iraqi Security Forces listed below.  Department 
strongly suggests that visa applications for these 
individuals be filed with as much time as possible to allow 
for additional processing procedures that may be 
required.  Note that if, at any time, the Embassy becomes 
aware of any information regarding incidents which could 
be deemed to be credible information of a gross violation 
of human rights by these individuals, the Embassy should so 
inform the Department.
