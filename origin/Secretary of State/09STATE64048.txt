SUBJECT: LRA: TALKING POINTS FOR SPECIAL ENVOY'S 
CHISSANO'S BRIEFING TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
 
Â¶1.  USUN may draw from the following talking points for the 
June 25 briefing by the Special Envoy for the 
Secretary General to Areas Affected by Lord's Resistance Army 
(LRA): 
 
--  We would like to thank Special Envoy Chissano for his 
briefing today and for his dedication and efforts to end LRA 
operations that have created enormous human misery for so 
many years. We wish him success in his future as he leaves 
this position for endeavors. 
 
-- We are seriously concerned about recent LRA attacks 
against civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
the Central African Republic, and Southern Sudan, which have 
led to the displacement of over 160,000 people to date and 
have created some 18,000 new Congolese refugees in Southern 
Sudan.  As we all know, the LRA has, since December, killed 
well over a thousand people, abducted hundreds (including 
women and children), and destroyed entire villages just in 
the DRC.  We continue to urge the LRA to immediately cease 
all military activities and abductions, and to release all 
persons, particularly children, being held against their 
will. 
 
-- The United States continues to support MONUC, FARDC and 
other regional militaries' efforts to increase civilian 
protection in the region.  Civilian protection must be a part 
of the planning of any military operation. 
 
-- We urge greater coordination between MONUC and UNMIS in 
order to counter the LRA threat to the region and better 
protect local populations, and to ensure adequate 
humanitarian assistance reaches those civilians impacted by 
LRA activity. 
 
Questions for Chissano: 
 
-- What do you think is the best way forward to end the  LRA 
threat to the region once and for all? 
 
-- What is your assessment of the joint FARDC/MONUC operation 
(Rudia II) against the LRA in the DRC? 
 
-- In your opinion, has adequate humanitarian assistance been 
provided to those populations who have been attacked by the 
LRA or otherwise impacted by the current military campaign? 
What more should be done to alleviate the suffering of these 
populations? 
 
-- How can UNMIS, MONUC, and other UN entities better 
coordinate to more effectively protect vulnerable populations?
