SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING: BURUNDI 
 
¶1. The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of 
the risks of travel to Burundi and continues to caution 
Americans that travel outside the capital, Bujumbura, 
presents significant risks, especially after nightfall. 
The U.S. Embassy restricts travel of its personnel in 
Burundi, and certain areas of Bujumbura are off-limits to 
U.S. government personnel after daylight hours.  This 
replaces the Travel Warning for Burundi dated January 8, 
2009, to provide information regarding demobilization of 
rebel forces after the cease-fire agreement between these 
groups and the government, as well as revised information 
on security restrictions for Embassy personnel. 
 
¶2. From 1993 to 2006, Burundi was plagued by a civil war 
that often involved non-governmental and non-combatant 
targets.  In September 2006, the government and the last 
rebel group not yet party to peace accords, the 
PALIPEHUTU?FNL (FNL), signed a cease-fire agreement.  The 
FNL leaders agreed to discontinue hostilities and to 
implement fully the cease-fire agreement.  FNL rebels 
have since begun to demobilize as the group transitions 
into an officially-recognized political party.  However, 
their presence in demobilization camps has been marked by 
several disturbances in the camps and surrounding 
communities. 
 
¶3. Crime and banditry are still prevalent in the province 
of Bujumbura Rural despite the general demobilization. 
Crime, often committed by groups of street children or 
armed bandits, poses the highest risk for foreign 
visitors to both Bujumbura and Burundi.  Common crimes 
include muggings, burglaries, robberies and carjackings. 
Visitors should keep car doors locked, windows up, and be 
careful when stopped in heavy traffic due to the threat 
of robbery.  The U.S. Embassy has received reports of 
armed criminals ambushing vehicles, particularly on the 
roads leading out of Bujumbura.  Due to the lack of 
resources, local authorities in any part of Burundi often 
are unable to provide timely assistance during an 
emergency. 
 
¶4. The U.S. Embassy restricts the travel of Embassy 
personnel in Burundi, and certain areas of the capital 
are off-limits to U.S. government personnel after 
nightfall.  U.S. Government personnel are prohibited from 
walking on the streets after dark and from using local 
public transportation at any time.  The Embassy's 
Regional Security Officer (RSO) must pre-approve all 
travel outside a 30 km radius of Bujumbura, and employees 
must travel on an approved itinerary in two-vehicle 
convoys equipped with satellite phones and emergency 
equipment.  The RSO may also place further restrictions 
on employee movement due to changing security conditions, 
such as requiring alternate routing or a security escort. 
Within 30 km of the city, employees may travel in single 
vehicles, but must check in and out with the Embassy. 
All employee movement outside the city after dark is 
forbidden.  The Embassy recommends that American citizens 
not travel on national highways from dusk to dawn. 
 
¶5. American citizens who travel to or remain in Burundi 
despite this Travel Warning are urged to contact the U.S. 
Embassy in Bujumbura for information on the latest 
Embassy security guidelines, and to register at the State 
Department's travel registration website.  By 
registering, American citizens make it easier for the 
Embassy to contact them in case of emergency.  Americans

without internet access may register directly with the 
U.S. Embassy in Bujumbura at Avenue des Etats-Unis.  The 
hours for non-emergency American Citizen Services are 
9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on 
Fridays.  The Embassy Consular section can be reached by 
telephone, including for after hours emergencies, at 
(257) 22-20-7000, or by fax at (257) 22-22-2926. 
Security information for American citizens in Burundi is 
posted at the Embassy's website. 
 
¶6. For further information, consult the Country Specific 
Information for Burundi and the current Worldwide Caution 
Travel Alert, available on the Bureau of Consular Affairs 
Internet website at http://travel.state.gov.  Updated 
information on travel and security in Burundi is 
available at 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the U.S. and 
Canada, or by calling a regular toll line at 202-501-4444
