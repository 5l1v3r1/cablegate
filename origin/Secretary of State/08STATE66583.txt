SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 05-958924 AND 05-982382 
 
REF: BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-3. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 05-958924 and 05-982382 for 
 
the export of night vision devices (NVDs) to Iraq.  PM/DTCC 
understands that the Multi-National Security Transition 
Command in Iraq (MNSTC-I) has begun a comprehensive review of 
NVD location, storage, and accountability.  Department 
requests post to ask MNSTC-I to incorporate this 
post-shipment Blue Lantern check into its comprehensive NVD 
review.  Given this request's extensive scope and the current 
situation in Iraq, PM/DTCC is willing in this case to extend 
its usual 45-day deadline for post-shipment checks in order 
to fit the time frame of MNSTC-I's review.  PM/DTCC notes, 
however, that lack of response to this Blue Lantern check 
will affect pending and future licenses involving parties to 
this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Due to the sensitivity of the 
equipment and the potential for their diversion or misuse, 
the Department of State and the Department of Defense have 
policies of carefully scrutinizing NVD export licenses and 
taking steps to ensure proper end-use.  Provisos attached to 
these licenses obligate the end-user to secure the NVDs from 
loss, theft, or unauthorized access, and to perform routine 
inventory checks by serial number.  These records are to be 
made available for review upon US Government request. 
 
¶4. Post/MNSTC-I is requested to make appropriate inquiries to 
confirm receipt of the NVGs by both U.S. military and Iraqi 
Armed Forces in Iraq, to confirm continued possession by the 
Iraqi Armed Forces of the NVDs, to determine the serial 
numbers of the NVDs, and to verify that all NVDs are secure 
and being used only for the purpose stated on the license. 
Department requests that post/MNSTC-I conduct a site visit, 
if possible, in order to gather and verify this information. 
If a site visit is not possible, please obtain official 
written confirmation of receipt and continued possession, and 
records of inventory checks and inform PM/DTCC case officer.
