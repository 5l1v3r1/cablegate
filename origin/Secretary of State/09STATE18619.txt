     ¶B. STATE 008377 (ANC/STR 09-72/144A) 
     ¶C. STATE 015669 (ANC/STR 09-118/144B) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Background.  On March 20, 2002, the United States, 
Belarus, and Russia reached agreement in the START Treaty,s 
Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC) regarding 
use of ground transportation and related services, provided 
by a Russian commercial cargo carrier designated by the 
Russian Government, to transport U.S. equipment and supplies 
to/from the U.S. START Continuous Portal Monitoring Facility 
(VPMF) located near Votkinsk, Russia (Ref A).  The U.S. 
Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the designated U.S. 
government agency responsible for implementing the terms of 
the Ground Transportation Agreement (GTA).  Raytheon 
Technical Services Company (RTSC) is the U.S. commercial 
logistics contractor designated by DTRA to coordinate the 
provision of GTA-mandated services with the Russian 
commercial cargo carrier (Votkinsk Plant State Production 
Association).  The Russian Nuclear Risk Reduction Center 
(RNRRC) and the Belarusian National Agency for Control and 
Inspections (NAKI) have been designated by their respective 
governments as the agencies responsible for implementation of 
the GTA. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 30, 2009, and February 20, 2009, the 
RNRRC and the NAKI were notified, via U.S. START 
notifications (Refs B and C), regarding the U.S. intent to 
conduct the next VPMF Ground Transportation Resupply Mission. 
 As outlined in Refs B and C, the mission is to occur on 
March 12-26, 2009.  On March 12, 2009, the commercial Russian 
trucks are to arrive at the VPMF where they will be loaded 
with outbound cargo and depart the VPMF for Darmstadt, 
Germany (Nathan Hale Army Depot).  The trucks are to arrive 
at Nathan Hale Army Depot on March 19, 2009.  On that date, 
outbound cargo will be offloaded, inbound cargo will be 
loaded, and the trucks will depart Nathan Hale Army Depot for 
the return trip to the VPMF.  The trucks are to arrive at the 
VPMF with inbound cargo on March 26, 2009. 
 
¶3. (U) Paragraph 9 of the attachment to the GTA letters 
states that the United States "shall provide the Republic of 
Belarus and the Russian Federation with an inventory of the 
cargo consisting of equipment and supplies to be delivered to 
the monitored facility at Votkinsk or removed from that 
facility."  Paragraph 9 also states that the United States 
shall provide such inventory through its embassy no less than 
ten days prior to the arrival of the vehicles on the 
territory of the Republic of Belarus and prior to their 
arrival on (or departure from) the territory of the Russian 
Federation." 
 
¶4. (SBU) RTSC, under the direction of DTRA, has prepared 
cargo inventory lists for the inbound and outbound cargo as 
required by the GTA.  RTSC will be forwarding the cargo 
inventory lists to Embassy Moscow (DTRO-M/ACID) via 
unclassified E-mail on or about February 25, 2009. 
Washington is requesting that Embassy Moscow deliver the 
inventory lists to appropriate host nation government 
officials.  Due to manning issues at Embassy Minsk, the 
inventory lists will be delivered directly to the NAKI by the 
U.S. Nuclear Risk Reduction Center via a service message. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Washington has prepared talking points for host 
nation representatives which reiterate to Russia and Belarus 
the obligations contained in the GTA to ensure: (1) 
expeditious processing of the cargo shipments at the Russian 
and Belarusian national borders; (2) that the cargo shipments 
are exempt from all customs duties; and (3) that examination 
of the cargo shipments is limited to an examination by 
Russian officials at the VPMF.  Washington is requesting that 
Embassy Moscow deliver the talking points to appropriate host 
nation government officials in conjunction with the delivery 
of the inventory lists.  The talking points will be delivered 
to the NAKI via the service message mentioned in paragraph 4 
above. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Action request for Embassy Moscow (DTRO-M/ACID): 
Embassy Moscow is requested to deliver the U.S. Cargo 
Inventory Lists and the information in paragraph 7 below to 
appropriate host nation government officials not later than 
March 2, 2009.  Embassy Moscow is further requested to 
confirm, via cable to Washington and unclassified E-mail to 
DTRA/OSSM (joseph.myer@dtra.mil, michael.morrill@dtra.mil, 
and norman.fuss@dtra.mil) and DTRA/OSAS 
(robert.habashi@dtra.mil and philip.smith@dtra.mil), the 
delivery of the cargo inventory lists, the name and office of 
the official to whom they were delivered, the date of 
delivery, and any comment or reaction provided at that time.
