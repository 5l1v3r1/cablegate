legal frameworks and forensics to combat nuclear and 
radiological terror for GICNT partners on June 7-8, 2010. 
The GOI requested confirmation from Co-Chairs prior to 
beginning planning (Reftel). 
¶6. Background on the GICNT: The GICNT was launched in July 
¶2006.  Its mission is to strengthen international cooperation 
and collaboration to build partners, individual and 
collective capacity to combat the threat of nuclear 
terrorism. The United States and the Russian Federation 
co-chair the GICNT.  GICNT partners are committed to a set of 
principles that encompass a broad range of deterrence, 
prevention, detection, and response objectives.  Through 
multilateral activities and exercises, partners share best 
practices and lessons learned, particularly with regional 
neighbors, in order to strengthen both individual and 
collective capabilities to combat the threat of nuclear 
terrorism.  To date, partners have conducted over thirty 
multilateral activities and five senior-level GICNT meetings, 
resulting in strengthened policies, enhanced information 
sharing techniques, and greater partner nation transparency 
and collaboration. 
¶7. President Obama has called for the Global Initiative to 
become a &durable international institution8 (Prague 
speech, April 2009).  Both the United States and Russia 
welcome the expansion and strengthening of the Global 
Initiative and are currently taking steps to enhance 
implementation of the Initiative.  There are now 76 partners 
in the Global Initiative and four official observers: the 
European Union (EU), International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), the International Criminal Police Organization 
(INTERPOL), and the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime 
(UNODC).
