TAGS: ETTC KOMC NO BU
SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK
ON LICENSE xxxx
REF: 09 OSLO 595

Classified By: Daniel J. Buzby, for reasons 1.4(a), (b), and (d)

¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 4 - 5.

¶2. (U) The Department´s Office of Defense Trade Controls
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Posts´ assistance in conducting
a pre-license check on license xxxx for the export of
rifles to Bulgaria. Posts are requested to complete this
Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses
involving parties to this license.

¶3. (C) Reason for Request: A previous Blue Lantern indicated
that foreign intermediate consignee Reidar Ostby of Norway
may not be properly registered with or authorized by the
Government of Norway (GON) to import or broker defense
articles (REFTEL). REFTEL instructs USG not/not to contact
Reidar Ostby pending an investigation by the GON. In
addition, end-user Star Force of Bulgaria, has been party to
several licenses in the past but has no Blue Lantern history
with PM/DTCC. This request is for Post Oslo to inform the
GON of this transaction involving Reidar Ostby and provide
guidance to PM/DTCC on how best to handle this authorization
request. This request is also to establish the bona fides of
Star Force.

¶4. (C) Action Request Oslo: Post is requested to inform the
appropriate officials of the GON of Reidar Ostby´s
involvement in this transaction. Post is also requested to
provide guidance to PM/DTCC on how best to handle this
license request. For example, PM/DTCC can remove Reidar
Ostby from the license, disallowing the U.S. applicant from
employing the services of the company, if the GON sees no
conflict with their investigation.

¶5. (U) Action Request Sofia: Post is requested to establish
the bona fides of Star Force by making inquiries to
representatives of the company and appropriate authorities of
the Government of Bulgaria. The following points are
included for guidance:
(To Star Force)
--When was your company established and who are its
principals?
--What products and services does your company provide? Who
are your regular customers and where do they reside?
--What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms?
--Do you sell firearms to customers that reside outside
Bulgaria? If so, who are these customers and where do they
reside?
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on
unauthorized re-transfer or re-export?
(To Appropriate Import/Export and/or Law Enforcement
Authorities)
--Is Star Force properly authorized to import and sell
defense articles in Bulgaria?
--Do you have any information on Star Force that would call
in to question their reliability as a recipient of U.S.
defense articles?
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information
pertinent to these transactions such as security of
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities
involved.
