SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1.  (S) The M/V MONCHEGORSK, a Cypriot-flagged vessel 
chartered by Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) 
is carrying Iranian-origin military-related cargo from Bandar 
Abbas, Iran to Tartous, Syria.  A boarding party from a U.S. 
Navy warship boarded and inspected the vessel on two separate 
occasions, and found ammunition, high explosives, compressed 
gunpowder, and slugs among its cargo.  Subsequently, this has 
been reported by the Associated Press.  M/V MONCHEGORSK will 
likely arrive at the Suez Canal on 23 or 24 January. 
 
 
ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (S) Drawing from the points in paragraph 4, which may be 
left as a nonpaper, post is instructed to approach 
appropriate-level Republic of Cyprus (ROC) officials and 
request that the ROC, as the vessel's flag state, divert the 
M/V MONCHEGORSK into a Cypriot port and detain its cargo. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶3.  (S) Post should seek to achieve the following: 
 
-- Provide Cypriot officials with information, including 
photographs of the inspection (provided septel), regarding 
the cargo of the M/V MONCHEGORSK; 
 
-- Emphasize to the Cypriot officials that UN Security 
Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1747, paragraph 5, prohibits Iran 
from transferring any arms or related materiel; 
 
-- Urge the Government of Cyprus (GOC) to take action against 
this shipment pursuant to UNSCR 1747, and in accordance with 
the ROC's laws and authorities; and 
 
-- (If Raised/Asked) Indicate that the USG is willing to 
discuss options for disposition of the cargo with the ROC, as 
well as provide technical support in identifying the cargo. 
 
TALKING POINTS/NON-PAPER 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (S//REL CYPRUS)  Begin talking points/non-paper: 
 
-- The Cypriot-flagged vessel M/V MONCHEGORSK is carrying 
Iranian-origin military-related cargo to Syria. 
 
-- A boarding team from a U.S. Navy vessel was granted 
permission by the ship's master to inspect M/V MONCHEGORSK on 
19 and 20 January 2009 
 
-- The inspection revealed containers carrying 120 mm, 122 
mm, 125 mm, and 160 mm high explosives that originated in 
Iran and are destined for Syria.  Inspection also revealed 
7.62 mm shell casings, compressed gunpowder, silver 
dollar-sized slugs, primer, and magnesium primers.  M/V 
MONCHEGORSK will likely arrive at the Suez Canal on 23-24 
January 2009. 
 
-- UN Security Council Resolution 1747, paragraph 5, 
prohibits Iran from supplying, selling or transferring any 
arms or related materiel.  It also requires all states to 
prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their 
nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, and 
whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of 
Iran. 
 
-- As such, we request your assistance in preventing the 
transfer of goods in violation of UNSCR 1747. 
 
-- In particular, we request that, as the M/V MONCHEGORSK's 
flag state, the Republic of Cyprus divert the vessel to a 
Cypriot port and detain the cargo 
 
IF ASKED: 
 
-- We did not request flag-state consent to board the vessel 
pursuant to our bilateral Ship-Boarding Agreement due to 
uncertainty regarding whether or not the cargo was 
WMD-related. 
 
-- We are willing to discuss with you options for the 
disposition of this cargo, as well as support your efforts to 
identify the cargo. 
 
If Asked About the Press Stories 
 
-- In any public statements regarding the matter we will 
highlight Cyprus's support for international nonproliferation 
efforts and the positive nature of our bilateral, 
non-proliferation cooperation, but we will not, without prior 
consultation, make public any support or actions your 
government may take in this matter.
