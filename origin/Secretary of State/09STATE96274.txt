SUBJECT: OFFICE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS COMPLIANCE 
PLACES SPANISH COMPANY, ELINT S.A. UNDER A POLICY OF DENIAL 
 
REF: A. MADRID 453 B. MADRID 777 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests that Embassy convey to 
appropriate Spanish officials the policy of denial imposed on 
Spanish company, Elint S.A.  Until further notice, Elint S.A. 
will not be approved as a party to any export license for 
United States Munitions List (USML) items.  Furthermore, 
licenses that have been granted (involving Elint S.A. as the 
primary consignee) and have balances that remain unshipped 
will be revoked. 
 
¶3. Background: In June 2008, PM/DTCC requested a Blue Lantern 
post-shipment check on the export of 350 night vision devices 
(NVDs) (authorization request No. 05-971940) to Elint (acting 
as foreign consignee) for the Spanish Marines.   Embassy 
Madrid, supporting DTCC's Blue Lantern inquiry, determined 
that Elint could not account for 112 NVDs, had retransferred 
dozens of NVDs to unauthorized end-users in Spain and outside 
of Spain, had stored at least 114 NVDs in its own facilities 
without authorization, and committed several other likely 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) violations. 
Based on Post's findings, the Spanish MoD asked the Spanish 
National Police to investigate.  ITT, the U.S. licensor is 
also pursuing a patent infringement suit against Elint. 
 
¶4. Post conducted a follow-up site visit on July 9, 2009 (ref 
B) to ascertain the status of the previously unaccounted for 
NVDs.  The site visit determined that 112 of the 350 NVDs 
purchased by Elint could not/not be accounted for.  The 
follow-up check indicated that Elint had sold 13 NVDs to 
unauthorized end-users and kept inadequate records of NVD 
serial numbers, and stored at least 114 NVDs in its own 
facilities without authorization.  Post is cooperating with 
the Spanish National Police (SNP) in an ongoing criminal 
investigation of Elint. 
 
¶5. In early June 2009 Elint requested a license to import 
another 862 NVDs (license application No. 050177626) for 
end-use by the Spanish Marines.  Post recommended that DDTC 
not/not approve any further licenses involving Elint while 
the matter was under investigation.  Based on information 
received from the Spanish MoD on September 3, 2009, support 
documentation (i.e., DSP-83 Nontransfer and Use Certificate) 
for the license application was altered significantly in 
violation of both Spanish and U.S. law. 
 
¶6. Based on Post's reporting, DTCC will advise Elint in 
writing of the Department's policy of denial as follows: 
 
--Pursuant to 126.7(b) of the ITAR (22C.F.R. Parts 120-130), 
the Department of State, DDTC, is hereby placing Elint under 
a policy of denial, effective immediately.  This policy 
applies to current licenses or other approvals and future 
license applications or other requests to which Elint is a 
party. 
 
¶7. ACTION: Department requests that post contact appropriate 
GOS officials to convey the policy of denial that has been 
imposed on Elint S.A.  Department recognizes and appreciates 
Spanish government cooperation in investigating Elint and 
does not/not wish to disrupt legitimate U.S. defense trade 
exports to a valued U.S. ally.  Post should advise GOS that 
export requests for Spain for night vision devices or other 
USML items will be favorably considered if supported by a 
purchase document between a generally eligible Spanish 
consignee and a U.S. manufacturer/exporter or a purchase 
document directly between the GOS and a U.S. 
manufacturer/exporter.  Finally, the Department requests that 
post make clear that any future exports to Spain involving 
Elint will be denied. 
END ACTION

the subject line.  POC is Tim Mazzarelli, PM/DTCC, Phone:

¶9. Department is grateful for Embassy's assistance in this 
matter.
