SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050094399 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment end-use check on license number 050094399 for 
the export of defense hardware to France.  Post is requested 
to complete this Blue Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack 
of response to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  To confirm bona fides of unfamiliar 
End-user Emitech Qamas Division, and to verify final end use 
of item. 
 
¶4. Action: Department requests that Post make appropriate 
inquiries to confirm that the End-user received the listed 
item for the purpose stated on the license.  Conduct a site 
visit to Emitech Qamas Division to confirm that it received 
the exact type and quantity of items listed on the license. 
Post should assess the end-user's business operations and 
relationships, on-site security, and general reliability as a 
recipient of United States Munitions List (USML) items. 
Emphasize that the unauthorized re-export or retransfer of 
USML items is strictly prohibited. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
-- Is Emitech Qamas Division the final end user of the item? 
Was the item integrated into a larger system? If so, 
which system and who performed the integration? 
 
-- Who are Emitech Qamas Division's customers, what is the 
nature of their business, and where are they located? 
 
-- Are you familiar with EMV SARL located in Gennevilliers? 
If so, what was its role in the transaction? 
 
-- Did you order the exact type and quantity of items listed 
on this license from EMV SARL? 
 
-- Is EMV SARL an official supplier/contractor for the end 
user in France?  Does the end-user have any 
other contracts with EMV SARL that involve the procurement of 
USML? 
 
-- Were there any additional foreign parties (e.g. 
consignees, freight forwarders, etc.) involved in this 
transaction? 
 
-- Does Emitech Qamas Division understand the restrictions on 
USML items (especially the prohibition against unauthorized 
re-transfers, re-exports, or changes in end use)? 
 
End Action Request.
