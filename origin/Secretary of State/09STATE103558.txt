SUBJECT: WHA ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHANNON'S SEPTEMBER 29, 
2009 CONVERSATION WITH NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER SANTOS 
 
Classified By: WHA Assistant Secretary Thomas A. Shannon for 
reasons 1.4 (d) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) September 29, 2009; 2:30 p.m.; New York, NY, USA. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Participants: 
 
U.S. 
WHA Assistant Secretary Thomas A. Shannon 
Anthony Miranda (WHA Notetaker) 
 
Nicaragua 
Foreign Minister Samuel Santos Lopez 
Ambassador Jaime Hermida Castillo, Deputy UN PermRep 
Roberto Leal Ocampo, Director General for European Affairs 
 
¶3.  (C) SUMMARY.  WHA Assistant Secretary Thomas Shannon met 
with Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel Santos Lopez on the 
margins of the UN General Assembly.  Santos expressed his 
concerns about events in Honduras.  He said members of the 
pro-Zelaya resistance were in Nicaragua looking for weapons. 
In what Santos described as a fortuitously timed phone call, 
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega spoke with A/S Shannon 
during the meeting and also raised arms-trafficking concerns. 
 
Santos suggested strong U.S. economic sanctions would bring 
the de facto regime to its knees. 
 
¶4.  (C) Unrelated to Honduras, Santos showed A/S Shannon 
press clippings he thought demonstrated the Nicaraguan 
media's unfair and inaccurate treatment of the Ortega 
administration.  Finally, Santos requested U.S. assistance 
in arranging a meeting with World Bank President Richard 
Zoellick during Santos' Oct 19-30 trip to Washington, DC. 
Santos suggested he could meet with U.S. Congress members 
and the Secretary during this visit as well.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Nicaraguan Concerns About Arms Trafficking 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (C) Shortly after Foreign Minister Santos and A/S 
Shannon sat down to speak, Santos received an "unexpected" 
call from Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.  Santos 
invited A/S Shannon to speak with the president.  The 
president expressed worry over the Honduras crisis. 
Ortega said growing frustration in Honduras could lead 
to violence, and noted that members of the pro-Zelaya 
resistance were in Nicaragua looking for weapons. 
Ortega said his government had deflected these overtures, 
but he was very worried about increasing radicalization 
of the popular sectors in Honduras.  After the telephone 
call concluded, Santos echoed Ortega's concerns about arms 
trafficking. 
 
-------------------- 
SICA Summit Proposal 
-------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Santos said he contacted the foreign ministers of 
El Salvador and Guatemala to enlist their support for an 
informal Central American Integration System (SICA) 
discussion at the head-of-state level on regional arms 
trafficking due to the Honduras crisis and to discuss how 
best to fashion a solution to the stalemate. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Nicaragua Suggests Economic Sanctions Against Honduras 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Santos suggested the United States impose economic 
sanctions against the de facto regime to bring Micheletti 
to the bargaining table.  A/S Shannon explained that broad 
economic sanctions would do more harm to the average 
Honduran worker than to the de factos.  American companies 
would have to look elsewhere to satisfy their need for 
textiles and other goods if sanctions prevented them from 
doing business with Honduran factories, A/S Shannon said. 
Instead, A/S Shannon noted, we were using tightly focused 
sanctions aimed at those in the private sector and military 
who supported the coup. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Nicaraguan Media Treatment of Ortega Administration 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶8.  (C) Apart from Honduras, Santos showed A/S Shannon 
examples of what he thought demonstrated the Nicaraguan 
media's ill treatment of the Ortega administration, 
including from outlets receiving USAID support. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Santos, Oct. 19-30 Trip to Washington 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  (C) Santos requested U.S. help in securing meetings with 
Work Bank President Robert Zoellick during Santos' October 
19-30 trip to Washington, DC.  He expressed concern over some 
of the World Bank's economic policies towards Nicaragua. 
Santos suggested he could meet with members of Congress 
during 
the same trip.  He also floated the idea of meeting with the 
Secretary, noting other Central American foreign ministers 
have done so.  A/S Shannon noted he would identify new 
Congress member with whom Santos could meet.
