SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN POST-SHIPMENT END USE CHECK ON 
LICENSE 050086546 AND 050150345 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
post-shipment check for the export of chemical warfare agent 
and radiation detectors to Egypt.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: the Foreign Consignee, Arab 
Commercial Office, has a limited licensing history with our 
office.  Large quantity of commodities requested that have 
potential for diversion; the second license is a partial 
duplicate request of the first license. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign End User, Government 
of Egypt Armament Authority, and confirm its receipt of the 
exact quantities and specific types of commodities listed 
below.  END ACTION.
