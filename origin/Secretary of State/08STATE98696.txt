SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - IRAN 
 
¶1.  The Department of State continues to warn U.S. 
citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to 
Iran.  Dual national Iranian-American citizens may 
encounter difficulty in departing Iran.  This Travel 
Warning supersedes the Travel Warning for Iran issued 
January 3, 2008. 
¶2.  Some elements of the Iranian regime and the 
population remain hostile to the United States.  As a 
result, American citizens may be subject to harassment 
or arrest while traveling or residing in Iran.  In 2007, 
Iranian authorities prevented a number of Iranian- 
American citizen academics, journalists, and others who 
traveled to Iran for personal reasons from leaving for 
several months, and in some cases detained and 
imprisoned them on various charges, including espionage 
and posing a threat to national security.  Americans of 
Iranian origin should consider the risk of being 
targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. 
Iranian authorities may deny dual nationals access to 
the United States Interests Section in Tehran, because 
they are considered to be solely Iranian citizens. 
¶3.  The Iranian regime continues to repress its minority 
religious and ethnic groups, including Bahai, Arabs, 
Kurds, Azeris, and others.  Consequently, some areas 
within the country where these minorities reside, 
including the Baluchistan border area near Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, the Kurdish northwest of the country, and 
areas near the Iraqi border, remain unsafe.  Armed 
attacks on the road between Bam and Kerman in May 2007 
also render this area unsafe. 
¶4.  Large-scale demonstrations have taken place in 
various regions throughout Iran over the past several 
years as a result of a sometimes volatile political 
climate.  U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite this 
Travel Warning should exercise caution. 
¶5.  The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or 
consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
therefore cannot provide protection or routine consular 
services to American citizens in Iran.  The Swiss 
government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves 
as protecting power for U.S. interests in Iran.  Neither 
U.S. passports nor visas to the United States are issued 
in Tehran.  The Iranian Government does not recognize 
dual citizenship and generally does not permit the Swiss 
to provide protective services for U.S. citizens who are 
also Iranian nationals.  U.S. citizens of Iranian origin 
who are considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens have 
been detained and harassed by Iranian authorities. 
Former Muslims who have converted to other religions, as 
well as persons who encourage Muslims to convert, are 
subject to arrest and prosecution. 
¶6.  Americans who travel or reside in Iran despite this 
Travel Warning are strongly encouraged to register 
through the State Department's travel registration 
website, https://travelregistration.state.gov.  If they 
are in Tehran, American citizens may also register in 
person at the U.S. Interests Section of the Swiss 
Embassy at Africa Avenue, West Farzan Street, no. 59, 
Tehran.  The local telephone numbers are 021-8878-2964 
and 021-8879-2364, fax 021-8877-3265, e-mail: 
tie.vertretung@eda.admin.ch. 
¶7.  U.S. citizens should also consult the Department of 
State's Country Specific Information for Iran, and the 
current Worldwide Caution, which are located on the 
Department's Internet web site at 
http://travel.state.gov.  American citizens may also 
obtain updated information on travel and security 
conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the 
United States and Canada or, from outside the United 
States and Canada, 1-202-501-4444. 
 
¶8.  Minimize considered.
