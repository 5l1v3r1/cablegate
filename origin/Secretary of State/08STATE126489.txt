SUBJECT: FINALIZING THE SEISMIC AGREEMENT 
 
REF: 07 STATE 120858 
 
SUMMARY 
------ 
 
¶1.  Department requests Embassy Rabat to urge the Moroccan 
government to sign the Seismic Agreement (reftel) no later 
than December 31, 2008.  A later signature could result in 
delays that would jeopardize the project's timely completion. 
 End summary. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶2.  Department instructs Rabat to pursue the following 
objectives: 
 
-- Note that while the GOM has not objected to the draft 
agreement since it received it in August 2007, it has not 
signed the agreement. 
 
-- Urge the Moroccan government not to tie the 
government-to-government agreement to negotiations on leasing 
suitable land, and underscore that the land is a prerequisite 
to installation, not the signing of the agreement. 
 
-- Press the GOM to sign the agreement no later than December 
31, 2008, and note signing after that date could add an 
additional year to the projected installation date. 
 
 
REPORTING DEADLINE 
------------------ 
 
¶3.  Post should report the GOM's response by front channel no 
later than December 10, 2008.  POC for this request is 
NEA/MAG Morocco desk officer Randall Kaailau. 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶4.  Since 2004, the Air Force Technical Applications Center 
(AFTAC) has worked with Morocco's Centre National pour la 
Recherche Scientifique et Technique (CNRST) on a project to 
install seismic detection equipment.  The agreed draft text 
of the government-to-government agreement was sent to Morocco 
in August 2007.  AFTAC cannot purchase the seismic equipment 
until the agreement is signed, and since the seismic 
equipment has a 16-18 month lead time for procurement and 
delivery, the Director of Nuclear Treaty Monitoring would 
like the GOM to sign the agreement by the end of December 
¶2008.  If this agreement is not signed this year, the 
CNRST/AFTAC project is likely to incur increased costs and 
installation could be delayed from 2010 to 2011.
