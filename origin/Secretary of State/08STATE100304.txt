SUBJECT: SUDAN - WEEKLY REPORTING ON UNAMID DEPLOYMENT 
READINESS 
 
¶1. This is an action cable - see paragraphs 4-6 as applicable. 
 
¶2. The Administration and the Department view the deployment 
of additional peacekeeping troops to Darfur as one of its 
highest priorities for 2008.  An Egyptian battalion and an 
Ethiopian battalion taskforce are next in line for deployment 
to UNAMID.  In Rwanda, provision of U.S. training and 
equipment is complete and four Rwandan infantry battalions of 
800 personnel each are eager to rotate into Darfur at full UN 
strength before December.  Deployment of these units will put 
over 4,000 much needed additional troops on the ground to 
help stabilize the security situation and protect civilians, 
but we are increasingly concerned about delays in the full 
deployment of these units.  The Ethiopians and Egyptians were 
originally scheduled to deploy in Darfur in the first quarter 
of 2008, but to date only small advance companies have been 
deployed. 
 
¶3. Pinpointing the obstacles to all three deployments - 
whether practical or political - is essential to the 
Department's efforts to craft constructive interventions. 
Increased reporting from troop contributing capitals and 
engagement with UNAMID leadership and host country officials 
would enhance our understanding and help us overcome these 
obstacles.  Past reporting from posts on these and related 
issues has been exemplary.  We would appreciate more targeted 
reporting specifically on Egyptian, Ethiopian, and Rwandan 
deployments. 
 
¶4. ACTION ADDIS ABABA, CAIRO, and KIGALI - Posts are 
requested to engage regularly with host country officials at 
the highest levels to urge rapid deployment of peacekeeping 
troops pledged to Darfur.  Posts are also requested to 
establish a weekly reporting cable to update Washington on 
the readiness, timetable, and deployment challenges of the 
host nation's Darfur troop contingent.  The cable should 
include reporting on engagement with political, military, and 
civilian military leaders.  This information will assist U.S. 
officials in Washington and New York in targeting political 
engagements and practical assistance to help advance 
deployment of these units.  Please send the first weekly 
cable on Sept. 23, and to identify in that cable an Embassy 
point of contact for follow up on UNAMID deployment issues. 
 
¶5. ACTION KHARTOUM - Post is requested to continue and deepen 
engagement with UNAMID officials in Khartoum and Headquarters 
El Fasher on all issues related to the deployment of the 
Egyptian, Ethiopian, and Rwandan troop contingents and report 
back in weekly cables on UNAMID deployment beginning on Sept. 
¶23.  Post should also prepare to engage the GOS to ensure 
that it is prepared not only to accept but facilitate these 
rapid deployments.  Please identify the primary point of 
contact for this effort in the initial cable. 
 
¶6. ACTION USUN - Post is requested to continue its intense 
effort through the Friends of UNAMID to engage with UN 
planners to press for the deployment of Egyptian, Ethiopian, 
and Rwandan peacekeeping elements.  USUN is further requested 
to report promptly, via front channel cable, on the outcome 
of all meetings of the Friends of UNAMID.   USUN is requested 
to develop a template for a periodic reporting cable on the 
status, timeline, and obstacles to those deployments.   An 
update on UNAMID's deployment should be submitted, via front 
channel cable, every two weeks.  USUN is requested to send 
these brief update reports, even if no significant change has 
occurred in the intervening period. 
 
¶7. Department thanks Posts for their assistance. 
 
¶8. Minimize considered.
