¶3.  Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Under Secretary of State Waszczykowski: 
 
On behalf of the U.S. Government, I want to thank you for 
your luncheon address delivered at the May 28, 2008 
Senior-Level Meeting of Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) participants in Washington DC, covering Poland's views 
on the state of the PSI.  Your speech made an important 
contribution to the success of the meeting.  I particularly 
welcome your call for greater regional cooperation and 
Poland's proposal to host a regional Operational Experts 
Group (OEG) meeting next year.  For our part, the U.S. 
Department of Defense is planning to host a regional OEG 
meeting next year for Western Hemisphere states.  Poland 
will, of course, also be invited to participate. 
 
I believe the PSI Fifth Anniversary Senior-Level Meeting was 
very successful in reaffirming the strong commitment of the 
PSI partner states to respond to the WMD proliferation 
challenge.  It also provided the participants from 85 
countries an opportunity to strengthen communication with 
each other.  We hope this event will result in expanded 
participation in PSI activities, particularly on a regional 
basis.  The United States recognizes that Poland plays a 
significant role in the PSI, and we greatly appreciate your 
Government's continued efforts and contributions to advancing 
the PSI goals. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
John C. Rood 
Acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and 
International Security
