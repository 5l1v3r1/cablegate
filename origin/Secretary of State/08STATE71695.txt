SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (DA) 2592-05 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license check on distribution agreement (DA) 2592-05 
for the export of defense services and technical data related 
to Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to 
multiple foreign end users via Litef GmbH in Germany.  Post 
is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 
days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect 
pending and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Concern that Litef GmbH, foreign 
signatory located in Germany, may be exceeding the scope of 
an agreement with U.S. applicant NXP Semiconductors USA, 
Inc., by selling ASICs to unauthorized end users. 
 
¶4. ACTION: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate Litef officials to determine if the company is 
following the terms of the agreement authorizing the sale and 
distribution of Application Specific Integrated Circuits 
(ASICs) to approved end users.  Department requests that 
Embassy contact Litef in order to assess its compliance with 
the terms of the agreement and obtain answers to the 
following questions: 
 
- Can Litef provide an annual sales report (with a list of 
all end users) covering each year since the DA was approved 
in 2005? 
 
- Are sales limited to the governments of the countries in 
the distribution territory? Approved end users include only 
the Ministries of Defense of the following countries: 
Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, 
Columbia, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, 
Israel, Italy, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, Oman, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, 
Thailand, Turkey, UAE, and the United Kingdom. 
 
- Can Litef verify that no items have been exported to 
Russia, Venezuela, or Indonesia? 
 
- Is Litef performing any repair work for the end users? 
 
- Are the ASICs or other United States Munitions List (USML) 
items stored in a dedicated portion of the warehouse (and 
kept separate from non-USML items)? 
 
END ACTION.
