SUBJECT: GUIDANCE:  CONSULTATIONS ON BRAMMERTZ REPORT,

¶1.  (U)  USUN is authorized to draw from the points in para 2 
during consultations on the 6th UN International Independent 
Investigation Commission (UNIIIC) currently scheduled for 
December 18, 2006. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin points. 
 
--  We welcome the 6th report from the UN International 
Independent Investigation Commission and applaud Chief 
Investigator Serge Brammertz and his team for their rigorous 
and detailed investigation. 
 
--  The Commission's work on the 14 cases shows significant 
indications of links between each case and indicates links to 
the Rafiq Hariri assassination. 
 
--  We are encouraged by the quick progress in investigating 
Pierre Gemayel's assassination. 
 
--  We understand that due to the dangerous and volatile 
political situation, and the sensitive stage of the 
investigation, UNIIIC cannot release some specific details 
about its findings at this point.  We appreciate the 
Commission's focus on building a strong, prosecutable case 
and protecting its witnesses. 
 
--  We continue to call on all parties, particularly Syria, 
to fully cooperate with Mr. Brammertz,s investigation. 
 
--  We welcome the Commission's decision to prepare for the 
establishment of the Tribunal and hope that the transition 
from investigation to prosecution goes smoothly. 
 
--  We continue to support the prompt establishment of a 
Special Tribunal to try those suspected of involvement in 
these assassinations and fully support the efforts of the 
Commission. 
 
--  We must also recognize that this investigation and the 
Tribunal do not exist in a vacuum.  The recent surge in 
violence and efforts to weaken Prime Minister Siniora,s 
cabinet are clearly intended to undermine Lebanon,s 
sovereignty and political independence; we cannot let the 
democratic will of the Lebanese people be undermined by 
outside influences seeking to stop the Tribunal. 
 
--  The Hariri tribunal must go forward, as a matter of 
justice, and to demonstrate that those who 
assassinated the leaders of Lebanon cannot do so with 
impunity. 
 
End points.
