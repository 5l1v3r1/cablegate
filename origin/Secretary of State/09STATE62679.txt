BY THE OSCE HIGH COMMISSIONER ON NATIONAL MINORITIES, KNUT

the June 18, 2009, meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council in 
Vienna: 
 
Begin Text: 
 
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
 
The United States warmly welcomes Ambassador Vollebaek back 
to the Permanent Council and thanks him for his thorough and 
thoughtful report. 
 
Mr. Ambassador, we share your concern about the problem of 
increasing segregation along ethnic lines in education.  We 
support your efforts to operationalize OSCE commitments in 
this field, including through your assistance to Ukrainian 
and Russian authorities on the educational situation of their 
minority populations and to Macedonia to address ethnic 
segregation in primary and secondary education.  Your efforts 
to enhance regional cooperation in Central Asia on key issues 
of common interest to the States ) primarily related to 
education ) are also laudable. 
 
We fully agree with you on the importance of representative 
democracy, including the participation of individuals from 
the different ethnic, racial, or religious groups that form 
the fabric of the society in the governance of their country. 
In the United States, the strength of our democracy is rooted 
in majority rule, with strong protection for the voting 
rights of individuals, without discrimination on the basis of 
race, color, or membership in a language minority group.  The 
U.S. Government has invested a great deal in outreach to 
minorities, and has made an effort to include them in the 
consultation and decision-making process wherever possible. 
We view this as critical to increasing understanding and 
integration of minorities in society and ultimately, to 
preventing conflict. 
 
We strongly support your activities in Georgia, where your 
efforts to call attention to the rights and needs of ethnic 
minorities and internally displaced persons are particularly 
important.  Your September 2008 trip to Georgia, including 
Abkhazia, and your office,s participation in the joint 
HCNM/ODIHR assessment mission a month later, were valuable 
contributions to efforts to protect vulnerable communities 
there. 
 
In your November 2008 joint report with ODIHR on human rights 
in the war-affected areas of Georgia, you rightly indicated 
that serious human rights and humanitarian concerns remain. 
We reiterate our call for the immediate implementation of the 
report,s recommendations, and once more urge a follow-up 
assessment to ascertain the current human rights conditions 
in the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of Georgia. 
 
We hope you and your office will expand your work throughout 
Georgia, including in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, in order to 
foster peace and stability and to ensure human rights are 
respected. 
 
We commend your essential work to advance human rights and 
improve interethnic relations throughout the OSCE area and 
wish you every success in your work for the upcoming year. 
 
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
CLINTON
