SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - GEORGIA 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning updates information on the 
current security situation in Georgia to include the 
return of U.S. Embassy eligible family members to 
Tbilisi, the resumption of visa services, and the status 
of roads within the country.  This Travel Warning 
supersedes the Travel Warning for Georgia issued August 
12, 2008.  The Department of State authorized the return 
of U.S. Embassy eligible family members to Tbilisi on 
August 23, 2008.  However, since Russian troops remain in 
some parts of the country near Poti, Zugidi and Senaki 
as well as in the conflict zones, Embassy staff and 
family members will travel outside of Tbilisi only with 
the concurrence of the Regional Security Officer.  The 
Department of State urges U.S. citizens in Georgia to 
exercise caution while traveling. 
¶2.  American citizens currently in Georgia are urged to 
continue to review their personal security situations to 
take appropriate action to ensure their safety.  Given 
the recent upheaval in Georgia, American citizens should 
take precautions in case of an increase in violent 
crime.  Private American citizens are encouraged to 
follow the precautions detailed below and to remain in 
close communication with the American Embassy in Tbilisi 
for more detailed information. 
¶3.  On August 10, 11, and 14 three Embassy-coordinated 
convoys departed Georgia for Armenia.  There are no 
additional convoys currently scheduled at this time. 
The Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy suspended visa 
processing, but will resume visa services on August 27. 
The Peace Corps temporarily relocated trainees and 
volunteers to Armenia on August 11, however, the Peace 
Corps office in Tbilisi remains open for business. 
¶4.  American citizens in Georgia are advised to register 
with the Department of State on-line at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs or in person 
at U.S. Embassy Tbilisi so that they can obtain updated 
information on travel and security.  Travel in some 
parts of western Georgia remains unpredictable. 
¶5.  American citizens should monitor the U.S. Embassy 
website http://georgia.usembassy.gov and stay in contact 
with family and friends in the United States.  American 
citizens in Tbilisi may also tune in to Radio Syndicati 
at FM 104.3 or throughout Georgia at Radio Green Wave at 
FM 107.4 for updated U.S. Embassy warden message 
information. 
¶6.  Family members and friends unable to verify the 
safety and welfare of U.S. citizens in the affected area 
should call 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United 
States and Canada, or from other areas via a regular 
toll line at 1-202-501-4444.  U.S. citizens in the area 
are urged to monitor the local news.  Those residing or 
traveling in Georgia are reminded to register with the 
U.S. Embassy either online at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs or in person 
at U.S. Embassy Tbilisi so that they can obtain updated 
information on travel and security.  By registering, 
American citizens make it easier for the embassy to 
contact them in case of emergency. 
¶7.  The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi is located at 11 George 
Balanchine Street (in Didi Dighomi), Tbilisi 0131, 
Georgia, tel: 995-32-27-70-00.  The after-hours 
emergency number is 995-99-57-39-69, or, if dialing 
locally on a mobile telephone, 899-57-39-69. 
¶8.  For the latest security information, Americans 
living and traveling abroad should regularly monitor the 
Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs internet web 
site at http://travel.state.gov, where the current 
Worldwide Caution, Travel Alerts, Travel Warnings, 
Country Specific Information, and health information 
resources can be found.  Up-to-date information on 
security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 
toll free in the United States, or for callers outside 
the United States and Canada, a regular toll line at 1-
