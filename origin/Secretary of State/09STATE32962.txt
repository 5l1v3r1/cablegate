SUBJECT: SYRIAN NATIONAL DAY ATTENDANCE 
 
REF: STATE 20919 
 
¶1. (SBU) Posts receiving invitations to receptions for 
Syria's April 17 National Day are authorized to attend at the 
deputy chief of mission level or below.  In any substantive 
discussion of U.S. policy toward Syria, posts are authorized 
to draw from reftel points.  This is a one-time authorization. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Since 2005, the Department has maintained extremely 
limited official contact with Syria, a designated state 
sponsor of terrorism.  President Obama and Secretary Clinton 
have committed to sustained and principled engagement with 
Syria to advance shared goals and address key concerns.  On 
February 26, NEA Acting Assistant Secretary Jeffrey Feltman 
met Syrian Ambassador Imad Mustapha in Washington.  On March 
7, Feltman and NSC Senior Director for the Near East and 
North Africa Daniel Shapiro met Syrian Foreign Minister Walid 
Muallim in Damascus.  In the wake of these initial contacts, 
Syria has taken limited positive steps, including naming an 
ambassador to Lebanon, dispatching Muallim to Baghdad to meet 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and agreeing to reopen the 
American Language Center in Damascus.  As additional 
engagement proves fruitful, the Department will undertake a 
broader review of its policy on official contact with Syria. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Please contact NEA Syria desk officer Allison Monz 
with questions or for further guidance.
