SUBJECT: GUIDANCE FOR UN ENVOY BRIEFING ON DARFUR 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) USUN is instructed to draw on the following talking 
points during the June 8 UN Security Council briefing with UN 
Special Envoy for Darfur Jan Eliasson on the political 
process in Darfur. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Begin talking points. 
 
-- We welcome your efforts to widen support for the Darfur 
Peace Agreement (DPA), and we remain committed to supporting 
the UN/AU-led mediation process. 
 
-- We encourage you to develop a more detailed road map that 
includes a timeline, specific initiatives, and roles for all 
parties, including regional actors.  Initiatives that are not 
part of this road map should be discouraged. (Note: 
Indications are that the plan Eliasson will present to the 
UNSC will not have the required level of detail). 
 
-- On April 30 in Tripoli, the government of Sudan, the 
regional actors, and the international community as a whole 
agreed to support your leadership in the political process. 
That leadership is necessary to stop unhelpful or duplicative 
initiatives and give direction to all interested parties. 
 
-- We welcome your support for the Center for Humanitarian 
Dialogue conference in Nairobi to unite the Sudan Liberation 
Movement (SLM) ahead of the Sudan Peoples, Liberation 
Movement (SPLM) conference in Southern Sudan.  We believe 
this effort has the best chance of preparing the SLM for the 
larger conference.  Your leadership and active support will 
be necessary to make sure this conference succeeds, including 
reaching out to the government of Kenya, regional 
governments, and the rebel groups to ensure their support and 
wide SLM attendance.  The government of Sudan, which agreed 
to your leadership of the political process in Tripoli, 
cannot be allowed to dictate how you work to unify the 
rebels. (Note: GOS officials have reportedly told Eliasson 
that they are opposed to rebel meetings outside Sudan). 
 
-- Your leadership is also required for the SPLM conference. 
The SPLM,s willingness to help in resolving the political 
process in Darfur is very helpful.  However, they will need 
direction from the UN/AU mediation team to ensure the 
conference has a realistic scope, reasonable goals, and fits 
within the broader UN/AU-led political process.  The UN/AU 
will also need to organize the resources for this conference. 
 The United States is ready to assist with this process. 
 
-- We welcome the addition of former EU Special Rep Pekka 
Haavisto to your team.  We understand, however, that Mr. 
Haavisto does not plan to be resident in Khartoum during this 
process.  What is your plan for having full-time, high-level 
representation in Sudan?  Because the situation is so complex 
and dynamic, sustained relationship-building and leadership 
are required for success. 
 
End talking points.
