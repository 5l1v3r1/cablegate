SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON UKRAINIAN 
SEIZURE OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS 
 
REF: A. A) CEP20080707950429 
     ¶B. B) 2007 STATE 162091 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request for Embassy Kyiv.  Please 
see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (U) BACKGROUND:  According to Ref A, the Ukrainian 
Interior Ministry in the Cherkasy region detained two men 
attempting to sell cesium and enriched uranium for five 
million U.S. dollars.  According to the report, the 
radioactive materials were found during a car inspection 
while the suspects traveled from Dnipropetrovsk to Cherkasy 
region.  There was no information on the buyer of the 
material.  The materials have been secured at a Radon 
facility in Kyiv and are undergoing analysis.  The 
individuals attempted to sell the confiscated radioactive 
materials as a sample in order to maintain a channel for 
further sales.  A media report also indicated that one of the 
detained is on the consulate registration list for the 
Ukrainian Embassy in Germany. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Post is requested to seek answers 
from appropriate Ukrainian officials to the questions in 
paras 12 and 13 of Ref B and to provide a coordinated 
response to Washington via front-channel cable.  All relevant 
agencies at Embassy Kyiv are requested to coordinate outreach 
to the GOU.
