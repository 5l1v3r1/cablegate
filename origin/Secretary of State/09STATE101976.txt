¶1.  The UAE government transition to its new visa policy 
will take place on October 1, 2009.  Effective this 
date, all persons traveling to the UAE on a U.S. 
diplomatic or official passport must obtain a visa prior 
to arrival.  As with any new policy, we expect that 
there will be a few bumps along the path to full 
implementation. 
 
¶2.  Diplomatic and official travelers may apply for a 
visa at any UAE embassy.  If there is not a UAE embassy 
in the  country in which the traveler lives, the 
application should be sent to a UAE embassy in a nearby 
country.  The visa application form and requirements 
photos, etc.) will be accessible via the given embassy?s 
internet website. 
 
¶3.  The UAEG has indicated that there should be no fee 
for a diplomatic or official visa, and the visa will 
usually be processed within 72 hours.  U.S. diplomatic 
and official travelers should generally be issued 
multiple-entry visas with a validity of five years, in 
keeping with reciprocity.  Travelers may stay in the UAE 
for up to 60 days each visit. 
 
¶4. Although final policy remains unclear, UAEG has 
indicated there will not be any exemption for persons 
transiting the UAE on diplomatic or official passports. 
We therefore strongly recommend that all transit 
passengers secure a visa prior to their arrival in the 
UAE. 
 
¶5.  There is no change in the visa policy for persons 
traveling on regular (blue) passports. Persons traveling 
on official business should not/not attempt to enter or 
transit the UAE using tourist procedures. 
 
¶6.  While the UAE government has set a service standard 
of 72 hours to respond to visa requests, we anticipate 
delays in the first few months.  We strongly encourage 
travelers to apply for their visas at least two weeks in 
advance of travel.  Because adjudication takes place in 
Abu Dhabi, UAE embassies abroad can expedite visas only 
in very limited circumstances.  Officials without 
immediate need to travel may be well served by delaying 
application until the new policy has been fully 
implemented.
