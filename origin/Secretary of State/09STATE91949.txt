SUBJECT: EXPANDING THE REACH OF RADIO PROGRAMMING IN PAKISTAN 
 
1.(SBU) This is an action request, see paragraph 4. 
 
2.(SBU) Background:  There is a critical need to broaden terrestrial 
radio transmissions and expand available content for radio programming 
in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  One vehicle to help us fill this need is 
Voice of America's (VOA) programming, including its Pashto language 
channel, Radio Deewa.  Currently, Radio Deewa is carried on multiple 
shortwave frequencies and on three FM transmitters in Afghanistan. 
However, Radio Deewa lacks distribution on both AM and FM transmitters 
within Pakistan.  In order to address Radio Deewa's distribution 
challenge, in September 2008, the International Broadcasting Board 
(IBB) finalized an agreement with the Pakistan Broadcasting 
Corporation to lease its Peshawar Transmitter.  However, the lease 
agreement has not yet been ratified by Pakistan's Cabinet, rendering 
Radio Deewa unable to broadcast.  Similarly, Voice of America's Urdu 
Service has been unable to use a separate leased network of FM 
transmitters in Pakistan because that lease agreement has also not 
been ratified by the Cabinet. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In a May 11, 2009, meeting in the United States, an IBB 
official raised the transmitter leases with Pakistan's Minister of 
Information Qamar Kaira, and in that meeting Minister Kaira indicated 
he would render a decision on the leases "within one week."  Despite 
several follow-up queries from IBB officials, no decision has been 
forthcoming. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request:  Ambassador is requested to press the GOP for 
final agreement on use of these transmitters without delay, including 
raising the issue with President Zardari and/or Prime Minister Gilani 
as necessary.  End Action Request. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Please report results via front-channel cable.
