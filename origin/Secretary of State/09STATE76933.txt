SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050035123 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 050035123 for the 
export of night vision devices (NVDs) to 
New Zealand.  Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
check will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Due to the sensitivity of the 
equipment and the potential for their diversion or misuse, 
the Department of State and the Department of Defense have 
policies of carefully scrutinizing NVD export licenses and 
taking steps to ensure proper end-use.  Provisos attached 
to these licenses obligate the end-user to secure the NVDs 
from loss, theft, or unauthorized access, and to perform 
routine inventory checks by serial number.  These records 
are to be made available for review upon US Government 
request. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to make appropriate 
inquiries 
to confirm continued possession by Helicopters Otago Ltd. of 
the NVDs, to determine the serial numbers of the NVDs, and 
to verify that all NVDs are secure and being used only for 
the purpose stated on the license.  Department requests 
that post conduct a site visit, if possible, in order to 
gather and verify this information.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please obtain official written confirmation 
of receipt and possession and inform PM/DTCC case officer. 
 
¶5. For background, the following details of the license in 
question are provided:
