SUBJECT: GREAT LAKES: TALKING POINTS FOR NOVEMBER 9 UNSC 
CONSULTATIONS 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  USUN should draw from the 
points in paragraph 2 below for the Great Lakes UN Security 
Council (UNSC) consultations on November 9. 
 
¶2. Begin talking points: 
 
--  We appreciate the efforts over the past year of the UN 
Secretary General's Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, 
former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, and 
co-facilitator from the African Union and the International 
Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), former 
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.  They played an important 
role in addressing the imminent threat posed by the National 
Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP) to the 
stability of eastern DRC, and in assisting the DRC and Rwanda 
in deepening rapprochement.  This rapprochement led to 
significant positive steps between the two countries, from 
the exchange of ambassadors to the joint operations against 
the CNDP, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda 
(FDLR) and other illegal armed groups. 
 
--  The efforts of Presidents Obasanjo and Mkapa have 
advanced the peace process in the Great Lakes region.  The 
accords of 23 March among the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, the CNDP and other rebel groups were 
but one manifestation of their hard work.  Another is renewed 
confidence between the Governments of the DRC and Rwanda and 
their joint efforts to find solutions to their common 
concerns. 
 
--  Although problems persist, the relations between the 
neighbors suggest that a UN mediator of such a high level is 
no longer as critical as it was a year ago.  The United 
States, therefore, agrees with the decisions of Special 
Envoys Obasanjo and Mkapa to close out their roles. 
Nonetheless, we look forward to continuing our efforts with 
our partners in the region.  U.S. Special Advisor for the 
Great Lakes Howard Wolpe is currently traveling to the region 
and looks forward to working in collaboration with the Great 
Lakes envoys from the European Union and other bilateral 
partners to advance the work Obasanjo and Mkapa have started. 
 
- -  Despite political progress, we remain deeply concerned 
by the security situation in the Great Lakes region, which 
remains tenuous, and the humanitarian situation, which has 
deteriorated significantly.  The population displacements and 
the escalation of human rights abuses, including sexual and 
gender-based violence, must be addressed. 
 
If raised: 
 
- -  Additionally, we remain seriously concerned with the 
Lord's Resistance Army's LRA's continued presence in 
northeastern DRC and expansion into the Central African 
Republic and Southern Sudan and the resulting attacks on the 
civilian population. 
 
Questions: 
 
-  -   What are the prospects for a lasting peace? 
 
- - What is the best role in the region for a UN mediator? 
 
- - In your opinion, how should this Council best approach 
President Kabila to ensure impunity is addressed within his 
armed forces? 
 
- - What role can African leaders play? 
 
- - How can this Council best support effective mediation in 
the future and promote the peace process in the region? What 
role can neighbors play in the peace process? 
 
 
If raised: 
 
--  Please tell us more about the UN's approach to addressing 
the threat to the region posed by the LRA.
