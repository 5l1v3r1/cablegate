SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST TO MOVE ENGINEERS FROM UNMIS TO 
UNAMID FOR 90 DAYS 
 
¶1.  PURPOSE:  This is an action request.  The Department asks 
Embassies Islamabad and Cairo to demarche host governments at 
the highest appropriate level to support the United Nations' 
request that an appropriate number of engineers currently 
deployed by Pakistan and Egypt for the United Nations Mission 
in Sudan (UNMIS) move to the hybrid United Nations-African 
Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) for 90 days or longer, with 
the understanding that the engineers will return to UNMIS 
after this period.  The purpose of the move is to provide 
more engineers to build more infrastructure in UNAMID to 
allow for faster absorption of additional troops into UNAMID. 
 Currently, insufficient UN infrastructure, accommodation, 
and logistics is one of the largest impediments to UNAMID 
deployment.  This increase in engineering capacity is part of 
the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations' enhanced 
deployment plan to allow for 80 percent deployment of UNAMID 
by the end of the year. 
 
¶2.  DEADLINE:  We would appreciate a response from posts by 
Wednesday 28 May 2008. 
 
¶3.  BACKGROUND:  The Department wishes to assist the United 
Nations as much as possible in the rapid deployment of 
UNAMID, as it is one of the Department's highest priorities. 
Successful deployment of UNAMID is a critical part of our 
strategy for peace in Darfur, which also includes provision 
of humanitarian aid, support for the UN-AU-led Darfur 
political process and the immediate cessation of all 
hostilities, including cross-border attacks between Sudan and 
Chad.  At the same time, we are pushing for the 
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between 
north and south Sudan and for UNMIS's proactive support for 
this implementation, particularly in the Abyei area.  While 
we wish to do all that is possible to push UNAMID's 
deployment, we are mindful of the need to balance this 
support with consideration of the needs of UNMIS.
