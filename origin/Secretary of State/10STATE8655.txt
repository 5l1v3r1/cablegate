¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds that 
it possesses no credible information of gross violations of 
human rights at this time by the members of the Iraqi 
Ministry of Interior listed below.  Department strongly 
suggests that visa applications for these individuals be 
filed with as much lead time as possible to allow for 
additional processing procedures that may be required.  Note 
that if, at any time, the Embassy becomes aware of any 
information regarding incidents which could be deemed to be 
credible information of a gross violation of human rights by 
these individuals, the Embassy should so inform the 
Department.
