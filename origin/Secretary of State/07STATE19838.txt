¶1. SUMMARY: The Department requests action embassies to 
encourage host country leadership at the highest 
appropriate level to press the Government of Guinea (GOG) 
to seek a resolution of the crisis, bring an end to the 
violence, promote dialogue, and seek a civilian-led 
constitutional transition plan. 
 
Objectives 
------------------ 
¶2. In addition to the objectives and background, the 
Department encourages embassies to draw upon the tone and 
points delivered by Embassy Conakry in reftel A. 
Objectives are as follows: 
 
--If the government has not already done so, encourage 
host country government to issue a public statement 
expressing its concerns about the reports of human rights 
violations and denouncing the GOG's military curfew. 
 
--Encourage the host country government to advocate that 
the highest levels of the GOG end the current military 
curfew immediately, so that all parties may return to 
dialogue. 
 
--Persuade host country government that the only durable 
resolution to the Guinea crisis is a civilian-led 
constitutional transition. 
 
--Convey to host country government that the USG believes 
that civil society has legitimate concerns that they are 
raising about Guinea's long poor governance and 
mismanagement of the country's vast natural wealth. 
 
Background 
----------------- 
 
¶3. The political crisis in Guinea continues to escalate. 
After nationwide protests turned violent, the GOG on 
February 12 declared a "State of Siege", and imposed a 
draconian curfew.  As noted in reftels, there have been 
numerous deaths and significant economic damage.  Popular 
discontent and frustration may be growing beyond the 
control of the government, military, unions, civil 
society and opposition parties. 
 
¶4. The USG's position is to support a peaceful civilian- 
led transition.  We have sent clear and unambiguous 
messages to all political and military leaders in Guinea 
to end the violence against civilians, that a military 
takeover is unacceptable, and could negatively affect 
U.S. foreign assistance and our longstanding, friendly 
cooperation with Guinea. 
 
¶5. Contrary to the GOG's assertions that the unions and 
outside influences have instigated the current crisis, we 
strongly believe that the unions are expressing 
widespread and long-held popular frustrations with 
Guinea's poor governance and the mismanagement of its 
vast natural wealth.  The leadership vacuum created by 
President Conte's advanced age, ill health, and self- 
interested political advisers has left the Guinea's 
institutions of government profoundly dysfunctional. 
Contrary to the interpretation of some, U.S. support for 
change within Guinea's constitution is not/not an 
endorsement of individuals or particular parties. Article 
34 of Guinea's constitution allows for the vacation of 
power from the president and calls for the National 
Assembly President, as interim head of state, to oversee 
democratic presidential elections. 
 
¶6. The regrettable military curfew imposed under the 
"state of siege" hinders dialogue and violates Guinea's 
international obligations to ensure the free movement of 
 
STATE 00019838  002 OF 002 
 
 
diplomats.  The growing restrictions on civil liberties 
and weakening of democratic institutions have already 
increased under the state of partial military rule. 
 
¶7. While the military curfew may provide a temporary 
respite to the violence, the situation is not tenable. 
Only broad-based dialogue, entered in good faith and 
leading to a civilian-led political transition, can end 
the current crisis and improve democratic governance. 
Simply put, the people of Guinea are fed up. 
 
¶8. The USG will continue to engage ECOWAS to take a more 
proactive role.  We are looking to the AU and certain 
regional governments that have entr,e with the Government 
of Guinea for assistance in pressing Conte to step aside. 
In particular Ghanaian President Kufour, Malian President 
Toure, Colonel Vall of Mauritania, President Kabbah and 
King Mohammed VI of Morocco have particularly strong, 
personal relationships with President Conte, so we are 
encouraging them to step into the gap personally. 
 
Point of Contact 
------------------- 
 
¶9. Please contact AF/W Deji Okediji at (202) 647-3469 or 
via email for any necessary further background 
information. Embassy is requested to report the results 
by cable to AF/W at earliest opportunity.
