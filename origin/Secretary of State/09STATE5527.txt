Classified By: WHA Thomas A. Shannon for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C)  I want to congratulate you and your team for Embassy 
Managua,s superb reporting on the November 9 municipal 
elections and their aftermath.  The steady flow of 
informative and useful cables (reftels) preceding and 
following the elections gave Washington recipients a clear 
vision of what was happening on the ground.  By mobilizing 
all appropriate Embassy resources, you provided a 
comprehensive picture of the election and its implications 
for the U.S; and facilitated our efforts to fashion an 
appropriate response to the allegations of electoral fraud. 
We look forward to further high quality reporting as we 
continue to address the challenges posed by the elections to 
our bilateral relationship.
