UAE AFGHANISTAN PAKISTAN ENVOY SHAMSI 
 
¶1.  Please deliver the following message from Special 
Representative Holbrooke to Ambassador Shamsi.  Signed 
original will follow.  Original copies will be sent to German 
Special Representative Muetzelburg and Italian Special 
Representative Ianucci. 
 
¶2.  Begin Text: 
 
Dear Ambassador Shamsi: 
 
Congratulations on your recent appointment as Special 
Representative of the United Arab Emirates for Afghanistan 
and Pakistan.  The UAE has played a key role advancing our 
shared goal of bringing security and stability to Afghanistan 
and Pakistan.  The decision to appoint you as Special 
Representative demonstrates your government's commitment to 
working with the international community on this critically 
important undertaking. 
 
The purpose of the Afghanistan Pakistan Support Group, as 
this group of Special Representatives is known, is to bring 
about solutions to the root causes of destabilization in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The Special Representatives all 
are empowered by their governments to direct policy towards 
this end, a crucial element of the group's purpose and 
efficacy.  We first met in Munich on April 1, where we 
cleared the way for the creation of the European Gendarme 
Force Afghanistan training initiative.  During the Pakistan 
Donors Conference in Tokyo, we identified a strategy for 
maximizing the potential of the $5 billion in donor pledges. 
On May 18 in Istanbul, we set in motion development of a 
comprehensive inventory and monitoring process for assistance 
activities in Afghanistan, starting with agriculture.  Our 
next meeting will be in Trieste, Italy, on June 26; we are 
also discussing holding a meeting in Kabul. 
 
I encourage you to contact German Special Representative 
Bernd Mtzelburg, the chair and convening authority of the 
Afghanistan Pakistan Support Group, as soon as possible. 
Congratulations once again, and I look forward to working 
with you in the coming months on this top priority.  If you 
can visit Washington, I would look forward to welcoming you. 
 
 
Please give my regards to Foreign Minister Abdullah. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Richard Holbrooke 
Special Representative for 
      Afghanistan and Pakistan
