UN SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON VIOLENCE IN 
ABYEI 
 
 
¶1.  PURPOSE:  This is an action request.  The Department 
authorizes USUN to begin consultations with the United 
Kingdom and France and subsequently the other Security 
Council member states on the following draft UN Security 
Council Presidential Statement on recent violence in 
Abyei: 
 
 
The Security Council expresses its grave concern about the 
recent violence and escalating tensions in the Abyei 
region in Sudan and the resulting casualties and 
displacement of thousands of civilians. 
 
The Security Council demands that the Sudanese Armed 
Forces (SAF) and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) 
immediately cease hostilities, abide by the May 18, 2008, 
ceasefire agreement, and withdraw forces from the area. 
 
The Security Council urges all parties to allow the United 
Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) to have full freedom of 
movement in the Abyei area to reduce tensions and prevent 
further violence.  The Council reiterates its call on all 
parties to support, protect, and facilitate all 
humanitarian operations and personnel in the Sudan. 
 
The Security Council urges the parties to implement the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) fully, prevent further 
violence and immediately work to end the political 
deadlock by establishing interim borders and an interim 
administration. 
 
The Security Council further calls for the release of the 
local oil revenues intended to develop the Abyei region, 
as called for by the CPA. 
 
¶2.  BACKGROUND:  Clashes between the SPLA and SAF began on 
May 13, 2008, at a police check point in Abyei town.  It 
appeared to be localized fighting between individuals and 
later escalated to exchanges of fire and military 
confrontation between the SPLA and SAF.  UNMIS helped 
implement a May 15 compromise to cease hostilities.  After 
renewed fighting May 16-17, the Ceasefire Joint Monitoring 
Commission (CJMC) brokered a ceasefire whereby both 
parties agreed to withdraw forces from the area.  More 
than 100,000 people were affected by the conflict, 
including 50,000 new internally displaced persons (IDPs). 
The oil-rich and ethnically important area of Abyei has 
been long contested by both the North and South, making it 
a significant unresolved issue in implementation of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and an area greatly at risk 
for large-scale violence.
