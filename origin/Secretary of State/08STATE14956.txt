SUBJECT: USG QUESTIONS ON UAE JANUARY 31 NOTICE ON BANK 
SEPAH 
 
REF: A) NOTE VERBALE 31 JANUARY 2007 
 
 ¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 
four. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  On 31 January, the UAE notified the UNSCR 1737 
Sanctions Committee of its intention to authorize-under 
paragraph 15 of UNSCR 1737-payments due under contracts with 
Bank Sepah entered into prior to the listing of Bank Sepah in 
Annex I of UNSCR 1747.  Washington would like to request that 
the UAE provide more information to the Committee and the 
U.S. regarding these payments and the underlying contracts in 
order to confirm that the authorization of such payments is 
fully consistent with the terms of paragraph 15 of UNSCR 1737. 
 
¶3.  (U)  In accordance with paragraph 15 of UNSCR 1737 and 
paragraph 4 of 1747, UAE may authorize these payments as 
early as February 14.  We wish to immediately convey our 
request to the UAE, prior to the payment of any funds, and 
ask the UAE to delay authorization or withdraw its 
notification until more information is provided on the origin 
of money used to process these payments. 
 
---------- 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶4.  (U)  Washington requests Mission approach appropriate 
Emirati officials to discuss this issue drawing from 
paragraphs two and three and the objectives outlined below. 
 
--  Inquire about the dates of the issuances of the letters 
of credit to ensure that they were agreed before the listing 
of Bank Sepah. 
 
--  Ask for additional details - prior to the payment of any 
funds - about the nature of the underlying goods to ensure 
that the letters of credit are not related to any of the 
prohibited items, materials, equipment, goods, technologies, 
or related assistance that could be involved in 
proliferation-related activities, as set out in resolution 
¶1737. 
 
--  Request information about the parties (including the 
names and locations) involved in these transactions to 
determine whether they have links to any UNSCR-sanctioned 
entities or individuals. 
 
--  Reiterate USG concerns regarding any financial 
transactions with the UAE-based branches of Bank Melli and 
Bank Saderat, encourage the UAEG to apply enhanced vigilance 
in monitoring the activities of these banks, specifically 
with UNSCR 1747/EO 13382 designated entity Bank Sepah. 
 
--  Request that the UAE confirm that the funds to be 
unfrozen and paid to the creditors are currently within the 
UAE and, if not, to indicate the source of the funds.
