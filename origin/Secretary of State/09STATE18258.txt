REF: A. SIMONOFF-GARUCKIS EMAIL OF 2/25/09 
     ¶B. SCHEDLBAUER-GARUCKIS EMAIL OF 2/24/09 
 
¶1. Department appreciates USUN's work on the Special Tribunal 
for Lebanon Management Committee (STL-MC) and provides the 
following guidance for use in the next STL-MC meeting, 
currently scheduled for February 27. 
 
¶2. After reviewing REF A and B regarding a possible change in 
Prosecutor Bellemare's terms and conditions of employment, 
Department remains concerned that agreeing to the proposed 
change would set an unhealthy precedent for future tribunals 
and could result in large-scale, productivity-sapping and 
costly negotiations by prosecutors or other senior staff at 
existing tribunals to seek similar adjustments to their 
remuneration package.  Considering the negative implications 
of a change in employment terms and conditions for Bellemare, 
USUN should reject such a proposal.
