DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, 
 
I GREATLY APPRECIATE RECEIVING YOUR KIND NOTE 
CONGRATULATING ME ON THE SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT WITH SOVIET 
GENERAL SECRETARY GORBACHEV.  WE BELIEVE THOSE MEETINGS 
INDEED MARK A HISTORIC MOMENT IN ADVANCING INTERNATIONAL 
SECURITY, AS WELL AS IN ESTABLISHING A MORE STABLE AND 
CONSTRUCTIVE US RELATIONSHIP.  THE INF TREATY THAT I 
SIGNED WITH THE GENERAL SECRETARY IS CLEARLY A LANDMARK 
ACHIEVEMENT: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY OUR TWO 
NATIONS HAVE AGREED TO REDUCE OUR NUCLEAR ARSENALS, NOT 
JUST LIMIT THEIR GROWTH.  AND THERE IS THE PROMISE OF 
STILL GREATER PROGRESS IN PLACING EAST-WEST RELATIONS ON 
A SOUNDER FOOTING. 
 
MY TALKS WITH GORBACHEV WERE QUITE FRANK AND CANDID -- 
NEITHER OF US ATTEMPTED TO MASK OUR DISAGREEMENTS.  THE 
GENERAL SECRETARY UNDERSTANDS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR 
RELATIONSHIP CAN RESULT ONLY IF WE SERIOUSLY ADDRESS THE 
ENTIRE FOUR-PART AGENDA: HUMAN RIGHTS, REGIONAL CONCERNS, 
BILATERAL MATTERS AND ARMS REDUCTIONS.  WE HAD A FRANK 
AND VERY LIVELY EXCHANGE ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES, AND 
WHILE WE DID NOT MAKE BREAKTHROUGHS IN EVERY AREA, I AM 
ENCOURAGED BY THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH GORBACHEV IS 
CONSIDERING OUR POINT OF VIEW. 
 
BEST WISHES FOR A HAPPY NEW YEAR. 
 
SINCERELY, RONALD REAGAN
