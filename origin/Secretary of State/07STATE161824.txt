SUBJECT: SUDAN - UNAMID DEMARCHE REQUEST TO FOREIGN 
MINISTER MORATINOS 
 
REF: USUN 1052 
 
¶1.  Purpose and Objective:   This is an action request. 
Embassy Madrid is requested to make a high-level demarche by 
the Ambassador to Foreign Minister Moratinos requesting Spain 
to provide helicopter (number 1 priority) or transport 
support for the United Nation-African Union Mission in Darfur 
(UNAMID).  The details of the support requirements are listed 
below. 
 
The equipment critically required is as follows: 
 
      -- 6 Attack helicopters for the heavy support package 
      -- 6 Utility helicopters for the heavy support package 
      -- 12 Utility helicopters for UNAMID deployment 
      -- 2 Transport companies for UNAMID deployment 
 
¶2.  Background:  Timely deployment of the United 
Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) is one the 
Department of State,s top priorities.  UNAMID currently 
lacks critical aviation and transportation assets.  UNAMID 
will be a predominantly African force and has received 
generous offers of contributions from many African infantry 
units (including Rwanda, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Burkina 
Faso, Mali, and Malawi).  Nevertheless, UNAMID still lacks 
commitments for critical force multipliers/enablers, which 
will likely come from non-African troop contributors, 
including units to provide adequate aviation and 
transportation support assets.  The Department wishes to 
assist the UN as much as possible in the successful and rapid 
deployment of UNAMID.  Aviation and heavy transportation 
assets are essential to UNAMID,s success given the need for 
mobility in such a large territory with difficult terrain. 
Deployment of a robust, effective hybrid force is a critical 
part of our strategy for sustainable peace in Darfur.  If 
Spain is able to respond positively to this request, Spanish 
officials should be asked to bring its capabilities to the 
urgent attention of the UN's Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations (DPKO) in New York and to engage DPKO in direct 
discussions of the UN's precise requirements. 
 
UN SYG Ban recently reported Spain,s willingness to consider 
providing helicopter assets to UNAMID during a meeting with 
Ambassador Khalilzad in New York. 
 
¶3.  Action Request:  Embassy Madrid is requested to demarche 
FM Moratinos requesting Spanish aircraft support for UNAMID. 
UNAMID,s aircraft needs are great and we urge Spain to 
provide helicopter or transport aircraft to support this 
mission.
