 ¶1.  The Department of State has reviewed its files and finds 
that as of August 1, 2007 a Colonel Ngoga was mentioned in a 
cable identified  as 99060031454INS7454col; Origine ATS-INA; 
06/03/1999.  The cable reported a copy of an e-mail sent to a 
selected in-government group from a disgruntled journalist 
who has since left the country and is now working for VOA. 
He outlines the extensive corruption in the Rwandan 
government by a select group.  Among others accused of 
various unlawful activities, a Col. Ngoga is accused of 
stealing cows belonging to the Abagogwe people.  He and 
others accused of this crime were placed under house arrest 
for two weeks but nothing more became of the investigation 
nor punishment.  Vetting authenticator noted that although 
the name Ngoga appeared many times in cables sent, this was 
the only cable where the investigator had a reasonable doubt 
as to what part, if any, he may have played in this 
operation.  Also this report was simply a written accusation 
made and no proof of guilt was established. 
 
¶2.  Therefore, the Department of State has reviewed its files 
and finds that as of August 1, 2007, it possesses no credible 
information of gross violations of human rights by the 
following canditate for ACOTA Training nor has the Department 
of State as of August 1, 2007 found credible information of 
gross violations of human rights by the 35th Infantry 
Battalion of the 301st Infantry Brigade as a unit: 
 
Name: Alexis Kayumba Ngoga 
Rank: Lieutenant Colonel 
DOB:  06 February, 1967 
Training Date:    06 August, 2007 
 
Name: 35th Infantry Battalion of the 301st Infantry Brigade 
Training Dates:   06 August to 21 September, 2007 
 
¶3.  Post using its discretion is, therefore, authorized to 
forward the following verification message:  "Embassy 
verifies that as of August 1, 2007, the Department of State 
possesses no credible information of gross violations of 
human rights by the Rwandan candidate of the Infantry 
Battalion of the 301st Infantry Brigade for ACOTA training 
listed above.  This cable completes the joint human rights 
vetting approval process for the officer and unit cited." 
Note that if at any time Embassy becomes aware of any 
information regarding incidents which could be deemed to be 
credible information of grass violation of human rights by 
the personnel or unit involved in this training, Embassy 
should so inform the Department.
