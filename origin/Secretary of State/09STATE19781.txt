Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
Thank you as well, Ambassador Urstad, for your comprehensive 
and balanced report.  We agree that Serbia continues to take 
positive steps along the path of democratic reform despite 
the political and economic challenges that 2008 presented. 
This has been facilitated by the collaborative relationship 
your mission enjoys with the government of Serbia, and by the 
hard work and dedication of your staff. 
 
We value greatly the continued work of the Mission in law 
enforcement reform, accountability, and transparency.  We are 
encouraged to hear that there is good cooperation with the 
Ministry of Interior.  The positive results of the public 
perception survey on citizens' view of the police highlight 
the important work of both the Mission and Serbian Ministries 
in this critical area. 
 
Serbia still faces daunting challenges with corruption and 
organized crime, and we view the Mission's assistance in 
these areas as essential. Serbia's establishment of the 
Anti-corruption Agency is a positive step, and we hope that 
the authorities will provide the necessary support. 
 
We applaud the Mission's progress in rule of law, including 
support for comprehensive reform of the courts, judiciary, 
and prosecution. Implementation of legislative changes 
adopted in 2008 will consolidate this progress. 
 
We commend the mission for the excellent work it is doing to 
help Serbia meet international human rights standards and to 
fight discrimination and intolerance. We take note of your 
point regarding the unresolved problem of refugees and IDPs, 
and call on countries in the region to live up to commitments 
made in the Sarajevo Declaration of 2005. We congratulate 
Serbia on the appointment of a National Coordinator for 
Combating Trafficking, and look forward to adoption of the 
National Action Plan in 2009. 
 
We welcome the progress Serbia has shown in its cooperation 
with the ICTY over the past year. We hope that this will 
continue, and we congratulate the Mission for its role in 
facilitating this cooperation. 
 
Ambassador Urstad, the work of your Mission is helping Serbia 
advance its aim of Euro-Atlantic integration. While 
challenges remain, such as implementing the numerous laws 
passed in recent months, the trend is positive.  We value the 
contribution the Mission has made to this process. In 
closing, let me wish you and your highly competent and 
dedicated staff all success in your future endeavors, and 
thank you for the hard work you put in during your time in 
Belgrade. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
