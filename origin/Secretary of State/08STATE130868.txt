SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - ZIMBABWE 
 
¶1.  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of 
the risks of traveling to Zimbabwe due to 
deteriorating safety and security conditions, and 
urges them to carefully consider their need to 
travel there.  The political instability and 
economic crisis in Zimbabwe have resulted in small- 
scale civil demonstrations and riots by military 
personnel, and a general deterioration of government 
services and infrastructure, including the near 
collapse of the country's public health system.  The 
Department of State therefore urges U.S. citizens 
visiting Zimbabwe to closely monitor the situation, 
keep travel documents up to date, and have 
contingency plans ready for their own personal 
health, safety and security. 
 
¶2.  Americans travelling to Zimbabwe should avoid 
crowds.  Zimbabwean authorities may forcefully 
disband demonstrations by labor unions and other 
civil groups.  American citizens should avoid all 
public demonstrations and protests. 
 
¶3.  The public health system in Zimbabwe no longer 
provides even basic services due to a lack of staff, 
electricity, clean water, and medical supplies. 
Americans who fall ill while in Zimbabwe may find it 
difficult to find treatment.  In late 2008, the 
deterioration of the health system impaired the 
government's ability to respond to a dangerous 
cholera outbreak which has killed hundreds of 
people.  Cholera is a potentially fatal bacterial 
infection of the intestine that causes severe 
diarrhea and dehydration.  The disease is spread 
through untreated sewage and contaminated drinking 
water.  The latest outbreak in Zimbabwe has exposed 
a shortage of potable water throughout the country 
and overwhelmed medical resources.  Travelers to 
Zimbabwe should drink boiled or bottled water, use 
boiled or bottled water in food preparation, and 
regularly wash their hands with a sanitizer. 
 
¶4.  For additional information on cholera, American 
citizens may refer to the CDC's website at 
http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/dfbmd/disease_listi ng/chol 
era_gi.html.  American citizens experiencing 
symptoms associated with cholera, such as severe 
diarrhea, should seek immediate medical attention. 
However, Harare's three public hospitals have 
virtually shut down.  Private clinics, while 
operational, often lack staff, electricity, water, 
and medical supplies.  As a result, there is no 
guarantee that travelers who become ill will be able 
to obtain adequate emergency medical treatment in 
Zimbabwe. 
 
¶5.  For the latest security information, Americans 
traveling abroad should regularly monitor the 
Department's Internet web site at 
http://travel.state.gov where the current Worldwide 
Caution, Travel Warnings, and Travel Alerts can be 
found.  Up-to date information on security can also 
be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in 
the United States and Canada or, for callers outside 
the United States and Canada, a regular toll line at 
1-202-501-4444.  These numbers are available from 
8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through 
Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).  Americans 
are also encouraged to read the Country Specific 
Information for Zimbabwe, available at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶6.  U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad are 
 
STATE 00130868  002 OF 002 
 
 
encouraged to register with the nearest U.S. Embassy 
or Consulate through the State Department's travel 
registration web site at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/ui/ so 
that they can obtain updated information on travel 
and security.  Americans without internet access may 
register directly with the nearest U.S. Embassy or 
Consulate.  By registering, American citizens make 
it easier for the Embassy or Consulate to contact 
them in case of emergency.  For additional 
information, please refer to "A Safe Trip Abroad" 
found at http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶7.  U.S. citizens may contact the American Citizens 
Services Unit of the U.S. Embassy in Harare for 
further information.  The Embassy is located on 172 
Herbert Chitepo Avenue, Harare.  Telephone 263-4- 
250-593/4/5, e-mail consularharare@state.gov.  The 
Embassy's Internet home page address is 
http://harare.usembassy.gov. 
 
¶8.  Minimize considered.
