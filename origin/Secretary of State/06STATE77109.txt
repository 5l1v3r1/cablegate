¶2. BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Dear Miguel: 
 
Thank you for your letter informing me about Spain's 
initiatives to promote security and development in Africa. 
 
 
 
The continent faces some great challenges, and your 
leadership and involvement in addressing those challenges 
is extremely important. 
 
I am impressed that you have already discussed  these 
matters with the Chairperson of the African Union. The 
African Union and AU Commission Chairperson Alpha Omar 
Konare are valued partners in our work toward a freer, 
safer, and more prosperous Africa. We are currently 
working with Congress to designate a U.S. Ambassador to 
the African Union, and we expect the African Union will 
open a representative office in Washington, D.C. this 
summer. 
 
 
I would like to collaborate further wiyh you on these 
matters of mutual interest, and I will have my Assistant 
Secretary of State for African Affairs Dr. Jendayi Frazer 
 
SIPDIS 
contact her counterpart in your government to arrange for 
a joint meeting. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Condoleezza Rice
