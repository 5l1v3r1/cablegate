REF: HACKETT-SIMONOFF EMAIL OF 3/4/09 
 
¶1. (U) Department provides the following guidance for Agenda 
Item 3 of the 35th meeting of the Management Committee of the 
Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL): 
 
----------------- 
Tax Reimbursement 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) USUN may support the proposal put forward to 
reimburse STL judges for taxes paid on salaries.  Department 
understands that this proposal will only impact U.S. citizen 
judges, as the United States is the sole nation to impose 
taxes of the wages of its citizens when employed in 
recognized international organizations.  Other delegations 
should be made aware that tax reimbursement for U.S. citizen 
judges will be charged against the USG contribution to the 
STL. 
 
------------ 
Remuneration 
------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) USUN should not/not support the proposal to increase 
the remuneration of STL judges based on increases applied to 
the "professional" of higher category salaries of UN 
employees.  Department notes that pay increases for judges 
are done through the actions of the UNGA and that attempts to 
circumvent this system would create a dangerous precedent for 
other tribunals.  Additional detail has been provided in REF
