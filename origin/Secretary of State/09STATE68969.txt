SUBJECT: KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN FOR 
AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: A) MUSSOMELI/SWART EMAIL 22 JUNE 09, B) KABUL 1427 
 
¶1. The Department is pleased post found the recent 
visit of the Knowledge Management (KM) training team 
useful (reftel B). IRM fully appreciates the vital 
importance of effective knowledge management to the 
success of our integrated diplomatic, development and 
defense assistance efforts underway in Afghanistan. 
 
¶2. In anticipation of the assignment of the three KM 
contractors requested by post, and in reviewing the 
issues detailed in reftel (B), the Department will work 
with post to identify and prioritize the most urgent KM 
support requirements. Focus will initially be on KM 
requirements of the front office. Based on the recent 
KM team visit, requirements seem to include information 
on mission-wide activities by region, elections, and 
improved visibility of PRT reporting. A second 
objective is training mission personnel on various KM 
tools already available. Please confirm if this 
accurately reflects mission KM priorities. 
 
¶3. On the technology front, IRM will ship 20 
workstations and KVM switches for use with a group of 
AID/Kabul users as discussed in ref (A). This 
deployment is in advance of the planned 250 workstations 
to enhance collaboration among Kabul Country Team 
members. In addition to the 20 workstations, IRM will 
send a TDY IT specialist to work with post's IT staff on 
the deployment of these devices to AID/Kabul users and 
to ease their transition to OpenNet. (USAID declined at 
this time our request to provide TDY expertise on USAID 
applications to facilitate the transition of their 
users.) The intent of this initial deployment is to 
gain an understanding of AID/Kabul's business 
requirements and thereby minimizing any disruptions to 
their important work. Septel will advise shipping 
details of the initial 20 workstations and deployment of 
the TDY specialist. 
 
¶4. Prior to the decision to provide OpenNet 
workstations for AID/Kabul users, the Department 
carefully considered deploying the post-to-post 
connection that has been used at approximately 40 posts 
under the Joint Management Council (JMC) initiative. 
The Department rejected this option since a) experience 
has shown AID users of OpenNet still require an OpenNet 
logon and password for access to many applications; b) 
it elevates the security risks with local non-Trusted 
Internet Connections (TIC); and c) it does not move the 
U.S. Mission to a single cohesive platform. 
Additionally the proposed short-cut routing solution has 
not been maintained in over four (4) years and 
consequently not available for the current release of 
Microsoft Exchange. 
 
¶5. IRM and the Department look forward to working on 
Post's KM priorities and enhancing the capabilities of 
the Country Team and the mission in Afghanistan.
