SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - YEMEN 
 
¶1. This Travel Warning is being issued to inform American 
citizens that the Department of State has lifted the 
ordered departure status of non-emergency American 
employees and adult family members of all employees at the 
U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen.  The Department recommends 
that American citizens defer non-essential travel to 
Yemen.  American citizens remaining in Yemen despite this 
warning should monitor the U.S. Embassy website at 
http://yemen.usembassy.gov and should make contingency 
emergency plans.  This supersedes the Travel Warning for 
Yemen issued April 7, 2008. 
 
¶2. The Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens 
defer non-essential travel to Yemen at this time.  The 
security threat level remains high due to terrorist 
activities in Yemen.  Several explosions targeted the 
embassy compound on March 18.  The explosions injured 
several Yemeni citizens, including government security 
personnel and schoolchildren.  Embassy employees have been 
advised to exercise caution when choosing restaurants, 
hotels or visiting tourist areas in Sanaa in order to 
avoid large gatherings of foreigners and expatriates.  In 
addition, unofficial travel outside of the capital is not 
authorized at this time. 
 
¶3. U.S. citizens who travel to or remain in Yemen despite 
this warning should exercise caution and take prudent 
security measures, including maintaining a high level of 
vigilance, avoiding crowds and demonstrations, keeping a 
low profile, varying times and routes for all travel, and 
ensuring travel documents are current.  American citizens 
in Yemen are advised to exercise particular caution at 
locations frequented by foreigners countrywide including 
restaurants and hotels frequented by expatriates.  From 
time to time, the Embassy may restrict official Americans 
from restaurants, hotels, or shopping areas.  The 
Department of State strongly encourages American citizens 
to consult the most recent Warden Messages 

(http://yemen.usembassy.gov/service.html) 
 
to get up-to-date information on security conditions. 
Americans who believe they are being followed or 
threatened while driving in urban centers should proceed 
as quickly as possible to the nearest police station or 
major intersection and request assistance from the 
officers in the blue-and-white police cars stationed 
there. 
 
¶4. The Department remains concerned about possible attacks 
by extremist individuals or groups against U.S. citizens, 
facilities, businesses, and perceived interests.  On 
January 17, 2008, suspected al-Qa'ida operatives ambushed 
a tourist convoy in the eastern Hadramout Governorate, 
killing two Belgians.  On July 2, 2007, suspected al- 
Qa'ida operatives carried out a vehicle-borne explosive 
device attack on tourists at the Belquis Temple in Marib, 
which resulted in the deaths of eight Spanish tourists and 
two Yemenis.  The targeting of tourist sites by al-Qa'ida 
may represent an escalation in terror tactics in Yemen. 
On February 3, 2006, 23 convicts, including known 
affiliates of al-Qa'ida, escaped from a high-security 
prison in the capital city, Sanaa, some of whom remain at 
large.  Two of the escapees were later killed in vehicle- 
based suicide attacks on oil facilities near Mukalla and 
Marib on September 15, 2006.  Those attacks were followed 
by the arrest the next day in Sanaa of four suspected al 
Qa'ida operatives, who had stockpiled explosives and 
weapons. 
 
¶5. Since January 2007, the Government of Yemen had been 
battling al Houthi rebels in and around the northern 
governorate of Saada.  While foreigners have not been 
 
STATE 00086597  002 OF 002 
 
 
targeted, hundreds of soldiers and civilians have been 
killed in the violence.  U.S. citizens traveling in Yemen 
should be aware that local authorities occasionally place 
restrictions on the travel of foreigners to parts of the 
country experiencing unrest.  In addition, the U.S. 
Embassy itself often restricts travel of official 
personnel to the tribal areas north and east of Sanaa, 
such as the governorates of Amran, Al Jawf, Hajja, Marib, 
Saada, and Shabwa.  Travelers should be in contact with 
the Embassy for up-to-date information on such 
restrictions. 
 
¶6. U.S. citizens should register at the Consular Section 
of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa and enroll in the warden 
system (emergency alert network) to obtain updated 
information on travel and security in Yemen.  This can be 
done online prior to arrival in Yemen at 
 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs 
 
¶7. The U.S. Embassy is located at Dhahr Himyar Zone, 
Sheraton Hotel District, P.O. Box 22347.  The telephone 
number of the Consular Section is (967) (1) 755-2000, 
extension 2153 or 2266.  The fax number is (967) (1) 303- 
¶175.  The after hours emergency number is (967) (1) 755- 
2000 (press zero for extension) or (967) 733213509.  From 
time to time the Embassy may temporarily close or suspend 
public services for security reasons.  Emergency 
assistance to U.S. citizens during non-business hours (or 
when public access is restricted) is available through 
Embassy duty personnel. 
 
¶8. Current information on travel and security in Yemen may 
be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1-888- 
407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, from 
outside the United States and Canada, 1-202-501-4444. 
U.S. citizens should consult the Country Specific 
Information for Yemen and the Worldwide Caution on the 
Department's Internet site at http://travel.state.gov 
Up-to-date information on security conditions can also be 
addressed at
