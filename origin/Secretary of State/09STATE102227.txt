SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050191953 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a pre-license check on application 050191953 for 
the export of night vision devices (NVDs) to Spain.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  sensitive commodity and potential for 
diversion and misuse. Also, foreign consignee, Suministros 
Peninsulares Importados S.L. (SPI) has not appeared on 
previous licenses nor have the company's bona fides been 
verified by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION MADRID:  Post is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate officials to determine if the Spanish Army 
ordered the NVDs from SPI and if so, verify the exact amount 
and dollar value, and that the items will be used for the 
purpose stated on the license.  PM/DTCC also requests that 
post conducts a site visit to SPI in order to provide 
Department with an assessment of its business operations and 
on-site security.  Finally, post is asked to assess whether 
the company appears to be a reliable recipient of United 
States Munitions List (USML) items.  If a site visit is not 
possible, please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
SPANISH ARMY 
 
--Can the Spanish Army confirm the existence of a contract or 
purchase order with SPI for the full quantity and dollar 
value of these image intensifier tubes (IITs)? 
 
--Can the Spanish Army confirm end-use of the IITs (to 
replace intensifiers in existing AN/PVS-14s)? 
 
SPI 
 
--Does the company have an existing contract with the Spanish 
Army for this proposed transaction?  Please verify the 
precise number of IITs sought by the Spanish Army. 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item?  Will SPI 
retain positive control over the IITs at all times prior to 
their transfer to the Spanish Army? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers 
and re-exports? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on the 
unauthorized stockpiling of USML items? 
END ACTION
