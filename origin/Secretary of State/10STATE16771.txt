SUBJECT: THANKS FOR OUTSTANDING VISIT SUPPORT 
 
Dear Jim and Bob, 
 
Thank you for the outstanding support that you provided to me 
and my team during our visit to Madrid on January 27 and 28. 
I believe that these twice yearly consultations with our 
European Union partners are crucially important for our 
overall policy coordination in Africa. 
 
The amount of preparation done by Embassy Madrid and by USEU 
was obvious given how well the meeting went.  Please be sure 
to also pass along my gratitude to our driver and expeditor, 
who both worked long hours in support of our visit. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Johnnie Carson 
Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
