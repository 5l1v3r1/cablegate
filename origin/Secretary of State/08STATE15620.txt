SUBJECT: SOMALIA -- TALKING POINTS FOR FEBRUARY 15 
CONSULTATIONS 
 
Â¶1.  USUN is instructed to draw from the following talking 
points during their February 15 consultations on Somalia. 
 
Begin points: 
 
-- The United States continues to have the utmost concern 
over the ongoing crisis in Somalia. 
 
-- The United States is grateful to the AU Mission in Somalia 
for its vital role in trying to bring 
stability to Somalia.  We support the extension of its 
mandate. 
 
-- The United States commends the 1800 Ugandan and 850 
Burundi peacekeepers already on the ground in Somalia.  We 
thank the Government of Uganda and President Museveni for his 
public commitment of an additional 1600 peacekeepers to 
bolster the mission.  We urge all AU members who have made 
public commitments to the mission to fulfill their pledge 
and deploy as soon as possible.  We encourage all AU members 
to consider contributing to this important African 
mission. Likewise, the United States urges all UN member 
states to provide financial resources, personnel, 
equipment and logistical support so these forces and future 
troop pledges can deploy as soon as possible. 
 
-- We would especially like to acknowledge the important work 
that the Ugandan forces have carried out in providing 
medical care for Somali citizens, even though it is not part 
of their mandate requirements.  The medical team has 
helped hundreds of Somalis. 
 
-- The United States is disappointed that the Secretary 
General's report on Somalia was not available before 
AMISOM's mandate was set to expire.  We look forward to 
receiving the report in March and are especially anxious 
to see in the report the development of contingency plans for 
a possible deployment of a UN peacekeeping operation 
to succeed AMISOM, including the assessment of the Technical 
Assessment Mission DPKO recently dispatched to 
Somalia.  The USG will be disappointed if the Secretariat has 
not completed contingency planning as 
directed by the UNSC. 
 
-- The United States welcomes the appointment of a new 
Cabinet by Prime Minister Nur "Adde" Hassan Hussein and 
the relocation of the Transitional Federal Government to 
Mogadishu. 
 
-- The United States also welcomes the commitment of Prime 
Minister Hussein and the new TFG administration to 
continue engaging in an inclusive process of political 
dialogue, and looks forward to the development of a road 
map for the remainder of the transitional process, including 
free and democratic elections in 2009 as set out 
in Somalia's Transitional Federal Charter. 
 
-- The United States remains concerned about the increase in 
piracy off the coast of Somalia. 
 
-- (deliver point only if the Somali Mission has delivered 
its request for assistance from the UNSC) We welcome the 
TFG's request for counterpiracy assistance and call on all 
members to answer this call. 
 
-- The United States has started consultations with 
interested member states on what can be done to address 
the  issue of piracy in the Horn of Africa.  We look forward 
to working with the Council to ensure that the international 
community has the tools it needs to combat acts of piracy and 
armed robbery off the coast of Somalia. 
 
-- The United States remains gravely concerned about the 
deteriorating humanitarian situation, especially in 
south-central Somalia.  We welcome continued close 
coordination and cooperation with the UN Country Team and 
our donor partners in Nairobi to ensure that humanitarian 
assistance reaches those in need inside Somalia.
