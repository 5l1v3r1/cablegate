SUBJECT: THANK YOU TO EMBASSY DAMASCUS 
 
Maura, 
 
I want to thank you and the entire Mission yet again for the 
outstanding support provided during Dan Shapiro's and my 
travel to Damascus. This was a much more difficult visit, 
highlighting the serious differences that must be resolved 
and underscoring that our effort to engage Syria as a means 
to address concerns and find areas of cooperation will be a 
long, slow process.  I have no doubts that with your 
leadership and the quality of your team Embassy Damascus will 
continue to provide the timely reporting and analysis that 
inform our discussions in Washington. 
 
Thank you to the Management and RSO teams for their support 
during our trip, and to the public affairs and political 
sections for keeping Washington informed, dealing with media 
inquiries, and producing comprehensive, high-quality 
reporting cables.  I know that supporting a trip like this 
continues well after we have departed and I appreciate all 
the hard work to complete the multiple reporting cables.  To 
all those who worked behind-the-scenes to support this trip, 
please convey my gratitude.  I want to recognize Russ Comeau 
who was an outstanding control officer.  We wish him the best 
of luck in his onward assignment to Afghanistan. 
 
Lastly, thank you - once again - for your tremendous efforts. 
 Embassy Damascus sets a high standard and all of us in 
Washington, myself especially, are appreciative of all that 
you do. 
 
Best, 
 
Jeff 
CLINTON
