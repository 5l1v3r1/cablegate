SUBJECT: DEMARCHE: URGING TO CHINA TO NOT OPPOSE ON EU 
RESOLUTION SUDAN IN THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶1.  Department requests that the Embassy urge China to 
support, or at least not to oppose, a European Union- 
sponsored Sudan resolution at the UN Human Rights 
Council.  The Embassy is also requested to voice U.S. 
opposition to an Algerian-sponsored resolution text 
that would protect Sudan from criticism on Darfur. 
(Note: Essentially, we are asking China to abstain 
on both, if China cannot support the EU resolution. 
End Note.)  The Chinese delegation in Geneva has 
tended to be less supportive of Western positions 
on Darfur than China's delegation in New York or 
the MFA generally.  However, we believe that China 
could be encouraged to abstain on both resolutions. 
For this to happen, however, the Chinese delegation in 
Geneva would have to receive clear instructions from 
the MFA.  The vote on the European-backed resolution 
could occur as soon as Friday, March 23, though it may 
also be delayed until next week.  China's reaction to 
this demarche may be complicated by the fact that China 
is a member of the HRC and the U.S. is not. If this 
issue is raised, Embassy should respond that while the 
USG has reservations about the HRC and has chosen not to 
run for membership in it, the body clearly has a 
responsibility to address the most pressing human rights 
situation in the world.  If Chinese say anything to 
suggest a trade of Chinese support or abstention of the 
resolutions in return for U.S. concessions on related 
votes in the Security Council, Embassy should emphasize 
that the HRC vote should be made on its merits, not as 
part of a package deal.  Our primary concern in Darfur 
remains the immediate deployment of an AU/UN hybrid force, 
as agreed upon in Addis Ababa in November.  Given time 
differences with posts and time needed for capitals to 
relay instructions to Geneva, time is of the essence. 
Department deeply appreciates Embassy's swift action. 
End Background. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶2.  Department instructs Embassy to pursue the following 
objectives: 
 
-- Urge China to support -- or at a minimum abstain -- 
in the vote on a European Union-sponsored resolution on Sudan 
at the UN Human Rights Council, and not to support the 
competing Algerian-sponsored resolution that seeks to 
protect Sudan from criticism on Darfur; 
 
-- Urge China to immediately convey clear instructions 
to its delegation in Geneva to this effect; 
 
(If Chinese officials raise a trade-off of their abstention 
for U.S. concessions in the Security Council): 
 
-- Emphasize that we welcome China's willingness to be 
cooperative in Geneva, and also call on them to support 
ongoing Council efforts in New York to address the crisis 
in Darfur and advance the implementation of the understanding 
reached at Addis Ababa in November, concluded with China's 
help, leading to the deployment of an AU/UN hybrid PKO 
under clear UN command and control.
