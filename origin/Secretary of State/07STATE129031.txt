BACKGROUND

¶3. Begin Background. 
 
(SBU) Pejman Piran, who arrived in Turkey in April 2005, was 
formally recognized as a refugee by UNHCR in October 2006 
based on well-founded fears of persecution due to his and his 
family,s political activities.  His brother, Peyman Piran, 
is a prominent Iranian student activist currently detained in 
Evin Prison who has been mentioned by name in the 2006, 2005, 
and 2004 Human Rights Report.  Their father Mostafa Piran, a 
prominent labor activist, has received refugee status in 
Sweden.  Pejman Piran,s refugee case was submitted to the 
United States for review, but Turkish authorities three times 
denied him permission to travel from Van to Istanbul for his 
resettlement interview with DHS officials.  UNHCR reports 
Piran and four other UNHCR-recognized refugees were detained 
and deported from Turkey on August 22, 2007.  The GOT refused 
to confirm their detention, denied them access to Amnesty 
International lawyers, and reportedly deported them from 
Turkey to either Iran or Iraq.  The GOT has argued it does 
not consider Piran to be a refugee, since he had previously 
left Iran and returned safely. 
 
(SBU) States party to the UN Convention Relating to the 
Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, such as Turkey, 
have the right to make their own determination of which 
individuals qualify as refugees; they are not obligated to 
recognize UNHCR refugee designations.  However, the GOT 
should be able to explain the legal process by which it 
determined Piran was not a refugee and that his life or 
freedom would not be threatened on account of a protected 
category (race, religion, nationality, social group 
membership or political opinion) in the territory to which 
they deported him.
