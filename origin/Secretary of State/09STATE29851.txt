ON LICENSE 050118116 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 050118116 for the 
export of inertial measurement units (IMUs) to Ecuador. 
Embassy is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check 
within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check 
will affect pending and future licenses involving parties to 
this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Need to verify Ecuador Ministry of 
Defense (EMOD) relationship with foreign consignee, Israeli 
Aerospace Industries (IAI) and need to verify compliance with 
license provisos. 
 
¶4. ACTION QUITO: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate host government officials to determine if the 
EMOD has received the IMUs from IAI and that the articles are 
being used for the purpose stated on the license. Department 
also requests that Embassy verify compliance with U.S. 
Department of Defense provisos stipulating that the IMUs are 
not approved for use on Category I Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 
(UAVs).  Export data indicates that items worth $117,050 
shipped from the United States on October 3, 2008.  Post is 
requested to exercise its contacts within the Ecuador MOD to 
verify this order. 
END ACTION.
