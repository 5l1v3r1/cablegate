SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050096269 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on application 050096269 for 
the export of two cylinder assembly components for the 
Pilatus aircraft to Canada.  Items were exported from the 
United States on April 21, 2008.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Concerns regarding the reliability of 
Astro Global Trading (AGT), unfamiliar foreign consignee, and 
possible ties to embargoed countries. 
 
¶4. ACTION: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate DSP Electronics officials to determine if it has 
received the Pilatus aircraft components from AGT and that 
the articles are being used for the purpose stated on the 
license.  Department also requests that Embassy (via 
Consulate General Vancouver) conduct a site visit to AGT and 
assess its business operations, on-site security, and general 
reliability as a recipient of United States Munitions List 
(USML) items.  POC for AGT is Salar Soufizadeh, Sales 
Manager, TEL: 604-726-6352, reference Purchase Order # 
PO-08-0129-12 dated Feb. 22, 2008.  The following questions 
are offered as suggested guidance with AGT: 
 
- Can AGT provide documentation (e.g. purchase order, 
contract, or letter of intent) that definitively establishes 
DSP Electronics as the end user of these items? 
 
- Who are AGT's main clients? Does AGT have any business ties 
to customers located in China or Iran? 
 
- Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-export and retransfer? 
 
If a site visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case 
officer.   END ACTION.
