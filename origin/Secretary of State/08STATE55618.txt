Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting

of a Bell UH-1H helicopter to South Africa.  Post is

¶3. Reason for request:  Leading Edge Aviation, unfamiliar 
foreign end user. 
 
¶4. ACTION: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate Leading Edge officials to determine if it has 
ordered the Bell UH-1H helicopter and plans to use the 
aircraft for the purpose stated on the license.  Department 
requests that Embassy conduct a site visit to Leading Edge 
(if this is geographically/financially feasible, otherwise 
contact by phone and request documents via email or fax) in 
order to provide an assessment of its business operations, 
on-site security, and general reliability as a recipient of 
United States Munitions List (USML) items.  POC at Leading 
Edge is Mark Jackson, President, TEL: 27-13-741-3654, 
reference PO # 5874 dated March 25, 2008. The following 
questions are offered as suggested guidance with Leading 
Edge: 
 
- Can Leading Edge provide documentation firmly establishing 
its order for the helicopter from the U.S. applicant, 
Tamarack Helicopters? 
 
- For what purpose will the helicopter be used? 
 
- Does Leading Edge understand that the aircraft may not be 
operated in prohibited countries, per Section 126.1 of the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)? 
 
- Does the company understand the restrictions on Unites 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-export and retransfer? 
 
- Who are the company's main clients? 
 
If a site visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case 
officer.   END ACTION.
