ON LICENSE 050081481

¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy,s assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 050081481 for the 
export of F-5 aircraft spare component parts to Spain. 
Embassy is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check 
within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check 
will affect pending and future licenses involving parties to 
this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Lack of documentation from the Spanish 
Air Force (SAF) and general concern over possible diversion 
of F-5 spare parts to proscribed countries. 
 
¶4. ACTION Madrid: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate host government officials to determine if the SAF 
has received the F-5 aircraft spare component parts from Aero 
Precision Industries and that the articles are being used for 
the purpose stated on the license.  Export data indicates 
that items worth $621 were shipped from the United States on 
March 4, 2008.  An additional three shipments were made from 
the U.S. on May 20, 2008 in the amounts of $15,835, $15,535 
and $15,155.  Due to lack of documentation from the end user, 
Post is requested to exercise its contacts within the SAF to 
verify receipt of this order.  (It may be useful to reference
