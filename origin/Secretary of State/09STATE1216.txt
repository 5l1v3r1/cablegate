SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT - ISRAEL, THE WEST BANK AND GAZA 
 
¶1.  The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens that 
the Israel Defense Force (IDF) is engaged in a 
military operation against terrorist organizations in 
the Gaza Strip.  This operation began on December 27, 
2008, with aerial and naval bombardment, and expanded 
on January 3, 2009, to include ground operations. 
Since the December 19, 2008, expiration of a 
ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, terrorist 
organizations have launched ongoing rocket and mortar 
attacks from Gaza into southern Israel.  The 
Department of State urges U.S. citizens traveling to 
and within Israel and the West Bank to maintain a 
high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to 
increase their security awareness.  No official U.S. 
Government travel is permitted within the Gaza Strip. 
Due to the ongoing conflict and limited ability of 
the U.S. Government to assist American citizens in 
the Gaza Strip, the Department of State urges 
American citizens, including journalists and aid 
workers, to avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip.  This 
Travel Alert expires on January 31, 2009. 
¶2.  U.S. Government employees, including those on 
temporary duty, currently are restricted from 
travelling within a 30 kilometer radius of the Gaza 
Strip, inside of which the vast majority of rockets 
and mortars have fallen.  The Embassy's Regional 
Security Office must approve any travel of U.S. 
Embassy employees inside the 30 kilometer radius. 
Some longer range rockets have landed in Yavne, north 
of Ashdod, and as far east as Beersheva.  The 
Government of Israel's Home Front Command has ordered 
residents of all communities within 40 kilometers of 
the Gaza Strip, including Beersheva, Yavne, and 
Gadera, to take precautions against the possibility 
of rocket strikes.  Schools are currently closed and 
provision of some public services has been scaled 
back in areas considered to be within rocket range. 
American citizens staying within rocket range should 
also take appropriate precautions and security 
measures, which may include staying within a certain 
distance of a sheltered space and remaining in that 
space for five minutes after a rocket alert sounds. 
Specific guidance in English is available at the Home 
Front Command website:  http://www.oref.org.il/934- 
en/PAKAR.aspx 
¶3.  Within Israel and the West Bank, planned and 
spontaneous protests against the military actions in 
Gaza have the potential to turn violent.  Security 
forces have used tear gas and fired shots in the air 
to control such incidents.  American citizens should 
remain alert and avoid gatherings of protesters and 
police.   Due to these spontaneous demonstrations, 
U.S. Embassy employees have been advised to avoid 
traveling on Highway 65 in the Wadi Ara area between 
Highway 6 and Highway 66, which is near Um-El-Fahm 
and en route to Afula.  Demonstrations can occur with 
little or no warning and make traffic unpredictable; 
demonstrators have also thrown stones at passing 
vehicles. 
¶4.  Because the current security environment 
throughout Israel and the West Bank remains 
unpredictable, U.S. Government employee security 
measures may be amended at any time including 
increasing travel restrictions, adding travel bans, 
relocating U.S. Government staff and contractors to 
safer areas, or imposing additional restrictions on 
visiting public places. 
¶5.  Americans in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza 
should be vigilant about security at all times.  They 
should monitor local news, vary their routes and 
times, and consider the level of security when 
visiting crowded public places, such as shopping 
malls, hotels, restaurants, or entertainment venues. 
Some American citizens in Gaza and their immediate 
 
STATE 00001216  002 OF 003 
 
 
family members were assisted in departing Gaza on 
January 2, 2009.  American citizens remaining in Gaza 
should consider notifying the Consulate General in 
Jerusalem at the address below of their whereabouts 
in the event they wish to participate in possible 
future evacuations of foreign nationals from the Gaza 
Strip. 
¶6.  American citizens are advised to maintain valid 
travel documents and register with the Department of 
State or U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv/U.S. Consulate 
Jerusalem through the State Department's travel 
registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  By 
registering, American citizens make it easier for the 
Embassy and the Consulate to contact them in case of 
emergency.  The U.S. Embassy is located at 71 
Hayarkon  Street, Tel Aviv 63903.  The U.S. Consulate 
General in Jerusalem is loated at 27 Nablus Road, 
Jerusalem 94190.
