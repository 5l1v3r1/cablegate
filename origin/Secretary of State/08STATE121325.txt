SUBJECT: SAUDI BUTTER FOR LEBANESE GUNS 
 
Classified By: NEA PDAS Jeffrey Feltman for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph three. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (C) The Department seeks Saudi assistance to deliver 
advanced capabilities to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in 
advance of Lebanon's 2009 legislative elections.  The LAF has 
requested Cessna Caravan gunships for close air support as 
well as a third-party transfer of Jordanian M-60 tanks, which 
will require refurbishment and possibly upgrade.  These 
systems will help the LAF counter threats to Lebanon's 
internal security, demonstrate political support for the LAF 
and the Lebanese government, bolster the electoral prospects 
of March 14 and like-minded independents seeking a government 
monopoly on the use of force in Lebanon, and bolster public 
confidence in the LAF as an alternative to Hizballah. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶3. (C/REL SAUDI ARABIA) Embassy Riyadh is requested to 
approach senior Saudi interlocutors in pursuing the following 
objectives: 
 
-- Request a $60M grant to the LAF earmarked for the purchase 
of Cessna Caravan gunships requested by the LAF for close air 
support, counterterrorism, counternarcotics, and surveillance 
missions.  We expect to deliver at least one aircraft before 
Lebanon's 2009 elections. 
 
-- Request a $60M grant to the LAF earmarked for the 
refurbishment and possible upgrade of 66 Jordanian M-60 tanks 
requested by the LAF for third-party transfer from Jordan, 
complete with appropriate ammunition.  (Note:  Jordan has 
offered M-60A1 tanks, but Lebanon may request M-60A3 tanks or 
an upgrade of the M-60A1 tanks to M-60A3 standards.)  We 
expect to deliver a company of tanks (approximately 11-14) 
before Lebanon's 2009 elections. 
 
-- Note that the provision of these systems to the LAF is 
subject to further procedural hurdles, including Exceptions 
to National Disclosure Policy (ENDPs), formal authorization 
to sell/transfer the systems, and Congressional notification. 
 Given the intent to provide some assistance prior to 
Lebanon's elections and the need to identify funding 
immediately, we chose to approach Saudi Arabia as soon as we 
and the LAF had identified a package of items that would 
address the LAF's military needs and the U.S.-Saudi desire to 
provide high-visibility assistance. 
 
REPORTING DEADLINE 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) Post is requested to report the results of this 
demarche by cable to NEA/ELA Lebanon Desk Officer Matthew 
Irwin and PM/RSAT Lebanon Desk Officer David Burke by 
Thursday, November 20. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Saudi Arabia has been a strong political and 
financial backer of the LAF since mid-2007 when it quietly 
provided $100M to support LAF operations against Fatah 
al-Islam militants in Lebanon's Nahr al-Barid refugee camp. 
This assistance came in addition to a $1B deposit in the 
Central Bank of Lebanon after the 2006 Israel-Hizballah war 
and millions of dollars of humanitarian, reconstruction, and 
development assistance since 2006. 
 
¶6. (C) Saudi Arabia has also pressed the United States to 
provide advanced capabilities to the LAF to ensure it is 
prepared to respond to emerging crisis and, more 
strategically, as a political and military counterweight to 
Syrian and Iranian support for Hizballah.  Various Saudi 
officials including Prince Bandar as-Sultan and King Abdullah 
himself have previously indicated to U.S. and Lebanese 
officials, including Defense Minister Elias Murr and 
parliamentary majority leader Saad Hariri, that they would be 
willing to help the LAF procure more advanced capabilities if 
and when they were offered by the United States. 
 
¶7. (S) After assessing the LAF's military needs, the 
availability of U.S. equipment, and regional policy concern 
including Israel's qualitative military edge (QME), the 
Departments of State and Defense are moving to provide three 
Cessna Caravan gunships and a third-party transfer of 66 
Jordanian M-60 tanks pending consultations with Congress and 
our regional allies.  These items would represent a 
qualitatively different level of assistance than has been 
provided to the LAF since the mid-1980s.  None of these 
systems is assessed as a threat to Israel's QME. 
 
POINT OF CONTACT 
---------------- 
 
¶8.  (U) Please contact NEA/ELA Lebanon Desk Officer Matthew 
Irwin or PM/RSAT Lebanon Desk Officer David Burke with 
questions or for further background information.
