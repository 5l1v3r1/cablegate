DEAR ANA: 
 
I WAS DEEPLY SADDENED TO LEARN OF THE TRAGIC BOMBINGS IN 
MADRID THAT KILLED MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE. ON BEHALF OF 
MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, I WISH TO EXPRESS 
OUR CONDOLENCES AND HEARTFELT SYMPATHIES TO THE PEOPLE OF 
SPAIN AND ESPECIALLY TO THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO LOST LOVED 
ONES. WE SHARE YOUR GRIEF. 
 
THESE DEPLORABLE, BARBARIC TERRORIST ACTS PROVE ONCE AGAIN 
THAT TERRORISM MUST BE FOUGHT IN ALL ITS FORMS, WHEREVER IT 
 
OCCURS. AS IN THE PAST, THE UNITED STATES TODAY STANDS 
WITH SPAIN IN ALL ITS EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM. 
TOGETHER WE WILL PERSEVERE AND MAKE THE WORLD SAFER FOR ALL 
OUR CITIZENS. 
 
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT A TIME THIS MUST BE FOR YOU AND ALL 
THE MEMBERS OF THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE A HEAVY 
RESPONSIBILITY IN LEADING THE NATION IN THIS HOUR OF LOSS, 
MOURNING, AND RESOLVE. PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN MY 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. 
 
SINCERELY, 
 
COLIN L. POWELL
