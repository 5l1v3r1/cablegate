SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050097913 AND 050051555 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 050097913 and 050051555 for 
the export of International Traffic in Arms Regulations 
(ITAR) - controlled, aircraft spare parts to the Spanish 
Ministry of Defense (MOD).  Post is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of response 
to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future 
licenses involving parties to a license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Substantiate the bona fides of 
unfamiliar Foreign Consignee Europavia Espana in the two 
transactions, listed below. 
 
¶4. Action: The Department requests that Post conduct a site 
visit to Europavia Espana in order to assess its business 
operations, on-site security, and general reliability as a 
recipient of United States Munitions List (USML) items.  Post 
is also requested to make inquiries with the Spanish Ministry 
of Defense (MOD) and the Spanish Air Force to determine if 
they have received the aircraft and helicopter spare parts on 
the licenses listed below and that the articles are being 
used for the purpose stated on the licenses. 
 
The following questions for Europavia Espana are provided as 
suggested guidance: 
 
-- Can the company provide documentation from the Spanish 
Ministry of Defense (MOD) and/or the Spanish Air Force (e.g. 
purchase order, contract, or letter of intent) establishing 
it as the final end user of the USML items? 
 
-- Have all of the items ordered on these licenses been 
provided to the Spanish MOD?  Does Europavia continue to hold 
any of the USML items? 
 
-- Is Europavia Espana an official supplier/contractor for 
the Spanish MOD?  Does the company have any 
other contracts with the Spanish MOD that involve the 
procurement of USML items? 
 
-- Who are Europavia Espana's other customers, what is the 
nature of their business, and where are they located? 
 
-- Are you familiar with Freight Forwarder Integral Transport 
Service, S.A. (Madrid)'s exact role on License 050097913, 
 below? 
 
-- Were there any additional foreign parties (e.g. 
consignees, freight forwarders, etc.) involved in this 
transaction? 
 
-- Does Europavia Espana understand the restrictions on USML 
items (especially the prohibition against unauthorized 
re-transfers, re-exports, or changes in end use)? 
 
End Action.
