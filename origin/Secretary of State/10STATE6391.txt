SUBJECT: TFHA01: Haiti Air Ops Prioritization 
 
¶1.  Acting at the request of the Government of Haiti, the U.S. 
Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established 
the Haiti Flight Operations Coordination Center (HFOCC) to 
manage the air traffic and speed up the delivery of humanitarian 
aid.  In discussions with foreign government officials, bureaus 
should highlight the ICAO mandated procedures, including the 
requirement for IFR flight plans, obtaining arrival slot times 
from the Haiti Flight Operations Coordination Center at 001-850- 
283-5477 prior to departure, and notice that fuel and other 
ground support services may be unavailable.  Operators should 
carry enough fuel into Haiti to allow them to depart. 
 
¶2.  Posts should also highlight that foreign state aircraft 
entering U.S. airspace, before or after traveling to Haiti, 
continue to require a diplomatic clearance number issued by the 
Department.  Early on January 16, PM/ISO distributed the NOTAM 
and diplomatic clearance guidance to all foreign missions in the 
U.S. that routinely fly state aircraft into and through the 
United States. 
 
¶3.  In those rare cases with specific objective criteria -- 
importance to the humanitarian mission or critical foreign 
policy need -- that require urgent prioritization, the bureau 
receiving the request should contact WHA DAS Julissa Reynoso at 
ReynosoJ@State.Gov or 202-647-6613 or via the Ops Center at 202- 
647-1512 after hours, and copy TaskForce-1@state.gov.  The 
request should include the justification for urgent 
prioritization, and information regarding the current landing 
slot (if any), transport tail number, call sign, and requested 
time/date of prioritization.  Posts are urged not to contact 
SOUTHCOM directly on such matters. 
 
¶4.  WHA DAS Reynoso will determine whether the request fits the 
justification for urgent prioritization, consulting as needed 
with interested bureaus.  We will then communicate the 
Department of State's position on those requests meeting the 
criteria to SOUTHCOM via the SOUTHCOM Action Officer on Task 
Force 1.  If a request does not fit the criteria or if 
DoD/SOUTHCOM is unable to prioritize the flight, DAS Reynoso 
will inform the requesting bureau. 
 
¶5.  So posts are aware, despite media reports to the contrary, 
U.S. military aircraft have utilized only about 30% of the 
landing slots since this system was put in place. The airport's 
daily aircraft load has increased roughly tenfold vs. pre-crisis 
numbers under these procedures and U.S. involvement in air 
traffic management. We also note that this increase means that 
airport operations are stretched to the limit and any minor 
glitches, e.g. weather problems or an aircraft which takes too 
long to unload, can cause significant delays or flight 
diversions. Posts and bureaus should also recommend to 
requestors that they switch to a smaller aircraft which can be 
more easily accommodated or consider flying to the Dominican 
Republic and going overland to Haiti. 
 
¶6. Minimized considered.
