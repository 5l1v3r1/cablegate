MEETING IN WASHINGTON: PROPOSED U.S. DATES AND AGENDA 
ITEMS 
 
REF: 2006 OTTAWA 03184 
 
(U) Upcoming U.S.-Canada Bilateral Consultative Group 
(BCG) Meeting in Washington: Proposed U.S. Dates and 
Agenda Items 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action message, please see paragraph 7. 
 
¶2.  (U) Ambassador Dell L. Dailey, U.S. Counterterrorism 
Coordinator, looks forward to hosting the U.S.-Canada 
Bilateral Consultative Group (BCG) meeting this fall in 
Washington.  This cable outlines our proposals for the BCG 
agenda and notional dates for discussion with the 
Government of Canada. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Last year's BCG meeting generated productive 
follow-on activity, particularly in the research and 
development and bioterrorism fields.  This year, we would 
like to capitalize on those successes, re-engage on 
outstanding proposals, and move forward on several new CT 
areas of common interest.  We have outlined a notional 
agenda in paragraph 5 and have proposed dates at paragraph 
¶6.  We ask Embassy Ottawa to share these agenda items and 
possible dates with the GOC for their initial feedback, 
and solicit their input on any topics they would like to 
include. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) As agreed to at last year's BCG, we would like 
to set a firm goal for concluding an updated version of 
the 1988 Joint Declaration on Counterterrorism.  The U.S. 
has updated the 1988 text and the USG interagency 
community is currently reviewing it.  We will forward this 
text to Embassy Ottawa as soon as possible so it can be 
shared with appropriate GOC officials in anticipation of 
the upcoming BCG discussions.  Moreover, we would like to 
discuss with the Canadians the possibility of having this 
Declaration signed later by the Secretary of State and 
Foreign Minister, as then-U.S. Secretary of State George 
Shultz and Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark did for the 
original 1988 Declaration. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Notional Agenda for US-Canada BCG (in no 
particular order): 
 
-- Threat Assessment/Intelligence Briefing 
 
-- Follow-up discussions on outstanding proposals from 
last year's BCG 
 
-- Follow-up on Bioterrorism Engagement: 
(a) Results of May 2007 Briefing on Threats to the Food 
Supply 
(b) Results of June 2007 Technical Roundtable to Share 
Collaborative Public Health-Law Enforcement Investigation 
Strategies 
(c) Future engagement 
 
-- Cooperative Counterterrorism Research and Development 
(R&D): 
 
(a) Status update on negotiations for the U.S.-Canada 
Memorandum of Understanding on CT Research and Development 
(R&D) 
(b) Review ongoing activities of the Quadrilateral (U.S., 
Canada, UK, and Australia) on Chemical, Biological, and 
Radiological Counterterrorism efforts (Note:  The 
Quadrilateral group will have just met in Canberra October 
31-November 2) 
(c) Possible breakout presentation on recent CT R&D 
successes 
(d) Takeaway Document: Canada's 10-year progress review 
booklet "Science Combating Terrorism: A Canada-U.S. 
Success Story" and 
(e) Sharing relevant technologies with Western Hemisphere 
partners, particularly Mexico 
 
-- U.S.-Canada Border Security: 
 
(a) Information Exchange, including use and privacy 
concerns 
(b) Biometrics/Screening Tools: Each side to provide 
updates on national efforts to improve and use biometrics 
and screening tools.  Specifically we would be interested

efforts and how can we share biometric information with

university and private sector research in these areas, and 
of organizing visits to both nations by influential third 
country public leaders and local decision makers 
 
-- U.S.-Canadian cooperation to promote capacity building 
and assistance programs in multilateral forums such as the 
UN, G-8 and CTAG, OSCE, OAS and CICTE, APEC, and ARF and 
coordinated approaches to supporting the AU Center, taking

Syria and Iran. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) We propose the following dates: January 16-17 or 
January 23-24.  Like last year's BCG, we propose to begin 
on the afternoon of the first day with a heads of 
delegation meeting to discuss the Joint Declaration and to 
receive the threat assessment/intelligence briefing.  We 
would follow this with a full day plenary session, 
starting with possible breakout discussions on how to move 
forward on outstanding proposals from last year's BCG.  We 
are still considering representational functions and 
venue.
