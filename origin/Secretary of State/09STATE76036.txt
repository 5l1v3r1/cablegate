SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050128442 AND 050136115 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 050128442 and 050136115 for 
the export of proximity fuze components to Israel.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. 
Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: Due to the nature of these commodities 
and the potential for them to be used in cluster munitions, a 
proviso was placed on these licenses disallowing the exported 
items to be used in such munitions.  This request is to 
confirm that the proximity fuze components listed below have 
not and will not be integrated into cluster munitions. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to verify that all the 
proximity fuze components listed below were received by the 
Israeli Ministry of Defense.  Post is also requested to make 
inquiries to appropriate officials of the Government of 
Israel to verify that the components have not and will not be 
integrated into cluster munitions.  Finally, Post is 
requested to establish the bona fides of foreign intermediate 
consignee Reshef Technologies LTD and confirm that the 
company has not retained possession of any of the components 
exported under these licenses. 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
