SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - IRAN 
 
¶1.  The Department of State continues to warn U.S. 
citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to 
Iran. Dual national Iranian-American citizens may 
encounter difficulty in departing Iran. American 
citizens should stay current with media coverage of 
local events and carefully consider non-essential 
travel.  This supersedes the Travel Warning for Iran 
issued September 15, 2008. 
¶2. Some elements in Iran remain hostile to the United 
States.  As a result, American citizens may be subject 
to harassment or arrest while traveling or residing in 
Iran.  In 2009, Iranian authorities prevented a number 
of Iranian-American citizens, including journalists, who 
traveled to Iran for personal or professional reasons 
from leaving, in some cases for several months. Iranian 
authorities also detained or imprisoned Iranian-American 
citizens on various charges, including espionage and 
posing a threat to national security.  Americans of 
Iranian origin should consider the risk of being 
targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. 
Iranian authorities may deny dual nationals access to 
the United States Interests Section in Tehran, because 
they are considered to be solely Iranian citizens. 
¶3. The Iranian Government continues to repress some 
minority religious and ethnic groups, including Bahai, 
Arabs, Kurds, Azeris, and others.  Consequently, some 
areas within the country where these minorities reside, 
including the Baluchistan border area near Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, the Kurdish northwest of the country, and 
areas near the Iraqi border, remain unsafe. 
¶4. Large-scale demonstrations with sometimes violent 
outbreaks have taken place in various regions throughout 
Iran, in particular over the past weeks as a result of a 
volatile political climate following the June 12, 2009 
presidential elections.  U.S. citizens who travel to 
Iran should exercise caution. 
¶5. The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or 
consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
therefore cannot provide protection or routine consular 
services to American citizens in Iran.  The Swiss 
government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves 
as protecting power for U.S. interests in Iran.  Neither 
U.S. passports nor visas to the United States are issued 
in Tehran.  The Iranian Government does not recognize 
dual citizenship and will not allow the Swiss to provide 
protective services for U.S. citizens who are also 
Iranian nationals.  U.S. citizens of Iranian origin who 
are considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens have been 
detained and harassed by Iranian authorities.  Former 
Muslims who have converted to other religions, as well 
as persons who encourage Muslims to convert, are subject 
to arrest and prosecution. 
¶6. Americans who travel or reside in Iran are strongly 
encouraged to register through the State Department's 
travel registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  If they are in 
Tehran, American citizens may also register in person at 
the Foreign Interests Section at the Swiss 
Embassy currently located at No. 39, Shahid Mousavi 
(Golestan 5th), Pasdaran, Tehran. The telephone numbers 
for the Foreign Interests Section are (+98)(21) 2254- 
2178 and (+98)(21) 2256-5273, fax (+98)(21) 225-2258- 
0432, email: tie.vertretung@eda.admin.ch, website: 
http://www.eda.admin.ch/tehran. 
U.S. citizens should also consult the Department of 
State's Country Specific Information for Iran, and the 
current Worldwide Caution, which are located on the 
Department's Internet web site at 
http://travel.state.gov.  American citizens may also 
obtain updated information on travel and security
