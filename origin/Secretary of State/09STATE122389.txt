SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON THE EXPORT OF U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES CITING THE CANADIAN 
EXEMPTION 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on transactions citing the 
Canadian exemption for the export of Gyroscopic compasses to 
Canada.  Embassy is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
check will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Under ITAR 126.5 (Canadian Exemption), 
certain United States Munitions List (USML) items may be 
exported to Canada without a license.  Some items on USML 
Categories XI and XII - which includes gyroscopic compasses - 
may be subject to Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) 
restrictions and may require a license depending on commodity 
specification and type.  DDTC requests this check based on 
vague description of commodity and end-use in export filing. 
 
¶4. ACTION OTTAWA: Mission Canada is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate Bell Helicopter Txtrn Ltd. (Bell) 
and Elcan Optical Technologies (Elcan) officials to obtain 
all relevant details regarding the export of gyroscopic 
compasses to Canada citing the Canadian exemption, including 
exact commodity description and technical parameters for 
performance and capability, number, type, dollar value, and 
serial number of items.  (See paragraph 5 for details of 
export, including filer identification and shipping reference 
numbers.) 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--What were the exact United States Munitions List (USML) 
articles exported to you on (for Bell) June 21st 2007, and 
For Elcan on January 21st, March 17th and May 6th 2008? 
(Automated Export System (AES) filing data provides the 
following information, for Bell "gyroscopic compasses other 
than el", and for Elcan "gyroscopic compasses, electrical, 
except for".)  Please provide detail on model, type and 
technical specifications. 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will Bell 
(or Elcan) be the sole end-user and retain positive control 
over the gyroscopic compasses at all times?  Will they be 
transferred to other end-users in Canada or re-exported? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
