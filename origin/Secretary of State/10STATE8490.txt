¶1. (SBU) Washington welcomes continued engagement with Russia 
on potential OSCE police training projects that would benefit 
Afghanistan, with an emphasis on border security and 
counter-narcotics. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In close consultation with the Russian delegation, 
USOSCE should work with the OSCE Secretariat to develop 
additional Afghanistan-related projects that have direct 
impact for regional security, are consistent with the Madrid 
Ministerial Decision on OSCE Engagement with Afghanistan 
(MC.DEC/04/07), and are based in Central Asian countries. 
Our objective is to eventually implement OSCE projects within 
Afghanistan.  Projects could include a concrete police 
training project based out of the OSCE,s field operations in 
either in Dushanbe (where the OSCE has established a Border 
Security Management College) or Bishkek (where the OSCE 
Academy is located) and would help implement the Athens 
Ministerial Decision on Transnational Threats and 
Challenges(MC.DEC/02/09), which was co-sponsored by Russia 
and the USG.  Washington would like to review all first 
dimension training projects that benefit Afghanistan, but is 
also interested in developing OSCE engagement on second and 
third dimensions extra-budgetary projects for Afghanistan as 
well.  To that end, USOSCE should work with the Afghanistan 
delegation to the OSCE to see if there are other areas of 
potential OSCE cooperation sought by Kabul. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Once the OSCE has developed the additional 
project(s) and received the go-ahead from both Washington and 
Moscow, USOSCE may re-program up to Euro 86K from the Central 
Asia Border Assessment Project (IRMA Project Number 1100584, 
Pledge Number 11823).  Department will also seek additional 
sources of funds (as well as potential in-kind 
contributions), depending on the types and scope of projects 
developed by the OSCE.  USOSCE should also ask Russia to seek 
financial (as well as in-kind) contributions for these 
important projects.
