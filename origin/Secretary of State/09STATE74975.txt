SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST: POINTS FOR BAN/MALIKI JULY 21 
MEETING 
 
¶1. (U)  This is an action request.  Please see paras 2 and 3. 
 
¶2. (U)  USUN is requested to demarche the UN Secretariat at 
the highest level in anticipation of Secretary-General Ban's 
expected meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki on July 21 
in New York. 
 
¶3. (U)  USUN may draw on the following talking points: 
 
-- We expect that Prime Minister Maliki will focus his 
discussion with the UN on the next steps necessary to lift 
Chapter VII UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). 
 
-- We and many other members of the Council support making 
progress towards restoring the Government of Iraq to its 
former international standing.  However, as you know, members 
of the Security Council also believe that the GOI must take 
positive and constructive steps to address some of the 
underlying issues in order to create a climate that is more 
favorable to lifting these resolutions. 
 
-- For example, the United States has sought to urge the 
Iraqis to take steps to address some of the issues with 
Kuwait, the Oil-For-Food (OFF) contracts, and compliance with 
international norms of nonproliferation. 
 
-- We would appreciate your support in reinforcing with the 
GOI the degree to which taking some additional steps could 
greatly facilitate with the members of the Council lifting 
the UNSCRs. 
 
End talking points. 
 
¶4. (U) Background: Beginning with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
in 1990, the Security Council (SC) passed a series of 
resolutions regarding Iraq on a wide array of topics which 
impose ongoing obligations on Iraq under Chapter VII of the 
UN Charter.  The Government of Iraq (GOI) has consistently 
asked to be released from many, but not all, of these 
obligations.  Through the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement and 
UNSCR 1859 (2008), we and the UN have been enlisted to assist 
in this effort.  In anticipation of the imminent release of 
the U.N. 1859 report demonstrating the actions necessary for 
the Government of Iraq (GOI) to achieve its international 
standing prior to the adoption of these resolutions, Iraqi 
Prime Minister Maliki is expected to meet with Secretary 
General Ban in New York on July 21 to discuss the report.
