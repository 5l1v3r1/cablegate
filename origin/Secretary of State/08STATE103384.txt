¶4.  (C) SUMMARY.  Assistant Secretary Shannon met with 
Foreign Minister Santos on the margins of UNGA.  Shannon and 
Santos discussed Nicaragua's decision to recognize South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia, political developments in Bolivia, and 
the U.S. offer of humanitarian assistance to Cuba in the wake 
of the recent hurricanes.  They also discussed the 
Governments of Nicaragua's GON's recent actions against the 
International Republican Institute (IRI), MANPADs,  and plans 
for construction of a new canal.  Santos reiterated 
D'Escoto's UN message, underscoring his call for love and 
understanding.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
RECOGNITION OF SOUTH OSSETIA AND ABKHAZIA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) A/S Shannon emphasized the USG's disappointment at 
Nicaragua's decision to recognize the independence of South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Nicaragua is the only country that has 
recognized the Georgian provinces other than Russia.  A/S 
Shannon clarified that the Nicaraguan's decision had made it 
impossible to continue with Commerce Secretary Gutierrez's 
planned late-September visit to Nicaragua.  While a U.S. 
trade delegation will make its scheduled stop in Managua, 
Secretary Gutierrez will accompany the delegation only to 
Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. 
 
¶6.  (C) FM Santos justified the GON's decision stating that 
Nicaragua recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia because the 
provinces &had asked them to,8 likening it to U.S. 
recognition of Kosovo.  Santos compared Kosovo to a Pandora's 
box pointing out that there are many countries throughout the 
world that desire independence.  Santos noted that Macedonia 
is the next hot zone.  Shannon reminded Santos that Kosovo's 
independence had been the product of international 
deliberations and a UN-driven process.  The same was not true 
for the breakaway Georgian provinces. 
 
----------------------- 
U.S.-Bolivia Relations 
----------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) A/S Shannon conveyed that the United States was 
disappointed by Bolivia's decision to expel Ambassador 
Goldberg and by Venezuela's decision to follow-suit by 
expelling Ambassador Duddy.  Bolivia is prejudicing its 
relations not just with the current U.S. Government, but also 
with the new administration that will take control in 2009. 
 
¶8.  (C) Santos pointed out that while both Bolivia and 
Venezuela had expelled the U.S. ambassador, they had not 
taken actions against the U.S. missions in these countries. 
He suggested that this was a strong positive signal that the 
governments want continued relations with the United States. 
Shannon replied that if expelling our ambassador was a 
positive signal, he wondered what a negative signal would be. 
 
-------- 
MANPADS 
-------- 
 
¶9.  (C) A/S Shannon inquired whether President Ortega would 
reconsider the U.S. offer for medical supplies in exchange 
for destruction of MANPADs.  This would be an important 
symbol of partnership between the two countries.  FM Santos 
consented that the deal would be beneficial for Nicaragua and 
agreed to speak with President Ortega about it. 
 
---------------------------- 
NICARAGUA'S DOMESTIC AGENDA 
---------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (C) Santos outlined the GON's priority of reducing 
poverty in Nicaragua through increased education.  Shannon 
offered that the United States is looking for ways to assist 
the GON, but that Nicaragua's rhetoric and diplomatic stunts 
complicate our ability to cooperate. 
 
¶11. (C) Santos also raised Nicaragua's desire to move forward 
in constructing a &Gran Canal.8 The first step would be to 
organize a stakeholder's meeting of interested countries in 
Managua and to form a commission to study construction 
requirements including the ecological impacts.  He noted that 
the French had expressed interest in the details of the 
project and that, while the South Koreans had not overtly 
stated their interest, they had opened their first embassy in 
Nicaragua. 
 
------------------- 
CHARGES AGAINST IRI 
------------------- 

¶12. (C) When asked about recent charges brought against IRI 
in Nicaragua, FM Santos maintained that IRI has been 
providing financial support to opposition groups &under the 
table8 and that the GON felt obligated to respond.  A/S 
Shannon underscored that the USG's goal in working through 
organizations like IRI and the National Democratic Institute 
(NDI) is not to cause political strife or to finance 
opposition groups, but instead to work with civil society to 
combat poverty. 
 
------------------------------- 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO CUBA 
------------------------------- 
 
¶13.  (C) A/S Shannon described U.S. offers of assistance to 
Cuba in the wake of the recent hurricanes.  The United States 
first offered the Government of Cuba up to $5 million in 
humanitarian assistance to be delivered to the island via 
civilian aircraft and later offered an additional $6.3 
million in additional reconstruction materials.  The USG is 
awaiting a response to the most recent offer.  The Government 
of Cuba is using hurricane relief as an opportunity to attack 
the U.S. embargo rather than recognizing the chance to work 
productively with the United States to benefit the Cuban 
people.
