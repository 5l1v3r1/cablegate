Begin text: 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
 
The United States shares the view of others here that the 
London Conference on Afghanistan was successful in 
demonstrating the international community's continuing 
support for Afghanistan and in highlighting the importance of 
strong Afghan leadership. 
 
We also welcomed the emphasis of the conference on the 
importance of regional cooperation; greater efforts to combat 
terrorism, violent extremism, and narcotics trafficking; and 
enhanced efforts to tackle corruption and promote good 
governance, human rights, and economic development. 
 
Toward these ends, we see continued opportunities for OSCE 
engagement with Afghanistan where the OSCE has unique 
expertise.  These include in particular efforts to improve 
the security and management of Afghanistan's northern border, 
counter illicit drugs trafficking, and improve the conduct of 
elections.  We also hope to see more Afghans participate in 
OSCE-sponsored workshops, seminars and conferences, which 
offer opportunities for making Afghans more familiar with 
OSCE norms and best practices across all three dimensions. 
 
We welcome the Chairmanship's stated commitment to 
intensifying OSCE engagement with Afghanistan and look 
forward to continued efforts in this regard.  We remain 
convinced that the benefits to OSCE participating States 
could be even more effective if the OSCE had the flexibility 
to undertake certain border security and training activities 
inside Afghanistan. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
