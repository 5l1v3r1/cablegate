SUBJECT: IRANIAN CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE 2010 COMMISSION ON 
NARCOTIC DRUGS 
 
REF: UNVIE 85 
 
¶1.      (U) This is an action request, please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (U) Per Reftel, Iran has announced its intention to pursue 
the Chairmanship of the 2010 Commission on Narcotic Drugs 
and has been elected by the Asia Group to fill this role. 
A formal announcement is expected this week in Vienna and 
the election will take place this fall during the 
reconvened session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Department appreciates UNVIE's ideas for ways that 
the USG could use this as an opportunity to engage with 
Iran. While the U.S. maintains its position of not 
supporting candidacies of countries under UNSC sanctions 
to head UN agencies, the Asia Group has already selected 
Iran as its candidate, and we are unlikely to be able to 
find anyone to run against them at this point.  Therefore, 
at this time, we do not intend to take any action reacting 
to the Asia Group's decision, while we are still reviewing 
our Iran policy. 
 
¶4. (SBU) If asked on the margins to respond to news that the 
Asia Group has chosen Iran to be its candidate for Chair 
of the CND, Mission can indicate to 
other delegations that we do not intend to react to the 
Asia Group's decision.  Mission should not publicly 
comment on Iran's candidacy.
