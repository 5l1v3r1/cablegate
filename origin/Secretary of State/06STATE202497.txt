SUBJECT: IDENTIFICATION OF GOVERNMENT MEASURES THAT 
ENHANCE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY 
 
 
(U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST FOR STEEL POLICY OFFICERS.  SEE 
PARAGRAPH 5. 
 
¶1. (SBU) IN RECOGNITION OF THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE 
NORTH AMERICAN STEEL INDUSTRY, THE THREE NAFTA GOVERNMENTS 
AGREED IN 2005 TO PURSUE A NORTH AMERICAN STEEL STRATEGY TO 
PROMOTE GROWTH, COMPETITIVENESS, AND PROSPERITY. THE STRATEGY 
IS A "SIGNATURE ISSUE" UNDER THE NORTH AMERICAN SECURITY 
PARTNERSHIP (SPP) THAT WAS DEVELOPED AND IS BEING IMPLEMENTED 
THROUGH THE NORTH AMERICAN STEEL TRADE COMMITTEE (NASTC). 
 
¶2. (SBU) THE NASTC, WHICH CONSISTS OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM 
THE NAFTA GOVERNMENT AND NORTH AMERICAN STEEL INDUSTRIES, 
ESTABLISHED AS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS STRATEGY A PLAN TO 
STRENGTHEN INNOVATION AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT.  THE PLAN IS 
INTENDED TO GIVE INCREASED VISIBILITY TO ONGOING PRIVATE AND 
PUBLIC PROGRAMS, IDENTIFY NEW INITIATIVES, AND IDENTIFY OR 
DEVELOP LINKAGES BETWEEN THESE INITIATIVES AND EFFORTS TO 
ADVANCE A PRO-MANUFACTURING AGENDA. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON 
SUSTAINABILITY, TECHNOLOGY, AND ATTRACTING ENGINEERS TO THE 
STEEL INDUSTRY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) AS A FIRST STEP, A WORKING GROUP OF THE NASTC 
PREPARED AN INVENTORY OF EXISTING INITIATIVES, PRIMARILY AT 
THE NATIONAL LEVEL, IN NAFTA COUNTRIES IN THE FOLLOWING 
AREAS: R&D, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING. 
 
¶4. (SBU) AS A NEXT STEP, THE NASTC WORKING GROUP IS REFINING 
ITS INVENTORY AND GATHERING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT 
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS IN THESE AREAS ON BOTH A NAFTA-WIDE BASIS 
AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE PURPOSE OF THESE EXERCISE IS TO 
LEARN MORE ABOUT INITIATIVES THAT ARE WORKING WELL AND TO 
EXPLORE GLOBAL BEST PRACTICES.  THE NAFTA STEEL INDUSTRIES 
PLAN TO CONDUCT THEIR OWN RESEARCH AND ARE WORKING THROUGH 
THEIR OWN INDUSTRY CONTACTS, INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL IRON 
AND STEEL INSTITUTE, TO COMPILE INFORMATION ON THIS TOPIC. 
 
¶5. (SBU) TO ASSIST IN THIS EFFORT, WE ARE REQUESTING POST (EU 
COMMISSION, EU MEMBER STATES GERMANY, FRANCE, AND ITALY, AND 
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA) TO IDENTIFY INITIATIVES OFFERED BY 
GOVERNMENTS IN THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE 
THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THEIR STEEL INDUSTRIES, FOCUSING ON 
R&D, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING.  THESE PROGRAMS SHOULD INCLUDE 
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS PUBLIC/PRIVATE SECTOR 
COOPERATION.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE 
USEFULNESS/SUCCESS OF THESE INITIATIVES WOULD ALSO BE MUCH 
APPRECIATED. OUR INTENT IS TO COMPLETE THIS INVENTORY IN 
EARLY FEBRUARY, SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE BY 
JANUARY 31.
