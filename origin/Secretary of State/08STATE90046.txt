¶1.    This is an action request.  Please see para 8. 
 
----------- 
BACKGROUND 
----------- 
 
¶2.    The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) ended 21 years 
of civil war between Northern and Southern Sudan in January 
¶2005.  The United States continues its ardent support of the 
CPA, which calls for the democratic transformation of Sudan 
through power sharing, wealth sharing, and security sector 
reform.  As part of our support for implementation of the CPA 
by the parties, we see the economic development of Southern 
Sudan as imperative to the future of Sudan,s Government of 
National Unity (GNU) and the semi-autonomous Government of 
Southern Sudan (GOSS). 
 
¶3.    U.S. interest in the economic viability of the GOSS 
notwithstanding, U.S. sanctions policy on the whole of Sudan 
is complex and has been somewhat of a deterrent to U.S. 
companies potentially interested in operating in the region. 
In addition, the conflict in Darfur, though entirely separate 
from the economic recovery needs of Southern Sudan, has 
overshadowed Sudan,s reputation on the world stage and 
further inhibited otherwise viable businesses from market 
engagement. (Reftels B,C, & D) 
 
¶4.    Despite these factors, we believe there is sufficient 
regional and international interest from the U.S. business 
community to sponsor a U.S. trade delegation to Southern 
Sudan, including the regional capital of Juba and other 
relevant towns, for those businesses interested in learning 
more about this exciting frontier market.  Sanctions on Sudan 
are not insurmountable for the eager investor.  Southern 
Sudan and its regional Government are exempt from many of the 
Sudanese sanctions administered by the Department of 
Treasury,s Office of Foreign Assets Control, making it 
easier for companies to do business there.

Moving Forward with U.S. Trade Delegation - Our Field of 
Dreams 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5.    The Consulate General in Juba is prepared to host a 
trade delegation of 30 - 40 representatives from interested 
companies in a variety of sectors from September 22 to 
October 3 with the purpose of visiting Juba and other 
relevant towns of interest in Southern Sudan; meeting with 
GOSS government officials; and becoming familiar with the 
operational environment in Sudan (ref E).  For planning 
purposes, and in order to secure participation to the fullest 
extent, it might become necessary to shorten the duration of 
the trip and shift it to the week of September 29 to October 
¶3. 
 
¶6.    The delegation,s itinerary will ultimately depend on 
the interests of those companies who participate, but the 
GOSS continues to encourage investors focused on natural 
resource exploration/extraction (bearing in mind USG 
prohibitions on transactions or activities relating to the 
petroleum or petrochemical industries extend to the entire 
territory of Sudan, including Southern Sudan); 
finances/banking; transportation; and agriculture.  (ref E) 
We are also aware that technology/communications firms might 
be interested in Southern Sudan as well.  ConGen Juba would 
reserve local accommodations and arrange intra-country 
travel; however, delegation participants would be required to 
secure their own transportation to and from Juba.  Department 
of State and possibly Department of Commerce representatives 
will be on the delegation as well to answer questions of 
policy and sanctions process.  Each delegation participant 
would be required to secure a valid Sudanese visa. 
 
¶7.    At this time we are attempting to identify interested 
companies and secure the participation of their 
representatives on the trade delegation.  We are in 
communication with the National Foreign Trade Council,s 
(NFTC) project USA Engage, which promotes multicultural 
cooperation on commerce, particularly under the presence of 
sanctions.  We are hopeful that NFTC members, whether 
regionally or internationally based, will be willing to 
participate.

¶8.    ACTION ADDIS, KAMPALA, NAIROBI:  Posts are requested to 
engage with their local American Chamber of Commerce or other 
American business association channels with the intent of 
conveying information about the upcoming trade delegation to 
interested company representatives; ascertaining their 
particular area of interest (i.e. agriculture, resource 
extraction, etc.); and securing their participation on the 
delegation.  Department needs to have a firm an idea of 
participation by August 29, if this not possible, please 
reach out to AF/SPG with perceived obstacles as soon as 
possible.  In addition, Posts are encouraged to solicit views 
on preferred duration of the expedition within the September 
22 - October 3 timeframe posed above.  Posts are requested to 
reach out to AF/SPG Owen (Jimmy) Clarke or Pamela Fierst with 
any questions. 
 
¶9.    Posts are thanked in advance for their work on this 
challenging, but rewarding, initiative.
