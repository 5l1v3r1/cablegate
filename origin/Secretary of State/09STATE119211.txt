SUBJECT: PSI: UPDATE TO INVITATION TO ATTEND PSI EXERCISE 
LEADING EDGE 2010 
 
REF: STATE 84305 
 
 SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1.  We wish to update all addressees about the upcoming 
US-UAE hosted PSI Exercise LEADING EDGE2010 and invite 
them to participate in or observe selected phases. 
This cable also provides logistical information 
regarding travel, billeting, and registration 
requirements. In addition, the exercise planners would 
like to inform partners that the Final Planning 
Conference in UAE has been rescheduled to take 
place 14-16 December in Abu Dhabi, UAE. 
 
¶2. PSI exercise LEADING EDGE will take place in UAE, 
25-28 January, 2010.  Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Jordan, 
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, 
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, UAE, Yemen, 
Djibouti, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and Afghanistan 
have endorsed the Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) Statement of Interdiction Principles and are 
encouraged to participate.  Egypt, Lebanon, Pakistan 
and India are invited to observe all parts of the 
exercise.  A key aspect of the Initiative is its exercise 
program that provides opportunities to practice 
WMD-related interdiction actions, network with 
international counterparts, and share best practices. 
 
¶3. LEADING EDGE 2010 is a USCENTCOM-hosted and USG 
Interagency (IA)-supported multinational PSI exercise 
designed to develop WMD interdiction capabilities with 
partner nations to deter and disrupt illicit transfers 
of WMD-related material, technology, expertise and 
equipment, to include addressing the challenges of 
suspect material inspection, seizure, and disposition. 
The goals of Exercise LEADING EDGE 2010 are to exercise 
internal USG/USCENTCOM WMD-related interdiction 
decision-making processes, increase regional capability 
and support for PSI, and explore critical 
 
STATE 00119211  002 OF 010 
 
 
post-interdiction issues in the customs, law enforcement 
and legal arenas. LEADING EDGE 2010 will take place in 
Abu Dhabi, UAE on 25-28 January, 2010.  The exercise 
consists of three parts.  Part 1 is a GCC multinational 
ship boarding field training exercise to demonstrate 
boarding, search and seizure capabilities and to share 
best practices with participants from Saudi Arabia, 
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and UAE.  Part 2, designed 
by the Department of Homeland Security / Customs & Border 
Protection (DHS/CBP), is a port exercise (PORTEX) to 
demonstrate customs/law enforcement capabilities and 
technologies used to identify and seize cargo of 
proliferation concern, build a professional partnership 
among customs and law enforcement personnel, and learn 
about port and vessel operational issues from industry 
representatives.  Part 3 consists of a table top 
exercise (TTX), which will examine legal authorities 
for interdiction, detention, seizure, and disposition 
under port-state and customs/law enforcement control 
and identify seams and gaps in legal authorities that 
may require further national action.  Parts 2 and 3 
are open to full participation from all PSI-endorsing 
nations addressed on the "TO" line. 
 
¶4. Posts are encouraged to distribute the information 
to host government ministries involved in 
international security-related decision-making, 
nonproliferation, and export controls (to include 
international and customs law, operational intelligence, 
law enforcement and customs operations, border security, 
international trade and finance, exercise planning, and 
policy/diplomacy communities).  Posts are requested to 
draw from the points in paragraph 10 in discussions with 
appropriate host government officials and to encourage 
host government participation in PSI exercise Leading 
Edge 2010; para 10 and para 11, which contains 
logistical information, may be left as a non-paper. 
In addition, if the invited government asks about travel 
funding, please contact the CENTCOM POC below. USCENTCOM 
has a limited amount of funding available to provide 
airfare for foreign military and government officials 
if a country cannot otherwise fund their travel.  The 
government of UAE has graciously offered to provide 
lodging, subsistence, and local transportation for 
invited participant and observer nations. 
 
STATE 00119211  003 OF 010 
 
 
¶5.  U.S. Central Command AOR countries have already 
received an official invitation to participate (BAH, 
KUW, OMN, QAT, SAU) or observe (IRQ, SAU, YEM, EGP, 
JOR, LEB, AFG, KAZ, KYR, PAK, TAJ, TUR, UZB) in 
LEADING EDGE 2010, from Commander U.S. Central Command. 
The distinction between participant and observer in 
the Central Command invitation letters refers only to 
Part 1 of the exercise (GCC multinational ship boarding 
field training exercise).  A subsequent letter of 
Modification from Director, Strategy, Plans, and Policy, 
U.S. Central Command, announced a date change for the 
exercise from October 2009 to January 2010. Invited 
PSI-endorsing nations are encouraged to participate 
in Parts 2 and 3 of the exercise by sending TTX 
playing teams consisting of 3 to 5 experts from the 
customs/law enforcement, legal (customs and/or law of 
the sea/ship boarding), and operational (maritime law 
enforcement or Ministry of Defense) communities. 
Participating countries may also observe Part 1. 
Any country unable to send a full TTX playing team 
may be involved in the TTX as part of a larger 
multinational team that the hosts will organize. 
The Government of UAE also intends to issue official 
invitations to regional partners and select other 
nations to participate in or observe the exercise. 
 
¶6. FOR EMBASSIES CANBERRA, PARIS, LONDON, WELLINGTON, 
OTTAWA, WARSAW, TOKYO, BUENOS AIRES, LISBON, MADRID, 
ATHENS, THE HAGUE BERLIN, OSLO, ROME, MOSCOW, 
SINGAPORE, ANKARA, AND COPENHAGEN ONLY. 
For PSI Operational Experts Group (OEG) countries, 
exercise planners would like to reach out to customs 
and law enforcement experts to fill the following 
desired roles: 1) Full or mixed country playing team 
as part of the table top exercise January 27-28, 2010; 
2) Exercise Control technical expertise for the table 
top exercise; 3) PORTEX demonstration of portable or 
hand-held inspection equipment January 26, 2010. 
If a full playing team is not feasible, OEG partners 
are encouraged to send 1 or 2 experts to either assist 
on exercise control by lending their expertise and/or 
providing a technology demonstration during the PORTEX 
(Part 2) of the exercise. 
 
 
STATE 00119211  004 OF 010

accurately determine the number of personnel attending 
the exercise, posts are requested to identify and help 
coordinate the participation and registration of host 
country's participants or observers no later than 28

NONPAPER 
--------- 
 
¶10. Begin points/non-paper: 
 
-- We value our close collaboration on many 
nonproliferation issues and look forward to working 
together to deepen our Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI) cooperation. 
 
-- On April 5, 2009, in Prague, Czech Republic, 
President Obama expressed his support for the PSI. 
The USG is committed to making PSI a durable and 
effective initiative over the long term by improving 
states' capabilities to stop illicit shipments of 
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), their delivery 
systems, and related materials worldwide.  The USG 
views this effort as a collaborative endeavor among 
PSI partners. 
 
-- In keeping with our shared desire to prevent 
WMD-related proliferation, we wish to inform you of 
the upcoming U.S.-UAE hosted PSI Exercise, LEADING 
EDGE 10, and invite you to participate. 
 
STATE 00119211  006 OF 010 
 
 
-- Exercises are a key component of the PSI. They 
help states improve their WMD-related interdiction 
capabilities and interagency decision-making processes. 
 
-- PSI participants, including Middle East, Maghreb, 
and Central Asia regional partners, are invited to 
participate in the PSI Exercise LEADING EDGE 2010 to 
work with other PSI-endorsing countries to further 
develop and improve capabilities to stop shipments 
of WMD, their delivery systems, and related materials 
to and from states and non-state actors of 
proliferation concern. 
 
-- Exercise LEADING EDGE 2010 will be conducted in 
the UAE from 25 to 28 January 2010 in three parts. 
 
-- Part 1 is a multinational field training exercise to 
demonstrate boarding, search and seizure capabilities 
and share best practices.  PSI-endorsing countries that 
are part of the Gulf Cooperation Council are invited 
to participate. 
 
-- Part 2 is a port exercise (PORTEX) to demonstrate 
customs/law enforcement capabilities and technology 
used to identify and seize proliferation cargo; build 
a professional partnership among customs and law 
enforcement personnel; and learn about port and vessel 
operational issues from industry representatives. 
 
-- Phase 3 is a table top exercise (TTX) that will 
examine legal authorities available for interdiction, 
detention, seizure, and disposition under port-state 
and customs/law enforcement control and identify seams 
and gaps in legal authorities that may require further 
national action. 
 
-- For Part 3, PSI-endorsing nations are encouraged to 
send playing teams consisting of 3 to 5 experts from 
ministries involved in international security-related 
decision-making, nonproliferation, and export controls 
(to include international and customs law, operational 
intelligence, law enforcement and customs operations, 
military interdiction policy/processes, border security, 
international trade and finance, exercise planning, and 
 
STATE 00119211  007 OF 010 
 
 
policy/diplomacy communities).  Observer nations and 
any country unable to send this team may still be 
involved with every aspect of TTX play as part of a 
larger multinational team. 
 
-- We invite you to attend the exercise and seek your 
decision to participate, preferably with representation 
by appropriate officials described above. 
 
-- The UAE will set up an Exercise LEADING EDGE 2010 
website with a link to a USCENTCOM registration and
