¶1.  SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND:  On May 29, 2008, the United 
States hosted a Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) 
Outreach Workshop in Washington, attended by representatives 
of 21 countries that have not yet endorsed the PSI, as well 
as most of the 92 PSI participating states.  The workshop 
provided detailed information on the broad range of PSI 
activities and tools that have been developed for training, 
organizing for, and conducting interdictions of shipments of 
proliferation concern.  Lukasz Zielinski, Head of the 
Nonproliferation Division, MFA, moderated a panel discussion 
about PSI exercise accomplishments and insights. 
 
¶2.  ACTION REQUESTED:  Embassy is requested to deliver under 
appropriate cover the following letter from Acting Assistant 
Secretary Patricia McNerney to Mr. Zielinski, thanking him 
for his contribution to the PSI Outreach Workshop.  There 
will be no signed original. 
 
¶3.  Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Mr. Zielinski: 
 
I would like to thank you for introducing and moderating the 
panel on the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) exercise 
program at the May 29, 2008 PSI Outreach Workshop in 
Washington, DC.  The panel helped to make clear to attendees 
the benefits of participating in PSI exercises. 
 
I believe the Outreach Workshop was very successful both 
because it informed states of the many ongoing PSI activities 
and because it provided states with concrete ways to improve 
their capabilities to stop WMD-related trafficking.  The 
United States greatly appreciates the significant role that 
Poland plays in advancing the PSI's goals, including in 
outreach.  We believe that we must continue PSI outreach, 
both to encourage more states to endorse the PSI and 
encourage states that have already endorsed to participate 
more actively.  We look forward to continuing our work 
together in support of the PSI. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Patricia A. McNerney 
Acting Assistant Secretary for International Security and 
Nonproliferation, 
Department of State
