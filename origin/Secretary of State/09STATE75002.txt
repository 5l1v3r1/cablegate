        7-17-09) 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request for Consulate General 
Toronto.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND: According to REF A, the Government of 
Canada (GOC) would welcome United States Government (USG) 
discussions with Canadian commercial entities regarding the 
extraction of Helium-3 (He-3). The Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) emphasized Ontario 
Power's strong interest in pursuing discussions with USG 
officials on Helium-3 extraction and underlined the GOC's 
view that it play no "governmental" role in any commercial 
discussions. REF B contains detailed background information 
on the shortage of He-3 and its implications while REF C 
proposes an approach for extracting He-3 in Canada. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post is requested to pass REF C and 
arrange a meeting with the appropriate Ontario Power 
officials to discuss the items in paragraph 4 during the week 
of August 25, 2009 or September 1, 2009.  In order to be 
better prepared to discuss specifics of an extraction process 
that might be used at the Ontario Power storage facility, 
Washington requests technical information on Ontario Power's 
storage units and layout of the facility in advance of the 
meeting.  It is also requested, but not required, that a tour 
of the storage facility be arranged as part of the visit. The 
tentative USG delegation is listed in paragraph 5. Please 
note that Washington is assuming that a representative from 
post will be available to participate in the meeting, should 
that be desired. 
 
¶4. (SBU) PROPOSED AGENDA: 
 
-- Introduction & Purpose of the visit 
-- He-3 Background 
-- Predicted He-3 demand and supply 
-- Impact on Radiation Detection 
-- Investigate vehicles that would allow for the harvesting 
of Ontario Power's He-3 
-- Open Discussion 
 
¶5. (SBU) TENTATIVE DELEGATION: 
 
--Greg Slovik (U.S. Department of Homeland Security) 
--Roger Lewis (U.S. Department of Energy) 
--Joseph Glaser (U.S. Department of Energy) 
--Michael Curry (U.S. Department of State) 
--2-3 Technical Experts (Savannah River National Laboratory) 
--Consulate General Toronto Staff 
 
¶6. (SBU) REPORTING DEADLINE:  Washington requests that Post 
respond via front-channel cable no later than July 24, 2009. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Washington appreciates Post's assistance.  Contact
