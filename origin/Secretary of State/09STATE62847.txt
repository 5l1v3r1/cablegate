fides of end-user, Grauwolf, by making inquiries to

and selling defense articles in Germany?  What services and 
products does your company provide? 
 
--Who are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What are you annual sales of defense articles and services?

on this license as compared to previous export licenses 
issued by the United States Government? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To German Authorities) 
 
--Is Grauwolf authorized to import and sell ammunition in 
Germany?  Do you have any information on Grauwolf or Wolfgang
