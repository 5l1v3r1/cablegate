Presidential Statement on the Situation in Abyei 
 
The Security Council welcomes the June 8 Road Map For 
Return of IDPs and Implementation of Abyei Protocol 
between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement describing a plan for the return of 
internally displaced persons and implementation of the 
Abyei Protocol.  We underscore that peaceful resolution of 
the situation in Abyei is vital to the effective 
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and 
peace in that region, and we urge the parties to use the 
opportunity created by the signing of the Road Map to find 
a final political settlement to support sustainable peace 
in the region, including resolution on issues such as the 
Abyei boundary and revenue sharing. 
 
The Security Council regrets the recent outbreak of 
fighting in Abyei and the ensuing displacement of 
civilians and untold human suffering.  We urge the parties 
to resolve the Abyei dispute by peaceful means and avoid 
further conflict. 
 
The Security Council encourages both parties to pursue the 
actions outlined in the Road Map For Return of IDPs and 
Implementation of Abyei Protocol, in particular the 
establishment of an Abyei Area Administration; deployment 
of a new Joint Integrated Unit Battalion; unfettered 
access for the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS); 
and redeployment of the Sudan Armed Forces and Sudan 
People's Liberation Movement troops outside the interim 
Abyei administrative area agreed to by the parties.  It is 
imperative that the parties move forward without delay on 
the arrangement for a final settlement as outlined in the 
Road Map For Return of IDPs and Implementation of Abyei 
Protocol. 
 
The Security Council reiterates its deepest concern for 
those persons affected by the recent violence in Abyei. 
The Security Council stresses the importance of 
international support for the return of displaced persons 
to their homes, a political process, and the arbitration 
process set forth in the Road Map.  We call for UNMIS, 
within its mandate, to deploy forces vigorously in and 
around Abyei and to help reduce tensions and prevent 
escalation of conflict through well-considered strategic 
deployment and highly responsive tactical movements in 
support of implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement, and we emphasize that an effective UN force in 
Abyei is crucial for security in the region.  The Security 
Council requests the Secretary General review the role of 
UNMIS in the lead-up, during, and following the exchange 
of fire between parties in Abyei in May 2008 and consider 
what follow-up steps may be appropriate.
