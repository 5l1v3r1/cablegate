foreign end-user, Fuego de Indios, S.A. (FDI) is in continued 
possession of the aircraft and that it is being used for the 
purpose stated on the license application. Post is also asked 
to verify that the subject helicopter has been demilitarized 
and that all fixed hard-points have been removed, as was 
required prior to export of the aircraft per provisos 1 and 2
