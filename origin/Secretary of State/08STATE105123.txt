TAGS: PREL UNGA PM
SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR HEAD OF STATE-LEVEL DEMARCHE BY 
AMBASSADOR 
 
¶1.  This is an action request for the Ambassador or 
Charge. 
 
OBJECTIVE 
--------- 
 
¶2.  To seek tangible improvements in UNGA voting by Panama 
as part of a targeted effort to engage 17 friendly 
countries whose UNGA voting records vary sharply from 
their close relations with the United States.  The President 
and the 
Secretary have endorsed this initiative. 
 
ACTION REQUESTED 
---------------- 
 
¶3. To align Panama's voting record more 
closely with that 
of the U.S. on key votes, the Ambassador or Charge' is 
requested to meet with the Head of State, upon his return 
from UNGA, and deliver a demarche bringing his attention 
to Panama's low voting coincidence with the U.S. (when 
not including consensus resolutions).  If the 
Head of State is not available to receive the demarche 
within a reasonable time, the meeting should be held with 
the Foreign Minister. 
 
TALKING POINTS 
-------------- 
 
¶4. Ambassador or Charge may draw on the following points: 
 
-- As allies, the United States and Panama 
cooperate and work closely together in many areas.  (Post may 
add specific examples at its own discretion).  We have many 
ties of friendship as well as common hopes, 
principles, and values. 
 
-- Yet in 2007 Panama voted with the U.S. 
in the UN 
General Assembly only 14.3 % of the time, when not 
including consensus votes. 
 
-- The United States views the United Nations as having 
great potential for achieving progress on many issues.  If 
agreement and widespread support among Member States can 
be reached for balanced and responsible resolutions, 
decisions, and other initiatives it would make the UN more 
effective and a more credible voice in the world. 
 
-- We understand that some votes may be explained by 
solidarity with regional groups or blocs based on other 
factors, but, in our view, such solidarity often appears 
inconsistent with the national interests and policies of 
your government outside the unique culture of the United 
Nations. 
 
-- As the new session of the UN General Assembly begins, I 
hope you will bear in mind that in the U.S. both the 
President and the Congress view UN voting coincidence as a 
barometer of the closeness of a bilateral relationship. 
 
-- In the coming weeks I hope we can begin a dialogue 
between our experts and yours on how we might better 
improve cooperation on issues of importance before the UN. 
 
End Points. 
 
BACKGROUND ON THIS INITIATIVE 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Key issues of importance to U.S. policy interests are 
being brought increasingly to vote in the UN.  These 
include human rights, the UN budget, Israel, and 
development assistance.  At the same time, the Group of 77 
(G-77) and Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) bloc is more unified 
and votes consistently against the U.S.  The Department 
and other agencies have been working on a long-term 
strategy to counter these developments in the General 
Assembly.  A key element of the Department's strategy is 
the delivery of demarches at the most senior level in 17 
select capitals on UNGA voting records, U.S. priorities, 
and areas where we might work together more effectively. 
This is the first requested demarche, which seeks tangible 
improvements in UNGA voting by the host country.  Details 
on each UN Member State's most recent voting records are 
available on the Department's website at 
www.state.gov/p/io/rls/rpt/c25867/.htm in the annual 
report to Congress entitled "Voting Practices in the 
United Nations 2007."  The Department and other agencies 
believe that the diversity of national interests and 
ideologies outside the UN can be translated into better 
voting inside the UN through friendly but assertive 
approaches to G-77/NAM countries that have reasonably good 
relations with the U.S.
