SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - SYRIA 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning alerts U.S. citizens to ongoing 
safety and security concerns in Syria.  American citizens 
are urged to thoroughly consider the risks of travel to 
Syria and to take adequate precautions to ensure their 
safety.  This supersedes the Travel Warning for Syria 
issued on September 18, 2007. 
 
¶2.  A number of terrorist groups that oppose U.S. policies 
have offices in Syria.  Since 1979, the United States has 
designated Syria a State Sponsor of Terrorism due to its 
support for organizations such as Hizbollah, Hamas, and 
Palestinian Islamic Jihad.  In addition, other extremist 
groups are present in Syria.  These groups have the 
potential to be either the targets of or perpetrators of 
acts of violence.  On February 12, 2008, an explosion 
occurred in the residential Kafer Soseh neighborhood of 
Damascus, killing Imad Moughniyeh, a senior Hizbollah 
operative.  In 2006, the U.S. Embassy in Damascus was 
attacked by terrorists armed with guns, grenades, and a car 
bomb.  The Syrian Government has allowed anti-U.S. 
demonstrations to occur; the latest was on March 3, 2008. 
Anti-U.S. demonstrations date back to September 2005, some 
of which have turned violent and led to damage to Western 
embassies, including the U.S. Embassy. 
 
¶3.  U.S. citizens who remain in or travel to Syria are 
encouraged to register at the consular section of the U.S. 
Embassy in Damascus, and to obtain updated information on 
travel and security in Syria.  Americans in Syria should 
exercise caution and take prudent measures to maintain 
their security.  These measures include being aware of 
their surroundings, avoiding crowds and demonstrations, 
keeping a low profile, varying times and routes for all 
travel, and ensuring travel documents are current. 
 
¶4.  U.S. consular personnel remain available to provide 
emergency information and services to American citizens. 
The U.S. Embassy in Damascus, Syria, is located at 2, Al- 
Mansour St., Abu Roumaneh. The Embassy telephone number is 
(963) (11) 3391-4444, fax (963) (11) 331-9678, e-mail: 
acsdamascus@state.gov. American citizens may register with 
the Embassy online by visiting 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs. Additional 
information may be found on the Embassy website at 
http://usembassy.state.gov/damascus. 
 
¶5.  Updated information on travel and security in Syria may 
be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1-888- 
407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, from 
overseas, 1-202-501-4444.  Additional details can be found 
in the Department of State's Country Specific Information 
for Syria, and the Worldwide Caution, which are available 
on the Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶6. Minimize considered.
