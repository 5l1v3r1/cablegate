SUBJECT: CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: TALKING POINTS FOR 
MARCH 10 BRIEFING 
 
Â¶1.  USUN may draw from the following points for the March 10 
Security Council briefing with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) for the 
Central African Republic (CAR) Francois Fall. 
 
Begin points: 
 
-- The United States would like to thank SRSG Fall for his 
briefing today and for his service to CAR and the 
international community.  We urge the Secretary General to 
quickly appoint a successor to SRSG Fall given that 
implementation of the Inclusive Political Dialogue is at a 
critical stage. 
 
-- The United States congratulates the government, opposition 
parties, and participating rebel groups for their agreement 
to abide by Inclusive Political Dialogue recommendations, 
however we are concerned that recent violence in northern CAR 
has endangered the peace the Dialogue aimed to achieve.  We 
urge all parties to renew their commitment to peace and to 
implement Dialogue recommendations for the good of the CAR 
and its people. 
 
-- The United States condemns the attacks and retaliation in 
Northern CAR that has led to 18,000 new IDPs and refugees. 
We urge all rebel groups who have not done so to join the 
peace process and call on all foreign 
governments to refrain from sheltering or supporting any 
rebel groups that remain outside the peace process. 
 
-- The Government of the Central African Republic (CARG) 
needs to show progress toward equitable power 
sharing and an inclusive government, paving the way for 
presidential and parliamentary elections in 2010. 
 
-- Swift implementation of UN disarmament, demobilization, 
and reintegration (DDR) programs is critical and rebel groups 
should immediately submit their list of combatants for 
demobilization.  The government should work with UNDP to 
ensure prompt disbursement and use of Central African 
Monetary and Economic Community (CEMAC) funds for DDR. 
 
-- We remain concerned about the plight of children in CAR 
and note that the Secretary-General's recent report on 
Children and Armed Conflict in the Central African Republic. 
We call on the government, as well as on all other actors, 
including rebels and bandits, to cease violence against 
children. 
 
--  If the international community is going to support a 
national vision for rebuilding peace and stability, then 
implementation of the SYG's recommendations for an integrated 
peacebuilding mission in Bangui will be an 
important step toward ensuring donor coordination and 
attention to national capacity-building. 
 
-- The Peacebuilding Commission should continue to work with 
the national government in forming an overall peacebuilding 
strategy, and mobilizing support of new and returning donors. 
 
 
-- Because of CAR's continued vulnerability to opportunistic 
foreign armed groups, we are pleased that the UN Mission in 
the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) will 
continue to have a role in northeastern CAR.
