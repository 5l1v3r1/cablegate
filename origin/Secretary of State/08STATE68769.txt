¶1.  (U) USG agencies welcome Embassy Baghdad,s follow-up on 
the Dialogue on Economic Cooperation (DEC) (REF A).  We 
concur with the division of labor and suggestions for USG 
action and appreciate Embassy Econ,s work with GOI 
counterparts to maintain the momentum the DEC afforded to the 
USG-GOI bilateral economic relationship. 
 
¶2.  (U) In response to REF A, comments and updates from 
Washington agencies follow.  Washington agencies remain very 
interested in seeing the GOI complete ratification procedures 
for the agreements agreed upon in the 2005 JCRED, and would 
welcome an update from post on their status. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
-- (SBU) The Council of Representatives (CoR) should be urged 
to ratify the TIFA.  DPM Barham Salih,s statement during the 
DEC meeting that the private sector should act as if the TIFA 
were ratified is encouraging, but is not a substitute for CoR 
action. 
 
-- (U) The Office of the United States Trade Representative 
(USTR) in Washington is leading preparations for an upcoming 
TIFA Council meeting with Iraq.  Pending entry into force of 
our bilateral TIFA, the U.S. and Iraq agreed during the DEC 
talks to discuss a wide range of trade and investment issues, 
including U.S.-Iraq cooperation on Iraq,s WTO accession at 
the inaugural meeting of the TIFA Council.  USTR requests 
that Embassy Baghdad propose to the Government of Iraq (GOI) 
that we hold the initial two-day TIFA meeting in November 
¶2008.  Suggested dates are the week of November 3-7, November 
12-14, or alternatively, the week of November 17-21.  The 
first two options would enable GOI officials and private 
business representatives to attend the November 9-13 Pack 
Expo food packaging event in Chicago.  (Note section on 
Agriculture, below). 
 
-- (U) To encourage U.S. private sector investment in Iraq 
and showcase investment opportunities, the Department of 
Commerce (DOC) is leading an official trade mission to Erbil, 
Iraqi, June 22-25.  Additionally, DOC is in the early 
planning stages for a second trade mission to Al-Anbar this 
fall. 
 
-- (U) DOC is supporting the GOI in developing a legislative 
and regulatory action plan through the work of its Commercial 
Law Development Program (CLDP).  CLDP continues to train CoR 
and the Ministry of Oil,s Petroleum Contracting and 
Licensing Directorate on petroleum exploration and 
development of contracts and technical service agreements. 
CLDP will also partner with Iraq,s Higher Judicial Council 
as well as the Judicial Training Institute to engage in 
judicial capacity building on commercial laws. 
 
-- (U) DOC is working to provide substantive guidance to the 
GOI on promoting public awareness of the positive effect that 
free trade has on the Iraqi economy. In coordination with 
USTR and per the request of the Iraqi Commercial Attache, DOC 
will produce a one-page document on the benefits of free 
trade to Iraq. 
 
-- (U) DOC is currently updating its business guide for Iraq, 
building on work undertaken in USAID,s Izdihar (now Tijara) 
program.  Additionally, DOC is creating a guide to investing 
in Iraq, written primarily for new businesses entering the 
Iraqi market. This guide will supplement and update the 
Izdihar roadmap, serving as a first reference for businesses 
exploring the Iraqi investment environment.  Once complete, 
the guide will be available on the IIRTF website. 
 
-- (U) USTR has initiated discussions with Iraqi trade and 
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) officials.   During 
November 2007 meetings in Amman, Jordan between USTR and 
Iraqi officials, Iraq suggested that USG and Iraqi IPR 
experts hold working-level IPR meetings in London.  Although 
 
STATE 00068769  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
such meetings have not yet occurred, USTR continues to urge 
that such meetings be scheduled as soon as possible at 
mutually convenient times and places.  DOC, USTR, the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and State will continue 
to work together to lay the groundwork for a dialogue with 
the Iraqis on IPR.  USTR continues to offer assistance to 
Iraq on amending Iraq,s IPR laws and requests that Iraq 
provide a copy of its draft IPR laws to USG as soon as 
possible.  To the extent that USAID,s Tijara program will be 
working on IPR issues in Iraq, USTR requests that Tijara 
coordinate efforts with USG officials in Washington. 
 
-- (U) USTR is working with Iraqi Commercial Consulate 
officials in Washington on export opportunities under GSP and 
is meeting with DOD to identify GSP-eligible exports that 
might be exported by Iraqi state owned enterprises (SOEs). In 
addition, USTR is coordinating with Post to identify PRTs 
interested in integrating export opportunities under GSP into 
their economic development efforts. 
 
-- (U) DOC is assisting USTR,s effort to educate Iraqi 
businesses on the benefits of GSP.  Where appropriate, DOC 
will work with the commercial service to better promote the 
use of GSP and assist in match-making. 
 
-- (U) A consistent and predictable commercial legal 
environment includes mechanisms that promote the settlement 
of disputes by means other than through litigation.  DOC,s 
business and investment guide will reflect the importance of 
alternative dispute resolution techniques including the 
adoption of appropriate international arbitration mechanisms. 
 
----------- 
Agriculture 
----------- 
 
-- (U) Contingent upon availability of funding, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) intends to conduct 
additional Iraq Agricultural Extension Revitalization (IAER) 
training seminars both in-country and elsewhere as necessary. 
 
-- (U) USDA also intends to support improvement of the Iraqi 
digital videoconferencing capability for advancing education 
in extension between the Iraqi extension system, USDA, and 
its land grant university partners. 
 
-- (U) DOC is encouraging Iraqi businessmen and government 
ministers to attend PACK EXPO in Chicago on November 9 - 13. 
PACK EXPO is the largest food packaging and processing 
exhibition held in the United States. 
 
---------- 
Labor Code 
---------- 
 
-- (U) Given that there is no permanent labor law in Iraq and 
no law governing industrial relations, USTR urges the GOI to 
pass the new labor code, which has been under review for 
several years.  Until the GOI replaces the 1987 labor code, 
which restricts or prohibits the exercise of the most basic 
labor freedoms and falls short of Congressional requirements 
for Iraq to be designated as a beneficiary developing country 
under GSP, the status of industrial relations remains 
ambiguous in Iraq. 
 
¶3.  (U) During the February DEC meetings, Iraqi National 
Security Adviser Rubaie discussed six issues of importance 
with Under Secretary Jeffery, requesting USG input on each. 
Embassy Baghdad is requested to provide a status report for E 
on post,s response to Rubaie. 
 
¶4.  (U) Washington agencies look forward to further progress 
updates from Embassy Baghdad, and is ready and willing to 
provide the assistance necessary to continue moving forward 
in the USG,s bilateral relationship with the GOI.
