Â¶1. (SBU) A/DCM conveyed reftel points to MFA Americas Desk 
Director Ahmed Aoun on December 30.  Aoun took our points on 
board, but stressed that while HAMAS' decision to break the 
ceasefire had precipitated Israel's military strikes in Gaza, 
the decision to execute rocket attacks had come against the 
backdrop of the ongoing "siege" of Gaza.  Any durable cease-fire 
would therefore need to include the immediate lifting of 
Israel's blockade against Gaza to facilitate humanitarian 
assistance.  In both the AL Ministerial and discussions at the 
UN, Libya intended to continue calling for a course of action 
consisting of: 1) an immediate end to HAMAS' rocket attacks; 2) 
an immediate cessation of Israeli military operations in and 
around Gaza, and: 3) an immedate lifting of the blockade against 
Gaza to permit the in-flow of humanitarian assistance.  Aoun 
expected that a call for lifting the blockade of Gaza would be a 
component of any statement issued in conjunction with the AL 
Ministerial, and was careful to note that Libya had and would 
argued for balanced statements at the AL Ministerial.  He had no 
information on who from the GOL would represent Libya at the 
Ministerial meeting.  He reiterated points reported ref B, 
saying Libya and Arab League states with whom the GOL has 
consulted continue to believe that the correct address for 
action is the UNSC, and that the appropriate mechanism for UN 
intervention is a UNSCR.
