REF: STATE 130963 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) CDA delivered reftel demarche to Dr. Ahmed Fituri, MFA 
Secretary for the Americas (A/S-equivalent) on December 14, 
encouraging a 'yes' vote and stressing that any amendments to 
the current draft resolution language would likely prevent it 
from being passed.  Fituri undertook to pass reftel points to 
Foreign Minister Shalgham (who was unavailable to meet) as a 
direct message from Secretary Rice, and called later to say that 
he had done so.  He made a point of noting Muammar al-Qadhafi's 
advocacy of a one state ("Isratine") solution, but said the GOL 
had not yet decided its position on the Annapolis process UNSCR.
