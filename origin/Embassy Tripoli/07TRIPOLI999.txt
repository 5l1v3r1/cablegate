SUBJECT: LIBYAN ORGANIZATION ISSUES STATEMENT OPPOSING AFRICOM 
 
¶1.  On November 21, the Community of Sahel and Saharan States 
(Cen-Sad) issued a statement at its Tripoli headquarters 
"categorically rejecting" Africom and any foreign military 
presence in any Cen-Sad member country.  The statement noted 
that Cen-Sad represents roughly half of Africa's territory and 
population.  In the statement, Cen-Sad expressed its full 
support for a statement issued by the South African Minister of 
Defense rejecting any foreign military presence in Africa. 
 
¶2.  Comment:  Created in the Libyan coastal town of Sirte in 
February 1998, Cen-Sad includes 25 members from Senegal to 
Somalia.  Originally conceived to focus on infrastructure 
investments in northern Africa, Cen-Sad now serves as a 
Libyan-led political coordination mechanism operating in 
parallel to the African Union.  Cen-Sad's opposition to Africom 
echoes long-standing GOL objections to the presence of foreign 
forces on the African continent and reflects Libya's experience 
under Italian occupation and Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi's 
attendant anti-foreign rhetoric.  End comment.
