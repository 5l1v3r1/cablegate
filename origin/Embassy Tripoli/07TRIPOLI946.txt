1.(U) The Charge delivered reftel demarche to MFA Secretary for Americas Affairs Dr. Ahmed Fituri November 1. Fituri offered no substantive response, but undertook to convey to the appropriate authorities the request that the GOL take parallel measures. Noting Libya's recent election to a non-permanent UNSC seat, Fituri stressed Libya's readiness to "do its international duty" with respect to such requests. MILAM 0 11/07/2007
