COOPERATION 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  United Nations Development Program (UNDP) 
Resident Representative Julio Grieco told poloff September 17 
that there were opportunities for the Middle East Partnership 
Initiative (MEPI) to expand on activities already underway in 
Libya that focus on education, financial sector reform, and 
gender.  He urged, however, that MEPI consider expanding its 
focus to include healthcare, explaining that the public health 
system in Libya is in very poor condition and urgently needs 
assistance.  Grieco, who concurrently serves as United Nations 
Resident Coordinator in Libya, also discussed UNDP's role in 
human rights promotion, including women's empowerment; UNDP's 
mandate and programs; and other UN agencies in Libya.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
PLEA TO SUPPORT HEALTHCARE REFORM IN LIBYA 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) Grieco explained that the USG can make an immediate 
impact in Libya by focusing on public health.  While explaining 
that Libya needs better medical resources, professional 
training, and patient care, he noted a special need for 
improving the management of the health care system.  UNDP's 
health-related programs, Grieco said, include an HIV-AIDS 
prevention program; upgrading of the orthopedic workshop and 
rehabilitation center for the disabled in Benghazi; drug abuse 
control and treatment; and eradication of the screw-worm.

UNDP HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION AND WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT PROJECTS 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Grieco stressed that UNDP does not address human rights 
abuses through reporting or lobbying.  The UN has an office in 
Geneva that addresses the human rights situation in Libya, 
Grieco said, adding that the UN does not take a "negative 
approach" in Libya, but rather seeks a constructive form of 
engagement.  By cooperatively working with the Government of 
Libya (GOL) to develop awareness about human rights, Grieco 
asserted, UNDP balances the alienating impact on the GOL of 
reports of abuse of those rights.  He explained that UNDP 
contributes to the promotion of respect for human rights through 
several of its development programs: (1) training judges, 
prosecutors and academics; (2) women's empowerment training; (3) 
training government and law enforcement officials to reduce 
demand for and supply of illicit drugs.  Grieco noted that 
experts believe drug abuse to be the leading cause of the spread 
of HIV/AIDS in Libya. 
 
¶4.  (U) Grieco provided a formal, written report on UNDP's 
programs in Libya that included a description of its women's 
empowerment work.  According to the report, UNDP has launched a 
project for "Advocacy and Capacity Building on Women's 
Empowerment" in Libya.  The program draws on the UN's global 
effort to "mainstream gender into development activities."  As 
part of the program, UNDP held a capacity-building seminar this 
year aimed at national and local authorities.  UNDP organized 
the seminar in conjunction with the government-run organization 
Wa'atessemo and the United Nations Development Fund for Women 
(UNIFEM). UNDP has proposed to the GOL the development of four 
new projects that will, respectively: (1) support women 
entrepreneurs; (b) compile gender disaggregated statistics; (c) 
examine the impact on women of Libya's legal framework, and 
enhance women's participation in the development process; and 
(d) address the gender dimension of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

UNDP'S MANDATE AND PROGRAMS 
 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) UNDP has been in Libya since 1950, has a staff of 17, 
and receives its funding from the Libyan government, according 
to Grieco.  It focuses on technical assistance to achieve 
national development goals.  In addition to the programs listed 
above, UNDP has projects that address the following issues: 
agriculture, education, vocational training, meteorological 
services, millennium development goals, decentralization and 
local government, veterinary services, and water resources 
management.  In the near future, UNDP will focus on information 
and communications technologies, and environmental capacity and 
strategies. 
 
-------------------- 
 
UN AGENCIES IN LIBYA 
 
-------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Since Libya is a net contributing country to the UN, 
Grieco explained, it funds the UN's work in Libya.  The UN 
agencies, however, Grieco claimed, operate by UN rules and make 
their own hiring and policy decisions.  The following agencies 
currently operate in Libya (staff size in parentheses): Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) (1); United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) (12); United Nations 
Information Centers (UNICs) (4); World Health Organization (WHO) 
(4); United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) (2).  The 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) does not have a permanent presence in Libya, Grieco 
said, but UNESCO officials have visited Libya on several 
occasions to provide children with vaccinations.  UNDP also 
receives funding from New York, Grieco said, without specifying 
the percentage of the budget that comes from New York.  UNHCR 
receives all of its funding from Geneva, Grieco said, since it 
does not serve Libyan citizens.
