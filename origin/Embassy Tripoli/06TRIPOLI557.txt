SUBJECT: PROJECT LIBYA:  EXHIBITION TO PROMOTE INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT 
 
¶1.  The 4-7 December Project Libya exhibition is underway 
following a well-attended press launch on September 17. 
Organizers Montgomery Libya and Sahara Expo Libya presided over 
a packed house of reporters, businessmen and local embassy staff 
at the Corinthia Hotel.  Jeremy Sale, Montgomery Libya's Project 
Director for Libya, took the lead at the press conference, and 
reviewed both the expected participants in the project, and its 
politically-connected GOL backing.  Hotel arrangements and visa 
support for attendees will be coordinated by Mr. Saleh Ben-Saleh 
of the Libya Businessman's Council.  The Wa'atassemo Charity 
Society's Abdul Nasser Nageh, Chairman of the Conferences 
Committee also offered his assistance in addressing whatever 
issues arise.   He told P/E Chief that Ali Aujali of the Libyan 
People's Bureau (Embassy) in Washington agreed to expedite visa 
requests, although there would be a 100 Libyan dinar surcharge 
for any "airport" visas stamped in passports at Tripoli 
International Airport.  He described a multi-step process, 
whereby exhibition participants would send an application via a 
designated U.S. travel agent to the Libyan Businessmen's 
Council. Then the Business Council will coordinate with the 
Wa'atessemo Society to issue letters of support to the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Relations Consular Department and Americas Department, as well 
as the Immigration Department.  After the Immigration Department 
clears all the applications and issues approval numbers, the 
Libyan Businessmen's Council will convey that information to the 
designated U.S. travel agent, who will in turn contact the 
exhibition participant and coordinate submission of all the 
required paperwork to the Libyan People's Bureau.   He 
acknowledged that there were many potential areas for a 
breakdown in communication and visa delays.

¶2.  Project Libya will be hosted under the patronage of Dr. 
Aisha Muammar al-Qaddafi and her Wa'atassemo Foundation, and 
consist of two distinct exhibitions: Infrastructure Libya and 
Energy Libya (or the International Exhibition and Forum for 
Libya's Infrastructure and Economic Development and the Libyan 
International Oil, Gas, Power and Renewable Energy Exhibition 
and Forum), both to be held at the Tripoli International 
Fairground.  The exhibition will be paired with a running series 
of parallel seminars covering a broad range of infrastructure 
and energy issues, and the organizers are still soliciting 
presenters for an anticipated forty-eight separate fora.  The 
exhibitions boast a panoply of cooperating GOL entities, 
including the General People's Committee for Planning, General 
Board of Infrastructure and Urban Development, Inspector General 
of Housing and Utilities, General People's Committee for 
Industry, Electricity and Mines, National Oil Corporation (NOC) 
and General Electric Company of Libya (along with a dozens of 
supporting organizations).  A representative for the NOC 
provided words of support at the event, noting Libya's plans to 
increase oil production and the massive foreign investment that 
endeavor will require.

~and Great Expectations For The International Crowd 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3.  Montgomery Libya highlighted the anticipated establishment 
of pavilions by the US, UK, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, 
Singapore, Canada, France, Malta, Turkey and South Korea. 
Pol/Econ Chief addressed the audience to emphasize the Commerce 
Department's certification of Project Libya and and U.S. 
interest in expanding the bilateral economic and commercial 
relationship. Major corporations Chevron, Baker Hughes, Booz 
Allen Hamilton, Conoco Phillips, Halliburton, Marathon and 
Occidental were highlighted as key exhibitors and sponsors of 
the event. 
 
¶4.  The exhibition organizers request that the U.S. government 
consider providing speakers for the program, although at this 
time they do not have a list of planned seminars or topics.  At 
this point, they are trying to encourage people to attend the 
event, and will plan workshops or speakers later.   Nageh said 
that "networking" was the primary motivation for the event and 
that his goal was to get "buzz" by adding high-profile names to 
the promotional materials. 
 
¶5.  Looking ahead, next year's Project Libya has been booked at 
the Tripoli International Fairground from 3-6 December 2007.
