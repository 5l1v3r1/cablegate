SUBJECT: MAPPING THE BORDER: CONSTRUCTION UNDERWAY ON NEW U.S. LAND 
PORT OF ENTRY AT CALAIS, MAINE--NEW BRIDGE AND CANADIAN FACILITY ON 
SCHEDULE 
 
REF: (A) HALIFAX 0028; (B) 07 HALIFAX 0012 
 
¶1. According to the GSA Regional Office in Boston, the 
contractor building the new Land Port of Entry (LPOE) for 
DHS/CBP at Calais, Maine, has completed about 10% of the work. 
Meanwhile, the Maine Department of Transportation (MDOT) 
contractor building the new international bridge across the St. 
Croix River is on schedule to finish by September 2008 and the 
new Canadian LPOE is expected to be built by the end of December 
¶2008. Thus, there is a strong likelihood that the new bridge 
will sit idle for ten months while commercial and tourist 
traffic continue clog the streets of Calais, ME, and St. 
Stephen, NB. GSA expects the contractor to complete the entire 
$48 million, 52-acre facility by November 2009. Despite efforts 
by GSA, it appears highly unlikely that the construction of the 
LPOE can be sequenced so as to accommodate a partial opening for 
commercial-only traffic in the summer of 2009. 
 
¶2. The U.S. construction firm began working on the new U.S. LPOE 
in February 2008; however, the official ground breaking ceremony 
occurred in mid-April. Maine's Governor John Baldacci, Senator 
Susan Collins, and Congressman Mike Michaud were on hand for the 
event, as was GSA Administrator Doan. In her speech, 
Administrator Doan noted that, "This is the first time in our 
nation's history that we have four new Land Ports of Entry...all 
under construction at one time." Two of the four are on the 
southern border. The other two are in Jackman and Calais, Maine. 
 
¶3. Administrator Doan went on to say that, "GSA is igniting a 
building boom at land ports across the nation, building what we 
can, where we can, as fast as we can. We need more inspection 
booths, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure to meet demands 
from legitimate trade and travelers who are too often caught in 
long lines...Expect GSA to push this issue with even greater 
urgency--not tomorrow, but today. We will build on the excellent 
start already made in Calais and Jackman. Our focus will be to 
identify, approve and begin construction on a number of 
projects, both large and small, at every single land port where 
traffic is stalled." (NB: GSA Administrator Doan announced her 
resignation on April 30, 2008. David Bibb is now Acting 
Administrator.) 
 
¶4. COMMENT: Having construction underway on the new U.S. LPOE 
project in Calais is a positive development that will eventually 
lead to the decongestion of the streets of Calais and St. 
Stephen. Still, the asynchronous construction schedules will 
mean that we can anticipate continued complaints and political 
pressure from businesses and travelers (from both sides of the 
border) who are caught up in the ongoing delays at the existing 
crossings at Ferry Point and Milltown--especially if the new 
bridge and Canadian border facility are completed on time, ten 
months ahead of the U.S. facility. END COMMENT.
