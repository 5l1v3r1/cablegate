¶1. INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY 
======================= 
 
Despite the downturn in the global economy, for the most part, 
investment in Atlantic Canada's energy sector is still strong 
(REFTELS). Large energy companies and industry stakeholders are 
taking a long-term approach, predicting that by the time large 
investments such as Newfoundland-Labrador's Hebron offshore oil 
projects are ready to come on stream the international economy 
will have recovered sufficiently to ensure their viability. 
Looking at specific energy sectors, in the offshore, Hebron, 
Hibernia South and Deep Panuke are all moving along as planned 
and there is also high interest in further exploration 
opportunities.  Onshore exploration and development is also a 
bright spot as is the region's LNG sector. On the negative side, 
there are some delays in the oil refining and electricity 
generation sectors. END INTRODUCTION/ SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PROJECTS 
================================ 
 
--Hebron Offshore Oil Project (Newfoundland-Labrador): 
Development work ongoing 
 
ExxonMobil, which took over from Chevron as the lead partner in 
the development, has begun detailed planning for the project. 
The company expects to submit a development plan to provincial 
and federal regulators in December 2010. 
 
--Hibernia South Oil Project (Newfoundland-Labrador): 
Development work ongoing 
 
The Hibernia partners are focused on planning and design work 
and are expecting to complete an environmental review by March 
¶2009. 
 
--Deep Panuke Offshore Natural Gas Project (Nova Scotia): 
Development work ongoing 
 
Although project owner EnCana has acknowledged that the company 
is taking a conservative approach to spending, it does not 
anticipate making any changes to its investments in Deep Panuke. 
 
 
--New Offshore Exploration (Newfoundland-Labrador and Nova 
Scotia):  Ongoing 
 
The Canada-Newfoundland/Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board, which 
regulates the province oil and gas industry, said on December 2 
that it had received bids totaling $2.4 million for two offshore 
parcels. Husky Oil was the sole bidder of $1,800,000 on a parcel 
in the Sydney Basin, while European-owned PDI Production of St. 
John's made a successful bid of $600,000 for a parcel off the 
west coast. Two other parcels in the Sydney Basin and another 
off the west coast raised no bids. In Nova Scotia's offshore, 
the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board has issued a 
Call for Bids for two deepwater parcels southwest of Sable 
Island. Interested parties have until Friday, June 26, 2009 to 
submit their bids. 
 
¶3. Onshore Oil/Gas Activity 
=========================== 
 
--Further Development of the McCully Field (New Brunswick): 
Ongoing 
 
Corridor Resources Inc. of Nova Scotia has made what it calls a 
"potentially significant" oil discovery some three kilometers 
southeast of its already producing McCully natural gas field in 
southern New Brunswick. The company will soon be undertaking 
long-term testing as part of its appraisal of the discovery. 
 
--Stealth Ventures Coal-Bed Methane project (Nova Scotia): 
Development work ongoing 
 
The company said recently that it is advancing towards 
commercialization of its project. 
 
¶4. LNG PROJECTS 
=============== 
 
--Canaport LNG Facility (New Brunswick):  Construction nearing 
completion 
 
Irving Oil, with partner Repsol, has finished 87% of the 
construction of the project and expects to begin commercial 
 
HALIFAX 00000084  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
shipments of natural gas in the first quarter of 2009. 
 
--Maple LNG (Nova Scotia):  Development work ongoing 
 
Project proponents are currently focused on obtaining regulatory 
permits to construct a short connector pipeline to the existing 
Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline. 
 
--Newfoundland LNG Terminal:  Proceeding 
 
The proponents said in early November that despite uncertain 
economic times they were still proceeding with the project 
 
¶5. Refineries 
============= 
 
--Proposed Second Irving Refinery (New Brunswick): Awaiting 
decision 
 
Irving Oil and partner BP will decide at the end of 2009 whether 
to go ahead with the project.  In the meantime, the partners are 
focusing on completing the provincial and federal environmental 
assessments. 
 
--Expansion of the North Atlantic Refinery 
(Newfoundland-Labrador):  On hold 
 
Harvest Energy, the Canadian owner of the North Atlantic 
Refinery in Come By Chance, NL, said on December 2 that the 
planned $2-billion expansion of the refinery will proceed as 
soon as international financial markets have calmed and an 
investment partner is on board.  This is the second time this 
fall that the company announced a delay in the project. 
 
--Newfoundland-Labrador Refinery Project:  Delayed 
 
Proponent Newfoundland-Labrador Refinery has been under 
bankruptcy protection since the early summer. Company officials 
report that the company's future will now be determined by its 
creditors. 
 
¶6. Electrical Generation Projects 
================================= 
 
--Lower Churchill (Newfoundland-Labrador):  Under consideration 
 
There have been no new developments with the project, but the 
Newfoundland-Labrador government is stepping up the pressure on 
the federal government to get involved so that laid-off mining 
and forestry workers will have new employment opportunities.  In 
the meantime, the Innu Nation and the Newfoundland-Labrador 
government reached an agreement on potential impacts and 
benefits from the project once it gets underway. 
 
--Point Lepreau Nuclear Power Refurbishment Project (New 
Brunswick):  Behind schedule 
 
The $1.4 billion refurbishment of the reactor at New Brunswick's 
Point Lepreau nuclear plant is behind schedule. The contractor, 
Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., is experiencing some mechanical 
difficulties. Also, in October two new, high-speed turbine 
rotors destined for installation in the refurbished facility 
fell off a barge in Saint John Harbour.  At present New 
Brunswick Power officials are having the turbines analyzed to 
determine if they can still be used and what effect there might 
be on the project's anticipated September 30, 2009 completion 
date. 
 
--Second Reactor at Point Lepreau:  No new developments 
 
--Tidal Power (Nova Scotia):  Postponed with no definite start 
up date 
 
Nova Scotia government officials acknowledged on December 8 that 
their most recent analysis of the costs of harnessing the Bay of 
Fundy tides to produce commercial quantities of electricity may 
be so high that the proposal would need a large influx of 
taxpayer money to proceed.  Furthermore, the company chosen to 
build a tidal energy test facility has run into technical 
problems with the project and may require financial assistance.
