SUBJECT: SEVEN STOWAWAYS APPREHENDED IN HALIFAX 
 
¶1. (SBU) Enforcement officers with the Canadian Border Services 
Agency (CBSA) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) took 
seven male stowaways into custody in Halifax on the afternoon of 
April 23.  All seven were onboard the Swedish-registered 
container ship "ATLANTIC CONCERT," which arrived in port that 
afternoon.  The ship is operated by Sweden's Atlantic Container 
Line. Although all the stowaways initially claimed to be seeking 
refugee status in Canada, the RCMP told post that only one 
intends to make a formal claim.  According to CBSA, the 
remaining six stowaways will now be subject to deportation 
proceedings. All seven remain in custody. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Canadian investigators are continuing efforts to verify 
the identities and nationalities of the stowaways, five of whom 
reportedly claimed to be Moroccan and two Algerian. Canadian 
officials are trying to learn where the men boarded the ship 
(which called in Antwerp before sailing for Halifax) and whether 
Canada or the United States was their intended final 
destination, since the onward port for the vessel was New York. 
Our contacts expect to uncover more details as their 
investigation progresses and will update post as appropriate. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: While the number of stowaways intercepted in 
Canada is down considerably from the 1993 peak of 422, the issue 
has not disappeared completely, as made evident by this latest 
episode. Furthermore, although these seven stowaways were 
apprehended onboard the vessel when it arrived at port, last 
year six stowaways managed to debark at another container 
terminal in Halifax and evade port security before being caught 
inland as they sought to make their way to Montreal. Whether 
yesterday's interception of the stowaways aboard the Swedish 
container ship is the result of better intelligence and tighter 
port security, or better luck, remains an open question for now. 
END COMMENT.
