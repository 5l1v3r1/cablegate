¶1. (U) A Virgin Atlantic A-340, was en-route from Heathrow 
Airport in London to JFK International in New York when the 
airplane started broadcasting an internationally recognized 
hijacking alert code. Canadian CF-18 fighter jets were scrambled 
from Bagotville in Quebec and escorted the plane in to the 
International Airport in Halifax. 
¶2.  All instructions and directions given by the F-18's were 
complied with by the Virgin Atlantic pilot. 
¶3.  Upon touchdown in Halifax, the plane was diverted to the far 
end of the airport and surrounded by airport security personnel 
and Royal Canadian Mounted Police sent to the airport in 
response to the situation. 
¶4.  The pilot was in communication with the chief operating 
officer of the airport, Peter Clarke, as well as with RCMP 
officers on the ground. Air Canada moved in air steps and the 
pilot was instructed to exit the plane. 
¶5.  After a brief conversation with personnel on the ground, the 
RCMP and the pilot reboarded the plane to observe the 
malfunctioning alarm. 
¶6.  At approximately 1:45 p.m., Mr. Clarke informed TDY Consul 
that the RCMP was satisfied that the alarm had indeed 
malfunctioned and stated that Air Canada maintenance crews were 
on board attempting to fix the alarm. 
¶7.  Mr. Clarke reported that the plane had a total of 272 
passengers and 17 crew members on board. A manifest with 
nationalities was not available. No passengers were taken off 
the plane. 
¶8.  After reports from the airport that the USG was not going to 
allow the plane to travel into United States air space, we were 
informed at approximately 4:10 this afternoon that the plane had 
taken off and was headed for New York.
