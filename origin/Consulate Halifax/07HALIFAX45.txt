ELECTION 
 
REF: HALIFAX 0025 
 
¶1. SUMMARY:  In a surprisingly easy win, PEI Liberals ended 11 
years of Tory rule in the May 28 provincial election.  Robert 
Ghiz and the Liberals took 23 of the province's 27 districts, 
leaving the once mighty Tories with the remaining four.  The New 
Democratic Party and the Green party again failed to elect a 
member.  Ghiz and his Liberals will take power on June 13. Post 
does not foresee the new government changing any policies that 
could affect relations with the United States.  Ghiz will now 
take over from Binns as this year's host of the annual 
Conference of New England Governors and Eastern Canadian 
Premiers scheduled for June 25-26 in PEI. END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  Prince Edward Island Liberals, under leader Robert Ghiz, 
crushed the incumbent Tory Government of Premier Pat Binns in 
the May 28 provincial election.  Ghiz, the 33-year old son of a 
popular former premier, took the public and his opponents by 
surprise in capturing 23 of the Legislature's 27 seats.  The 
Tories, now the official opposition, were left with just four 
and the NDP and Green parties again were not able to elect a 
member.  The results exactly reversed the PC and Liberal 
standings in the Legislature before Binns called the election on 
April 30.  Although Binns retained his own seat, the election 
results were a crushing personal defeat for Binns who had been 
seeking an unprecedented fourth mandate. 
 
¶3.  Throughout the campaign our Island contacts had predicted 
that the electorate was in the mood for a change, but even Ghiz 
himself acknowledged that the margin of victory was more than he 
and his party had anticipated.  Added to this was the perception 
that the Tories were getting desperate and had resorted to 
making expensive and ill-conceived spending announcements with 
no explanation of how to pay for them.  Just what Binns did and 
did not do on the campaign trail will certainly be the main 
topic of post-electoral discussion across the Island in the 
weeks and months ahead, especially the question of whether Binns 
will be staying on to lead his party from the Opposition 
benches. For now the focus is on Premier-Elect Ghiz as he puts 
together his transition team for his swearing in as premier on 
June 13. Given that the Liberal platform also contained some 
expensive promises, a review of the province's fiscal situation 
will no doubt be the first order of business.  Ghiz will have an 
early, high-visibility opportunity to shine when he hosts the 
annual Conference of New England Governors and Eastern Canadian 
Premiers scheduled for June 25-26 in PEI. (Comment: As post 
reported reftel, Ghiz and Binns share much of the same political 
philosophies and we do not expect to see Ghiz make any 
significant changes in PEI policy that could affect relations 
with the United States.  End comment)
