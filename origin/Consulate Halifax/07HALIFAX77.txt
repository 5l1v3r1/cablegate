SUBJECT: NEWFOUNDLAND-LABRADOR PROVINCIAL ELECTION NOW UNDERWAY 
 
 
¶1. Tory Premier Danny Williams of Newfoundland-Labrador has gone 
through the formality of calling a provincial election for 
October 9.  The Premier called on Lt. Governor Ed Roberts on 
September 17 to ask him to dissolve the Legislature and make way 
for what will be the province's first fixed-date election. 
Williams and his Tory party have ruled Newfoundland-Labrador 
since October 2003 after he defeated the incumbent Liberal 
government, a contest which left Williams with a comfortable 
majority.  Standings in the 48-seat house at time of dissolution 
show the Tories with 34 seats, the Liberals with 11, the NDP 
with one. Two seats are vacant.  Williams will be going up 
against two rookie opponents, Liberal Leader Gerry Reid and the 
NDP's Lorraine Michael, both of whom took over their respective 
parties this past year. 
 
¶2.  Premier Williams has enjoyed historically high support since 
taking office. The latest public opinion polls show that over 
three quarters of decided voters say they would back the Premier 
in the election.  Those results have prompted election-watchers 
to use phrases such as landslide, sweep and decimation of the 
opposition forces in their predictions of the likely outcome of 
the election. Still, the Premier has warned his candidates and 
party workers not to take anything for granted. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  Consul General and Political Specialist will be in 
Newfoundland-Labrador September 18-20 and will provide further 
analysis upon their return. End Comment.
