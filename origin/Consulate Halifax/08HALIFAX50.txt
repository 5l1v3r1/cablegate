SUBJECT: TRIAL DATE SET FOR SEA SHEPHERD SEAL HUNT PROTESTORS 
 
REF: A. HALIFAX 0025 (NOTAL); B. HALIFAX 0031 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. SUMMARY:  Two officers of a Dutch-registered vessel, owned 
and operated by the U.S.-based Sea Shepherd Conservation 
Society, will be back in Canada in April 2009 to face trial over 
their involvement in a marine protest against Canada's east 
coast seal hunt.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  Court officials in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada have set 
April 27, 2009 as the trial date for the captain and the first 
officer of the anti-sealing ship the "Farley Mowat" (REFTEL). 
On July 2 the two officers, Captain Alex Cornelissen of the 
Netherlands and First Officer Peter Hammarstedt, a dual 
Swedish-American citizen, pleaded not guilty to charges of 
violating Canada's marine mammal regulations by coming too close 
to the seal hunt.  The two officers are currently free on bail 
(presumably in the Netherlands and Sweden) and made their pleas 
through their Canadian lawyer. 
 
¶3. Canada's annual east coast seal hunt started on March 20 and 
was accompanied by the usual international protests.  At the 
forefront was Paul Watson, the controversial founder and head of 
the U.S.-based Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which owns the 
"Farley Mowat."  (Watson was not onboard the vessel for this 
year's protests having stayed behind in the United States.) 
After a three-week game of cat and mouse between Canadian 
enforcement personnel and the crew of the vessel, Canadian 
authorities eventually determined they had evidence of alleged 
seal hunt infractions.  On April 12 they subsequently seized the 
vessel and detained the crew.  The crew members were later 
released without charges except for the captain and the first 
officer who will answer to the seal hunt violations.  The ship 
remains dockside in Sydney pending the outcome of a separate 
dispute between the Sea Shepherd Society and Canadian 
authorities over payment of a release bond.

Hammarstedt's arrest case in REF B.
