SUBJECT: New Brunswick and Quebec Agree to Significant Modifications 
of Utility MOU 
 
REF: A. HALIFAX 0004 AND PREVIOUS; B. 09 OTTAWA 0828 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  New Brunswick will retain control of its transmission 
system under a new, renegotiated energy agreement with Quebec, but 
with reduced cash to apply to its power utility's debt.  The 
changes were prompted by bitter opposition to the original MOU but 
there is also speculation that a plan to build a new transmission 
system to the United States was also a factor.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
 
¶2.  On January 20, the governments of New Brunswick and Quebec 
announced the details of a revised agreement on selling assets of 
New Brunswick Power to Hydro Quebec (reftels).  New Brunswick 
Premier Shawn Graham and Quebec Premier Jean Charest signed the 
original Memorandum of Understanding in October 2009, which would 
have seen Hydro Quebec assume the major assets of New Brunswick 
Power including its transmission lines for $(Can.)4.75 billion, the 
sum of NB Power's debt.  However, in the new $(Can.) 3.2 billion 
deal, New Brunswick will still be selling the bulk of its 
generation capacity to HQ while keeping control of its transmission 
and distribution operations.  Details of the revised agreement are 
available online:

¶3.  New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham was forced to negotiate the 
amendments with his Quebec counterpart after fierce opposition to 
the deal caused a damaging split in his cabinet and caucus. 
Premier Danny Williams of Newfoundland-Labrador, joined by Nova 
Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter, had also been a staunch opponent of 
the original agreement, believing that it would give Quebec control 
over transmission routes into the Northeast U.S., thereby 
jeopardizing future energy projects in Atlantic Canada.  There is 
also speculation that a plan by New Brunswick-based Fort Reliance 
(in partnership with private and public sector players) to build an 
alternate regional power corridor into Maine put pressure on the 
negotiators to close on the deal. 
 
 
 
¶4.  Comment:  With both premiers sticking to the original March 31 
deadline to sign the final deal, action now moves to the two 
provincial legislatures for ratification.  However, NB Premier 
Graham is likely to wait for an independent panel, now shifting its 
focus to study the new agreement, to present its work before 
tabling approval legislation.  Given that the new MOU has satisfied 
most of Graham's critics (particularly those within his own party), 
there appears to be little to stop the deal from getting the green 
light in New Brunswick.  END COMMENT
