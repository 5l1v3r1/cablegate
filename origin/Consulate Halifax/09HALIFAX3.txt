SUBJECT: NEW NOVA SCOTIA ENERGY MINISTER HANDLING GEORGES BANK 
DRILLING ISSUE 
 
REF: 08 HALIFAX 0073 
 
¶1. SUMMARY:  The Hon. Barry Barnet is the new energy minister 
for Nova Scotia following a provincial cabinet shuffle.  Barnet 
now inherits the Georges Bank drilling file - an issue with 
significant political overtones.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The province of Nova Scotia has a new energy minister, the 
Hon. Barry Barnet, a 10-year veteran of the provincial 
legislature.  Nova Scotia Premier Rodney MacDonald transferred 
Barnet from his previous health promotion portfolio in a January 
7 cabinet shuffle. (Barnet replaces former provincial energy 
minister Richard Hurlburt, who is now the province's new 
services minister.)  Barnet's move to energy comes at a time 
when the province is preparing to make a decision on whether to 
support offshore oil and gas drilling on Georges Bank or to 
continue with a drilling moratorium. 
 
¶3.  As reported reftel, the Bank is a lucrative offshore area 
located 100 miles off Cape Cod in the Gulf of Maine and is 
shared by the United States and Canada.  In addition to 
exploitable fish stocks, the area also contains an estimated one 
billion barrels of oil and 5.3 trillion cubic feet of natural 
gas. Because of anti-drilling sentiment from U.S. and Canadian 
environmentalists and fishing interests, both countries have had 
drilling moratoria on their respective sides since 1988. 
Canada's current moratorium will expire in 2012 and the debate 
has already started on how to deal with the issue. 
 
¶3.  The current GoNS policy is to support research on the pluses 
and minuses of drilling.  To that end, the province has provided 
funding to a group examining the socio-economic aspects of 
drilling and is funding a scientific review of the environmental 
consequences.  While the conclusions of these two studies will 
be non-binding on the provincial government, they will help 
policy-makers in deciding on one of three options:  let the 
moratorium expire, enact another moratorium, or request a public 
review panel to make a recommendation on how to proceed. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  Given that political watchers are predicting a 
provincial election in Nova Scotia sometime this year we can 
expect to see Minister Barnet steer away from this contentious 
issue and just allow the research to go on quietly behind the 
scenes.  After all, the moratorium legislation sets June 2010 as 
the deadline for the province to chose what it wants to do.  By 
then, the election probably will have been long wrapped up and 
the political consequences of each option easier to determine. 
END COMMENT
