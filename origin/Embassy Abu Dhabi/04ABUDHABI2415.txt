¶1. Poloff discussed reftel talking points with MFA 
International Organizations Deputy Director Ghanim Al 
Mazroai on July 19.  Al Mazroai said he would relay the 
U.S. position to the UAE/UN PermRep in New York.  The UAE 
PermRep is consulting with decisionmakers in Abu Dhabi and 
UN representatives from other Arab nations, and they will 
likely vote as a bloc.  The Arab group will decide how they 
will vote the evening of July 19, he said. 
 
¶2. Poloff stressed the political and redundant nature of 
the resolution, and requested a NO vote from the UAE, along 
with UAE encouragement of NO votes from other Arab 
countries.  Al Mazroai said he would relay this to 
decisionmakers in Abu Dhabi and in New York. 
 
¶3. Post recommends that USUN coordinate with the UAE/UN 
PermRep in New York as soon as possible to influence the 
voting decision of this bloc.
