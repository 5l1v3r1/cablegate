¶1.  (SBU) Noting the UAE had only "sketchy" information on the June 
23 pledging conference to address reconstruction needs of Lebanon's 
Narh al-Barid refugee camp (reftel), Assistant Under Secretary for 
Political Affairs Tariq al-Haidan told the Charge June 5 that UAE 
policy would continue to focus on helping Lebanon.  Commenting that 
the UAE has contributed much to Lebanon, Al-Haidan appreciated 
clarification of the goals of the Vienna conference and emphasized 
the importance of Lebanon taking advantage of the current opportunity 
to rebuild and stabilize the political situation.  He hoped that PM 
Siniora would have a government formed before the conference but was 
unsure whether such progress was likely.  Charge noted that a 
significant USG pledge would be announced at the conference. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA has yet to determine who might represent the UAE at the 
June 23 conference.
