¶1. Ambassador spoke with MFA U/S Adullah Rashid Al-Noaimi on 
November 23 about the Tokyo meeting.  She thanked Al-Noaimi 
for hosting the February conference and requested that the 
UAEG consider pledging to the International Reconstruction 
Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI).  Al-Noaimi took the 
information on board, mentioned that the UAE Ambassador in 
Tokyo had briefed him about the meeting, and stressed the 
bilateral assistance that the UAE provides Iraq.  We will 
continue to follow-up on this issue with UAEG.
