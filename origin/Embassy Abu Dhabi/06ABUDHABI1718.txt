SUBJECT: UAE CONDEMNS DAHAB BOMBING 
 
 ¶1. (U) UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan has 
sent a cable of condolence to Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak condemning the bomb attack in Dahab on April 24.  The 
state news agency, WAM, reported that in his cable President 
Khalifa reiterated the UAE's solidarity with Egypt in 
confronting "the evil terrorist attackers," calling the 
terrorist acts "criminal" and "contrary to all faiths and 
sound human behavior."  Sheikh Khalifa noted that the acts 
were "aimed at wreaking havoc and destruction, and 
undermining security and stability." 
 
¶2. (U) Arabic and English language dailies Al-Ittihad and 
Gulf News reported that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid 
al-Maktoum, Vice-President, Prime Minister, and ruler of 
Dubai, and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi 
Crown Prince, sent similar cables of condolence and 
condemnation.  Al-Ittihad reported that Foreign Minister 
Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan expressed the UAE's "full 
solidarity" with Egypt and promised the UAE's "full support 
for Cairo in their effort to get rid of the criminal and 
terrorist elements which arbitrarily kill innocent people." 
Sheikh Abdullah called on all Arab and Islamic countries to 
join and cooperate in eliminating "this evil party." 
 
¶3. (U) Comment: The public statements made by the UAE 
leadership mirror prior sentiments expressed over terrorist 
attacks in Egypt and Iraq, and echo sentiments previously 
delivered in prescribed Friday sermons that described 
terrorism as "acts of evil" and perpetrators of terrorist 
acts as "evil people."  End Comment.
