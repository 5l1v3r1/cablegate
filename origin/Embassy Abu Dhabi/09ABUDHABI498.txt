SUBJECT: UAE PLANS TO JOIN GICNT PLENARY 
 
REF: STATE 35549 
 
 
¶1.  Unable to secure an appointment for a troika demarche earlier, 
Post previously passed reftel agenda to MFA in coordination with the 
Dutch and Russian embassies, and encouraged UAE participation in the 
June 16-17 GICNT plenary in The Hague.  When a troika meeting was 
arranged on May 18, MFA Assistant Under secretary for Legal Affairs 
Dr. Abdulrahim al-Awadi met with the Dutch Ambassador, the Russian 
Charge, and Pol Chief to review UAE interest in the GICNT meetings. 
 
¶2.  Al-Awadi noted prior UAEG participation in GICNT and said it 
would organize a delegation appropriate to the topics on the agenda. 
Responding to the Dutch Ambassador's request that the UAEG consider 
addressing one of the topics on the afternoon of June 16 (terrorist 
safe havens or terror finance), he said the UAEG would reply later 
but would in principle be happy to address "either or both."
