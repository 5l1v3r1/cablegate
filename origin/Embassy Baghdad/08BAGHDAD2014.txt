¶1. (SBU) Coordinator for the Economic Transition in Iraq 
Ambassador Charles Ries delivered reftel demarche to Iraqi 
Minister of Trade Abdul Falah al-Sudani on June 26. 
Ambassador Ries encouraged the GOI to pursue a "low and flat" 
tariff strategy and highlighted how such a structure would 
enhance growth, transparency, and competitiveness in Iraqi 
industries. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al-Sudani described the U.S. approach as practical 
and said he strongly supports the concept of low tariffs, 
citing the success of similar approaches in Vietnam, Turkey, 
and Chile.  However, al-Sudani believes it will be a great 
challenge to convince the Council of Ministers and the 
Ministry of Finance, who he said will have greatest influence 
on the GOI's final decision, of the merits of low tariffs and 
a simplified structure.  He added that we will need to work 
together to alter the mindset of those who look to tariffs as 
the first option to protect and promote Iraqi industry. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Al-Sudani noted that the draft tariff legislation is 
currently under deliberation in the Shura Council, and that 
while it enjoys "priority" precedence, it could take up to 6 
- 8 months before it is sent on to the Council of Ministers 
for review.  Ambassador Ries stressed the importance of the 
legislation's timely passage, and al-Sudani said he would 
"push" for a quicker turn-around. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post will continue to engage key GOI officials 
regarding the merits of a simplified tariff structure and WTO 
accession issues more generally.
