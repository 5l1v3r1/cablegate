SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: U.S. WEAPON RELEASE TO IRAQ 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see para 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Country Team requests the release of 
AN/PVS-7 (Gen 3, 1250 FOM) Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) and 
AN/PEQ-2 Target Pointer Illuminating Aiming Lights (TIAPL) to 
the Government of Iraq.  The system will be used by the 
Ministry of Interior's Emergency Response Unit to advance 
nighttime operational effectiveness while reducing collateral 
damage risk.  The ERU currently uses the AT Viper NVG a 
commercial, off the shelf system that is not designed for 
driving or conducting tactical security. The USG will fund 
this estimated $800,000 acquisition through a Foreign 
Military Sales case.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Description of Technology for Release 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) AN/PVS-7 (Gen 3, 1250 FOM) Night Vision Goggles and 
AN/PEQ-2 Target Pointer Illuminating Aiming Lights (TIAPL) 
provide high quality image clarity for nighttime operations. 
They allow the wearer to select and clearly identify the 
enemy and reduces the possibility of collateral damage. 
 
Rationale for Technology Release 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Iraqi Ministry of Interior's Emergency Response 
Unit, comprised of 774 forces, is in urgent need of a viable 
night vision capability that will allow them to operate at 
night without dependence on U.S. advisors and equipment. 
Release of AN-PVS-7 Night Vision Goggles and AN/PEQ-2 Aiming 
Lights will greatly enhance their ability to conduct 
counter-terrorism missions, improve interoperability with 
Coalition forces, and improve their ability to maintain their 
own defense and security. Fielding a modern capable NVG that 
improves night vision capability will also allow the 
Coalition advisors to transition the ERU to independent 
operations. 
 
Iraq Safeguarding Sensitive Technology 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Iraq has demonstrated the intent and ability to 
protect sensitive, classified military technology since 
working with U.S. and Coalition forces.  An Article 505 
agreement (signed by the GOI July 24, 2004) demonstrates 
Iraq's commitment to protect grant defense articles and 
technology similar to our standards.  Additionally, a 
Memorandum of Agreement for Compliance for the Storage, 
Security and Inventory of Night Vision Devices was signed by 
the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, 22 November 2006.  We will 
continue to mentor the GOI on their protection of sensitive 
USG technology in order to provide long-term cooperation with 
Iraq.  We also will obtain all necessary formal agreements 
with the GOI before transferring any sensitive equipment or 
technology.  Lastly, we will continue to carry out a robust 
end-use monitoring (EUM) through the GOLDEN SENTRY program. 
 
Anticipated Reaction from Neighboring Nations 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) We do not anticipate the release of AN/PVS-7 (Gen 3, 
1250 FOM) Night Vision Goggles and AN/PEQ-2 Target Pointer 
Illuminating Aiming Lights (TIAPL) to the Government of Iraq 
to adversely affect the regional balance of power or cause 
negative reactions from neighboring nations, as this system 
is already fielded in many countries of the region. 
 
Iraq's Political Importance to the Region 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) A stable, democratically-elected Iraqi government, 
capable of protecting its people and sovereignty, and 
remaining at peace with its neighbors is one of the USG's 
highest priorities.  The release and employment of AN/PVS-7 
(Gen 3, 1250 FOM) Night Vision Goggles and AN/PEQ-2 Target 
Pointer Illuminating Aiming Lights (TIAPL) will facilitate 
progress toward this goal, advancing the Iraqi security 
forces' ability to identify, target and carry out night 
operations against anti-Iraqi forces while reducing the risk 
to self and others. 
 
Source of Financing and Economic Impact 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) This purchase will be financed by the USG using 
Iraqi Security Forces Funds.  The cost is estimated at 
$800,000. There is no significant economic impact anticipated 
 
BAGHDAD 00001731  002 OF 002 
 
 
to be generated by this sale. 
 
Relevant Human Rights Considerations 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) There are no human rights considerations that should 
preclude the release of the defense equipment to the Iraqi 
Ministry of Interior. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) We request Washington approval for the release of 
the AN/PVS-7 (Gen 3, 1250 FOM) Night Vision Goggles and 
AN/PEQ-2 Target Pointer Illuminating Aiming Lights (TIAPL) to 
the Government of Iraq.
