The following is the text of a condolence letter for Vice

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden 
The Vice President of the United States 
Washington, DC 
 
Dear Vice President Biden, 
 
It is with deep regret that I learned of the death of your 
mother, Mrs. Catherine Biden.  May God rest her soul in peace 
and give you and your family the strength to grieve her loss. 
She will always be remembered for her contributions to your 
political career as well as your personal life.  As we say in 
Koran, "We are from God and to Him we return". (Enaa Lil Lah 
wa enaaa elayhee rageoon). 
 
With our deepest sympathy, 
 
Adil Abd al-Mahdi 
Vice President of Iraq 
10-Jan-2010
