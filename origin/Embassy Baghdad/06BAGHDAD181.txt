¶1. (U) This is an action request; please see para 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: Korean 
Ambassador to Iraq Ki-ho Chang told the Ambassador 
January 19 that Seoul is interested in participating 
in, and possibly leading, the planned Kurdistan 
Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT).  Chang asked 
that the USG formally request Korean participation 
in the RRT by letter.  Post is following up with a 
proposed text for transmission via Embassy Seoul. 
We kindly request that the Department ask Embassy 
Seoul to approach the ROK Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs directly on this issue to stress the value 
that ROK participation in the RRT would have for our 
common effort in Iraq.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION 
REQUEST. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a January 19 meeting with the Ambassador 
and Strategic Governance and Economic Effects 
Director Speckhard, Chang reaffirmed the ROK 
commitment to Iraq and expressed his government's 
interest in participating in the planned Erbil-based 
Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT), which would also 
cover the provinces of Dahuk and Sulamaniyah.  Chang 
highlighted that no decision had been made in Seoul 
on participation in the RRT Erbil.  Although he is 
personally supportive of ROK participation, Chang 
said, a formal decision and authorization from Seoul 
would be required prior to any further commitment. 
He suggested that the USG, as a way of prompting a 
decision, send a letter to his government requesting 
its participation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) During follow-on discussion with Director 
Speckhard, Chang sought information regarding other 
Coalition participation in Provincial Reconstruction 
Teams (PRTs)/RRTs, especially that of the United 
Kingdom.  While remaining non-committal, Chang asked 
questions related to potential roles for the ROK to 
include leadership of the PRT and provision of 
movement security teams.  Additionally, he asked 
about the availability of funds both for the 
operation of the RRT and for reconstruction and 
development projects.
