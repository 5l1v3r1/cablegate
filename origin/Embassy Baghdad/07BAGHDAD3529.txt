committee meeting, Iraq Transition Assistance Office (ITAO) 
Director, Mark Tokola, met with Dr. Ahmed Chalabi on Monday, October 
¶22. The recently named chairman to Mailiki's new services committee

involvement and support.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
Maliki Announces New Committee 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. At the Iraq Executive Steering Committee (I-ESC) on Friday, 
October 19, Prime Minister Nouri AL Maliki announced a new chairman 
of essential services committee.  After several proposed 
alternatives, including the Council of Ministers and the Provincial 
Council, the PM declared Ahmed Chalabi, the current Head of the 
I-ESC Popular Mobilization Committee, as lead for this committee.

Chalabi Heads New Services Committee 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. Dr. Chalabi convened the first meeting of the committee Saturday, 
October 20.  The meeting was attended by General Aboud; Dr. Karim, 
Minister of Electricity; the manager of the Doura Refinery; the head 
of the Iraqi Republic Railway (IRR); a representative from the 
Baghdad Amanat; a representative from the Ministry of Oil; and Mr. 
Tacim, the Fard al-Qanoon spokesperson. 
 
¶4. Chalabi identified the proposed scope of the committee as five 
services: water, electricity, oil, health and the public 
distribution system (PDS).  The efforts would be geographically 
limited only to Baghdad.  However, in a follow up meeting between 
Director Tokola and Chalabi on October 22, Chalabi also suggested an 
added emphasis on economic development through private sector 
incentives, including an improved mortgage market to promote housing 
construction and thus reduce unemployment. 
 
¶5. During the latter meeting, Chalabi underscored the importance of 
fuel and health as sectors requiring immediate attention and 
assistance.  He specifically identified production shortages, 
transportation failures, and administrative corruption as obstacles 
within the fuel sector.  In terms of the health system, Chalabi 
noted an immediate need for operating hospitals as well as 
recruitment and retention programs for hospital personnel.  He was 
particularly interested in how to draw back doctors who have fled 
Iraq. 
 
----------------------- 
Executive Order Pending 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. The authority, membership and charge of the new services 
committee remains uncertain.  According to Chalabi, the executive 
order is before the Prime Minister.  (NOTE: Embassy staff is 
currently working to obtain a draft copy of the order. END NOTE) In 
the meantime, the next meeting is proposed later this week and 
Embassy and Coalition Force representatives are scheduled to 
attend.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. Identification of Chalabi as head of the services committee came 
as a surprise to USEMB representatives at the I-ESC.  With few 
available details regarding the committee, USEMB is actively engaged 
with Chalabi and has offered assistance as appropriate, including at 
the working levels.  It is our goal to prevent redundancy by 
utilizing existing resources, including the JPC and former Deputy 
Prime Minister Zobai's staff. Zobai had been the Chairman of the 
I-ESC's Services Committee. Chalabi's appointment primarily serves 
to fill the gap created by Zobai's resignation and the lack of a new 
Deputy Prime Minister to replace him.
