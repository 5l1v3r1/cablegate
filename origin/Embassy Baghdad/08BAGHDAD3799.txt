¶1.  (SBU) Substantial general, at times locally very heavy, rain 
arrived 29 November, providing much needed moisture for rain-fed 
wheat and barley production in the 2009/10 crop year.  Based on 
accumulated rainfall data from the Ministry of Agriculture, this 
event provided ample moisture for seeding and germination of dry 
land wheat and barley production from Ninawa Province in the north 
through the central provinces of Iraq.  MoA is extremely pleased and 
relieved with the arrival of rain, especially following the severe 
drought experienced in Iraq for the 2008/2009 crop.  MoA reported 
rainfall totals are listed in paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) FAS/Baghdad preliminary analysis indicates this rainfall 
is sufficient to maintain a forecast of normal wheat and barley 
production, 2.0 and 1.0 million metric tons respectively, for the 
2009/10 marketing year as of this date.  Additional rainfall for the 
rain fed grain areas will still be required to bring this forecast 
to reality. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Rice production remains a question of how much irrigation 
water will be allocated for the crop.  A decision by the Ministry of 
Water Resources (MoWR) has yet to be publicized. However, Iraqi 
reservoir levels are reported to be below those of the previous crop 
season, when MoWR restricted the application of irrigation water for 
rice production.  Local analysts expect MoWR to again restrict water 
availability for rice irrigation based on reported reservoir 
levels. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) officials, 
rainfall accumulations were recorded as follows:
