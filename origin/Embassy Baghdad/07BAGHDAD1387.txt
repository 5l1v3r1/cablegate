SUBJECT: COMMENTS ON POTENTIAL OPIC SUPPORT FOR BALTIMORE 
DREDGES CONTRACT WITH THE MINISTRY OF WATER RESOURCES 
 
REF: STATE 46262 
 
¶1.  Post has no information to report on the Iraq Ministry of 
Water Resources (MoWR) that would prevent OPIC support.  The 
MoWR is a national level agency within the Government of Iraq 
responsible for management of Iraq's ground and surface 
waters.  The Ministry's annual capital investment budget 
ranges from $200 million to $300 million and is used to fund 
a wide variety of construction projects as well as procure 
equipment and materials to support the Ministry's operation 
of water resources infrastructure.  As part of its overall 
capital investment program, the Ministry has procured 
dredgers from US-based contractors in the past.  Post has no 
evidence or knowledge that would lead us to believe the 
Ministry would wrongfully call the performance bond.  In 
addition, Post has no evidence or knowledge that the Ministry 
has any ties to terrorism, money laundering, corruption or 
other violations of domestic law. 
 
¶2.  Post has no information about the Iraq Development 
Corporation.
