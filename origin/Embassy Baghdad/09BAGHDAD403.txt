SUBJECT: UN REVIEW OF IRAQ SCIENCE AND TECHNOLGY OFF TO A 
SLOW START 
 
REF: 08 BAGHDAD 2769 
 
¶1. (SBU) Minister of Science and Technology (MoST) Ra'id 
Fahmi Jahid told a visiting group of Civilian Research and 
Development Foundation (CRDF) representatives on February 11 
that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's 
(UNCTAD) science, technology, and innovation policies (STIP) 
review of Iraq is "experiencing some delays."  MoST signed a 
memorandum of understanding with UNCTAD over 5 months ago to 
undertake the STIP review (reftel).  Deputy Minister Samir 
Attar, MoST's lead official for the STIP review, said they 
expect an official start "perhaps within a couple months," 
and expects UNCTAD to take 12-18 months after the start of 
the review before issuing their final STIP report.  (Comment: 
 Embassy will continue to encourage the GOI to complete the 
STIP review, but given the likelihood of results not being 
released for almost two years, we will not delay cooperative 
programs in science and technology in anticipation of the 
review's recommendations.  End comment.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) When asked, Minister Fahmi immediately offered that 
he did not have any preconceived notions about what MoST or 
the GOI would do in response to the report.  "The most 
important result of this process will be the collective 
understanding we gain from working with the other ministries 
as we assess our resources, needs, and national goals."  The 
GOI is preparing for the STIP review, he said, by studying 
STIP reviews of other countries completed by the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development, UNCTAD, the World 
Bank, and the UN Education, Science, and Culture Organization 
(UNESCO).  The GOI Council of Ministers established a 
National STIP Review Committee in September, 2008, headed by 
MoST and including representatives of 16 GOI entities, 
including 12 ministries (Science and Technology, Water 
Resources, Industry, Higher Education, Oil, Agriculture, 
Communications, Environment, Planning, Trade, Transportation, 
and Foreign Affairs), the KRG, and the Prime Minister's 
Office.
