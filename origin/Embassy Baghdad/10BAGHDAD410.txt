¶1. (SBU) Summary and Comment:  Wasit,s Provincial Council 
(PC) passed a unanimous resolution on February 10 to dismiss 
former Ba,athists from provincial and national ministry 
government jobs unless they publicly renounce their former 
affiliation.  It is unclear if the resolution is 
constitutional or how it might actually be enforced. 
Significantly, even secular and moderate PC members appear to 
have supported the measure.   Deputy PC Chairman Majid Ali 
Jabber (Da,wa) complained to PRToffs about former Ba,ath 
members re-entering government service, and questioned the 
U.S. role in supporting Ba,athists in the current 
deliberation over CoR candidate disqualifications.  PRT Team 
Leader clarified that the United States strongly opposes the 
Ba,ath, and did not interfere in Iraqi political and 
judicial decisions regarding de-Ba,athification.  He 
emphasized that the Iraq citizens, including candidates, have 
a right to due process under Iraqi law, and that the Unites 
States urged that a transparent de-Ba,ath process be put 
into place. End Summary and Comment. 
 
¶2. (SBU) PRToffs met with Wasit PC Deputy Chairman Majid Ali 
Jabber (Da,wa) on Feb. 11 in al-Kut.  Jabber addressed a 
unanimous resolution which the PC had passed the previous 
day, which the local press described as &banning8 former 
Ba,athists from government jobs in Wasit.  According to 
Jabber, the resolution called for all former members of the 
Ba,ath party who worked (or sought) government jobs to 
denounce the Ba,ath and their membership therein, and to 
turn in any weapons they possessed.  The resolution applied 
to both provincial employees and employees of the provincial 
offices of national ministries.  Employees who satisfied 
these conditions could retain their jobs.  The resolution,s 
final provision called for &command or division-level8 
Ba,athists to be referred to the National-Level Committee of 
Justice and Accountability for investigation. 
¶3. (SBU) Jabber did not clarify the provision,s 
constitutionality and how (or if) it would actually be 
enforced.  In the wake of the de-Ba,athification exclusion 
order by the parliamentary Accountability and Justice 
Commission (AJC) (refs A-C), PC members may feel under 
pressure from their parties and supporters in this Shi,a 
stronghold to bolster their anti-Ba,ath bona fides with 
moves of this type.  Jabber argued that many former 
Ba-athists had re-entered government service and it was up to 
provincial authorities to take a stand against this. 
(COMMENT: PRT was struck by the apparent support for the 
measure by secular PC members, including members of the 
Iraqiyya coalition, which was disproportionately affected by 
the parliamentary AJC,s de-Ba,athification exclusion order. 
END COMMENT.) 
¶4. (SBU) The PC Deputy also remarked on anti-Ba,ath 
demonstrations in the provincial capital, al-Kut, on February 
10, and lamented that the United States appeared to support 
the reinstatement of former Ba,athist CoR candidates.  The 
PRT Team Leader corrected him, noting that despite inaccurate 
media reports, the U.S. did not support former Ba,athists 
and was not lobbying for their reinstatement as candidates. 
He emphasized U.S. support for the independence of Iraqi 
political and judicial institutions and clarified that the 
United States had not intervened to influence the AJC or the 
Cassation Chamber in any way.  The TL also noted the concern 
of the UN and the United States that whatever processes were 
put in place be as transparent and fair as possible, and that 
Qput in place be as transparent and fair as possible, and that 
progress toward reconciliation not stall.  Jabber seemed 
readily mollified and thanked the PRToffs for clarification 
of the U.S. position.
