SUBJECT: PRT TIKRIT: TRIBAL SECURITY INITIATIVES IN SALAH 
AD DIN DIFFERENT FROM ANBAR 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 2155 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Tikrit, Salah ad Din cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Since the Salah ad Din (SaD) Support Council, a 
grouping of tribal sheikhs fighting al Qaeda in the province, 
formed in mid-June (reftel), two major differences have 
emerged which distinguish the SaD efforts from the tribal 
security initiatives in al Anbar.  First, the SaD sheikhs 
have made it clear they want to work under the auspices of 
the provincial government, with the approval of the GOI, and 
in coordination with the Iraqi security forces (ISF) already 
in their areas.  They see the provincial government of Salah 
ad Din as largely functional and legitimate.  As such, they 
chose the name "support council" because they want to support 
the provincial government and ISF in security initiatives, 
rather than take the lead.  Select members of the Support 
Council have begun regular meetings with representatives from 
the Prime Minister's Office.  (NOTE: They specifically chose 
not to include "awakening" or "salvation" in the council's 
name because, in their opinion, the province is already 
"awake to secure issues" and does not need "saving."  END 
NOTE.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Second, the leadership of the Support Council said 
that their tribal security initiatives will only be local, 
with province-wide security left to the ISF.  According to 
the rules set forth by the Support Council, each tribe will 
work with the local Iraqi Police (IP) and Iraqi Army (IA) to 
secure its area, and its area alone.  Tribes, therefore, will 
not cross into to other tribes' areas to conduct 
security-related operations.

Comment 
------- 
¶4. (SBU) The provincial government hopes that keeping tribal 
security initiatives local and under the control of the ISF 
will allow for the continued long-term and sustainable 
development of the provincial government, while also allowing 
the tribes to assist the ISF in securing the province. 
Additionally, they hope the localized nature of the movement 
will prevent armed disputes among tribes.  Provincial 
leaders, both governmental and tribal, have been consistent 
in their message that they do not want to form militias and 
that they see a legitimate government as the best way forward 
for the province's long-term stability.  END COMMENT.
