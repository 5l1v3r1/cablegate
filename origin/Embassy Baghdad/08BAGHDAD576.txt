SUBJECT:  PRT DIWANIYAH HAS RELOCATED TO THE PROVINCE 
 
¶1.  On February 22, the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) 
Diwaniyah moved from REO Hillah and into temporary quarters at Camp 
Echo, a base operated by Coalition Forces.  This move will greatly 
enhance the team's effectiveness to engage more frequently with 
Iraqi counterparts, and will relieve the team from the arduous and 
challenging land and air transportation movements previously made 
from Hillah to the province.  The PRT will remain in temporary 
quarters until they move to permanent quarters that will be 
constructed at Camp Echo. 
 
¶2.  As a result of this move, the team changes status from a 
Provincial Support Team (PST) to a full-fledged PRT.  This change 
now increases the count to 12 PRTs, with only six PSTs remaining. 
There are still 13 ePRTs for a total of 31 teams in Iraq.
