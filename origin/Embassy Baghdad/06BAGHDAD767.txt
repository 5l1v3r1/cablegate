SUBJECT:  PST BAGHDAD: COUNCIL VOTES TO REPLACE 
CHAIRMAN OF SADR CITY DISTRICT 
 
 
¶1.  Sadr City District Council Chairman Hassan Husain 
Shama was replaced by Vice Chairman Jawad Kadhim Mansi 
at a regular session of the Council on March 9.  The 
vote tally favoring Jawad was 22 to 15.  Hassan served 
as chairman for the past two years, which called for 
personal courage: his predecessor had been murdered by 
the Madhi Militia and his body hung from a light pole. 
Hassan readily admitted to meeting with the Sadr 
Bureau regularly to generate a cooperative environment 
and for his own personal safety. 
 
¶2.  Jawad is less known, but has been friendly and 
cooperative with U.S representatives.  He, too, is 
known to cooperate with the Sadr Bureau.  PST Baghdad 
does not know how strong a relationship Jawad has with 
the Sadr Bureau. 
 
¶3.  During the council meeting and prior to the vote, 
Jawad promised the Council Service Committee, the 
largest and most powerful committee at this council 
and all other district councils, that he would provide 
more resources to it.  His promise may have catalyzed 
his victory. 
 
¶4.  Comment.  The ramifications of Hassan Husain's 
removal as council chairman of the Sadr City DC are 
unclear.  Hassan, a Kurd from the more affluent 
southern area of Sadr City's Sector 4, was the 
consummate politician (well-dressed, well-spoken, a 
master of wit and debate).  Jawad, a Shiite from 
central Sadr City's sector 25, has a much lower 
profile. 
 
¶5.  Comment cont'd.  The political battle in Sadr City 
may be one of legitimacy and the issue may be who's in 
charge, the Sadr Bureau or the DC?  Hassan's two year 
stint resulted in the DC's greater activity and may 
have strengthened the DC.  We hope Jawad will lead the 
DC in the same direction.  End comment.
