SUBJECT: PRT ANBAR: ANBAR HOLDS SUCCESSFUL ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER 
CONFERENCE 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: On January 27, about 30 Iraqi bankers and 
businessmen attended a conference organized by PRT Anbar on using 
electronic funds transfer (EFT) through banks for payments. 
Representatives from the USF-I Al Asad Regional Contracting Center 
described how participants could open an EFT account for U.S. 
Government contracts and avoid fraud during the process.  Dar es 
Salaam Bank -- one of the more advanced private banks operating in 
the region -- described the services they can offer businesses 
wishing to open accounts.  The U.S. Department of Defense's Task 
Force for Business Stability Operations gave a presentation on how 
their EFT Assistance Center can resolve problems with USG payments 
through EFT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
AL-ASAD REGIONAL CONTRACTING CENTER 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Representatives of the USF-I Al-Asad Regional Contracting 
Center gave participants a better understanding of how to avoid 
routine problems with EFT payments, such as incorrect routing 
numbers and differing names between the contract payee and the 
account holder.  The participating Iraqi companies also learned that 
all legitimate contract correspondence from the U.S. Military will 
end in a ".mil" email address.  In the past, fraudsters have 
impersonated U.S. military contractors by using emails ending in 
"usarmy.com" and offered fake contracts to Iraqi companies to do 
work for which they will never be paid. 
 
DAR ES SALAAM BANK 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) Ammar Al-Hatim of the private Dar es Salaam Investment Bank 
explained the process of opening an EFT-capable account to the 
participants.  He described how account holders could transfer money 
throughout the world through Dar es Salaam's partner bank, Hong-Kong 
Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).  Some of the participants were 
surprised to learn that opening an account at Dar es Salaam's branch 
in Ramadi would allow them to access their money at any Dar es 
Salaam branch in Iraq or another country.  The participants asked 
questions about the ATM options through Dar es Salaam, interest 
rates and fees, and letters of credit/letters of guarantee.  Ammar 
assured the participants that, even though his bank was private, it 
enjoyed very good relations with both the Central Bank of Iraq and 
the state-owned Trade Bank of Iraq. 
 
TFBSO EFT ASSISTANCE CENTER 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The Taskforce for Business Stability Operations (TFBSO) 
stressed how using EFT helps to reduce cash movement and therefore 
decreases the potential threat to vendors from terrorists and lowers 
the bank costs (by reducing movements of actual cash).  TFBSO 
explained how their EFT Assistance Center works to improve the Iraqi 
EFT payment infrastructure, with tools such as the Real Time Gross 
Settlement System (RTGS), Automated Clearing House (ACH), and core 
banking systems.  TFBSO also described how they work to ensure 
accuracy in data collection for the payments registration process 
and troubleshoot problems. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. (U) The immediate goal of this conference was to help USG 
contractors in Anbar better understand EFT and encourage its use. 
The conference is part of a bigger effort to promote confidence in 
the Iraqi banking system and strengthen its relationship with the 
Iraqi business community.  We will continue to use the USG's 
purchasing power in Anbar to encourage the development of modern 
banking ahead of the eventual drawdown of the U.S. provincial 
presence.
