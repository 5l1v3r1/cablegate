SUBJECT: OPIC INQUIRY RE: IMMDF LOAN PROPOSALS 
 
REF: A. STATE 223589 
     ¶B. BAGHDAD 4904 
 
¶1.  This cable is in response to reftel A re: OPIC request 
for Embassy comments on potential Iraq Middle Market 
Development Foundation (IMMDF) loan proposals. 
 
¶2.  Post IRMO/Private Sector Development was closely involved 
in the referral process for projects A (Naseer Oxygen Gas), C 
(Hilal Al Khair), F (Al-Bareeq Air Conditioning), and H 
(Tigris Holdings), and is supportive of OPIC involvement. 
For each of these projects, Post met with the applicant 
numerous times and: 
 
-- explained the loan process and parameters; 
-- discussed the details of the loan request and possible 
structures for a credit facility; 
-- asked questions to gain a comprehensive understanding of 
their business; and 
-- assisted (in most cases, directly) in the preparation of a 
detailed analysis of their business. 
 
¶3.  Post is not as familiar with the remaining projects 
listed in reftel A, though we believe investment in these 
business sectors would be beneficial for Iraqi reconstruction 
and development.  We are prepared to research these projects 
more closely, but note this will take longer than the 
mid-January timeframe by which OPIC would like Post comments. 
 Please advise.
