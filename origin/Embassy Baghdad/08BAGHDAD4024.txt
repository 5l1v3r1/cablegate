¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The International Republican Institute 
(IRI) has expanded its candidate-training program in Iraq 
to include sessions in Baghdad. IRI is providing political 
party training to 43 parties competing for seats in the 
Iraqi provincial council elections scheduled for January 
31, 2009.  In addition to party training, IRI offers 
modules for groups of individual candidates.  While the 
majority of training sessions are hosted at IRI's training 
center in Erbil, the Institute has recognized the improving 
security situation in Baghdad and begun hosting modules in 
Baghdad for the first time since early 2007.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On December 11 POLOFFS attended a multi-party 
training session co-hosted by Baghdad PRT and IRI.  This 
was the second such event; the first was held on November 
¶11.  A total of 18 candidates, representing nine political 
entities, attended the two-day seminar.  The IRI 
instructor, a US citizen with professional experience 
working on congressional and presidential campaigns, worked 
with an Iraqi interpreter to guide participants through an 
interactive lesson focusing on campaign strategies and 
techniques. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Baghdad PRT took the lead in organizing and 
hosting the training sessions, following a presentation to 
the PRT by on the upcoming provincial elections.  PRT staff 
approached the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor 
(DRL) with information that many local candidates were 
interested in participating in training sessions, and 
offered to provide a local venue for IRI to conduct 
courses.  Following a positive response from IRI, the PRT, 
in cooperation with the Embassy Political Section, 
publicized the events to all parties active within their 
area of operations. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The basic, multi-party candidate training 
module introduced candidates to generic themes and concepts 
such as targeting undecided voters and maintaining a simple 
database.  Candidates also participated in discussions on 
party platform development, constituent services, and voter 
outreach.  Candidates and parties that participated in 
these modules may apply to enroll in more focused, 
party-specific training courses at IRI's Iraq headquarters 
in Erbil. Candidates from several parties told poloffs during 
a break in the training that they found the sessions very 
useful; much of the thinking was new, they commented.  Several 
of the candidates who participated in the training have 
inquired about training opportunities for 
others in their party. (Note: We routinely pass these 
requests on to NDI and IRI.  End note.) 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  IRI and its counterpart, NDI, moved 
their Iraq headquarters from Baghdad to Erbil in 2007, 
citing security concerns.  While both institutes continue 
to provide the bulk of their party and candidate 
development training in Erbil, they have each made a 
commitment to relocate elements of their international 
staff to Baghdad in early 2009.  NDI is setting up a 
larger operation in the International Zone although 
they face space availability problems. We continue to 
encourage increased IRI and NDI programming in Baghdad. 
The two candidate-training courses offered by IRI in Baghdad 
are a sign that IRI is prepared and able to make this move.
