OFFICIALS SUCCESSFUL 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Embassy Baghdad hosted a three-day 
conference for Iraqi Government officials on the Chemical 
Weapons Convention (CWC), building knowledge and 
relationships that will help Iraq to implement the CWC after 
it accedes to the treaty.  The GOI has ratified and signed 
the CWC - the primary international arms control agreement 
prohibiting the production, stockpiling and use of chemical 
weapons and their delivery systems - and will assume 
responsibility for its implementation as soon as the Iraqi 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) submits the instruments of 
ratification to the UN and the Organization for the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The December 7-9 training brought together officials 
from the Iraqi Ministries of Science and Technology, Foreign 
Affairs, Defense, and Industry, as well as the Customs 
Authority, to learn about their roles and obligations under 
the CWC. The Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate (INMD), 
Iraq's national authority for arms control, currently resides 
under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) and 
includes a consultative council made up of representatives 
from the other ministries in attendance. Ten Iraqi officials 
participated in the training, giving up a large part of their 
Eid al-Adha holiday.  Trainers from State's ISN Bureau, 
OSD-Policy, JCS J5, Multi-National Force-Iraq Chem Bio cell, 
and the British Embassy gave presentations on the purpose and 
content of the treaty, declarations, inspections, and 
destruction of chemical weapons remnants and facilities. 
 
¶3. (SBU) GOI participants were thoroughly engaged, asking 
questions on the topics of greatest relevance to Iraq's 
circumstances and near-term challenges.  One of the most 
animated sessions covered reporting requirements for 
recovered chemical weapons.  The GOI officials expressed 
surprise at the number of chemical munitions MNF-I has 
discovered in Iraq and concern about its capacity to assume 
responsibility for destruction.  They also inquired about 
export controls and smuggling of chemical weapons, wondering 
whether this was a security or legal matter.  Trainers 
explained how various U.S. customs and border enforcement 
agencies work closely with arms control authorities. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GOI participants repeatedly expressed 
appreciation for the conference and interest in additional 
training as they build capacity to take on their 
responsibilities.  They asked about U.S. and UK lessons 
learned in standing up National Authorities.  Participants 
also requested additional training and hands-on exercises for 
the complex procedures they will need to follow.  Trainers 
discussed opportunities for seminars and internships through 
the OPCW, and will maintain contact to facilitate more 
focused training for Iraq's specific needs. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: The GOI's most immediate task is for the 
MFA to deposit Iraq's instruments of ratification with the UN 
and the OPCW. The Embassy continues to seek clarification on 
the status of this action and offer its assistance.  The GOI 
also faces the ongoing task of developing the necessary 
organizational structure and capacity within the INMD.  Once 
Iraq accedes to the CWC, its other immediate tasks will be 
declaring all covered materials and facilities, facilitating 
inspections, and assuming responsibility for destruction of 
recovered Chemical Weapons remnants.
