SUBJECT: PRT DIYALA: ENCOURAGING SIGNS IN DIYALA 
WITH PASSAGE OF BUDGET, IMPROVED SECURITY ENVIRONMENT, 
AND NEW PRT STAFFING 
 
¶1.  (U) This is a PRT Diyala reporting cable. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The Diyala Provincial Government is increasingly eager to 
engage with the PRT thanks to improving security, the onset of the 
election season, the long-delayed passage of the 2008 provincial 
budget coupled with initial execution of the 2006 and 2007 
provincial budgets, as well as a boost in PRT staffing.  The arrival 
of a number of non-DoD subject matter experts (SME) to augment the 
PRT, and most recently the arrival of RTI to conduct training for 
provincial employees and elected officials have contributed to the 
sudden surge of interest in interaction from the previously moribund 
Provincial Government. END SUMMARY. 
 
IMPROVED SECURITY AND BUDGET EXECUTION 
PROMPTING PROGRESS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) The success of recent joint US-Iraqi military operations in 
Diyala has provided the Provincial Government space to begin 
providing essential services to areas formerly controlled by Al 
Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).  GOI monies for projects at all levels are 
becoming available, and contracts, some from 2006, are being 
executed.  The recent and long delayed passage of the 2008 
provincial budget, coupled with recent GOI announcements of 
supplemental budget availability contingent on expenditure of 
current budgets, is motivating all levels of the Diyala Provincial 
Government to move more rapidly to secure and conspicuously 
distribute their piece of the fiscal pie before the election cycle 
heats up. 
 
PROVINCIAL COUNCIL INCREASES ENGAGEMENT 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Provincial Council (PC) Committee members have increased the 
pace and depth of contact of collaborative meetings with the PRT in 
an effort to jump-start stalled programs and increase the perception 
of PC member involvement.  Recent decisions affecting USG 
unwillingness to further fund capital projects, while initially 
disconcerting to Iraqi officials, have been taken in stride as 
officials are encouraged to access the funds available through the 
GOI. 
 
¶5.  (U) Members of two provincial council committees, Education and 
Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), regularly request weekly 
meetings with the PRT and transportation to attend events with local 
military units.  School re-openings and medical missions to IDP 
clusters, regardless of PC involvement with the project, are now all 
objects of intense PC interest.  The Provincial Health Committee, 
comprised of the PRT public health liaisons, the acting Director 
General (DG) of Health, and the members of the PC health committee, 
has additionally established a weekly meeting schedule to discuss 
projects and greater outreach opportunities.  Previously, the Health 
DG was very involved with policy issues but never engaged the PC 
health committee.  This increased interest in engagement comes at a 
critical time for Diyala, with the beginning of a large infusion of 
funds from the past budgets finally moving into the execution phase, 
and the GOI publicly announcing the promise of new monies almost 
daily.  Diyala residents have high expectations of provincial 
government officials, who know that they must convey the message 
that they are the driving force behind real progress in the province 
if they hope to retain their seats in upcoming elections. 
 
INCREASED PRT STAFFING BOOSTS OPERATIONS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Highly-qualified civilian SMEs who recently joined the PRT 
are a tremendous boon to the increased interaction between the PRT 
and the Provincial Government.  Engineers, city planners, business 
development experts, public health personnel, and agronomists have 
rushed to establish contact and relationships with various 
provincial council committees and are successfully energizing 
relationships with previously unengaged sectors of Diyala society. 
Although still handicapped by a chronic shortage of linguist 
support, the addition of SMEs has given a great boost to PRT 
operations. 
 
¶7.  (U) Additionally, the long awaited arrival of staff from 
Research Triangle Institute (RTI), a USAID training contractor, has 
heightened interest by Provincial Government staff, who are eagerly 
signing up for training programs to enhance their professional 
performance.  In the past, staff were only interested in training 
opportunities when they were offered outside the province.  Now, in 
recognition of improved security, Governor Ra'ad has declared that 
training will be a part of the work day and conducted within the 
province.  Staff from the Provincial Government's Contracts, Legal, 
and Finance sections are eager to begin computer training to enhance 
those offices' day-to-day operations and have signed up for a broad 
range of courses that should make help make them better overall

administrators. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8.  (U) The combination of an improved security environment and 
recent passage of the 2008 provincial budget has accelerated the 
pace of progress in Diyala.  However, there remain concerns that 
pre-election violence could jeopardize the gains made in the last 
few months. The PRT and its military colleagues continue to focus 
efforts on budget execution with non-stop follow-up in essential 
service improvements province-wide. These are the key elements to 
ensure that progress continues through the election cycle and into 
the next provincial administration.
