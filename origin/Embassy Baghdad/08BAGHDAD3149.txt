This is a PRT Karbala Reporting Cable 
 
¶1. (SBU) A QRF project to provide a number of badly needed 
English engineering books to the Provincial Engineering 
Department illustrates Iran's violation of intellectual 
property rights.  Of the 175 titles delivered by a local 
supplier to the PRT for inspection, all were counterfeits. 
Although all initially appeared to be the genuine article 
with the proper hardcover and credentials, the pages were of 
inferior photocopy-quality upon closer inspection, and in 
addition, each features a frontispiece in Farsi describing 
the contents.  The insert identifies the producer as 
"Norpardazan" of the Asfand Publications of Mashhad, Iran. 
One of the volumes titled "Engineering Mechanics: Statics" by 
J.L. Meriam and L.G. Kraige, fifth edition, published by John 
Wiley and Sons and currently retailing USD25 in the United 
States, was listed for 32,000 Iranian riyals, or 
approximately $3.60. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The supplier referred to us by the Engineering 
Department naturally disavowed knowingly providing us with a 
pirated publication while charging us the full-freight fare. 
We insisted to the Engineering Department that the PRT would 
only deal with genuine vendors, and will not pay for any of 
the 175 knockoffs.  The PRT will closely examine all the 
other books to be provided by a new vendor.  We will report 
again should any more Persian counterfeits appear.
