REF: BASRA 00088 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an REO Basra reporting cable. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Basra province remains calm after the approval of 
SOFA by the Council of Representatives (CoR) on November 27. 
Immediately after passage, the Iraqi Army 14th Division 
Commander had placed his troops on high alert pending public 
reaction to Friday prayers.  Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) have 
taken pre-emptive steps against possible SOFA-related 
violence by carrying out major security operations over the 
past month, resulting in hundreds of arrests.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The day after the SOFA was approved by the CoR, 
Iraqi Army 14th Division Commander Major General Abd al-Aziz 
al-Dalmi reported to the REO that there had been no notable 
violence in the province since the vote and that the Iraqi 
Security Forces (ISF) had the situation well under control. 
Echoing comments made by Basra Operations Commander (BOC) 
Major General Mohammad Jawad Huwaydi (reftel), Aziz stated he 
was confident that any violence would be kept to a minimum. 
Aziz dismissed the possibility of large-scale violence, 
adding that he had put all ISF on high alert and spread out 
forces all over the province following an area assessment on 
November 26. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Aziz also expressed his satisfaction with recent IP 
operations in Basra.  Commenting on media reports that ISF 
had arrested 96 insurgents on November 27, Aziz gave full 
credit to the IP, explaining that the IA was not involved in 
the operation. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Respected by both the military and Basrawis, Aziz 
is known for his active involvement at the tactical level. He 
is often praised by BOC Commander Major General Mohammad and 
can be given much of the credit for the current stability 
enjoyed in Basra today.  While future Friday prayers may 
still incite some violence, it appears that ISF in Basra are 
prepared to control it.  END COMMENT.
