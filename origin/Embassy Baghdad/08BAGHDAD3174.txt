¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 7. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: Embassy proposes a one-day conference on 
Iraq,s business and investment climate in late October/early 
November.  This is in response to DPM Salih's requests for a 
bilateral dialogue before the end of the year.  However we do 
not intend for this to be a full-blown "Dialogue on Economic 
Cooperation."  Rather we propose using a planned visit to 
Baghdad by Treasury Deputy Secretary Kimmitt, as well as a 
planned business delegation organized by the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, to focus senior GOI officials on the urgent need 
for specific steps to improve Iraq,s business and investment 
climate.  We hope for senior participation by other USG 
agencies, but because of severe constraints on embassy 
resources in October will need to limit the overall size of 
USG participation in the proposed conference.  End summary. 
 
DPM Salih Requests Conference 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Barham Salih has 
proposed to Ambassador and EMIN that a bilateral economic 
conference take place before the end of the year (refs A and 
B).  The embassy proposes that we build a one-day conference 
on investment climate around Treasury Deputy Secretary 
Kimmitt's visit in late October/early November. This would 
not/not be a formal "Dialogue on Economic Cooperation" or 
DEC.  The last DEC took place in Baghdad in February 2008 
(Ref C); we envision a large DEC in the spring with the new 
U.S. Administration.  Rather this session would focus solely 
on the business and investment climate, with the aim of 
encouraging GOI leadership to remove existing roadblocks to 
new investment and private sector development, to include 
full implementation of the 2006 Investment Law. 
 
¶4. (SBU) DPM Salih also requested a large business event 
along with the government-to-government meeting, with the 
goal of concluding agreement on a few large joint venture or 
investment deals.  We believe it is more appropriate to focus 
now on the dialogue to improve business conditions on the 
ground, with a view to achieving demonstrable regulatory 
improvements before a major business event next year. 
However, it is important to include a private sector 
component to the planned session.  We understand the U.S. 
Chamber (in coordination with TFBSO) plans to bring an 
investor group to Baghdad in October and would be willing to 
set aside some time for the group to participate in a 
roundtable discussion.  In addition to the private sector, we 
propose seeking participation of a limited number of 
representatives from other investor nations, as well as from 
the World Bank (highlighting the recent findings of the IFC 
"Doing Business" report which concluded that the business 
climate in Iraq has worsened over the past year).  On the 
Iraqi side we will suggest that participants include 
representatives from the Provincial Investment Commissions to 
offer their perspective on impediments to new investment. 
 
Proposed Participation and Next Steps 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) We have discussed the general concept outlined above 
with DPM Salih,s designated point person for this 
conference.  While the DPM,s staff remains focused on a 
high-visibility event involving senior U.S. business 
officials and publicizing some major deals with U.S. firms, 
they have tentatively agreed to the proposal for a smaller 
and more focused dialogue in late October as a first step. 
They will be discussing the proposal with DPM Salih who, 
along with the rest of the Iraqi government, is celebrating a 
Muslim holiday for the remainder of this week (the next 
working day is Oct. 6). 
 
¶6. (SBU) In addition to Treasury Deputy Secretary Kimmitt, we 
hope to see senior participation from a limited number of USG 
agencies, and specifically propose State U/S Jeffrey, 
Commerce Deputy Secretary Sullivan, DUSD Brinkley, and AUSTR 
Lilienfeld.  As previously announced (ref D), the Mission has 
a very heavy visitor burden in October, combined with the 
start of the move to the NEC.  Given the priority we attach 
to improving the investment climate, however, we want this 
conference to take place.  But we need to request very

limited participation from Washington agencies (ideally 
principals plus one). 
 
Action Request 
---------------

agencies discuss this concept, and the draft agenda that

date(s), (c) proposed participants, and (d) specific requests 
for GOI ) as host ) to consider.
