SUBJECT: NINEWA: HAJJ FLIGHT INAUGURATES MOSUL'S FIRST 
COMMERCIAL PASSENGER AIR TRAFFIC SINCE 1993 
 
This is a Ninewa Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) message. 
 
¶1. (U) In Mosul's first commercial passenger flight operation 
since 1993, Iraqi Airways Flight 020 departed Mosul Airport 
for Baghdad International Airport at 2230 December 2 with 
approximately 150 Hajj pilgrims.  A second Iraqi Airways 
flight departed Mosul Airport December 3 with approximately 
150 passengers.  More than 2,500 pilgrims are slated to fly 
out of and return through Mosul this month. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The flight of these IAW Boeing 727-200 planes 
culminated years of construction, planning, training and 
close teamwork among the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority, 
Iraqi Airways, local contractors, local and national 
politicians, the Provincial Reconstruction Team, 4/1 Brigade 
Combat Team, 1 Armored Division, 3 Armored Cavalry Regiment, 
25 Infantry Division, and Embassy Baghdad, especially the 
Iraq Reconstruction Management Office, the Office of the 
Transportation Attache and OPA.  The PRT worked closely with 
provincial authorities to identify what their priority 
projects were and, as a result of that process, allocated USD 
3.2 million for the airport terminal renovation, without 
which airport operations would not have been possible.  In 
addition, DOS spent USD 10.3 million on a new air traffic 
control tower, runway and approach lighting, and an 
instrument landing system for the airport. 
 
¶3. (U) Both initial groups of pilgrims were scheduled to 
transfer in Baghdad to an onward flight to Medina, Saudi 
Arabia.  Dedicated Iraqi officials showed great initiative in 
arranging these Iraqi Airways flights to meet the need to 
move pilgrims through Mosul.  While the Iraqi officials 
continue to utilize this temporary measure, we are also 
working as a team to complete arrangements with the GOI's 
contracted Hajj air carrier.  Chartered Hajj flights non-stop 
to Saudi Arabia, which had originally been scheduled to begin 
December 1, are expected to begin on December 5. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: Ninewa citizens have eagerly awaited the 
opening of Hajj flights from Mosul, which not only provide a 
safer, more convenient way for pilgrims to travel to Saudi 
Arabia, but also have come to symbolize Mosul,s reopening to 
the world after years of conflict and isolation. PRT will 
continue to work, together with the Office of the 
Transportation Attache and our military partners, to support 
the inauguration some time in 2008 of regularly scheduled 
commercial flights, as well as economic opportunities that 
will come with the airport's reopening.
