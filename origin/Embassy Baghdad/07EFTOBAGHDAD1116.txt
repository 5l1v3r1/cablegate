¶1.  Embassy Baghdad would like to refer Essam Hammoudi Ahmed 
to the US Refugee Admissions Program. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Biographical information: 
 
Principal applicant 
 
NAME: Essam Hammoudi Ahmed 
DOB: July 1, 1980 
POB: Iraq 
Passport Number: S 1647887 
Gender: Male 
Marital Status: Single 
 
Dependents: None 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Description of persecution claim, as reported by 
the applicant himself:  Essam started working as an 
interpreter for US and Coalition Forces (CF) in Muthanna 
Province in 2003.  He also worked in other capacities for the 
Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in positions in which 
he interacted with many members of the local community on 
behalf of the CPA, such as assistant project manager for 
CPA-funded programs.  As a result, he was seen as a close 
collaborator of Coalition Forces and the CPA.  In December of 
2006, leaflets accusing him of being a CIA agent were 
distributed in a local market in his hometown of Samawah.  In 
April of 2004 armed men searched his parents' house (where he 
lived) looking for him.  In July of 2004, a list of 
interpreters working with CF was distributed in a market, 
together with threats against them.  In May of 2006, armed 
men found him at home, put a gun to his head, and warned him 
to stop working for CF.  Also in May, an Iraqi legal advisor 
for the CPA was murdered.  In June, July and August of 2006, 
Essam received telephone calls threatening him with death 
almost daily.  He changed his phone number various times, but 
the threats continued.  In June of 2006, an interpreter 
working for the Japanese Army was shot and killed in front of 
his house in Samawah.  Police reportedly witness the murder, 
but took no action to detain the perpetrators or take the 
injured interpreter to a hospital.  In July of 2006 another 
interpreter was murdered in Muthanna, and another one in 
September of 2006.  Essam was a close friend of the 
interpreter killed in September and saw his dead body, which 
was shot in the head.  In August and September of 2006, Essam 
received written threats, left in his car windshield and in 
front of his parents' house.  The door of the house was 
painted on with dead threats against Essam in November of 
¶2006.  Essam has continued to receive threats in different 
forms until the present.  In February of 2007, he was shown a 
detailed hit-list with his name on it.  Essam believes that 
the threats are coming from Shia militias, which are very 
strong in southern Iraq.  In February of 2007 militias broke 
into his house looking for him again, at a time when Essam 
had left in disguised to a local internet cafe. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Justification for resettlement:  Essam reports that 
he lives in virtual seclusion, moving every few days to a 
different house to stay with friends and relatives.  He 
hardly ventures to the street or any public venue.  He is 
under a great deal of anxiety, believing that he can be 
targeted at any time.  He is also deeply upset by the death 
of his colleague and friend in September of 2006 (Note: 
Essam choke in tears when, speaking on the phone with the 
Embassy Refugee Coordinator, he recalled images of his friend 
murdered.  End note).  Essam is too afraid to work, and has 
been forced to terminate his relationship with his fiancee 
because her family could not see a future for him in Iraq. 
Essam is favorably known to his former American supervisors, 
who called the attention of the Embassy to his situation. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Financial situation of PA:  Principal applicant has 
very little financial resources.  He invested his savings to 
open a computer shop, but the threats made it difficult for 
him to take care of his business.  He is trying to collect 
money from the sale of its small inventory and from family, 
in order to go to Syria. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Name check:  Completed.  No matching hits.
