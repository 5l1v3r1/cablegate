URGENT IMPROVEMENT 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is a PRT Salah ad Din reporting cable. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Severe overcrowding and lack of hygiene 
in Salah ad Din (SaD) jails require urgent action.  PRT Rule 
of Law (RoL) coordinator is making this a priority, in 
cooperation with Iraqi authorities.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) PRT Rule of Law (RoL) staff have witnessed 
first-hand gross overcrowding and lack of hygiene in Salah ad 
Din jails, particularly the Iraqi-administered Tikrit 
Terrorist Jail (TTJ).  Inmates have less than one square 
meter per person (they sleep on carpets that are rolled up 
during the day), there is one shower for over 110 inmates, 
latrines are inadequate in quality and quantity, and inmates 
get a medical visit only once a month.  On the positive side, 
females and minors are not/not commingled with adult males, 
and as far as we can tell, inmates are not abused by jailers, 
though they are subject to abuse by interrogators. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The PRT understands that land has been set aside 
for a new 1,000-bed jail.  Three billion Iraqi Dinars (over 
USD2.5 million) have been allocated for construction in the 
2008 budget and the province intends to request another three 
billion ID in the 2009 budget.  However, ground has not been 
broken on this project, and there is no expectation that it 
will be ready before end 2009 at the earliest. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) RoL Coordinator is seeking immediate improvements 
by urging Iraqi authorities to provide portable toilets, 
expand the TTJ by erecting tenting outdoors, institute inmate 
screening and classification as part of the intake process, 
and enhance medical screening and treatment.  The RoL 
Coordinator is also attempting to bring a Department of 
Justice International Criminal Investigative Training 
Assistance (DOJ/ICITAP) corrections program to the Iraqi 
police jailers in SaD in an effort to establish progressive 
procedures and change the corrections culture.
