Press Release of the Presidency Council on the events in 
Basrah. 
 
The Council of the Presidency issued a statement on recent 
events in the Governorate of Basrah which read: 
 
Basrah has been the scene of armed and terrorist gangs which 
are carrying out murderous acts, kidnapping, intimidation and 
acts of smuggling and the confiscation of the resources of 
the State and citizens.  The Government must take decisive 
steps to restore security and order.  In this regard, we call 
on citizens and tribes and political blocs to stand 
side-by-side with our security forces in their striving to 
eliminate all armed protests and return Basra to the desired 
path to security and prosperity and building and 
reconstruction. 
 
And we would like on this occasion to emphasize that the 
central directives require not targeting a particular wing or 
current, and are focused on parties outside the law, 
regardless of affiliation. 
 
His Excellency the President of the Republic and his two 
Deputies carried out constant contact with the Prime Minister 
on the latest events, stressing the necessity of imposing the 
rule of law (Fardh al-Qanoon) and preserving the lives of 
civilians and their property and allowing a continuation of 
municipal services to the ordinary citizen without hindrance. 
 
 
The Presidency Council in coordination and cooperation with 
the rest of the state institutions is watching the situation 
closely in the Governorate of Basrah and other Governorates 
and hopes to put and end to the unnatural conditions in the 
near future.
