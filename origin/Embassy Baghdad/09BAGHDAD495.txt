SUBJECT: NAJAF BUSINESSMEN ON TRADE WITH IRAN:  "NO OTHER 
CHOICE" 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 196 
 
Classified By: Senior Advisor Gordon Gray for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  Najaf businessmen expressed frustration with 
their limited choices of foreign business partners in a 
February 23 meeting with Senior Advisor Gordon Gray.  Too 
often, they said, they are finding doors closed to them in 
Jordan, the Arab Gulf states, and Europe.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) Senior Advisor Gray, Provincial Reconstruction Team 
officers, and emboffs met with Najaf Chamber of Commerce 
Chairman Zuhair Sharba and approximately 15 businessmen who 
are members of the Chamber on February 23 in Najaf.  When 
asked about Iranian influence on Najaf,s trade environment, 
they responded:  "We have no other choice."  They suspect 
Iraqis outside Najaf judge them sympathetic to Iran in their 
business dealings, but were adamant this is not the case. 
 
¶3. (C) The Najaf businessmen told us they feel marginalized 
by the Arab business community.  One stated he owns several 
businesses in Jordan but the Government of Jordan refuses to 
issue him a visa to visit his own companies.  He is offended 
by being asked sectarian questions on his Jordanian visa 
application.  Others expressed disappointment with the Arab 
Gulf states, saying they are often ignored and not taken 
seriously as trading partners.  Many of the businessmen 
contrasted the ease of travel to Iran with the difficulties 
in obtaining visas from Arab Gulf countries.  The businessmen 
said they welcome competition and look forward to business 
dealings with Europe and the United States, but cited 
difficulties in obtaining visas there as well. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment:  Najaf businessmen provided much the same 
feedback on the poor quality of Iranian products as Iran 
Watcher heard in Erbil (reftel).  But unlike businessmen in 
Kurdistan who are close to Turkey, those in Najaf feel 
trapped and without options.  Increased trade and investment 
links, with Arab Gulf states, the broader region, or 
industrialized economies abroad would help counter Iranian 
influence in Najaf,s business community.  End comment.
