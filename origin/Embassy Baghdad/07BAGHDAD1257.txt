REF: BAGHDAD 1252 
 
¶1.  (SBU) During an April 8 meeting, Minister of Science and 
Technology Dr. Rai'd Fahmi Jahid and Director General of 
Nuclear Technology Mohammad al-Sharaa told PolMilOffs that 
the GOI had drafted a non-proliferation law.  They said that 
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had 
helped the ministry draft the legislation, adding that the 
GOI was now discussing the draft with the IAEA.  Jahid and 
al-Sharaa said that the draft legislation had been approved 
by the Council of Ministers and forwarded to the Council of 
Representatives, but were unable to provide additional 
details about the exact status of the law in the legislative 
process. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On April 11, al-Sharaa forwarded us a copy of the 
legislation, as well as the associated draft "Iraqi National 
Monitoring Directorate Law."  (Note: We have e-mailed these 
to NEA/I-PM, USDEL OPCW, and UNVIE.)
