¶1. (SBU) The GOI has agreed to an International Compact with 
Iraq (ICI) meeting on Novmeber 7, UNAMI Senior Representative 
of the Secretary-General (SRSG) Ad Melkert has told donor 
countries.  Melkert said this meeting would "mark the 
transition to the next new stage of interaction between the 
Government and Iraq,s partners, with the GOI in the lead.8 
Melkert said UNAMI would work with the GOI on the meeting 
preparations and that UNAMI would keep donors informed. 
Based on extensive conversations with the donor countries and 
UNAMI, post expects the meeting to be at the ambassadorial 
level. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Melkert earlier told the GOI in an October 18 letter 
(shared with us on October 21 and emailed to the desk) that a 
new Iraq/donor partnership was needed that "recognizes the 
GOI's lead in defining development priorities."  Melkert 
urged that the "highest level of government" should guide the 
national planning process, and that the National Development 
Plan (NDP) ) which would be implemented through a single 
planning and budget process ) could form the basis of 
cooperation between Iraq and its partners.  He also suggested 
that the GOI create a single donor coordination body that 
would harmonize the donors' strategies with the GOI's 
development agenda. 
¶3. (SBU) For the November 7 meeting, Melkert has suggested 
that agenda include: the GOI's preparations on the NDP, the 
GOI's social and economic policy direction, ongoing reforms 
based upon ICI achievements, the way forward for stronger 
coordination of policies among the GOI and international 
partners, and follow-up in the transition period around the 
upcoming elections.  (Comment: The ICI meeting will coincide 
with the NDP Workshop in Erbil, scheduled for November 5-8, 
and is followed by the Ninth International Reconstruction 
Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) Meeting already slated for 
November 8.  End Comment.)
