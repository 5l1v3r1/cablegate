SUBJECT: INFORMATION UPDATE ON ALGERIAN DETAINEE 
 
REF: ALGIERS 2337 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Post passed Embassy Algiers' request for 
information (see Reftel) to Coalition Forces, and 
has been informed that Mohmad Ahmed Mohamed Waber 
(DPOB 27 SEP 1975, Al Shalaf, Algeria) was detained 
on 21 May 2005 inside a targeted terrorist safe 
house.  Mr. Waber has been referred to the Central 
Criminal Court of Iraq for trial.  Mr. Waber, who is 
held at the Coalition's Camp Bucca detention 
facility near Um Qasr, was not in possession of a 
passport or other national identification at the 
time of his detention. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post notes that Section V of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention (Articles 136-141) addresses the 
responsibility of detaining powers to transmit 
information concerning persons detained.  Article 
137 makes an exception for those situations in which 
the information's transmission "might be detrimental 
to the person concerned or to his or her relatives." 
Post defers to the Department on whether this 
provision is applicable - either legally or as a 
matter of policy - in this case, and to Embassy 
Algiers as to its assessment of whether passing 
details of Mohamed's detention to the GOA might have 
any possible detrimental effect on Mohamed or his 
relatives.
