SUBJECT: MESSAGE FOR THE SECRETARY: AGRIBUSINESS FUNDING 
NEEDED IN FY06 SUPPLEMENTAL 
 
¶1. (SBU) I appreciate all the work you and the Department have 
done in getting a strong supplemental request for assistance 
to Iraq.  It was good news to see that OMB had agreed to 
include the funding for national capacity development. 
 
¶2. (SBU) I believe we are in good shape, with one exception - 
funding for agribusiness development.  We have talked a lot 
about the importance of agriculture development as an 
employment generator in Iraq.  Many in Congress also have 
shared their sense of the importance of facilitating the 
development of this sector. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Restoration of the agriculture sector is critical to 
stabilization in Iraq, both for employment and revenue 
generation.  Agribusiness in particular needs to be a key 
focus of our activities.  There is little Iraqi capacity to 
process, package, market and distribute agribusiness foods and 
services.  The result is that Iraq ends up importing many 
processed goods that it could provide itself and loses the 
employment and revenue. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We also need to focus the next government on subsidy 
reduction.  We can expect a number of allies in this effort, 
but it will continue to be politically challenging.  Success 
in reducing food subsidies will depend, in part, on increasing 
production and availability of processed goods in the domestic 
market. 
 
¶5. (SBU) I understand the OMB logic of preferring to put these 
types of programs in regular appropriations bills.  However, 
we did not get the funding for which we asked in the regular 
FY06 appropriation, and FY 07 funding is unlikely to be 
available for another year.  After the first OMB passback, we 
already cut our supplemental request in half. 
 
¶6. (SBU) I am concerned about missing this opportunity.  I 
believe that revitalizing the private agriculture sector and 
generating new employment can play a key role in our efforts 
to undermine the counterinsurgency. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) I recommend appealing this one item with OMB.  If 
you like, I would also be willing to call Josh Bolton to 
reinforce the point.  Thanks, Zal
