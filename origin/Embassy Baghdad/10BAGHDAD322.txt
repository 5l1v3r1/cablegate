SUBJECT: INL Baghdad January Highlights 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: INL Baghdad continues to see progress on its 
Judicial and Law Enforcement Assistance (JALEA) programs and police 
training transition efforts.  The Police Transition Team (PTT) 
completed an initial, detailed assessment of basing and staffing 
options.  JALEA's Iraq HJC Court Administration Project (IH-CAP) 
graduated its first class of statistics trainers.  With the 
assistance of the INL-funded University of Utah program, the Higher 
Judicial Council (HJC) subcommittee completed its review of the 
Iraqi criminal procedure code.  Continuing its efforts to support 
the HJC in the wake of the October 25 headquarters bombing, INL has 
donated 67 containerize housing units (CHU) for the temporary 
administrative complex; 30 additional CHUs will be delivered 
shortly.  The Judicial Development Institute (JDI) is one step 
closer to opening after the nomination of ten higher-level judges to 
serve as adjunct trainers.  INL Baghdad's Judicial Protection 
Service (JPS) program graduated its first 14 Facilities Protection 
Service officers following an inaugural course on screening 
operations.  End Summary. 
 
Police Transition Planning Continues 
------------------------------------ 
¶2. (SBU) The PTT continues planning for the 2011 transfer of the 
police training mandate from the Department of Defense to the 
Department of State.  INL Baghdad has held regular meetings with 
Mission and U.S. Military regarding possible hub sites in Baghdad, 
Basrah and Erbil regarding location, budget, life support, medical 
and personal security detail (PSD) contracts, and excess property. 
The PTT has drafted a 56-page preliminary assessment and 
recommendations for basing and staffing options for the proposed 
hubs in Baghdad, Erbil, and Basrah. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The PTT report recommends: placing INL advisors and 
associate life support and security staff at Forward Operating Base 
(FOB) Prosperity and Joint Security Station Shield in Baghdad; 
partnering with the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG)to fund a base 
of operations in Erbil; and collocating with the Provincial 
Reconstruction Team (PRT) at Contingency Operating Station (COS) 
Basrah.  This would minimize costs and security threats while 
maximizing the INL advisors' ability to serve the GOI project 
beneficiaries. 
 
HJC Graduates Statistics Trainers 
--------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) With INL Baghdad support, the Iraqi Higher Judicial Council 
(HJC) Statistics and Planning Department graduated its first class 
of statistics instructors on January 24 following a four-day 
train-the-trainer program.  Held at the INL-sponsored Judicial 
Development Institute (JDI), the instructor development course 
served as a pilot for future programs at the facility with JDI staff 
participating in the course to gain exposure to teaching 
methodology.  The HJC will hold a second class in March following 
the HJC's nomination of senior judges who will serve as JDI 
instructions and curriculum developers. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Since 2008,INL Baghdad has worked with the HJC Statistics 
and Planning Department to review its data collection process and to 
create standardized, automated forms which will improve efficiency 
and data accuracy.  Previously, the HJC had various forms requiring 
new transcription at every level.  In addition, the new forms will 
Qnew transcription at every level.  In addition, the new forms will 
allow for better data analysis.  INL also worked with the HJC to 
develop a statistical desk book for harmonizing the efforts of 
national and provincial practitioners.  Based on that experience, 
the HJC independently drafted section procedures, standards, and a 
definition section for its annual report. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) While the statistics course, procedures, and products 
reflect patient INL capacity building efforts, the HJC has taken 
ownership of the process and built upon the foundation to expand its 
own standard operating procedures.  The HJC has requested INL 
assistance in developing similar products for case management, human 
resources, budget and planning and the Judicial Security Department, 
amongst others. 
 
UU Completes Criminal Procedure Code Review 
------------------------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) Following 40 meetings with HJC-appointed retired judges and 
consultations with judicial investigators, investigative judges, 
public prosecutors, trial judges, defense lawyers, and NGOs, the 
 
BAGHDAD 00000322  002 OF 002 
 
 
University of Utah-supported HJC sub-committee has completed its 
review of the Iraqi criminal procedure code.  The Iraqi-led group is 
now refining its recommendations.  The next step for the 
sub-committee is now to shift from data gathering to presenting its 
recommendations to a wider audience for input and revision. 
 
¶8. (SBU) HJC Chief Justice Medhat praised the INL-sponsored UU 
project, noting that it was the first to marry Iraqi technical legal 
expertise with international advisors adding their knowledge of 
comparative and international standards.  This differs from the 
prevailing practice of international advisors reviewing and drafting 
recommendations for Iraqi legal reform with little to no Iraqi 
expert involvement in the endeavor at the outset.  Chief Justice 
Medhat has instructed other international donors to adopt the INL/UU 
model.  Separately, the European Union Integrated Rule of Law 
Mission for Iraq (EUJUST LEX) acknowledged the strength of the 
INL/UU model at a January legislative reform conference in Brussels. 
 
 
Support for HJC Temporary Administrative Complex 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶9. (SBU) INL Baghdad is continuing its support to the HJC in the 
wake of the October 25 MOJ/HJC headquarters bombing.  ICORs met with 
HJC Director General Karima to affirm INL's donation of 67 CHUs to 
support the temporary administrative complex.  INL donated an 
additional 11 CHUs to the MOJ. 
 
Increasing Progress Made Toward JDI Opening 
------------------------------------------- 
¶10. (SBU) Reflecting INL's long term capacity building efforts, 
JDI's Consultative Board has assumed the leadership role in 
developing its own subject-matter experts and curriculum, 
particularly related to Iraqi law.  The Consultative Board has 
nominated 10 high-level judges to serve as adjunct trainers.  Once 
approved, the judges will receive instructor development at JDI, 
tentatively scheduled for March.  To supplement Iraqi expertise, JDI 
Director Judge Hanna has requested that INL provide additional 
training to judicial investigators on domestic violence and honor 
killings as well as programs already being developed in areas such 
as terrorism, criminal investigations, and murder investigation. 
 
¶11. (SBU) As a result of HJC's relocation to the new location at the 
Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCC-I) Karkh campus following the 
October 25 joint MOJ/HJC headquarters bombing, JDI has housed the 
displaced Task Force 134.  This has delayed JDI campus finalization 
efforts.  Following the January closure of Forward Operating Base 
(FOB) Falcon, INL coordinated the movement of 37 CHUs to the HJC 
Administrative Complex adjacent to JDI for temporary use by the 
court for its administration, and to provide space for the 
processing of detention orders for suspected terrorists.  INL 
subsequently provided 30 more CHUs, for a total of 67.  As well as 
increasing the HJC's administrative capacity, the additional CHUs 
will allow all of the JDI facility to return to its intended use as 
a training facility. 
 
JPS Offers First Security Training Course 
----------------------------------------- 
¶12. (SBU) INL's Judicial Protection Service (JPS) project graduated 
14 Facilities Protection Service (FPS) officers following its first 
Q14 Facilities Protection Service (FPS) officers following its first 
training course entitled "Screening Operations" at the Rusafa 
Justice Palace, December 21.  JPS worked closely with the HJC to 
develop the curriculum for the two-day course on vehicular and 
personal searches and terrorism indicators.
