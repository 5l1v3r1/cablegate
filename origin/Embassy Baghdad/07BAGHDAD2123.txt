In a clarification, the Presidency of the Region of 
Kurdistan denied that it is interfering in the internal 
affairs of Turkey with the approaching elections there. 
 
The Statement by the Presidency of the Region stated the 
following: 
 
With the approaching Turkish elections to be held next 
July, there are rumors that we are interfering in the 
internal affairs of Turkey and that we have certain 
influences over the Turkish elections. 
 
We emphasize that we did not interfere in the internal 
affairs of Turkey and we will not have a negative influence 
on the future of the elections.  On the contrary despite 
the attempts of the Turkish authorities to obstruct 
development and progress in the region of Kurdistan, we 
have always tried to keep ourselves far from the internal 
problems of Turkey. 
 
Although we have repeatedly been accused of helping and 
assisting the PKK, we reiterate again that we have not 
supported and assisted this party with logistics or in any 
other way, but instead we have tried to build friendly 
relations with all of the political and social components 
in Turkey.  This is because we do not encourage any 
interference in the affairs of any country and we do not 
condone the use of violence to solve problems, but instead 
have always chosen dialogue and mutual understanding in 
solving them. 
 
If we are called upon to cooperate and support any 
political process that serves peace and peaceful 
coexistence and strengthen good-neighborly relations 
between the region of Kurdistan and Turkey, we would be 
ready.  We are fully convinced that friendship, 
good-neighborliness and cooperation are the only way 
through which we will be able to coexist with Turkey - or 
any other neighboring country - on the basis of common 
interests and respect for others, and to answer all 
accusations. 
 
The Spokesman for the Presidency of the Region of Kurdistan
