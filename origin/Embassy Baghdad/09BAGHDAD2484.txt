SUBJECT:  U.S. OUTREACH TO THE MUSLIM WORLD: FARAH PANDITH DESCRIBES 
AMERICAN EFFORTS TO BOLSTER PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE MUSLIM WORLD IN 
DVC WITH IRAQI CONTACTS 
 
¶1. Summary: The Department's Senior Advisor on Muslim Engagement 
Farah Pandith conducted a digital video conference with Iraqi media 
and cultural contacts to explain her office's role in reaching out 
to Muslim communities. This event engaged major media players in 
Iraq during Ramadan, allowing for productive discussion about 
tolerance and U.S. efforts to partner with Muslim communities. Media 
reports on the dialogue were positive, as were the comments which 
EMBOFFS picked up from the audience immediately after the event. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. On September 9, post hosted 20 journalists, students and 
academics for a digital video conference (DVC) with Farah Pandith, 
Senior Advisor on Muslim Engagement. The program was preceded by an 
embassy-sponsored Iftar.  Journalists from three of the leading 
newspapers in Iraq attended the event. The national "Al-Iraqiya" 
satellite station was granted exclusive television coverage of the 
event. "Radio Sawa," "Radio Rasheed," and "Radio Iraqi Republic" 
attended and reported on the event, as did the director of the 
website Neqash and cultural magazine "Masarat." 
 
¶3. The event elicited news coverage from state-run TV station 
al-Iraqiya on September 11. The report began with footage of the 
twin towers being attacked and then directly shifted to images of 
President Obama and Secretary Clinton in Cairo, people walking in 
the streets of America, and inserts of the DVC gathering.  The 
correspondent then stated: "Eight years have passed since the 9/11 
bombings and the image has changed; America has a new face. This is 
the message President Obama delivered in his Cairo speech a few 
months back. Steps are being taken to expand the dialogue between 
Muslim societies and America."  "Al-Iraqiya" ended its report by 
stating: "This new opening to the Muslim world comes after biased 
U.S. policies towards Muslims since September 2001. It means that 
the U.S. is serious about changing its image towards Muslims through 
open dialogue and cooperation between America and Muslim societies. 
The future will truly tell whether this relationship will succeed or 
not." 
 
¶4. Lead evening stories for "Radio Iraqi Republic" and "Radio 
Rasheed" highlighted post's endeavors to enhance educational and 
scientific relations with Iraq. Radio Sawa's online article stated: 
"On the anniversary of September 11, State Department Special 
Representative calls for renunciation of violence." The article 
repeated Pandith's message that focusing on young people in Muslim 
communities is key in preventing violent ideologies. 
"Radio Sawa" asked about the possible ending of cultural projects in 
the wake of the withdrawal of U.S. troops, and in response, Pandith 
explained that "both President Obama and the Under Secretary of 
State for Public Diplomacy have talked about the importance of 
cultural diplomacy, and of course we continue to do more in this 
area." 
 
¶5. The success of this DVC was manifest in positive media reporting, 
and in comments gathered from guests after the event. Many of the 
journalists agreed with one comment that this was a "fresh" and 
interesting topic, requesting more such exchanges. Many of them said 
it was a pleasure and relief to cover an issue which was not 
political, security, or violence related.
