¶1. (SBU)  On June 22, we delivered the 2009 Trafficking in 
Persons (TIP) report to Minister Plenipotentiary Mohamed 
Alhamaimidi, the head of the North America desk at the MFA. 
We informed Alhamaimidi that the Department had evaluated and 
ranked Iraq as it does other countries, not as a special 
case, as had been done in previous years.  We informed 
Alhamaimidi that Iraq has been ranked as a Tier 2 Watch List 
country and explained the implications of this, including the 
possible sanctions and waivers involved if a country moves 
into Tier 3 status.  Deputy Political Counselor described 
steps that the GOI must take to improve its ranking, such as 
passing anti-TIP legislation, prosecuting violators, and 
protecting victims. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Alhamaimidi acknowledged that Iraq does have a TIP 
problem and confirmed what the Minister of Human Rights had 
told us on June 16 (reftel A) that the MFA had received a 
letter from the Government of Syria detailing a group of 
young Iraqi girls who had been trafficked for the purposes of 
prostitution and had subsequently been imprisoned. 
Alhamaimidi said that he was going to raise the issue with 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to 
see if they could provide legal assistance in these types of 
cases. 
 
¶3. (SBU) At the same time, Alhamaimidi seemed surprised when 
we raised the issue of third-country nationals who are 
trafficked into Iraq for purposes of labor exploitation.  He 
claimed that the GOI had nothing to do with this issue and 
thus could not be held responsible.  We responded that the 
report did not accuse the GOI of being involved in labor 
trafficking, but noted that the GOI needed to do more to 
provide assistance to victims and punish those responsible. 
We will continue to raise the issue of TIP with the GOI.
