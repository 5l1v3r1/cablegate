SUBJECT:  BAGHDAD CONSULAR LEADERSHIP DAY 2009 
 
¶1.  Baghdad's Consular Section marked the 2009 Consular Leadership 
Day with a series of events and programs that highlighted the 
Section's teambuilding inside the DOS community and beyond.  The day 
began by concluding a two-day Military Passport Acceptance Agent 
training program for five U.S. Army paralegals who traveled from 
bases as far away as Tallil in Iraq's southern Dhi Qar province. 
Thanking the Section for ensuring that American military personnel 
are able to enjoy much needed R&R abroad, Sgt. Freddie Scott 
observed, "I have gained a new respect for the duties of consular 
officers and diplomats and the sacrifices they make." 
 
¶2.  The Section also met with Ambassador Crocker, who presented a 
departing LES member with a Meritorious Honor Award for her 
outstanding work in the Section's ACS Unit.  The leadership program 
culminated with a formal roundtable discussion with Leadership and 
Management Training Division representatives about the challenges 
unique to consular work in Iraq.  While the Section members lamented 
their separation from their loved ones, they were upbeat about their 
working and living conditions since moving to the New Embassy 
Compound and deeply proud of their service at this historic period 
of transition in Iraq.
