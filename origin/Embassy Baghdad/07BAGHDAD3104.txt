This is a Ninewa Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) message. 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) PRT Ninewa organized a September 5 meeting of the 
Mosul Airport Hajj Operations Committee for Iraqi Prime 
Ministerial Advisor on Airports and Seaports Ahmed Al-Saadawi 
and Ninewa Governor Kashmoula.  Both reported the Hajj 
Committee had approved Mosul as a point of embarkation for 
2007 Hajj flight operations.  Al-Saadawi and the Governor had 
an open, candid exchange of information and demonstrated a 
positive willingness to cooperate and share responsibility. 
They then toured the passenger terminal construction site and 
the air traffic control tower.  There remain several 
technical and bureaucratic challenges, most pressingly GOI 
financial commitments, before the flights can be a reality 
but the PRT is confident that with provincial, national and 
Coalition cooperation they will be brought to fruition. 
Successful Hajj flights will likely lead to the resumption of 
regular commercial flights from Mosul Airport. 
 
------------------ 
Current Challenges 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mosul Airport is not yet certified by Iraqi 
authorities for civilian flights.  On 14 August teams from 
the Iraq Civil Aviation Authority (ICAA) and Iraqi Airways 
visited Mosul Airport and indicated a favorable report would 
be forthcoming.  Transportation Attache reported the team 
will need more ground visits to determine if the airport 
meets minimum safety standards. The PRT will facilitate those 
activities, but will need Embassy Baghdad support. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The following items are outstanding for Iraqi 
action: 
 
- Procurement of trained and certified airport security 
personnel: the Governor volunteered to provide security for 
the external checkpoints.  Al-Saadawi committed to working 
with the Ministries of Transportation (MOT) and Finance (MOF) 
to address passenger screening and security equipment needs. 
 
-  Immigration and Customs staff: the Governor confirmed his 
office will coordinate with the appropriate Ministries to 
obtain the required staff and support for both the outbound 
and inbound Hajj Operations. 
 
-  ICAA funding:  Al-Saadawi to follow up on ICAA needed 
budget preparation for Hajj Operations and out of budget 
cycle funding for Operations and Maintenance needs of the 
Passenger Terminal (utilities, fuel, parts, supplies etc). 
 
-  Aircraft Ground Support Equipment (GSE): In concert with 
the PRT, a revised and scaled-down list of required airside 
and landside equipment for the passenger terminal and 
pre-screening facility was presented.  The Governor requested 
to Al-Saadawi that GOI fund the needs and that he would 
arrange emergency medical services, overnight housing needs 
and ground transportation contingency for the Hajj pilgrims 
in the event of late or canceled flights. 
 
----------------- 
And the Future... 
----------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Al-Saadawi and the Governor both agreed that Hajj 
operations are a precursor to scheduled, daily domestic 
flights to Baghdad.  PRT suggested February, March or April 
for potential start of service.  Al-Saadawi concurred and 
committed to coordinating the Iraqi Airways 2008 Budget to 
include Mosul operations.  During a September 10 meeting, the 
Vice-Chair of the Hajj Committee told EmbOff that his 
committee fully supports Hajj flights from Mosul and would 
look into funding the equipment needs. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Several bureaucratic speed bumps may slow the 
transition but Al-Saadawi expressed confidence.  Al-Saadawi 
 
BAGHDAD 00003104  002 OF 002 
 
 
said Air Traffic Control Tower section of ICAA's 2008 Budget 
would include funding for Mosul's Operations and Maintenance 
to encompass personnel, training, certification, utilities, 
as well as miscellaneous expenses.  There remains a need to 
develop and execute a Letter of Agreement with Coalition 
Forces for air traffic services.  Al-Saadawi also agreed that 
a Joint Use Agreement between CF and GOI must be prepared to 
address airport safety and operational matters.  He said the 
turnover of the passenger terminal area to GOI was the first 
of future turnovers to GOI for full airport operation and 
control. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The PRT remains cautiously optimistic about Hajj 
flights operating out of Mosul in 2007.  The symbolic import 
will do much to improve the local image of the USG as well as 
the credibility of provincial and national Iraqi governmental 
promises.  We believe that Hajj flights will lead to regular 
civilian flights out of Mosul, linking the city economically, 
culturally and politically to Iraq and the region.  PRT will 
eventually continue to work with MND-North, Embassy Baghdad 
and our Iraqi partners to achieve our common goal.
