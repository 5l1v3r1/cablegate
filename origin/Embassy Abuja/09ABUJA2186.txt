SUBJECT: NIGERIA: REQUEST HUMAN RIGHTS VETTING FOR 
CANDIDATE FOR UNDERGRADUATE PILOT TRAINING 
 
¶1.  Embassy requests the Department's assistance under the 
Leahy Act and the Foreign Assistance Act in screening the 
following individuals who have been nominated for training by 
OFFICE OF SECURITY COORPORATION ABUJA.  The individuals are 
to attend UNDERGRADUATE PILOT TRAINING at LACKLAND AFB, 
HOLLOMAN AFB, AND VANCE AFB IN THE UNITED STATES beginning 
sometime after 23 DECEMBER 2009 and lasting fifteen to 
eighteen months.  Embassy has no derogatory information. 
However, a check by consular section revealed discernable 
hits on Ibrahim, Muhammad to warrant the submission of a 
security advisory opinion (SAO) when this person seeks a U.S. 
visa, thereby requiring additional lead time prior to 
issuance.
