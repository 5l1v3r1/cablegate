¶1. (U)  This is an action request.  See paras. (4) and (5). 
 
 
¶2. (U)  During a meeting with Ambassador Jeter on March 28, 
Kaduna State Governor Ahmed Makarfi discussed at length his 
desire to bring in a U.S. company to exploit solid minerals 
in his state.  He claimed that there were squatters 
illegally mining gold and other precious metals in Kaduna. 
He asked for USG assistance in first determining what 
minerals were present and whether or not they exist in 
commercially viable quantities for exploitation.  Second, he 
asked that U.S. natural resource firms be "invited" to 
consider developing Kaduna's natural resources. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Makarfi also claimed that Libyan firms had 
approached him about exploiting these resources, and 
expressed a desire not to have a major Libyan presence in 
Kaduna. 
 
 
¶4. (U) Action request for USGS.  What information does the 
USGS have regarding the presence of solid minerals in Kaduna 
State? 
 
 
¶5. (U) Action request for Department of Commerce.  There appears 
to be the potential for minerals development in Kaduna 
State.  Does USDOC know of any U.S. companies which might 
be interested in exploring this possibility, or have 
expressed interest in solid minerals exploration and production in 
Nigeria?
