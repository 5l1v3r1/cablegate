SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UNGA THIRD COMMITTEE DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 95334 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: During the course of a September 8 meeting 
with Foreign Minister Ojo Maduekwe, Assistant Secretary David 
Kramer delivered reftel demarche.  The FonMin seemed amenable 
to coordination with the USG on both country specific and 
thematic resolutions, and provided responses on the issues of 
Iran, Zimbabwe, No-Action Motions, and the Defamation of 
Religions resolution.  The FonMin also said he looked forward 
to continuing the discussion at UNGA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) IRAN: The FonMin stated that the GON was "in sync" 
with Washington on non-proliferation and the need for a 
tighter reign on Iran.  The FonMin added, however, that an 
open dialogue and multilateral approach was always best. 
(Note: After the meeting, Maduewkwe and A/S Kramer were 
approached by the press, who asked if they had discussed the 
supposed Iranian-Nigerian nuclear deal.  Maduekwe 
categorically denied on camera that any agreement had been 
signed, challenged the press to produce a copy of any such 
document, an admonished the press for spreading falsehoods. 
"It is a figment of your imagination," concluded FonMin 
Maduekwe.  End Note.) 
 
¶3. (U) ZIMBABWE: A/S Kramer thanked the FonMin for the GON's 
public statement on Zimbabwe and inquired about the GON's 
views on a possible resolution.  The FonMin replied that the 
GON and and Government of Zambia issued a joint statement 
declaring that the formation of a Zimbabwean government which 
did not include Morgan Tsangvirai's opposition Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC) "will have repercussions."  Maduekwe 
added that it was wrong to ignore a party which had the 
support of 47 percent of the population, and categorically 
denied that the GON would embrace a government without the 
MDC.  Further, he pledged to "enter into very serious 
consultations with other African governments to come up with 
measures to press for a resolution to the situation."  The 
FonMin added that if Mugabe "does what he threatens," the GON 
will be "hard on him" and would support sanctions and even 
the deployment of an African standby force.  Additionally, 
the FonMin requested patience in response to future USG 
requests for public statements, as it is important that the 
GON not be portrayed as merely a "stooge" of Washington. 
 
¶4. (U) NO-ACTION MOTIONS: When A/S Kramer asked for support 
in blocking "no-action motions," the FonMin requested that a 
member of his delegation make note of the request so he could 
follow up. 
 
¶5. (U) DEFAMATION OF RELIGIONS: In response to A/S Kramer's 
caution about the dangers of the "defamation of religions" 
resolution, the FonMin suggested the USG and GON needed to 
look through the text of the resolution together to find 
common ground.  Noting Nigeria's large Muslim population, the 
FonMin stated that it is important to try to find a way to 
address concerns about freedom of speech while still 
respecting cultural sensitivities. 
 
¶6. (U) Post intends to deliver a summary non-paper of all 
demarche points to working level contacts at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and will report back with any additional 
responses from the GON.
