SUBJECT:  WESTERN CAPE PARLIAMENT ELECTS ZILLE AS PREMIER 
 
¶1. (U)  On May 6, at the same time that the first session of the 
National Parliament was taking place, so was the inaugural session 
of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. During the session Helen 
Zille was elected and sworn in as Premier of the Western Cape. 
¶2. (U) Cape High Court judge Dennis Davis, standing in for Acting 
Judge President Jeanette Traverso presided over proceedings. As in 
the National Assembly, members of the 42 seat provincial parliament 
were sworn in prior to the election of the Premier. Zille and DA 
provincial leader, Theuns Botha were in the first group to be sworn 
in while COPE member, Allan Boesak was the last to take the oath. 
The atmosphere was one of general excitement, as DA members 
exclaimed that this is what they have worked for. The DA unseated 
the ANC from the province in last month's general election, 
relegating the ANC to the opposition benches for the first time in 
years. ANC members were, however, upbeat as the swearing-in 
continued, making wisecracks and friendly interjections. 
¶3. (U) The DA went into proceedings with a 22 seat majority over the 
14 ANC, 3 COPE , 2 ID and 1 ACDP seat and was expected to dominate 
proceedings. The election for the Speaker of the Western Cape 
Provincial Parliament was the first order after members were sworn 
in, with the DA's candidate being Shahid Esau, while the ANC 
nominated Phillip Jacobs as their candidate. Esau was elected as 
Speaker for the Provincial Parliament while Richard Majola of the DA 
was elected Deputy Speaker. Nominations for the Premier were then 
called upon, unsurprisingly the DA nominated Zille, while the ANC 
proposed Lynne Brown as an alternate candidate. Members then cast 
their vote by secret ballot, proceedings were adjourned and votes 
were counted. Zille secured 24 voted and Brown 14, in a reversal of 
events that took place in the National assembly COPE refused to 
support the DA candidate and spoilt its ballots. 
¶4. (U) Opposition parties congratulated Zille and Cosatu Western 
Cape issued a statement congratulating her on her appointment and 
promised to co-operate with the provincial government to fast-track 
service delivery. The trade union, however, added that "Cosatu wants 
to let the premier know that we will be watching her closely and 
will hold her to account". In her congratulatory speech ANC 
provincial leader, Lynne Brown, said her party would be a loyal, but 
"very strong" opposition. In her acceptance speech Zille highlighted 
the core values that would be vital under her governance, namely 
honesty, and defining, accepting and meeting the responsibility of 
office. She added that the DA "will govern for all the people of the 
Western Cape, in all our rich diversity. We will be a government for 
all the people."  After the swearing-in ceremony, Zille briefed the 
media about her plans for the Western Cape. Zille reiterated the 
importance of responsible citizenship and transparency of 
government.  She stated that her priority as Premier was to ensure 
that the systems and structures of government were appropriate and 
working. She stressed that it was important to have the right people 
in the right places and that sound leadership and guidance be given 
at all times. Zille is expected to announce her cabinet by May 8.
