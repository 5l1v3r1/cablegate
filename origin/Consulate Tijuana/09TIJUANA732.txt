SUBJECT: POLICE MURDERS SHOW THE DIFFIUCLTY OF BRINGING DOWN THE DRUG 
CARTELS IN TIJUANA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Amy Radetsky, Econ , Pol/Econ, State. 
REASON: 1.4 (b) 
 
¶1.  (C) The evening of July 6, two municipal police officers, 
one from Tijuana and one from Rosarito, were killed and a third 
policeman was injured in four separate attacks by presumed drug 
traffickers (a fourth police officer escaped unharmed).  One of 
the bodies was found with a note threatening to kill five 
additional police officers each day until Tijuana Municipal 
Secretary for Public Security Julian Leyzaola resigns.   The 
next day, another police officer, the partner of the injured 
officer, was killed while keeping guard outside the Red Cross 
facility where her partner was being treated.   (Post has no 
information regarding additional policemen being killed after 
July 7).   Drug traffickers also sent a message over police 
radio offering one million dollars for Leyzaola's head 
(literally).    Leyzaola has publicly insisted he will not step 
down in the face of threats. 
 
¶2.       (C) Attacks against municipal police are not uncommon in 
Baja California, particularly in Tijuana, and are usually 
assumed to be linked to the victim's own involvement in drug 
trafficking or, sometimes, their refusal to be corrupted. 
However, in the July 6-7 incidents, like another attack in April 
2009 in which 13 police officers died, the victims seem to have 
been randomly selected, and the attacks appeared to be 
coordinated and aimed at sending the message that the cartels - 
and not the city's political leadership - control the municipal 
police force. 
 
¶3.      (C)The attacks on municipal police, at first glance, seem 
odd considering that the large numbers of arrests of cartel 
members and drug seizures have not been the work of city police 
but rather the Mexican Army, the State Preventative Police, and, 
to a lesser extent, the Federal Police (PFP).   However, the 
dueling factions of the AFO which still operate in Tijuana and 
Rosarito rely on the cooperation and protection of local law 
enforcement.   Since coming to office six months ago, Leyzaola 
has fired a number of policemen with links to AFO lieutenant "El 
Teo", and the April and July police killings are likely a 
reaction to these efforts. Moreover, according to ARSO-I 
contacts, Leyzaola, a former military man, has tipped off the 
Army prior to its arrests of AFO members  (an additional eight 
AFO  members linked to "El Teo" were arrested by the Army July 
8.)   Killing municipal police - a much softer target than the 
well-armed convoys of military and federal police that patrol 
city streets -   was an easy way for "El Teo" to express his 
anger. 
 
¶4.      (C)     It is tempting to see Leyzaola as the good guy 
fighting the corrupting influence of the drug cartels, and he 
does indeed seem  intent on modernizing the Tijuana police 
force, and no one has suggested that Leyzaola himself is 
corrupt.  Unfortunately, though, the picture is a bit murkier. 
According to some Post contacts, Leyzaola has gone after "El 
Teo's" allies with such enthusiasm only because he made a "look 
the other way" agreement with one of "El Teo's" rivals within 
the AFO.   He may believe that the only way to bring peace to 
the city is to defeat the undisciplined "El Teo" faction in 
favor of the faction which he believes will be more discreet in 
conducting its business.
