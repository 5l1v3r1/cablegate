(C)  On June 8, CDA and A/DCM met with MFA Secretary of State 
(and Acting Foreign Minister) Ouch Borith regarding reftel. 
Charge cited reftel points and noted the continued detention 
of Aung San Suu Kyi.  He added that while Cambodia was not a 
member of the UNSC, Cambodia is a member of ASEAN and this 
issue is particularly relevant to the ASEAN member states. 
The USG, he continued, is asking that Burma be put on the 
UNSC agenda; there is no mention of sanctions or punitive 
measures.  He provided a copy of the talking points as well 
as the draft resolution, adding that the USG would welcome 
Cambodia's suggestions as to wording of the resolution. 
Borith said that Cambodia has taken a tougher stance on Burma 
more recently, but he would have to consult with Foreign 
Minister Hor Namhong on this issue.  Burma is a very 
sensitive issue for Cambodia because of ASEAN, he added.  He 
said that the MFA would consider the USG request but could 
not make any commitment on behalf of the Minister.
