SUBJECT: PM HUN SEN ANNOUNCES PARDON, PAVING THE WAY FOR 
EXILED PRINCE RANARIDDH'S RETURN 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Prime Minister Hun Sen's September 17 
announcement that he would seek a pardon for Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh paves the way for the self-imposed exiled Prince to 
return to Cambodia.  The NRP decision to recognize the July 
general election results is paying dividends, not only for 
Ranariddh but also for the NRP.  The last remaining Cambodian 
leader-in-exile is expected to return as early as September 
¶26. End Summary. 
 
A Pardon is Promised 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 17 Prime Minister Hun Sen announced 
that Prince Norodom Ranariddh, President of the Norodom 
Ranariddh Party (NRP), could return to Cambodia without 
facing the 18 month prison sentence imposed in March of 2007. 
 The statement follows an announcement last week that Hun Sen 
had given Ranariddh the "green light" to return home from his 
thirty months of self-imposed exile in Malaysia.  Ranariddh 
was convicted in abstentia for breach of trust related to the 
sale of FUNCINPEC property in 2006. (Note: The case against 
Ranariddh is intertwined with the party coup against him 
engineered in October 2006 by erstwhile co-party member now 
FUNCINPEC Secretary General Nhiek Bun Chhay. End Note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to NRP Spokesman Suth Dina, Ranariddh is 
expected to return by September 29, possibly as early as the 
26th.  Hun Sen indicated that the RGC would request a pardon 
for Ranariddh to be signed by King Norodom Sihamoni, in order 
to facilitate Ranariddh's return later this month.  Sources 
could not say what Ranariddh's plans are upon his return. 
Suth Dina informed emboff that Hun Sen's government invited 
the two NRP National Assembly members-elect to serve on 
National Assembly Committees. 
 
Will Ranariddh Stay in Politics? 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Despite earlier rumors that Ranariddh planned to 
withdraw from politics upon his eventual return, Suth Dina 
affirmed to emboff September 19 that Ranariddh is committed 
to remaining in politics.  However, Om Weakchiravuth, Deputy 
Director of the Cabinet of His Majesty the King, told emboff 
that both the King father and PM Hun Sen favor a prohibition 
on royal family participation in politics.  Om speculated 
that legislation to this effect may be the subject of 
negotiations taking place between Ranariddh and Hun Sen.  Om 
also told emboff that a CPP rumor was afloat that the two NRP 
and two FUNCINPEC members-elect would join to form a single 
party following Ranariddh's retirement from the politics. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  While initially joining with the Sam 
Rainsy Party (SRP) and the Human Rights Party in rejecting 
the election results, the NRP later reversed itself and 
recognized the results. (Note:  The NRP won two seats in the 
recent election, dramatically down from their 26 seats in 
¶2003. End Note.)  Ranariddh's return appears to be a quid pro 
quo for NRP's recognition of the results.  In fact, in the 
same breath that he announced the pardon, Hun Sen boasted of 
the success of his divide and conquer strategy against the 
opposition.  While it is anyone's guess as to whether 
Ranariddh will continue to play a direct role in Cambodian 
politics, our bet is that it may be difficult for a political 
creature like Ranariddh to withdraw entirely from the 
political stage.  End Comment.
