SUBJECT: ENHANCING THE U.S.-CAMBODIA MILITARY RELATIONSHIP 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Following the first ever U.S.-Cambodian 
Bilateral Defense Discussions (BDD), the U.S. Pacific Command 
(PACOM) team, accompanied by the Charge d'Affaires, called 
upon Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense General 
Tea Banh to highlight progress achieved in strengthening the 
bilateral military relationship. The PACOM team described 
plans to expand security assistance programs and cooperation 
in a number of areas. Demonstrating Cambodia's commitment to 
enhanced mil-to-mil cooperation, Tea Banh announced RGC 
support for the installation of a Defense Attach in 
Washington, D.C., affirmed Cambodia's commitment to host the 
GPOI Capstone exercise in 2010, and committed to work to 
enhance cooperation through the State Partnership Program and 
upcoming Partner Nation Maritime Needs Assessment.  The DPM 
also raised Preah Vihear, noting that talks scheduled for 
August 29 were postponed due to the unavailability of key 
Thai contacts.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) The first ever bilateral defense discussions 
illustrate the broadening and deepening of the U.S.-Cambodia 
military-to-military relationship.  This relationship has 
grown significantly over the past few years, with three 
recent ship visits and the expansion of security assistance 
programs to the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF).  During 
the BDD, the PACOM-RCAF team agreed to regularize the 
relationship by making BDDs such as this an annual event. 
The DPM designated Colonel Hun Manet of the National Counter 
Terrorism Center to serve as the point of contact for 
preparations for the next meeting, anticipated for late 
spring 2009.  The PACOM team highlighted for Tea Banh 
expanding U.S.-Cambodia cooperation through security 
assistance programs in the areas of maritime security, 
counter-terrorism, boarder security, and peacekeeping 
operations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Perhaps most significant, Tea Banh announced the 
intention of the RGC to meet next week to discuss the 
possibility of installing a Cambodian Defense Attach (DATT) 
in Washington, D.C. (NOTE: While the DPM announced the plans 
to meet to discuss this issue, a senior officer from the 
Cambodian Foreign Policy and Plans Department separately told 
A/DATT that the Cambodians planned to announce their 
intention to install a DATT next week. RCAF counterparts were 
encouraging on the issue of finally assigning a DATT to D.C., 
however they cautioned about the challenges to achieving this 
goal in the near term due to the need to coordinate closely 
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of 
Finance and Economics, and the fiscal implications of opening 
a DATT office in D.C. END NOTE.) 
 
¶4. (U) The Minister also affirmed Cambodia's commitment to 
host the Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative (GPOI) 
Capstone exercise and the creation of a dedicated working 
group to begin preparations for the 2010 exercise.  Tea Banh 
expressed his appreciation for the invitation to observe the 
upcoming 2009 exercise which will be held in Indonesia.  Tea 
Banh welcomed PACOM's announcement that the State Partnership 
Program will soon be approved and announced the creation of a 
working group to better collaborate on the preparations for 
Cambodia's participation in this valuable program. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Tea Banh also explained that the bilateral talks on 
the Preah Vihear dispute planned for August 29 in Siem Reap 
were unfortunately canceled due to some difficulties for 
their Thai counterparts, referring to the recent political 
unrest in Thailand.  He informed the CDA that had the meeting 
gone ahead as planed, he expected both sides to announce a 
further withdrawal (or "redeployement") of both countries' 
troops.  The CDA expressed understanding for the postponement 
but noted that further withdrawals would help reduce tensions 
in the area. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: Throughout the meeting, Tea Banh appeared 
more engaged and responsive to the issues raised than he has 
in previous encounters,  and he attempted to convey a sincere 
appreciation for the strengthening military ties between the 
two countries. (NOTE: General officers from the International 
Relations Department later lamented to A/DATT that the 
Minister's attempts to express his deep appreciation for the 
expanding relationship were lost in translation.  END NOTE.) 
The military relationship has expanded significantly since 
restrictions were lifted in early 2006.  The successful first 
BDD and strengthening of mil-to-mil ties demonstrate the 
normalizing" of our bilateral relationship.  The first BDD 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000730  002 OF 002 
 
 
paves the way for even greater cooperation on security 
issues.  The instillation of a DATT in D.C. would help to 
capitalize on these recent gains.
