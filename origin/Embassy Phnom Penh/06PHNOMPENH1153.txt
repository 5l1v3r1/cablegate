¶2.  (SBU)  Accused pedophile and Amcit Michael Joseph Pepe 
was formally charged at Phnom Penh Municipal Court on June 20 
(Reftel).  According to Deputy Prosecutor Nget Sarath, Pepe 
is accused of having sex with at least five girls aged eight 
to thirteen years old.  However, the victims have been 
providing leads to others, so the final number is likely to 
be higher.

Police have also charged Ly Kim Eng with trafficking.  Police 
arrested another woman, Kroung Lang, for supplying her nine 
and ten year old daughters to Pepe.  Lastly, police arrested 
Pepe's cook for conspiracy in trafficking.

alleged victims.  He has requested permission from the police 
to interview Michael Pepe and is awaiting approval.
