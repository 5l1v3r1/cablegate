¶1.  (C)  Summary.  The Ambassador presented a pleased 
Cambodian National Police (CNP) Commissioner General Hok 
Lundy with his passport and visa to the U.S.  He pressed him 
to do more to combat TIP, particularly in the beach resort of 
Sihanoukville and to continue investigating how the owner and 
manager of Chai Hour II were let out of prison and allowed to 
resume business.  The Ambassador pointed out that the 
positive visa decision came with the condition that Lundy 
visit the State Department to discuss TIP.  General Lundy 
welcomed the proposed consultations and added that he also 
wished to meet representatives of the Department of Homeland 
Security (D.H.S.) to discuss the Cambodian returnee program 
and the FBI to talk about cooperation with the Legatt office. 
 He acknowledged the problems with the police in 
Sihanoukville but stated that his police force did not know 
about the Appeals Court decision releasing the owner and 
manager Chai Hour II.  The Ambassador also pressed the 
commissioner about the ten Montagnards who reportedly had 
just been returned to Vietnam, and expressed the hope that 
the upcoming elections would be both fair and peaceful.  Hok 
Lundy informed the Ambassador that Hun Sen now wants him to 
remain in Cambodia to ensure election day safety; two other 
CNP Generals will travel to the conference.  Lundy promised 
to provide revised travel plans to the Embassy soon.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C)  As the Ambassador returned his passport with a U.S. 
visa to Hok Lundy, he informed the CNP commissioner that the 
decision to issue was made at the highest levels of the State 
Department.  The Ambassador continued that the decision came 
with the condition that Lundy visit the State Department. 
The Ambassador emphasized that recently the Embassy has 
learned about many problems with the way TIP cases are being 
investigated and prosecuted in Sihanoukville by the police 
and courts.  He mentioned that though the RGC appears to be 
fighting TIP properly in Phnom Penh much work needs to be 
done in the provinces.  The Ambassador also discussed his 
dismay at the release of the owner and manager of the Chai 
Hour II. 
 
¶3.  (C)  General Lundy thanked the Ambassador for the good 
news about his visa application.  He stated that the CNP had 
stepped up its efforts to combat TIP.  For example, he 
mentioned that the CNP's anti-TIP unit worked directly with 
the NGO AFESIP but these efforts may not be sufficient.  He 
acknowledged that he knew about problems in Sihanoukville and 
promised to tackle them.  Regarding Chai Hour II, he 
reaffirmed the RGC's stance that the decision to release the 
two men was made by the Appeals Court, and he pleaded 
ignorance about their release.  But he emphasized that the 
CNP has returned the convicts to jail and will ensure that 
they serve their sentences.  Lundy pondered that the case 
pointed out the need for a systematic clamp down on 
corruption in Cambodia. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Turning to his upcoming trip to the U.S., the head 
of the CNP welcomed a visit to the State Department to 
discuss TIP as well as a meeting with the FBI to discuss 
joint efforts to tackle crime.  Lundy also proposed a meeting 
with the D.H.S. to discuss the Cambodian returnees.  He 
informed the Ambassador that the Prime Minister has asked him 
to stay in Cambodia to ensure the April 1 commune elections 
were problm-free; as a result, he would send two other CNP 
generals to the conference in Las Vegas.  However, he looked 
forward to going to the U.S. soon and asked for Embassy help 
in making appointments in Washington.  He also hoped that his 
visit would increase trust between the RGC and the USG. 
 
¶5.  (C)  The Ambassador told Lundy that he hoped that the 
upcoming commune council elections would be safe and peaceful 
for the voters, and candidates.  The DCM mentioned that the 
Embassy will deploy some 40 observer teams. 
 
¶6.  (C) The Ambassador also raised with Hok Lundy U.S. 
concern about the refoulement of Montagnards, indirectly 
referencing a March 26 Cambodia Daily article alleging that 
police in Ratanakiri apprehended and returned to Vietnam ten 
Montagnards on March 23.  (Note.  Although the provincial 
governor and police chief denied the incident occurred UNHCR 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000482  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
confirmed with working-level police that refoulement happened 
-- but said one of the ten escaped.  UNHCR sent a diplomatic 
note to the RGC asking it to confirm whether the incident 
happened.  UNHCR estimates that there are currently 26 
Montagnards in Ratanakiri and has an outstanding request to 
go get them.  End Note.)  The Ambassador noted that such an 
incident would be a violation of the 1951 refugee convention 
and urged that Montagnards continue to be given access to 
UNHCR.  The Ambassador also asked in the letter that the RGC 
provide expeditious approval of UNHCR's requests to go to the 
northeast to pick up Montagnards.  The Ambassador told Hok 
Lundy it was critical that the police live up to its 
commitments under the refugee convention. 
 
 
¶7.  (C)  Comment:  The Embassy appreciates the attention that 
multiple agencies and bureaus focused on the admittedly 
difficult question of whether Hok Lundy should be issued a 
visa for official travel to the United States.  We welcome 
the decision to issue and agree fully that Hok Lundy should 
meet with a senior Department official to discuss ways in 
which Cambodia can make further progress in the battle 
against trafficking-in-persons.  We also support Hok Lundy's 
proposal that that he meet with officials from D.H.S. 
interested in the returnee issue.  We are following up with 
Hok Lundy's office for information about the exact dates he 
will be in Washington.  We will pass additional information, 
as soon as we get it, to EAP/MLS in order to set up meetings 
with the Department, FBI, and D.H.S.  End Comment.
