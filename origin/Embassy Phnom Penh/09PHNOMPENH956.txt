¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  Just forty-eight hours after the Royal 
Government of Cambodia's (RGC) December 19 forced deportation 
of 20 Uighur asylum seekers to China (reftel), Cambodia is 
already benefiting from Chinese gratitude and generosity. 
During the official visit of Chinese Vice President Xi 
Jinping, commemorated with hundreds of Chinese flags 
displayed along the capital's major thoroughfares, China 
pledged to provide USD 1.2 billion in economic assistance to 
Cambodia.  Referring to the deportation of the Uighurs which 
took place less than a day before Xi's arrival, RGC Minister 
of Information Khieu Kanharith told reporters that "China 
thanked the government of Cambodia for assisting in sending 
back those people."  China has long used foreign aid as a key 
tool in cultivating closer relations with Cambodia, wooing a 
series of leaders with foreign assistance since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations in 1958.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The 14 bilateral agreements signed December 21 
between China and Cambodia are valued at USD 1.2 billion, 
more than the cumulative total of Chinese assistance over the 
past 17 years.  The assistance will be provided in the form 
of grants and soft loans to Cambodia and will reportedly 
support infrastructure projects such as roads, irrigation, 
and power transmission lines, among others, as well as provde 
undisclosed technical assistance. 
 
¶4. (SBU) China is already Cambodia's largest donor, dwarfing 
other donors with USD 930 million in aid and loans since 
1992, according to RGC spokesman Khieu Kanharith.  Of the 
nearly USD 1 billion in assistance for 2009 pledged by 
international development partners, China pledged the most 
with USD 256 million.  By contrast, the EU and European 
countries pledged USD 213 million, Japan pledged USD 112 
million, and U.S. development assistance to Cambodia in 2009 
totaled approximately USD 62 million.  Of the USD 256 million 
from China, however, as much as USD 240 million was provided 
in loans, not grants.  Chinese preferential loans are often 
used to support projects invested by Chinese companies. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Chinese foreign direct investment in Cambodia is 
booming, with USD 339 million in Chinese investments approved 
in the first three quarters of 2009 (compared to the record 
USD 3.94 billion approved during the same period last year), 
according to Center for the Development of Cambodia 
statistics.  (NOTE:  Approved projects are not meant to 
reflect actual investments on the ground and may not even 
reflect firm plans to invest.  END NOTE.)  Chinese companies 
are estimated to have invested over USD 1.76 billion as of 
late 2008, primarily concentrated in garment factories and 
infrastructure projects, and the energy, agriculture, and 
tourism sectors.  Bilateral trade between the two countries 
continues to grow, topping an estimated USD 1 billion in 
¶2009. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Prime Minister Hun Sen frequently praises China for 
its "blank check" policy on assistance, and criticizes other 
donors who to seek to condition aid on political and economic 
reforms in the country.  During a September inauguration 
ceremony for a bridge built with USD 128 million in Chinese 
aid, Prime Minister Hun Sen lauded the Chinese for providing 
assistance with no strings attached, saying "they are quiet, 
but at the same time they build bridges and roads, there are 
no complicated conditions." 
 
¶7. (C) COMMENT:  Chinese financial assistance to Cambodia 
provides a strong incentive for Cambodia to support Beijing's 
policy objectives.  The recent deportation of the Uighur 
asylum seekers coinciding with the visit of Vice President Xi 
and the conclusion of the new assistance agreements raise 
questions about the non-transparent quid pro quos often 
attached to China's "no strings attached" assistance. 
Nevertheless, China's conditions on assistance appear to be 
more palpable to the RGC than other international development 
partners' "strings," and could erode donor efforts to use 
assistance to promote improved governance and respect for 
human rights.
