 ¶1.  (U)  On May 8, A/DCM met with Ministry of Mines and 
Industry Secretary of State Ith Praing, and delivered the 
letter from Kelly Cummins included in reftel.  Praing 
welcomed the offer of USG assistance and suggested a 
timeframe of July 9-15 for a visit by a DOE team.  Praing and 
his Deputy Director General, Victor Jona, provided A/DCM with 
a copy of the 2004 report by the IAEA regarding radiation 
safety infrastructure in Cambodia.  Praing explained that his 
office has worked in the past with the Australian Nuclear 
Science and Technology Organization (ANTSO) on this issue. 
He provided the Embassy with a copy of a May 3, 2007 letter 
from Allan Murray, leader of the Regional Security of 
Radioactive Sources Project in ANTSO to Praing regarding a 
donation by the U.S. Department of Energy of a set of 
radiation detection equipment as well as the offer of a 
related training course.

Secretary of State Ung Phirin, and provided him with a copy 
 
SIPDIS 
of the letter, explaining that a U.S. DOE team would be 
visiting in late summer at the request of Dr. Ith Praing. 
Due to the radiological source material being located in 
hospital site(s) in Cambodia, the Mission wanted to ensure 
that the Ministry of Health was properly informed as the DOE 
team would be visiting hospitals and welcome the opportunity 
to meet with MOH officials as well during the proposed visit. 
 Dr. Phirin, who studied radiology in the United States, was 
pleased to learn of the visit and the prospect of USG 
assistance.  He said he was aware of problem surrounding 
radiological sources and disposal of waste materials.  Phirin 
promised full MOH cooperation and assistance during any 
upcoming visit. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Post understands from ensuing emails between Ith 
Praing and DOE Southeast Asian Program Manager Sarah 
Dickerson that the timetable for a DOE visit might slip to 
August.  Regardless of the timing, the Embassy welcomes the 
proposed DOE visit.  Future Embassy contact point for this 
project will be Political Officer Janet Deutsch, who may be
