SUBJECT: CAMBODIA AND DRAFT UNSCR ON BURMA 
 
REF: STATE 197809 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Chief Margaret B. McKean; Reason:  1.5 (b) and 
(d) 
 
 ¶1.  (C)  On December 27, the Ambassador and Pol/Econ Chief 
met with MFA Secretary of State Ouch Borith regarding reftel 
demarche.  (Note:  P/E Chief had met separately on December 
15 with MFA Deputy Director for International Organizations 
So Soeung Ha and delivered reftel demarche points.  At the 
time, no senior MFA officials were available.  End Note.) 
The Ambassador prefaced his remarks by underscoring USG 
recognition of PM Hun Sen's outspoken position on Burma over 
the past year and the PM's willingness to meet with exiled 
NLD parliamentarians during the inauguration of the Cambodian 
National Assembly's Burma Caucus.  The Embassy, however, had 
been disappointed with Cambodia's lack of support during the 
Third Committee vote regarding the human rights resolution on 
Burma. 
 
¶2.  (C)  The Ambassador provided Borith with a copy of the 
demarche points, noting that the draft resolution is not 
punitive and does not call for sanctions.  He emphasized that 
ASEAN nations have a strong stake in Burma's future, and 
urged the RGC to engage with UNSC members who may oppose the 
resolution.  Borith responded that he had read the text of 
the resolution and agreed that it was not objectionable.  The 
MFA official said that he would take up the matter with FM 
Hor Namhong to see if the RGC could approach members of the 
Security Council, but made no guarantees.  He added that 
Cambodia is aware that China opposes the resolution. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Borith explained that the RGC stance towards the 
human rights resolution on Burma in the Third Committee was 
geared to providing the Rangoon government with one final 
chance to take positive steps on its own initiative. 
However, the RGC will be studying developments in Burma very 
closely and hopes that ASEAN member states will coordinate 
action on Burma in the future.  Borith underscored that 
Cambodia's recent vote against the Burma human rights 
resolution was not a change in the PM's policy. 
 
¶4.  (C)  On a separate subject, Borith told the Ambassador 
that the PM had met recently with a Japanese delegation, and 
North Korea was discussed.  Borith said that next year, the 
RGC would support a DPRK human rights resolution in the Third 
Committee.  (Note:  Cambodia abstained during the no action 
motion this year.  End Note.)
