SUBJECT: DEFAMATION CASES MOVING FORWARD; MU SOCHUA STILL PREDICTING 
HER WALK TO JAIL 
 
REF:  Phnom Penh 273 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  As the courts announced two sets of appearances 
on May 7 in the crossed cases for defamation by Prime Minister Hun 
Sen and opposition parliamentarian Mu Sochua against each other, the 
Ambassador May 1 reached out to Mu Sochua to express concern for her 
wellbeing.  DCM the same day spoke to Minister of Information Khieu 
Kanharith, who stated that the issue of lifting her parliamentary 
immunity had been initially raised by Mu Sochua and was not the 
government's intent.  Sochua believes an April 29 speech by Hun Sen 
has sealed her fate, but Khieu Kanharith claimed that the court case 
was an effort to bolster perceptions of the Prime Minister's 
political strength in the wake of unfounded international criticism, 
and hinted that moderate CPP elements may prevail.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Mu Sochua Paints Herself Resigned to Jail 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador told Mu Sochua that the Embassy was 
following her case closely, expressed concern for her wellbeing and 
noted some seemed to believe that her arrest was imminent.  Sochua 
acknowledged local legal views that there were a number of steps 
that would have to be taken before she could be arrested, including 
the lifting of her parliamentary immunity, which she felt was "only 
a matter of time."  She referred to PM Hun Sen's April 29 comments 
(reftel) which she said were a "clear signal" of what was going to 
happen. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ambassador asked Mu Sochua why she believed that her 
immunity would be lifted when the defamation case was a civil matter 
that could proceed without the lifting of her parliamentary 
immunity.  Mu Sochua paused and pointed again to the prime 
minister's remarks.  Noting that her life was "too important to be 
taken by surprise," she stated that she was making preparations to 
go to prison. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) If the authorities tried to arrest her, she said, "I will 
not seek U.S. Embassy protection, as I am functioning as a Cambodian 
citizen and elected representative of the Cambodian people."  (NOTE: 
Mu Sochua is an American citizen. Public comment about her case is 
likely subject to Privacy Act restrictions. END NOTE.)  The 
Ambassador reiterated concern for her wellbeing and noted that the 
Embassy would continue to follow her case closely. 
 
Khieu Kanharith: The CPP Got Involved 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In answer to the DCM's expression of concern for Mu 
Sochua's treatment, Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith 
explained that the question of if, and how, the PM should react to 
Mu Sochua's suit was discussed at the CPP party level.  (NOTE: A 
party congress was held over the weekend. END NOTE.)  CPP members 
were divided across the entire spectrum, from no response at all to 
a very strong response.  In the end, the advice Hun Sen accepted was 
that a failure to address the issue would have appeared weak, and 
that some response would be better than no response at all.  Khieu 
Kanharith considered the advice Hun Sen finally took had been 
"moderate." 
 
Hun Sen Goaded Into Action 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) When asked why the submission of a court case had been 
supplemented by more fiery rhetoric (reftel), the minister replied 
that the PM's recent statements were prodded by a letter he recently 
received from foreigners that was very critical of the Hun Sen. 
That, coupled with Mu Sochua's own statements about being "led to 
jail" - which was published all over the world - was, in CPP's view, 
far 
more damaging to Hun Sen's reputation than his own remarks that 
didn't even mention Mu Sochua by name.  When asked to clarify 
whether the government had seriously considered lifting her immunity 
and arresting Mu Sochua, Khieu Kanharith said no and claimed that 
that had been raised only by Mu Sochua. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The DCM urged Khieu Kanharith to advise Prime Minister Hun 
Sen that it was important not to escalate the issue still further, 
despite whatever provocations would come.  He also urged resolution 
of the civil cases with a minimum of rhetoric and acrimony.  The 
minister seemed to accept that harmonious relations were preferable 
but he clearly could not guarantee that that was the course that Hun 
Sen would follow if subjected to persistent provocation.  The DCM 
noted that the Embassy would continue to follow the case closely. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Notwithstanding Mu Sochua's view that she will 
soon "walk to jail," the facts on the ground indicate that the 
government has combined a defamation law suit with rhetorical 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000279  002 OF 002 
 
 
flourishes in response to her perceived provocations.  Certainly, no 
one with whom we have spoken about the case - except Mu Sochua 
herself - believes that her arrest is contemplated, much less 
imminent.  That said, the thin skinned Hun Sen has never abided what 
most consider fair comment about his government - a serious failing 
that our representations and some of our programs try to address.
