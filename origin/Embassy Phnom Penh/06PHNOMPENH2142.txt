SUBJECT: RGC RESPONSE ON CAMBODIA'S CWC STATUS 
 
REF: STATE 193643 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU)  On December 5, post received a preliminary 
response to the demarche to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
regarding Cambodia's CWC status.  The MFA said that in 2006, 
the RGC established through Royal Decree a National Authority 
to deal with chemical, biological, and other weapons of mass 
destruction.  A specific role for the National Authority 
reportedly is the implementation of the Chemical Weapons 
Convention.  The Ministry of Defense chairs the Authority, 
and other relevant Ministries (e.g., MFA, Industry) are 
included as Vice Chairs.  The National Authority has yet to 
establish a Secretariat, as this will reportedly require 
financial resources that are not yet available. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The MFA recommended that post contact the Ministry 
of Defense for further information, and suggested General 
Chey Son, Director of the Department of Chemical Protection 
as a starting point.  We will try to meet with him and get a 
better understanding of the country's plans regarding the CWC.
