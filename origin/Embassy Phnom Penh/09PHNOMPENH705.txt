¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  During a seminar on democracy and tolerance in 
Cambodia organized by the Cambodian National Assembly, opposition 
politicians and government officials debated the progress achieved 
to date in consolidating Cambodia's democratic gains.  The seminar 
successfully highlighted the importance of freedom of expression, 
which has come under attack in recent months via the use of 
defamation and disinformation suits against outspoken critics of the 
government.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Democracy and Political Tolerance 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Cambodian National Assembly commemorated International 
Democracy Day September 15 with a day-long parliamentary seminar on 
"Democracy and Political Tolerance."  The seminar included 
representatives from five political parties, human rights activists, 
diplomats, development partners, and media.  Topics discussed 
included political tolerance and freedom of speech, inclusiveness in 
decision making, and a session moderated by Ambassador Rodley on the 
role of Parliaments in strengthening democracy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) President of the National Assembly Heng Samrin highlighted 
Cambodia's democratic progress, noting that eight separate national 
and subnational elections had included participation of 50 political 
parties since democracy returned to Cambodia 1993.  He also stressed 
the interconnectedness of democracy and respect for human rights. 
Om Yentieng, President of the Cambodian Human Rights Commission, 
asserted that Cambodian culture supports human rights, including 
women's political participation, and promotes a culture of 
tolerance. 
 
An Exercise in Freedom of Expression 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) However, opposition politician Sam Rainsy was quick to 
criticize the government's track record.  He sarcastically applauded 
the government for successfully creating the appearance of democracy 
in Cambodia, and accused the National Assembly of serving merely as 
a "rubber stamp" for government policies.  He criticized the state 
of democracy, citing the recent spate of lawsuits against opposition 
politicians and critics of the government. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In response, CPP Chairman of the National Assembly 
commission on foreign affairs Chheang Vun stressed that democracy is 
not only about rights, but also entails obligations.  While 
acknowledging the still imperfect nature of Cambodia's democracy, he 
asserted that Cambodia has made significant progress and continues 
to make democratic gains, as evidenced by the peaceful national 
elections in 2008. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Several Chiefs of Mission, including the UK, Australian, 
and German Ambassadors, joined Ambassador Rodley in moderating the 
discussions in an effort to promote equal participation from members 
of the CPP, opposition parties, civil society, and media.  The 
diplomats and development partners each stressed the important role 
constructive criticism plays in a healthy, vibrant democracy. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Opposition parties and civil society representatives have 
been critical of the National Assembly's rules and regulations, in 
light of the CPP's outright majority following the 2008 national 
elections, which they assert restrict the ability of minority 
parties to effectively participate in Parliamentary discussions and 
debate issues.  The seminar organizers, the National Assembly and 
UNDP, specifically sought Ambassadorial moderators to ensure that 
all sides would be afforded the opportunity to participate and air 
their opinions openly and freely.  This unique arrangement provided 
a valuable lesson and opportunity to highlight the importance of 
tolerance and freedom of expression in strengthening Cambodia's 
democracy.
