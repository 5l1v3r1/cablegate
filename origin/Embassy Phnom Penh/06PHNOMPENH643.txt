 ¶1.  (C)  Summary.  During Ambassador's April 5 meeting with 
FM Hor Namhong, the FM raised the prospect of APEC 
membership, PM Hun Sen's desire to participate in the 
November APEC Summit meeting in Hanoi as part of the ASEAN 
leaders' meeting with President Bush, and the FM's interest 
in meeting with Secretary Rice either in New York at the 
September UNGA meetings or in Washington during the same time 
period.  The Ambassador pressed the FM on Guatemala's 
candidacy for the Latin American seat on the UNSC and tougher 
ASEAN action on Burma, and informed the FM of DAS John's 
upcoming visit to Cambodia.  End Summary. 
 
Cambodia/U.S. Bilateral Relations, APEC, Burma and Guatemala 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  On April 5, the Ambassador met with Foreign Minister 
Hor Namhong, noting that he would be leaving for the States 
at mid-month and would be discussing Cambodia's bilateral 
relationship in Washington.  He noted that the positive 
political developments of the first quarter augured well for 
further development of more productive relations between the 
two countries.  The FM agreed, saying that Cambodia wants to 
improve understanding between the two countries as well.  He 
said that of primary interest to Cambodia is APEC membership, 
adding that Cambodia has asked Vietnam to raise the issue at 
the APEC Summit in Hanoi in November.  The Ambassador noted 
USG concerns with lifting the membership moratorium, but he 
agreed to report the issue to Washington.  FM Hor Namhong 
said that Prime Minister Hun Sen will join the other ASEAN 
leaders in Hanoi and would welcome the opportunity for a 
pull-aside or bilateral meeting at that time.  For his part, 
the FM said he would be interested in visiting Washington to 
meet with Secretary Rice in September when the UNGA meetings 
are taking place. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Turning to Burma, the Ambassador pointed to 
continuing USG frustration with Burma over the political 
stalemate in Rangoon and lack of progress towards democracy. 
Hor Namhong echoed the Ambassador's concern, saying that 
ASEAN leaders uniformly share the frustration as evidenced at 
last year's Summit in Kuala Lumpur.  The FM noted that even 
Vietnam, which previously had not been very forthcoming on 
the subject, has moved closer in line with other ASEAN 
leaders on the subject of Burma.  He said that the Malaysian 
FM would provide a readout of his recent visit to Burma at 
the April 18-19 ASEAN FM's retreat in Bali, but indicated 
that Cambodia is disappointed with the visit, and 
characterized it as a "failure."  Than Shwe holds all the 
power and Hamid was unable to meet with him, he continued; 
the political leaders have no influence nor does Rangoon's 
military junta listen to them.  The FM said that Burma would 
also be discussed later in the year at the leaders' meeting 
in the Philippines.  He added that Burma is not simply an 
issue of concern to ASEAN member states because of its being 
out of step with other ASEAN countries, but also because of 
ASEAN's image.  The Ambassador mused about the possibility of 
suspending Burma's membership in the regional body if all 
else fails; the FM made no comment. 
 
¶4.  (C)  The Ambassador noted USG interest in Cambodian 
support for Guatemala as a candidate for the rotating Latin 
American seat at the UNSC.  He outlined the reasons for 
considering Guatemala's candidacy over that of Venezuela, 
mentioning Venezuela's disruptive behavior at recent 
international fora.  He added that the Embassy was aware that 
Cambodia had already been approached on behalf of Venezuela 
and perhaps had promised to support Venezuela's candidacy. 
The FM said he was not aware of any RGC commitment to support 
Venezuela, and would verify what has taken place concerning 
this issue.  However, he indicated that Cambodia must 
consider seriously the USG's request regarding Guatemala's 
candidacy. 
 
DAS John Visit 
-------------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  The Ambassador said that EAP DAS Eric John would be 
visiting the region at the end of April, and would be coming 
to Cambodia in the April 30-May 2 timeframe.  Although the 
Ambassador will not be in country at the time, he said that 
the Embassy would be submitting a request for a meeting and 
hoped the FM would be available.  Hor Namhong said he was 
planning to travel to Canada in May, but thought he would be 
 
in Cambodia at that time.  If he is present, the FM offered 
to host a dinner.  The FM also expressed his hope that DAS 
John would have the opportunity to see Angkor Wat and visit 
Siem Reap during his stay in Cambodia.  The Ambassador 
offered that there may not be enough time to schedule a side 
trip to Siem Reap. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (C)  We will continue to look for ways that Cambodia can 
be helpful on Burma, although it appears that ASEAN -- while 
increasingly frustrated with Burmese intransigence -- does 
not yet seem willing to entertain more forceful measures 
(e.g., suspension).  We plan to revisit the issue of 
Guatemala with the MFA to ascertain if their position on 
Venezuela has changed in the aftermath of the Ambassador's 
intervention with the FM.  The FM's interest in ensuring a 
successful DAS John visit was genuine.  End Comment.
