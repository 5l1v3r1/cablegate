¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  A Labor Day march with more than 1,000 
workers proceeded peacefully despite the brief and detention 
by police of union leader Chea Mony, police checkpoints at 
roads leading into the capital, and unconfirmed reports of 
isolated clashes between police and workers elsewhere in the 
city.  Last week, the Phnom Penh municipal government denied 
union leaders' request for permission to hold the march, but 
union leaders vowed to proceed anyway.  While denying 
permission for the march and police intervention were 
regrettable, Chea Mony's release and the subsequent decision 
to allow a modified march demonstrate that the government has 
learned to moderate its response to public protest.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
March Proceeds Despite Detention, Barricades 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Two pro-opposition unions, the Free Trade Union of the 
Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia (FTU) and the Cambodian 
Independent Teachers Association (CITA), applied for 
permission to hold a Labor Day march in Phnom Penh from the 
National Assembly to Wat Langka and back to the National 
Assembly.  The Phnom Penh municipality denied their request 
last week, citing potential confusion caused by an already 
planned rally by the pro-government Cambodian Confederation 
of Trade Unions (CCTU) at the National Assembly.  FTU leader 
Chea Mony and CITA leader Rong Chhun vowed to go ahead with 
plans for the march without permission. 
 
¶3. (U) Early on the morning of May 1, police surrounded FTU 
headquarters and also reportedly blocked major roads into 
Phnom Penh, refusing to allow pick-up trucks carrying workers 
into the city, but allowing the workers to proceed on foot or 
motorcycle taxi.  At about 8:30 a.m., FTU president Chea Mony 
was detained by police at FTU headquarters and taken first to 
the Russei Keo police station and then to Phnom Penh 
municipal police headquarters.  The police did not present an 
arrest warrant.  Two FTU staff members, an International 
Labor Organization (ILO) representative, and a representative 
from the United Nations Cambodia Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (UNCOHCHR) were present at 
police headquarters, but were not allowed to observe Chea 
Mony's meeting with police.  Police also reportedly told Chea 
Mony that he could not have a lawyer present.  After 
approximately two hours, Chea Mony signed a letter promising 
a modified march route from FTU headquarters to Wat Langka 
(near the site of union leader Chea Vichea's assassination 
two years ago) and back to the FTU, was released, and joined 
the march in progress.  There are no charges currently 
pending against him. 
 
¶4. (U) After receiving word of Chea Mony's release and the 
agreement, CITA leader Rong Chhun led more than 1,000 workers 
from FTU headquarters to Wat Langka.  There, Rong Chhun, 
opposition party leader Sam Rainsy, human rights activist Kem 
Sokha, and Chea Mony spoke to the crowd, calling for 
increased freedom of expression, protection for workers' 
rights, increased salaries for teachers and garment factory 
workers, and lower gasoline taxes.  Sam Rainsy led the 
workers back to FTU headquarters, where the crowd disbursed. 
 
¶5. (U) In public remarks at a separate Labor Day rally 
organized by the human rights organization ADHOC, Econoff 
expressed regret at Chea Mony's detention and reminded the 
assembled crowd that freedom of assembly was guaranteed under 
the Cambodian constitution. 
 
Unconfirmed Reports of Clashes Elsewhere 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) In addition to the brief detention of Chea Mony and 
police checkpoints entering the city, union leaders and NGO 
activists have also made unconfirmed reports of isolated 
clashes between workers wanting to join the march and police 
at several locations throughout the city.  In some cases, 
police are alleged to have beaten or used electric batons or 
water cannons to subdue workers, although there are no 
reports of serious injuries. 
 
Disagreement Among Top Ministry of Interior Officials? 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) According to the unconfirmed account of one police 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000814  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
officer, top Ministry of Interior (MOI) officials failed to 
reach an agreement about how to deal with the protesters and 
gave contradictory orders.  Interior Minister Sar Kheng 
decided to allow the march after speaking with Sam Rainsy on 
the phone in the morning.  However, National Police 
Commissioner General Hok Lundy disagreed with this decision, 
and ordered his officers to establish checkpoints and prevent 
pick-up trucks from entering the capital. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) While still restricting freedom of assembly, the 
Cambodian government seems to be learning how to moderate its 
reaction to unwelcome public protest.  Whereas last fall's 
criticism of the border treaty and critical comments on a 
banner at a Human Rights Day rally landed several union and 
human rights activists in jail, this unauthorized march was 
allowed to proceed, albeit after a brief detention of one of 
its organizers.  While hardly action to be applauded, it is 
noteworthy that the MOI negotiated with the opposition to 
permit the march, and government reaction could have been far 
more extreme.  END COMMENT.
