REF:  PHNOM PENH 570 
 
¶1.  One adult and two children with fevers and respiratory 
problems were admitted to Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh on 
Saturday.  The three have been tested for avian influenza 
and results are expected by tomorrow.  The three patients 
come from a neighboring village in the same district as the 
three-year-old girl who died of avian influenza on March 21 
(reftel).  The district--Kong Pisei district in Kampong Speu 
province--is about 30 miles from Phnom Penh.  According to 
press reports, the three individuals had handled dead 
chickens before falling ill.  Jean-Louis Sarthou, director 
of the Pasteur Institute, told DCM today that the Ministry 
of Health/WHO/Pasteur Institute investigation team was quite 
concerned about the new cases. 
 
¶2.  Press reports indicate that an additional five people 
who had contact with the three hospitalized individuals are 
also being tested for avian influenza.  According to Dr. 
Sirenda Vong of the Pasteur Institute, seven individuals 
with mild symptoms who were being monitored on Friday have 
all tested negative for avian influenza and their symptoms 
have disappeared. 
 
¶3.  Investigation team officials report being deluged with 
press calls about the reported death.  Due to concerns about 
the safety of the affected individuals and their families, 
the potential for misleading rumors, and the time and energy 
involved in responding to constant inquiries, they are 
maintaining a fairly tight-lipped approach.  Team officials 
are particularly concerned that the name of the three-year- 
old who died has been leaked--or possibly sold--to the press 
and has appeared in some news accounts. 
 
¶4.  Post's CDC office will remain in close contact with the 
investigation team and is prepared to provide technical 
assistance, if requested.
