¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  An official from the Anti-Human 
Trafficking and Juvenile Protection (AHTJP) Police Unit 
confirmed the arrest of two Cambodians involved in a 
virginity sale and child trafficking business in Phnom Penh 
and Kandal Province.  The two traffickers, and an American 
perpetrator arrested subsequently, are all being held in 
pre-trial detention.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On January 22, police from the AHTJP unit arrested 
35-year-old Mey Sovann and 47-year-old Sek Vy in connection 
with a pedophilia and trafficking ring.  According to police, 
the two traffickers allegedly collaborated in selling the 
virginity of underage girls over the Internet.  After 
arranging details over the Internet, taxi-driver Mey would 
meet arriving potential perpetrators at the airport and 
transport them the guesthouse owned by Sek in Kandal 
Province, where the criminal acts took place.  The two 
allegedly sold the virginity of multiple underage girls for 
approximately $3,000 USD per night.  While Mey and Sek are 
currently charged on three separate counts involving three 
16-year-old girls, Police Major General Bith Kimhong, 
Director of the AHTJP Unit, told Poloff on January 25 that 
police are searching for more victims, some of whom may be as 
young as 12 years old. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On January 25, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court 
questioned Mey and Sek and officially charged both with 
violations of Article 28, "Procurement With Regard to Child 
Prostitution" and Article 35, "Soliciting for Child 
Prostitution" under Cambodia's 2008 Law on the Suppression of 
Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation.  The procurement 
charge carries a potential sentence of 7-15 years because the 
victims are under the age of 18.  The soliciting charge, 
which has not been used since the promulgation of the 
anti-TIP law in February 2008, criminalizes the advertisement 
of child prostitution or solicitation of another person to 
participate in child prostitution, and carries a potential 
5-10 year prison penalty when the offense is committed as a 
business.  The questioning of the two is the start of the 
investigative phase of the judicial process; when the 
investigating judge concludes the investigation, he will 
return the case to the prosecutor for evaluation. 
Thereafter, the prosecutor will determine whether to send the 
case back for further investigation or forward to the 
presiding judge for trial.  Under Cambodian law, there is no 
time limit set on the investigative phase.  According to 
police, the two have confessed to the crimes. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The arrests are the result of a nearly six-month 
investigation by AHTJP police, in conjunction with the 
International Technical Cooperation Delegation of the French 
police. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Police also arrested an American man, who the court 
charged under Article 34, "Purchase of Child Prostitution" 
and Article 41, "Child Pornography." The man was reportedly 
arrested after the immediate facts leading to the arrest of 
Mey and Sek showed the American was the perpetrator in the 
case involving the three 16-year-old girls.  The man 
allegedly paid $7,800 USD to have the three underage girls 
spend eight days with him.  The man has also allegedly 
confessed to the crimes. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The arrest of the two purported 
traffickers is another step forward for Cambodian police in 
their efforts to improve investigations and arrests of 
trafficking perpetrators.  Authorities in the past would have 
concentrated solely on the foreign perpetrator while 
overlooking the local element in the case.  These arrests, 
following on the heels of the conviction of trafficker Ho 
Ngoy (Ref A), demonstrate that the message emphasized by 
Ambassador CdeBaca during his September visit is being taken 
seriously (Ref B).  The length of the investigation, which 
concluded in an arrest, also shows a growing sophistication 
on the part of the AHTJP police unit.  END COMMENT
