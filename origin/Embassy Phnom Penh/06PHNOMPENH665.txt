 ¶1.  (C)  Summary.  According to MFA Secretary of State for 
ASEAN affairs Kao Kim Hourn, ASEAN has several options for 
moving foward on Burma:  a visit to Burma by the Eminent 
Persons Group (EPG), a visit by the ASEAN Troika, or an 
invitation from the Philippines President to Than Shwe to 
attend the ASEAN Leaders Summit at the year's end (with the 
proviso that only Than Shwe would be welcome).  Kao Kim Hourn 
suggested that China and India could play a useful role in 
influencing Burma; he also thought that ASEAN countries will 
increasingly distance themselves from Burma and stop 
defending the military government.  End summary. 
 
FM Hamid's Visit "a Disaster" 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  On April 9, Pol/Econ Chief met with MFA Secretary of 
State for ASEAN Affairs Kao Kim Hourn to discuss FM Hamid's 
visit and upcoming ASEAN FM meeting in Bali.  Kao Kim Hourn 
characterized Hamid's visit as a "disaster," saying his 
impression reflected feedback from Malaysia and other ASEAN 
countries.  He added that FM Hamid will provide a report to 
the ASEAN Foreign Ministers during the upcoming retreat in 
Bali, which Kao Kim Hourn will attend with Cambodian Foreign 
Minister Hor Namhong.  (Note:  Reftel described FM Hor 
Namhong's reaction to FM Hamid's visit, and the Cambodian 
official's view that the visit was a failure.  End Note.) 
 
¶3.  (C)  Kao Kim Hourn said ASEAN's options are limited. 
Pol/Econ Chief raised the possibility of temporary suspension 
of Burma's membership in ASEAN, and asked if that would make 
a difference to the generals in Rangoon.  Kao Kim Hourn 
responded that suspending their membership would be a huge 
blow as the regime gains legitimacy from being a member of 
ASEAN.  However, there does not exist a mechanism for 
suspension, opined the MFA official, as ASEAN does not yet 
have a charter.  He added that a 10-member Eminent Persons 
Group (EPG) representing the ten member countries is working 
on a draft charter.  Continuing on that theme, Kao Kim Hourn 
proposed that the EPG could factor references to respect for 
democracy and human rights into the charter, thereby calling 
into question Burma's right to membership.  He also offered 
that the EPG could schedule their next meeting in Rangoon. 
Another possibility would be for the ASEAN Troika to visit 
Rangoon.  Finally, Kao Kim Hourn suggested that the 
Philippines invite Than Shwe (and only Than Shwe) to the 
Leader's Summit later in the year, and specify that only he 
would be welcome to represent Burma, as opposed to sending 
one of the political leaders.  That way, Burma's top general 
would hear first hand from other ASEAN leaders how 
disappointed and frustrated the regional body has become over 
Burma's intransigence. 
 
¶4.  (C)  The MFA official said another tack would be to press 
India and China to play a more influential and positive role 
in Burma, as both countries have interests in the country and 
are ASEAN Dialogue Partners with Burma.  When asked if ASEAN 
had formally or informally approached either country, Kao Kim 
Hourn responded in the negative.  Some ASEAN member states 
(NFI) have indicated that ASEAN could not make such an 
approach without Burma's knowledge, as to go behind their 
back would be unacceptable according to ASEAN principles. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Irrespective of how ASEAN proceeds on the issue of 
Burma, Kao Kim Hourn thought it likely that ASEAN would 
increasingly distance itself from Burma.  If other 
international bodies wish to criticize the regime, ASEAN 
member states will likely stand to the sidelines and no 
longer defend the regime. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (C)  Cambodia is not pleased with Burma but unwilling, it 
appears, to take the lead in suggesting that Burma's 
membership be pulled.  Kao Kim Hourn mentioned that the ASEAN 
Secretary General would be visiting Cambodia towards the 
 
SIPDIS 
month's end to participate in another academic meeting 
sponsored by the University of Cambodia, and the Embassy 
might have the opportunity for further discussions on Burma 
at that time.  End Comment.
