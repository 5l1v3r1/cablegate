LABOR ACTION 
 
 
¶1.  (U) During a May 4 International Labor 
Organization-International Program to End Child Labor 
(ILO-IPEC) event to publicize the ILO's second report on 
child labor, Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia 
(GMAC) president Van Sou Ieng outlined GMAC's policy on child 
labor.  He said that any garment factory found to employ 
underage workers must remove children from the factory, pay 
for their tuition at a vocational training center, and pay 
them a regular factory salary during their vocational 
training.  The factory must also agree to re-hire the workers 
once they turn 15, the legal age for employment.  Van Sou 
Ieng threatened to publicly discredit any factory that fails 
to follow this program. 
 
¶2.  (U) Minister of Labor Nhep Bunchin pledged to reduce 
child labor by 10% over the next five years.  (Comment:  This 
is a rather modest commitment given the ILO's goal of 
eliminating child labor by 2016.  End comment.)  Nhep Bunchin 
said that rates of child labor are dropping as parents 
realize the value of education and send their children to 
school rather than to work.  He also lauded ILO-IPEC and RGC 
efforts pilot efforts to eliminate child labor in rubber 
plantations, brick making, and fishing sectors. 
 
¶3.  (U) In a private conversation with Econoff, Nhep Bunchin 
said that new employees for the Department of Child 
Labor--which was created in April 2005 but has only two staff 
members and no budget--should be in place within a month. 
However, Khy Sarin, Deputy Director of the Child Labor 
Department, told Labor Assistant that only three to five 
employees--out of more than 20 needed--will be appointed and 
that the process will take 1-2 months or more. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  GMAC understands that the survival of 
Cambodia's garment industry is predicated on high standards 
for workers' rights and that a lax policy on child labor 
would send many socially-conscious garment buyers packing. 
With a surplus of adult workers looking for jobs, underage 
labor is extremely rare in the garment sector.  The few cases 
documented by the ILO factory monitoring project involve 
underage workers lying about their age and presenting fake 
documents.  Thus GMAC's aggressive policy--which was actually 
put in to practice in an isolated incident several months 
ago--is more about sending a strong signal to buyers than 
about combating a significant problem.  In contrast, the 
government continues to take baby steps to address child 
labor.  Senior opposition official Mu Sochua equates the lack 
of progress with a lack of government commitment to provide 
the necessary funds for education and job creation that would 
motivate parents to keep their children in school.  The 
Ministry of Labor has been weakened by its split from the 
Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans, and Youth 
Rehabilitation more than two years ago and by its ineffective 
FUNCINPEC leader in a CPP-dominated government.  END COMMENT.
