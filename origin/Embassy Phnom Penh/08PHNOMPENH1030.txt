EVICTION NOTICE 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
¶1. (SBU) On December 25, the Phnom Penh Municipal Government issued 
a "final" eviction notice to residents of the Dey Krahorm area of 
Phnom Penh.  The notice, signed by Chamkarmon District Governor Lo 
Yuy, instructs the approximately 130 remaining Dey Krahorm families 
to vacate the area by Tuesday, December 30 or face forced eviction. 
(NOTE:  The notice states that 91 families remain in Dey Krahorm. 
Community representative Chan Vichet told Pol Assistant that the 
government notice did not count an additional 40 families that do 
not have recognized addresses for their residences.  The lawyer 
advising the community believes the majority of these families are 
legitimate residents. END NOTE.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chan Vichet said that the notice does not state when a 
forced eviction would begin.  He speculated that the eviction would 
not happen until a later date, as the Dey Krahorm residents are 
still negotiating compensation proposals with the municipal 
government; community members met with Phnom Penh Deputy Governor 
Mann Chhoeun on the morning of December 29 and held a press 
conference with their formal response to the eviction notice on the 
same day.  Mann Chhoeun would not comment on the case when contacted 
by Pol Assistant, other than to say that he was working with human 
rights NGOs to negotiate a fair settlement for the Dey Krahorm 
families. 
 
COMPENSATION AND LAND VALUES 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In 2003, the Council of Ministers issued a letter to the 
Phnom Penh Municipal Government to create four social land 
concessions for poor families, including one in Dey Krahorm.  (NOTE: 
 A representative of the Community Legal Education Center (CLEC) 
told Poloff that although the Council of Ministers advised that a 
social concession should be created in Dey Krahorm, there was no 
evidence that the concession was actually created.  END NOTE.) 
According to the Housing Rights Task Force (HRTF) and the Cambodian 
League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (LICADHO), in 
January 2005, 36 community representatives signed a contract to sell 
the land in the area to Cambodian construction firm 7NG Company. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The company reportedly offered each family a house in 
Damnak Trayoeung village, located outside of Phnom Penh, plus 
770,000 riel (about $193) and initial food supplies.  (NOTE: 
According to CLEC, the resettlement area in this case is better than 
those offered in other eviction cases.  A CLEC representative 
speculated that because the Dey Krahorm community had the potential 
to keep the land as a social concession, they had a stronger 
bargaining position from which to negotiate sales terms with 7NG. 
END NOTE.)  Those that did not want a house were reportedly offered 
$10,000 in compensation, plus some food supplies. 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to Lo Yuy, about 1,374 families relocated to 
Damnak Trayoeung.  The remaining families state that the community 
members that signed the 7NG contract did so without their consent. 
They say that 7NG's compensation offer is insufficient and counter 
that they should receive $50,000 to $100,000 per family.  According 
to Chan Vichet, these estimates are based on a 2008 land appraisal 
conducted by the Bonna Realty Group, one of Cambodia's largest real 
estate firms, which valued the land in Dey Krahorm between $3,000 
and $6,000 per square meter.  (NOTE:  According to a Property Sales 
Manager at Bonna Realty Group, one square meter of land in Dey 
Krahorm is currently valued at an average of $1,800, given the fall 
in land prices.  END NOTE.) 
 
COMMENT 
------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) The issues behind the Dey Krahorm case are common in Phnom 
Penh land disputes.  Dey Krahorm residents, and those in similar 
situations such as the Boeung Kak Lake community, are demanding 
compensation based on the market value of the lands that they 
occupy.  However, their ownership claims to the land, and hence the 
legal grounds on which they can request compensation, remain murky. 
If the land was indeed granted as a social concession, the Dey 
Krahorm residents do not legally own the land.  If the land was not 
established as a social concession, it would still need to be 
formally mapped and categorized as state public, state private, or 
private land before it could be bought or sold. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Regardless of the status of the land, the legality of the 
sale itself is questionable, given that only a portion of the Dey 
Krahorm community authorized the sales contract.  We do not have 
data on exactly what percent of recognized families initially 
supported the contract, nor on how split decisions like this should 
be adjudicated under Cambodian law.  However, the Phnom Penh 
municipal government will likely do everything in its power to 
ensure that the contract is upheld; the sale provides a basis on 
which to evict poor residents from land that could be used for more
