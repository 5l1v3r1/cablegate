¶1. (SBU) Per reftels, Post delivered an invitation March 23 to the 
Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) to participate in the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) Workshop and Exercise 
Planning Group (EPG) Meeting April 14-16 in Seoul.  Poloff jointly 
delivered the demarche with a representative of the Embassy of the 
Republic of Korea (ROKG) to Brigadier General (BG) Por Phak, 
Director of the International Relations Department in the Ministry 
of Interior (MOI).  BG Por Phak indicated that the RGC is interested 
in participating in both the workshop and the EPG meeting, but said 
that he would have to seek the approval of Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Interior Sar Kheng. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Por Phak explained that since the 2007 promulgation of the 
Cambodian Law on Counterterrorism, the RGC had tried to increase 
cooperation on trans-border smuggling issues with partners such as 
the U.S. and Thailand, and he said that the RGC welcomed 
opportunities to increase engagement with the international 
community on counterterrorism efforts.  He said he thought that 
Cambodia's unique experience in domestic disarmament and anti-arms 
trafficking efforts would be valuable to share in international 
venues such as the GICNT.  Poloff encouraged the RGC's willingness 
to participate in the GICNT and share its experiences.  Post will 
notify ISN/WMDT if the RGC confirms attendance at the upcoming 
workshop and EPG meeting.
