SUBJECT: PROVINCIAL COURT SETS SAM RAINSY TRIAL DATE 
 
REF: PHNOM PENH 949 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Svay Rieng Provincial Court announced 
on January 8 that it will try opposition party leader Sam 
Rainsy on January 27.  Rainsy, currently in France, did not 
appear on December 28 as summoned to answer questions before 
the court on charges of public destruction of property and 
incitement, and does not plan to attend the January 27 
hearing.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Rainsy faces two charges:  public destruction of 
property and incitement to discrimination.  The property 
destruction charge, Article 52 under the United Nations 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) penal code carries 
a possible prison sentence of one to three years, although 
the law specifies that if the damaged property is of little 
monetary value, the prison sentence could be lowered to 
between two months and one year.  The incitement charge 
(UNTAC Article 61) carries a possible prison term of one 
month to one year and a possible fine of one million to ten 
million riels (USD 250-2,500). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Three others, in addition to Rainsy, are evading 
summonses related to this incident; two more defendants are 
in pre-trial detention.  Previously, Rainsy stated he would 
return for questioning and trial only if the government 
declared innocent all of the other individuals involved in 
the incident and agreed to return the disputed land to the 
villagers.  The villagers claim that Cambodian and Vietnamese 
officials encroached on the villagers' private land when 
demarcating the border.  After Rainsy failed to appear for 
questioning as summoned, the court issued a warrant for his 
arrest on December 29. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Although video of the incident shows Rainsy did not 
personally remove the temporary wooden place-locators that 
mark the cement border marker 185 (which remains extant in 
its original location), he continues to claim responsibility 
for the act as a symbolic political gesture.  Tioulong 
Saumura, Member of Parliament, a Sam Rainsy Standing 
Committee member, and Rainsy's spouse, told Pol/Econ Chief 
that Rainsy will not return to Cambodia for the January 27 
hearing because "he will be more effective out of jail in 
France than in jail in Cambodia."  If convicted, Rainsy may 
lose his parliamentary seat, according to Article 14 of the 
Law on the Status of National Assembly Members.  Sam Rainsy 
Party members continue their efforts to appeal to the King 
for a royal pardon for Rainsy's actions.
