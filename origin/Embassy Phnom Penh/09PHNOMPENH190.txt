¶1. (U) This is an action cable. Please see Paragraph nine. 
 
¶2. (U) Reftel is guidance for screening nominees for U.S. sponsored 
training programs. 
 
¶3. (U) To comply with the Leahy amendment relative to U.S. sponsored 
security assistance training, the U.S. Embassy Phnom Penh has 
conducted local human rights vetting for the following individuals 
selected for the Garuda Shield Exercise from June 11-29, 2009 in 
Bandung, Indonesia. 
 
NAME: Samreth Sarin (Male) 
DPOB: 28 Aug 1972, Kandal 
POSITION: Deputy Chief of S3 
RANK: Lieutenant Colonel 
DEPT/UNIT: 911 Special Airborne Brigade 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to 1997 investigations by the Cambodia Office of 
the United Nations Center for Human Rights (now the UN Cambodia 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights), members of the 
911 Brigade were involved with human rights abuses during July 1997 
factional fighting in Phnom Penh and other areas of Cambodia.  The 
investigation report states that the 911 Brigade had detained Lt. 
Col. Sao Sophal together with other soldiers.  Sao Sophal reportedly 
did not return after his second interrogation session with 911 
soldiers, and the OHCHR report states that a reliable military 
source confirmed Sao Sophal was executed near where he was captured. 
 An unidentified male body was later exhumed at the same location; 
the body had no clothing on the other than underwear, the hands were 
tied behind his back, and there were bullet wounds to the head.  Sao 
Sophal has been missing since the incident.  The investigation 
report also states that the 911 Brigade detained and tortured a 
total of 33 soldiers aligned with the FUNCIPEC party during the July 
1997 factional fighting.  The torture was reportedly committed to 
obtain intelligence or to extract confessions from the detainees. 
Detainees reported beatings while tied up, and being hit with a belt 
and lengths of wood, kicking, and punching.  An iron vice was also 
used on several detainees to squeeze fingers or hands until they 
responded satisfactorily. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post believes the allegations concerning 911 Brigade 
soldiers are credible.  Investigations of the incidents did not 
result in the identification of specific officers or subunits 
responsible for the human rights abuses.  As the UN report on the 
incidents states, it is difficult to know whether the abuses 
"resulted from orders or were committed by local officials who took 
the opportunity to settle old disputes."  The full UN Center for 
Human Rights report on the 1997 incidents can be found online at " 
http://cambodia.ohchr.org/EN/statement_1997.h tm.  No members of the 
911 Brigade were held responsible for the July 1997 incidents. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The individual named in this cable was not/not a member of 
911 Brigade in 1997, having joined the brigade in 1999.  Prior to 
1999 he was embedded in a French military assistance unit where he 
worked during the time of the 1997 factional fighting. 
 
¶7. (U) U.S. Embassy Phnom Penh has reviewed its files and finds 
that, as of this date, it possesses no credible information of gross 
violations of human rights by the above individual. 
 
¶8. (U) Individuals will attend the Garuda Shield Exercise from June 
11-29 in Bandung, Indonesia. 
 
¶9. (U) Action request: Please verify whether the Department 
possesses any credible information that the individual named above 
has been implicated in gross violations of human rights. 
 
¶10. (U) Points of contacts for Amembassy Phnom Penh are Major Wayne 
Turnbull at turnbullpw@state.gov or tel: 855-23-728-219, or Janet 
Deutsch at deutschje@state.gov or tel: 855-23-728-118.
