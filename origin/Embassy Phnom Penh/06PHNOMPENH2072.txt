SUBJECT: NORTH KOREAN REFUGEE HELD IN MONDOLKIRI PROVINCE 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Chief Margaret McKean; Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Summary.  The Cambodian press reported on November 
22 that Cambodian provincial police in Mondolkiri province 
arrested a North Korean man in the past week.  According to 
press reports, a senior Cambodian police official confirmed 
the arrest, added the North Korean was deported to Vietnam 
the same day and refused further comment.  However, two Amcit 
NGO workers based in Mondolkiri contacted the Embassy on 
November 22, claiming that the North Korean man was still in 
Mondolkiri and is due to be transported to Phnom Penh very 
shortly.  The two men met the North Korean, who provided them 
with bio data and a request for assistance.  The South Korean 
Ambassador has told us that they are working closely with the 
RGC to quietly move him to South Korea.  His wife reportedly 
was arrested in Ho Chi Minh City on November 9; UNHCR will 
look into what might be done concerning her case.  Church 
World Services (CWS) is aware of the plight of the North 
Korean and his wife.  End Summary. 
 
North Korean Enters Mondolkiri 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (C)  On November 22, the Cambodia Daily reported that a 
North Korean man entered Cambodia's Mondolkiri province from 
Vietnam in the past week, and was arrested by Cambodian 
provincial police on immigration charges.  According to a 
senior police source contacted by the Daily, the North Korean 
was deported to Vietnam.  Deputy National Police Commissioner 
Sok Phal was quoted as saying the provincial authorities made 
no attempt to determine his identity, nationality, or 
possible claim to political refugee status; rather, as the 
individual lacked a passport and any documentation, he was 
returned to Vietnam.  Provincial police sources provided only 
sketchy information, claiming that they were unaware of the 
case.  The provincial coordinator for the human rights group 
ADHOC, Sam Sarin, allegedly indicated that he had heard about 
the case from local police officials, but had no detailed 
information. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Also on November 22, two Amcit NGO workers based in 
Mondolkiri contacted the Embassy through the human rights NGO 
LICADHO, and Pol/Econ Chief met them at LICADHO's offices. 
Recently arrived from Mondolkiri, the two men explained that 
a relative of a senior provincial police official had alerted 
them to the arrest of the North Korean, and invited them to 
meet with him at a local restaurant where the North Korean is 
reportedly staying.  The two men did meet with him, and the 
North Korean asked for assistance to come to the United 
States.  The two men provided Pol/Econ Chief with a note from 
the North Korean that included bio data for himself and his 
wife, and a request to go to the United States.  The two men 
also provided photos of the North Korean to verify that he 
was still in Mondolkiri.  They explained that the Cambodia 
Daily article was inadvertently due to their contact with 
Daily reporter Eric Wasson, who was vacationing in Mondolkiri 
at the time.  The two men mentioned the North Korean to 
Wasson, and asked for advice as to how best assist him, and 
which NGOs to contact. 
 
¶4.  (C)  However, both men denied that Cambodian officials 
have deported the North Korean; they said that their contact 
with the Mondolkiri police told them that provincial 
officials were under instruction to keep him in Mondolkiri 
until after the South Korean President departed the country. 
Following ROK President Roh's departure, he is to be sent to 
Phnom Penh (nfi).  The two Amcits added that they have 
emailed friends at Church World Services in Washington, DC 
regarding this case. 
 
¶5.  (C)  The Ambassador contacted his South Korean 
counterpart, who confirmed that the North Korean was still in 
Cambodia, and that his government would be working quietly 
with the RGC to ensure that the North Korean is moved to 
South Korea.  Pol/Econ Chief met with UNHCR director 
Thamrongsak Meechubot, who was not surprised that the 
Cambodian government had told the press that the North Korean 
had been returned to Vietnam.  He noted the RGC provided a 
similar story several years ago when several North Koreans 
were detained in Phnom Penh; the group was actually sent to 
South Korea.  Pol/Econ Chief provided the biodata of the 
wife, and Thamrongsak said that he would confer with UNHCR 
colleagues as to what UNHCR might do to assist in her case.

¶6.  (C)  The news story indicated that the North Korean had 
expressed interest in going to South Korea, not the United 
States.  We suspect that his note requesting assistance to go 
to the United States was likely more a function of the two 
NGO workers being American.  His liberal treatment in 
Mondolkiri by provincial authorities coupled with the ROK 
President's just-completed visit to Cambodia suggested that 
the RGC planned to be cooperative on his eventual 
resettlement outside Cambodia.  The ROK Ambassador's 
assurances that they are quietly engaged with the RGC on this 
case are consistent with the good working relationship that 
the South Korean government has established with the 
Cambodian government concerning North Korean refugees.
