¶1.  ACTION REQUEST IN PARA 9. 
 
¶2.  SUMMARY:  During a meeting designed to brief Ambassadors from 
seven nations on the status of the World Heritage site of Preah 
Vihear, Deputy Prime Minister Sok An welcomed their participation in 
an International Coordinating Committee (ICC) to help guide the 
planning for the restoration and management of the site.  The DPM 
noted that Thailand would also be invited, as required by UNESCO in 
the World Heritage inscription documents.   He expects the 
discussions to be "peaceful and friendly" and said that Cambodia is 
"seeking cooperation."  END SUMMARY 
 
¶3.  In a meeting that included Ambassadors and representatives from 
the United States, India, Australia, France, China, Belgium, Japan, 
and UNESCO, Deputy Prime Minister Sok An proposed to convene an ICC 
for the recently inscribed World Heritage site of Preah Vihear, and 
advised that all countries present plus Thailand would be invited to 
participate.  The Belgian Ambassador (resident in Bangkok) welcomed 
the proposal and stated his desire to see the ICC convened before 
the next World Heritage Committee meeting scheduled for July of this 
year in Brasilia.  The UNESCO representative advised that the UNESCO 
SYG is informed on this issue and hoped to attend the first session 
of the Preah Vihear ICC. 
 
¶4.  The invitation to participate in an ICC came after an extensive 
briefing by Cambodian and UNESCO representatives on developments at 
the site since the UNESCO listing by Chuch Poeurn, head of the newly 
established Preah Vihear authority and dean of the faculty of 
archeology at the Royal University of Fine Arts and Philippe 
deLonghe, an archeologist working for UNESCO.  DeLonghe's briefing 
emphasized uniqueness of Preah Vihear as a site that was largely 
"untouched" at the time of its listing, and touched on the fact that 
work done since 2006 at the site had "completely changed" the 
experts' understanding of the site.  A professional site management 
plan has been developed and submitted to UNESCO, fulfilling a 
requirement of the World Heritage listing.  The site management plan 
was written by Divay Gupta, an Indian specialist in architectural 
conservation and heritage management; the team that developed it 
included archeologists, engineers and architects from France, 
Belgium, and Cambodia, as well as a former US Park Service senior 
park planner. 
 
¶5.  The establishment of an ICC was the second UNESCO requirement 
after the inscription of the site in July of 2008.  The original 
text of the document required that the ICC be convened by February 
of 2010 and that the committee include no more than seven countries. 
 UNESCO also specified that Thailand should be invited to 
participate.  The formation of the ICC has been delayed due to the 
ongoing border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia on the area 
surrounding the Preah Vihear temple.  Another ICC which focuses on 
the management of the Angkor Wat temple complex has been highly 
successful and Cambodia and UNESCO seek to model the Preah Vihear 
version on the Angkor Wat example. 
 
¶6.  After the briefing and informal invitation to join the ICC, 
several Ambassadors inquired about security at the site.  DPM Sok An 
assured the group that any recent violence in the border area has 
been in isolated areas far from the site of the temple and that 
increasing numbers of tourists are already visiting the site from 
the Cambodian side.  He advised that he would issue a formal 
invitation to form the ICC as soon as possible. 
 
¶7.  DPM Sok An stated that he had approached the seven countries 
present at the meeting as they had contributed experts to the team 
which made formal recommendations on the site or had long histories 
of collaboration with Cambodia through the Angkor Wat ICC.  It is 
expected that they would provide similar support for a Preah Vihear 
ICC. 
 
¶8.  COMMENT:  In several previous discussions about the Preah Vihear 
ICC with the Ambassdor, DPM Sok An had resisted the idea of inviting 
Thailand to participate, citing the 2008 "incursion" of Thai troops 
along the disputed border and pointing to "uncooperative" behavior 
on the part of the Thai during their participation in the Angkor Wat 
ICC.  However, during this briefing he reiterated many times the 
government's decision to invite Thailand.  Several Ambassadors 
probed on this point and he appeared resolute.  There was 
considerable enthusiasm on the part of the attendees for 
participation, although all indicated a need to seek formal 
instructions once the actual invitations had been issued.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
 
¶9.  ACTION REQUEST:  Although a formal request has not yet been 
prepared, DPM Sok An would like an indication of US willingness to 
participate in the Preah Vihear ICC.  When DPM Sok An has raised 
this in previous discussions, Ambassador has always responded that 
the US would probably look favorably on a request to join the Preah 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000089  002 OF 002 
 
 
Vihear ICC as long as Thailand was also invited to join.  Post 
requests guidance on responding to Cambodia's request for our 
participation in the ICC.
