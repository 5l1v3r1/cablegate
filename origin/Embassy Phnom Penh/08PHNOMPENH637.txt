¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  An involuntarily repatriation proceeding 
of 32 Montagnard persons took place in a mostly quiet manner 
and without disruption during the early morning of August 1. 
In contrast to the repatriation that took place on July 18 
(reftel), there was no protest during the August 1 
proceeding.  Several journalists observed the departure from 
outside of the UNHCR site.  Poloff also monitored the 
proceeding.  However, one Montagnard person adamantly refused 
to leave; it was not until after the official deportation 
proceeding was complete and Poloff and journalists had left 
that the police physically removed him from the site and into 
a car headed for the Vietnam border.  UNHCR observers and 
police reported that no assault or physical injury took place 
during his removal, but we are disappointed we did not have 
the opportunity to observe ourselves.  End summary. 
 
Repatriation Relatively Quiet -- No Demonstration 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In the early morning hours of August 1, 31 
Montagnard individuals left on a bus, involuntarily 
repatriated to Vietnam.  All but two of the individuals had 
arrived at UNHCR in Phnom Penh after May 1, 2007.  Compared 
to the repatriation and demonstration on July 18, the August 
1 proceeding was relatively quiet.  A few minutes before the 
bus of deportees left, Poloff heard persons in Site 1 bang 
momentarily on metal parts of the site structure and make 
some shouting noises.  UNHCR reported that the noise was 
quieted by police sending officers inside.  Poloff did not 
observe police entering Site 1 and did not hear more noise 
from the site.  According to Ministry of Interior Deputy 
Director of Internal Security Sovann, the police verbally 
calmed the group in Site 1 by explaining to them they were 
not involved with the repatriation from Site 2. 
 
One Montagnard Forced Into Car 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Minutes after the bus departed Site 2 -- where 
individuals who have been determined not to be refugees are 
housed, UNHCR staff reported to Poloff that one of the 32 
individuals had adamantly refused to leave, and that UNHCR 
and the MOI decided not to force him to go.  At this point, 
Poloff left the site, as reportedly did all of the 
journalists.  UNHCR told Emboffs later that four police 
officers put the individual -- named Siu Thai -- into a car 
rented by the MOI.  Three UNHCR staff and MOI Deputy Director 
Sovann witnessed the movement of Siu Thai into the car and 
reported that no assault or beating took place.  Police then 
reportedly escorted Siu Thai to the Vietnam border where he 
was met by Vietnamese officials along with the other 31 
Montagnard individuals. 
 
MOI Acted To Avoid Demonstration 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In the days before the repatriation, the Cambodian 
Ministry of Interior temporarily transfered Montagnard 
individuals who were not scheduled for repatriation out of 
UNHCR Site 2 to Site 3.  Sites 1 and 2 are adjacent to one 
another, and are where the demonstration took place two weeks 
ago.  Site 3 is located on a different street.  UNHCR 
reported that there were no disturbances while the 
individuals were transferred from Site 2 to Site 3.  There 
have also been no reports of Montagnard persons "running 
away" out of the sites since the July 18 demonstration. 
 
Two Pre-May 1, 2007 Arrivals Repatriated 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Two of the Montagnard individuals -- Ksor H'Nut and 
her daughter Ksor H'Ai -- arrived at UNHCR in Cambodia before 
May 1, 2007, and had therefore been referred to the U.S. for 
consideration for U.S. resettlement despite having been 
determined not to be refugees by UNHCR.  According to UNHCR 
Phnom Penh, the two pre-May 1, 2007 arrivals were denied U.S. 
resettlement by DHS/CIS in early April 2008.  Later in April, 
they filed a Request For Review (RFR) of the decision with 
DHS, which was also denied in early June.  The other 30 
Montagnard persons arrived after May 1, 2007.

¶6.  (SBU) While the Montagnard persons were boarding the bus 
for Vietnam, Voice of America and Phnom Penh Post 
photographers were taking many photos, noticably irritating 
the police and other Ministry of Interior officials.  As 
Poloff is not authorized to enter the site without advance 
written permission from the MFA, the MOI officials still 
agreed to keep open the door to the site despite their 
irritation with the press.  In Poloff's opinion, the press 
asked questions with a notable slant that the police and 
UNHCR were doing something wrong.  However, the MOI keeping 
the doors of the site open offered a window for all who care 
to see that the departure took place calmly and without 
violence, and without apparent inappropriate behavior by 
officials.  In response to a VOA inquiry to the Embassy 
today, post responded that the security and protection of 
Montagnard individuals who have fled Vietnam to seek asylum 
in Cambodia has been one of the highest priorities of this 
Embassy, and Embassy officials observe repatriatons from the 
UNHCR sites to ensure that the departures are conducted in 
accordance with UNHCR and Cambodian procedures.
