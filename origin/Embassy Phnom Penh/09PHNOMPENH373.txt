¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche and talking points June 5 
to NAO Thouk, IWC Alternate Commissioner for Cambodia and Delegate 
of the Royal Government of Cambodia in Charge of Fisheries 
Administration, Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Fisheries. 
Mr. Nao praised Commissioner Dr. Hogarth, stating that the process 
and situation have improved under his leadership and suggested that 
the new Chair should be "someone just like him."  He also spoke 
highly of the U.S. delegation's constructive role and flexibility on 
issues facing the IWC and the "Future of the IWC" talks.  He also 
commented that having an expert in multi-lateral negotiations 
chairing the SWG has been effective. 
 
¶2. (SBU) However, Mr. Nao was candid in his criticism of the severe 
polarization between the anti- and pro-whaling members, which he 
feels threatens the basic mandate of the IWC.  In his view, the 
absence of a third way, one in which both sides are at a minimum 
willing to negotiate on issues, has significantly undermined the 
effectiveness of the Commission.  Without both sides being willing 
to compromise (here he singled out Australia, New Zealand, 
Argentina, and Brazil as being intractable in their anti-whaling 
positions) there could be no consensus.  He frankly stated that 
unless things change, there is no future for the IWC.  Should the 
new Chair be inclined towards the anti-whaling camp, he said that 
there would be "no hope at all" for the future of the IWC. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Regarding observers and the number of members, Mr. Nao was 
indifferent, stating that the participation of observers (which he 
welcomed) or a smaller number of members would be irrelevant unless 
these contributed in some way to achieving consensus.  Whether there 
are 30 or 10 members, the Commission would still face the paralysis 
of polarization, he said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) He criticized what he termed "double standards" of the 
Commission, citing the prohibition of secret voting on proposals but 
allowing secret voting on staffing issues, such as election of the 
Chair and Vice-Chair.  He said that allowing members to vote by 
secret ballot on proposals would better facilitate the work of the 
Commission and assist members who face significant pressure to vote 
a particular way. 
 
¶5. (SBU) He also criticized decisions of the Commission for being 
based on emotional and political not scientific grounds.  Mr. Nao 
cited the Commission's rejection of Greenland's proposal to allow 
the taking of ten whales for aboriginal subsistence whaling, despite 
scientific evidence that such numbers would not impact the 
sustainability of stock.  Outcomes such as these, he stated, 
undermine the credibility and very mandate of the IWC. 
 
¶6. (SBU) He also expressed concern about the undue influence and 
pressure placed on members of the commission who are active 
politicians in their home countries, singling out Australia and New 
Zealand.  He explained that their need to please public opinion back 
home constrains their ability to actively engage on issues to reach 
a consensus.  He suggested that the Commission could function more 
effectively if members were not politicians. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Lastly, Mr. Nao commented on the unhelpful relationship 
between two member countries and Green Peace.  He explained that 
while the Commission has condemned the activities of Green Peace on 
several occasions, he lamented that no disciplinary or corrective 
action has been taken by the countries with such responsibilities. 
He explained that the Netherlands is Green Peace's flag state and 
Australia is its port state.  He suggested that it would "help a 
lot" for discussions in reaching consensus if these two states 
terminated their roles regarding Green Peace.
