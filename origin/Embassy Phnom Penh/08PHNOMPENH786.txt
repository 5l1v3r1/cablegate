"ARE THERE MUSLIMS IN THE U.S.?" 
 
¶1. SUMMARY:  The Embassy hosted a successful Iftar for over 130 
guests, mainly from the Cham Islamic minority in Cambodia.  At the 
end of the event, while looking over the Muslim Life in America 
paper show that PA translated into Khmer, a teenage guest asked an 
Embassy staffer "are there really Muslims that live in the United 
States?", once again proving the value of these outreach efforts. 
END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. Embassy Phnom Penh hosted an Iftar on the evening of September 18 
for over 130 guests from the Cham community, Ambassadors from 
Brunei, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand and a number of Cambodian 
government officials including the Secretary of State for Cults and 
Religious Affairs H.E. Zakarayya Adam.  The chief Mufti of Cambodia, 
Imam Sos Kamry, led the call to prayer. 
 
¶3. Mr. Adam, an observant Muslim himself, delivered remarks thanking 
the Embassy not only for hosting the Iftar, but also for its 
outreach in general to the Islamic minority in Cambodia.  He noted 
the meal would provide nourishment and also nutrients for friendship 
and trust among people who believe in Allah and those of other 
faiths.   The Charge d'affaire's remarks praised the Cham for their 
openness and tolerance, and the Cambodian government for its sincere 
desire to integrate the community into society.  The CDA also made a 
reference to some of the extremist organizations which currently 
provide a significant amount of funding to some of the smaller 
communities in the region.  She stressed that assistance always 
comes with strings attached, whether they are visible or not, and 
that it is up to the leaders of the Cham communities to ask tough 
questions in order to ensure that when aid is offered it is offered 
with their constituents' best interests in mind. 
 
¶4.  After the meal a number of guests expressed their gratitude for 
the Iftars which the Embassy has been hosting since 2004.  Visitors 
praised the Embassy's general outreach efforts to the community 
including ESL scholarships, Fulbright exchanges and speaker 
programs.  A local Imam from Phnom Penh noted that many of the other 
Embassies which represent Muslim majority countries have taken our 
lead and have begun to host Iftar celebrations of their own.
