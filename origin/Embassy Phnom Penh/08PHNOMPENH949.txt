¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Ec Chief delivered reftel demarche November 27 
to Tuy Ri, Director of the International Organizations 
Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, leaving behind 
a list of the 62nd UNGA resolutions as an aide memoire.  Tuy 
Ri took on board our call for Cambodia to vote against or 
abstain on these resolutions as they arise in the 63rd UNGA. 
He was struck by the sheer volume and amount of time devoted 
to the issue and seemed to agree that their content could 
undermine the UN's credibility in the Quartet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Tuy Ri made special note of the three UNGA 
resolutions extending the mandates of three UN bodies as 
being "of particular concern" to the U.S.  He was somewhat 
receptive to Cambodia being absent during some of the votes 
on these resolutions.
