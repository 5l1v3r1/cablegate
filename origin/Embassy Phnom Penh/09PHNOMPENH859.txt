¶1.  (SBU) In accordance with Ref A synopsis of the FY 2010 
1206 proposal review process, herewith are summaries of three 
1206 proposals submitted by Embassy Phnom Penh for FY 2010, 
in priority  order: 
 
 
--Mission Essential Equipment for NCTSF Ground Assault 
Forces, Command, Control and Communications and EOD ($6.3 m) 
 
Project Description: to build the capacity of Cambodia's 
National Counter Terrorism Special Force (NCTSF) to conduct 
decisive CT operations by providing equipment and training to 
establish a response capability; improve C3 and enhance 
direct action proficiency.  Package includes individual and 
collective unit equipment, weapons, communications equipment, 
and explosive ordinance demolition equipment.  By providing 
common equipment and command and control infrastructure 
across the NCTSF Ground Assault elements and NCTSF tactical 
command headquarters, this project will increase the 
operational capability of the unit to conduct CT operations 
on land.  EOD equipment provided to the NCTSF will enable 
them to actively respond to IED incidents. 
 
 
--Cambodian Maritime C3 & Coast Watch ($7.3 m) 
 
Project Description: to build capacity of Cambodian maritime 
security forces, under control of the National Committee for 
Maritime Security (NCMS), to conduct coastal surveillance and 
maintain command, control, and communications between the 
national coordinating authority, subordinate headquarters, 
and operational units. The purpose of building this capacity 
is to address gaps in maritime border controls and maritime 
security that provides transit corridors for Violent 
Extremist Organizations (VEO) potentially operating within 
Cambodian territorial waters.   The U.S. Mission to Cambodia 
is currently supporting a broad, interagency and 
international effort aimed at increasing maritime security 
capacity within the Kingdom of Cambodia.  This project will 
provide fixed and mobile HF radio communications and training 
to establish a functional Coast Watch organization under the 
NCMS thereby establishing a nascent C3 and ISR capability for 
the Cambodians to monitor and secure their maritime domain. 
 
 
--Cambodian Maritime CT ($6.1 m) 
 
Project Description: to build the capacity of Cambodia's 
National Counter Terrorism Special Force (NCTSF) to conduct 
decisive CT operations in the maritime domain by providing 
equipment and training to establish a maritime small boat 
unit capable of conducting direct action in littoral zones 
and inland waterways.  This project will provide 6 x 7m RHiB 
and associated equipment and weapons to establish a coastal 
and inland waterway CT interdiction capability within the 
NCTSF. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Embassy Phnom Penh's proposals are part of a 
regional effort to mount urgent and emergent CT programs in 
several countries.  Embassy Phnom Penh strongly endorses the 
regional 1206 proposals and concurs with the priortization 
agreed to in the working group meeting in August in Bangkok 
(Ref A). 
 
LEAHY VETTING 
------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy Phnom Penh affirms that it is not aware of 
any credible evidence of gross violations of human rights by 
any units which would receive assistance under the 1206 
project proposals listed in para. 1.  Embassy Manila also 
acknowledges the requirement to undertake Leahy vetting for 
all units, if the projects are funded, per normal foreign 
assistance procedures (as requested in para. 11 of Ref B).
