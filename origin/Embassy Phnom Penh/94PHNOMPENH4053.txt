SUBJECT:  HUN SEN'S CURRENT VIEWS 
 
¶1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
¶2.  PROMINENT CAMBODIAN-AMERICAN LEADER SICHAN SIV 
(PROTECT) HAD A ONE-ON-ONE SESSION DECEMBER 6 WITH 
SECOND PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN.  THE PRIME MINISTER WAS 
RELAXED AND DEMONSTRATED A GOOD GRASP OF DETAIL, 
ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE.  HIS PRINCIPAL POINTS WERE AS 
FOLLOWS. 
 
¶3.  RELEASE OF COUP PLOTTER SIN SEN.  THE TWO PRIME 
MINISTERS WERE SIMPLY UNABLE TO SAY NO TO THE KING'S 
REQUEST.  IN ANY CASE, ONLY THE KING HAS THE POWER TO 
PARDON OR REDUCE SENTENCES.  ONE HOPES THAT SIN SEN WILL 
NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL THE APPEAL THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN 
FILED IS HEARD. 
 
¶4.  DEMOCRACY.  RESPONDING TO CONCERN THAT MOVES MAY BE 
AFOOT TO LIMIT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OR OTHER BASIC 
FREEDOMS, THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT DEMOCRACY MUST BE 
ALLOWED TO FLOURISH AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION MAINTAINED. 
 
¶5.  STATE OF THE CPP.  RUMORS OF A SPLIT BEGAN IN 
1985-86.  THEY WERE NOT TRUE THEN, NOR ARE THEY TRUE 
NOW.  IT WAS HE, HUN SEN, WHO HELPED DEVELOP OVER THE 
YEARS AND BRING TO THE FOREFRONT TWO PARTY LEADERS, SAR 
KHENG AND SAY CHHUM, THIS REGARDLESS OF THEIR MARRIAGES 
TO CHEA SIM'S SISTERS. 
 
¶6.  MILITARY SITUATION.  IN GENERAL, IT REMAINS GOOD. 
PHNOM KULEN (ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF PREAH VIHEAR 
PROVINCE) WAS CAPTURED, SIEM REAP PROVINCE IS UNDER 
CONTROL, BATTAMBANG IS NOT SEEING TOO MUCH ACTIVITY, 
KOMPONG THOM IS QUIET, AND KAMPOT IS IN HAND.  THE 
NUMBER OF KR DEFECTORS HAS BECOME QUITE LARGE. 
 
¶7.  RICE.  THE SHORTFALL IS SERIOUS, ESPECIALLY IN THE 
EASTERN PROVINCES.  HE IS TRYING TO PERSUADE FARMERS TO 
PLANT DRY SEASON RICE TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIT. 
 
¶8.  COMMENT.  SIV ADMITTED THAT HE COULD NOT TELL HOW 
GENUINELY SUPPORTIVE HUN SEN WAS OF BASIC FREEDOMS OR 
HOW MUCH HE WAS IN AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE HIS GUEST 
FEEL GOOD.  SIV REMINDED HUN SEN THAT CAMBODIANS ABROAD 
NEED FAR MORE NEWS THAN THE GLOOM AND DOOM CARRIED IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS AND REQUESTED THAT THE RCG MAKE 
AN EFFORT TO GET THE NEWS OUT TO THEM.  HUN SEN PROMISED 
TO MAKE SURE THAT SIV AND OTHERS ARE INFORMED OF 
IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS.
