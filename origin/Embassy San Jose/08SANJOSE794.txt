RESOLUTION ON COMPLIANCE 
 
REF: STATE 101817 
 
¶1. On September 29, we delivered reftel demarche to Carlos 
Cordero in the MFA's Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and 
Organized Crime. On October 1, Cordero confirmed that Costa 
Rica would vote in favor of the U.S. resolution on 
compliance. At that time, the MFA had not made a decision 
regarding co-sponsorship, but Cordero promised to follow up 
when a decision was made. 
 
¶2. We could not reach Cordero again before the October 3 
reporting deadline for an answer on co-sponsorship. However, 
Post will report again as soon as the MFA informs us of its 
decision.
