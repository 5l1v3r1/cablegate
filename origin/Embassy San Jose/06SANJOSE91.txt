¶1.  On January 11, 2006 Representative Dan Burton (R-IN) 
and Ambassador met with key members of the Costa Rican 
Legislative Assembly to discuss the status of ratification 
of the Central America-Dominican Republic-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement (CAFTA-DR).  Rolando Lacle, Chair of the 
Assembly's International Relations and Trade Committee, 
which has responsibility for conducting hearings on the 
agreement, said the most optimistic schedule is that his 
Committee would finish its work prior to ending its tenure 
when the current Assembly is replaced in whole on May 1, 
¶2006.  So far the Committee has heard only from the first 
of 32 witnesses.  Lacle expressed doubt that the current 
Assembly would be able to conduct a first of two required 
ratification votes prior to handing over their seats to the 
new Assembly members (deputies) who will be elected on 
February 5, 2006. 
 
¶2.  Also present at the meeting were Lacle's fellow Social 
Christian Unity Party (PUSC) deputies Liliana Salas, leader 
of the PUSC faction, and Mario Calderon, another PUSC 
deputy.  All appeared to be in agreement on several points 
including that President Pacheco waited too long to send 
CAFTA-DR to the Assembly to start the ratification process, 
and that there is little time left for the Committee to 
progress on this issue.  However, Lacle said he would ensure 
that the Committee, under his leadership, would proceed with 
the hearings when they return after the holiday and election 
break with the goal of concluding its work and conducting a 
Committee vote to send CAFTA-DR to the entire Assembly.  He 
stated that six of the nine Committee members are expected 
to vote in favor of the agreement and send it to the floor 
for a vote, more than simple majority needed to do so. 
 
¶3.  Lacle doubted that there would be sufficient time or 
political will for the Assembly to conduct the first vote 
prior to May 1.  He also talked about the relatively 
cumbersome process that he will have to manage while the 
issue is discused in the Committee.  In these proceedings 
any deputy, even if not a member of the Committee, has the 
right to be present, speak, and ask questions of those 
persons providing testimony before the Committee.  Lacle 
said that time limits are usually not imposed on deputies. 
He noted that if he imposed too strict limitations on debate 
the Constitutional Court could later overturn the 
ratification process, and it would be necessary to start 
over.  This could, therefore, lengthen the Committee 
hearings and put in jeopardy Lacle's goal of completing his 
work prior to leaving office. 
 
¶4.  Referring to other complementary legislation necessary 
for implementing Costa Rica's CAFTA-DR commitments, 
Calderon stated frankly that he did not believe the current 
Administration would deliver these bills to the Assembly. 
Even if it were to do so, there is probably not enough time 
for the Assembly to act. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  The current International Relations and Trade 
Committee's completion of its work prior to May 1 would be 
a very positive step in the ratification process.  However, 
based on Lacle's frank comments, meeting this goal is by no 
means a certainty.  Either way, the bulk of the 
ratification process will be left to the incoming Assembly 
and Administration.  Thus, most of the work involved in the 
ratification and implementation of CAFTA-DR in Costa Rica 
likely will extend well into the second half of 2006, if 
not later. 
 
¶5.  Representative Burton did not clear on this cable.
