FEBRUARY 
 
 
 
¶1.  Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly adjourned for the year on 
December 22 and plans to re-convene on January 18.  The committee 
handling the 14th CAFTA-DR bill-addressing three technical 
intellectual property rights (IPR) corrections that USTR 
requires-closed the final round for accepting amendments.  The bill 
now has over 100 amendments which the committee will evaluate when 
it returns to work. 
 
 
 
¶2.  In early December, opposition parties appeared willing to 
acquiesce to the bill's quick passage.  At the last moment, the 
spirit of cooperation evaporated.  Prospects for final approval of 
the bill in January are dim.  Even if the bill receives the first 
of two general plenary votes during the last week of January, the 
bill will likely be referred to the constitutional court for a 
thirty day review.   Assuming the bill passes constitutional 
review, late February to early March is the likely time frame for 
final passage in the Assembly. 
 
 
 
¶3.  The consequence of the process of the 14th bill dragging on is 
that Costa Rica will delay receiving its 2010 CAFTA-DR preferential 
sugar quota.  Costa Rica lost this CAFTA-DR benefit when it failed 
to pass the bill before December 31 (reftel).
