President Abel Pacheco and Health Minister Rocio Saenz phoned 
Charge September 7 to offer assistance to Hurricane Katrina 
victims.  The offer was for two forms of assistance: 
 
-- a team of nurses (unspecified number), and/or 
-- non-perishable food items, specifically sugar and coffee 
(unspecified amount). 
 
Neither Pacheco or Saenz mentioned whether they could deliver 
the assistance by their own means or whether transport would 
require U.S. assistance.  We believe that U.S. assistance for 
transport would be requested if the USG were to accept the 
Costa Rican offer.
