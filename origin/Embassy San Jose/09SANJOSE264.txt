REF: A. A.STATE 29385 
     ¶B. B.SAN JOSE 186 
 
¶1. (U) On March 31, we delivered Ref A demarche to Randolf 
Coto, head of the MFA's Office of International 
Organizations.  Coto told us that the MFA developed a 
document outlining its support of Kosovar independence when 
the GOCR recognized Kosovo (Ref B).  However, the MFA had not 
given any thought to filing a legal brief with the ICJ.  Coto 
told us that they would consider doing so before the April 17 
deadline. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT:  Given Costa Rica's support for the ICJ and 
its decision to accept whatever the ICJ decided in this case, 
Coto at first seemed reticent to the idea of a brief.  After 
reminding him that the Serbs pushed against changes to the 
resolution, and that legal briefs were the chosen mechanism 
for submitting member countries' views, Coto said the MFA 
would think about it.  We felt, however, that given the MFA's 
small foreign policy staff, Costa Rica may need more 
encouragement to follow through with writing and filing a 
brief before the deadline.  We recommend that USUN follow up 
with the Costa Ricans in New York. END COMMENT.
