¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel talking points on July 29 to MFA 
Deputy Director of External Affairs Linyi Baidal.  Baidal 
thanked us for the information, and said that Costa Rica's 
Mission in New York was prepared to do "whatever necessary to 
prevent the adoption of Libya's proposed language." 
 
¶2. (SBU) MFA Director of External Affairs Alejandro Solano 
also mentioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) ruling 
on PresidentBashir in a presentation to the diplomatic corpson July 23.  Solano clearly rejected the idea of suspending 
the ICC's ruling in regards to President Bashir, and said 
that "justice and peace are not incompatible."  We recommend 
that USUN follow up directly with Costa Rica's UN Mission, as 
much of the MFA her in San Jose is currently preoccupied with 
the ongoing Tuxtla Summit in northern Costa Rica.
