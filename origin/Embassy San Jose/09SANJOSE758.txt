¶1. (U) SUMMARY: With Entry Into Force (EIF) of the Dominican 
Republic - Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) on 
January 1st 2009, the reporting period 2007-2008 is the last in 
which the Caribbean Basin trade programs (CBI/CBERA/CBTPA) figure 
among Costa Rica's trade benefits.  Textile and non-traditional 
agricultural exports have been the principal direct beneficiary 
sectors.  More broadly, the Caribbean Basin trade programs have 
played a key role in the growth of the wider Costa Rican economy 
over the last 25 years through encouragement of an outward-looking 
export orientation and as a springboard for CAFTA ratification and 
implementation.

FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT OVERVIEW 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Costa Rican foreign direct investment (FDI) has increased 
yearly, reaching a peak of USD 2.016 billion in 2008. The U.S. 
continues to make up the dominant share of FDI in Costa Rica, 
accounting for 50 percent in 2007 and 60.4 percent in 2008. Industry 
has been the leading FDI sector in recent years, with 26.6 percent 
in 2008.  The real estate sector followed with 24.3 percent, 
agriculture with 21 percent, tourism with 14 percent and the service 
sector with 6.3 percent.  These relative percentages are accurate 
reflections of historic trends, with the exception of agriculture's 
21 percent, which is largely a single USD 403 million purchase of a 
Costa Rican banana and pineapple producer by the US-based fruit 
exporter Del Monte.

¶4. (U) U.S. individuals and companies have accounted for 56 percent 
of Costa Rica's FDI over the past five years, with a low of 47 
percent in 2006 and a high of 70 percent in 2004.  U.S. investors 
registered a relatively high 60 percent in 2008, followed by Mexico 
(6 percent), Spain (4 percent), El Salvador (3 percent) and 
Switzerland (2 percent).  Canada, Panama, Venezuela, Holland and 
Italy have also been significant contributors to FDI in past years. 
Despite Costa Rica's continued efforts to attract Asian investment, 
which include current Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with 
China, Costa Rica receives very little FDI from the Asian 
countries.

¶6. (U) The investment promotion agency CINDE predicts a roughly 30 
percent drop in FDI in 2009.  The real estate sector and 
manufacturing industry will be the hardest hit.  The service sector, 
on the other hand, continues to attract new companies, growing from 
one company in 1995 to a total of 80 companies and 23,800 employees 
in 2008.  CINDE states that in its three target sectors of 
investment attraction -- Medical Devices, Advanced Manufacturing, 
and Services -- the number of successful investment deals in 2009 
will be the same as in 2008 but the average value per deal will be 
lower.  However, it should be noted that these three very dynamic 
sectors did not directly benefit from the Caribbean Basin trade 
programs.

LARGEST EXPORT CATEGORIES TO U.S. 
--------------------------------- 
¶7. (U) United States International Trade Commission (USITC) 
statistics reveal textiles, tuna and non-traditional agriculture to 
be the major direct beneficiaries of Caribbean Basin trade programs. 
 Non-traditional agriculture has been the stellar performer with a 
plethora of smaller firms and distinct new products.  The tuna 
industry is represented by Sardimar, an innovative exporter based in 
the port town of Puntarenas.  The Costa Rican textile industry has 
been shrinking as many companies relocate to countries with lower 
cost structures.

¶11. (U) The Ministry of Foreign Trade (COMEX) recently compiled a 
list at the request of the US Embassy of companies exporting more 
than twelve thousand dollars per year in the major Caribbean Basin 
trade program categories from Costa Rica to the United States.

IMPACT OF CARIBBEAN BASIN TRADE PROGRAMS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶13. (U) The Caribbean Basin trade programs and their beneficiaries 
have played a broad role in persuading Costa Rica of the wisdom of 
full engagement with the global economy.  During the prolonged 
public debate leading up to CAFTA Entry Into Force (EIF) on January 
1 2009, the non-traditional export companies with Caribbean Basin 
trade program benefits were living examples of the promise of free 
trade and as such served as effective counterarguments to the 
opposition line that CAFTA's benefits were more theoretical than 
practical.  This same philosophy that global trade creates 
opportunities has led Costa Rica to develop a set of institutions 
and national characteristics that have deepened and broadened Costa 
Rica's export diversification and expansion.  These institutions and 
characteristics include the investment promotion agency (CINDE), a 
very competent and aggressive Ministry of Foreign Trade, aggressive 
business chambers, individual export "clusters" that have become 
self-reinforcing, communications and transport infrastructure and an 
education sector eager to prepare workers for market opportunities. 
This diverse collection of internal advocates for global trade 
demonstrates the lasting impact of Costa Rica's graduation from the 
Caribbean Basin trade programs.
