being conducted in coordination with the U.S. National Cancer 
Institute and with funding from the U.S. National Institutes 
of Health.  Dr. Herrero provided detailed information on the 
scope of the trials, the various phases of the Project, and 
the importance of the results obtained to date.  Senator 
Specter and his accompanying physician, Captain Ron Smith, 
asked numerous detailed questions during the hour-long 
meeting.  Senator Specter then toured the sprawling Papagayo 
Resort with the head of the resort's ecological development 
consortium, Mr. Bernardino Rojas, who detailed the resort's 
many efforts to reduce its environmental impact.
