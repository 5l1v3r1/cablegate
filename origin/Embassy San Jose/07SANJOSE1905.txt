SUBJECT: ALDIP ON UNGA THIRD COMMITTEE RESOLUTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 145641 
 
 ¶1. (U) On October 24, PolOff discussed reftel third 
committee issues with Montserrat Vargas Solorzano, Director 
of the Candidacies and United Nations Specialized 
Organizations Section of the MFA; Deyanira Ramirez Salas, 
Director of the International Organizations Section; and 
Viviana Tinoco, Director of the Human Rights Desk of the 
Multilateral Policy Section. 
 
¶2. (U) Pointing to the GOCR's "flawless" record on human 
rights issues, Vargas and Ramirez indicated that the GOCR 
would support any and all motions dealing with human rights, 
with special emphasis on the resolution and issues indicated 
below on paragraphs 3 and 4 regarding "No-Action" motions and 
the draft resolution regarding rape as instrument of state 
policy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As to the "No-Action" motions, Ms. Ramirez (who was 
previously assigned to the GOCR's UN mission in NYC) 
indicated that the GOCR opposes any no-action motion 
presented to prevent debate or vote on any resolution, as 
these motions tend to undermine the UNGA's effectiveness to 
deal with some issues. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In reference to the US-introduced draft resolution 
condemning rape as an instrument of state policy, all three 
interlocutors indicated that the GOCR will not only support 
this resolution but will also co-sponsor the same, provided 
that the wording of the draft resolution remains the same as 
contained under the UNGA 2007 Agenda.
