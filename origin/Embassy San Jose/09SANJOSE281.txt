SUBJECT: DPRK MISSILE LAUNCH: COSTA RICA TENTATIVELY 
SUPPORTS NEW RESOLUTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 32582 
 
Classified By: DCM Peter Brennan for reasons 1.4 (D). 
 
¶1. (C) We delivered reftel on April 3 to outgoing Costa Rican 
Deputy UN Permrep Jairo Hernandez, MFA UN Desk Officer 
Adriana Murillo and MFA Disarmament Chief Carlos Cordero. 
Murillo stated that the GOCR agreed that the launch of any 
North Korean rocket would indeed constitute a violation of 
UNSC Resolution 1718.  She added that Costa Rica is 
tentatively ready to support a new UNSC resolution against 
North Korea, however they would want to wait until a draft 
text was available in order to fully commit. 
 
¶2. (C) Murillo said that Costa Rica is also very interested 
in knowing whether or not the US would be seeking additional 
sanctions against North Korea in the event of a rocket 
launch, or only a condemnation of the launch itself.  She 
stated that they had also been in contact with the Japanese 
Ambassador, who was concerned about the 6-party process and 
the possible strife additional sanctions might involve.  Per 
reftel, we assured the MFA delegation that the US was 
committed to the 6-party process, but was intent on 
responding appropriately to North Korea's actions. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT:  The GOCR takes seriously the topic of 
international disarmament, and views the prospect of a North 
Korean rocket launch as a breach of international agreements. 
 As such, we expect they would support a UNSC response, 
especially if they can influence the text; this has been a 
constant refrain during Costa Rica,s UNSC term.  With the 
entire GOCR shut down the week of April 4-8 for Easter, 
however, we note that obtaining further, immediate response 
if a DPRK launch takes place then, may be difficult.
