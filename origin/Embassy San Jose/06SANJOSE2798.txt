On December 18, poloff discussed ref A talking points with 
Viviana Tinoco of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs UN Area 
Office.  During Third Committee voting in November, Costa 
Rica rejected "no action" motions against country-specific 
human rights resolutions, but later abstained during the 
actual votes on all country-specific human rights 
resolutions (ref B).  This was a reversal from their action 
in 2005, when they voted in favor of country-specific 
resolutions against Iran and Uzbekistan.  The GOCR also 
abstained on the retaliatory motions targeted at the U.S. 
and Canada.  Tinoco said she was unaware of any plans to 
change Costa Rica's abstention votes on country-specific 
resolutions when the general assembly meets to approve 
Third Committee resolutions and decisions this week.
