ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: A. SAN JOSE 0003 
     ¶B. SAN JOSE 0071 
 
¶1. (U) Post requests DoD assistance to provide two 
helicopters to lift 160,000 pounds of construction materials 
which will be used to construct five suspension bridges to 
support indigenous communities in the Talamanca region of 
Costa Rica.  This is an important humanitarian mission, 
supported by, and to be conducted with, the GOCR's National 
Emergency Commission (FEMA equivalent), as well as with the 
involvement of UNICEF.  The lack of safe bridges in this 
remote, mountainous and impoverished region too often results 
in the death of local residents attempting to cross gorges 
and rivers on primitive, homemade bamboo bridges.  In the 
last year, 12 people have died and over 25 have been injured 
at three of the five bridge sites, including children who 
died while trying to get to school.  Bridges are essential in 
this region as most schools, hospitals, and other components 
of the government's social support networks are located 
several hours walking distance from the communities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) This request comes at a time when the GOCR has 
specifically asked for U.S. military assistance for 
humanitarian projects, including last December's MEDRETE (Ref 
A) and bridge survey project (Ref B).  This is a highly 
significant development for a country (and administration) 
traditionally reluctant to be involved with most things 
military.  The Arias government is realizing that targeted 
USG humanitarian and security assistance can help rebuild 
national infrastructure, improve domestic security and law 
enforcement, and address shortcomings in the broken health 
care system, all key objectives of the Arias Administration. 
This humanitarian airlift mission is also consistent with two 
of our four Mission Strategic Plan priorities (investing in 
people and promoting prosperity).  If approved, this mission 
will pave the way for continued humanitarian missions in 
Costa Rica, to the benefit of the people and the credit of 
the U.S. military units involved. 
 
¶3. (U) JTF-B assets have already completed two site surveys 
in preparation of this operation.  OSD approval is needed 
since the bridging material to be lifted is non-DoD and on a 
non-reimbursable basis.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Applications of soft military power such as MEDRETEs 
and humanitarian missions, including providing lift for these 
suspension bridge materials, directly contributes to 
furthering USG policy in the region.  Being a country with no 
military, Costa Rica's new willingness to receive assistance 
from U.S. military assets demonstrates just how far our 
bilateral relations have progressed over the last few years. 
Post assesses that approval of this request will demonstrate 
continued USG commitment to the people of Costa Rica at the 
time when they need it.  Finally, the GOCR will be an equal 
or greater partner in this endeavor and is committed to 
seeing it through to completion.  Post thanks OSD and 
SOUTHCOM for considering this request quickly, and we look 
forward to a favorable response.
