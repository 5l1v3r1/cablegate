REF: STATE 202978 
 
¶1.  The Costa Rican parastatal entity Instituto Costarricense de 
Electricidad (ICE) has monopoly control over all telephonic and 
internet service in the country.  According to an opinion of the 
Attorney General, a private company cannot offer VOIP services to 
third parties on a fee basis without first obtaining a concession 
from the Costa Rican legislature.  Post is unaware if any service 
provider has requested a concession but we do know that none has yet 
been granted. 
 
¶2.  Post has anectdotal evidence that many people within Costa Rica 
currently use two well-known VOIP services.  According to an opinion 
by the Attorney General there is at present no regulation that 
prohibits or regulates users from taking advantage of VOIP services 
in Costa Rica. 
 
¶3.  CAFTA-DR requires that Costa Rica open its telecommunications 
market for internet services which would include opening the market 
to providers of VOIP services.
