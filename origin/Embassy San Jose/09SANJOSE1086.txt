SUBJECT: Costa Rica's Judicial School Requests Curriculum Development 
Assistance 
 
¶1. The director of Costa Rica's Judicial School, Marvin Carvajal, 
contacted Post on November 19 to request USG assistance in 
developing new curriculum for its year-long training for new 
judges.  The USG's top priority in Costa Rica is helping the 
government improve public security, which is negatively impacted by 
large backlogs in the judicial caseload and, at times, poor 
interpretation of the law.  Better training for judges could help 
improve their performance, which would have a positive impact on 
public security in the country.  We recommend that the USG respond 
affirmatively to this request.

A NEW APPROACH TO TEACHING

¶2. Carvajal stated that he would like to make greater use of the 
case study method, but Costa Rica does not have any books of case 
studies or anyone with experience in writing them.  He told us that 
he and his team of judges and Judicial School employees plan to 
begin writing the case study texts in January 2010 with the goal of 
using them within a year.  He would like expert advice and guidance 
before and during the writing process. 
 
 
 
¶3. We assess Costa Rica's Judicial School to be a competent 
professional organization with significant human resources at its 
disposal and considerable influence within the judiciary.  Carvajal 
has coordinated very effectively with Post in the past.

¶4. Post recommends that the USG take advantage of this opportunity 
to not only strengthen the Costa Rican judiciary in general but 
also to address the training issues of concern to the USG. 
Ideally, U.S. consultants would work closely with the Judicial 
School to produce a series of case study books on issues including 
courtroom procedures, intellectual property rights, 
expropriation/confiscation of goods, organized crime, human 
trafficking and narcotics.  If it is not possible to provide 
consultants in country, Carvajal suggested the possibility of DVCs 
with U.S. case study book editors/writers. 
 
 
 
¶5. Post urges relevant bureaus (ECA, INL, and WHA) and the 
Department of Justice-OPDAT to discuss what USG resources might be 
directed to support this project.  From our initial analysis, we 
believe that support for this initiative would have a low cost yet 
significant impact.
