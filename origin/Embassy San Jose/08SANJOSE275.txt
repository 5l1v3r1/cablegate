RENEWAL OF THE 1540 COMMITTEE'S MANDATE 
 
REF: STATE 34968 
 
¶1. (U) On April 9, we delivered reftel's request to Juan 
Salas, of the UNSC desk at the Foreign Policy Division of the 
MFA. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Salas indicated that as the 1540 Committee Chair, 
the GOCR supports the strengthened five-year mandate and does 
not support the Russian draft, in principle.  However, Salas 
said the GOCR believes there is some support for the Russian 
draft from other members.  He provided no further details. 
 
¶3. (U) Salas promised to forward our talking points and 
concerns to the Costa Rican mission in New York.
