¶1. On January 31 we spoke with Viviana Tinoco of the MFA's 
Department of Human Rights and International Law regarding 
Costa Rica's attendance to the Vienna Forum.  We conveyed to 
Tinoco USG concerns that the Vienna Forum should not lead to 
any outcome document calling for commitments or 
recommendations to the UN.  Tinoco told us she would convey 
our concerns to the GOCR embassy in Vienna. 
 
¶2. Tinoco informed us that, in addition to a yet unknown 
member of their embassy in Vienna, the GOCR would send Ana 
Duran, Vice-Minister of Public Security and Governance (who 
is also the Chairman of the Coalition Against Human 
Trafficking). 
 
¶3. We also learned that the Executive Director of Fundacion 
Pan y Amor -a NGO dedicated to rehabilitation of victims of 
trafficking in Costa Rica-, Milena Grillo, would also attend 
the Forum.
