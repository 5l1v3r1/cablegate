¶1. For the record, we delivered reftel demarches to MFA 
Foreign Policy Director Alejandro Solano on February 18, 
following up during a meeting between the Ambassador and FM 
Bruno Stagno (on other issues) on February 19.  To Stagno, we 
noted USG willingness to consider re-engaging in the WCAR 
process was one indicator of the new thrusts in the 
Administration,s foreign policy.  Both Stagno and Solano 
welcomed the initiative, but neither offered a substantive 
response.
