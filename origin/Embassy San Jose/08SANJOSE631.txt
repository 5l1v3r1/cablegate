REF: SECSTATE 80675 
 
¶1. (U) On July 30, we delivered reftel to Antonio Alarcon, 
FonMin's Chief of Staff, who replied that he would ask 
President Arias when he returned soon from a state visit to 
Brazil. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We understand that Arias will be arriving in New 
York on September 21 or 22 for the UNGA.  Post believes that 
Arias will want to participate in high-level meetings of this 
nature.  We are also checking with the GOCR trade ministry, 
COMEX, to solicit their thoughts as to how to shape reftel 
themes into a joint initiative.  We will follow up once we 
receive a definitive response from the MFA and/or input from 
COMEX.
