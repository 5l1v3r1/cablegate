¶2. Non-recurring Items  (50,000) 
 
2581 (ICASS) Savings were realized by eliminating the 
part-time PSC position and by reducing INL office space. 
Please note that we have drastically reduced our ICASS costs 
over the past two years--down from $294,000 in 2004. 
 
¶3. Proposed increase  3,000 
 
1142  Salary increase (actually a pay cut since proposed 
increase includes with-in grade pay increases but is still 
slightly less than inflation rate). 1,800 
 
2156  Travel budget includes $1,000 for in-country travel 
which is necessary to complete end-use-monitoring of INL's 
substantial investments in Costa Rica such as the border 
check-point at Penas Blancas, and Coast Guard stations on 
both coasts, as well as the Academy in Golfito.  The budget 
also includes $1,000 to cover travel expenses for one FSN 
training course and one regional counter-narcotics 
conference.  2,000 
 
2589  Prices we must pay for maintenance and repair of our 
copy machine, other equipment, and miscellaneous services 
have increased due to 14 percent inflation last year.  200
