SUBJECT: COSTA RICA AND GLOBAL MARITIME PARTNERSHIP: MANY 
ELEMENTS ALREADY IN PLACE 
 
REF: STATE 50488 
 
¶1. On June 10, we briefed Director Martin Arias of the Costa 
Rican Coast Guard (SNGC) on the Global Maritime Partnership 
(GMP) initiative.  Arias seemed positive about Costa Rica's 
support of the GMP principles, but will provide us further 
feedback once the GOCR's Ministry of Public Security (MPS), 
the SNGC's parent agency, has reviewed the initiative. 
 
¶2. Arias noted, and Post agrees, that the GOCR already 
supports many, if not all, of the GMP principles as outlined 
in reftel. 
 
¶3. Post notes that the USG has a dynamic maritime 
relationship with the GOCR and the SNGC, including the 
following examples of existing and/or future cooperation: 
 
 -- a Bilateral Maritime Agreement, ratified in 1999 and good 
for 10 years, which is primarily counternarcotics focused; 
 
 -- a Search and Rescue (SAR) Memorandum of Agreement, which 
is about to be signed with the GOCR; 
 
 -- plans to bring the USS Swift (HSV) to Costa Rica in 
FY2009 to provide some training to the SNGC (reftel); 
 
 -- Costa Rica's first-ever participation in this year's 
PANAMAX exercise; and 
 
 -- a USCG conducted survey of the SNGC and the GOCR's 
capabilities, practices and port activities, intended to 
assist Costa Rica in the management of its coast guard and 
maritime/port operations. 
 
¶4. Arias asked if there was/would be a website with more 
information on the GMP.  Please advise.
