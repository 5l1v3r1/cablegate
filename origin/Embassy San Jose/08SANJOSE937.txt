REF: A. SECSTATE 123081 
     ¶B. SAN JOSE 129 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered Ref A on November 26 to MFA Deputy 
Director of Foreign Policy Alejandro Solano.  On December 1, 
Solano informed us that Costa Rica typically supported these 
resolutions, while always seeking balanced language and 
balanced responsibilities on behalf of the parties.  He 
admitted, however, that there was an "excessive number of 
resolutions on this subject" and that the politicization of 
the topic of Israel in the UN in no way helped negotiations 
and the "space for dialogue."  Last year, he said, Costa Rica 
abstained on A/62/83 but voted in favor of A/62/80 and 
A/62/81. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Solano reiterated the GOCR's support for:  a 
two-state solution; the work of the Quartet; condemnation of 
terrorist acts in the region; and negotiation of the issues 
of borders, the occupied territories, and the wall. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  We do not expect this demarche to change 
the GOCR's votes, especially given its recognition of the 
"State of Palestine" earlier this year (Ref B).  However, 
Solano's acknowledgment of the excessive number of 
anti-Israeli resolutions and his objection to the 
politicization of the topic seems to signal room to be 
convinced.  We suspect that FonMin Stagno manages this issue 
personally, so more pressing at higher levels might be 
appropriate in this case.  END COMMENT.
