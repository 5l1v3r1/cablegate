REF:  SECSTATE 189518 
 
¶1.  Despite Post efforts to secure Costa Rican support for 
the U.S. position on the UNESCO declaration, and although 
our interlocutors have not been in a position to provide 
specific feedback, it appears that the GOCR does not intend 
to back our position on this issue.   On October 14, 2005, 
Econoff delivered talking points to Vice Minister of 
Foreign Trade Doris Osterlof.  Poloff had previously 
delivered talking points to Edwin Arias, Deputy Director of 
Foreign Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). 
Neither official would express support for the U.S. 
position.  In addition, Post forwarded a letter signed by 
the Charge conveying the content of Secretary Gutierrez's 
letter contained in reftel to Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Roberto Tovar with a copy to Minister of Foreign Trade 
Manuel Gonzalez. 
 
¶2.  The Executive Director of the Costa Rican American 
Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Lynda Solar met with Vice 
Minister Osterlof on October 12, 2005 to discuss concerns 
that businesses have about this issue.  Osterlof did not 
indicate that the GOCR had taken a position.
