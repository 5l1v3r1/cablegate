SUBJECT: COSTA RICA MIGHT SEND OBSERVER TO MAY 2009 PSI 
OUTREACH MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 26136 
 
¶1. On March 19, we delivered reftel invitation on the May 
2009 Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) Outreach meeting 
to Carlos Cordero of the MFA's Department of Disarmament, 
Terrorism, and Crime.  Cordero appreciated the invitation and 
said that an observer from Costa Rica's consulate in Miami 
might attend the May 14 Outreach event, but he would confirm 
for us. 
 
¶2. Cordero added that it was unlikely that Costa Rica would 
endorse the PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles due to 
Costa Rica's concerns about (what he termed) PSI's 
"contradictions" with the Law of the Sea.  He did not 
elaborate further but said that Costa Rica does agree with 
parts of PSI, but probably could not endorse it without 
resolution of these contradictions.
