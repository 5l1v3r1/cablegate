REFERENDUM 
 
REF: 45471 
 
¶1. This message contains an action request -- please see 
paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. Poloff delivered reftel demarche on May 2 to Juan Salas, 
UN Security Council Desk Officer at the MFA. Salas answered 
that Costa Rica supports democratic criteria in general and 
voiced that the situation in Burma involves issues of human 
rights in addition to ensuring a democratic referendum 
process. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Salas also commented that Costa Rica is supporting 
the US draft of a second Presidential Statement. Later in the 
conversation, however, he qualified his statement of support 
by saying that Costa Rica is analyzing the draft, that Costa 
Rica has no problem with its language, and that in general 
Costa Rica is in agreement with it. 
 
¶4. When asked if Costa Rica would be willing to make a 
statement in advance of the May 10 referendum, Salas stated 
that GoCR Ambassador to the UN Jorge Urbina would be the one 
to make such a statement, which would entail a draft, and 
that Salas would talk o Foreign Minister Stagno about doing 
so and woud raise the rest of the talking points further up 
the MFA chain. 
 
¶5. Salas then asked what China' position is on the 
referendum. Poloff relayed reftel points (paragraph 9) 
regarding expressed opposition by Indonesia, Singapore and 
the Phillipines to the drafting and referendum processes, as 
well as the point that China, Russia and some ASEAN members 
are welcoming the referendum as a sign of progress toward 
reconciliation, however flawed and undemocratic it may be. 
 
¶6. Finally, Salas asked specifically what types of sanctions 
the US is considering imposing this week. Please advise what 
our response should be, if any.
