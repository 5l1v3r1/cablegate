     ¶C. SAN JOSE-WHA EMAIL OF 4/30/09 NOTAL 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to Ref A, and further to Refs B-C, MFA 
Director of Foreign Policy (A/S-equivalent) Linyi Baidal 
assured us on April 30 that the MFA had instructed the GOCR's 
IMF and World Bank reps on April 29 to vote in favor of 
Kosovo's IMF and World Bank membership, and to be sure to 
cast their ballot before the May 5 deadline in Washington. 
(The GOCR was closed on May 1 for a national holiday.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Also on April 30, we consulted the local British and 
French embassies as to their demarches in support of Kosovar 
membership, and any GOCR reaction.  The French DCM told us 
they had taken no action, since they had no instructions from 
Paris.  The British DCM reported that he had demarched the 
MFA, receiving the same "Costa Rica will vote for Kosovo 
membership" answer that we had received. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  Coupled with the earlier German demarche 
and positive response (Ref B), these responses make a strong 
case that Costa Rica will vote positively, and in time, for 
Kosovo IMF and World Bank membership.
