REF: 08 USUN NEW YORK 1197 
 
¶1. (U) Costa Rica finished its two-year stint on the United Nations 
Security Council on December 31 disappointed by its inability to 
have a significant impact on the way the body worked.  Costa Rica 
began its turn on the Council with high hopes for improving the 
internal operations of the body.  However, the GOCR left the 
Council with few tangible results to show from its labors. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno has publicly lauded  the 
GOCR's time on the Council as "very active" and having "developed a 
great effort to modify the work methods of the UNSC".  However, he 
privately complained to us that holding a rotating seat on the 
Council was akin to being a "tourist", in that one could see what 
was going on but do little to affect it.  MFA Political Director 
Alejandro Solano observed that rotating members were significantly 
disadvantaged by their lesser knowledge of the way the Council 
operated.  For example, he noted that it took the Costa Rican 
diplomats time to discover that some procedures were simply 
customary rather than mandatory, as permanent members had led them 
to believe.    MFA Chief of Staff Elaine White commented that Costa 
Rica now would have the challenge of trying to remain abreast of 
what was happening in the Council from the outside. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) One aim of the GOCR was to improve fairness and 
transparency in the UNSC, yet it had limited success even with very 
modest proposals.  For example , it advocated for changing 
procedures to allow countries discussed at the UNSC to present 
first, before the UNSC members discussed the issue.  (Solano 
likened  the current procedure to allowing the judges to speak 
before the accused.)  However, this initiative (and others like it) 
did not take hold-only Costa Rica made the change in practice-and 
Solano said they had left it in the hands of the Government of 
Austria, which is also interested in pushing similar reforms. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) White privately told us that the GOCR was a little 
unprepared for the assumption of their seat on the council in 2008 
and faced a steep learning curve, in large part due to the lack of 
any meaningful records from their last turn on the council in the 
1970s.  To correct this for the future, she said they planned to 
publish a report sometime in April summarizing their experiences 
during their two years on the Council, which she promised to 
forward to the Embassy. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  As Minister of Foreign Affairs and UN veteran 
Bruno Stagno knows, reforming the UN is an uphill battle, 
especially for non-permanent members.  While the GOCR might not 
have accomplished all it wished on this front, it did serve as a 
constructive voice on the Council, working especially well with the 
USG on disarmament issues (Ref A).  Costa Rica will now turn its 
sights to securing a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, which 
will allow it to continue to punch above its weight 
internationally.
