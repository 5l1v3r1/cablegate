Classified By: Political/Economic Counselor David E. Henifin for reason 
 1.4(d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  On September 4, we delivered Ref A to the 
MFA's UN Desk Officer Deyanira Ramirez.  Ramirez reiterated 
Costa Rica's commitment to human rights; told us that the 
GOCR opposes all no-action motions; and stressed that Costa 
Rica, as a matter of  principle, did not cosponsor 
country-specific resolutions but may vote in favor of them. 
The MFA also seemed to signal confounding support for the 
Human Rights Council and that more text-tinkering could be 
expected in the upcoming 63rd UNGA Third Committee sessions. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 4, Ramirez affirmed that Costa Rica 
voted "no" to all no-action motions as a matter of principle 
because these motions limited debate.  The GOCR feels 
strongly that debate is necessary to hear all positions. 
 
¶3. (C) In regard to the possible resolutions mentioned in Ref 
A, Ramirez noted that the GOCR voted in favor of past human 
rights resolutions condemning Iran, Burma and North Korea. 
However, she indicated that for this UNGA, Costa Rica would 
wait to see the final versions of the texts and then, if 
possible, would work during negotiations to seek "common 
language."  We responded that we hoped to work in concert 
with the MFA and its New York UN Mission in advance of Third 
Committee proceedings, in consideration of the GOCR's desire 
to be consulted during the drafting (and strategizing) 
process.  We urged dialogue in New York now so as to avoid 
the text-tinkering that delayed action on 
the Prisoner's of Conscience declaration and the Zimbabwe 
sanctions resolution (Refs B and C). 
 
¶4. (C) In a follow-up  on September 11, Ramirez told us that 
she had received instructions to inform us that the GOCR 
remained concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe, Sudan, 
Burma and "other countries where civil liberties are not 
protected" as well as member states that "forget their 
economic, social and cultural obligations."  She stated that 
the GOCR traditionally took a "cautious" approach to 
country-specific resolutions, so as not to sideline the 
"valuable" work that the Human Rights Council performs. 
Ramirez maintained that this "doesn't mean we don't support 
resolutions and don't vote in favor of them when the 
situation merits, but on principle we don't cosponsor these 
types of resolutions." 
 
¶5. (C) Ramirez continued that the theme of "attacks against 
freedom of expression" was important to Costa Rica, but she 
chided the USG for not accepting Costa Rica-proposed language 
on these issues (presumably referring to the Prisoner's of 
Conscience Declaration, Ref B).  Ramirez concluded that the 
GOCR would therefore "wait for open debate" and would try to 
"participate as actively as possible, proposing language that 
Costa Rica considers vital."  She added that depending on the 
final text and the manner in which its proposals are taken 
into account, the GOCR would be open to cosponsoring an 
initiative regarding freedom of expression. 
 
¶6. (C) COMMENT:  The MFA's implicit support for the Human 
Rights Council, as expressed by Ramirez (who made clear she 
was responding on behalf of higher authorities in the MFA) is 
confounding.  FonMin Stagno himself said in last month's 
consultations with Acting A/S Brian Hook (septel) that with 
the HR Council (HRC), the UN had "gotten something worse than 
the Human Rights Commission."  With Ramirez and the whole 
UNSC Team present, Stagno had agreed to re-examine the GOCR's 
"automatic" vote in favor of the HRC's annual report, and 
seemed to take Hook's point that Costa Rica's support was 
"whitewashing" and legitimizing the work of the HRC.  The 
GOCR's desire for open debate and adding its own text 
suggests that Stagno and his team are likely to insist on 
wordsmithing in New York, and not necessarily in accord with 
the USG.  As we have mentioned before, Costa Rica wants to be 
an equal, independent player while it sits on the UNSC, which 
presents a coordination challenge for us in San Jose, but 
even more so in New York. END COMMENT.
