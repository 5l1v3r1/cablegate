SUBJECT: TFGG01: COSTA RICA SUPPORTS DRAFT UNSC RESOLUTION 
ON GEORGIA, BUT BELIEVES IT COULD BE STRONGER 
 
REF: STATE 86130 
 
Classified By: Political/Economic Counselor David E. Henifin for reason 
 1.4(d). 
 
¶1. (C) On August 12, we delivered reftel demarche to Adriana 
Murillo and Juan Salas of the MFA's UNSC team, and to Antonio 
Alarcon, COS to FonMin Bruno Stagno. Alarcon assured us that 
the GOCR supported the resolution, and he understood the 
importance of unified Council action in the face of a likely 
Russian veto.  He was not aware of the latest vote count, 
however.  Alarcon (as is his custom) said he would confer 
with Minister Stagno and get back to us ASAP with any fresh 
information. 
 
¶2.  (C) The MFA working-level response was (typically) more 
caveated.  Murillo told us that "in principle" Costa Rica 
agreed with the second draft version of the French 
resolution, but that the GOCR was waiting to see if and/or 
how the text changed. She and Salas stopped short of making a 
firm commitment to supporting the resolution "as is." Murillo 
cautioned about both sides bandying around words like 
"genocide" -- words that cannot be taken lightly, in her 
view. She confirmed, however, that Costa Rica had pronounced 
publicly that it supported an immediate cease-fire, a return 
to a pre-August 7 status, refugee protection, and protection 
of the civilian population (the latter on the part of the 
Georgians as well as the Russians). Murillo added that if a 
Russian veto of the resolution were certain, then the text 
could be made much stronger, and, in that case, Costa Rica 
would want to offer amendments that would deal primarily with 
protection of civilians above all. Murillo said that the GOCR 
was therefore waiting to see Russia's point of view, and 
asked us to inform the MFA as soon as we knew Russia's 
position. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: We have seen this bifurcated GOCR reaction 
before -- clear support from the MFA front office, but a more 
nuanced approach at lower levels.  Costa Rica seems 
determined to take every opportunity to make its mark on 
Council action, especially when human rights-related issues 
are involved.  Although we are ready to push (again) on the 
GOCR here, USUN may want to lean heavily and soon on the 
Costa Rican Mission in New York to prevent Costa Rican 
perfectionism from becoming an enemy of the good enough in 
this case.
