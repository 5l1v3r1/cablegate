¶1. On February 22 we delivered reftel points to Juan Salas, 
of the FMA UNSC desk.  Salas indicated that he would forward 
the same to their UNSC representative in New York. 
 
¶2. Salas further stated that while not committed at this time 
to the sponsorship of such resolution, the GOCR would in all 
likelihood support one if introduced, a fact that is 
consistent with the GOCR policy on human rights issues.
