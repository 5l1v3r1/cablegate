SUBJECT: EX-PRESIDENT RODRIGUEZ RELEASED FROM HOUSE ARREST 
 
REF: SAN JOSE 646 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. Former President Miguel Angel Rodriguez (1998-2002) was 
released from his seven-month house arrest on October 13, 
when prosecutors in his corruption case failed to convince a 
judge to grant yet another extension of his now nearly 
year-long pretrial detention.  Rodriguez was arrested on 
October 16, 2004, upon his return from the U.S., where he 
resigned as president of the OAS after one month in the 
position.  The corruption charges stem from allegations that 
Rodriguez received kickbacks from French telecommunications 
firm Alcatel during his presidency.  Rodriguez spent five 
months in prison, then in March, 2005, won a small victory by 
being placed under house arrest.  Despite his release, 
Rodriguez is still subject to substantial restrictions 
pending his trial: he cannot leave the country, must appear 
in person at the court every fifteen days, and is prohibited 
from close contact with co-defendants or witnesses in his 
case. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶2. With Rodriguez's release, the only major figure in the 
Alcatel scandal still being held pending corruption 
investigations is Rafael Angel Calderon (1990-1994). 
Calderon has lately mounted a campaign to gain "political 
prisoner" recognition, and will likely intensify his efforts. 
 Given that the evidence against Rodriguez is generally 
considered stronger than that against Calderon, we would 
expect that Calderon will be released on terms similar to 
Rodriguez's in the near future.
