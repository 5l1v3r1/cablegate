Â¶1. On May 12, we delivered reftel demarche to Adriana 
Murillo, Head of the MFA's UN Security Council Team and to 
Juan Salas, of the UNSC Desk. Both seemed unaware that a 
report was due and said that Costa Rica had not yet prepared 
one. They thanked us for the copy of the U.S. report and said 
they would review the 1803 requirements.
