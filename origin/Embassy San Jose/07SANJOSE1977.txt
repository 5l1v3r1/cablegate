REF: STATE 144926 
 
¶1.  Econoffs met with officials of the Costa Rican Ministry of 
Foreign Trade (COMEX) on November 8 to discuss the USG position 
cited in Reftel targeting countries supporting the Latin American 
position advocated by Brazil. Post originally presented the USG 
position to COMEX on October 23 but the CAFTA-DR implementation 
process continues to dominate COMEX's agenda, delaying responses on 
other issues. 
 
 
¶2. COMEX officials state that the GOCR does not support the position 
of Brazil nor does it support the position of the USG.  The position 
of GOCR is between the two positions due to Costa Rica's concerns 
about social fairness.  The Minister of Health, Maria Luisa Avila, 
developed the GOCR position.  COMEX added that the GOCR does not 
consider its position to be counter to the intellectual property 
requirements of FTAs.
