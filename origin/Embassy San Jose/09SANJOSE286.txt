     ¶B. SAN JOSE 281 
 
¶1. (SBU) On April 6 we delivered Ref A to MFA UN Desk Officer 
Adriana Murillo and MFA Disarmament Chief Carlos Cordero. 
The GOCR had no immediate substantive response in addition to 
that expressed in Ref B. 
 
¶2. (U) Post recommends that USUN continue to follow up with 
the GOCR Mission in New York, as virtually all business at 
the MFA in San Jose has come to a standstill due to Holy Week 
vacations, which last from April 6-12.  Any further response 
that post receives will be sent septel.
