Â¶1. (C) On July 2, we delivered reftel demarche to Carlos 
Cordero of the MFA's Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and 
Organized Crime.  Cordero seemed very interested that one of 
the designees was a Venezuelan diplomat.  Because Costa Rica 
had no formal mechanisms to freeze assets for listed 
entities, Cordero said he would pass the information to DIS 
(Costa Rican intelligence) and also to SUGEF and SUGEVAL, 
Costa Rican independent governmental oversight agencies for 
banking and for the stock exchange, respectively.  This 
remains the GOCR's current procedure for handling  terrorism 
finance listings.
