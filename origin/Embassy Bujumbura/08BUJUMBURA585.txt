In separate conversations with the DCM November 20, both 
Ministry of External Relations Permanent Secretary Jean Rigi 
and Ministry of External Relations Chief of Cabinet Godance 
Sindayigaya said that their Ministry viewed the UNGA Third 
Committee resolution concerning Iran "in amity" with U.S. 
views.  As in the past, they said, they expect that Burundi 
will vote against the no-action motion and for the 
substantive resolution criticizing Iran's human rights 
record.  To be absolutely certain that that position hasn't 
changed, however, Sindayigaya said that he would verify his 
understanding with his Minister later on November 20.
