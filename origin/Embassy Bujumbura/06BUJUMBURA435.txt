DECLARATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF BURUNDI REGARDING THE 
IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
 
Following the recent declarations, and particularly the one 
made on Wednesday, May 31 2006 by Madam Condoleezza Rice, 
Secretary of State, the Government of Burundi is pleased to 
 
SIPDIS 
salute and support the positive evolution towards an 
approach that allows to calmly tackle the issue raised by 
the Iranian nuclear program. 
 
The Government of Burundi favorably welcomes the recent 
offers to start direct and constructive dialogue to 
reconcile with all the interests involved and to settle the 
issue by way of negotiation as an agreement needs to be 
honestly negotiated before it is concluded. 
 
As far as Burundi is concerned, needless to stress the 
interest that the Government of a country gradually emerging 
from a more than 10 years' ravaging armed conflict, attaches 
to the pacific resolution of controversies. 
 
The Government of Burundi hopes that those offers will be 
the subject of profound discussions, unite all the points of 
view and will allow progress towards the resolution of the 
delicate issue in lawsuit by way of negotiation. It 
encourages both parties to make good use of the opportunity 
and work in a resolute manner to avoid any attitude able of 
causing prejudice to the peace cause.
