Designation Delivered to MFA 
---------------------------- 
 
¶1.  On January 3, Emboff delivered reftel information on the 
U.S. domestic designation of Iraqi Former Regime Elements 
(FRE) to Mani Bhattarai, Section Officer for UN and 
International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA).  Bhattarai reviewed the information and asked

Central Bank Doubtful Assets in Nepal 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On January 7, Emboff delivered reftel information to 
Narayan Prasad Paudel, Director of Banks and Financial 
Institutions Regulation at Nepal Rastra Bank, the central 
bank of Nepal. Paudel expressed doubt these individuals' 
assets would end up in Nepal.  He asked if post or the 
Department would send the information via official diplomatic 
correspondence to Rastra Bank.  He said he would be unable to 
distribute the information to banks and financial 
institutions without such a formal request.  Post will follow 
up with MFA contacts to address Rastra Bank's unusual 
reluctance to provide assistance.
