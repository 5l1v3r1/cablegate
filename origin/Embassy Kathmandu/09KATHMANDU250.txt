Positive Response to Review 
---------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On March 24, Pradhumna B. Shah, Joint Secretary for 
Europe and the Americas and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
told Emboff that the U.S. intent to redefine its mission in 
Iraq in August 2010 would be a positive step toward bringing 
peace and normalcy to Iraq and its neighbors.  Shah said a 
stable Iraq would serve as an example to Nepal, itself going 
through a period of post-conflict transition.  The Joint 
Secretary expressed curiosity about the details of the U.S. 
strategy to draw down in Iraq, particularly beyond 2010.  He 
also asked whether the U.S. would use a similar strategy in 
Afghanistan.  Emboff drew from talking points provided in 
reftel and promised to share additional information as post 
received it. 
 
Embassy Comment 
--------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Shah implied but did not explicitly state that a 
stable Iraq would benefit Nepal economically by creating more 
jobs for Nepalese migrants.  Remittances are a significant 
part of Nepal's economy, and many Nepalis work in Gulf 
countries.  The Government of Nepal has made employment in 
Iraq illegal for Nepalis because of the poor security 
situation; however, post receives occasional reports of 
Nepalis working there illegally.
