Â¶1. (C) Poloff delivered reftel message on August 7, 2006 to 
Stelios Makriyiannis in the MFA's Division of Asia and 
Africa.  He replied that the Finnish decision was not 
surprising because it was indeed in accordance with the EU 
common position that visas could be issued to Burma cabinet 
members for multilateral meetings.  He provided poloff with 
the text of the common position and said that any time a 
member of the Burmese government was invited to an EU 
multilateral meeting, it was the EU's common intention to use 
that invitation as an opportunity to raise difficult human 
rights questions.
