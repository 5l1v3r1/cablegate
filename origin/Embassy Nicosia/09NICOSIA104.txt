REF: NICOSIA 98 AND OTHERS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Frank C. Urbancic, Reasons 1.4 (b), (d) 
 
¶1.  (U) This message contains an action request; please see 
Paragraph 7. 
 
¶2.  (C) Status of Ship:  No changes since last report -- M/V 
Monchegorsk remains at anchorage in Limassol harbor, under 
maritime police observation.  Conversations with Palace 
officials hint at discord between the RoC, ship's master and 
crew, and ship's owners, mainly over financial costs of 
remaining in Cyprus and/or transit to a third-country (i.e., 
not Syrian) port (Para 6). 
 
¶3.  (C) Diplomatic Activity:  The Ambassador at 0900 hrs 
local (0200 DC) February 5 contacted Presidential Palace 
Diplomatic Coordinator Leonidas Pantelides.  The United 
States regretted the RoC decision to send its unhelpful 
letter to the Iran Sanctions Committee (ISC), he began.  Now 
that the conversations had shifted to New York, however, the 
critical issue on-island was to ensure the Monchegorsk did 
not escape RoC control.  Pantelides assured that Cyprus would 
not allow the ship to depart.  He repeated that the 
government sought UN cover for its actions and wanted to get 
the Monchegorsk and its cargo out of Cyprus, but only by 
putting it "in possession of the UN."  The RoC had been in 
regular contact with Moscow on the matter, and was convinced 
the Russians would support its tack in New York. 
 
¶4.  (C) Pantelides called back at 1300 hrs, a touch frazzled 
and with a completely different message.  "We want to find a 
way through this mess," the Cypriot diplomat insisted, 
admitting the government unlikely would receive the response 
it had sought via its letter to the ISC.  Now Cyprus wanted 
to explore a third-country transfer option, which until this 
conversation, it had dismissed out-of-hand. 
 
¶5.  (C) "Unofficially" and without committing his government, 
Pantelides asked if Malta represented an acceptable venue to 
receive the goods.  France and Italy had been too "high 
profile" for a third-party transfer, he explained. 
Neighboring Malta, however, was tiny, and RoC President 
Demetris Christofias would be comfortable dealing with the 
Maltese.  Pantelides wanted to hear U.S. views on the 
proposal before fleshing it out further, and presented 
Ambassador a broad outline.  Cyprus's thinking entailed 
ordering the ship and cargo to Malta, where the containers 
would be off-loaded.  The Monchegorsk would depart, and the 
Maltese would take appropriate action in accordance with 
UNSCRs 1747 and 1803.  Pantelides did not reveal, however, 
whether he had floated this proposal with Valletta, London or 
Paris. 
 
¶6.  (C) The only local impediment Pantelides saw was a 
possible demand from Monchegorsk's owners, crew or master for 
the RoC to cover transit costs and fees.  He and the 
Ambassador eventually agreed, however, that those figures did 
not appear exorbitant for Cyprus, and that alone should not 
derail this options, if it were found otherwise to be 
workable.  Ambassador committed to report the RoC approach 
back to Washington and later share the USG response, whatever 
it might be. 
 
¶7.  (C) Comment and Action Request:  Without its 
desperately-sought "UN cover," we believe that Cyprus will 
continue to resist with all means available the off-loading 
of the Monchegorsk in Limassol.  We also understand, however, 
that the EU is turning up the heat on the RoC to take action 
in line with EU Common Positions.  Success in Brussels would 
be the best outcome to the Monchegorsk affair.  Short of 
that, we request instructions from Washington on whether to 
encourage the RoC to pursue its Malta proposal (we will 
continue to track and report it regardless).  If this option 
is determined to be workable, it will be imperative to have 
sufficient assets in place to ensure the ship does not break 
and run, as well as assurances from Valletta that it is 
willing and capable to accept the illegal cargo.
