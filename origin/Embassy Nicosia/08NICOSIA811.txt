Classified By: AMB FRANK URBANCIC FOR REASONS 1.5 (B AND D) 
 
¶1.  (C) The Cypriot Department of Energy is planning to 
announce the next round of bidding for offshore oil and gas 
exploration in Cypriot-claimed waters this November.  During 
the first round of bidding in August, 2007, only three of the 
eleven blocs on offer received bids. Subsequently, only Noble 
Energy of Houston proceeded to negotiate an exploration and 
production agreement for a bloc abutting Israel,s EEZ where 
the company currently is operating gas fields with an Israeli 
partner. Noble,s agreement was approved by the ROC Council 
of Ministers in late September 2008 and is expected to be 
signed by the end of October. 
 
¶2. (C) The next round of bidding, expected to take place the 
first half of 2009, will include the blocs contracted for in 
the first round as well as two new blocs at the eastern edge 
of Cyprus, EEZ. The U/S of the Department of Energy tells us 
that the 3D seismic data for these blocs indicates strong 
likelihood of significant liquid deposits. The Commerce 
Ministry believes the poor bidding results in the first round 
were due to Turkish saber rattling. Noble executives told us 
that in September, 2007 they were visited in their Houston 
offices by the Turkish CG in town and told that if they 
proceeded with the bid, the company "could never expect to do 
business with Turkey." Note. The Noble bloc, and all other 
blocs identified by the ROC at this point, are south of 
coastal territory administered by the Turkish Cypriots. End 
Note. 

¶3. (C) On October 8, the President of the Turkish Cypriot 
Chamber of Commerce, during a general conversation with 
econoff, said that he believes that Turkey is very likely to 
again challenge the ROC,s right to proceed with exploiting 
its offshore assets in the absence of an overall settlement 
to the Cyprus problem.  He believes that Turkey will "at 
least send a warship to the area8 as it did in the run-up to 
the first round of bidding.  In November 2007, the  number 
two of the "ruling" Turkish Republican Party (CTP) told 
poloff that T/C leader Talat gave then RoC  President 
Papadopoulos a strongly worded warning regarding the 
consequences of such action at their last meeting on 
September 5, 2007. Last month, another CTP insider told us 
that he hoped that Christofias would not pull anything 
"crazy" like starting off-shore oil and gas exploration. 
Otherwise, he said in all seriousness, Turkey would send the 
&fleet8 down. 
 
¶4. (C) Comment: The G/Cs are aware of Turkish concerns and 
one contact in the Commerce Ministry told us that this is why 
the second round has been delayed until now. She even opined 
that it could be delayed again for fear of affecting the 
reunification talks.  The ROC also wants to avoid another 
bidding round that results in few bids; a possibility if 
Turkey reacts strongly.  Additional fallout from this problem 
is the ROC probably blocking the opening of the Energy 
Chapter in Turkey,s EU accession talks.  The USG (and EU) 
position during the first round of bidding was that the ROC, 
as the recognized government of a sovereign state and a 
signatory to the UN Law of the Sea, has the right to proceed 
with exploring it EEZ. We defer to Embassy Ankara for 
assessment of potential Turkish reactions.
