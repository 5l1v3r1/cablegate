¶1.  On June 2, acting Pol/Econ Chief delivered ref A and B Iran 
demarches to Oleg Anisimov, Second Secretary in the MFA's America's 
Department.    When Anisimov heard Poloff wanted to discuss a new 
U.S. proposal for Iran, he commented that, "your policy will of 
course change for the worse."  He did not provide any substantive 
response to either demarche. 
 
¶2.  Poloff commented that, given the frequent Belarusian public 
statements of support for Iran and its nuclear program (ref D), the 
USG would greatly appreciate being informed of Belarus' official 
policy towards Iran.  Poloff noted that on May 31 Belarusian 
Foreign Minister Sergey Martynov met with Iranian Foreign Minister 
Manouchehr Mottaki in Malaysia, and publicly expressed support for 
Iran's "peaceful" nuclear program, as well as accepted an 
invitation to visit Iran.  Poloff also noted that he had asked for 
the GOB's position on Iran's nuclear program in February (ref c), 
but had never received a response.  Anisimov promised to pass all 
requests to the appropriate officials.
