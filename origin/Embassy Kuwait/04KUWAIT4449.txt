REF: KUWAIT 4132 
 
¶1.  (U)  During Ambassador LeBaron's December 21 courtesy 
call on Shaykh Salem Al-Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, Chairman of 
the National Committee for Missing and POW Affairs (NCMPA), 
NCMPA Director General Rabea Al-Adsani reported that Kuwaiti 
officials recently traveled to Karbala to search for bodies 
from a reported mass grave.  As requested by Iraqi Human 
Rights Minister Bakhtiar Amin during the November Tripartite 
Commission meetings in Geneva, the GOK coordinated this trip 
with the IIG both bilaterally and through the ICRC.  Although 
no remains were found, Al-Adsani described the mission as a 
success due to the joint nature of the effort.  The GOK 
welcomed IIG participation and the chance to demonstrate that 
its exhumation process would not damage the site or impede 
IIG efforts to locate and identify victims of the Saddam 
Hussein regime. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Al-Adsani was also very grateful for U.S. support 
and assistance.  He praised MNF-I Gen. Casey's assistance in 
securing the area and making it possible for the GOK to carry 
out its investigation.  He was also extremely complimentary 
of Baghdad Embassy Officer Greg Kehoe whom he said made it 
possible for IIG officials to travel to Karbala. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Baghdad:  Minimize considered.
