 ¶1. Summary: Kuwait hosted the 51st session of the 
Tripartitite Commission's Technical Subcommittee (TSC) on 
September 5, 2006 with representatives from Iraq, Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait, France, Britain, the International Committee 
for the Red Cross (ICRC), and Embassy Kuwait in attendance. 
The session closed 93 cases, all involving Iraqi remains 
found during a joint assessment mission to Saudi Arabia from 
April 29 to May 2, 2006.  The Kuwaitis noted that no 
investigations into the mass graves sites in Iraq previously 
discussed (reftels) had taken place since the 49th session 
due to security issues.  Kuwait requested the development of 
an action plan by the TSC to allow visits to mass gravesites 
in Iraq to proceed, specifically identifying the need for 
Coalition Forces security assistance.  There was no new 
information on CAPT. Speicher's case. End Summary. 
 
Mass Graves Update 
------------------ 
 
¶2. The 51st session of the TSC was held in Kuwait on 
September 5, 2006.  The Kuwaitis opened the meeting by 
informing the attendees that no assessments or exhumations 
had taken place in Iraq, specifically at Al-Kaffel and 
Al-Madaen in Salman-Pak, in the period since the 49th TSC 
because of security concerns. 
 
Action Plan for Gravesite Visits 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3. The Kuwaitis proposed that TSC members develop, through 
bilateral discussions with the ICRC, a plan of action to 
allow visits to mass gravesites in Iraq to proceed.  The 
Kuwaitis specifically identified the need for security 
assistance from Coalition Forces in Iraq for visits to the 
mass gravesites.  The U.S. delegation noted that any visits 
should be coordinated through the Government of Iraq.

¶4. Iraq said that it had information from the Iraq 
President,s office about human remains in Tel Al-Laham but

which could correspond to the information about Tel Al-Laham. 
 
 
Ramadi/Baghdad/Al-Jahra/Kuwait
