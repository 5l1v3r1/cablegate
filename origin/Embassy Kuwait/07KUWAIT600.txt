SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR SATTERFIELD BRIEFED ON JUNE CONFERENCE 
IN RAS AL KHAIMAH TO PROMOTE SME DEVELOPMENT IN IRAQ 
 
 
¶1.  On 23 April, Iraq Coordinator David Satterfield, 
accompanied by Treasury Department Middle East Deputy 
Director Malachy Nugent, Polcouns, and Econoff, met with 
Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport Company (KGL) Chairman Saeed 
Esmail Dashti to discuss plans for the "Iraq First" 
International Convention for the Development of Small and 
Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to be held in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE 
on 7-8 June, 2007.  Dashti explained that since KGL, a major 
Kuwait-based logistics company with a market capitalization 
of over $1 billion, has done well over the past few years by 
its involvement in Iraq reconstruction, he wanted to give 
back to Iraq by contributing to development efforts, 
especially in the South, by supporting the development of 
SMEs.  Dashti said he initially approached the GOI about his 
proposal but was redirected to the provincial governors, who 
explained that they needed support to foster the growth of 
local entrepreneurs.  KGL subsequently solicited business 
plans and received proposals for 460 projects, which were 
eventually whittled down to 179, mostly focusing on 
manufacturing, construction, and distribution.  KGL then 
approached the IFC, OPIC, and OPIC's SME development agency 
in Iraq, the Iraq Middle Market Development Foundation 
(IMMDF), to enlist their support for the conference.  Dashti 
then approached his friend, Crown Prince Shaykh Saud Bin Saqr 
Al-Qassimi of Ras Al Khaimah, who offered to host.  The 
conference program, which Dashti hopes will bring together 
government officials, investors, and entrepreneurs, includes 
sessions on financing SMEs, management training, the Iraq 
investment climate, and presentations on the project 
proposals that have been submitted.   Dashti said that after 
the conference concludes, he plans to disengage KGL from the 
program. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador Satterfield said the program looked promising 
and offered his support to encourage a strong commitment from 
OPIC and involvement from Embassy Baghdad.  He encouraged 
Dashti to expand the program geographically to include some 
of the central Iraqi provinces, such as Anbar, in addition to 
the South.  Satterfield also urged Dashti to seek the active 
participation of Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister for Economic 
Affairs Barham Saleh. 
 
¶3.  Scans of the program, guest list, and invitation letter 
for the conference were forwarded to the Embassy Baghdad Econ 
Minister-Counselor on 22 April. 
 
¶4.  Ambassador Satterfield cleared this cable.
