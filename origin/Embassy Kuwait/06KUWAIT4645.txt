Dear Mr. Kimmitt, 
 
I received with thanks your kind letter dated November 3, 
2006, concerning the recent meeting of the Preparatory Group 
of the International Compact for Iraq held in Kuwait last 
month.  I am pleased that the meeting was successful and 
achieved a broad-based commitment to this important 
initiative.  I take this opportunity to express my 
appreciation for your support to the work of the Preparatory 
Group, and my gratitude for encouraging the U.N. to keep me 
updated of developments regarding this initiative and 
upcoming meetings of the Group.  I am pleased to inform you 
that an initial agreement was reached by the Arab Fund and 
representatives of the Iraqi Government to solve the arrears 
problem which is a step forward hopefully that both, the Arab 
Fund and the Iraqi Government, can build on it in the 
foreseeable future to solve this matter and resume the Arab 
Fund operations in Iraq.  Once again, I reaffirm my support 
to the compact initiative and to all efforts aiming at 
development and prosperity of Iraq. 
 
With my best personal regards. 
 
Abdelatif Y. Al-Hamad 
Director General/Chairman of the Board of Directors.
