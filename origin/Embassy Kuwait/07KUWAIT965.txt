LIONS CASE 
 
REF: 06 KUWAIT 4452 
 
¶1.  On June 19, Kuwait's highest court, the Court of 
Cassation, commuted the death sentences to life imprisonment 
for four defendants in the Peninsula Lions case.  The 
Peninsula Lions came to prominence in January 2005 following 
armed clashes with Kuwait security forces.  Under Kuwaiti 
law, a life sentence is equal to 25 years of imprisonment. 
 
¶2.  The reduced sentences for Mohammed Saad, Abdullah Saeed, 
Mohammed Essa, and Salah Abdullah were the first decisions by 
the Court of Cassation in the Peninsula Lions case.  The 
Court is reviewing 32 other Peninsula Lions verdicts with 
decisions expected in the near future.  Currently among the 
defendants, there are: 
 
- Six life sentences, 
- Nine sentences greater than ten years, 
- 11 sentences less than four years, and 
- 10 not guilty verdicts.
