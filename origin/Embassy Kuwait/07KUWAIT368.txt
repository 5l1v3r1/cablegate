     ¶B. STATE 29448 
 
¶1.  (U) The Embassy received on March 12 the following letter 
from Mr. Ahmed Osman, Director, Technical Department of the 
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, addressed to 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Kimmitt, concerning the upcoming 
meeting of the Iraq Compact on March 16. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Begin letter (dated March 11, 2007): 
 
Dear Mr. Kimmitt, 
 
Thank you for your letter dated March 5th, 2007, addressed to 
Mr. Abdlatif Y. Al-Hamad, Director General/Chairman of the 
Board of Directors, inviting the Arab Fund to attend the 
upcoming International Compact with Iraq, to be hosted by the 
UN Secretary General on March 16 in New York City.  The Arab 
Fund highly regards the importance of the Iraq meeting. 
However, due to short notice which does not allow making 
travel arrangements, obtaining necessary visas, and because 
of earlier commitments of the related staff members, it is 
regretted that the Arab Fund can not participate in the said 
meeting. 
 
I take this opportunity to wish you every success in your 
endeavors. 
 
Sincerely Yours, 
 
Ahmed Osman 
Director, Technical Department 
 
End Letter.
