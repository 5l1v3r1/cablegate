¶1. (U)  PolOff met Naser Mohammad Al-Ajmi, Secretary General 
of the Higher Committee on Strengthening Moderation (known as 
the Committee for Creating Programs and Plans Responsible for 
Protecting Youth from the Phenomena of Deviant Behavior and 
Religious Extremism until early 2006), on May 9 to discuss 
the committee's activities.  The GOK formed the 
inter-governmental committee with representatives from the 
ministries of Social Affairs and Labor, Interior, Education, 
Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, and Information.  The Ministry of 
Awqaf is the lead agency on the Committee, and announced in a 
March 11 press conference that its new five-year plan 
includes the promotion of moderation as a key goal (ref B). 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Moderation Committee has held two major 
international conferences in Kuwait to support moderation and 
religious tolerance: "Moderation: a Way of Living" in May 
2005 and "We and the Other" in March 2006 (ref A).  Al-Ajmi 
said Kuwait will fund conferences in London in September 
2006, in Washington in December 2006, and in Russia (date to 
be determined), all under the patronage of Amir Shaykh Sabah 
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, to spread the idea of moderate Islam among 
the Islamic community as well as to convey to Westerners that 
Islam is a religion of moderation.  Press reports on May 15 
announced that the conference will be held in London this May 
26-28, but Al-Ajmi told PolOff that the events in May are 
preparatory meetings for the September conference. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The committee has also commissioned several 
studies.  The first of these was set to come out May 13, 
though its official release has been delayed.  PolOff 
received an unofficial draft from Al-Ajmi.  The study 
examines what causes youths to become extremists and includes 
research from several Gulf countries.  Its goal is to help 
find ways of cutting off extremism at its roots.  The 
Committee has undertaken two information campaigns (October 
2005 and April 2006) in Kuwaiti schools to try to steer 
Kuwaiti children away from extremism.  The campaigns received 
extensive press coverage and Al-Ajmi said the response from 
the students was enthusiastic. 
 
¶4.  (U)  This September, the committee will also open the 
World Moderation Center.  Based in Kuwait and headed by 
former Sudanese Minister of Islamic Affairs Esam Ahmad 
Al-Basheer, the center will undertake training, translation 
projects, academic studies and information campaigns, with a 
special emphasis on electronic media, to support moderation 
and fight extremism throughout the Islamic world.
