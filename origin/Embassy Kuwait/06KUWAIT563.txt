¶1.  (U) SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  On February 14, the joint 
State-DOD Avian Influenza (AI) working group (Refs A & B) met 
to discuss the latest developments in the ongoing dialogue 
with GOK Public Authority for Agriculture and Fish Resources 
(PAAFR) officials regarding Kuwaiti concerns about the 
potential for U.S. convoys returning from Iraq to spread AI 
to Kuwait.  According to PAAFR officials, Kuwait will begin 
constructing a roll-through decontamination trough the week 
of February 20 for vehicles at the civilian crossing.  The 
Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) has prepared 
plans for several decontamination scenarios, but will wait 
for an official request from the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense 
(KMOD) before acting, as under the terms of the Defense 
Cooperation Agreement (DCA).  At CFLCC's request, Post 
informed the PAAFR that an official request from KMOD will be 
necessary.  A pandemic influenza (PI) expert from CFLCC will 
arrive in Kuwait in the coming weeks, and Post will enjoin 
him in a meeting with PAAFR, thereafter. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Given the logistical challenge of implementing the 
PAAFR's request, Post has argued against taking action on the 
grounds that disinfecting tires appears to hold no certain 
scientific value and could be ineffective in combating the 
spread of the AI virus.  CFLCC also is not convinced that the 
science supports such a move and that setting a precedent in 
this area may divert resources from other measures that could 
be more effective when dealing with AI.  However, PAAFR 
officials have insisted on decontamination measures.  In 
order to counter the risk of the GOK either taking over 
Coalition Crossing to perform decontamination, or closing the 
border altogether, CFLCC has agreed to begin some measures 
once the logistics can be worked out.  CFLCC is capable of 
beginning decontamination now, although both Post and CFLCC 
are hoping to allay GOK concerns without making substantial 
resource commitments.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
 
¶3.  (U) On February 14, the joint State-DOD AI working group 
(Refs A & B) met to discuss the request by Kuwaiti animal 
health officials that U.S. military convoys crossing into 
Kuwait from Iraq be disinfected.  The initial request was 
made by Dr. Mohammad Al-Muhanna, Deputy Director of Animal 
Resources at the Public Authority for Agriculture and Fish 
Resources (PAAFR), at a meeting on October 31, 2005 (Ref C), 
and repeated at a follow-up meeting on January 22, 2006; U.S. 
military medical officials from CFLCC attended both meetings. 
 The January 22 meeting was also attended by Director of 
Animal Resources Dr. Farida Al-Mulla, whose presence 
testified to the importance that the issue carries for the 
Kuwaitis. 
 
¶4.  (U) At the January 22 meeting, Drs. Al-Muhanna and 
Al-Mulla noted their concern that, with AI now present in 
northern Iraq (Ref D), the virus may already be widespread 
throughout that country but heretofore undetected by Iraq's 
under-resourced public health infrastructure.  Particularly, 
they expressed concern about the virus entering Kuwait on the 
tires of U.S. military and contractors' vehicles. 
Decontamination, they said, could be accomplished either by 
spraying the tires with disinfectant or by constructing a 
roll-through trough. 
 
¶5.  (U) After that January 22 meeting, Post cleared a 
Memorandum of Meeting with CFLCC stating that CFLCC would 
prepare contingency plans for border decontamination, and 
would be prepared to deploy no later than February 15.  Since 
that time, the joint State-DoD working group has met to 
discuss CFLCC's proposed decontamination plans and how best 
to approach the GOK.  Post shares CFLCC's concerns that 
initiating decontamination at the border is an enormous 
logistical and financial undertaking as up to 1000 trucks per 
day make the crossing into Kuwait. 
 
¶6.  (U) On February 14, ESTHoff spoke with Dr. Al-Mulla who 
stated that Kuwait will begin constructing a roll-through 
trough at the civilian border crossing within the next week. 
She also stated that the GOK might build a trough for the 
U.S. military at Coalition Crossing.  In a subsequent 
conversation, ESTHoff conveyed the CFLCC message that an 
official request from KMOD will be necessary before CFLCC 
could begin decontamination. 
 
 
KUWAIT 00000563  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Next Steps:  CFLCC will meet with KMOD on or about 
March 8 to discuss the anticipated request from the PAAFR. 
In the meantime, in order to have U.S. concerns about the 
potential complexity of the eventual decontamination effort 
addressed, CFLCC will communicate through back-channels with 
KMOD before the official KMOD request is presented to CFLCC. 
A CFLCC expert on PI, expected to arrive in Kuwait in the 
next few weeks, will accompany Emboffs to meet with PAAFR 
officials to again argue against decontamination at the 
border.
