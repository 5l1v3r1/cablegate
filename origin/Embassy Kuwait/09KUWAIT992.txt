Cabinet Council, instructed the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society

Disasters Management and Emergency, Kuwaiti Red Crescent

immediately to the northern governorate of Saada and will 
include 11 trucks filled with thousands of tents and 
blankets.  He stated that the Cabinet Council had designated 
no specific aid amount, and that KRCS had chosen the initial
