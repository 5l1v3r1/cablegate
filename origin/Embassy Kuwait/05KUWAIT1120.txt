(U) Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) contacts informed 
Emboffs on March 16 that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) had granted the HOC a last minute reprieve and extended 
its mandate until June 30th, delaying its closure for at 
least three months.  Emboffs contacts could not confirm the 
length of the extension, but reported that the head of the 
HOC, Lieutenant General Ali Al-Mumin, asked the MFA for an 
indefinite extension with quarterly reviews.  Reportedly, 
Ali's request is under consideration by the MFA and they will 
revisit the situation in June 2005.
