We warmly congratulate you and the American people for electing a

the American model of democracy. 
 
The whole world has watched in fascination the finale of this

world looks forward to a new wave of progress in the United States 
of America and in the world. 
 
The positive evolution and the success of the United States of 
America will have an important impact on our country, the Republic

unequivocally return to the space of European civilization.
