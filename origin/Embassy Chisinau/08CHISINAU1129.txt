Excellency, 
 
On behalf of the Moldovan scientific 
community and me personally, I would 
like to congratulate you for the results 
of recent elections held in the United 
States, closely followed by the whole 
world.  The triumph of democratic values 
proved once again that the U.S. is a 
valuable player in the global arena and 
a reliable partner in the race towards 
sustainable development worldwide.  We 
are pleased to acknowledge that an 
important aspect of Barack Obama's 
priorities is the further development of 
science, technology and innovation, 
focusing on synergy in science and 
education.  In this context, I would 
like to reiterate the importance of our 
scientific relations and hope that the 
coming years will bring more 
opportunities for collaboration within 
joint initiatives and projects. 
 
Aspiring to a further fruitful 
collaboration, please accept the 
assurance of our highest consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Gheorghe Duca 
Academician 
President of Academy of Sciences of 
Moldova
