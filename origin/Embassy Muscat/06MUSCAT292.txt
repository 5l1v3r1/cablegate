Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Foreign Minister Bin Alawi joined his GCC colleagues 
on February 24 in denouncing terrorism in Iraq in the wake of 
the Al-Askaria shrine bombing, while Oman's leading Arabic 
dailies also condemned the apparent effort to stoke civil 
war.  Perhaps provoked by an "inappropriate" local Internet 
poll, the Grand Mufti spoke out February 26 calling for 
Muslim unity in Iraq, while denouncing sectarianism and 
intolerance as un-Islamic.  End summary.

FM, Press Speak Out 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Further to our response to ref A and B, requests to 
encourage statements denouncing the February 22 Al-Askaria 
shrine bombing, FM Yusuf bin Alawi joined his GCC colleagues 
following the February 24 meeting with Secretary Rice in 
condemning terrorism in Iraq.  The lead editorials in 
government-owned Arabic daily "Oman" and privately owned 
Arabic daily "al-Watan" that same day also denounced the 
shrine bombing in Samarra as an attempt to unleash a civil 
war in Iraq.

Grand Mufti Weighs In 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Oman's top religious leader, Grand Mufti Shaykh Ahmed 
al-Khalili, spoke to the local press on February 26 further 
denouncing sectarian violence in Iraq.  As carried in most 
local Arabic and English dailies, he stated, "I am very 
concerned with what is happening in Iraq as it may lead to 
civil war and that will surely bring destruction and ruin. 
We call upon all Iraqis, both Shias and Sunni, to come 
together... to set aside differences and stand hand-in-hand. 
I further call upon all Muslims to unite their ranks, as our 
religion teaches us tolerance and fraternity and warns us 
against sectarianism.  Those who bombed the holy shrines in 
Iraq are enemies of Islam because no real Muslim dare commit 
such an act."  The Grand Mufti advocated a meeting of senior 
Iraqi Sunni and Shia clerics to find a means of containing 
the violence.

Inappropriate Poll Pulled 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The Samarra shrine attack inspired an informal poll 
on the local Internet message board "al-Sablah" as to whether 
sectarian violence was possible within Oman.  In two days, 
the poll topic had over 800 hits and 50 responses before the 
website's supervisors closed the topic with the explanation, 
"in light of these sensitive times, it is inappropriate to 
raise these unnecessary questions."  At its closing, 52 
percent of poll respondents thought sectarian violence in 
Oman not likely, while 40 percent took the opposite view.
