¶1.  (SBU) EconOff met with Niels Richter, Director of the 
Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Macroeconomic Policies 
Division (which is responsible for development assistance and 
G-8 cooperation) on November 27, to discuss the points in 
reftel.  Richter will be the primary Danish point of contact 
on all food security queries.  According to Richter, Denmark 
does not consider itself as a core member of the L'Aquila 
Food Security Initiative as its participation in the L'Aquila 
G8 Summit was due only to Danish PM Rasmussen's seeking 
support for climate negotiations leading up to the 
Denmark-hosted UNFCCC COP15 summit in December 2009. 
Denmark, therefore, has not made and does not plan to make a 
specific commitment under the L'Aquila Food Security 
Initiative.  The Danes are following the Initiative's 
development with interest and welcome U.S. leadership on food 
security.  The Danes plan for their resident representative 
to the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome to attend 
the December 3-4 Rome meeting, but do not anticipate making 
any participation pledges. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) To focus its limited development assistance 
resources, Denmark has designated 15 priority countries.  It 
engages in food security assistance in those countries, but 
always in coordination with other donor agencies active there 
and with a growing focus on private sector development to 
ease food delivery bottlenecks.  Denmark may consider close 
coordination with the Initiative in the future in countries 
where it has on-going assistance missions.  Because Rwanda is 
not one of Denmark's priority countries, Richter said there 
will be no Danish representatives at the December 7-8 
meetings in Kigali.  He said there is no possibility of new 
Danish pledges for investment in Rwanda at present.
