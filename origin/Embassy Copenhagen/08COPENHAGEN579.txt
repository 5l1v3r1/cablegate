We shared reftel papers and discussed reftel points on 
October 29 with Jorgen Gammelgaard, MFA Chief Advisor on 
Counter-Terrorism.  Gammelgaard stated that the Danish 
government is unlikely to formally designate EDBI as a 
terrorist entity, but would instead advise Danish firms on an 
informal basis to avoid any dealing with EDBI and its 
affiliates.
