SUBJECT: RISING DANISH CONCERN ABOUT GAZA VIOLENCE 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Danish government and leading politicians 
continue to balance their assessment of the conflict in Gaza 
between assigning clear blame to Hamas and signaling growing 
concerns about the civilian casualties inflicted by the 
Israeli retaliation.   Following a January 6 meeting with the 
parliamentary foreign policy committee, Danish FM Moller 
declared that there is widespread consensus among Danish 
parties to condemn Hamas for provoking hostilities but at the 
same time condemn the "exaggerated" use of military force by 
Israel.  There are differences in focus among the parties, of 
course, with some on the center-right (especially the hawkish 
Danish Peoples' Party) taking a tougher line in support of 
Israel and others in the center-left opposition much more 
critical, but the recent expansion of Israel's offensive has 
begun to shift opinion here across the board in favor of an 
immediate cease-fire. 
 
¶2. (SBU) FM Moller also announced that he will call in the 
Israeli ambassador to register Denmark's displeasure at the 
destruction by Israeli forces in Gaza of three mobile clinics 
provided by a Danish humanitarian organization.   A number of 
Danish aid organizations have urged the government to press 
within the EU for a prompt Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Although Danish police have not been able to tie 
the incident conclusively to the situation in Gaza, a 
December 31 attack on two Israeli merchants in a Danish 
shopping mall has heightened fears of violent actions and 
protests by Denmark's sizable and sometimes volatile 
Palestinian population.  Public demonstrations before the 
Israeli and Egyptian embassies have so far been largely 
peaceful, but Danish authorities remain on alert.
