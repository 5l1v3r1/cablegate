(SBU)  A/DCM delivered reftel demarche February 10 to Julia 
Winding, Section Head in MFA's Human Rights Department 
(Department Head Allan Jacobsen was out of the country). 
Winding indicated in response that Denmark shares the USG 
view and is keen to do its part.  She said Denmark is trying 
to get onto the speakers list for the Universal Periodic 
Review of Iran, but that is proving to be a challenge because 
so many countries are vying for places.
