SUBJECT: DANISH MFA "STILL WORKING" ON FUNDS FOR LEBANON 
TRIBUNAL 
 
REF: STATE 10786 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Danish government continues to wrestle with 
internal bureaucratic questions of how to fund a contribution 
for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (reftel). Danish MFA 
acting Middle East head Steen Norlov and Lebanon desk officer 
Jakob Rogild Jakobsen told us February 6 that the foreign 
ministry supports a contribution, but has so far not been 
able to overcome rules that prevent such contributions from 
being officially counted as "development" assistance. 
Securing funding outside the development budget presents an 
even greater challenge, they said, and so the Danish MFA will 
continue to work the issue, arguing that sustaining Tribunal 
operations directly supports civil society.  The Danes 
welcomed Secretary Rice's note verbale, noting that it should 
prove helpful in advancing their case within the government. 
 
¶2. (SBU) More broadly, the Danish government indicated 
support for the proposed steps outlined in our demarche and 
shared our concerns about the need to shore up the Lebanese 
government.  Jakobsen, who had returned from a visit to 
Lebanon days earlier to review the progress of Danish efforts 
as part of the German-led border monitoring mission, 
described an overwhelming sense of stalemate in Lebanon. 
Jakobsen observed that the status quo favors Hezbollah and 
Aoun, and concluded reluctantly that election of a president 
could be blocked even beyond next year's parliamentary 
elections.
