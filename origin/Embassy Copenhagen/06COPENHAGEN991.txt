REF: COPENHAGEN 986 
 
¶1. (SBU) At an extraordinary weekend session of the Danish 
parliament's foreign policy committee July 22, Danish Foreign 
Minister Per Stig Moeller maintained a firm line against an 
unconditional cease-fire in Lebanon and signaled Danish 
government interest in participating in an eventual 
peacekeeping force there.  Responding to center-left and 
left-wing opposition charges (including that Danish policy 
has become passive and "militarized"), Moeller rejected any 
cease-fire that lacks the support of the parties, stating 
that such a cease-fire "would only mean that Hezbollah would 
regroup and resume its missile attacks on Israel." Moeller 
also put responsibility for the conflict squarely with 
Hezbollah and its supporters, who have "now taken the entire 
population of Lebanon hostage." 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to subsequent press accounts (echoing 
opposition charges) that suggested that the government is 
siding with the U.S. over the UN, the foreign minister took 
the unusual step of issuing a press statement July 24, in 
which he emphasized Danish support for the UN, humanitarian 
efforts and a political process to end the conflict.  At the 
same time, Moeller's statement emphasized, a cease-fire alone 
is not enough to resolve the crisis, which can only be solved 
"when Hamas and Hezbollah are disarmed and recognize Israel's 
right to exist." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Although anxious to portray themselves as 
in step with EU and UN positions, Danish officials have 
staked out a clear and decisive position on Lebanon that 
takes into account the real causes of the conflict and its 
long-term security implications.  The Danish government can 
easily endure the objections of the relatively weak 
opposition.  We can expect that Denmark will continue to be 
an ally on this issue, perhaps even a contributor to whatever 
peacekeeping mission may emerge.
