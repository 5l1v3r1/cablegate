SUBJECT: PROPOSED U.S. STATEMENT ON COMOROS 
 
REF:   ANTANANARIVO 137 
 
¶1. (SBU)  As noted Reftel, the French Government has issued a strong 
statement of support for the Union of the Comoros and a condemnation 
of the illegitimate authorities governing the island of Anjouan.  A 
rough translation follows in Paragraph Two.  This comes in advance 
of French (and U.S.) participation in a multinational Mission to 
deliver an ultimatum to Col. Mohamed Bacar, Anjouan's warlord 
leader.  We recommend the Department issue a similar statement and 
offer a proposed text in Paragraph Three.  The purpose of the 
statement would be to add pressure to the illegitimate authorities 
on Anjouan to relinquish power peacefully and thus to avoid the 
bloodshed that is likely if the Union authorities decide to restore 
their national integrity through military force. 
 
¶2. (U)  Rough translation of French text issued by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs: 
 
France is seriously concerned with the situation in the Comoros.  It 
reiterates its full support to President Sambi and to this latter's 
tireless efforts, with the support of the African Union, South 
Africa and the international community, to maintain the integrity of 
the Union of the Comoros.  France stresses the necessity to preserve 
unity and stability in the Comoros, seriously threatened by the 
behavior of the illegal authorities of Anjouan. 
 
The pressure brought by the African Union on the illegal authorities 
of Anjouan must be reinforced by targeted and coordinated measures. 
They shall have to be made by the UN Security Council, pursuant to 
the request made on February 2nd by the African Union during its 
summit in Addis Ababa, and by the European Union, which is 
finalizing a sanctions measure. 
 
France shall take part in a final mediation mission, the purpose for 
which has been decided by the group of the countries of the region 
during the African Union summit.  We understand that President Sambi 
has accepted the principle of this ultimate mediation, led by South 
Africa with the support of France and the United States and also 
including the Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs as well as the 
African Union Representative, Mr. Madeira.  The nature of France's 
participation shall be determined once the date is determined. 
 
In case this ultimate mission fails, and if they continue to stand 
against the implementation of the requests of the African Union and 
that of the international community, the illegal authorities of 
Anjouan shall assume the consequences of their intransigence. 
 
The authority of the institutions of the Union of the Comoros must 
be restored without any further delay. It is an essential condition 
to ensure stability in the region as well as development for the 
Comoros, which is now jeopardized by this crisis.  End text. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Proposed U.S. text: 
The Government of the United States remains concerned at the ongoing 
impasse in the Comoros between the democratically elected government 
of the Union of the Comoros, led by President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, 
and the illegitimate government on the Comoran island of Anjouan. 
We continue to support the African Union in its effort to achieve a 
peaceful solution to the current crisis in the Comoros.  We call 
again on the illegitimate leadership on the island of Anjouan to 
step aside and allow free and fair elections to be conducted by 
impartial authorities and monitored by the international community. 
In an effort to resolve this conflict without bloodshed, we have 
expressed our willingness to participate in a Mission, to be led by 
the Foreign Minister of the Republic of South Africa, seeking to 
persuade the illegal Anjouanese authorities to step aside.  The 
Mission would also make clear to Anjouan's renegade leadership that 
the international community will hold it responsible for any 
consequences should it refuse to do so. 
End text.
