¶1. (SBU) The de facto GOM has clarified its intention to keep rival 
political leaders from returning to Madagascar after their summit in 
Maputo, Mozambique (reftel A and B).  Minister of Internal Security 
Organes RAKOTOMIHANTARIZAKA issued a note on December 11 listing 25 
individuals who were to be prevented from travelling to Madagascar, 
and then followed up on December 12 with a statement providing 
background to his decision.  Citing "threats to public order and 
internal security", the GOM has barred their return indefinitely, 
pending an eventual "normalization" of the security situation.  In 
our view, the purported "security concerns" behind the ban are 
nothing more than a pretext for ill-advised actions driven by Andry 
"TGV" Rajoelina's hardline supporters, including this minister.  On 
December 15 at 0900, Ambassador Marquardt will join other local COMs 
demarching Rajoelina on this issue.  This follows multiple 
unsuccessful calls over the weekend to senior GOM officials by the 
US, French, and Mauritian (on behalf of SADC) ambassadors seeking 
the get the ban lifted and permit the return of the stranded 
delegations.  Please see reftels A and C for further analysis of the 
current situation.

Minister of Internal Security Rakotomihantarizaka on December 12, 
further explaining the previous document.

Statement 
 
The Minister of Internal Security, also in charge of maintaining 
public security and order, has decided to temporarily deny access to 
the territory of the republic by the delegations of the three 
movements. 
 
We can state without ambiguity that a strongly negative reaction and 
a harsh contestation by the population have surfaced as a result 
of: 
 
¶1. The resolutions signed by the three movements' leaders and 
adopted in Maputo, after the meeting of the delegations and other 
figures in attendance; 
¶2. The letters sent to the United Nations Secretary General and to 
the Prime Minister of Denmark, and signed by the figures from the 
three movements, namely Professor Albert ZAFY and Mr. Fetison RAKOTO 
ANDRIANIRINA, Doctor Emmanuel RAKOTOVAHINY and Mamy RAKOTARIVELO; 
 
These resolutions and letters, in addition to the defamatory 
statements, have respectively been seen by the Malagasy population 
as: 
 
¶1. An act of treason, harmful to Malagasy sovereignty, given that 
any procedure aimed at setting up the people's government should not 
take place outside the Malagasy territory; 
¶2. A serious offense against the nation, considering the two-fold 
unlawful insult to the Malagasy head of state, which, for the 
population, is a violation of Malagasy national pride at the 
international level. 
 
Considering these elements, some individuals have been preparing 
violent reactions of hostility against these factions, which would 
have caused public disorder or even clashes that we must prevent in 
order to protect the republican institutions and preserve public 
order in general. 
 
This measure is absolutely not an action of hostility against the 
individuals affected by the decision, but is part of the normal 
mission of the Ministry of Internal Security, which must prevent any 
action likely to affect public security and order. 
 
We need to point out that this decision is a preventive measure from 
the administrative police and is aimed, on one hand, at ensuring 
serenity and calm in the country as we are moving closer to 
Christmas and New Year, and on the other hand, to preventatively and 
effectively ensure the individual security of each member of the 
delegations of the three factions. 
 
All security measures shall be taken so that we can preventatively 
normalize the security situation for all, eventually allowing for an 
abrogation of this decision.
