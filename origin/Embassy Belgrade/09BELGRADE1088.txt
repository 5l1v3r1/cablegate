¶1.  (SBU) Nebjosa Svjetlica of the Ministry of Defense's 
international cooperation office confirmed to us on September 15 that 
the September 3 explosion at the Prvi Partizan munitions plant (Ref 
A) would have no long-term impact on production as there was no 
damage to production lines or equipment. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On September 17, a U.S. businessman who has several 
contracts with Prvi Partizan confirmed to us that the explosion had 
not damaged any equipment but explained that it had necessitated an 
extensive clean-up.  He expected production to resume at normal 
levels in late September.  (Further details on cause and scope of 
accident in Ref B.)
