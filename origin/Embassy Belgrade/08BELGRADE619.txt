VISIT BY IRAN'S IAEA AMBASSADOR TO BELGRADE 
 
REF: STATE 64530 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 19 we presented the updated P5+1 
Package to the MFA's Section Chief for Iran, 
Iraq, and the Gulf States, Vasilje Petkovic. 
Petkovic said he was encouraged by the extensive 
package.  Simultaneous to our delivery of reftel 
demarche, Iran's Ambassador to the IAEA Ali 
Asghar Soltanieh was in Belgrade on a three day 
visit.  MFA insisted it was not a government 
sponsored visit, though Soltanieh spoke at two 
public institutions in Serbia.  End Summary. 
 
Package is Very Fair 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The P5+1 package was quite extensive, 
fair, and "something Iran should accept," 
Petkovic told us on June 19 upon receiving 
details of reftel demarche.  Serbia was 
supportive of the P5+1 process and would continue 
to be cooperative, Petkovic said.  He said he 
would inform us of any further reaction from 
Serbia to the package. 
 
Serbia-Iran Relations 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Petkovic, the only major 
bilateral issue Serbia and Iran were currently 
discussing was a "Road Traffic Agreement." That 
reciprocal agreement would permit up to 2,000 
Iranian commercial vehicles to transit Serbia 
each year on their way to Western Europe.  That 
agreement, he said, had been initialed by both 
parties but not yet signed. 
 
Visit of Iranian Ambassador Soltanieh 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Petkovic said that the Iranian 
Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) Soltanieh was currently in Belgrade 
for a visit.  Petkovic said to his knowledge 
Soltanieh was not meeting with any officials from 
the Government of Serbia, but instead was 
speaking at local academic institutions. 
Petkovic confirmed on June 20 that Soltanieh had 
not been invited by the Serbian Government, but 
rather his trip had been arranged by the Iranian 
Ambassador to Serbia in coordination with the 
Institute of International Politics and Economics 
(IIPE) in Belgrade.  Soltanieh spoke at 
Belgrade's Faculty for Security Studies on June 
19 and the IIPE on June 20.  The Israeli DCM told 
us on June 20 that his embassy had protested to 
the Dean of the University of Belgrade Faculty 
for Security Studies regarding Soltanieh's visit 
and would convey the same message to the MFA. 
 
Soltanieh Speaks on Iran's Nuclear Program and 
Against U.S. 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
---------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) During his speeches to the University of 
Belgrade and IIPE, Soltanieh gave a presentation 
entitled "Facts on Iran's Peaceful Nuclear 
Program."  (Soltanieh's written statements have 
been sent to ISN and NEA via email.)  In his 
presentations, which were open to both students 
and diplomats, Soltanieh spoke against sanctions 
and against U.S. policy, and said Iran had not 
violated any IAEA accords and was fully 
cooperating.  "Iran is showing resistance against 
those countries that want to limit developing 
countries," Soltanieh said at the IIPE. 
Soltanieh said Iran had received the P5+1 package 
and that it was under consideration.  "All sides 
should come to the negotiating table without 
preconceived conditions," said Soltanieh. 
 
COMMENT

BELGRADE 00000619  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Serbia has been, and remains, 
cooperative on Iran issues.  Though Soltanieh's 
visit appears to be coincidental and not directly 
coordinated with the government, we will 
encourage Serbia to weigh the potential damage to 
the country's international image that this type 
of engagement with Iran may bring. End Comment.
