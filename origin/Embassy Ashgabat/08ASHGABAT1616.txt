SUBJECT:  TURKMENISTAN: STATE MEDIA HIGHLIGHT IFES PRE-ELECTION 
VISIT 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Turkmenistan's state media and some 
international news agencies highlighted U.S. International 
Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) early December visit to 
Turkmenistan.  Although this was a visit that post did not promote 
with state media, the Turkmen government clearly sought to highlight 
this visit as part of an overall focus on promoting the legitimacy 
of the December parliamentary elections.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MEDIA HIGHLIGHT IFES MEETING AT STATE ELECTION COMMISSION 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The December 3 articles on the front pages of state-run 
dailies "Neytralniy Turkmenistan" (Russian, circ. 44,991) and 
"Turkmenistan" (Turkmen, circ. 33,391) highlighted IFES December 2 
meeting at Turkmenistan's Central Election Commission.  The story 
noted that the two IFES visitors talked about their work supporting 
electoral reform in other countries.  In addition, state media 
placed the IFES visit in the context of visits from the UNDP and 
OSCE, which planned to have a limited monitoring role in the 
December 14 parliamentary elections.  Similar articles were posted 
on government website "Turkmenistan Golden Age" (Turkmen, Russian, 
English) and on Russia-based pro-government website 
"Turkmenistan.ru" (Russian, English).  In subsequent days, state 
weeklies "Ahal Durmushy" (Turkmen, circ. 40,091), "Mugallymlar 
Gazeti" (Turkmen, circ. 91,341), "Watan" (Turkmen, circ. 30,091) and 
"Nesli" (Turkmen, circ. 29,000), ran similar stories as state 
dailies, highlighting the meeting.  State print outlets gave 
generally accurate coverage on the meeting. 
 
SMALL RESPONSE IN INTERNATIONAL MEDIA 
 
¶4.  (U)  December 3 Russian "Itar-Tass" (English, Russian) and "RIA 
Orienda", cited Turkmen state media, in similar stories on the IFES 
visit.  Azeri "Trend" (English) news stories from December 3-4 also 
gave coverage of the IFES visit based on state media reports.
