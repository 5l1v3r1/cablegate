Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.    (SBU) During an April 5 meeting in Ashgabat, 
Turkmenistan,s President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov and 
Russia,s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expanded the 
traditional Russian-Turkmenistani state dialog, touching on 
economic cooperation, but focusing a majority of the time on 
"humanitarion," i.e., education cultural and social issues. 
Some token discussions on energy issues and regional politics 
were broached in regard to actively developing economic 
relations, Caspian Sea delimitation and "common approaches" 
regarding diplomatic and peaceful resolutions on Afghanistan 
and Iran, but cultural development took center stage in the 
media and during the Charge's private meeting with Russian 
Ambassador to Turkmenistan Igor Blatov on April 11.  Blatov 
confirmed that Russia saw a new opportunity with the 
Berdimuhammedov administration to develop education and 
cultural cooperation, Russian-language resources, including 
news outlets, and region-to-region cooperation between the 
two countries.  End Summary. 
 
The Lavrov Meeting - Economic Cooperation 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.    (SBU) Turkmenistan's President Gurbanguly 
Berdimuhammedov met with Russia,s Foreign Minister Sergey 
Lavrov, Deputy Foreign Minister Karasin and Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affair,s (MFA) Commonwealth of Independent States 
Department Head Peshkov.  The Russian Foreign Minister also 
met separately with his Turkmenistani counterpart, Rashit 
Meredov, and signed a "Program of Cooperation" between the 
two foreign policy agencies. 
 
¶3.    (U) In his lobby statements following the two meetings, 
Lavrov highlighted economic cooperation: 
 
- Lavrov noted that the two countries would deepen and expand 
trade and economic cooperation and investments.  He said they 
discussed increasing opportunities for revitalizing the work 
of the intergovernmental trade-economic cooperation 
commission, which was discontinued four years ago.  The 
commission is tasked with facilitating cooperation and 
contacts between Russian and Turkmenistani companies. (Note: 
Russian Foreign Minister Fradkov first raised this issue 
during his February 15 meeting with President 
Berdimuhammedov.  End note.) 
 
- Caspian Sea legal status:  Both sides agreed to prepare 
documents on the Caspian Sea status, and the Russian MFA,s 
press release on the same day noted that the two leaders 
discussed the prospect of convening a second Caspian Sea 
summit. 
 
- Lavrov mentioned the two countries, "common approach" in 
working within international organizations, such as the UN 
and OSCE, as well as their "very close approaches" to the 
situation in Afghanistan and the Iranian nuclear program. 
Both countries believe these issues need to be resolved 
through diplomatic and peaceful means. 
 
"Humanitarian" (Education and Culture) Cooperation 
-------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶4.    (U) During an airport interview with Turkmenistani TV 
 
ASHGABAT 00000371  002.4 OF 004 
 
 
before his departure, Lavrov noted the development of 
cooperation in education and culture.  During his state 
visit, Lavrov went to the Russian-Turkmenistani school and 
the Russian Theater, both named after Pushkin.  Both 
countries agreed that the school would be expanded by adding 
a building.  The government-owned daily newspaper &Neutral 
Turkmenistan8 carried an April 11 tender announcement by 
Gazprom,s Ashgabat office for the construction of the school 
building and a kindergarten.  Lavrov said that cultural and 
arts exchanges would be continued, and stressed the 
importance of exchanges between Russia,s regions -- 
specifically Sverdlovsk, Astrakhan and St. Petersburg -- and 
Turkmenistan. 
 
Russian Ambassador Touts Lavrov's Successes 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.    (SBU) Russian Ambassador Igor Blatov described 
Lavrov,s meetings with President Berdimuhammedov and Foreign 
Minister Meredov as "very successful," during an April 11 
meeting with Charge.  He added the following first-hand 
details about the Lavrov meetings: 
 
- De-emphasis on gas: Lavrov did not need to raise the 
subject again, since Prime Minister Fradkov had received 
adequate assurances from Berdimuhammedov during their 
February 15 meeting that the Government of Turkmenistan would 
honor existing gas contracts.  Blatov noted that, "No mature 
relationship can be based just on gas," (Comment:  Though 
Blatov failed to see the humor in the statement.  End 
Comment.). 
 
- Political cooperation: The Russian side expressed its 
desire for more consultation on international relations, 
including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the Caspian Sea, UN and 
OSCE. 
 
- Russian language: Lavrov encouraged preservation of the 
Russian language through additional Russian-language courses 
in schools and increased access to Russian-language news 
sources and professional journals.  Berdimuhammedov agreed to 
re-establish the Russian-language Radio Mayak.  (Comment: The 
station was closed in June 2004, ostensibly for repairs 
according to the Government of Turkmensistan, according to 
Blatov it was closed after airing a broadcast with a negative 
comment about about Turkmenistan,s policies.  End Comment.) 
 
- Education: Berdimuhammedov agreed to Lavrov,s initiative 
to open a "Russian-Turkmen University," that would specialize 
in technical training, in particular in the oil and gas 
spheres. 
 
- Human rights: No human rights issues were raised by Lavrov 
during the meetings, including the status of the Russian 
minority, and Blatov urged the United States to take a 
gradual approach in pressing the new government for reforms. 
Blatov argued that as increasingly more Turkmenistanis travel 
and study abroad and have access to information, "these 
things will take care of themselves." 
 
- State Visit: Lavrov invited Berdimuhammedov to a state 
visit to Moscow, which Blatov thought could occur as early as 
the first week of May. 
 
Astrakhan Governor's Visit 
 
ASHGABAT 00000371  003.4 OF 004 
 
 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6.    (SBU) Blatov also spoke enthusiastically about the 
outcome of the Astrakhan governor,s April 10-11 visit.  The 
delegation met with President Berdimuhammedov and held talks 
with several government agencies. 
 
- Medical exchanges: Astrakhan offered to host Turkmenistani 
specialists at its medical institutes and to send Astrakhan's 
specialists to Turkmenistan to train local specialists. 
 
- Education: Astrakhan will set a generous quota for 
Turkmenistani students to study at Astrakhan,s institutions 
of higher education and vocational schools. 
 
- Shipbuilding: Astrakhan agreed to supply Turkmenistan with 
six new ships - five fishing vessels and one research vessel. 
 
- Transportation: The two sides agreed to open a ferry line 
between Turkmenbashy and Astrakhan for passengers, vehicles 
and cargo.  They also agreed to establish a Turkmenistan 
Airlines and possibly a Russian airline flight between either 
Ashgabat or Turkmenbashy, via Aktau in Kazakhstan, to 
Astrakhan. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.    (SBU) Through de-emphasizing gas cooperation and 
emphasizing a kaleidoscope of new areas for cooperation, 
Russia appears to be remaking its image of a powerful state 
taking advantage of its smaller neighbor,s resources. 
Following Niyazov,s death, many press articles portrayed 
Russia as the neighborhood bully and this visit somewhat 
mollifies that criticism.  Russia may feel it is losing 
ground in Turkmenistan, because Berdimuhammedov has elected 
to talk with a variety of private sector and diplomatic 
players about the possibilities for alternative and 
additional gas pipelines exciting Turkmenistan.  Expanding 
cooperation in the economic and humanitarian spheres is 
intended to re-introduce Russia as an equal partner who is 
genuinely interested in Turkmenistan,s development.  On 
level ground, it is also possible to build a foundation for 
future cooperation in other, more sensitive areas, such as 
the military. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Russia's attempt at "soft diplomacy," never its 
strong point, is significant.  A Danish diplomat resident in 
Moscow told Charge on April 12, that the Russian Government's 
forays into education, culture and health assistance was 
"new."  He considered the development positive in that 
Turkmenistan had the need for this assistance and Moscow had 
the means.  According to this source, Moscow is the "New York 
City" of Central Asia, the great white way of knowledge and 
culture. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) On the eve of the USG education delegation's visit 
to Turkmenistan, embassy recommends a meeting with the 
Russian Embassy both to further learn of Russian 
"humanitarian" plans in Turkmenistan and also to explore 
possible joint programs.  Long-time resident Turkmensitan 
observers, including the local EU-TACIS representative, 
believe this new Russian initiative is a reflection of 
Russia's acknowledgement that it missed the hearts and minds 
boat in Turkmenistan, and that its influence here could wane

if policy remained based on the mercantalist policy of 
relying on gas imports as the basis for a bilateral 
relationship.
