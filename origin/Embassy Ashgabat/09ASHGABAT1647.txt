¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: On December 22, President of the Russian 
Federation Dmitriy Medvedev visited Ashgabat to hold bilateral talks 
with Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov and to attend 
the opening ceremony for the new Turkmen-Russian school.  The modern 
school, built for 800 students, cost $20,790,000 (counting the 
equipment provided to the school, the figure is closer to $22 
million).  The school is the only academic institution in 
Turkmenistan providing classes entirely in Russian.  The Turkmen 
Government considers the school a symbol of friendly relations with 
Russia, but the school is also a symbol of Moscow's commitment to 
supporting Russians and Russian language abroad.  END SUMMARY 
 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ATTENDED SCHOOL OPENING IN ASHGABAT 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Russian state-owned television, on December 22 
President of the Russian Federation Dmitriy Medvedev met with 
President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov to negotiate a 
deal on natural gas and to attend the inauguration of a new building 
of the joint Turkmen-Russian secondary school named after Pushkin. 
The Turkmen press called the school a symbol of strong ties between 
the peoples of two friendly states, and at a Cabinet of Ministers 
session on December 19, President Berdimuhamedov underscored that 
Turkmenistan values its cooperation with Russia, especially in such 
an important area as education. 
 
THE SCHOOL'S HISTORY 
 
¶4. (SBU) Under former President Niyazov's rule, the role of Russian 
language diminished significantly.  In the 1990s the number of 
schools instructing in the Russian language in Turkmenistan was 
reduced by two-thirds.  In 2002 all of the remaining 49 
Russian-Turkmen schools were transformed; the main language of 
instruction became Turkmen, leaving only one Russian language class 
in each of them.  Also in 2002 Turkmen officials initiated an 
education system change that reduced secondary education from ten 
years to nine years.  This change meant that the Turkmen schools no 
longer provided equivalent education to the Russian or international 
school systems.  The Pushkin school became the only school in 
Turkmenistan providing a complete 11-year program, after which 
students could continue their education in Russia. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Pushkin school was established in 2000 on the basis of 
agreements reached between then presidents Vladimir Putin and 
Saparmurat Niyazov.  In January 2002, during  working visit to 
Moscow, former president Niyazov signed an agreement providing the 
legal basis for the school's activity.  According to the director of 
the school in 2007, the school's teachers are experienced local 
professionals, including former university professors.  She also 
said that Russia supplies all study materials to the school. 
Turkmen Government support includes provision of land and utilities. 
 Factoring in the number of ethnic Russians in Turkmenistan, and the 
Russian-speaking and Turkmen population who want quality education 
for their children, the demand for places at the school is extremely 
high.  The school was overcrowded and accommodated 515 students, 
instead of the planned 350, in the old building in Ashgabat's 
Khitrovka neighborhood. 
 
20+ MILLION DOLLAR SCHOOL 
 
¶6. (SBU) As part of his inauguration speech in February 2007, 
Berdimuhamedov announced reforms of the education system and issued 
a decree re-introducing Russian language in all secondary schools. 
In May 2007, Berdimuhamedov and then Russian President Putin 
participated in a ceremony laying the foundation stone of the new 
Pushkin school building.  Russia's gas giant Gazprom funded the 
$20,790,000 construction as well as another $2,000,000 to equip the 
school, intended for 800 students.  The Turkish construction company 
Erku built the new school, now located in one of Ashgabat's elite 
districts on Garashsyzlyk (Independence) Avenue. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The new building is in the shape of a flying pigeon-a

symbol of peace and friendship between Turkmenistan and Russia, 
according to Turkmen state press.  The two three-story wings of the 
building include classrooms, science labs, and a medical center. 
The building's tail houses a pool, a gym equipped with modern 
fitness equipment, an indoor tennis court, an indoor soccer field, 
home economics classrooms with cooking and sewing equipment, and 
metal and wood workshops.  The main section is eight-stories and 
houses the administrative offices, space for a science club, and 
vocational training studios for dance, choir, acting, and sewing. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Several members of the diplomatic community, including the 
children of several Russian-speaking ambassadors, attend the school. 
 One ambassador, whose children attended school in Moscow last year, 
said instruction is not as good as schools in Russia's capital. 
Nevertheless, in his view, Pushkin school is the best school in 
Ashgabat.  It is a public school, and therefore, includes classes 
such as Turkmen language and history as well as some Ruhnama, in the 
curriculum.  Officially, there is no tuition (since it is a public 
school), but families of local students pay several thousands of 
dollars for admittance. 
 
¶9. (SBU) COMMENT: By visiting Ashgabat to open the Russian school, 
Medvedev demonstrated Russia's commitment to supporting Russians and 
Russian language abroad.  The numerous visits and conversations 
between Berdimuhamedov and Medvedev over the course of 2009, 
including three presidential meetings over the last three weeks, 
show Turkmenistan's improved relations with Moscow since the 
pipeline explosion earlier this year.  However, Turkmenistan has 
opened up to many countries willing to invest, and a deal on gas, 
with its economic impact, is more significant for the overall tone 
of the relationship than the opening of a school.  END COMMENT.
