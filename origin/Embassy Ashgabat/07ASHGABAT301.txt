FEBRUARY 
 
REFS:  (A) Ashgabat 215, (B) Ashgabat 216 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) State media gave broad positive coverage on Assistant 
Secretary Richard A. Boucher's meeting with President 
 
SIPDIS 
Berdimuhammedov on February 15, both on state TV and print media. 
However, host government's effort to ban local coverage of A/S 
Boucher's appearance at the Turkmenabat Pedagogical Institute was 
successful.  Host government also stalled on publication of an 
article about the full range of embassy's exchange programs in the 
country.  End Summary. 
 
Omission of Post-Conducted Events on Boucher's Visit 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Regardless of post's efforts to facilitate coverage of 
Assistant Secretary Boucher's February 16 visit to Turkmenabat City 
in Lebap Province, and his press briefing with journalists, state 
media omitted both of the events.  (Comment: Post also sent 
transcripts from both of the events to the state news agency and 
made continuous efforts to coordinate journalists' attendance in 
Turkmenabat through Turkmenistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  End 
Comment.) 
 
Local Journalist Favorably but Inappropriately Presents Article on 
U.S. Exchange Programs 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (U) On February 14, a local journalist from the state daily 
"Neutral Turkmenistan" newspaper (Russian, circ. 34,701) posted an 
article about the embassy's exchange programs on the 
government-owned Russian language website: 
http://www.turkmenistan.gov.tm/ "XXI vek-zolotoy vek Turkmenistana" 
(21 century-golden century of Turkmenistan).  The author favorably 
and accurately used post-supplied background materials.  However, 
the author inappropriately presented the embassy FSN, the 
journalist's point of contact, as if he had given an interview, in 
spite of the fact that post specifically requested that the FSN not 
be cited.  Post requested that any subsequent print version remove 
references to the FSN.  Additionally, post submitted a dipnote to 
support article's publication in state print outlets  - please clear 
up this language, I'm confused by what happened here.  Nevertheless, 
the government is still considering the issue.  (Comment: The 
article was the author's own initiative, but was prompted by the new 
president's support for exchange programs.  End Comment.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In[B1] contrast to other steps towards reform in 
Turkmenistan, there have been no public decrees or pronouncements 
about creating a more open media environment.  Overall, the month of 
February was evidence that old habits continued to prevail.  It is 
noteworthy that events and press coverage thus far in March (septel) 
have provided small but significant signs of greater openness in the 
state-controlled media.  End Comment.
