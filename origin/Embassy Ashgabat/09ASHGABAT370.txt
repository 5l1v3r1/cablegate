SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN: IRANIANS TRAVEL EN MASSE TO ASHGABAT 
FOR NOWRUZ 
 
Classified By: DCM Sylvia Reed Curran. Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (SBU) Hundreds of Iranian tourists from the northern city 
of Mashhad have arrived in Ashgabat to spend part or all of 
the Nowruz holidays.  Most made the 140-mile trip from Iran's 
second largest city by bus as part of one of several 
organized tour groups and are staying at the city's 
moderately-priced hotels. Despite cold and rainy weather for 
much of their stay, they were out shopping and enjoying what 
they reported as very advantageous prices for clothing and 
other goods as compared to Iran.  Iran Watcher chatted with 
several families staying at the Ak Altyn Hotel in Ashgabat 
yesterday:  One family, smiling and relaxed, and reported 
that it was their second time celebrating Nowruz in 
Turkmenistan.  The family members said they particularly 
enjoyed the break from the bustle, traffic, and "pressures" 
of Iran.  With the exception of two elderly women sporting 
headscarves, none of the women in the group were veiled. 
They commented that it was a relief to be free from that and 
other restrictions for a few days. 
 
BORDER HASSLES 
 
¶2. (C) Sepideh, a housewife in her late thirties traveling 
with her husband, mother and two children, said that although 
the road trip from Mashhad to the Bajgyran border took only 
three hours, the Turkmen border authorities had given the 
group "a very hard time" at the border, questioning them and 
checking documents for more than six hours.  Notwithstanding 
that delay (her group reached Bajgyran, 30 kilometers from 
Ashgabat, at 10:30 a.m. last Wednesday, but did not get to 
Ashgabat until five p.m.), she said that she finds Ashgabat 
was a "wonderful" place to celebrate the Iranian New Year. In 
the hotel lobby, her mother and several members of the group 
modeled shoes, cardigans, and other bargains they found on a 
shopping excursion that morning. 
 
VIEWS OF AMERICA 
 
¶3. (C) Vahid, Sepideh's husband, a thoughtful, soft-spoken 
businessman in his mid-forties, said that Iranians were 
"excited and overjoyed" at President Obama's election in 
November, because in their view, the election of an 
African-American to the U.S. presidency was "undeniable 
evidence of the freedom that exists in America."  Although 
Vahid had not yet heard President Obama's Nowruz message as 
they were in Ashgabat when it was broadcast, he had heard of 
it and said that he was hopeful that relations between the 
United States and Iran will improve soon.  He cautioned, 
however, that many people in Iran, while they feel very 
favorable towards the United states, actually oppose a 
warming of relations.  As they see it, he offered, a warming 
now would lend legitimacy to the Iranian regime, and give it 
more "staying power."  He said that Iranians in general favor 
a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.  Likewise, another 
member of the traveling party said that, "90% of Iranians 
love America," noting that "the other 10% don't know anything 
about it." 
 
ELECTION PROSPECTS 
 
¶4. (C) Describing President Ahmadinejad as "universally 
disliked," XXXXXXXXXXXX said that with the announcement that former 
President Khatami had withdrawn his candidacy for the 
presidency, Iranians are now pinning their hopes on former 
Prime Minister Mir Hussein Musavi.  When asked who he expects 
will prevail in the election, however, XXXXXXXXXXXX was less 
certain. He said, "even if Musavi wins the most votes, the 
government could always reverse the results."  He went on to 
note the "great divide between the Iranian people and the 
Iranian government," such as on the requirement for women to 
wear the hijab and on many other social issues. 
 
 
¶5. (C) COMMENT: The visitors we spoke with were warm and 
engaging.  Unlike many Iranians who visit Turkmenistan, they 
appeared unconcerned about the presence of hotel security 
personnel in the vicinity and shared their views openly.  As 
they parted company, they told Iran Watcher of their delight 
at meeting an American who speaks Farsi.  END COMMENT.
