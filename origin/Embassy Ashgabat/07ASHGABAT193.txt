SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN MEDIA MAKES RARE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF U.S 
ASSISTANCE IN CULTURAL PRESERVATION 
 
REF: Embassy Press Releases on 01/19/07 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) The presidential campaign in Turkmenistan overshadowed most 
other news in January.  State media omitted coverage of a working 
visit by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and 
Central Asian Affairs Evan A. Feigenbaum on January 10-14.  However, 
pro-government website TURKMENISTAN.RU published an article on an 
Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation project, giving rare 
credit to the U.S. Government for its support.  End Summary. 
 
STATE MEDIA OMITS FEIGENBAUM'S VISIT, AS EXPECTED 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2.  (U) DAS Feigenbaum's visit to Turkmenistan received no state 
media coverage.  On January 19, newswires Associated Press (English) 
and Dow Jones International News (English) provided coverage on the 
visit based on the embassy's press release posted on January 19. 
(Note: The host government had requested a low profile for 
Feigenbaum's visit. End note.) 
 
STATE MEDIA GIVES POSITIVE COVERAGE OF STATE DEPARTMENT FUNDED 
PROJECT 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Russia based pro-government website TURKMENISTAN.RU 
(English, Russian) published an article on January 23 about the 
completion of restoration activities at the Ak Saray Ding (White 
Palace Tower) monument in Dashoguz.  The article described work 
completed by employees of the Institute of History under the Cabinet 
of Ministers of Turkmenistan, but also mentioned that the U.S. State 
Department financed the project with a grant from Ambassador's Fund 
for Cultural Preservation.  The following day, news agency Times of 
Central Asia (English) reprinted the content of the article.  On 
January 23, state dailies "Neytralniy Turkmenistan" (Russian, circ. 
35,091) and "Turkmenistan" (Turkmen, circ. 28,091) published 
articles with similar content, emphasizing the State Department's 
contribution in the restoration in the lead paragraph.  On January 
25, state weekly "Watan" (Turkmen, circ. 26,091) reprinted the 
article from state dailies. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4.  (U) State media often provides positive coverage of 
post-sponsored cultural events and news, but is not consistent in 
crediting the U.S. Government for its contributions.  The print 
coverage was followed in February by a television broadcast of the 
project activity, but the Miras Cultural Center (under the Ministry 
of Culture) cut out portions of the interview with the project 
manager where she credited the U.S. Government.  When the project 
manager saw the coverage and realized it had been cut, she appealed 
to Miras, but they said they "could not" include it.  (Note:  Post 
believes Miras is simply afraid to stick its neck out by 
highlighting U.S. involvement in its activity, despite the fact that 
the Ministry of Culture has explicitly thanked post for its 
Ambassador's Fund support.  End Note.)  END COMMENT.
