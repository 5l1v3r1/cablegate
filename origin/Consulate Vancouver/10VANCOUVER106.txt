SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #15 
 
¶1. (SBU) The following report provides security-related information 
for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon February 25, 
¶2010. Please visit the following link for additional classified 
reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency U.S. Government (USG) Joint Operations Center 
can be contacted on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U//FOUO//LES) Canadian and USG authorities are currently 
unaware of any specific, credible threats to the Games. Though the 
frequency of organized demonstrations has diminished since February 
15, ad hoc protest activity at event and public locations remains a 
concern. Canadian security officials indicate anti-Olympics groups 
may stage limited demonstrations as the Games draw to a close. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) February 24 Protest Activity - 200 activists reportedly 
attended the "Share the Gold" human chain protest in the Downtown 
East Side yesterday evening. No significant disruption was 
associated with the event. The protest was approximately .5 miles 
from Canada Hockey Place, the nearest Olympic venue. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U//FOUO//LES) Current Protest Activity - An anti-Olympics 
 
demonstration at Grandview Park and subsequent march to the nearby 
Britannia Community Services Centre Rink is scheduled from 3:30 to 
6:30 p.m. February 25. A small number of activists will reportedly 
protest the use of the rink for Olympics practice, though it will 
not likely affect those scheduled.  This demonstration is being 
touted on the militant activist website   
www.no2010.com; however, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and 
Vancouver Police are monitoring the situation and have sufficient 
security measures in place. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U) Additionally, open sources report flash mobs may occur at 
the corner of Georgia and Granville at 5 p.m. and the corner of 
Robson and Granville at 5:30 p.m.  These events are generally 
peaceful in nature but may cause minor traffic disruptions. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (U) Anticipated Protest Activity - Bicyclists and skaters plan 
to participate in a "Critical Mass Bike Ride" departing from the 
Vancouver Art Gallery around 6 p.m. on February 26. This recurring 
event is taking place as regularly scheduled and is not 
anti-Olympics in nature; however, the route is unknown and could 
affect the Men's Hockey Semi-Final game at 6:30 p.m. at Canada 
Hockey Place. Minor traffic disruptions are expected. 
 
 
 
¶7.  (U) A group calling itself "Pirates of Justice," costumed 
advocates of better working conditions for cruise ships employees, 
is advertising a flash mob for 12 p.m. on February 27.  While the 
location is currently undisclosed, previous activity occurred in 
the vicinity of Canada Place (note: this location, along the water, 
is not the same as Canada Hockey Place).  Prior events sponsored by 
this group were festive in nature and not associated with any 
 
significant violence. 
 
 
 
¶8.  (U) A "Games Over! Resistance Lives!" demonstration is 
scheduled to occur from 1 to 3 p.m. on February 28 at the 
intersection of Smithe and Cambie Streets. The event is advertised 
as a "noisy public festival to celebrate our communities and our 
resistance."  This demonstration is being advertised on 
www.no2010.com. 
 
 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶9.  (U//FOUO//LES) The Vancouver Police Department reports various 
incidents involving stolen Olympics tickets later resold for 
profit.  Canadian authorities have arrested several individuals 
since February 20 for suspected dealings in stolen Olympic tickets. 
 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Other than scheduled USOC and team movements, no major 
Olympics-related security operations have transpired during this 
reporting period. 
 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, 
and US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice will visit Vancouver from 
February 25 to March 1.  These VIPs are tentatively scheduled to 
attend ice and speed skating venues, as well as the hockey quarter 
finals and the closing ceremonies. 
 
 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
 
 
¶13.  Public Affairs-The brief detention of a US athlete was 
reported by numerous news sources on February 25,th spurring 
several calls to the Consulate from other media organizations. 
Post has declined comment, citing privacy laws. 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶14.  USOC officials reported that a US bobsledder, named in the 
press, was briefly detained and released the night of 24 February 
for a domestic incident.  Consular assistance was offered, but 
declined by the Amcit. 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
¶15.    Cooler weather and rain have returned to the Vancouver area.
