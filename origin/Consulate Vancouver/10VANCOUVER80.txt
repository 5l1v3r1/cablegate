SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #8 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
on February 18, 2010. Please visit the following link for 
additional classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
Protests: 
 
¶2.  (U) 17 February Protest Activity - A small group of 
demonstrators held a rally in front of St. Marks Church at the 
University of British Colombia (UBC) - some several hundred meters 
from the UBC Thunderbird Arena, an Olympics venue.  The peaceful 
rally, which drew approximately 30 people, was organized by United 
Church of Canada members, UBC Catholic students, Regent College 
evangelical students, and the group "Streams of Justice."  The 
rally was over at approximately 1500 PST.  UBC Thunderbird Arena 
hosts women's ice hockey events, one of which began at 1430 PST 
yesterday. 
 
¶3.  (U) Separately, members of Fathers-4-Justice (F4J) - an 
organization that campaigns against the family law system - 
unfurled a banner on the Lions Gate Bridge during the morning 
commute. Police responded to the F4J activity, which caused only 
minor traffic disruption. 
 
¶4.  (U) Current Protest Activity - There are no Olympics-related 
protests scheduled for today, February 18. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Anticipated Protest Activity - The next demonstration of 
note - a "Rally for National Housing" - is scheduled for noon on 
Saturday, February 20 on the north (Georgia Street) side of the 
 
Vancouver Art Gallery.  Diplomatic Security will continue to 
monitor protest activity and will provide updates as necessary. 
 
Incidents: 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Update: Subject Detained at Opening Ceremonies - On the 
evening of February 12, an individual attempted to enter the 
International Olympic Committee VIP section during Opening 
Ceremonies at BC Place.  The individual reportedly possessed fake 
credentials and was detained by RCMP officers prior to reaching the 
dignitary seating area.  It is not clear to what extent the subject 
used fraudulent accreditation to access the venue or proceed 
within.  According to media reports, the RCMP determined the 
subject - a 48 year-old man - was unarmed, but harbored an 
"infatuation" with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.  RCMP officials 
advised the man was turned over to Vancouver Police custody and 
subsequently admitted to a psychiatric facility. The subject is not 
a known activist and did not appear to have malicious intent.  The 
RCMP reports they do not believe the Vice President was in danger 
at any time during the incident. 
 
Threats: 
 
¶7.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
¶8.  (U//FOUO//LES) Suspicious Call to TSA Operations Center - At 
0945 PST, the DHS/TSA Herndon (VA) Operations Center (TSOC) 
notified Vancouver CBP JOC personnel of a suspicious phone call 
received by TSOC at 0628 EST today, February 18.  The caller 
stated, "Please check your Phoenix to Vancouver flights," and then 
hung up.  The call was traced to a room at a Charlotte, NC Marriott 
hotel.  At this time, the nature and credibility of the call are 
undetermined, but the information is being addressed as a potential 
threat. 
 
¶9.  (U//FOUO//LES) Actions Taken: TSA has notified Phoenix Police 
and the Phoenix Joint Terrorism Task Force.  Through the 
Vancouver-based RCMP Integrated Security Unit, TSA has also 
notified local law enforcement and Transport Canada regarding the 
possibility of the call affecting Canadian carriers.  U.S. law 
enforcement agencies in Phoenix and Charlotte are investigating the 
call alongside the FBI.  The USG Vancouver JOC is also coordinating 
with Phoenix and Charlotte police and FBI offices.  DHS/CBP and 
Vancouver Police are coordinating with CBSA on joint enforcement 
operations for pre-cleared Vancouver to Phoenix flights.  Vancouver 
Police identified four flights into Vancouver and four flights 
departing Vancouver for Phoenix.  TSA is increasing inspection and 
screening activities at Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) International 
Airport. CBP JOC personnel in Vancouver will provide Olympics 
Coordination Center (OCC) in Bellingham, WA with updates and will 
request that the OCC provide updates concerning CBP Phoenix-related 
activity. 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Other than scheduled USOC and team movements, no major 
Olympics-related security operations have transpired during this 
reporting period. 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
¶11. The section received a number of calls from press organizations 
(Globe & Mail, NY Times, Canadian Press) about reports that an 
improperly credentialed person had been able to come within a few 
meters of Vice President Biden during the Games' opening ceremony. 
The section referred all calls to RCMP and the Integrated Security 
Unit. 
 
¶12.  Rumors are making the rounds that President Obama may yet make 
an appearance at the Olympics.  One reporter claims that word is 
making the rounds that a gold medal match between the Canada and 
 
the United States would bring the President to Vancouver.  To those 
calls that we are receiving on this, we are responding with a flat 
'untrue.' 
 
¶13.  Team USA's record medal winning day yesterday drew mention in 
the press, though not nearly as big as in the U.S. 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
¶14.   Nothing significant to report. 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
¶15. Team USA leads the world with 5 Gold and 14 overall medals. 
 
¶16.   Unseasonably warm weather conditions continue in the 
Vancouver area.   A schedule and results of all competitions 
throughout the Games can be found at
