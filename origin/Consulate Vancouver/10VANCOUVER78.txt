SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #7 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
on February 17, 2010. Please visit the following link for 
additional classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
Protests: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Current Protest Activity - United Church of Canada 
members, University of British Columbia Catholic students, Regent 
College evangelical students, and Streams of Justice will stage an 
anti-Olympic march to (UBC) Thunderbird Arena today at noon. The 
march, which is expected to be peaceful, will highlight how the 
Olympics have historically displaced housing for the poor. The 
Thunderbird Arena hosts women's ice hockey events, which begin at 
2:30 p.m. 
 
¶3.  (U//FOUO//LES) Additionally, members of Fathers-4-Justice (F4J) 
- an organization that campaigns against the family law system, had 
planned a stunt demonstration, possibly to climb or chain 
themselves to the Lions Gate Bridge or another bridge in BC's Lower 
Mainland. Previous direct actions by F4J have included scaling the 
New Westminster BC Supreme Court building, the Sapperton SkyTrain 
Station, and the Alex Fraser Bridge. The F4J website states that 
members use non-violent direct actions and civil disobedience to 
attract publicity to their campaign and exert pressure on 
politicians.  As of 0645 PST, DS sources reported local police 
presence on the Lions Gate Bridge. Police were on the scene in 
response to reports F4J activists had unfurled a banner on the 
bridge during the morning rush hour. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Anticipated Protest Activity - No protests are currently 
 
scheduled for 18 or 19 February.  The next demonstration - a "Rally 
for National Housing" - is scheduled for noon on Saturday, February 
20 at the Vancouver Art Gallery.  Diplomatic Security will continue 
to monitor protest activity and will provide updates as they become 
available. 
 
Incidents: 
 
¶5.  (U) LiveCity Yaletown Concert Canceled After Spectator Injuries 
- Open sources report the Alexisonfire concert at the LiveCity 
Yaletown Olympic venue was canceled February 16 after spectator 
injuries resulted from an alleged "rowdy" and "violent" crowd. 
Several Twitter users report that a barricade collapsed and injured 
fans just as the band started to play their concert set.  The venue 
will reopen for events this evening. 
 
Threats: 
 
¶6.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
¶7.  (U//FOUO/LES) Telephonic Threat to Four Seasons Hotel in 
Whistler - The Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigated this 
threat - communicated February 16 - and have attributed it to a 
disgruntled former guest who called from California. The FBI has 
shared information with the RCMP; there appears to be no nexus to 
terrorism and the threat appears to lack substance. 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Other than scheduled USOC and team movements, no major 
Olympics-related security operations have transpired during this 
reporting period. 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
¶9.  Ambassador Jacobson made an appearance on CTV's Canada AM 
television show this morning.  In a live broadcast from Whistler, 
the Ambassador offered positive remarks on the manner in which the 
Games have been conducted, on the displays of Canadian national 
pride and patriotism and on the general spirit of goodwill evident 
in the Games.  Canada AM's estimated audience on 1.6 million 
viewers across Canada.  Also the Ambassador's Olympics blog 
highlighting the enjoyable experience was featured and linked in 
leading national newspaper the Globe and Mail 's political blog. 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
¶10.   Nothing significant to report. 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
¶11.  The US Presidential Delegation to the Closing Ceremony of the 
2010 Winter Olympics will be led by Secretary of the Department of 
Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and include Secretary of the 
Department of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and U.S. 
Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice.
