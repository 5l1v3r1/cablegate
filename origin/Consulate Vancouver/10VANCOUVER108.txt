SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #16 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
February 26, 2010. Please visit the following link for additional 
classified reporting: 
 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency U.S. Government (USG) Joint Operations Center 
can be contacted on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U//FOUO//LES) Canadian and USG authorities are currently 
unaware of any specific, credible threats to the Games. Though the 
frequency of organized demonstrations has diminished since February 
15, ad hoc protest activity at event and public locations remains a 
concern. Canadian security officials indicate anti-Olympics groups 
may stage limited demonstrations as the Games draw to a close. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) February 25 Protest Activity - Yesterday's anti-Olympics 
protest at the Britannia Community Services Centre passed without 
incident. Anticipated "flash mob" activity in downtown Vancouver 
yesterday afternoon failed to materialize. 
 
¶4.  (U) Current Protest Activity - Bicyclists and skaters plan to 
participate in a "Critical Mass Bike Ride" slated to depart from 
the Vancouver Art Gallery around 6 p.m. PST on February 26. This 
recurring, regularly scheduled event is not anti-Olympics in 
nature; however, the route is unknown and could affect the Men's 
Hockey Semi-Final game at 6:30 p.m. at Canada Hockey Place. Minor 
traffic disruptions are expected. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U) Anticipated Protest Activity - A group calling itself 
"Pirates of Justice" - costumed advocates of better working 
conditions for cruise ship employees - is advertising a "flash mob" 
for noon, February 27.  While the specific location is currently 
undisclosed, previous activity occurred in the vicinity of Canada 
Place (note: this location, which includes the Main Press & Media 
Centres, is along the waterfront and is not the same as Canada 
Hockey Place).  Prior events sponsored by this group were festive 
in nature and not associated with property damage or violence. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (U) The anti-homelessness advocacy group Red Tent is staging an 
"Olympic Wrap-Up" demonstration at Canada Pavilion (Dunsmuir and 
Beatty, approximately 2 blocks NE of Canada Hockey Place) at noon 
PST on February 27.  Demonstrators will assemble at Keefer and 
Abbott Streets then move approximately one block west to Canada 
Pavilion.  Activists plan to set up 142 red tarps and use 1700 feet 
of "messaging" to "wrap the entire pavilion" as part of their call 
for an end to homelessness. Protesters are encouraged to bring a 
paintbrush, instruments, and sleeping gear to stay overnight. 
 
 
¶7.  (U) A "Games Over! Resistance Lives!" demonstration is 
scheduled to occur from 1 to 5 p.m. PST on February 28 at the 
intersection of Smithe and Cambie Streets. The event is advertised 
as a "noisy public festival to celebrate our communities and our 
resistance."  This demonstration is being touted on the 
anti-Olympics activist website   
www.no2010.com. 
 
 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶8.  (U)  No Olympics-related security incidents occurred during 
this reporting period. 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Diplomatic Security remains engaged in daily USOC team 
movements. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen 
Sebelius have arrived in Vancouver and will be in town until March 
¶1. US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice will be arriving later today. 
The VIP delegation is scheduled to visit the USA House; attend the 
hockey semi-finals and Gold Medal match at Canada Hockey Place; 
speed skating events at the Richmond Olympic Oval; the Figure 
Skating Gala at Pacific Coliseum; and the Closing Ceremonies. 
 
 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
 
 
¶12.  Public Affairs:  Public Affairs staff assisted Secretary 
Sebelius' team in arranging for Canadian and U.S. media interviews, 
and also took part in the filming of public service announcements 
at USA House.  The announcements will promote healthy lifestyles 
among youth as part of Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' initiative. 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶13.  Nothing significant to report. 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES
