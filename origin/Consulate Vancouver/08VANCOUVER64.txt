SUBJECT: LIBERALS BARELY WIN VANCOUVER-QUADRA BYELECTION 
 
 
¶1. The byelection in Vancouver-Quadra proved to be closer than 
any had predicted, with Liberal Joyce Murray edging out her 
Conservative opponent, Deborah Meredith, by a mere .6 percentage 
points, or 151 votes.  Voter turnout was light with about 34 
percent of registered voters actually showing up to cast ballots 
due to spring break and rainy weather. Although not an outright 
win for the Conservatives, election results showed that the 
Liberals lost significant support in a riding they have held 
solidly since 1984.  During the last election, in 2006, Liberal 
MP Stephen Owen defeated his Conservative opponent by almost 
12,000 votes.  This time around, the Conservatives targeted 
voters in the Chinese community and also were able to swing the 
Jewish vote, traditionally dominated by the Liberals. 
 
¶2. The close election draws in to question the strategies of 
both parties.  While a Conservative operative asserted that the 
Liberal machine was nowhere to be seen in the Quadra campaign, 
the same could be said for the Conservatives.  Prime Minister 
Harper paid a visit to Vancouver just last week but did not do 
any campaigning for Meredith or even meet with her in a public 
venue. One of Meredith's campaign Chairmen told Poloff that they 
had decided not to bring in Harper because any appearance would 
require the Meredith campaign to reimburse a portion of the cost 
of Harper's trip per Canadian election laws.  There was also a 
sense from the campaign that, although it would be close, the 
Liberals would win.  Political pundits had been predicting a 
solid Liberal win since the beginning of the campaign.  But in 
the past few weeks, the tide began to shift.  The Chairman said 
that the phones at Meredith's headquarters were ringing off the 
hook for the past several weeks with inquiries from as far away 
as Asia; this in stark contrast to the early days of the 
campaign last fall when there appeared to be no hope at all for 
a victory in the riding.  Liberal analysts blamed voter apathy 
for the close numbers and the light turnout, noting that a 
byelection is always difficult to predict and that, in the end, 
it is the win that matters. 
 
¶3.  Comment: Despite the Liberal victory, the party has suffered 
a huge loss of support in Quadra.  What was once a given Liberal 
riding can no longer be counted on as a sure thing. The 
Conservatives, on the other hand, have garnered a massive boost 
even in defeat.  They've proven their ability to make huge 
inroads into Liberal territory, and perhaps, with a little more 
effort and coordination with the national party, could even gain 
the prize the next time around. End comment.
