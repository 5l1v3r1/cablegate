¶1.  (SBU) On November 14 EconOffs met with representatives of state 
fixed-line monopoly Ukrtelecom to discuss the November 1 roll out of 
its 3G (third generation) communication services in six major cities 
under the U'tel trademark.  Igor Syrotenko, Ukrtelecom's Deputy 
Chairman for Marketing and Sales, acknowledged launching the project 
was expensive, but stated his company cut costs by building the new 
network using the existing Ukrtelecom infrastructure.  According to 
press reporting, Ukrtelecom already has invested about USD 150 
million in the network and plans to invest an additional USD 146 
million next year.  Costs mainly have been driven by the 600 base 
stations Ukrtelecom plans to put in place across Ukraine's regions 
by the end of this year.  The large number of base stations is 
needed because the technology's high frequency covers only a small 
area. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) When asked about the current subscriber base for 3G 
services, Syrotenko admitted that only about 500 customers had 
signed up since the network was launched two weeks ago.  According 
to public statements made by Ukrtelecom Chairman Georgiy Dzekon, 
Ukrtelecom hopes to add 500,000 new customers within the next two 
years.  Availability of appropriate handsets is a major challenge, 
since only 16 to 20 percent of the handsets for sale in Ukraine can 
use 3G technology.  In addition, Ukrtelecom must get approval from 
the Cabinet of Ministers for its marketing budget, which has been 
difficult to obtain because the Cabinet remains distracted by the 
recent pre-term parliamentary elections (ref A).  An educational 
campaign is planned and Syrotenko said the marketing budget would be 
in the tens of millions of hryvnias (1 USD equals 5.05 hryvnias). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Despite these problems, Ukrtelecom enjoys a monopoly as 
sole provider of 3G services in Ukraine.  (Note:  In 2005 the 
National Communications Regulatory Commission granted Ukrtelecom 
Ukraine's first nationwide 3G license for USD 30 million.  It has 
subsequently denied licenses to Ukrtelecom's competitors - ref B. 
End Note).  Syrotenko told us that Ukrtelecom is in favor of 
competition because it makes the company stronger.  Ukretelecom 
believes that 3G can also compete against existing mobile 
competitors using older standards, since 3G uses the UMTS/WCDMA 
standard, which provides higher quality service, such as fewer 
dropped calls and clearer reception.  According to Syrotenko, 
U'tel's market share could reach 1.5 percent of the entire market. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Lena Minich, U'tel's Director of Marketing and Consumer 
Services, told EconOffs that U'tel is focusing nearly all of its 
marketing efforts on Ukrtelecom's current customer base.  According 
to Minich, U'tel will attract its current fixed line and Internet 
customers by offering bundled services or one-stop shopping.  For 
example, current Ukrtelecom customers who subscribe to U'tel will 
receive special pricing and access to packages such as family and 
friend calling programs and combined services billing.  Minich 
asserted that potential new 3G competitors would not be able to 
compete with Ukrtelecom because they will not have direct access to 
such an enormous customer base. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  It strikes us as a little far-fetched that 
Ukrtelecom hopes to win 3G customers from its existing fixed-line 
customer base, many of whom have never owned a mobile phone, rather 
than target existing cell phone users, the logical first candidates 
to switch to the more expensive and complicated 3G network.  In any 
case Ukrtelecom hopes to use 3G to re-capture a slice of Ukraine's 
UAH 40 billion (USD 8 billion) mobile phone market, and to offset 
losses from its fixed-line business.  Ukrtelecom left the market 
after its mobile subsidiary, UMC, was sold to Russian interests in a 
murky deal under former President Kuchma.  The monopoly desperately 
needs to improve both its image and its profitability if it is to 
finally be privatized, a goal that has eluded the GOU for nearly a 
decade.  Giving Ukrtelecom a 3G monopoly may have been a direct ploy 
to prepare Ukrtelecom for privatization.  Alternatively, the GOU 
might spin off and sell only the 3G subsidiary if it acquires a 
significant market presence.  End comment.
