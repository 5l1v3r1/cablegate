SUBJECT: UKRAINE: NAFTOHAZ REFORMS UNLIKELY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  In meetings with Naftohaz Chairman Oleh 
Dubyna and PM Tymoshenko Energy Advisor Vitaliy Hayduk in 
late September both stated that the structural reform of the 
gas sector was unlikely, even unnecessary.  Dubyna stated 
that he would not support the unbundling of Ukraine's gas 
transit system (GTS), in opposition to promises made to the 
EU in March.  Dubyna told us that Naftohaz already operated 
successfully and pointed to the state-energy company's 
performance during the two-week cutoff of Russian gas 
supplies in January 2009 as evidence that it was able to 
manage the strategic gas transit system effectively.  Hayduk 
stated that there had been no gas crisis in Ukraine at the 
beginning of the year and that Ukraine would be ready for any 
difficulties this winter. He also predicted that gas sector 
reforms would not move ahead in the current political 
climate.  End summary. 
 
BEARISH ON NAFTOHAZ REFORMS 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Naftohaz Chairman Oleh Dubyna was clear about his 
resistance to structural reforms of Naftohaz in a September 
23 meeting.  He stated that Naftohaz already operates in line 
with all EU directives and rejected any attempt to "add, 
subtract, split, or divide" Naftohaz.  Dubyna stated that 
Ukraine had already begun to diversify the natural gas market 
and pointed to a Cabinet of Ministers' resolution from the 
spring that allows certain chemical companies to purchase gas 
directly from Russia.  (Note: Although the resolution was 
passed in April 2009, we have not heard of any chemical 
companies successfully contracting directly with Russian gas 
suppliers.  End note.)  Dubyna also rejected the EU's call to 
"unbundle" the gas transit system (GTS) from Naftohaz.  He 
stated that Naftohaz had proven that the GTS operates 
effectively within the Naftohaz structure, pointing to the 
company's success in reversing the flow of the system for the 
first time in its history during the January 2009 cutoff. 
Unbundling the GTS from Naftohaz would have a negative 
effect. 
 
WAITING FOR DONORS ON GTS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Despite Dubyna's clear rejection of the basic 
commitments made by the GOU to the EU, World Bank, EBRD, and 
EIB at the March 23 Brussels conference on financing for 
modernization of the gas transit system, Dubyna said that 
progress on the financing program was held up because the EU 
and others had not responded to Naftohaz's project proposals, 
commenting that the Europeans found their holidays "more 
important" than the GTS project. (Note: In conversations with 
the World Bank and the EU, it is clear that they have found 
working with Naftohaz on the GTS modernization project 
trying.  Dymtro Glazkov, the World Bank's energy expert, told 
us that the feasibility studies would likely not meet the 
Bank's requirements.  End note.) 
 
"WHO KNOWS WHAT RUSSIA WILL DO" 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Discussing the likelihood of a repeat of the January 
2009 gas crisis, Dubyna stated, "Who knows today what Russia 
will do in the future?"  To counter the possibility of a 
cutoff, Dubyna said that the government decided after the 
2009 cutoff to create a strategic reserve of natural gas. 
Naftohaz has 25 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas in its 
storage facilities already this year, versus 11 bcm at the 
end of 2008.  He commented that Naftohaz had not overcome all 
its difficulties with Russia but believed it would be able to 
resolve outstanding issues.  Dubyna noted that Naftohaz had 
asked Gazprom to lower the 2010 contracted volumes from 52 
bcm to 33.75 bcm by the July 1 deadline in the contract but 
that Gazprom had yet to respond. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In a separate conversation on September 24, Vitaliy 
Hayduk, head of the group of advisors to PM Tymoshenko, 
rejected that there was a gas crisis for Ukraine in 2009.  He 
said that although Russia had shut off gas supplies, Ukraine 
did not have problems as it successfully reversed the flow of 
its gas transit system to supply gas from underground 
storages in the west to consumers in the east.  It would do 
the same this winter if Russia decided to turn off gas 
supplies.  He noted the problem is for Europe, not Ukraine. 
Hayduk repeated what Dubyna told us that Ukraine was even 
better prepared this year, with higher volumes of gas in 
storage. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Hayduk also suggested that there would be no reform 
in Ukraine's energy sector now due to the divide between the 
Rada (Ukraine's parliament) and the government.  He said 
vested interests would ensure that monopolies were not broken 
up, pointing out that government ministers in particular 
would not support changes to the current system that may 
bring about less profitability to their sector.  He thought 
this was true even if the changes represented progress, a 
savings to consumers, or development for the economy in 
general. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment.  Dubyna's comments rejecting calls for 
structural reforms at Naftohaz underline how difficult it 
will be to achieve meaningful reform in Ukraine's gas sector. 
 Absent a clear political decision from the Prime Minister, 
Naftohaz's leadership will not support efforts to divide the 
bloated and inefficient company into more manageable and 
financially viable segments.  If the EU and IFIs take a hard 
line on the conditions of the March 23 Brussels declaration, 
financing for the modernization of Ukraine's GTS will remain 
a pipedream for some time to come.  End comment.
