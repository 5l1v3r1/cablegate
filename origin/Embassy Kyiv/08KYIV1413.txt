 ¶1. (SBU) Summary: Energy Attache received an update on July 
21 from Ukraine's nuclear regulatory officials regarding a 
potential radioactive material smuggling incident (ref B). 
GOU experts have now finished a detailed analysis of the 
seized material and have determined that it is of NO 
proliferation concern.  A criminal investigation against the 
potential smugglers will continue, however.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following up on reports of a potential cesium or 
enriched uranium smuggling incident in Ukraine (refs B-D), 
Energy Attache received an update on July 21 from our 
contacts at the Kyiv Institute of Nuclear Research (KINR) and 
the State Nuclear Regulatory Committee of Ukraine (SNRCU) 
(Please Protect). 
 
¶3. (SBU) The two suspect containers, which had been 
interdicted by the GOU in Cherkassy oblast in early July (ref 
B), were delivered to KINR on July 17 for forensic and 
isotopic analyses of the material.  (Note: DOE has provided 
equipment to KINR to perform such investigations.  End Note.) 
 KINR completed the analyses on July 18 and forwarded its 
report to the SNRCU on July 21.  KINR analyzed only one 
container as both were identical. 
 
¶4. (SBU) KINR's analysis found there to be no Cesium-137 in 
the containers.  Each container contains approximately 200 
milligrams of Uranium Oxide with enrichment of 0.3 percent. 
The material also contains Vitamin B-6.  According to both 
KINR and SNRCU, the material present is of NO CONCERN. 
(Note: The GOU has not yet released these results to the 
public.  End Note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) The containers will be transferred for storage at 
the Kyiv Radon facility once the Cherkasy authorities make 
the transportation and other budget necessities available. 
The ongoing criminal investigation into the would-be 
"smugglers" will continue.  (Comment: It seems likely that 
the suspects were trying to pass off the relatively harmless 
material in the containers as enriched uranium as a 
money-making scam.  End Comment.)
