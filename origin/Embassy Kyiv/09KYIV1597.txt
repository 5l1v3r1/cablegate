¶1. (SBU) Embassy delivered reftel demarche welcoming the UN 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) as an official observer to 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) 
jointly with Russian Embassy counterpart Dmitry Gurin on 
September 11.  Delivery took place shortly after the Russian 
Embassy received its long-awaited instructions from Moscow. 
Head of the Ukrainian MFA's Policy Planning Division Oleh 
Klynchenko expressed thanks for the joint nature of the 
demarche, underscoring U.S.-Russian cooperation and common 
support for the GICNT. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Klynchenko said Ukraine also welcomes the UNODC's 
observer status, and noted that Ukraine has already engaged 
the UNODC on several related initiatives.  The Government of 
Ukraine co-organized a conference for GUAM member states on 
nuclear terrorism in July, 2009, which included three experts 
from each member country (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and 
Moldova), as well as experts from the OSCE, IAEA, Germany and 
France. He noted that the U.S. also sent several 
representatives. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Klynchenko, the UNODC has since 
approached GUAM to organize a workshop on legal aspects of 
combating nuclear terrorism, in particular, questions of 
extradition.  Klynchenko said it is his understanding that 
UNODC is also hoping to work with the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation (BSEC) organization to develop a workshop on 
piracy issues, possibly to be held in Odessa.
