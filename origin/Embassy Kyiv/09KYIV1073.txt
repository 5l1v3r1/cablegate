¶1.  (SBU) On June 22 we delivered reftel points on Delta Air Lines' 
request for authorization to park its aircraft overnight in Kyiv on 
five nights between August 8 and September 6.   SAA Deputy Chairman 
Dmytro Babeichuk stated he would check with SAA Chairman Davydov on 
the proposed consultation dates and the authorization for Delta to 
park its aircraft overnight.  Babeichuk remained insistent that 
overnight parking can be allowed only upon mutual agreement between 
each country's aviation administration and that the GOU would like 
to discuss overnight parking during the consultations.  He 
reiterated the Ukrainian position that the restrictions on Ukrainian 
carrier Aerosvit's operations are not allowed under the agreement's 
parity rules and described the present situation as "deadlock."  He 
said the Ukrainian side does not understand the restriction on 
Ukrainian traffic under American regulations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We stressed that Delta needs an answer as quickly as 
possible in case the airline needed to make adjustments to its 
service and that a negative answer would significantly burden Delta 
and Delta's customers.  We also explained that a negative answer 
would cause the USG to review its options, including those that 
could impact Ukrainian carriers' services in the US.  Babeichuk 
promised to speak with Davydov and give us an answer on both issues 
by June 23.
