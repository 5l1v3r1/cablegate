¶1. (U) Ref A relayed information passed by Ukraine's UN 
mission that Ukraine will vote in favor of the four 
country-specific resolutions in the UNGA Third Committee and 
against any no-action motion.  In ref C, we reported on 
delivery of U.S. points regarding the draft resolution "On 
Condemning the Use of Rape as an Instrument of State Policy." 
 
¶2. (U) With respect to the remaining issues in ref D, we note 
that Ukraine generally supports the EU position in 
international fora.  Thus, Ukraine is likely to vote with the 
EU against the OIC resolution on "defamation of religion" and 
in support of the EU resolution calling for a moratorium on 
the death penalty.  Given Ukraine's recent history and 
success in holding free and fair elections, we also believe 
that Ukraine will support the U.S.-sponsored resolution on 
"Strengthening the Role of the United Nations in Enhancing 
the Effectiveness of the Principle of Periodic and Genuine 
Elections and the Promotion of Democratization."
