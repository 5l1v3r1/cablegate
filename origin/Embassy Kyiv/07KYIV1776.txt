duty orders on hot-rolled steel products from Ukraine 
 
 
Dear Mr. Schutte, 
 
     As to your request of June 21, 2007 to provide information on 
Ukrainian exports of hot-rolled steel products to the U.S., the 
Ministry of Economy has coordinated its efforts together with the 
Ministry of Industrial Policy and Ukrainian producers of the subject 
merchandise to inform you of following. 
 
     The producers of hot-rolled steel products in Ukraine are: OJSC 
"Mariupol Steel Mill named after Illich" and OJSC "Zaporizhsteel." 
 
     All the information regarding your request has been provided 
based on the data of OJSC "Mariupol Steel Mill named after Illich."

     We would also like to mention that it is not possible to 
provide official statistics on export of the relevant products to 
the U.S., because there is no table matching the codes of the U.S. 
HTS and Ukraine's Single Trade Registry of Foreign Trade 
Commodities. 
 
     Considering the fact that the information provided in this 
letter contains data on output and sales of a company, the Ministry 
of Economy requests confidential status for this information 
according to an Administrative Protection Order. 
 
     The Department of Antidumping Investigations and Protection of 
Domestic Market confirms its commitment to future cooperation, 
should you have any questions.

Protection of Domestic Market

¶3. (U) Econoff followed up with Natasha Sydoruk from the Ministry of 
Economy on July 19 to encourage the GOU to provide additional 
information.  Sydoruk, referring to the July 18 letter, said that 
differences between U.S. and Ukrainian descriptions of the relevant 
products made it very difficult for Ukraine to provide data on 
exports of these products.  Sydoruk added that, even with further 
clarification of the products involved, the GOU would not be able to 
provide additional information concerning exports within the 
timeframe necessary to have an impact on the ITC's review.
