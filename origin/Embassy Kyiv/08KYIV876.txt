¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel points regarding upcoming 
elections for the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO) Director General to Elena Shcherbakova, head of the 
International Relations Division at the State Department of 
Intellectual Property (SDIP), on May 6.  Shcherbakova said 
that SDIP, in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and the Ukrainian Mission in Geneva, had 
tentatively identified Ukraine's three preferred candidates 
for the post.  They are: Australia -- Dr. Francis Gurry; 
Japan -- Yo Takagi; and Brazil -- Jose Graca Aranha. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Econoff noted USG agreement on the strong 
credentials of the Australian and Japanese candidates but 
urged Shcherbakova to reconsider support of the Brazilian 
nominee, drawing on reftel info.  Shcherbakova promised to 
take the issue under consideration and to pass our 
assessment of the candidates to the Ukrainian Mission in 
Geneva. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Shcherbakova also remarked that she had heard 
"informally" that the United States intended to support the 
candidate from Pakistan and asked if this were true. 
(Comment: We suspect Shcherbakova heard this from a third- 
country official during a recent visit to Geneva.  End 
Comment.)  Econoff responded that the USG did not believe 
Ambassador Masood Khan of Pakistan met our criteria nor 
would he meet the needs of WIPO. 
 
¶4. (U) PolOff followed up by delivering the points to Iryna 
Kachenko, from the MFA's International Organizations 
Division, on May 7.  Kachenko had no additional comment.
