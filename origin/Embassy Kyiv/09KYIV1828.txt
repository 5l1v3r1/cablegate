¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 7. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: Deputy Minister of Fuel and Energy Sergiy 
Pavlusha confirmed that Ukraine was planning to send an 
interagency delegation, including representatives from 
state-owned energy companies Naftohaz and Energoatom, to the 
scheduled October 28 Energy Security Working Group meeting. 
Pavlusha noted that the Cabinet of Ministers needed to give 
final approval for the delegation to travel but expected its 
approval shortly.  The Ministry also proposed more detailed 
agenda items and asked if any joint documents would be agreed 
on at the meeting.  End summary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In an October 20 meeting to discuss Ukraine's 
participation in the inaugural U.S.-Ukraine Energy Security 
Working Group (ESWG) meeting on October 28, Deputy Minister 
of Fuel and Energy Sergiy Pavlusha stated that Ukraine was 
preparing to send a delegation comprised of representatives 
from the Ministries of Fuel and Energy, Economy, and Foreign 
Affairs, along with representatives from the Presidential 
Secretariat, the National Security and Defense Council, and 
if funding allowed, from the National Agency for the 
Effective Use of Energy Resources (NAER) to the meeting. 
President Yushchenko's Energy Security Envoy, Bogdan 
Sokolovsky, would be included in the delegation but would not 
co-chair it, according to Pavlusha.  Pavlusha also said that 
Ukraine would like to include representatives from 
state-owned Naftohaz and Energoatom, provided the USG had no 
objection to their participation.  The Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy had submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers the proposed 
delegation and was waiting for approval, which Pavlusha 
expected to receive without problems. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Pavlusha proposed detailed agenda items for the 
meeting and noted that they fit within the broad categories 
suggested by the USG (Ref A).  Ukraine has proposed the ESWG 
discuss joint efforts to: 
 
--diversify Ukraine's energy supply (sources and routes); 
--modernize Ukraine's gas transit system; 
--develop the Eurasian Oil Transit Corridor (the Odesa-Brody 
Pipeline), including prospects of American oil companies 
working in the Caspian region to assist in the Corridor's 
development; 
--reduce Ukraine's dependence on foreign nuclear fuel, 
including prospects for the construction of a nuclear fuel 
fabrication facility in Ukraine with Westinghouse technology; 
--implement the second stage of the Nuclear Fuel 
Qualification Project; 
--improve safety at Ukraine's nuclear power plants; 
--increase renewable energy and energy efficiency in Ukraine; 
and 
--expand trilateral energy security dialogue between Ukraine, 
the U.S., and the EU. 
 
Pavlusha also noted that the Ministry is working to develop a 
set of priorities that could benefit from any future U.S. 
technical assistance.  Recalling his many years at the 
Ministry, Pavlusha said that many of the most successful past 
energy sector reforms had been achieved with U.S. assistance. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Pavlusha asked that we provide a detailed agenda and 
the list of the USG delegation.  He also wanted to know if 
the terms of reference or mandate of the ESWG would be 
discussed at the inaugural meeting and if any joint 
documents, either conclusions of the meeting or a public 
statement, would be agreed on at the meeting. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Pavlusha also briefly discussed Ukraine's accession 
to the European Energy Community.  He noted that the EU had 
given Ukraine a strict timeline for fulfilling sector reform 
commitments and characterized the recently signed EU-Ukraine 
Memorandum of Understanding (Ref B) as an "advance of trust" 
that Ukraine would undertake the required reforms.  Pavlusha 
also commented that Ukraine needs external support to 
complete internal reforms. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Action request: Please provide guidance on Ukraine's 
request to include representatives from Naftohaz and 
Energoatom in the delegation, and its inquiries concerning 
joint documents, the working group's terms of reference, and 
 
KYIV 00001828  002.2 OF 002
