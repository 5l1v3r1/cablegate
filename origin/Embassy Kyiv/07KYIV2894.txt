¶1. On November 26, we provided the background information 
contained ref A on U.S.-Russia discussion on the Conventional 
Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty and missile defense (MD) to MFA 
Arms Control Counselor Rustam Rustamov and Attache Katerina 
Bila.  (We had originally scheduled a meeting with Arms 
Control Director Volodymyr Belashov, our primary interlocutor 
on the topics, but he was unavailable due to a last-minute 
requirement to attend a meeting with the Foreign Minister.) 
Rustamov, who sat in on an earlier meeting (ref B), thanked 
us, noting that Ukrainian officials found our background 
information to be invaluable.
