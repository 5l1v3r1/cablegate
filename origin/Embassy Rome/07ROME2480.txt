COMPACT 
 
REF: ROME 2415 
 
¶1. Ambassador Gianludovico De Martino, Head of the MFA Iraq Task 
Force, has proposed the formation of a secretariat in Baghdad to 
begin the operationalizing the Iraq Compact.  The secretariat would 
be coordinate and manage the work of the International Consultative 
Group for the Iraq Compact.  Once the secretariat has been formed, 
De Martino hopes to use four PRTs: Dhi Qar, Kirkuk, Irbil, and Mosul 
in a pilot project for identifying projects in coordination with 
Iraqi provincial and central governments for international 
assistance.  The Italian Iraq Task Force is organizing a conference 
in Naples, Italy on January 17-18 to lay out this plan to major 
donors and to the Iraqi Government.  De Martino asked the USG to 
consider contributing funds to the IRFFI/ICI project to help provide 
momentum.  He recommended a contribution significant enough to fund 
one provincial project. 
 
¶2. De Martino has proposed the next IRFFI meeting be held in Baghdad 
in order to highlight Iraqi ownership of the process and to begin to 
normalize the process by which Iraq participates in the 
international assistance mechanisms.  During the January Naples 
conference, he will propose the next meeting for March 2008. 
 
¶3. De Martino has asked the USG for support and assistance in the 
following: 
 
- Identify USG officials from S/I, USAID, Treasury, Embassy Baghdad 
Office of Provincial Affairs and MNSTC-I to travel to Naples, Italy 
January 17-18 to participate in the conference/planning session. 
 
- Encourage Iraqi Government participation for the January 
conference. 
 
- Work with the Iraqi Government and GOI to allow US-led PRTs to 
participate in a pilot project to help Iraqi provincial governments 
in Kirkuk and Irbil identify appropriate projects for international 
assistance. 
 
- Consider a symbolic contribution to the IRFFI/ICI process (the 
cost of one project) to build momentum for the process.
