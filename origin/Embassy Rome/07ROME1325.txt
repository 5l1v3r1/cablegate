¶1.  (SBU)  Econoff discussed reftel points with several 
contacts at the MFA's Office of Development Cooperation (ODC) 
June 11 and 14.  Contacts stated that there were no MFA 
bilateral assistance funds available to assist Lebanon; 
rather, ODC and the Italian Embassy in Beirut would work with 
the UN and/or the World Health Organization to ensure that a 
portion of Italy's multilateral assistance budget would go 
toward aiding Palestinian refugees in the near future. 
(Note:  The ODC prefers working with multilateral 
institutions like the UN, given ODC's limited capacity to 
carry out assistance programs itself.  End note.) 
 
¶2.  (U)  Additionally, poloff shared reftel points with MFA's 
UN Office Director, who had no comments.
