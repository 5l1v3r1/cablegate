PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
¶3.  LORIS AND HIS STAFF EXPLAINED THAT IDLI BEGAN TO DEVELOP 
ITS PROPOSED LEGAL REFORM INITIATIVE FOR AFGHANISTAN SHORTLY 
AFTER SEPTEMBER 11.  TO DATE, THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER AN 
EXTENSIVE DATABASE ON AFGHAN LAW IN FORCE FROM 1900 TO THE 
PRESENT DAY IN ENGLISH, PASHTU AND DARI AND DEVELOPED A 
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PRIOR LEGAL SYSTEMS.  IDLI STAFF 
STATED THEIR RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT AFGHANISTAN 
POSSESSES AN ELABORATE AND SOPHISTICATED LEGAL TRADITION. 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST LAWYERS HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY.  TO 
ADDRESS THIS CONCERN, IDLI HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A ROSTER OF 
QUALIFIED EXPERTS AND SCHOLARS ON AFGHAN LAW THAT CAN 
READILY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST AFGHAN AUTHORITIES IN 
REBUILDING THE COUNTRY'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK. 
 
¶4.  IDLI PROVIDED U.S. MISSION REPS WITH A CONCEPT PAPER FOR 
A PROPOSED IDLI AFGHANISTAN INITIATIVE.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS 
INITIATIVE IS TO "ASSIST THE AFGHAN AUTHORITIES TO RESTORE 
THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH LEGAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING 
AND CAPACITY BUILDING TO ALLOW AFGHANISTAN'S  TRANSITION TO 
A MODERN DEMOCRATIC STATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ISLAMIC 
PRINCIPLES, INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, THE PRINCIPLE OF 
LEGALITY AND AFGHAN LEGAL TRADITIONS." 
 
¶5.  THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE, IDLI PROPOSES TO HELP THE TWO 
COMMISSIONS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BONN AGREEMENT TO HELP THE 
AFGHAN INTERIM AUTHORITY (AIA) REBUILD A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR 
AFGHANISTAN--THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION, WHOSE MANDATE IS 
TO PRODUCE A NEW CONSTITUTION, AND THE JUDICIAL COMMISSION, 
CHARGED WITH RE-ESTABLISHING THE JUDICIARY AND THE REMAINDER

PAGE 04        ROME  01616  01 OF 02  291935Z 
OF AFGHANISTAN'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK. 
 
¶6.  SPECIFICALLY IDLI PROPOSES TO: 
 
--ASSIST THE AIA BY IDENTIFYING LAWS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY 
APPLICABLE, IN COMPLIANCE WITH BONN AGREEMENT PRINCIPLES; 
IDENTIFYING CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO OTHER LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS AND DEVELOPING A STRATEGY FOR REBUILDING THE 
JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
 
--  ASSIST THE NEW JUDICIAL COMMISSION BY PROVIDING TRAINING 
AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO NEWLY APPOINTED JUSTICE 
PERSONNEL; CONSULTING ON THE APPLICABILITY OF PRIOR LAWS ON 
THE JUDICIARY AND JUDICIAL PROCEDURES; IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE

REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A COMPLETE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.

CONSTITUTION BY PROVIDING COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF DIFFERENT

EXPERTISE OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALS AND SCHOLARS FROM COUNTRIES 
WITH LEGAL AND CULTURAL TRADITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF 
AFGHANISTAN.

¶7. IDLI IS CURRENTLY SOLICITING DONOR SUPPORT FOR ITS 
PROPOSAL AND INFORMED U.S. MISSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ITALY HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN TAKING A LEAD ROLE IN 
REBUILDING THE JUDICIAL SECTOR IN AFGHANISTAN, ALTHO 
UGH 
THERE HAS BEEN NO FIRM COMMITMENT TO DATE. IDLI INDICATED 
THAT, ONCE FUNDING IS RECEIVED, IT WILL BE ABLE TO MOBILIZE

COMMENT

¶8.  IDLI IS CURRENTLY A SMALL INSTITUTE THAT, SINCE ITS 
INCEPTION IN 1983, HAS CONDUCTED MANY VALUABLE LEGAL 
TRAINING PROGRAMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  PER REF B, IT IS 
SEEKING TO EXPAND ITS MANDATE AND THERE IS CONCERN THAT THIS 
EXPANSION MAY BE A LITTLE TOO AMBITIOUS. A RECENT 
USAID/WASHINGTON TDY REVIEW OF IDLI'S SOUTH EAST LEGAL 
DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE (SEDLI) IN STABILITY PACT COUNTRIES 
INDICATED THAT IDLI WAS EXPERIENCING GROWING PAINS IN MOVING 
FROM DEVELOPING METHODOLOGY AND CONDUCTING SURVEYS AND 
CONFERENCES TO ACTUAL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION WHERE RESULTS 
OF SURVEYS AND CONFERENCES ARE UTILIZED.
