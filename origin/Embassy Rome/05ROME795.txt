REF: STATE 39018 
 
¶1. (U) Italy strongly insists, in both public and private 
statements, on the complete and swift withdrawal of all 
Syrian forces from Lebanon.  FM Fini issued a public 
statement on March 8 (see para. 2), and our MFA interlocutors 
continue to press their Syrian counterparts as well. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin text of FM Fini's statement.  Syria's military 
redeployment in the Baka'a Valley is a step in the right 
direction if it leads, in a short space of time, to the 
complete withdrawal of all Syrian forces (military and sec ret 
services) present in Lebanon.  Italy, together with all its 
EU partners supports the need to fully and unconditionally 
implement the Security Council's Resolution 1559, which 
foresees the withdrawal of all foreign military forces from 
Lebanon, and the disarmament of the armed militias.  Lebanon 
has to recover its full independence and sovereignty.  We 
share the current demands of the Lebanese political forces, 
which are aimed at the stabilization and reconciliation of 
the Middle East region, something Italy has continually 
pursued.  The worry and fear that the situation in Lebanon 
could explode and contaminate the entire region, are leading 
Italy to ask Syria for an act of courage in implementing the 
Ta'if Agreements and Resolution 1559.  Afterwards, Damascus 
will be able to reestablish its relationship with Lebanon on 
the basis of equality, reciprocal respect and sovereignty, 
conscious that the long-standing brotherly relations between 
Syria and Lebanon will in any case continue.  At Minister 
Fini's invitation, the Syrian Foreign Affairs Minister, 
Farouk Shara'a, will visit Rome on 6 April.  End text. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post delivered Reftel demarche to Luca Ferrari, the 
head of the MFA's Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, on 
March 8.  Pol M/C followed up with the MFA Political 
Director, Giulio Terzi, on March 9, telling him that the US 
welcomed Fini's statement and urging Italy to continue making 
public and private statements to Syria along the same firm 
line.
