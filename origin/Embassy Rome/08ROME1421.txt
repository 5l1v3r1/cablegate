Classified By: Poloff Gabriel Escobar for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA Central America 
and Caribbean Office Director Michele Pala November 20.  Pala 
said Italy has been concerned about democratic deterioration 
in Nicaragua for some time, and demarched the GON several 
months ago in a joint EU action to express concern about the 
exclusion of a number of parties from the November 9 
elections.  He said he was not aware of a recent EU statement 
calling for a recount.  Pala added that Italy always 
coordinates its actions with its EU partners on the ground in 
Managua and in regular policy meetings in Brussels.  Whenever 
possible, Italy seeks to maintain EU consensus, and would not 
make any independent bilateral statements on Nicaragua.
