¶2. (SBU) Poloff delivered Reftel demarche on July 3 to 
Italian MFA Deputy Afghanistan Coordinator Paola Munzi and 
Deputy NATO Office Director Carlo Batori.  Munzi said that 
the Italian government supports the Afghanistan Compact goal 
of an Afghan National Army that is sufficiently trained and 
equipped to meet the significant security challenges facing 
the country, and agreed that the principle of Afghan 
ownership dictates that the Afghan Government is in the best 
position to decide how large the ANA should be.  Both Munzi 
and Batori noted that the proposed increase of the approved 
troop level from 80,000 to 134,000 is much larger than 
previous increases approved by the JCMB, but looked forward 
to hearing further details regarding the expected 
contributions of the donor community and the operational 
support to be provided by CSTC-A.
