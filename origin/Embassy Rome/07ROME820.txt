SIGNING OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMPACT WITH IRAQ 
 
REF: A. STATE 50497 
     ¶B. STATE 46243 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  EcMin met April 20 with MFA Iraq Task Force 
Director Gian Ludovico De Martino to discuss reftel points. 
De Martino reported that the MFA had not yet decided who 
would attend the ICI signing ceremony on May 3.  De Martino's 
aide, Giovanni Scopa, noted that if FM D'Alema could not 
attend, Deputy FM Ugo Intini might, as he had recently 
traveled to Iraq.  Separately, Scopa reported that six 
Italian PRT reconstruction advisors and experts had arrived 
this week in Dhi Qar, Iraq to begin work. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  EcMin also met April 20 with Giulio Terzi, MFA 
Director General for Multilateral Political Affairs and Human 
Rights.  Terzi was doubtful that FM D'Alema would attend the 
meeting and did not how much additional financial or 
technical assistance the GOI would be able to offer Iraq. 
Terzi reassured us that the GOI still had a "strong 
commitment" to the Iraq Compact and would ensure the USG 
appeal for more assistance received a wide audience within 
the GOI.
