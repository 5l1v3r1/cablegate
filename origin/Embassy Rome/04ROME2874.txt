SUBJECT: SUDAN: ITALY SUPPORTS UNSC RESOLUTION DRAFT AND 
WILL URGE GAERC AND SOLANA TO DEPLOY RESOURCES ASAP 
 
REF: STATE 159301 
 
¶1. (SBU) MFA East Africa Office Director Stefano Dejak told 
poloff that Italy appreciated the strong US interest in the 
Darfur crisis and was looking forward to continued and 
enhanced cooperation bilaterally and through the EU.  He had 
reviewed the UNSC resolution draft and confirmed that Italy 
will support the text as written.  Dejak's office is 
currently exploring methods to assist the AU mission 
logistically, incl 
uding airlift.  The specifics will be 
discussed in Brussels.  The AU mission "is not functioning 
properly" continued Dejak, and the situation is 
"deteriorating," given the onset of the rainy season and the 
lack of security. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Dejak stressed that Italy will press hard at the 
July 26 GAERC and with HiRep Solana during his Rome visit 
next week for "the fastest possible release" of EU resources, 
given the "humanitarian disaster" already underway in Darfur. 
 Director for EU CFSP Luigi Mattiolo, who was in the process 
of preparing FM Frattini's briefing material and will attend 
the GAERC, concurred with our view that the EU funds should 
be made available as soon as possible.  According to 
Mattiolo, the bulk of the funds would have been disbursed 
already had the Commission not had to amend EU embargo 
legislation related to Sudan.  Those amendments have been 
completed, so funds will be disbursed prior to the EU's 
August break, promised Mattiolo.  He also noted that the 
total amount allocated was 12 million, not 14.5 million euro 
as indicated reftel. 
 
MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
