Classified By: Charge d'Affaires a.i Elizabeth Dibble for Reasons 1.4 ( 
B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary. The Government of Italy is in broad agreement 
with the conclusions of the U.S. Afghanistan-Pakistan 
Strategic Review and is actively considering additional 
contributions to make at the NATO Summit and the Pakistan 
Donor Conference in Tokyo. Although facing tight budgetary 
restrictions, GOI interlocutors are seized with the urgency 
of addressing problems in the region and looking for ways to 
do more. Italy currently plans to double its Carabinieri 
police training contingent to 100, send 240 troops and 
airlift for Election Security, contribute around USD 2 
million to the ANA Trust Fund and 30-60 million Euros in soft 
loans to Pakistan, but is working to do more in each of these 
areas.  GOI interlocutors tell us that high-level meetings 
with U.S. Officials would help bolster the efforts of MOD La 
Russa and FM Frattini to overcome resistance from the 
Ministry of Finance to additional military and civilian 
expenditures.  Italy is actively lobbying Afghanistan and 
Pakistan's neighbors in the region to participate in the G8 
Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan and Pakistan (Trieste, 
June 26-27), and has secured commitments from Iran, 
Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, with India still playing coy. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) A/DCM presented reftel points to MOD Political Adviser 
Alessandro Ruben and FM Frattini's Chief of Cabinet Alain 
Economides on April 1 and 2. Charge delivered points to 
Italian MFA DG for Asia and Special Envoy for Afghanistan and 
Pakistan Massimo Iannucci on April 3. All interlocutors 
stressed their broad agreement with the U.S. Strategic Review 
on Afghanistan-Pakistan and their desire to do more within 
Italy's tight budgetary confines.  Iannucci had had 
productive meetings with S/SRAP Holbrooke and is looking 
forward to working with him to develop the agenda for Italy's 
G8 Conference on Afghanistan and Pakistan in Trieste (June 
26-27). Italy will seek to do more in Afghanistan, he said, 
with a focus on RC-West which Italy commands, and is 
currently reviewing its aid contribution there with an eye 
toward targeting further assistance more effectively (Note: 
Italy pledged 50 million Euros per year for three years at 
the 2008 Paris Donors Conference). 
 
¶3. (C) According to Iannucci, Iranian Deputy FM Akhandzadeh 
confirmed to FM Frattini at the Hague that Iran would 
participate in the Trieste meeting. Iannucci plans to travel 
to Tehran for follow-up discussions with the Iranians after 
Easter. He stressed that his ""only agenda item"" would be the 
Af-Pak ministerial in Trieste, i.e., no discussion of the 
nuclear issue was envisioned. Separately, Frattini's chief of 
staff told A/DCM that Frattini may still make a stop in 
Tehran in late April, as part of trip to Afghanistan and 
India, added to the Minister's itinerary in part to try to 
secure Indian attendance of Trieste. In addition, 
Turkmenistan and Tajikistan have confirmed their attendance. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Iannucci said current budgetary restrictions will 
make it difficult for Italy to contribute to the Pakistan 
Trust Fund, but the GOI may be able to contribute a further 
20 million Euros in soft loans (on top of the 30-40 million 
Euros in soft loans that GOI officials had already previewed 
with us) with a focus on vocational training for sectors of 
the population vulnerable to poverty. Iannucci confirmed he 
will lead the Italian delegation at the Tokyo Donors Meeting. 
 
¶5. (C) In the April 1 discussion with A/DCM, MOD Adviser 
Ruben noted that MOD La Russa had already done battle with 
Finance Minister Tremonti during the drafting of the last 
defense budget decree and was prepared to do so again, but 
that getting these kind of asks from as high a level in the 
USG as possible was critical, in order for LaRussa to enlist 
Berlusconi support for measures that will otherwise run into 
a Finance Ministry buzz-saw. 
 
¶6. (C)  When presented with the USG list of priority ""asks"" 
for Afghanistan, both Ruben and Economides said that they 
expected LaRussa and Frattini to support the requests and to 
try to get wider support for them within the cabinet. They 
confirmed Italy's informal commitment to double Carabinieri 
police trainers in Afghanistan to 100 and indicated that the 
number could grow higher, if, as on other ""asks,"" they could 
get PM Berlusconi engaged to overrule spending constraints 
set by MinFin Tremonti. Italy plans to contribute 240 troops 
and airlift for Election Support Forces (ESF) but Ruben and 
Economides indicated that it might be possible to increase 
their ESF pledge to 400 to make those troops permanent, 
thereby filling existing shortfalls in RC-West and bringing 
Italian ISAF troop levels to about 3,200. Ruben in particular 
urged the U.S. to be patient with what will likely be 
necessarily a staged approach by the MOD in order to sneak 
the transition from ESF to permanent forces by Tremonti. 
Ruben noted that USG requests for additional OMLTs, ANA Trust 
Fund contributions and Guardia di Finanza border police and 
customs trainers would be more difficult to sell to the 
cabinet, for budgetary reasons, but not impossible. 
 
¶7. (C) Comment: We have strong allies in MOD LaRussa and FM 
Frattini, but they have repeatedly hit a hard budgetary wall, 
erected by Tremonti, on asks of this nature. Berlusconi has 
paid lip-service to strong Italian participation in the new 
U.S.-led Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy, but he has not as yet 
engaged to overrule Tremonti.
