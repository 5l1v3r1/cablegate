¶1.  (SBU)  EconCouns met February 20 with Vincenzo Zezza, 
Ministry of Finance (MOF) Director for IMF Coordination, and 
Francesca Manno, MOF Development Banking Director, to discuss 
reftel points.  EconCouns urged our GOI counterparts to 
consider pressing Zimbabwe to enact the necessary economic 
and social reforms needed to act as a responsible IMF member 
state before the GOI approves IMF voting rights for Zimbabwe. 
 Zezza replied that, while Italy has not yet fully defined 
its position, the GOI could not ignore the "limited 
discretion" set by IMF articles.  "This is not an economic 
issue, but a legal one," he argued.  As Zimbabwe has cleared 
its IMF arrears, Zezza explained, IMF members no longer had 
the "legal right" to deny Zimbabwe IMF voting rights. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) While Zezza stated several times that the GOI, like 
the USG, was deeply concerned about the dire economic 
situation and reports of starvation in Zimbabwe, he de-linked 
IMF voting rights from further Government of Zimbabwe 
economic and social reforms.  Zezza claimed that the GOI 
could only consider continued suspension of Zimbabwe's IMF 
voting rights, if IMF members discovered "between now and 
February 23" that Zimbabwe had failed to meet other IMF 
obligations.
