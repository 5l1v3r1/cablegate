(U) PolOff delivered reftel demarche to MFA Iran Desk Officer 
Stefano De Leo on April 7.  De Leo said Italy shares U.S. 
concerns about Iran's treatment of religious minorities, 
including the Bahai.  He added that it is equally important 
for the international community to protest Iranian human 
rights violations, in addition to the nuclear issue, in our 
efforts to change the Iranian regime's behavior.
