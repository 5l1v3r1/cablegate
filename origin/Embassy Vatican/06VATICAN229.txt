Iraqi Christian Refugees Face Immigration Hurdles 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As delineated in reftel, Monsignor Philip Najim, 
Representative of the Chaldean Catholic Church to the Holy See, 
and Bishop Ibrahim Ibrahim, the Chaldean Patriarch's First 
Counselor based in Detroit, Michigan, told Poloff in a recent 
meeting of the plight of Iraqi Christians and the targeted 
violence he said they now face in Iraq.  As a result of that 
violence, many Iraqi Christians have left Iraq and resettled in 
nearby countries with or without legal status, he said. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Bishop Ibrahim specifically requested we look into the 
situation involving pending immigrant visas to the United States 
for the Chaldean expatriate communities in Jordan, Turkey, 
Greece, and Syria.  Ibrahim asked for our assistance in helping 
reunite these refugees with their families living in the Detroit 
area, indicating they had no where else to go.  Significantly, 
Ibrahim opined that Iraqi Christians are receiving disparate 
treatment versus other immigrant groups in similar situations, 
and asked us to help rectify this situation.  Specifically, he 
claimed that other refugee groups may not have to wait as long 
as Chaldeans to receive their IVs.

Action: Information and Talking Points - Iraqi Christian IVs 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Request Department provide Post with information and 
proposed talking points regarding immigrant visa (IV) processing 
for Chaldean Christian expatriate communities situated in 
Jordan, Turkey, Greece, and Syria.  While Post assured Bishop 
Ibrahim that the Chaldean Community is being treated fairly and 
in accordance with U.S. laws, specific information regarding 
their immigrant status and the treatment of other similarly 
situated refugee groups and their IV petitions would be 
appreciated.
