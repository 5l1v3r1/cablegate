SUBJECT: BRIGITTINE SISTER DESCRIBES FIDEL'S HEALTH, RELIGIOUS 
SITUATION IN CUBA


REF: 06 VATICAN 262 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Christopher Sandrolini, DCM, EXEC, State. 
REASON: 1.4 (d) 

¶1. (C) Summary.  A prominent Rome-based nun who is on good terms 
with Fidel Castro told Ambassador about her recent trip to Cuba, 
Fidel's health, improving conditions for religion in Cuba, and 
relations with Cardinal Ortega.   End summary. 
 
¶2. (C)  Ambassador and DCM called on Mother Tekla Famiglietti, 
Abbess General of the Brigittine Sisters in Rome and a friend of 
Fidel Castro (see reftel for previous reporting), November 19 to 
hear about her visit to Cuba earlier this month.  Mother Tekla 
said that unlike previous visits, during this trip she did not 
see Castro personally, but spoke to him by phone.  She said his 
personal secretary, Carlos Valenciaga  Diaz, confirmed to her 
that Castro does not have any cancer, is slowly recovering from 
his two operations, but is still suffering from severe pains on 
his right side. 
 
¶3. (C) Brigittines in Cuba:  Mother Tekla said she had asked 
Castro for her order to have a fourth building in Cuba for 
charitable purposes (feeding the hungry).  Castro, in response, 
urged her firmly to use the new building for religious purposes 
as well.  The Brigittines have ten sisters in Cuba at present, 
supported in part by occasional donations from Rome. Mother 
Tekla reported that the Cubans have given her order a ""nice 
house"" in Pinar del Rio.  According to her, Cardinal Jaime 
Ortega and Bishop Jorge Serpa both asked her to come to Pinar 
del Rio, and Castro gave her freedom to choose any location she 
wished to begin work. 

¶4. (C) Religion in Cuba:  Mother Tekla describes Cardinal Ortega 
as ""satisfied"" at having obtained materials to build a seminary, 
and as having warmed somewhat toward the regime and to her own 
efforts.  She believes Castro has had a change of heart about 
religion.  Church attendance in Cuba is up, and the Brigittine 
church is full -- ""we have no problems now, it is very open."" 
She described Raul Castro as very open, and in agreement with 
his brother on religion. 
 
¶5. (C) Mother Tekla and Cuba:  Mother Tekla plans to return to 
Cuba in the spring.  She stays in touch by email with her order 
in Cuba, and with Cardinal Ortega.  In Rome she speaks with the 
Pope, with Cardinal Bertone (due to visit Cuba in January), and 
with Archbishop Filoni.  She urges the USG to abandon its 
embargo, which she says is harmful to Cubans. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment:  we do not sense that much is new in what Mother 
Tekla told us this time, but report it for what it's worth and 
to remind readers that she is a regular visitor to Cuba who 
appears to have good access to Fidel Castro.  (In turn, he 
appears to have considerable influence over her.)
