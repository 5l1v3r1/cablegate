¶1.  (SBU) Holy See Country Director for Haiti Monsignor 
Giorgio Lingua told us July 15 the Vatican was eager for new 
Papal Nuncio (Ambassador) Mario Giordano to take the reins in 
Port au Prince.  Giordano was just ordained an archbishop and 
is due to begin work in Haiti "any day now."  Lingua was 
interested in ref (a) points and some news we passed from 
refs (b) and (c).  He explained to us that without a 
permanent nuncio in Port au Prince the Holy See had not been 
getting much political information from Haiti.  Giordano, who 
just finished a tour at the Papal Nunciature to Italy, should 
remedy the situation, Lingua said. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On the aid/relief front, the Vatican sent 
Archbishop Paul Cordes, President of the Holy See's 
clearinghouse for relief efforts, Cor Unum, to Haiti in June. 
 Cor Unum sources told us that Cordes, who often travels to 
poverty-stricken areas, had been "stunned" by the conditions 
in the country following the flooding that occurred before 
his visit.  Cordes met with Catholic aid agencies in Port au 
Prince to discuss rebuilding efforts and has reportedly 
remained engaged on Haiti since returning to Rome.
