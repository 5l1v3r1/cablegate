PAPAL APPEAL FOR DEMOCRACY AND SOVEREIGNTY IN LEBANON 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II APPEALED AUGUST 19 TO LEBANESE 
AUTHORITIES NOT TO SACRIFICE THE "VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND 
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY" BECAUSE OF TRANSITORY POLITICAL 
INTERESTS. RESPONDING TO THE DETENTION OF CHRISTIAN ANTI- 
SYRIAN ACTIVISTS IN LEBANON, THE PONTIFF SAID THAT A 
"PLURALISTIC AND FREE LEBANON" IS OF BENEFIT TO THE ENTIRE 
MIDDLE EAST REGION. IN A REGULAR SUNDAY ADDRESS, THE POPE 
SAID LEBANON ALREADY SUFFERED FROM INTERNAL DIVISIONS. THE 
PAPAL APPEAL FOR LEBANON WAS GIVEN FRONT-PAGE PROMINENCE IN 
THE AUGUST 20 EDITION OF THE VATICAN'S SEMI-OFFICIAL DAILY 
"L'OSSERVATORE ROMANO." THE TEXT OF THE POPE'S WORDS WAS 
FOLLOWED BY A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE EVENTS SURROUNDING 
THE DETENTION OF THE CHRISTIAN ACTIVISTS.

ROME TO BAKLAVA IN ATHENS OR A PINT OF GUINNESS IN DUBLIN. 
THE ITALIAN TREASURY ANNOUNCED AUGUST 17 THAT IT WILL MINT A 
SMALL QUANTITY OF EURO COINS FOR THE VATICAN BEARING THE 
IMAGE OF THE POPE. UNDER AN ACCORD WITH ITALY SIGNED EARLIER 
THIS YEAR, THE VATICAN WILL BE PERMITTED AN ANNUAL MAXIMUM 
OF EUROS 670,000 (US DOLLARS 615,000), WHICH IS ABOUT THE 
SAME MINTED UNTIL NOW IN ITALIAN LIRA. LIKE OTHER 
PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES, THE VATICAN WILL DESIGN ONE SIDE OF 
ITS EURO COINS; THE OTHER SIDE IS COMMON TO THE WHOLE EURO 
ZONE. IN THE PAST, EUROPEAN NEWSPAPERS HAVE REPORTED THAT 
AUTHORITIES IN FRANCE RESISTED VATICAN EUROS BEARING AN 
IMAGE OF THE POPE BECAUSE OF CHURCH-STATE CONCERNS.

POSSIBLE PAPAL TRIP TO BULGARIA 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.   COMMENTS TO THE PRESS BY THE PAPAL REPRESENTATIVE IN 
BULGARIA, ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO MENNINI, HAVE IGNITED 
SPECULATION ABOUT A 2002 VISIT TO SOFIA BY POPE JOHN PAUL 
II. SPEAKING TO JOURNALISTS AFTER A MEETING AT THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY, MENNINI SAID BULGARIAN AUTHORITIES "ARE LOOKING 
FORWARD" TO A PAPAL VISIT. ALTHOUGH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN 
BULGARIA HAS OBJECTED TO A PAPAL VISIT, ARCHBISHOP MENNINI 
SAID A VISIT FROM THE POPE WOULD BE "A CLEAR SIGN OF THE 
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR THE BULGARIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH."

¶5.   VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS RELEASED A COPY 
AUGUST 23, OF U.S. CARDINAL THEODORE MCCARRICK'S ASSESSMENT 
OF THE SITUATION REGARDING THE "MARRIAGE" OF ZAMBIAN 
ARCHBISHOP EMMANUEL MILINGO TO A KOREAN WOMAN, MARIA SUNG. 
BEGIN TEXT: OUR HEARTS ARE TROUBLED BY THE PAIN WHICH MARIA 
SUNG UNDOUBTEDLY FEELS AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME IN HER LIFE. 
WHILE SHE MAY BELIEVE SHE IS DOING THE RIGHT THING, IN ALL 
LIKELIHOOD HER ACTIONS ARE THE RESULT OF A PROCESS OF 
PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE AND UNREALISTIC REASONING. THE TRUTH 
IS THE CEREMONY THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY REVEREND MOON HAS NO 
REAL CONNECTION WITH TRUE MARRIAGE AND EVEN LESS WITH 
CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE. IT WAS BASED ON A BELIEF IN THE DIVINE 
MISSION OF MR. MOON AND NOT ON THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST. 
YET, IT IS THIS DIVINITY THAT GIVES THE TRUE SACRAMENTAL 
CHARACTER TO CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE. WE WHO PROFESS OUR BELIEF 
IN THE ESSENTIAL AND PERMANENT CHARACTER OF THE SACRAMENT OF 
MATRIMONY ALSO BELIEVE WITH EQUAL CONVICTION IN THE 
SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS, BY WHICH A MAN, BE HE PRIEST OR 
BISHOP, IS BOUND BY THE GRAVE BONDS OF HIS PROMISES OF 
CELIBACY AND FIDELITY THAT HE FREELY PROFESSED AT 
ORDINATION. THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS ELEMENTS OF A PRIEST'S 
VOCATION, EVEN MORE SO WHEN THAT PRIEST IS A BISHOP. THEY 
ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. THE BISHOP'S UNION WITH THE

TO A WOMAN THREATENING SUICIDE IF THE ALREADY MARRIED MAN 
SHE WANTS TO MARRY WILL NOT LEAVE HIS LAWFUL WIFE. WE PRAY 
FOR MARIA SUNG. WE HOPE FOR HER PEACE OF MIND AND SOUL 
THROUGH WHICH SHE MAY FIND THE LORD AND HIS OWN DEEP TRUTH 
AND LOVE. WE PRAY ALSO FOR ARCHBISHOP MILINGO THAT, HAVING 
RECOVERED HIS FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE, HE MAY BE CONFIRMED IN 
HIS FAITHFULNESS TO CHRIST AND TO HIS CHURCH. END TEXT.
