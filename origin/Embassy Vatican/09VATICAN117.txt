¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli requested 
greater mass communication freedom for the Catholic Church in 
Cuba during his visit to the island November 6 to 8.  On his 
return to Rome, he criticized U.S. economic sanctions against 
Cuba.  The Vatican's approach to Havana remains to press for 
progressive change in Cuba while restating its well-known 
opposition to economic sanctions.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Archbishop Celli is the President of the Vatican's 
Council for Social Communications, and was in Cuba at the 
invitation of the Cuban Conference of Bishops (reftel).  In an 
interview with the Spanish news agency EFE on November 5, Celli 
expressed his wish that the Catholic Church in Cuba would have 
"normal and frequent access" to mass media, which are controlled 
by the state.  In a separate interview with Vatican Radio on 
November 13 (after his return to Rome), Celli said he had asked 
Cuban authorities to give normal access to the airwaves to the 
Church.  While noting that the economic cost of mass 
communication is an issue, Celli  said government restrictions 
were the biggest obstacle to the Church's communication efforts. 
 "They said they would think about it", Celli added. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) In the same Vatican Radio interview, Celli also 
criticized U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba.  He  called for 
the Obama administration to  lift restrictions, because 
"undeniably, it is the population that suffers the most." 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: The Vatican is not naove, and knows little 
has changed in Cuba since Raul assumed power.  However, it takes 
a long view and would much rather continue to press for small 
incremental concessions than openly criticize Havana and risk 
the relative freedom of worship that Cuban Catholics now enjoy. 
The GOC has made small concessions to the Church over time. 
Taken together,  they allow - in the Vatican's view - new 
avenues for the Catholic Church's pastoral mission.  In order 
not to risk this incremental progress, the Vatican  likely will 
shy away from international partnerships to press openly for 
political change in Cuba.  At the same time, the Church will 
also continue to  restate its opposition to economic sanctions 
to prove its independence to Cuban authorities.  End comment.
