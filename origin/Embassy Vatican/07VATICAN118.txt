SUBJECT: HOLY SEE:  INQUIRIES PENDING ON RADIO MARYJA 



REF: STATE 100294 
 
(SBU) Charge d'affaires spoke to Monsignor Marcel Smejkal, the 
Holy See's director for East/Central European countries, on July 
25 concerning Radio Maryja and Father Rydzyk.  Smejkal, who is 
familiar with the situation, expressed regret and said that 
inquiries as to how the Church should respond were under way in 
Poland (by the Redemptorists) and in Rome (by the Congregation 
for the Clergy) and in each case results would probably not be 
available for some weeks.  We are trying to reach appropriate 
officials in the Congregation for the Clergy for more details, 
though with most officials out for summer holidays it may take 
some time.  Post will report further results soonest.
