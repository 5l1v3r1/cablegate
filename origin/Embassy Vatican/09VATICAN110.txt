SUBJECT: NEW IRANIAN AMBASSADOR PRESENTS CREDENTIALS TO THE POPE 
 
¶1.  (U) On October 29, Pope Benedict XVI accepted the 
credentials of Mr. Ali Akbar Naseri as the new Ambassador of 
Iran to the Holy See.  As is customary, the Pope and the 
ambassador presenting credentials exchanged remarks (in writing) 
highlighting their respective priorities for the relation.  As 
reported in the Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official 
newspaper, the Pope stressed the need to observe international 
law and freedom of religion.  He also emphasized the importance 
of good relations between peoples of different religions and 
advocated respect for the free movement of religious workers 
across national borders.   The Pope also expressed concern for 
the rights of Catholics in Iran. 
 
¶2.  (U) Ambassador Naseri's remarks addressed Iran's nuclear 
ambitions and criticized what he claimed are the unequal 
standards to which Iran's nuclear program is subject.  He stated 
Iran is a democracy that should be allowed to pursue a peaceful 
nuclear program and complained that Iran's legitimate ambitions 
have repeatedly been blocked while those of other nations have 
been fully supported.  He also alleged that Islamophobia is 
prevalent in the West and stated that Iran supports peaceful 
interreligious dialogue. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:   Iran has five diplomats accredited to the 
Holy See, a fairly large number for a Muslim-majority country 
hosting a very small Catholic population (about 25,000).  Iran, 
however, seems to value its diplomatic ties with the Vatican 
because the Holy See is only an observer in the UN and could 
therefore play an intermediary role in a hypothetical Iran-UN 
faceoff.  Iran also appreciates that the Holy See is a firm 
believer in diplomacy and opposes the use of force except as a 
last resort to avoid an even greater evil - a rare occurrence 
from the Vatican's perspective.  The Vatican finds the Iranian 
hierarchical religious leadership a suitable counterpart for 
advancing religious dialogue with Shia Muslims.  It is not, 
however, naove about Iranian pernicious influence in Lebanon and 
elsewhere in the region, laments the precarious situation of 
Christians in Iran, and wishes Tehran would be more cooperative 
in addressing the international community's concerns about its 
nuclear program.  End comment.
