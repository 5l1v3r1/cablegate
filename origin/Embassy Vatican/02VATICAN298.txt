SUBJECT: VATICAN REPORTS EYES ON GUANTANAMO 
 


CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR R. JAMES NICHOLSON REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 


 
¶1.  (C)  THE VATICAN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN DESK OFFICER ADVISED POLOFF 1/16 THAT U.S. TREATMENT OF DETAINEES AT THE GUANTANAMO BASE AND ELSEWHERE HAD BECOME A SALIENT QUESTION IN HIS VATICAN MEETINGS, BOTH IN-HOUSE AND WITH FOREIGN DIPLOMATS.  IN PARTICULAR, MSGR. LUIS MARIANO DE MONTEMAYOR, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  00298  190706Z 
THE VATICAN DESK OFFICER, SPOKE REPEATEDLY OF CONVERSATIONS WITH A RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT AND REPUTED INTELLIGENCE ELEMENT, DMITRY SHTODIN.  MSGR. MONTEMAYOR RECOUNTED THAT THE RUSSIAN 
FEDERATION IS CAREFULLY STUDYING U.S. TREATMENT OF DETAINEES IN SEARCH OF USEFUL PRECEDENTS TO JUSTIFY ITS TREATMENT OF CHECHNYA PRISONERS. 
 



¶2.  (C)  MONTEMAYOR STATED THE ISSUE OF DETAINEE TREATMENT COULD ALSO GAIN PROMINENCE WITHIN THE VATICAN, WHERE A HEATED INTERNAL DEBATE ENDED IN SOLID VATICAN SUPPORT, WITH SOME RESERVATIONS, FOR THE U.S.-LED CAMPAIGN. MONTEMAYOR REPEATED 
EARLIER COMMENTS TO POLOFF THAT CERTAIN VATICAN VOICES, FEARING A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER IN THE MAKING, HAD LOBBIED FOR A VATICAN STANCE LESS AMENABLE TO THE U.S.  HE NOTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT, CONTRARY TO THE NAYSAYERS' EXPECTATIONS, THE U.S. INTERVENTION HAD CLEARLY AMELIORATED HUMANITARIAN CIRCUMSTANCES IN AFGHANISTAN.  HOW THE USG RESOLVES TO TREAT 
THE GUANTANAMO DETAINEES MAY PROVE THE NEXT HURDLE FOR THE CURRENT CONSENSUS OF SUPPORT WITHIN THE VATICAN. (NOTE: MONTEMAYOR WAS PROBABLY REFERRING TO PEOPLE IN THE VATICAN'S ASSISTANCE ARM -- COR UNUM -- WHICH HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN CRITICAL OF U.S. ""UNILATERALISM""). 
 


¶3.  (C)  COMMENT: THE SON OF A SENIOR ARGENTINIAN NAVAL 
OFFICER, MONTEMAYOR HAS SAID IN THE PAST THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY LIVED UNDER THREAT AND WITH A PROTECTIVE POLICE DETAIL.  HIS ARGENTINE BACKGROUND APPEARS ESSENTIAL IN HIS HARSH JUDGMENTS OF EL-QAEDA TERRORISM.  INDEED, MONTEMAYOR RELATED HOW HIS RUSSIAN INTERLOCUTOR WAS TAKEN ABACK AT HIS 
QUOTE LACK OF TENDER FEELINGS END QUOTE TOWARD THE GUANTANAMO DETAINEES.  AS AN ARGENTINE, MONTEMAYOR FINDS THE U.S. TO BE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

IN FAMILIAR WATERS, LEGALLY AND ETHICALLY, IN ITS EVOLVING APPROACH TO THE GUANTANAMO DETAINEES AS WELL AS THE JOHN WALKER CASE.  WOULD ARGENTINA'S ERSTWHILE MILITARY TRIBUNALS SOON SEE THEIR U.S. EQUIVALENT, HE WONDERED.
