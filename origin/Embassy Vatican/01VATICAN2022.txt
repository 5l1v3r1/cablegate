POPE REPLIES TO UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.   VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS ANNOUNCED APRIL 
10 THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS WRITTEN TO UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX 
PATRIARCH VLADIMIR OF KIEV. THE SPOKESMAN DID NOT DIVULGE 
THE CONTENTS OF THE PRIVATE LETTER. VATICAN SOURCES SAY IT 
STRESSED THE ECUMENICAL NATURE OF THE PONTIFF'S VISIT TO 
UKRAINE THIS SUMMER. CARDINAL ROBERTO TUCCI, THE OUTGOING 
DIRECTOR OF PAPAL TRAVEL, DELIVERED THE LETTER TO THE 
ORTHODOX PATRIARCH. TUCCI ALSO DELIVERED AN INVITATION FOR 
THE PATRIARCH TO ATTEND THE VATICAN'S COMMEMORATION OF THE 
LAST HOURS OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST (STATIONS OF THE 
CROSS) AT ROME'S COLISEUM ON APRIL 13. PATRIARCH VLADIMIR 
WROTE TO THE POPE JANUARY 22 ON BEHALF OF THE 42 UKRAINIAN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

ORTHODOX BISHOPS WHO ARE ALIGNED WITH THE PATRIARCHATE OF 
MOSCOW. HE URGED THE POPE NOT TO GO THROUGH WITH HIS PLANNED 
VISIT, SAYING IT WOULD COMPLICATE ECUMENICAL RELATIONS. 
WHILE THE CONTENTS OF THE PATRIARCH'S LETTER WERE MADE 
PUBLIC IMMEDIATELY, THE VATICAN DID NOT OFFICIALLY RECEIVE A 
COPY UNTIL WEEKS LATER AND HAS NOW RESPONDED PRIVATELY. THE 
VATICAN HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT, DESPITE THE OBJECTIONS OF 
THE ORTHODOX LEADERS, THE POPE WILL NOT CHANGE HIS PLANS.

VATICAN RADIO: REDUCTION IN MEDIUM WAVE TRANSMISSIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3.   VATICAN RADIO ANNOUNCED APRIL 10 THAT IT WILL REDUCE 
THE NUMBER OF ITS MEDIUM WAVE BROADCASTS AFTER A JOINT 
VATICAN-ITALIAN COMMISSION DETERMINED THAT THE STATION 
VIOLATED ITALY'S STRICT LIMITS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION. 
PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENTS TAKEN BY A JOINT TEAM OF 
TECHNICIANS FROM VATICAN RADIO AND THE ITALIAN MINISTRIES OF 
HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT CONFIRMED THAT SOME TRANSMISSION 
LEVELS EXCEEDED BY AS MUCH AS THREE TIMES THE ITALIAN LIMITS 
ON ELECTROMAGNETIC EMISSIONS. VATICAN SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN 
NAVARRO-VALLS SAID THE RADIO REDUCED SIGNAL STRENGTH BY 50 
PERCENT IN FEBRUARY 2001, AND THAT CUTS IN BROADCASTING 
SCHEDULES WOULD BE MADE TO BRING LEVELS INTO LINE WITH 
ITALIAN STANDARDS. BROADCASTS VIA FM AND SHORT WAVE (HOW 
MOST OF THE WORLD RECEIVES THE RADIO'S PROGRAMMING) WILL NOT 
BE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES. VATICAN RADIO POINTED OUT THAT 
ITS TRANSMISSIONS CONFORM TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON 
ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY 14 
OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. ITALY PASSED MORE STRINGENT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02022  01 OF 03  121845Z 
REGULATIONS IN 1998. (COMMENT: EMBASSY CONTACTS AT VATICAN 
RADIO SAY THE REDUCTION IN TRANSMISSION SCHEDULES WILL HAVE 
MINIMAL IMPACT ON ITS OPERATION. THE RADIO HAS PLANNED FOR 
SOME TIME TO FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON SATELLITE AND INTERNET 
TECHNOLOGY TO PROPAGATE ITS MESSAGE. END COMMENT). 
 
-------------------------------- 
CHANGES TO POPE'S EASTER PROGRAM 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.   THE VATICAN ANNOUNCED APRIL 10 THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II 
WILL NOT PARTICIPATE FULLY IN AN APRIL 13 COMMEMORATION OF 
THE LAST HOURS OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST (STATIONS OF THE 
CROSS) AT ROME'S COLISEUM. THE INTERNATIONALLY TELEVISED 
EVENT IS A HIGHLIGHT OF THE VATICAN'S EASTER WEEKEND 
PROGRAM. INSTEAD OF WALKING AROUND THE COLISEUM, THE POPE 
WILL REMAIN KNEELING THROUGHOUT THE CEREMONY. HE WILL CARRY 
A LIGHT WOODEN CROSS FOR THE FINAL FEW METERS OF THE 
PROCESSION AND THEN DELIVER HIS CUSTOMARY MESSAGE AT THE 
CONCLUSION OF THE SERVICE. THE CHANGE IN FORMAT IS A 
CONCESSION TO THE POPE'S PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS.

PAGE 02        VATICA  02022  02 OF 03  121846Z 
APRIL 9 THAT POPE JOHN PAUL HAD DONATED SOME US DOLLARS 7 
MILLION DURING THE VATICAN'S FY2000. THE MONEY WAS USED FOR 
EMERGENCY AID IN PLACES LIKE KOSOVO, MOZAMBIQUE AND ETHIOPIA 
AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN GEORGIA, CAMEROON AND PERU AMONG 
OTHERS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE FIGURE ARE TWO "CONTINENT 
SPECIFIC" PROJECTS. THE "POPULORUM PROGRESSIO" FOUNDATION 
FUNDS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES FOR THE POOR IN LATIN AMERICA. 
SOME US DOLLARS 2 MILLION WENT TO MOSTLY AGRICULTURAL 
PROJECTS. THE "SAHEL FOUNDATION" TACKLES DESERTIFICATION IN 
THE SUB-SAHARAN COUNTRIES OF BURKINA FASO, CAPE VERDE, CHAD, 
GAMBIA, MALI, GUINEA-BISSAU, MAURITANIA, NIGER AND SENEGAL. 
THE FOUNDATION SENT MORE THAN US 2 MILLION FOR SEVERAL 
HUNDRED ARABLE LAND PRESERVATION PROJECTS. "COR UNUM'S" 
PRESIDENT, GERMAN BORN ARCHBISHOP PAUL CORDES, DOWNPLAYED 
THE MONETARY FIGURE OF THE PAPAL DONATIONS SAYING THAT THE 
FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE POPE'S GESTURES OF SOLIDARITY WITH 
THE POOR AND NEEDY. THE POPE RECEIVES HIS CHARITY FUNDING 
FROM AN ANNUAL WORLDWIDE COLLECTION IN CATHOLIC PARISHES AND 
FROM DONATIONS FROM DIOCESES, RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS AND 
PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
VATICAN PEEVED BY EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CENSURE 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.   THE VATICAN HAS EXPRESSED "DISAPPOINTMENT" OVER A 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION CONDEMNING IT FOR ALLEGED 
INACTION IN THE FACE OF REPORTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF NUNS BY 
PRIESTS. (REFTEL). THE VATICAN'S OBSERVER AT THE PARLIAMENT, 
MONSIGNOR PAUL GALLAGHER, SAID THE VATICAN SHARED THE 
EUROPEAN BODY'S CONCERN ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, AND IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  02022  02 OF 03  121846Z 
PARTICULAR CATHOLIC NUNS. HE OPINED THE RESOLUTION REFLECTED 
ANTI-VATICAN SENTIMENTS IN SOME QUARTERS OVER ABORTION AND 
CONTRACEPTION POLICY CONFLICTS. GALLAGHER NOTED THAT LESS 
THAN 20 PERCENT OF THE PARLIAMENT'S MEMBERS TOOK PART IN THE 
VOTE BUT THAT "ANY ACT OF A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION IS TO BE 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY." 
 
---------------------------------- 
VATICAN CABINET LEVEL APPOINTMENTS 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7.   THE VATICAN HAS ANNOUNCED TWO SENIOR CABINET LEVEL 
APPOINTMENTS. CARDINAL CRESCENZIO SEPE IS TO TAKE THE REINS 
OF THE VATICAN'S POWERFUL MISSIONARY OFFICE, THE 
CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES, AND 
ARCHBISHOP ANTONIO MARIA VEGLIO BECOMES SECRETARY (NUMBER 2 
POSITION) OF THE CONGREGATION FOR THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES. 
CARDINAL SEPE WAS THE BRAINS AND THE ENERGY BEHIND THE 
VATICAN'S SUCCESSFUL MILLENNIUM YEAR CELEBRATIONS. HE IS A 
CHARISMATIC FIGURE AND MEDIA-SAVVY. HIS CONSIDERABLE 
ORGANIZATIONAL AND FUND-RAISING ABILITY SHOULD RESULT IN THE 
POWER CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLES 
ASSUMING AN EVEN HIGHER PROFILE IN THE VATICAN GOVERNMENT. 
(NOTE: IT IS NO SECRET THAT SEPE IS A PAPAL FAVORITE AND HAS 
BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS Y2K ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WHEN PAPAL 
ADVISORS HEARD THAT SEPE WAS TO BE CREATED A CARDINAL 
FEBRUARY LAST, THEY COMMENTED THAT HE WAS TOO YOUNG - HE 
TURNS 58 THIS YEAR. POPE JOHN PAUL II REPLIED, "I BECAME 
POPE AT THE SAME AGE!" END NOTE). ARCHBISHOP VEGLIO IS 
PRESENTLY THE VATICAN'S AMBASSADOR TO LEBANON AND KUWAIT, 
AND THE POPE'S REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES ON 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02022  02 OF 03  121846Z 
THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. HE SUCCEEDS AN AGING AND RECLUSIVE 
UKRAINIAN ARCHBISHOP AS NUMBER TWO AT THE CONGREGATION FOR 
THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES (NOTE: THE CONGREGATION HANDLES ALL 
ISSUES RELATING TO THOSE CHRISTIANS WHO ARE NOW IN COMMUNION 
WITH ROME BUT USE EASTERN OR ORTHODOX-LIKE WORSHIP FORMS AND 
CHURCH ORGANIZATION. END NOTE). VEGLIO'S LANGUAGE SKILLS AND 
DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE (HE HAS ALSO SERVED IN EUROPE, AFRICA, 
SOUTH AMERICA AND THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION) AUGUR WELL FOR A 
REVAMPING OF THE POSITION. (COMMENT: THE CONGREGATION FOR 
THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES IS SET TO TAKE ON GREATER IMPORTANCE 
IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF THE POPE JOHN PAUL'S OUTREACH 
TO ORTHODOXY FOR WHOM THE EXISTENCE OF EASTERN RITE 
CATHOLICS IS A MAJOR STICKING POINT COMPLICATING EVENTUAL 
UNION WITH ROME. END COMMENT).
