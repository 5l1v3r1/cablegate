¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Gaza power plant received EU-funded 
fuel shipments on August 22 and returned to its normal 65 MW 
of electricity output.  According to Gaza contacts, most 
homes now have 18-22 hours of electricity each day. 
The electricity shortage from August 19-21 resulted in 
spoiled food, limited medical care, and a relative halt in 
economic activity.  At the same time, however, Gaza-based 
contacts report that Hamas forces are interfering more in the 
daily lives of Gazans.  End summary. 
 
Power Back On 
------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) EU-funded fuel shipments resumed on August 22 
following an agreement by the PA and the EU to appoint an 
external auditor to review the physical and financial systems 
in place to prevent Hamas from diverting utility revenues, 
and most Gazan homes are receiving electricity 18-22 hours 
per day.  From August 19-21, Gaza relied on electricity 
supply from Israel and Egypt, and received power 4-6 hours 
per day, according to Gaza-based OCHA representative Hamada 
al-Bayari.  UNRWA Gaza Director John Ging told ConGenoffs via 
DVC August 24 that the Gaza water supply was returning to 
normal, as electric pumps began pushing fresh water through 
backed-up pipe systems - a result of the power shortage. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Al-Bayari told econoff that the power shortages 
caused most families' refrigerated food to be spoiled, 
hospitals health services to be greatly limited, and an 
relative halt in economic activity.  He said the had visited 
local hospitals on August 21, reporting that the hospitals' 
reserve generators could produce sufficient electricity to 
power most machines for patients in critical care.  He added 
that air conditioning units had been turned off and lit 
candles lined hallways and rooms and that all non-emergency 
surgeries had to be delayed until power was returned. 
 
 
Gazans Report Increased Hamas Interference 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Gaza-based contacts, in discussing the power 
situation, told ConGenoffs that Hamas forces have been 
increasingly present in Gaza hospitals, weddings, and 
markets.  One USG contractor in Gaza said that Hamas forces 
are taking advantage of their absolute power in Gaza by 
hoarding hospitals' medical supplies and services for Hamas 
members, associates, and family members.  He referred to 
Hamas' growing interference in private gatherings, saying 
that wedding parties in Gaza have been interrupted on 
numerous occasions by Hamas forces demanding that "Fatah 
music" be turned-off. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Another Gaza-based USG contractor told econoff 
August 23 that Gazans' fear of Hamas retaliation for certain 
political activity has created an environment of fear and 
intimidation in Gaza - "contrary to the order and peace we 
read in the press."  He said that most Gazans remain 
relatively quiet only because they fear Hamas' quick 
vengeance on those who participate in civil protest or 
dissent.
