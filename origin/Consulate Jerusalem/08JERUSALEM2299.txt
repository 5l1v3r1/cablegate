Continuing Airstrikes, Rocket Barrages 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) IAF airstrikes struck additional targets throughout 
the Gaza Strip through 1800 local on December 29.  At 1420, 
Gaza-based contacts report that four members of al-Quds 
Brigades (PIJ military wing), including a senior al-Quds 
leader, Ziyad Abu Tayr, and a bystander (a young boy) were 
killed and three others were injured when an Israeli rocket 
hit near gunmen who were about to launch rockets in Abbasan 
al-Kabira (Khan Yunis area).  From 1340-1530, IAF ordnance 
destroyed an al-Qassam Brigades training facility and several 
suspected operational and training camps in Jabaliya and Bayt 
Lahiya.  There were no reports of injuries in these strikes. 
Gaza-based contacts also report that the IAF and Israeli 
naval vessels fired  rockets at buildings on Gaza's harbor, 
and the IAF destroyed several more Gaza City police stations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) At 1530 local, militants fired two rockets towards 
Sderot.  Six other rockets landed in open areas outside the 
Gaza Strip from 1400-1700.  No injuries or damage were 
reported. At least 51 Qassam and Grad-type rockets had struck 
Israel on December 29 as of 1800. 
 
 
Dozens Injured in Fresh IDF-Palestinian 
Clashes in the West Bank 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In Hebron, clashes with the IDF continue following 
a march organized by Hebron University student leaders near 
Shalala Street.  Palestinian press report that 31 students 
were hit with rubber-coated bullets, and others suffered from 
tear gas inhalation.  In Jayus village (near Salfit), at 
least 11 Palestinians were injured around 1400 in clashes 
with the IDF at the entrance of the village.  At around 1230, 
an IDF force entered Kharbtha Bani Harith village (west of 
Ramallah) and raided the family home of Mohammed Yacub Injas, 
the perpetrator of the stabbing attack in Kiryat Sefer 
earlier today. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) PA security services arrested Husam Hanani, the 
Hamas mayor of Bet Furik village (near Nablus), who had 
issued a statement attacking the PA and blaming it for the 
IDF operation in Gaza.  The PA security also arrested Hamas 
members Bashar Hija, Bilal Shalal, Luay Hammad and Abd 
al-Ra'uf Mlaytat for incitement or illegal demonstrations. 
 
Abbas: We Condemn "Israeli Aggression," 
Call for Hamas to Accept Ceasefire 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In a PLO Executive Committee (ExComm) meeting on 
December 29, President Mahmud Abbas (Abu Mazen) said he will 
call representatives of all factions, including Hamas and 
PIJ, to discuss the situation in the Gaza Strip. Abbas 
condemned the "massive Israeli aggression" on Gaza and urged 
the international community to intervene, adding that he had 
repeatedly called for the restoration of the truce in Gaza to 
alleviate hardships of the Gazans.  He thanked Jordan, Egypt, 
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Libya for sending supplies to Gaza, 
and said "the Arabs have been fulfilling their duties 
especially the brotherly Egypt."  (Note: Abbas is expected to 
meet with West Bank Hamas leaders, along with members of 
Fatah and other PLO factions, late December 29.  Hamas 
invitees reportedly include Nasser al-Din al-Sha'ar. 
President's Office contacts say Abbas will discuss the 
situation in Gaza and emphasize the need for Hamas to accept 
an unconditional ceasefire. End note). 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Hamas PLC member Mushir al-Masri told press 
December 29 that President Abbas' statement is a political 
bluff, and that Abbas should release all Hamas prisoners, not 
talk about contacts and consultations with factions, if he is 
serious about national unity. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) In a message from prison, Fatah's Marwan Barghuthi 
called on all factions to hold a national dialogue conference 
 
JERUSALEM 00002299  002 OF 002 
 
 
within two weeks, and urged unity among all factions.  His 
message condemned Israeli airstrikes in Gaza as "massacres 
against the Palestinian people."  Fatah leaders in Nablus 
announced that Fatah will postpone anniversary celebrations 
scheduled for the beginning of January, as "now is an 
appropriate time to confront the Israeli aggression on the 
Gaza strip, not celebrate."  Jerusalem Fatah leaders say they 
will hold a candlelight protest at Damascus Gate in Jerusalem 
late December 29. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Palestinian activists held a small protest in front 
of the French Consulate in East Jerusalem on December 29. 
The same group is expected to hold a protest in front of the 
U.S. Consulate General's East Jerusalem facility on December 
¶30.
