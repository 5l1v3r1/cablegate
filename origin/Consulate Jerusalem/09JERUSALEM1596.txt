Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
All dailies report on President Barack Obama's Iftar in the White 
House on September 1. The local press highlights Obama's remarks 
about his respect for Islam and the Muslim world. The dailies quote 
President Obama saying that Islam is a religion that is committed to 
"justice and progress" and stressed that US relations with the 
Muslim world have to be based on "mutual interest and mutual 
respect." 
 
The dailies front page news on the anticipated trilateral meeting 
between President Obama, Palestinian Authority (PA) President 
Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New 
York on the margins of the UN General Assembly meetings later this 
month. Al-Ayyam reports on President Abbas reiterating to the press 
during his meeting with the Spanish Prime Minister Jos Luis 
Zapatero in Madrid on September 2 that freezing settlement activity 
is a crucial obligation for Israel to fulfill prior to holding the 
meeting. 
 
Al-Quds leads with news citing DPA on Hamas leaders stressing that 
German mediation efforts for a prisoners exchange deal between Hamas 
and Israel are serious and constructive. Senior Hamas official Mousa 
Abu Marzouq is quoted as saying that the negotiations about the deal 
are moving forward. Abu Marzouq also said that he is not optimistic 
about the outcome of national dialogue talks scheduled for next week 
between Hamas and Fatah to end the internal Palestinian division, 
according to coverage. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news on Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh announcing 
that Hamas will not accept President Abbas' decision to hold 
presidential and legislative elections in the West Bank, noting that 
the elections have to be based on internal consensus and not imposed 
from an external party. 
 
The local press highlights the meeting that took place in Jerusalem 
on September 2 between the PA Minister of Economy Bassem Khoury and 
the Israeli Regional Development Minister Silvan Shalom, the first 
cabinet-level meeting since Prime Minister Netanyahu took office. 
Palestinian Authority Presidency Spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina 
noted that the meeting focused on economic issues and had nothing to 
do with the political negotiations. ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Randa Taqi Al-Deen opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title "The Israeli obstacles facing the international peace 
conference" (09/03): "Hosting an international peace conference to 
achieve peace in the region before the end of the year will be a 
very difficult task. The Israeli actions on the ground, including 
its refusal to freeze settlement activity ... will derail all 
international and regional efforts." 
 
2) Abdallah Awwad opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
headline "Development towards transition" (09/03):"Although the 
international community supports an independent Palestinian state, 
the question remains whether this pressure will force Israel to halt 
all settlement activity or will it be overtaken by new agreements?"
