Main Stories:

The three dailies lead with news from the September 8 meeting of 
Arab League foreign ministers held in Cairo.  Citing news agencies, 
they report that Saudi Foreign Minister Al Faysal called for, "an 
Arab mechanism" to help launch inter-Palestinian dialogue.  The 
ministers condemned the continuing Israeli "siege" on the Gaza 
Strip, and reaffirmed Israeli settlements as illegal under 
international law, according to coverage.  In related front page 
stories, Palestinian Authority (PA) President Abbas told press after 
the meeting, that should a comprehensive agreement with Israel not 
be reached, the PA will continue to deal with the Olmert government 
and the American administration.  Abbas further clarified that 
Olmert is still the Israeli Premier and his counterpart in 
negotiations with Israel. 
 
On September 8, Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad and the 
Palestinian Authority cabinet welcomed the support of the European 
Parliament on the issue of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel, 
according to all front pages.  Speaking after the weekly cabinet 
session, Fayyad told press that, "the prisoners issue has been 
introduced and discussed for the first time by the European 
Parliament," referring to the Parliament's September 4 resolution 
that welcomed the recent release of 198 Palestinian prisoners by 
Israel and supported the release of additional prisoners, including 
Fatah leader Marwan Al-Barghuthi.  Fayyad credited the PA with 
stimulating the European debate, noting it was the result of the 
PA's, "efforts to free all prisoners from Israeli jails." 
 
On its front page, Al-Quds highlights that Palestinian Authority 
(PA) President Abbas would win new elections according to a joint 
Palestinian-Israeli poll conducted from August 25 to September 1, 
¶2008.  The poll shows that 53% of Palestinian respondents would vote 
for Abbas while 39% would vote for Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyah as 
president.  Reporting next highlights that 78% of Israelis support 
the release of Palestinian Fatah Leader Marwan Al-Barghouty in 
exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.  The paper further 
reports that a majority of Israelis and Palestinians (79% and 58% 
respectively) support the two-state solution.  The poll was 
conducted by the Palestinian Center for Surveying and Political 
Research and the Truman Institute. 
 
Citing AP, Al-Quds reports that Palestinian Authority (PA) President 
Abbas will meet with President Bush on September 26 at the White 
House.  PA spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudaynah explained that the two 
presidents will discuss "the destiny" of Israeli-Palestinian talks, 
according to the report. 
 
Statements by U.S. Consul General Jake Walles reaffirming U.S. 
commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state and U.S. 
support to the "serious" on-going negotiations are front page news 
in Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida.  The statements are part of 
coverage about the Consul General's Iftar, hosted in Ramallah on 
September 8.  Reporting also underlines Walles' "confidence" that 
peace in the Middle East will continue to be a priority for any new 
U.S. administration.  Al Quds runs similar coverage on page 3.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Independent Al-Quds editorializes in "The strikes..." (9/8): "We 
are experiencing extraordinary, catastrophic conditions in all 
aspects of our political, economic and daily lives.  The on-going 
 
JERUSALEM 00001681  002 OF 002 
 
 
strike [by teachers and health care workers] is increasing the 
suffering and hardship...if the strike continues, hundreds [more] 
students and ill people will suffer... Everybody should understand 
that the [strikers'] demands are reasonable and just, but instead it 
seems impossible [for political leaders] to meet them...  We urge 
everybody to be responsible in fulfilling their national duty." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam runs an editorial by daily columnist 
Muhannad Abdul Hamid entitled, "Do we decide our destiny...or is it 
decided for us?!!" (9/08):  "The first step [towards freedom and 
independence] starts with a solution to the inter-Palestinian 
conflict through true, national reconciliation.  Without security, 
institutional and political reform, without respect for democracy; 
without the elimination of revolution, oppression and corruption... 
we will not find a path to political closure [with Israel].  If we 
do not advance bravely and responsibly towards determining our own 
destiny of freedom and independence, a different destiny will be 
decided for us, a destiny of slavery."
