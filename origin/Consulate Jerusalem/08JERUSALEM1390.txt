PM: Boys Were Unarmed, 
Posed No Threat to Soldiers 
--------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Palestinian Authority (PA) PM Salam Fayyad told the 
Consul General July 30 that shootings that killed two 
Palestinian youths near Ni'lin July 29-30 raised questions 
about IDF rules of engagement (ROEs) in the West Bank.  He 
said information available to the PA suggests that lethal 
force was used against unarmed Palestinians who posed no 
threat to IDF soldiers.  He said 11-year-old Palestinian 
Ahmad Husam Musa was killed by a live round to the head.  He 
added that Musa was shot far from protesters as he and other 
young boys neared a fenced area.  Fayyad said he feared the 
shootings of unarmed demonstrators could ignite protests and 
asked the USG to raise the issue with the GOI and seek an 
explanation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) PA police contacts report that the IDF also shot 
17-year-old Yusif Ahmad Amira in the head twice with 
rubber-coated bullets during July 30 protests in Ni'lin. 
Police told local press that Amira suffered severe head 
trauma and is clinically dead.  Police report that the IDF 
and border police shot and injured six other Palestinians 
with rubber-coated bullets during the protests. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to press, PA Presidency Chief of Staff 
Rafiq Hussayni toured Ni'lin July 30 and urged residents to 
continue protests against Israeli land confiscation and 
barrier construction.  He called Ahmad Musa's killing a 
"terrible crime" and told media that "Israel is attacking 
Palestinian land to hinder the chances of peace."
