SUBJECT: QASSAM ATTACKS SPIKE; CONFLICTING HAMAS STATEMENTS 
ON CEASEFIRE 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 727 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  The Hamas military wing claimed 
responsibility for a number of Qassam rockets and mortars on 
April 23-24.  These were the first rocket attacks claimed by 
Hamas since the November 2006 "tahdiya" (calm) was put in 
place.  On a Hamas military-wing website, spokesman Abu 
Ubaydah said the strikes were a response to recent Israeli 
operations in the West Bank and Gaza, and denied there is a 
cease-fire with Israel (reftel).  The PA Cabinet and PM 
Ismayil Haniyah's spokesman, Ghazi Hamad, called on all 
factions to exercise restraint and discipline.  However, 
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum claimed that faction 
representatives agreed the cease-fire is voided by Israeli 
violations.  PA President Mahmud Abbas (Abu Mazen), traveling 
in Italy, called for restored calm and called the attacks "an 
exceptional event that will not continue."  End summary. 
 
Hamas Military Wing Claims Responsibility 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Hamas military wing (Izz al-Din al-Qassam 
Brigades) claimed responsibility for a number of Qassam 
rockets and improvised mortars on April 23-24, with 12 rocket 
strikes and 8 mortar impacts on Israeli areas adjacent to the 
Gaza Strip.  The attacks caused no injuries, but damaged 
agricultural buildings.  This two day period saw more attacks 
than any other period since November 26, 2006 when a 
"tahdiya" (calm) was agreed by the factions.  It is also the 
first claim of responsibility by Hamas since that time. 
(Note: Since November 26, 2006, there has been a weekly 
average of 8.9 rocket attacks, with most launches claimed by 
PIJ, al-Aqsa Brigades or the Popular Resistance Committees 
(PRCs). End note). 
 
Conflicting Public Statements on Cease-fire 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Izz al-Din al-Qassam website posted a message 
on April 24 saying the rocket and mortar attacks were a 
response to recent Israeli operations in the West Bank and 
Gaza (reftel).  The posting said "this campaign is a message 
to the Zionist enemy that he will pay a heavy price for any 
crimes or aggression against the Gaza Strip, which will 
become a graveyard and hell for Zionist soldiers."  The 
statement quoted the military wing spokesman, Abu Ubaydah, as 
denying the "tahdiya" (calm) agreed to with Israel in 
November, and stating that "the occupation has destroyed the 
calm since it began, and we never trusted (Israeli) 
intentions."  Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum issued press 
statements April 24, claiming that faction representatives 
had met and agreed that Israeli actions had voided the 
ceasefire. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) PM Ismayil Haniyah's spokesman, Ghazi Hamad, blamed 
Israel for recent clashes, but called on all the factions to 
exercise restraint and discipline.  The PA Cabinet released a 
statement calling on all parties to restore calm and abide by 
the November truce, stating "The government reiterates its 
desire that the calm continue and be preserved in line with 
the national interests of the Palestinian people." 
 
Abbas to Journalists: Cease-fire 
Violations "an Exception" 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) PA President Mahmud Abbas (Abu Mazen) told 
international journalists in Italy (at a joint press 
conference with Italian PM Romano Prodi) that "the violation 
of the truce was an exceptional event that will not continue. 
. . I appeal to Israel to exercise necessary self-control so 
that this will not happen again."
