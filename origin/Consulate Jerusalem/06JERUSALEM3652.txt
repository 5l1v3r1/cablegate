Military Developments 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Inter-factional violence flared up in Gaza on 
August 16, when Fatah gunmen and the Hamas-led Ministry of 
Interior's "Executive Force" clashed in Khan Younis.  A 14 
year-old Palestinian was killed and four others were injured. 
 According to sources in the President's office, one of the 
injured was senior Hamas-military wing member Ahmad Ajouri. 
In Gaza City, Israeli Air Force (IAF) planes fired rockets 
into a blacksmith shop, reportedly causing damage, but no 
injuries.  Elsewhere in Gaza, a Hamas activist was killed and 
five others were injured in a blast that was reportedly the 
premature explosion of a bomb the activist was making. 
Palestinian militants fired three home-made rockets from Gaza 
into the Western Negev on August 16.  There was no reported 
damage or injuries.  The military-wing of Fatah and the Abu 
Ali Mustafa Brigades of the Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine (PFLP) claimed responsibility for two of the 
rockets. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In the West Bank, Palestinians threw stones at an 
Israeli car traveling near the northern West Bank city of

damage.  IDF units arrested 11 Palestinians in overnight 
arrest operations throughout the West Bank.
