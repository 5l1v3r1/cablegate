Main Stories:

Al Quds leads with, "Hammad:  Dialogue must succeed in order for new 
elections to proceed." Quoting Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Presidential political advisor Nimer Hammad, the story notes that 
the advisor calls upon all Palestinian factions to engage in the 
internal Palestinian talks to be held in Cairo, "with goodwill." 
Hammad also calls for no further discussion regarding reports about 
PA President Abbas running for office in future elections, stating 
that the issue is not under discussion.  Al Ayyam leads with, "Hamas 
delegation to Cairo presents four vetoes of proposals for a 
technocrat government and new elections." The paper quotes Hamas 
objections to establishing a technocrat government, conducting 
reform to security in Gaza (not the West Bank), disregarding 
previous election results and "dealing with Gaza separately." 
The lead story in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida quotes Palestinian Authority 
(PA) President Abbas confirming that the PA, "will adhere to 
whatever Arabs decide regarding [Palestinian] national unity.  Those 
who do not accept [the decision], will have to bear the 
consequences."  Abbas' statements came during his visit to India, 
where he also commented that, "peace negotiations with Israel shall 
continue towards a comprehensive agreement that does not leave out 
any issues ... [however], this year will, inevitably, end without a 
peace agreement." 
Al Quds' front page reports that Middle East Quartet Envoy Tony 
Blair will arrive in Egypt on October 9 to prepare for a meeting of 
representatives from the Quartet, Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiating teams. 
The world economic crisis is featured on all front pages. Running 
wire stories, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs a headline, "black day in 
world markets," while Al Ayyam's headline notes that the crisis is 
"rocking Wall Street... U.S. calls for unified global action." Al 
Quds runs a large, highlighted box with four wire stories from 
Paris, New York, London, and Tel Aviv, describing the impact of the 
crisis in each capital. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al Ayyam report on their front pages that 
Hamas "legislators" decided in a "parliament session" that 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas' term will end on January 8, 
¶2009.  They also called upon Abbas to task the elections committee 
with preparing for new elections.  Hamas "Legislative Council Deputy 
Speaker" Ahmad Bahr chaired the session and is quoted calling for 
national reconciliation, while another Hamas official Faraj Al 
Ghoul, is quoted stating that the Palestinian Legislative Council's 
deputy speaker will take office after Abbas. 
Al Quds' publishes the results of a public opinion poll conducted by 
Near East Consulting on its front page.  The poll shows that 63% of 
Palestinians want Palestinian Authority President Abbas to continue 
in office, while 37% do not.  The poll also revealed that 88% of 
Fatah supporters want Abbas to stay in office. 
Al Quds notes in a prominent front page story that Palestinian 
Authority (PA) Prime Minister Fayyad announced that the PA will pay 
next month's salaries to public employees.  Fayyad comments came 
after the PA's weekly cabinet meeting.  He also stated that he 
expected the financial situation of the PA to be better next year. 
Al Ayyam's front page highlights comments from the meeting offering 
the ministers' support for the "steadfastness" of the old city of 
Hebron and calling for a lifting of Israeli barriers and 
check-points. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlights news that the cabinet 
has approved funding for cultural activities in Jerusalem to 
celebrate the city as the "Arab cultural capital of 2009," which is 
part of a UNESCO- affiliated program. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports in a front page story that Palestinians 
 
JERUSALEM 00001847  002 OF 002 
 
 
are filing a case with the Israeli Court in Jerusalem to seek 
$427,000 in damages for the failure of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) 
to evict Israeli settlers from the illegal West Bank outpost of 
"Migron."  The complaint alleges that IDF soldiers protect the 40 
settler families instead of implementing an existing Israeli court 
order to remove them.  The court case is the first of its kind 
before the Israeli courts. 
Al Ayyam's front page reports that Hamas leader Masha'al told press 
that there has been no progress in negotiations for the release of 
captured Israeli soldier Shalit. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front page runs a short wire story about a UN 
statement that the war in Afghanistan [against the Taliban] will be 
lost.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Al Quds prints an editorial titled, "No positive signs preceding 
dialogue" (10/07):  "If Hamas rejects the idea of a national 
consensus government and calls for a national government to be 
headed by them; and if Hamas insists that President Abbas' term ends 
on January 9, it is difficult to see that there is any basis for 
agreement [with other Palestinian parties].  If all Palestinian 
factions, except Hamas, agree to new legislative and presidential 
elections, why reject that proposal?  Why do some reject it if they 
enjoy strong popular support?  Why doesn't Hamas aspire to winning a 
sweeping majority in the legislative elections and winning the 
presidential elections as well, as long as they are confident that 
they enjoy all the people's trust? Anyway, what is needed is to 
immediately stop doing anything that might hinder the proposed 
dialogue or pre-determine its outcome before the talks even begin, 
if the national interest is really the priority." 
 
¶2.  Al Ayyam publishes an opinion piece by Hani Al Masri titled, 
"The common enemy:  Occupation, Fatah or Hamas?" (10/07): 
"Continuing the [internal Palestinian] division will lead to the 
destruction of everything... the main beneficiary, if not the only 
one, is the occupation.  Division won't lead to the ascension of 
Hamas and downfall of Fatah, but rather it will lead to the downfall 
and defeat of all parties of the Palestinian national movement, 
national and Islamic, to the benefit of Israeli alternatives, 
including first, the status quo with no solution, an Israeli 
uni-lateral solution, the reintroduction of the Jordanian option and 
Egyptian mandate, adoption of an international solution that serves 
Israeli interests, or a solution that reinforces a canton-state with 
temporary borders."
