SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (01/14): Senior US administration 
officials to meet with the Palestinian Authority leadership in the 
coming days 
 
------------ 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Independent daily Al-Quds reports that National Security Advisor Jim 
Jones and Special Envoy George Mitchell will visit the Palestinian 
territories. The report notes that Jones will have meetings in 
Ramallah today, while Mitchell will follow in few days. The coverage 
expects that Mitchell will submit signed letters from President 
Obama that serve as guarantees to all parties. Mitchell is also 
expected to submit proposals to resume negotiations to create an 
independent Palestinian state in two years. 
 
Palestinian Authority (PA) official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports 
that the Egyptian Foreign Minister and Egyptian Chief of 
Intelligence told Secretary Clinton it is too early to hold a 
trilateral meeting between President Abbas and Prime Minister 
Netanyahu brokered by Egyptian President Mubarak. 
 
The Palestinian press prominently reports that Sheikh Raed Salah, 
the leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel, was sentenced on 
Wednesday to nine months in prison and six months probation for 
incitement. In addition to the sentence, Salah was ordered to pay 
7,500 Israeli shekels. 
 
The dailies report on President Abbas' interview with Middle East 
News Agency in Egypt during which he criticized Hamas for 
obstructing national reconciliation and is quoted in the headlines 
saying that "Hamas stopped the resistance with hopes to gain 
legitimacy from the entire world." 
Abbas also reaffirmed that the PA will not agree to Hamas' 
concession to accept a state with temporary borders. 
 
In related news, the dailies report that Hamas officials in Gaza 
conducted intensive meetings with the Palestinian factions to reach 
a consensus for maintaining the truce with Israel to avoid any 
Israeli attacks. 
 
The dailies report that Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak 
announced yesterday that Israel will extend it operating hours at 
Tarqoumia checkpoint near Hebron to facilitate transferring goods to 
and from Hebron. 
 
Independent news agency Maan reports that its English desk Editor, 
American citizen Jared Malsin, was detained at Israel's Ben Gurion 
International Airport on Tuesday afternoon as he returned from the 
Czech Republic on holiday. After eight hours of interrogation, the 
Israeli Interior Ministry ordered him held and scheduled deportation 
for 6:00 am on Thursday. An injunction requested by Maan's attorney 
was rejected by the Israeli Attorney General, but that ruling was 
overturned by a Tel Aviv judge, granting Malsin a hearing. Judge 
Miriam Sokolov will hear Malsin's case at 10:00 am Thursday morning 
at the Tel Aviv District Court. A verdict is expected by noon.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Hamdi Farraj, writing in Al-Quds under the title "Netanyahu Will 
Kill the PA whether it Approves or Rejects Negotiations," believes 
that Israeli measures such as killing Palestinians, demolishing 
houses and confiscating lands will only lead to killing the PA 
regardless of whether or not it agrees to return to the negotiating 
table.
