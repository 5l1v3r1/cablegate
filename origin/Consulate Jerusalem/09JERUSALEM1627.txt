SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (09/10): New settlement units in 
East Jerusalem widely condemned in Palestinian press 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Ayyam runs front page news on "an unprecedented statement" made 
by Washington concerning Israeli settlement activity on September 9. 
The report notes that State Department Spokesman Ian Kelly stressed 
to the press that the Israeli government has to commit to a complete 
cessation of settlement activity within the 1967 borders. According 
to coverage, Kelly is quoted as saying that the US believes 
settlements are an obstacle to renewed peace talks between the 
Palestinians and Israelis. 
 
In related news, the dailies front page coverage on the Israeli 
government issuing tenders on September 9 for the construction of 
more than 480 housing units in the Pesgat Ze'ev settlement in East 
Jerusalem. The reports note that by pursuing these activities, the 
Israeli government is challenging the US, European and international 
positions that reject continued settlement activity. 
 
All front pages quote Palestinian Authority (PA) Presidency 
Spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina stating that President Mahmoud Abbas 
received an Egyptian proposal outlining the end to the Palestinian 
internal division. Abu Rudeina noted that the PA will respond to the 
proposal within two days. In its reporting, Al-Quds notes that the 
Executive Committee for the Palestinian Liberation Organization will 
convene today to discuss the proposal. According to Hamas officials, 
Hamas has not yet received the proposal.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title 
"Would the world give in to Israel?" (09/10): "The Europeans and 
Americans are cooperating with Israel's blackmailing policy. They 
are not willing to exert real pressure on Israel to achieve 
comprehensive peace on the ground. On the contrary, they are 
pressuring the Arab states to normalize relations with Israel even 
if the latter doesn't pledge to halt or freeze all settlement 
activity." 
 
2) Ibrahim Abu Sha'ban opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title "Activate the 7th chapter of UN convention" (09/10):"The 
international climate is conducive for the Arab states to ask the UN 
Security Council to impose sanctions against Israel due to their 
continued settlement activity. This action should not be delayed ... 
as nothing can be more harmful to international peace and security 
than settlement expansion. "
