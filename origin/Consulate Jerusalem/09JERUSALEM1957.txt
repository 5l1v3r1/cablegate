SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (10/29): President Abbas speaks at 
International Forum for Jerusalem 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The lead stories in all three dailies highlight President Abbas's 
speech at the International Forum for Jerusalem in Morocco 
yesterday. The headlines quote Abbas reiterating that the 
"Palestinian Authority (PA) is still willing to end the internal 
Palestinian division and achieve reconciliation with Hamas." Abbas 
also said that the increased "Israeli escalations in Jerusalem may 
lead to a religious war." In his speech, Abbas noted that the PA 
will consider options other than the two-state solution if Israel 
continues its refusal to compromise. 
 
Al-Quds front pages an interview with PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 
conducted by the Palestinian Studies Magazine. Fayyad is quoted as 
saying that General Dayton has nothing to do with the PA's security 
arrangements, noting that "Dayton works for us, we don't work for 
him." Fayyad noted that Dayton's job is to oversee the training 
process for the new members of the PA security forces. He noted that 
approximately 2000 security forces have been trained and selected by 
the PA itself, not by Dayton. 
 
All dailies front page news on a Hamas press release announcing that 
it won't allow any elections to take place in Gaza, noting that 
President Abbas's calls for elections are "illegal and 
illegitimate." 
 
All front pages run stories on a report released by the Israeli 
research institute Macro Center for Political Economics that shows 
there will be a Palestinian majority in Jerusalem in 20 years 
despite Israeli measures to diminish the Palestinian presence in the 
city. 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages news that negotiations between Hamas and Israel 
over a prisoners exchange deal are underway. 450 Palestinian 
prisoners would be released from Israeli jails in exchange for 
Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. The report notes that Israel has 
reservations over the names of 125 prisoners on the list. 
 
Hamas newspaper Al-Resalah runs a report on US pressure on President 
Abbas to make more compromises regarding the resumption of 
negotiations with Israel. The report also notes that the US told 
Abbas that they don't want the PA to sign a reconciliation agreement 
with Hamas unless the latter recognizes Israel.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title " 
Jerusalem ... the Scale for Peace and War!": (29/10): "The Israeli 
measures in Jerusalem, including home demolitions and attempts to 
diminish the Palestinian identity, must be an incentive to all 
Palestinian leaders to put an end to the people's misery and 
prioritize national unity." 
 
2) Omar Al-Ghoul opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under 
the title "Hamas, Where is the Truth?" "Hamas and its officials are 
lying about its reservations on the national reconciliation 
agreement because the truth contradicts its beliefs and policies. 
Hamas should stop the lies and explain its real position to the 
people regarding its refusal to sign the reconciliation agreement."
