SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/16): The Palestinian Authority 
considers declaring an independent state at the UN Security Council 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with news on Palestinian 
officials reiterating that they will pursue a unilateral declaration 
of a Palestinian state at the UN Security Council. The three dailies 
report on Israel's reaction to this announcement, reporting that 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that "Israel too can take on 
unilateral actions" implying that Israel may reoccupy the West Bank 
areas that are under the Palestinian Authority if such a move is 
made. Al-Quds reports on Hamas criticizing the Palestinian 
Authority's (PA) plan to resort to the UN Security Council for the 
declaration of the Palestinian state. 
 
The dailies quote US Senator Joseph Lieberman reaffirming America's 
commitment to the two-state solution, applauding "the positive role 
played by the Palestinian Authority and its efforts to build state 
institutions" while visiting the West Bank on Sunday with a 
Congressional delegation. 
 
Al-Quds runs a lead photo of former President Clinton visiting 
Al-Aqsa mosque yesterday. The report notes that Clinton urged Israel 
to give President Obama a chance and stop dealing with him as an 
"enemy." Clinton noted that it is possible to resolve the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict during Obama's era. 
 
Al-Ayyam leads with the Head of the Palestinian National Council 
Salim Az Zanoun noting that the Palestinian Liberation Organization 
(PLO) Central Committee will convene on December 15 to discuss the 
constitutional vacuum that may occur by not holding the elections in 
January 2010. Fatah leader Mohammad Dahlan is quoted as saying that 
the Central Committee will extend President Abbas' term if the 
elections are not held on time. 
 
The dailies report that the Jerusalem municipality distributed 
demolition orders for two houses in the Old City. 
 
News on Egypt inviting the Palestinian factions to visit Cairo to 
pursue the national dialogue next week is reported in all three 
dailies.

Weekend stories: 
----------------- 
 
Sunday, November 15: 
 
The three dailies lead with front page stories on the Palestinian 
people celebrating the 21st anniversary of the declaration of 
independence. On this occasion, President Abbas called upon the 
international community to intensify their efforts to enable the 
Palestinian people to end the occupation and achieve their rights 
and national objectives. President Abbas added that without 
realizing these rights on the basis of justice and fairness, the 
entire region will not enjoy stability or prosperity. President 
Abbas also stressed that national unity is the primary way to 
guarantee success, according to coverage. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam report on Hamas accusing Israel of fabricating 
information to lay the groundwork for a new military attack against 
the Gaza Strip. Fawzi Barhoum, the spokesperson for Hamas in the 
Gaza Strip, said in a statement to the press that Israel's claims 
that Hamas conducted a second attempt to launch a long-range Iranian 
 
JERUSALEM 00002047  002 OF 003 
 
 
missile indicate Israel's intentions to escalate its aggression 
against the strip. Barhoum called upon Arab and Muslim countries to 
cut their ties and relations with Israel, adding "these claims are 
part of the Israeli lies to justify a new aggression against Gaza." 
 
Saturday, November 14: 
 
The three dailies run front page stories on statements made by Under 
Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns in an 
interview with the Washington Post reaffirming the US commitment to 
the two-state solution. Coverage notes that Burns added that the US 
considers the Israeli offer to restrain settlement activities as a 
potentially important step, but it falls short of fulfilling their 
Road Map obligations. Burns also stressed that US pressure on Israel 
and the Palestinians are necessary for success. 
 
The dailies report that the US is now open to a conference on the 
peace process in Moscow. According to unnamed French sources, the US 
believes that holding a conference in Moscow coupled with the 
postponement of the Palestinian elections will allow President Abbas 
the chance to continue his duties until the elections are held. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs a front page story on Saeb Erekat, head of the PLO 
Negotiations Affairs Department, saying that the Palestinian 
leadership is currently working on getting wide support for the idea 
of going to the UN Security Council to gain international 
recognition for the State of Palestine on the 1967 borders with East 
Jerusalem as its capital. Erekat noted that the decision is "a huge 
accomplishment with wide and unprecedented Arab consensus supporting 
this idea." Erekat told Al-Ayyam that he discussed the idea several 
times with the Americans and the Europeans, while President Abbas 
raised the idea with the UN Secretary General and Russian officials, 
both receiving positive reactions. Erekat added that President Abbas 
will target Latin American countries next week in addition to 
on-going discussions with European countries. 
 
The three dailies run front page stories on reports in the Jerusalem 
Post on Friday that settlement activities in East Jerusalem have not 
stopped despite claims by the Israeli Minister of Housing that the 
Israeli authorities have not authorized any construction project in 
the West Bank or East Jerusalem since Netanyahu came into office. 
According to reports, an Israeli NGO that works for equal rights for 
Israelis and Palestinians in Jerusalem said that "there are more 
than 20 new projects in East Jerusalem that await the municipality's 
approval" and that "it is expected that almost all these projects 
will be approved. The only remaining question is about the timing." 
 
 
The three dailies run front page stories on Israeli Army Chief of 
Staff Gabi Ashkenazi threatening to launch a military operation 
against the Gaza Strip if rockets continue to be launched from the 
territory. Ashkenazi added that Hamas suspended its rocket attacks 
against Israel after the January war and is restraining the other 
Palestinian factions from doing so. According to reports, the rare 
Israeli admission about Hamas actions to restrain the launching of 
rockets comes at a time when both sides continue their indirect 
negotiations on the prisoners' exchange deal through Egyptian and 
German mediators.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "More 
 
JERUSALEM 00002047  003 OF 003 
 
 
Time Means Encouraging Israel" (11/16): "The recent statements by US 
officials that the US doesn't want to push for Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations for the sake of negotiations, and that they prefer to 
wait until the two parties are ready for such talks, proves that the 
US policy is wrong. Waiting any longer will grant Israel more time 
to construct settlements and commit more violations ... When the US 
and the international community have the courage to say "enough" of 
the occupation and stop the double standards when dealing with 
Israel, only then will the US commitment to peace have a meaning."
