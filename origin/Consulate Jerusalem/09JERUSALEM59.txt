SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE -- JANUARY 1 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: OCHA estimated that 80 truckloads of supplies 
would enter Gaza via Kerem Shalom on January 1, including three 
truckloads of medical supplies.  Karni and Nahal Oz were closed by 
the GOI for the sixth consecutive day, and will remain closed for 
security issues, according to UNRWA.  UNRWA resumed food 
distributions throughout Gaza on January 1. 
 
Crossings 
--------- 
¶2. (SBU) OCHA contacts estimated that 80 truckloads of supplies 
would enter Gaza through Kerem Shalom on January 1. (Note: COGAT 
reported to Embassy Tel Aviv that Kerem Shalom closed early, which 
may lower the final count. End Note.)  A total of 84 truckloads 
entered Kerem Shalom on December 31.  Four tons of medical supplies 
and 10 ambulances from Libya entered through Rafah crossing on 
December 31, and Rafah was open for evacuees and for the entry of 
medical supplies on January 1.  Karni and Nahal Oz crossings 
remained closed for the sixth straight day, and UNRWA contacts 
report that the GOI confirmed it will not open Karni or Nahal Oz 
because of security issues.  UNRWA will coordinate with COGAT to use 
the small conveyor belt at Kerem Shalom to transfer grain, but warns 
25 percent is likely to be lost in spillage. 
 
UNRWA Restarts Food Distribution 
-------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) On January 1, UNRWA resumed food distributions (suspended 
since December 18) for 20,000 people at ten locations throughout 
Gaza.  UNRWA has sufficient stocks of flour donations from 
neighboring countries and the WFP to continue distributions for the 
next ten days, but there is still a backlog of items to be 
distributed.  WFP distributed bread in Beit Hanoun on December 31, 
but has not resumed wider distributions. 
 
Fuel and Water Supplies 
----------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) WHO contacts say food and fuel are the most pressing needs 
for Gazans.  With Nahal Oz closed for fuel transfers, UNRWA contacts 
are discussing with COGAT the possibility of transporting 200,000 
liters of industrial diesel using a back-to-back system through 
Kerem Shalom.  UNRWA is in contact with Gaza power plant officials 
to determine what quantity of diesel is needed on a daily basis. 
OCHA contacts report that airstrikes have damaged power lines, 
causing 24 hour/day power cuts in some areas.  GEDCO (Gaza's main 
power distributor) is reportedly facing difficulty repairing power 
equipment because of security and lack of spare parts. 
 
¶5. (SBU) OCHA contacts report that sewage water is pouring into the 
streets in Beit Hanoun following damage to the main pipeline between 
Beit Hanoun and the Beit Lahiya wastewater treatment plant on 
December 31.  Gaza's sewage and water utility company (CMSWU) 
reported January 1 that all of Gaza City has been without running 
water for the past two days, because of lack of fuel for pumps and 
spare parts.  UNRWA will give the utility company 30,000 liters of 
diesel on January 2, which will allow the water pumps to operate 
again.  CMSWU also reported that current supplies of chlorine will 
last only three more days.
