SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (12/31): PA Spokesman states that 
positive developments ahead for the peace process

Main Stories: 
------------ 
 
The three dailies continue to lead with reports on the positive 
signals after the meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt on Tuesday. 
Independent daily Al-Quds quotes Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Presidency Spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina stating that there will be 
positive developments regarding the peace process in the coming two 
weeks. Reports also note that US Special Envoy George Mitchell will 
be back in the region in January. 
 
The three dailies front page news citing Israeli radio that 
Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat reiterated during a visit to Gilo 
yesterday that the construction in Jerusalem, including the Old 
City, will not stop and that US condemnations won't change the 
municipality's plans. Al-Quds quotes the PA official for Jerusalem 
Ahmad Rouwaydi stating that the Jerusalem municipality budget for 
2010 includes funds to demolish more Palestinian homes in Jerusalem. 
 
 
In related news, the dailies report on settlers from Carni Shamron 
near Jerusalem uprooting and stealing more than 150 olive trees that 
belong to a Palestinian farmer yesterday. 
 
PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with news on the prisoner 
exchange deal. The reports note that after the Hamas leaders met in 
Damascus to discuss Israel's response on the deal, Hamas official 
Ayman Taha said that Hamas did not approve Israel's offer and asked 
the German mediator to continue his discussions with Israel to reach 
an agreement. 
 
Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa is quoted in the dailies 
saying that the UN must play a bigger role in solving the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and that the US should not be the only 
mediator. 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Al-Quds runs an editorial under the title "What Improvement in the 
Israeli Position?" raising skepticism regarding the Israeli Prime 
Minister's readiness to resume peace talks. The writer is 
pessimistic that Prime Minister Netanyahu will compromise to support 
the negotiations. He also notes that President Obama's promises have 
all disappeared and that his positions now are very similar to 
Israel's official positions.

Palestine Cyberspace: 
--------------------- 
 
This week, Palestinian cyberspace focused on the "Viva Palestina" 
freedom march to Gaza and the first anniversary of the Gaza War. 
 
Many social media sites carried an interview with the Gaza Freedom 
March Steering Committee member and English Language Professor in 
Al-Azhar University in Gaza, Dr. Haider Eid. When asked about his 
message to Israel, Dr. Eid said "Peace without justice is not 
peace."
