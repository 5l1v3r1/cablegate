REF: JERUSALEM 1093 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Fatah and Hamas-aligned gunmen traded 
kidnappings and drive-by shootings in Gaza City June 7-8. 
Gunmen allegedly associated with the Presidential Guard (PG) 
kidnapped two Hamas members, and the "Executive Force" 
kidnapped a PG soldier.  Drive-by shootings and preparations 
of rooftop fighting positions continue as of 1400 local. 
Palestinian radio/newspaper reports carried Hamas statements 
criticizing NSA Muhammad Dahlan for stirring up factional 
tensions before Fatah-Hamas talks planned in Cairo. 
Palestinian militants fired at least 3 Qassam rockets and two 
mortars into Israel (no injuries or property damage 
reported), and the IDF killed a PIJ militant near Sufa and 
reportedly killed another militant in northern Gaza.  The IDF 
did not allow newspapers for the three major Palestinian 
dailies into Gaza June 7-8.  End summary. 
 
Kidnapping, Clashes in Gaza City 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gunmen (whom Hamas claim are members of the PG) 
kidnapped two Hamas members in Gaza City June 7, and shot one 
in the foot.  The "Executive Force" kidnapped PG soldier Izz 
Abu Shanab early June 8.  Unknown gunmen also shot and 
injured two Hamas members in al-Shati Camp late June 7. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Follow-Up Committee (with Fatah, Hamas, other 
factions and Egyptian representatives) told Palestinian press 
June 7-8 that it is working to cool tensions.  According to 
Palestinian security contacts, Fatah/PASF and 
Hamas/"Executive Force" gunmen occupied rooftop firing 
positions in Gaza City June 7-8 in anticipation of escalating 
factional fighting. 
 
Hamas Incitement Against Dahlan 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Palestinian radio and newspapers reported Hamas 
statements criticizing NSA Muhammad Dahlan for stirring up 
factional tensions ahead of Fatah-Hamas talks planned in 
Cairo.  The statements accuse Dahlan of collaborating with 
the U.S. and Israel to import armaments for Fatah forces and 
accuse Dahlan of ordering attacks on Hamas members, because 
Hamas refused to include him in the Cairo talks. 
 
IDF Blocks Papers from Entering Gaza 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The IDF did not allow newspapers for the three 
major Palestinian dailies (al-Quds, al-Hayyat al-Jadida and 
al-Ayyam) into Gaza June 7-8.  Media reports indicate that 
continuing violence at Erez Crossing is interfering with the 
newspapers' transfer into Gaza, and that the alternative 
entry point--Karni/al-Mintar--is unattractive to the 
newspaper publishers because of fees associated with its use. 
 
Rockets/Mortars Strike Sderot Area; 
IDF Kills PIJ Gunman 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Palestinian militants fired at least 3 Qassam 
rockets and two mortars into Israel as of 1400 local on June 
8, but these did not cause injuries or property damage. 
Press reports state that 20-year-old PIJ militant Faris Abu 
Bakir was shot and killed by the IDF near Sufa crossing on 
June 7.  Israeli radio reports said the IDF killed an 
additional Palestinian gunmen near the perimeter fence in 
northern Gaza early June 8.
