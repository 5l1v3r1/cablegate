SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/24):  Prisoner Exchange and 
Settlement Freeze Dominate Coverage Despite Cynicism 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------Dailies prominently lead with news that the prisoner 
exchange deal will be concluded in coming days. Reports note that a 
Hamas delegation went to Cairo yesterday to meet with the German 
mediator. 
 
Dailies report, quoting Israeli sources, that the legal advisor of 
the GOI has completed military orders calling for a settlement 
freeze in West Bank areas, excluding Jerusalem, in preparation for a 
possible resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.  The 
coverage notes that the orders will be prepared in coordination with 
the Israeli cabinet.  Al-Ayyam reports that Israel has approved a 
10-month settlement freeze proposal, excluding Jerusalem, which will 
be presented to the Israeli cabinet for endorsement. 
 
Dailies report on yesterday's PA cabinet meeting in which the 
cabinet rejected all interim solutions proposed lately by Israeli 
officials. 
 
Dailies report on President Abu Mazen visit to Argentina.  During 
his meeting with Argentine President Cristina Kirchner, Abbas stated 
that Israel must stop all settlement activity including natural 
growth and abide by its road map obligations.  The Argentine 
President opined that the US should do more to ensure the resumption 
of peace negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. 
 
Independent daily Al-Ayyam front pages yesterday's announcement by 
the PA cabinet that on Sunday the United Arab Emirate (UAE 
transferred financial assistance to the PA treasury, valued at 100 
million euros.  During its weekly meeting yesterday, the cabinet 
expressed gratitude and appreciation to the UAE for its generous 
support. 
 
Al-Quds reports that Hamas Minister of Interior, Fathi Hammad, has 
convinced other Palestinian factions to halt rocket attacks against 
Israel. 
 
Ma'an and dailies report that Israeli authorities banned Fatah 
official for Jerusalem Affairs, Hatem Abdul Qader, from coming 
within 150 meters of the Al-Aqsa Mosque for the next six months. 
Abdul Qader was arrested by Israeli authorities three times in 
recent months during confrontations with Israeli soldiers at the 
Mosque.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam ran a number of op-ed today that focused on the 
status and history of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and attempts 
by the Palestinian Authority to seek UN recognition of the 
establishment of a Palestinian state. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs an editorial under the title "Reviving the intiative" 
in which it outlines the factors that hurt the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations.  In the editors' view, one of the main factors was 
President Obama's retreat from calling for a stop of all new 
settlement construction as a precondition for the negotiations. 
"Obama's reversal shocked the Palestinian leadership" and ended all 
hopes for successful and meaningful negotiations.  The editorial 
 
JERUSALEM 00002113  002 OF 002 
 
 
calls on Palestinians to maximize the worldwide support they have 
received and move forward in requesting UN recognition of a 
Palestinian state. 
 
Hani Al-Masri, another opinion leader, opined in  Al-Ayyam under the 
title " It is Early to Note a Failure of Negotiations" that it is 
premature to predict the failure of the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations despite all the challenges.  In his opinion, moderate 
Arab States who have signed agreements with Israel won't allow the 
negotiations to fail. 
 
Hana Issa, professor of international law at Birzeit University, in 
a commentary in independent daily Al-Quds, opined that the 
international community must take effective steps to end the Israeli 
occupation of Palestinian lands in keeping with international law 
and should exert more pressure on Israel, as the occupying 
authority, to respect United Nation resolutions. 
 
Naji Shurrab opines in Al-Quds under the title "What remains of 
negotiations?" (11/24): "Negotiations are important and remain an 
option...however; the US wasn't a balanced and neutral mediator 
because of its bias towards Israel, which contributed to the failure 
of the negotiations...For negotiations to succeed, the whole climate 
must change and the US must learn from the past how to take a 
balanced role in managing the negotiations."
