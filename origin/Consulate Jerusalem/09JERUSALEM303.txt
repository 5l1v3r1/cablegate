SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/19):  "NEW ISRAELI OBSTACLES 
SHOULD NOT DELAY [INTERNAL UNITY] TALKS" 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida lead with the Israeli cabinet 
decision to link the opening of Gaza crossings and any Gaza truce 
ce 
 
agreement to the release of Israeli soldier Shalit.  Palestinian 
Authority Presidency spokesman Abu Rudaynah responded that Israel 
should be held responsible for any deterioration in conditions in 
the Gaza Strip caused by the new policy, the papers report.  Al 
Ayyam reports on the scolding of Israeli negotiator Amos Gilad by 
Israeli Premier Olmert, for publically calling the cabinet decision, 
"madness and an insult to Egypt."  The paper adds that Gaza 
crossings will remain open for humanitarian assistance.  A related 
DPA story on Al Ayyam's front page notes UN peace envoy Serry's 
warnings that any Gaza cease-fire that is not sustainable may lead 
to renewed war. 
 
Al Ayyam leads with Egypt's decision to delay internal Palestinian 
talks that were scheduled for February 22 in Cairo.  All front pages 
note that the delay is for at least two days with no new date 
specified.  The papers quote an "Egyptian source" explaining that 
the delay would increase the chances of success in achieving 
reconciliation.  The three papers quote Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Abbas stating on February 18 that PLO factions will go to Cairo, 
"with open minds and hearts" to form a Palestinian government that 
will not be the target of sanctions, will hold new elections and 
speed up Gaza reconstruction.  The papers also noted that Abbas 
called on a halt to "hostile media campaigns" among factions and 
that he will begin a new international tour to raise funds for the 
PA. 
 
The U.S. might accept a new Palestinian technocrat government that 
would not include any Fatah or Hamas members, according to a Reuters 
report on Al Ayyam's and Al Hayat Al Jadida's front pages.  The 
report cites an American official, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, as its source.  According to the official, such a 
government must accept the two-state solution.  Should a new 
government include Hamas members, they would need to agree to the 
Middle East Quartet's three requirements, the report concludes. 
All the papers front page reports about Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Premier Fayyad signing an agreement with banks to deliver assistance 
directly to Gazans as part of a PA plan for Gaza reconstruction, 
that includes mechanisms to bypass Hamas.  The papers remind readers 
that the plan will be presented at the March donors' conference in 
Cairo and that Fayyad has also called on donor countries to provide 
direct assistance that will bypass Hamas in Gaza. 
 
Al Quds' front page runs a report on "Israel's unyielding position" 
to destroy East Jerusalem's Bustan neighborhood in Silwan in order 
to make a public park.  The plan would destroy 100 houses, 
sheltering 1,500 Palestinians.  The paper further adds that the 
Israeli municipality of Jerusalem rejected an alternate plan for 
urban development submitted by neighborhood residents in 2005.  In 
other settlement news, Al Quds reports that a lower Israeli court 
will hearing the case of 29 Palestinian families who claim ownership 
of their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, 
refuting ownership claims by an "Israeli settlement society." 
Meanwhile, Al Ayyam's front page reports that the PLO Executive 
Committee renewed calls for a halt to Israeli settlement activities 
on February 18. 
 
The visit by Congressmen Baird and Ellison is the subject of inside 
reports in Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida.  The papers report that 
PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat met on February 18 with U.S. Consul

General Jake Walles and the Congressmen.  The papers note that 
Erekat briefed the guests on the latest developments regarding 
Israeli settlement activities, checkpoints, "the siege" and 
closures.  Erekat also called on the international community to 
reject any Israeli government that will not commit to the two-state 
solution and previous agreements.  The three dailies also report 
that Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Al Malki met with the 
Congressmen and briefed them on "latest developments" and the urgent 
need for a peaceful solution to the Middle East conflict. 
In Israeli military operation news, Al Quds' and Al Ayyam's front 
pages report on two Israeli airstrikes on Gaza/Egypt border tunnels 
and a Hamas security compound in Gaza.  The papers also report that 
Israel arrested 30 Palestinians in several West Bank towns on 
February 18. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page runs a Reuters story quoting the 
Executive Director of Boeing announcing that Israel has requested 
that Boeing provide Israel with a new "smart arms" system and that 
such a sale is being prepared.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al Quds' editorial is titled,"New Israeli obstacles shouldn't 
delay talks"(02/19):  "[Israel] Hindering truce efforts means, in 
practical terms, that [Gaza] reconstruction will be delayed... 
however, the first consequence of the Israeli obstacle, is the 
announcement by Cairo to delay [internal Palestinian] talks 
scheduled for February 22... We believe that dialogue is a national 
top-priority, especially in light of the positive steps begun at 
[recent]senior-level meetings between Fatah and Hamas in Cairo and 
Ramallah." 
2) Talal Okal opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Launching a 
preemptive [political] strike on Israel"(02/19):  "Palestinians 
should mobilize their [resources by]... ending division so that 
Arabs and the international community must own their responsibility 
to confront the challenges that will visit evils on all 
Palestinians.  Within the framework of declaring a political war, 
[we will] need to come up with a mechanism for filing a case against 
Israeli war criminals [for acts committed in the recent conflict in 
Gaza] before the international war crimes court."
