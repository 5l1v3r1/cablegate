¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Strawberries exported from Gaza this 
harvest have been of lower quality that previous years, 
reportedly as a result of the lack of fertilizer and poor 
handling procedures at the Kerem Shalom crossing.  Gaza 
farmers continue to export cut carnation flowers, but have 
not been able to export bell peppers and tomatoes this 
harvest season, most of which have gone to waste.  End 
summary. 
 
Strawberries Limited; Flowers Still Moving 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gaza-based USG contractors told Econoff that six 
truckloads of strawberries were shipped through Kerem Shalom 
crossing on December 13, the first such shipments since 
December 6.  Gaza strawberry exports, which had begun on 
November 28 (reftel), were halted December 7-12 following a 
refusal by the marketing company to purchase additional 
shipments.  The marketing company had reported that 50 
percent of the strawberries purchased from Gaza were spoiling 
prior to delivery to points of sale in Europe. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ConGen contacts believe that the strawberries' 
quality problems are a result of a lack of fertilizer, 
pesticides, and greenhouse supplies due to restrictions on 
imports into Gaza, as well as the transfer system at Kerem 
Shalom crossing, where shipments remain un-refrigerated for 
up to eight hours.  Gaza's 250 strawberry farmers earned 
approximately USD 325,000 from exports over the November 28 - 
December 6 period.  (By comparison, the last strawberry 
harvest totaled USD eight million in export sales.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Gaza farmers have exported roughly 1.4 million cut 
carnations, valued at USD 120,000, from Kerem Shalom crossing 
since November 28.  According to Gaza-based contacts, the 
flowers require less fertilizer than the strawberries and are 
better able to withstand the crossing than strawberries due 
to their packaging. 
 
Most Bell Peppers and Tomatoes Go To Waste 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) There have been no shipments out of Gaza of bell 
peppers, cherry tomatoes, or sweet tomatoes this harvest. 
USG contractors in Gaza report that some peppers and tomatoes 
have been sold in Gaza for minimal prices, but that roughly 
90 percent of this year's harvest has spoiled.
