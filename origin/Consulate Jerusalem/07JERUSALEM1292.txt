KAREN ABUZAYD: USD 40 MILLION COMMITTMENT AND USG SUPPORT 
 
 
 ¶1. (U) In a June 21 meeting with UNRWA Commissioner General 
Karen AbuZayd, the Consul General confirmed the USG 
contribution of $40 million to UNRWA's 2007 Emergency Appeal 
and reaffirmed the USG commitment to Palestinians in the West 
Bank and Gaza.  AbuZayd expressed appreciation for continuing 
USG support, which she said will help provide much-need food, 
health services, and employment opportunities.  She said 
UNRWA's Gaza operations have resumed following the violence 
that accompanied Hamas' take-over of Gaza, a small number of 
international staff have returned to Gaza, and local Gaza 
staff are resuming summer program plans. 
 
¶2. (SBU) AbuZayd said finding a solution to the problem of 
crossings at Gaza will be critical for the requisite 
quantities of food and other assistance to reach Gazans, and 
she hopes the Karni/al Mintar crossing will reopen soon to 
avoid a depletion of available food stocks.  She added that 
exclusive use of the Kerem Shalom crossing will be inadequate 
to meet humanitarian needs, because it cannot handle enough 
truckloads per day.  The Consul General said the issue of 
security on the Palestinian side of the crossings will likely 
be a problem for the foreseeable future. 
 
¶3. (U)  Local Palestinian daily newspaper Al-Ayyam 
(circulation 22,000) and Ma'an online news, which has the 
highest readership among Palestinians news websites, covered 
the meeting between the Consul General and UNRWA ComGen, 
highlighting the Consul General's statement that the USG's 
"continued commitment to UNRWA illustrates our concern for 
the welfare of the Palestinian people, especially those in 
Gaza."  Press reports quoted AbuZayd as stating that UNRWA is 
"immensely grateful for this generous contribution for our 
severely underfunded Emergency Appeal."  All local media 
outlets also featured prominent coverage of the Secretary's 
June 18 annoucement.
