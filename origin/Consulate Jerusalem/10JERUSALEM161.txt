pressure from the US to resume negotiations 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------Independent daily Al-Ayyam and Palestinian Authority 
(PA) official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front page news on Fatah 
Central Committee member Nabil Shaath noting in a press statement 
yesterday that PA President Mahmoud Abbas is facing US pressure to 
resume peace talks with Israel without a full cessation in 
settlement activity. Shaath noted that the Palestinian leadership 
will not give in to this pressure and will not return to 
negotiations as long as settlement activities continue. 
 
The dailies report on PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's meeting with 
the French Prime Minister in Paris yesterday. Fayyad reiterated that 
the PA is committed to the success of the peace process, ending the 
occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state on the 
1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital. Fayyad urged the 
international community to force Israel to respect its Road Map 
obligations, especially a freeze on all settlement activity. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that the Israeli authorities are 
preparing to expand schools in West Bank settlements in the coming 
months. The Ministry of Defense approved the expansion of 35 
educational institutions in preparation for the next school year. 
 
The dailies continue to report on settlers' attacks against 
Palestinian villages and citizens. Al-Ayyam reports that Israeli 
authorities submitted demolition orders to Burin village near Nablus 
to demolish a mosque and several warehouses. In Hebron, 15 settlers 
attacked Palestinians from Tweneh village yesterday and in Ramallah, 
settlers attacked a Palestinian car near Beitello village. 
 
The dailies report on the launch of a popular campaign to show 
solidarity with Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails under the 
title "No resumption of negotiations without the release of 
prisoners." The campaign will include several events today, 
including a two hour strike in all West Bank governorates. 
 
Independent news agency Maan and Al-Quds run front page stories 
citing Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth on the statement made by the 
Consulate General Jerusalem's Regional Security Officer regarding 
the incident last November at the Jalameh Crossing. The story quotes 
the RSO saying that he doesn't agree with having Israeli security 
forces inspect US Consulate vehicles and employees.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
PLO Executive Committee member and Vice President of the PFLP 
Abdelrahim Malouh, writing in Al-Quds under the title "What do the 
Palestinian People Want from Mitchell?" opines that the Palestinian 
leadership and people should say no to Special Envoy George 
Mitchell's proposal whether it includes direct or indirect 
negotiations. Malouh believes that Palestinians should not trust the 
US and its envoys anymore because they have been biased toward 
Israel on every issue.
