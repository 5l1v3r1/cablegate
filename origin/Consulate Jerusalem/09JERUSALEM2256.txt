SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (12/11):  Additional Funds For 
West Bank Settlements Dominates Palestinian Media 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
------------ 
Settlements 
------------ 
 
The main story in all three dailies is Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu announcing yesterday that he will allocate an additional 
$28 million to support settlements in the West Bank.  The dailies 
quote Ahmad Qurei, member of the PLO Central Committee, reiterating 
that the proposed additional allocation undermines efforts of the 
international community to revive the peace process.  Saeb Erekat, 
PLO Chief Negotiator, noted that Netanyahu's announcement of 
allocating additional funds for the West Bank settlements proves 
that the moratorium is only a trick to deceive the U.S. 
administration. 
 
Independent daily Al-Quds runs a headline citing the Israeli 
grassroots Peace Now Movement that 3,492 settlement units will be 
established during the moratorium. 
 
 
------------- 
Prisoner Swap 
------------- 
 
Palestinian Authority (PA) official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports 
that, according to well-informed Palestinian sources, agreement on 
the Israeli-Hamas prisoner swap is stuck on five controversial 
issues: 
- Israel's refusal to release 10 senior leaders, including 
Barghouti; 
- Israel's refusal to release five female prisoners, accused of 
killing Israeli soldiers; 
- Israel's refusal to ease its siege on Gaza; 
- The length of time released prisoners would be required to remain 
outside of West Bank and/or Gaza following release; and, 
- Israel's refusal to guarantee that it will not re-arrest or 
assassinate any of the released prisoners if they remain in the West 
Bank and Gaza.

UNRWA Commissioner General Visits Sheikh Jarrah 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
Dailies report that Karen AbuZayd, Commissioner General of the U.N. 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East 
(UNRWA), conducted her last official visit as the head of the relief 
agency, to Palestinian families evicted from their homes in the East 
Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.  AbuZayd expressed her 
sorrow for Israeli actions in East Jerusalem.  Ma'an reports that 
Israeli police gave AbuZayd five minutes to leave the home of 
Al-Kurd family during the visit. 
 
 
--------------------- 
Nobel Prize Ceremony 
 
JERUSALEM 00002256  002 OF 003 
 
 
--------------------- 
 
All three dailies include coverage of President Obama's speech 
during the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony.  Al Ayyam is the only daily 
that carries it as a front page story (below the fold).  Al-Quds 
runs photos and an article on its back page.  The article 
entitled,"Obama Humbly Accepts Nobel Prize and Recognizes the Debate 
About His Selection" summarizes the main points of the speech. 
 
 
----------------------- 
National Reconciliation 
------------------------ 
 
Dailies and Ma'an report that according to the head of the 
Palestinian Reconciliation Committee, Iyad As-Serraj, talks between 
Hamas and Fatah could resume within days if both parties agree to a 
bilateral meeting. 
 
------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
Ali Badwan, writing in Al-Quds under the title "Palestinians and 
d 
Future Choices" opines that President Abbas' announcement not to run 
in the next elections proves that attempts to achieve a political 
solution to the problems in the Middle East, the Palestinian 
-Israeli conflict in particular, have reached a dead end. 
 
 
----------------------- 
Palestinian Cyberspace: 
----------------------- 
 
The main issues being discussed in Palestinian social media are the 
EU Statement and original Swedish proposal and settler activities; 
attention to prisoner swap news decreased. 
 
EU Statement:  Palestinian bloggers did not explicitly attack or 
praise the EU Statement and the original Swedish draft; rather they 
focused on the positive outcomes of the final statement.  In an 
interview on bitterlemons.com, which was later posted on Ma'an, 
Mahdi Abdul Hadi, head of the Palestinian Academic Society for the 
Study of International Affairs (PASSIA) in Jerusalem characterized 
the Swedish draft as: "...a wake-up call from Sweden to the rest of 
the European community about the status of Jerusalem today."

An Op-ed by Hasan Abu Nimh, former permanent representative of 
Jordan to the United Nations, entitled "Another EU Policy Statement 
Will Not Stop Israel's Colonization" was also widely circulated. 
(The op-ed was originally published in The Jordan Times and 
published on the blog with the author's permission.)

And, an op-ed by Ghassan Al-Khatib, Director of the Government Media 
Center, was popular among Palestinian Twitters:

Settler activities:  Palestinian Twitters circulated several 
articles and videos focusing on settler activities in West Bank. 
Al-Jazeera's online English site reported on Palestinian houses 
seized by settlers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGxF9eGzsfw.
