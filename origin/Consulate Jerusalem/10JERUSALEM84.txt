SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (01/15): General Jones reaffirms 
the U.S. commitment to the two state solution 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The dailies report on the meeting between Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Mahmoud Abbas and US National Security Advisor Jim Jones 
yesterday in Ramallah. Leading headlines report that Jones 
reiterated President Obama's commitment and determination to 
establish an independent Palestinian State. 
 
PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat said that Jones reaffirmed that the 
resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations is the best way to 
allow the US to help the Palestinians. PA Presidency spokesperson 
Nabil Abu Rudeina noted that Jones stressed that the US will 
continue its efforts to achieve peace in the region and will remain 
committed to the two state solution. 
 
Independent daily Al-Quds leads with President Abbas' statements 
during his interview with "Sawt Al-Arab-Arabs Voice" station in 
Egypt. Abbas said that the PA will resist US pressure to resume 
negotiations before a complete freeze in settlement activity and 
noted that the US pressure on the Palestinians to resume 
negotiations without a full freeze is "unfair". 
 
The dailies report that Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Husam 
Zaki told the press that the relationship between Hamas and Egypt 
has not reached a "dead end yet" despite the latest tension between 
them over the steel wall. Khaled Mishal, head of the Hamas political 
bureau, said he will visit Egypt immediately if invited. 
 
The Fatah Revolutionary Council will start a three day meeting today 
to follow up on the Fatah Sixth Party Congress held in Bethlehem 
last August. President Abbas and Fatah Central Committee members 
will participate in the meetings. The Council will also discuss the 
stalemate in the peace process and continued Israeli settlement 
activities. 
 
The dailies report that settlers from the Ma'oun settlement near 
Hebron uprooted 70 olive trees belonging to Palestinians yesterday.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Mouhammad Yaghi, writing in Al-Ayyam under the title "Why is the 
Prisoner Exchange Deal Obstructed?" believes that the international 
community is imposing pressure on Israel not to proceed with the 
deal until the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, 
arguing that they believe that the success of the deal will weaken 
the PA. 
 
----------------------- 
Palestinian Cyberspace: 
----------------------- 
 
This week, Palestinian cyberspace focused on the Israeli 
authorities' and settlers' "assaults" on Palestinians and the 
tension on the border between Egypt and Gaza. 
 
Many social media sites carried the Palestinian Centre for Human 
Rights' (PCHR) weekly report on Israeli human rights violations in 
the Palestinian Territories. 
Several blogs focused on the steel wall that Egypt is building on 
their border with Gaza. Khalid Amayreh, a journalist based in the 
Palestinian town of Dura, blogged on what he called the 
"Israeli-Egyptian blockade of the Gaza Strip."

On PalestineNote.com, George Hishmeh, a founding member of the 
Jerusalem Fund and former writer for the US Information Agency, 
blogged under the title "Obama talked the talk but hasn't walked the 
walk" saying, "What is needed here is more action by the Obama 
administration and fewer words."
