Military Developments 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.    (SBU) Israeli aircraft overnight August 14-15 fired 
rockets at a home in the Jabaliya refugee camp, destroying 
the house while damaging three neighboring structures.  At 
least 10 Palestinians were injured in the bombing.  The IDF 
claimed the house was used as a command center by the 
Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).  Israeli shelling in Beit 
Hanoun injured four Palestinians.  The IDF also continued 
operations near the Gaza airport, where Israeli units 
demolished six structures.  Ensuing clashes resulted in two 
Palestinian injuries.  The Hamas military wing claimed 
responsibility for detonating an explosive device that 
damaged an Israeli bulldozer near the airport. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) Palestinian militants have fired four Qassam 
rockets since the evening of August 14 from northern Gaza, 
resulting in no injuries or property damage.  Militants also 
fired an anti-tank missile at IDF units near the Erez 
crossing, resulting in no casualties.  ConGen contacts in the 
office of the PA president reported that the incident at Erez 
occurred approximately 10 minutes before President Abbas' 
convoy passed through the area. 
 
¶4.    (SBU) The PA Ministry of Health released a statement 
that, since the start of operation "Summer Rain" following 
the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit on June 25, over 190 
Palestinians have been killed and more than 790 injured in 
the course of IDF operations.  Among those killed were 58 
Palestinians under the age of 18 and 25 Palestinian women. 
 
¶5.    (SBU) In the West Bank, the IDF on August 15 initiated 
a raid into the Askar refugee camp in Nablus, arresting six 
Fatah activists.  During the operation, a 73-year-old 
Palestinian woman reportedly died from heart complications 
due to tear gas inhalation.  The IDF arrested at least two 
others, including a Palestinian carrying a knife at the 
entrance to the Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs in 
Hebron.  Palestinian militants also opened fire on IDF units 
operating in the northern West Bank on August 14.  There were 
no reported injuries.
