SUBJECT: PM FAYYAD AND HIS GOVERNMENT CONTINUE AFTER END OF 
EMERGENCY PERIOD 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Begin Summary.  Following expiration of the 30-day 
state of emergency declared on June 14, PA President Mahmud 
Abbas (Abu Mazen) accepted PM Salam Fayyad's resignation and 
then directed him to form a new government.  Until a new 
government receives a vote of confidence by the PLC -- which 
is unlikely to muster a quorum in the foreseeable future -- 
the current cabinet (including three new ministers sworn in 
on July 13) will continue to function.  Acting PLC speaker 
Ahmad Bahar (Hamas) called for a PLC session to be convened 
on July 15, but the session was suspended for lack of a 
67-member quorum.  The PLO Central Council will meet in 
Ramallah on July 18 and is expected to issue a statement 
supporting President Abbas and PM Fayyad's government.  End 
Summary. 
 
FAYYAD TO CONTINUE AS PM 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  According to PM Fayyad and sources in the 
President's office, following expiration of the state of 
emergency on July 13, President Abbas accepted PM Fayyad's 
resignation and subsequently tasked him to form a new 
government.  Abu Mazen's legal advisors told ConGen political 
specialist July 16 that the current government will continue 
until the PLC is able to meet and issue a vote of confidence 
for a new government.  They note that a meeting of the PLC is 
not likely to muster a quorum under current circumstances. 
President's office contacts say that by accepting PM Fayyad's 
resignation, Abu Mazen has agreed that PM Fayyad and the 
current cabinet, including three new ministers sworn in on 
July 13, will effectively continue to govern for the 
foreseeable future until a resolution to the Palestinian 
political crisis allows the PLC to convene. 
 
HAMAS REACTION 
-------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  In response to Abbas' decree, Hamas spokesman 
Fawzi Barhum called the Fayyad government "unlawful" and 
added that only the national unity government (which was 
headed by former PM Ismayil Haniyah) is legal.  On July 15, 
acting PLC speaker Ahmad Bahar (Hamas) called for a PLC 
session to discuss the legality of Abbas' state of emergency 
and presidential decrees, but just 30 minutes after he 
announced the session, Bahar suspended it for lack of a 
67-member quorum.  The session was attended by just 26 Hamas 
members in Gaza and another 5 in the West Bank (connected via 
video conference).  Bahar said that he will call for another 
PLC session later this week.  Hassan Khrayshah (independent), 
the second deputy PLC speaker, stated that he will also call 
for a PLC session this week. 
 
PLO CENTRAL COUNCIL TO CONVENE 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The PLO CC is scheduled to convene in Ramallah on 
July 18.  PA contacts told ConGen political specialist that 
five prominent PLO leaders, including Faruq al-Qaddumi, 
Muhammad Jihad and Muhammad Ghnaym from Fatah, Nayif Hawatmah 
from DFLP, and former Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) 
commander Muhammad Afanah have received permission from 
Israel to enter the West Bank to participate in the meeting. 
Sources said that they expect the PLO CC will express support 
for Abu Mazen and the Fayyad government, call for early PLC 
and PNC elections, discuss revitalizing the PLO structure, 
and address the issue of Fatah-Hamas dialogue.
