Main Stories:

All dailies carry extensive front page coverage and photos of the 
killing of a four-year old girl in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza 
Strip on June 5.  The dailies report that another civilian was also 
killed during a military operation in Gaza Strip.  All dailies carry 
"threats" made by Israeli Defense Minister Barak that, "a military 
operation in the Gaza Strip is closer now than at any other time in 
the past."  The dailies also report that an Israeli was killed and 
five others injured after a rocket was launched from Gaza into Nar 
Oz settlement. 
 
The dailies carry positive coverage of the "decision" made by 
Palestinian President Abbas to form a committee to, "follow up on 
implementation of his announcement on dialogue with Hamas."  Dailies 
also report that Hamas leader Ismael Haniyah, "welcomed the idea." 
Al-Quds carries an AFP story stating that, "the United States does 
not oppose talks between Fatah and Hamas."  Al-Quds also reveals the 
existence of an, "unwritten agreement between Abbas and Hamas leader 
Al-Zahhar, reached through Qatari mediation and Syrian support." 
The "agreement" is comprised of 18 points, including Hamas' 
acceptance of early Palestinian elections. 
 
The front pages of the dailies report that Palestinian President 
Abbas and Secretary Rice discussed developments in the peace process 
and Israeli settlement expansion in a June 5 telephone call. 
According to the coverage, Abbas demanded that Rice work to end 
Israeli settlement activities, including natural growth and push for 
implementation of the Road Map.  He confirmed Palestinian commitment 
to relevant international legal decisions, the Road Map plan, 
President Bush's vision for a Palestinian state and the Arab peace 
initiative, according to WAFA News Agency.  Al-Quds reports comments 
by Palestinian negotiator Sa'eb Erekat that allude to Barak Obama's 
AIPAC address, stating, "whoever considers Jerusalem to be the 
united capital of Israel closes the doors to peace."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1. Veteran columnist Mohammad Yaghi comments in independent Al-Ayyam 
under the headline, "Dialogue is primarily about the political 
agenda" (6/6):  "President Abbas' invitation to start a national 
dialogue and end the state of division is very timely.  There is a 
belief in Ramallah that Israel is not interested in a peace process 
that would end the occupation, and that the promises made by 
President Bush about a Palestinian state have never been truthful... 
this understanding was created by the acceleration of settlements in 
Jerusalem, despite the boring talks about peace post-Annapolis; by 
the immortalization of military barriers despite the talks about 
'investment'; and by the continued invasions of Palestinian cities 
despite the efforts exerted by Palestinian security forces to 
implement the Roadmap... There are three issues that must be 
endorsed by (Fatah and Hamas) before [talking] about details: 
First, both should admit the futility of one side trying to 
[dominate] the other,... Secondly, national unity, despite its 
importance and necessity, is not an alternative to a political 
program outlining the goals of the Palestinian people, ... Thirdly, 
it is not acceptable to any Palestinian party for Israel to export 
its [internal political] crisis to the Palestinian house." 
 
¶2.  Under Al Quds' main editorial entitled, "Demolishing houses... 
 
JERUSALEM 00000977  002 OF 002 
 
 
with the international community's stamp of approval,"(6/6): "Hardly 
a day passes by without the Palestinian media reporting on 
Palestinian houses being demolished by the Israeli authorities in 
Jerusalem, its periphery and the West Bank, or of reports about 
[demolition] threats and warnings issued to hundreds, probably 
thousands of home-owners...  This is accompanied by endless 
announcements for plans to build thousands of housing units in 
Jewish settlements on land occupied since the 1967 June war 
[despite] Security Council resolutions 242 and 338...  This 
phenomenon [of Israeli violations] ... should not be allowed to pass 
unnoticed... remaining silent on this policy, is not acceptable.  It 
is the duty of concerned Palestinians, Arab and European parties and 
all other friendly nations interested in easing Palestinian 
suffering to act decisively in bringing this issue before 
international organizations."
