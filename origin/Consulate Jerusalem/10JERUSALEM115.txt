SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (01/20): Israeli authorities level 
a large area of land on university grounds in East Jerusalem 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Independent daily Al-Quds leads with news that the Israeli 
authorities leveled a large area of land on the grounds of Al-Quds 
University in Beit-Hanina yesterday in preparation for a new bypass 
road that connects the Neveh Yacov and Pisgat Ze'ev settlements with 
road 443. Al-Quds University issued a press release yesterday 
condemning the Israeli aggression against its land. 
 
The dailies continue to highlight the crisis in Gaza as a result of 
the floods over the weekend. Israel is blamed for causing the 
flooding after opening the dams in Gaza, which injured a number of 
Palestinians and destroyed more than 70 houses. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news citing a senior Israeli official saying 
that the recent settlement activities in East Jerusalem, including 
the construction of 692 housing units for Jewish residents, were 
done with the knowledge and coordination of the US government. The 
report also notes that the White House was consulted about the 
timing and the announcement. 
 
The dailies report on the Head of European Commission in Jerusalem 
Christian Burger and PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad signing a new 
financial agreement yesterday to support the Palestinian Authority 
worth 158.5 million Euros. 
 
PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, citing the Egyptian daily 
Al-Masriyoun, reports that high ranking Egyptian officials will 
visit Tel Aviv in the coming days to discuss the Israeli conditions 
and "obstacles" regarding the prisoner exchange deal. 
 
Independent daily Al-Ayyam front pages news on Mouhammad Nazzal, 
member of Hamas Political Bureau, saying that the Palestinian 
national reconciliation has reached a dead end because of the 
Egyptian pressure on Hamas to sign the Egyptian plan without taking 
into consideration Hamas' comments on it. 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
International Law Professor Hanna Issa, writing in Al-Quds under the 
title "Israel and Jerusalem...Impose Facts On the Ground!" opines 
that the peace process is facing major difficulties because of 
current Israeli policies. Issa believes that Israel is farther from 
achieving peace than at any other time. He concludes that based on 
Israel's policies, it is obvious that Israel will not freeze 
settlements, will not recognize international laws, and does not 
want to discuss final status solutions.
