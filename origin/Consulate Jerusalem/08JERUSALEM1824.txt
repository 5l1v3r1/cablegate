¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Since the May 29 signing of its Justice 
Sector Strategy (JSS), the PA has progressed in implementing 
several areas of the plan: infrastructure, staffing, and case 
backlog reduction.  PM Fayyad highlighted this progress in 
recent press statements (ref A).  End Summary. 
 
Infrastructure 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Chief Justice Issa Abu Sharar told PolSpec on 
September 25 that construction of the Jericho and Jenin 
courthouses has been completed this year, while expansion of 
the facility in Bethlehem is underway.  The JSS calls for 
additional construction in Hebron, Tulkarem, Qalqiliya, and 
Ramallah.  Courthouse construction is being undertaken by the 
Government of Canada.  On prisons, Abu Sharar said 
construction had not yet taken place but that the plan calls 
for three central prisons located regionally in the north, 
south, and central areas of the West Bank. 
 
Staffing 
-------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In comments to Palestinian daily Al Ayyam September 
23, PM Fayyad highlighted new funding for 70 additional 
judges and 100 additional court clerks in support of the JSS. 
 Abu Sharar said that, over the course of the three-year 
plan, the JSS calls for 217 new judges, of which 46 have been 
appointed to date.  The plan calls for an additional 782 
clerks and support staff to be added by 2010; 177 are already 
on board. 
 
Case Backlog 
------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Fayyad also noted an increase in the number of 
sentences implemented.  The Attorney General's office had not 
compiled statistics to illustrate the increased 
implementation of sentences, but is working to produce that 
information.  Chief Justice Abu Sharar told PolSpec that, as 
of late August, 60,434 cases were pending before the court 
and approximately 50,000 cases had been closed year-to-date.
