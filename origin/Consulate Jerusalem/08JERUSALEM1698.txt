SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (9/12):  Heightened Speculation 
about the Closed-Door Negotiations 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
All front pages lead with reaction to statements made by US Consul 
General Jake Walles in a September 9 interview with Al-Ayyam daily. 
The three dailies report that Israeli Premier Olmert's office issued 
a statement on September 11 denying that Israel and the Palestinians 
agreed to negotiate on the future of Jerusalem and possible 
adjustments to borders.  Al-Ayyam notes that several Israeli media 
outlets distorted Walles' statements regarding negotiations on 
Jerusalem, at times attributing comments to Walles that he did not 
make.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that the State Department 
confirmed on September 11 that, "the topic of Jerusalem has not been 
addressed during negotiations headed by Israeli Foreign Minister 
Livni and Palestinian Authority (PA) negotiator Quray."  Al-Ayyam 
and Al-Quds highlight that the State Department confirmed that the 
U.S. has not taken a position on the borders of a future Palestinian 
state, and that a senior U.S. official who participated in relevant 
discussions denies that the Israeli side, led by chief negotiator 
Foreign Minister Livni, has been willing to negotiate concerning 
Jerusalem.  Both papers add that Secretary Rice participated in the 
negotiations in a way that respected the Israeli position.  Al-Quds 
runs official Palestinian reaction in an unattributed statement 
that, "the shortest way to peace in the region is through an end to 
occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian 
state."  Quoting PA Council President Nimer Hammad, the paper 
further explains that Secretary Rice has proposed a trilateral 
meeting of all parties to assess progress in negotiations and 
clarify each party's position on the current status of 
negotiations. 
 
In photo coverage, the three dailies lead with photos of September 
11 commemorations in New York.  The papers run pictures of U.S. 
presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain paying tribute 
to victims of the attack at Ground Zero.  President Bush is shown 
observing a moment of silence at the Pentagon memorial for the 
victims of September 11. 
 
The three dailies cite different news agencies' reports on Israeli 
actions in the West Bank.  Al-Quds cites a Wafa report on the injury 
of 58 Palestinians and the arrest of 9 others in Ni'lin village, 
near Ramallah, over the past three days.  In Jenin, Al-Quds reports 
that Israeli soldiers went door-to-door, inspecting Palestinian 
homes. In related coverage, Al-Ayyam cites a report produced by the 
Areej Research Institute in Bethlehem, stating that Israel continues 
to distort reporting about "facts on the ground."  According to the 
report, the separation barrier will "isolate" 13% of West Bank land 
from Palestinian populations. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports on its inside pages that PLO negotiator 
Sa'eb Erekat met with Consul General Jake Walles on September 11 in 
the West Bank city of Jericho.  The paper lists the topics that were 
discussed as:  the peace process; Israel's lack of commitment to 
implementing the first stage of the Roadmap, including a halt to 
Israeli settlement activities; the separation barrier; removal of 
checkpoints; West Bank crossing closures; the "siege" in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip; and a halt to West Bank incursions and arrests 
by the Israeli military.

¶1.  Under the title, "The Seventh Anniversary of September 11" 
(9/12), the independent Al-Quds argues in its main editorial: 
 
JERUSALEM 00001698  002 OF 002 
 
 
"Against the background of the September 11 attacks, the Palestinian 
issue remained on the margins of developments for the first seven 
years of the Bush administration, despite his having launched, for 
the first time in the history of American administration, the motto 
of a Palestinian state.  Despite Bush's vision of a two-state 
solution, which was announced in 2002 and later took shape in the 
Roadmap, the American administration did not actively attempt to 
stir the peace process until 2007, when the Annapolis Conference was 
held and resulted in the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations, frozen since 2000.  No one can deny that the American 
administration, represented by its President and Secretary of State, 
has shown interest in the peace process through visits and 
interventions, but the negotiations have not achieved any worthy 
progress and it seems that the target of reaching a Palestinian 
Israeli agreement [by the end of the year] will not be met." 
 
¶2. Samih Shbaib, a regular columnist with the independent Al-Ayyam, 
writes under the title "Negotiations Away from the Media!!!" (9/12): 
"Palestinian-Israeli negotiation sessions continue and occasionally 
take very serious dimensions, at least in appearance, without 
available information for the media, which leads to speculation and 
even fabrication on the side of the media to add some glamour and 
charm to their media product... If we attempt to generalize anything 
about the ongoing negotiations, we can say that they are genuinely 
being conducted away from the media, as was the case with the secret 
negotiations prior to Oslo, which equally surprised the Palestinians 
and the Israelis... It is true that the ongoing negotiations are 
taking place hidden from the media and media leakages, but the 
context of the negotiations is crystal clear to both Palestinians 
and Israelis, and it vividly indicates that reaching a final 
agreement is like a work of magic and witchcraft.  And if it 
happened, it would require a public and general announcement to both 
the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.  So has the situation matured 
such that the Israeli and Palestinian publics can accept a solution 
that would satisfy both populations?
