¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  According to the PA office of Civil 
Affairs, the GOI Civil Administration informed the PA that 47 
obstacles in the West Bank (mostly dirt mounds blocking local 
road access onto highways) have been or will be removed.  PA 
contacts say the list includes the Taybeh checkpoint between 
Ramallah and Jericho.  PM Salam Fayyad told press the impact 
of the removed obstacle is a positive, but marginal step. 
End Summary. 
 
Israeli Civil Administration: 
We're Removing 47 Obstacles 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to the PA office of Civil Affairs, the 
GOI Civil Administration informed the PA on March 30 that the 
IDF has removed or will remove 47 obstacles to movement in 
the West Bank, mostly dirt mounds blocking local road access 
onto highways.  The 47 include 4 near Jenin, 22 near 
Qalqiliya, 11 near Nablus and 10 near Jericho.  The Civil 
Administration told the PA it will provide a map in the next 
48 hours detailing the locations of the obstacles removed, 
including photos.  (Note: ConGen will follow up to assess the 
impact of removing these specific obstacles.  End Note). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) PA Civil Affairs contacts told ConGen Political 
Specialist that the Civil Administration said the IDF will 
remove the Taybeh checkpoint (also called Rimonim or Carmelo) 
and the Dead Sea checkpoint near the junction of Routes 1 and 
90, but thereafter told the PA that the Dead Sea checkpoint 
will remain in place.  (Note: the Dead Sea checkpoint 
consists of temporary fixtures/barriers, but is manned by 
border police most of the time to block Palestinians from 
reaching the Dead Sea.  According to PA security contacts, 
Israeli security personnel operated the checkpoint on April 
¶1.  End note).  PA contacts said the IDF did not have 
security personnel at Taybeh checkpoint March 31 or April 1, 
but the checkpoint infrastructure remained in place.  (Note: 
Previously, Taybeh was only occasionally manned by the IDF. 
If it remains open full-time and if it is not effectively 
replaced by "flying checkpoints," it will ease access between 
Jericho and Ramallah.  End note). 
 
Palestinians Largely Dismiss Steps 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In comments to Palestinian press, PM Salam Fayyad 
downplayed the impact of the removed obstacles, calling it a 
"very small step, which while we don't reject does not 
accomplish lifting all the roadblocks which seriously hinder 
movement throughout the West Bank."  PA Civil Affairs chief 
Hussayn al-Shaykh told Palestinian newspapers March 31 that 
the GOI action was "useless" and does not include removal of 
any major checkpoints.  PLO Secretary-General Yasser Abd 
Rabbo commented to the Consul General on March 31 that 
"moving 47 piles of dirt" in the West Bank will have minimal 
impact on movement or public opinion.  PA National Security 
Forces (NSF) contacts report that the IDF photographed 
removal of dirt mounds the IDF had just placed near Tulkarm a 
few days before and alleged to ConGen that many of the 
obstacle removals were more showmanship than substance.
