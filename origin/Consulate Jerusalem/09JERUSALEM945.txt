Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds leads with and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam front page a 
wire report quoting U.S. Special Envoy Mitchell on June 8 stating 
that the U.S. is committed to the establishment of a Palestinian 
state.  Mitchell also noted that President Obama wants to start 
immediate talks between Israel and the Palestinians in order to 
reach a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East with 
normalized relations between Israel and Arab countries.  The peace, 
Mitchell continued, will also serve U.S. security interests, 
according to coverage.  Mitchell is also quoted addressing the 
donors community at the donors conference in Oslo on June 7.  He 
stated that the objective of the donors conference was to provide 
all needed support to the Palestinian Authority and pave the way for 
the two-state solution by establishing an independent Palestinian 
state that lives side by side with Israel.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs 
a front page headline quoting Israeli Shas party leader Yishay on 
June 7 demanding intensified settlement activities in the West Bank, 
while Israeli Minister Yusi Biled calls for Israeli pressure on the 
U.S. and President Obama in reaction to U.S. policy on Israeli 
settlements. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with comments by Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas noting on June 8 that the Palestinian Authority is 
fully ready to negotiate with Israel if Israel respects previously 
signed agreements and abides by the Roadmap which calls for the 
two-state solution and a complete halt to settlement activities, 
including natural growth. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front page cites Ma'an news agency in reporting 
that an agreement between Fatah and Hamas is being prepared in Cairo 
in cooperation with the U.S., Egypt and Israel.  The agreement will 
be made public in July, according to reporting.  PLO Chief 
Negotiator Erekat told press that the Palestinian Authority (PA) 
will not object to a new government headed by a Hamas Prime Minister 
as long as that government would implement Gaza reconstruction, 
prepare for new PA presidential and legislative elections and commit 
to previously signed agreements. 
 
Al-Quds runs a front page story citing "Tel-Aviv" about Israel 
examining possibilities for partially lifting "the siege" imposed on 
the Gaza Strip, in reaction to President Obama's June 4 speech in 
which Obama criticized Israelis restrictions on Palestinian 
movement. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs a front page report citing Reuters about Israeli Prime 
Minister Netanyahu telephoning President Obama on June 8 to talk to 
the President about his June 14 speech which will present Israeli 
policy on peace in the Middle East. 
 
All dailies run inside coverage of the June 8 MOU signing ceremony 
between the U.S. Consulate General and Salfeet Municipality to 
launch an American Corner in Salfeet. The Consul General is quoted 
from his remarks referring to President Obama's Cairo speech and 
highlighting the importance of cultural exchange between the U.S. 
and other cultures.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1)  Hani Al-Masri opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
the 
title, "The fate of national dialogue after the Qalquilya incidents 
and Obama's speech"(06/09):  "If the Palestinian Authority is 
 
JERUSALEM 00000945  002 OF 002 
 
 
serious about ending Palestinian  division, it must recognize that 
any solution must benefit all concerned parties, particularly after 
Obama's speech which proved the seriousness of the U.S. to end the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  An [inter-Palestinian] agreement must 
be based on a national program that integrates Gaza, the West Bank, 
the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization into a partnership at all levels, only then will 
division end." 
 
2) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title 
"Dialogue and the voice of the people"(06/09):  "Palestinian 
division is not only disagreements and conflicts but it is the crux 
of the political solution... if agreement among Palestinians seems 
difficult, that is because each of the parties wants to have the 
upper hand.  We need to hold elections so that the people to make 
their own choice."
