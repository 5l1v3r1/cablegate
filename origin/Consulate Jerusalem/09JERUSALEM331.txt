TO SHOW "GOODWILL AND SERIOUSNESS"

Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with news that the Palestinian national 
reconciliation conference will begin in Cairo on February 26.  The 
papers report that Fatah and Hamas representatives, Azzam Al Ahmad 
and Mahmud Zahhar, held their first joint press conference in Cairo 
on February 25 to announce agreement on several issues including a 
halt to negative media campaigns, the release of all "political 
prisoners," and the formation of two joint committees.  The joint 
committees will monitor Fatah-Hamas agreements regarding Gaza and 
the West Bank, respectively.  Both groups described the two February 
25 meetings in Cairo as "positive."  In related news, Al Quds' front 
page runs an AFP story reporting that UK Foreign Minister Miliband 
stated in Cairo on February 25 that the UK hopes the unity talks 
will result in the formation of a technocrat Palestinian Authority 
government that serves as a transitional government ahead of new 
elections next year. 
Al Ayyam runs a front page report on "secret" U.S. criticism of 
Israel regarding the delay of humanitarian assistance into Gaza.  Al 
Hayat Al Jadida's front page runs coverage of the same story, citing 
Israeli daily Haaretz in reporting that, "Washington pressures 
Israel to ease Gaza siege."  Both papers report that Secretary 
Clinton sent messages last week to Israel expressing dismay over 
Israeli obstacles to humanitarian assistance to Gaza.  The papers 
cite Haaretz in reporting that a senior U.S. official expressed 
"deep disappointment" to Israel over Israel's failure to do more to 
improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.  Al Hayat Al Jadida adds 
that Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesman Palmor denied any knowledge 
of such U.S. messages.  Al Ayyam adds that prior to the visit of 
Secretary Clinton to Israel, Special Envoy Mitchell will likely 
deliver a "strong U.S. protest" to Israel about the issue during his 
visit on February 26.  The papers underline that the U.S. protest 
comes in response to an 'embarrassing" incident during Senator 
Kerry's visit to Gaza where he asked Israeli officials why trucks 
lined up at the crossing were denied entry into Gaza.  Kerry was 
told that the trucks contained noodles that are not considered by 
Israel to be a "humanitarian need." 
 
The papers run front page coverage of statements by Palestinian 
Authority Premier Fayyad revealing that his government will request 
$2.8 billion in assistance to Gaza at the Gaza reconstruction 
donors' conference in Egypt.  Al Ayyam's front page again confirms 
Secretary Clinton's attendance at the conference and notes an 
announcement by a "Russian diplomatic source" that the Middle East 
Quartet will meet during the conference. 
All papers run front page coverage of statements by Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Abbas made in Stockholm on February 25. 
Abbas is quoted seeking an active European role in supporting peace 
efforts and establishing an independent Palestinian state.  He also 
called on the new Israeli government to honor previous agreements 
and remove checkpoints in the Palestinian Territories.  Abbas' 
statements were made at a joint press conference with the Swedish 
Premier who is quoted stating that Sweden will support Palestinian 
reconciliation talks upon assuming the EU presidency. 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida front page statements by Egyptian 
Foreign Minister Abu Al Ghayt hoping to see positive developments on 
prisoner exchange and Gaza truce agreements between Israel and 
Hamas.  Al Ayyam's front page, also inside Al Quds, quotes 
statements by Israeli Premier Olmert urging Hamas to wrap up the 
prisoner exchange deal before he leaves office, noting that 
negotiations with his successor Premier may be more difficult. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page reports that Israeli forces arrested 
 
JERUSALEM 00000331  002 OF 002 
 
 
52 Palestinians throughout the West Bank on February 25.  Al Ayyam's 
front page runs statements by Israeli Foreign Minister Livni in 
Jerusalem, threatening the launch of new military operations in Gaza 
to halt arms smuggling.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1)  Al Quds' editorial is titled, "Never before has there been such 
a need for unity and peace"(02/26):  "In his comprehensive speech 
before the Congress, which seemed truthful and realistic, President 
Obama declared Washington's commitment to the peace process between 
Israel and its neighbors, and announced that U.S. Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton will visit the region on March 3 and 4 next month; 
and that U.S. envoy George Mitchell will open a permanent office for 
America in Jerusalem in order to keep contacts flowing and stress 
U.S. commitment to the peace process...The American position on the 
peace process seems serious in principle, but it is a vague 
commitment that lacks serious urgent steps.  Washington can, for 
instance, stop the displacement of dozens of [Palestinian] families 
and demolition of dozens of houses in Silwan [in East Jerusalem] as 
a gesture of goodwill and as an indication of seriousness.  It can 
also prevent the establishment of a settlement east of Jerusalem [E1 
area].  Then its office in Jerusalem and declared commitment to the 
cause of peace, would earn credibility, something we need now more 
than ever before... 
2) Abdul Majid Swaylim opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Dialogue 
or Negotiation?"(02/26):  "The events that preceded [internal 
Palestinian] dialogue... suggest that,if we talks start at all... 
[the talks will be] a negotiation process more than anything else... 
[other]negotiations, for instance, between the U.S. and Iran and the 
success or failure of these negotiations will sharply affect the 
success of internal Palestinian negotiations, and the same applies 
to U.S.-Syrian negotiations, Israeli-Syrian negotiations and 
developments in Lebanon.  [All] will affect... the ability of 
Palestinian factions to progress on various [internal] issues."
