Main Stories: 
------------- 
The dailies lead with headlines quoting Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Mahmoud Abbas reiterating that the Palestinians will not 
resume negotiations with the Israelis before a full settlement 
freeze, mainly in Jerusalem, for a particular period of time. 
 
The dailies also front page news on PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 
at the launching of the National Dignity Fund, an initiative between 
the PA, civil society and the private sector to clean the 
Palestinian markets of settlement products and to promote 
Palestinian products. The participants collected donations from the 
PA and the private sector worth $2 million in less than half an hour 
to support the Fund. 
 
The local press quotes Hamas leader in Gaza Ismail Hanniyeh urging 
Palestinian factions in Gaza to abide by the cease fire against 
Israel. In related news, the dailies report on Egyptian Foreign 
Minister Aboul Gheit criticizing Hamas for demanding that Egypt 
officially recognize Hamas' right to govern Gaza and stating that 
Egypt will not do so. 
 
Al-Quds independent daily front pages news that the EU and US are 
ready to provide urgent financial assistance to support the PA 
budget. The report notes that after the meeting between Special 
Envoy George Mitchell and EU representatives in Brussels yesterday, 
the Norwegian Foreign Minister noted that "we will start the year 
2010 by announcing that we are ready to support the PA budget." 
 
PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied news that Foreign Minister Gheit 
said during a meeting with Arab and European Foreign Ministers that 
Netanyahu agreed with Egyptian President Mubarak to discuss the 
issue of East Jerusalem as a capital for the Palestinians. 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------Adel Abdel Rahman writing in Al-Ayyam under the title 
"The National Dignity Fund" opines that the establishment of this 
fund is a strategic step to support Palestinian economic development 
and encourage boycotting settlement products. Abdel Rahman calls for 
for 
more policy and strategic actions that will support the Palestinian 
national economy and encourage Arab and foreign investments in 
Palestine.
