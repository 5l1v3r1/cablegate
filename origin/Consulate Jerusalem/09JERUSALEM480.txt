SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (03/17):  A CALL FOR A 
"NON-FACTIONAL, INTERIM" PA GOVERNMENT 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida lead with the "Palestinian dialogue" 
in Cairo.  Al Quds reports that dialogue sessions have intensified 
in an effort to reach an agreement within 48 hours.  The paper 
quotes PLO Executive Committee member Nabil Shaath of Fatah, stating 
that differences focus on whether the Palestinian Authority 
government should be, "factional or independent."  Al Quds adds that 
Hamas would like a factional government that includes independent 
members, with the Mecca agreement as its policy platform. Al Hayat 
Al Jadida highlights further differences centered on the question of 
whether a new government should "respect" or "commit" to PLO-signed 
agreements.  Al Ayyam's front page report on the topic notes that 
the High Dialogue Committee hopes to "find a way around the 
obstacles" before March 22. 
Al Ayyam leads with and all papers front page news that the prisoner 
exchange between Israel and Hamas is still pending.  The dailies 
note that Israel has agreed to release 400 of the 450 Palestinian 
prisoners on Hamas' list and that difficulties remain centered on 
Israel's demand to "deport" some prisoners outside the Palestinian 
Territories and release some West Bank prisoners into the Gaza 
Strip.  In related news, Al Ayyam's front page cites Ma'an in 
reporting that families of Israelis killed by some of the 
Palestinian prisoners have set up an organization to, "avenge the 
killing of their relatives," should the prisoners be released. 
 
Al Quds' front page reports that the Israeli Army Chief of Staff 
Gabi Ashkenazi, during his recent visit to the U.S., told a "friends 
of the IDF" group that the Israeli army must be prepared to attack 
Iran, adding that Israel does not rule out that scenario.  Ashkenazi 
also met with Dennis Ross, the designate for U.S. Envoy to the 
Persian Gulf, reporting notes. 
Al Ayyam's front page publishes excerpts of the government coalition 
agreement signed between Israeli Likud party head Netanyahu and the 
Israeli Beitenu party, highlighting that the text "ignores" the 
two-state solution and identifies the ousting of Hamas in Gaza as a 
strategic goal.  The paper also reports that Israeli police intend 
to investigate Beitenu party chief Lieberman on corruption charges. 
In related news, Al Ayyam's front page cites the DPA in quoting EU 
foreign policy chief Solana calling on any new Israeli Government to 
commit to the two-state solution. 
An Al Quds' inside report analyses reasons behind the resignation of 
Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad, stating that it could have 
been submitted for one of three reasons:  Fayyad is fed up with 
criticism from Fatah's "old guard"; he is fed up with criticism from 
Hamas, or he is simply sending a message to reconciliation dialogue 
participants in Cairo that he will not be party to the political 
crisis. 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida republish inside page reporting on 
the recent visit by Assistant Secretary of State David Johnson to 
the new training facility for Palestinian Authority security forces 
in Jericho.  The papers also report on a separate USG visit to 
USAID-projects in the northern West Bank and Jordan Valley on March 
Â¶16.  The papers quote a visiting USAID official stressing USAID 
commitment to assisting Palestinians improve their quality of life 
and support infrastructure and school construction 
projects.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1)  Independent daily Al Quds' editorial is titled, "Dialogue should 
exit the vicious circle"(03/17): "Maybe [it would be possible], as 
 
JERUSALEM 00000480  002 OF 002 
 
 
proposed by a number of factional leaders and their spokesmen, to 
form a non-political government with members not affiliated with 
either Fatah or Hamas.  It would be an interim government with a 
mission limited to Gaza reconstruction and preparing for 
presidential and legislative elections, based on agreements signed 
between the PLO and Israel.  Thus, it would be a government of 
national reform, reconstruction and consensus." 
 
2) Rajab Abu Sarayah opines in independent Al Ayyam under the title, 
"Crossroads"(03/17):  "In our opinion, the progress on all issues... 
means nothing if the [Palestinian reconciliation] dialogue in Cairo 
does not result in a declaration of a national unity or consensus 
government before members leave Cairo."
