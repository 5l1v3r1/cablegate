December 31, two Palestinians were killed and at least 12 
were injured in Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, and at 
least 40 more rockets hit Israel (including several 
long-range rockets).  At least 364 Palestinians have been 
killed and 1200 injured (requiring hospital attention) in 
airstrikes through 1300 on December 31.  Clashes continue in 
the West Bank near Qalandiya and Tulkarm, in which at least 
10 Palestinian youths have been injured.  A pre-recorded 
speech by President Mahmud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will air at 1800 
to commemorate Fatah's anniversary, and is expected to 
outline PA positions on Gaza violence.  End summary. 
 
Two Killed, 12 Injured in Decreased Airstrikes; 
Rocket Attacks Expand Threat Zone 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Palestinian medical contacts report two 
Palestinians were killed and at least 12 were injured in 
airstrikes from 1800 December 30 through 1300 December 31. 
Gaza-based contacts report fewer airstrikes compared to 
previous periods amidst overcast and rainy weather.  Israeli 
press report IAF airstrikes targeted Hamas offices and 
government buildings, rocket crews in northern Gaza, and 
western border areas with Egypt.  Palestinian press report a 
paramedic (Mahmud Abu Hasira) was killed early December 31 
and two were injured in an airstrike in Jabaliya.  Political 
contacts in Rafah report heavy ground vibrations throughout 
the city after bombs struck suspected tunnel areas.  They 
added that dozens of houses near the border were heavily 
damaged in the strikes.  These contacts and Palestinian press 
report more airstrikes in the same area of western Rafah at 
1200 on December 31.  Gaza City-based contacts report that 
Israeli fire hit several areas near Bayt Hanun, killing one 
Palestinian, and Israeli naval forces shelled the shoreline 
in Gaza City.  Gaza City contacts report hearing airborne 
drones overhead regularly through the morning of December 31. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Two Grad-type rockets landed in Be'er Sheva early 
December 31, causing no injuries and minor property damage. 
A barrage of Grad-type rockets also landed in/around Be'er 
Sheva late December 30, damaging an empty kindergarten. 
Israeli press report that at least five other grad-type 
rockets landed in the Ashkelon area (lightly injuring an 
Israeli) and Yavneh the morning of December 31.  Three other 
Grad-type rockets hit Ashkelon and near Ashdod late December 
30, according to Palestinian press, injuring one Israeli.  At 
least 30 Qassam rockets also struck Israel from 1800 December 
30 to 1300 December 31.  The Hamas military-wing claimed 
responsibility for all of the Grad-type rockets. 
 
West Bank and Jerusalem Clashes 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to West Bank security sources, an Israeli 
motorist reported that shots were fired towards his car at 
around 2300 on December 30 near Ithna village by Hebron, 
without causing injuries or damage.  At 2330, a pipe bomb was 
thrown towards an Israeli car near Turqumia, but did not 
cause injuries.  Several Palestinian youths were lightly 
injured in clashes with the IDF in Tulkarm following a 
demonstration the afternoon of December 30.  An Israeli child 
was lightly injured in a car stoning incident late December 
30 near Hebron.  An Israeli settler driving by Yitzhar (near 
Nablus) also reported his car was stoned.  There were 
frequent stone-throwing incidents and clashes between 
Palestinian youths and the IDF/border police near Qalandiya 
checkpoint, resulting in several injuries from rubber-coated 
bullets.  Jerusalem organizers staged a protest with roughly 
50 people attending at Damascus Gate mid-day December 31. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The IDF arrested 22 Palestinians in the West Bank 
late December 30, including 16 in Bethlehem.  Hamas outlets 
claimed the PA arrested 27 of its members in the West Bank 
December 29-30, including nine in Hebron. 
 
Political Reactions 
------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) President Abbas is in Jordan and will meet with 
Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan on December 31 to discuss 
ceasefire proposals.  Abbas' pre-recorded Fatah anniversary 
speech will air at 1800 local on Palestinian TV.  Palestinian 
media reported that President Bush called Egyptian President 
Husni Mubarak, PA President Abbas and Prime Minister Salam 
Fayyad to discuss the crisis in Gaza. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Fawzi Barhum and other Hamas spokesmen increased 
 
JERUSALEM 00002320  002 OF 002 
 
 
anti-PA propaganda on December 30, accusing the PA of 
conspiring with Israel against Hamas. Barhum said Abbas has 
formed two operations centers, one led by Presidential 
Secretary-General Tayib Abd al-Rahim to collect information 
on the secret whereabouts of Hamas leaders and military wing 
activists for Israeli targeting, and the other led by the PA 
Interior Ministry and security chiefs to prepare to assume 
control of Gaza after an Israeli invasion.  Barhum said the 
PA refuses to release Hamas prisoners and arrests more Hamas 
activists daily. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Senior Hamas leaders told Palestinian press 
December 30-31 that they have received private messages that 
the GOI is interested in a ceasefire, but reject these 
proposals as disingenuous and designed to serve Israeli 
interests.
