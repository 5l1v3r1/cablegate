SUBJECT: GAZA UPDATE JANUARY 20, 1500 LOCAL 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Gaza ceasefire largely continues to 
hold.  A single mortar landing near Nahal Oz and some IDF 
bulldozers were reported in the central part of the Gaza 
Strip.  Kerem Shalom and the Karni conveyor belt are open for 
humanitarian and commercial supplies.  End summary. 
 
Crossings 
--------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) January 20:  Kerem Shalom is open, as is the Karni 
conveyor belt.  Nahal Oz fuel station is open only for 
industrial fuel for the power plant.  (Note:  Diesel has not 
entered Gaza since January 7 and cooking gas last entered on 
January 8.  End Note.)  About 20 trucks with medical supplies 
crossed from Egypt through Rafah. 
 
Internal Movement/Distribution 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Twenty-four trucks carrying humanitarian supplies 
were reportedly intercepted by gunmen after leaving Kerem 
Shalom on January 19.  (The convoy included 13 trucks from 
the Jordanian Charitable Society and 11 from the Egyptian Red 
Cross, and was en route to an UNRWA warehouse.)  UNRWA 
reportedly managed to retrieve the hijacked goods early on 
January 20 and is not publicizing the incident. 
 
Food 
---- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Gaza contacts reported that bakeries are resuming 
operation and that there are increased supplies of basic 
commodities in stores. 
 
Electricity and Water 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Power plant contacts said on January 20 that 
several key transmission lines in Gaza City remain down, but 
that the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO) has 
repaired several lines in recent days.  Most Gaza homes 
receive 12-14 hours/day of electricity from the grid.  The 
Gaza Power Plant is generating 30 MW of electricity as of 
January 20.  OCHA contacts reported that at least 22 local 
transformers were damaged in north Gaza during the fighting. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Gaza's Coast Municipality Water Utility (CMWU) 
chief engineer said on January 20 that technical teams are 
repairing broken lines and attempting to fix pumps.  CMWU 
emphasized the need for spare parts and additional diesel 
fuel supplies. 
 
Displacement 
------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU) UNRWA reported that 33 shelters remain in Gaza 
housing 19,000 people.  UNRWA is attempting to reopen its 
schools (which currently serve as shelters) on January 24. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Most displaced Gazans are from the north and have 
been staying with family members in Gaza City, according to 
UN and private sector contacts.  Press reports estimated that 
4,000 homes were destroyed in the fighting, while another 
16,000 were partially destroyed. 
 
Banks 
----- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Local contacts reported on January 20 that banks 
are open, but have long lines.  Banks are restricting 
withdrawals due to the shortage of banknotes in Gaza.  UNRWA 
reported that it is attempting to transfer cash needed for 
its operations into Gaza on January 20. 
 
UN Needs Assessment 
------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon visited Gaza on 
January 20.  OCHA contacts reported that the UN is organizing 
an interagency rapid assessment, and anticipated that the 
final report should be complete by January 27-28.  UN 
Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and 
Emergency Response Coordinator John Holmes will arrive this 
week to lead the review process.
