Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies continue to lead with news on the PLO Central 
Council meeting in Ramallah. Lead headlines in the three dailies 
reflect the Council's majority decision to extend Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas' term and to continue the 
role of the Palestinian Legislative Council until the next 
presidential and legislative elections. The PLO Central Council also 
supported Abbas' position that the Palestinians will not return to 
negotiations with the Israelis until the latter imposes a complete 
freeze in settlement activity. 
 
Independent daily Al-Ayyam runs separate front page coverage citing 
AFP on Hamas spokesperson in Gaza Fawzi Barhoum criticizing the PLO 
Central Council decision, saying that it is illegitimate. 
 
PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Quds front page 
President Abbas' interview with Israeli daily Haaretz, published 
yesterday. Abbas stressed that if Israel completely halts settlement 
activity for six months, it will be possible for Palestinians to 
reach a permanent agreement with the Israelis. Abbas reiterated that 
the PA has no pre-conditions for resuming negotiations but wants 
Israel to abide by its obligations and commitments under the Road 
map. 
 
The dailies front page news and run lead photos of settlers laying 
the corner stone for a new settlement in Bethlehem. Settlers noted 
that this act is a challenge to the construction freeze imposed by 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
Al-Quds and independent news outlet Maan report that hundreds of 
right-wing Israelis are expected to attend organized tours and 
prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound today. The event is being 
called a "mass pilgrimage" honoring the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. 
[Today is the Hijri New Year for Muslims and there will be 
celebrations in the mosque.]

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Abdel-Majid Swelim writing in Al-Ayyam under the title "On the 
Margins of the Central Council Meeting" opines that it was not wise 
for the Council to conclude its meetings without identifying a date 
for the next elections, as it demonstrates that the Council still 
can't take decisive decisions.
