SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (03/10):  PALESTINIANS HOPE FOR 
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with news of Palestinian "reconciliation dialogue" 
that began in Egypt on March 10 under "active Egyptian sponsorship 
and participation."  Papers describe statements by Palestinian 
groups participating in the talks as optimistic and hopeful that 
reconciliation will occur and a new Palestinian Authority (PA) 
national unity government will be formed.  Factions also expressed 
hopes for PLO reform and fixing a date for PA legislative and 
presidential elections, noting that all elements would be part of 
one comprehensive agreement that would be reached in the next ten 
days. 
Al Quds' and Al Hayat Al Jadida's front pages report that Islamic 
Jihad in Gaza has accused Hamas of arresting 10 of its members for 
firing rockets at Israel.  Hamas released the members after they 
signed a document promising not to fire more rockets on Israel, 
reporting notes. In other Gaza news, Al Ayyam runs a front page 
Reuters report on statements by the Palestinian Authority Monetary 
Authority Governor warning that Gaza banks will soon run out of cash 
because of Israel's refusal to allow cash into Gaza. 
Al Quds' front page reports on a recent poll, highlighting results 
showing that if an election were held for Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President today, Marwan Barghouthi of Fatah would receive 61% 
percent of the vote and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyah would win 34%. 
Neither the headline nor the lead paragraph of the story state the 
other key finding of the poll:  If presidential elections were held 
between PA President Mahmud Abbas and Haniyah, Abbas would receive 
45% of the vote (down from 48% three months ago), and Haniyah would 
receive 47%(up from 38% three months ago). 
 
All front pages report that the humanitarian aid convoy, led by 
British MP George Gallaway, entered Gaza on March 9.  The reports 
quotes Gallaway expressing support for, "the elected Palestinian 
Authority Premier" Ismail Haniyah of Hamas, and explaining that the 
convoy will deliver the assistance directly to Haniyah. 
 
Al Ayyam's front page, and an inside page of Al Hayat Al Jadida 
report that Israeli authorities have decided to "confiscate" 142 
acres in Bilin, Kharbatha Bani Hareth and Dir Qadis villages near 
Ramallah, and 50 acres in Yatta village near Hebron in the West 
Bank.  In related reporting, Al Quds and Al Ayyam front page a DPA 
report quoting French Foreign Minister Kouchner stating that Israeli 
settlement policies are hindering the establishment of a viable, 
contiguous Palestinian state. Kouchner also called on Hamas to adopt 
the Arab peace initiative and noted that Hamas has yet to take the 
path of peace. 
 
Al Ayyam's front page and an inside page of Al Quds run a report and 
photo of "extremist Jews" being escorted by Israeli police on a tour 
of the Aqsa mosque compound where they "performed some religious 
ceremonies" on March 9.  According to reporting, Muslim visitors 
objected to the tour, but were prevented by Israeli police from 
approaching the Jewish group. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida and Al Ayyam's front pages and an inside page of 
Al Quds run an AFP story about the Israeli human rights group "Yesh 
Din" calling on Israel to halt mining in the West Bank, calling the 
operations a violation of human rights and destruction of the 
environment. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida runs a caricature on an inside page showing Uncle 
Sam with two faces:  One that is lecturing a new Palestinian 
government to abide by several conditions, including recognizing 
Israel and denouncing terrorism, and a second face that is anxiously 
telling an "Israeli extremist rightwing" government that "we will 
 
JERUSALEM 00000446  002 OF 002 
 
 
deal with any elected Israeli government." 
Al Ayyam runs an inside report about a March 9 meeting between U.S. 
Consul General Jacob Walles and Palestinian Authority (PA) Jerusalem 
Governor Hussayni, and officials from the Palestinian Presidency and 
Premier's office.  The Palestinians briefed Walles on Israeli 
settlement activities and house demolitions in Al Bustan, Sheikh 
Jarrah, Ras Khmays and the Old City neighborhoods of Jerusalem. 
They also expressed appreciation for the message delivered by 
Secretary Clinton in her speech during the joint press conference 
with PA President Abbas in Ramallah.  The Palestinian officials also 
demanded that greater pressure be put on Israel to reopen 
Palestinian social, cultural and economic institutions in Jerusalem. 
 The paper mistakenly reports that the briefing took place during a 
tour by Consul General Walles of East Jerusalem neighborhoods. 
 
Syrian President Al Assad says that peace with Israel is possible, 
but that normalization can only come after the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict is solved, Al Ayyam's front page reports.  Assad also 
called on Palestinians to coordinate with Syria in peace 
negotiations with Israel, "so that we can help the Palestinians," 
the paper concludes, citing wire coverage of a UAE-based dailies 
interview with Assad. 
All papers note the invitation of Palestinian Authority President 
Abbas to the regularly scheduled Arab summit in Doha.  The report 
also reports that a smaller summit will be held first as part of the 
ongoing Arab reconciliation efforts.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1)  Al Quds' editorial is titled, "Today must be decisive"(03/10): 
"The Palestinian people hope that today, March 10, [start of unity 
talks] will be a decisive day in ending division once and for all. 
They reject that any obstacles or impediments should be allowed to 
prevent [unity] and will hold those parties that seek to obstruct 
progress responsible. 
 
2) Basim Abu Sumaya editorializes in Al Hayat Al Jadida under the 
title, "Aladdin's government"(03/10):  "Should Hamas insist on 
rejecting the two-state solution, the conflict will erupt once more 
and make PLO reform and security force reform difficult..."
