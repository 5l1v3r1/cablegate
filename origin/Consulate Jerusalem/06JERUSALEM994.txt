SUBJECT: UN AGENCIES APPEAL FOR USD 1.25 MILLION IN 
ASSISTANCE FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SUPPLIES FOR THE WEST BANK 
AND GAZA 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Three United Nations agencies -- the World 
Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) -- 
issued an appeal March 6 to local donors for USD 1.25 million 
for emergency medical supplies for the Palestinian Authority. 
 (Note:  Full text of the letter emailed to NEA/IPA.  End 
Note.)  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA) plans to issue a similar revised appeal to 
donors in mid-April to cover emergency UN operations.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a March 6 letter circulated to donors, the local 
heads of three UN agencies (WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF) appealed to 
donors to provide USD 1.25 million to the PA MOH for 
essential medical supplies in light of their evaluation of 
the February 7 request by the PA Acting Health Minister.  The 
supplies are intended to support PA health system operations 
at primary and secondary levels for three months. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The appeal calls for: 
 
-- Essential drugs at a cost of USD 300,000 and medical 
disposable supplies at a cost of USD 350,000.  UNFPA and 
UNICEF will use these drugs in primary and secondary health 
care services, including maternal and child health services 
as well as emergency services; 
 
-- Laboratory reagents at a cost of USD 100,000.  UNFPA and 
WHO will use the laboratory reagents and UNFPA and UNICEF 
will use the disposables for specialized laboratories, 
although some items are for primary and secondary health 
care; and 
 
-- Non-EPI vaccines at a cost of USD 500,000.  (Note: 
Non-EPI vaccines refer to "non-essential program 
immunizations."  Essential vaccines typically include 
measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, 
tuberculosis.  In a March 3 meeting with USAID and 
ConGenOffs, the UNICEF local head of office confirmed that 
all EPI vaccines for 2006 are in place.  He noted that EPI 
vaccines for 2007 need to be ordered by July 2006.  In the 
West Bank, he said the PA administers 85 percent of the 
vaccines, while United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
(UNRWA) administers 15 percent.  In Gaza, 75 percent are 
administered by UNRWA and 25 percent by the PA.  End 
Note.)  The non-EPI vaccines will provide one year of 
coverage for vaccines such as Hepatitis B for health 
workers, and influenza, rabies and meningitis for Hajj-bound 
pilgrims. 
 
¶4. (SBU) OCHA reported that it plans to issue a similar 
appeal to donors prior to a mid-year review of the UN's 2006 
consolidated appeal for emergency programs in the West Bank 
and Gaza.  OCHA said it is expediting the review of the 
appeal and will release its assessment and revised appeal in 
mid-April. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  The appeal reflects the UN's concern about 
imminent stock shortages at the MOH and a possible disruption 
of service to the healthcare delivery system.  Stock 
shortages could have a ripple effect on other key healthcare 
providers, such as UNRWA, which currently relies on PA labs 
to provide free testing for its network of primary healthcare 
clinics.  Given the evolving situation on the ground, we 
anticipate that additional appeals from the UN will be 
forthcoming as various agencies are starting to assess the 
impact on their operations.  Washington agencies will need to 
evaluate requests for donor support to the PA Ministry of 
Health as part of our ongoing review of U.S. assistance. 
Based on our evaluation, we should coordinate with other 
donors to ensure a consistent international approach.  End 
Comment.
