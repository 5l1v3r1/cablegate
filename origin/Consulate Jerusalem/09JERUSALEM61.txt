REF:  (A) JERUSALEM 0047; (B) JERUSALEM 0051 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Israeli ground operations and air strikes 
continued on the morning of January 7 after what Gaza-based contacts 
described as a relatively quiet night.  Ground forces continued to 
fight militants around Gaza City, and moved closer to Khan Yunis 
without entering the city.  Airstrikes continued around Gaza City 
and along the southern border with Egypt.  The GoI announced that 
there will be a "humanitarian pause" January 7 from 1300 to 1600 to 
allow humanitarian supplies to move within Gaza.  At least four 
rockets were fired into Israel before 1300 local time.  The UN 
reported 640 dead and 2850 wounded, with almost half of the wounded 
women and children.  IDF mortars struck a UNRWA shelter in Jabaliya 
on January 6, killing 40 and wounding 45.  West Bank demonstrations 
continue, causing minor disturbances.  End summary. 
 
Ground Operations Continue 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gaza-based sources reported that the IDF resumed intense 
military activities the morning of January 7, following a relatively 
quiet night.  IDF activity was concentrated in five primary areas: 
 
 -- the IDF continued to operate around the towns of Bayt Lahiya and 
Bayt Hanun, and shelled a mosque in Bayt Lahiya, killing one and 
wounding four; 
 
 -- east of Gaza City, the IDF continued to operate around the 
Jabaliya refugee camp; 
 
 -- south of Gaza City, clashes were reported between the IDF and 
militants in the Zaytun neighborhood; 
 
 -- in southern Gaza, IDF units reached the village of Abasan 
(reftel), but no IDF activity was reported inside the urban area of 
Khan Yunis; and 
 
 -- the IDF maintains its positions south of Rafah, near the defunct 
Gaza airport. 
 
Additionally, press reported clashes the night of January 6 between 
IDF special forces and militants in Dayr al-Balah, in the central 
Gaza Strip.  Four Palestinians were killed the night of January 6 
when the IDF shelled a main street in downtown Gaza City. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) HAMAS sources told the press that their forces executed 
six Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel near 
Jabaliya and blamed collaborators for Israel's success in striking 
militants. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) UNRWA confirmed that 40 Palestinians were killed and 45 
wounded when Israeli tanks targeted al-Fakhura School in Jabaliya 
(more detail septel).  The IDF claimed militants were using the 
school as a base to launch mortars.  OCHA also reported seven 
injuries in an UNRWA-run health clinic damaged during a January 6 
airstrike on an adjacent building. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) An OCHA representative told EconOff the GoI will open 
Kerem Shalom and Nahal Oz for humanitarian supplies.  Reports also 
indicated that Rafah will open January 7 to allow delivery of 
medical supplies and evacuate medical cases.  The GoI informed OCHA 
that a "humanitarian pause" will be implemented January 7 from 1300 
to 1600. 
Airstrikes Continue 
------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Gaza-based sources and local press reported that IAF 
airstrikes resumed in support of ground operations the morning of 
January 7 and hit: 
 
 -- the Zaytun and Shaykh Radwan neighborhoods in southeastern Gaza 
City, killing at least one militant and seven unidentified 
Palestinians and wounding at least one other militant; 
 
 -- Bayt Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, killing one al-Aqsa 
militant and wounding two others; 
 
 -- two houses near the Salah al-Din Gate, leading from Gaza into 
Egypt; and 
 
 -- tunnels along the Egyptian border. 
 
Rocket Fire Causes No Injuries 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Israeli media reported at least 4 rockets fired into 
Israel before 1300 on January 7, sending several Israelis into shock 
 
JERUSALEM 00000061  002 OF 002 
 
 
but otherwise causing no injuries or damage.  Reports said a total 
of 45 rockets were fired into Israel on January 6. 
 
Casualties 
---------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Palestinian medical contacts in Gaza and local press 
report that 21 Palestinians were killed before 1300 local on January 
7 by 1300 local, and 132 were killed on January 6.  According to UN 
reporting, at least 640 Palestinians have been killed and 2850 
injured requiring hospitalization since the beginning of 
hostilities.  The UN estimates at least 25 percent of the dead are 
women and children, and up to 40 percent of the wounded.  Save the 
Children reported that at least 101 children have died, and that at 
least 1134 of the wounded are women and children, based on 
Palestinian Ministry of Health numbers. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) UN contacts, ICRC contacts, and representatives of local 
human rights organizations told PolOff January 6 and 7 that, due to 
the rapidly changing environment and the inability to access areas 
of intense fighting, the fatality numbers are probably low, but more 
accurate numbers are unavailable.  NGOs and press told ConGenOffs 
that they largely rely on numbers from hospital staff in Gaza, with 
some corroboration by local correspondents when possible. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Israeli press reported that an IDF soldier was killed on 
patrol in northern Gaza January 6, bringing the total number of 
soldiers killed to six. 
 
Political Reactions and Developments 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Following the shelling of the al-Fakhura school, PM 
Fayyad publicly condemned Israeli strikes that hit civilians. 
PalTel CEO Abd al-Malik Jabar said publicly that the Gaza telephone 
system will shut down "within 24 hours" unless the company can 
deliver fuel to its operators in the Strip. 
West Bank Reactions and Security 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  (SBU) Demonstrations continued in towns throughout the West 
Bank and in East Jerusalem on January 6, among them: 
 
 -- university students at Bir Zeit and al-Quds in Abu Dis 
demonstrated on campus; 
 
 -- three Palestinians were lightly wounded in skirmishes with the 
IDF in Na'alin, and two were arrested in skirmishes near Hebron; 
 
 -- PASF confiscated four pipe bombs near the Islamic Charitable 
Society in Hebron; and 
 
 -- peaceful marches are planned in several West Bank towns January 
7 at 1300 local.
