Ground Operations Continue,

--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gaza-based sources, local press, and the UN reported that 
IDF operations continued on the northern, southern, and eastern 
edges of Gaza City January 12-13, making incremental progress toward 
the urban center.  The IDF maintained positions throughout Gaza, 
including the Karni-Netzarim road from the coast to the border, from 
which IDF troops launched raids into southern Gaza City.  Several 
contacts in Gaza City and around Khan Yunis described the night of 
January 12 as the worst since operations began, with continuous 
airstrikes and tank shelling. 
 
 -- NORTHERN GAZA:  Gaza-based press and the UN reported that the 
IDF clashed with militants January 12-13 in al-Atatra and al-Sayfa 
(north of Bayt Lahiya), and in the Izbet Abed Rabbo area of 
Jabaliya.  Israeli press reported that the IDF discovered two 
tunnels running into Israel from the northern Gaza Strip, one of 
them near the Karni/al-Mintar crossing. 
 
 -- GAZA CITY:  Gaza-based press and the UN reported that the IDF 
advanced several hundred meters toward the urban areas of Gaza City 
January 12-13, shelling and engaging militants under helicopter 
back-up.  Fighting was reported in the southeast neighborhood of 
Zaytun and the eastern neighborhoods of Tuffah and Shujaiyah, where 
an IDF tank shell killed three and wounded seven others.  Fighting 
was also reported the morning of January 13 in the southwest 
neighborhoods of Tel al-Hawa and Tel al-Islam, and in the northwest 
neighborhood of Twam.  Israeli press reported that the Givati 
Brigade Roten Regiment was operating on the southern outskirts of 
Gaza City, the Golani Brigade was east of Gaza City, and 
paratroopers were north of Gaza City.  The Armored 401st Brigade was 
operating along the Karni-Netzarim road from the coast to the Gaza 
border. 
 
 -- SOUTHERN GAZA:  The UN reported that fighting continued January 
12-13 in Khuza'a and around Abasan, east of Khan Yunis. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The UN reported that the IDF maintained positions near the 
Erez crossing, al-Zahra village (northwest of the Nusayrat refugee 
camp), east of Johr al-Dik (northeast of al-Burayj), near Abu 
al-Ajeen (east of Dayr al-Balah), and east of the Rafah airport on 
January 13.  No fighting was reported in these locations. 
 
Airstrikes and Naval Barrage Continue 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Gaza-based sources, local press, and the UN reported 
that the IAF hit 60 targets overnight January 12-13, targeting 
mainly northern Gaza, Gaza City, and the Rafah border area. 
 
 -- NORTHERN GAZA:  The UN reported IAF airstrikes against Bayt 
Lahiya January 12-13, killing at least two and wounding at least six 
others.  IAF airstrikes also targeted Jabaliya, including the Shaykh 
Zaid City area. 
 
 -- GAZA CITY:  Gaza-based press and the UN reported that IAF 
airstrikes in Gaza City January 12-13 killed two militants and 
wounded ten Palestinians in Palestine Square, the main square in the 
center of Gaza City, and killed two militants in the Zaytun 
neighborhood.  An airstrike also killed a woman and three children 
in a home in the Twam neighborhood.  Airstrikes were reported 
against the Gaza harbor. 
 
 -- CENTRAL GAZA:  The UN reported Israeli naval shelling of the 
area southwest of the Nusayrat refugee camp.

JERUSALEM 00000119  002 OF 002 
 
 
casualties.  Press reported 23 rockets from Gaza landed in Israel on 
January 12. 
 
Casualties 
---------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Gaza-based medical sources told the press that a total of 
27-30 Palestinians died January 12-13, including a paramedic killed 
during rescue work in Jabaliya.  The sources estimated that 921 
Palestinians have been killed since IDF operations began (including 
at least 275 children, 93 women, 13 paramedics, and three 
journalists), and that 4,250 people have required medical treatment 
for injuries (including at least 1,333 children and 587 women).  The 
sources said that many Gazans are dying in hospitals of wounds 
sustained over the past two weeks. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Israeli press reported that three IDF soldiers were 
wounded in Gaza the morning of January 13.  Press also reported that 
up to eight soldiers were wounded -- four of them possibly by 
friendly fire -- January 12. 
 
Humanitarian Situation 
---------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) A "humanitarian pause" took place January 13 from 
0900-1200 local, during which some fighting was reported.  An IDF 
spokesman made unconfirmed claims that Hamas was looting truckloads 
of humanitarian goods and selling them, rather than distributing 
them free of charge. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) A Gaza City contact reported that IDF strikes on buildings 
in Gaza City the morning of January 13 knocked out several 
electricity and phone lines.  Many areas of Gaza City that had 4-12 
hours of electricity on January 12 are now in blackout.  The contact 
lives near the UNRWA headquarters in Central Gaza, just northwest of 
the Zaytun neighborhood, where heavy fighting is taking place.  He 
said that he heard several explosions in Gaza City from 0900-0930, 
as the reported "humanitarian pause" was to begin.  He reported that 
markets are still supplied with commercial food items, such as small 
(non-aid agency) bags of flour, sugar, rice, lentils, milk and 
yogurt.  He said that customers are limited to purchasing only a few 
items, given high demand. 
 
Political Developments 
---------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Hamas leaders, including Ismail Haniya and Usama Hamdan, 
in separate statements January 12 said that Hamas is considering the 
Egyptian initiative, but maintained that Hamas would continue 
"resistance" against Israel (see reftel).  They also indicated that 
Hamas would consider international observers along the Gaza/Egypt 
border as long as Hamas has a role administering the crossing 
point. 
 
West Bank Reaction and Security 
------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Professional syndicates held peaceful protests across the 
West Bank January 13 at 1100 local.  A peaceful protest took place 
January 12 in Ramallah, and Palestinian youth skirmished with the 
IDF during protests in Qalandiya and near Baytunia, with no injuries 
reported.  Three Israeli soldiers near Hebron were lightly wounded 
by glass shattered by Palestinian gunfire January 12.  Settlers from 
Karni Shomron threw rocks at Palestinian cars, causing no injuries. 
The IDF arrested 16 Palestinians across the West Bank January 12-13.
