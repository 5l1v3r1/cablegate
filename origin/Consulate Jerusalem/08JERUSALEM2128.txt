Main Stories: 
------------- 
News of the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to dominate 
front pages.  All dailies highlight, and Al Quds leads with news 
that Israel again closed crossings on November 25, just one day 
after reopening them to allow for the entry of limited supplies of 
food and fuel. The Strip's only power plant has shut down due to 
lack of fuel and an Israeli incursion into the eastern area of Khan 
Yunis on November 25, destroyed greenhouses and water reserves, 
papers note.  The dailies warn of a "health catastrophe" due to the 
lack of chloride to purify well water.  Al Quds quotes UNRWA 
Operations Director John Ging describing the situation in Gaza as 
"shameful and disgraceful."  Ging notes that current supplies in 
Gaza cover 10% of UNRWA's daily distribution needs and added that 
70% of Gaza has no electricity, hospitals are using candles for 
light, and mills use wheat cattle feed for bread.  Al Hayat Al 
Jadida's front page also runs November 25 statements by the U.N. 
Secretary calling on Israel to lift the Gaza "siege" and desist from 
all actions harming peace, while he also called on Palestinian 
groups, including Hamas, to unite. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida and Al Ayyam lead with photos and statements by 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas about new elections in the 
West Bank and Gaza.  Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting 
in Ramallah on November 25, Abbas said, "[Hamas] needs to realize 
that sooner or later elections must be held and if they do not 
succeed this time, they should accept the results as we did before." 
 Abbas stated that he would invite international election observers. 
 When asked about a reported ban on Fatah activities in the Gaza 
Strip, Abbas called the ban "ridiculous," and not worth discussion. 
In related news, Al Quds' front page cites Israeli daily Haaretz in 
revealing that Hamas leadership in exile wants the group to cede 
control over Gaza, while Hamas leaders in the Palestinian 
Territories want greater representation in the group's "Shura", 
congress. 
 
Al Quds' front page reports that Arab foreign ministers will meet in 
Cairo on November 25, to discuss the Palestinian issue.  Egypt's 
Foreign Minister Abu Ghayt will brief on the status of internal 
Palestinian talks.  The gathered leaders are expected to urge all 
Palestinian parties to cooperate with Egyptian efforts for 
Palestinian unity, the paper reports.  In related news, Al Quds' 
front page reports on a poll by Nablus' Al Najah university, showing 
that 75% of Palestinians believe that some countries have worked to 
undermine Cairo unity talks; 39% would vote for a Fatah presidential 
candidate and 17% would vote for a Hamas candidate. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's and Al Ayyam's front pages cite "news agencies" 
in reporting about, "a stormy meeting between Bush and Olmert."  The 
paper cites "U.S. sources" telling Israel's Depka website, an outlet 
close to Israeli intelligence, that Olmert accused the U.S. of 
contacting Hamas.  The paper also notes that the two leaders told 
press after the meeting that the two-state solution is the only way 
to settle the Palestinian-Israel conflict.  Al Ayyam adds that 
Western diplomats continue to have contact with Hamas, despite 
Quartet objections.  In related news, Al Ayyam's front page cites 
Time magazine in reporting on Jordanian mediation between Israel and 
Hamas to achieve an end to rocket attacks on Israel. The paper 
reports that the U.S. requested Jordan mediate in an attempt to stop 
Israeli plans to invade the Gaza Strip. 
 
U.S. Consulate General, Jerusalem activities are recorded on inside 
pages of the dailies:  Al Quds reports that Consulate employees and 
 
JERUSALEM 00002128  002 OF 002 
 
 
their spouses made a Thanksgiving monetary and food stuff donation 
to the Holy Family Orphanage in Bethlehem on November 25.  Al Hayat 
Al Jadida reports that the U.S. Consulate held their second "Career 
Day" event this year for Palestinian university students and 
companies, with co-sponsor Young Entrepreneurs of Palestine in 
Ramallah on November 25.  The same paper reports that USAID Director 
Sumka attended a conference inaugurating a new season for the Simsim 
[Sesame Street] children's program.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1)  Al Ghafli opines in Al Quds under the title, "The upcoming 
American hegemony" (11/26):  "Everyone should hide their gloating 
over the American state of weakness, caused by the policies of 
outgoing President Bush, and avoid giving the impression that their 
wish is for continued weakness or a collapse of the USA, if they 
want to extend the hand of partnership to incoming president Obama 
[and have Obama accept the offer of partnership." 
 
2)  Hamada Fara'ana writes in Al Ayyam under the title, "Electing 
the President of the Palestinian state is a brave political step" 
(11/26):  "The decision by the [PLO] Central Council [to elect 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas, President of State] is a... 
legal, constitutional step, that shows a proactive and brave spirit, 
and requires... the second step of calling for simultaneous 
legislative and presidential elections based on a fully proportional 
electoral system."
