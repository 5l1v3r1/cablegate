Israeli daily Haaretz, Metzger was escorted into Yasuf by the 
Israeli military and Palestinian police, and said "I came here to 
expression my revulsion at this wretched act of burning a place holy 
to the Muslim people." He added, "This is how the Holocaust began, 
the tragedy of the Jewish people of Europe."

JERUSALEM 00002268  002.3 OF 002 
 
 
Israel responds to all Hamas demands. He also urged all Palestinian 
factions to work on a new initiative to retain national unity and 
end the state of division. 
 
Hamas affiliated news outlet Paltimes.net quotes senior Hamas 
official in Gaza Mahmoud Al-Zahar saying that resistance is a 
general concept and is not limited to armed resistance. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
UK Issues Arrest Warrant for Tzipi Livni: 
----------------------------------------- 
 
The three dailies and Maan news agency report on the arrest warrant 
issued by a British court for former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi 
Livni for her involvement in Israel's assault on Gaza last winter. 
The reports note that the British government is looking into the 
repercussions of such a warrant. 
  ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds runs an editorial under the title "Guided Resistance" 
referring to Hanniyeh's speech to mark Hamas' 22nd anniversary. In 
his remarks, Hanniyeh referred to Hamas' "guided resistance" without 
further explanation. According to the writer, one can easily 
conclude that Hanniyeh is referring to the unannounced truce with 
Israel. The writer questions, "If this is Hamas' option, why didn't 
Hamas make this choice from the beginning and avoid all this 
destruction and suffering?"
