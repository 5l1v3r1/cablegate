RE-OPENS AFTER CLOSURE 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU)  On December 31, the East Jerusalem-based 
Palestinian Housing Council (PHC) reopened after a six-month 
closure.  The Israeli Ministry of Internal Security closed 
the PHC on July 2, 2008, claiming that it was a Palestinian 
Authority (PA) agency operating illegally in Jerusalem.  The 
Council filed suit to revoke the closure order, and the 
Israeli government failed to submit evidence to support 
renewing it, according to local press. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  PHC Chairman Ibrahim Shaaban told PolOff that the 
PHC is registered with Israeli authorities and has paid all 
required fees since 1991. Shaaban commented that the closure 
was for political reasons and Israeli authorities decided not 
to renew the closure order because they had no evidence 
linking the PHC to the PA.  In 2001, eight East Jerusalem 
Palestinian institutions (including the Orient House), were 
closed by the GOI using the same justification.  These eight 
remain closed.  (Comment: While the PHC's opening is 
positive, it is unlikely to influence reopening of other 
closed East Jerusalem institutions.  Jerusalem Palestinian 
political interlocutors say their Israeli counterparts tell 
them decisions on the primary East Jerusalem institutions are 
reserved for the Israeli Prime Minister, and reopenings are 
not being actively considered.  End comment).
