ignored nor overlooked and that Israeli practices contradict all the 
talk we hear about peace..." 
 
 
Â¶2.  Regular columnist of independent Al-Ayyam, Talal Okal, opines 
under the title, "Memories of Flesh and Blood..." (09/18): "Since 
the beginning of negotiations at Madrid that were based on an 
initiative launched by George Bush senior after the world war for 
the liberation of Kuwait, three American presidents: Bush senior, 
Bill Clinton and Bush junior, have taken turns at negotiations to 
achieve peace in the Middle East... Since that time, seven heads of 
Israeli government have also tried their hand at negotiations, with 
the eighth to be born on Thursday [Kadima elections]... Rabin, 
showing the courage that the others lacked, went to the Oslo 
signing... we do not know what would have happened if Rabin were 
still alive, but the realities and the core of the Zionist scheme 
have hardened.  This is why he was killed so early, indicating that 
he was going against the natural path of Israel... Since Annapolis, 
the latest round of negotiations have not accomplished anything and 
here is the lame duck speaking poetry before leaving the political 
arena [Israeli Premier Olmert in his last cabinet speech], handing 
over the reins to his successor in Kadima.  But realities on the 
ground speak louder, foreshadowing the coming failure of all peace 
initiatives.  Shouldn't we now examine this process closely and try 
to learn some lessons?  Is there still time?  Will our internal 
dispute give us the pause to conduct this review or are individual 
goals more important?"
