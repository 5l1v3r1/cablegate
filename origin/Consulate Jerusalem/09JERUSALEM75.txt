¶2.  (SBU) Gaza-based sources and local press reported that the IDF 
continued operations around Gaza City January 7-8.  IDF units 
maintained their position near the defunct Rafah airport and 
northeast of al-Burayj refugee camp and moved to the outskirts of 
al-Qarara, northeast of Khan Yunis. 
 
 -- In southern Gaza, the IDF engaged militants on the outskirts of 
al-Qarara the night of January 7, killing at least one, but no IDF 
activity was reported inside the urban area of Khan Yunis; 
 
 -- Palestinian workers at the Erez crossing came under IDF tank 
fire the morning of January 8, killing one and wounding two; 
 
 -- the IDF continued to operate around the towns of Bayt Lahiya and 
Bayt Hanun January 8, reportedly killing a family of four in their 
car in Bayt Lahiya; and 
 
 -- the IDF continued to operate around the Jabaliya refugee camp, 
east of Gaza City, and south of the city. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The PA President's Office told PolSpec that as many as 
10,000 Palestinians evacuated their homes in southern Rafah in 
response to leaflets dropped by Israeli aircraft January 7, warning 
the residents of impending ground and air operations near the 
Egyptian border.  Palestinian media reported up to 16,000 displaced 
persons in the area, many of whom took shelter in UNRWA schools.

its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and 
evacuate the wounded.
