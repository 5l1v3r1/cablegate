SUBJECT: JERUSALEM SPECIAL MEDIA REACTION (06/05):  OVERWHELMINGLY 
POSITIVE COVERAGE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CAIRO SPEECH 
 
------------------- 
Summary of Coverage 
------------------- 
President Obama's June 4 speech received extensive, overwhelmingly 
positive coverage in all Palestinian media-  broadcast, on-line and 
print.  All dailies lead with front page coverage highlighting 
Obama's remarks regarding a new beginning with the Muslim world, 
U.S. opposition to Israeli settlement expansion and support for a 
resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  All dailies posted 
the full text of the speech on inside pages.  Papers also run 
numerous articles about Palestinian, Arab and Israeli reaction to 
the speech, as well as, editorial and analytical pieces.  All front 
pages lead with photos of President Obama delivering his speech to a 
Cairo audience, visibly pleased by what they hear. 
 
Print and on-line headlines about the speech include: 
 
- [Palestinian Authority spokesperson] 
Abu Rudaynah:  Obama's speech is the beginning of a new U.S. policy 
and is a clear message to the Israelis 
 
- In a historic speech to the Muslim World from the Cairo 
University 
Obama:  The time has come to halt settlement activities; we will not 
legitimize their continuation.  The only solution to achieve the 
vision of the two parties, is two states wherein Israelis and 
Palestinians live in peace and security. 
 
- Pledges to be personally engaged in establishing the 
Palestinian state and calls on Arabs to take bold positions 
Obama:  The Palestinian situation is unbearable; the two-state 
solution serves the interests of Palestine, Israel, America and the 
world. 
 
- Obama: Settlements require tough choices 
 
- America will not recognize the settlements as 
legitimate and will not turn its back on the Palestinians in their 
pursuit to establish an independent state 
 
- Wide Palestinian and Arab satisfaction with Obama's 
reconciliation speech to the Muslim World 
 
 
Al-Ayyam runs an exclusive interview with President Obama by 
prominent Palestinian journalist Wafa Amr, drawn from Amr's 
participation in the special press roundtable after the speech.  The 
above the fold feature, under a dramatic red font headline, 
highlights Obama's statement in response to Israel's request for 
time to review its policy, "60 years of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict have passed.  We can wait a few more months before making 
further decisions or taking steps towards resolving the conflict." 
Amr also notes that the President reiterated his commitment to 
ending the conflict, but refused to put a timeframe on relaunching 
the peace process. 
 
The three dailies front page Palestinian Authority (PA) satisfaction 
with President Obama's speech.  PA spokesperson Abu Rudaynah is 
quoted calling Obama's speech, "a new beginning.  It is a different 
and clear message to the Israelis." 
 
Almost all editorials are positive in tone and reflect Palestinian 
satisfaction with and admiration for both the speech and President 
Obama as an American leader who is committed to engaging with the 
 
JERUSALEM 00000890  002 OF 003 
 
 
Muslim world. 
 
Al-Quds runs an inside cartoon of President Obama addressing Muslims 
during his speech starting with, "Salam Alaykum" and the pleased 
Muslim audience answering, "Wa Alaykum Assalam."  Al-Ayyam runs a 
back page cartoon of Palestinians commenting after the speech, "nice 
words, but what's next?" 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam run front page coverage of official Israeli 
comments showing support for President Obama's efforts to 
"reconcile" with the Arab and Muslim World.  According to coverage, 
Israel shares the President's hopes of achieving regional peace, but 
declines to acknowledge Obama's statements regarding settlements. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs a front page AFP article under the headline, 
"a new enemy of West Bank settlements:  Obama." The article quotes 
"extremist activist" Nadia Matter noting, "Obama does not scare 
us." 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs an inside AFP article about Syrian 
politicians and analysts commenting that Obama's speech will be 
complete only when it is coupled with pressure on Israel to 
translate speeches into action. 
 
Al-Quds runs separate front page coverage of Arab League Secretary 
General Musa's reaction to President Obama's Cairo speech.  He notes 
that it "was balanced and respectful and paves the road for positive 
relations with the Muslim world since it provides a new and clear 
vision of the conflict."  The paper highlights that Musa hoped to 
see Obama's remarks translated into action and facts on the ground.

-------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"Obama's speech is a blueprint for engagement between Muslims and 
the West"(06/05):  "The most notable thing about Obama's speech is 
that it touches the heart.  It presents historic facts and proves 
his determination to overcome prejudice towards the Muslim world and 
the U.S." 
 
2) Hafith Barguti opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under 
the title, "Obama's reconciliation and Israel's conflict" (06/05): 
"Obama's speech is the speech of a president who dreams of achieving 
balance in the international community... through partnership, 
justice, and peace." 
 
3) Omar Hilmi Al-Ghul opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
under the title, "Were there any surprises in the speech?"(06/05): 
"Obama's speech was a historic and untraditional speech by all 
accounts... because of the important information that it presented 
and the historic facts it highlighted thereby opening a new chapter 
in relations between the Arab and Muslim world and the U.S. in 
particular, but also the West in General." 
 
4) Samih Shbayb opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title 
"Obama's speech is a significant transition" (06/05):  "Obama's 
speech is promising and can be considered an excellent foundation 
for improving Muslim-Arab relations with the U.S.... a basis... 
which if used properly, can benefit all." 
 
5)Muhammad Yaghi opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the

JERUSALEM 00000890  003 OF 003 
 
 
can almost be considered an apology"(06/05):  "Obama's speech says 
goodbye to Bush's policies and calls for more optimism in the world 
in preparation for new policies and new bonds between the Arabs and 
Americans... [Sustaining this goodwill] will now depend on how we 
can translate these beautiful words into facts." 
 
6) Rajab Abu Sirriyah opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "Obama - From managing the crisis to solving it"(06/05): 
When President Obama addresses the Muslim world, he definitely knows 
what he is doing.  He realizes the significance of the Muslim world 
and realizes that it is key to U.S. interests, if the U.S. wants to 
rule the world." 
 
7) Bahir Salih opined on Palestine News Network online service 
(pnn.ps) under the headline, "You cannot shield yourself from the 
sun with a sieve,"(6/5):  "With his eloquent and serene words, Obama 
tried to bring Muslims and the U.S closer... In his speech, Obama 
presented himself and America as angels.  Doesn't he know that his 
soldiers have killed more than one million Muslims in Iraq?  Are all 
of [those Iraqis] 'extremists?'  Aren't they just children, women, 
the elderly and civilians?"  Aren't the hundreds of thousands killed 
in Afghanistan, just civilians as well?"
