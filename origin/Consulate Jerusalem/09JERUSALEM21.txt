SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE - JANUARY 4 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  No crossings were open in Gaza on January 4.  On 
January 3, five truckloads of medical supplies entered through Rafah 
crossing, and seven medical cases exited there.  OCHA contacts 
estimate that less than 10 percent of Gazans have electricity or 
running water, and the WFP reports that "there is a food crisis in 
Gaza."  End Summary. 
 
Crossings Update 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) No crossings were open for the movement of supplies or 
persons in Gaza on January 4, according to UNRWA, OCHA, and ICRC 
contacts.  OCHA reports that five truckloads of medical supplies 
(from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Russia) entered through 
Rafah crossing, and seven medical evacuees exited there on January 
¶3. 
 
Fuel 
---- 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNRWA and OCHA contacts confirm that 35,000 liters of 
UNRWA's diesel supply was transported to the Coastal Municipal Water 
Authority (CMWA-Gaza's water and utility company) for its water and 
sewage pumps on January 3, but CMWA reports that it has not 
distributed the fuel to its several dried-out pumps due to 
airstrikes.  UNRWA planned to transfer the remaining 40,000 liters 
on January 4, but the move was cancelled.  UNRWA contacts report 
that the Israeli commercial fuel distributive company has refused to 
transfer diesel on a back-to-back system at Kerem Shalom for 
liability reasons, and UNRWA reports that cooking gas cannot 
transfer back-to-back because it is highly flammable. 
 
Power and Water 
--------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) OCHA contacts estimate that less than 10 percent of Gazans 
have electricity or running water.  At least six of Gaza's 13 
cross-border power lines have been damaged the past two days, 
reducing overall electricity flow to about 52MW (roughly a quarter 
of recent supply), according to OCHA contacts.  OCHA also reports 
that GEDCO (Gaza's main power distributor) is concerned these 
damages may not be repairable unless Israel allows electrical spare 
parts into Gaza. 
 
WFP reports "Food Crisis" 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) UNRWA had two distribution sites open on January 4 that 
serviced approximately 2,000 people.  WFP did not distribute food on 
January 4.  WFP and UNRWA were able to distribute only limited 
amounts of food on January 3.  WFP contacts assess that Gaza's 
current food crisis stems from shortages in the market, almost 
complete closure of food stores, cooking fuel shortages, and the 
inability of aid agencies to distribute food regularly. 
 
Displacement Update 
------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) UNRWA reports that it opened two additional emergency 
shelters on January 4, raising the total to five shelters that house 
approximately 1,350 Gazans.  People are now remaining in the 
shelters throughout the day and night. UNRWA is trying to coordinate 
food distributions and the provision of blankets and mattresses in 
the shelters, but UNRWA contacts say that movement of staff is 
extremely difficult.
