Fuel Imports 
------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Nahal Oz fuel transport station is open June 
19, as Israeli company Dor Alon continues to ship all 
petroleum products to Gaza, according to several Gaza-based 
contacts.  A PA General Petroleum Authority officer told 
EconSpecialist June 19 that regular shipments resumed after 
the PA assured the Israeli supplier, Dor Alon, that the 
existing contract would be honored. 
 
Kerem Shalom Open For Humanitarian Shipments 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Gaza-based USAID staff reported that the Kerem 
Shalom commercial crossing opened June 19 for shipments of 
U.N. humanitarian goods to Gaza.  WHO Gaza Director Mahmoud 
Daher told Econoff that WHO received one truckload of medical 
supplies at Kerem Shalom June 19.  According to Daher, WFP 
and ICRC planned to receive several truckloads of food stuffs 
and medical supplies at Kerem Shalom on June 19. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to Gaza-based OCHA representative Hamada 
al-Bayari, basic food commodities and fuel remain available 
in Gaza, but prices continue to rise as food stocks decline. 
Al-Bayari said that there was much more activity in the 
markets June 19 than the previous day, but most food items 
remain available except for wheat-flour, sugar, and dairy 
products, which are now in limited supply. 
 
Crossings' Situation Fluid 
As Gunfire Exchanged; One Dead 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Erez crossing remained closed June 19, but a few 
international aid workers managed to enter Gaza June 19, 
according to WHO's Daher. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On June 18, members of the Palestinian Resistance 
Committee (PRC) approached Erez and opened fire.  In the 
resulting exchange of fire with the IDF, at least one 
Palestinian civilian was killed and up to 15 wounded.  At 
mid-day on June 19, "al-Jazeera" broadcast images of IDF 
forces dispersing Palestinians waiting at Erez; their current 
disposition is unknown.  UNRWA Gaza Director John Ging stated 
to Econoffs June 18 that Hamas' executive force members had 
established a check-point along the highway to Erez, less 
than one kilometer from the crossing.  In addition, Ging 
reported that street traffic in the City of Gaza is being 
policed by the Hamas Executive Force. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Gaza-based USAID staff report that Rafah, Sufa, and 
Karni/al-Mintar crossings were closed June 19.  Approaches to 
crossings are controlled by Hamas security forces, who have 
established check-points near all Gaza border crossings, 
according to a Gaza-based OCHA representative.  On June 18 at 
Rafah, 161 people entered Gaza from Egypt, as Hamas security 
forces manned the terminal.  EU-BAM told Econoff June 18 that 
this move was not coordinated with EU-BAM or Israel.

¶8.  (SBU) The Palestinian Center for Human Rights reported 
that from June 10-17, 146 people were killed in the violence 
in Gaza, including 36 civilians, and over 700 injured.
