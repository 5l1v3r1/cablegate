Main Stories:

All dailies lead with news citing AFP (not the New York Times) about 
a Jewish nongovernmental organization revealing on May 10, a "quiet" 
Israeli scheme" that aims to "increase the Jewish presence" in East 
Jerusalem and the Old City of Jerusalem.  According to coverage, the 
plan will include the establishment of nine public parks to surround 
the Old City and, "reflect the Jewish history of the city."  Israeli 
lawyer Daniel Seideman noted that the plan also includes the 
demolition of Jerusalem Palestinian homes without permits, an act 
that will, "jeopardize the chances for a peace settlement in 
Jerusalem." 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page coverage citing DPA that Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Abbas will form an expanded transitional 
government in the West Bank and that he will task PA Premier Fayyad 
to head it.  According to coverage, Abbas will now accept the March 
resignation of the Fayyad government. 
 
All front pages cite AFP in reporting on Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas' intention to announce the date and venue of the 
sixth Fatah party conference on May 11. According to sources, Abbas 
may announce that the conference will be held on June 20 in 
Bethlehem.  Reporting concludes that Abbas will meet on May 11 with 
representatives of Fatah, civil society, prisoners unions, popular 
committees, and Palestinian economists to finalize arrangements.  In 
related coverage, Al-Quds runs a back page cartoon showing the UN 
Security Council looking at two possible solutions to the 
"Palestinian crisis:"  the two-state solution and the two-government 
solution, Gaza and Ramallah. 
 
All dailies run front page coverage of Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu's meeting with Egyptian President Mubarak on May 11 at 
which Netanyahu will seek to convince Mubarak to join Israel in 
confronting the Iranian nuclear threat.  In related front page 
coverage, Al-Quds reports that Netanyahu has rejected withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights, citing their strategic importance. 
Reporting concludes that Netanyahu will tell President Obama that he 
cannot accept compromises that affect the security of Israel. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida run front page coverage of an AFP 
article quoting General James Jones stating that the U.S. is aware 
of the Iranian nuclear threat to regional and Israeli security, the 
threat should be a catalyst for moving towards a regional peace 
settlement. 
 
All dailies run front page coverage of an interview by Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas with Italian TV on May 10.  Abbas welcomed 
the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the Palestinian Territories as an 
opportunity for the Pope to witness firsthand Israeli restrictions 
imposed on Palestinians on a daily basis.  A related cartoon in Al 
Quds shows a Palestinian child leaving a Papal event, asking his 
mother, "how do we get home," in light of Israeli restrictions. 
News of the Pope's visit features prominently throughout the 
dailies' pages. 
 
Al- Quds' front page reports that Russia has requested a special UN 
Security Council session on May 10 to discuss, "the urgent need to 
reach a peace settlement in the Middle East." 
 
In Presidential coverage, Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam run inside photos of 
President Obama at an annual White House dinner for journalists on 
May 10.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs an op-ed from Israeli daily Haaretz

Weekend Stories: 
-------------- 
Sunday, May 10 
 
Al Ayyam introduced its lead story, an exclusive interview with 
Consul General Jake Walles, with the headline, "Walles: Washington 
is waiting for answers from Netanyahu- Obama to determine the next 
steps after completing his meetings."  Reporting noted that Walles 
confirmed that a special office will be opened in June for Special 
Envoy George Mitchell at the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem. 
Walles reiterated that the two-state solution is a priority for the 
U.S. and that President Obama and Secretary Clinton will also give 
the issue their attention. 
 
"Palestinian condemnation of Israeli measures surrounding the Papal 
visit," was news on all front pages.  According to coverage, Dr. 
Rafiq Al Hussayni, Chief of Staff of the Office of the PA President, 
told press on May 10 that, "Israel is trying to highlight throughout 
this visit that Jerusalem is a unified city and the capital of 
Israel, something that we reject and condemn." 
 
Saturday, May 9: 
 
Al-Quds' inside page carried an exclusive interview with U.S. 
Congressman Wexler.  Wexler noted that President Obama is serious 
about reaching a peace agreement through the two-state solution and 
that the U.S. will not impose any solution on either party.  He also 
noted that if Israel is serious about the peace process, it must 
halt settlement expansion and Arab countries must consider 
normalizing relations with Israel.  Wexler added that he is certain 
that the Israeli Government will continue the peace process since 
Special Envoy Mitchell is a highly capable negotiator and mediator.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"What peace with Judaism!" (05/11):  "In light of the new Israeli 
scheme to establish monument parks in Jerusalem and demolish the 
houses of Palestinians, thereby rejecting all international norms, 
and rejecting the right of return, we must ask the U.S., the Middle 
East Quartet and the EU:  What is left for Palestinians to negotiate 
with Israel?  The international parties market peace propaganda but 
they do nothing concrete on the ground to support their supposed 
desire to have peace in the Middle East.  What have they done to 
stop Israeli restrictions?... Israel has turned peace into a big 
joke." 
 
2) Regular columnist Basim Abu Sumayya opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
official daily under the title, "The Apology" 
(05/11):  "The indirect apology that Pope XVI conveyed to Muslims 
when he stood on the eastern bank of the Jordan river... where he 
noted that he deeply respects Muslims was considered inadequate and 
misunderstood, as though the Pope had intentionally ignored the 
feelings of the Muslins...in order for the Pope to [dissipate]... 
all the anger of Muslims, he should have made a direct apology[for 
his earlier position regarding the 2006 Danish cartoon about the 
prophet Mohammad]."
