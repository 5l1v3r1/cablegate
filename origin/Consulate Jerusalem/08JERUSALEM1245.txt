Main Stories: 
------------- 
The prisoners' exchange deal between Hizbollah and Israel leads in 
all dailies.  The papers report that the two parties are making 
final preparations for the July 16 exchange.  Al-Ayyam reports that 
celebrations are planned, "along the Israeli/Lebanese borders," to 
mark the occasion.  In related coverage, Al- Quds cites Israeli 
daily Yediot Ahronot in reporting on Israeli security concerns that 
Hizbollah will seek revenge for the February assassination of Imad 
Mughniyah in Damascus, once the exchange deal is complete. 
 
All dailies express outrage over the July 14 decision by the Israeli 
Supreme Court to evict Palestinian tenants from a home in the East 
Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.  Al-Quds reports that the 
house is one of 27 houses that Israeli authorities claim are, 
"Jewish owned, although they were built in the early 1950's."  Fatah 
organized a demonstration in Sheikh Jarrah to protest the act, while 
a Palestinian Authority Presidency official called the decision 
evidence of a new Israeli eviction policy, the paper adds.  In 
related coverage, Al-Quds reports that 120 Israeli settlers on July 
14 took over an abandoned Israeli military site, north of Bethlehem 
in the West Bank.  The paper notes that the settlers were protected 
by ten Israeli soldiers. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page highlights news about Nablus and Gaza:  In 
comments by Yasir 'Abd Rabbo, Secretary General of the Executive 
Committee of the PLO, during a July 14 visit to the West Bank city 
of Nablus, characterizes recent Israeli operations in the city as 
attempts to marginalize the Palestinian Authority.  Regarding Gaza, 
the front page announces that Israel will allow more goods to enter 
the Gaza Strip, if the truce holds.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
Â¶1.  Independent Al-Ayyam prints an editorial by Muhannad Abdul Hamid 
entitled, "All roads are closed to the [national] unity initiatives" 
(7/15): "...the initiative by [Palestinian Authority President] Abu 
Mazin [to begin a dialogue with Hamas] has gained special attention 
because it was presented by... the PLO's Executive Committee and the 
Presidency and because it could influence Palestinian, regional and 
international attitudes.  However ...the initiative found no 
resonance with... Hamas [and]... failed because... nothing has been 
achieved in [Palestinian-Israeli] negotiations.  In other words,... 
negotiations [have failed] as a sole means to end the occupation and 
reach a political solution which the majority of the Palestinian 
people will accept..."
