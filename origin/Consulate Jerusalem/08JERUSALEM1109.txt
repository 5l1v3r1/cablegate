THE HIZBOLLAH-ISRAEL PRISONER EXCHANGE DEAL

Main Stories: 
------------- 
The approval of a prisoners' exchange deal with Hizbollah by an 
overwhelming majority of the Israeli Government leads all dailies. 
Factual coverage outlines the details of the exchange including 
neutral comment that the deal includes the release of Lebanese Samir 
Kuntar who killed a Nahariya family in 1979, and the possible 
release of Palestinian prisoners at a later date.  Coverage further 
notes that Israeli Premier Olmert confirmed for the first time that 
the two Israeli soldiers to be exchanged are believed dead. 
 
The partial reopening of the Sufa and Nahal Oz Gaza crossing points 
to allow fuel deliveries into the Strip is front page news.  All 
papers note that the Al-Mintar crossing point used for commercial 
goods will remain closed.  Jamal Al-Khudary, Head of the Popular 
Committee for the Resistance of the Siege and Member of the 
Palestinian Legislative Council commented that current operations at 
the Gaza Strip crossing points do not inspire, "a positive or 
encouraging image of what is to come," alluding to a promise by 
Israelis to fully lift the blockade of the Gaza Strip as part of the 
cease-fire agreement with Hamas. 
 
Hamas has answered the Egyptian call for indirect negotiations with 
Israel regarding a prisoners' exchange deal for captured Israeli 
soldier Shalit, front pages reveal.  Hamas leader Al- Muzayny denied 
having set a date for the start of negotiations, saying that Hamas 
will not begin talks unless it is sure that Israel remains 
completely committed to the truce agreement, especially as concerns 
the promise to lift the blockade of Gaza. 
 
Al-Quds highlights news about the United States blocking a U.N. 
Security Council resolution to require Israel to immediately halt 
all settlement activities in the West Bank and Jerusalem.  U.S. 
Permanent Representative to the U.N. Zalmay Khalilzad defended the 
U.S. position and called the resolution imbalanced and biased 
towards one party [Palestinians] only, Al Quds reports. 
 
All dailies report on the Israeli incursion into Tubas on June 29, 
during which a special unit of undercover soldiers "assassinated" a 
17 year old Palestinian and "kidnapped" another.  The boy was 
accused of attempting to throw Molotov cocktails.  In related 
coverage, all dailies continue weekend coverage of clashes between 
Israeli Defense Forces and Palestinian, Israeli and foreign 
demonstrators against the separation barrier in the West Bank 
community Ni'lin.  Seventeen people were reported injured, papers 
note.

Al-Ayyam printed statements by Islamic Jihad leader Al-Batsh 
commenting that the truce between Hamas and Israel will eventually 
collapse if the Gaza crossing points remain closed.  Al-Batsh 
emphasized that no disputes exist between Islamic Jihad and Hamas 
and that Hamas needs the truce to prepare for future confrontations. 
 Al-Batsh is also quoted promising to retaliate for any future 
Israeli violations of the Gaza Strip truce.  In related news, 
Al-Quds prints on its front page the results of a recent opinion 
poll conducted by Near East Consulting, that shows that the majority 
of Palestinian favors the truce with Israel.  The oll showed that 
 
JERUSALEM 00001109  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
60% support direct negotiations between Hamas and Israel, while 40% 
oppose such action.  62% of Fatah supporters welcome Hamas' 
participation in negotiations while 53% of Hamas supporters rejected 
participation. 
 
All dailies report on Palestinian head negotiator Quray's press 
conference after his June 28 meeting with the Norwegian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs.  Quray confirmed that the negotiation team has 
received an invitation from the United States to hold a new round of 
negotiations in yet another attempt to conclude an agreement on the 
establishment of a Palestinian State before President Bush departs 
the White House.  The invitation from Secretary Rice invited the 
team to Washington in July.  Quray said that ongoing negotiations 
are intense because the issues being discussed are difficult.  He 
continued that there is determination to continue negotiations in 
the hope that they will bear fruit by the end of the year.

The Death of an elderly Palestinian prisoner in a Hamas Gaza jail 
made the front pages of the dailies.  The 72-year old prisoner, a 
retired Ministry Of Health employee, was arrested by the former 
Palestinian government June 25.  The prisoner reportedly died of a 
heart attack.  The Family told the press that signs of torture were 
evident on the feet of the deceased. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reported on the G-8 Japan meeting 
and the groups' call on Israel to freeze settlement activity, ease 
travel restrictions and stop violence on Palestinians.  The dailies 
reprinted the entire statement. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front paged news about the U.S. Congress 
approving a decision to increase American assistance for Israeli 
security by $170 million dollars.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1.  Al- Quds prints its daily editorial entitled, "the prisoners' 
swap...and the negotiations trip": "...it is obvious that the 
[Hizbollah] prisoners' swap that Israel approved [includes] 
prisoners with blood on their hands... so, it is now possible to say 
that this major obstacle [to the prisoner exchange deal with Hamas] 
is gone.  What is left now, is Israeli bargaining over the number 
[of prisoner's to be released]... resuming the swap agreement 
reinforces the [Hamas-Israel] truce; and vice-versa.  These 
developments will positively influence the general atmosphere in the 
region and reinforce peace efforts and serve the interests of all 
parties involved." 
 
¶2.  Under the headline, "The truce and its political 
underpinning!!!" veteran columnist Samih Shbayb writes in 
independent Al-Ayyam (06/30/08): "The truce needs a political 
underpinning and an overall organizational framework.  In this 
regard, there is absolutely no substitute for the PLO.  Hamas is an 
acceptable Palestinian party to the truce [with Israel]... but 
reinforcing this truce and sustaining it... requires a unified 
Palestinian position within one framework which is the Palestinian 
National Authority and... the PLO."
