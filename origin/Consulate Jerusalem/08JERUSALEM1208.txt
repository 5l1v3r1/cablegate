Main Stories: 
------------- 
Under banner headlines, the three dailies announce Israeli approval 
of the construction of 1,800 settlement units in the East Jerusalem 
neighborhood of Jabal Abu Ghunaym (Har Homa).  Al-Quds reports that 
official spokesperson of the Palestinian Presidency Nabil Abu 
Rudayna responded on July 9, by issuing a warning of the possible 
negative effects of the action on Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's lead photo shows ongoing construction "to 
expand" the Israeli settlement. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page reports that Israeli military broke up 
demonstrations against the separation barrier in several areas of 
the West Bank on July 9.  The demonstrations marked the 4th 
anniversary of the International Court of Justice ruling that the 
separation barrier is illegal under international law.  Several 
Palestinians were injured in clashes with Israeli Defense Forces, 
reporting notes.  In related coverage in all papers, Israeli human 
rights group B'Tselem said on July 9, that the separation barrier 
has not been rerouted in accordance with a 2004 ruling by the 
Israeli High Court of Justice.  The organization added that the 
barrier will include 12% of West Bank land and 60 settlements to be 
annexed to Israel.  The three dailies also highlight that a 
Palestinian tried on July 9 to destroy part of the barrier with a 
bulldozer in an area next to Qalandiya, near Ramallah.  Israeli 
Defense Forces prevented the action, according to the papers. 
 
Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad's joint press conference with 
Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Frattini captures front page 
headlines in all dailies.  During the July 9 press conference in 
Ramallah, Fayyad condemned a recent Israeli military operation in 
the West Bank city of Nablus and Israeli settlement activities. 
Frattini announced an additional 20 million Euros in assistance to 
the Palestinians, the articles report. 
 
Al-Ayyam writes that the Hamas delegation to Cairo delivered a 
report to Egyptian officials detailing Israeli violations of the 
truce agreement in the Gaza Strip.  According to a Hamas leader 
interviewed by Al-Ayyam on July 9, Hamas has asked for an urgent 
meeting to discuss issues concerning the Rafah crossing point in the 
southern Gaza Strip.  In related coverage in all papers, Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas emphasized during an internal meeting on 
July 9, the importance of Egyptian mediation in and subsequent 
launch of Palestinian national dialogue. 
 
On an inside page, Al-Quds briefly notes the July 9 visit of General 
Fraser to the northern West Bank city of Janin. During his visit, 
General Fraser met with the Governor of Janin and the Chief 
Commander of the Palestinian Security Forces.  The Janin Governor 
briefed the Fraser about the general situation, including civil and 
economic issues, in Janin Governorate, according to Al Quds.

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1. Independent Al-Quds prints its daily editorial entitled, "Truce 
talks, dialogue, and agreement" (7/10): "...it is obvious that the 
possibility of an agreement... or even a meeting [between Fatah and 
Hamas] has almost disappeared... The truce [with Israel in the Gaza 
Strip] will not last long for one simple and clear reason: 
Palestinian and general Arab weakness combined with Israel's ability 
to control the military, political and economic spheres.  We have to 
 
JERUSALEM 00001208  002 OF 002 
 
 
face this fact and stop selling... illusions..." 
 
¶2.  Al-Ayyam runs its main editorial under the title, "Why do we 
have to wait so long?" (7/10): "[Palestinian Authority President] 
Mahmud Abbas stirred the stillness... towards dialogue [with Hamas] 
after the Yemen initiative... Five months later, everyone is waiting 
for Abbas to... reactivate his proposal... to remove obstacles 
preventing dialogue to end Palestinian division... Internal 
Palestinian division is a fact, and all parties pretend to reject 
it, but their behavior is causing it to deepen.  So, can anyone tell 
us who is benefiting from this split, other than Israel?
