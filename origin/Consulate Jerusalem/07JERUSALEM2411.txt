¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  PA Ministry of Health (MOH) officials 
told Econoff on November 19 that recently-arrived PA security 
forces in Nablus have (1) removed armed militias from the 
hospitals; (2) allowed hospital administrators to implement 
visitor hour programs for first time since 2000 and to clear 
hallways and rooms; (3) discontinued the militia practice of 
forced medical appointments; and (4) allowed for the launch 
of Nablus PA hospital programs with area university medical 
students.  End summary. 
 
Militias Forced Out of Hospitals 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Nablus-based Ministry of Health (MOH) Director 
General For Hospitals Maim Sabra told Econoff November 19 
that Nablus hospitals have been able to serve patients "one 
hundred percent" better than prior to the deployment of PA 
security forces (PASF) to Nablus earlier in the month.  He 
said that PASF have removed militias from hospital hallways 
and rooms, many of which had been held for exclusive use by 
militia families and associates.  He claimed that health care 
professionals in Nablus hospitals are free of militia 
intimidation during work hours with PASF stationed near the 
entrances of the major Nablus hospitals. 
 
Visitor Hours Established; 
Hallways Cleared 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MOH Director General of International Cooperation 
Qasem Maani said that, for the first time in seven years, PA 
hospital directors in Nablus have successfully implemented 
visiting hours.  Hospital entrances, hallways, and rooms are 
no longer crowded with patients' family and friends around 
the clock.   Prior to the enhanced security environment, 
militia members would call and demand immediate medical 
appointments for friends and family.  Maani said that MOH 
physicians have reported that the presence of PASF has ended 
the effective intimidation behind "forced appointments." 
 
 
University Medical Program Launched 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Maani told Econoff that Minister of Health Fathi 
Abu Moughli visited Nablus' two PA hospitals on November 18. 
Abu Moughli toured the hospitals with participants of a new 
PA program initiated earlier this month, bringing area 
medical students to PA hospitals in Nablus once a week to 
assist physicians and gain valuable experience, according to 
Maani.  Without the improved security environment, this 
program would not have been possible, he said.
