SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (10/20): Palestinians skeptical 
about settlement freeze 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds leads with news citing Israeli daily Ha'aretz on Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement that the negotiations 
between Israel and the US regarding settlement construction have 
concluded, saying "we have solved the issue of settlements with the 
US. If you want to know more, you can ask the US." Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas noted that he has not 
received any information about such an agreement and clarified that 
he won't trust what is published in the Israeli press, but rather he 
will wait to hear from the US. Al-Ayyam quotes Palestinian 
Liberation Organization Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat saying "If I 
see a complete cessation of settlement activity in the Palestinian 
territories, including East Jerusalem, then I would say there is a 
US plan. As long as we don't see this, then there is no plan." In 
related news, the dailies report that Erekat travelled to the US 
yesterday to discuss ways to re-start the peace process. 
 
The local press highlights news on Fatah Central Committee member 
Muhammad Dahlan accusing Hamas of "being more dishonest than Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu." Dahlan said the Hamas 
reservations on the Egyptian proposal are a "new lie" to evade 
signing the agreement. Dahlan also accused Al-Jazeera of incitement. 
 
 
Hamas newspaper Al-Resalah quotes legal experts stating that 
President Abbas has no legal or legislative authority to issue a 
decree for holding presidential and legislative elections, arguing 
that he lost his presidential authority on January 9, 2009. 
 
Al-Quds Hamas radio, airing from Gaza, reports on Secretary General 
of the Hamas ministerial cabinet Mouhammad Awad denying news that 
the Haniyeh government is facing a financial crisis. However, Awad 
asked Arab and Muslim countries to support Hamas as it faces the 
challenges and obstacles resulting from the siege.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "What 
agreement on settlement activity?" (10/20): "No doubt that there is 
an agreement between Israel and the US regarding settlement activity 
in light of the US reversing their position calling for a complete 
settlement freeze. We have been watching the Israelis expand 
settlements in Jerusalem and the West Bank without fearing 
anything." 
 
2) Rajabu Abu Sirriyeh opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under 
the title "The solution is through the elections" (10/20): "All the 
Palestinian factions, except Hamas, will be in favor of holding the 
presidential and legislative elections on time because they believe 
that this will be the only way to end the current state of 
division."
