SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/18): Palestinian press 
highlights US reaction to Israel's expansion of settlements in 
Jerusalem 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies highlight the Israeli government's approval of the 
construction of 900 housing units in the Gilo settlement. The 
coverage notes that the US expressed disappointment in this step. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that Jerusalem is 
the capital of Israel and any cessation of settlements will exclude 
Jerusalem. In its coverage of US reaction, Al-Ayyam reported that 
"The White house expressed great regret of this decision," while 
Al-Quds reported that "Washington opposes the step." Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida used the word "Musta'a" to say that the US was annoyed by 
the step. 
 
Palestinian Authority (PA) spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina condemned 
this step, saying "it harms the negotiations and jeopardizes the two 
state solution." He added that this step conveys a message from the 
Israelis to the Americans. 
In related news, the three dailies report on the Israeli authorities 
demolishing two houses in the Beit Hanina and Silwan neighborhoods 
of East Jerusalem due to lack of building permits. 
 
Al-Quds runs a separate front page story on news that 50 American 
Jews traveled to Israel to buy houses in East Jerusalem and the West 
Bank in reaction to President Obama's continued calls on Israel to 
halt settlement activity. 
 
The dailies report on Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt saying 
yesterday that "in order for the EU to recognize a Palestinian state 
there must be a state first" and therefore it is too early to talk 
about recognition. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news on 
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Chief Negotiator Saeb 
Erekat reacting to Bildt's statement by saying "Now is the 
appropriate time to recognize the Palestinian state." 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page news quoting Azzam Al-Ahmad, head of Fatah 
parliamentary block in the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) as 
saying that the PLO Central Council will extend the term of 
President Abbas until the next elections to avoid any constitutional 
vacuum.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
 
Wadi Nassar opines in Al-Quds under the title "The International 
Community Won't Liberate Palestine" (11/18): "Despite the 
encouraging statements from President Obama, it is obvious that the 
US can't or is not interested in forcing Israel to respect 
international law ... In order for the Palestinians to have a state, 
they have to stick to Salam Fayyad's plan and end the state of 
division, which is becoming an excuse for Israel and the 
international community to neglect their obligations towards the 
Palestinians."
