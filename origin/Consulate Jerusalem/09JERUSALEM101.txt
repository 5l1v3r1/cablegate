¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  President Abbas, in a press conference with 
President Mubarak January 10, called on HAMAS and Israel to accept 
the UNSC resolution immediately and said the Egyptian proposal is 
the means to implement the resolution.  He said Palestinian 
reconciliation is necessary, but that peace -- not resistance -- 
should be the goal.  He also said the PA wants an international 
presence in Gaza.  Israeli military operations continued January 
9-10 in northern Gaza, Khan Yunis and Rafah, with the heaviest 
fighting taking place on the outskirts of Gaza City.  The IDF moved 
closer to urban centers in Gaza City and Khan Yunis, and maintained 
positions throughout the Gaza Strip.  Airstrikes in Gaza City and 
Rafah damaged homes, tunnels, workshops, and, in one incident, a 
building housing several media offices.  Gaza-based medical sources 
reported as many as 801 dead and 3325 wounded since hostilities 
began.  A humanitarian pause is underway from 1300-1600, but 
fighting continues.  UNRWA and ICRC say they will resume movement 
inside Gaza "as soon as possible," like on Sunday.  End summary. 
 
Political Developments 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a press conference in Cairo January 10, President Abbas 
called on HAMAS and Israel to accept the UNSC resolution immediately 
and said the Egyptian proposal is the mechanism to implement it.  He 
said the PA wants international forces in Gaza.  He denied that a 
meeting with Israeli PM Olmert is in the works.  Abu Mazen said 
HAMAS is part of the Palestinian people, adding that peace -- not 
resistance -- should be the Palestinians' goal, and that Palestinian 
reconciliation will be necessary after the crisis. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A HAMAS delegation arrived in Cairo January 9 to discuss 
the Egyptian proposal with senior Egyptian officials.  HAMAS 
Political Bureau member Muhammad Nazal told the press that all 
crossings into Gaza must be opened.

37 Palestinians.

pause that would take place from 1300-1600 local on January 10.  The 
UN announced that it would resume activity in Gaza "as soon as 
possible" after receiving credible assurances January 9 that the IDF 
would respect the security of UN personnel and equipment.  ICRC 
stated that it will continue key activities in Gaza -- such as the 
work of its surgical team at al-Shifa Hospital -- but that it will 
not conduct relief convoys.  The UN reported that over 24,000 Gazans 
are currently displaced.
