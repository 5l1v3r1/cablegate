REFS:  A) Jerusalem 452; B) State 59964 
 
¶1.  (U) Ref A described the situation at post since late 2008, when 
the GOI informed Embassy Tel Aviv that EFMs of official Americans 
assigned to ConGen Jerusalem are not eligible for Israeli work 
permits.  This GOI decision has had a serious, negative impact on 
post's morale and recruiting efforts.  In Ref A, Post requested the 
Department's assistance in rectifying this situation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post would like to express its appreciation for work done 
by NEA, L, FLO, and Protocol in response to Ref A, leading to a June 
3 meeting in Washington with representatives of the Israeli Embassy 
(Ref B).  Post understands that Israeli Embassy participants 
acknowledged the Department's request for a practical working 
arrangement on work permits for ConGen Jerusalem EFMs, but declined 
to comment on how the GOI might respond. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As noted in Ref B, Department participants in the June 3 
meeting requested a response from the GOI as soon as possible.  With 
three weeks having passed since the June 3 meeting without a 
response, post recommends that the Department begin taking steps to 
impose reciprocity on Israeli diplomats posted at Israeli consulates 
in the United States. 
 
¶4.  (U) Post again thanks the Department for its support and 
consideration on this matter.
