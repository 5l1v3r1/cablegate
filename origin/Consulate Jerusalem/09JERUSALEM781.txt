SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (05/12):  PALESTINIAN FRUSTRATION 
WITH NETANYAHU'S REFUSAL OF TWO-STATE SOLUTION 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmud Abbas' remarks about the 
formation of a new Palestinian Authority government in the next 48 
hours are highlighted on all front pages.  The dailies also quote PA 
Premier Fayyad stressing that one of the new government's priorities 
will be to ensure the success of ongoing national dialogue (unity 
talks).  Al-Ayyam reports that the PLO has welcomed the move stating 
that such a government will not be an obstacle to reaching agreement 
on a "national consensus" government.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida quotes 
Yassir Abd Rabbo confirming that the new government will be 
announced on May 12. 
 
All front pages highlight reports on Abbas' announcement in Ramallah 
on May 11 that Fatah's sixth party convention will be held on July 
1, "in the homeland," and that it will be attended by more than 
1,200 members. 
 
The Pope's visit receives prominent coverage in the local press. 
Leading with the story, Al-Quds highlights the Pope's remarks 
calling on Israelis and Palestinians to, "coexist in peace."  The 
dailies also spotlight the Palestinian Authority's welcoming of his 
visit to Palestinian areas.  Al-Quds quotes Palestinian Chief 
Justice of the Shari'a Courts Taysir Tamimi calling on the Pope to 
intervene and, "end Palestinian suffering." 
 
Coverage of Israeli Premier Netanyahu's visit to Egypt appears on 
all front pages.  The articles report that Egypt's President Mubarak 
and Netanyahu have "publicly confirmed" their differences concerning 
the two-state solution.  Al-Ayyam quotes Palestinian Authority 
spokesman Nabil Abu Rudaynah calling Netanyahu's remarks in Egypt, 
"useless," and not conducive to ending the conflict. 
 
The dailies front-page coverage on the May 11 U.N. Security Council 
resolution that passed unanimously in support of the two-state 
solution.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that U.N. Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice have both called on 
Israel to end its policies of settlement expansion and home 
demolitions.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1)  Independent Al-Quds editorializes in "Netanyahu Reiterates His 
Position in Egypt," (5/12):  "During his first visit as Israel's 
Premier, Benyamin Netanyahu ... has reiterated his position 
regarding a peaceful resolution:  He ignored the two-state solution 
and instead advocated for a peace based on economic, security and 
political concerns.  Such a position is a miserable attempt to dodge 
the [real] requirements of a solution, those identified by the rest 
of the world...  It is safe to say that Netanyahu's visit to Egypt- 
even noting the absence of [Israeli Foreign Minister] Lieberman- has 
contributed nothing to the peace process except for a worsening of 
the impasse and even, a move backwards." 
 
2) Under the headline, "The worst is yet to come: What if Netanyahu 
utters the two-state solution phrase?" Palestinian commentator 
George Jogman writes in independent daily Al-Ayyam (5/12):  "Who has 
adopted the [two-state solution] plan?  President Obama has.  His 
Secretary of State Clinton, his Chief of Staff Emanuel, and his Vice 
President Biden all have.  The last two even declared [their 
support] for the two-state solution at the Zionist lobby's AIPAC 
convention... Such an act has its own important implications.  It 
indicates that the [two-state solution] has been unanimously adopted 
 
JERUSALEM 00000781  002 OF 002 
 
 
by the various government institutions of the U.S.  It also 
indicates that the Zionist lobby itself has accepted [the two-state 
solution] and expects Netanyahu to declare his recognition of [the 
two-state solution] as well."
