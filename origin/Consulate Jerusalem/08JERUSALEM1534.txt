In a trio of articles leading its reporting, Al-Quds reports on a 
number of Israeli actions in Jerusalem.  The top story reports that 
Israeli sources revealed on August 19 that Israeli authorities last 
week approved the implementation of a plan to establish 400 housing 
units on 80 dunums of land at the Neve Ya'cov settlement in East 
Jerusalem.  The related two articles report on developments at the 
Al Aqsa compound.  Al-Quds writes that Minister of Waqf and 
Religious Affairs, Sheikh Jamal Bawatneh, declared that the efforts 
made by Arab, Islamic and Palestinian to "rescue" the Maghrabi Gate 
are insufficient and that the Palestinian Authority, as well as the 
governments of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Qatar, and other Arab and 
Islamic countries, should more strongly denounce Israeli actions at 
the Gate.  Bawatneh's speech coincided with the 39th anniversary of 
the burning of Al-Aqsa Mosque.  Citing a WAFA report, Al Quds states 
that the Palestinian Prime Minister's Counselor for Jerusalem 
Affairs said that "high sensitivity" cameras were placed by the 
Israeli authorities at the Lion Gate's area in the Old City of 
Jerusalem on August 18 and called this a new violation of the 
sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque.  He added that the purpose of these 
cameras is to impose more restrictions on the entry of Muslim 
worshippers to Al-Aqsa Mosque, and noted that they were installed 
just before the holy month of Ramadan begins. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with developments on the 
Palestinian national dialogue front.  Al-Ayyam cites AFP and Reuters 
reports published in the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram that Egypt has 
invited the Palestinian factions to meet next week with Egyptian 
officials in Cairo to prepare for a comprehensive Palestinian 
dialogue.  Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida report that the 
Palestinian factions will start arriving in Egypt as of Monday, 
August 25.  In related coverage in Al-Quds, the Hamas leader, Salah 
Al-Bradwil, denied that Hamas wants a country other than Egypt to 
mediate. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlight news about the visit of 
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to Saudi Arabia on 
August 19.  The two dailies cite news agency reports that Abbas met 
with King Abdullah to discuss the latest developments in the 
Palestinian cause and possibilities for cooperation between the two 
countries. 
 
Al-Quds prints an interview with PLO Chief Negotiator Sa'eb Erekat 
previewing the upcoming visit by Secretary of State Rice to the 
Palestinian Territories.  Erekat says Rice will arrive in the region 
on August 25 and will start her tour by meeting with the Palestinian 
Chief Negotiator Ahmed Qurei'a.  He also tells the paper that the 
following day Rice will hold a meeting with the Israelis and the 
Palestinians at the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, and then meet with 
President Abbas in Ramallah. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports news from AFP that the Israeli Defense 
Ministry announced on August 19 the closure of the borders between 
the Gaza Strip and Israel through August 21.  This is in response to 
the firing of a rocket from Gaza into Israel, in violation of the 
Israel-Hamas truce agreed to on July 19. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlights news broadcasted on Israeli Radio that 
the meeting between the Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, and 
the Palestinian Chief Negotiator, Ahmed Qurei'a, on August 18 was 
successful.

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs a daily editorial entitled, "A Step in 
the Road to Releasing Thousands of Prisoners" (8/20): "Each 
Palestinian prisoner released by Israel reduces the burden and 
suffering of the Palestinian people in general and of the prisoner's 
friends and relatives in particular. ... [While] this step, even if 
it is symbolic ..., is important...  [it] will not close the 
prisoners file ... or end the suspicions of the Palestinian people 
about the seriousness of the Israelis towards achieving a just peace 
...  What is requested is that the prisoner issue be given the 
concern it deserves in the negotiations with Israel ... [The 
continued imprisonment of thousands] ...deprives the Palestinian 
people of their efforts, creativity, and enthusiasm to build their 
homeland ..." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam runs a daily editorial by Hani Habib 
entitled, "Cairo's questions ... and 'Cheating' on the Answer 
Sheet!!" (8/20): "...[T]he Palestinian factions, the left wing and 
Islamic Jihad try their best to instill hope that an agreement 
between the Palestinian factions is imminent ... the release of 
[some] political prisoners by Hamas and Fatah paved the way to 
launching a dialogue, but they soon find reasons to close all doors 
of hope and things go back to the way they were ... it seems the 
factions do not tire of continuous efforts ... the questionnaire 
[which Egypt prepared for the Palestinian factions to answer before 
starting dialogue] is the best example of this... the Egyptian 
corrector of the questionnaire should not be surprised to see 
similar answers [from the factions].  [For example], the Hamas 
government refused the presence of Arab forces in the Gaza Strip, so 
did other factions.  This similarity reveals "cheating".  [Egypt] 
will find that cheating occurred in more than one question and 
answer.  Cairo may hold direct talks to uncover the reasons and 
pretexts for these answers. Then, it will also realize that cheating 
[is occurring in] political speeches as well..."
