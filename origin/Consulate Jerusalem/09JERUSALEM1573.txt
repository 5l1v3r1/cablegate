SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (09/01): Palestinians Continue 
Calls for Complete Settlement Freeze 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The three dailies lead with news on Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor 
Lieberman criticizing Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister 
Salam Fayyad's plan for ending the occupation and building the 
institutions of an independent Palestinian state in two years. 
Lieberman warned the Palestinians against implementing such a plan 
irregardless of the progress of negotiations and expressed his 
skepticism about achieving any positive dialogue with the 
Palestinians, according to coverage. 
 
The dailies also lead with Fayyad noting during his meeting with 
European Union Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana August 31 in 
Ramallah that building an independent Palestinian state is a 
"Palestinian responsibility." Solana stressed in a joint press 
conference with Fayyad that the EU fully supports this plan and 
called for the complete cessation of settlement activity. 
 
All dailies run front page coverage on PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb 
Erekat noting on August 31 from Qatar that the PA has not been told 
about a new US peace plan for the Middle East, stressing that all 
parties must abide by their Road Map obligations. Erekat also noted 
that the Israeli cessation of settlement activity is an obligation 
that should be met by Israel in order to pave the way for successful 
negotiations. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page news citing Reuters on Senior Fatah leader 
Nabil Shaath noting to the press on August 31 that PA President 
Mahmoud Abbas will not re-start negotiations with Israel unless the 
latter completely halts all settlement activity in the West Bank and 
Jerusalem. ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "No 
negotiations parallel to the settlements" (09/01): "President Obama 
has to understand that the Palestinian people fully support the 
position of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas not to 
re-start negotiations with Israel unless there is a freeze in 
settlement activity, including Jerusalem. The continuation of 
settlement construction will jeopardize any initiative to end the 
conflict and achieve peace." 
 
 
 
2) Hani Al-Masri opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
headline "The US peace initiative" (09/01):" Without  real US and 
international pressure exerted on Israel to force it to accept the 
international laws and resolutions for ending the occupation and 
recognizing the rights of the Palestinian people ... the US peace 
initiative will not do the region any good. On the contrary, it will 
harm all efforts for achieving regional peace and security and will 
grant Israel more time to complete its settlement construction."
