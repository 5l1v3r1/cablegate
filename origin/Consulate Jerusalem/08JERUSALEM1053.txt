¶1.  (SBU) An Egyptian-brokered ceasefire covering the Gaza 
Strip took effect at 0600 on June 19, and there have not been 
any significant security incidents in the area as of 1700 
local on June 20.  While a Hamas spokesman complained an 
Israeli navy vessel strafed the Gaza shoreline on June 19, 
there are no reports of Israeli military activity in the 
Strip or its airspace, nor any reports of rockets, mortars or 
cross-border gunfire. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Hamas and PIJ military wings (Izz al-Din 
al-Qassam Brigades and al-Quds Brigades respectively) and the 
Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) all released statements 
pledging respect for the ceasefire, but warning they will 
retaliate for "Israeli violations."  Local contacts report 
Hamas security men have set up checkpoints and observation 
posts in areas commonly used to fire rockets and mortars, 
mainly in the northern Gaza Strip. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On June 19, 51 truckloads of goods (47 private, 4 
humanitarian organization) entered the Gaza Strip via Sufa 
crossing.  315,000 liters of industrial fuel (a one-day 
supply for Gaza's power plant), 100,000 liters of diesel and 
125 metric tons of cooking oil were piped through Nahal Oz 
terminal on June 19.  50 truckloads of wheat and animal feed 
entered Gaza via the Karni/al-Mintar conveyor belt.  Kerem 
Shalom crossing and the back-to-back terminals at 
Karni/al-Mintar remained closed June 19-20.  Rafah Crossing 
remained closed except for a small number of humanitarian 
cases reportedly permitted by Egypt.
