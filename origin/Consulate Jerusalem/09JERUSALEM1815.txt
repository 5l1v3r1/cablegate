SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (10/14): Egypt continues to work 
with Fatah and Hamas for national reconciliation 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
News on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas inaugurating a 
number of developmental projects at the Arab American University in 
Jenin governorate receives prominent coverage in all dailies. Abbas 
reiterated in his remarks during the visit that the Israeli 
government must halt all settlement activities, particularly in 
Jerusalem, in order to pave the way for resuming final status 
negotiations. He also added that the PA is determined to achieve 
national reconciliation. Abbas skeptically inquired about Hamas' 
position on the Goldstone report and urged them not to use it as an 
excuse to avoid national reconciliation. 
 
The dailies continue to report on Palestinian national 
reconciliation efforts. An Egyptian official noted yesterday that 
Fatah and Hamas will sign the national reconciliation agreement 
separately in light of Hamas' refusal to attend the signing ceremony 
that was originally scheduled for October 25. Fatah leader Muhammad 
Dahlan and Secretary General of the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization Executive Committee Yasser Abed Rabbo noted in a press 
conference yesterday that Fatah agreed to sign the national 
reconciliation agreement separately. Dahlan and Abed Rabbo also 
urged President Abbas to issue a presidential decree that sets 
January 25, 2010 as the date for holding presidential and 
legislative elections if Hamas continues to avoid national 
reconciliation. 
 
The dailies quote State Department Spokesperson Philip Crowley 
saying that the US supports the Palestinian reconciliation if it 
adheres to the Quartet principles, including the recognition of 
Israel, respecting previously signed agreements between Israel and 
the PA, and the renunciation of violence. In related news, an 
Egyptian official denied reports in the Israeli daily Ha'aretz 
stating that the US did not support the reconciliation agreement 
between Fatah and Hamas because it may hinder the negotiations with 
Israel, according to reports. 
 
News on tomorrow's UN Human Rights Council emergency session 
receives front page coverage in all dailies. Citing AFP, the dailies 
report that among many other agenda items, the Goldstone report will 
be discussed in this session. Yasser Abed Rabbo noted that the PA 
has been working hard to ensure the necessary votes in support of 
the report. 
 
The dailies report on an Israeli plan to demolish 150 homes in 
various neighborhoods of East Jerusalem by the end of 2009.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title 
"Harmful positions to the homeland" (10/14): "The Palestinians are 
surprised that the Goldstone report has evoked the hatred between 
the two parties [Fatah and Hamas] and jeopardized the national 
reconciliation efforts. Instead of punishing the Israelis for its 
actions ... it seems that the two parties are happy with the state 
of division. They are not serious about overcoming obstacles and 
bridging the gaps." 
 
2) Dr. Ibrahim Abrash opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title "Policy is not measured by intentions but  by practices" 
(10/14): "Obama has been awarded the Nobel Prize before he completed 
 
JERUSALEM 00001815  002 OF 002 
 
 
his first year in office, and before the world saw his real 
intentions or capabilities to achieve peace in the world. He has not 
succeeded so far in solving any of the problems in the world and has 
not fulfilled any of his promises. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq 
are still going on, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is getting more 
complicated ... and the problems with Iran and North Korea are still 
pending. So, on what basis was he awarded the prize?"
