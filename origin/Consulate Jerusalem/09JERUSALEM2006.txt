SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/6): Palestinians disappointed 
in President Abbas's announcement that he will not run in the next 
presidential elections 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies lead with news on Palestinian Authority President 
Mahmoud Abbas's speech last night announcing that he will not run in 
the next presidential election. A headline in Al-Quds quotes Abbas 
saying "We were surprised to see the US favoring the Israeli 
position- it's time to put an end to the longest misery in our 
modern history." Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam front page news on the White 
House reaction to Abbas's statements, saying "President Abbas has 
always been a real partner" to the US. 
 
Al-Quds runs separate front page coverage on the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization (PLO) Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat 
reiterating that Abbas's position is not a ploy or negotiating 
tactic. He stated that Abbas believes that "It is hard to coexist 
with the settlements and Israeli measures in Jerusalem." 
 
The three dailies report on large marches that took place in West 
Bank cities after Abbas's announcement to urge him to change his 
position and consider running. The coverage also notes that the PLO 
Central Committee and Executive Committee members stressed that 
Abbas remains the sole candidate for president. 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages news on Fatah Foreign Affairs Commissioner 
Nabil Shaath noting that the US retreat on its policy regarding 
settlement activity has created a "serious political crisis." 
 
Hamas newspaper Al-Resalah reports that the US is not worried that 
Abbas will not run in the next election, saying that they would 
prefer someone like PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad or Fatah leader 
Mohammed Dahlan. The report notes that US officials held strategic 
meetings with Fayyad and Dahlan at the White House to explore this 
possibility. 
 
The UN General Assembly's endorsement of a resolution that calls on 
the Palestinians and Israelis to conduct "credible" investigations 
regarding the allegations of war crimes during the last conflict in 
Gaza received coverage in all three dailies. The report notes that 
the US voted against the resolution. 
------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "Abu 
Mazen's Message..." (11/6): "President Abbas is extremely 
disappointed in the change in President Obama's position and the US 
adoption of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's position regarding 
the situation... The only thing that may make Abu Mazen change his 
mind is to achieve real progress in the peace process and to see the 
US impose greater pressure on Israel regarding settlements and 
Jerusalem."
