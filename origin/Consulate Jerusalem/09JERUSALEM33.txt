Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with red-font headlines that continue weekend 
reporting on the Israeli "aggression" on Gaza.  In photo coverage, 
Al Quds leads with an oversized photo of a frightened, crying 
Palestinian girl, while Al Ayyam runs a photo of an Israeli tank 
firing on the Strip.  Al Hayat Al Jadida's lead photo shows the 
bodies of dead Palestinians at a Gaza hospital and reports that 
Palestinian rockets continue to shower onto Israeli towns as the 
U.N. Security Council fails to adopt a statement on Gaza.  All 
papers report on the number of Palestinian dead and wounded, with 
numbers ranging from 512-518 dead and 2,400-2,650 wounded.  The 
papers also cite Israeli military statements in reporting on the 
killing of an Israeli officer and wounding of 38 Israeli soldiers in 
the ground operation.  All front pages cite Israeli daily Yedeot 
Aharanot in further reporting that Israel is demanding the 
establishment of a buffer zone along the Gaza-Egypt border area to 
prevent arms smuggling.  Al Quds adds in a "last minute" front page 
item citing AFP, that Israeli Premier Olmert has refused calls by 
Russia, France and Germany to halt the Israeli operation on Gaza. 
 
Comments made by Vice President Dick Cheney to CBS are highlighted 
on Al Quds' front page and in Al Ayyam's inside reporting.  Cheney 
stated that Israel has not asked for U.S. approval of a ground 
operation in Gaza nor informed the U.S. of the goals or timing of 
the operation.  The papers also report that Secretary of State Rice 
cancelled a visit to China because of recent "developments" in the 
Middle East. 
 
"U.S. foils U.N. Security Council move to adopt statement calling 
for immediate ceasefire" in Gaza, according to Al Ayyam's front 
page.  In further U.N. news, the paper cites AFP in front page 
reporting on Arab League Secretary General Amr Musa's January 4 
statement that there is no guarantee that Arab states will succeed 
in obtaining a binding Security Council resolution to force Israel 
to halt its "offensive" on Gaza.  Musa's statements were made upon 
his departure with an Arab delegation to the U.N in New York, the 
paper notes. 
 
PLO reaction to events in Gaza is reported on Al Quds' front page. 
The paper highlights that the PLO's Executive Committee released a 
statement after its January 4 meeting calling on Arab states to 
protect Gaza against the "on-going killing and destruction." 
Coverage also includes statements by Palestinian Authority President 
Abbas calling on all Palestinian factions should agree to unity 
talks. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page notes the surprise visit by Jordan's 
Foreign Minister Al Bashir to Cairo on January 4, where he stated 
that Jordan reserves the right to reconsider relations with any 
country, "especially Israel."  Al Quds' front page quotes Jordan's 
King Abdullah also hinting that he might, "reconsider relations with 
Israel" and stating that, "Jordan will do everything to stop the 
aggression." 
 
In international reaction to events in Gaza, Al Quds' front page 
cites AFP in reporting on Russia's decision to send Middle East 
envoy Sultanov to the region to seek a cease-fire to the current 
crisis in Gaza.  The reporting also notes that Russia has called for 
an international conference to discuss Middle East issues and an end 
to the Israeli blockade on Gaza.  In another front page article, the 
paper runs January 4 statements by French President Sarkozy 
demanding that the "war in Gaza stop."  Sarkozy made the statements 
 
JERUSALEM 00000033  002 OF 003 
 
 
in Cairo after a meeting of the EU troika and Egyptian Foreign 
Minister Abu Al Ghayt, the paper notes.  An inside report in Al 
Hayat Al Jadida cites AFP in reporting on statements by Czech 
Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg calling a previous EU Presidency 
statement that Israel's operations in Gaza were "self-defense", "a 
misunderstanding."  Schwarzenberg added that, "no country should 
attack civilians even within the framework of defensive acts," 
according to the report. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida and Al Quds front page warnings by the 
Palestinian telephone company that land and mobile telephone and 
internet services in Gaza may collapse at any time due to "severe 
damage sustained from the fighting."

WEEKEND STORIES: 
----------------- 
Sunday, January 4 
 
"Israeli army launches ground offensive in the Gaza Strip- 470 
martyrs and 2,400 wounded over the past eight days - the resistance 
promises confrontation," according to dramatic lead headlines in Al 
Quds and Al Ayyam.  Coverage highlighted Israeli Army announcements 
that the ground operation "will continue for several days" and that 
the Israeli Cabinet stressed that the aim of the offensive was to 
"control" the areas from which rockets are being fired into Israel. 
Israeli jets continued their bombing campaign of civilian targets 
including mosques and gas stations while Palestinian resistance 
continued preparations "to confront this aggression... warning that 
Israeli forces will pay dearly," according to the reports. 
 
Al Ayyam's and Al Quds' front pages reported on a series of measures 
announced by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to mitigate the impact 
of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip on the civilian 
population.  Measures will include housing assistance and 
coordinated efforts with private sector entities and the UN. The 
papers also front paged news about, "continued popular 
demonstrations in the West Bank and 'inside the green line' against 
the aggression." 
 
"Hamas and Islamic Jihad propose new terms for a ceasefire," 
according to Al Quds' front page.  Reporting that cites London-based 
Al Hayat daily, explains that the groups announced on January 3 that 
they will not accept a ceasefire unless it includes the end of "the 
siege" on Gaza, the re-opening of border crossings, and new terms 
for a ceasefire.  A high ranking Hamas official said that time was 
on Hamas' side and that the Israelis are incapable of achieving 
victory.  He also told Al Hayat that the group has already started 
using new rockets with a range of 56 kilometers and noted that 
Israel's targeting of Gaza civilians is meant to incite the public 
against Hamas, reporting concludes. 
 
All dailies and several Arab on-line news agencies ran extensive 
text from a U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem press release detailing 
current humanitarian aid to Gaza. 
 
Saturday, January 3 
 
All front pages highlighted, "White House: Israel has the right to 
defend itself- Rice calls for a permanent and durable ceasefire." 
The papers run January 2 statements by President Bush noting that 
the U.S. is working towards reaching a "serious" ceasefire in the 
Gaza Strip that would include mechanisms to stop the smuggling of 
weapons.  Reporting notes that the White House earlier announced 
that the decision to launch a ground operation in the Gaza Strip was 
 
JERUSALEM 00000033  003 OF 003 
 
 
a decision for Israel alone, since it falls within the framework of 
Israel's right to defend itself.  The White House "only" expressed 
hope that Israel would avoid civilian casualties, reporting noted. 
The papers ran extensive quotes by Secretary of State Rice from 
January 2 regarding a permanent ceasefire that would prevent a 
return to a situation where Hamas could continue rocket attacks on 
Israel from the Gaza Strip. 
 
All front pages highlight civilian suffering caused by Israeli air 
raids:  "Day 7 of the massacre: 431 martyrs and 2,280 wounded." 
Headlines also noted Egypt's request to Israel not to launch a 
ground operation in the Gaza Strip and comments by Hamas leader 
Misha'al that Israeli air raids have failed to diminish Hamas' 
military capabilities.  Finally, U.N. calls for a comprehensive 
truce and the return of the Gaza Strip to Palestinian Authority 
control was noted in reporting.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1) George Jaqaman opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Conditions 
for the upcoming truce: Choices and difficulties" (01/05): "It seems 
unlikely that Hamas will accept a return to the 2005 [Rafah] 
crossing agreement sponsored by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice... on the other hand, the [Palestinian Authority] won't accept 
Hamas' control of the crossing... the possible compromise 
solution...is... full [EU] control of the crossing, including the 
Palestinian side [of the crossing]... 
 
2) Columnist Azam Abu Al Sud writes in Al Quds under the title, "Why 
are we the only ones who have to respect agreements?" (01/05): 
"Agreements are made to be violated... this is the law of the jungle 
practiced by the strong... when will we feel strong enough to 
violate agreements that are totally or partially violated by the 
other side?  Why don't we amend or seek to amend agreements as 
circumstances and international and regional power dimensions 
change?  Why don't we amend agreements that did and continue to do 
us injustice everyday?  Why do we respect agreements with Israel and 
don't respect our agreements with each other?"
