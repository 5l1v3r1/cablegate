¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Israeli immigration practices are limiting 
West Bank enterprises' ability to conduct business, according 
to contacts working on the planned Rawabi housing/commercial 
estate.  Because only companies and NGOs registered in Israel 
can apply for Israeli work permits, West Bank companies, like 
Rawabi, cannot get work permits for their non-Palestinian 
consultants, employees, or investors.  This restriction 
forces overseas hires to enter the West Bank on tourist 
visas, subjecting them to the risk of deportation.  The 
continued use of the "PA only" stamp at Allenby (reftels) 
further limits the employees' travel and effectiveness. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary continued:  An American Citizen employee of 
Rawabi was recently delayed and questioned for eleven hours 
at the Allenby crossing before being permitted to enter. 
Although she informed Israeli officials that her job in 
Ramallah required frequent travel to Israel, she received a 
"PA-only" stamp.  End summary. 
 
Eleven Hours at Allenby 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Upon returning from Amman in early October, a 
23-year old Amcit employee of Rawabi developer, Bayti, was 
delayed and questioned for eleven hours by GOI officials at 
the Allenby crossing.  She said she told them she worked for 
a private company in Ramallah, owned by Bashar Masri, and 
that she had left Israel to Jordan so as not to overstay the 
terms of her three-month tourist visa.  During the course of 
the day, she claims to have been informed that the Ministry 
of Interior intended to arrest her for immigration violations 
and/or deport her. 
 
¶4. (SBU) She claims that different Israeli officials argued 
(in front of her) about what to do with her, noting that she 
worked for Masri, who is well known to GOI officials who work 
on West Bank economic issues.  After many rounds of 
questioning, she was given an entry stamp restricting her 
travel to "PA-areas" only.  She reiterated that her work 
requires regular travel to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for 
meetings with Israelis, but was rebuffed.  Fearing 
deportation, she says she accepted the "PA-only" restriction 
and will abide by it, despite the fact that it hampers her 
ability to do her job for Rawabi. 
 
You Need a Work Visa (But Can't Get One) 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Over the course of her eleven hours at Allenby, the 
Amcit (who has no family ties to the West Bank or Gaza) was 
repeatedly told that she was "working illegally" in the West 
Bank, and that she needed to get a "work visa" and "stop 
pretending to be a tourist."  She says she clarified that she 
has always been upfront about her work in Ramallah, and she 
asked the MOI official what the process is to secure a work 
visa.  She claims he did not reply. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Negotiations Support Unit (NSU) Legal Advisor Hala 
Rashed clarified that there is no documentation that will 
satisfy all elements of the GOI at the Israeli-controlled 
points of entry other than an Israeli work visa.  However, 
she said, to get a work visa, she said, the company or NGO in 
the West Bank must also have a branch in Israel, which can 
secure Israeli work visas for its employees in the West Bank. 
 As a result, she said, such visas are "virtually ungettable" 
for foreigners working in Palestinian companies. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Contacts working in Ramallah confirmed that the 
customary practice is to go to Amman every three months, with 
proof of employment, and renew their visas upon re-entry. 
Rashed said her own "work visa" is actually a B2 tourist 
visa, which the  GOI granted for six months upon reviewing 
her contract with the PA.  Post is aware that another Amcit 
and former NSU advisor, Fuad Bateh, was not allowed to 
re-enter via Allenby on June 28 to return to his job at the 
Palestinian Water Authority.  He was permitted to enter via 
Ben Gurion on September 23, after high-level intervention 
from the PA.  Note:  We know from other cases that "special 
treatment" for NSU employees is a result of the direct 
intervention of PLO Chief Negotiator -- and NSU boss -- Sa'eb 
Erekat.  End note. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The lack of clarity and flexibility at crossings for 
international workers in the West Bank, coupled with the 
continued use of the "PA-only" stamp, hampers the ability of 
companies and NGOs in the West Bank to hire and retain the 
talent they need.  In the absence of PA immigration control 
over Palestinian areas, if there is a desire to promote 
foreign investment in the West Bank, Israeli practices at the 
crossings will need to allow for these types of workers and 
investors to travel and do their jobs.  In this regard, post 
notes that the new instructions on the "PA-only" stamp 
promised (ref a) have apparently not yet been implemented 
consistently.
