Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds leads with a report on Israeli plans to demolish 55 
Palestinian apartments in Ras Khmays neighborhood in East Jerusalem. 
 All papers front page the report.  Israeli Jerusalem municipal 
authorities on March 3, ordered the residents to evacuate their 
homes within 72 hours.  The papers quote Palestinian officials, 
including the advisor to the Palestinian Authority Premier Abdul 
Qader, stating that 50% of the apartments were recently readied for 
occupancy and the rest will be soon.  Palestinian officials 
described the Israeli orders as another incident of ethnic cleansing 
against Palestinian Jerusalemites.  Al Quds' front page reports that 
Palestinians in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Bustan, also 
facing demolition orders, "foiled a provocative tour," of the 
neighborhood by the Israeli Jerusalem Mayor on March 3. 
 
In separate reporting, the three dailies front page Israeli plans to 
construct two tunnels in the Old City of Jerusalem to connect the 
Jewish Quarter to the Western Wall.  The papers note that the 
construction is an Israeli attempt to boost control over the area 
surrounding the Al Aqsa mosque. 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida lead with an AFP report, on 
statements made by Secretary of State Clinton in Jerusalem following 
her meetings with Israeli leaders on March 3.  Al Quds also runs 
front page coverage of the statements.  All papers note with 
interest the Secretary's statements about the inevitability of the 
two-state solution and Washington's commitment to pursue active 
diplomacy in the region.  The papers highlight Clinton's statements 
on America's "unrelenting commitment" to Israel's security and her 
call for a halt to rocket attacks from Gaza.  The report also notes 
the disappointment of Arab Israeli Knesset member Ahmad Tibi over 
Clinton's support for any elected Israeli government.  Finally, the 
report details the Secretary's March 4 meeting schedule with 
Palestinian officials, concluding with comments by Palestinian 
Authority (PA) Presidential spokesman Abu Rudaynah stating that PA 
President Abbas will stress to Clinton that Israel must halt all 
settlement activities as required by the Road Map and Mitchell 
report, and that any Israeli government must commit to the two-state 
solution and previous agreements. 
All front pages report on comments about travel plans to Syria made 
by two U.S. officials who are accompanying Secretary Clinton on her 
Middle East tour.  The report quotes Clinton stating that the U.S. 
has many issues to discuss with Syria and therefore, she is sending 
two envoys to Damascus immediately after her visit to the region. 
Al Ayyam's front page highlights that Secretary Clinton outlined the 
details of U.S. assistance to the Palestinians, explaining that it 
will include $300 million for emergency humanitarian assistance to 
Gazans and $200 million in support to the Palestinian Authority (PA) 
budget and $400 million in support to the PA Reform and Development 
Plan.   In related news, Al Quds' front page reports that the Arab 
League announced on March 3 that Arab states will allocate $500 
million in additional support to the PA budget.  The report further 
reveals that a statement is being prepared for the upcoming Arab 
summit, to demand international pressure on Israel to lift the 
"siege" on Gaza and abide by previous agreements.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1)  Hani Habib comments in independent Al Ayyam on the Sharm 
El-Sheikh conference under the title, "A political conference! So 
what?"(03/04): "[Financial aid] figures overshadowed the political 
ideas presented at the conference:  The French President called for 
an international peace conference in the Spring... whereas, the 
Italian President repeated his call for a "marshal plan" conference 
 
JERUSALEM 00000377  002 OF 002 
 
 
to rescue the Palestinian economy, and demanded... a [Palestinian] 
airport to serve Muslim and Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land... a 
canal between the Red Sea and the Dead sea... [it's curious] that 
the political dimension of the conference has been overshadowed, 
, 
especially since the aid figures were known and announced before the 
Sharm El Sheikh conference." 
2) Al Quds' editorial is titled, "Judaizing Jerusalem is a 
systematic, ongoing process" (03/04):  "[continued settlement 
activities in Jerusalem] require a strong international, Arab and 
Palestinian response and effective pressure on Israel, because the 
timid... reactions have only encouraged Israel to continue its 
policies.  It is time to [go]... beyond the former condemnations and 
statements that have proven to be a failure and incapable of 
stopping settlement encroachment on the Holy City."
