Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The crisis in Lebanon leads coverage in all Palestinian dailies. 
Fears of civil war and a Sunni-Shiite conflict are major themes in 
the lead stories of Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's main 
headline highlights the death of eight people in armed clashes 
between pro-government and pro-opposition protesters.  U.S. reaction 
to the violence in Beirut receives front-page coverage, with 
Al-Ayyam quoting White House Spokesman Gordon Johndroe stating that 
Hezbollah must stop its, "disruptive activities."  Al-Quds cites a 
statement by the American Embassy in Beirut advising American 
citizens in Lebanon to limit movement and exercise extreme caution. 
Palestinian President Abbas' comments on the crisis is also 
highlighted on Al-Ayyam's front-page, quoting him as expressing, 
"extreme concern" over the violence and urging all sides to 
dialogue. 
 
The dailies run highlighted coverage of Palestinian commemorations 
of the 60th anniversary of the Nakba (the Catastrophe).  The reports 
accompany pictures of Palestinians events such as sit-ins, 
demonstrations and protest marches that were held in several cities 
in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as inside of Israel.  The 
coverage includes reports on Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad's 
participation in commemoration activities in Ramallah.  Israel's 
60th birthday celebrations receive minimal coverage in the dailies 
which instead highlight stories about the investigations into 
corruption charges linked to Israeli Prime Minister Olmert. 
 
Al-Ayyam front-pages a report quoting White House National Security 
Advisor Steven Hadley's recent press briefing on travel by President 
Bush to the region.  According to Hadley, President Bush will stress 
his commitment to the achievement of a peace agreement between the 
Israelis and Palestinians. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that Egypt has agreed to open the Rafah 
crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, for three days beginning 
May 10.  The report also notes that Egypt is coordinating with the 
Hamas "government" on the action. 
 
According to Al-Quds' front page, "Israeli police confirmed that 
they have moved a police station to the E1 area." The story, citing 
the Israeli weekly, Kol Haeer, notes that American officials have in 
the past shown opposition to any building in the E1 block because it 
would, "threaten the possibility for Palestinian expansion in the 
West Bank."  Critics of E1 construction claim that the aim of 
development is to connect the Israeli settlement Ma'ale Adumim to 
Jerusalem, thereby effectively cutting off the northern West Bank 
from its southern half.

Thursday, May 8 
------------------ 
 
Al-Quds' lead headline states that, "Cairo rejects the Bush 
suggestion to hold a summit to discuss the peace process if Olmert 
will not be present."  The report quotes an Egyptian Foreign 
Ministry source confirming that the U.S. has dropped its suggestion 
to hold the four-way meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh. 
 
Positive coverage of the visit by Quartet Envoy Tony Blair, to Jenin 
on May 7 appears in the dailies.  Al-Quds highlights Blair's comment 
that, "achieving peace demands serious steps that will improve 
 
JERUSALEM 00000768  002 OF 002 
 
 
security and the economic situation." 
 
Coverage of American presidential election campaigns appears on the 
front pages.  Al-Ayyam carries a photo of presidential hopeful Obama 
under the title, "democrats are close to nominating Obama."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs its daily editorial entitled "Total 
support for the security forces"(5/08):  "We all know that 
Palestinian security forces have started a gradual deployment to 
several West Bank cities that faces great difficulty.  We also know 
that Israeli forces act...  as though these Palestinians security 
forces do not exist... [these difficulties] do not negate the 
importance of the role of Palestinian security forces.  On the 
contrary, the state of occupation increases chaos and lawlessness... 
it also creates an atmosphere that breeds corruption... the role of 
Palestinian Authority security forces is more essential now than 
ever before.  The...[security forces] in Jenin were received with 
roses, hope and great expectations by the citizens.  They called it 
the operation of, "smiles and hope,"... we should all support the 
Palestinian security forces... This will have a positive effect on 
our cause. We should also stand firm in the face of those who are 
seeking to make these efforts fail, regardless of their affiliation 
or justifications." 
 
¶2. Independent Al-Quds runs its daily editorial entitled "The peace 
process in impossible circumstances"(5/09):  "it is established that 
Palestinians want peace.  They have chosen a peace settlement 
through negotiations as their strategic choice since Madrid... The 
problem lies not in the Palestinian position towards the peace 
process, but rather in Israel's unilateral actions.  It occupies 
Palestinian territories, confiscates land for building settlements 
and the separation wall which have swallowed up thousands of acres 
of Palestinian land in the West Bank... the latest investigations 
into [corruption charges against Israeli Premier] Olmert will affect 
American efforts towards moving the peace process forward... the 
question is how American efforts by Secretary Rice and President 
Bush, himself, can move the peace process forward with an almost 
paralyzed Israeli government.  This is like asking an exhausted 
horse to enter a race... "
