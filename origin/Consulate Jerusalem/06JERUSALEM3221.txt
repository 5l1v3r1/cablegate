¶1.    (SBU) At least 28 Palestinians have died since July 26, 
including civilians, during an IDF incursion into the Shijaya 
and surrounding neighborhoods in Gaza City.  According to 
medical sources, at least 80 Palestinians have sustained 
injuries during the operation, which is ongoing as of 1400 L 
on July 27.  Many of the injuries are reportedly shrapnel 
wounds from IDF tank fire.  Elsewhere in Gaza, the IAF fired 
several rockets into a building in northern Gaza, leveling 
the entire three-story structure. 
 
¶2.    (SBU) At least seven Qassam rockets were launched from 
northern Gaza toward Sderot and the Western Negev overnight 
July 26-27.  There were no reported injuries or damage.  An 
additional two rockets were fired the morning of July 27 in 
the direction of Sderot.  No injuries or damage reported. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) In the West Bank, the IDF overnight July 26-27 
arrested seven Palestinians, including Hamas legislative 
council member Ahmad Mubarak (Ramallah).  In Kufr Qadoum 
village east of Qalqilya, the IDF surrounded and demolished a 
house in search of wanted al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades activist 
Hamada Shaker.  The IDF shot and wounded Shaker as he 
attempted to escape.  Shaker later died from his injuries. 
Palestinians in Tulkarm and Nablus (approx. 5,000) 
demonstrated July 27 to express solidarity with Hezbollah and 
the Lebanese people.
