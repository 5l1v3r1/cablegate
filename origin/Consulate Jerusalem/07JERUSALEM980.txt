¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  HAMAS GUNMEN RAIDED A FATAH "SPECIAL 
FORCE" TRAINING AREA IN CENTRAL GAZA MAY 24, BUT NO INJURIES 
RESULTED.  SENIOR FATAH CONTACTS SAY A HIGH-LEVEL FATAH 
DELEGATION WILL GO TO CAIRO MAY 26 TO MEET WITH EGYPTIAN 
OFFICIALS AND SENIOR HAMAS FIGURES TO SOLIDIFY THE FACTIONAL 
CEASEFIRE, DISCUSS POLITICAL DISPUTES AND CONSIDER A 
COMPREHENSIVE CEASEFIRE WITH ISRAEL.  14 QASSAM ROCKETS AND 
AT LEAST 2 MORTARS STRUCK ISRAEL, WITH SOME MORTAR DAMAGE AT 
EREZ CROSSING BUT NO REPORTED INJURIES OR DAMAGE FROM THE 
QASSAMS.  PALESTINIAN MEDIA AND SECURITY CONTACTS REPORT ONE 
PALESTINIAN WAS KILLED AND 12 INJURED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES 
AND SHELLING ON A BLACKSMITH SHOP, MONEY EXCHANGE SHOP AND 
MULTIPLE "EXECUTIVE FORCE" POSITIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SPORADIC FACTIONAL FIGHTING; 
HIGHT-LEVEL FATAH-HAMAS MEETING 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) HAMAS GUNMEN RAIDED A FATAH "SPECIAL FORCE" 
TRAINING AREA NEAR AL-BURAYJ REFUGEE CAMP MAY 24, CHASING OFF 
THE TRAINERS, STEALING A RIFLE AND HOISTING HAMAS BANNERS, 
BUT THERE WERE NO INJURIES.  FIGHTING BETWEEN GAZA CLANS 
RESULTED IN ONE PALESTINIAN KILLED AND TWO OTHERS INJURED, 
BUT BOTH PALESTINIAN SECURITY CONTACTS AND HAMAS PRESS 
STATEMENTS SAY THE INCIDENT WAS UNRELATED TO FATAH-HAMAS 
TENSION. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SENIOR FATAH CONTACTS SAY A HIGH-LEVEL FATAH 
DELEGATION WILL ARRIVE IN CAIRO ON MAY 26 TO MEET WITH 
EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS AND SENIOR HAMAS FIGURES TO SOLIDIFY THE 
FACTIONAL CEASEFIRE, ADDRESS OUTSTANDING POLITICAL DISPUTES, 
NEGOTIATE A COMPREHENSIVE CEASEFIRE WITH ISRAEL, AND DEVISE A 
FATAH-HAMAS PROGRAM OF POLITICAL PARTNERSHIP.  THE SAME 
CONTACTS REPORT HIGH-LEVEL FATAH-HAMAS MEETINGS IN GAZA SINCE 
MAY 22 TO DISCUSS A CEASEFIRE WITH ISRAEL (COVERING BOTH GAZA 
AND THE WEST BANK), BUT THE TALKS HAVE BEEN HELD IRREGULARLY 
BECAUSE HAMAS FEARS OF ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES ON THEIR LEADERS. 
 
QASSAMS AND ISRAELI STRIKES INTENSIFY 
-------------------------------------
