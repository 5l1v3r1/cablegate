Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The killing of three Israelis and injury of 44 others in the heart 
of Western Jerusalem on July 2 captures front page headlines in the 
three dailies.  A Palestinian resident in East Jerusalem destroyed a 
commuter bus and cars with a large bulldozer before being shot dead. 
 The three dailies lead with photos of the site of the attack. 
Papers report that the attack was carried out by a lone individual 
and that Israeli authorities did not have any prior warning of the 
attack.  In related coverage, the dailies report that Israel has 
taken action against the attacker's family and that the Knesset has 
approved of the withdrawal of Jerusalem ID/residence cards from any 
Palestinian Jerusalemite who participates in attacks against Israel 
and their family members. 
 
Another lead story in the three dailies is the visit of Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas to Damascus on July 6.  The Palestinian 
leader and Syrian President Assad will discuss ways to regain 
national Palestinian unity, "lost" after the take-over of the Gaza 
Strip by Hamas. 
 
President Bush reaffirmed to Palestinian Authority President Abbas 
over the telephone on July 2 of his willingness to intervene in 
negotiations with Israel if Palestinians request such action, 
according to the three dailies.  Official spokesperson of the 
Palestinian Presidency Abu Rudaynah added that Secretary Rice will 
continue to work with both sides and will receive them in Washington 
in mid-July, the papers report. 
 
Coverage highlights the announcement by Hizbollah's leader Hassan 
Nasrallah of Hizbollah's official acceptance of the terms of the 
prisoner exchange deal announced earlier by the Israeli media and 
Knesset.  The exchange will take place in one or two weeks. 
 
All front pages report that Egypt closed the Rafah crossing point 
with Gaza on July 2, after clashes took place between Palestinians 
and Egyptian Police.  Hundreds of Palestinians also rushed the 
crossing in an effort to reach the Egyptian side and in protest of 
slow Egyptian crossing procedures. Hamas spokesman Ihab Al-Ghusayn, 
announced that Egypt allowed the passage of only 25 of 1,500 ill 
Palestinians into Egypt on July 2.  Hamas commented that what 
happened at the crossing point was spontaneous and due to the stress 
placed on the Palestinian people. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page reports that Israel reopened the Gaza Strip 
crossing points on July 2 and allowed a small quantity of cement 
into the Strip.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1.  Independent Al- Quds runs its daily editorial entitled, "Rafa 
crossing again" (07/03): "hundreds of Palestinians tried to cross 
the Egyptian borders through the Rafah crossing...the problem with 
this sole passageway between Gaza and the world, is that it is 
controlled by an agreement between Egypt and the European Union, 
with Israeli consent. Any [approval] to pass through this crossing 
is not... Egypt's [decision] alone.  The solution ... is to resolve 
the dangerous situation in the Gaza Strip, since [it fell under] 
Hamas control... The fragile [Israel/ Hamas] truce agreement may be 
a beginning to the... reopening of the crossing and to putting 
 
JERUSALEM 00001166  002 OF 002 
 
 
things back in order... but before that can happen, people should 
stop embarrassing, teasing and attempting to hurt Egypt." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam prints its daily editorial by Talal Okal 
entitled, "In order to escape the whirlpool of weakness" (07/03): 
"...As part of taking practical steps towards creating a positive 
atmosphere... [Fatah and Hamas] should have, even if only through 
factional channels, sought to find ... mechanisms to [begin 
implementing]... the first step of the Yemen initiative... this 
[step] would form a unified government that could ... reestablish 
security systems, a structure of authority and preparation for early 
elections."
