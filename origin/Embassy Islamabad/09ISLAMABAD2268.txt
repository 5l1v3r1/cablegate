REF: PDAS ANDERSON-AMB PATTERSON SEPTEMBER 16 EMAIL 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On September 17, Deputy PolCouns delivered to MFA UN 
Affairs Director Ahmed Farooq ref demarche requesting 
Pakistan defer introducing at the UN Human Rights Council 
(HRC) a resolution proposing action in response to the 
Goldstone report on the Gaza conflict.  During a follow-up 
conversation with Deputy PolCouns, Farooq reported that he 
had contacted Pakistan's mission in Geneva.  He explained 
that Pakistan coordinates its actions at the HRC with OIC 
member states.  He had been informed by Geneva that no such 
coordination had yet taken place regarding the Goldstone 
report.  As a result, Pakistan had no immediate plans to 
introduce a resolution on the issue.
