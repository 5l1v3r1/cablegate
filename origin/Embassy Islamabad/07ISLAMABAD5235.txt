REF: SECSTATE 159386 
 
On December 11, Poloff met with Mohammad Fawad Sher, the 
Deputy Director for UN and International Organizations at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), to receive a readout of 
the Pakistan vote on the UN General Assembly resolutions with 
anti-Israel bias.  Sher acknowledged our concerns (reftel 
points), but confirmed that Pakistan, as it has done in 
previous years, chose to vote in favor of the resolutions. 
As the delegation had observed and passed to Sher, the voting 
patterns on these resolutions had not changed appreciably.
