¶1.  (C)  Summary.  Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Co-Chairman  Asif Zardari released his late wife Benazir Bhutto's will to  the press to prove she had chosen him to run the party.  This  sparked a firestorm of speculation about his desire to be the  PPP's candidate for Prime Minister.  NSA Aziz told Ambassador  February 4 that President Musharraf had rebuffed Zardari's  overtures on this initiative.  Zardari's supporters are now  backtracking, insisting that Amin Faheem will be the PPP's  eventual choice as PM.  If Zardari does agree to maintain a  behind-the-scenes role, there are several contenders to be a  PPP Prime Minster, but none is the strong leader Pakistan  needs.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On February 5, the PPP released to the press a  copy of Benazir Bhutto's handwritten will, in which she  specifically hands her husband Asif Zardari control of the  party (Ref B).  The release was timed to coincide with the  ""chelum"" marking the end of 40 days of mourning for Benazir. 
Local press picked up a Newsweek article in which Zardari  declined to rule out an attempt to become Prime Minister.  He  is quoted as saying that he has more name/face recognition  than anyone else in the party.  The story has provoked a  firestorm of questions and criticism within the PPP and in  the press.  Local editorials January 7 were primarily  derisive, reminding readers that Zardari has a ""hangover of  controversy"" from the past and reluctantly acknowledging the  feudal and non-democratic nature of party structures in  Pakistan. 
 
¶3.  (C)  At a meeting February 6, NSA Tariq Aziz told  Ambassador it is a ""given"" that the PPP will form the next  government.  He said that PPP interlocutor Rehman Malik  reached out to him in Dubai to explore the possibility of  Zardari becoming Prime Minister.  Aziz noted that the  constitution did not allow someone to become Prime Minister  without first being a Member of the National Assembly.  He  thought Zardari's plan would be to put someone else in the  Prime Minister's office temporarily until Zardari could win a  by-election. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Musharraf responded with a firm rejection of this  idea.  Aziz said it would reflect badly on Musharraf to have  cut a deal to bring Benazir Bhutto back and then end up with  Zardari as Prime Minister.  They could support Zardari as  being the behind-the-scenes party leader; in fact, Aziz said  they preferred this scenario as it was easier to cut deals  with Zardari than it would have been with Benazir.  Aziz  called this the ""Sonia Ghandi model.""  Aziz was non-committal  on the status of the National Reconciliation Order, which  reportedly expired this week.  (Note: the Supreme Court  February 6 postponed until after the election consideration  of a legal challenge to the NRO.) 
 
¶5.  (C)  Aziz confirmed rumors that serious divisions are  developing within the PPP.  He reported that Zardari had  summed Amin Faheem back from Islamabad after learning he had  met with us (Ref A).  Zardari told Aziz that Faheem was his  candidate for Prime Minister.  However, Aziz also commented  that Zardari has been giving mixed signals to the other PPP  contenders (Vice Chairman Yousaf Gillani, PPP Punjab  President Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and former Defense Minister  Aftab Shahban Mirani) and keeping his own options open.  Aziz  said that ISI Director Nadeem Taj would meet soon with  Zardari to try to dissuade him from pursuing the position of  Prime Minister. 
 
¶6.  (C)  Zardari's supporters have been quick to call us to  insist the Newsweek story inaccurately portrayed the  situation.  PPP international press coordinator Farah  Ispahani told Polcouns February 6 that Zardari will support  Faheem as Prime Minister, but not until after the election. 
Separately, Qureshi has been promoting himself as the best  candidate, and CG Lahore reports (Septel) that infighting  between Qureshi and Gillani in the southern Punjab has  weakened the party's prospects there.  All of post's PPP  contacts are lining up behind various contenders and seeking  our support for their choices.

------------------ 
 
¶7.  (C)  If Zardari were to pursue becoming Prime Minister,  he has some hurdles to overcome.  According to Pakistan's  constitution, you must be a sitting Member of the National  Assembly (MNA) to be named Prime Minister.  Qualifications  for MNA include being at least 25 years of age, being  ""sagacious, righteous, non-profligate and honest,"" and not  having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. 
A controversial requirement that MNAs also have a university  degree was added after Zardari served as a Senator. According  to Zardari's bio, he does not have this degree. His prior  convictions were overturned on appeal, but there appear to be  charges pending (which the NRO would excise if it remains in  force); the definition of moral turpitude in Pakistan remains  cloudy. 
 
¶8.  (C)  Zardari advised us (Ref B) that he was planning to  ask his sister to resign from her Nawabshah National Assembly  seat so that he could run in a by-election.  This election  could not occur until 60 days after the February 18 election,  and then only after a compliant Election Commission declared  him eligible as a candidate.  Presumably, Zardari would need  his own caretaker to become Prime Ministers until he was  elected as an MNA. 
 
¶9.  (C)  Comment:  If he refuses to extend the NRO, Musharraf  has leverage which could dissuade Zardari from seeking the  job as Prime Minister.  If Zardari agrees to remain behind  the scenes, the question then is who becomes his front man. 
According to the latest polls, Amin Faheem is head and  shoulders above all other PM candidates in terms of  popularity and has a separate power base within the PPP.  Although a weak personality, Faheem could challenge Zardari's  credibility within the party.  Gillani has a history of  corruption charges and is a Punjabi in a Sindh-based party;  Qureshi we believe will be too independent for Zardari's  taste; Mirani at age 70 is a Sindhi perceived as being clean,  close to Zardari, and pliant. 
 
¶10.  (C)  Frankly, none of these PM contenders strike us as  being the strong leader that Pakistan needs.  If PPP is in  fact is tapped by Musharraf to form the next government, any  of these contenders will require support in the shape of  strong cabinet members from his coalition partner.  Which  parties will form that coalition remains to be seen.
