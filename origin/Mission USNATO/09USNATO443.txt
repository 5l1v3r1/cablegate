Press Release: (2009) 147 
 
NATO Secretary General condemns Kabul bombing 
 
I strongly condemn the terrorist bombing today in Kabul, 
which has killed and injured scores of innocent people.  This 
is another example of the Taliban's total disregard for the 
lives of the Afghan people. 
 
I extend my condolences to the families of those who lost 
their lives in this act of terrorism.  I also wish a speedy 
recovery to the many injured, among them two members of the 
EU police mission in Afghanistan.
