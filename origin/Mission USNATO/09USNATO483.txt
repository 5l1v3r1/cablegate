Press Release: (2009) 154 
 
Statement by the Secretary General on Kabul attacks 
 
On behalf of NATO, I strongly condemn the attacks that took 
place in Kabul today, in which a number of international and 
Afghan UN staff were killed and injured. 
 
The victims of these terrorist attacks were devoted to 
helping the Afghan people build better lives.  In targeting 
them, the Taliban has demonstrated once again that it is 
truly an enemy of the Afghan people. 
 
I express my condolences to the families of the victims, and 
to the United Nations.
