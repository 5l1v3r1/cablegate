BEGIN TEXT:

Press Release: (2009) 188 
 
Chairman's Statement 
 
Meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission at the level of 
Foreign Ministers held at NATO Headquarters, Brussels, on 3 
December 2009 
 
The NATO-Ukraine Commission (NUC) at the level of Foreign 
Ministers met in Brussels today to discuss the further 
development of the Distinctive Partnership between NATO and 
Ukraine in light of Ukraine's implementation of its Annual 
National Programme for 2009. 
 
NUC Ministers noted the high-level political dialogue that 
took place this year between NATO and Ukraine, and welcomed 
the signing of the Declaration to complement the NATO-Ukraine 
Charter on a Distinctive Partnership in August, which gives 
the NATO Ukraine Commission a central role in supervising the 
process set in hand by the Bucharest Summit, deepening 
regular political dialogue, and underpinning reforms 
pertaining to Ukraine's aspirations for membership in NATO. 
 
Referring to their Assessment of Ukraine's implementation of 
its first Annual National Programme, NATO Ministers 
noted that Ukraine has made progress, but that work remains 
to be done. They encouraged Ukraine to ensure that 
elections in 2010 meet international standards, and to 
improve inter-departmental coordination of the 
implementation of the Annual National Programme. They 
expressed concern that security and defence reforms have 
slowed, but looked forward to the results of the Strategic 
Defence Review as an indicator that Ukraine will align its 
objectives with available resources. NATO Ministers also 
looked forward to the timely adoption and effective 
implementation of Ukraine's Annual National Programme for 
¶2010. 
 
NATO Ministers expressed their high appreciation for 
Ukraine's contribution to all major NATO-led operations and 
missions, including KFOR in Kosovo, Operation Active 
Endeavour in the Mediterranean, ISAF in Afghanistan, and 
the NATO Training Mission in Iraq. NATO Ministers took 
special note of Ukraine's decision to increase its 
contribution to ISAF. They also welcomed Ukraine's decision 
to contribute to the NATO Response Force - the first such 
contribution from a Partner Nation. They welcomed Ukraine's 
agreement to allow the transit of goods in support of ISAF 
through its territory, expecting that Ukraine will soon be in 
a position to implement this agreement. 
 
Foreign Minister Poroshenko expressed his nation's 
appreciation for the humanitarian aid rendered by NATO Allies 
to curb the outbreak of pandemic flu. He expressed Ukraine's 
intent to contribute to development of NATO's Strategic 
Concept, and his readiness to participate in a meeting of the 
NATO-Ukraine Commission in Tallinn in April 2010. 
 
Moreover, NUC Ministers agreed on the importance of Ukraine's 
efforts to provide objective information about the Alliance 
to its citizens, on the achievements made in public diplomacy 
to date, and the need to find a solution to the co-location 
of NATO's offices in Kyiv.

¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: Because a Chairman's statement is issued 
 
USNATO 00000565  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
under the Secretary General's own authority in his role as 
Chair of the NUC, it is not a binding policy document in the 
same way that a Joint Statement negotiated and agreed by 
Allies and Ukraine would be.  END COMMENT
