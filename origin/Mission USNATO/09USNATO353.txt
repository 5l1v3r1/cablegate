SUBJECT: COUNTER-PIRACY: NATO BEGINS OPERATION OCEAN 
SHIELD: INCLUDES CAPACITY BUILDING 
 
REF: USNATO 350 
 
¶1. (U) On August 17, NATO formally commenced Operation Ocean 
Shield -- the Alliance's long-term contribution to 
international efforts to combat piracy off the Horn of 
Africa.  In a statement posted to its website, the Allied 
Maritime Component Command Headquarters Northwood (MCC 
Northwood) said that "while at-sea counter-piracy operations 
will continue to be the focus, a new element of 
regional-state counter-piracy capacity building has been 
developed for Operation Ocean Shield."  The statement went on 
to note that "NATO's capacity building effort will aim to 
assist regional states, upon their request, in developing 
their own ability to combat piracy activities." 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: In addition to the counter-piracy mission, 
the Alliance has also recently agreed to strengthen its 
relations with the African Union (AU), including increasing 
NATO's support for efforts to build the AU's security 
structures.  As NATO engages Africa more through these 
initiatives, we hope that USG players in the continent--such 
as AFRICOM--will consider inviting NATO to observe or 
participate in upcoming U.S.-led capacity building events, 
such as exercises and planning conferences.  NATO 
participation in such events would give us a better insight 
into how we can best leverage the Alliance's 
capabilities/resources in pursuit of USG policy priorities in 
Africa.  END COMMENT

17 August 09 
 
NATO begins Operation Ocean Shield 
 
Operation Ocean Shield, NATO's contribution to international 
efforts to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa, commenced to 
today after the North Atlantic Council (NAC) approved the 
mission.  Operation Ocean Shield builds on the experience 
gained during Operation Allied Protector, NATO's previous 
counter-piracy mission, and develops a distinctive NATO role 
based on the broad strength of the Alliance by adopting a 
more comprehensive approach to counter-piracy efforts. 
 
While at-sea counter-piracy operations will continue to be 
the focus, a new element of regional-state counter-piracy 
capacity building has been developed for Operation Ocean 
Shield.  NATO's capacity building effort will aim to assist 
regional states, upon their request, in developing their own 
ability to combat piracy activities.  This element of the 
operation is designed to complement existing international 
efforts and will contribute to a lasting maritime security
