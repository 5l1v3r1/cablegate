Statement by the Secretary General on President Obama's 
Announcement 
 
On behalf of NATO, I warmly welcome President Obama's 
announcement on the new US approach and commitment to the 
mission in Afghanistan.  President Obama's decision to 
substantially increase the numbers of US forces in the 
NATO-led operation is proof of his resolve; the overall 
approach he laid out is a broader political strategy for 
success.  The United States' contribution to the NATO-led 
mission has always been substantial; it is now even more 
important. 
 
But this is not a US mission alone: America's Allies in NATO 
have shared the risks, costs, and burdens of this mission 
from the beginning.  As the US increases its commitment, I am 
confident that the other Allies, as well as our Partners in 
the mission, will also make a substantial increase in their 
contribution.  Taken together, the new force contributions 
from across the Alliance, as well as the new approach agreed 
by all the ISAF countries, will help create a new momentum in 
the mission in 2010.
