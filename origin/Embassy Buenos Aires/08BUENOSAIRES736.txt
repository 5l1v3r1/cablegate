INDIGENOUS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN ARGENTINA.  THERE ARE NO 
VIOLENT DOMESTIC GROUPS CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE 
SPECIFICALLY TARGETING U.S. INTERESTS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE 
OF MEMBERS OF AND SUPPORT FOR EXTREMIST INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST 
GROUPS SUCH AS HIZBOLLAH IN THE TRI-BORDER REGION OF ARGENTINA 
(MISIONES PROVINCE), VISITORS HERE CANNOT DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY, TO INCLUDE RANDOM ACTS OF ANTI-AMERICAN 
VIOLENCE. 
 
¶8. EXCHANGE FACILITIES: 
 
THE ARGENTINE PESO, WHICH IS CURRENTLY EXCHANGED AT A FLOATING RATE,
