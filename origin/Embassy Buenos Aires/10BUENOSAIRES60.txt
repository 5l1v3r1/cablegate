SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.  Press coverage of U.S. relief efforts in Haiti was mostly 
positive over the last three days, highlighting the humanitarian 
nature of the U.S. role.  Local media welcomed the U.S.-U.N. 
agreement putting the U.N. in charge of security operations, 
following concerns over the use of U.S. troops.  State-owned Telam 
wire service agency also reported positively on Assistant Secretary 
Arturo Valenzuela's remarks that Brazil and the UN are responsible 
for Haiti's security and that Washington will only play a 
humanitarian role.  While one op-ed stated that the U.S. is the 
only country in a position to take charge of relief efforts, others 
reported that Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez blamed the U.S. for 
occupying Haiti, and opined that peace-keeping missions in the 
country have been fruitless for the last 17 years.  Clarin noted 
that the U.S. "sealed its doors to illegal immigrants" from Haiti. 
Facebook reaction generally praised U.S. relief efforts. End 
summary. 
 
 
 
PRESS WELCOMES U.S. HUMANITARIAN ROLE 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  Leading circulation Clarin's reporter on the ground, who has 
been critical of the U.S. military deployment, on January 23 
headlined "Haiti's ordinary life and future in the hands of the 
U.S.," stating the U.S. had "no other alternative" but sending 
troops as part of relief operations.  The article noted an 
improving situation in Haiti, highlighting an increased presence of 
local police. 
 
 
 
¶2.  Clarin also welcomed the U.S.-UN agreement whereby the UN and 
Brazil will take charge of security in Haiti, with the U.S. 
focusing on humanitarian efforts.  The agreement came as a result 
of "tensions between American soldiers and officials of the 
international organization over relief operations."  State-owned 
Telam wire service agency (01/22) also reported positively on 
Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo 
Valenzuela's remarks that the U.S. would "only provide humanitarian 
aid," while Brazil and the UN would be responsible for security 
operations in Haiti.

HAITI, A TEST FOR HUMANITARIANISM 
 
AND U.S. LEADERSHIP 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4.  Clarin ran three op-eds urging Washington to improve 
cooperation with other countries and to see the Haiti crisis as an 
opportunity to reestablish a positive regional leadership role. 
January 25 Clarin carried two op-eds with differing views on the 
U.S. leading role.  While one dismissed the idea of U.S. occupation 
and criticism from Venezuela and Nicaragua and stressed that the 
U.S. is the only country in a position to take charge of the 
Haitian crisis, the other warned about an eventual U.S. 
protectorate, noting that Haiti epitomizes the test of humanitarian 
efforts. 
 
 
 
¶5. A January 24 Clarin op-ed by Fabian Bosoer, political analyst, 
termed the Haiti tragedy as President Obama's "9/11."  He also 
underscored that "the preservation of the U.S. international 
leading role will largely depend on how the rescue of Haiti is 
carried out."

¶6.  Rosendo Fraga, political analyst and head of Centro de Estudios 
Nueva Mayoria think tank, opined in  centrist Perfil that the 
success of U.S. relief efforts in Haiti have allowed the U.S. to 
"justify the reactivation of the Fourth Fleet, while rejecting 
accusations from Venezuela and its allies that it was planning to 
occupy the county."  Fraga also highlights Secretary Clinton's 
visit to Haiti to help coordinate relief efforts with the UN. 
 
 
 
PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS SHOULD BE 
 
REPLACED BY STATE-BUILDING MISSIONS 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶7.  January 25 pro-government, left-of-center Pagina 12 echoed 
critical remarks from Cuban former leader Fidel Castro that the 
U.S. is "occupying Haiti." According to the article, Castro also 
criticized the U.S. and UN for "failing to explain the movement of 
(armed) forces."  A January 23 Pagina 12 opinion piece criticized 
peacekeeping missions, arguing that they have been fruitless during 
the last 17 years. It says that for real reconstruction of the 
country, assistance should be "state-building" oriented instead of 
humanitarian.  Furthermore, peacekeeping missions should be 
replaced by civilian missions with a considerable reduction of the 
current 8,000 troops while sending engineers, architects, 
physicians, lawyers and public management professionals.

------------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶8.  January 24 Clarin noted that the U.S. has "sealed its doors to 
illegal immigrants" coming from Haiti, who would be sent to tents 
set up next to the Guantanamo prison in Cuba.
