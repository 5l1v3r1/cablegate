SUBJECT: ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT EXPRESSES SOLIDARITY WITH THE 
U.S. IN WAKE OF YEMEN ATTACK 
 
REF: BUENOS AIRES 1272 
 
¶1. (U) Argentine MFA U/S for Bilateral Affairs Ambassador 
Vicente Espeche Gil contacted the CDA September 19 to convey 
condolences for the September 17 terrorist attack on the U.S. 
Embassy in Sanaa.  The previous evening, at a reception 
hosted by the CDA, several GOA officials expressed similar 
sentiments. 
 
¶2. (U) The MFA followed up September 19 with the following 
press statement: 
 
"The Government of the Argentine Republic manifests its 
consternation and repudiation ofthe brutal terrorist attack 
committed in the Republic of Yemen, on the morning of 
September 17, against the Embassy of the United States of 
America in Sanaa and profoundly laments the sorrowful toll of 
victims." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The Argentine MFA does not often comment on 
events as far afield as those in Yemen unless Argentine 
interests are directly affected, which makes this statement 
exceptional.  In sharp contrast to the harsh tone of the 
MFA'S September 11 statement with its incendiary accusations 
against the USG, the solidarity voiced in the September 19 
statement may be a peace offering of sorts.  In a possibly 
related development, President Fernandez de Kirchner travels 
to New York this evening, September 19.  End comment.
