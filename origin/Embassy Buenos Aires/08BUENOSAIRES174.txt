¶A.  POLITICAL VIOLENCE/TERRORISM: LIAISON WITH HOST GOVERNMENT 
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES INDICATE THERE IS LITTLE THREAT TO U.S. 
CITIZENS (OFFICIAL VISITORS, BUSINESS VISITORS, TOURISTS) FROM 
INDIGENOUS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN ARGENTINA.  THERE ARE NO 
VIOLENT DOMESTIC GROUPS CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE 
SPECIFICALLY TARGETING U.S. INTERESTS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE 
OF MEMBERS OF AND SUPPORT FOR EXTREMIST INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST 
GROUPS SUCH AS HIZBOLLAH IN THE TRI-BORDER REGION OF ARGENTINA 
(MISIONES PROVINCE), VISITORS HERE CANNOT DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY, TO INCLUDE RANDOM ACTS OF ANTI-AMERICAN 
VIOLENCE. 
 
¶B.  CRIME: PETTY STREET CRIME IN THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES AND THE 
IMMEDIATE SUBURBS CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM FOR RESIDENTS AND 
VISITORS ALIKE. BURGLARIES IN THE MORE FASHIONABLE SUBURBS HAVE BEEN

AWARE OF PROBLEMS WITH HOTEL SECURITY (I.E. THEFTS FROM ROOM) AND 
PICKPOCKETS OR PURSE SNATCHING ON THE STREETS AND PUBLIC 
TRANSPORTATION (BUSES AND TRAINS). PICKPOCKETS OFTEN WORK IN PAIRS 
AND EMPLOY A VARIETY OF RUSES TO VICTIMIZE THE UNSUSPECTING VISITOR. 
 IN RECENT YEARS, MOST CRIME AFFECTING VISITORS HAS BEEN 
NON-VIOLENT; AGGRAVATED ROBBERIES, SHOOTINGS, ETC., WHILE NOT 
COMPLETELY UNHEARD OF IN BUENOS AIRES WERE NONETHELESS UNCOMMON. 
RECENTLY, HOWEVER, INCIDENTS OF ARMED INVASIONS OF RESTAURANTS, 
SHOPS AND RESIDENCES BY CRIMINAL GROUPS ARE BEING OBSERVED WITH 
GREATER FREQUENCY, AND AS A RESULT, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT DUE 
CAUTION BE EXERCISED WHEN TRAVELING ABOUT THE CITY.  HOWEVER, IN 
GENERAL, THE CRIME LEVEL IN BUENOS AIRES IS LESS SEVERE THAN LARGE 
U.S. CITIES.
