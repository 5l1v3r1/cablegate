SUBJECT: US PARTNER CHOSEN TO LEAD INFLUENTIAL CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE 
 
¶1.  (U) On January 6, the Sana'a Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry elected Hassan Al-Kbous as the Chairman of the 
Chamber following the death of previous Chairman Sheikh 
Mahfoudh Shammakh.  Sheikh Mahfoudh Shammakh, sometimes 
called the Wiseman of the Yemeni Traders, died of a heart 
attack on January 1 at the age of 74.  As the Chairman of the 
Sana'a Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the CEO of 
Shammakh Trading Group, Sheikh Shammakh was a giant of Yemeni 
business.  Shammakh was known for his generosity in founding 
charity associations and for his activism in speaking out 
against corruption.  The funeral of Sheikh Shammakh was 
attended by thousands, including the Foreign Minister, the 
Minister of Oil and Minerals, the Chairman of the Supreme 
National Authority to Combat Corruption, senior Islah 
opposition leaders, and prominent business figures.  ECONOFF 
witnessed first hand the massive throng of well wishers at a 
condolence reception. 
 
¶2.  (U) As the Chairman of the Sana'a Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, Shammakh was an effective partner for improving 
US-Yemeni commercial relations and an advocate for government 
transparency and accountability.  Al-Kbous is already a key 
partner of the Post Commercial/Econ section, a well-known and 
respected Yemeni businessman, and a participant in an August 
2007 Post-sponsored trade delegation to South Carolina. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Sana'a Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been 
extremely supportive of Post's Econ/Commercial priorities. 
The Chamber was essential in organizing the visit of the 
American trade delegation that visited Yemen in December of 
¶2006.  At Post's request, the Sana'a Chamber brokered a deal 
for payment of an outstanding bill of $27,000 owed to the 
US-based National US-Arab Chamber of Commerce by a different 
Yemeni Chamber. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶4.  (U) Post's Econ/Commercial activities have been greatly 
advanced through the cooperation and support of the Sana'a 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  Post expects its excellent 
relationship with the Chamber and the Yemen business 
community as a whole to grow even stronger with the election 
of Chairman Al-Kbous.  END COMMENT
