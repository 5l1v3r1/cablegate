¶G. Shaker works for the Yemen Times weekly. It's independent 
and was the first English language newspaper published in 
Yemen. The Yemen Times is considered an influential news 
organization and the principal English language newspaper 
which covers various issues including economic, political 
and social issues and concentrates on political, economic 
and social developments. It features fairly straight 
reporting of international developments. In terms of size of 
circulation, Yemen Times ranks third amongst all government, 
private and political party newspapers with a bi-weekly copy 
run of 20,000 copies. 
 
The Yemen Times publishes economic, cultural and family 
affairs coverage on a weekly basis. The newspaper also 
features opinion essays and analysis reports. It is read by 
literate urban, young Yemenis and is found on the desks of 
virtually all government officials, intellectuals and 
elites. 
 
¶H. The focus of the reporting tour meets one of the 
requirements of the media interests in Yemen. The Yemen 
Times is one of few national newspapers that addresses 
economic issues and plays a major role in raising/shaping 
public awareness regarding a multitude of issues. More than 
40% of the population in Yemen lives under the poverty line 
and a majority of the population is therefore dependent on 
small businesses. The U.S. Embassy is very supportive 
through its aid program to Yemen's economic growth and the 
participation of a Yemeni journalist on this program will 
help in promoting awareness about the significance of small 
businesses in the lives of many people. 
 
¶I. Shaker Al-Molsi has been a news editor for the Yemen 
Times since June 2004. In this capacity, he handles 
editorial responsibilities, editing news stories, reports 
and articles, conducting interviews with local and foreign 
officials, and contributing weekly articles. He is a member 
of a number of media NGOs, including the Yemeni Journalists 
Syndicate. He is skilled in various computer applications 
and the Internet, and speaks Arabic (mother tongue) and 
English fluently. Shaker holds a BA degree in English 
Language from Sana'a University, 2003. He contributes 
articles and stories to a number of Arabic-language 
newspapers, including the Annas independent weekly. 
 
¶J. He has excellent knowledge of English with very good 
writing and comprehension skills.
