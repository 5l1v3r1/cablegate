SUBJECT: CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PUTS A SMALL SPOTLIGHT ON 
BUSINESSWOMEN IN YEMEN 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: The Federation of Yemen Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry has established a women,s unit on the heels of the 
first-ever national businesswomen,s conference.  The 
women,s unit and the Yemen Business Women,s Council are 
initiating efforts to integrate women into the often 
male-dominated business environment.  The inclusion of 
women-run small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a small step 
towards greater gender equality and integration in this 
limited but otherwise untapped sector of Yemen,s economy. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ESTABLISHES NEW WOMEN,S 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The Federation of Yemen Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
has launched a women,s unit, which will focus on issues 
facing women in business.  Mohammad Al-Maitami, the General 
Director of the Federation, told Econoff on February 23 that 
this is an effort to include both businesswomen and small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs), which typically struggle to have a 
voice in the Yemeni business scene.  Currently, an estimated 
500 businesswomen are registered out of the 70,000-80,000 
members of the Federation.  Specifically, the Federation 
would like to encourage women to register, participate, and 
be represented in the Chamber of Commerce.  (Note: In June 
2008, 38,000 members participated in elections.  End note.) 
The Federation plans to provide space for collaboration, 
research, and workshops as well as an advisory service on 
business and legal issues. 
 
¶3.  The establishment of the women,s unit comes on the heels 
of the first national businesswomen,s conference on January 
26 in Sanaa, organized by the Federation, the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade (MOIT), and the German Agency for 
Technical Cooperation (GTZ).  The conference, which was 
themed, &towards the integration of Yemeni businesswomen in 
development and investment,8 brought together over 150 
participants (including 100 businesswomen) from the public, 
private, and non-profit sectors.  Dr. Najt Jumaaan, 
businesswoman and conference organizer, told Econoff on 
February 23 that the conference aimed to promote 
businesswomen and their contribution to economic development. 
 
 
¶4.  The Federation is comprised of small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs), which make up 98% of industry in Yemen, 
according to al-Maitami.  The Federation serves as an 
umbrella organization for 22 other chambers of commerce and 
close to 100,000 members.  Al-Maitami said that although 
70,000-80,000 businessmen (and women) are registered in 
Yemeni chambers of commerce, an additional 100,000 are not 
represented.  The formation of the women,s unit is part of a 
larger initiative to get more people involved in the 
Federation.  The informal business sector, which is not 
reported to the government, represents 30% of GDP. 
 
YEMEN BUSINESS WOMEN,S COUNCIL, FIRST BUSINESSWOMEN,s NGO 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶5.  The Federation,s women,s unit is a welcome addition to 
the businesswomen,s scene, which includes only one other 
NGO, the Yemen Business Women,s Council.  Dr. Fawzia Nasher, 
Chairman of the Council, told Econoff on February 16 that the 
Council, founded in 2005, was the first organization to deal 
with Yemeni businesswomen,s issues.  Officially inaugurated 
by the Prime Minister,s office in 2006, the Council focuses 
on providing support to women-run SMEs via regular meetings, 
workshops, and assistance with marketing.  Nasher told 
Econoff that all members of the Council also have membership 
in the Chamber of Commerce and many have membership in the 
Arab Women,s Investors Union.  According to Nasher, the 
Council has attempted to raise its profile by attending 
regional conferences. 
 
BUT HOW CAN WE ACCEPT SAEEDA? 
----------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The Council, like the women,s unit at the Federation, is 
faced with the challenge of providing support to 
businesswomen operating in a man,s world.  Nasher said that 
banks do not like to guarantee loans for women and that the 
ROYG prefers to issue tenders to men.  Although the Council's 
activities are limited to intangible, non-financial support, 
it would like to provide loans in the future.  Still, the 
Council is plagued by issues such as a lack of funding and a

shortage of space, and Nasher admitted that members working 
out her office have received no support from the ROYG since 
the initial inauguration.  According to Fawzia, governments 
in countries like Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE do a 
better job of supporting similar businesswomen,s councils. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  Businesswomen and the SMEs in which they work are a small 
but emerging part of Yemen,s economy.  Yemeni businesswomen 
often work from home and outside traditional business venues. 
 While their numbers are small, the inclusion of 
businesswomen in the economy has the potential to make a 
larger impact on gender equality and economic development in 
Yemen over time.  END COMMENT.
