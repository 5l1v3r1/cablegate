SUBJECT: ROYG AGREES TO NOT DEPORT BAHA'IS TO IRAN, BUT 
STILL INSISTS ON DEPORTATION 
 
REF: A. SANAA 1473 
     ¶B. EMAIL EXCHANGE BETWEEN HALA RHARRIT AND 
        ELIZABETH HARRIS DTD SEPTEMBER 4 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 6, the DCM stressed to National 
Security Bureau (NSB) and Presidential Office Director Ali 
al-Anisi the importance of not deporting the detained Baha'is 
to Iran (ref A).  Al-Anisi replied that the ROYG would not 
forcibly deport the detainees to Iran, but insisted that they 
would be deported.  He added that the ROYG now understands 
the persecution that Baha'is face in Iran and will hence 
allow them to be deported to the country of their choice. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Ambassador told Interior Minister Mutahar 
al-Masri in a September 7 meeting that the USG is likely to 
accept the detainees, but cautioned that the US resettlement 
process is lengthy.  A relieved al-Masri offered to "turn 
them over" immediately, prompting the Ambassador to clarify 
that the process does not work that way, adding that the USG 
would appreciate the ROYG releasing the detainees while they 
are processed for resettlement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During a September 8 phone call with UNHCR-Yemen 
senior protection officer Samer Haddadin, Poloff asked if 
UNHCR could provide a resettlement referral to the USG's 
regional refugee coordinator, per ref B guidance.  Haddadin 
replied that UNHCR is expecting to hear from the Prime 
Minister's office on whether it can gain access to the 
detainees.  (Note: UNHCR representative Claire Bourgeois met 
with the Prime Minister on September 3 and asked for access 
to the prisoners.  End Note.)  Haddadin said that when UNHCR 
receives access, they will send a resettlement officer to 
conduct a prison visit and to provide a resettlement 
application.  Once that occurs, Haddadin said UNHCR-Beirut 
will provide the USG's regional refugee coordinator with a 
referral to proceed with the resettlement process. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Although Post has not yet lost hope for 
the detainees' release, it is taking the necessary steps for 
possible US resettlement.  Post will continue to follow-up 
and provide any pertinent updates.  End Comment.
