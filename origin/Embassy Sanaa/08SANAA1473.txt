SUBJECT: DEPORTATION STILL FEARED FOR THE BAHA'IS 
 
REF: SANAA 1441 
 
¶1. (SBU) As of September 3, the four imprisoned Baha'is 
(reftel) remain detained and face possible deportation. 
According to their lawyer, Khaled al-Anisi, the ROYG has now 
unofficially agreed that they may choose the country to which 
they will be deported. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 31, the Charge d'Affaires once again urged 
Foreign Minister Abu-Bakr al-Qirbi to not deport the Baha'is 
and passed along information explaining the threat of 
persecution Baha'is face in Iran.  Qirbi said the Baha'is had 
overstayed their visas and may thus be deported.  (Note: The 
Baha'i community asserts that all four detained Baha'is have 
valid visas. End Note).  Qirbi also asked if the USG would be 
willing to accept the detained Baha'is.  The CDA made no 
promises, but urged that the ROYG avoid making a hasty 
decision while we explored this option. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On September 2, UNHCR-Yemen representative Samer 
Haddadin told Poloff that, despite numerous attempts to visit 
the detainees, UNHCR has been refused access.  Family members 
and other Baha'is, however, reported to Poloff on September 2 
that they have been granted visitation in recent days.  On 
September 2, ICRC-Yemen country director Marcus Dolder 
reported to CDA that ICRC has yet to be contacted by their 
headquarters on the issue.  Dolder added that they have not 
attempted to gain access to the imprisoned Baha'is, but is 
sure that they would be denied if they attempted to do so 
because ICRC has not had access to prisoners in Yemen since 
2004 and assumes that the ROYG would say that Embassies 
representing the detained have jurisdiction over them 
(despite the fear of persecution). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Post has been in contact with PRM to 
determine possible procedures for US resettlement, should 
this become necessary.  Post continues, in the meantime, to 
lobby the government against deportation.  End Comment.
