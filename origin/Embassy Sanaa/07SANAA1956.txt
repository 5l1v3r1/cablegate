REF: A) STATE 149678 B) SANAA 1932 
 
On October 28, EMBOFF met with Assistant Deputy Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Khalid al-Akwa.  EMBOFF engaged al-Akwa on 
the Walker candidacy for election to the UN Independent Audit 
Advisory Agency per ref a.  Al-Akwa said that the issue had 
been forwarded to the appropriate committee in the Ministry 
after post's previous demarche on October 21 (ref b).  He 
was, however, still unable to give a definite response to our 
request that the Ministry instruct its mission to support the 
Walker candidacy.
