TREPIDATION AS COUNTING BEGINS 
 
REF: SANAA 2696 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Polls officially closed across Yemen at 2000L. 
International and local observers contacted by post 
universally agreed that voting was conducted in a generally 
peaceful and orderly manner.  There were no reports of 
widespread violence and unconfirmed reports of isolated 
incidents were focused mainly in the provinces of al-Jawf and 
Dhamar.  Official tabulation has now begun, and both election 
officials and observers expect that the counting will be 
tense and could produce additional violent incidents. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Reliable sources confirm one casualty in Taiz from 
election related-violence previously reported (reftel). 
International and local media report individual deaths in 
Amran and Dhammar, but these have not been confirmed.  A 
senior ruling party official and a spokesman from the Supreme 
Commission on Elections and Referenda (SCER) stated that a 
local election commission chief was killed in Hajja.  Richard 
Chambers, Deputy Chief Observer for the European Union, said 
that EU observers have thus far not had any security issues 
themselves.  Chambers remarked that the SCER has been very 
open in reporting violence and killings. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Both the ruling party and the opposition have 
lodged a number of complaints with the SCER, but independent 
and partisan observers agree that the voting process has thus 
far been a significant improvement over the last national 
elections in 2003. Poloffs, journalists, and European and 
National Democratic Institute (NDI) observers all report high 
turnout and an upbeat mood throughout the country. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) European and NDI observers expressed concern that 
voting centers in the provinces of Mahweet and al-Jawf were 
closed due to violence.  It is unclear how widespread the 
problem is, who is at fault, or if voters in those locations 
will be allowed to vote on another day. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Judging from previous elections, observers and 
SCER officials have told post that they expect the counting 
phase to be tense with the potential to generate violence. 
While the electoral process has so far progressed smoothly, 
this next phase will be the true test of whether or not this 
election can be judged a success.
