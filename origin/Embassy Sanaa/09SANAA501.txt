SUBJECT: MARITIME "LEGAL ARGUMENTS" USELESS SAYS FOREIGN 
MINISTER 
 
REF: STATE 4610 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi expressed concern 
with the tactics of some of the naval vessels currently on 
anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden during a March 23 
meeting with foreign ambassadors.  He asserted that Yemeni 
fishermen are "starving" due to the presence of the Somali 
pirates and the threat from aggressive patrolling naval 
ships.  Qirbi cited the death of a Yemeni fisherman during a 
Russian counter-piracy operation, a version of the incident 
that the Russians have previously challenged (reftel). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Qirbi was furious with the French for towing a 
sinking Somali smuggling boat carrying 97 passengers (and 
reportedly crewed by pirates) to Aden and burdening an 
already "poor country" with additional refugees.  (Note: Only 
three of the 97 passengers were Somalian and will receive 
automatic refugee status under Yemeni law.  End note.)  The 
French Charg argued that as a signatory to the International 
Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the boat 
was within Yemen's "area of responsibility" since it was 
closer to Yemen than anywhere else.  Qirbi angrily shot back, 
"Don't use legal arguments in stressful conditions," and then 
continued to argue that there is a difference between 
responsibility and capability.  Curiously, he handed the 
ambassadors a report on the March 21 incident that explicitly 
states, "In line with its obligation to rescue people at sea, 
the Government of Yemen gave the French watercraft the 
authorization to enter Yemeni waters to escort migrants and 
refugees to the coast." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Abdulkarim al-Iryani, Director of the Foreign 
Minister's Office, complained to Pol/E Chief on March 24 
about what he characterized as the "huge" burden of refugees. 
 He noted that 13,650 had arrived on Yemen's shores since the 
beginning of the year.  "It is a humanitarian act," he said, 
"to tow these people to shore, but now we must take care of 
them.  They need schools, jobs, food, clothing, and shelter. 
This is a lot of burden and we need help." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT.  The uncharacteristic outburst from the 
normally mild-mannered Foreign Minister probably reflects the 
pressure he and the ROYG feel from refugee flows.  In the 
face of a revenue crisis, the ROYG has cut a variety of 
budget items.  Gracefully honoring its international 
commitments appears to be the latest victim of the ROYG's 
budget axe.  END COMMENT.
