On June 3 POL/E Chief delivered reftel talking points and CV 
to Ahmed Saif, Director of the United Nations section of the 
International Organizations office at the MFA.  Saif said

advance of the election, noting that previous demarches of 
this type had arrived too late for him to act on them.  He 
said that the Nominations Committee would decide in September 
whom the ROYG would support, but noted that the US was the 
first country to approach the MFA on the issue.   Comment.

well-disposed towards the USG.  End Comment.
