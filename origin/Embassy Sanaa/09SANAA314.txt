RAISES THE MARRIAGE AGE 
 
¶1.  With strong opposition from Islah, Parliament voted on 
February 14 to approve a marriage law setting the minimum age 
of marriage at 17 for men and women.  The law also stipulates 
that no woman of any age can be married without her consent. 
Parents violating the law face imprisonment for up to a year 
or a fine of approximately $500 USD.  A 1992 law set the 
minimum legal age of marriage at 15, but it was revoked by 
Parliament in 1998 under pressure from religious 
conservatives.  Until now, multiple attempts to reinstate a 
minimum age for marriage failed in Parliament.  Islah 
campaigned against the amendment until the final vote, and 
Islah MP Mohamed al-Hazme distributed a brochure in 
Parliament stating that raising the minimum age of marriage 
was in contradiction to Islamic law and should not be 
tolerated. 
 
¶2.  In 2008, several high-profile "child brides" ) some 
under the age of 10 ) drew attention to the phenomenon of 
early marriage in Yemen, where the average age of marriage 
for girls in rural areas is 12 or 13.  Shada Nasser, a human 
rights lawyer who represented some of the child brides in 
their divorce cases, told PolOff on February 18, "I am happy 
with the law.  It is good, but it's not enough."  She 
explained that the ROYG needed to go further with marriage 
law, including a provision requiring the marriage contract to 
be signed in court rather than at home, which would provide 
the woman with greater legal protection. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3.  Passage of the new marriage law represents an important 
step forward for protecting the rights of Yemen's children. 
In a society where tradition and social custom often take 
precedence over the law, however, the practical impact will 
remain minimal without awareness campaigns and a sustained 
effort to change societal beliefs.  END COMMENT.
