        OF 8/31/05 - EXTENSION OF BLUE LANTERN 
        CASE" 
 
¶1. Per ref A, Post contacted Yemeni Air Force to inquire if 
it has ordered U.S.-origin military aircraft spare parts from 
the firms Aston Aviation, Transworld Aviation, and Segers 
Aviation. Post made repeated inquiries though OMC in routine 
meetings and through diplomatic notes for several weeks. 
Through an October 5 letter from the Commander of the Yemen 
Air Force (YAF), Mahmoud Saleh AlAhmar, the Yemen Air Force 
said: "We would like to inform you that we deal with Aston 
and Transworld companies on contracts for a total of not 
exceeding seven million U.S. dollars."  This estimate from 
the YAF falls short of the three separate $20 million license 
applications cited for the three suppliers in ref A.
