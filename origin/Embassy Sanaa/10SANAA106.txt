COMPLIANCE 
 
REF: A. STATE 1923 
     ¶B. 09 SANAA 1528 
 
¶1. (U) The ROYG is currently receiving U.S. bilateral 
assistance using FY 10 funds, including development, 
counterterrorism, and military assistance.  The non-military 
portion of the annual expenditures of the central government 
is publicly available on the Ministry of Finance's website 
(www.mof.gov.ye/files/budget/2010/fainalbook. pdf) and in 
print through the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
Yemen (CBY).  Government revenues are detailed in the CBY's 
annual report and are divided into oil and gas revenues and 
non-oil revenues. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Parliament passed the 2010 national budget on 
December 23, 2009, a copy of which the Finance Committee 
Chairman provided to EconOff.  The 87-page publication 
includes both revenues and expenditures.  As per REF A 
request, there were no national events in 2009 that adversely 
affected budget transparency.  CBY Sub-governor Ibrahim 
al-Nahari told EconOff in mid-December 2009 that the Ministry 
of Finance and CBY is now providing greater detail, including 
specific budget amounts for new ROYG initiatives and expenses 
broken down by governorate, in the online version of the 
national budget following our August 2009 demarche on 
increasing fiscal transparency (REF B). 
 
¶3. (SBU) It is difficult to assess fully the accuracy of ROYG 
reports on government revenues and expenditures, due to a 
lack of independent analytical organizations and the absence 
of any freedom of information laws. The lack of 
record-keeping among many Yemeni businesses, coupled with 
widespread corruption in the oil sector and the Tax and 
Customs Authorities, makes accurate budget information hard 
to come by for the government itself.  World Bank 
representatives in Yemen tell us that different ROYG 
ministries and organizations publish widely varying budget 
figures and there is no information on how data, especially 
revenue figures, is derived. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post believes that Yemen is in compliance with 
Section 7086(c)(1) of the Department of State Foreign 
Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act (SFOAA), 
but would benefit greatly from capacity-building assistance 
targeting the Central Statistical Organization (CSO), the Tax 
Authority, and the Ministry of Finance.  Training ROYG 
accountants, statisticians, and economists in best practices 
would go a long way in improving survey methods, budget 
analysis, and transparency.  End Comment.
