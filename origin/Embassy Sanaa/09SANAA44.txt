SUBJECT: YEMEN CONFIRMS PARTICIPATION AT CONTACT GROUP ON 
SOMALI PIRACY 
 
REF: STATE 1223 
 
¶1.  Abdul Hakeem al-Eryani, Director of the Office of the 
Foreign Minister, confirmed on January 10 that Yemen's 
Permanent Representative to the United Nations will attend 
the January 13-14 Contact Group on Somali Piracy. 
 
¶2.  Poloff provided al-Eryani with reftel draft agenda and 
proposed meeting communiqu.  He expressed concern over 
"duplicative efforts" in establishing an interim 
Counter-Piracy Coordination Center, especially since the 
International Maritime Organization will soon meet in 
Djibouti to discuss a similar agenda.  Yemen, he said, is 
still interested in hosting a regional counter-piracy center 
in the south.  Reviewing focus area 3 in the communiqu, he 
told Poloff that the Europeans were "well aware" of Yemen's 
judicial process and the fact that the death penalty was an 
option for convicted pirates.  Al-Eryani thanked Poloff for 
the additional information on the meeting and said that he 
would pass along the information to Yemen's mission to the UN.
