CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 18519 
 
1.(SBU) Upon receipt of reftel late on afternoon of 1 
February, PolCouns provided ref points to the Andean Division 
of the Ministry of External Relations (MRE).  PolCouns 
followed up early on 2 February with the division's acting 
deputy for Colombia and Peru, Lincoln Bernardes.  Bernardes 
indicated he had reviewed the points and would provide them 
to Brazil's ambassador in Bogota, who is representing the GOB 
at the Cartagena conference. 
 
Â¶2. (SBU) Bernardes did not offer a view on ref points, but 
said it was his understanding that a working draft of a 
conference statement remains under discussion among 
delegations in Cartagena, and he anticipated that the 
Colombians would press for language on terrorism in the final 
document.  At the same time, Bernardes (who serves in the 
political section in Brazil's embassy in Bogota and is on TDY 
at his ministry) opined that the GOC may well prefer a 
statement that is not seen as specifically provocative toward 
Venezuela, in light of ongoing GOC and GOV efforts to ramp 
down bilateral tensions stemming from the recent rendition to 
Colombia from Venezuela of a FARC official.
