¶1. Scioff met with Tasso Azevedo, head of the recently established 
Brazilian Forest Service and architect of Brazil's Forest 
Concessions Law(ref A), on August 18.  A follow-on to earlier 
conversations with the Ministry of Environment (MMA), this meeting 
clarified where the MMA would like to cooperate in the realm of 
sustainable forest management, rounding out a five-part 
collaborative agenda. (ref B) 
 
¶2. Tasso highlighted three areas of import.  In the first, the GoB 
would like to work with the USG to develop its register of public 
lands.  Tasso noted that the GoB would benefit from understanding 
how the USG set up its register, how it collected the data and how 
it organized the information it obtained.  Additionally, Tasso 
highlighted the work of inventorying Brazilian forests and also 
commented that he would like to see the expansion of the LABEX 
program which is an exchange between the USDA and Embrapa (Brazilian 
Agricultural Research Service). 
 
¶3. Most importantly, Tasso underscored Brazil's reliance on 
satellite imagery to map, monitor and enforce its forest regime. 
With Landsat faltering, access to reliable and affordable data is 
difficult.  He noted that Brazil is still able to utilize the SPOT, 
Quickbird and IKONOS satellites to obtain imagery, but commented 
that the images cost a fortune and exceed Brazil's operating budget. 
 Tasso stated implicitly that of all the assistance the USG could 
povide, the most beneficial will be access to satelite images.
