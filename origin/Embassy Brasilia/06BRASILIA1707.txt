¶1. Summary: Brazil intends to invest US$ 640,000 to develop a system 
that will monitor selective logging in the Amazon.  The GoB hopes 
that the program will provide another weapon to combat deforestation 
and shore up enforcement mechanisms for the recently passed Forest 
Concessions Law.(ref A)  INPE (The National Institute of Space 
Studies) an arm of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) will 
coordinate the program while the NGO, IMAZON, is responsible for 
executing the project.  Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Environment 
(MMA) should finance US$ 450,000 of the project.  An additional US$ 
190,000 will come from a multi-use fund that supports a variety of 
integrated Amazon research activities from the LBA (Large Scale 
Biosphere-Atmosphere Project in the Amazon) to the Ministry of 
Agriculture. End Summary 
 
¶2. The project will begin with a planning workshop (to develop a 
data collection model and a timeline) whenever the contract between 
INPE, IMAZON and the MMA closes.  IMAZON's Carlos Souza speculates 
this should occur around the end of 2006.  Once a model is 
established, IMAZON will spend 3 months testing and calibrating the 
process along the new BR-163 sustainable forest district.(ref B) 
The project will then expand to chart selective logging in other 
regions of the Amazon.  The ultimate goals are to create a map of 
locales where selective logging is occurring and, more importantly, 
to demonstrate the viability of the system for future use. 
 
¶3. The project will test a methodology for monitoring selective 
logging developed by IMAZON's Carlos Souza Jr.  Current monitoring 
systems are not attuned to map areas with intact vegetation and can 
only reveal logging in wide open areas.  Souza's method can pinpoint 
logged areas where a significant amount of forest cover remains. 
One challenge the project faces is to decide from where to obtain 
the necessary satellite imagery for the project.  While CBERS 
(China), Landsat (NASA) and Spot (France) are all viable options, 
Spot records the most accurate images.  It is also the most costly. 
A Spot image with a resolution of up to 10 meters costs US$1,600 
while a resolution of 30 meters costs US$1200.  INPE's Dalton 
Valeriano surmises that using Spot to monitor just the Arc of 
Deforestation (approximately one-third of the Amazon) would require 
an outlay of US$ 2.3 million.  Valeriano added, however, that he 
hoped Landsat 8 would increase access to quality images, although it 
is not scheduled to be in orbit until 2009. 
 
¶4. Valeriano hopes the undertaking will create a new tool with which 
to aid deforestation enforcement activities similar to the DETER 
satellite satellite monitoring system which provides deforestation 
statistics every two weeks, or the Prodes satellite monitoring 
system that supplies information on forest fire activities.  He 
recently stated that the system will help to control logging 
activities and enforce a more rational exploitation and management 
of National Forests.  Satellite monitoring reveals logged areas 
which can then be cross-referenced with areas where timber-licenses 
are issued, to reveal illegal deforestation. Moreover this program 
should also provide a measure of the intensity of exploitation in 
the Amazon. 
 
¶5. Comment: While the first US$ 450000 from the MMA is all but 
guaranteed, the additional funding is still in question.  Moreover, 
this is a pilot program designed to demonstrate viability.  Whether 
or not it is successful, the GoB will need to find funding sources 
in coming years to make the system a reality.  That said, the GoB 
and the MMA have a long history of utilizing satellite technology to 
monitor various attributes and aspects of the Amazon.  If Souza's 
method proves a success, the MMA is likely to make the system 
permanent. End Comment
