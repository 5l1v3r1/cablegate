¶1. (SBU) Summary.  On March 17, FCS Senior Commercial Officer (SCO) 
and Commercial Attache met with National Secretary of Public Safety 
Luiz Fernando Correa to discuss pending bilateral trade issues.  In 
this friendly hour-long meeting Correa proved open to cooperation 
with the USG on: a) combating pirate goods, b) security and 
logistical preparations for the upcoming 2007 Pan American Games (in 
contrast to earlier, less-productive sessions on this issue we have 
had with Correa's subordinates), and c) social outreach to Rio de 
Janeiro's favelas.  In the coming weeks, Post will follow-up with 
Correa to find ways to move the ball forward on these and other 
topics.  End Summary. 
 
Anti-Piracy Campaign 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) As the Ministry of Justice's National Secretary of Public 
Safety, Correa has been a key player over the past year in the GOB's 
efforts to crackdown on pirated and contraband goods.  He has 
chaired the GOB's national anti-piracy commission (CNCP) and has 
been supportive of USG efforts (led by USDOJ and financed by INL 
monies) to lend expertise on customs enforcement, piracy, and 
cybercrime to Brazilian law enforcement authorities.  During the 
March 17 meeting, Correa noted that his Ministry is seeking to reach 
the distributors and retailers of pirated goods in the favelas so as 
to encourage these firms to market lower cost items to replace the 
illegal products they now peddle.  Correa expressed interest in 
speaking with U.S. companies that are currently the target of 
pirates to explore ways to reduce the ultimate cost of their 
products to consumers.  The market for lower-cost goods, he 
declared, would be enormous. 
 
Pan Am Games 
------------ 
¶3.  (U - Business Sensitive)  Turning to the issue of the upcoming 
2007 Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro, Correa stated that he had 
recently received correspondence sent by SCO advising the Ministry 
that 15 U.S. companies were interested in offering their 
products/services to the GOB.  SCO explained that these companies 
were worried that the Brazilian government's late start in preparing 
for the Games would mean that security and logistics would suffer. 
Correa acknowledged that the GOB decision to make the Ministry the 
lead on this issue had indeed been tardy, adding that he had 
received budget monies only a few days ago (limited at that) to 
organize auctions for the different components of the project.  He 
divided the upcoming auctions into four areas: 
 
--  Aviation:  In the next few days, the Ministry hopes to open 
bidding for one large troop transport helicopter, six medium size 
helicopters (for multi-mission purposes), eight small (Robinson 
type) two-seat helicopters for surveillance, and eight to twelve 
less expensive Brazilian-made aircraft.  Correa noted that the 
Ministry has been in contact with Bell Helicopters and hoped to meet 
with Bell's president during his upcoming visit to Brazil. 
 
--  Telecommunications:  Correa envisioned that the second bid 
announced would be for thousands of digital radios for the country's 
security forces.  Unlike the earlier Federal Police procurement, 
which the Ministry purchased directly from a French consortium in 
the absence of any open competition, he made clear that the GOB 
wanted this procurement to be fully transparent. 
 
-- Surveillance Cameras:  Correa stated that the GOB will be looking 
to purchase 200-400 additional surveillance cameras, which would 
include software and control systems to monitor roads, parks, 
athletic facilities, and tourist areas.  Ideally, the GOB would like 
to continue purchasing the same camera equipment that Rio has 
already invested in.  (Note:  We know that Rio recently purchased 
surveillance camera systems from a U.S. company, but an Israeli 
company has also supplied similar equipment in the past.) 
 
-- Command and control equipment:  Finally, Correa mentioned that 
the GOB was interested in procuring products/services for command

and incident control. They would need to contract with an 
integrator, which would design and procure a command and control 
system so as to create a cohesive command center that would 
integrate the various police and security units operating involved 
in the Games. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Correa explained that, for the GOB, the Pan Am Games 
provide a huge opportunity to procure equipment that could help in 
improving the overall security situation in Rio de Janeiro.  After 
the Games were over, the government contemplated that the equipment 
would either be left in place or diverted to other cities that 
needed security upgrades.  In particular, he mentioned that some of 
the helicopters and aircraft would be distributed to other 
cities/regions after the Games. 
 
Charitable Projects 
------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  Finally, Correa stated that the GOB hoped to use the Games 
as a way to promote social outreach efforts focused on the youth 
living in Rio's favelas.  He envisions social programs that would 
encourage youth to become involved with the Games in a positive way, 
by volunteering to act as tour guides, or even assisting local 
police with security and neighborhood watch programs.  In 
particular, he thought that it might be possible to pair foreign 
embassies/consulates whose athletes have been invited to participate 
in the games, with specific favelas in Rio.  The embassy/consulate 
would sponsor charitable projects and youth programs for the favela 
and, in turn, residents of that community would root for the 
sponsoring country's athletes in competitions where there was no 
Brazilian participant. 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
¶6. (U)  Correa had a number of ideas, some of them more easy to 
implement than others.  He volunteered to come to the Embassy at 
some point in the near future to provide a full briefing on the 
range of social programs being contemplated, anticipated training 
needs for the police, and all of the security planning and training 
being done by the GOB in anticipation of the Games. In addition to 
the U.S. Embassy, he plans to provide a similar briefings to other 
Embassies located in Brasilia that have shown interest in the Games, 
both in athletic participation as well as commercial competition for 
security procurements. 
 
¶7.  (U)  Post will seek funding (likely through TDA'S Orientation 
Visit program) to bring Correa to the United States. He indicated a 
desire to speak with U.S. companies that provide technologies of 
interest to Brazil's Federal Police, whether or not connected with 
the Pan Am Games procurements. Correa also stated an interest in 
meeting with U.S. officials and industry associations concerned 
about piracy to discuss his ideas on a private sector approach to 
combat the proliferation of counterfeit goods, particularly in Rio. 
Mission believes that such a trip would be in the best interest of 
the United States, as U.S. industry will be facing steep 
international competition for the  Games security procurements. The 
GOB has already made similar visits to other countries.
