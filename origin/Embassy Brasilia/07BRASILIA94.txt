¶1. (U) On January 11, 2007, SCI officer met with Rachel Trajber, 
Coordinator of Environmental Education for the Brazilian Ministry of 
Education.  Trajber has been designated by the Government of Brazil 
(GOB) as GLOBE country coordinator.  GLOBE is a USG sponsored 
interagency science and education program that unites students, 
teachers, and scientists from around the world in study and research 
of the dynamics of the Earth's environment. 
 
¶2. (U) The original launch date for GLOBE in Brazil was October 
¶2006.  However, according to Trajber the GOB postponed that launch 
because it had not received the following items: 1) an official 
document from Embassy Brasilia for the GOB produced 'Diario Oficial' 
(public announcement) designating competency to the USG official who 
will sign the GLOBE accord on behalf of the USG (post understands 
that person will be Peter Ahlf, NASA Science Education Director), 
and; 2) formal approval by the USG of the translated version (in 
Portuguese) of the GLOBE contract for Brazil, which Trajber said was 
submitted to Department for approval last year. 
 
¶3. (U) Trajber confirmed that the GOB has scheduled a new date to 
launch its nationwide GLOBE program in early April 2007.  An 
official GLOBE implementation ceremony would complement a weeklong 
education seminar involving 20 local schools in the town of Nova 
Iquacu (just outside of Rio de Janeiro).  By hosting the seminar and 
GLOBE launch in Nova Iquacu, Trajber said the GOB hopes to bring 
science/environmental education "back to the people."  In addition 
to attendance by GLOBE coordinator, Teresa Kennedy, Trajber hoped 
that local USG representatives will participate in the opening. 
 
¶4. (U) While the GOB fully supports GLOBE's implementation in 
Brazil, the GOB will not finalize its participation in GLOBE or 
begin formal planning of the GLOBE launch event until it has 
received the items listed in paragraph 2.  In order to assure that 
GLOBE is launched as planned in April 2007 in Brazil, Post seeks 
OES/STC assistance in acquiring both of these items.
