SUBJECT: SHOOTDOWN: Brazilian Air Defense Procedures 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  Paragraph 2 contains an Embassy 
translation of the text of the procedures under which Brazil's Air 
Defense Authorities can order a shootdown under Brazilian law. 
These procedures were provided by the Braizilian Air Force and 
should be treated as an internal Brazilian Government document.  The 
procedures detail a number of safeguards to prevent accidental 
shootdowns from occurring, including a requirement for visual 
observation of suspect aircraft and a rigorous chain of command for 
airspace control.  While not specifically mentioned in these 
procedures, Brazilian Air Force sources have confirmed that any 
decision to fire on a suspect aircraft would require personal 
approval from the Chief of the Air Force (to be reported 
separately).  Air Defense Authorities have also clarified that these 
procedures keep their chain of command completely isolated from the 
operations of controllers of civil aviation so there is no 
possibility for anyone outside the chain to become involved in a 
potential shootdown.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
¶2.  (U) Text of Brazilian Procedures 
The Shoot Down is the last step of a sequence which is very 
carefully evaluated and conducted by Air Defense Authorities, 
throughout all levels of the decision making process, who are 
trained and enabled, in accordance with Brazilian Aerospatial 
Defense System`s (SISDABRA) regulations. 
Once in possession of intelligence data, provided by various 
institutions, including the Federal Police, and after being 
identified by radar, the aircraft designated as "suspicious", will 
be submitted to the following air space patrol measures, 
accomplished by an intercepting aircraft: 
Investigatory Measures: Consist of determining or confirming the 
identity of an aircraft or, even, observing its behavior.  They are 
based on the intercepting aircraft`s visible and demonstrative 
approach  toward the intercepted aircraft, with the purpose of 
interrogating it via radio communication or visual signals, 
according to international air traffic rules, as referenced in 
Appendix 2 of Annex II, of the Convention on International Civil 
Aviation; 
Intervention Measures: Following Investigatory Measures, the 
intercepted aircraft is ordered to change its route, with the 
purpose of forcing it to land at a pre- determined airfield, in 
order to be submitted to Ground Control Measures, accomplished by 
Air Force Authorities, Federal Police and Customs. 
Persuasion Measures:  Following Intervention Measures, warning shots 
with tracer ammunition is discharged next to the intercepting 
aircraft, in a way that the intercepted aircraft`s crew can observe 
them, with the intent of persuading them to obey the transmitted 
orders. 
In accordance with SISDABRA`s regulations, the employment of the 
aforementioned air space patrol measures is assigned to the 
following Aerospatial Defense Authorities: 
¶1. The President of the Republic 
¶2. The Minister of Defense 
¶3. The Air Force Commander [level of approval required for shoot 
down] 
¶4. The Commander of Air Operations General-Command 
¶5. The Commander of Brazilian Aerospatial Defense Command 
¶6. The Air Defense Supervisor; and 
¶7. The Air Defense Pilot and  Flight Controller 
After this entire process, aircraft which do not respond to 
Authorities' inquiries will be considered "hostile", becoming 
subject to shoot down, which will be determined by the designated 
competent authority.  As an additional security measure, all 
communications between the aerospatial defense authorities involved 
will be recorded. 
The regulation of the Shoot Down Law, signed by the President of the 
Republic, via Decree number 5.144, dated 16 July, 2004, generated 
instruments of dissuasion needed patrol Brazilian Airspace. The 
matter has been thoroughly discussed within the scope of the Air 
Force Command and Brazilian government.
