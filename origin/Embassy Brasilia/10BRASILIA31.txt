REF: STATE 7493 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) In conjunction with Netherlands ChargC) Frans Van Rijn, 
ChargC) d'Affaires Lisa Kubiske presented the Note Verbale and 
points contained in reftel to Ministry for External Relations Under 
Secretary for Political Affairs Vera Machado.  Machado said that 
the GOB supports the Nuclear Security Summit initiative and noted 
that Brazil has played an active role in the preparation process 
thus far.  Brazilian representatives will attend the February 
meeting in the Hague and "look forward to a good meeting."  Machado 
said that she believed the Summit would have a positive result. 
Brazil Sous-Sherpa Santiago Mourao told ChargC) he believes the 
major question to be settled at the Hague meeting will be on the 
format of the Summit - specifically how to keep most Heads of State 
engaged during periods when they did not have speaking roles. 
Mourao believes the Sherpas are close to agreement on substance and 
the Hague meeting should serve to resolve outstanding points.  He 
concluded by saying that he believed the Nuclear Security Summit 
would provide positive momentum for the NPT RevCon.
