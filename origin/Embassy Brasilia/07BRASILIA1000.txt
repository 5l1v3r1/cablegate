SUBJECT: BRAZIL: INL A/S PATTERSON'S MEETING WITH 
INSTITUTIONAL SECURITY MINISTER FELIX 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR DENNIS HEARNE. REASONS: 1.4 (B)(D). 
 
¶1. (C). Summary.  INL Assistant Secretary Patterson and 
Ambassador Sobel, accompanied by DCM, Embassy Regional 
Affairs Chief, and PolCounselor, met on 14 May with General 
Jorge Armando Felix, chief of the ministerial-level Office of 
Institutional Security (GSI) in Brazil's Presidency.  Felix 
was accompanied by Paulo Uchoa, head of Brazil's National 
Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) and other senior officials. 
Discussion focused on the threat posed to Brazil and the 
region by Bolivia's expanding coca production, and the 
violent organized crime gangs that threaten civil order in 
Rio and Sao Paulo.  Felix provided detailed analysis of both 
problems.  He enthusiastically welcomed A/S Patterson and 
Ambassador Sobel's proposals for Brazil to send a team to 
study new U.S.-Mexico initiatives in cooperation in law 
enforcement, and for reinvigorating the U.S.-Brazil law 
enforcement working group.  He also welcomed expanding 
intelligence cooperation and appeared supportive of possible 
Brazilian naval contribution at JIATF in Key West.  Details 
are provided below.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Felix, a retired army general, combines within his 
office functions analogous in the U.S. system to the Director 
of National Intelligence and the White House ONDCP.  He 
oversees Brazil's civilian intelligence service (ABIN), as 
well as the national drug prevention program (SENAD), and his 
office houses an interagency crisis management and strategic 
research nucleus, the only center of its kind in the GOB.  He 
opened the meeting with warm welcoming remarks and 
expressions of his interest in continuing and expanding 
intelligence cooperation with the United States, which he 
characterized as "already excellent."   The meeting then 
moved to specific discussion of key threat issues confronting 
Brazil. 
 
BOLIVIAN COCAINE AND BRAZIL 
 
¶3. (C) General Felix said Brazil had, for many years, viewed 
itself as primarily a corridor country for narcotics outbound 
to other countries.  The brutal reality of violent, 
drug-driven crime in Brazil's cities has shattered that 
outlook, Felix said, and huge quantities of cocaine and other 
drugs appear in large and small Brazilian communities 
throughout the country.  In that context, Brazil is viewing 
developments in Bolivia with growing alarm.  "We are clearly 
the target" for the low-grade coca based narcotics produced 
in Bolivia, which are flooding Brazilian cities, with 
"devastating" social consequences, he said.  The GOB has 
attempted various "indirect channels"  as well as policy 
suggestions (e.g., crop substitution) with the Bolivians to 
address Brazilian concerns about increasing coca production, 
but the Bolivians always fall back on the "traditional crop" 
argument, which shuts down further discussion, Felix said. 
SENAD Director Uchoa, who chaired the most recent OAS CICADE 
meeting, added that Bolivia remained intransigently committed 
to this position and seems to eschew alternative development 
proposals, despite the vociferous appeals and complaints of 
almost all of the countries represented at the meeting. 
 
¶4. (C) A/S Patterson said the USG continues also to watch 
with deep concern the increase in coca production over the 
past year in Bolivia, and noted statistics that supported the 
perception that much of the narcotics produced were heading 
to Brazil.  Hence Bolivia poses a threat most immediately to 
its neighbors, but the U.S. is also deeply concerned that 
Colombian and Mexican cartels may move into Bolivia, as they 
flee pressures in their countries and seek Bolivia's more 
inviting environment.   A/S Patterson also outlined mounting 
USG concern that Venezuela -- which once had rigorous 
counter-narcotics enforcement -- has now become a virtual 
 
BRASILIA 00001000  002 OF 003 
 
 
open house for narcotics trafficking, with the U.S. 
estimating that 90 percent of the drugs transiting  Venezuela 
are bound for the United States.  Ambassador Sobel added that 
possible FARC-Venezuelan collaboration, as well as the 
increase in trans-Venezuela trafficking activities should be 
a concern of all nations in region, along with the increase 
in Bolivian coca production.  Ambassador Sobel and A/S 
Patterson both stressed the importance of Brazil's government 
speaking out forcefully about these concerns, since U.S. 
influence over Bolivia is limited.  Ambassador Sobel noted as 
an example that Felix's recent testimony on Bolivian 
narcotics before Brazil's congress had received wide 
attention in Bolivia, pointing up the influence of Brazilian 
views. 
 
ORGANIZED CRIMINAL VIOLENCE 
 
¶5. (C) A/S Patterson indicated the USG's interest in 
cooperating with Brazil in its efforts to combat the large 
and violent organized crime groups that terrorize some 
Brazilian cities, especially Rio and Sao Paulo, and she asked 
Felix for his views.  Felix observed that the main organized 
crime gangs -- the PCC in Sao Paulo and Red Command in Rio -- 
are not structured on a traditional "mafia" paradigm seen in 
the U.S. and elsewhere.  Rather, the groups are more diffuse, 
and operate in a cellular structure that works on three 
levels -- small-time criminals, their suppliers (drugs, guns) 
and the commanders -- but in a loose and non-linear fashion. 
This can make penetrating and combating the groups difficult, 
Felix said. 
 
¶6. (C) Narcotics, as well as extortion rackets and robbery, 
fund the gangs but various factors -- beyond the evident 
issue of wide-spread poverty -- contribute to their growth in 
Brazilian society, Felix said.  Brazil's prison system is 
"fragile and flawed,"  with over-crowding, poor facilities 
and insufficient control.  Moreover, the experience of 
military dictatorship in Brazil had led the society in the 
early years of democratic rule to place, at times, a high 
value on liberties and rights of prisoners, at the expense of 
the prime mission of prisons -- protecting society from 
criminals, Felix opined.  Constitutional and legal guarantees 
permitting prison conditions in which gang leaders can openly 
recruit cadres, intimidate guards and officials, and command 
major criminal operations outside the prison walls have to be 
re-assessed and changed, he said.  Brazil's police are 
another part of the problem, Felix said.  Lacking sufficient 
pay, training and resources in many states -- and with the 
quality of the forces varying vastly depending on states' 
wealth and commitment to order -- they are often ineffective 
and vulnerable to corruption and intimidation.  Insufficient 
government force in "ungoverned spaces" and lack of public 
engagement in combating crime are other challenges, Felix 
added. 
 
¶7. (C) Felix said the recent request from Rio's governor for 
federal assistance -- including use of the Brazilian army -- 
to deal with Rio's rampant violent crime offers an 
opportunity to try to construct a model for federal 
intervention in intense crime scenarios that, if successful, 
can have broader application.  The GSI, the federal Public 
Safety Secretariat (SENASP), Federal Police and Brazilian 
defense ministry are all involved in an effort to develop 
this model, Felix said.  A/S Patterson asked about use of the 
Brazilian military in law enforcement missions, and Felix 
explained that there are legal and constitutional issues, but 
the army can perform public order missions.  The developing 
federal-state approach in Rio will likely feature army troops 
taking over "visibility" and routine public order missions 
from state police, freeing the police to devote more 
personnel and resources to "chasing the bandits,"  Felix 
 
BRASILIA 00001000  003 OF 003 
 
 
explained.  In a chilling observation, Felix opined that 
there is some reluctance in the GOB to fully committing the 
army to the law enforcement fight, "because the army is our 
last resort, and if it fails, what do we do then?" 
Information sharing among law enforcement agencies and the 
military also needs to be improved and streamlined, he said. 
 
¶8. (C) A/S Patterson compared the Brazilian crime crisis with 
Mexico's experience, and steps that the GOM is taking to 
enhance police effectiveness and curb intense violence, 
especially in border areas.  The U.S. is working with the GOM 
in innovative new ways to support this effort,  A/S Patterson 
and Ambassador Sobel asked Felix whether Brazil would be 
interested in studying Mexico's plans, and offered to 
facilitate such a project.  Felix responded very positively, 
and said he would put together an appropriate experts group 
for the project, and then be prepared to discuss it further 
with the USG and GOM.   (Note:  Emboffs learned subsequently 
that Felix's office has already contacted the Mexican Embassy 
to follow up on this proposal bilaterally.  End note.) 
 
¶9. (C) Ambassador Sobel also offered to work with the GOB to 
re-invigorate the bilateral law enforcement working group, 
focusing it on contemporary crisis issues and more robust 
cooperative programs, and to discuss further the possibility 
of increased Brazilian navy participation at JIATF in Key 
West.  Felix responded enthusiastically to both proposals, 
and indicated his availability for further engagement. 
 
¶10. (U) This message was cleared by A/S Patterson.
