¶1. (U) THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 

¶2. (SBU) On February 27, 2008, Environment, Science, Technology and Health (ESTH) Counselor met with the Deputy Director of the Ministry of External Relations' Department of Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies, Counselor Luiz Fernando Abbott Galvao, to discuss, among other things, export denials to Iran by Brazil. Per REFTEL A, ESTH Counselor provided Galvao with a copy of the request for information about export denials from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Deputy Director General for Safeguards Olli Heinonen. 

¶3. (SBU) Galvao said that Iran had not requested any exports of nuclear related items from Brazil and so there were no export requests to be denied. Although Galvao shared this information with Post, he was non-commital about formally responding to Heinonen's request.
