¶1. (C) Per reftel, on 24 February PolCouns provided to the 
Foreign Ministry (MRE) Disarmament and Sensitive Technoligy 
Division Chief Santiago Mourao the USG position paper on the 
IAEA BOG meeting scheduled for 28 February to review 
developments in the agency's investigation of Iran since 
November 2004.  Mourao reviewed the paper carefully and 
confirmed that several of the technical issues the USG wanted 
addressed were also issues of concern for the GOB. 
 
¶2. (C) Mourao then provided the following additional comments: 
 
-- The GOB hopes that the technical issues in reftel and 
other outstanding questions can be answered by the agency's 
investigation by June, and before there is any consideration 
of going to the UNSC. 
 
-- Brazil believes it is the agency SG's responsibility to 
tell BOG members in clear terms when he feels he no longer 
has ability to resolve the outstanding issues with Iran. This 
decision is a dramatic one and should not be used as a 
negotiating or pressure tactic, Mourao said.  Mourao 
reiterated the GOB's standing view that referral of the Iran 
question to the Security Council is an irrevocable step that 
should only be taken after the IAEA has exhausted every 
avenue and complied with all its responsibilities under its 
mandate. 
 
-- Brazil supports the European efforts with Iran and the GOB 
is telling the Iranians at every opportunity -- both in 
Brasilia and in multilateral fora -- that they must be 
responsive to the IAEA and forward-leaning in working with 
the Europeans.
