GHz SPECTRUM AUCTION 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
REF: STATE 4730 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Brazil's telecommunications regulatory agency, 
ANATEL, will be auctioning spectrum in the 3.5 GHz frequency band 
once a determination is made whether to allow for full mobility 
within the designated spectrum and whether to place additional 
obligations on 3.5 GHz licensees.  Jeferson Fued Nacif, ANATEL's 
Manager of the Office of International Affairs, explained that 
ANATEL is currently evaluating statements received during the public 
comment period and that the ANATEL board would make a decision on 
full mobility in February, prior to March's planned auction.  Nacif 
confirmed ANATEL's advocacy for a technologically neutral approach 
to spectrum use and that ANATEL supports both Time Division 
Duplexing (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) methods in 
the 3.5 GHz band. ANATEL has received public comments on the subject 
and will make a final decision soon. ANATEL's General Manager of 
Certification and Spectrum Engineering, Maximiliano Martinhao, 
verified that ANATEL's decisions to place domestic sourcing 
requirements on client devices or network equipment used by 3.5 GHz 
licensees as well as imposing obligations on 3.5 GHz licensees to 
contribute to research and development projects in the area of 
telecommunications conducted in Brazil, will be determined after 
public hearings on these issues are held in February.   End 
Summary. 
 
A QUESTION OF COMPETITION 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Nacif highlighting ANATEL's internal debate over whether 
to permit full mobility within the 3.5 GHz frequency by pointing to 
concerns related to the mobile sector's participation in the auction 
and a resulting decrease in competition within the spectrum. Nacif 
argued that the mobile sector's deep pockets would allow them to 
purchase a majority of the spectrum by paying top dollar in an 
auction format, limiting the number of participating companies in 
the spectrum, potentially leading to an unintended monopoly. Nacif 
added that the mobile companies would then be forced to charge 
elevated user fees for the spectrum in order to recover their 
initial investment.  Another argument for restricting mobile 
participation and controlling the pricing in the 3.5GHz band is that 
it would minimize the devaluation effect on the 2.1GHz spectrum 
purchases made during an auction that was held in December 2007. The 
internal debate between maximizing revenues and increasing 
competition is currently being waged between ANATEL and Brazil's 
Ministry of Communications (MOC), with MOC favoring the former 
approach.  ANATEL is studying Japan's spectrum pricing policy that 
favors a cap pricing, pro competition approach and the EU's pro 
revenue approach to see which model best serve's Brazil's interests. 
Nacif noted that should a pro revenue approach be adopted, ANATEL 
would then consider an auction model that fosters increased 
participation by capping licensee's maximum spectrum allotment. One 
idea offered by Nacif would be to sell the auction's 200MHz in lots 
of 5MHz and cap total individual purchases at 20-30MHz. 
 
TECHNICAL ASPECTS 
----------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) In response to the concerns of ANATEL adopting 
technologically restrictive policies for the 3.5 spectrum, Nacif 
confirmed that ANATEL has always adopted technologically neutral 
positions in the past and that both TDD and FDD methods would be 
promoted by ANATEL. However, Nacif and Martinhao emphasized that 
ANATEL is currently analyzing public comments on the subject and 
that a final decision will be made after ANATEL has properly 
assessed the commercial impact of opening the spectrum to both 
systems. Martinhco explained that increased foreign competition and 
its products caused by opening the sector to complete broadband 
mobility has compelled ANATAL to consider local content requirements 
as well as obligating 3.5 GHz licensees to invest in Brazilian 
telecommunications projects.  Martinhao stressed ANATEL's position 
of promoting fair competition and stated that ANATEL and the MOC do 
not want to be perceived as adopting protectionist measures; 
nonetheless, ANATEL will decide on this matter by means of internal 
debates and public comments that will be received in February. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Brazil's auction of the 3.5 GHz spectrum has been 
delayed for over 3 years, a delay that has seen ANATEL and the MOC 
address issues ranging from spectrum pricing policies to full 
mobility participation. In the current internal debate, Brazil is 
considering potential local content requirements and licensee 
obligations to invest in local telecommunication projects as it 
determines its approach to the 3.5 GHz license auction. These 
additional delays to the already three year debate continue to 
deprive subscribers and service providers of much needed
