Classified By: Classified by Political Counselor, Dennis Hearne 
for 
reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Pol Counselor delivered reftel demarche points to 
Foreign Ministry UN Division Chief Glivania de Oliveira late 
on 5 April.  Pol Counselor emphasized that the authorities 
outlined in OP3 of the French draft resolution are seen by 
the USG and others as necessary for an effective 
investigation and are not intended to impinge upon Lebanese 
sovereignty.  Indeed, Pol Counselor stressed a successful 
investigation would reinforce Lebanese sovereignty. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Oliveira took those points on board and stressed 
that the GOB continues to support quick establishment and 
deployment of an investigation commission.  She indicated 
that she would pass demarche points immediately to the 
Brazilian delegation in New York.  She had, however, no 
further substantive reactions to offer.
