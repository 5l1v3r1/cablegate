¶1. (SBU)   On 12 June 2008, EST officer delivered ref talking points 
and non-paper to Minister Santiago Mourao, Head of the Division of 
Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies for Brazil's Foreign 
Ministry.  Minister Mourao indicated that Brazil was already part of 
a civilian nuclear liability convention included in the 1963 Vienna 
convention, which Brazil became party to in 1993, and did not see a 
reason for the additional Convention on Supplementary Compensation 
for Nuclear Damage (CSC).  Mourao stated that the Vienna Convention 
already indicated how liability will be impinged on governments to 
cover civilian damages. 
¶2. (SBU)   Mourao did not envision Brazil ratifying the CSC in the 
near future.  From Brazil's point of view, it will take a long time 
to get enough countries on board for the CSC to come into effect. 
Mourao also did not foresee participation by American firms in 
Brazil's nuclear energy industry because Brazil's nuclear sector is 
a state monopoly and there is no political will to move in the 
direction of opening up the nuclear market.  In addition, the 
nuclear industry is still viewed with suspicion by the Brazilian 
public.  Mourao further explained that while these factors impede a 
present agreement to the CSC, he could not rule out future 
participation as a possibility.  Mourao spoke of the nuclear 
renaissance and agreed that there would be potential benefit for 
Brazil of having increased competition in the nuclear sector. 
¶3. (SBU)   Mourao agreed to read ref paper and contact EST with any 
questions or comments.  EST will follow up with Mourao and will 
advise.
