SUBJECT:  BRAZIL: OCR DEMARCHE RESPONSE 
 
REF:  A) State 107819 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On August 23, EmbOffs delivered the demarche points in 
reftel to Otavio Brandelli, Director of the Division of Intellectual 
Property Rights at the Ministry of External Relations and Ana 
Soares, Deputy Executive Secretary of the National Anti-Piracy 
Council, Ministry of Justice.  The meeting was positive and the 
discourse constructive.  All parties were open to continued 
discussion of the issues raised in reftel. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) GoB interlocutors appeared interested in the mechanics of 
the OCR and Brandelli expressed the desire to see Brazil removed 
from the USTR Special 301 list at some point in the future.  He also 
inquired about the timeframe for a possible USTR visit to Brazil to 
discuss the OCR points and suggested a separate meeting between USTR 
and representatives of the GoB agencies involved in IPR enforcement 
and policy formulation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Brandelli noted that legislation proposed by CNCP and 
supported by a number of GoB agencies would address USG concerns 
about partial sampling of infringing shipments and destruction of 
infringing goods prior to final conclusion of legal action.  This 
proposed legislation is now working its way through the Brazilian 
legislative process. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) He was optimistic that new resources dedicated to the 
patent process would soon result in a reduction of the backlog. 
According to him, INPI has already begun reducing its backlog and 
has a stated goal to reduce processing time to 18 months for new 
applications. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Brandelli requested clarification of two points in the 
demarche: 
 
- The request to enhance protection of agro-chemical data. 
Brandelli felt this was a new issue and requested more information 
on the background. 
 
- He also requested clarification on the point about revocation of 
existing patents.  This was a new issue to him. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) He noted that the largest seizure of pirated items in the 
history of Brazil originated in Miami.  To combat the problem of 
goods originating in U.S. ports, he relayed that the Brazilian 
customs agency (Receita Federal) was interested in establishing a 
closer working relationship with the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol 
(CBP).
