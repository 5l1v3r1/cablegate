SUBJECT: BRAZIL: UPDATE ON THE PROPOSED TROPICAL FOREST CONSERVATION 
ACT (TFCA) PROGRAM 
 
(U) THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  A recommendation to proceed with creation of a 
program under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA) is being 
considered at the highest levels of the Ministry of External 
Relations (MRE).  The Environment Ministry, the environmental 
community, and the Embassy have been urging - and will continue to 
press - for a response from the MRE soon.  Embassy believes that in 
the end the MRE will give a positive response.  In addition, the 
Brazilians may well suggest renewed consideration of their proposal 
to include the entire debt in the TFCA program and not just US$20 
million now on the table.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After extended internal debate and ironing out technical 
issues, the proposal to establish a Tropical Forest Conservation Act 
(TFCA) program in Brazil is before the Deputy Minister of External 
Relations (MRE) Samuel Guimaraes, according to the MRE's Director of 
the Environment Department, Ambassador Luiz Figueiredo Machado.  The 
Vice Minister of the Environment, Izabella Teixeira, is pushing 
forcefully for creating a TFCA program and the MRE - at the working 
level - and the Finance Ministry support.  The three ministries have 
hammered out an arrangement with FUNBIO, a well-respected 
non-governmental, environmental financing entity, to assist in 
implementation of the program.  Figueiredo Machado and his deputy, 
Fernando Coimbra, the Director of the MRE's Environment Division, 
have told the Embassy that the MRE (at least at their level) is in 
favor of concluding the agreement and going forward with creating a 
TFCA program. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Environment Ministry is very frustrated the MRE's slow 
pace, according to Fernando Lyrio, the Director of the International 
Affairs Office.  Moreover, the environmental community is impatient 
too.  In a letter dated August 12, an environmental coalition group 
called the "Pact to Restore the Atlantic Forest" wrote to 
Environment Minister Carlos Minc calling for urgent action on the 
TFCA proposal.  This Pact includes 123 organizations, including the 
Environment Secretariats of five coastal states (e.g., Sao Paulo and 
Rio de Janeiro), and 13 large businesses (e.g., Vale and Citibank). 
A copy of this letter has also been sent to Minister of External 
Relations Celso Amorim.  According to Lyrio, Environment Vice 
Minister Teixeira plans to redouble her efforts to persuade the MRE 
to make a favorable decision now and delay no further. 
 
AMOUNT OF THE DEBT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In the negotiations during 2008, the Brazilians had 
pressed for including all of the outstanding debt to the USG in the 
TFCA program.  The USG offered US$20 million of the debt and a 
willingness to consider a proposal for a second tranche, possibly 
for the entire balance.  Now, that the debt has been reduced through 
payments, it is likely the Brazilians will renew their request for 
including all of the debt within the TFCA program and not just the 
US$20 million.  Embassy would be supportive of such a proposal, 
since the additional amount is shrinking rapidly and, thus, should 
not pose a significantly greater financial burden for the USG.  At 
the same time, agreeing to convert the entire debt would get more of 
a positive response from the Brazilian Government and the Brazilian 
public than a limited US$20 million amount with a possibility of 
more in the future.  Finally, any additional funding would be put to 
good use.  There is no shortage of excellent possibilities for 
conserving tropical forests in Brazil. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT.  Embassy will continue to press the MRE and other 
interested ministries and parties to respond soon and positively to 
the proposal for a TFCA program in Brazil.  In the end, the Embassy 
expects that the MRE will give a green light for a TFCA program and 
so encourages Washington now to start taking a second look at 
including the entire debt rather than going through two or more 
tranches.  END COMMENT.
