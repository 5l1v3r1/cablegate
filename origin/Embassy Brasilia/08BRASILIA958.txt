¶1.  (SBU)   On 2 July 2008, EST officer delivered ref updated copy 
of the P5+1 package for Iran to Minister Santiago Mourao, Head of 
the Division of Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies for Brazil's 
Foreign Ministry.  Minister Mourao expressed appreciation for the 
delivery of the P5+1 package and said that he viewed updated 
incentives as important to peacefully resolving international 
concerns with Iran's uranium enrichment program. 
¶2.  (SBU)  Mourao believes that Iran already found the previous P5+1 
package to be good and was interested in learning what new 
incentives the updated P5+1 package contained.  Mourao also queried 
what had changed in either Iran or the P5+1 to induce the P5+1 to 
believe that Iran would be amenable to an updated package as the 
condition of complete cessation of uranium enrichment by Iran 
remained the same.  Mourao believes that the participation of the 
United States in the P5+1 was positive and may serve to assuage 
Iran's security concerns. 
¶3.  (SBU)   Mourao agreed to read ref updated P5+1 package and to 
contact EST with any questions or comments.  EST will follow up with 
Mourao and will advise.
