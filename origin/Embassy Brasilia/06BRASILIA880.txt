SUBJECT: EARTH DAY EVENT IN BRAZIL 
 
 
¶1.  The embassy community in Brasilia celebrated Earth Day through a 
poster contest with the local international schools entitled, "What 
Earth Day Means to Me".  The Regional Environmental Hub and Public 
Affairs worked closely to make this event a success in not only 
increasing awareness of Earth Day, but also in getting the very 
positive record of the USG on environmental issues out in the 
Brazilian media. 
¶2.  Over 300 students participated in this event with each 
participant receiving a 2006 Earth Day poster.  Three age group 
winners from each school were presented with books on the 
environment as well as donated stuffed animals from the World 
Wildlife Fund during an event held at the Brasilia Botanical Gardens 
on April 22, 2006.  The Charge made remarks to some 50 people 
including all of the winners and their families.  In addition, each 
school was given a set of books on the environment to be used in 
their library. 
¶3.  The embassy provided a press release to the local media giving 
the history of Earth Day, the large turn-out in Brasilia for this 
year's event, and our desire to expand this commemoration in the 
future.  While Brazilians do not traditionally celebrate Earth Day, 
the mission plans on having a larger-scale contest next year to 
increase the exposure of this event and to provide even more 
opportunities for the citizens of Brazil to reflect on how each of 
us can make a difference every day in protecting our planet.
