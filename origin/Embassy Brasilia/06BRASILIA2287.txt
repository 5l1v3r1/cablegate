REF:  SECSTATE 165447 
 
¶1.  (SBU) TSA Regional Attache and Econoffs delivered reftel 
demarche Monday afternoon to representatives from the Brazilian 
National Civil Aviation Authority, ANAC, as well as GOB 
interlocutors from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Brazilian 
Airports Authority, INFRAERO. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GOB representatives present expressed fairly strong 
disfavor to permitting armed pilots to enter into Brazil. It was 
expressed by one ANAC official active in ICAO that "the Brazilian 
national position is to prohibit having any weapon in the cabin of 
an aircraft," and that there is already some resistance to the idea 
of having even Federal Air Marshals on board aircraft flying in and 
out of Brazil.  The same official indicated that the GOB would like 
to see conclusive safety studies done on both the Air Marshal and 
FFDO programs, and would like the evidence to be presented to the 
GOB before any further discussion on this topic.  He seemed to feel 
that the level of risk accepted by ICAO was not in line with what 
the GOB is willing to accept. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An MFA official retained a copy of the written talking 
points.
