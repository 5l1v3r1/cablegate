¶1.  (C)  Summary:  Former President and sitting Senator Jose 
Sarney (PMDB, Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, governing 
coalition; of Amapa) told WHA A/S Thomas Shannon on December 
14 that President Lula is doing a good job and has maintained 
the social calm necessary for growth and development.  Sarney 
recommended that U.S. avoid being drawn into provocative 
situations in the region that would turn out to be "traps." 
He reiterated his view that Hugo Chavez is bent on provoking 
a war with Guyana over the disputed Essequibo territory (refs 
A and B).  Sarney asked Shannon for any information we could 
provide about Venezuelan arms acquisitions.  Sarney said 
Brazil must help Bolivia, but called the new Bolivian 
constitution "illegitimate." He said President Lula's 
December 13 trip to Venezuela was mainly of commercial 
significance, and implied Lula's defeat in Congress over the 
renewal of the tax on financial transactions (CPMF) will not 
be the fiscal disaster some fear.  End summary. 
 
Lula is Doing Well

¶2.  (C)  Former president and sitting Senator Jose Sarney 
told visiting A/S Shannon, accompanied by EEB A/S Daniel 
Sullivan, Ambassador, and poloff (notetaker), that President 
Lula is doing a good job, and his policies are providing 
Brazil the social calm that foster good growth and 
development.  He added that "Lula has a lot of style in his 
personal diplomacy."  Speaking just 14 hours after President 
Lula suffered a historic defeat at the hands of opposition 
senators who rejected his proposal to renew the tax on 
financial transactions, Sarney was sanguine and said the 
government would find the money (i.e., some 40 billion reais, 
about USD 22 billion, in lost annual revenues) one way or 
another.  He did not express any concern about political 
damage to the Lula presidency or financial harm to the 
national budget over the prospect of losing the funds next 
year. 
 
Bolivia's New Constitution is Illegitimate

¶3.  (C) Sarney reviewed some of the historical "episodes" and 
reasons for which he believes Brazil must help Bolivia (ref 
b), including territorial losses to Chile, Peru, Paraguay, 
and Brazil, persistent poverty, and deep ethnic divisions. 
Sarney described Bolivia as a "barely viable state."  Asked 
his views of the new Bolivian constitution, he replied that 
one cannot speak of a constitution as such, since the new 
constitution is "illegitimate, and just another episode in 
Bolivian history." 
 
Venezuela 
- - - - - 
 
¶4.  (C) Sarney said President Lula's December 13 trip to 
Venezuela was chiefly of commercial significance, since Lula 
is trying to increase trade with Venezuela to strengthen the 
overall relationship.  Otherwise, there was no greater 
political significance to the trip.  He said Lula is simply 
trying to be practical, and like capitalists, Lula "goes 
where there is money."  He added that, with regard to 
possible Venezuelan accession to Mercosul, the Democracy 
Clause was "an important vaccine."  Sarney remains convinced 
that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is trying to provoke a 
war with Guyana over the disputed Essequibo region (ref b), 
which would be "bad for Brazil because Brazil had accepted 
the treaty settling the matter, and it reopens the issue." 
He said Brazil had built a road from Manaus to the Guyanese 
border that he hopes might continue to Georgetown, but if 
Chavez acts aggressively toward Guyana it "will create a 
problem for all of us."  He said Itamaraty, the Brazilian 
Ministry of External Relations, is "calm, but we should 
always be concerned about the matter."  Obviously concerned

about Venezuela's capacity to destabilize the region, Sarney 
asked A/S Shannon for any information the USG could provide 
on Venezuelan arms acquisitions.  Sarney also recommended 
that the U.S. would do well to avoid being provoked into 
policies and actions that could be counterproductive and 
could benefit antagonists, saying "the U.S. must be careful 
to avoid falling into traps." 
 
No Brazilian Role with the FARC 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5.  (C)  Asked about a possible role for Brazil in 
negotiations with the FARC, Sarney replied that Brazil does 
not have enough experience in this area to do much more than 
offer good will, and could not "improvise from one day to the 
next."
