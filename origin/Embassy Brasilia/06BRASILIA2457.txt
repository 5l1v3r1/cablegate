REF: BRASILIA 2026 
 
¶1.  On November 16, 2006, Embassy received from the Brazilian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Division of Science and Technology 
(DCTEC/MFA) an official notification (number 60, dated November 16, 
2006) approving the research project proposal titled "Case-Control 
Study of Ademona in Sao Paulo Japanese" or "Small Grants Program for 
Cancer Epidemiology"  (number CA 119682-01A1). The site covered in 
this project is under the direction of Dr. Gerson S. Hamada, from 
the Nikkei Disease Prevention Center, Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
Informal translation of the approval notice follows: 
 
Begin text: 
 
"This is to inform that after consultation to the appropriate 
federal organs, the project titled "Case-Control Study of Ademona in 
Sao Palo Japanese," to be developed by Dr. Gerson S. Hammada, from 
the Nikkei Disease Prevention Center, Sao Paulo - SP, financially 
supported by the National Institutes of Health's (NIH), was approved 
by the Brazilian Government with the following recommendation. 
 
Regarding the details of the technical genetic analysis: the 
researcher informed that the techniques in this field have evolved 
very fast and it is not possible to determine which one will be 
used.  If it was in the current date he would use the RT-PCR, Real 
Time Polimerase Chain Reaction", which, in Portuguese means, reacao 
de polimerizacao em cadeia em tempo real, where the RNAs produced by 
the cells are copied.  It is recommended, in this case, that the 
Brazilian Government is informed if there is any change in the 
genetic analysis. 
 
I emphasize that for the collection and transfer of data and/or 
biological material abroad, procedures should conform to current 
legislation. 
 
Cordially,

Everton Frask Lucero 
Head of the Division of Science and Technology"
