SUBJECT: BRAZIL:  PRELIMINARY RESPONSE - NOT YET APPROVED HRSA/HHS 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM (NMDP) AND REDOME 
(BRAZILIAN VOLUNTEER BONE MARROW DONOR REGISTRY) - MORE TIME NEEDED 
TO INVESTIGATE 
 
REF: STATE 9732 
 
¶1. The Embassy cannot yet sign off on the agreement proposed in 
REFTEL.  Due to Brazilian sensitivities on health related issues, 
the Embassy's ESTH office is seeking more information from the 
Brazilian partner (REDOME) before it can provide a definitive 
response. 
 
¶2.  The Embassy POC for this item is ESTH Officer Jeremy Long - 
LongJW@state.gov - Tel. 55 61 3312-7675. 
 
¶3.  An additional cable will be sent once the Embassy has concluded 
its deliberation.  Embassy anticipates that another two weeks are 
needed because Brazil will be closed for the week of Carnival.
