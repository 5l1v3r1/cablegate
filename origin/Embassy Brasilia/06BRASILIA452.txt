ACTIVITIES IN BRAZIL MIGHT RELATE TO A COURT CASE 
 
¶1.  On February 23, 2006, Embassy Brasilia's Science Section 
received a diplomatic note dated January 25, 2006. In the note, the 
Brazilian Cooperation Agency Division of the United States and 
Canada forwards an inquiry regarding the Bureau of Reclamation's 
activities on the PROAGUA-Semi-Arido Program.  An informal 
translation of the note follows: 
 
Begin text: 
 
"DIP NOTE ABC/DEUC/006/ETEC BRAS-EUA 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presents its compliments to the 
Embassy of the United States of America and has the honor to 
transmit a request from the Ministry of National Integration to the 
Bureau of Reclamation to provide corroborative documentation and 
information to that Brazilian entity, of expenses incurred during 
the  project entitled "Programa Nacional de Irrigacao(PRONI)" 
(National Irrigation Program), subsequently called "Programa de 
Desenvolvimento Sustentavel de Recursos Hidricos para o Semi-Arido 
Brasileiro (PROAGUA)" (Sustainable Development Water Resources 
Program).  This request is made in conformance with article V, 
clause 9 of the "Ajuste Complementar ao Acordo Basico de Cooperacao 
Tecnica para Cooperacao na Area de Irrigacao" (Complementary 
Agreement for Technical Cooperation in the Area of Irrigation), 
signed on November 6, 1986, and the contract's dispositions signed 
by the parties on April 4, 2002. 
 
Per the request of the Ministry of National Integration this 
Ministry is attaching a sample of the chart "Relacoes dos Documentos 
de Despesas" (List of Expenses) to be filled out by the United 
States entity.  Such steps would provide the necessary conditions 
for the Brazilian entity to undertake an analysis of internal 
accounts. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs would appreciate it if efforts were 
made to comply with the request in question. 
 
Brasilia, January 25, 2006." 
 
¶2.  Upon calling the GOB to clarify the specifics of the dip note, 
Post learned that the requested information may be part of a court 
case.  Post has ceased all communications with the GOB on this 
issue, and will await guidance from the Bureau of Reclamation as to 
possible next steps.
