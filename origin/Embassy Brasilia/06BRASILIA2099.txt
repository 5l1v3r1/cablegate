¶1. (SBU) Summary: Brazil's economy expanded by a scant 0.5 percent 
in the second quarter of 2006, a result below most analysts' 
expectations, due primarily to poor results in industrial production 
and investment.  According to Central Bank survey data, the market 
now expects 2006 GDP growth barely to exceed 3%.  As one analyst 
wryly observed of the news, "it's galling, but the Central Bank 
seems to be correct" in its assessment of Brazil's potential 
medium-term growth rate (i.e 3% to 3.5%).  The Central Bank itself, 
however, so far is maintaining a forecast of growth close to 4%, and 
argues that the poor second quarter result primarily was due to 
one-off factors.  Up to now, the ongoing presidential campaign has 
focused on corruption scandals and ethics, however, not on the 
pro-growth reform agenda that whoever wins the October 29 run-off 
will need to pursue.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) According to official GOB data (see chart below), Brazil's 
economy posted worse-than-expected growth in the second quarter. 
GDP was up 0.5% over the previous quarter and 1.2% over the second 
quarter of 2005.  On the supply side, industrial production, which 
contracted 0.3% from the quarter of 2006, was to blame for the poor 
showing.  Examined from the demand side, investment was down 2.2% on 
the quarter, and the contribution of exports to GDP growth also was 
down, by 5.1% from the first quarter.  Given the second quarter 
results, the markets have adjusted downward from 3.5% to 3.1% their 
annual GDP growth predictions over the course of the last three 
weeks, according to weekly Central Bank survey data.

¶3. (SBU) Alexandre Pundek, an advisor to the Central Bank (BCB) 
Board of Directors, told Econoff August 30 that the BCB believes 
that the negative second quarter industrial production result was 
influenced principally by one-off factors, and should not 
necessarily be seen as a new trend.  Principal among these were 
maintenance being performed on one of the blast furnaces at a CSN 
steel plant and maintenance to seven Petrobras offshore oil 
production platforms, he said.  The overall scenario for the year 
 
BRASILIA 00002099  002 OF 002 
 
 
was still good, Pundek argued, and the Central Bank had not revised 
its GDP growth prediction of about 4%.  Consumer price inflation (as 
measured by the IPCA index), he noted, was running at less than 3% 
over the last twelve months and would come in at less than 4% for 
the year.  Credit was doing well, sparking continued strong growth 
in consumption, Pundek affirmed.  Meanwhile, investment would grow 
between 5% and 6%, enough for the overall economy to post growth 
between 3.5% and 4%, according to Pundek. 
 
¶4. (SBU) UN Economist Carlos Mussi, in a conversation prior to the 
release of the second quarter data, anticipated that these would 
show a GDP growth deceleration.  There were many positive signs, 
however, which augured well for the rest of the year.  Credit growth 
was still healthy, Mussi pointed out, a factor which was supporting 
consumption.  The combination of growing wages and falling inflation 
suggested that productivity gains were being passed along to 
workers, Mussi noted.  Mussi noted wryly that, regardless of how 
acrimonious the debate over the level of real interest rates had 
been and their effect on investment and growth sometimes became, the 
experience of the last several years suggests that the Central 
Bank's modeling of maximum potential growth rates, i.e. somewhere 
between 3% and 3.5%, is correct.  Until the investment rate 
increased, he concluded, there was little hope of sustaining higher 
growth rates. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Finance Ministry Economic Policy Secretary Sergio Gomes de 
Almeida acknowledged to visiting Treasury officers Bill Block and 
Jasper Hoek on September 27 that growth for the year likely would be 
lower than the GoB had hoped.  While not proffering a prediction of 
his own, Gomes de Almeida nevertheless argued that the pessimists 
were well off the mark in predicting growth of only 3 percent. 
Gomes de Almeida recognized that investment levels were a problem, 
and stated the GoB hopes to increase investment by four percentage 
points of GDP.  He hoped that increased investment in housing 
construction would help reach that goal. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  Debate over where in the 3% to 4% range the 
Brazilian economy will wind up this year and about the need for 
greater investment is interesting, but beside the point.  To achieve 
sustainable growth at the higher rates necessary to dent entrenched 
poverty, Brazil needs to enact a series of microeconomic reforms 
(i.e. expenditure reform, tax reform, social security reform and 
labor reform), necessary to enhance productivity growth.  Up to now, 
the ongoing presidential campaign has focused on corruption scandals 
and ethics, however, not on the reform agenda that whoever wins the 
October 29 run-off will need to pursue.
