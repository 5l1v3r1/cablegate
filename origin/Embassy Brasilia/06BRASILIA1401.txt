Franco of the Foreign Ministry Division for Meridian American 
Affairs (DAM).  Franco concurred that the situation was 
worrisome and that Brazil, with President Lula,s personal 
connection to President Hugo Chavez, might be able to 
discourage increased Venezuela - DPRK ties.  Franco stated 
that his office would pass the request up to Minister

Brazilian Embassy in Washington, with a recommendation that 
the Minister persuade Lula to raise the topic with Chavez 
when the Venezuelan President visits Brazil on July 20, 2006.
