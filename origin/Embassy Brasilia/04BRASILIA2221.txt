¶1.   (SBU) Summary:  The Brazilian economy grew another 1.5% 
in the second quarter of 2004, marking the third consecutive 
quarter of growth at an annual rate of over 6%, according to 
official figures released August 31.  While still 
preliminary, the growth data confirm what all other recent 
economic data points have been indicating:  the Brazilian 
economy is growing healthily.  The continued economic 
recovery removes a key GoB (and PT party) concern:  Lula, 
Palocci and Meirelles can confidently assert vindication for 
their austere macroeconomic policies.  The grass-roots 
question ahead of October's municipal elections remains:  to 
what degree is Brazil's job and personal-income growth is 
shifting Brazilian voters' perceptions of their own economic 
well-being to Lula's political benefit?  Two threats to the 
sustainability of the recovery are inflationary pressures 
and the continued lack of Congressional action on the GoB 
structural reforms.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.   (U) GoB end-August figures show that the Brazilian 
economy grew 1.5% in the second quarter of 2004, as compared 
to the first quarter.  Parsing the numbers, on the supply 
side Services led growth with a surprising 2.5% increase 
over the previous quarter.  Agriculture output fell slightly 
(-0.3%), while industry grew 0.2%.  On the demand side, 
Consumption and Investment each grew 1.5%, exports grew a 
further 2.2%.  Import growth of 1.6% and government 
consumption growth of 0.2% round out the picture.

¶3.   (U) Investment spending, which grew 1.5% quarter-on- 
quarter, continues to be a significant factor leading this 
economic recovery, as it has from the start.  The solid 
growth in private consumption (1.5%), however, suggests that 
recent growth in real incomes is feeding through to 
consumption decisions.  If sustained, that growth in 
consumption bodes well for the sustainability of the 
recovery.  It also was likely a factor in the surprisingly 
strong showing of services (up 2.5%) in the quarter.  And 
while the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of exports was 
down, this merely reflects a modest lessening from the 
record levels of the previous quarter.  Accumulated growth 
in exports in the first half of 2004 was 17.8%. 
¶4.   (U) With the strength of current GDP recovery now 
beyond dispute, pessimists are proceeding to worry that its 
sustainability will be put at risk from emerging 
inflationary threats and the continued failure of the 
Congress to act on the microeconomic and structural reform 
agenda.  On the former point, the recently released notes 
from the August Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) meeting 
suggest that the Central Bank is now focused on inflationary 
threats, exacerbated by high capacity utilization in 
industry and high energy prices.  While some commentators 
point to slow wage growth and still high unemployment as 
mitigating inflationary pressures, financial markets, 
already resigned to having the Central Bank keep the base 
interest rate (SELIC) at 16% for the rest of the year, are 
starting to talk if not bet on a SELIC interest-rate 
increase before 2005. 
 
¶5.   (U) Meanwhile, the GoB's microeconomic reform agenda 
remains stalled in the Congress, which looks unlikely to 
push through any major legislation ahead of the October 
municipal elections.  Planning Minister Mantega last week 
publicly branded the Congress's failure to pass the Public- 
Private Partnership (PPP) law -- the key GoB measure to 
increase investment in infrastructure and measures to de- 
bottleneck the economy.  For the first time by any top GoB 
official, Mantega talked of enacting the legislation through 
executive decree.  The GoB did recently enact via decree a 
series of adjustments to tax rates designed to foster long- 
term savings. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) While enactment of the PPP legislation via decree 
would be of dubious constitutionality and is a probable non- 
starter, Mantega's utterance may accurately reflect the GoB 
concern at loss of legislative momentum on its microeconomic 
reform agenda.  The GoB sees the much-delayed PPP law in 
particular as key to increasing infrastructure investment 
and eliminating bottlenecks.  One of the key questions going 
forward is whether investment levels under present 
conditions will lead to sufficient capacity expansion 
quickly enough to stave off new inflation.  Such longer-term 
preoccupations aside, the economic news these days is good 
enough that the economy should at least be less of a 
negative for the PT and GoB in the October elections.  How 
much so depends on how quickly and perceptibly the recovery 
feeds through to consumers' pocketbooks.
