(U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION.  PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the H1N1 flu outbreak. 
 
NEW REPORTED CASES: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Health Ministry still has not confirmed any cases of 
H1N1 flu in Brazil.  As of the afternoon of April 29 the Brazilian 
Health Ministry and National Agency on Health Vigilance (ANVISA) are 
monitoring 25 suspected cases of H1N1 flu infections within the 
country.  These cases are spread throughout 11 states in Brazil and 
are related to travel between Brazil and Mexico or the United 
States. 
 
BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT'S RECENT ACTIONS: 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Brazilian Government and the Brazilian press continue 
to emphasize to the public that consuming well-cooked pork meat 
poses no risk of contracting the H1N1 flu.  The Brazilian Health 
Ministry announced that it has 90 million doses of medicine stored 
that can be used to combat flu symptoms.  In addition, the Health 
Ministry announced that it will obtain 54,000 doses of Tamiflu as a 
precaution.  The Health Ministry also called upon the Association of 
Brazilian Travel Agencies (ABAV) to help them to better inform 
tourists about the H1N1 flu outbreak.  The Health Ministry 
reaffirmed during this meeting that Brazil has no immediate 
intentions to restrict travel to and from affected areas.  ANVISA 
did state, however, that it will increase its monitoring and 
inspecting of planes coming in from Spain, New Zealand and the 
United Kingdom.  It already was doing this with respect to planes 
from Mexico, Canada and the United States. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On April 28 President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva went on 
television and radio to calm the public.  He said that Brazil was 
prepared to address this problem.  Also he noted that there was no 
reason to spread fear because the H1N1 flu had yet to arrive in 
Brazil. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Brazilian newspaper "O Estado de Sao Paulo" reported 
today that amid talk of potential international cooperation on 
developing a vaccine for this new H1N1 strain there are also warning 
signs of an obstacle to international cooperation.  The paper quotes 
"diplomats" as saying that Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia continue 
to complain to the World Health Organization that they are being 
requested to provide virus samples but do not receive any financial 
benefit from any resulting vaccines or drugs developed from these 
samples.  According to this article, this access and benefit sharing 
issue could cause tensions to flare as the world seeks to develop 
quickly a vaccine for this new threat. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a meeting at the Guarulhos International Airport in Sao 
Paulo on April 28, officials from the Brazilian Government met with 
officials from the Brazilian Airport Infrastructure Company 
(INFRAERO), the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), and ANVISA to 
discuss ways to prevent the spread of the influenza to Brazil. 
During this meeting officials established several directives: the 
airlines would be required to report cases of travelers who were 
coughing and experiencing fevers higher than 38 degrees centigrade 
(100.4 Fahrenheit); the Ministry of Exterior Relations (MRE) would 
impose no travel restrictions on Mexico and the United States; and 
arriving passengers who are suspected of being infected will be 
subjected to exit procedures for the treatment of any person 
suspected of carrying an infectious disease.  NOTE: This last 
directive does not establish exactly what is to be done with such a 
passenger, and how long these procedures should take.  Additionally, 
many of the guidelines and suggestions seemed to be made 
haphazardly, perhaps reflecting that the government is still trying 
to determine the correct approach to this threat.  END NOTE. 
 
¶7. (SBU) During the meeting, a Mexican airline representative asked 
ANVISA Director General Jose Alvarez da Silva why officials at GRU 
had not implemented procedures similar to the ones implemented in 
airports in Mexico, the United States and Canada.  Da Silva opined 
 
BRASILIA 00000530  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
that if the outbreak had started in Brazil those countries would 
have already closed their airports to Brazilian air traffic. 
 
DEVELOPMENTS WITH MISSION BRAZIL: 
 
¶8. (SBU) The H1N1 Flu working group for Mission Brazil met again 
this morning to coordinate efforts to foster preventative measures 
against a potential H1N1 outbreak within the Mission.  Post's 
Environment, Science and Technology, and Health (ESTH) Counselor and 
ESTH Officer met with Health Ministry officials to underscore the 
intense USG interest in developments and to ensure open lines of 
communication in case the situation worsens.
