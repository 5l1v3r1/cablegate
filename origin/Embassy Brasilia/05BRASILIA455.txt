¶4. Increasing Dengue Cases in Brazil-Bolivia Border 
 
JAN. 22, 2005 - According to the press report, despite 
efforts to control the disease, the number of dengue cases 
in the Brazilian state of Acre have increased, mostly due to 
lack of disease control in their Bolivian neighbor.  An 
estimated 5,395 new cases of the disease were registered in 
the state in 2004, whereas in 2003 there were 1,514 cases - 
a 256% increase!   The towns of Brasileia and Epitaciolandia 
(Brazil) and Cobija (Bolivia) agreed to work together in 
combating the spread of the disease in the region.

¶6. Brazil to Build Four Clinical Research Centers 
 
JAN. 13, 2005 - The Brazilian Ministry of Health plans to 
allocate RS$8 million (US$3 million) to build four clinical 
research centers.  By 2007, another 12 centers are planned 
in all regions of the country.  Each center will be built in 
a teaching hospital and will be accredited by the Ministry 
of Health and the Ministry of Education.  According to the 
press report, this groundbreaking initiative is an attempt 
to reduce the number of researchers sponsored by private 
companies (e.g. pharmaceutical companies).

¶7. Paraguay: Unregulated Rice Crop Irrigation Harms Nature 
 
JAN. 24, 2005 - According to the press report, unregulated 
irrigation of large rice crops in the region of Caazapa 
(province) is slowly drying out the Tebicuary River, the 
region's most important natural resource.  The report also 
points out that the water pumps, which do not have a 
protective filter to avoid fish deaths, kill thousands of 
fish daily.  Locals are concerned with the lack of 
intervention by environmental authorities in the matter.

¶8. Colombia's Promising Forestry Sector 
 
FEB. 05, 2005 - According to Colombia's Ministry of 
Agriculture, increasing the country's forestry activities 
from 150,000 planted hectares to 3 million hectares over a 
period of 5 years will increase the number of jobs from 
(currently) 38,000 to 760,000.  According to the press 
report, Colombia has 16 million hectares fit for sustainable 
forestry activities.

¶9. Argentina: Government Works to Save Forests 
 
JAN. 24, 2005 - The government of Argentina is working on a 
conservation and forest use project in order to reduce 
deforestation in the region of Santiago del Estero, which, 
during the 20th century, lost nearly 2.5 million hectares of 
forests.  Following pressure from environmentalists in the 
region, the local government halted felling in the region in 
mid 2004 for 180 days and began to work on the project, 
which will be ready this year.  The project has received 
criticism from environmentalists who claim it does not 
consider critical concepts and measures.

plans to carry out capacity-building events in order to 
train local workers.

¶11. Deforestation Paves Way in Brazil 
 
JAN. 08, 2005 - BBC News carries an interesting piece on the 
current advance of soybean plantations in the Amazon region 
on Brazil: "Soya bean farmers in Brazil are demanding that a 
600-mile-long stretch of highway, which runs due north 
through the Amazon region, should be paved so it can be used 
in all weathers. But environmentalists are alarmed at the 
plans to cut through the country's natural assets."

¶19. Oil Palm Research Takes off in Colombia 
 
JAN. 21, 2005 - Plans to increase Colombia's share of the 
global palm oil market received a boost last month when the 
Center for Oil Palm Research, Cenipalma, opened its first 
research station. Researchers at the experimental farm - 
called La Vizcaina - will attempt to breed new varieties of 
oil palm that produce higher yields of better quality oil. 
They will also try to improve the palms' ability to resist 
attack by crop pests and diseases.  This site is intended to 
become a living collection of oil palm varieties, with about 
half of the farm's 825 hectares set aside for growing 
samples of both the American oil palm (Elaeis oleifera) and 
the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). Both species are 
grown in Colombia.

Environmental Concern 
 
FEB. 05, 2005 -A project is being developed by the Colombian 
Ministry of Mines and Energy and plans to interconnect 500- 
600 km of electric lines between Colombia and Panama at 
a cost of US$172-221 million.  Environmentalists are 
concerned the lines will cut through and, thus, negatively 
affect, the Darien forest, the largest protected area in 
Central America (597,000 hectares; created in 1980) and also 
claim that the local communities were not consulted.  If the 
project is carried out, the electric lines will connect 
Cerromatoso substation, in Cordoba (Colombia) and Panama II 
by 2008.

¶23. Argentina: Experimental Hydrogen Production, in 
Patagonia 
 
FEB. 01, 2005 - The first trial production of hydrogen was 
successfully carried out in Pico Truncado, Santa Cruz 
(Argentina), generating high hopes for future energy 
possibilities.  The collaboration of the University of 
Quebec, The Hydrogen Association of Argentina, and the city 
of Pico Truncado resulted in a successful demonstration of 
enough hydrogen to inflate small balloons.  Residents of 
Pico Truncado hope that the hydrogen plant will one day meet 
the city's domestic electricity consumption and potentially 
serve as a heat and vehicular fuel source.

JAN. 20, 2005 - Colombian president Alvaro Uribe is 
proposing to his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inacio Lula Da 
Silva, that the two countries construct a hydroelectric 
plant on their common border.  Uribe said the construction 
of a hydroelectric plant would guarantee permanent 
electricity to the Brazilian border town of Tabatinga and, 
on the other side of the border, the Colombian town of 
Leticia.  He said feasibility studies have begun, though 
costs and other relevant issues haven't yet been worked out.

¶26. Brazil: Controversial Hydroelectric Project Follows 
Through 
 
JAN. 12, 2005 - A controversial hydroelectric project, which 
threatens a highly endangered remnant of Brazil's Atlantic 
forest now looks likely to go ahead. Deforestation has 
resumed in the gorge of the Pelotas River dividing the 
southern Brazilian states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande 
do Sul, to prepare for the filling of a reservoir behind the 
180m (590ft) Barra Grande dam. It follows the ending of a 
long impasse during which the $400m project was threatened 
by blockades from local people affected by the dam and court 
proceedings brought by environmental groups.

JAN. 19, 2005 - Environmental groups claim that Codelco's 
Mansa Mina project in Calama will cause significant damage 
to the landscape and want it to be reconsidered.  Citizens 
said they are worried about water filtration near the mine 
and possible runoff into the river Loa. 
State-run Codelco plans to spend US$900 million on a new 
mine in northern Chile that could produce 188,000 metric 
tons of the precious metal a year by 2007. The mine would 
excavate 50,000 tons of copper a day.
