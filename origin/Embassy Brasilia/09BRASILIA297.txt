SUBJECT:  BRAZIL: REQUEST FOR USG HELP IN REPATRIATING TURTLES 
BROUGHT ILLEGALLY INTO BRAZIL FROM THE UNITED STATES 
 
¶1.  On March 6, 2009, Mr. Anderson Luis do Valle from the Brazilian 
Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources (IBAMA) contacted 
Post's Environment, Science and Technology, and Health (ESTH) 
office.  Mr. Valle is the Coordinator of IBAMA's Center for Triage 
of Wild Animals.  He explained that IBAMA had seized approximately 
50 turtles, which he identified as "Trachemys scripta."  That 
species is known as the "Pond Slider" and is a common pet in the 
United States.  It is a medium sized aquatic turtle. 
 
¶2.  Mr. Valle states that these turtles were illegally brought into 
Brazil from the United States and commercialized in Brazil.  This 
species of turtles is an invasive species, and it competes with and 
threatens native species.  Mr. Valle would like to have these 
turtles sent to the United States.  He proposes that IBAMA and the 
USG enter into an agreement or arrangement to return invasive 
species of U.S. origin to the United States.  He noted that the 
Brazilian airline TAM has been willing in the past to repatriate 
trafficked animals at no cost. 
 
¶3.  Post would appreciate Washington's advice on how to respond to 
the request from IBAMA with respect to repatriating, in general, 
species originating in the United States and brought illegally into 
Brazil, and in specific, these turtles.
