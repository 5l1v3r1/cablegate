SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S RESPONSE TO HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 85758 
 
¶1. Poloff delivered reftel's talking points to Marcia Adorno of the 
MFA's Division for Human Rights.  Adorno stated that the GoB 
concurred with the USG's overarching message that the inaugural 
session of the Council should be devoted to planning and building an 
effective framework for future proceedings and that the GoB did not 
expect political discussions.  That said, she also revealed that the 
GoB had heard about select countries posturing to put a discussion 
of Israel on the agenda, but that these calls had not been accepted. 
 
 
¶2. Adorno also took time to reflect on the composition of working 
groups and the Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  She 
noted that the GoB has a flexible approach towards both the working 
groups and the agenda, but did believe that the Brazilian delegation 
would push to create a working group focusing on the Durban 
Conference.  Finally, Adorno declared that the GoB is in favor of 
adopting a Declaration on Rights of Indigenous People, but 
categorically stated that the document required more discussion and 
that the Council's inaugural session was not the place for such a 
debate.
