¶1.        (SBU)   Summary:  The Brazilian Federal Police (DPF) 
executed 20 search and seizure warrants on March 18, 2009, 
concluding a 3 year investigation related to the piracy of U.S. 
military satellite frequencies.  The operation's success was 
supported by U.S. Department of Defense-provided satellite imagery 
and frequency recordings that Brazil's telecommunications regulator, 
ANATEL, used to identify signal theft sites, resulting in concrete 
leads for the DPF to pursue.  The DPF confirmed these locations as 
sites of criminal satellite piracy, and obtained the relevant 
warrants. End Summary 
 
DOD INFORMATION PROVES CRITICAL 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The piracy investigation, which involved mobile satellite 
operators illegally hacking into DOD satellite frequencies, had 
suffered delays due to a lack of concrete evidence needed to bring 
the DPF into the process.  Through the work of the EEB/CIP office, 
post received the DOD satellite imagery and recordings and shared 
this with ANATEL's satellite technicians, who, three weeks later, 
produced a 50 page report highlighting the findings of their 
investigations.  This report was delivered to the DPF, who was now 
fully engaged in the operation.  Once the case was registered with 
the DPF, Post's legal attach provided assistance to their DPF 
contacts in support of the investigation. 
 
 
INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Post would like to recognize the excellent collaborative 
efforts of EEB/CIP, DOD/USSTRATCOM and the FBI in bringing this 3 
year effort to a successful conclusion.  Post has sent a letter from 
Ambassador Sobel to ANATEL's president Ambassador Ronaldo Mota 
Sardenberg and to Brazil's Federal Police Commissioner  Romulo Fisch 
de Berredo Menezes recognizing their constructive role in the 
investigation process and hopes to use this success in pursuing 
other strategic initiatives. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Post notes resolution of this case is an important 
demonstration of excellent cooperation between policy, regulatory 
and enforcement authorities in the United States and Brazil.  The 
importance of concrete information was key to the successful 
resolution of this long-standing case.  We appreciate Washington's 
engagement in providing the details that permitted GOB to take 
decisive action on this case.  End Comment.
