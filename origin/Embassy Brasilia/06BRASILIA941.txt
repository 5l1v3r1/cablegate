¶1.  (SBU) On May 10, 2006, Embassy received Brazilian Government 
Diplomatic Note DMAE/029/MESP-BRAS-EUA in response to changes to the 
Portuguese language version of the NASA/LBA implementing arrangement 
per State 70101. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Informal translation of text of DIP NOTE 029 is as follows: 
 
(Start text) 
 
"DMAE/029/MESP-BRAS-EUA 
 
The Ministry of External Relations compliments the Government of the 
United States of America and has the honor to forward, as an 
enclosure, the Portuguese-language version of the "Implementing 
Arrangement Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil for 
Cooperation on Environmental Scientific Research in the Large Scale 
Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA)." 
 
2) The following changes were made as suggested in the Embassy 
Diplomatic Note 127. 
 
Article 2, Paragraph 1 ) was inserted the expression "podera ser" in 
order to better reflect "may". 
 
Article 3, "caput")  the expression "atividades conjuntas"("joint 
activities") was added 
 
Article 3, (a) the expression "todos os" was removed, which was 
absent from the English version. 
 
Article 8, Paragraph 1 ) the term "in Brazil" was added.; 
 
Article 11, Paragraph 3 ) the terms "acessados," were replaced by 
"divulgados" and the term "transferidos" was corrected to 
"retransferidos." 
 
3) However, the suggestion related to Article 8, Paragraph 3, 
although it was literally reflecting the English version, in 
Portuguese the use of "todos os outros pesquisadores" or "todos os 
demais pesquisadores" enables a better comprehension of the text. 
The following readout would more correctly reflects the meaning of 
the paragraph:  "(...) e para todos os demais pesquisadores sem 
restricoes de custo superiores ao do atendimento da solicitacao do 
usuario." (and to others without restriction at no more than the 
cost of fulfilling the user request.") 
 
Brasilia May 9, 2006." 
(End text).

electronically to State/L/T and L/OES.
