SUBJECT: DEMARCHE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL SPECIAL SESSION 
ON LEBANON 
 
REF: SECSTATE 130904 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)  Poloff met on August 14 with Marcia Adorno, head 
of the Division of Human Rights, who said that, in Brazil's 
view, the Human Rights Council could not fail to address the 
situation in Lebanon (ref).  Brazil voted in favor of the 
resolution text but did not consider it balanced, Adorno 
said.  After the vote, Brazil and Argentina jointly presented 
an explanation of vote, in which the two delegations referred 
to aggressions committed by both sides and urged the 
initiation of talks between the combatants. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Adorno said Brazil's main concern is balance. 
Brazil does not support any kind of attack by any side in the 
conflict; cannot consider Hizballah's attacks or Israel's 
counterattacks reasonable; and views Israel's actions as 
disproportionate.  Sobel
