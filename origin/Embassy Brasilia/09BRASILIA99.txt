¶1. REFTEL D requested the Embassy to review a National Science 
Foundation (NSF) proposed supplemental award (GEO-0907908) to the 
existing NSF research grant GEO-0745732 entitled "IAI Training 
Institute to Develop Capacity Building in Interdisciplinary Global 
Environmental Change Sciences." 
 
¶2. Since the grantee has found an acceptable substitute partner, the 
National Institute for Space Research or INPE, for this project, 
Embassy Brasilia sees no negative foreign policy implications in 
awarding a the supplement (GEO-0907908) 
 
¶3. Since REFTELS A and B indicate that human subject are involved, 
we emphasize the importance of complying with Brazilian laws on the 
export of data and biological material.
