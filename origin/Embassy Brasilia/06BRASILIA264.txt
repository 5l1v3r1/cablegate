DENIED 
 
REFTEL: 05 STATE 231681 
 
¶1. In response to reftel, Brazil's MFA has informed Scioff that the 
request, made by the NRC to CNEN (Brazilian Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission) on 12-06-05, to authorize Engalt Sistemas Medicos Ltda. 
to import sealed quantities of Co-60 from International Isotopes, 
Inc. was denied on 12-12-05 because Engalt is not licensed by CNEN 
to possess or use radioactive materials. 
 
¶2. As regards Brazil's progress on the IAEA Code of Conduct for the 
Security and Protection of Radioactive Sources, the MFA has informed 
that Brazil possesses a system of import/export controls for 
radioactive sources which is absolutely compatible with the 
requisites of the "Code of Conduct" and the "Guidelines." 
Furthermore, Brazil is searching to establish administrative accords 
with principal commercial partners aiming to expedite and increase 
security in the exchange requests for consent and their responses. 
The MFA also reported that Brazil has indicated a point of contact 
for solicitations/responses, sent a note to the Director General of 
the IAEA supporting implementation of the Code of Conduct, and is 
sending a note in support of the Guidelines requisites.
