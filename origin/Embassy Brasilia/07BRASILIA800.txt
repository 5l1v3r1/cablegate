COOPERATION 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  The 13th Brazilian Symposium on Remote Sensing was 
held from April 23-26 attracting nearly 2,000 participants.  While 
the focus of the event was on increasing regional cooperation on 
remote sensing technologies through transferring technology, sharing 
methodologies, and building up regional capacities; the event also 
focused in on a number of specific areas including using the 
technology to follow and predict changes such as forest cover and 
health issues caused by the impacts of global climate change. 
Congregants also discussed increasing regional science and 
technology cooperation with a view towards supporting a Latin 
American space program.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------- 
THE EVENT 
--------- 
 
¶2.  The 13th Brazilian Symposium on Remote Sensing, held in 
Florianopolis April 23-26, 2007 attracted nearly 2,000 participants 
from several parts of the country as well as from several other 
parts of the world.  Compared to the previous conference two years 
ago, there was a 50 percent increase in the submission of technical 
papers for the symposium.  According to the event organizers, this 
growing interest in the topic can be attributed to the strengthening 
and expansion of graduate programs in the country, the intrinsic 
growth of imaging technology and data processing, and a growing 
interest in understanding Earth objects, phenomenon, and processes 
through remote sensing and associated technologies. 
 
-------------------- 
REGIONAL COOPERATION 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  For the first time since the first symposium in 1978, the event 
included an exclusive session to discuss Latin American cooperation 
in remote sensing technologies.  Participants from Brazil, 
Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru (Colombia was unable to 
attend at the last minute) all demonstrated enthusiastic interest in 
cooperation among Latin American countries.  According to Sergio 
Gaudenzi, president of the Brazilian Space Agency AEB, Brazil is 
interested in proposing a Latin American satellite or, in his own 
words, "something similar to the international space station," in 
which each country would contribute with some part.  A South 
American Space Agency was also discussed and the idea was well 
received.  At the end of the session, members of the table agreed to 
come back in two years with more concrete and mature ideas to make 
this cooperation a reality. 
 
¶4.  There are already two groups for cooperation in the area of 
remote sensing: SELPER (Latin America Society for Remote Sensing), 
one of the sponsors of the Florianopolis event, and CRECTEALC (Latin 
America Regional Center for Space Science and Technology), which 
encompasses a broader range of space technologies. 
 
¶5.  According to Brazil's Institute for Space Research INPE, the 
 
BRASILIA 00000800  002 OF 002 
 
 
areas that are of most interest in cooperation are capacity building 
and methodology transfer.  Brazil, namely INPE, has become a 
reference in South America for these capacity-building courses, with 
over 2,000 professionals in the region trained in advanced 
geotechnologies since 1999. 
 
------------------------- 
CLIMATE CHANGE, HOT TOPIC 
------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The symposium also included an entire morning session to discuss 
the impacts of climate change in Brazil, looking at health, 
agriculture, biodiversity, and biogeochemical cycles.  Members of 
the table pointed to the lack of long-term, domestically-produced 
research in the area and called for more research, especially using 
remote sensing technologies.  Members of the Brazil commission for 
the IPCC (Carlos Nobre (INPE), Jose Marengo (INPE), and Ulisses 
Confalonieri (Fiocruz)) gave a brief overview of the 
recently-published evaluation reports. Brazil's study group on 
climate change has a webpage updated frequently for more 
information: http://www.cptec.inpe.br/mudancas_climaticas/
