¶1.  (SBU) On February 11, Post delivered the concerns expressed in 
REFTEL A to the key Brazilian players involved in handling the 
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB).  The Ministry of Exterior 
Relations' (MRE) Director of the Environment Division, Counselor 
Fernando Coimbra, leads the Government of Brazil's (GOB) team 
dealing with the CPB.  He will head up the Brazilian delegation to 
the upcoming meeting in Mexico City.  Coimbra appreciated receiving 
the USG's input.  He told Environment, Science and Technology, and 
Health (ESTH) Counselor that Brazil - the world's second largest 
agriculture exporter - was concerned by militant environmentalists. 
At the same time, the GOB has been a leader on environmental issues 
in general and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the 
parent agreement for the CPB, was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. 
Thus, he indicated they would be trying to find a balance on CPB. 
Coimbra suggested a bilateral meeting with the USG delegation on the 
margins of the Mexico City meeting.  He will also be at the Nairobi 
UNEP meeting and offered to meet with USG officials there too. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Agriculture Counselor met with the Ministry of Agriculture 
(MAPA) and discussed the USG concerns.  He met with Marcus Vinicius 
Segurado Coelho, the Coordinator for Biosafety Issues, Dr. Jose 
Silvino da Silva Filho, the MAPA General Counsel, and Juliana 
Ribeiro Alexandre, Deputy Coordinator for Biosafety Issues.  Coelho 
tells Post that MAPA takes a similar stance as the USG toward the 
CPB issues.  MAPA officials correctly note, however, that policy is 
not set by MAPA alone.  MRE, led by Coimbra, has the negotiating 
power.  Economic Counselor met with MRE's World Trade Organization 
office's Celso Franca, who indicated that Brazil would have similar 
concerns as an agricultural exporter, but also deferred to MRE's CPB 
team for the definitive GOB position. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT.  Post encourages USG officials to take up 
Coimbra's offer for bilateral meetings at Mexico City and/or 
Nairobi.  Usually, though not always, agriculture trade interests 
will trump environmental ones in Brazil.  See REFTEL B for example. 
Here, where Brazil is a major exporter of Living Modified Organisms 
and agriculture exports play a key role in the economy, there 
appears to be an excellent opportunity to work together on these 
sensitive CPB issues.  END COMMENT.
