¶1.       (SBU)  On December 2, poloff delivered reftel demarche to 
Glaucia Gauch, head of the Department of Human Rights and Social 
Affairs of the Ministry of External Relations (MRE).  Poloff 
followed up by delivering a copy of the "Defamation of Religions" 
non-paper to Nathanael de Souza e Silva who works under Gauch. 
Gauch and Silva said that Brazil is in principle against the 
"defamation of religions" concept, which the GOB considers to be 
inconsistent with both international and Brazilian law, but offered 
no explanation as to why Brazil consistently abstains when the 
issue comes up in the UN. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (SBU)  Comment:  Brazil's abstentions are most likely in 
deference to the OIC.
