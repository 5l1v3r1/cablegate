¶1. (SBU) On January 25, 2006 Econoff delivered ref A talking points 
to Michel Arslanian, First Secretary in the Division of Foreign 
Affairs, Investments and Financial Affairs at Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA).  The meeting was a follow up to the January 23 
meeting CONGEN Rio Econoffs had with the Civil Aviation Department 
(DAC) reps in Rio on the same subject.  In that session, the DAC 
deferred to the MFA's policy authority on the issue. Arslanian noted 
that while Brazil might be willing to cooperate further on civil 
aviation, Brazil's position on an Open Skies Agreement with the U.S. 
has not changed. Arslanian had no information on what form further 
cooperation might take. He offered to share our request with 
aviation transport authorities. A formal response to our demarche 
will come later, he said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Arslanian said he understood the timing of our request in 
light of the recent naming of National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) 
members and the changed role of the DAC (ref B). Arslanian asked 
about anecdotal evidence of the relative ease other countries 
achieved an Open Skies agreement with the US, stating that many of 
the agreements were done in the 1990s. Econoff pointed out that more 
than 25 agreements were achieved after 2000. 
 
¶3. (U) The cable was coordinated with the Consulate General in Rio 
de Janeiro.
