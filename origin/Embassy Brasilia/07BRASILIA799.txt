¶1.  SUMMARY:  The Brazilian National Network to Fight the 
Trafficking of Wild Animals - RENCTAS, launched The Atlantic Rain 
Forest Wildlife Trafficking Assessment Report on May 2, 2007.  The 
report indicated that the poaching and trafficking in wild animals 
such as monkeys and parrots is reaching a critical state in Brazil. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The assessment report entitled "Wildlife -Preservation and 
Destruction Narrow Threshold - the Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest 
Wildlife Trafficking Assessment Report - Central and Serra do Mar 
Corridors" was launched by RENCTAS on May 2nd, 2007 at the Brazilian 
House of Representatives.  Supported by the Critical Ecosystem 
Partnership Fund and Atlantic Rain Forest Conservation Alliance, 
this event was designed to draw attention to the growing problem of 
wildlife trafficking and to discuss methodologies for sharing 
information in order to address this issue.  Some of these 
methodologies included creating a wildlife crimes database, 
constructing and updating website information about wildlife 
trafficking, and bringing together and informing organizations that 
work directly on combating criminal activity. 
 
¶3.  According to the RENCTAS report, poaching and trafficking in 
wild animals such as monkeys and parrots is reaching a critical 
state in Brazil's Atlantic rain forest and has become a lucrative 
secondary source of income for drug traffickers.  Police 
confiscations have risen to more than 50,000 captured animals in 
2005, up from 15,000 five years earlier. 
 
¶4.  RENCTAS estimates Brazil accounts for about 10 per cent of the 
world's illegal trade in wild animals.  It is further estimated that 
nearly half of the animals - mostly parrots and other birds - go to 
Europe and the United States.  The global trade in poached animals 
and their hides, tusks and bones is worth $US10 billion to $US20 
billion a year, ranking third after arms and drugs trafficking. 
 
¶5.  RENCTAS warned that a recent government decision to reorganize 
the Brazilian Environmental Protection Agency IBAMA (see reftel), 
could increase animal trafficking.
