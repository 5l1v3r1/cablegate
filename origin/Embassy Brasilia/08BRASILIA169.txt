SUBJECT:  BRAZIL CIVAIR: MEETINGS WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ON 
PROPOSED GUARULHOS FEE INCREASE, AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
REF A) SECSTATE 3163 B) BRASILIA 129 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ref A points were raised in Ambassador's January 10 meeting 
with Tourism Minister Suplicy, in Ambassador's January 17 meeting 
with Defense Minister Jobim (ref B) and by Econcouns and Econoff in 
January 18 meeting with Ronaldo Costa Filho, the head of the 
Ministry of External Relations's (MRE's) Division of Negotiations of 
Services.  A follow-up meeting is scheduled with ANAC for February 
¶14.  All relevant government agencies are aware of submissions sent 
by the four major US carriers, the Air Transport Association, and 
the International Transport Association to ANAC during the open 
comment period that closed January 12 on the proposed Guarulhos 
airport parking fee increase. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Overall, interlocutors emphasized the Brazilian government 
must take steps to address the infrastructure challenges faced by 
the Sao Paulo airport.  Interlocutors noted that response during the 
comment period had been heavy, negative, and from a broad 
cross-section of carriers.  Interlocutors appeared receptive to 
alternatives to a dramatic fee increase that would address Sao 
Paulo's short- and medium-term infrastructure challenges.  Feedback 
received by US Mission, and information shared by Japanese and 
Canadian missions in Brazil indicate that the Brazilian government 
is consulting heavily internally, will issue a response in several 
weeks, and that while fees may be increased as part of a proposed 
solution to congestion issues in Sao Paulo, the dramatic hike 
originally proposed appears less likely.  Mission will continue to 
track this issue closely and report developments. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On a separate aviation infrastructure-related issue, 
Foreign Commercial Service accompanied a US manufacturer of 
equipment that texturizes runways-for better traction upon takeoff 
and landing, as well as overall water dispersion and drainage-to 
meetings with the Brazilian Ministry of Defense's Secretariat of 
Civil Aviation, and later with the GOB's airport authority, 
INFRAERO.  This equipment, used by many of the U.S.'s busiest 
airports, claims a three-day process for work that INFRAERO's 
current equipment takes three months to accomplish.  INFRAERO plans 
to draw up a contract proposal within the next few weeks for the 
company to perform work at the three Sao Paulo area airports 
(Congonhas, Guarulhos and Campinas-Viracopos), the two Rio de 
Janeiro airports (Tom Jobim-Galeao and Santos Dumont), and Belo 
Horizonte's Confins Airport, which should help address some of the 
problems impacting airport efficiency and safety in the short-term. 
FCS will continue to follow up.
