¶2.  (SBU) On February 27, 2008, Environment, Science, Technology and 
Health (ESTH) Counselor met with the Deputy Director of the Ministry 
of External Relations' Department of Disarmament and Sensitive 
Technologies, Counselor Luiz Fernando Abbott Galvao, to discuss, 
among other things, developing a mechanism for reliable access to 
nuclear fuels (RANF) under the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA).  ESTH Counselor delivered the points in REFTEL. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Galvao thanked the USG for sharing its views.  He said 
that the Government of Brazil (GOB) was "ready to take part in 
discussions" on RANF.  He added, Brazil feels pretty comfortable 
with RANF because it is developing its own enrichment capabilities. 
Galvao saw Brazil as one of the countries that had enrichment 
activities under RANF.  He was looking forward to discussing RANF at 
an upcoming nuclear energy conference in Berlin in April.
