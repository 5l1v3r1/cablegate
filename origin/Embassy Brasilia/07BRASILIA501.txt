SUBJECT: THREE NEW MINISTERS SWORN IN; CABINET SHUFFLE 
ALMOST FINISHED 
 
REF: BRASILIA 457 
 
¶1.  Three new cabinet ministers were sworn in on March 23, 
nearly completing the long-awaited cabinet shuffle of 
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's second term (reftel). 
Lula has also selected Miguel Jorge, a banker, to be the new 
Minister of Development, Industry and Trade.  He could be 
sworn in next week. 
 
¶2.  Walfrido dos Mares Guia, of the Brazilian Labor Party 
(PTB), is the new Minister of  Institutional Relations (or 
"political coordination").  Mares Guia will manage the 
Planalto Palace's relationship with Congress, parties, and 
state governments in this key cabinet job.  Mares Guia is the 
immediate past Tourism Minister. 
 
¶3.  Marta Suplicy, of the Workers Party (PT), is the new 
Minister of Tourism.  She is a longtime PT leader and former 
mayor of Sao Paulo.  She is a possible 2008 Sao Paulo mayoral 
candidate and 2010 presidential candidate. 
 
¶4.  Reinhold Stephanes, of the Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party (PMDB), is the new Minister of Agriculture.  Stephanes 
took leave as a Federal Deputy from Parana state to assume 
the post. 
 
¶5.  Media reports say Miguel Jorge, an executive with the 
Santander Group, has accepted Lula's request to become the 
new Minister of Development, Industry and Trade.  He could be 
sworn in next week. 
 
¶6.  The cabinet shuffle now appears to be almost finished. 
It is widely expected that Lula will also replace Waldir 
Pires, the Minister of Defense.  Deputy Aldo Rebelo, 
Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB), has been mentioned in the 
media this week as a likely successor.  It is uncertain 
whether Guilherme Cassel, Minister of Agrarian Develoment, 
will remain.  Two additional appointments are understood to 
be confirmed but not yet officially announced:  Carlos Lupi, 
head of the Democratic Labor Party (PDT), as Minister of 
Social Security, and Senator Alberto Nascimento, (Party of 
the Republic - Amazonas), as Minister of Transportation.
