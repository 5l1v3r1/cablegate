SUBJECT: BOSNIA:  NO SUBSTANTIVE REPLY ON BIASED 
ISRAEL-RELATED RESOLUTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 118779 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post demarched Bosnian MFA contacts Amb. Milenko 
Misic, Head of Department for Human Rights, and Sanja 
Kenig-Corovic, Head of Department for UN and International 
Organizations, on November 18 regarding the UN General 
Assembly's upcoming discussion of Israel-specific 
resolutions, per reftel.  Misic and Kenig-Corovic had no 
substantive reply at this time. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post notes Bosnia's persistent inability to respond 
substantively to such demarches is based on both the 
complexity of Bosnia's internal political and ethnic makeup 
and the difficulty in getting political decisions made at any 
level up to and including the country's Presidency.
