REF: SECSTATE 24186 
 
We met on March 23 with Sabahka Rado, the head of the 
Department for Central and Eastern Europe at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, to deliver reftel points concerning Russia's 
recognition of Georgia's breakaway regions, Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia, as independent states.  Ms. Rado noted that 
Bosnia has supported resolutions in support of Georgia's 
sovereignty by the UN Security Council, the EU, and the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), 
and like the U.S., opposes Russia's recognition and its 
decision to establish military bases in the breakaway regions.
