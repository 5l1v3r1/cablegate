 (SBU) Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a statement on August 11 saying he was "saddened and angry" by the verdict of Aung San Suu Kyi's "sham trial."  The "purely political" guilty verdict and sentence, Brown said, are "further proof that the military regime in Burma is determined to act with total disregard for accepted standards of the rule of law and in defiance of international opinion."  After an August 11 phone conversation with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Brown also called on the UN Security Council to "respond resolutely and impose a worldwide ban on the sale of arms to the regime."  Foreign Office Burma Coordinator Gill Lever told Poloff August 12 that the UK Government is now focused on encouraging Russia and China to respond more positively to the draft PRST the USG circulated on August 11.
