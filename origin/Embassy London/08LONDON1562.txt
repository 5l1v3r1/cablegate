SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: UK CONTRIBUTION TO THE UN TRUST FUND FOR 
ELECTORAL ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 60286 
 
¶1. (SBU) Zimbabwe Team Leader Ben Llewellyn-Jones said June 5 
the UK plans to contribute GBP 100,000 (approx. 200,000 USD) 
to the UN Trust Fund for Electoral Assistance and is likely 
to finalize the letter of commitment today (June 5).  HMG had 
initially intended to contribute GBP 200,000, but upon 
learning that the South African Development Community (SADC) 
Secretariat will not be accepting foreign contributions 
decided to reduce the UK's trust fund contribution. 
Llewellyn-Jones understands that the African Union (AU) will 
accept trust fund money, but has not yet officially made the 
request for support. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The UK also has an additional GBP 500,000 to 700,000 
(approx. 1 million to 1.4 million USD) to support the 
Zimbabwe elections.  At present, it plans to do that 
discretely through direct bilateral support to SADC member 
states.  HMG is currently finalizing an arrangement with 
Botswana. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Llewellyn-Jones said HMG is lobbying other Europeans 
states, like Holland, to contribute to the UN Trust Fund.  He 
understands that the European Commission will provide support 
directly to the AU, once an official request has been made.
