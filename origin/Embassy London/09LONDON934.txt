SUBJECT: DARFUR/UNAMID: UK ACTIVELY CONSIDERING LIMITED 
SUPPORT TO ETHIOPIAN LOGISTICS UNIT 
 
REF: STATE 39748 (NOTAL) 
 
(SBU) The UK is "actively considering" limited support for 
the logistics unit Ethiopia has pledged to UNAMID, Foreign 
Office Sudan Unit Darfur Desk Officer Duncan Archibald told 
poloff April 22.  Archibald said the UK had provided limited 
funding to facilitate an Ethiopian visit to Ghana to learn 
how the Ghanaians undertook a similar deployment.  He 
explained that the UK "is keen to provide funding," but that 
the UK is "unlikely" to be able to provide a significant 
contribution.  The UK plans to consult internally and make a 
final decision the week of May 4.  Post will work with IO/PSC 
to provide HMG with a detailed list of Ethiopian equipment 
needs.
