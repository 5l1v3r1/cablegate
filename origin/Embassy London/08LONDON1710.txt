If confirmation of the level of traveler's security clearance 
was not contained in the original country clearance request, 
please send it via cable to facilitate unescorted access to 
the Embassy as required by 12 FAM 443.3. 
 
¶8.  Security Information for the United Kingdom: 
Our current threat assessment indicates there are no known 
direct immediate security problems that would affect travel 
to mainland UK.  Travelers planning to stay longer than 30 
days are required to schedule a security briefing with the 
RSO.  For additional threat assessment information regarding 
the United Kingdom and/or Europe, you may contact DS/ITA in 
the State Department at (202) 663-0787. 
 
-- Aviation security:  Travelers are advised to check with 
transportation security authorities to obtain current 
aviation security information. 
 
-- Terrorism.  The United Kingdom is stable and modern, but 
shares with the rest of the world an increased threat of 
terrorist incidents of international origin, as was shown 
with the bombing attack in London July 7, 2005.  Visitors are 
reminded to remain vigilant with regard to their personal 
security and to exercise caution at all times.  The British 
Home Secretary has urged its citizens to be alert and 
vigilant by, for example, keeping an eye out for suspect 
packages or people acting suspiciously at Underground and 
railway stations and airports, and reporting anything 
suspicious to the appropriate authorities by contacting the 
free anti-terrorist telephone hotline on 0800-789-321. 
Travelers should regularly monitor the Department,s internet 
web site at http://travel.state.gov where the current 
Worldwide Caution Public Announcement can be found. In 
addition, if visitors notice any suspicious activity or have 
any security concerns, the embassy Regional Security Officer 
(RSO) should be notified as soon as possible. 
 
From time to time during periods of heightened threat of 
terrorism, the UK government deems it necessary to raise 
levels of security activity.  Heightened activity may include 
the use of troops, who remain at all times under the control 
of the police and are part of long-standing contingency 
plans.  Military personnel and equipment may be deployed at 
airports and other transportation links, or other public 
locations.  For more information about UK safety initiatives, 
consult the UK Civil Contingencies Secretariat website at 
www.ukresilience.gov.uk. 
 
Political demonstrations are well policed and, except at 
times in Northern Ireland, generally orderly.  Although the 
political situation in Northern Ireland has dramatically 
improved since the signing of the Good Friday Agreements in 
1998, incidents of terrorist violence have, nevertheless, 
occurred in the past few years.  Within Northern Ireland, 
flash-points for sectarian confrontations still exist, but 
they are generally removed from areas where tourists 
congregate.  Sporadic incidents of street violence often 
erupt during the summer marching season around the July 12 
public holiday.  As a result, American citizens traveling in 
Northern Ireland have experienced delays and disruption. 
 
-- Street Crime:  London, like other urban centers, has a 
certain amount of street crime.  Although on the increase, 
violent criminal confrontations and the use of firearms are 
relatively rare in the UK.  Burglars and pickpockets are very 
active and visitors are encouraged to safeguard their 
valuables and not carry large amounts of cash or unneeded 
credit cards.  Visitors should be particularly careful on 
crowded streets, in entertainment areas, in department 
stores, restaurants, or on crowded public transportation. 
Travelers are specifically warned not to leave valuables in 
hotel rooms, regardless of the stature of the hotel. 
Recently there has been a measurable increase in street 
crimes involving the theft of cell phones. Visitors should 
avoid as much as possible using cell phones on the streets or 
in other public places.  The police and other emergency 
services in the UK are excellent.  The nationwide telephone 
number to summon emergency assistance is 999. 
 
¶9.  Embassy London looks forward to your visit.
