¶1. (S) Econoff delivered reftel demarche and non-paper July 
31, 2007 to Clive Hughes, Desk Officer Multilateral and 
Strategic Allies Section Counter Terrorism Policy Department 
at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).  Hughes said 
the UK favors co-sponsoring U.S. submissions to the UN 1518 
and 1267 committees and will respond promptly to the request. 
 He noted however the UK is changing its policy on 1267 
exemption requests in response to UK legal review (details 
below) and this might affect the US request for a co-sponsor. 
 
¶2. (S) Regarding 1267 exemption requests, the UK has in the 
past taken the position that opposition by a single Committee 
member constitutes a negative decision by the Committee and 
the UK puts a hold on the exemption request.  He said that a 
UK legal review suggested that a negative decision can only 
be taken by the Committee as a whole and opposition by a 
single member is not a sufficient basis for the UK putting a 
hold on a request.  He said the matter is about to be taken 
to a UK court by a UK-based person, and the FCO wants to 
avoid having UN procedures dragged through domestic UK 
courts.  He said the Committee itself is split over whether a 
single member's opposition constitutes a negative decision, 
and the wording of UN Resolution 1267 is unclear on the 
matter.  The UK is discussing the matter with the Committee 
members and believes the Chinese and Russians will not be 
pleased by the change in UK policy.  Hughes was vague about 
what the UK's new policy on exemption requests will be, but 
indicated the policy is changing.  While co-sponsoring the 
additional U.S. submissions is unrelated to the change in 
policy on exemption requests, Hughes wanted the U.S. to be 
aware of the Russian and Chinese displeasure with the UK over 
its exemption request policy as this displeasure could spill 
over to the designation requests the U.S. is asking the UK to 
co-sponsor.
