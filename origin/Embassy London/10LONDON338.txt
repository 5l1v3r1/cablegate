LEADER ABDUL WAHID AL NOUR 
 
¶1. (SBU) UK-based Sudan Liberation Movement/Abdul Wahid 
(SLM/AW) Spokesman Yahia Ahmed al Bashir Bolad informed 
Poloff February 11 that the SLM/AW Leadership Council took a 
decision February 11 to "freeze authorities and power of the 
head of movement Mr. Abdul Wahid Mohammed Ahmed Nour." 
(COMMENT: While Yahia al Bashir has reported accurately on 
the internal politics of SLM/AW in the past, it is unclear 
from London what the practical effect of this declaration 
will be.  END COMMENT.) 
 
¶2. (U) The SLM/AW Leadership Council issued the following 
statement to AU/UN Joint Mediator Jibriel Bassole, UNSC 
Members, the EU, and the AU: 
 
Decisions of the Leadership Council of Sudan Liberation 
Movement to Freeze Authorities and Powers of the Head of the 
Movement Mr. Abdul Wahid Mohammed Ahmed Nour 
 
Name of Decision: This decision is called a decision to 
freeze authorities and powers of the Head of Movement and to 
authorize the Leadership Council of the Movement to exercise 
the frozen authorities and powers of the Head of Movement. 
 
According to Clause 55 of the main statute of the Sudan 
Liberation Movement (Abdul Wahid al Nour), as the authorities 
and powers granted to the Leadership Council of the Movement, 
the following decisions have been issued: 
 
¶1. To freeze authorities and powers of the Head of Movement 
Mr. Abdul Wahid Mohammed Ahmed Nour due to his public voiced 
and written refusal, the right of self-determination for the 
people of Darfur and his persistence to the united liberal 
and secular Sudan.  The international laws guaranteed the 
right of self-determination to the nations that have suffered 
genocide crimes, ethnic cleansing crimes and crimes of war, 
crime against humanity and rape, thus right for the 
self-determination is a duty for the people of Darfur. 
 
¶2. To authorize the Leadership Council of Sudan Liberation 
Movement to exercise the frozen authorities and powers of the 
Head of Movement, Mr. Abdul Wahid Mohammed Ahmed Nour. 
 
¶3. The Leadership Council of Sudan Liberation Movement 
reiterates its confirmation to persist on the right of 
self-determination for the people of Darfur as basic 
reference and cornerstone to solve the Darfur case, after the 
governing regime in Khartoum committing genocide crimes, 
ethnic cleansing crimes, war crimes and crimes against 
humanity and rape crimes against the people of Darfur. 
 
¶4. To dismiss Mr. Ahmed Mohammedin Abdullah Daw Elbeir from 
his position as consultant and theorist of the Movement and 
to transfer him to the investigating committee by charges of 
financial corruption. 
 
¶5. To dismiss Mr. Nimr Mohammed Abdul Rahman, the Military 
Spokesman of Sudan Liberation Army, from his position and 
transfer him to the investigating committee, accusing him of 
assassination charges of commanders and circumstances of 
arresting Sudan Liberation Movement / Commander Yousif Ahmed 
Yousif (Kerjokola). 
 
Issued, signatory and sealed by the Leadership Council of 
Sudan Liberation Movement (Abdul Wahid al Nour), to be 
implemented as from the date of issue.
