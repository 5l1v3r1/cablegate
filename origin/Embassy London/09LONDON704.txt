SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE: SOME AFRICAN LEADERS CALL FOR RESUMPTION 
OF AID AT LONDON MEETING 
 
REF: LONDON 694 
 
¶1. (SBU) Botswana President Ian Khama called for a resumption 
of aid to Zimbabwe during the March 16 consultative meeting 
with Africa leaders in the run-up to the London Economic 
Summit, according to UK Government officials present at the 
meeting (reftel).  Khama said he was initially "very 
skeptical" that a Government of National Unity (GNU) would 
work between MDC and ZANU-PF, but that after recently seeing 
Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, Khama is convinced that it 
would be a mistake not to support Zimbabwe's GNU by resuming 
aid as quickly as possible.  Kenyan Prime Minister Odinga and 
Tanzanian President Kikwete also agreed that aid to Zimbabwe 
should be resumed in order to support the GNU and ensure its 
success.  Nigerian Finance Minister Mansur Muhtar, however, 
told HMG officials after the meeting that Khama, Odinga, and 
Kikwete's statements had not been previously agreed and did 
not represent a consensus position. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to HMG officials, UK Prime Minister Gordon 
Brown responded by saying that Zimbabwe is receiving 
significant humanitarian support, but additional support will 
come with GNU progress.  Brown said the UK will respond to 
progress in stages, and financial and political support is 
also needed from African countries.
