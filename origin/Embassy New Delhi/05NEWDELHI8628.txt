¶1.  (SBU) Poloff shared Ref A points with MEA Under Secretary 
(Afghanistan) Acquino Vimal on October 8, reiterating USG 
appreciation for India's contributions to Afghan 
reconstruction and urging continued commitment in the next 
phase of assistance.  Vimal reported that the GOI intends to 
continue its involvement in Afghanistan, and was aware of 
plans for a future donors conference, but had not been 
invited yet to the "Kabul Agenda" post-Bonn discussions. 
 
Comment and Action Request 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As reported in Refs B and C, New Delhi is very open 
to the idea of increased engagement and assistance to 
Afghanistan, and India's long-running technical assistance 
programs to developing countries are well-matched to 
Afghanistan's conditions.  Greater Indian assistance has been 
checked largely by the inability of the GOA to identify and 
request targeted aid from New Delhi.  As we approach the 
donors conference in London in January, Post recommends that 
Washington try to include the GOI in planning, both to draw 
on its domestic experience in developing democratic 
institutions in conditions similar to those in Afghanistan, 
and to enlist its full support for and commitment to a 
greater donor role.  We suggest that an institute for the 
promotion of democracy located in Kabul would be an ideal 
project for the US and India to support jointly, contributing 
to our shared goal of strengthening democratic institutions 
in Afghanistan.
