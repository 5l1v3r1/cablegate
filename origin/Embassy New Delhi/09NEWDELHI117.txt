¶1. (SBU) Ministry of External Affairs Joint Secretary 
(Americas) Gaitri Kumar told PolCouns January 16 that while 
India's policy was not to comment officially about the 
nonproliferation sanctions applied to the A.Q. Khan 
proliferation network January 12, India nevertheless viewed 
them as positive.  Kumar shared that public comments by 
Indian officials in support of the sanctions might undermine 
Pakistan's willingness to cooperate with the U.S. in their 
application, as well as complicate India's delicate diplomacy 
with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Mumbai terrorist 
attacks in November of last year. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Local media likewise viewed the sanctions through 
the lens of India's post-Mumbai tensions with Pakistan.  The 
Indian Express judged them to be "a strong diplomatic signal 
to Pakistan."  The paper drew lessons from Pakistan's 
lackluster investigation of the Khan network and Khan's 
short-lived house arrest to justify India's skepticism toward 
Pakistan's promises to credibly investigate and forcefully 
prosecute the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks.
