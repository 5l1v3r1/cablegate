¶1.  (SBU) The MEA released a supportive statement on 
September 19 welcoming the Parliamentary and provincial 
elections in Afghanistan, calling the polls "an important 
stage in Afghanistan's journey towards a peaceful, stable and 
prosperous society," and a demonstration of the population's 
choice of "a non-violent and democratic way of life."  The 
statement reiterated New Delhi's support for Afghan democracy 
and reconstruction, highlighting India's work to strengthen 
democratic institutions in Afghanistan.  The quick approval 
contrasts with New Delhi's reaction to last year's 
presidential elections, when it took several days to issue a 
similar statement commending Afghan voters. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GOI is increasingly comfortable in its role as 
a donor of growing influence in Afghanistan, and much more 
willing to take on a public role as a democracy promoter, as 
shown by the PM's speech at the September 14 launch of the UN 
Democracy Fund.  New Delhi sees building democracy and 
stronger relationships in Afghanistan as a very high priority 
for its foreign policy.  India has offered to train the newly 
elected Afghan MPs in Parliamentary procedures, which will 
be, along with the Indian-built Parliament house, New Delhi's 
most visible pro-democracy effort in Afghanistan.  Building 
on the PM's positive August visit to Kabul, the launch of the 
UN Democracy Fund and the US-India Democracy Initiative, and 
the successful Afghan elections, we have an opportunity to 
partner with the GOI to strengthen the new Afghan democracy 
in a visible way.  Jointly establishing and sponsoring an 
institute for democracy located in Kabul, for instance, would 
be a good way to translate our Democracy Initiative words 
into action.
