(C) MEA Joint Secretary for the Americas Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar called A/PolCouns June 22 to relay the considered Indian response to Ref A demarche. India had decided that it favors the concept of parallel demarches to the Sri Lankans, instead of a joint demarche, because it would have ""better impact."" India was amenable to coordinating messages prior to delivery.
