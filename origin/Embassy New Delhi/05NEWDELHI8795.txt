¶1. (C) Visiting Senior Advisor on UN Reform Ambassador Shirin Tahir-Kheli raised Reftel A points in separate meetings with MEA Joint Secretary (Americas) Jaishankar and Media Advisor to the Prime Ministers Office Sanjay Baru on November 17. In both meetings, our interlocutors underlined that PermRep Nirupam Sen's remarks are in conflict with the GOI's expressed position on UNSC reform (Reftel B). Ambassador Tahir-Kheli noted that even if aimed at a ""non-aligned"" audience, such comments ripple more widely and raise concerns about the fruits of the ""transformed"" US-India relationship. 

¶2. (C) Both Jaishankar and Baru took the point on board and promised to raise it with senior level officials. Baru specifically said he would brief the Prime Minister and was ""not surprised"" at Sen's comments, stating he is a ""creature of the 1970s."" While some might make such comments for tactical reasons, Sen comments reflect his personal opinion. 
¶3. (U) Ambassador Tahir-Kheli has cleared this message.
