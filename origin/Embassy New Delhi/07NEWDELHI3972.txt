Narayanan in Moscow for Defense Talks

¶2.  (SBU) National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan arrived in 
Moscow August 27 for high level defense talks.  In an August 
28 meeting with Acting Secretary of the Russian Security 
Council, Valentin Sobolev, Narayanan reportedly agreed to 
enhance cooperation between the two countries, national 
security councils in view of new challenges to global 
security, citing Afghanistan as an area needing greater 
coordination.  According to media reports, Narayanan met 
August 29 with Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov to counter 
recent Russian chicanery in several recent mega-price tag 
defense sales to India, such as Russia ex post facto hiking 
the contract price for SU-30 fighters by USD two billion and 
the refurbishment of the aircraft carrier Gorshkov by USD 113 
million, as well as the expected many months delay of the 
Gorshkov to India.  Narayanan also discussed nuclear 
cooperation.  Narayanan,s visit will be followed by Indian 
Army Chief J.J. Singh,s September 15-19 visit for defense 
and security talks with top Russian brass.  A likely topic of 
discussion would be the proposed Indo-Russian 
joint-production of a fifth generation fighter plane.  Indian 
Defense Minister A.K. Antony, in a written reply to the 
Indian parliament on August 22, stated that &co-development 
of the fifth generation fighter plane has been identified as 
an important area of cooperation.8  These talks set the 
stage for the Seventh Annual Indo-Russian Inter-Governmental 
Commission on Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-MTC) 
between the two Defense Ministers, scheduled for October, 
¶2007.
