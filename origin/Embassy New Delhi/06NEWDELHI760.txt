REF: STATE 17001 

Classified By: Ambassador Mulford for Reasons 1.4 (B, D) 

¶1. (C) In a February 2 meeting with the Ambassador to deliver reftel points, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran refused to be drawn on Iran's IAEA BOG vote, although he noted the Secretary had spoken to Prime Minister Singh on February 1. 
SIPDIS Saran indicated the Chinese had already given India the EU-3 draft resolution, which we also shared.  When pressed, Saran asked if we knew how other states -- he mentioned Egypt and South Africa in particular -- would vote.  When told it seemed we had a solid number of votes, including those of the P-5, but did not have a country-by-country breakdown of likely supporters, Saran asked if he could receive that information. 

¶2. (C) ACTION REQUEST FOR IO, NP and UNVIE: We would like to share the vote count breakdown by country with India if that information can be shared. 

¶3. (C) COMMENT: The PM told the media February 1 India would vote in its ""enlightened national interest"" as an emerging global power, but intense domestic political controversy around this issue is leading the GOI to look for as much political cover as possible -- including flimsy fig leaves like Egypt and South Africa.  
END COMMENT.
