 ¶1.  EconOff spoke with the Ministry of Finance's Director of 
Cabinet Ahoutou about points raised in reftel.  Ahoutou said 
the government of Cote d'Ivoire takes the matter seriously, 
and government agencies charged with enforcing limits on 
international cash transfers are well trained and vigilant. 
Ahoutou promised to examine the question in further detail in 
coordination with his counterparts from relevant ministries, 
and would provide us with a written description of government 
efforts if warranted.  Post will report the contents of any 
such response if received. 
 
¶2.  Concurrently, Post received two diplomatic notes from the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs on terrorist financing.  Cote 
d'Ivoire assures the U.S. that it will look closely at the 
five individuals recently designated under 
United States Executive Order 13224 as terrorist facilitators 
and will report as soon as the country's relevant 
institutions have sufficiently examined the matter.  The 
Ivorian government is disseminating through relevant 
ministeries the names of the two individuals accepted by the 
United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee (of the five 
submitted by the U.S. and named in the Executive Order) for 
incorporation onto the list of those with ties to Usama bin 
Laden, the Taliban and Al Qaeda for appropriate action.
