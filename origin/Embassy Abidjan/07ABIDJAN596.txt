INITIATIVE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 75287 
 
¶1.  (U) Emboff demarched MFA Director of International 
Organizations and United Nations Affairs Ambassador Tanoh 
Boutchoue on June 3 using reftel talking points.  The MFA 
will report back any official GOCI reaction. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Speaking informally, Boutchoue warmly welcomed the 
President's initiative.  Asserting that global climate change 
affects Africa negatively, the Ambassador pointed to changed 
weather patterns in Cote d'Ivoire and the prospect of further 
political ramifications on the continent due to shifting 
rainfall and resulting grazing and agricultural dislocations. 
 Boutchoue was particularly animated at the potential for 
Cote d'Ivoire to become a biofuels producer and exporter, 
given its abundant capacity to produce sugarcane for ethanol 
and palm oils for biodiesel.
