SUBJECT: GOCI TO LAUNCH PILOT IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM ON MAY

 ¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The Prime Minister,s office and a New 
Forces (FN) representative have told us that on May 18 the 
government will begin a pilot population identification 
program at seven locations in government and FN territory and 
in the Zone of Confidence.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Francois Komoin, Secretary General at the Prime 
Minister,s office, confirmed that the particulars provided 
in a May 12 AFP article on the plan were accurate.  According 
to Komoin, the pilot program will take place in seven 
locations:  three in the south, in Port-Bouet, in Abidjan, 
Tiapoum, near the border with Ghana, and Meagi, near San 
Pedro; two in the Zone of Confidence, in Bangolo and 
Sandegue;  and two in the FN-controlled north, in Bouna in 
the northeast and Botro, near Bouake. Komoin said the pilot 
program would begin on May 18 and be completed by May 25. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Alain Lobognon, NF Secretary General 
Guillaume Soro,s Assistant Chief of Staff for Communication 
and Vice President of the National Commission for the 
Supervision of Identification (an organization established by 
the Linas-Marcoussis accord), the identification will be 
carried out by officials from the Ministry of Justice. 
Lobognon added that Tiapoum was chosen because it is a 
remote, hard-to-reach location, while Meagi,s population 
includes residents from all over West Africa.  These 
locations will therefore be ideal test sites to measure the 
Ministry of Justice,s ability to carry out the work. 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Komoin, the Prime Minister,s office 
and others involved in this project are still working out the 
details and will be meeting through the weekend to finalize 
them.  He expects that the Minister of Justice will announce 
the pilot program at a press conference on Sunday night or 
Monday morning. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  This is a very positive development. 
Identification and national identity are at the core of the 
NF,s grievances.  If the government does launch the 
identification process in a serious manner, it will represent 
an important step forward in the peace process that may 
induce the NF to begin DDR.  After his long trip abroad, it 
seems Banny has moved quickly to make identification happen.
