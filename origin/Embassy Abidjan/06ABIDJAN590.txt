 ¶1.  (U) On May 31, the union of senior public sector health 
personnel, Syndicat National des Cadres Superieurs de la 
Sante de Cote d,Ivoire (SYNACASS-CI), threatened to go on 
strike on June 15 if their demands regarding salary and rank 
within the civil service are not met.  The SYNACASS-CI 
consists of public sector pharmacists, doctors, dentists, 
veterinarians and medical teaching faculty.  The 2,800 
SYNACASS-CI members have multiple grievances:  the failure of 
the government to implement a promised reclassification of 
public sector health doctors at a higher rank within the 
civil service, which was agreed to by the Council of 
Ministers on October 20, 2005; the lack of an upward revision 
of base salaries for health personnel; the continuation of 
the civil service entry test which they want eliminated; the 
lack of compensation for doctors who were displaced by the 
conflict or were victims of the war; and the failure to 
appoint more medical doctors to senior positions at 
government institutions having to do with human and animal 
health. 
 
¶2.  (U) Speaking at a press conference, the leader of the 
SYNACASSI-CI, Dr. Magloire Amichia, denounced the 
government's unwillingness to address these issues, which 
have been pending for three years.  After the union launched 
a one-day strike for settlement of the same list of demands, 
the government agreed to meet with union officials in 
December 2003.  Since then, SYNACASSI-CI has held 
negotiations with successive health ministers and signed a 
protocol agreement with the government of Cote d'Ivoire to 
change the health system.  To date none of the promised 
changes have been implemented. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: This latest threat of yet another strike 
comes at a time when the Ivoirian government is dealing with 
multiple unhappy labor organizations (Reftels A, B, and C). 
Prime Minister Banny has stated that he views these strikes 
as "distractions" from the important work at hand:  DDR, 
reunification of the country, identification, voter 
registration and election preparation.  Banny wants public 
calm and support for his government so he can move forward 
with the peace process.  He cannot afford to allow multiple 
public sector employees, including health workers, teachers, 
and university professors, to simultaneously go on strike and 
disrupt daily life.  As a result, the labor unions see the 
Prime Minister as vulnerable and believe that now is the time 
to press for concessions from the government.  Given the 
government's financial woes, however, it is unlikely that 
Banny will be able to offer much in the way of immediate 
compensation.  End Comment
