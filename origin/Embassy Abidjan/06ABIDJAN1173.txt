SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT CREATES 133 JUDGESHIPS TO RESUME AND 
ACCELERATE IDENTIFICATION/NATIONALITY PROCESS 
 
¶1. (U) President Gbagbo has signed a decree creating 133 
judgeships throughout Cote d'Ivoire, in areas controlled by 
both the government and the New Forces.  The decree was 
signed on October 5 but only published on October 17, on the 
eve of the AU Peace and Security Council meeting on Cote 
d'Ivoire in Addis Ababa.  All 133 judges will have the 
authority to issue certificates of nationality for Ivoirians 
eligible for them.  The identification/nationality process 
has been paralyzed since July of this year over disagreements 
as to when the nationality certificates could be issued and 
by whom.  President Gbagbo had argued that the itinerant 
identification courts (audiences foraines) could issue 
registration for undocumented residents, both Ivoirians and 
foreigners, but that the nationality certificates for 
Ivoirian citizens had to be issued separately.  Suspended 
identification, in turn, has halted the disarmament process. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The new decree, drafted by the Justice Minister and 
signed by President Gbagbo, may get things moving again.  The 
new judges will participate in the audience foraines and, 
separately and subsequently, issue certificates of 
nationality to those residents found to be Ivoirian. 
According to the official in the Ivoirian Justice Ministry in 
charge of the audiences foraines, with 133 judges able to 
issue certificates of nationality, the process of issuing 
certificates to all those who need one should be completed in 
about three months. (Comment: This is probably overly 
optimistic.  End Comment.)  The new decree responds to a call 
by Prime Minister Banny to appoint more judges to speed up 
the nationality process.  It is probably no coincidence that 
the decree was published just before the start of the AU 
summit as it allowed Gbagbo to point to another measure that 
he had implemented to restart the peace process. 
Nevertheless, regardless of the motivation for the action, 
the creation of the new judgeships is a positive development. 
 Even the pro-RDR paper, Le Patriote, has come out in favor 
of the announcement.  The next step will be to identify the 
individuals who can actually step in and fill the newly 
created positions.
