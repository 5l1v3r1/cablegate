Begin translation: 
From the President of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire to His 
Excellency George Bush, President of the United States of 
America, Washington. 
 
Excellency Mr. President, 
RE: Appreciation and gratitude 
The United Kingdom (sic), as a member country of the UN 
Security Council, has taken an active part in the meeting, 
held in New York from October 25th to November 1st 2006, in 
view of finding lasting peace and stability in Cote d'Ivoire. 
 
During the deliberations, the permanent representation of 
your country has worked hard for the respect of the 
sovereignty of the States, a sacred principle of the UN 
Charter. 
 
You have thus made an immense and significant contribution to 
the debate and I am sure it will be very useful for the 
resolution of conflicts and the preservation of peace in the 
world. 
 
I would like, on behalf of the people of Cote d'Ivoire and on 
my own behalf, to express to your Excellency my sincere 
gratitude and reiterate my commitment and determination to 
strengthen the cooperation between our two countries and 
peoples. 
 
Your Excellency, please accept the assurance of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Laurent Gbagbo 
End Translation.
