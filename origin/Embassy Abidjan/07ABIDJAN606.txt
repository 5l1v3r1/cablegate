¶1.  (U)  This cable answers questions 1, 2 and 4 of reftel, 
and provides a partial answer to question 3.  Septel will 
provide the balance of the responses once they are received 
from host government officials. 
 
¶2.  (U) Questions and Answers: 
 
Question 1) Are the airports (DIAP in Abidjan, DIYO in 
Yamossoukrou and DIBK in Bouake) operated by the national 
government or a national government agency? 
 
ASECNA's branch office in Cote d'Ivoire indicates that it has 
exclusive control over commercial takeoffs and landings at 
DIAP and DIYO (the latter only has several domestic flights 
to and from Abidjan per week).  (note: DIBK currently has no 
commercial flights, and is operated by the UN in Cote 
d'Ivoire for its own flights and occasional flights operated 
by international humanitarian NGOS.  End Note) 
 
Question 2) If operations are conducted by an entity which is 
not clearly the government or an agency of the government, 
how much of the entity's funding comes from the national 
government? 
 
N/A (see above) 
 
Question 3) If the airport operates on a for-profit basis, is 
a portion of the revenues (not including taxes) returned to 
the national government? If so, what percentage? 
 
DIAP is operated on a for-profit basis, and airport 
management is contracted to a large European firm, CCI 
Marseille Provence.  However, ASECNA has not provided Post 
the information requested in this question.  Post will 
continue to investigate this question.  The question is N/A 
concerning DIBK at this time. 
 
Question 4) Is the entity operating the airport subject to 
day-to-day operational guidance from the national government? 
 
ASECNA at DIAP and DIYO is not subject to government 
operational guidance, nor is the private operator of the 
airport facility in Abidjan.  The government does manage the 
DIYO facility (though not takeoffs and landings) through its 
parastatal company SODEXAM.  The question is N/A concerning 
DIBK at this time. 
 
Question 5)  What payment methods are currently allowed or 
required by airport authorities for payment of each of the 
following: fuel, parking and landing fees, ground services 
and air navigation fees.  Will the airport authorities accept 
a DOD air card, fund cite, or cash payment for the 
goods/services mentioned? 
 
ASECNA in Cote d'Ivoire accepts cash only for airport fees. 
Charter and other occasional visiting planes pay the fees at 
the ASECNA cashier at DIAP.  Airlines with regularly 
scheduled operations (Air France, SN Brussels, etc.) pay fees 
in a lump sum in cash at ASECNA's office in downtown Abidjan 
on a monthly basis. 
 
¶3.  (U) ASECNA regulations provided to Post indicate that 
military aircraft of ASECNA member states (only) are exempt 
from ASECNA parking, airspace, garage and other fees.
