SUBJECT: IVORIAN POULTRY INDUSTRY CRIES FOWL AS GOVERNMENT 
TO REDUCE POULTRY IMPORT TARIFFS BY 50% 
 
 ¶1.  On November 2, 2006, the Ministry of Animal Husbandry 
and Fisheries announced a plan to slash the tariff on poultry 
imports by 50% (from 22.5% to 11.5%).  The announcement 
followed the October 31 Council of Ministers, which 
recommended taking &all necessary measures to supply the 
poultry market in order to avoid any shortage as the year-end 
festivities draw near.8  As expected, the association of 
local poultry producers known as &Inter-profession Avicole 
Ivoirienne8 (IPRAVI) condemned the proposed tariff cut. 
 
¶2.  On November 3, IPRAVI expressed concern that the plan to 
reduce tariffs on import poultry results from an unjustified 
lack of confidence by the part of the government in the 
quality and volume of local poultry production.  Moreover, 
IPRAVI claims that they do not understand why the Ministry is 
cutting the import tax when they could instead reduce the 
duties paid on various inputs by local poultry operators, 
thus cutting local production costs and aiding in recovery of 
the Ivorian poultry sector.  The IPRAVI has asked the 
government to cancel the tariff cut, threatening that they 
&will find other means to defend their interests.8 
 
¶3.  The poultry sector in Cote d' Ivoire is responsible for 
approximately 15,000 jobs (direct and indirect).  It 
generates total sales of roughly USD 80 million (CFAF 40 
billion) per year, accounting for 0.5% of GDP.  This figure 
is expected to decline by 30% this year due to the losses 
caused by the outbreak of Avian Influenza (AI).  In April 
2006, following the outbreak of AI, the government ordered 
the slaughter of live animals, the closure of poultry markets 
and a ban on poultry imports.  In August 2006 the Ministry of 
Animal Husbandry and Fisheries declared that AI had been 
successfully contained and the government authorized the 
lifting of the import ban and the opening of poultry markets. 
 
 
¶4.  Comment:  The tariff cuts will fruther undermine local 
poultry producers, already hard hit by the outbreak of AI. 
However, the move will be welcomed by Ivorian consumers. 
While poultry prices have increased since AI was reported in 
the country last April, according to industry sources 
consumption now appears to be at the same rate as pre-AI. 
End comment.
