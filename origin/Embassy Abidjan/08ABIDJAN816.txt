Society Forum of the ACP was created to encourage the

Mister President: 
 
Your brilliant, but above all, historic election to the 
Presidency of the United States of America, gives me the 
happy opportunity to extend to you my very heartfelt and warm 
congratulations, as well as those of the Civil Society of the 
79 African, Caribbean and Pacific States, over which I have 
the honor to preside. 
 
For the whole world, a new day has broken.  I would, 
therefore, like to take this opportunity to thank you for 
having aroused a new dawn of hope in developing countries, by 
your accession to the highest office of the United States of 
America.  History will recall it.  May the Almighty Lord 
assist you in your new and prestigious duties. 
 
Please accept, Mister President, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Mr. Lucien Tape Mambo 
Executive President of the 2nd Civil Society Forum of the 79 
African, Caribbean and Pacific States
