Begin Text. 
 
Mister President: 
 
Your inauguration as 44th President of the United States of 
America offers me the pleasant opportunity to extend to you, 
on behalf of the people and the Government of Cote d'Ivoire, 
and on my own behalf, my heartfelt and warmest 
congratulations. 
 
I express my warm wishes for your success as the leader of 
the United States of America which has just given the world a 
real lesson of democracy in action without consideration for 
race. 
 
Your country thus proves that the struggle for a true cause 
is never in vain even if, like President Abraham Lincoln or 
Reverend Martin Luther King, he who leads it does not see its 
success. 
 
May God render the great hope which your election has arisen 
in the American people, but also among millions of people 
worldwide, fulfilled in serving the goals of international 
peace, justice and solidarity. 
 
In this respect, I would like to assure you of my complete 
willingness to work with you toward the success of these 
ideals as well as the strengthening of the excellent ties of 
friendship and cooperation that so fortunately exist between 
Cote d'Ivoire and the United States of America. 
 
With my highest consideration. 
 
Laurent Gbagbo 
President of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire
