SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE WILL SUPPORT NEW RED DIAMOND EMBLEM 
AT JUNE 20 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 95184 
 
On June 16, we met with Ambassador Bernard Tanoh Boutchoue, 
Director of the Office of the United Nations and 
International Organizations at the Ivoirian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  During our discussion, we raised the points 
provided in reftel and again thanked the Ivoirian government 
for its vote to support the amendment of the Third Additional 
Protocol in December 2005.  Boutchoue told us that the 
Ivoirian government was fully in favor of adoption of a 
neutral emblem for the International Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Movement.  For Cote d'Ivoire, this is not a 
political question, it is a question of how to support the 
valuable humanitarian work done by the Movement.  Boutchoue 
promised to contact the Ivoirian Head of Mission in Geneva to 
reinforce Cote d'Ivoire's support for the new emblem and 
highlight the U.S. government's interest in this matter.
