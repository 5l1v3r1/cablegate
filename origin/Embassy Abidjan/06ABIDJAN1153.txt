¶1.  (SBU)  ExxonMobil Regional Director John A.C. Bell, along 
with Regional Manager Frederic Dauvergne and local Director 
General Manar Sall met with EconChief on October 10 to 
discuss the company's announcement to the government of Cote 
d'Ivoire that it intends to sell its stake in its Ivorian 
fuel distribution (downstream) network, which is comprised of 
62 service stations, part ownership and management of the 
offshore fuel unloading terminal and related infrastructure. 
ExxonMobil signed an agreement on October 2nd with Libyan 
parastatal Tamoil to sell its Ivorian assets in a package 
involving similar downstream holdings in Cameroon, Senegal, 
Gabon, Kenya and Reunion, in a move that comes on the heels 
of a parallel sale to Tamoil of the American company's 
distribution networks in 14 other countries in 2005.  The 
entire six-country package is worth, according to ExxonMobil, 
"many hundreds of USD millions." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Bell characterized the move as related to its 
company-wide efforts to centralize back-office functions. 
Smaller African markets with regulated fuel prices, according 
to Bell, don't fit the company's business model.  Tamoil, by 
contrast, has expressed a commitment to investing in Cote 
d'Ivoire (along with the other countries in which it will 
soon be a major player) and to grow the business.  Local 
employees' contracts will be moved to the new company. 
Retrenchments are possible, according to Bell, but experience 
in Niger, where Tamoil bought the ExxonMobil downstream 
business in 2005, was positive: 60-80% of employees and 
management staff have been retained. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ExxonMobil had conducted a limited tender bid for 
the six properties, hoping to sell all in a single package, 
but offering PETROCI (parastatal Ivorian company) and 
PetroGabon (parastatal Gabonese firm) the option of bidding 
on the assets found in their respective countries.  Tamoil's 
bids on all six companies were plainly superior to any 
others.  Petroci complained at the time and asked for the 
opportunity to rebid, and made references to ExxonMobil's 
business license.  Since that time, however, the company has 
not received any hostile communications from Petroci. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Bell's team had met with the Minister of Mining and 
Energy, Leon Emmanuel MONNET on Monday, October 9, and 
brought along a representative from Tamoil, as planned. 
ExxonMobil, fresh on the heels of settling the decades-long 
Centaures Routiers case, doesn't believe it has the 
obligation to obtain Ivorian government approval, but wants 
to conduct its disengagement on the downstream side of its 
business in Cote d'Ivoire gracefully, "through the front 
door."  Surprisingly to Bell and his team, MONNET included a 
representative from Petroci in the meeting.  Despite this, 
the meeting went well.  In an afternoon meeting on Tuesday, 
October 10th with Deputy Cabinet Director Madame Ziringnon 
Sarata OTTRO TOURE things went similarly well (Note: Ottro 
Toure is married to the head of Cote d'Ivoire national 
refinery, who is an elder in  President Gbagbo's family. End 
Note).  Late in the afternoon, the ExxonMobil team was 
abruptly recalled to a 6pm meeting with the Ministry of Mines 
and Energy, but company officials called EconChief afterwards 
and said that meeting, too, went well. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) ExxonMobil officials here indicate that Tamoil's 
influence here may be strong enough to overcome any potential 
lingering resentments related to Petroci's failed bid.  At 
this juncture, the road out of Cote d'Ivoire for the company 
appears smooth, but we will continue to monitor the process 
closely.
