¶1.  On October 7, econoff delivered ref A and B demarches to 
Seraphin Dedi Nadje, Director of Fishery Production, Ministry 
of Animal Production and Fishery Resources. 
 
¶2.  In response to ref A demarche, Mr. Dedi Nadje replied 
that Cote d'Ivoire would be interested in supporting Dr. 
Hogarth's candidacy as Commission chair if Dr. Hogarth would 
encourage more cooperation between Cote d'Ivoire and the 
United States.  For example, Mr. Dedi Nadje cited a study on 
developing the fishery industry in Cote d'Ivoire that was 
financed by the European Union.  In addition to developing 
the fishery industry, Cote d'Ivoire would also welcome closer 
cooperation with the United States in the areas of coastal 
surveillance capability, research on sustainable development, 
and statistical training such as estimating stock.  Mr. Dedi 
Nadje closed by expressing the personal view that a change in 
ICCAT leadership would be good, but he cautioned that Cote 
d'Ivoire has not yet made a final decision on whom it will 
support for the chairmanship.  He noted that Cote d'Ivoire 
itself is unlikely to seek a leadership role in ICCAT this 
year because of the country's ongoing political crisis. 
 
¶3.  In response to ref B demarche, Mr. Dedi Nadje explained 
that currently Cote d'Ivoire exports these types of fish only 
to the EU, and Cote d'Ivoire is in compliance with EU import 
requirements.  He said that Cote d'Ivoire would take careful 
note of ref B requirements should it begin exporting these 
fish to the United States in the future.
