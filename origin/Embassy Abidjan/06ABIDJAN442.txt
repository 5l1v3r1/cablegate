CONFIRMED 
 
 
¶1.  Initial results from several birds found dead in Abidjan 
have tested positive for H5N1 Avian Influenza (AI). Screening 
for the virus was performed by two labs, the Insitut Pasteur 
in Abidjan and in Paris.  Ministry officials are waiting for 
final confirmation from the United Nations Food and 
Agricultural Organization (UNFAO) lab in Padua, Italy before 
they make a public announcement. Emergency meetings of the 
National Committee to Combat Avian Influenza are currently 
underway.  Contacts at the World Health Organization (WHO) 
are expecting positive confirmation from the UNFAO lab in 
Padua. 
 
¶2.  The infected birds were seven chickens, nine ducks and a 
sparrow hawk.  The ducks and chickens were domesticated, and 
it is likely that the sparrow hawk became infected with the 
H5N1 strain after eating one of the diseased birds.  As of 
today, no other outbreaks among domestic or wild bird 
populations have been reported in Cote d'Ivoire.  When 
contacted, the Cabinet Director for the Ministry of Animal 
Production and Fisheries, stated that likely they will 
implement an Abidjan-wide quarantine of the animals for 21 
days.  This action would meet one of U.S. Department of 
Agriculture - Animal and Plant Health and Inspection Services 
recommended standard control measure called zoning.  Zoning 
recommends the quarantine of all birds located in a three 
kilometer surveillance area surrounding the infected site. 
The infected area is in the Marcory/Anoumoubo district of 
Abidjan.  However, the Ministry is thinking of going beyond 
this and implementing zoning control for all of Abidjan.  If 
the Ministry does so, it believes that this would  capture 
all possible infected birds without overly burdening 
commercial activities in areas outside the potential area of 
infection.  An announcement of an Abidjan-wide quarantine is 
likely this evening.  In addition, the Ministry of Animal 
Production and Fish Resources has also reported that its 
agents are in the process of stamping out or destroying any 
diseased poultry found in the immediate area.  In addition, 
the Ministry has ordered the screening of birds and the 
control of the movement of birds within Cote d'Ivoire. 
 
¶3.  The Deputy Director General for Health at the Ministry of 
Health, Dr. Marcel Koffi, contacted the CDC director at post. 
 Dr. Koffi is a member of the National Committee to Combat 
Avian Influenza.  He requested material assistance from the 
United States with regard to the presence of AI in Cote 
d'Ivoire.  USAID has sent 100 personal protection kits, one 
decontamination kit and one outbreak investigation lab kit, 
which are currently en route to Abidjan. The outbreak 
investigation lab kit has the capacity to collect multiple 
samples and is equipped to conduct rapid on-site testing. 
Post will continue to monitor the developing situation 
closely.
