IMPLEMENTATION OBLIGATIONS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 178365 
 
1)  (U)  On October 31, Econ Chief delivered talking points 
from reftel to Ambassador Amidon DIARRA, Director General of 
International Security and Humanitarian Affairs at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
2)  (SBU)  Recognizing the fact that Cote d'Ivoire has not 
yet formally ratified its Chapter VII obligations through 
approval by the National Assembly, DIARRA noted that Cote 
d'Ivoire's political situation complicates that process 
markedly.  The National Assembly is unable to take up 
consideration of legislation, as its mandate officially ended 
at the close of 2005, and elections to replace it have not 
taken place. 
 
3)  (SBU)  The Minister of Foreign Affairs is currently 
exploring with the Office of the Prime Minister whether 
ratification of diplomatic texts, such as mentioned in 
reftel, can be accomplished via Prime Ministerial decrees. 
However, fixing an answer to this question by December 2006, 
as requested in reftel, is unlikely.
