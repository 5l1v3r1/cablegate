SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE:  SUSPECTED CASES OF AVIAN FLU 
 
 
Â¶1. Several birds found dead in Abidjan have been tested at 
the state-owned Institute Pasteur in Abidjan for H5N1 Avian 
Flu. However, officials have not yet confirmed the presence 
of the virus in Cote d'Ivoire. Additional samples were sent 
for testing to a lab in Italy on April 24.  The cases were 
reported in 7 chickens, 9 ducks and a sparrow hawk. An AFP 
press report released April 25 announcing the presence of 
Avian Flu in Abidjan was recalled the same day and the 
Minister of Animal Production and Fish Resources denies that 
the presence of the virus has been confirmed. Post will 
continue to monitor the developing situation.
