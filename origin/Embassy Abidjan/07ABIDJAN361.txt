 ¶1. (SBU)  Ex-rebel leader Guillaume Soro officially took 
over the Premiership Wednesday, April 4 at a ceremony at the 
Prime Minister's compound that included outgoing Prime 
Minister Banny and most of his cabinet.  Soro, who had been 
named Prime Minister on March 29 by presidential decree, said 
that he was "aware of the challenges that lie ahead, and 
promised to work for the success of the Ouagadougou 
agreement."  Banny, who apparently will not be returning to 
the West African Central Bank, BCEAO, called for a 
resurrection of Cote d'Ivoire in final statements and cited 
his work in restoring trust among Ivorians.  He encouraged 
Soro to bring the country to successful elections.  Soro met 
with President Gbagbo on Thursday, April 5 and the two are 
said to have finalized the makeup of the new government. 
Press reports say they have submitted the list to President 
Compaore and the new government will be announced on April 6 
or 7. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT:  Soro has his work cut out for him.  By 
declining to return to the BCEAO, Banny nay be signaling his 
intention to run for President in the next election.  END 
COMMENT
