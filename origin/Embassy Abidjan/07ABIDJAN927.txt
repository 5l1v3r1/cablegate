SUBJECT: COTE D IVOIRE: OUATTARA ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY 
 
 
¶1. (U) Former Ivorian Prime Minister and long-time President 
of the Rassemblement des Republicains (RDR) party Alassane 
Ouattara announced his candidacy for the Ivorian presidential 
election during an August 25 speech in Paris to RDR 
supporters in Europe.  (Note: the date of the election has 
not yet been set. End Note) He promised his audience a 
"better" Cote d Ivoire and assured them that RDR will win the 
next election.  Ouattara said there must be a limit to the 
length of time that the powers of the Chief Executive of Cote 
d Ivoire can be extended. 
 
¶2. (U) Ouattara said the RDR believes in peace, liberty, 
social justice, and solidarity.  He announced that an RDR 
party congress has been scheduled for the end of 2007 and 
noted that the party has 700,000 members in Cote d Ivoire 
with 3,000 chapters and 30,000 local committees.  He 
encouraged RDR party members to get on the electoral rolls. 
 
¶3. (U) Ouattara said RDR members need to work to ensure that 
the election is transparent and in conformity with 
international standards.  Ouattara said the RDR is calling 
for transparency so that "the best will win" and assured his 
supporters that, if the election is transparent, the RDR will 
win. Ouattara said it is important to ensure that all steps 
in the electoral process are certified by a neutral party and 
added that he counts on the good will of Ouagadougou 
Political Accord (OPA) Facilitator and President of Burkina 
Faso Blaise Compaore to ensure the complete transparency of 
the election.  Ouattara lamented the UN Security Council 
decision to eliminate the position of High Representative for 
Elections and said that position "was created in response to 
the complexity of Cote d Ivoires situation."  Ouattara 
described the UN Security Councils decision as a step 
backward by the international community in relation to its 
earlier positions. Ouattara said the United Nations Operation 
in Cote d Ivoire (UNOCI) will inevitably be held responsible 
for any disorder that takes place as a result of a poorly 
organized election. 
 
¶4. (U) Ouattara noted that there are no problems between Cote 
d'Ivoire and France  and invited French citizens who 
"wrongfully" and "disgracefully" had to depart Cote d Ivoire 
to return if they want to. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment.  Ouattaras candidacy is not a surprise. 
It is interesting that he chose to announce it in Paris, 
where he spends a great deal of time, rather than in Cote 
d Ivoire.  Ouattara did not attend the July 30 "Flame of 
Peace" ceremony in Bouake.  The Ivorian political opposition, 
including the RDR, has been sidelined by the OPA.
