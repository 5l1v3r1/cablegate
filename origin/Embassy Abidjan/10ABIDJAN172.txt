SUBJECT: ABIDJAN: EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTEE (EAC) MEETS TO REVIEW 
POST SECURITY FOLLOWING GOVERNMENT SHAKE-UP 
 
¶1. (SBU) The DCM convened the Emergency Action Committee (EAC) on 
Tuesday, February 16, 2010, to review security issues at post 
following the surprise dismissal of the cabinet and the Independent 
Election Commission by President Laurent Gbagbo on the evening of 
Friday, February 12. 
 
 
 
Situation 
 
---------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) EAC members reported that the public's general reaction to 
the dismissals was subdued.  Over the weekend, there were 
spontaneous public demonstrations in Abengourou to the east of the 
capital, in Tafire in the north, and in the Abidjan suburb of 
Yopougon.  Government security forces maintained a high state of 
alert throughout the city, and opposition leaders appeared to be 
disorganized as they did not/not press for any immediate response 
from their followers, despite having initially called for 
demonstrations.  Heavy rains followed by sporadic flooding on 
Sunday further inhibited any reaction by the population.  Embassy 
officers closely monitored the situation throughout the Presidents 
Day weekend, and continue to do so. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) On Monday, 15 February, the consular section cleared and 
issued a warden message to the American community advising them of 
the situation and the potential for spontaneous demonstrations and 
political unrest, reminding citizens that such events can escalate 
into violence.  The same message was passed to direct-hire embassy 
employees via the emergency telephone tree. 
 
 
 
Current Security Posture 
 
------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Over the weekend, post updated the Country Specific 
Information and the Travel Warning and submitted both to the 
Department for approval.  During the EAC, RSO reminded post 
personnel that COM approval for out-of-town travel remains in 
place.  The Management officer noted that because of the current 
electricity shortage, all generators had been checked in the past 
10 days. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The EAC determined that the current security measures and 
procedures in place are appropriate for a country rated critical 
for both potential political violence and for crime.  The RSO noted 
that while the security mechanisms are available and appropriate, a 
Crisis Management Exercise scheduled for later this week via 
Digital Video Conference by the Foreign Service Institute will 
provide post with an occasion to review all procedures in detail.
