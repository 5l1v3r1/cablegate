REF: STATE 20388 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 6, 2009 Econoff contacted Jacqueline Groth 
of the Middle East Regional Development Policy Division, 
Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(BMZ) in Bonn, to confirm German support for the Palestinians 
following the March 2 Donors' Conference in Sharm Al-Sheikh, 
Egypt.  As announced by Foreign Minister Steinmeier, Germany 
will contribute 150 million euros. 
¶2. (SBU) Groth explained that 100 million of the 150 million 
euro pledge would go towards "social infrastructure, 
employment generation and water infrastructure" (i.e., a 
sewage plant in central Gaza).  These funds are primarily 
comprised of pledges made before the Paris Conference in late 
¶2007.  Projects supported with the funds could be 
"re-activated as soon as appropriate framework conditions are 
in place."  Conditions include a "permanent ceasefire, 
regulated reopening of border crossings, and 
inter-Palestinian (sic) reconciliation." 
¶3. (SBU) As for the balance, 13 million euros will cover 
immediate humanitarian aid in 2009, according to Groth.  The 
remaining 37 million euros will be aimed at "reconstruction 
and stabilization of the social situation."  Groth noted that 
the precise allocation of the funds was subject to 
consultations with the Palestinian Authority.  She added that 
Germany envisaged making a "substantial contribution" through 
the European Union's PEGASE mechanism to cover fuel costs for 
the Gaza power station, as well as allocating funds to 
water/sanitation and education projects.  The timing and 
degree to which the projects will be implemented depends on 
the "evolution of the political situation." 
¶4.  (SBU) Poloff also met with MFA Near East Bureau chief 
Boris Ruge on March 5 to discuss reftel.  Ruge,s breakdown 
of the pledged amount tracks that of Groth.  He added that 
Germany,s ability to spend some of the pledged amount would 
depend on the flexibility of Israel regarding access to Gaza 
for various types of goods and materials, including 
reconstruction materials. 
¶5. (U) Econoff and Poloff shared details on the U.S. 
contribution with respective interlocutors, as suggested in 
Reftel.
