SUBJECT: MERKEL GIVES CREDENCE TO BIOPIRACY CLAIMS AHEAD OF CBD 
COP-9 CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  Biodiversity was the theme of the CDU/CSU caucus 
conference of the German Bundestag, held April 9 in Berlin.  In a 
keynote address German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she expects the 
Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) Conference of the Parties (COP-9) 
will send a clear signal on the need to protect biodiversity 
worldwide.  Merkel gave credence to biopiracy concerns, which charge 
that pharmaceutical companies unethically privatize indigenous 
knowledge.  Developing country representatives expressed hope that 
the conference will be the starting point for a "Bonn Protocol" on 
world biodiversity.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  At the CDU/CSU caucus conference of the German Bundestag, 
Chancellor Merkel focused on the importance of forming international 
and national alliances -- comprised of scientific, political, 
private sector, indigenous and local community stakeholders -- for 
the protection of biodiversity.  The goal, she said, should be to 
work for the protection of species that are threatened with 
extinction as the result of human actions.  Merkel said she expects 
that COP-9, which will take place May 19-30 in Bonn, will deliver 
concrete results and programs to help developing countries find 
solutions for problems such deforestation or biopiracy.  The term 
biopiracy refers to the patenting of knowledge and genetic resources 
developed by indigenous communities without authorization by or 
compensation to such groups. 
 
¶3.  The President of the Republic of Madagascar, Marc Ravalomanana, 
said that developing countries are aware of the social and 
economical risks of biodiversity loss. While such countries know 
about the importance of protecting the environment, they often 
cannot afford to do so.  He criticized industrialized countries for 
not doing enough to combat biopiracy and claimed it is immoral to 
patent "their" property -- particularly indigenous biomedical 
knowledge about species -- without compensation to the local groups 
who originally developed such knowledge.  The primary challenge, 
Ravalomanana said, is to make environmental protection economically 
sustainable.  He also pointed out that biodiversity needs a protocol 
similar to the Kyoto Protocol with clear regulatory measures, 
voluntary measures, and economic incentives.  He expressed hope that 
the May conference would be the starting point for a "Bonn Protocol" 
on world biodiversity. 
 
¶4.  Columbian Vice President Francisco Santos and Meena Raman, 
President of Friends of the Earth International, highlighted the 
urgent need to create a regime to distribute generic resources in a 
fair way and, most importantly, to find financial instruments to 
support the protection of biodiversity in developing countries. 
Both spoke against biopiracy, stressing the importance of 
sustainable production, in which no forest is destroyed for the 
profit of "rich" countries. 
 
¶5.  COMMENT:  Merkel will address the High-Level Segment of the 
COP-9 on May 28.  Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel and EU 
Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas will present an "Economics of 
Ecosystems and Biodiversity" report on May 29.  This report is 
modeled after the Stern Review on climate change and will calculate 
the economic costs from dwindling species.
