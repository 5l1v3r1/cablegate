¶1.  (SBU) In response to a Blue Lantern post-shipment check 
on license 050117142, Waffen Schumacher gave satisfactory 
responses to post inquires and the German government 
indicated that Waffen Schumacher is a reliable recipient of 
AR15 components.  Waffen Schumacher said it intended to use 
the U.S. AR15 components in question to assemble complete 
rifles and will only sell/market these rifles to the German 
domestic market. 
 
 
RESPONSE FROM WAFFEN SCHUMACHER 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mr. Markus Wagner of Waffen Schumacher said his 
company, founded in 1989, specializes in the marketing and 
wholesale of firearms/accessories exclusively to the German 
domestic market (licensed German gun dealers) under "strict 
German gun-laws."  He said that his company does in fact 
assemble/manufacture AR15 (sold with the same designation) 
rifles and for this reason seeks to import specialized 
components from South Carolina-based BDL Ltd.  Wagner said 
his company currently imports EO-Tech Red-Dot marksmanship 
sights from the U.S. firm ELITE-Arms in quantities of several 
hundred per year and does not have any distribution 
agreements with U.S. companies. 
 
 
RESPONSE FROM THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The German Federal Office for Export Control (BAFA) 
stated that based on its export control data, Waffen 
Schumacher is a reliable company.  To BAFA's knowledge, 
Waffen Schumacher sells different models of Sabre Defense 
XR-15 self-loading rifles and related accessories such as 
magazines, grips, handguards, stocks, sight mounts etc.  BAFA 
noted that these parts are widely compatible with AR15 parts.
