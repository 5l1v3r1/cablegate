SUBJECT: GERMANY H1N1 FLU UPDATE: 251 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 735, B) Berlin 720 and previous. 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 cases in Germany rose to 
251 on June 19, as twenty-two further infections were 
confirmed.  The majority of newly confirmed cases occurred in 
North Rhine-Westphalia.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On June 19, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its 
press briefing 22 new laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 for 
Germany.  This increases the total number of confirmed cases 
in Germany to 251 (Refs A, B and previous).  The new cases 
were distributed among the federal states as follows: North 
Rhine-Westphalia (18), Hesse (2), Berlin (1), Lower Saxony 
(1), Rhineland-Palatinate (1), and Bavaria (-1). (A previously 
confirmed H1N1 infection in Bavaria was found not to be the 
new flu.) 
 
 
School closings due to H1N1 infection 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Media reports indicate that an entire school class 
in Munich (Bavaria) has been put under quarantine at home this 
week after an 18-year old student in the class tested positive 
for the flu. He reportedly had recently returned from a trip 
to the US. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  In Leer (Lower Saxony), a kindergarten has been 
closed after a female student passed the virus to a female 
teacher. The student had been infected by her 56-year-old 
grandmother, who had recently returned from a trip to the US 
and Mexico. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  A School in Wahnbek (Lower Saxony) was also closed 
after a female teacher was confirmed to be infected with H1N1. 
The case was not connected to the infection in Leer, as the 
teacher had just returned from a trip to Central America. 
 
 
North Rhine-Westphalia shows highest number of infections 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the state showing the 
highest number of infections among all German states with 122 
confirmed cases, followed by Bavaria (36 cases) and Baden- 
Wuerttemberg (26 cases).  The number of cases resulting from 
human-human transmission of the virus inside Germany now sits 
at 131.
