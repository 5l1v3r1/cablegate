REF:  Berlin 1606 and previous 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: From January 2-8, the number of confirmed H1N1 
infections in Germany rose by 1,137 to a total of 216,818 
cases. The number of H1N1 deaths in Germany increased to 178. 
Due to the lack of demand for the H1N1 vaccination, Germany 
has cut its order for the 2009-H1N1 vaccine to 34 million 
doses.  Embassy Berlin's H1N1 vaccination clinics will begin 
during the week of January 18.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) The Influenza Working Group of the Robert Koch 
Institute (RKI) reported on January 13 a total of 1,137 new 
laboratory-confirmed H1N1 cases in Germany from January 2 to 
January 8, increasing the total number of H1N1 cases to 
216,818. The rate of new infections continues to decline. 
Bavaria remains the German state with the highest number of 
confirmed H1N1 cases, with a total of 43,262 - accounting for 
20 percent of all H1N1 infections in Germany - followed by 
Nord Rhine- 
Westphalia (38,324) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (33,013). 
 
¶3. (U) As of January 13, RKI has confirmed the deaths of a 
total of 178 patients due to H1N1.  In 83 percent of the 
deaths, patients were younger than 60 years of age.  In the 
majority of cases, the patients had underlying health 
conditions and were considered to be "risk patients." 
 
Drop In H1N1 Infections, But Second Wave Possible 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) Although the country has experienced a drop in newly- 
registered cases over the past few weeks, experts are 
expecting a second wave of H1N1 infections by late 
January/early February and still call for the public to get 
vaccinated against the new flu. Germany is experiencing a 
"vaccine fatigue" with fewer Germans willing to get the shot. 
 
¶5. (U)  Due to the German population's declining interest in 
receiving the H1N1 vaccination , all 16 federal states opened 
talks with the British vaccine manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline 
(GSK) at the beginning of January to discuss the possibility 
of cancelling half of the 50 million doses of H1N1 vaccine 
that were ordered.  On January 12, GSK agreed to amend the 
existing contract.  Germany will now receive approximately 70 
percent of the ordered vaccine, equivalent to 34 million 
doses.  Media reports indicate that this will save Germany 133 
million Euros. 
 
H1N1 Vaccine Clinics 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Embassy Berlin has received a shipment of 400 doses of 
the H1N1 vaccine.  The H1N1 nasal spray and injection are 
available for individuals aged 6 months and above.  H1N1 
vaccinations clinics for the Embassy community will begin in 
Berlin during the week of January 19.  At its January 13 
meeting, Mission Germany's Pandemic Influenza Working Group 
decided to meet on a monthly basis due to the decrease in H1N1 
cases.
