¶1. (SBU) We assess BHV Aviation Consultants GmbH is in 
compliance with USML controls and a reliable 
recipient/handler of USML items in regards to Blue Lantern 
end-use check 050171972; the export of aviation equipment for 
use with Mi117 helicopters to the Czech Republic.  BHV 
Aviation Consultants CEO, Nadir D'Afganistan, provided 
EconOff with written response to ref inquiries, ISO 
certification from the German Accreditation Council, and 
faxed export license information from Transaero Inc. (ref B). 
 The Embassy independently verified with a Rheinland-Pfalz 
district court that BHV Aviation Consultants GmbH has valid 
registration as a German enterprise. 
 
 
ABOUT BHV AVIATION CONSULTANTS GMBH 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BHV Aviation Consultants GmbH, has been a business 
registered under German law since 2001 and specializes in the 
distribution of safety and survival equipment.  They 
distribute mainly helmets, oxygen masks, distress markers, 
immersion suits, and life vests.  D'Afganistan said his 
company limits sales to EU countries and their normal 
customers are EU militaries and local law enforcement 
agencies. 
 
 
RELATIONSHIP WITH TRANSAERO, GLOMEX, AND CZECH MOD 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) D'Afganistan said BHV has served as a European 
supplier for Transaero Inc. since 2003 and supplied EconOff 
with export license documentation (ref B) for this 
transaction detailing the relationship between TransaeroInc., 
BHV Aviation Consultants GmbH, Glomex MS, and the Czech 
Republic MOD.  D'Afganistan said the Czech MOD normally only 
issues orders with locally approved companies of which Glomex 
MS is an approved Czech MOD supplier.  D'Afganistan affirmed 
that his company is not/not paying Glomex MS any 
commissions/fees nor is BHV Aviation receiving any 
commissions/fees for this transaction. 
 
 
SITE SECURITY FOR USML ITEMS 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) D'Afganistan emphasized that the items received 
from Transaero Inc. in this transaction are neither 
significant military items nor classified equipment.  He said 
the items will likely remain in BHV's warehouse before being 
shipped to the end-user or intermediate consignee and 
affirmed that BHV's storage facilities are both 
electronically and mechanically secured.  D'Afganistan also 
pointed out that his company is a current supplier to the 
German military and their warehouse is approved by the German 
Office for Weapons Technology and Procurement (BWB). 
D'Afganistan said he is familiar with USG regulations 
governing the import of US-origin defense articles. 
 
 
VERIFICATION WITH GERMAN AUTHORITIES 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) EconOff checked with the German Ministry of 
Economics (BMWi), Federal Office for Export Control (BAFA) 
and local courts to verify the legitimacy of BHV Aviation 
Consultants GmbH as a German enterprise and exporter of 
defense related items.  Neither BMWi nor  BAFA had any record 
of BHV Aviation Consultants GmbH; however, this is not 
surprising as BHV Aviation would likely not have needed any 
export control licenses for the items they distribute.  On 
July 23, EconOff verified with the Rheinland-Pfalz District 
Court Montabaur that BHV Aviation Consultants GmbH is 
registered as an enterprise under German law (registration 
number HRB 20704).  In addition, the supplied ISO 
accreditation (ref B) from the German Accreditation Council 
further supports BHV's legitimacy.
