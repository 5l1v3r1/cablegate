¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA Deputy 
Director for the Balkans Marc Bogdahn on November 18 and 
had a follow-on conversation with MFA Bosnia desk officer 
Michael Geisler on November 20.  Geisler -- who had just 
returned from the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) meeting 
in Sarajevo -- assured us that Germany would maintain its 
current level of troops (about 130 ) in EUFOR ALTHEA. 
Moreover, he said that German officials had impressed upon 
new 
FM Westerwelle and new DefMin zu Guttenberg the importance of 
keeping EUFOR troops in Bosnia. 
 
¶2. (SBU) However, Geisler emphasized that the EU as a whole 
had made no decision yet on the future of ALTHEA.  He said 
Germany has been engaged bilaterally with EU partners to 
discourage the unilateral withdrawal of troops from Bosnia. 
However, it was too early to gauge whether these efforts 
would be successful.  Geisler underscored Germany's position 
that the EUFOR mandate should continue to be extended until 
the closure of the Office of the High Representative (OHR).
