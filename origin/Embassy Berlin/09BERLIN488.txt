PREPARATIONS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 41768 
 
¶1.  (SBU) German media reported on April 27 that three 
Germans -- two men who recently returned from Mexico and a 
woman -- have been quarantined in the western city of 
Bielefeld after exhibiting swine flu-like symptoms. 
Preliminary tests on two of the patients did not support 
suspicions of swine flu, but both will remain in isolation, 
pending the results of additional tests.  At present, no 
further information is available on the third case. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Mission Germany Pandemic Influenza Working 
Group (PIWG) will meet by DVC on April 28, at 1400 local 
time, where they will review existing Mission tripwires for 
adequacy and completeness, discuss current posture and 
application of the no double standard policy, and ask open 
questions of the Health Unit. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mission Health Unit has confirmed adequate supplies 
of personal protective equipment (PPE) and antiviral 
medications.  Health Unit will increase surveillance for flu 
symptoms in the Mission and report regularly to 
STATE/MED/DASHO.  Mission Germany has reopened lines of 
communication with the local Berlin health authorities. We 
have also confirmed that the Robert Koch Institute, the 
German government-sponsored research institution charged with 
protecting public health and monitoring infectious diseases, 
will post situation reports and updates on their website 
http://www.rkL.de (German only). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Our contacts at the Agriculture Ministry (BMELV) 
tell us that they view this outbreak as a human, rather than 
animal, disease outbreak.  That said, Germany has not imposed 
any trade restrictions in reaction to the swine flu outbreaks 
among humans in Mexico or the US.  They also indicated that 
veterinary issues are coordinated within the context of the 
EU, suggesting that Germany is unlikely to put any trade 
restrictions in place without EU Directives.
