GICNT'S FUTURE WITHIN G-8, G-20 
 
REF: STATE 83550 
 
¶1.  (U)  Econoff delivered reftel points to German MFA desk 
officer Dr. Bernd Rinnert.  Russian MFA First Secretary 
Dmitry Cherkaschin also attended.  Rinnert thanked Econoff 
for the information. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Rinnert wondered aloud how the GICNT fits into the 
G-20 as it overtakes the G-8 and, presumably, the G-8 Global 
Partnership Against the Spread of Nuclear Weapons and 
Materials of Mass Destruction.  He stated that the G-20 
members have fewer overlapping common interests than the G-8 
members.  As an example, he stated that Saudi Arabia (as a 
G-20 member) has less interest in Russia's nuclear program 
than the G-8 members.  He likened the potential difficulties 
in gaining consensus on issues in the expanded G-20 forum to 
those experienced in the EU after its expansion to 27 members.
