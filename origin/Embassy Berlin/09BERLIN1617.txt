¶1.    Lead Stories Summary 
 
ARD-TV's Tagesschau and ZDF-TV's Heute opened with stories on the 
idea of increasing contributions to the unemployment insurance fund 
in 2011.  Frankfurter Allgemeine ("Coalition of like-minded for 
climate protection?") and Sueddeutsche ("Germany exceeds Kyoto 
climate goals") led with stories on climate protection.  Frankfurter 
Rundschau focused on the airstrikes in Kunduz.  Editorials focused 
on financial topics, Serbia's EU bid, and climate change, and the 
German debate on Afghanistan. 
 
¶2.    Serbian EU Bid 
 
Under the headline "The long way to the West," Tagesspiegel 
editorialized: "Recent years have made clear that it is worthwhile 
to lure particularly this country into the EU.  With every little 
step towards the West, Serbian nationalists have lost support.  Even 
the separation of Kosovo has not revived radical forces and did not 
divide the country.  Serbia is becoming more stable, and so does its 
neighborhood." 
 
Die Welt opined: "Croatia, Albania, Macedonia, Turkey - and now also 
the country whose former government is responsible for the war in 
the Balkans?  Not to speak of the fact that war criminal Ratko 
Mladic is still at large, although his extradition has always been a 
condition for EU entry talks.  Although talks are still a long way 
off, the people are already looking towards Southeastern Europe with 
some displeasure...  With Serbia, a country would enter the EU that 
has not yet overcome socialism and the war." 
 
Frankfurter Rundschau headlined "Serbia belongs in the West," and 
wrote in an analysis:  "Much speaks in favor for a quick entry of 
the country into the EU.  Both need each other economically and 
politically...  The region's economic integration and Bosnia's 
stability are reasons for a speedy accession of Serbia.  The 
beginning of entry talks would open up three more EU funds to Serbia 
with some 250 million Euros annually.  The money would be 
well-invested.  The fact that the war criminal Mladic has not been 
caught yet and that the status of Kosovo is still unclear, does not 
speak against Serbia's quick integration." 
 
¶3.   Climate Change 
 
Frankfurter Allgemeine editorialized: "The shock of the failure of 
the Copenhagen conference on climate change was so great that the 
reasons for it have not been analyzed.  Especially the German 
government does not want to blame anyone in particular, in order not 
 to fall out with the Chinese, the Africans or the Americans prior 
to the upcoming negotiations in Bonn.  An honest critique would have 
to focus on the Europeans...  By convincing themselves that they are 
to blame for the disappearance of Tuvalu, they provoked many 
countries in the world to make unreasonable compensation demands. 
The Europeans provided a perfect excuse for the emerging countries 
to wash their hands of the process." 
 
Sueddeutsche opined: "China has successfully torpedoed the 
international climate conference.  It is important to state this.... 
 Not only in absolute figures is China the greatest emitter of 
greenhouse gases.  Beijing's defensive lie that the Chinese only 
produce a fifth of the emissions per capita compared with the 
Americans is fading away as quickly as the glaciers of Tibet.  The 
per capita emissions along the developed coastlines of China are 
 
BERLIN 00001617  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
growing rapidly.  As a result, China's argument that it is only a 
little sinner, will be hot air in a few years....  The role China 
played in Copenhagen will hopefully have consequences.  The country, 
which presents itself increasingly self-confidently to the world, 
must bear more responsibility than in the past." 
 
Die Welt commented: "The friends and allies of the U.S. must be 
aware of the fact that the obstructive Senate is tying Obama's 
hands, while the rest of the world needs the U.S. to take action. 
Concerning climate protection, the reduction of the national debt, 
disarmament and the war, Republicans can and will do everything to 
prevent the government from taking action....  The balance of 
President Obama's legislative record is therefore meager." 
 
¶4.     Lithuania -- CIA Covert Prisons 
 
Frankfurter Allgemeine editorialized: "Lithuania approached the 
question of whether the CIA operated covert prisons on its territory 
quicker and more effectively than Poland and Romania, which were 
under suspicion already years ago.  This is good, although the 
investigation report does not answer all questions.  Lithuania's 
diligence had several reasons: it wanted to rescue its good 
reputation and there was also a domestic power struggle.  However, 
President Grybauskaite and Prime Minister Kubilius emphasized that 
it was about the fundamental question whether, even in the lethal 
fight of terrorism, democratic states must require intelligence 
services to obey the law.  Lithuanians are sensitive about this 
issue, because they know where this led in Moscow." 
 
¶5.     Afghanistan 
 
Sueddeutsche Zeitung noted on the SPD's attempt to change its policy 
on Afghanistan: "Concerning its policy on Afghanistan, the SPD is 
carrying a heavy burden.  It includes the unqualified solidarity 
former Chancellor Schroeder promised to the U.S. after the attacks 
on September 11, 2001, former Defense Minister Struck's statement 
that Germany's security is defended in Afghanistan, and Steinmeier's 
role as a leading minister responsible for the mission in the 
country.   If Afghanistan is at war, then it also is the war of the 
SPD.  It does not come as a surprise that the Social Democrats are 
uncomfortable in this position.  The mission in Afghanistan is 
unpopular and many in the SPD are longing for presenting themselves 
to voters again as a party of peace.  It suits the picture that SPD 
Chairman Gabriel has responded to this, quicker and more loudly than 
the party's parliamentary leader." 
 
Berliner Zeitung analyzed Defense Minister zu Guttenberg's proposal 
to start talks with some groups of the insurgents: "If you cannot 
defeat your enemy within eight years, you are well advised to meet 
for a cup of tea. The fact that zu Guttenberg is now ready to do 
this, shows that he has learned a lesson." 
 
Stuttgarter Zeitung commented:  "Concerning the U.S. desire to 
increase the German contingent, more honesty would be good.  There 
are increasing suggestions indicating a new ceiling.  However, the 
government quells any debate by referring to the London conference 
on Afghanistan at the end of January.  Are essential details being 
kept secret again and will the Bundestag be exploited to simply pass 
the mandate?  Such an approach would result in serious damage to 
Germany's democratic culture."
