¶1. (SBU) Refs B and D requested post assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 05-948922 for export of 
unclassified components and spare parts to the NATO E-3A 
 
SIPDIS 
AWACS Component Logistics Wing in Geilenkirchen, Germany. 
The reason for the request was U.S. law enforcement entities 
have recently investigated one of the sources in this 
transaction for diversion of sensitive defense articles. 
Accordingly, it was necessary to confirm the continued 
delivery of multiple shipments of components, parts, 
accessories, attachments, and associated equipment in support 
of NATO E-3A AWACS aircraft fleet.  Reftels also requested 
confirmation that no Significant Military Equipment (SME) has 
been shipped, as stipulated by provisos attached to the 
license. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 16, LTC Richard Roberts (USAF), Supply 
Squadron Commander at the NATO E-3A Component in 
Geilenkirchen contacted emboffs to confirm receipt of 
multiple shipments of components and spare parts, 
accessories, attachments, and associated equipment from 
Northrop Grumman-LTSI under license 05-948922.  Roberts 
e-mailed us a multiple sheet listing of shipments confirming 
receipt of ordered materials and said he was unaware of any 
problems in terms of nondelivery, missing shipments, or 
delivery of non-ordered goods.  Roberts also confirmed that 
no SME had been shipped, as per license provisos.  Post 
forwarded LTC Roberts' e-mail to PM/DTCC Blue Lantern 
Coordinator.
