SUBJECT: SPD WINS BERLIN ELECTION; OUTCOME REFLECTS LOCAL 
FACTORS 
 
REF: BERLIN 2546 
 
¶1. (U) As widely expected, Berlin's SPD won the Sept. 17 
state election, taking 30.9 percent of the vote, up slightly 
since the 2001 election.  The SPD will have the option of 
forming a government with either the Left Party.PDS or the 
Greens, both of which took just over 13 percent of the vote. 
Either coalition will have only a one-vote majority in the 
Berlin legislature.  Before the election, Mayor Wowereit 
(SPD) had indicated a preference for renewing the coalition 
with the Left Party.PDS.  The conservative Christian 
Democrats, led by Defense State Secretary Friedbert Pflueger, 
performed poorly, taking only 21.2 percent, down slightly 
from 2001.  Likewise, the liberal Free Democrats also lost 
votes, taking only 7.6 percent. 
 
¶2. (U) The poll was marked by a very low turnout of only 59 
percent of voters and by the high percent of the vote (nearly 
14) given to parties which did not clear the 5 percent hurdle 
for entry into parliament.  The latter enables the SPD to 
gain a majority of seats with either the LP.PDS or Greens, 
despite having under 45 percent of the popular vote with 
either party.  In addition, the far-right NPD performed 
slightly better than expected, gaining seats in four Berlin 
district assemblies, including one in the west. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment: Though the NPD performed slightly better than 
expected in some districts, city-wide the party fell far 
below the five percent hurdle for election to the state 
parliament.  The election should also not be seen as a 
referendum on the national government or Chancellor Merkel. 
Local factors, especially CDU internal weaknesses and the CDU 
mayoral candidate's lack of personal appeal, more than 
account for the CDU's poor result.  End Comment.
