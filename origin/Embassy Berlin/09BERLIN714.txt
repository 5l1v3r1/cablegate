¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The number of H1N1 cases in Germany rose 
to 172 on June 15, as fifty-six more people were confirmed to 
be infected with the new virus over the weekend.  The day also 
brought the first confirmed H1N1 case in Berlin.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On June 15, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its 
press briefing fifty-six new laboratory-confirmed cases of 
H1N1 in Germany.  This increases the total number of confirmed 
cases in Germany to 172.  The new cases were distributed among 
the federal states as follows: North Rhine-Westphalia (45), 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (2), Brandenburg (1), Hesse (3), Bavaria 
(2), Saxony (1) and Lower-Saxony (2). 
 
 
Rapid Increase in Infections 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Following the cases noted in Ref A, RKI reported 
five new cases on June 12, raising that day's tally to 116. 
The rate of infections rapidly increased over the weekend, 
spiking with 52 new cases on June 13 and increasing the number 
of infections to 168.  Four more cases were confirmed on 
Monday, June 15, raising the total cases to 172. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The majority of new confirmed cases in North Rhine- 
Westphalia involve children at the Japanese international 
school in Duesseldorf (Ref A, B) who tested positive for H1N1 
last week.  As reported in Ref B, the school has been 
temporarily closed to minimize the risk of further 
transmission to other children.  The media also reported about 
a 33-year old man from Cottbus (Brandenburg) who was confirmed 
to have the virus. He reportedly returned from a trip to the 
US with flu-like symptoms at the beginning of June.  Health 
officials from Brandenburg report that he and his family are 
under quarantine at home. 
 
 
First H1N1 case in Berlin 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The State Laboratory Berlin-Brandeburg (LLBB) 
confirmed over the weekend a 23-year old woman from Treptow- 
Koepenick (Berlin) to be infected with the virus.  The woman 
returned from a trip to Duesseldorf over the weekend and 
showed flu-like symptoms. She had not traveled outside the 
country.  She went to the hospital Saturday in Berlin, where 
the virus was detected.  Media report that the woman and her 
family are under quarantine at home, with a mild course of the 
virus.  This represents the first confirmed case of H1N1 for 
the Federal State of Berlin. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The Berlin Senate for Health, Environment and 
Consumer confirmed on June 15 that the state has antiviral 
medication to treat 20% of its population (680,000 units). 
Despite the relatively low number of confirmed cases in the 
capital city, health officials from the Berlin Senate have 
advised the population to start buying mouth protection masks.
