REF: STATE 66250 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU)  German Finance Ministry Officer Kristina Wogatzki 
confirmed to Econoff that her ministry is already aware of 
the reftel request and that the GOG is reviewing the next 
steps through its interagency process.  When informed that 
the Embassy had also delivered reftel points to the German 
MFA, Wogatzki said that this should make the process go more 
smoothly, as now that Ministry is also explicitly aware of 
the U.S. position.  While the exact measures Germany will 
take are not yet known, Germany, she said, intends to comply 
with UNSCR 1874 and that she believes that Germany is 
preparing to "make a strong response" to the UNSCR's call for 
expanded financial measures against the DPRK.  While the 
recent Financial Agency Task Force (FATF) meeting discussed 
UNSCR 1874, Wogatzki said that Germany did not want a FATF 
position on the resolution, as Germany feared this would have 
resulted in a "watered down" response. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Wogatzki also noted that Japan has been, in this 
case, more forward-leaning on financial sanctions than she 
had ever seen before, in sharp contrast to what she said is 
Japan's usual position.
