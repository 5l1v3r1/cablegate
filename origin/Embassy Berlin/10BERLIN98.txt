¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  German private donations for victims of the 
January 12 earthquake in Haiti have reached 86 million euros. 
 A televised fundraiser on January 19 was responsible for 
over 20 million euros of the total.  While private donations 
are less than at a similar point following the 2004 Asian 
tsunami, the number and variety of appeals for donations are 
similar.  German individuals, companies and organizations all 
over the country are getting involved, not only by donating 
money but also by sending emergency personnel, supplies and 
equipment to Haiti.  Official relief assistance by the German 
government recently increased to 15 million euros.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
GERMANS OPEN THEIR WALLETS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) According to the German Central Institute for Social 
Issues (DZI), Germans had by January 22 contributed 86 
million euros in private donations to victims of the 
earthquake in Haiti via at least 50 different humanitarian 
organizations, donor groups and internet portals.  DZI 
reports that at least 15 organizations have contributed over 
1 million euros each.  The largest intake came from a 
televised fundraiser sponsored by the German television 
station ZDF and Bild newspaper, which pulled in 20.1 million 
euros in just 24 hours.  Other major contributors include: 
Gemeinsam fuer Menschen in Not -- Entwicklung Hilft (12.9 
million euros); the German Red Cross (7.8 million euros); 
Deutsche Welthungerhilfe (7.2 million euros); Aktion 
Deutschland Hilft (5 million euros); and the German branch of 
Medecins sans Frontieres (5 million euros).  Although private 
donations are currently less than at a similar point 
following the 2004 Asian tsunami -- when they stood at 330 
million -- the number and variety of appeals for donations 
are similar, according to DZI.  (Note: Germans eventually 
contributed a total of 670 million euros in private donations 
toward tsunami relief efforts, and 350 million euros 
following the 2002 floods in Germany.) 
 
ALL HANDS ON DECK 
----------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Examples of engagement can be found all over Germany. 
The ZDF-Bild televised fundraiser for victims of the January 
12 earthquake in Haiti, called "A Heart of Children," 
attracted a wide variety of donors, including some Mission 
contacts.  Congen Frankfurt reports that Karl-Erivan Haub and 
his family-owned food retailer Tengelmann Group donated 1 
million euros, screw manufacturer Wuerth Company contributed 
500,000 euros, and SAP founder Dietmar Hopp gave 100,000 
euros.  The Global Markets Equity Team of Deutsche Bank 
(based in the United States) donated the proceeds of its 
January 15 trading activities, which came to $4 million. 
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank is also matching employee 
donations for Haiti.  The city of Freiburg, Suedwestrundfunk 
radio station, the Deutscher Caritasverband charity 
association and the Badische Zeitung newspaper have launched 
their own donation drive for earthquake victims, called 
"Suedbaden Hilft" (southern Baden help).  Other private 
organizations in and around Freiburg have also started 
collecting donations, such as the Central Market Hall in 
Freiburg and the Mercure Hotel in Herdern. 
 
¶4. (U) ConGen Dusseldorf reports that the government of North 
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) has launched its own fundraising 
drive, dubbed "North Rhine-Westphalia Helps Haiti," with 
Minister President Juergen Ruettgers at the helm.  The drive 
has chosen 10 groups to which it will contribute, and will 
split the donations evenly among them.  The NRW government 
has already contributed 300,000 euros from its own coffers, 
and has sent a planeload of relief goods to Haiti.  On a 
smaller scale, the Dusseldorf Consular Corps is donating 
10,000 euros to Haitian earthquake victims.

¶5. (U) ConGen Leipzig reports that Saxony's Social Minister 
Christine Clauss has taken the lead for the German Red 
Cross's fundraising drive for Haiti.  She has called on 
Germans to give generously, noting that those in her area 
have first-hand experience with natural disasters (i.e., the 
2002 flood).  Saxony's cabinet will decide on a state 
contribution to Haiti on January 26.  On a less grandiose 
scale, the local Lion's Club has donated 500 euros to Haiti. 
The Mayor of Markkleeberg, outside Leipzig, used a recent 
reception to encourage donations -- there was a cash 
collection box as well as information available about 
donating through other organizations. 
 
¶6. (U) Congen Hamburg has reported on several grassroots 
efforts in support of Haiti underway.  Gymnasium Eppendorf 
High School students raised 5000 euros, and are working on a 
plan to raise another 50,000 euros, possibly through a jump 
rope contest.  Nico Gilbert, owner of a Kiel-based 
advertising firm, has initiated a campaign including 16 local 
businesses, which will contribute a share of their revenues 
over time.  The Werder Bremen football club has donated 
150,000 euros.  Archbishop Werner Thissen asked Catholics in 
the Archdiocese of Hamburg to donate for the victims of the 
Haiti earthquake, and the Protestant church in 
Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg has likewise appealed for 
donations.  Radio Hamburg and other stations belonging to the 
RTL Group, and Lower Saxony's Radio FFN have encouraged 
listeners to donate to Haiti.  On a tour of Germany, the New 
York Gospel Stars gave a benefit concert in Glueckstadt; 
revenues and other donations will go towards a Haiti relief 
bank account. 
 
¶7. (U) Bavarians are also rising to the occasion. ConGen 
Munich reports that the K-9 unit Rettungshundestaffel 
Bayerwald traveled to Haiti to assist with search and rescue 
operations.  The Kaufbeuren organization Humedica sent three 
medical teams to Haiti, and shipped 100 tons of relief goods. 
 The Hallbergmoos-based charity organization NAVIS has 
installed a field hospital and drinking water device in 
Haiti.  The Diedorf-based Bavarian Red Cross transported a 
complete mobile hospital to Haiti with two inflatable 
operating rooms, capable of treating up to 250,000 people 
over the next 4-6 weeks.  The Bavarian dioceses of Bamberg, 
Wuerzburg, Passau and Eichstaett each donated 20,000 euros to 
earthquake victims, while Munich-Freising gave 100,000 euros. 
 Finally, the FC Bayern and VfL Wolfsburg football clubs will 
play a charity match to benefit Haiti, taking place in 
Wolfsburg some time in the next six months.  The main 
sponsors of both clubs -- Audi for FC Bayern and Volkswagen 
for VfL Wolfsburg -- are joining forces to donate 1 million 
euros together. 
 
¶8. (U) Berliners have also been active in fundraising efforts 
for Haitian earthquake victims.  A benefit concert is taking 
place at the Berlin Philharmonic on January 25, with proceeds 
supporting the organization Buendnis Entwicklung Hilft.  A 
German Red Cross field hospital, currently operating in 
Port-au-Prince, was sent from Berlin, and a second field 
hospital is reportedly on its way.  Even local Boy Scout 
troops are doing small fundraising activities, according to 
Mission contacts. 
 
¶9. (U) Official German government relief assistance to Haiti 
following the earthquake recently increased to 15 million 
euros.  (NOTE: Details will be reported septel.) 
 
¶10. (U) MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
