REF: STATE 43799 
 
¶1. (U) PolOff delivered Ref A points to MFA Iraq Desk 
Director Dr. Ruediger Lotz May 7.  Lotz noted that Germany 
would again participate in the International Compact with 
Iraq (ICI) Ministerial in Stockholm.  Due to scheduling 
reasons, FM Steinmeier will likely not attend, but State 
Secretary Silberberg will lead the German delegation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lotz noted that Germany shares similar goals with 
the U.S. and is prepared to provide additional technical 
expertise to Iraq if requested.  He continued that a positive 
step would be if Iraq were to arrive at the conference ready 
to provide input and information to the international 
community regarding specific programs and economic 
development projects, allowing interested partners to respond 
positively. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Lotz highlighted the success of the opening of the 
German Embassy Field Office in Erbil and his hopes to expand 
that office to a full consulate in the future.  He also 
expressed interest in exploring the option of starting a 
sister city or brother university program between German and 
Iraqi institutions.
