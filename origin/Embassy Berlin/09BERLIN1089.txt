Germany Reports First Severe Case of H1N1 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  The first severe case of H1N1 was reported on 
September 1 in NRW.  A 35-year old man was reportedly in 
intensive care at the university hospital in Bonn after being 
infected with H1N1. Media reports indicated that the man had 
some pre-existing medical conditions.  The man was treated 
with Tamiflu.  Hospital officials told the media on September

reported that there are no traces of the virus left in his 
body, but said the patient will remain in the hospital for the 
next few days until full recovery.
