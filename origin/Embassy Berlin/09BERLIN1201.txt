¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 infections in 
Germany rose by 175 cases over the weekend to a total of 
20,068 on September 28.  Germany reported its first suspected 
H1N1 death.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U)  At its September 28 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 175 new (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) H1N1 cases in Germany over the weekend, increasing 
the total number of H1N1 cases to 20,068.  New cases were 
distributed among the eleven federal states as follows: 
Bavaria (47), North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) (22), Baden- 
Wuerttemberg (21), Brandenburg (17), Lower-Saxony (13), Hesse 
(15), Thuringia (13), Saxony-Anhalt (13) and Rhineland- 
Palatinate (8), Schleswig-Holstein (5) and Bremen (1). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, only 45 of the total 175 new cases 
are attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New 
cases include non-laboratory H1N1 cases that exhibited 
symptoms after being in contact with a laboratory-confirmed 
infected person. 
 
¶4. (U)  NRW remains the German state with the highest number 
of confirmed virus cases with a total of 5,750,  followed by 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (3,072 cases) and  Lower-Saxony (2,734). 
The number of all confirmed infections in Germany that have 
resulted from domestic transmission is 30 percent. 
 
 
First German H1N1 Death 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  According to information from RKI, a 36-year old woman 
from Gelsenkirchen (North Rhine-Westphalia) is the first 
person in Germany to die from the virus. She died on September 
25 from what appear to be complications from the H1N1 virus. 
The woman was considered a "risk patient" in a hospital in 
Essen and had underlying health conditions (diabetes, 
overweight, smoker, lung problems).  According to RKI, H1N1 
was found in her blood and is considered a factor in her 
death.  RKI sought to reassure the public that there is no 
need to panic, clarifying that in Germany, 8,000 to 11,000 
patients die every year from seasonal influenza.
