¶1.   Lead Stories 
 
Primetime newscast and most papers opened with the festivities 
celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the wall. 
Frankfurter Allgemeine headlined: "Festivity of Freedom and 
Unity-the world was watching Berlin."  Business dailies led with 
stories on the rapidly recovering German economy.  Editorials 
focused on the anniversary of the fall of the Wall. 
 
¶2.   20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Wall 
 
German editorials focused almost exclusively today on the state of 
the German reunification and on what November 9 meant to Germans. 
However, Tagesspiegel noted in a front-page editorial that "the 
repercussions of the fall of the Wall on the minds of so many people 
throughout the world make clear that the desire for change and 
freedom is ongoing." 
 
Westdeutsche Zeitung remarked: "It is high time that we develop a 
culture commemorating the happiest day of our recent history that 
allows future generations to experience the struggle for freedom, 
which did not end with the peaceful fall of the Wall.  Let's hope 
that this revolution, which began with the courage of Solidarnosc in 
Poland and ended with the transformation of a world order is finally 
appropriately recognized in history lessons.  Maybe the biggest 
mistake in the process that brought about German unity was that its 
creators did not dare to make November 9 a national holiday....  It 
would be good to feel encouraged by the revolution in 1989 and to 
understand that our freedom is not a given....  In a time in which 
our excitement for democracy and the European integration is fading 
because of the difficulties arising from a globalized world and the 
economic crisis, those Germans who risked everything for their 
freedom should be a model." 
 
On its front page, Frankfurter Allgemeine opined: "Two decades after 
the fall of the Wall, Germans seem to be even more moved by what 
Chancellor Merkel described as the happiest day in recent German 
history.  Many have tears in their eyes.  There is no doubt that 
November 9  turned into Germany's secret national holiday.  It was 
not made the official one because many politicians and intellectuals 
believed the date also stands for a dark chapter in Germany's past. 
The list of darkness spans from the November revolution after WWI 
and the Hitler Ludendorff coup to the Night of the Broken Glass 
pogrom of 1938....  For 20 years, November 9 has no longer just been 
a day of national shame, but also one of national joy and, for East 
Germans, a day of justified pride.  No other day epitomizes the lows 
and highs of Germany's past better than November 9." 
 
Mass tabloid Bild editorialized: "The peaceful November revolution 
was a great turning point in the history of mankind.  We still have 
tears of joy in our eyes.  Thanks to all those politicians in east 
and west who place the will of the people above their ideologies and 
careers.  Gorbachev risked much.  Thanks to all politicians whose 
heart was beating for freedom.  They took to the streets with the 
people and forged an alliance with them that united Germany and 
Europe.  The will of the people and the farsightedness of 
politicians have made us happy.  A good future can be build upon 
this alliance of happiness." 
 
Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio notes: "The mental differences between 
the East and the West are still substantial.   The economic 
imbalance is not the only reason for it.  We still have not gotten 
 
BERLIN 00001420  002 OF 003 
 
 
used to each other, and are suspicious of each other.  Those on the 
other side still appear to be strangers.  This is difficult to 
explain.  However, this has also to do with the disappointed 
expectations and the disillusionment that quickly arose after 1989. 
Not just the East has changed, also the West's piece and quiet has 
gone.  However, despite these difficulties, this day can be 
celebrated.  The wind of freedom blew from the East, also to the 
benefit of the West." 
 
¶3.   OEF Offensive in Kunduz 
 
Berliner Zeitung editorialized: "We slowly get the feeling that the 
German soldiers in Afghanistan no longer fight for our security but 
are there to defend themselves.  It is even worse: given that they 
no longer manage to do this, American troops help out with small but 
robust offensives against the Taliban, like in recent days in the 
province of Kunduz.  The German army did not want to participate and 
would not have been allowed to do so under its current mandate. 
This raises the questions: why is the Bundeswehr there?   After the 
ousting of the Taliban politicians supported the mission by saying 
that it is about the political and economic reconstruction of the 
country, noting that without military security there could be no 
civilian development.  While the reconstruction got stuck and 
democracy became an illusion in recent years, the security situation 
significantly deteriorated.   As a result, the armed protection must 
be increased, also where the Bundeswehr is deployed.  The German 
army lacks the equipment as well as the mandate to do this-and 
certainly the support of the people.  Before the soldiers plunge 
into an endless civil war, politicians must decide what the Germans 
can achieve in Afghanistan apart from fighting a war." 
 
¶4.    GM/Opel 
 
Sueddeutsche headlined "Friendly Tones from Detroit," and 
editorialized: "Those who believed that the haggling over the future 
of the ailing Opel carmaker has come to an end must rethink.  After 
the stopped sale of Opel to Magna the fight is only getting started. 
If it is correct what the analysts of Moody's found, GM is facing a 
giant challenge.  The restructuring of the German subsidiary could 
cost as much as five billion euros.   This is money that the U.S. 
group that exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July will 
hardly have.  The recent visit of GM CEO Henderson is therefore 
particularly one thing: a charm offensive.   Apart from GM's plans, 
this is also about the contribution the German government and other 
countries are willing to make to the Opel factories.  Those who 
followed the Opel saga in recent months know what is coming next. 
It will be about subsidies, jobs, keeping plants and national 
interests.  Although it sounds different at the moment, the German 
government will find it difficult to refuse giving GM the same 
assistance it promised Magna recently.  However, the government is 
warned.  The company from across the ocean demonstrated only last 
week that its position can change over night.  For GM, its not about 
Opel or jobs.  GM cares particularly about itself. The government 
should take this into account and examine carefully whether GM's 
plans are sustainable." 
 
¶5.    Top EU Jobs 
 
Sueddeutsche reported under the headline "Milliband's withdrawal," 
that "the British foreign secretary does not want a top EU job," 
adding: "In the race for the top EU jobs, one of the favorite 
candidates has given up shortly before reaching the goal....  Former 
British Prime Minster Blair, however, still desires to become the 
first Council president....  Blair called several of his former 
colleges in European capitals over the last weekend." 
 
Handelsblatt headlined "Appointing top jobs in EU is being 
postponed" and highlighted: "the decision-making over new top EU

jobs is getting difficult.  Eastern Europeans are now making 
claims."
