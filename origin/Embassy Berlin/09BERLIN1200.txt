¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: Following a September 18 meeting of Mission 
Germany's Pandemic Influenza Working Group (PIWG), Mission 
Germany remains under tripwire two.  A core group of PIWG 
members will begin meeting biweekly as we head into the flu 
season.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U)  Mission Germany's Pandemic Influenza Working Group 
(PIWG) met by DVC September 18.  The primary task was to 
update members on the current situation in Germany and to 
review the adequacy of local tripwires.  Mission Germany 
remains under tripwire two, which indicates clusters of 
infection with only localized human-to-human transmission. 
The H1N1 virus in Germany has not demonstrated high lethality 
or caused widespread illness and absenteeism, as described in 
tripwire three.  A core group of PIWG members will begin 
meeting every other week. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Mission Health Unit confirmed adequate supplies of 
personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and 
masks.  Health Unit plans to vaccinate high risk groups first 
and then all direct hire Americans, as the supply of the H1N1 
vaccine permits.  LES will be encouraged to be vaccinated on 
the local economy.  The Health Unit is in contact with local 
schools used by the Mission community and will be notified if 
positive cases develop. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Management emphasized the importance of cross 
training all staff before the flu season begins, in case 
absenteeism increases.  RSO confirmed that guards have PPE and 
are trained to identify visitors with flu-like symptoms. 
Signs will be posted in Consular sections to discourage sick 
customers from entering the section and to publicize 
rescheduling procedures. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Consulates Frankfurt, Munich, and Hamburg reported 
no new cases in international schools.  Frankfurt schools have 
disseminated school emergency plans to all families.  Hamburg 
noted that some preparations are already in place for a 
potential increase in H1N1 cases due to cross-training and 
widespread use of FOBs and Blackberries.
