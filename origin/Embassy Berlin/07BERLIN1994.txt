¶1. (SBU) Summary: After a two-year disruption, Germany will resume 
training of the Iraqi armed forces in cooperation with the United 
Arab Emirates in early 2008.  From January through April, the 
Bundeswehr will train an Iraqi logistics and support battalion of 
800 soldiers in the UAE and provide equipment worth 7.5 million 
Euro.  This is a continuation of the effort started in 2004/2005, 
which was disrupted by an Iraqi reluctance to pay a share of the 
transportation costs.  End Summary

Schedule and Equipment provided

¶2. (U) While visiting the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on October 30, 
German Defense Minister Jung signed a trilateral agreement with the 
UAE and Iraq to train an Iraqi logistics and support battalion of 
800 military personnel in the UAE, providing 70 training instructors 
and 15 interpreters. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Training will begin in January 2008 with a two-month course 
for the battalion's staff officers, followed by seven weeks of 
training at company and battalion levels.  The Bundeswehr will 
provide 250 trucks and 100 ambulances, worth 7.5 million Euro total. 
 The UAE will provide the training facilities.

Controversial Transport Expenditure Resolved 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) German efforts to train the Iraqi military in 2006 and 2007 
were derailed by Baghdad's reluctance to cover 600,000 Euros in 
transportation costs, as previously agreed to for the 2005 training. 
 The German MOD confirms that the controversial transport 
expenditure issue has now been resolved.  Iraq has agreed to cover 
30 percent of the transportation costs (mainly to re-locate 
equipment from the UAE to Iraq), while Germany will cover the 
remaining 70 percent.
