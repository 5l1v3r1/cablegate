SUBJECT: GERMAN QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE COALITION AGAINST 
WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING 
 
REF: STATE 171694 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Global Affairs Counselor presented Reftel demarche 
October 17 to Ambassador Hermann Sausen, MFA Commissioner for 
Environmental and Biopolitical Issues.  Drawing on Reftel 
points, GA Counselor reiterated our interest in Germany 
becoming a full partner in the Coalition Against Wildlife 
Trafficking (CAWT).  GA Counselor also clarified our position 
that the CAWT is not a formal, legal entity, that there are 
no dues or fees associated with membership, that the CAWT has 
no link to the Global War on Terrorism and that the 
anti-trafficking measures envisioned in the context of CAWT 
would not affect existing legal trade in wildlife products. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Sausen expressed his gratitude for the 
clarification, noting that there had been uncertainty within 
the German Government concerning the structure of CAWT.  He 
was also interested in our assurance that legal trade in 
wildlife products would not be affected by the CAWT's 
antitrafficking efforts.  Sausen indicated he had not been 
aware of any misunderstanding about the relationship between 
CAWT and USG counterterrorism measures.  It was clear to the 
German Government, he said, that this inititive was not 
connected to ongoing counterterrorism programs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sausen reiterated Germany's interest in becoming a 
CAWT partner.  He noted that the issue of Germany's 
participation in CAWT is currently being considered in the 
German interagency community, with representatives of the 
MFA, the Finance Ministry and the Environment Ministry 
participating.  Sausen undertook to pass on our 
clarifications to relevant representatives of other 
interested ministries and to keep us apprised of developments 
in the German policy-making process.
