(SBU) Joerg Polster, German MFA Desk Officer for 
International Nuclear Energy expressed understanding that 
that funding and personnel priorities have led the US cancel 
its proposed U.S./French/German cooperative project to 
develop low enriched uranium (LEU) for Germany's FRM II 
reactor.  Polster expressed his hope that the U.S. would not 
find it necessary to shut completely Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory.  Polster stated that the laboratory responsible 
for the FRM II reactor will continue this work on the 
national level.
