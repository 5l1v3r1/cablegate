¶1.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARA 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The director of the Fraunhofer Ernst-Mach-Institute 
(EMI) recently provided additional information and supporting 
documentation that adequately addresses all questions posed 
in Blue Lantern post-shipment end-user license check 
056-050101085.  This response is in addition to EMI's 
original response (captured in REF C), which did not 
sufficiently answer the questions posed in the above 
mentioned Blue Lantern license check.  The following 
paragraphs contain the new response and attached 
documentation will be emailed to the appropriate Blue Lantern 
coordinator in conjunction with this cable. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Dr. Klaus Thoma, Director of EMI, stated that EMI 
received Endevco accelerometer model 7270A-200K on June 22, 
¶2008.  Thoma said that EMI is using this accelerometer to 
characterize material behavior under blast and impact loads 
in a shock tube with expected acceleration loads exceeding 
100,000 G.  In Thoma's supporting documentation, he included 
test results captured in a spreadsheet that demonstrated 
loads of more than 100,000 G.  Given this load environment, 
Thoma explained that only the Endevco accelerometer model 
7270A-200K would suffice for their planned tests. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The additional information that EMI provided was in 
response to inquiries posed by the Trade Compliance Manager 
at Endevco Corporation on October 13, 2008.  These inquiries 
were nearly identical in nature to that of the inquiries 
posed in REF C, although Thoma was much more responsive the 
second time around.  Although Thoma adequately answered all 
the questions, he still appeared somewhat vexed in his 
response and suspicious of the bone fides of the Blue Lantern 
queries.  Specifically, Thoma asked, "Who gets all this 
information about my institute and data from us and who 
guarantees that this information is not misused or widely 
distributed to our competitors?" 
 
¶5. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests Department guidance 
in responding to the question posed in the paragraph 4.
