SUBJECT: H1N1 Spikes By Over a Third in a Week: 10,368 New 
Cases; 5 New Deaths 
 
REF:  Berlin 1389 and previous 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: From October 26 to November 1, the number of 
confirmed H1N1 infections in Germany rose by 10,368 cases to 
40,271 total cases.  Five more deaths were reported in Germany 
due to H1N1 increasing the total number of death to eleven. 
END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) At its November 9 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 10,368 new (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) H1N1 cases in Germany over the period October 26 
to November 1, increasing the total number of H1N1 cases to 
40,271.  Bavaria (bordering the Czech Republic and Austria) 
remains the German state with the highest number of confirmed 
virus cases with a total of 12,590, followed by Nordrhein- 
Westfalen (8,468) and Baden-Wuerttemberg(5,395). 
 
Five more German H1N1 Deaths 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) On November 5, RKI confirmed the deaths of three 
patients due to H1N1. One person from Rhineland-Palatinate, a 
52-year old woman from Baden-Wuerttemberg and a 40-year old 
man from Berlin died on November 4 in Germany due to the new 
virus. In all three cases, the patients were considered to be 
"risk patients" and had underlying health conditions. 
 
¶4. (U) Media reports indicate that two more people infected 
with H1N1 have died. A 15-year old student from Kassel (Hesse) 
died on November 6 of heart disease. She had been hospitalized 
and was infected with the new flu.  A 55-year old woman died 
at Dusseldorf University Hospital on November 7 of H1N1. The 
patient reportedly came from Iran and traveled to Dusseldorf 
for treatment. The woman had suffered from a chronic disease 
before the infection.  This increases the H1N1 deaths in 
Germany to eleven. 
 
 
Skepticism over H1N1 vaccine vanishes; Germany worried about 
vaccine shortage 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  Two weeks after the beginning of the national 
vaccination campaign against H1N1, the initial skepticism over 
the vaccine has reportedly vanished in Germany.   Health 
officials from the federal states are reporting a significant 
increase in those seeking H1N1 vaccinations.  However, some 
federal states have reported a supply shortage due to 
production shortfalls, creating waiting lists for those 
seeking the vaccine. In reaction to this development, Federal 
Health Minister Philipp Roesler (FDP) has called for a health 
ministers' conference for this Wednesday to assess the new flu 
situation in Germany and to discuss potential weaknesses in 
the national vaccination supply scheme.
