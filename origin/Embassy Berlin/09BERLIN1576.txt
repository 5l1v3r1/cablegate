¶1. (U) SUMMARY: From November 28-December 4, the number of 
confirmed H1N1 infections in Germany rose by 11,582 to a total 
of 192,348 cases.  The number of H1N1 deaths in Germany 
increased to ninety-four.  Germany is considering selling its 
surplus H1N1 vaccine.  Our analysis of infection rates suggest 
that Germany has passed the crest of the current wave of new 
infections.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
Current wave peaked in mid-late November 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Influenza Working Group of the Robert Koch 
Institute (RKI) reported on December 10 a total of 11,582 new 
laboratory H1N1 cases in Germany from November 28 to December 
4, increasing the total number of H1N1 cases to 192,348. 
According to our analysis of RKI data, the rates of both new 
infections and deaths appear to have peaked in mid-late Nov. 
According to RKI historical data, a seasonal flu wave may come 
in mid-January 2010.  Bavaria remains the German state with 
the highest number of confirmed H1N1 cases, with a total of 
39,628 - accounting for 21 percent of all virus infections in 
Germany - followed by Nord Rhine-Westphalia (NRW--36,263) and 
Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(27,972). 
 
¶3. (U) As of December 10, RKI has confirmed the deaths of 
ninety-four patients due to H1N1.  In 85 percent of the 
deaths, patients were younger than 60 years of age.  In the 
majority of cases, the patients had underlying health 
conditions and were considered to be "risk patients." 
 
 
Germany may sell surplus H1N1 vaccine 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Germany reportedly may sell 2.2 million doses of its 
H1N1 vaccine supply to other countries after only 5-6 percent 
of the German population has elected to be vaccinated.  The 
governments of the federal states will decide whether or not 
to sell or donate the vaccine because they - not the federal 
government, purchased the supply.  It is not yet clear when 
the final decision will be made.  According to contacts at the 
Ministry of Health, the federal government will function as an 
agent for the states, offering the surplus vaccine to other 
countries via their foreign missions in Germany.  Germany 
received 9.6 million H1N1 vaccine doses in November.  A total 
of 20 million doses are expected to arrive by the end of 
December, with 30 million further doses by the end of March. 
The German population remains reluctant to be vaccinated; 
however, Health Minister Phillip Roesler (FDP) continues to 
caution that the virus has not become less dangerous.  He has 
emphasized that there could be a second wave of infections in 
2010 and has recommended that everyone in Germany get an H1N1 
vaccination.
