DEMARCHE TO PROMOTE RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORT 
CREDITS/FINANCING TO IRAN 
 
REF: STATE 81876 
 
¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer delivered ref demarche to 
Ursina Krumpholz, officer director of the German Ministry of 
Economics' Foreign Trade Law and Law of the Sea Division, and 
Ernst Roeder-Messell, deputy office director of the same 
division, June 15. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Krumpholz said the German Government's export credit 
guarantees are issued to German firms to shield them from 
foreign debt defaulters.  Therefore, Germany does not issue 
export credit guarantees to Iranian entities at all. 
Nevertheless, the German Government would deny export credit 
to a German firm that seeks to invest in Iranian entities 
sanctioned under UNSCRs 1737 or 1747.  In response to Global 
Affairs officer's query of whether the German Government 
would be willing to deny universally export credit to German 
firms that seek to invest in Iranian Government entities, 
Krumpholz said the German Government would be willing to 
consider this, so long as the recipients in question are 
Iranian state entities.  Roeder-Messell added, also in 
response to Global Affairs officer's query, that the German 
Government screens export credit guarantee applications from 
German firms. Furthermore, the German Government has a system 
in place to detect links between the Iranian recipients of 
German investment and Iranian Government entities. 
Therefore, the German Government has the means to deny export 
credit to a German investor who seeks, whether wittingly or 
not, to invest in an Iranian Government entity. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will report additional German response septel.
