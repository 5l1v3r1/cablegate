REF: A. BERLIN 317 
     ¶B. 06 BERLIN 3555 
     ¶C. BERLIN 61 
     ¶D. BERLIN 92 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 2, 2007 Ambassador Timken received another 
letter from the chairman of the Bundestag's Committee of 
Inquiry looking into allegations of renditions, the 
activities of the German intelligence services related to the 
war in Iraq, and the detention in Guantanamo of the 
German-born Turkish national Murat Kurnaz.  The letter is in 
German with an English translation supplied by the Bundestag 
(text in para 6 below).  In the letter, Chairman Siegfried 
Kauder (CDU/CSU) asks the USG to provide all documents of the 
U.S. Department of Defense, CIA, and the CTC in Guantanamo 
pertaining to Murat Kurnaz. 
 
¶2. (SBU) This is the most recent of several letters Committee 
Chairman Kauder has sent to the Ambassador requesting the USG 
either to produce testimony or evidence for the Committee's 
investigation.  Post has transmitted the previous letters 
(refs A and B) to Washington with a request for advice on how 
or whether the Ambassador or another Embassy Berlin official 
should respond to the Chairman of the Bundestag's Committee 
of Inquiry.  To date the Embassy has not received responses 
to any of the earlier requests. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We understand that Kauder does not expect a 
favorable response from the USG, but that he would appreciate 
an acknowledgment of receipt of the letters and perhaps an 
explanation of why the USG chooses not to comply with the 
committee's requests.  The Embassy requests some guidance on 
whether or how to respond. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a separately but related development, the German 
State Prosecutor's Office in Tuebingen has contacted the 
Staff Judge Advocate, Stuttgart Law Center, with requests 
regarding Kurnaz (refs C and D).  As above, the Mission and 
the Staff Judge Advocate would appreciate some guidance on 
whether or how to respond. 
 
¶5. (SBU) For Washington's reference regarding previous 
requests: 
 
-- Berlin 317: Chairman Kauder requests the testimony of 
American official "Steve H." who allegedly accompanied German 
officials who interviewed Kurnaz at Guantanamo. 
 
-- 06 Berlin 3555: Chairman Kauder requests copies of any 
videotapes made of German officials interviewing Kurnaz at 
Guantanamo. 
 
-- Berlin 61: Tuebingen Chief Public Prosecutor Michael Pfohl 
requests information about trucks that clean latrines in 
Khandahar and someone who could testify on the subject. 
 
-- Berlin 92: Tuebingen Prosecutor Pfohl clarifies and 
expands his request in Berlin 61. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Following is the text of the February 28 letter:

Dear Mr. Ambassador, 
 
On 7 April 2006, the German Bundestag adopted a resolution

the Committee of Inquiry is to clarify still unresolved 
questions, make assessments and draw the necessary

presented by the German Federal Government on events relating 
to the Iraq War and combating international terrorism." 
 
Please refer to enclosure 1 for details of the Committee of 
Inquiry's mandate. 
 
At its meeting on 22 February 2007, the Committee of Inquiry 
decided to cordially request the Government of the United 
States of America to support the parliamentary work of the 
Committee. 
 
On behalf of the members of the Committee, I would like to 
express the hope that you will find yourself able to provide 
information of importance for the Committee of Inquiry in 
fulfilling its mandate. 
 
In line with the Committee's Decision to take Evidence, which 
I also enclose for your information (Decision to take 
Evidence 16-266, enclosure 2), we request your assistance 
regarding the questioning of Mr. Murat Kurnaz by German 
officials in Guantanamo. 
 
In this context, the Committee of Inquiry requests all 
documents of the US Department of Defense, CIA headquarters 
and the CTC in Guantanamo pertaining to Murat Kurnaz, in 
particular regarding the question of his possible release, as 
well as all documents relating to communication with German 
offices about this case. 
 
I would like to thank you for your readiness to receive and 
examine the requests of the German Bundestag. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Sgd. Siegfried Kauder
