¶1. (SBU) Post followed up with MFA Pakistan Desk Officer 
Tobias Grothe on March 19 to see if Germany, as requested 
reftel A, would be able to contribute additional funds to one 
or more of the UN agencies involved in assisting internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) in Pakistan, or to help meet the 
Budget Extension Appeal of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross (ICRC) for Pakistan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Grothe indicated that Germany would donate an 
additional 1 million Euros to the ICRC in response to the 
recent Budget Extension Appeal.  He also pointed out that 
Germany, beginning in May 2008, began contributing some 
440,000 Euros yearly to finance the humanitarian component of 
the Special Assistance Fund of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), and would continue to do so. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Finally, Grothe reported that the German development 
implementing agency GTZ would carry out a project in 
cooperation with UNHCR to foster better relations between 
Afghan refugees and the local Pakistan communities in which 
they live.  He noted that a GTZ advance team was already in 
the area to do a needs evaluation for the project.
