¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  Germany is increasing its official 
assistance to Haiti to 15 million euros following the January 
12 earthquake.  The increase reflects 5 million euros in new 
funds from the Ministry of Economic Cooperation and 
Development (BMZ) that will support construction of housing 
for displaced Haitians.  As previously reported, BMZ is also 
providing 5 million euros for food and water aid, while the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is contributing 5 million 
for food, water, health and shelter.  The Director of the MFA 
Office of United Nations and Global Affairs is traveling to 
Washington on January 26 for consultations on Haiti. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Econoff delivered REF A points to contacts at the 
German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) 
and Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Sigrid Sommer of the 
MFA's Working Group on Humanitarian Affairs said the German 
government was increasing its assistance to Haiti to a total 
of 15 million euros.  BMZ, which had already committed 5 
million euros for food and water assistance, is providing an 
additional 5 million euros to fund construction of housing 
for Haitians displaced by the earthquake.  The money is 
sufficient to construct 1500 housing units and will be 
managed in cooperation with the UN Development Program 
(UNDP).  Once ground is broken, German officials predict 160 
units per week can be built, using material purchased "in 
regional markets."  Sommer added that the MFA's contribution 
remains at 5 million euros, which is supporting food, water, 
health, and shelter requirements.  Germany is also 
contributing 66 million euros for Haiti via the European 
Union. Private German donations for relief efforts in Haiti 
now stand at 86 million euros.  (REF B) 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Sommer, the Director of the MFA's 
Office of United Nations and Global Affairs, Freiherr Von 
Ungern-Steinberger, will travel to Washington on January 26 
for "consultations on Haiti."  She said he would meet with 
counterparts in the State Department, but had no other 
details of his schedule.
