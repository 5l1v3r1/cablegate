REF: SECSTATE 32412 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer delivered ref demarche to 
German MFA Export Control Division Deputy Office Director 
Markus Klinger March 19.  Klinger said the U.S. support for 
Croatia's application for Australia Group (AG) membership is 
"good news."  He noted that the EU, as well as Germany, has 
supported Croatia's bid for AG membership for several years. 
Now that the U.S. is satisfied with Croatia's improvements in 
its export control system, Klinger said he is optimistic the 
AG will reach consensus on Croatia's application, with 
Croatia's candidacy for EU membership bolstering its case. 
Klinger also observed that the U.S. opposition to Croatia's 
AG membership in 2006 and subsequent outreach and assistance 
proved beneficial, since this spurred Croatia to improve its 
export control system to meet AG standards.
