REF: 06 BERLIN 3555 
 
 ¶1.  (U) On February 9, 2007 Ambassador Timken received a 
letter from the chairman of the Bundestag committee 
investigating the detention in Guantanamo of the German-born 
Turkish national Murat Kurnaz.  In the letter, Chairman 
Siegfried Kauder asks whether the USG would be willing to 
allow an American official, who allegedly accompanied two 
German officials to Guantanamo where they questioned the 
detainee, to give testimony before the committe. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) This is the third letter since June, 2006 that 
Chairman Kauder has sent to Ambassador Timken requesting the 
USG either to produce testimony or evidence for their 
investigation.  The previous letters and attachments had been 
faxed and cabled (reftel) to EUR/AGS and L with a request for 
advice from L on how or whether the Ambassador or another 
Embassy Berlin official should respond to Chairman Kauder. 
To date the Embassy has not received responses to either of 
the earlier requests. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) We understand that Chairman Kauder does not expect 
a favorable response from the USG, but would appreciate an 
acknowledgement of receipt of the letters and perhaps an 
explanation of why the USG chooses not to comply with the 
committee's requests.  The Embassy would appreciate some 
guidance on whether or how to respond. 
 
¶4.  (U) Following is the text of the February 6 letter:

His Excellency 
Mr. William R. Timken, Jr. 
Ambassador of the United States of America 
Neustadtische KirchstraBe 4-5 
10117 Berlin 
 
February 6, 2007 
 
Dear Mr. Ambassador, 
 
On 7 April 2006, the German Bundestag adopted a resolution 
establishing the First Committee of Inquiry of the 16th 
electoral term. Under the mandate established by Parliament, 
the Committee of Inquiry is to clarify still unresolved 
questions, make assessments and draw the necessary 
conclusion, among other things, in connection with a report 
presented by the German Federal Government "On Events 
Relating to the Iraq War and Combating International 
Terrorism." 
 
Please refer to enclosure 1 for details of the Committee of 
Inquiry's mandate.  At its meeting on 1 February 2007, the 
Committee of Inquiry decided to cordially request the 
Government of the United States of America to support the 
parliamentary work of the Committee. 
 
On behalf of the members of the Committee, I would like to 
express the hope that you will find yourself able to provide 
information of importance for the Committee of Inquiry in 
fulfilling its mandate. 
 
In line with the Committee's Decision to take Evidence, which 
I also enclose for your information (Decision to take 
Evidence 16-230, enclosure 2), we request your assistance 
regarding the questioning of Mr. Murat Kurnaz by German 
officials in Guantanamo.  The German officials were 
supposedly accompanied during their journey to and stay at 
Guantanamo by a member of staff employed by U.S. agencies in 
Germany. The member of staff, identified as "Steve H.", may 
be able to testify about the questioning of Mr. Kurnaz in 
Guantanamo. 
 
The Committee would be grateful if the Government of the 
United States of America were prepared to make it possible 
for Mr. Steve H. to testify before the First Committee of 
Inquiry, and were prepared to send a photograph of him. 
 
I would like to thank you for your readiness to receive and 
examine the request of the German Bundestag. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Siegfried Kauder 
Chairman of the First Committee of Inquiry
