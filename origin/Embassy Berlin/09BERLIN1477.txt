¶1. Embassy Berlin passed and discussed reftel 
talking points with Peter Voss, head of the 
division "International ICT Policy, ITU" at the 
Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology; with 
Dr. Annegret Groebel, Head of Section for 
International Coordination at the Federal Network 
Agency; and with Marc Bogdahn, Deputy Director for 
the Balkans at the Foreign Office.  All our 
interlocutors indicated that they had not been 
aware of the resolution and its political 
implications and promised to share the information 
with their colleagues.  Voss subsequently told us 
he passed our concerns to the German delegation to 
the ITU in Geneva.  Groebel promised to inform us 
further of German views early next week (week of 
November 23). 
 
¶2. Comment: Implication left by all interlocutors 
was that Germany was sympathetic to US concerns but 
was fully unaware of Serbia's attempts to slip in a 
proposal via the ITU that could compromise Kosovo's 
sovereignty.  End comment.
