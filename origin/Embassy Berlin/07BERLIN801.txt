SIPDIS 
 
¶4.  Neither Post nor German authorities have any information 
that could affect the safety and security of your visit to 
Germany. 
 
¶5.  The Department of State assesses the risk in German 
cities with a U.S. diplomatic presence as high for 
transnational terrorism and low to medium for criminal 
activity.  The Mission Germany Regional Security staff stays 
up to date on all terrorism and crime-related issues within 
Germany and evaluates how these issues might affect both 
official and private Americans either living or visiting 
Germany. 
 
¶6.  Sporadic incidents of violence occur throughout various 
areas of Germany that are linked to right-wing extremist 
groups, targeting immigrant and refugee communities. 
Left-wing groups are also active throughout Germany staging 
large protests, normally without violence.  Protesters rarely 
cause property damage, but there have also been isolated 
cases of arson against American interests.  The recent trend 
of anti-globalization related protests and demonstrations 
seen throughout Europe is present in Germany as well.  These 
demonstrations have turned violent in the past in some 
European countries. 
 
¶7.  While there have been no recent significant domestic 
terrorist attacks, Germany continues to be a potential venue 
for transnational terrorism.  A heightening of the Middle 
East confrontation, U.S. arrest and jailing of Middle East 
terrorists, or a serious incident between the U.S. and a 
terrorist-supporting nation could change the terrorist threat 
assessment at short notice.  These and other indictors 
continue to be closely monitored by U.S. officials.  The 
arrest of key Usama bin Laden (UBL) supporters, the discovery 
that the lead cell for the September 11th attacks was located 
in Germany, the ongoing terrorist trials currently taking 
place, along with the German law enforcement community 
continuing to make arrests of suspected terrorists in all 
parts of Germany, adds credence to concerns about possible 
UBL initiatives in Germany. 
 
¶8.  Visitors to Germany should practice the same common-sense 
personal security practices that are an everyday part of life 
in U.S. cities.  German law enforcement agencies are 
professional and extremely supportive to the U.S. government 
and all of our concerns. 
 
¶9.  The countrywide police emergency telephone number is 110. 
 The fire department and ambulance service may be reached at 
telephone 112.  The U.S. embassy in Berlin reports current 
threat information for American citizens at 030-832-9233. 
 
¶10.  Assessment updates are available from mission-wide 
Regional Security Offices in Berlin at 49-30-8305-1400, 
Frankfurt at 49-69-7535-2444, or Munich at 49-89-2888-625.
