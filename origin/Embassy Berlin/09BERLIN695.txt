¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 cases in Germany rose to 
86 on June 10, as twenty more people were confirmed to be 
infected with the new virus. The four suspected military cases 
at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center were confirmed positive. 
RKI says the growth of cases in Germany does not represent a 
threat to the German population.   END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On June 9, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in an 
evening press briefing eleven new laboratory-confirmed cases 
of H1N1 in Germany. One previously confirmed case of H1N1 from 
Baden-Wuerttemberg is now being reviewed as a suspect case, 
RKI said.  According to the institute, five of the infections 
occurred in the US and one in Argentina. One of these 
individuals infected five other people inside Germany with the 
virus.  The new cases were distributed among the federal 
states as follows: Bavaria (6), Thuringia (2), Baden- 
Wuerttemberg (1), Hamburg (1), and Saxony (1). 
 
¶3.  On June 10, RKI confirmed an additional ten new 
laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 in Germany, increasing the 
total number of confirmed cases in Germany to 86. RKI reports 
that five of the new cases occurred in Germany and five in the 
US. 
 
 
Six US Soldiers in Germany Infected with New Flu 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The four suspected cases at Landstuhl Regional 
Medical Center (Rhineland-Palatinate) are now confirmed 
positive, making a total of six confirmed cases (REF A). 
German health authorities in Rhineland-Palatinate have been 
notified. All contacts have been surveyed, treated, 
sequestered as appropriate, based on exposure history and are 
reportedly recovering without incident. 
 
 
Epidemic Does Not Represent Threat to German Population 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Despite an increase in H1N1 cases in Germany, RKI 
announced that the epidemic in Germany does not yet represent 
a threat to the German population.  However, RKI expects 
further spread of the virus in Germany and advised on its 
website to maintain high standards of personal hygiene at all 
times to prevent infections. 
 
 
Tally of sources 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  In 51 of the 86 (total, to date) cases, the 
infection occurred in the US, nine cases occurred in Mexico, 
and one each in England, Canada, and Panama and two in 
Argentina. Twenty-one of the infections were transmitted among 
families of Germans who returned from travel, at a hospital, 
and the airport.
