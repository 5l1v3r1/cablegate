MICRO-REACTORS PROPOSAL FOR PARIS PLENARY 
 
REF: STATE 82614 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On August 12, EconOff delivered ref A non-paper to 
MFA Export Control Division Deputy Office Director, 
Markus Klinger, informing Germany of the US intention to 
submit a proposal for a "Chemical Micro-Reactor Systems 
Experts Group" at the September 2009 Australia Group (AG) 
Plenary in Paris.  After a first-glance examination of the 
non-paper, Klinger said that in principle he supports this 
proposal, but Germany would need time to discuss it with 
their technical experts before giving an official response. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Klinger said proliferation concerns regarding 
micro-reactors in the framework of the AG is "well known to 
Germany" and supports further discussion on this matter. 
Klinger said that a specific experts group on chemical 
micro-reactor systems gave him pause, and wondered if it 
would be better to lump the micro-reactor topic with other 
emerging chem/bio technologies of proliferation concern such 
as oligonucleotides into a more general "New Technologies 
Experts Group." 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Klinger said he would forward the non-paper 
immediately to German "experts" and would try to respond 
with feedback before the AG Paris Plenary.  Post will report 
any substantive German response septel.
