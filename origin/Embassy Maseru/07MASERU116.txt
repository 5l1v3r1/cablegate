SUBJECT: IRISH EMBASSY RELOCATES EMPLOYEE

¶1.  (C) Following the February 27 armed attack on the 
ministerial property used by Harvard's Partners-In-Health (PIH) 
couple (Refs A and B), the Irish Embassy has moved one of its 
permanent staff from a similar residence to a hotel.  Ambassador 
Paddy Fay informed U.S. Ambassador last week that he had 
relocated one of his officers from a house owned by Finance 
Minister Timothy Thahane to the Lesotho Sun, despite the 
officer's objections, out of fear that other ministerial 
residences could be targeted by discontented losing opposition 
parties or hired gunmen. 
 
¶2.  (C) Embassy Maseru has reviewed all properties of USG 
personnel and post's Management/Security Officer has confirmed 
that no official American staff are occupying such houses.  PIH 
staff were in a house owned by Minister of Tourism, Culture and 
Environment Nts'inyi (who was reappointed to her position March 
2). 
 
¶3.  (C) PIH Country Director met with Ambassador and DCM March 
¶5.  The PIH couple present during the grenade/gun assault are 
working out of the Clinton Foundation office and living in a 
hotel, but will travel to the U.S. for two weeks of counseling 
and rest.  Both English-language newspapers in Lesotho carried 
the attack on their front pages March 2, and on the same day, 
Lesotho's Police Commissioner requested a meeting with 
Ambassador to occur this week.
