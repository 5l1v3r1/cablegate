COMMENT ON UNSCR 1747 
 
REF: STATE 73219 
 
¶1. (SBU) On May 31, Poloff relayed reftel points on the United 
States' 60-Day Report to UN Security Council on UNSCR 1747 to 
Acting Principal Secretary for Foreign Affairs P. P. Makosholo. 
While not commenting directly on the implementation of UNSCR 
1747, he stated that the GOL continued to be concerned about 
negative developments in the Middle East.  He stated that 
information on the implementation of UNSCR 1747 from the United 
States and other friendly countries was much appreciated, and 
that it would be passed on to the Minister of Foreign Affairs as 
well as Lesotho's Permanent Representative to the United Nations 
(currently in Maseru for a global MFA chief of missions 
conference).  When queried directly about the implementation of 
UNSCR 1747, Makosholo stated that Lesotho was "not involved in 
the apportionment of blame" regarding Iran's proliferating 
activities, but his country did have great respect for UN 
decisions and wanted to see them enforced.

Regional Consensus Likely Key 
 
----------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT:  It is unlikely that Lesotho will be in the 
forefront of global political pressure for nations to fully 
implement UNSCR 1747.  Makosholo painted Lesotho merely as an 
interested bystander on this issue.  Lesotho's final decision on 
its UN vote will likely be highly dependent on the regional 
consensus developed among nations of the Southern African 
Development Community.  END COMMENT.
