Madagascar's AGOA eligibility terminated 
 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶1. On December 23, 2009, President Obama announced that 
Madagascar, together with Niger and Guinea, was not making 
continual progress in meeting African Growth and Opportunity Act 
(AGOA) requirements.  Effective January 1, 2010, those 
countries' designations as AGOA beneficiaries was terminated. 
The termination of Madagascar's AGOA eligibility is expected to 
have negative effects on employment in Lesotho, especially at 
the local denim mill.  Blue jean manufacturers in Madagascar 
were major customers of the denim mill.  Madagascar's AGOA 
status may also affect other countries in the region since the 
same local factory which imports Lesotho denim uses exclusively 
African-origin cotton. 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
1,200 job losses and factory closure possible 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. The local denim mill is known as Formosa Textile, a 
subsidiary of the Nien Hsing group.  The mill exports 30% of the 
denim fabric it produces to manufacturers of blue jeans in 
Madagascar.  In a statement submitted to the Office of the U.S. 
Trade Representative on October 15, 2009, in support of the 
renewal of Madagascar's eligibility under AGOA for 2010, Nien 
Hsing pointed out that blue jeans manufacturers in Madagascar 
are major buyers of denim fabric produced by Formosa Textile. 
Nien Hsing predicted that the economic viability of Formosa 
Textile would be seriously undermined if Madagascar were to lose 
its AGOA eligibility, putting Formosa's customers in Madagascar 
out of business.  Nien Hsing also mentioned that Formosa Textile 
was already losing money due to sagging orders for the United 
States market under AGOA since the end of the Multi-Fiber 
Arrangement.  According to the company, losing the Madagascar 
customer base would force them to close the denim mill, which 
would lead to 1,200 job losses in Lesotho.  Nien Hsing has 
invested $120 million in Lesotho and employs 9,000 workers, 
1,200 of whom work at the denim mill.

Will after-shocks spread to cotton-producing countries in the 
region?

¶3. Nien Hsing is one of the largest producers of denim fabric in 
Africa.  The denim plant in Lesotho has a capacity of 27 million 
square meters annually.  In addition, the Lesotho denim mill 
uses exclusively African-origin cotton, consuming approximately 
16,000 tons of cotton annually from Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, 
Tanzania, and Benin, as well as other countries in the region. 
 
 
 
¶4.  Note: Nien Hsing is the same company profiled in reftel, 
which described the firing and subsequent rehiring of employees 
following a Christmas party.  End note.
