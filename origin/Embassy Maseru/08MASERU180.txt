Mr. P. P. Makosholo, Europe and Americas Desk Director at

delegation has not been finalized; b) Lesotho's MFA appreciates 
continued updates regarding ongoing negotiations with Iran (ref

biotechnology (ref C), but has allowed GMOs to be imported in 
the past; and d) Lesotho currently has no food staple export

------------------------------------- 
AGOA Forum Invitations Delivered, 
Private Sector Representatives Likely 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  As per ref A, post distributed invitations to the July AGOA 
Forum in Washington to Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohlabi 
Tsekoa, Minister of Finance and Development Planning Timothy 
Thahane, and Minster of Trade and Industry, Cooperatives and 
Marketing Popane Lebesa under the cover of dipnote on June 12. 
While Lesotho has not officially responded with the list of 
their delegation, post has learned that the Prime Minister's 
Office would like to include representatives of Lesotho's 
fledging aloe industry in its official delegation. 
 
---------------------------- 
Iran P5+1 Incentives Package 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  On June 20, Poloff delivered ref B talking points and 
associated information on the updated P5+1 package for Iran to 
Mr. P. P. Makosholo, Europe and Americas Desk Director at 
Lesotho's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Mr. Makosholo thanked 
Poloff for the information, noting that the MFA appreciated the 
continuing flow of information regarding negotiations with Iran. 
 
---------------------------- 
No Position on Biotechnology 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  After Poloff delivered ref C points and aide memoire on the 
use of agricultural biotechnology as a tool to fight hunger, Mr. 
Makosholo commented that the MFA's lack of capacity on 
scientific issues has kept it from formulating an official 
policy on genetically modified crops.  He noted that Lesotho has 
accepted food aid consisting of genetically modified crops in 
the past without any concerns expressed by Lesotho's government 
or citizenry. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
No Food Export Restrictions in Lesotho 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Per ref D, post corresponded with the Lesotho Revenue 
Authority, the Ministry of Trade, and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and confirmed that Lesotho has no existing food staple 
export restrictions. 
 
------------------ 
Open to Influence? 
------------------ 
 
¶6.  COMMENT:  While the GOL has been slow to comment on the 
lineup of its AGOA delegation, Lesotho's private sector, 
encouraged by recent post export diversification outreach 
activities, has already announced its intention to send three 
representatives.  Lesotho's lack of a clear position on 
agricultural biotechnology could leave the nation open to 
influence, and post would eagerly pass on any additional 
information on the issue to relevant local parties.  END COMMENT.
