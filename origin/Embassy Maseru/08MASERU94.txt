REF: STATE 32645 
 
On March 31, Ambassador delivered reftel demarche on the 
Zimbabwe election to Principal Secretary of Foreign Affairs J. 
Â¶T. Metsing.  [NOTE:  Foreign Minister Tsekoa was out of town on 
March 31 and unavailable.  END NOTE.]    Ambassador expressed 
deep concerns about the electoral process in Zimbabwe and the 
need for SADC member states to press Mugabe to respect the 
democratic process.  Metsing, noting Lesotho's concerns about 
the general situation in Zimbabwe, stated that the GOL would 
continue to watch events in the nation with great interest.  He 
noted that the MFA had already been contacted by representatives 
of the Canadian and Australian governments concerning Zimbabwe's 
elections.  Metsing added that although Lesotho does not have 
any official election observers in the nation, it remained 
concerned about the matter.  The MFA would report the U.S. 
position to a full cabinet meeting on April 1, concluded Metsing.
