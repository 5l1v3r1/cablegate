SUBJECT: BASRAH: SOUTH OIL COMPANY CHAIRMAN OUSTED 
 
REF: 08 BASRAH 90 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On May 19, Iraq's South Oil Company (SOC) 
Chairman Kifah Numan was forced out of his job, and replaced by 
Fayadh Hassan Nima, most recently Director General (DG) of the 
Ministry of Oil's (MOO) Studies and Planning Directorate.  Numan 
later told Basrah Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) contacts 
that he was offered Nima's position at the Studies Directorate, 
but declined, and he has now retired.  This change is widely 
seen as part of MOO's larger efforts to "rein in" what it sees 
as a far too independent SOC.  Meanwhile, new DG Nima faces 
severe challenges in attempting to boost SOC's flagging 
production.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Sudden, but not surprising, ouster 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) South Oil Company (SOC) Chairman Kifah Numan himself 
confirmed that he was forced out of his job on May 19, and his 
last day was May 21.  Hans Hoiskar of Norway-based Petronor, a 
close contact of Numan, told PRT EconOff that he met with Numan 
on the morning of May 19.  Hoiskar said that that afternoon, 
Fayadh and former SOC DG and current MOO senior advisor Jabbar 
Al-Laebi, came to SOC's headquarters and convened a meeting of 
all top SOC managers to announce the change. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
"Had enough of the lousy oil ministry planning" 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In response to a text message from acting UK Basrah 
Consul General Fionna Gibb, Numan said that he had left SOC, and 
is now "enjoying my first days of retirement."  Numan said that 
he had "had enough of the lousy Oil Ministry."  He said that he 
was asked to move to the Ministry as DG for Studies Department, 
but declined. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
MOO cuts off SOC's "independence" 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) PRT contacts believe that the removal of Numan is part 
of MOO's more general efforts to rein in what the MOO sees as a 
far too independent SOC.  MOO's patience with SOC's "autonomy" 
has long been running thin.  In late March, according to these 
same contacts, Minister of Oil Dr. Hussain Al-Shahristani, with 
the blessing of Prime Minister Maliki, attempted to nominate 
current DG of the Iraqi Drilling Company (IDC) and Shahristani 
ally Dr. Idris Yasri, to oversee the MOO's "Crash Program" to 
increase national oil production.  In this scheme, Yasri was to 
be a czar of sorts over SOC, Northern Oil Company, and Maysan 
Oil Company simultaneously.  The written order establishing this 
arrangement was met with a defiant written response by Numan, in 
which he expressed his refusal to accept Yasri's nomination or 
work with him, and questioned Yasri's limited background in the 
oil sector.  Since this confrontation, most observers believed 
that Numan's days at SOC were numbered. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Challenges Ahead for Nima 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to PRT contacts, Fayadh Nima is originally 
from Basrah.  While he has never worked for SOC before, he is 
well known within its ranks.  His MOO-related background is 
primarily within the downstream side; he worked at the Dora 
refinery in south Baghdad before being appointed DG of MOO's 
Studies and Planning Directorate.  PRT contacts indicate that 
while he is largely apolitical, his nominal party affiliation is 
with Da'wa Maliki, the same party as the Prime Minister. 
Another PRT contact told PRT EconOff that and while Fayadh's oil 
background is not extensive, he is generally considered 
"moderate and educated." 
 
¶6. (SBU) Nima faces many challenges. SOC faces great pressure to 
comply with the GOI and MOO's "Crash Program" to increase 
production.  Nima is now the third SOC DG in less than a year. 
(Former DG Jabbar Al-Laebi, now a senior advisor to MOO, left 
the company in May 2008.)  According to industry analysts, SOC 
suffered a 100,000 barrel-per-day production decline in 2008, 
and faces further declines in 2009 and 2010.  SOC has already 
been forced to cut supplies to local refineries in order to 
maintain its export commitments.
