1.(U) Summary. UK Secretary for International Trade and 
Investment Lord Peter Mandelson led a UK delegation of business 
heavyweights to Basrah on April 7.  Over 150 top Basrawi 
business and political figures attended the conference, which 
was also attended by local US diplomatic and military officials. 
 UK delegates reported a sense of guarded Basrawi optimism and a 
realistic view of business opportunities in the region. 
Conference organizers focused on the relative strength of the 
province, namely oil, gas, ports, and aviation.  While good 
relationships were established or strengthened, now it is up to 
Basrah, and the GOI in general, to follow up and provide 
reasonable security, and a transparent business environment. 
End summary. 
 
Lord Mandelson brings UK business heavyweights to Basrah 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
¶2. (SBU) Over 150 Iraqi business and political figures attended 
this April 7 Basrah Investment Conference, which also brought 
together 23 UK-based companies.  Several of them are household 
names, including Rolls Royce, Shell, BP and HSBC.  According to 
Basrah HMG officials, UK delegates were able to establish or 
strengthen relationships with key business figures in Basrah, 
and also give Iraqi participants an idea of which sectors UK 
investors were particularly interested in.  Basrah HMG officials 
told REO staff that UK delegates left with a sense of renewed 
optimism and a realistic view of business opportunities in 
Southern Iraq.  Another such conference, scheduled for April 30 
in London, is seen as a good follow-on effort. 
 
All-star attendance 
------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Attendees included Basrah Governor Wa'eli, most members 
of the incoming Provincial Council including the two reported 
favorites to become the next governor and/or chairman (Da'wa 
Party Central members Dr. Shiltagh and Dhya'a Jabar), and the 
Directors Generals of the major investment sectors, including 
South Oil and South Gas Companies, Iraqi Ports, and Basrah 
International Airport.  Michael Wareing, the British Co-Chair of 
the Basrah Development Commission (BDC), also participated. 
Also in attendance were several local high-level Iraqi military 
officials, who provide security for the province.  UK Force 
Commander Tom Beckett and several Basrah-based UK military 
officials also attended. 
 
U.S. participation 
------------------ 
¶4. (SBU) USG representatives included the US Commander of MND-S, 
US REO Director, and Basrah PRT Team Leader.  At this event, as 
at other gatherings, several local business and political 
leaders again expressed their desire to see U.S.-based 
businesses, along with their expertise and capital, come to the 
region (ref D). 
 
British and Basrawis pitch security, ports, aviation, oil, gas 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
¶5. (SBU) Lord Mandelson opened the conference by looking back at 
the UK's long relationship with Basrah, and looked forward to 
closer economic cooperation ahead.  Michael Wareing, the British 
Co-Chair of the BDC, spoke of the UK's role in developing 
business in Basrah.  General Mohammed, who commands Iraqi 
Security Forces in the Province, spoke confidently about perhaps 
the most important issue for any prospective investor: security. 
 Mohammed noted the dramatic decrease in violence just in the 
last nine months, while acknowledging that hard work was needed 
to continue this trend.  The speeches were followed by short 
presentations by the respective Directors General for ports, 
airport (ref B), oil and gas.  Dr. Haider Ali, Chairman of the 
Basrah Investment Commission (which has been heavily supported 
by the BDC and UK) spoke about the general investment climate. 
 
Timed to UK military exit and incoming Basrah Provincial Council 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) Following the 31 March transition from UK to US 
military control (MND-SE to MND-S), UK officials hoped to 
demonstrate to Basrawis that while their military was drawing 
down, the UK's commitment to Basrah continued.  In the run-up to 
the formation of the new Provincial Council (ref C), UK 
officials said they hoped the conference would promote the 
importance of international investment to economic growth in 
Basrah. 
 
Guarded, yet realistic, optimism 
-------------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) While HMG hosts and local participants expressed a 
generally guarded optimism about Basrah's future, such optimism

at least partly reflects the mood of the city.  One year after 
the Iraqi Army routed local militias in the Charge of the 
Knights Operation (ref A), there is a palpable feeling of 
stability.  A recent PRT-commissioned poll revealed that over 
80% of Basrawi businesses think that the economic environment 
has improved in the last year and, more significantly, that it 
will continue to improve over the next two years.  Participants 
openly noted that it will take more than optimism to turn such a 
conference into desperately needed real investment and job 
creation. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶8. (SBU) Hosting a forward-leaning investment conference is a 
long way from real investment, but the conference met the 
organizers' objective of bringing all the major economic and 
political players together in Basrah.  The conference also 
demonstrated to local players that there are serious and 
respected UK multinational companies ready to do business in 
Basrah.  However, now it is up to Basrah, and the GOI in general 
(particularly the respective line ministries, who must play a 
central role in approval and oversight of the majority of such 
investments), to follow up on the hard part, namely, reasonable 
security, and a transparent business environment.
