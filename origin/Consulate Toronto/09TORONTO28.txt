¶1. (SBU) Summary: Ontario Ministry of Transportation officials have 
told us that they hope to begin issuing an Enhanced Drivers License 
(EDL) by the June 1, 2009 deadline for the Western Hemisphere's 
Initiative (WHTI).  However, a labor dispute and changes in 
technology standards have delayed the Province from signing the 
necessary agreements with the Canadian federal government, and thus 
delayed the required business plan from being forwarded to the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS).   Despite these setbacks, 
Ministry officials say they are ready to move forward quickly once 
the issues are resolved, and also are working on contingency plans. 
End Summary.

MOT Knows the Steps 
------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MoT) officials met with 
us January 29 and addressed our concerns about its announcement of 
plans to start issuing Enhanced Drivers Licenses (EDLs) in winter 
2009, despite not having yet submitted its plans for DHS 
concurrence.  The officials confirmed that they will not be able to 
commence issuing EDLs this winter, but they are still aiming to 
begin issuance prior to June 1.  They also clarified that they are 
aware of the steps that must be taken prior to the Province issuing 
the EDLs, including the submission of a business plan to the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and convening joint working 
groups.  According to the officials, they have already created 
working groups with the Province of Quebec and the state of New York 
and are expecting a visit from a CBP working group soon (Note: post 
is not aware of a planned CBP visit for this purpose and has not 
seen any country clearance request).

Labor Union, Technology Tripping Up MoT 
--------------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) The MoT officials explained that a number of unexpected 
issues delayed the Province's EDL program.  Prior to submitting its 
business plan to DHS/CBP, the Ontario government must sign an MoU 
with the Canadian federal government.  Canada's federal government 
is insisting that MoT agree to perform financial background checks 
on employees who will handle EDL applications, similar to checks the 
federal government uses to screen its passport employees.  This 
requirement, however, has pitted the local labor union against the 
Ontario government, with the Canadian Union of Public Employees 
(CUPE) arguing that such financial checks would violate employees' 
privacy rights.  We understand that the Canadian federal government 
will not drop this requirement from its MoU with the Province.  The 
MoT will seek to resolve the issue with CUPE at an Ontario Grievance 
Settlement Board hearing on February 17. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Changes in technical standards for the RFID chips also 
delayed the EDL program.  The Canadian federal government informed 
the Ontario MoT in late 2008 of a required increase in RFID antenna 
sensitivity.  The required design changes created a two-month delay 
in the manufacturing process.  According to MoT officials, they are 
working on contingency plans so that once the labor and technology 
issues are resolved, they can speed through the regulatory process 
and issue at least a few EDLs in time for the June 1 WHTI deadline. 
[Note: Ultimately, they expect to issue approximately 500,000 EDLs 
at eight designated Service Ontario centers at or near the border 
and in Ottawa.] 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  While MoT officials are determined to begin 
issuing EDLs prior to June 1, that looks like a difficult goal to 
attain except in perhaps the most symbolic way (e.g. perhaps the 
issuance of a few EDLs to the Premier, responsible Minister, etc). 
Labor union conflicts in Ontario often take on a life of their own, 
with resolution taking months.  Additionally, the working group 
consultation process may cause delays, based on requested changes 
from either side.  That said, all the relevant ministries have 
essentially signed off on the program and the MoT is prepared to 
fast track the EDLs to begin issuance as soon as possible.  Post 
looks forward to working with DHS/CBP to help ensure Ontario's plan 
for EDL issuance succeeds, thereby giving a boost to smooth WHTI 
implementation.
