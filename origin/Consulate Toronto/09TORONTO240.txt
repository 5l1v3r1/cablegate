REF: (A) Toronto 106 (B) Toronto 210 (B) Ottawa 768 
 
¶1. (U) Twenty-six-year-old Ali Mohamed Dirie, who pled guilty on 
September 21 to participating in the "Toronto 18" terror plots, 
received a seven-year sentence on October 2.  Somali-born and raised 
in Syria and Toronto, Dirie was arrested at the Canada-U.S. border 
in August 2005 attempting to smuggle hand guns into Canada.  He was 
later indicted on terrorism charges, accused of attempting to 
procure weapons for the group from jail.  Like two other 
previously-sentenced members of the group, Dirie was given credit 
for pre-trial detention, reducing the total time he will likely 
serve in prison to approximately two years. 
 
¶2. (U) On October 1, Crown prosecutors announced that they would 
appeal the sentencing of an earlier "Toronto 18" conviction, Saad 
Khalid, who on September 3 received 14 years.  Credit for pre-trial 
detention in Khalid's case, also reduces the time he will serve in 
prison.  In filing the notice of appeal, Crown prosecutors stated 
that the sentence does not fit the "gravity of the offense and the 
culpability of the offender." 
¶3. (U) Since the initial arrests of 18 Toronto-area men in 2006, for 
a plot to carry out terrorist attacks in Southern Ontario to protest 
Canada's military presence in Afghanistan, the following have been 
convicted: 
a) Nishanthan Yogakrishnan, 21, was convicted in September 2008 and 
sentenced to 30 months on May 22.  Given credit for time-served, he 
has already been released; 
b) Ali Mohamed Dirie, 26, pled guilty on September 21 to 
participating in the activities of a terrorist group; he received a 
seven year sentence and will receive double credit for time in 
pre-trial detention; 
c) Saad Khalid, 23, was sentenced to 14 years in prison on September 
4 and will receive double credit for time in pre-trial detention; 
d) Saad Gaya, 21, pled guilty on September 28 and awaits a December 
sentencing hearing. 
Seven others accused of participating in the "Toronto 18" terror 
plots are still awaiting trial.  They cannot be identified due to an 
ongoing publication ban.  Charges against the other seven members 
were either stayed or dismissed
