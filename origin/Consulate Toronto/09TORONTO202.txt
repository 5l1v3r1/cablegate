REF: SECSTATE 56857 
 
1.(SBU) IAW reftel, Post conducted a site visit to Redline 
Communications' facility on August 25, 2009.  We spoke to 
Vice President for Marketing and Business Development Kevin 
F.R. Suitor about the subject Blue Lantern check. 
 
2.(SBU) Suitor expressed surprise and skepticism that Redline 
had received any item requiring special handling and 
safeguarding as a sensitive USML item.  Suitor also explained 
that the project manager, and the person responsible for 
ordering for the project that would have been associated with 
the delivery of the USML article, in September 2007, had both 
left Redline as a result of corporate downsizing. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Suitor was unable to identify the parts in the Blue 
Lantern request; therefore, the questions relating to exact 
USML articles, exact end use, positive control and current 
location, and whether the USML articles would be transferred 
or re-exported are not addressed in this cable.  He promised 
to look for information on the USML article in question.  We 
will relay that information septel when it is provided. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The remaining questions, and the associated answers, 
follow: 
 
¶Q. Does Redline Communications have secure facilities and 
proper accounting and security procedures for handling 
sensitive USML items?  Where and what are they? 
¶A. Suitor claimed that Redline has no requirement for 
classified information or employees with clearances, and does 
not believe Redline has EVER (emphasis Suitor's) received any 
USML items that would require safeguarding. 
 
¶Q. When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
¶A. Redline Communications Incorporated is a publicly-held 
Canadian company, trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
There is also a Redline entity incorporated in Delaware that 
mostly oversees its U.S.-based sales force. 
 
¶Q. What is the nature of the company's business?  Has Redline 
Communications previously sought defense articles listed on 
the USML? 
¶A. Redline designs, engineers, and manufactures broadband 
wireless equipment in the sub-six gigaherz bands.  Suitor 
claimed that all of his company's products are made only to 
commercial specifications.  Besides its facility in Markham - 
where Redline houses its headquarters, engineering, sales and 
marketing, and finance units - they also have development 
facilities in Bucharest and Craivoa, Rumania.  According to 
Suitor, Redline contracts with independent manufacturers in 
the U.S., Mexico and Taiwan to produce Redline's equipment. 
 
¶Q. What types of organizations are among Redline 
Communications' typical customers, where are they located? 
¶A. Redline sells in 149 countries, but 80 percent of its 
business is done in "North America" and the "Middle East". 
According to Suitor, half of its North American sales are to 
government entities, including the USMC.  In the middle east, 
a significant majority of Redline's sales are commercial, to 
telecommunications companies in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, 
Bahrain, Tunisia and others. Redline also has contracts with 
the government of Egypt. 
 
¶Q. Do Redline Communications officials understand the 
restrictions on USML items, especially the prohibition 
against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
¶A. Suitor explained that while he understood the concept and 
requirements, his company does not use USML-controlled items 
and therefore does not have concerns about re-transfer or 
re-export of such items.
