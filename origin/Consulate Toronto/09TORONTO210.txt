18" CONVICTION 
 
REF: Toronto 106 
 
¶1. (U) Saad Khalid, a 23-year-old Toronto-area man accused of 
participating in the 2005 Toronto 18 terrorism plot, and the first 
of the group to be tried as an adult, was given a sentence of 14 
years on September 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Superior Court Justice Bruno Durno found that as an active 
member and recruiter for the group, Khalid played an integral part 
in the terror plot.  However, even with that finding, the justice 
granted Khalid double credit for time awaiting trial since June 
2006, reducing the potential remaining time to be served to seven 
years.  Khalid will be eligible for parole in two years. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Khalid is the first of the "Toronto 18" terrorist group to 
plead guilty and is the second to be sentenced.  The first man 
sentenced is a 21-year-old whose name is still under a court-ordered 
publication ban initially imposed because of his status as a minor 
at the time of arrest.  He was sentenced in May 2009 to two and a 
half years in prison and three years probation.  After also 
receiving double credit for his pre-trial detention, he was released 
for time served.  Trials for the remaining nine members of the group 
are scheduled for next year.
