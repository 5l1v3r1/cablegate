¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On September 25, an Ontario Superior Court 
justice found a Toronto-area man guilty of terrorism charges in 
Canada's first conviction under its Anti-Terrorism Act.  The man was 
part of a group that planned a series of bombings and a raid on 
Parliament Hill.  Ten other men, allegedly also members of the 
"Toronto 18" terror cell, await trial.  END SUMMARY. 
¶2. (U) In June 2006, police arrested 18 suspects in the Greater 
Toronto Area on terrorism-related charges (ref A).  The "Toronto 18" 
suspects allegedly were planning to bomb Toronto offices of the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, the Toronto Stock Exchange, a Canadian 
Forces base, and the CSIS and RCMP headquarters in Ottawa.  They 
also allegedly planned to storm Parliament Hill in Ottawa and take 
Members of Parliament hostage; if the Canadian government did not 
withdraw its armed forces from Afghanistan, they reportedly planned 
to behead Prime Minister Stephen Harper (ref A).  The trial of the 
first suspect began on March 25 (ref B).  Charges against seven of 
the 18 defendants have effectively dropped, and 10 men await trial. 
 
¶3.  (U) This is the first conviction under Canada's Anti-Terrorism 
Act.  The convicted man, now 20, was 17 at the time of his crimes, 
and the Youth Criminal Justice Act prohibits Canadian authorities 
from releasing his name.  Born in Sri Lanka, he moved to Canada in 
1994 and converted to Islam in high school.  (Note:  We cannot 
verify whether he obtained his Canadian citizenship or if he is 
still a Sri Lankan national.  End note).  The court found that the 
man attended a training camp with other members of the group, where 
he took part in firearms training and quasi-military exercises.  He 
also shoplifted walkie-talkies and removed a surveillance camera 
hidden in one group member's apartment building; by doing so, 
prosecutors successfully argued, the man was "providing a skill or 
expertise" under Canadian anti-terror law.  The man now faces up to 
10 years in prison. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The conviction of this suspect is an important 
victory for Canadian law enforcement and prosecutors.  The convicted 
man reportedly was a minor player in the Toronto 18 group.  His 
conviction shows the wide scope of Canada's Anti-Terrorism Act, and 
makes the conviction of the 10 remaining defendants more likely. 
END COMMENT.
