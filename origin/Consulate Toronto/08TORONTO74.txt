¶1. Prominent Liberals recorded convincing victories as expected in 
two Ontario federal by-elections on March 17.  Bob Rae, former NDP 
Ontario Premier (1990-95) and current Liberal foreign affairs 
critic, won overwhelmingly in Toronto Centre, a long-time Liberal 
stronghold.  With a voter turnout of only 28%, Rae took 59% of the 
vote, or in raw vote terms, 14,187 votes out of 24,000 cast.  More 
notable than Rae's unsurprising victory was the relatively strong 
performance by the Greens, who finished third with 14%, barely 65 
votes behind the NDP, the traditional alternative choice in this 
left-leaning riding.  The Conservatives, who by most accounts did 
not run a serious campaign and were beset by early controversy in 
their candidate selection process, took just 12.5% of the vote. 
 
¶2. In the northern Toronto riding of Willowdale, former Liberal 
leadership candidate Martha Hall Findlay also won big, easily 
outpacing Conservative challenger Maureen Harquail 59% to 30%. 
Turnout-typical for a by-election-was very low at 25%. 
 
¶3. COMMENT: The Toronto Liberal by-election victories were no 
surprise, and the wide margin of victory and lack of a serious 
Conservative challenge only affirm the Liberal edge in Ontario urban 
areas.  Ontario's federal Liberals are sending two prominent 
personalities and former leadership rivals of Stephane Dion to 
Ottawa.  Bob Rae in particular is viewed as a potential Dion 
alternative for the Liberal leadership.
