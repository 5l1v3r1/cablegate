¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A group of Canadian corporations filed and has 
argued an appeal of Ontario Superior Court's June 5 approval of the 
restructuring plan for the frozen C$32 billion third-party 
asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, claiming they were 
misled about the risks of the investments.  It is unclear how long 
the appeal may delay the restructuring plan's implementation, which 
earlier was expected to be completed by the end of June.  Purdy 
Crawford, chair of the ABCP restructuring committee, separately told 
Toronto business leaders in a closed-door session that he recommends 
carefully measured regulatory reform in response to the ABCP market 
collapse last summer. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On June 5, after months of negotiations, Ontario Superior 
Court judge Colin Campbell approved the Crawford committee's 
restructuring plan of the C$32 billion third-party asset-backed 
commercial paper (ABCP) market, including a provision enabling 
noteholders to sue ABCP dealers for fraud.  The 1,781 retail 
investors who hold C$215 million of the total C$32 billion ABCP 
market, will receive 100% of their money promptly under repurchase 
plans launched by Canaccord Capital and Credential Securities.  The 
market's 200 corporate investors, however, will not be eligible to 
cash out on their investments immediately, but instead are to 
receive long-term notes that will mature in nine years (Ref A).

Corporate Investors Appeal Ontario Court Decision 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (U) A group of Canadian corporations has said they will fight the 
approved plan, claiming that they were misled about the risks of 
ABCP and should be able to sue for damages.  Their appeal was heard 
in the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 25-26.  The investor group is 
comprised of private and public companies from across Canada.  On 
June 23, one of the appellants, Transat A. T., dropped out, 
announcing it had struck a deal with National Bank of Canada.  The 
bank has agreed to provide the company with a three-year credit 
facility for up to 75% of Transat's C$143.5 million ABCP holdings in 
exchange for Transat's agreement to drop its appeal. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Calls for Measured Regulatory Reform 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) ABCP restructuring committee chair Crawford has called for 
measured regulatory reform in response to the collapse of the 
market.  He cautioned that regulatory reform must balance risk and 
market efficiency, as well as be globally integrated.   Crawford 
plans to appear before the House of Commons' finance committee in 
the near future to provide his recommendations on regulatory reform. 
 Crawford and other market experts are calling for improved 
transparency for noteholders and investors at large.  Under current 
regulations, ABCP and other short-term debt issuances do not require 
prospectus disclosures.  Regulatory bodies such as the Investment 
Dealers Association (IDA), continue to investigate the behavior of 
ABCP retailers.  Though the IDA can sanction brokers for 
inappropriate behavior, it does not have the authority to recover 
lost funds (Ref A). 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: Legal experts have been reluctant to speculate on 
the possible outcome of the appeal, but clearly it will force 
further delays before final resolution of the ABCP market.  If 
unsuccessful at this level, the appellants could still take their 
case on to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC). The extent of the 
delay will also depend on how many appellants actually go to court, 
as some may just be using the appeal as leverage in settlement 
negotiations with lenders (The same tactic was used unsuccessfully 
by bondholders opposing the BCE (Bell Canada) leveraged buyout). 
Analysts tell us they believe the stability of Canadian financial 
markets depends on the restructuring plan's success.  Retail 
investors reportedly remain optimistic that the restructuring plan 
will proceed since 96% of investors voted in favor of the plan.  END 
COMMENT.
