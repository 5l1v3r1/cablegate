SUBJECT: Decentralization in Kalimantan charting progress

¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Decentralization in Kalimantan is delivering 
results for residents of South and East Kalimantan, although many 
economic challenges remain.  In Banjarmasin, GDP per capita has 
steadily increased during the post-2001 decentralization era, but 
remains below national averages.  In Tarakan, which local leaders 
call "Little Singapore," economic and human development indicators 
have increased dramatically in recent years and the prospects for 
further development are strong.  Provincial and local leaders view 
decentralization positively, but recognize the central government 
continues to have considerable influence, particularly in economic 
matters.  End summary. 
 
South Kalimantan: economic potential and problems 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (SBU) South Kalimantan, with roughly seven percent of all of 
Kalimantan's land mass and just over three million residents, is a 
resource-rich province whose economy is led by mining (23% of GDP) 
and agriculture (21% of GDP).  Despite these natural resources, 
South Kalimantan GDP per capita in 2006 was Rp 10.3 million ($1,144; 
Rp 9,000/USD), compared to Rp 14.8 million ($1,644) nationally. 
Although the GDP per capita is still low by national standards, 
South Kalimantan GDP per capita has risen considerably since 2000 
when it was Rp 6.2 million ($689).  The UN Human Development Index 
places South Kalimantan well below Indonesia's overall score - in 
2005, 62.1 compared to 72.8 nationally.  Unemployment in South 
Kalimantan has steadily risen over the past three years and is 
projected to be near 9% for 2008, just below the national average 
(9.3%).  In 2007, South Kalimantan economic growth was 6.01%, weaker 
than national averages.  Inflation was 7.78% in 2007 and it remains 
high in 2008, largely due to food prices.  In Banjarmasin, South 
Kalimantan's capital, 2008 inflation is projected to be 8.6%.  In 
the other three Kalimantan provincial capitals, 2008 inflation is 
projected at 10-12%, also largely due to high commodity prices. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Food prices are driving inflation in South Kalimantan, 
however it is a less critical social-political issue than compared 
to Java as Kalimantan is a substantial rice exporter to Java (40% of 
Kalimantan's overall rice production is sent to Java).  In the first 
quarter of 2008, food prices accounted for 70% of the inflation 
increase.  South Kalimantan is a microcosm for many of the economic 
development challenges related to decentralization in Indonesia. 
Poor infrastructure, land use regulations, and other central - local 
government coordination issues complicate economic development in 
South Kalimantan.  Although mining, particularly coal, is the 
primary industry, government officials place much prospect in palm 
oil.  Currently, there are about 250,000 hectares in South 
Kalimantan used for palm oil, but provincial government officials 
stated that there is nearly 600,000 more hectares still available 
(total South Kalimantan land mass is 3.75 million hectares).  There 
are 11 million hectares in Kalimantan for potential palm oil 
plantations, according to central bank statistics.  Placed in 
perspective, there are 7.8 million hectares in Sumatra (which 
produces over 70% of Indonesian palm oil) and 4.5 million hectares 
in Malaysia. 
 
Decentralization: progress, but power still in Jakarta 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Popular support for decentralization is strong in South 
Kalimantan.  Over 75 percent of South Kalimantan residents said that 
they are better off during the decentralization era, according to 
Australian public opinion firm Roy Morgan, which polled 2,300 
residents.  The central government still wields significant 
authority over provinces and districts, particularly in its 
distribution of resources.  South Kalimantan Governor Rudy Ariffin 
said that he travels to Jakarta three to four times per month in 
order to meet with Parliament members, Cabinet ministers, and other 
central government officials.  Although the South Kalimantan 
governor can lead larger strategic projects in the region (e.g., 
 
JAKARTA 00000847  002 OF 003 
 
 
proposed Trans-Kalimantan highway), budget flows from the central 
government indicate the strong role of the districts (kabupaten) and 
cities (reftel).  In 2007, the central government disbursed roughly 
Rp 7 trillion to districts and cities, whereas only Rp 1.3 trillion 
went to the provincial government. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Economic decentralization is still a work in progress. 
Significant decision-making and resource authority remain in 
Jakarta.  For example, only four percent of coal revenue is retained 
by the local government, according to central bank representatives 
in Banjarmasin.  Governor Ariffin cited electricity as a top 
concern.  The four provinces of Kalimantan produce 240 million of 
the 280 million metric tons of coal per year in Indonesia; South 
Kalimantan alone produces 80 million metric tons of coal per year. 
Yet in South Kalimantan, there is a projected electricity crisis by 
2010 if electricity capacity is not significantly increased. 
 
Tarakan: Little Singapore? 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Tarakan, a small island city in northern East Kalimantan 
near the Malaysian border, is a compelling decentralization success 
story.  With about 180,000 residents and limited natural resources, 
Tarakan's economy is largely driven by the trade, hotel, and 
restaurant sectors (over 40% of GDP).  Since the increased regional 
autonomy funds began in 2001, Tarakan has doubled its per capita 
income (2001 - Rp 8.2 million per capita; 2006 - Rp 15.8 million; 
growth projections remain positive).  From 2002 to 2006, Tarakan has 
averaged over 8 percent economic growth.  Social, health, and 
education indicators are also strong.  The UN Human Development 
Index ranked Tarakan as the fourth best city or district in East 
Kalimantan.  In 1999, Tarakan was well below Indonesia's overall 
Human Development Index ranking, but is now scoring above the 
national average. 
 
¶7. (SBU) City leaders market Tarakan as a "Little Singapore." 
Tarakan has used the increased funds through regional autonomy since 
2001 to encourage investment and raise standards of living.  Among 
its many awards, Tarakan was named the "Best City" in 2005 by the 
Jawa Pos Pro-Autonomy Institute and has been recognized for its 
innovation in government.  During their briefing to Embassy 
officials, city government leaders presented numerous ways, from tax 
incentives to regulation streamlining, that they are encouraging 
investment.  Tarakan is also emphasizing investment in education, 
including the recently established University of Borneo. 
Educational officials stated that the city government spends over 20 
percent of its budget on education. 
 
Provincial Proliferation: North Kalimantan Province? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The Indonesian Ministry of Home Affairs is now considering 
a proposal to establish a North Kalimantan province, that would be 
the fifth province in Kalimantan.  Tarakan city officials said that 
the principal goal to establish a new province would be to improve 
public service delivery in northern East Kalimantan.  East 
Kalimantan is over one and half times the size of Java and many in 
northern East Kalimantan believe that resources are focused in the 
political and economic hubs of Samarinda and Balikpapan.  East 
Kalimantan GDP per capita was Rp 67.6 million ($7,511) in 2006, over 
four times the national average.  The North Kalimantan proposal 
appears to be stalled in Jakarta, but there is support in Tarakan 
and other parts of East Kalimantan, according to multiple contacts 
in Tarakan.  One possible indicator for this proposal's success will 
be the May 18 East Kalimantan gubernatorial race.  Tarakan Mayor 
Jusuf Serang Kasim, supported by Golkar, is engaged in a tight 
political race with Samarinda Mayor Nusyirwan Islamial, supported by 
PDI-P.  Jusuf's candidacy is based on the success of Tarakan. 
Although the North Kalimantan decision will be made by the central 
government, Jusuf's potential provincial leadership could move along 
the proposal.
