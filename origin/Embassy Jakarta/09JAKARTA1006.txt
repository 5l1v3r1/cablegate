¶1.  (U) This is an action cable. Please see paragraph 
¶5.  This message is Sensitive but Unclassified. 
Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Despite the postponement of her planned 
Washington trip, Indonesian Health Minister Supari is 
still keen to explore deepening our health 
cooperation.  Ministry of Health advisors Dr. Widjaja 
Lukito and Ambassador Makarim Wibisono told us on 
June 12 that Minister Supari plans to reschedule her 
trip to the United States in July, after Indonesian 
Presidential elections.  She wants to discuss broader 
health cooperation under the Comprehensive 
Partnership.  She is particularly interested in a 
joint Indonesian-U.S. research laboratory that could 
be developed from the current NAMRU operation, but 
with shared leadership by the U.S. and Indonesian 
health ministries. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Minister Supari understands that NAMRU visas 
expire on June 30 and that the laboratory will close 
unless visas are extended, thereby ending discussions 
for a joint laboratory.  However, she is one of three 
ministers who are closely following NAMRU issues.  In 
order for her to advocate extending NAMRU's visas 
beyond June 30, she needs to show the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) and other agencies that 
discussions for a new joint laboratory have started 
between Washington and her staff.  She wishes to send 
both Dr. Widjaja and Ambassador Wibisono to 
Washington on June 16 for an exploratory meeting that 
will follow-up on Secretary Clinton's meeting with 
Foreign Minister Wirayuda (Ref B).  This meeting 
would allow for preliminary discussions of a joint 
laboratory and other ways to strengthen our health 
cooperation.  The Minister can then use findings from 
the meeting to advocate for visa extensions in GOI 
interagency deliberations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We are making some progress overcoming 
Supari's lingering suspicions regarding NAMRU.  Dr. 
Widjaja noted that Minister Supari continues to hear 
rumors that Indonesian scientists are sending samples 
to NAMRU contrary to her explicit orders.  We 
indicated that NAMRU has nothing to hide and is in 
full compliance with Indonesian regulations.  We 
noted that NAMRU would be willing to immediately 
provide office space for a MOH representative.  This 
representative could attend NAMRU general staff 
meetings, have access to the NAMRU laboratories and 
get to know both NAMRU Indonesian and American staff. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action Request:  Mission recommends that 
Ambassador Marciel and Ambassador Hume agree to meet 
Dr. Widjaja and Ambassador Wibisono the afternoon of 
June 16.  Without this meeting, we do not believe 
there is any possibility that Minister Supari will 
persuade DEPLU to extend the visas.  End Action 
Request.
