COMMISSION 
 
REF: A. JAKARTA 324 
 ¶B. JAKARTA 156 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to preliminary information from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (Deplu), Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani might lead 
the Indonesian delegation to the next Major Economies Meeting 
(MEMIII) in Paris this month.  There will be four persons in the 
delegation, possibly including a representative from the National 
Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS).  Post will follow up and 
provide confirmation of this. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Separately, Post reported President Susilo Bambang 
Yudhoyono (SBY) was going to issue a decree establishing a National 
Climate Change Commission (NCCC) by the end of February (ref A). 
Our Ministry of Environment contacts now say that President SBY's 
international travel schedule delayed the decree, but that it is now 
"on the President's desk" awaiting his signature.  During the March 
27 monthly Environmental Donors Coordination Meeting in Jakarta, 
other donor representatives confirmed they are also expecting the 
decree in early April. 
 
¶3. (SBU) It is unclear what role the NCCC will play in international 
climate change talks.  Debate on this, and the proposed NCCC's 
detailed role and responsibilities in general, may also have 
contributed to the delay.  One of the NCCC's primary 
responsibilities will be to monitor compliance with and 
implementation of Indonesia's National Action Plan for Addressing 
Climate Change, released in November 2007.  BAPPENAS will serve as 
the NCCC's Secretariat, while a Steering Committee to serve as the 
day-to-day coordinator or implementer of the Commission's mandate. 
BAPPENAS will play a planning role, but other Ministries will have 
equal responsibilities.
