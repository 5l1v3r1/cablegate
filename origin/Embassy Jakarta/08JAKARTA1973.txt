     ¶B. Thompson-Benavidez email September 17, 2008 
 
¶1. (U) During an October 24 meeting, the Executive Director of the 
ASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE), Mr. Nguyen Manh Hung, said the final 
draft of ASEAN's Energy Action Plan for 2010-2015 will be presented 
to Senior Officials in March 2009 and will be adopted by ASEAN 
Ministers in May 2009.  He did not offer any information on the 
contents. 
 
¶2. (U) Mr. Manh and his staff had reviewed a number of proposals in 
the area of energy efficiency that the ASEAN-U.S. Technical 
Assistance and Training Facility (TATF) had sent to them previously. 
 Mr. Hung was interested in working with the U.S. to implement 
several of the projects and as they are in line with the forthcoming 
Action Plan.  He said the Centre is particularly interested in 
compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) standards, cleaner coal, window 
efficiency, and cogeneration cook stove activities.  Hung also 
expressed an interest in the proposed ASEAN energy and environmental 
sustainability conference (ref B), but would like to discuss topics 
in more detail before moving forward on dates or a location. 
 
¶3. (U) Manh identified a number of priorities for the Centre.  These 
include: how to develop appropriate rules and regulations for cross 
border power transmission (taxation, competition, for example), how 
to address the issue of financing and technology transfer in 
renewable energy, how to increase energy efficiency in ASEAN 
economies and perform energy audits, and how to develop an ASEAN 
regime for the safe development of nuclear power. 
 
¶4. (U) For all proposed activities, Manh stated that ACE will be 
seeking an MOU with the implementing agency to set the framework for 
cooperation.  They are about to sign such an agreement with 
ECO-Asia.  He noted that ACE would be looking for a payment(s) to 
the Centre to support operational costs for this and other 
agreements.  (Note: This reflects ACE's difficulty in funding its 
own operations and priorities, a common problem within ASEAN 
institutions -- see ref A.  End Note).
