SUBJECT: INDONESIA: SENIOR DELEGATION CHIEF NEEDED FOR WORLD OCEAN 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF:  Jakarta 655 
 
¶1.  There is an urgent need to name a senior official to lead the 
U.S. delegation to the May 11-15 World Ocean Conference and Coral 
Triangle Initiative Summit. Secretary Clinton told President 
Yudhoyono that the USG will send a high-level representative to the 
Conference.  A strong delegation could advance the Administration's 
environment and climate change agenda and demonstrate our continued 
commitment to the Coral Triangle Initiative. 
 
¶2.  Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Numberi had invited 
NOAA Administrator Lubchenco to participate and planned to offer her 
the keynote speaker address.  However, no senior representation from 
NOAA is planned, undercutting Secretary Clinton's commitment to 
President Yudhoyono.  The World Ocean Conference (WOC) is an 
important opportunity to advance the U.S. standing on the 
environment and climate change agenda.  The best way the U.S. can 
help ensure success is to send the right representative, which will 
encourage other nations to do the same.  The sizeable U.S. Coral 
Triangle Initiative (CTI) program is an important contribution to 
the region.  Without a senior U.S. representative at the Coral 
Triangle Initiative Summit we minimize our contribution rather than 
capitalize on it to generate favorable publicity and promote our 
views. 
 
¶3.  The USG needs a plan for representation at the WOC especially if 
Dr. Lubchenco cannot participate.  One step would be to name 
Commerce Undersecretary for Oceans and Atmosphere Mary Glackin now 
to head the delegation.  We also suggest that Secretary Clinton 
record a three-to-five minute video addressing World Ocean 
Conference delegates and wishing them success.  Her message would be 
an opportunity to state Administration priorities and expectations 
on climate and the environment directly to national delegations. 
Senior NOAA participation and such a message from Secretary Clinton 
would fulfill her promise to President Yudhoyono.

AN EVEN BETTER OPTION: FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4.  Secretary Clinton advanced the U.S. -Indonesia relationship 
significantly by including Jakarta on her Asia itinerary.  Embassy 
Jakarta has learned that former President Bill Clinton plans to 
visit Indonesia on/about May 19.  If the former President could 
juggle his schedule in the region to visit Indonesia earlier, we 
could invite him to participate in the Coral Triangle Initiative 
Summit events on May 14-15. All six Heads of State of CTI countries 
will attend the Summit events on May 14 and 15.  Australian Minister 
of Environment Stephen Garrett will also participate as the 
Australia's observer country representative. With former President 
Clinton's attendance, any concerns about U.S. commitment to the 
World Ocean Conference and CTI Summit would vanish.  President 
Clinton's attendance would reinforce the Secretary's message that 
Indonesia is important, build impressive momentum for a potential 
President Obama visit in November, and signal the new 
administration's commitment to the environment.  We request the 
Secretary's office to investigate this option.
