TRAFFICKING 
 
REF: Jakarta 01854, Jakarta 01895, Jakarta 02033 
 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: The Indonesian government is improving its 
operational effectiveness in combating trafficking in persons. 
Although much remains to be done, a recent TIP conference (see 
septel) in Surabaya highlighted several success stories.  Police are 
successfully adapting their tactics to pursue traffickers in 
cyberspace, recently even busting an underage trafficking ring on 
Facebook.  Government ministries, police and prosecutors are also 
successfully cooperating across provincial and international borders 
to bring victims home. 
 
POLICE CRACK FACEBOOK TRAFFICKING RING 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) A recent case highlighted the police's resourcefulness in 
combating trafficking in Indonesia.  The Surabaya City Police 
successfully uncovered an illegal commercial underage sex 
trafficking ring on Facebook in late January 2010.  The trafficker 
posted pictures of twenty-five girls on Facebook, some of whom were 
as young as 15.  Page visitors selected the girls and did their 
transactions over the internet.  The police arrested two suspects 
and have identified and put out a fugitive alert for the ringleader. 
 
 
CROSS-BORDER COOPERATION, SUCCESSFUL REPATRIATION 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶3. (U) The government of Indonesia (GOI) is taking trafficking 
issues seriously, and is focusing on the welfare of Indonesian 
citizens overseas. A government working group in conjunction with 
the International Organization for Migration (IOM) rescued and 
repatriated 425 Indonesian workers from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and 
Amman, Jordan on January 20, 2010.  On January 18, 2010, a 
collaborative group of government ministries facilitated the 
repatriation of 199 Indonesian migrant workers from the Indonesian 
Embassy shelter in Kuwaiti.  The National Police screened for 
minors.  IOM encouraged the Department of Social Welfare to screen 
for trafficking victims, who they then referred to IOM for medical 
treatment. 
 
¶4. (U) Indonesian police are cooperating across provincial borders 
to pursue traffickers.  Police in NTT, West Java and Bali have 
identified and are working together to apprehend an Iranian born 
trafficker who has been sending illegal migrants from Afghanistan, 
Iran and the Middle East through Indonesia to Australia. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Fifty women and girls were rescued when Police Commissioner 
Fatmah Noer, Head of the Women and Children's Unit in West Java 
Provincial Police led a cross-border raid on a karaoke bar and a 
brothel in West Java and in Bangka Belitung Provinces.  Her unit 
arrested a female pimp (born in South Sumatra Province), her 
bodyguards in Bangka Belitung Province and accomplices in both 
provinces.  Seventeen of the victims were from West Java and the 
rest were from across the country.  They had been held in debt 
bondage, forced to work long hours, paid low wages, threatened, 
intimidated, and starved.  They told police that their traffickers 
have transferred other victims to Malaysia and Singapore.  The 
police worked with IOM, which assisted the return and recovery for 
14 of the victims, and transport for the social worker. 
 
¶6. (U) These cases show both the complexity of the trafficking 
situation and the Indonesian government's increasingly successful 
efforts to use new tools and work across agencies and borders to 
identify, protect, and repatriate victims of trafficking.
