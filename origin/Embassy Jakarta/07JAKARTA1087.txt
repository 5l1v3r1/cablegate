Please note action requests for APHIS and FDA in paragraphs 4 and 5 
 
¶1. Summary. In one whirlwind day on April 16, USDA Deputy Under 
Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Dr. Chuck Lambert 
 
SIPDIS 
discussed major issues facing U.S. agriculture in Indonesia and 
opened the APHIS Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Office.  In 
meetings with Government of Indonesia (GOI) officials, the GOI 
indicated that the requested that technical meetings on Decree 37 be 
moved from May 18 to May 21.  The GOI's Decree 37 subjects U.S. 
fruit to unwarranted pest mitigation measures and does not recognize 
pest-free areas in the United States.  The GOI is willing to accept 
additional technical information from APHIS for its expert meeting 
the first week of May and requested an expert from FDA accompany the 
team to discuss cocoa. Regarding the additional declaration for 
shipments of cold-treated apples, the GOI indicated that it would be 
sufficient if the U.S. included language indicating that a time and 
temperature recording device was placed with the product when 
shipped.  End Summary 
 
Decree 37 
--------- 
 
¶2. In a meeting with Mr. Syukur Iwantoro, Head of the Agricultural 
Quarantine Board, Dr. Lambert requested that technical meetings 
regarding Decree 37 be held in Jakarta on May 18.  However, Thursday 
May 17 is a national holiday in Indonesia and many will leave town 
for a long weekend.  As an alternative, GOI suggested the following 
Monday, May 21.  The GOI requested that the technical team meet not 
only with government officials, but also with their expert 
committee, which includes non-government members. 
 
Cocoa Issue 
----------- 
 
¶3. The GOI requested assistance in approaching FDA about exports of 
cocoa.  The FDA detains Indonesian exports due to filth resulting 
from cocoa pod bore infestations.  The GOI said that the USG has not 
provided a "transparent explanation" of the reasons behind the 
detentions. The need to address the problem throughout the chain was 
discussed, since cocoa from Sulawesi, where the pest is a problem 
for small growers, is mixed with cocoa from the largely pest-free 
plantations on Java before being shipped to the United States. 
 
Action Requests 
--------------- 
 
¶4. Quarantine officials said that the internal expert meeting 
originally scheduled for April 3 was postponed until the first week 
of May.  They reiterated their willingness to accept additional 
information from USG for consideration.  Materials must be submitted 
before May 1.  The report on temperate fruit flies submitted with 
Mr. Fedchock's February 8, 2007 letter was shown to the officials 
present.  One had not seen it, so a copy was provided yet again. 
(see Reftel) 
 
¶5. Dr. Lambert suggested that FDA be invited to accompany the APHIS 
technical team and discuss the cocoa pod bore issue following 
discussions on Decree 37.  He said that by having both agencies 
represented at the meetings, a creative solution could be reached. 
 
Both sides agreed that the cocoa association and growers would 
benefit from discussions. 
 
Media Event 
----------- 
 
¶6. The visiting Deputy Under Secretary of Agriculture, Dr. Charles 
Lambert, was the center of media attention on April 16. In the 
morning, he spoke to Metro TV's four million viewers about the 
activities APHIS's Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Office, aimed 
at accelerating U.S. Government, and particularly USDA, efforts to 
help Indonesia fight the spread of avian influenza.  In the 
afternoon, he spoke to an opening ceremony and press conference 
attended by Charge John A. Heffern and some 30 key media 
representatives about the importance of working together to control 
high pathogenic avian influenza.  Dr. Lambert's remarks were carried 
by five Indonesian major newspapers, two national TVs, one cyber 
media outlet and two international news organizations, reaching tens 
of millions of people in Indonesia and throughout the world with the 
U.S. message that we are together in this fight, and that the U.S. 
is doing all it can to help combat this deadly disease. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. The familiar strain about the cocoa pod bore problem in 
Indonesian cocoa shipments to the United States was heard again in 
conjunction with discussions on Decree 37, further showing that the 
problem needs to be addressed.  A united USDA and FDA approach to 
addressing the issue on cocoa could result in further movement on 
some of the issues relating to Decree 37.  Movement on the cocoa pod 
bore issue is clearly of prime importance to GOI.  Immediately 
following the meeting, the GOI sent a letter inviting FDA to come to 
Indonesia for discussions. 
 
Dr. Lambert did not have the opportunity to clear this cable.
