REF: STATE 199860 (UN SCALE OF ASSESSMENTS) 
 
 ¶1. (U) On December 18, visiting IO PDAS Warlick met with 
Slamet Hidayat, Director General for Multilateral Affairs in 
Indonesia's Department of Foreign Affairs.  During the 
meeting, we urged that Indonesia support retention of the 
current 22-percent ceiling rate in the UNGA debate on UN 
assessments (reftel). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Hidayat said that Indonesia wanted "no change" to 
its current overall scale of assessments, since the GOI was 
unable to pay any more than it did now, but he understood 
that this was a big issue for Japan and others.  He noted 
that this issue had become caught up in the debate over 
Security Council reform, with Japan linking its contribution 
to its UNSC membership bid.
