SUBJECT: PROPOSED ARF ISM ON NONPROLIFERATION:  INDONESIAN 
POSITION 
 
REF: STATE 101525 
 
¶1. (SBU) We discussed reftel concerns on July 24 with 
Mariyani (single name only) in the Directorate of 
Asia-Pacific Intra-Regional Cooperation in the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) and provided a copy of 
the revised draft proposal for an Intersessional Meeting 
(ISM) on Nonproliferation.  Mariyani noted that the revised 
proposal only partially met Indonesia's concerns and said it 
would be forwarded to Foreign Minister Wirajuda for a 
decision. She would inform us of that decision before August 
2 if possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the discussion, Mariyani stated that, for 
Indonesia, the most important issue was the inclusion of the 
word "disarmament" in the title because this would ensure 
that disarmament could always be discussed.  Mariyani further 
explained that, for long-standing policy reasons, the 
government of Indonesia regarded disarmament and 
nonproliferation as inseparable. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We responded that the inclusion of references to 
disarmament at multiple places in the text of the proposal 
made clear that the subject could be discussed in the ISM. 
We emphasized, however, that the focus of the ISM should 
remain on nonproliferation and asked that Indonesia consider 
the revised draft as a constructive compromise that could 
satisfy both sides.
