FROM AMBASSADOR HUME TO AMBASSADOR LANGE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Despite possible signs of progress on the sample sharing 
impasse with the Ministry of Health, I remain concerned about the 
Indonesian government's management of avian influenza.  Given 
Indonesia's position as the epicenter of avian influenza human and 
poultry outbreaks, the lack of progress in controlling disease among 
birds and humans, the increasing human case fatality rate, and 
evidence that the disease within poultry is a serious problem in 
both the commercial sector as well as backyard poultry, I remain 
convinced that the Indonesian government needs assistance in 
controlling the disease to avoid setting off a pandemic.  Per our 
recommendation reftel, we support an external review of our avian 
influenza program assistance.  We need to know whether we have our 
priorities right and whether we need to adjust current efforts to 
meet the challenges ahead. 
 
¶2. (U) Our Avian Influenza Working Group has developed draft terms 
of reference (TOR) for this review which we will transmit to the 
Avian Influenza Advisory Group via e-mail.  The TOR outlines our 
proposed objectives, scope of work, evaluation team composition, 
methods, deliverables, actions, timeline and budget for the review. 
I welcome feedback from you and the rest of the interagency group on 
our draft TOR.
