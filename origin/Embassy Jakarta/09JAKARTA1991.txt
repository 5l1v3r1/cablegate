¶1. (SBU) On December 1, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation 
(DGCA) convened a planning seminar on Air Traffic Management (ATM). 
Representatives from airlines and government agencies discussed 
modern ATM strategies, including Performance-Based Navigation and 
Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADSB). DGCA is grappling 
with whether to bring in a vendor to integrate existing navigation 
equipment or to plan for an entirely new system.  Director General 
Herry Bakti said he is seeking proposals only from 
Massachusetts-based Raytheon and French firm Thales. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy officers met with Raytheon's Regional Director for 
Asia on a recent visit to Jakarta and encouraged him to prepare a 
formal commercial advocacy request.  We are also working to find 
ways the US Trade and Development Agency might help showcase US ATM 
technology and applications that fit DGCA's needs.  At this time, 
there do not appear to be other US competitors for the ATM project, 
although there is other interest in a radar project with the 
Ministry of Defense. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We have been working with DCGA to position Indonesia to 
resume flights to the US by 2012.  A Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) team is expected to visit Jakarta's 
Soekarno-Hatta International airport in January, and a Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) Technical Review is tentatively 
planned for March or April 2010.  In addition, Boeing plans to hire 
a consultant to assist Indonesia in its bid to regain FAA Category-1 
status. Active, continued US engagement will result in a safer 
aviation sector and enhance US companies' chances for success in 
this market (reftel).
