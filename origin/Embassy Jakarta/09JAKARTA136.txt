SUBJECT: Indonesia to Invite President Obama to World Islamic 
Economic Forum 
 
¶1. (SBU) Indonesian President Yudhoyono will invite President Obama 
to participate in the Fifth World Islamic Economic Forum to be held 
in Jakarta on March 2-3.  The conference will focus on the 
implications of the global financial crisis as well as alternative 
energy and food security for the Muslim world. 
 
¶2. (SBU) President Yudhoyono's office intends to issue the formal 
invitation to President Obama shortly, according to conference 
organizer Tanri Abeng.  Acknowledging the short notice, Abeng hoped 
President Obama might speak via video hook-up and send a senior 
administration official to represent him in person.  The Forum can 
foster dialogue and promote economic opportunities both within the 
Muslim world and with other partners, including the U.S.  Abeng said 
the Forum would also highlight Indonesia's growing regional and 
global leadership. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Six heads of state have already confirmed their 
participation, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Qatar, Bahrain, and 
potentially Mexico and the Netherlands.  President Yudhoyono will 
deliver the keynote address on March 2, followed by plenary sessions 
on the financial crisis, alternative energy, and food security on 
March 3. Indonesia will host events in cooperation with WIEF's 
Businesswomen and Young Leaders Networks.  One broader secondary 
benefit of hosting the Forum is to highlight investment 
opportunities in Indonesia, according to Abeng. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Short WIEF history: WIEF is an outgrowth of economic 
meetings at the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) and 
spearheaded by Malaysian Prime Minister Badawi.  A "mini" Davos for 
the Muslim World, WIEF is designed to bring together both Muslim and 
non-Muslim political and business leaders to discuss critical 
economic issues and showcase investment opportunities in the Muslim 
world.
