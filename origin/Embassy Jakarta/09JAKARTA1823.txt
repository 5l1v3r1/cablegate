SUBJECT: USG PARTICIPATION IN MAJOR REGIONAL SECURITY 
CONFERENCE 
 
¶1.  (U) This message contains an Action Request.  Please see 
paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Center for Strategic and International 
Studies--Indonesia's leading think tank (but unrelated to the 
Washington CSIS)--will host the Seventh Conference of the 
Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP) 
November 16-18 in Jakarta.  CSIS expects new Indonesian FM 
Marty Natelegawa, Singapore FM George Yeo, and Australian PM 
Rudd's Special Envoy for the Asia-Pacific Community Richard 
Woolcott to attend.  Other participants will include senior 
civilian government officials and military officers, leading 
academics and experts from across the region.  Discussions 
will focus on regional implications of the global financial 
crisis, Asian strategic architecture, nonproliferation and 
arms control and other topics.  (Note:  Mission has sent the 
draft program to EAP/MTS by email.) 
 
¶3.  (U)  ACTION REQUEST:  CSCAP is one of Asia's leading 
security and foreign policy conferences.  As such, USG 
participation is critical both to convey U.S. policy to key 
regional players and to demonstrate the depth of our 
engagement in Asia.  CSIS invited EAP DAS Ambassador Scot 
Marciel to participate in a session on regional security 
architecture, however, we understand that a prior commitment 
precludes his attendance.  In DAS Marciel's absence, Mission 
recommends that the Department identify an appropriate 
Washington official to attend CSCAP.  (Note:  Separately, DAO 
is seeking a U.S. Military representative to attend in place 
of Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral John Bird who was 
also invited and cannot attend.)  END ACTION REQUEST
