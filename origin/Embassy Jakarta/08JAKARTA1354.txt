handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Indonesian Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DEPLU) has sent Embassy Jakarta the text of a 
proposed Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA).  Indonesia is 
in the process of concluding DCAs with its major partners in 
the region.  Indonesian defense officials have raised the 
idea of reaching an agreement with the USG several times in 
bilateral defense discussions over the past year, but the 
Indonesian diplomatic note moves the process further along. 
This message provides the text of the proposed agreement. 
Mission will provide an analysis of the Indonesian proposal 
via septel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The proposed DCA consists of ten articles, the 
central one containing a description of areas of cooperation. 
 Essentially, the agreement would formalize existing forms of 
cooperation.  In contrast to a memorandum of understanding, 
the agreement, if adopted, could require ratification by the 
Indonesian legislature (DPR). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The diplomatic note and draft agreement are 
reproduced below. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Text of GOI diplomatic note (no.
