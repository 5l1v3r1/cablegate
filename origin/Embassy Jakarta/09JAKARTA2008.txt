COOPERATION 
 
¶1. (U) Action request in paragraph 6. 
¶2. (SBU) On December 7, Ambassador met Director General 
Ambassador Retno Marsudi to discuss the upcoming visit of 
Under Secretary William Burns.  Marsudi asked for a 
one-on-one meeting with Burns to discuss health cooperation 
and Papua.  Regarding NAMRU-2, Marsudi described the 
difficulties posed by former Health Minister Supari,s 
October letter announcing the closure of NAMRU-2.  The 
Ambassador replied that, if the GoI closes NAMRU prior to 
establishing the follow-on Indonesia-U.S. Center for 
Biomedical and Public Health Research (IUC), &we won,t 
reopen."  NAMRU personnel need immediate renewal of their 
visas, and must maintain their privileges and immunities or 
they will be forced to depart.  Marsudi said that she had 
briefed new Health Minister Endang, who wanted to delay 
opening the IUC until after the planned January 15 date.  The 
Ambassador said that, as we had come a long way toward 
establishing the IUC, it was now time to come to closure on 
IUL structure as soon as possible. 
Science and Technology:  few issues still to be resolved 
--------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) On negotiations over the Science and Technology 
Agreement, Americas desk director Bunyan stated that three 
issues remain: 1) Material Transfer Agreement; 2)Genetic 
Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (GRTKF); and 3) 
intellectual property rights, including benefit-sharing.  He 
stated that the GoI was &ready to discuss8 the outstanding 
issues with the U.S.  The Ambassador pressed, asking when we 
could meet next, and asserting that the agreement should be 
concluded prior to the mid-January arrival of Science Envoy 
Dr. Bruce Alberts. 
Sjafrie visa application: rejection still rankles 
----------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) Director General Marsudi stated that, at a recent 
meeting with Parliamentarians, the Foreign Minister received 
numerous questions about the visa case of Sjafrie 
Sjamsoeddin.  The Minister, she related, downplayed the 
issue, describing that GoI,s decision to withdraw the 
application after the G-20 meeting had already taken place. 
Marsudi asked for assurances that Kopassus  commander Wibowo 
would not face a similar rejection, and asked that he be able 
to make the case for reengagement during Under Secretary 
Burns, visit. 
Afghanistan 
------------------ 
¶5. (SBU) The Ambassador suggested that the GoI be prepared to 
show its support for Afghanistan by the donors conference at 
the end of January.  Marsudi replied that, after Secretary 
Clinton spoke with Foreign Minister Natalegawa in Singapore, 
the Minister made a recommendation to President Yudhoyono, 
and awaited his reply. 
Joint Statement on Comprehensive Partnership 
-------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) Action request: Marsudi asked whether the U.S. or 
Indonesian side should initiate the draft of a Joint 
Statement by the two presidents announcing the Comprehensive 
Partnership.  Post would appreciate Department/NSC guidance 
in order to respond.
