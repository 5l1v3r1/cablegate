¶1. (U) Summary:  The GOI's Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) and 
Gadjah Mada University hosted an August 29 seminar in Yogyakarta 
celebrating 30 years of U.S.-ASEAN ties.  Pol/C and Econ/C outlined 
strong U.S. support for the continued development of close political 
and economic ties between ASEAN and the U.S.  The seminar included a 
lively q&a session with active participation from the student 
audience.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) SPOTLIGHT ON COOPERATION:  On August 29, the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Gadjah Mada University (UGM), one 
of the Indonesia's leading schools, hosted a seminar entitled 
"ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership:  The Way Forward."  International 
relations students from UGM and surrounding universities attended 
the seminar, which was timed to commemorate 30 years of U.S.-ASEAN 
dialogue.  The audience included scholars and students from other 
ASEAN nations, as well as from China, Japan and South Korea. 
 
¶3.  (U) DEPLU Director General for ASEAN affairs Dian Triansyah 
Djani, UGM Dean for Faculty of Social Studies and Politics Dr. 
Mohtar Mas'oed, and the Regional Secretary of the Office of the 
Governor of Yogyakarta, Tri Harjun Ismadi, opened the seminar. 
(Note:  The Sultan of Yogyakarta, who also serves as governor, was 
supposed to participate, but was unable to make the event.)  All 
three  emphasized the importance of ASEAN engagement with the United 
States and the need to strengthen cooperation, particularly in the 
area of scholarships and student exchanges. 
 
¶4. (U) U.S. COMMITMENT:  Pol/C and Econ/C, speaking during separate 
panel sessions, described the development of substantial political 
and economic ties between ASEAN and the U.S. over the past 30 years. 
 Pol/C underlined that the United States views ASEAN as a key to 
peace and stability in the region.  He noted the agreement for 
further cooperation cemented in the Joint Vision Statement on the 
ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership signed in November 2005.  Pol/C also 
underscored that support for cooperation with ASEAN is also 
manifested in the U.S. Congress where Senator Lugar introduced 
Senate Resolution 110 earlier this year, marking the 30th 
anniversary of the Dialogue Relationship. 
 
¶5.  (U) Econ/C, during the session on economic and development 
cooperation, observed that ASEAN, with a combined population 
surpassed only by China and India, possessed a growing middle class 
and a skilled workforce.  The region served as an important trade 
partner for the U.S.  He pointed out that the U.S. shares ASEAN's 
goals of creating an integrated economic community, and maintaining 
a stable and prosperous economic environment in Southeast Asia.  He 
also underlined support for the ASEAN-U.S. TIFA and the USAID 
ADVANCE program. 
 
¶6. (U) OTHER REMARKS:  Bagas Hapsoro, DEPLU's Director for ASEAN 
Dialogue Partners and Inter-Regional Affairs, highlighted five areas 
of U.S.-ASEAN interest: 
 
-- (1) the fight against terrorism; 
-- (2) the promotion of democracy and the empowerment of people; 
-- (3) response to natural disasters; 
-- (4) energy and environmental conservation; and, 
-- (5) education and other people-to-people exchanges. 
 
He encouraged the U.S. to continue to strengthen cooperation with 
ASEAN in these areas, particularly in the field of educational 
exchanges. 
 
¶6.  (U) Bala Kumar Palaniappan, an external relations official from 
the ASEAN Secretariat, also spoke at the event.  Palaniappan, a 
Malaysian, noted the strengthening of U.S.-ASEAN cooperation in 
recent years, as well as the need to further expand ties. 
 
¶7.  (U) Q&A:  The seminar included lively questions from the 
audience.  The students directed most of their questions at the U.S. 
participants.  Question topics ranged from requests for more 
scholarships, to the importance of a continued U.S. presence in the 
region, to criticism of U.S. foreign policy, including in relation 
to Iraq.  Students also asked whether the U.S. felt threatened by 
China and why the U.S. has not signed the Kyoto Protocol on
