¶1.  (U) SUMMARY.  ConGen Medan hosted 20 prominent Muslim, 
Protestant, Catholic, Hindu, Buddhist and other North Sumatra civil 
society leaders at his residence on January 15 in joint 
commemoration of Religious Freedom Day and Martin Luther King Day, 
to compare religious freedom and inter-ethnic tolerance in the U.S. 
and Indonesia.  The discussion focused almost entirely on two of 
Indonesia's most sensitive religious freedom issues:  restrictions 
on the Islamic sect Ahmadiyyah and a controversial law requiring 
community support in order to establish new houses of worship.  The 
animated discussion came to an amicable consensus that the only way 
to deal with these types of religious controversies is through a 
heightened consciousness of tolerance.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) A group of 20 prominent civil society leaders representing 
Indonesia's major religions gathered for two hours at the ConGen 
residence on January 15 in joint commemoration of Religious Freedom 
Day and Martin Luther King Day.  Guests included representatives of 
the five major religions from the Forum for Religious Harmony, as 
well as clergy, scholars, women leaders, and the media. 
 
HOT BUTTON ISSUES RAISED 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (U) The head of the Coordination Body for Women's Organizations 
began the discussion by defending two of Indonesia's controversial 
actions restricting religious freedom. One restricted the activities 
of the Islamic sect Ahmadiyyah.  The decree on Ahmadiyyah restricted 
such activities as proselytizing.  The other action is a law 
requiring community support in order to establish new houses of 
worship.  This has hindered small Christian communities from 
worshipping in homes or opening up churches where their populations 
are small. 
 
¶4.  (U) ConGen explained why both issues infringe on freedom of 
religion and the how the U.S. Constitution protects such rights, 
including the rights of Muslims. Christians, Buddhists and Hindus 
then presented in-depth constitutional and theological reasons for 
why the houses of worship law violated both the spirit of Indonesian 
law and the Koran.  One Protestant leader stated that in Indonesia 
there are too many local laws concerning religion and not enough 
action by the Central Government to protect religious rights 
embedded in the Constitution.  Muslim leaders, including one of the 
provinces most respected theological scholars, basically agreed. 
Muslim and non-Muslim guests alike criticized zealots who have 
erected barriers between religions which did not exist before. 
 
¶5. (U) After a lively but civil discussion, the group came to a 
consensus that the solution to such inter-religious disputes lay in 
teaching young people tolerance and understanding from an early age. 
 They cited the U.S. as an example.  One Muslim scholar who had 
traveled to the U.S. on an IVLP noted that contrary to 
preconceptions that the U.S. discriminates against Muslims, he 
observed only tolerance.  He recounted observing a long 
Muslim-American parade through the main streets of one city which 
proceeded without incident. 
 
¶6. (U) This discussion was notable in that it calmly addressed 
issues which have led to heated differences of opinion and violence. 
 The consensus among Muslims and followers of other faiths was 
indicative of North Sumatra's proclivity for people of different 
faiths and religions to try to get along.  North Sumatra has major 
populations of Muslims, Protestants, Buddhists and Hindus and a 
diverse ethnic composition, which has contributed to tolerant 
attitudes in the interest of harmony.
