¶1.  (U)  This message requests the Department's guidance. 
Please see para 5. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Embassy Jakarta has reviewed Washington's 
draft diplomatic note (refmail) in response to the avian 
influenza lawsuit.  Embassy Jakarta recommends that the 
assertion of sovereign immunity be the core point in the 
note. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Embassy Jakarta welcomes Washington's decision to 
assert sovereign immunity in the avian influenza lawsuit that 
has been filed in Jakarta against the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and the USG.  Embassy Jakarta believes 
that sovereign immunity is the appropriate posture in this 
case and for that reason recommends placing the assertion of 
sovereign immunity before any statements on the allegations 
in the case (ref A). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Embassy Jakarta strongly recommends that any 
language on the merits of the case should be unembellished 
and clear. Please see Mission's proposed revised draft of the 
note in para 6 below.

provide interagency-cleared language along the lines of the 
proposed note below.

BEGIN TEXT 
 
The Embassy of the United States of America presents its 
compliments to the Department of Foreign Affairs of the 
Republic of Indonesia, and has the honor to refer to the 
Department's diplomatic note D.601/PO/VII/2008/59 forwarding 
the attached "Court Summons Letter" and related lawsuit 
brief.  The Court Summons Letter relates to proceedings 
brought by Sarmili against the World Health Organization 
(WHO) and the United States of America for the death of 
plaintiff's son from avian flu.  The Government of the United 
States understands that a hearing in the matter is scheduled 
on September 17, 2008, before the Central Jakarta State 
Court. 
 
The Embassy of the United States of America has the honor to 
draw the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs of 
the Republic of Indonesia to the immunity to which the United 
States of America is entitled as a matter of international 
law.  Moreover, the United States of America wishes to state 
that the allegations in the complaint regarding the conduct 
of the United States of America are on their face false and 
without credibility.  The United States of America views any 
attempt to use a national court as a forum to disseminate 
groundless allegations regarding the conduct of the World 
Health Organization, the United States of America, or other 
states and organizations in responding to outbreaks of 
disease and attempting to prevent its spread, as an abuse of

process. 
 
In light of the foregoing, the Embassy of the United States 
of America respectfully requests that the Department of 
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia take all steps 
available to it to cause the case to be dismissed prior to 
any hearing. 
 
The Embassy of the United States of America avails itself of 
this opportunity to renew to the Department of Foreign 
Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia the assurances of its 
highest consideration. 
 
Embassy of the United States of America, 
Jakarta, August 7, 2008
