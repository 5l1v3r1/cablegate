¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  A Muslim cleric is under investigation 
for marrying a 12-year old girl last August.  In reaction to 
a public outcry by child welfare advocates, several 
well-known Muslim leaders have denounced the cleric's action. 
 The unrepentant cleric appears to have, prima facie, 
violated several child protection laws and could face prison 
if charged and convicted.  The shocking case will hopefully 
raise public awareness re Indonesia's ongoing problem in 
trafficking in young women and girls.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A SHOCKING CASE 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An unusual, shocking case has sparked an outcry in 
Indonesia.  Muslim cleric Pujianto Cahyo Widianto, also known 
as "Syech Puji," faces possible charges of having illegal sex 
with a minor and violating the 1974 marriage law for his 
wedding to a 12-year old girl in Semarang, Central Java, in 
August.  The cleric, who claims he did nothing wrong, may 
have violated up to six laws related to child protection, 
marriage, health, labor and welfare.  The investigation is 
continuing. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The unrepentant cleric, who runs an Islamic 
boarding school, allegedly intends to marry up to seven 
girls, two in the immediate future aged nine and seven.  He 
claims he is emulating Islamic Prophet Muhammad.  Details of 
the case have been daily fodder in the news media.  According 
to press reports, Puji's current wife staged a contest and 
chose the 12-year old girl from among 20 "contestants."  The 
girl's parents have admitted that they agreed to the marriage 
in order to alleviate financial difficulties.  Although it 
was not registered with the state, they also felt the 
marriage was legal under religious law.  The 1974 Indonesian 
marriage law states that a woman must be 16 to marry legally. 
 
 
SPARKING A STRONG REACTION 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Child protection groups quickly reacted to the 
press reports.  The Network for Women and Children in 
Semarang, an NGO, said the marriage constituted exploitation 
of a minor and urged the police to investigate the case. 
Indonesia's independent Child Protection Commission (KPAI) 
immediately sent a team to Semarang to investigate.  Hadi 
Supeno of KPAI told us he feared others would allow their 
children to marry the cleric, as he has many followers, which 
would ultimately victimize more children.  Liberal 
Indonesians have underscored that the investigation needs to 
continue and that the GOI should charge the cleric, while 
child protection agencies take care of the victim. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Interestingly, after liberal Indonesians led the 
initial charge, several Muslim leaders have subsequently 
condemned the "marriage."   The following Muslim 
leaders--including key members of the important Indonesian 
Council of Clerics (MUI)--made strong statements: 
 
--MUI leader Umar Shihab said "Men should marry adults, there 
are a lot of other prospective brides around.  Why did he 
marry a 12 year old..the poor girl?"  he said. 
 
--MUI Chair Amidhan Shaberah said, "A legal marriage is 
carried out when the female is at least 16 years old and the 
male at least 18, in accordance with the marriage law of 
¶1974.  This marriage is illegal, both according to Indonesian 
and religious law,"  he said. 
 
--Minister of Religious Affairs Maftuh Basyuni issued a 
statement saying that the marriage violated Indonesian law 
 
JAKARTA 00002038  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
and urging law enforcement authorities to act quickly on the 
case. 
 
-- Member of Parliament Zulkieflimansyah from the 
Islamic-oriented Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) condemned 
Puji's action, telling us it was against the law and 
inconsistent with Islamic values. 
 
HIGHLIGHTING TRAFFICKING PROBLEM 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Muslim leaders have stepped to the plate and made 
strong statements.  We have urged a contact in the MUI to 
urge that organization as a body to condemn the cleric's 
action.  Though the Puji case has its unique aspects to be 
sure, hopefully it can bring further attention to Indonesia's 
problem in trafficking in young women and girls.  (Note:  It 
is not uncommon in Indonesia for men to marry young women in 
order to get around trafficking in persons laws. 
Additionally, foreign Muslim men sometimes come to Indonesia 
and engage in contract marriages, paying up to USD 20,000 for 
a short-term marriage to a young women, for example.)
