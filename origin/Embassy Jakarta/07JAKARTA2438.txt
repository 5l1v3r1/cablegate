SUBJECT: INDONESIA - CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REQUIREMENT 
CREATES CONFUSION 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  The new limited liability company law has created 
great confusion in the business community by mandating that "natural 
resources" companies engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
activities.  The law is very vague and domestic business leaders 
have already raised objections.  International businesses chambers, 
including the American Chamber of Commerce are still unsure what the 
potential impact could be.  Attention is now focused on the Ministry 
of Finance, which will draft the implementing regulations  t flesh 
out the precise CS requireements companie will face.  End Summary. 
 
Limited Liability Legilation: 
Surprise on Corporate Social Responsibilty 
------------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Parliament (DPR) passed draft a new law n limited 
liability companies on July 20, 2007, hich awaits Presidential 
signature and numbering. Article 74 of this law has created a great 
dealof concern among both foreign and domestic busineses in 
Indonesia.  The article states that "resouce based" companies are 
obligated to contribute o corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
programs. (See unofficial translation at paragraph 7).  The 
inclusion of this article came as a surprise to any business 
leaders and was reportedly insertedat the last minute by Members of 
Parliament. 
 
ndonesian Business Objects 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce KADIN) and other business 
associations have issud a joint statement object ing to Article 74. 
KADN Chairman Hidayat noted that KADIN would firmly rject any 
implementing regulations (which have yetto be promulgated by the 
Ministry of Finance) tht would require a certain percentage of 
profit b diverted to CSR.  Accordi(ng to KADIN, such a requrement 
would simply constitute a tax on business  Rafendi Djamin, 
coordinator of Human Rights Wath Group, said a legal instrument is 
needed to foce companies to be socially responsible and was plased 
that Indonesia woul(d be the first country t pass such  a law. 
 
Intenational Business Confused 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The American Chamber of Commr"ce (AmCham) held a 
well-attended meeting of ove  20 companies on August 9 to discuss 
the CSR legislation.  AmCham members commented that Article 44 - as 
currently drafted and in the absence of ip lementing regulations - 
is unclear on several cuunts.  Specifically, the new law: 
 
-- fails to df"ine CSR; 
-- does not designate a government agency to oversee CSR 
activities; 
-- does not discuss possible sanctions for noncompliance; 
-- desiga te approved recipients of CSR funds; or 
-- clarffy what is meant by a "natural resource" company. 
 
 
 
Not all AmCham members are worried.  One representative of a major 
oil and gas company suggested hhat western firms have "nothing to 
worry about" i(nce they already have significant CSR programs.AAmCham members concluded it would be wise to team p  with other 
business chambers, to discuss international best practices of CSR 
with the relevant mnnistries, and to educate GOI officials and 
Parliament about what many businesses are already doing in CSR. 
 
Re-Election Pork? 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) There are several theories about what led Parliament to 
insert this last-minute clause into the legislation.  One theory is 
that it is all about pork;  since many officials are being elected 
for the first time, the CSR Article 74 may be an attempt by Members 
of Parliament to show constituencies they are improving their 
localities.  This may be an attempt to bring re-election pork to 
home districts.  Another theory suggests that domestic and regional 
companies are more the target than western companies.  Domestic and

Asian companies, as a generalization, tend to do less community 
development and CSR than western ones.  A related issue is that 
under current law, extractive industry companies are required to 
make an environmental impact statement and then file an 
environmental mitigation plan to the Ministry of Environment.  Once 
they are finished extracting the resources, they are required to 
implement the environmental mitigation plan.  However, many smaller 
Indonesian firms go out of business at the end of the resource 
extraction and never implement the mitigation plan, leaving the 
clean-up to the GOI or sub-national governments.  Thus one goal of 
the Article 74 may be to receive CSR benefits "up front" from 
domestic companies. 
 
Comment: No implementation? 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The CSR Article 74 seems to be an example of inexperienced 
legislators, who lack both expert staff and an adequate consultative 
process, passing confused and confusing legislation.  The business 
community has three months to provide comments on the law to the 
Ministry of Justice and Human Rights before implementing regulations 
are formulated.  Prominent business leader and Chairman of the 
Indonesian Employers' Association, Sofyan Wanandi, is recommending 
that the CSR requirement not be implemented, according to the head 
of the International Business Council, Peter Fanning.  Many pieces 
of legislation in Indonesia which can neither be properly 
implemented nor enforced, simply die on the vine.  Alternately, the 
relevant Ministry delays the regulations for years.  The CSR Article 
74, is so garbled, confused and hastily drafted (without 
consultation), it may suffer a similar fate.
