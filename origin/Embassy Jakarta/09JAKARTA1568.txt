FOR SUITABLE U.S. DELEGATION 
 
REF: JAKARTA 1509 
 
¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) will 
inaugurate Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for his second term as 
President and Boediono (one name only) as Vice President on 
October 20.  Although the MPR does not plan to send official 
invitations to foreign delegations, we have been told that it 
would welcome delegations from countries which wish to send 
them. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) We understand that Australia is sending its Prime 
Minister to the inauguration.  Several ASEAN countries are 
reportedly planning to send their heads of state.  New 
Zealand is considering sending its Foreign Minister.  The 
Japanese Embassy has indicated privately that its Foreign 
Minister may attend, but told us that it awaits a signal on 
the level of U.S. participation.  We do not believe that 
European states will be sending high-level delegations. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Mission believes that the U.S. 
should send a suitable delegation headed by someone who is 
well-known and perhaps has connections to Asia and Indonesia. 
 We believe that the delegation's stature should be 
commensurate with the growing importance of the U.S.- 
Indonesia relationship.  We would appreciate Washington's 
near-term review of this matter.  END ACTION REQUEST.
