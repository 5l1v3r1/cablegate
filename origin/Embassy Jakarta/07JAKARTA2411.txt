¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) 
Selection Committee is evaluating new commissioners for a four-year 
term beginning late December 2007.  The new commissioners will lead 
the KPK at a critical time, determining the future direction of the 
KPK and the larger anti-corruption reform campaign in Indonesia. 
The KPK Selection Committee will recommend 10 candidates through the 
President by mid-September and the Parliament will select five 
commissioners from that list by December.  These commissioners will 
have a critical role in continuing anti-corruption reform throughout 
the government and work to establish the longer-term institutional 
role of the KPK and ACC within the judicial framework of Indonesia. 
The long-term status of the KPK and attendant Anti-Corruption Court 
(ACC) - the government's premier anti-corruption bodies - are 
uncertain after a December 2006 Constitutional Court decision ruled 
that the process used to create the ACC was unconstitutional.  End 
Summary. 
 
KPK Selection to be Completed by December 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The KPK Selection Committee (SC) oversees the initial phases 
of identifying commissioner candidates.  The SC is a 15-member 
committee composed of academics, civil society, and government 
officials and headed by the State Minister for Administrative Reform 
Tauffiq Effendi.  The SC received 662 applications for the 
commissioner positions, reducing the list to 465 through 
administrative selection criteria.  The field was cut to 256 through 
written exams.  The field was further reduced to 75 candidates 
through profile assessments, which included the support of the U.S. 
human resources company Dunamis.  The SC then selected 26 finalists 
for further testing and public interviews.  Amien Sunaryadi, 
regarded as a quiet, effective reformer within the KPK, is the only 
current commissioner on the list of 26 candidates.  Waluyo, KPK 
Deputy for Prevention, Iswan Helmi, a KPK Director for Preliminary 
Investigations, and M. Yasin, Director of Research, are also 
candidates. 
 
¶3. (U) The following is an overview of the remaining steps in the 
KPK commissioner selection process: 
 
-- September 3-5: Final public interviews by SC at Hotel Borobudur. 
Each candidate has a one-hour interview.  Public invited to observe, 
but only the SC poses questions. 
 
-- September 6: SC recommends 10 candidates to President Yudhoyono. 
SC makes decision based on public interviews as well as private 
interviews and further Dunamis testing, including psychological 
exams, "integrity tests," writing exams, and management capability 
testing. 
 
-- September 8: SC plans to meet with President to discuss list of 
candidates. 
 
-- Mid-September: President presents list of 10 candidates to 
Parliament. 
 
-- September - December: Parliament conducts interviews and gathers 
further information on candidates, conducting overall "fit and 
proper" tests.  Work in Parliament will be based in Commission III 
on Law and Security. 
 
-- Early-December: Parliament selects the five commissioners. 
 
-- Late-December: Commissioners sworn in.  Judicial Watch Coalition 
- a group of six NGOs including Partnership for Governance Reform in 
Indonesia (Kemitraan), Indonesia Corruption Watch, MAPPI, LEIP, and 
KRHN - will offer induction training and team-building workshops.

¶4. (SBU) Emboffs met with two KPK commissioners, Amien Sunaryadi and 
Erry Riyana, who are considered the leading reformers in the KPK. 
Sunaryadi and Riyana expressed optimism about the selection process, 
stating that the process has improved since its first use four years 
ago.  The SC was enlarged from nine to 15; the SC has a more diverse 
membership with fewer bureaucrats; and the SC was given more time 
for its selection process.  Riyana stated that Minister Effendi will 
likely informally consult with President Yudhoyono before Effendi 
presents the final list to him. 
 
KPK Overview and Role of Commissioners 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The KPK was established in 2002 in order to investigate and 
prosecute high-profile corruption cases, particularly cases 
involving law enforcement and government executives, cases over Rp 1 
billion  ($109,000), and cases of public attention.  The KPK is the 
only institution which can prosecute cases in the Anti-Corruption 
Court (ACC).  The ACC and KPK have occupied a central role in 
President Yudhoyono's broader anti-corruption reform campaign.  A 
December 2006 Constitutional Court ruling, however, placed the 
future of the KPK and ACC in question.  The court declared the 
process which created the ACC unconstitutional, limiting its mandate 
to three years unless new legislation correcting the constitutional 
deficiencies is adopted within that timeframe (see reftel A).  The 
KPK and ACC also face challenges due to the disparity between its 
vast mandate and its limited resources.  Several groups, including 
the Ministry of Law and Human Rights and a coalition of NGOs, are 
working on draft legislation to address the Constitutional Court 
decision and institutionalize the role of the ACC and KPK (see 
reftel B). USAID has been providing technical assistance on this 
current draft, which preserves the power of the KPK and the ACC's 
continued role.  Civil society leaders are optimistic that 
legislation will be passed by the December 2009 deadline. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The five KPK commissioners are responsible for the overall 
leadership of the anti-corruption body and setting a strategic 
direction for their reform agenda.  The current commissioners are: 
Taufieqrachman Ruki (chair), Amien Sunaryadi, Sjahruddin Rasul, 
Tumpak Hatorangan Panggabean, and Erry Riyana Hardjapamekas. 
Multiple sources regard Amien Sunaryadi and Erry Riyana as effective 
commissioners committed to anti-corruption reform, whereas the other 
three commissioners are considered to be ineffective at best, 
obstructive at worst. 
 
Comment: New Leaders, New Opportunity 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The KPK commissioners' role extends beyond the 
administration of an investigative and prosecutorial commission and 
includes a symbolic and strategic role in the anti-corruption reform 
campaign throughout the Indonesian government.  These commissioners 
will influence the anti-corruption reform agenda throughout the 
government and work to establish the longer-term role of the KPK 
within the judicial framework of Indonesia.  The KPK and ACC have 
encountered resistance, particularly in some corners of Parliament. 
Quiet encouragement from the Embassy on this selection process, 
particularly to Parliament, will allow the KPK and ACC to further 
build its institutional role and capacity within the larger GOI 
anti-corruption reform campaign.
