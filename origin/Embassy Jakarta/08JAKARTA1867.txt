SUBJECT: URGENT NEED TO REVISE TWO VETTING DECISIONS BASED 
ON MISTAKEN IDENTITY 
 
REF: JAKARTA 1754 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request.  See paragraph 5. 
 
¶2. (U) SUMMARY:  DRL has rejected two candidates based on 
mistaken identity.  Mission has thoroughly vetted both 
candidates under Leahy guidelines, checking multiple sources, 
and we are absolutely certain that the two individuals in 
question vet clean.  The derogatory information provided by 
DRL was for two entirely different individuals.  Post 
requests DRL reevaluate its findings and allow the candidates 
to participate in USG-funded training exercises.  Response is 
needed by October 8.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U) In an email chain dated October 2, 2008, DRL 
furnished derogatory information against two candidates 
listed in reftel, Indonesia Security Force Vetting Request, 
ICITAP-25-2008.  As part of the Leahy vetting process, Post 
has reviewed the information and determined that DRL's 
conclusions were not based on credible evidence.  In both 
cases, the candidates are not the individuals involved in the 
activities cited. 
 
¶4.  (U) Sutrisno (one name only), Senior Police Commissioner 
in the Indonesian National Police (INP), was rejected by DRL 
based on derogatory information for a different individual, 
with a similar name, a Lieutenant Sutrisno (also one name 
only) of the Indonesian military (TNI).  The two Sutrisnos 
have different ranks and positions and have never served in 
the same organization.  Lt. Sutrisno was linked to a massacre 
in Bobonaro District, East Timor in 1999.  Our candidate, 
Commissioner Sutrisno, was assigned to police Mid-Level 
Management School that same year and was not in East Timor. 
The candidate is not the individual cited by DRL and this 
mistake was due to a naming mismatch. 
 
¶5.  (U) In a second case, Syaiful Bahri, administrator at the 
Indonesian Police Academy (AKPOL), was rejected based on 
information linking the candidate to terrorist suspects 
arrested in connection to the 2004 bombing of the Australian 
Embassy in Jakarta.  Open source information states, 
&Syaiful Bahri, alias Apuy, has been in police custody since 
November 20048; please see DRL's reference 
(http://old.thejakartapost.com/yearender/nat0 2.asp). Again, 
the candidate is not the individual cited in information 
provided by DRL.  The candidate is a career police officer 
and currently a police commissioner.  The other Syaiful 
Bahri, "Apuy" is a civilian, initially selected as a suicide 
bomber for the 2004 Australian Embassy bombing, convicted of 
terrorism for his role in that bombing, and is now in prison. 
 This case also is clearly a naming mismatch. 
 
¶6.  (U) ACTION REQUEST:  In each instance, Mission completed 
Leahy vetting of the candidates prior to submitting a request 
to DRL.  Post did not find any credible evidence of gross 
violations of human rights for the two candidates.  Post 
requests that DRL approve these two individuals by October 8, 
2008 for training to commence on October 13, 2008.  END 
ACTION REQUEST.
