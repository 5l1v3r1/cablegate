¶1.  (U)  The following message is Sensitive but Unclassified. 
 Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Indonesia's fourth president and a 
champion of democracy, diversity and human rights, 
Abdurrahman "Gus Dur" Wahid died in Jakarta on December 30 at 
the age of 69.  Gus Dur--who had suffered from poor health 
for years--will be remembered for his role in the reform of 
Indonesia following the fall of Suharto in 1998 and as the 
moderate leader of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the world's largest 
Muslin organization with a membership of upwards of 40 
million.  President Yudhoyono called for a week of national 
mourning beginning December 31, the day of the state funeral 
which will be held in East Java.  The Ambassador paid his 
respects to the family of Gus Dur late on December 30.  Para 
5 includes suggested language for a condolence message from 
the Secretary. END SUMMARY. 
 
GUS DUR'S LEGACY 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Gus Dur will be remembered both domestically and 
internationally as a champion of democracy, diversity and 
human rights.  During the first part of his career, he was 
heavily engaged in NU activities.  As leader of NU, the 
world's largest Muslim organization, he played a key role in 
modernizing the organization.  As a first step, Wahid pushed 
for NU to withdraw from politics so that it could serve as an 
honest broker on behalf of its members.  He later turned his 
attention to improving the quality of education at NU-run 
pesantrens (Islamic boarding schools). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In 1998, Wahid served as an advisor to the moderate 
Muslim political party, PKB, and ran for president in 1999. 
After assuming the presidency, he immediately abolished the 
Ministry of Information, which under Suharto kept a tight 
rein on the media.  Wahid took constructive steps to resolve 
demands for independence in Aceh and Papua.  He pushed for 
diplomatic relations with Israel.  He helped free Indonesian 
Chinese from prejudice.  He also took on the military and 
demanded that it begin to disengage from many of its business 
ventures.  Gus Dur was a notoriously poor manager and there 
were allegations of corruption, and in July 2001 the 
Parliament impeached him. 
 
INDONESIA IN MOURNING 
 
¶5.  (U) Wahid's body was flown the morning of December 31 to 
Jombang, East Java, where he will be buried alongside his 
father and grandfather.  Wahid's family will ceremonially 
hand over his body to President Yudhoyono at the state 
funeral.  In line with Indonesian tradition, Ambassador Hume 
paid a condolence call on Wahid's family the night of 
December 30. 
 
SUGGESTED LANGUAGE FOR CONDOLENCE MESSAGE 
 
¶6.  (U) Mission recommends that the Secretary send a 
condolence message soon.  Following is our proposed text for 
a message to President Yudhoyono: 
 
Begin text: 
 
           On behalf of President Obama and the American 
people, I extend my condolences to President Wahid's family 
and the Indonesian people. 
 
    President Wahid guided his country through the difficult 
years of Indonesia's democratic transition with wisdom, 
tolerance and kindness.  People around the world will 
remember him as a champion of democracy, diversity and human 
rights.  His service to his country, and the global 
community, will continue to inspire us for generations to 
come. 
 
    My sympathies are with you and the Indonesian people.
