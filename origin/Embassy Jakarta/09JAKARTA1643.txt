¶1.  This is an action request.  Please see paras 2 and 8. 
 
¶2.  Action request:  Mission requests USAID Office of U.S. Foreign 
Disaster Assistance (OFDA) consideration, approval and transmission 
of fund cite to allow for the transfer of USD300, 000 to support 
emergency response interventions for 7.6 earthquake in West Sumatra 
Province on Wednesday, September 30, 2009.  The Charge d'Affaires 
has determined that the disaster is of sufficient magnitude that it 
is beyond the capacity of local entities to respond adequately, the 
Government of Indonesia desires and will accept U.S. Government 
assistance, and it is in the best interest of the USG to respond. 
 
¶3.  An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the USGS Richter scale struck 
West Sumatra Province, on Wednesday September 30, 2009 at 17:16 
local time affecting Padang, the capital city of the province, and 
the adjoining Pariaman district.  The epicenter of the earthquake 
was located at approximately 57 kilometers southwest of Pariaman. 
Local media reported that tremors were felt in several cities in 
Medan, Jambi, Pekanbaru, as well as in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. 
A second earthquake measuring 5.5 on Richter scale occurred at 17:38 
hours; with the epicenter at approximately 22 kilometers southwest 
of Pariaman.  Due to the significant damage caused by the 
earthquake, Charge d'Affaires Theodore Osius hereby declares a 
disaster and requests USD50, 000 in disaster assistance authority 
funds, as well as an additional USD250, 000 to support emergency 
response interventions.  The funding will be used to support 
emergency distributions of non-food items. 
 
¶4.  All known American citizens in the area are accounted for.  We 
do not believe any American citizens were killed; however, one has 
been injured in the earthquake and is receiving appropriate care. 
 
¶5.  Initial reports state that 200 people have died, hundreds are 
injured and many are still trapped in collapsed buildings in the 
affected areas.  Access to the affected area is difficult due to 
damage to roads and bridges from the quakes and subsequent 
landslides. 
 
¶6.  President Yudhoyono and six GOI Ministers departed for West 
Sumatra this morning to assess conditions and provide initial 
response, including the Ministers of Social Affairs, Health, Public 
Works, Home Affairs, Transportation and the Coordinating Minister 
for People's Welfare. 
 
¶7. USAID/Indonesia and USAID/OFDA Bangkok staff are maintaining 
close coordination and expect to shortly make determinations on the 
most appropriate emergency interventions to be supported with USG 
assistance.  USAID/Indonesia will assume responsibility for all 
related contracting and the disbursement of the funds. 
 
¶8. In light of the magnitude of the quake and the request for 
assistance from the Government of Indonesia, the Embassy requests 
that OFDA deploy a DART team to Indonesia to assist with the 
response to the quake. 
 
¶9.  Post will request Washington to issue a condolence message 
septel.
