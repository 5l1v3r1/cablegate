¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Members of Indonesia's USG-sponsored Task 
Force on Terrorism and Transnational Crime at the Attorney 
General's Office (AGO) led a best practices training session 
for regional prosecutors on May 28-29.  Mission--using S/CT 
and INL-funded grants--sponsored the training, which included 
sessions on counterterrorism, money laundering, intellectual 
property rights, cybercrime and human trafficking.  The 
session is a component of a wider effort to professionalize 
the AGO and demonstrated the significant benefits of U.S. 
investment in Indonesia's law enforcement institutions.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
USG HELPS CREATE ELITE TASK FORCE 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Established in 2006, the Attorney General's Office 
(AGO) Task Force on Terrorism and Transnational Crime has 
evolved into an elite law enforcement body.   The task force 
has a perfect record in prosecuting terrorism cases.  The 
task force was established through a 2005 Letter of Agreement 
(LOA) between the AGO and Mission to provide $750,000 of USG 
assistance, including renovated office space, computers, 
equipment, and regular training on prosecutorial best 
practices.  A 2007 amendment added Intellectual Property 
Rights to the task force's work and committed an additional 
$200,000 in funds from INL and S/CT.  Assistance to the task 
force is jointly overseen by Mission's DOJ Office of Overseas 
Prosecutor Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) 
Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) and the Political Section. 
 
TRAINING SESSIONS 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On May 28-29, the USG sponsored a prosecutorial 
training workshop for 30 prosecutors from Lombok and Sumbawa 
districts in central Indonesia.  This was the second of a 
series of regional programs funded through the INL-funded LOA 
and administered through Mission's DOJ/OPDAT office.  The 
first program was in Yogyakarta, central Java, in April and 
the next will take place in Kalimantan in central Indonesia 
in August.  The training sessions are part of a wider effort 
to build the AGO's capability in handling complex crimes 
(reftel A). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Members of the task force led sessions on 
prosecuting terrorism, money laundering, human trafficking, 
and intellectual property rights crimes.  In each session, 
the task force prosecutor covered the relevant laws needed to 
prosecute each type of case, outlined obstacles in 
prosecuting the cases and shared best practices.  During the 
session on terrorism, the presenter highlighted the benefits 
of close collaboration with the police--something which 
Indonesian prosecutors have not always done.  This close 
coordination with the Indonesian police, beginning in the 
early stages of an investigation, was one of the key factors 
in the task force's impressive 100% conviction rate in 
terrorism cases. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The program covered complex crimes, which many 
prosecutors do not fully understand.  Two sessions focused on 
crimes involving money laundering and intellectual property 
rights, two areas that are new to the Lombok prosecutors. 
Highlights included: 
 
-- In the money laundering session, task force members 
described different ways a criminal could launder money and 
the types of cases that might include money laundering. 
-- In the intellectual property rights session, the 
prosecutor described why cultural differences regarding ideas 
of ownership make intellectual property rights difficult 
cases to prosecute in Indonesia.  This session was designed 
to introduce the topic to the regional prosecutors. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The course also covered the use of new technologies 
in prosecuting criminals.  DOJ/OPDAT RLA led a cybercrime 
study case session to show how the internet can be used to 
prosecute both cybercrime cases and traditional cases.  The 
 
JAKARTA 00000963  002 OF 002 
 
 
AGO's Legal Bureau used the training program as an 
opportunity to introduce the AGO's newly launched website to 
the participants via interactive training.  The new website 
contains information on court decisions, court news, and the 
AGO's bureaucratic reform process. 
 
SPECIALIZATION A KEY TO SUCCESS 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Members of the Terrorism and Transnational Crime 
Task Force attribute their success to the development of a 
professional prosecutorial service.  The task force's 
specialization is unique in the AGO (reftel B) and the 
members have now developed extensive experience handling 
terrorism cases, allowing the group to handle more complex 
cases.  Specialization has also allowed the task force to 
develop strong collaborative links with the police who handle 
the same crimes.  These training sessions have both bolstered 
the task force's own expertise and helped transfer that 
expertise to prosecutors who are not based in Jakarta.  The 
training workshops build on a wider effort to transform the 
AGO from a traditional bureaucracy to a more professional 
prosecutorial service capable of handling complex crimes (ref 
A).  This effort to boost prosecutorial capabilities 
demonstrates the significant payoff of U.S. investment in 
Indonesian law enforcement institutions.
