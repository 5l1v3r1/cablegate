REF: STATE 059852 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel request, Post conveyed to Indonesian Presidential 
Advisor and Spokesman Dino Djalal the importance of the final 
preparatory meeting of the Major Economies Forum (MEF) next week. 
The Charge d'Affaires (CDA) highlighted that the June 22-23 meeting 
in Mexico will begin preparing a Leaders' Statement for the planned 
MEF Leaders' Meeting in July, noting that this is the first summit 
over which President Obama will preside.  He asked that the 
Indonesian delegation be ready to work creatively toward an 
ambitious outcome for leaders -- one which will make a significant 
contribution to the international climate talks in Copenhagen this 
December. 
 
¶2. (U) Post also conveyed this message to deputies/advisors of 
Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar.  According to his staff, 
Minister Witoelar cannot participate in the Mexico meeting. 
Instead, he will be in Geneva for meetings of the Basel Convention. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post cautions that the President's Office and Government of 
Indonesia (GOI) ministries might not be able to give this matter the 
timely attention it deserves, given the imminent Indonesian 
presidential elections on July 8.
