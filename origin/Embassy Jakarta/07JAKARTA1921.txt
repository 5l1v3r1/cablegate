¶1. (SBU) We delivered Department's offer and rationale (ref 
a) to Harry Purwanto, Director for North and Central American 
Affairs at the Indonesian Department of Foreign Relations, on 
June 12.  We noted we had encouraged the government of 
Indonesia to consider a blanket agreement when completing the 
assurances for the transfer of C-130 parts from Australia in 
2006 (refs b-d). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Purwanto said he would discuss the question with the 
Indonesian Department of Defense and inform us of any GOI 
interest.  He said it was his understanding that Indonesia 
intended to use single rather blanket assurances for the few 
transfers it might need from third countries.  We pointed out 
the blanket assurances were a convenience regardless of the 
number of potential transfers, and Indonesia would likely 
have need of such transfers in the future, given its use of 
U.S.-origin equipment. 
 
¶3. (U) We noted that responses should reach Washington by 
August 10.  We will report any further responses septel.
