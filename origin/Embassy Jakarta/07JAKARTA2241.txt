SUBJECT: FACING ISLAMIST PROTESTERS, MISS UNIVERSE AND 
ENTOURAGE CUT TRIP SHORT 
 
 
¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2. (U) The reigning Miss Universe, Japanese national Riyo 
Mori, recently visited Indonesia on a promotional tour. 
After visiting Jakarta and making several planned stops at 
venues in Bandung, West Java, she and her entourage were 
forced to cut short their trip to the city on August 10 
because of Islamist students who were holding a rowdy public 
protest.  The students  asserted that the Miss Universe 
contest was "immoral" and "against Islamic values." 
Concerned about the protest, Mori canceled the rest of the 
Bandung program and left Indonesia the next day. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The actual rally in Bandung was relatively small. 
Less than 100 protesters turned out in front of Mori's hotel, 
most of them affiliated with a group called the 
"Anti-Pornography and Anti-Porno Action Alliance."  The 
alliance includes the militant Islamic Defenders' Front 
(FPI), the Islamic Youth Movement (GPI), and the Muslim 
Students Action Union (KAMMI), a student organization closely 
associated with the Islamist Prosperous Justice Party (PKS). 
Police outnumbered protesters and there were no reports of 
violence or arrests.  According to Azfuari Azis, who helped 
arrange Mori's trip on behalf of the Indonesian pageant, the 
protestors carried signs demanding that Indonesia ban 
pornography and one banner -- echoing Sukarno,s infamous 
rejection of U.S. aid in 1963 -- stated a not particularly 
catchy:  "Go to Hell Miss Universe."  He noted that while 
Mori was never under any threat of violence, organizers 
thought it best to cut her tour of Indonesia short. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) FPI and Allies Still Active:  After effective 
police action, the FPI's freedom of maneuver has gone down 
over the years from the time when it used to launch local 
"sweeps" meant to intimidate foreigners and force them to 
leave Indonesia.  The treatment accorded Miss Universe, 
however, while rare (though also experienced by the 
publishers of the Indonesian edition of "Playboy"), serves as 
a reminder that the FPI and its allies are still active.
