¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  Largely peaceful rallies were held 
throughout Indonesia to commemorate International 
Anti-Corruption Day on December 9.  The turnout was far lower 
than originally predicted.  Civil society remains firmly 
committed to pressing the anti-corruption message and social 
networking sites remain active.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U) Thousands of Indonesians peacefully took to the 
streets on December 9 in commemoration of International 
Anti-Corruption Day.  Demonstrations were held in all major 
cities with participation ranging from an estimated high of 
10,000 plus in Jakarta to about 400 in Surabaya in eastern 
Java.  The only reported incidence of violence was in 
Makassar, South Sulawesi.  A KFC close to the South 
Sulawesi's governor's office came under attack and sustained 
minor damage.  No one was reportedly injured in the incident. 
 (Note:  The incident did not have anti-U.S. overtones.  Due 
to its location, this KFC has come under attack several 
times.)  The primary rallying cry was for Indonesia to free 
itself from corruption and for the government to thoroughly 
investigate all alleged corruption cases. 
 
¶4.  (U) In the lead up to December 9, local media was 
predicting that there would be massive demonstrations which 
had the potential to become violent.  Thus, the relatively 
small rallies and marches were something of a letdown for 
anti-corruption activists.  Mission observers reported that 
in several locations street performers and vendors had seized 
the opportunity to make money and that there was a festive 
air to the rallies.  Even the Corruption Eradication 
Commission (KPK), Indonesia's national anti-corruption 
committee, held a more low key commemorative ceremony than in 
years past. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Although nearly 20 groups participated in the 
December 9 commemoration, two leading groups--Transparency 
International Indonesia and Indonesia Corruption 
Watch--declined to participate.  The two groups broke with 
the other organizations because they wanted to keep the rally 
focused on the issue of anti-corruption rather than target 
specific political leaders or parties (as some activists had 
done).  Several civil society leaders stressed that the low 
turn-out was not an indication of a lack of concern about 
eliminating corruption but simply in-fighting among the NGO 
community.  They stressed that they would continue to press 
for reform.  Social networking sites remain active in 
pressing the anti-corruption message.
