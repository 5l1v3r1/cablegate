SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: TIER 2 WATCH LIST ACTION PLAN 
FOR INDONESIA 
 
REF: STATE 123273 (DEMARCHE REQUEST) 
 
¶1. (U) On August 1, we met with Ferry Adamhar, Director of 
the Department of Foreign Affairs' Directorate for the 
Protection of Indonesian Citizens and Legal Entities, to 
deliver the demarche contained reftel.  Mr. Adamhar welcomed 
our points and said he would coordinate the matter within the 
GOI. 
 
¶2. (U) On August 7, we met with Maswita Djaya, Deputy 
Minister for Women's Empowerment in the Coordinating Ministry 
of Social Welfare, and on August 8 we met with Sumarni Dawam 
Raharjo, the Deputy Minister for Child and Welfare Protection 
at the Ministry of Women's Empowerment to deliver the 
demarche contained reftel and discuss the GOI's preparations 
for the interim assessment.  Both Maswita Djaya and Sumarni 
Dawam Raharjo enthusiastically welcomed the short and 
long-term action plans and thanked the USG for its continued 
support for the GOI's anti-trafficking efforts. 
 
¶3. (U) Both Maswita Djaya and Sumarni Dawam Raharjo discussed 
the importance of the anti-trafficking legislation and 
acknowledged the GOI could not expect to graduate from its 
current Watch List status without such legislation.  Maswita 
expressed her hope the legislation would pass by the end of 
the year.  Maswita noted the July 25 passage of the Witness 
Protection Law in the DPR and emphasized this law would 
significantly bolster the GOI's anti-trafficking efforts. 
 
¶4. (U) Noting the pervasiveness of debt bondage within the 
Indonesian migrant worker community, Maswita discussed a 
recent Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of 
Manpower and Bank Mandiri, an Indonesian State bank, which 
will result in an 11 million dollar fund for impoverished 
migrant workers.  Migrant workers will be able to borrow from 
the fund to pay recruiters and avoid crippling debt 
arrangements with the shadowy recruiting agencies. 
 
¶5. (U) Maswita also trumpeted a recent Coordinating Ministry 
of Social Welfare initiative to create anti-trafficking task 
forces at the provincial and district levels.  Next month the 
Ministry will open its flagship office in the Kutai 
Kartanegara district in Kalimantan.  Maswita underscored the 
importance of establishing such offices in transit and border 
areas throughout the country.  Maswita praised the technical 
assistance provided by the Solidarity Center and the 
International Catholic Migration Commission for these task 
forces with USG funding. 
 
¶6. (U) On the subject of corruption, Maswita underscored her 
Ministry's ongoing commitment to continue the battle against 
corruption, citing its cooperation with the Corruption 
Eradication Commission (KPK). 
 
¶7. (U) Maswita noted the Coordinating Ministry of Social 
Welfare dedicated approximately 55 thousand dollars from the 
FY06 state budget in support of the following 
anti-trafficking measures: 
- The establishment of a trial program to help trafficking 
victims reintegrate into society and avoid becoming second 
time trafficking victims. 
- The establishment of a shelter in Batam for trafficking 
victims. 
- An educational pilot program in East Java and East Nusa 
Tenggara to raise awareness of trafficking among housewives, 
religious leaders, out-of-school children, and parents. 
 
¶8. (U) Despite the extensive work being carried out by her 
Ministry and throughout the GOI, Maswita emphasized the 
ongoing challenges involved in battling trafficking, citing 
specifically: a limited budget; a lack of awareness of the 
trafficking issue across the full range of government 
agencies; the uneven collection of data related to 
trafficking, especially with respect to prosecutions and 
investigations; and the desperate need for capacity building 
in the GOI's ability to report on and collect information 
about trafficking within Indonesia's borders. 
 
¶9. (U) Sumarni Dawam Raharjo reinforced many of the same 
points made by Maswita and added that the GOI would strive 
for enhanced cooperation with Malaysia on trafficking issues. 
 Sumarni further noted she would share the short and 
long-term action plans with all of the members of the GOI's 
national task force on trafficking; she reported the group 
would next meet on August 10.
