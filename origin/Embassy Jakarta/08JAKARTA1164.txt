 ¶1. (U) In a meeting on May 16, 2008 with Directorate General 
of Sea Transportation Director of Sea and Coast Guard Control 
and Security Djoni Algamar, Deputy Untung (one name only) and 
Head of Security Affairs Muhklish Tohepaly, they indicated 
initial interest in the Global Maritime Partnerships (GMP) 
initiative.  They mentioned two areas of possible 
cooperation: illegal fishing and illegal export of oil.  They 
said Indonesia's participation in GMP activities must be 
coordinated through their Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  They 
requested further information, including the origins of this 
initiative, a list of partner countries and a mechanism, such 
as a website, for plugging into the GMP network. 
 
¶2. (U) In a meeting on June 12, 2008 with Indonesian Ocean 
Council (responsible for policy development and coordination) 
Secretary Dr. Rizald Rompas, Head of Secretariat Dasril Munir 
and Head of Planning and Evaluation Sumaryono, they responded 
positively to GMP principles.  They recommended the GMP 
initiative be supported by an organization to provide more 
structure and regular contact among the participants, such as 
an annual conference, for sharing ideas.  Rompas said the 
Council could be part of such an organization.  They 
suggested two topics for GMP activity: monitoring activity 
along long coastlines and illegal fishing.
