¶1.  (U) This is an Action Request--please see paragraph 8. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Embassy Jakarta shared the revised draft 
Science and Technology Agreement with the Ministry of 
Research and Technology.  The Ministry was very optimistic 
about concluding negotiations on the agreement.  GOI 
interlocutors emphasized that if the GOI and USG were to 
conclude the agreement with the current minister in place, we 
would need to complete negotiations before the end of August. 
 In light of this, Mission requests a negotiating team arrive 
in Jakarta no later than the week of August 18.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mission thanks Washington for the revised draft 
Science and Technology (S&T) Agreement.  We appreciate the 
thoughtful and thorough review of the Indonesian comments by 
the interagency team. 
 
S&T AGREEMENT DELIVERED 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On July 13, Emboffs shared the S&T Agreement draft 
text with USG comments with interlocutors at the Ministry of 
Research and Technology.  Mission also shared an electronic 
version and a hard-copy color version with the GOI.  Emboffs 
emphasized that the intent of the S&T Agreement was to 
facilitate collaboration and explained that the USG deleted 
some of the GOI suggested text because the USG felt that the 
language would narrow the scope of the proposed agreement. 
Mission also commented that the GOI suggested IPR language in 
Annex I and Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) language could 
be discussed on a case-by-case basis or in implementing 
Memoranda of Understanding, but would be inappropriate for 
the umbrella agreement. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Minister of Research and Technology Kusmayanto 
Kadiman's staff thanked us for delivering the draft 
agreement.  Kadiman's staffers, agreeing to convene an 
interagency meeting on July 17 to review the USG comments, 
conveyed their initial impressions.  Although they would need 
to obtain approval from the relevant agencies, they 
understood our concerns regarding the IPR and MTA language 
and agreed that if the language were included in implementing 
agreements or the issues resolved internationally, inclusion 
in the umbrella S&T Agreement would be unnecessary. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mission discussed the duty free and tax exemption 
language with Kadiman's staff.  Emboffs emphasized that this 
language was required under U.S. law and was now standard in 
all agreements.  The GOI interlocutors had thought the 
language would also apply to commercial endeavors.  Emboffs 
explained that the language applied to materials and services 
financed with USG funds.  The GOI interlocutors said they 
would consult with the other agencies and explain our 
position in a positive manner. 
 
URGENCY TO COMPLETE NEGOTIATIONS 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Ministry interlocutors also told us that the 
Minister wants to complete this agreement as part of his 
legacy before he finishes his term in October.  Additionally, 
after the new cabinet minister is announced in early October, 
Minister Kadiman may be reluctant to sign a new agreement. 
The GOI will slow down during Ramadan (August 20 through 
September 21), further reducing the time available to 
complete negotiations.  Our supporters within Indonesian 
governmental institutions are prepared to move quickly and 
have agreed to a series of digital video conferences (DVCs). 
They requested that the first occur before the end of July, 
with a second, if necessary to occur in early August.  They 
would like to conclude negotiations before the end of August, 
when Ramadan begins. 
 
ACTION REQUEST 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Action Request -- Mission requests that Department 
send a negotiating team to Jakarta no later than the week of 
August 18 to complete negotiations on the S&T Agreement. 
Mission will be in touch with Tamara Scott in OES to confirm 
details of the team's visit.
