Background and Fact Finding 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On the morning of Friday 06 November 2009, Econoff visited the 
offices of PT Transavia Utama (Transavia) located at Jalan Denpasar 
Raya Block D2, Kuningan, Jakarta 12940.  Transavia 
was located in a large modern office building and their presence 
there was clearly marked.  Transavia had a comprehensive and fully 
functioning website, www.transavia.co.id.  In setting 
up the appointment, Econoff was easily able to contact Transavia and 
speak with an individual who clearly identified themselves as a 
representative of the company.  Setting up a meeting date to visit 
the Transavia offices was transparent and easy. 
 
¶3.  Econoff spoke for approximately 30 minutes with the open and 
friendly Rizwan Halim, President Director of Transavia.  Mr. Halim 
spoke excellent English and advised that he had graduated from the 
University of California at Santa Barbara.  During discussions with 
Mr. Halim Econoff learned that Transavia represented several US 
aerospace, telecommunications, engineering and office system 
companies in Indonesia. These 
companies included Raytheon, Rockwell Collins, ITT Defense 
Electronics Services, and L-3 Communications.  Within Indonesia, 
Transavia's primary clients were the Indonesian Air Force, Navy, 
Police, and the Department of Transportation.  Mr. Halim stated 
that he is also interested in promoting his business internationally 
and already has the Abu Dhabi Police Air Wing, Royal Brunei Air 
Force, and Brunei Shell Aviation as clients. Mr. Halim verified that 
he does not have any other international customers. 
 
¶4.  Transvia was established in 1977 and now has over 1,000 
employees.  Econoff confirmed that Transavia does not/not store USML 
items on behalf of its clients.  In addition to Transavia, Mr. 
Rizwan acts as director for two other business entities that share 
Transavia's office space; Tranvira Air which primarily leases 
business jets to the petroleum companies within Indonesia, as well 
as Cakrawala Automotif Rabhasa, which is an Authorized Mercedes-Benz 
dealer in Jakarta. 
 
¶5.  Econoff is unaware of any derogatory background information on 
Transavia.  Econoff highlighted to Mr. Hamlin the important position 
that he occupied as a named and authorized representative of USML 
products and urged him to always comply with regulations which 
regulated businesses such as his, and primarily with regards to end 
user documentation.  Mr. Halim stated that he understood the 
importance of this issue and that 
he was never to re-transfer or re-export and piece of equipment not 
strictly authorized for this purpose.
