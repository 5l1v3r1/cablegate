SUBJECT: Yudhoyono Advisor -- the Time is Now for a Strategic 
Partnership 
 
¶1. (SBU) The time is now to build a U.S.-Indonesian strategic 
partnership according to President Yudhoyono's key economic advisor. 
 Chatib Basri, who served as SBY's sherpa to the November 2008 G20 
Summit in Washington, said there is new-found enthusiasm throughout 
the Indonesian government to work with the United States.  In the 
past, many Indonesians sought to distance themselves from the U.S. 
Now, given President Obama's tremendous popularity in Indonesia, 
government officials are looking at ways to associate with the U.S. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Basri emphasized that Indonesia is ready be a partner, not 
just an aid recipient.  President Yudhoyono is seeking ways to 
increase Indonesia's international standing through his leadership 
role on climate change and participation in the G20 process to 
address the global financial crisis.  Basri acknowledged that 
Indonesia does not yet have the self-confidence to play an 
international role commensurate with its population.  But, he added, 
working in partnership with the U.S. on global issues would help 
Indonesia develop the confidence it needs.
