 ¶1. (SBU) The executions of the so-called "Poso 3"-Fabianus 
Tibo, Dominggus da Silva and Martinus Riwu-in Central 
Sulawesi following their 2001 convictions for mass murder, 
torture and arson, have been scheduled to take place on 
August 12.  The three were found guilty of a series of brutal 
murders between May 23 and June 30, 2000 in Poso, Central 
Sulawesi (ref C).  They have exhausted all avenues of appeal, 
including clemency from the President, and their guilt 
appears to be well established (ref A).  The three convicts 
and Tibo's family were notified of the impending execution by 
the Central Sulawesi Prosecutor's Office on August 9.  There 
is speculation that the timing of the executions may be 
linked to the Attorney General's recent announcement of a 
date for the execution of the 2002 Bali Bombers (ref B).
